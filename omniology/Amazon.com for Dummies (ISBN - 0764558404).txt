About the Author
In February 1998, Mara Friedman was hired to be the Amazon.com in-house
copywriter. In the two-and-a-half years that followed, she was the marketing
communications manager, the e-cards associate editor, and the senior editor
of Outdoor Living. She watched the company grow from a start-up online
bookstore to the world’s largest online destination with more than 30 million
customers.
Today, Mara is a partner at Smartypants Communications, a graphic design
and marketing firm based in Seattle. She continues to work with Amazon.com
and her writing has appeared in Marlo Thomas’s The Right Words at the Right
Time, The Oprah Magazine, and on Amazon.com itself.

Amazon.com For Dummies

Introduction
W
elcome to Amazon.com For Dummies — the ultimate Amazon.com ref-
erence tool! “Wait,” you say, “Amazon.com is so easy to use, it already
is for dummies.” And in some ways you’re right. On the most basic level,
Amazon.com is very easy to use. They do that on purpose so the 30 million
people who already shop there will continue to buy things. But of those 30
million people, just a fraction are using Amazon.com to it’s fullest potential.
Amazon.com For Dummies is for everyone else — the millions of people who
aren’t yet Amazon.com customers, and the millions who are but so far just
skate lightly across the store’s surface.
Amazon.com isn’t an ordinary store. It isn’t even an ordinary online store. In
fact, in many ways, it isn’t a store at all. It’s an internet-based cornucopia of
shopping and selling delights! At Amazon, you can buy just about any book in
the Library of Congress. You can get movie showtimes for your local theater.
You can list your independently produced CD. You can auction off a vintage
rocking chair. You can research, find, discover, buy, or sell just about any-
thing. It’s truly an amazing place (and I’m not just saying that just because 
I once worked there). But to make the most of what Amazon has to offer, you
have to know how to use the site and, perhaps more important, you actually
have to know what Amazon has to offer. That’s where this book comes in.
Amazon.com For Dummies is both a starter’s guide and a reference tool. If
you’ve never been to Amazon.com before, you could pick this book up and
use it to find your way around the store, set up your account, and make your
first purchase. If you’re already an Amazon customer, you might use it to get
more from Amazon’s personalization features or as a guide to help you start
selling on the site. The book is a comprehensive map of the store with
descriptions of and instructions on how to buy, sell, and do just about any-
thing at Amazon.com.
About This Book
Even if you’ve already shopped there, and especially if you haven’t, you
should think of Amazon.com as an exciting destination and this book as your
travel guide. You don’t need to read every page and you don’t need to read it
chronologically. (But if you want to, feel free. You’ll be an absolute shopping
sage.) You should use the book to navigate your trip. In it, I tell you where to
go, what to do when you get there, and what to bring along (if you’re shop-
ping, that’d be your adventurous spirit and your credit card).

More specifically, you get the word on how to
 Get to Amazon.com and set up your account.
 Find your way around the site.
 Make your first purchase (for those of you who are newbies).
 Use the Amazon.com personalization features to make your shopping
experience richer.
 Create your own zShop or use Marketplace so you can sell things at
Amazon.
 Participate in an Amazon.com Auction.
 Join the Amazon.com community.
 Take advantage of partnership opportunities with Amazon.com.
Foolish Assumptions
I hate to assume anything. But I have to believe that if you’re reading this book,
you already know a few things about Amazon.com and a few things about the
Internet. I’m also hoping you’re ready to use the site, and by ready I mean 
 You have access to a computer that has access to the Internet.
 You are interested in buying the products that Amazon sells. And/or . . . 
 You are interested in selling the products that Amazon allows its users
to sell.
 You have a credit card. (It’s not essential to shopping at Amazon.com,
but it makes things a whole lot easier.)
 You are comfortable with the idea of using that credit card online.
(Again, not absolutely essential, but extremely helpful.) 
It’s not hard to fall in love with Amazon.com. Once you’ve experienced the
breadth of selection, the depth of information, and the wonders of no-hassle
shopping, you’ll be head over heels. But you do need a computer and it helps
to know a little bit about the Internet. As for the credit-card issue, we talk more
about that in Chapter 3, but for now, let’s just say that shopping at Amazon
without a credit card is like going for a swim in a down-filled snowsuit — it can
be done, but it won’t be very much fun.

How This Book Is Organized
Like all good reference tools, this book is set up to be read “as needed.” It’s
divided into five parts: the basics, shopping and buying, using community fea-
tures, selling, and the Part of Tens. So if you just want to know how to become
an Amazon Associate, read Chapter 18. If you want to find out how to write a
product review, read Chapter 12. If you’re a complete novice and you want to
be walked through the basics of the store, Chapters 1 and 2 do the trick.
That said, one of the most incredible things about Amazon is the sheer quan-
tity of good stuff they have on their site. You may be someone who’s been
shopping at Amazon since the days of yore back in1996, but I’ll bet you’re only
aware of about one third of what there is at Amazon. So you may want to leaf
through the whole book, or at least the Table of Contents. You’ll be amazed.
Part I: Testing the Waters: Finding 
Your Way Around the Store
This is where you cut your teeth on the Amazon basics. I walk you through
the essentials of the site — what it is, what you can and can’t do there, and
so on — and give you a bird’s eye view of what Amazon has to offer. I show
you an account setup, cover site nomenclature, and help you discover what
you need to know about the Help department so you can get answers to any
questions you may still have down the line.
Part II: You Want It? They Got It:
Shopping & Buying at Amazon.com
The question isn’t, “What do they sell?” It’s “What don’t they sell?” In this part, 
I cover the items for sale in detail including gifts, services, and some of the
wackier things you probably don’t know about. I show you how to search for
the things you want and then how to find out whether they’re worth buying. I
also walk you through the basic buying process (or the “order pipeline” as they
say at Amazon) so you’ll be ready to roll.

Introduction

Part III: The More the Merrier: 
The Amazon.com Community
You may think you’re a good shopper. You may even think of yourself as a
shopping diva. But let me assure you, you haven’t shopped until you’ve
shopped at Amazon.com. They’ve turned the experience into an art form and
it’s truly a thing of beauty.
In this part, I show you how to use the cool personalization features that
Amazon has created and explain how the combination of technology and a
community of 30 million make for simply blissful buying.
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com
There are several ways to (believe it or not) make money at Amazon.com.
There are straight selling opportunities, straight partnership opportunities,
and a few opportunities that are a little bit of both. In this part, I cover them all. 
You find out how to sell using Marketplace, how to post your own auction,
and how to build your own storefront using zShops. I also show you how you
can earn money on your own Web site by joining the Associates program and
how you can “level the playing field” with Advantage — Amazon’s distribu-
tion system for independent labels and publishers.
Part V: The Part of Tens
It wouldn’t be a Dummies book without The Part of Tens. In this section, you
find ten different e-mails that you might get from Amazon, ten ways to get
great deals, and the ten strangest things you can find on the site.
You also find an appendix that covers Honor System and Amazon Anywhere —
two of Amazon’s lesser known (and slightly esoteric) programs. 
Icons Used in This Book
Think of this as the Dummies version of a New York City cabby. You want a
good shortcut? Need a hint on how to get where you want to go? The Tip icon
will show you the way.

Amazon.com For Dummies

In the Internet age, it just isn’t okay to tie little strings around your fingers.
Instead, use these Remember icons. They point out things you may (or may
not) already know that are worth keeping in mind.
There’s no need to be afraid here. This isn’t the skull and crossbones of
Internet shopping — more like a “No lifeguard on duty” kind of warning.
These friendly warnings can help you avoid potential pitfalls.

In this part . . . 
A
mazon isn’t called “Amazon” for nothing. It was
named for the world’s largest river (the Amazon
holds more water than any other river), and it’s a place
that proudly boasts of having “Earth’s Biggest Selection.”
In other words, Amazon is big. Really, really big. But it
doesn’t have to be scary.
In Part I, I give you the tools you need to navigate
Amazon.com comfortably. You get a detailed overview of
the site, see the different kinds of pages you may encounter
while shopping, and learn how to make a purchase — from
setting up your account to completing checkout. You also
get a grasp on basic site nomenclature (what things are,
where things are, and how to get there), and you get a
quick brieﬁng on the Help department so you can ﬁnd
answers to questions after you’ve put the book away.

N
o one (except maybe Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos) ever imagined
that one day there would be a way that you could buy everything from
books to barbecues to baby blankets without ever leaving your house or
speaking to another soul. And what seemed like an unlikely gamble more
than eight years ago is now the world’s most popular online shopping desti-
nation. But Amazon.com is more than just a great place to shop.
So what is it? You could say it’s a shopping mall combined with a home
improvement store, plus an outdoor bazaar and a travel agency. And don’t
forget the department store, the newsstand, and the car lot. It’s a place to sell
things and to buy things — to spend money and to make it. A place where
you can get expert opinions and put your own two cents in. It’s a community
of other shoppers and sellers like you. And to get there, all you have to do is
get online.
In this chapter, I give you a comprehensive overview of what Amazon.com is,
what they sell, what they don’t sell, and the myriad other ways you can
interact with the site and the community outside of simply shopping. Soon
enough you’ll understand why Amazon has so many passionate devotees —
you may even join their ranks.
But first, you have to get online and to get online, you need to have a com-
puter with Internet access. After you’ve got that squared away, you’re ready
to go. If you’re a true technological neophyte, you might consider reading
The Internet For Dummies, 9th Edition, by John R. Levine, Carol Baroudi, and
Margaret Levine Young (Wiley Publishing, Inc.). It’ll give you the background
you need to get yourself to Amazon.com comfortably. Otherwise, sit down at
your computer, open the book, and prepare to start paddling!

What Is Amazon.com and Why 
Is It Unlike Any Other Store?
Good question. The best way to really understand Amazon is to stop thinking
of it in brick-and-mortar terms and to start thinking of it in Internet terms.
Amazon is not a place, and it doesn’t have any of the restrictions that a physi-
cal place has. Amazon is a digital venue, and because it’s a digital venue it
can make use of all the benefits of the digital world.
Here are four concrete examples of how using Amazon is different than brick-
and-mortar shopping:
 Amazon has limitless shelf space. Because they’re more of an online
catalog than a retail store, Amazon doesn’t have to stock the entire
inventory they offer. The downside to this (and to all online shopping) is
that you don’t get to leave the store with your purchase in hand. In fact,
depending on the availability of the item you order, you may have to
wait a few weeks! (Though that’s rare.) The upshot is that they can offer
anything and everything — so you get an infinitely larger selection of
goods.
 Customers are an integral part of Amazon’s sales force. Because
Amazon is web based, they automatically have a place to post extensive
product information, including customer reviews. So when you’re look-
ing to buy, you get the benefit of reading the unbiased opinions of other
users like you — the most honest product information you can come by.
You also get to write your own reviews.
 You can sell things at Amazon. I think that says it all. Let’s face it, if you
walked into a department store tomorrow and tried to sell their cus-
tomers the same products — just slightly used and cheaper — you
might find yourself spending the afternoon in the slammer. But not at
Amazon. Instead of calling the cops, they help you peddle your wares
and then they take a cut.
 Amazon really knows you. Sad though it may be, I can safely say that
Amazon knows me better than several of my ex-boyfriends. That’s
because every time I shop, Amazon remembers what I bought and stores
that information. It also gathers and stores information on you and on
its 37 million other customers every time any of you shop. Then it com-
bines all that information and uses it to determine what we like, what we
might like, and what we don’t like, so our shopping experience is better.
Now don’t be alarmed. They don’t use this information to invade your
privacy in any way. In fact, Amazon has one of the best privacy policies
in the online world. If you’re concerned, you can find out more about it
in Chapter 4.
10
Part I: Testing the Waters: Finding Your Way Around the Store 

What Do They Sell There?
Amazon offers an amazing selection of goods and services from books to air-
line tickets to hardware. You can buy almost anything at Amazon. But you’re
not always buying from Amazon. One of the ways that Amazon can offer such
an extensive selection is by allowing other people — whether large compa-
nies like Target™ or individuals like you and me — to sell on its site. 
Amazon’s product offering is made up of several elements:
 Stuff they sell. Like books or CDs or DVDs. These are the items that
Amazon brings to you straight from the companies that produce them.
In other words, when you buy these items, you’re not buying through a
“middleman” partner, but from Amazon directly — the same way you
buy from any retail store.
 Stuff that large partners are selling. You can buy clothes from The
Gap™ or placemats from Target™ at Amazon, but you’re actually buying
from the partner with Amazon providing the buying venue (and in some
cases, not even that!).
 Services. The bulk of the services that Amazon has to offer are free, so
you’re not so much buying them as you are using them. You’ll find every-
thing from e-mail notification services to free e-cards.
 Stuff that small partners are selling. A small partner (including you!)
can sell something as small and simple as a single book or set up an
entire mini store on Amazon’s site.
11
Chapter 1: Amazon.com 101
What’s in a name?
In May of 1994, Amazon.com was just an idea 
in Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos’ head. He
wanted to use the Internet as a platform to sell
products. Simple, but smart. The first thing he did,
after writing a business plan, was come up with
the name. “We’ll call it ‘Cadabra,’” he said to a
friend. “Cadaver?” the friend replied. Maybe not.
Choice number two had two bits of criteria to live
up to: It had to communicate depth and breadth
and it had to start with an “A” so it would show
up first in search results. Jeff got out the dictio-
nary and started looking. On page 20, just after
“amaze” but before “ambassador,” Amazon.com
was born. The name met both bits of criteria. It
starts with an “A” and it metaphorically commu-
nicates both depth and breadth (the Amazon is
the world’s largest river in terms of water
volume). In keeping with the spirit, Amazon’s
URLs are sprinkled with Portuguese — the lan-
guage of Brazil, home to the watery Amazon. You
may notice “obidos” in several of the URLs. That
word refers to the part of the Amazon where the
river’s tributaries come together. Keep looking
and you’ll find others. It helps, of course, to speak
Portuguese.

The stores
There are 19 different Amazon.com stores — not including certain partner
stores, which I’ll get to later. I’m defining a store here as a self-contained set of
pages on Amazon’s site, set up to sell a collection of like products — books,
music, DVDs, and so on. I’m also excluding Auctions, zShops, and the Outlet
(more on those later).
Those 19 stores are as follows: Apparel & Accessories, Sporting Goods,
Books, Computers, DVD, Magazine Subscriptions, Music, Video, Toys &
Games, Baby, Camera & Photo, Computer & Video Games, Electronics, Office
Products, Software, Home & Garden, Kitchen & Housewares, Outdoor Living,
and Tools & Hardware. That’s today’s list, but Amazon is always adding more
stores. 
Each one of these stores has its own home page, such as the one for music that
you see in Figure 1-1. You could go to any one of these store home pages and
find similar content options, features, and selection. They are “freestanding” in
many ways (they have their own categories and subcategories, special features,
and subnavigation options) though they often introduce merchandise from
other stores when relevant.

Part I: Testing the Waters: Finding Your Way Around the Store 

Partners
Amazon.com has three kinds of partners. Let’s call the first kind “large
partners.” Large partners are companies like Target or Toys ‘R’ Us, who are
selling their own merchandise in a buying and selling interface that Amazon
provides. In other words, Amazon creates the actual pages on their site that
allow you to make purchases from these other companies, but they don’t
determine the products that will be offered and they don’t stock any of the
inventory. You’ll notice that when you go to these stores, they bear the part-
ner’s name along with (and even more prominently than) Amazon’s name. 
Let’s refer to the second kind of partner as a “small partner.” That’s not neces-
sarily a reflection of the size of the company, but rather their presence on
Amazon’s site. Small partners are companies that offer some of their products in
existing Amazon stores. (In other words, they are not stores unto themselves.)
Those products appear side by side with products from other similar partners
and even products from Amazon itself. Small partners include companies like
Circuit City in Electronics or The Gap in Apparel & Accessories.
Amazon calls the third partner type “trusted partners.” Trusted partners
are companies that offer products and/or services that Amazon doesn’t —
products like cars or medications and services like booking travel and photo
development, and so on. Amazon checks these partners out, makes sure
they’re good to do business with, and then includes what are essentially links
to these partners on their site. But when you interact with a trusted partner,
you are typically using the trusted partner Web site, not Amazon.com. There
will be a link to Amazon at the top of the page, but you’re no longer actually
there. And if you were to go to, say, Hotwire directly (by typing in the URL as
opposed to clicking there from Amazon), there’d be no Amazon logo at the
top of the page. Amazon’s other trusted partners include: audible.com,
CarsDirect.com, Ofoto.com, and The Vacation Store. 
There is a significant difference between buying from partners and buying 
from Amazon itself. When you buy from a partner — whether it’s large, small,
or trusted — you are dealing with that company, even if you’re doing it through
Amazon’s site. So make sure you’re familiar with their rules and policies —
especially returns policies.
Services
On their Web site, Amazon identifies the following long list of items as “ser-
vices:” Amazon.com Visa Card, Associates Program, Cars, Chat, Corporate
Accounts, Friends & Favorites, Movie Showtimes, Restaurants, Travel, Web
13
Chapter 1: Amazon.com 101

Services, Your Recommendations, and Your Store. It’s true that everything on
that list might serve you in some way as you use the site, but for the purposes
of this book (and for the purposes of using the site effectively) I’m going to
define “services” as something helpful, free, and voluntary. With that as the
definition, I’d edit Amazon’s list and add a few items.
Of the 12 items Amazon lists, only chat, corporate accounts, movie show-
times, and restaurants are truly services by my definition. The others are
cool personalization features (and we’ll talk about those in Chapter 11),
Amazon partnership opportunities, or stuff to buy. To our new list of four, I’d
add special occasion reminders, e-mail notifications, and free e-cards. Figure
1-2 is the e-cards home page. E-cards is set up like its own little store and it’s
especially dear to me as I wrote a lot of them (only the good ones, of course).
Table 1-1 has a quick overview of Amazon’s free services:

You can view menus online, read and write restaurant

Boston, Washington D.C., and San Francisco.
e-cards
You’ll find free e-cards for any and every occasion. You
can add music and/or attach gift certificates to any 
e-card. 
Special occasion 
This free service ensures that you will never miss your 
reminders
mother’s birthday again! Just enter in important dates and
Amazon will send you a reminder e-mail. Technically, this
is an e-mail notification, but I’m giving it it’s own props
because I think it’s the handiest of the bunch.
E-mail notifications
Amazon offers seven different e-mail notifications that you
can subscribe to for free. Most of them inform you of
products you might want — things like new releases, CDs
from your favorite artists, and so on.
Marketplace, Auctions, and zShops
Marketplace, Auctions, and zShops feature items being sold by other Amazon
users — anything from a used copy of the book you’re looking for to an
antique lunch box. Marketplace, Auctions, and zShops are not one and the
same. Here’s a quick overview of each:
 Marketplace. This is the program that Amazon has developed to allow
users like you and me to sell used versions of the items they already
have for sale on the site. You can buy or sell items in the following cate-
gories: books, music, DVDs, videos, video games, PC games, camera and
photo, electronics, kitchen tools, and hardware and outdoor living. But
only items that are already in Amazon’s catalog are eligible for
Marketplace.
 Auctions. Amazon.com Auctions are like a mini eBay. People list their
items and they go to the highest bidder. It’s a good place to get rare or
unusual finds. Figure 1-3 shows the Auctions home page.
 zShops. Think of these as Web boutiques. Most zShops are small retail-
ers who want to have a Web presence and want to make use of Amazon’s
huge customer base. Sometimes zShops will offer the same items that
15
Chapter 1: Amazon.com 101

you can find in the Amazon catalog, but more often than not, they offer
specialty merchandise.
When you buy something from one of these three venues, you’re not actually
buying from Amazon, you’re buying from a person like you through the Amazon
Web site. That’s not to say that it’s a selling free-for-all. In fact, Amazon has very
clear and defined rules about how sellers can sell and protection for buyers as
well. It just means you may need to put in a little bit of due diligence before you
buy.
What Don’t They Sell There?
There are actually lots and lots of things that Amazon doesn’t sell. (Though it
doesn’t often seem like it when you’re trying to wade through search results.)
The list is long and ever changing, and I won’t bore you with it. Instead, I’ll
give you the basic what-they-won’t-sell guidelines:
 No live animals.
 No firearms.
 Nothing immediately perishable. (You can buy a frozen T-bone or sub-
scribe to a fruit-of-the-month club, but you can’t exactly buy groceries.)
 No hard-core pornography.
That’s about it. That’s not to say that you can find anything else at Amazon.
Just that it’s a possibility.
Figure 1-3:
You can buy
and sell
strange and
wonderful
things at

Auctions.
16
Part I: Testing the Waters: Finding Your Way Around the Store 

What Can (and Can’t) You Sell?
You can sell anything from a used dictionary to you grandmother’s flowered
tablecloth on Amazon.com. Among Marketplace, Auctions, and zShops, you’ll
find a venue for just about any item.
What’s more important is what you can’t sell at Amazon. Start with their list
of no-nos — live animals, hard core porn, perishables and firearms — and
add: offensive material, illegal items, stolen goods, items that infringe upon
an individual’s privacy, promotional media, copied video games, copied soft-
ware, copies of movies or television programs, recopied or bootlegged music,
devices that would allow unauthorized transmission of a satellite signal, repli-
cas of trademarked items, items that use celebrity images or names to sell
without the permission of said celebrities, domain names, advertisements,
products that have been recalled by the Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC), real estate, and wine (or other alcoholic beverages).
Many of the things on the list inspire either a “huh?” or a “duh!” and we’ll
cover this list in more detail in Chapters 15 and 16. Suffice to say, though,
that the main guideline you should rely on when selling is common sense.
And remember, no decent person wants to buy a human heart or a hot car
stereo online.
Partnership Opportunities
There are three other ways to use Amazon.com to make money outside of
actually selling things. I like to call them “partnership opportunities” and
Amazon calls them: Amazon Honor System, Associates Program, and
Amazon.com Advantage.
Here’s a brief overview of each:
 Amazon Honor System. The Honor System allows users who have their
own Web sites to request voluntary donations from their visitors with
payment running through Amazon.com. You can also use the Honor
system to charge visitors to view or use the content on your site (a la
online subscriptions). Amazon provides the graphics and software. You
set it up.
 Associates Program. The Associates program is essentially an online
referral arrangement. You put a link to Amazon on your site, and every
time someone uses it and then buys something at Amazon, you get a
referral fee. Again, they provide the materials; you provide the labor.
17
Chapter 1: Amazon.com 101

 Amazon.com Advantage. The Advantage program is part partnership
opportunity and part selling opportunity. In a nutshell, it allows indepen-
dent publishers, music labels, and movie studios to sell their work on
Amazon.com. With the Advantage program, Amazon does more than just
provide graphics. They help with marketing, inventory, distribution, and
so on.
Ooh La La: International Stores
You may not know this, but Amazon is very international. No, I’m not talking
about the global community and how the Web brings us all together. I’m talk-
ing actual international stores. Five of them to be exact: Amazon Canada,
Amazon France, Amazon UK, Amazon Japan, and Amazon Germany.
Now you might ask, “Why does Amazon need international stores when
anyone, anywhere can get online and buy stuff from Amazon?” And I would
say, “That’s true. But . . .” And then I’d explain that Amazon opened interna-
tional stores for the following good reasons:
 The Mother-Tongue Issue. Despite the fact that every time I go to
another country people automatically speak English to me even before I
open my mouth (and, no, I’m not wearing a fanny pack and a Bears
sweatshirt), not everyone on earth speaks English. So Amazon decided
to create native-language stores in other countries that have high
Internet penetration.
 The Shipping Issue. It’s true that anyone anywhere can get online and
buy from Amazon, even though it’s an American company. But if they do,
they’re also paying shipping prices from America, even if they live halfway
around the world. That’ll put a kink in the whole good pricing thing. But
when international shoppers buy from an international Amazon, their
items are shipped from that country. Shipping problem solved!
 The Currency Issue. Remember, Amazon is all about convenience. I’m not
that good at math, so if I were British, for example, I’d much rather buy
items priced in pounds than try to figure out the whole conversion thing.
 The Local Product Issue. Local products are more readily available 
to . . . locals. So if you’re looking for the newest PD James novel, check
out Amazon.co.uk first; if you’re looking for “Harry Potter et l’Ordre du
Phénix,” check out Amazon.fr.
 The National Pride Issue. Some people, though they may speak English
(for example, Canadians, British folks, and bilingual Frenchmen), just want
to buy from a local company. And local companies usually understand
their own people better. So when Amazon opens these international stores,
they work with a local team to make the store authentic and hip to all the
appropriate cultural subtleties. (Well, okay, as an American, I don’t know
what those are, but I know they’re very appropriate and very subtle.)
18
Part I: Testing the Waters: Finding Your Way Around the Store 

Though you can buy tons of foreign language titles at Amazon.com, you are
often buying them as imports. That means they take much longer to arrive.
That said, Amazon has a large selection of Spanish-language books and they
are not all imports. Good news for the Spanish speakers out there as there
are not yet any international Spanish-speaking Amazons.
What Amazon Knows about You 
That No One Else Knows
Amazon knows what you like. Okay, maybe there are other people who know
what you like — your spouse, your mom, your best friend — but do they also
know what you will like before you know it yourself? And do they know how
often you spend money on what you like? And do they know what other
things you should get to go with the stuff you like? And do they have your
credit-card number?
One of the key things that makes Amazon different from any other “store” is its
ability to collect and use information. They call it aggregate customer data —
and they use it very wisely. Every time you shop at Amazon, the site remem-
bers not only what you bought, but also the other items you looked at. Then
the folks at Amazon use that information to find other things you might like.
They also consider all their customer data cumulatively. So if you liked Star
Wars (and who didn’t?) they’ll find other people who liked it too and then
look at the other items those people liked and see if the same items appeal to
you. Smart.
Now don’t get antsy. They’re not going to sell your information to evil tele-
marketers. (Remember, Amazon is profitable these days.) They just want 
you to have a better shopping experience. But if you need reassurance, read
Chapter 4 where I cover their privacy policy as well as credit-card safety
issues.

lenge involved. In fact, for many of us, shopping is soothing (they don’t call it
“retail therapy” for nothing). 
Throw a mouse, a computer, and the information superhighway into the mix
and suddenly shopping becomes a little bit intimidating. But fear not, retail
warrior! Internet shopping is just as easy as real-world shopping, and you can
do it in your skivvies. 
In this chapter, I walk you through the Amzon.com site level by level — from
the home page to your shopping cart. Think of it as the mall equivalent of a
directory. Once you take a good look, you’ll know where things are and how
to get there on your own.
Welcome Home: Amazon.com
There’s no place like home! There’s no place like home! Dorothy had it right.
The home page is where the journey begins. You may not spend much of
your time there, but it’s definitely base camp 1 for all Amazon shoppers.
Because of that, it’s important for you to familiarize yourself with the turf.

Anatomy of the home page
At the simplest level, two components make up the home page (and all
Amazon pages for that matter): navigation elements and content. The former
is what you use to get around the site; the latter is the kind of information
you find there. As a (somewhat flexible) rule, navigation elements live on the
borders of the page, and content makes up the middle.
Figure 2-1 shows the Amazon.com home page and the following key naviga-
tional elements:
 Top, or main, navigation: These are the tabs that sit on top of the col-
ored bar and offers choices like Books, Music, and so on.
 Subnavigation: This is the colored bar below the tabs. It’s unusual on
the home page, as it will take you to a variety of select spots with no par-
ticular similarity or theme. Within the stores, though, the subnavigation
(or subnav) will take you to top-level places of interest within that store.
 Shopping tools: These are the four links — View Cart, Wish List, Your
Account, and Help — that always sit in the upper-right corner of the page.
 Search boxes: There are two search boxes at the top of the left-hand
column: one for searches within Amazon and one for searching the Web
as a whole (via Google).
 Browse box: This sits below the Web-search boxes and holds links to
the various stores and services available at Amazon.com.

Part I: Testing the Waters: Finding Your Way Around the Store

At Amazon, the key navigation elements are in the same place throughout the
site. They may not always offer the same choices (and we get to that later)
but they’re located in the same spot and they serve the same purpose. That’s
one reason Amazon is easy to use.
Top o’ the page to you! Tabs, subnav, 
and other good stuff
You can get just about anywhere in the Amazon.com site by using the naviga-
tion elements at the top of Amazon’s home page. Here’s a more detailed
description of the key elements:
 Amazon.com logo: You don’t need ruby slippers to get back home. If
you ever get lost, just close your eyes, say, “there’s no place like home,”
and click the Amazon logo. The Amazon.com logo is on just about every
page of the site. It sits in the upper-left corner and it almost always takes
you back to the home page. The only times it won’t is when you’re mid-
transaction — in the process of placing an order or setting up some sort
of Amazon account.
 Shopping Tools: The four links above the main and subnavs are your
keys to the nitty-gritty of Amazon shopping. Your Cart shows you what
you’re getting ready to buy; your Wish List shows what you’re hoping
someone else will buy for you. Your Account is where you store and
manage critical data — like your credit-card info, shipping address,
order history, and so on. And Help is exactly that — the place to go
when you need a question answered (if you don’t find it in this book!).
 Tabs: In the days of yore, when Amazon was just an online bookstore, it
was pretty easy to get around. But as they added products, they needed
to add navigational elements to accommodate them. Thus tabs were born.
The tabs at Amazon are a lot like the tabs in your high school notebook —
they’re subject or product specific. Clicking the different tabs will take you
directly to the various stores within Amazon.
 See more stores: You’ll notice this at the top of the page, to the right of
the tabs (there’s a little arrow pointing at it to help you along). This is
your link to the directory — the master list of all Amazon stores and des-
tinations. So if you don’t see the store you want in the tabs, try this.
 Subnav: The colored bar below the tabs is for subnavigation, or subnav.
When you click a tab to go to a specific store, that tab is highlighted and
the subnav offers destination choices within that store. When you’re at the
home page, the Welcome tab is automatically highlighted and your subnav
choices are as follows: International, Top sellers, Target, Today’s Deals,
and Sell Your Stuff. As you move through the site and visit the different
stores, the subnav will change to offer choices appropriate to that store.
23
Chapter 2: The Main Stops on the Shopping Circuit

There are also two or three fun things at the top of Amazon’s home page.
Here’s a quick overview:
 The Greeting: It’s nice to be greeted when you walk into a store — Amazon
knows that — so at the top of the home page, just below the subnav, a little
line of text welcomes you to the store and invites you to sign in.
 Your Gold Box: Calling all bargain shoppers! Your gold box is a collec-
tion of ten screamin’ deals that Amazon gathers for you, basing the list
on your shopping history. You get one chance per day to open your gold
box, and one chance per deal to buy or pass. The deals get refreshed
every 24 hours; it’s good to check back each day.
 The Segway: Some people think it’s weird that there’s an ad for the
Segway Human Transporter on just about every page of Amazon.com.
They’re right. Why is it there? Are the Segway people hurting for cash?
No. It’s there simply because Jeff Bezos loves it. And you have to admit,
it is kind of cool.
Left, right, and center — 
the meat of the page
And a very meaty page it is! Here’s an easy-to-digest description of the good-
ies you’ll find below the subnav on the left side of the page:
 Search: The main search box for the site sits atop the Web search box
on the left-hand side of the page. You can enter keywords to search the
whole site or use the drop-down menu to search within specific stores.
 Web Search: Use this search feature to search the entire Web without
leaving Amazon.com.
 Browse: The browse box on the left side of the page is a complete listing
of all stores at Amazon.com. It serves the same purpose as the See More
Stores link — just another way to navigate the site. You’ll notice that the
first heading within the Browse box is called Featured Stores. This spot
is typically reserved for new stores that Amazon is introducing.
 Make Money: This box features links to all the moneymaking opportuni-
ties at Amazon. Again, you can find the same information at the See More
Stores page.
 Special Features: The last stop on the left side. This is the catchall box
for “everything else.” You’ll find a range of links from e-mail notifications
to free e-cards.
Here’s what you find on the right side of the page:
 Featured Product: Amazon picks the item or service featured in the box
at the top of the right column, basing its pick on your shopping history.
24
Part I: Testing the Waters: Finding Your Way Around the Store

 What’s new: This box, on the right side of the page, is a snippet of the
personalization Amazon.com has to offer. You can see what’s in your
shopping cart, get some recommendations, and view other features
(such as New Releases).
And now for the middle:
 Editorial Content: The content you see in the middle of the page —
before you start scrolling — is an assortment of featured products and
their corresponding editorial content. Again, Amazon picks them accord-
ing to your history. If you’re a new customer, you’ll be looking at content
chosen according to the cumulative buying patterns of all Amazon cus-
tomers. So if you want to get more personal, get shopping!
 Abridged Help: Toward the bottom of the page, below the editorial
content, there’s an abridged version of the links you’ll find in the Help
section. You can track orders, get shipping info, and access the help desk
from this box.
 Search #2: Below the abridged Help box there’s another Amazon search
box. It works the same way as the one at the top of the left column.
 The Footer: Below the search box you’ll find a series of blue links,
including a directory of the stores (takes you to the same place as the
See More Stores link), links to the international stores, and a bunch of
miscellaneous links. This is where you’ll find corporate info like press
releases, job listings, investor information, and so on.
 Bottom of the Page Deals: More screamin’ deals that change daily.
The mystery of the missing tabs: 
How the home page changes
It’s not you. It’s them. Amazon is always changing the home page. So if you go
to the home page on Monday and then go back on Tuesday, it won’t look the
same.
Here are the parts of the home page that will change each time you visit:
 The Tabs: The Welcome tab will always be there but the other tabs
change to reflect the stores you most frequently visit.
 The Editorial Content: Again, Amazon refreshes the editorial content on
the home page depending on how you shop and what you buy.
 Your What’s New Box: This, too, will update itself to reflect any new
purchases or shopping data.
 Featured Product: Something new each time you visit.
 Bottom of the Page Deals: These change daily.
25
Chapter 2: The Main Stops on the Shopping Circuit

Showing you new merchandise is one way Amazon makes your shopping
experience engaging. (People like novelty — just imagine if every time you
went by your favorite boutique, everything in the window was exactly the
same!) But how do they know what to feature and change? You tell them.
Again (and I may be sounding like a broken record here), it’s all based on
your shopping history and that of the Amazon customer population at large.
Hello, John Doe: What happens 
after you buy
I’ve mentioned the greeting at the top of Amazon’s home page. When you set
up an account at Amazon.com, you are officially part of the club, so your
greeting changes. Figure 2-2 shows what the home page looks like for me
each time I visit Amazon.
Amazon uses cookies (for more about cookies see Chapter 3) to remember
you, greet you by name, and offer you personalized recommendations.
Books, Music, and More: 
Pages in the Store
Though it’s important to know your way around the home page, the really
good stuff lives in the stores themselves. Navigating those is as simple as
navigating the home page — and many of the elements are the same.

The Store Directory: Master list 
at your fingertips
Imagine you’ve gone to Amazon to buy a toaster, but when you get to the
home page, there’s no tab for “kitchen.” Remember, the tabs are always
changing in response to what you buy, so the home page may not always
have a specific tab you’re looking for. Instead, try the Store Directory, conve-
niently displayed for you in Figure 2-3.
There are three ways to access the Amazon Store Directory:
 The Browse Box: It’s always on the left side of the home page. So if
you’re at a loss, click that Amazon logo at the top left, go back to the
home page, and voilà!
 See More Stores: It’ll always be at the top of every page, to the right of
the tabs (see the arrow in a circle right next to it?). Click it and you’re
taken to the store directory.
 The Footer: The footer is at the bottom of every page on the site. The
second blue link is the one for Directory of All Stores. Just click and
you’re there.
Anatomy of a store home page
The store home pages are a lot like the main home page. They’re set up the
same way — navigation at the top and left, content in the middle — but a few
important things are different.
Figure 2-3:
The Store
Directory is
the place to

store any

27
Chapter 2: The Main Stops on the Shopping Circuit

Here’s a list of elements you already know about that change from store to
store:
 Subnav: The subnavs are store specific, so each one is different. As a
rule, though, the subnav offers links to top-level destinations within a
given store. For example, you won’t find a link to “juicers” in the Kitchen
store’s subnav — but you do find a link to “small appliances” and other
broad categories.
 Browse Box: Here’s where you get full access to the subcategories in
each store. Figure 2-4 shows the Browse box for the Kitchen store.
You can also access each store’s directory (where you find the master
list of subcategories) by clicking the Browse link in that store’s subnav.
Each store has one, though the link isn’t always called “Browse.” I’m
confident that your powers of deduction can find it!
Editorial Content: The center of any store’s home page is devoted to
content from, you guessed it, that store. (Forgive me if I’m taking this
whole Dummy thing too far.)
The store home pages also offer some new elements:
 Top Sellers: Not every store has a Top Sellers box on the right side of
the page, but most do. You’ll also almost always find a Top Sellers link in
the store subnavs.
Figure 2-4:
Kitchen’s
Browse box
includes
links to
all the
subcat-
egories.
28
Part I: Testing the Waters: Finding Your Way Around the Store

 Your Recent History: Figure 2-5 shows an example of a Your Recent
History box. This handy box of links lives at the bottom of the page
below the editorial content. As you shop, Amazon keeps track of where
you’ve been so that if you lose track of a specific store tab, you can still
use these links to get back to the stores you’ve visited.
Drilling down to subcategories
If you know what you want, it’s easy enough to go to Amazon, enter a key-
word in the search box, and find it (and I show you exactly how to do that in
Chapter 8). But if you’re not that certain — say, you know you want a Latin
CD, but you’re not sure which one — No hay ni una problema. Each store at
Amazon, including the Music store, is broken into several subcategories.
Browsing is a snap.
There are two ways to access the subcategories within any Amazon store:
 Use the Browse Box: Ah the browse box. The source of so much shop-
ping goodness. You’ll find one in each store and it’ll list subcategories
galore. Just click to go straight to that subcategory page.
 Click the Browse Link in the Subnav: Clicking this link in a store’s
subnav will take you to that store’s directory. Once there, you can click
again to get to specific subcategory pages.
You should know that not all subcategory pages are created equal; they don’t
all work exactly the same way. They do, however, all serve the same purpose —
and if you’re comfortable with the way Amazon works as a site, you won’t have
any problem clicking your way around the subcategory pages.
Figure 2-6 shows the Latin subcategory in the Music store, broken down into
even more specific genres. They’ve also thrown in a few featured items on the
right side of the page.
Drill down one more level (to, say, Mambo) and the page changes again to
reveal a list of products. This is the last stop until the detail page — the page
that features an individual product (more on this later in the chapter).
Figure 2-5:
Your Recent
History

tabs!
29
Chapter 2: The Main Stops on the Shopping Circuit

Changing your view
You may have noticed that when you hit the subcategory pages a new naviga-
tion option shows up. Between the main and subnavs and the meat of the
subcategory page there is a new set of tabs. These are the View tabs: Featured,
Recommendations, New Releases, Top Sellers, and Used. Just as you can with
the tabs on the main nav, you can click these tabs to change your view within
a subcategory page.
Again, not every store has this View Change option in exactly the same place.
Don’t let this throw you off. Often (as with many Amazon navigational features)
you can access the same information in a variety of ways — through the
subnav, in the Browse box, on the right side of the page, and so on.
Where am I? Following the trail 
of breadcrumbs
It stinks to be lost. And when you’re online, there’s no kindly old man on the
corner to ask for directions. Amazon has solved this problem with the
Internet equivalent of a breadcrumb trail.
The breadcrumb trail is the simplest way to locate yourself when you’re up to
your ears in shopping. You’ll find it at the top left of the page below the subnav,
Figure 2-6:
The Latin
music
subcategory
page.
30
Part I: Testing the Waters: Finding Your Way Around the Store

but you’ll only find it on pages between the first subcategory level and the
detail page (see the next section for more on the detail page). Happily, there’s
no hungry, evil witch waiting at the end of this trail to serve you as dinner.
Figure 2-7 shows the breadcrumb trail for the Comic page in the bookstore —
the line going Books➪Subjects➪Literature & Fiction➪General➪Comic. Notice
that you not only can use it to locate yourself, but you can also click the links
in the trail to access the other parts of the store.
Getting the Most Out of the Detail Page
Every item sold at Amazon.com has its own detail page where you can (usu-
ally) see a picture of the product, get product information, read reviews, and
actually add the product to your shopping cart. The detail page is the end of
the “just looking” line — the last stop before you enter the order pipeline. It’s
also a wellspring of information — and if you’re a serious shopper, it can help
you make informed buying decisions.
Detail page basics
The detail page shares the same basic setup with both the home page and
the store home pages: navigation on the top and left, content down the middle. 
Figure 2-7:

crumb trail

Chapter 2: The Main Stops on the Shopping Circuit

Here are some of the other new elements you’ll find on the detail page (see
Figure 2-8):
 Product Image: Most, but not all, of the items for sale at Amazon are
accompanied by a product image. If you click the image, you can see a
larger version of it.
 Product Information: You’ll find the essential product information —
price and availability — right next to the product image in the center of
the page. There are links to more detailed buying information in the box
in the left nav.
 Ready to Buy? Box: Here’s where the magic happens. On the right side
of the page, just below the nav, you’ll find the Ready to Buy? box. If
you’re new to Amazon, it’ll only offer you the option of adding the item
to your cart. If you’ve already made a purchase, you’ll also have the
option to buy with 1-Click — the absolutely divine (and patented) tech-
nology that stores your credit card and shipping information and allows
you to buy things by clicking just one button! 
 More Buying Choices: This sits just below the Ready to Buy? box and
offers you other options for the product you’re looking at — usually
used items, but sometimes the exact same product you’re already look-
ing at, offered at a better price from some other merchant. It pays to
check this out!

Part I: Testing the Waters: Finding Your Way Around the Store

More product information
You can actually find out a lot about a product on the detail page — more
than just how much it costs and when it will ship. To get detailed product
information, just scroll. Below the product image, but above the editorial
reviews, you’ll find a heading called Product Details, or maybe Features; it
varies from store to store. Figure 2-9, for example, shows that “Features” is the
term of choice for an item in the Electronics store. This is where you’ll find
more specific information about your product. If you’re looking at an item in
the Electronics store, you’ll likely find technical data here. If you’re browsing
the Books store, you’ll see stuff like the number of pages for a title and pub-
lisher info. You’ll also discover the item’s Amazon.com sales ranking — not
essential, but kind of fun.
Sooner or later, you come across some items where the product information
is downright lame. Apparel, Home and Garden, Tools and Hardware, and cer-
tain other stores have the occasional dead end when it comes to information.
That’s when it’s not a bad idea to visit that manufacturer’s Web site to find
out more about the product.
“Customers who bought this...”
and other nifty tricks
Amazon’s nothing if not an amazing discovery machine — and they know
how to make online shopping fun. The detail page is a shining example of
their genius at work — chock-full of clever, fun “discovery” mechanisms.
Remember, they are always collecting data about their customers and then
putting it to good use.

Chapter 2: The Main Stops on the Shopping Circuit

The Customers Who Bought This Also Bought This feature is one fun way of
finding other products you might like. But it’s not exactly the same store to
store — it doesn’t always have the same name and it isn’t always in the exact
same place and some items don’t have it at all. Scroll below the product
image and detailed information to check.
Editorial reviews
Editorial reviews are one of the things that put Amazon on the map. They
are expert opinions — not entirely unbiased (because what opinions are?) —
of people who are industry experts who’ve sampled the products, regular
people who’ve sampled the products, or Amazon editors who’ve sampled
the products. Either way, the reviews are legitimate, not a bunch of sales-ey
schlock. 
Not all products have editorial reviews, but if they do, you’ll find them some-
where between the detailed product info and the footer. You might find just
an Amazon.com review, or a review from another industry source, or a com-
bination of both.
Customer reviews
What a novel (and risky) idea — let customers review the products they buy
and post their reviews on the site. Customer reviews are one of the things
that keep Amazon on the map. They’re an essential and excellent part of
shopping at Amazon.com.
Customer reviews always live beneath editorial reviews on the detail page.
Some are positive. Some are negative. You’ll often find both positive and neg-
ative reviews for the same product (as my mother would say, “that’s what
makes the world go ’round.”). The key thing about customer reviews is that
they’re honest.
Figure 2-10 shows a customer review for eBay For Dummies. Every customer
review is made up of five components: the star rating, a review title, the date
it was written, the reviewer’s information, and the review itself.
For more about customer reviews, see Chapter 8 — and get a head start on
writing one of your own in Chapter 12.

The Bottomless Shopping Cart
Is there anything more beautiful than a shopping cart that can never be too
full? Mount Rainier on a clear summer day? The work of the Great Masters?
The love between a boy and his dog? I don’t know. My money’s on the bottom-
less shopping cart. And the best thing is, no shopper’s guilt. There are no
hungry salespeople jonesing for a commission at Amazon.com. So you can
pack that cart to the high heavens and never buy a single thing in it. I’m con-
stantly putting outrageous items in my shopping cart, just because I can —
plasma TVs, cashmere sweaters, the Segway Human Transporter. It’s mine,
it’s private, it’s impermanent, and, for crying out loud, it’s bottomless!
How do you get there?
You can always access your shopping cart from the Shopping Tools at the top
right of every page. Just click the link that says view cart (it’s accompanied
by a little picture of — you guessed it — a shopping cart).
Also, no matter what computer you use when you shop Amazon, you have
the same shopping cart. So you can put stuff in there at home and buy it later
when you’re at work. (Shopping at work is fun.)
What’s in it?
Even if you’ve never put anything in it, your shopping cart is full of possibil-
ity. There are three key components to your shopping cart:
 Recently Viewed Items: If nothing else, you’ll have these in your cart.
Amazon tracks your shopping — not just your buying — and offers up
the other items you showed interest in right at the moment of truth.
Figure 2-10:
A basic
customer
review.
35
Chapter 2: The Main Stops on the Shopping Circuit

 Items to buy now: These are the items you put in your cart very recently,
like during the same visit. These will become saved items if you don’t buy
them in that visit.
 Saved items: There are actually two kinds of saved items in your shop-
ping cart: the items that you’ve put in your cart within the last 90 days,
but didn’t buy, and the items you put in your cart and actively saved by
clicking the Save for Later button to the right of the quantity field. (See
Figure 2-11.) The former will disappear after 90 days. The latter won’t.
And here’s the rub: If you unintentionally add something to your cart
that’s already in the saved section, it won’t appear in the To Buy Now
area. So don’t be confused. Just go to your saved items and click the
Move To Cart button. That’ll take care of it.

hat if you walked into your favorite department store and found a spe-
cial place there with your name on it? And what if, in that special
place, you found a wellspring of personal shopping data — a log of your
shopping history, all your pertinent shopping information, lists of things you
might like to buy in the future; you name it? And what if you could go to that
special place without ever talking to a single salesperson? “Ah, to dream . . . “
you might say. And to that I’d respond, “Today is your lucky day!” Because at
Amazon.com, that special place is called “Your Account.”
Your Account may very well be the most important area at Amazon.com. It’s
where you store and manage critical data like your order history, your credit-
card information, your name and address, and your password. It’s also the place
where you’ll shape your Amazon shopping experience with tools like 1-Click
settings, your Address Book, and the Recommendation Wizard. But before
you can reap the benefits of Your Account, you have to set up Your Account.
In this chapter, I walk you through an account set up, show you how to edit
your existing account, and give you tips on how to get the most out of the
features your account has to offer. By the time you’re through, you will be
truly the Master of Your Account. 
Who Are You? Setting Up a New Account
Setting up a new account is a snap. It’s a three-step process and won’t take more
than a minute or two. In fact, registering at Amazon is a commitment-phobe’s

delight. All they want from you is your name, your e-mail address, and a pass-
word. You don’t give up the real goods — credit-card info, shipping addresses,
and so on — until you buy. 
Actually, you can browse the site and even add items to the shopping cart
before you set up an account. When you’re ready to buy, Amazon will walk you
through the account setup as part of the buying process. But if you want to
make use of Amazon’s cool recommendation and personalization features, and
you’re not yet ready to buy, you’ll need an account. Here’s how to set one up:
1. Fire up your favorite Web browser and point it to www.amazon.com.
The home page of the Amazon.com site duly appears.
2. Click the Start Here link in the home page greeting. You’ll find the
Start Here link at the top right of the page, right underneath the navi-
gation bars. (See Figure 3-1.)
You’ll be taken to the Amazon Sign In screen that looks like Figure 3-2.
You’ll use this page to sign in every time you want to make a purchase,
access Your Account, or do anything on the site that may be considered
private or involve your personal information. 
3. Choose the No, I’m a New Customer option.
If you’re new (and I’m guessing you are, or you wouldn’t be reading this),
you don’t need to enter your e-mail yet. You’ll enter it on the next screen.
4. Click the Sign-In Using Our Secure Server button.
You’ll come to a screen that looks like Figure 3-3. This is where you’ll
enter the information that will make up Your Account (initially, that is).
5. Enter your name and e-mail address (twice) in the fields provided.
They want your name so that they can greet you by name when you
come to the site and so there’s no confusion if and when you do decide
to buy (that is, your name matches the name on your credit card). They
need your e-mail address because that’s how they recognize you when
you sign in for shopping adventures down the road. It’s essentially your
user ID. They also use it to contact you about the status of your orders.
They ask for it twice to make sure you didn’t mistype the first time.
You’ll notice that they also provide drop-down menus to enter your
birthday. This is totally optional. They want it so they can send you a
birthday e-mail with a little marketing sprinkled on top. You can also
choose to have it show up as a part of your Wish List so that others can
buy you nifty birthday presents! (More on Wish Lists in Chapter 13.) 
6. Enter your password (twice) in the fields provided.
They want you to have a password so your account is protected. They
want you to enter it twice so that they’re sure you didn’t mistype.
Choosing a good password is an important part of online shopping, not
just at Amazon.com, but anywhere. Check out the Passwords section
later in the chapter for some good tips on how to create yours.

7. Click the Continue button.
You’re done! You’ll be offered the choice to start building your recommen-
dations — giving Amazon.com some information about what you like and
don’t like so they can suggest products — or to continue shopping. Either
way, you’re armed to shop! The next time you visit the site, they’ll recog-
nize you (assuming your cookies are enabled); should you decide to buy,
they ask you to sign in with your e-mail address and your password.
Before you give out even the smallest bit of information, you should be aware
of the privacy policies of the company you’re dealing with. Amazon has a good
history of protecting their customers’ privacy. I cover their privacy policy in
more detail in Chapter 4, but the nutshell version is that they don’t sell infor-
mation and only share it with affiliates and subsidiaries when necessary. You
can access their privacy policy in full from any page on the site. Just scroll to
the bottom of the page and click the Privacy Notice link in the footer.
Passwords
A good password is like a good car. It keeps you safe, it keeps you moving, and
it makes for a good trip. That said, make sure you pick a good password —
something you’ll remember that’s also very difficult for someone else to guess.
Your birthdate, your middle name, your dog’s name . . . not good choices.
Think 007 here. When it comes to passwords, you want to be mysterious.
Here are a few suggestions for better password picking:
 Combine numbers and letters. This is the easiest way to make your
password mysterious.
 Don’t choose anything that can be pulled straight from your driver’s
license.
 Try nonsense. Though it’s more difficult for you to remember if it has no
significance, a nonsensical password is virtually uncrackable! A good
way to create a “nonsense” password is to think of a sentence you’ll
remember — like “I am a supermodel” — then use the first letter of each
of the words: “iaas,” in this case.

Cookies . . . No Milk
Some cookies are yummy. Web cookies are not,
but they can provide some tasty perks when
shopping at Amazon. A cookie is a small file that
lives on your computer’s hard drive. You don’t put
it there yourself. Web sites such as Amazon.com
put cookies on your computer through your
browser. Don’t worry. There’s nothing sinister
about it. They just want to be able to recognize
you and track your shopping history so they can
make your customer experience better.

10-4, good buddy — signing out
Knowing how to sign out is equally as important (and not nearly as intuitive)
as signing in. If you’re shopping at Amazon from an Internet café, a university
computer lab, a public library, or any other place where privacy isn’t a guar-
antee, you need to sign out. Amazon will “time out” on any session after a few
minutes of inactivity, but if you don’t sign out yourself, you’ve just given the
next lucky user a window of opportunity to access your account. For all you
know they’ll buy $1,500 worth of Barney videos and completely destroy your
recommendations (those nifty product suggestions that Amazon makes based
on what you like and don’t like). So sign out! 
1. Point your Web browser to www.amazon.com.
The Amazon.com home page appears.
2. Click the link at the top of the home page that reads, “If you’re not so
and so, click here.” 
3. Choose the No, I Am a New Customer option and click the Sign In
button — no need to enter your e-mail address. 
Voilà! The Amazon.com site is primed for a new customer — which
means you’re signed out! Your personal info is safe and your recommen-
dations will remain Barney-free.
Where’s My Stuff?
Imagine this: You’ve placed an order at Amazon.com and suddenly you realize
that you’re going to be visiting your sister in Texas the week your package is
scheduled to arrive. Or how about this: Your friend has a birthday coming up
and you decide to get him the latest Hootie CD but the birthday is right around
the corner — and the CD isn’t. What do you do? You go to Your Account (see
Figure 3-4). Just click the Your Account button in the Shopping Tools menu
to get there. Within Your Account there’s a section called (fittingly enough)
“Where’s My Stuff?” and the answers to all your order-related questions are in
there.
Here are some of the key things you can do in Where’s My Stuff?:
 View your complete order history
 Track specific orders
 Cancel existing orders
 Change your shipping and billing information
 Combine orders
 Make returns
41
Chapter 3: You Are the Master of Your Account

Tracking packages
If you simply want to find your order and know where it is in the pipeline, all
you have to do is click the Track Packages link in the Where’s My Stuff? sec-
tion of Your Account. When you do, you’re taken to your Open and Recently
Shipped Orders page, which will look something like Figure 3-5.
At first glance you can tell whether the order is open or completed. You can also
view the shipping status and estimated delivery date. If you want more specific

shipping information, click the View or Change Order button by the item
you’re interested in and you’ll be taken to that item’s order summary page.
Ch-ch-ch-changes: Managing your order
Let’s say you want to cancel an order, change the gift message, combine two
orders, or change your shipping information. You can accomplish all those
tasks and more by first going to your Open and Recently Shipped Order page.
Here’s a little secret: Of the twelve links offered in the Where’s My Stuff? sec-
tion of Your Account, eight take you directly to the Open and Recently
Shipped Orders page. The only thing that changes from link to link is the
introductory paragraph. The content of the page stays the same (and so does
what you can do there), regardless of how you get there.
Once you’re there, you simply find the order you want to change and then
click the View or Change Order button to go to that item’s order summary.
The Order summary page is where the real magic happens.
Figure 3-6 is a basic Order Summary page. If you click the appropriate button,
you can do several handy tricks:
 Cancel an order or change quantities
 Change your shipping address
 Change your shipping speed
 Change your gift options
 Change your payment method
 Change your billing address
 Print an invoice
 Use a gift certificate or promotional code
All these activities are relatively self-explanatory, but there are two caveats: 
 You can’t make changes to an order that’s already entered the shipping
process. 
 When you buy from some of Amazon’s smaller partners — like certain
zShops and Marketplace sellers — you have fewer order-management
options. Instead of changes being just a click or two away, you’ll likely
have to deal with that vendor directly. And here’s the tricky part. It’s not
always obvious that you’re buying from a partner. When Amazon culls
search results for you or puts together a subcategory page, it pulls prod-
ucts from all parts of the store to offer the widest selection possible. So
you have to pay attention to the Item Information in the left column of
the item’s detail page to find out whether you’re dealing with a small
partner or with Amazon directly.

Getting Personal
Unlike its brick-and-mortar counterparts, Amazon.com offers special shop-
ping perks to the masses. But instead of having a well-coifed aide to help you
find the ideal item, Amazon makes you your own personal shopper.

Business or pleasure?
Do you make purchases for your job or busi-
ness? Customizable 1-click is great for people
who use a business credit card to make work
purchases. 
Remember, anyone in your address book will
show up in your 1-Click® drop-down menu
(unless you customize it to exclude them).
Remember, too, that you can customize the 
1-Click® settings for any entry in your address
book — so you can assign specific credit cards
to specific entries. 
To use 1-Click® for business, simply create
another entry for yourself in your address book,
but enter your work address in the address
fields. (To get to the New Address Entry page,
just click on the Manage Your Address Book link
in Your Account and then click on the Enter a
New Address button.) Don’t worry, you’re not
changing your official account info. You’re just
creating another entry in your address book. 
Once you’ve got your work self in your address
book, you can customize the 1-Click® settings
for that address. Decide how the entry will
appear in the 1-Click® drop-down menu — I
suggest naming it simply “work” — and cus-
tomize it to use your business credit card. Now
you can save time and separate your profes-
sional from your personal expenses. 

The key to taking advantage of your personal shopping privileges is first,
knowing what perks are to be had, and second, taking a little time up front to
get yourself set up.
Address Books
When you sign up at Amazon.com, you automatically have an Address Book
that lives in Your Account. Of course, it’s empty until you make your first pur-
chase. After that, it’s just you in there — a lonely e-row to hoe. Want a little
company? You have two ways to beef up your Address Book:
 Get gifty: Every time you buy a gift and have it sent to a new address,
Amazon automatically puts that address in your Address Book. 
 Do it the old-fashioned way: There’s nothing stopping you from sitting
down with your paper address book and entering some of your favorite
people into your Amazon Address Book. First, click the Your Account
button at the top of the Amazon home page to go to Your Account, then
click the Manage Your Address Book link and there, right at the top of
the page, you’ll see an Enter a New Address button. From there it’s as
simple as click and type. (You can delete or edit addresses just as easily.)
1-Click® settings
1-Click® ordering is Amazon’s patented technology that allows you to com-
plete the buying process — from choosing to shipping to payment — with
just one click of your mouse. It’s delightful and potentially devilish. 
You’re automatically set up for 1-Click ® ordering after you make your first pur-
chase, assuming you pay with a credit card. Amazon stores your shipping and
billing information as your default 1-Click ® Ordering settings. As soon as you’ve
made a purchase, the detail pages for all your items show blue Ready to Buy?
boxes like the one in Figure 3-7. You’ll notice that the box still includes the Add
To Shopping Cart option. It also includes a gift-wrap check box and a drop-down
menu that will allow you to ship your 1-Click ® orders to anyone in your address
book.
Figure 3-7:
A typical 
1-click

Chapter 3: You Are the Master of Your Account

If you buy gifts at Amazon and have them sent directly to the recipients,
those addresses are stored in both your Address Book and your 1-Click Ship
To: drop-down menu. Then you can buy for those people again with just one
click. Very handy during the holidays!
You can change your 1-Click® settings easily. You manage your 1-Click®
settings and your address book on the same page. (See Figure 3-8.) Here’s
how to turn your 1-Click® settings on or off:
1. Click the Your Account button at the top of the Amazon home page to
go to Your Account.
2. Click the View or Change Your 1-Click Settings link. 
You’ll find this link in the Account Settings section under Personal
Information. (Refer to Figure 3-4 if you need some guidance here.)
3. Turn 1-click on or off.
The box in the upper-right corner, below the nav bar, tells you the status
of your 1-Click® ordering and offers a yellow button to change the status
from “on” to “off” (or vice versa).
You can also customize your 1-click settings according to the addresses in
your Address Book. You can choose:
 Whether to put a particular person in your 1-Click Ship To: drop-down
menu
 How you’d like the entry to appear in the drop-down menu
Figure 3-8:

both your

 What shipping method you’d like to use for that person
 What credit card you’d like to use for that person
To make any of these changes, simply click the Edit button in the 1-Click® set-
tings box to the right of the address you want to customize. You’ll come to a
page that looks like Figure 3-9. Check the appropriate boxes and enter informa-
tion in the fields provided. (If you scroll down, you’ll find the credit-card infor-
mation section.) When you’re finished, click the Continue button. Your changes
will be reflected in your 1-Click® drop-down immediately.
Recommendations
Amazon is always building your recommendations — compiling information
about you and using it to suggest things you’ll like. Every time you buy some-
thing from the folks at Amazon, they store that information and use it to further
refine your recommendations. Amazon has hundreds of nifty ways to connect
you with your dream book, video, sweater, bird house, chain saw, juicer . . .
They know just how to tickle your fancy (and I talk more about how they do it
in Part III). But when you first sign up at Amazon, you have no purchase history
for them to work with. That’s why they created the Recommendation Wizard —
it’s expressly for new shoppers.
The Recommendation Wizard is an amazing tool. You’ll find it at the end of
the sign-up process, or, if you chose the Continue Shopping option when you
signed up, you can access it in Your Store, under Your Recommendations. 
Figure 3-9:
The 
1-Click®

tion page.

Chapter 3: You Are the Master of Your Account

To get to Your Store simply click on the tab that has your name on it — literally.
(Once you sign up, Your Store changes to bear your name — for example, mine
is Mara’s Store.) You’ll find that tab right next to the Welcome tab on just about
every page of the site. You’ll find Your Recommendations in the subnav.
Using the Recommendation Wizard is simple and fun. Here’s how it works:
1. Go to the Recommendations Wizard page.
You can do this by clicking on the Start Recommendations Wizard button
either on the last page in the sign-up process or from Your Store. For the
latter, click on the Your Store tab, then on Your Recommendations in the
subnav. You’ll see the Start Recommendations Wizard button in a blue
box in the center of the page.
2. Check the boxes next to the stores that interest you and then click the
Continue button.
Check as many as you like. As you move through the wizard, you’ll be
asked to give more information for each store that you picked.
3. In the new page that appears, check the categories that interest you
and then click the Continue button.
Figure 3-10 shows the category choice page for the Books store. For
each store you chose in the previous step, you’re offered a separate
page of category choices. If you chose 3 stores in Step 2, you have 3
pages of category choices to work through. When you complete your
last page and click Continue, you come to the Add Details page.
Figure 3-10:
Select your
favorite
categories
by checking
the
appropriate
boxes.
48
Part I: Testing the Waters: Finding Your Way Around the Store

4. In the Add Details page, enter the requested information in the fields
provided and click Continue.
For each store you chose in Step 2, you’re asked to enter one favorite or
Soon To Be Purchased item. So if you chose 3 stores in Step 2, you have
to fill in 2 fields — one for each store. Now it’s time to ask yourself some
serious questions: Who is my favorite author? Which movie in the Star
Wars trilogy is the best? Do I want to buy a juicer or a Dirt Devil?
5. Choose the appropriate number rating for each item, and check the
box if you own the item.
Amazon displays items from each store you’ve chosen based on the
information you give them in Steps 2 through 4. You can give items a
rating from 1 to 5 with 5 as the best. If you’re unfamiliar with an item,
leave it as a question mark. If you own it, check the I Own It box. This
will keep them from offering it to you as a recommendation.
6. Click Rate More Items or Finish.
At the bottom of the page, you have the option to finish or rate more
items. If you click Rate More Items, Amazon will simply offer up another
list. You can rate as many items as you like. Feeling frisky? Rate some
more. It only helps hone your recommendations. Otherwise you’re
through and ready to reap the rewards of your efforts! When you do hit
Finish, you’re taken back to the Your Store home page with your recom-
mendation changes recorded. Amazon generates instant recommenda-
tions based on the information you just gave them.
E-mail notifications: get ’em 
or get rid of ’em
Spam, or unsolicited junk e-mail, stinks. No two ways about it. But getting
informative, relevant e-mail that you asked for is kind of fun. Amazon stays
away from the former and is pretty good at the latter. Table 3-1 lists the e-mail
notifications you can get from Amazon.com and gives a quick look at what
they’re about.

Shopping lists and gift registries 
Making use of Amazon’s lists and registries is a great way to give and get good
gifts. There are three kinds of shopping lists or registries that you can use —
Wish Lists and Baby and Wedding registries — and you can access them (yours
or someone else’s) by clicking the links in the Shopping Lists & Gift Registries
section in Your Account. (I explain how to find specific lists and registries —
and how to set up your own — in Chapter 13.) 
You don’t get those good gifts if your shipping address is wrong. The links to
change or edit your addresses are also in the Shopping Lists & Gift Registries
section in Your Account.
Money Talk: Credit Cards 
and Payment Issues
If you make a purchase at Amazon.com, it’s likely you’ll give them your credit-
card number. Most people who shop at Amazon pay with a credit or check card
because it’s easy and it’s safe. (Check out the sidebar if you need convincing.)
50
Part I: Testing the Waters: Finding Your Way Around the Store

After you’ve given them that first number, it’s easy to change, add, or delete
credit cards. There’s an entire section in Your Account devoted to payment
settings. When you go there, the first link invites you to Edit or delete a
credit card. (See Figure 3-11.) Doing either is as simple as clicking the
appropriate button and then either confirming your desire to delete or enter-
ing new credit-card information.
For those of you who are squeamish about giving out your credit-card infor-
mation, you should know that Amazon has a few other payment options. The
first time you place an order, you can choose to enter only the last 5 digits of
your credit card. Amazon.com will then give you a phone number to call to
enter the rest of the credit card and complete the order. Amazon also accepts
personal checks, money orders, and cashier’s checks. The only hitch is that

“The Amazon.com Safe Shopping Guarantee

that you never have to worry about credit-card

they use the industry-standard Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL) software to encrypt all your infor-
mation, they also cover the cost of any unau-
thorized charges made to your credit card at
Amazon.com. There is one big BUT. The guar-
antee does NOT cover third-party merchants
who process their own credit-card transactions.

they don’t place your order until they receive your personal check, money

kind of defeats the purpose of shopping online. For a complete list of Amazon’s

home page and then click the Payment Methods We Accept link under the

Heeeeeeeeeelp!
In This Chapter
 Taking a close look at the Help department
 Searching for answers to specific questions
 Getting a look at how returns work
 Keeping your information private and secure
W
hen you shop in the physical world, if you have a question, you find
someone that works there and you get personalized answers in real
time (unless you’re me and then, inevitably, you find someone who is clueless
and may as well be from outer space). Not so in the Internet world. With
online shopping, you have to be resourceful and the key to being resourceful
is being very familiar with the Help department.
Every good e-commerce Web site has a Help department; Amazon’s is partic-
ularly good. Most of your questions already have an answer in Amazon’s Help
department. For the ones that don’t, you can e-mail a customer service
person and they’ll help you directly.
In this chapter, I show you how to navigate Help to get answers to the ques-
tions you may have while shopping at Amazon.com.
A Quick Look at What’s in Help 
First things first. You can always get to Help from the Shopping Tools menu
above the main nav bar in the upper-right corner of every page. Or you can
go to the footer at the bottom of every page on the site and click the blue
Help link.
Once you’re there — there being a place that looks very much like Figure 4-1 —
you’ll find a menu of Help options broken out into the following main cate-
gories: Ordering, Gifts & Gift Certificates, Selling at Amazon.com, Digital
Downloads, Using Your Account, Shipping, Returns, Amazon.com Services,
and Privacy & Security. 

Within each one of these main sections you’ll find several subsections and
tons of subsubsections! In other words, the choices listed below the headings
on the main Help page are just a smattering of the options (and answers)
available within each section. In essence, the Help department is a massive
collection of FAQs. If you browse around a little, you’ll likely find the answers
to any questions you may have. 
Let’s say you want to know about the return policies for Land’s End, one of
Amazon’s apparel merchants. Here’s how you can use the Help department to
do that:
1. Click on the Ordering from Amazon Merchants link under the
Ordering main heading. 
You’ll bypass the general Ordering page and go straight to the page on
ordering from merchants. There you’ll find an assortment of links;
among them links to the various product lines that include merchant
merchandise.
2. Click on Apparel & Accessories in the Browse box.
You’ll come to a page that lists (as links) every apparel and accessory
merchant.
Figure 4-1:

54

3. Click on Land’s End.
Now you’ll find yourself on Land’s End’s information page.
4. Click on Returns and Exchanges.
Here’s where you’ll find the information you seek!
When browsing for your answer fails, you can use the Search function. And
when all else fails, you can contact Customer Service. You’ll notice a Contact
Customer Service link and a Search box at the top of the page — the latter
not visible in Figure 4-1, but trust me, it’s there. It makes sense to try to find
your answer among the existing information in Help before you contact
Customer Service. You’ll save them the time they might spend answering a
question already answered on the site, and that’s nice to do. But more impor-
tant, you save yourself time and you get your answer faster.
Searching Help
Searching Help is actually very simple and effective. Here’s how you do it:
1. Enter your keyword in the Search box at the top of the Help page. 
It’s good to be specific, but not so specific that you’re typing in an entire
sentence. Just pick the one or two words that sum up your question.
2. Click the “Go!” button.
You’re transported to a Search Results page that looks like Figure 4-2.
Figure 4-2:

results.
55
Chapter 4: Heeeeeeeeeelp!

3. Surf your search results. 
Each entry has a title and then the beginning of an explanation. Skim the
choices for the one that fits your question.
4. Click a promising title from the Search Results list.
You’re taken to a page that has a full and detailed answer to your
question.
Contacting the Man behind the Curtain
So what happens if you do your homework — you check out the Help links
and use the Search feature — but you don’t find an answer to your question?
That’s when you contact the man behind the curtain. But before you do,
there are few things you should know:
 The folks at Amazon really don’t want you to call them. Amazon’s cus-
tomer service questions are asked and answered via e-mail.
 The folks at Amazon can only read and respond to messages in
English. I’m guessing that if you’re reading this book, that may not be an
issue for you.
 You need to allow at least 24 hours for them to reply. Sometimes
longer, so if it’s urgent, call an Amazon-savvy pal.
Here’s how to send e-mail to Amazon’s customer service department:
1. Click the Contact Customer Service link at the top left of the Help
page. 
You’re taken to a page with a series of links to the following: Order &
Refund Questions, Account Assistance, Typographical Errors, Web site
and Product Suggestions, Gift Orders & Gift Certificates, Prices,
Promotions, & Rebates, Selling Items, and Using Features & Services.
2. Click the link in the menu that best describes what your question is
about. Don’t be alarmed when you’re taken to a page that isn’t an e-mail
question form. They want to make sure that you really checked to see
whether your question has already been answered.
3. Click the link in the bulleted list that begins, I have a question . . .
This will take you to the e-mail form that looks like Figure 4-3.
4. Fill in the requested information and click Continue.
Actually, Amazon automatically fills in your name and e-mail address
(assuming you’re signed in). Just use the drop-down menu to choose a
subject, enter your order number (if it’s relevant), and type your ques-
tion in the Comments field.
56
Part I: Testing the Waters: Finding Your Way Around the Store

5. Review your e-mail for spelling errors and other faux pas.
If you want to make changes, use the Edit button to send you back to
Step 4.
6. If your e-mail passes muster, click the Send E-Mail button. 
Your question gets sent on its merry way to the Customer Service
department.
Important Stuff You May
Need Help With
There’s actually lots of important information in Help, but certain topics —
ordering, shipping, returns, and (not surprisingly) privacy — seem to be the
real hot spots with most Amazon customers.
Amazon has done such a thorough job of putting together their Help depart-
ment that I don’t need to walk you through every possible question. I just help
you get to the right information and point out any potholes along the way.
Ordering
Ordering itself is actually fairly simple (and I walk you through the process in
Chapter 10). The reason I point out this section of the Help department is
because there are some good answers here about what it means to order
from an Amazon merchant or partner.

Chapter 4: Heeeeeeeeeelp!

Go to the Ordering section of the Help page and then click the Ordering from
Amazon Merchants link. The first eight choices in the Browse box will take
you to pages that tell you not only who Amazon’s merchants and partners
are, but a little bit about them and what their policies are. This is stuff you
need to know “just in case.”
Shipping
You can find everything you might ever need to know about shipping in the
Shipping section of the Help department. Particularly helpful are the items
that demystify Super Saver shipping, In-store pickup, and shipping rates.
Returns
As far as I’m concerned, returns are the Achilles’ heel of online shopping. That
said, you can return Amazon purchases, but there are rules to this game — and
you can find them all in the Returns section of the Help department.
Here’s a quick overview of Amazon’s return policy. The nutshell version goes
like this: You can return items that you bought from Amazon (at Amazon is a
different matter and I’ll get to that in a moment) within 30 days of the deliv-
ery date for a full refund, as long as it’s in its original condition with its origi-
nal packaging and accessories, isn’t flammable, has its serial or UPC code,
and isn’t a TV larger than 27 inches. You can get partial refunds for certain
items that don’t meet the above criteria. To find out more about such “par-
tials,” go to the Refunds section in the Help Department — you’ll find it under
the Returns heading.
And here are a few things to watch out for:
 Most Merchants: With the exception of Target and Marshall Field’s,
Amazon merchants have their own returns policies and if you buy from
those merchants at Amazon, you have to abide by their policies. In other
words, returns go to the merchant, not to Amazon.
 Target and Marshall Field’s: If you buy something through Amazon from
either of these partners, you can only return to Amazon.com. You can’t
take your item to a local Target or Marshall Field’s and return it.
 You won’t get the shipping cost back. Unless the return is the result of
an Amazon error, you won’t be reimbursed for shipping charges.
 No exchanges. If you want a different size or color, you’ll have to reorder
the item. Amazon can’t process exchanges.
58
Part I: Testing the Waters: Finding Your Way Around the Store

 Big TVs. If they’re larger than 27 inches, you can’t return them. What they
advise you to do instead is to inspect the TV while the delivery person is
still there — and if it doesn’t work, refuse the delivery. That way you can
get a refund. If you want to return it and the delivery person is gone, you
have to contact the manufacturer directly. (Ick.)
To actually make a return, you go to the Returns Center. You can get there by
clicking the yellow Visit Our Returns Center button on the main Returns page
in Help.
Here’s how to return an item that you bought from Amazon (I’ll explain how
to return something you received as a gift later in the chapter):
1. At the Returns Center, click the circle next to I Ordered the Items and
then click Continue.
The I Ordered the Items option will probably be selected already as it’s the
default. If you’re not already signed in, you’ll be taken to a Sign In screen.
2. Enter your password in the field provided and click the Sign In Using
Our Secure Server button.
You’ll come to a page that lists all the orders eligible for return.
3. Find the order for the item you want to return and click the Return an
Item from This Order button.
You’ll come to a page that looks something like Figure 4-4. (If there was
more than one item in your order, they’ll all be listed here.) Note that
you can also return items that showed up in your shipment that you
didn’t order. (This is for those honest Abes out there.)
Figure 4-4:
Here’s
where you
select the
quantity of
and reason
for your
return.
59
Chapter 4: Heeeeeeeeeelp!

4. Use the Reason drop-down menu to specify why you’re returning the
item. Use the Quantity drop-down menu to specify how many items
you’re returning, and then click the Continue button.
Reasons include things like “I ordered the wrong item,” “I found better
prices elsewhere,” and “Product was defective/damaged when it arrived.”
If the reason for return is not an Amazon error, the shipping costs are
deducted from your refund amount, so make sure you choose the right
option!
5. In the new page that appears, choose your return shipping option and
then click Continue. 
Of these four choices, pick the one that works best for you by clicking
the circle next to it:
• You can use the U.S. Postal Service and print out a label on your
printer (from a page that Amazon generates).
• You can take the package to the post office and write out the label
yourself.
• You can take the package to UPS and use a label that Amazon
generates.
• You can have UPS come to your house.
6. In the new page that appears, follow the instructions for the shipping
option you chose.
The page you get varies according to the shipping option you chose. The
first three choices generate either a shipping label that you can actually
print out and use, or instructions that tell you what to put on a label you
create yourself. Then you just pack up the item you’re returning and send
it off.
If you chose the fourth option (the UPS pickup), you’re finished after you
complete Step 5 in the steps given here; Amazon schedules the pickup for
you. Make sure that this UPS option is really the one you want before you
click; after you click it, it’s a done deal.
Returning gifts is a different process. First of all, in order for you to receive
the refund instead of the giver, the giver had to mark the item as a gift when
they purchased it. If they did, here’s what happens:
 For gifts purchased through your Wish List, they’ll send you a check.
 Otherwise, they’ll mail you an Amazon.com gift certificate.
Either way, they’ll mail your refund to the same address where your order was
shipped. And they won’t notify the gift giver that you returned their present.
60
Part I: Testing the Waters: Finding Your Way Around the Store

If the item wasn’t marked as a gift when purchased or was not shipped directly
to you, they’ll send a refund to the gift giver. In other words, the giver will know
and they’ll get the cash. Darn.
To return a gift, you still have to go to the Returns Center (click the yellow
Visit Our Returns Center button on the main Returns page in Help), but there
the similarity ends. Here’s how to return a gift you received from Amazon.com:
1. At the Returns Center, click the circle next to I Received the Items as a
Gift and then click Continue.
If you’re not already signed in, you’ll be taken to a Sign-In screen.
2. Enter your password in the field provided and click the Sign In Using
Our Secure Server button.
You’ll come to a new page that asks you to enter your order number. To
find your order number, get out the packing slip that arrived with your
order. The order number is just below the bar code.
3. Enter your order number and quantity in the fields provided and
click the Continue button.
Note that multiple quantities of the same item count as one item here. 
4. Enter a description and quantity of the item you’re returning in the
fields provided. Use the drop-down menu to give a reason for your
return and then click Continue.
Note that you can add optional comments here — a good thing to do if you
have an unusual circumstance or a reason not listed in the drop-down.
5. Enter your name, e-mail address, mailing address, and phone number
in the fields provided and click Continue.
6. Choose your shipping label option and click Continue.
You’ll be at a page that looks like Figure 4-5. If you have a printer,
Amazon will generate a print-ready label that you can use. If not, you can
write down the returns address and do it the old fashioned way. 
MYOB! (privacy and security
at Amazon.com)
Privacy and Security make up a category of their own within Help. If you go
there, you’ll find all the information you need to feel safe shopping at Amazon.
61
Chapter 4: Heeeeeeeeeelp!

The Help department lists four key privacy and security policies:
 Privacy Notice: This is Amazon’s privacy policy — the big daddy, chock-
full of legalese. The nutshell version is that they don’t sell information
and only share it with trusted partners, but if you’re concerned, you
should read it in its entirety.
 Safe Shopping Guarantee: This is Amazon’s promise to you that they’ve
made it safe for you to give them your credit-card information online.
 A-to-Z Guarantee Protection: This guarantee protects you from fraud up
to $2,500 when you shop with Marketplace, Auctions, or zShops sellers.
You’ll find much more on this in Amazon’s Help Department. Click on
Ordering from Amazon Merchants under the Ordering heading, and then
click on A-to-Z Guarantee Protection.
 Amazon.com Bill of Rights: This is exactly what it sounds like: a list of
your rights when you shop at Amazon.
Amazon.com will never ask you to give them your credit card number via
e-mail. The only time you’ll give them that information is on their Web site
using their secure server.

Amazon.com

In this part . . . 
A
mazon is the kind of place you can go to look for one
simple purchase, and end up spending half your day
browsing around. There are so many good things to buy,
so much good information, and a host of free features to
take advantage of. The trick is ﬁnding your way around.
In this part, I walk you through the ins and outs of shop-
ping at Amazon.com. I give you a better idea of what they
actually sell there and show you how to use some of the
free services on the site. I also give you a grand tour of
some of the lesser-known parts of the store, including
Auctions, zShops, and the Outlet. This isn’t devoted solely
to the “whats” of Amazon. You also get a look at the essen-
tial “hows” — how to search, how to browse, and how to
buy anything on the site.

T
here is no such thing as “one-stop shopping” in the physical world. I say
this with regret in my heart because there’s nothing I’d like more than to
be able to buy designer jeans and mayonnaise in the same store and save
myself a little time — so convenient! Alas, I can’t. And I’m not fooled by these
giant strip malls cropping up all over the place, either. They may sell clothes,
toys, and electronics around the same parking lot, but that parking lot is the
size of Delaware and you may as well be driving to another town to go from
one end to the other.
Then there’s Amazon.com. Do they sell everything there? Well, no. In fact,
you won’t find mayonnaise of any kind anywhere on their virtual shelves. But
they do sell so many of the things most of us shop for — at different stores in
different places — all on one convenient Web site.
In this chapter, I give you a more detailed picture of what you can buy at
Amazon.com. I walk you through each store and cover some of the unique-to-
Amazon things you can do there. I also show you how to make good use of
the features that make Amazon the best place to do your gift shopping.
The Master List
Amazon.com is made up of a series of stores — mini destinations within the
site that sell a collection of products. Some of these stores are actually part-
ner stores — just online versions of brick-and-mortar destinations like Target
or Marshall Fields. Some stores are thematic and are made up of a subset of
products from one or several different categories. They’re called Specialty

Stores and we’ll get to them in a bit. But the stores that most people think 
of when they think of shopping at Amazon are what I’ll call their category
stores, of which there are currently 19: Apparel & Accessories, Sporting
Goods, Books, DVD, Magazine Subscriptions, Music, Video, Camera & Photo,
Computers, Computer & Video Games, Electronics, Office Products, Software,
Home & Garden, Kitchen & Housewares, Outdoor Living, Toys, Babies, and
Tools & Hardware.
Each store is somewhat unique, but here’s what you find in every
Amazon.com store:
 Editorial Recommendations: You’ll find these in various incarnations
sprinkled throughout the site — on store home pages, in feature “boxes”
on the right side of the page, on subcategory pages, and so on.
 Product Information: The quality of product information varies from
store to store (with newer stores often having a weaker offering), but it’s
there.
 Editorial Reviews: You won’t find them for every item listed, but you
will find hundreds (at the least) in every store.
 Customer Reviews: Again, not necessarily every product gets reviewed,
but lots and lots of customers post reviews in every store.
Check out the next sections for overviews of each individual store.
Apparel & Accessories
The Apparel store is actually a huge collection of merchants selling their
wares together in one place. In other words, Amazon never stocks apparel
and when you buy from this store, you’re buying directly from that apparel
store (Nordstrom, Marshall Fields, and so on) or company (Eddie Bauer,
Guess, and so on).
You can shop the Apparel store by category — Women, Men, Kids & Baby,
Shoes, and Accessories — or by store, and there are more than 100 of those.
One of the great things about the Apparel store is that it’s a good place to find
certain hard-to-find things. Very small sizes, very large sizes; they’re all there.
Sporting Goods
This is Amazon’s new baby. It’s set up like the Apparel store — a collection of
merchants selling products at Amazon — so remember, when you buy from
Sporting Goods you need to be familiar with the policies of the company
you’re actually buying from.
66
Part II: You Want It? They Got It: Shopping and Buying at Amazon.com 

You can shop Sporting Goods by store, just like in the Apparel store. They’ve
got more than 100 sellers offering just about every sporting good you can
envision. You can also shop Sporting Goods by, of course, sport. They’ve got
everything from badminton to boxing, cheerleading to cricket. Alas, they’ve
left out curling. How could they? I mean, how hard would it have been for
them to just stick a few of the brooms from Tools & Hardware in the Sporting
Goods store? What would our Canadian neighbors say?
Books
Books, as Jeff Bezos likes to say, were Amazon’s first, best product. When
Amazon started up, people were already used to buying books via mail order
catalogs or book clubs, so the leap to online ordering wasn’t too great.
Moreover, books came in relatively predictable shapes — making them easy
to ship — and one didn’t necessarily need to try one on before buying. Today,
books are still Amazon’s best selling category and it’s no wonder. Currently,
Amazon offers countless titles in its catalog — every book listed in the
Library of Congress even if it’s no longer in print.
The Books store subcategories include: Arts & Photography, Books on
Cassette and CD, Audio Downloads, Biographies & Memoirs, Business &
Investing, Children’s Books, Christian Books, Computers & Internet, Cooking,
Food & Wine, e-Books, Entertainment, Español, Gay & Lesbian, Health, Mind &
Body, History, Home & Garden, Horror, Literature & Fiction, Mystery &
Thrillers, Nonfiction, Outdoors & Nature, Parenting & Families, Professional &
Technical, Reference, Religion & Spirituality, Romance, Science, Science
Fiction & Fantasy, Sports, Teens, Travel, Women’s Fiction, Foreign Language
Books, New & Used Textbooks, Large-Print Books, and Sheet Music & Scores.
So, if you’re a Francophile-scifi-freak-hockey-playing-aspiring-photographer-
mystery buff, you’re in luck. Also, each subcategory is broken down into even
more specific genres.
The Books store, maybe because it’s the oldest store at Amazon.com, is
incredibly well stocked with hard-to-find goodies. You’ll find tons of audio
books, a decent selection of e-books, and book bargains coming out of your
ears — way more than you’d find in a brick-and-mortar store. 
Music
Amazon sells CDs in its music store. Lots of CDs. But it also sells cassettes,
LPs, Super Audio CDs, and DVD-audio. It tips its hat to the past and to the
future. In fact, you can actually download free MP3s from Amazon’s Music
store — but we’ll get to that in the next section.
Amazon’s music catalog is vast — far bigger than anything you’d find in the
physical world. Subcategories include: Alternative Rock, Blues, Box Sets,
67
Chapter 5: A Closer Look at the Stores

Broadway & Vocalists, Children’s, Christian & Gospel, Classic Rock, Classical,
Instrumental, Country, Dance & DJ, Folk, Free Downloads, Hard Rock & Metal,
Imports, Indie Music, International, Jazz, Latin, Music Accessories, New Age,
Opera & Vocal, Pop, R&B/Soul, Rap & Hip-Hop, Rock, and Soundtracks. The
Music store also has 18 “label stores” that include everything from Blue Note
Records to Disney. 
Of course, there’s no public listening station like in a neighborhood record
store, so you can’t put on the headphones and shimmy to the beat. But
secretly, your friends think you look like you’re having an allergic reaction
when you do that, so it’s just as well that you shimmy in the comfort of your
own home.
Video & DVD
Forgive me, technophiles! I know they’re not the same thing (and they’re also
not the same store), but the video and DVD stores have almost identical sub-
categories. And let’s face it, they’re both things you put in a player and watch
on a screen, so . . . 
These are the subcategories you’ll find in both the video and DVD stores:
Action & Adventure, African American Cinema, Animation, Anime & Manga, Art
House & International, Boxed Sets, Christian Video, Classics, Comedy, Cult
Movies, Disney Home Video, Documentary, Drama, Educational, Fitness & Yoga,
Gay & Lesbian, Hong Kong Action, Horror, Independently Distributed, Kids &
Family, Military & War, Music Video & Concerts, Musicals & Performing Arts,
Mystery & Suspense, Romantic Comedies, Science Fiction & Fantasy, Special
Interests, Sports, Television, and Westerns. And for those of you wondering
what Manga is — no, it’s not a tropical fruit or a friendly chimp who has a show
on TV. It’s a kind of Japanese comic (in this case animated) — very cool.
If you’re a collector, you’ll be happy to find out about Amazon Essentials.
These are superlative lists — things like Essential Suspense Classics, or
Essential Woody Allen. You’ll also find lists of Academy Award winners and
AFI best films. 
Magazine Subscriptions
This is the biggest newsstand you’ve ever been to! You’ll find everything from
the gossip mags that overstuff the grocery checkout to obscure science jour-
nals. You can also subscribe to trade journals and newspapers at Amazon.
Subcategories in the Magazine subscriptions include: Arts & Crafts,
Automotive, Bridal, Business & Finance, Children’s, Computer & Internet,
Electronics & Audio, Entertainment, Family & Parenting, Fashion & Style,
Food & Gourmet, Games & Hobbies, Gay & Lesbian, Health & Fitness, History,
Home & Garden, International, Lifestyle & Cultures, Literary, Men’s Interest,
68
Part II: You Want It? They Got It: Shopping and Buying at Amazon.com 

Music, News & Politics, Newspapers, Pets, Professional & Trade, Religion &
Spirituality, Science & Nature, Spanish-Language, Sports & Leisure, Teens,
Travel & Regional, and Women’s Interest. Guess what the top seller is in
Men’s Interest? Yes. That’s right. Playboy. Guess what it is in Women’s
Interest? Uh huh. You guessed it. Oprah’s magazine. (Okay, fine. They’re
updated daily, but still . . .)
You don’t just have to get new subscriptions here. You can renew your exist-
ing magazine subscription through Amazon.com. Just wait till your current
subscription is coming to an end (two months or so), then place your new
order through Amazon.com. The magazine publishers are smart enough to
tack your new subscription on to your existing one, so it’ll definitely be less
expensive.
Camera and Photo
Amazon’s goal is always to offer the widest, deepest selection possible.
Camera and Photo is no exception. Amazon has also partnered with Ofoto
(which is owned by Kodak) for film and digital photo processing.
Subcategories in Camera and Photo include: Accessories, Binoculars,
Camcorders, Digital Cameras, Film Cameras, Frames & Albums, Microscopes,
Printers & Scanners, Projectors, and Telescopes. Wait a minute! Binoculars?
Telescopes? What kind of Camera and Photo store is this? We’re talking
Peeping Tom heaven here.
Computers
Guess what they sell here? But seriously, they sell a really expansive selec-
tion of computers, plus all the add-ons and peripherals you could ever want.
And happily, they’re not pc-biased. You’ll find a healthy selection of Macs
here too.
You can shop by brand — and there are tons of them, the ones you’ve heard
of and maybe some you haven’t — and by category. Those include:
Accessories and Supplies, Computers (duh), Computer add-ons, Handhelds
and PDAs, Office Electronics, Monitors, Printers and Software. It is a geek
Valhalla. 
Computer and Video Games
The Computer and video games store is organized by game system. You’ll
find the big three — Game Cube, PS2, and Xbox — plus a bunch of older sys-
tems. Subcategories are: Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, GameCube, Mac
Games, Nintendo 64, PC Games, PlayStation, PlayStation2, Sega Dreamcast,
Xbox, and Other Systems.
69
Chapter 5: A Closer Look at the Stores

Electronics
The Electronics store is absolutely huge and even includes three of the other
stores — Camera and Photo, Computer and Video Games, and Software — in
its mix. You can buy everything from a TV to a PDA to a DVD player there.
(High-tech alphabet soup, anyone?) 
This Amazon store has excellent product information. So if you’re in the
market for something, I recommend using the site to do research, even if you
aren’t sure you want to buy there. You’ll also find lots of downloadable prod-
uct manuals in the Electronics store and some very helpful, customer-written
So You’d Like To guides.
Also, Amazon has made a deal with Circuit City: Customers can buy things on
the site and then opt for in-store pickup. It’ll save you money on shipping and
you’ll get your new goody sooner.
The subcategories in the Electronics store are: Accessories & Supplies, Audio &
Video, Camera & Photo, Cell Phones & Service, Computers, Computer &
Video Games, Handhelds & PDAs, Office Electronics, Portable Electronics,
and Software. Notice that Camera & Photo, Computers, Software, Computer &
Video Games are all categories within the Electronics store. So you see,
Electronics is the mother ship . . . the queen bee . . . the mama pajama. 
Office Products
Office Products is an example of what I like to call Amazon’s “team player”
stores. They already offered several of the products in this store through
their Electronics store and then made a deal with Office Depot to fill in the
blanks.
What this arrangement means to you is that when you buy certain products
from Amazon’s Office Products store, you’re actually dealing with Office
Depot. So just make sure you’re familiar with their rules and policies. 
Office Depot is another of the stores with whom Amazon has an in-store
pickup deal. You can order and pay online and then pick up the item around
the corner.
Subcategories include: Business Presentation Supplies, Cleaning &
Maintenance, Computers, Computer Add-Ons, Furniture & Accessories,
Lighting, Lunchroom Supplies, Mailroom Supplies, Office Electronics, Office
Supplies, Safety & First Aid, Software, and Teaching Materials (where, conve-
niently, you can buy both rulers and first aid supplies — yes sir . . . may I
have another?).
70
Part II: You Want It? They Got It: Shopping and Buying at Amazon.com 

Software
You’ll find a little bit of overlap between Software and Computer and Video
Games, but otherwise the Software store is a universe unto itself.
The subcategories are: Business & Office, Children’s Software, Education &
Reference, Graphics, Home & Hobbies, Language & Travel, Linux, Macintosh,
Networking, Operating Systems, PC Games, Personal Finance, Programming,
Software Downloads, Software for Handhelds, Utilities, Video & Music, Virus
Protection, and Web Development. You’ll even find software for your cat
(check out the Part of Tens for more on this), but not enough of it to warrant
its own category.
Those software downloads can be pretty handy. You’ll find everything from
children’s software to applications for your PDA. Is it April 13? Are you still
thinking you’re doing your own taxes? Did you forget to buy the program? No
sweat. You can download it here.
Tools & Hardware
The Tools & Hardware store came into being when a former bigwig at Black
and Decker came to be a bigwig at Amazon and said, “Hey, why not sell tools
online?” Why not, indeed? Amazon partnered with a strangely named but 
well-respected tool-catalog company — Tool Crib of the North — and the
Amazon.com Tools & Hardware store was born. The selection is ten times what
you’d find at a brick-and-mortar store, and now when you’re shopping for your
friend’s baby shower you can also pick up some scaffolding and maybe a
power paint sprayer. Hey, why not give that as a shower gift? They can use it to
paint the nursery and when that’s done they can hook it up to the garden hose
for some great summertime fun! (That’s not true. I made that up.)
Subcategories include: Hand Tools, Job Site Equipment, Lawn & Garden
Tools, Power Tools, and Other Categories (like the Village People’s Greatest
Hits . . . okay, not really).
Home and Garden, Kitchen and Housewares, and Outdoor Living
These three stores have lots of overlap in their offerings (though the Kitchen
store is the most “its own” of the three). You’ll also see some overlap
between Outdoor Living and Tools and Hardware. So why didn’t they just
make one big store and call it, “Inside/Outside Home”? Because one thing
Amazon is really good at is offering up a huge selection of stuff in digestible
chunks. They know that if you’re looking for a shower curtain, you probably
don’t want to wade through a bunch of grills to get there.
71
Chapter 5: A Closer Look at the Stores

The subcategories in Home & Garden are: Bed & Bath, Furniture & Décor,
Kitchen, Housewares, Outdoor Living, Spa & Personal Care, Tools &
Hardware, Vacuums & Floor Care.
The subcategories in Kitchen and Housewares run the gamut from practical
to gracious: Baking, Bar Tools & Glasses, Coffee, Tea & Espresso, Cookbooks,
Cook’s Tools & Gadgets, Cookware, Cutlery, Grills & Fryers, Kitchen Furniture,
Housewares, Small Appliances, Spa & Personal Care, and Tableware. As in the
Electronics store, you’ll find lots of downloadable product manuals here —
good for research and if you lost yours!
The subcategories in Outdoor Living are a pretty civilized take on rough-and-
ready pastimes: Backyard Birding, Camping, Gifts, Grills, Fryers & Outdoor
Cooking, Heating & Lighting, Lawn & Garden Tools, Outdoor Décor, Patio
Furniture, Pest Control, Plants, Seeds & Flowers, and Sports & Lawn Games.
Toys and Games and Baby
Both of these stores are partnerships with the ‘R’ Us stores (that’d be Toys
‘R’ Us and Babies ‘R’ Us). So, again, make sure that when you buy you’re
familiar with their way of doing things.
Subcategories in the toy store are guaranteed to make you feel, well, like a kid
in a toy store: Action Figures, Activities & Learning, Arts & Crafts, Baby Toys,
Bikes, Scooters & More, Building Sets, Blocks & Models, Characters and
Interests, Collectors at Toysrus.com, Dolls, Electronics, Kids ‘R’ Us Room
Décor Store, Games, Preschool, Pretend Play & Dress-Up, Puzzles, Science &
Discovery, Sports & Outdoor Play, Stuffed, Vehicles & Die-Cast, Video Games,
and Winners of Awards.
To make it appropriate for kids, only the more family-friendly games are
offered in Toys & Games. You’ll find the full selection in the Computer and
Video Games store. You’ll also find used games there, but not in the Toy
store.
In the Baby store, play takes a backseat to the practical: Gear, Nursery,
Feeding, Activity, Health & Safety, Bath & Potty, and Toys. I keep hoping
they’ll add a Pregnant Lady category where they’ll sell things like gallon tubs
of ice cream and husbands who do whatever you tell them to do.
Special Features
There are so many things you can do at Amazon that make shopping better.
Some of them aren’t even shopping! The trick is peeling the onion until you
hit that special feature that’ll make your shopping day.
72
Part II: You Want It? They Got It: Shopping and Buying at Amazon.com 

These are a few of my favorites, but they aren’t the only special features
you’ll find. There are enough cool things happening at Amazon to fill several
tomes. As you explore the site, you’ll discover your own favorites. In the
meantime, give these a try.
Free Downloads
Downloading music from the Web has gotten some people into trouble. Not
at Amazon.com. Here you can download the day away. Free Downloads is
packed with electronic files (MP3 and Windows Media) that you can down-
load to your computer’s hard drive and play — either on a free player (that
you can also download off the Internet) or on your own MP3 player (which
you can buy at Amazon if need be).
Free Downloads is Amazon’s way of letting you sample the merchandise.
There are literally hundreds of songs just waiting for you to lay your ears on
them, and don’t worry, this isn’t a mini-Napster here. Artists and labels volun-
tarily put their music up on Amazon’s site to invite you to get hooked and
buy the CD.
You’ll find the Free Downloads section by clicking on it in the subnav of the
Music store. It’s set up like a mini-music store. You’ll find a Browse box filled
with genres, editorial content, Top Downloads — everything you’d expect to
find in a music store. The big difference is that the music here is free!
Amazon’s free downloads come in two file formats: MP3 and Windows Media.
But there’s one glitch: They used to come in Liquid Audio format too, but
Liquid Audio is no longer creating free players. (This wouldn’t be much of a
glitch except for the links in the Free Downloads section that still encourage
you to get a Liquid player — and take you to a very nice Dear John letter on
Liquid’s site. If you’re not a fan of wild goose chases, avoid the Liquid Audio
links and you should be fine.
If you can hear sound on your computer when you’re using the Internet, then
you shouldn’t have any problem with MP3s or Windows Media. What you do
need, though, is a player so you can listen to the music after you’ve down-
loaded it. Here’s the good news: An entire page in Free Downloads is devoted
to helping users get players. To get there, follow these steps:
1. Go to the Free Downloads section of the Music store.
You’ll find it by clicking Free Downloads in the Music store subnav.
2. With the Free Downloads page loaded on your screen, scroll down
until you see the Help with Downloads box on the left-hand side.

3. Click on the Download a Free MP3 Player link.
You’ll come to the Media Player Download Instructions page, where
you’ll find links for downloading the RealOne Player and the Windows
Media player for both Macs and PCs. (You’ll also find Liquid Audio play-
ers offered, but remember, these are no longer available.) Click on the
link for the player that you want and you’ll be walked through the down-
load process. If you’re uncertain about which one to download, take
advantage of the information provided on this page (below the links to
the players).
When you’re set up with a player, you’re ready to start trying out the music.
To download tracks, do the following:
1. Sign in to access your Amazon.com account. 
If you don’t already have an Amazon.com account, now is the time to set
one up; you can’t download songs unless you’re signed in to their site,
and you can’t sign in if you don’t have an account. (Need help with sign-
ing in? See Chapter 4.)
2. Go to the Free Downloads section of the Music store. 
Again, you’ll find it by clicking the Free Downloads tab in the Music store
subnav.
3. Find a song and go to its detail page.
This is the fun part. You can browse for free downloads just like you
would for anything else at Amazon.com — poke around until you see
something that tickles your fancy. Or, if you know the song’s title, use
the Free Downloads search box and see if it’s available. 
Keep in mind that you may not find it. Though it’s a well-stocked part of
the site, you won’t find everything there. If you could, they’d have a hard
time making people pay for those CDs. When you’ve found a song you
want, go to that song’s detail page. (All downloading happens from the
detail page.)
4. Click the Download Song now button. 
You’ll find it next to the image of a CD. 
Downloading music to your hard drive is just like saving anything else to
your hard drive. You’ll need to decide where to put it, what to call it, and so
on. So create a music folder for yourself and prepare to rock!
Essentials
Finding new music can be scary. Have you ever thought to yourself, “I want to
get into jazz; I’m going to go to the record store and buy a jazz CD!”? Did you
74
Part II: You Want It? They Got It: Shopping and Buying at Amazon.com 

then walk over to the record store and stand in front of thousands of jazz CDs,
feeling totally overwhelmed? Scary. 
You needed Essentials — another feature in the Music store. It’s a compilation
representing the work of Amazon’s expert music editors who’ve put together
hundreds of must-have lists for everything from rock to baroque music.
Like Free Downloads, you can get to Essentials by clicking on it in the Music
subnav. Once you’re there, you’re on your way to new music heaven. You can
browse Essentials by artist, composer, style — you’ll even find Essentials by
Year. Each Essentials list is accompanied by a brief history of that genre. (See
Figure 5-1 for the Bebop Essentials page.) Clicking either the Classical or Jazz
link under the Get Started In heading takes you to more detailed introduc-
tions to these two genres of music that include an “audio tour” — very cool.
Look Inside
For so long, customers said that the reason they’d choose a physical book-
store over Amazon is because they wanted to be able to leaf through the
books before they bought. Look Inside eliminated the obstacle.
Look Inside allows you to view pages in the book you’re considering. You
won’t find this feature on every book, but you will find it on many, and often
on bestsellers. You’ll know that a book has Look Inside if there’s a little fellow
peeking over the top edge of the book’s image on the detail page. To use the
feature, just click on the little fellow.
Figure 5-1:
Essentials
gives a brief
history of
the genre
followed by
a list of
“must-
have” CDs. 
75
Chapter 5: A Closer Look at the Stores

The Look Inside pages look like Figure 5-2. You’ll usually be given access to an
introduction, table of contents, excerpt, and index (if there is one). To get
around, use the yellow arrows on either side of the book, or the Previous Page
and Next Page links at the top of the page. To see thumbnails of all the avail-
able pages, click on the See All Sample Pages link at the top center of the page.
Search Inside the Book
This new feature is Look Inside’s sassy little sister. It’s a feature that let’s you
search the actual text of more than 120,000 books on Amazon’s site. That’s
more than 33 million pages of text, thank you very much.
You don’t have to do anything special to use Search Inside, just perform key-
word searches like you always do. If there’s a relevant match with Search
Inside, a link to an excerpt will show up in your search results at the bottom
of each entry. 
A few things you should know:
 You can’t read the entire book online. Sorry Charlie. First of all, Search
Inside only shows the pages with your search term on them. Second of
all, once you access a particular page, you can browse forward or back
two pages. That’s it.
 You can perform a search solely on the text of that book. Once you
find a book that has Search Inside, you can go to its Search Inside area
and do a search for a different term just within the book’s text.
 You have to have an Amazon account, including credit card, to use
the feature. When you click the excerpt link from your search results,
you’ll be asked to sign in. If you don’t have an account, you’ll be asked
to set one up. Amazon, in their FAQ for the feature, explains this as a
means of protecting the publishers who participate in the program. 
Preordering new releases
No more standing in line waiting for store doors to open. No more clobbering
fellow shoppers with your handbag to get the last of the latest Harry Potter
books. (Oh wait, that wasn’t you. It was me. Oops!) Amazon Preordering has
civilized the shopping world.
76
Part II: You Want It? They Got It: Shopping and Buying at Amazon.com 

There’s no secret magic to preordering at Amazon — as a feature it blends
right in. A few months before a book is due to release, it will show up on the
site. If you go to its detail page, you’ll notice that instead of it saying “buy
now” in the buy box, it’ll say, “preorder now” You put it in your shopping cart
or use 1-Click as usual and when the book is released, they’ll ship you one.
If you’re one of those people who have to have it on the day it’s released,
don’t use this feature. Remember, they have to get it from their warehouse
and then ship it to you, which takes a few days.
Specialty Stores
Are you mad about Monty Python? Batty for Barbie? Gaga for George Foreman?
Then Specialty Stores are for you.
Specialty Stores are smaller, thematic stores with merchandise culled from
Amazon’s existing catalog. Some are just subsets within a category store — like
the Black and Decker store in Tools and Hardware — and some are cross prod-
uct, like the Disney store. There are close to 200 Specialty Stores at Amazon —
too many to list here — but there is surely one that matches your interests.
To get to the Specialty Store directory, go to the main store directory page
(by clicking on the See More Stores link at the top of the page next to the
tabs). Then click on the link in the box that looks like Figure 5-3.

Got Gift? The Amazon Gifts Store
You don’t need to go to the Gifts Store to give a gift from Amazon.com. There
are no products there that you can’t find in another part of the store. But if
you need some help, you’ll be glad the Gifts Store is there.
The main purpose of the Gifts Store is to help those people who don’t always
get just the right thing. Maybe you don’t know much about the giftee except
that he’s two years old. Maybe you have no idea what to get someone as a
housewarming gift. Maybe you’re on a tight budget but don’t want to look like
a tightwad. The Gifts Store lets you browse for gifts by occasion, price, and
recipient. You’ll also find easy access to registries, wish lists, and other gift
services there. For a more detailed look at gift giving Amazon style, check out
Chapter 13.
How to send free e-cards 
Amazon.com has a free e-card for every occasion. And I mean every occasion.
I know, because for a few months, I wrote them. 
You can get to the E-Cards page from the Gifts Store subnav — just click the
Free E-Cards tab — or from the main store directory (and you can get there
by clicking the See More Stores link at the top of the page next to the tabs).
Once you’re there, you’ll find a feast of electronic greetings for everything
from Wiccan holidays to new babies. Some are animated, some are click-
through cards, and some are stills.
Figure 5-3:

78
Part II: You Want It? They Got It: Shopping and Buying at Amazon.com 

Here’s how to send one:
1. On the E-Cards page, browse the categories or use the search function
to find an e-card you like.
You can click on the thumbnails to view the complete card
2. Click the Send This Ecard button. 
You’ll be taken to that card’s page, which features a bigger view of the
card and the option to send with or without a gift certificate (more on
the latter in the next section).
3. Click the new Send this Ecard button.
That’s right. You click this button on the card’s main page too. The next
page is a form where you’ll “fill out” your card.
4. Enter the information requested in the fields provided and then click
Continue.
Enter all your message information, including the recipient’s e-mail
address; choose whether to add music and pick your appearance and
delivery options. The next page is a preview of your card.
5. Preview your e-card and click Send Now. 
Make sure the card looks the way you want it to. If it doesn’t, click the
Edit button and make the necessary changes.
Gift certificates
For the longest time I thought that gift certificates were terrible. “They’ll
know how much I spent!” I thought. And then I got a gift certificate, and I was
thrilled. “You mean I get to go out and buy my own birthday present . . . with
your money?” Delightful!
Amazon has three kinds of gift certificates: paper, e-mail, and e-card. Sending
them is a piece of cake (and they go well with birthday cake too).
Sending paper gift certificates
Paper gift certificates are not dead. Some people like to send tangible things —
and other people like to get them. Here’s how to send a paper gift certificate:
1. Make your way to the Gift Certificates page by clicking the See More
Stores link on the Amazon home page, clicking the Gift Certificates
link under the Gifts & Registries heading, and then clicking the yellow
Order Gift Certificates button under the Friends and Family option.
The Gift Certificates Samples page appears, showing samples of e-mail,
e-card, and paper gift certificates.
79
Chapter 5: A Closer Look at the Stores

2. Click the yellow Order Paper Gift Certificates button.
A new page appears, outlining the Amazon.com Safe Shopping
Guarantee and providing you with a link to Amazon’s secure server.
3. Click the Click Here to Continue Your Order on Our Secure Server link.
You’ll come to a page that is both a Sign In screen and a gift
certificate form.
4. Enter your gift certificate information in the fields provided.
The “from,” “to,” and “message” are optional. The amount and the quan-
tity are not. Note that you have to send an amount no less than $5 and
no more than $5,000.
5. Enter your e-mail address and password in the fields provided and
click Continue.
You do this on the same screen, below the gift certificate info. The next
page will ask you to either select a shipping address from the list of
addresses associated with your account, or enter a new shipping address.
6. Choose your shipping address by clicking the appropriate Use this
Address button or click Enter a New Address.
If you choose the latter, you’ll add one step to the process — that of
entering the new address. Just enter the info in the fields provided and
click Continue. You’ll be taken to the credit-card info page.
7. Enter your credit-card information in the fields provided and then
click Continue.
You’ll be taken to an order confirmation page. 
8. Confirm your order and then click the Place Your Order button.
Even though it’s a paper gift certificate, you’ll receive your confirmation
via e-mail.
Sending e-mail gift certificates
Here’s how to send an e-mail gift certificate:
1. Make your way to the Gift Certificates page by clicking the See More
Stores link on the Amazon home page, clicking the Gift Certificates
link under the Gifts & Registries heading, and then clicking the yellow
Order Gift Certificates button under the Friends and Family option.
The Gift Certificates Samples page appears, showing samples of e-mail,
e-card, and paper gift certificates
2. Click the yellow Order E-Mail Gift Certificates button.
A new page appears, outlining the Amazon.com Safe Shopping
Guarantee and providing you with a link to Amazon’s secure server.
80
Part II: You Want It? They Got It: Shopping and Buying at Amazon.com 

3. Click the Click Here to Continue Your Order on Our Secure Server
link.
You’ll come to a page that looks like Figure 5-4.
4. Enter the critical information in the fields provided.
You don’t have to enter anything in the To or From fields or even add a
message, but you do have to tell them how much (minimum is $5, maxi-
mum is $5,000), how many certificates you want to send (because you
can send more than one at a time as long as they’re all for the same
amount), and the e-mail address of the person or people you’re sending
it to. 
5. Sign in by entering your e-mail address and your password in the
spaces provided at the bottom of the page and then click the Continue
button.
You’ll come to a page that asks you to enter your credit-card informa-
tion. Even if you’ve already bought with Amazon, you’ll have to reenter
your credit-card information here.
6. Enter your credit-card information in the fields provided and then
click Continue.
You’ll be taken to an order confirmation page. Check it carefully to make
sure everything is as you want it.
7. Confirm your order and then click the Place Your Order button.

Sending e-cards with a gift certificate attached
This is a good way to make the gift certificate even more personal. Here’s
how to do it:
1. On the E-Cards page, browse the categories or use the search function
to find an e-card you like.
You can click on the thumbnails to view the complete card
2. Click Send This Ecard. 
You’ll be taken to that card’s page. (See Figure 5-5.)
3. Click the Send with a Gift Certificate button.
The next page is a form where you’ll “fill out” your card.
4. Enter the information requested in the fields provided and then click
Continue.
Enter all your message information, including the recipient’s e-mail
address; choose whether to add music, and pick your appearance and
delivery options. For the gift certificate section, you must enter an
amount between $5 and $5,000. When you click Continue, you’ll be taken
to a preview of your card.
The gift certificate option will be checked “Yes” as a default, but if you
change your mind, you can just check “No” and send the e-card sans
cash. 
Figure 5-5:
You can
choose to
send with or

5. Preview your e-card and click Continue. 
Make sure the card looks the way you want it to. If it doesn’t, click the
Edit button and make the necessary changes. Next you’ll come to a sign-
in screen.
6. Enter your e-mail address and your password in the spaces provided
and then click the Continue button.
You’ll come to a page that asks you to enter your credit-card informa-
tion. Even if you’ve already bought with Amazon, you’ll have to reenter
your credit-card information here.
7. Enter your credit-card information in the fields provided and then
click Continue.
You’ll be taken to an order confirmation page. 
8. Confirm your order and then click the Place Your Order button.
That’s it!
It’s a wrap!
Gifts are more fun when they’re wrapped up in fancy paper. When you buy a
gift at Amazon, you have the option to have it wrapped; just check the Add Gift
Wrap box in the Ready to Buy? box. But it’s not free. In fact, here’s how much it
costs:
 $2.99 per CD
 $3.49 per small item
 $4.49 per medium item 
 $4.99 per large item
If you choose to have it wrapped, your gift will be swaddled up nicely in
silver paper with white swirls, with a white grosgrain ribbon and a matching
silver gift card (that bears your gift message) — very elegant. If you don’t
want wrapping, your gift will be, for all intents and purposes, nude — in the
box, with a packing slip that bears your gift message. (There’s nothing wrong
with that, it’s just not as festive.)

I
t’s time to put on your Magellan hat, because there’s an entire crop of good
stuff to be discovered at Amazon that you probably don’t know anything
about. This stuff I speak of isn’t really shopping and it isn’t really selling. It’s
services, and they’ve got a whole slew of them. Most are free, some aren’t —
and they are, for the most part, undiscovered.
But I don’t want to mislead you. We’re not talking shoeshines or estate plan-
ning here. The services you’ll find at Amazon are definitely shopping related.
In fact, if you join the seven other people who know about them, I think you’ll
find that Amazon’s services make your shopping even better.
In this chapter, I guide you through a generous handful of the services you
can find at Amazon. I tell you what they are, what they’re good for, and how
to actually use them.
Get the 411 in Real Time: Amazon Chat
I love to chat. In grade school I got very good marks for school work and very
bad marks for classroom behavior — too much talking in class (and also
chewing the occasional forbidden chunk of Hubba Bubba). So it pleases me
that I’m never more than three or four clicks away from a good discussion.

Amazon Chat could be a great service, and not just for chatty Cathys like me.
It’s easy to use, it’s free, and it’s a natural fit for getting feedback on products
you’re considering from people who’ve actually used them. The truth is,
though, Amazon.com Chat is relatively unpopulated. So you won’t find
people in every chat room at any given time. Another good place to chat is
at groups.google.com. (You don’t have to type the “www” but if you do it’s
okay — it’ll take you to the same place.)
That said, it’s always worth a shot. Right now, Amazon has about 50 different
chat rooms spread out over 7 categories: books, DVD, electronics, cameras,
PC & video games, music, and toys. Chatting itself is actually pretty simple.
You need to be the proud owner of an Amazon.com account — e-mail and
password — and you need to be 13 years of age or older. If you’re both, you
can chat. Here’s how:
1. Click the See More Stores link at the top right of the page.
The link is right above the main nav; clicking it takes you straight to the
store directory.
2. Under the Services heading, click the Chat link.
You’ll come to the main Amazon.com Chat page.
3. From the Browse Amazon.com Chat box on the left, click the name of
the chat room that interests you.
You’ve got nearly 50 to choose from! When you choose one, a dialog box
will pop up and ask you to confirm that you’ve read the user agreement
and that you’re over the age of 13.
4. Check the Terms and Conditions/Age Verification box and then click
Continue.
You should actually read the agreement or at least scan it. To do that,
click the Terms and Conditions link in the dialog box. After you click
Continue, you’ll come to a window that looks like Figure 6-1. The square
at the top left is where you can view the chatting and read other
people’s comments. The square next to it on the right shows you who’s
in the room; the field just below those two squares is where you enter
your comments.
5. Type in your first bit of chat in the field provided and then click Send.
You’ll see your text appear in the top left window along with other chat-
ters. That’s it! You’re chatting.
You can use the Block and Whisper buttons to customize your chatting expe-
rience. If there’s a nimrod in the chat room and you don’t want to see their
comments, you can block them by clicking on their name in the In the Room
window and then clicking the Block button. If you change your mind about
86
Part II: You Want It? They Got It: Shopping and Buying at Amazon.com 

them, simply unblock. You can also whisper (that is, only talk to certain
people in the chat room). To do that, click on the names of the people you
don’t want to talk to (in the In the Room window) and then click the Whisper
button. Your chat will only show up in the windows of the people you didn’t
choose. The others won’t see your input until you “unwhisper” them.
Chatting in a chat room is not exactly like chatting in your living room for two
main reasons. One, you have to type. Two, you don’t know these people. So
here are a few good rough-and-ready rules to follow for any online chatting
(and Amazon chat is no exception).
 Never give out your personal information in a chat room! You are
chatting with strangers to get info and maybe pass a little time. Amazon
does not closely monitor these chat rooms and there is no reason —
ever — for you to have to give anyone your real name, credit-card info,
e-mail address, and so on. So don’t do it!
 Be Polite. Just because you’re sitting in your jammies, eating chocolate
chips straight from the bag, enjoying your relative anonymity, doesn’t
mean you should abuse it. No bad language. No rudeness. Be nice in the
chat room. Even if someone else isn’t.
 Don’t type in all caps. BECAUSE THAT’S THE INTERNET EQUIVALENT
OF SHOUTING. So check to make sure that your “caps lock” button isn’t
on. Otherwise people will think you’re a newbie, or a jerk.
Figure 6-1:
Chat rooms
are a great
place to get
the goods
on the
goods you
want.
87
Chapter 6: Services at Amazon.com

 Don’t lie. Especially in an Amazon chat room, because people are gen-
uinely there to get solid information. Electronic communication is often
a breeding ground for little misrepresentations. (Hey! You said, “6’2”
with rugged good looks . . . ”) I am all for exploring your inner fantasy
life, but not in the Amazon chat rooms. Keep it honest and keep your
karma clean.
Setting Up Corporate Accounts
Hey big spenders! Spend a little time setting up a corporate account. Actually,
corporate accounts at Amazon aren’t necessarily for big spenders. They’re for
companies or organizations that buy from Amazon on a regular basis. So why
would someone want a corporate account instead of just using a credit card?
Here are the three reasons Amazon gives (and I think they’re good ones):
 You can pay by purchase order. Or rather, your employees can pay by
purchase order. This will spare them (and your accounting department)
the hassle of using a personal credit card and getting reimbursed. It’s
also a good way for your company to keep track of purchases made by
employees — it puts all the info in one central location.
 You can get a line of credit. That way you get a monthly bill from
Amazon. Why is this good? Lots of reasons, I’m sure, but the one that
comes to mind is that you get to hold on to your money longer.
 You can add additional purchasers to your account. So you’re not
always the one stuck doing the shopping, for crying out loud.
 You can track purchase history across your organization. Why is Frank
in accounting spending hundreds of dollars a month on self-help books?
Without a corporate account you would never have known.
Setting up a corporate account is easy. Here’s how to do it:
1. Under the Services heading, click the Corporate Accounts link from
the store directory. 
The Corporate Accounts at Amazon.com page appears, ready to do your
bidding.
You can get to the store directory by clicking the See More Stores link at
the top right of the page, right above the main nav.
2. Click the yellow Open a Corporate Account button in the box in the
left column.
You’ll come to a sign-in screen.
88
Part II: You Want It? They Got It: Shopping and Buying at Amazon.com 

3. Enter your email address and password in the fields provided and
click Continue.
You’ll come to the Account info page. Notice that at the top of the page
there are four icons telling you where you are in the process.
4. Enter your contact information, your company information, and a
name for your account. Then click Continue.
The next page you come to will ask you to enter the shipping address
associated with the account. You’ll have the option to use the shipping
address you entered on the last screen or enter a new address.
5. Click the yellow Use This Shipping Address button or enter a new
shipping address and click Continue.
You’ll come to a review screen. Make sure that all your information is
correct. If not, use the Edit buttons to go back to the previous screens to
make changes.
6. Click Continue.
You’ll come to the Payment Method screen.
7. Choose a payment method.
You have two choices here. You can apply for a line of credit — to do
that you simply fill out a form that will look like Figure 6-2. Or you can
enter a credit-card number. If you choose the credit-card option, you’ll
enter your credit-card information as if you were setting up a personal
Amazon account. 
Figure 6-2:
Enter your
information
to apply for
a line of
credit.
89
Chapter 6: Services at Amazon.com

To qualify for a line of credit, you must have a tax identification number. Also,
you don’t have to apply for a line of credit immediately. You can set up your cor-
porate account with a credit card and apply for the line of credit at any time.
At the Movies in Your Neck of the Woods
Movie Showtimes is a service so filled with goodness, I hardly know where to
begin. First off, let me say that if you’re a movie buff and you hold on to the
Sunday paper in case you want to see a movie during the week . . . don’t. You
can get movie showtimes in a few seconds at Amazon — for free, of course.
Here’s how:
1. Under the Services heading, click Movie Showtimes in the store
directory.
The Movie Showtimes page appears in all its cinematic glory.
You can get to the store directory, you know, by clicking the See More
Stores link on any page of the site.
2. Enter your zip code in the field provided and click Submit.
You’ll see the Zip Code field at the top center of the Movie Showtimes
home page.
That’s it! You’ll get a search-results-style list with theaters and showtimes in
your area. It’s so simple and so wonderful. But it’s just the tip of the Movie
Showtimes iceberg (Titanic reference! Titanic reference!). Here are some other
things you can do from the Movie Showtimes home page:
 Read Reviews. Click the Now Playing link and you’ll find your way to
hundreds of both editor and customer reviews for movies that are in the
theaters now.
 Get a Sneak Preview. A complete listing of soon-to-be-released movies
is waiting in the Coming Soon box on the lower-right side of the screen. 
 Watch Trailers. That’s right. Movie trailers right on your computer. The
selection of trailers you find in the Featured Trailers section isn’t nearly
as broad as the selection in Coming Soon or Now Playing, but it’s still
cool. 
 Sign up to get movie show times e-mailed to you. Just sign in and enter
your ZIP code in the box at the upper right of the Movie Showtimes
home page and you get an e-mail each Friday with local show times.

And a Bite to Eat
The Restaurant section at Amazon is relatively new and growing. Right now, it
covers Boston, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Washington D.C., and Seattle. 
What you find in the Restaurant section are restaurant vitals (address, phone
number, and price range), menus, and customer reviews. What you don’t find
are editorial reviews. In other words, this section is entirely built by customers.
It’s not a mini-Frommers.
Finding restaurants
You find restaurants the same way you find anything else at Amazon.com.
You search for them. Use the Restaurant Search box at the top-left column on
the Restaurant home page to find the restaurant you’re looking for. A few
things to note:
 You can use the drop-down menu to search specific cities. The drop-
down includes all six covered cities as well as an All Cities options and
the ubiquitous All Products.
 You can search by restaurant name or menu item. So if you’re craving
Chicken Cordon Bleu and you’re in Boston for the weekend, you can find
the best pace to get it. One thing to note: Be as specific as you can when
searching by dish. I entered “fried chicken” in Seattle and got more than
550 results. That’s a lot of chicken.
 You can’t search for restaurants by type. Per se. If you enter “Mexican”
in a keyword search you’ll get lots of Mexican restaurants, but you’ll also
get any restaurant that has a dish with the word “Mexican” in it.
How to submit a menu
When I said that customers built the Restaurant section, I meant it. You, too,
can contribute to the site by submitting a menu. Here’s how:
1. Go to the Restaurants home page.
You’ll come to the menu submission page.
2. Enter the restaurant information in the fields provided and then click
the yellow Submit Menu button. 
You have to enter the name and choose a city. Optional information
includes address, phone number, type of cuisine, and corporate/chain
information.

Chapter 6: Services at Amazon.com

3. Mail Amazon a hard copy of the menu.
Amazon does not trust us to upload images to the restaurant section,
and I think that’s a good thing. So what you have to do is get a hard copy
of the menu (in color and in good condition is a good idea) and send it
to: Amazon.com Restaurant Service, 1200 12th Avenue South, Suite 1200,
Seattle, WA 98144.
Travel Services
Amazon’s Travel Services section is really a combination of partnerships and
repurposed content. They’ve made it convenient for you to plan your trip
from soup to nuts by offering up their own travel-related products along with
the services of Hotwire and the Vacation store. So when I talk about services
that aren’t free, I need to offer a little clarification: The easy access to part-
ners is the service Amazon is providing — and that’s actually free. The travel
you book with either Hotwire or The Vacation store, is, however, not free. But
you knew that.
Cruising with the Vacation Store
The Vacation Store specializes in cruises, but it also offers vacation packages.
You’ll find everything there from a three-day jaunt to Mexico to a three-week
cruise from Vancouver through the Panama Canal.
To access the Vacation Store, click on Travel in the store directory (you can
get there by clicking the See More Stores link at the top of each page). Once
at the Travel home page, you can either click on the Vacation Store link in the
Browse box or click on the Vacation Store logo in the center of the page.
The Vacation Store is convenient and easy to use, but remember that it’s not
actually Amazon.com. It’s what Amazon calls a “trusted partner,” but it’s still
a separate company. So if you’re going to buy a trip with them, make sure you
clearly understand their rules, regulations, and policies.
What’s Hotwire?
Hotwire is also one of Amazon’s trusted partners. It’s a full-service travel site
where you can do everything from book hotels to buy plane tickets. Possibly
the best thing about Hotwire is that it’s focused on low prices.
You can access Hotwire by clicking on Travel in the store directory. Like the
Vacation Store, Hotwire has a link in the Browse box and a logo in the center
of the page.

Part II: You Want It? They Got It: Shopping and Buying at Amazon.com 

Hotwire is both a broad and deep site. Using it comfortably may take some
practice, but if you can navigate Amazon, you can get around Hotwire.
Here are a few things that you need to know:
 You can’t change your mind! Hotwire offers discounted travel — rental
cars, airline tickets, hotel rooms, and so on. Once you buy, however, it’s
yours. No returns, refunds, or changes are allowed.
 Use the “Hot-Fare Finder.” This is the box that’s front-and-center on the
home page (refer to Figure 6-3). It allows you to search all the major cat-
egories, and even some combinations, directly from the home page.
 Use Customer Care. Like Amazon, Hotwire has a very thorough help sec-
tion. You’ll see the link to “Customer Care” at the top right of every page
on the site. Use it when you need help. 
Shopping by Catalog Online
Shopping by catalog may seem a bit old fashioned, but Amazon gives you
access to online catalogs — and this free service isn’t listed under Services
on their Web site. A few (somewhat obscure) product lines are among those
that Amazon doesn’t stock or ship themselves, but they wanted to offer those
to their customers anyway. Their solution was to post popular catalogs for
those products on their site and give consumers the information they’d need
to order directly from those companies.
Figure 6-3:
The Hotwire
home page.
93
Chapter 6: Services at Amazon.com

The areas in which Amazon offers catalogs are: Industrial Supplies, Medical
Supplies, Scientific Supplies, Arts & Hobbies, Car Parts & Accessories, and
Pet Toys & Supplies. Here’s what you find in those areas of the store:
 Lots of catalogs. Each of the six sections offers a slew of catalogs. If
you’re not familiar with any of them, you might check out Most Popular
in the subnav.
 Complete digital versions. You’ll be able to go through each catalog
page by page.
 Customer reviews. There are reviews of the catalogs themselves, not
products within the catalogs.
 Cataloger telephone numbers. You’ll find this in a box at the top right of
the individual catalog page, below the subnav.
Here are a few things to keep in mind when using this service:
 You’re not ordering from Amazon.com. You’re ordering directly from
that specific cataloger. So make sure you get to know their policies
before you buy.
 You won’t be able to pay using your Amazon account.
 You won’t be able to track your order status on Amazon’s site. Because
you’re placing an order with the cataloger directly, Amazon will have no
record of your transaction.

Chapter 7
The Strange, the Special, 
and the Super Cheap
In This Chapter
 Exploring Auctions and zShops
 Getting the lowdown on Amazon Outlet
 Making the most of Specialty Stores
E
verybody (even my mom) knows that Amazon sells books. Lots of
people know that Amazon sells music and videos. Some people know
they’re selling things like toys and electronics. And these are just their big
category stores! Hardly anyone knows that Amazon has Auctions or an
Outlet. Ask some guy on the street what a zShop is and he’ll likely mutter
something about vintage Datsuns. And Specialty Stores — there are 205 of
them. 205.
These are the best-kept secrets of Amazon.com, the unsung heroes of shop-
ping. They’re where you can find truly strange — and often very cheap —
stuff. But these shops are also trickier waters to navigate, and they raise a
bounty of good questions: Who owns zShops and how do I find what I want
there? How do I choose between a factory-reconditioned blender and a used
blender? Where is this “outlet” and will I be forced to eat a mammoth soft
pretzel when I get there?
In this chapter, you will navigate your way around the wilds of Amazon. I’ll
give you a thorough walk-through of Auctions and zShops. I’ll cover the differ-
ent things you can find there and what you should know about buying them.
I’ll show you the Outlet (and, no, you won’t have to eat any soft pretzels or
any fudge) and show you how to figure out if you’re getting a good deal. And
last, but certainly not least, I’ll take a close look at Specialty Stores and show
you what it’s like to boutique shop on the Web!

Auctions & zShops
This is where you’ll find the truly unique products at Amazon, because both
Auctions and zShops are “stocked” by users, not by Amazon. That also
means you need to be diligent about staying informed when you buy.
You can access both Auctions and zShops from the store directory. To get
there, simply click on the See More Stores link at the top of each page next to
the tabs. Auctions and zShops are under the Bargains heading.
Going, going, gone!
Online auctions are a great idea . . . that eBay had first. Amazon came in a
close second, but eBay has definitely cornered that market. (And if you want
to get way into the online auction scene, check out Marsha Collier’s book,
eBay For Dummies.) A cornered market isn’t such great news for Amazon —
but it’s actually good news for you. Here’s why:
 Amazon Auctions are easier to navigate. If you’ve ever even done a
search on eBay, you know that housing the world’s largest online auctions
community can be a little bit overwhelming. (You may want to bust out
that book even before you look.) Amazon’s auctions are not so over-
whelming. Let me put it to you this way: when I search for “Christian Dior”
on Amazon I get 519 search results. When I search on eBay, I get 4,025. Of
course, the flip side to this is that there’s less selection at Amazon, which
is why I encourage you to shop both! (See the next bullet.) 
 You can use both sites. That’s right. Forget loyalty, my friends. Bargain
shopping is a take-no-prisoners quest. Maybe Amazon can’t shop at eBay,
but you can. Amazon went into the auction biz a heartbeat too late, but
you increased your chances of finding that strange and special something.
Search both sites. If you find it at Amazon, start bidding there. (You’ll
probably get it cheaper.) If you don’t find it, go to eBay. Of course, if you’re
selling and you only have one of the item you’re going to list, you can only
list it at one site. After all, if you put two listings up you’ll likely have two
winners. One item and two winners equal auction unhappiness.
 You can find better deals on Amazon. There are fewer people compet-
ing for the goods at Amazon. So things just don’t get bid up the same
way they do at eBay. You won’t always get a better deal, but less compe-
tition is a good place to start.
 You can pay with your Amazon account. No dealing with PayPal or
money orders, or check’s in the mail stuff. Amazon has created an auc-
tions payment system called Amazon.com Payments that’s virtually
seamless. No need to sign up for anything new. Just click away!
96
Part II: You Want It? They Got It: Shopping and Buying at Amazon.com 

So what do you find at Amazon Auctions? Almost anything. Here are the cate-
gories on the Auctions directory page (which you can access by clicking
Browse Categories in the Auctions subnav): Art & Antiques, Books, Cars &
Transportation, Clothing & Accessories, Coins & Stamps, Collectibles, Comics,
Cards & Sci-Fi, Computers & Software, Electronics & Photography, Family &
Living, Food & Beverages, Home & Garden, Jewelry, Gems & Watches, Movies &
Video, Music, Sports, Tools & Hardware, Toys & Games, Travel & Real Estate,
and Other Goods & Services. So you might find a used juicer, a vintage Lone
Ranger lunchbox, a diamond ring, or anything else you can think of that’s legal.
Who knows? That’s what makes it fun.
Bidding
Bidding on an auction is somehow thrilling — even online. To bid at Amazon
Auctions, you’ll need to have an Amazon account in place and be signed in (if
you’re not, they’ll ask you to do that en route). These instructions are for first
time bidders. Once you join the ranks of Auctions buyers, you’ll get to skip a
few of the setup steps and bidding becomes even easier.
So here’s how you do it:
1. Find an item you want to bid on.
You can get to the Auctions home page by clicking on the See More
Stores link (at the tops of each page to the right of the tabs) and then on
Auctions (under Bargains). Browse the categories or do a search just the
way you would for any other item at Amazon.
2. Enter your maximum bid in the appropriately named Enter Your
Maximum Bid text box.
Figure 7-1 shows an Auction detail page. The bidding box is on the right
side of the page. Your maximum bid is the most you’re willing to pay for
the item, but not necessarily what you will pay for the item. Amazon’s
system pits bidders against each other automatically, upping the ante
little by little, until there’s a winner. So if you’re bidding against other
people whose maximum bids are significantly lower than yours, you
may end up getting a real deal!
3. Click the Bid Now! button.
You’ll come to a Sign In screen.
4. Enter your e-mail address and passwords in the fields provided and
click the Sign In Using Our Secure Server button.
You’ll come to the Billing Address page, which shows you every address
ever associated with your account, including the addresses of people
you’ve sent gifts to. You’ll be asked to choose one as a billing address
or enter a new address for billing.
97
Chapter 7: The Strange, the Special, and the Super Cheap

5. Choose your billing address from the list of possible addresses or
enter a new billing address and click Continue.
Choose the address that goes with the credit card you’d like to pay with
by clicking the Use This Address button next to it. Clicking that button
has the same effect as clicking Continue — it takes you to the credit
card/nickname/agreement page.
6. Review your credit-card information and billing address and check
the box that states that you’ve read and agree to the participation
agreement.
Make sure they’re showing the credit card that you want to use for your
Amazon Payments. When you’re asked to read and agree to the partici-
pation agreement, definitely read it. Auctions are not the same as regular
purchases — and the agreement clearly outlines the differences. 
7. Give yourself a nickname and then click Continue.
Your nickname is how you show up as a buyer or seller on the Auctions
site. Amazon will give you a default nickname — probably something
close to your e-mail address — but you are free to change it. When you
click Continue, you’ll come to the confirmation page.
8. In the new page that appears, confirm your bid.
This is your last chance — to review the details of your auction and to
change your mind. Make sure you take more than a cursory glance at the
details because once you click, you’re committed. When you’re sure,
click the Confirm Your Bid button.
Amazon lets you know via e-mail if you’ve been outbid, and gives you an
opportunity to raise your maximum bid. They’re good about keeping you in
the game. In fact, one difference between Amazon’s auctions and auctions at
eBay is that at Amazon, if a new bid is received with less than ten minutes to
go in the auction, the auction is automatically extended for an additional ten
minutes. So you don’t have to worry about someone creeping in at the last
second and snatching up your item. If you win your auction, they’ll send you
an e-mail notifying you — very exciting!
If you’re desperate to have some cherished item and you don’t want to risk
losing the auction, you can use the Take-It Now option. This is a fixed price
that the seller is willing to take for the item. It’s higher than the minimum bid,
but it’s a sure thing. You can also use 1-Click to buy auction items with Take-It
Now, but unlike usual Amazon 1-Click shopping, you can’t cancel a 1-Click
Auctions take-it now purchase.
98
Part II: You Want It? They Got It: Shopping and Buying at Amazon.com 

Everything from A to zShops
zShops is a collection of smaller merchants (we’re not talking Macys here), sell-
ing just about everything at a fixed price. You’ll find individuals like you and me
running zShops and even small companies (such as the jewelrynetwork.com)
selling through Amazon zShops.
As with auctions, zShops are run by people other than Amazon. What
Amazon provides is (simply) the venue. Product selection within any given
zShop can be very eclectic indeed. It’s something of an online bazaar.
Each of the zShops merchants has a storefront in zShops. But you don’t actu-
ally shop zShops by storefront. Instead, it’s set up the way all Amazon stores
are arranged — by category. You can access several of the categories in the
Browse box on the left side of the page or, to access them all, click Browse
Categories in the zShops subnav. You can also do a search for items within
zShops. So how do you access these “storefronts” I’ve mentioned?
Let’s say you’re looking to buy a vintage lunchbox. You might browse the
categories or do a search and make your way to a detail page for a vintage
lunchbox. (See Figure 7-2 for a zShops detail page.) On that page, you’ll see a
link next to the bolded “merchant”. Click on that and you’ll find yourself at
that merchant’s storefront. That’s an easy way to access storefronts — by
first landing on the detail page of an item that interests you.
Figure 7-1:
An Auction
detail page
and the Bid
Now box.

Chapter 7: The Strange, the Special, and the Super Cheap

What you’ll find at a zShops storefront varies from merchant to merchant.
Some merchants do very little with their storefronts and some really dress
theirs up. You may find a collection of similar products or a hodgepodge of
stuff. Some people use zShops to list just one high-ticket item at a fixed price
(because they can’t sell it through Marketplace and they don’t want to
auction it off).
Here are two important things to look for when you visit a merchant’s
storefront:
 Feedback Rating. Actually, this is the most important thing. You’ll find
the Feedback — how customers would rate their experience with the
merchant — just below the navigational boxes on the left side of the
page. Remember, you’re not buying from Amazon here, so it’s essential
that you do your homework. The highest rating is 5 stars and the lowest
is 0. Make sure you consider not only the total score, but also how many
people rated the seller.
 Company Information. In the upper-right corner of the storefront, below
the subnav, is a spot for merchants to tell buyers about their company.
Click on the link that begins “Learn more about” and you come to that
merchant’s information page. Here you can discover important things —
like what payment methods they accept and what their shipping and
returns policies are — and some more fluffy stuff — like what their com-
pany is all about.

Part II: You Want It? They Got It: Shopping and Buying at Amazon.com 

Payment, shipping, and other
important matters
Buying from Auctions and zShops is fun. It’s also very different from buying
directly from Amazon.com. Here’s why:
 You can’t always cancel your order. In fact, with Auctions, after you
confirm your bid, you’ve committed to buying it. If you win, it’s sold and
it’s yours. Period. Some zShops merchants will let you cancel an order,
but you have to deal with them directly.
 You can’t always return things. Again, Auctions sellers won’t let you
return (unless it’s a very, very nice and patient person). zShops mer-
chants are required to accept returns, but they have their own policies,
so make sure you know what they are before you buy.
 Amazon is not shipping your order. The individual seller is, so shipping
charges and times may vary.
 You can’t use gift certificates to buy from zShops or Auctions. I’m
guessing that this is something that will eventually change, but right
now — because you’re not really buying from Amazon — you can’t put
gift-certificate cash toward Auctions or zShops purchases.
The good news is you use Amazon.com Payments to pay. So the paying
process is seamless. You pay Amazon and they pay the seller, which is easier
for you and just like buying from Amazon directly. Some sellers also allow
other forms of payment, but take my word for it, Amazon.com Payments is
the way to go.
Outlet
I love outlet malls (despite my flippant comments about the soft pretzels and
fudge factories). I love them because I love a good deal and I’m not ashamed
to admit it. (I also love soft pretzels and fudge, but I am a little ashamed
about that.) 
To access the Amazon.com Outlet, just click on the See More Stores link at
the top of the page to the right of the tabs. You’ll find it in the store directory
under the Bargains heading. And bargain-licious it is! 
101
Chapter 7: The Strange, the Special, and the Super Cheap

Amazon’s Outlet is bigger and better than any outlet you’ll find in the physi-
cal world. There are literally hundreds of “stores” in the Amazon.com Outlet
with thousands of products on sale. Every Amazon category, most every
Amazon partner, and many Amazon smaller partners are represented in the
outlet. Hold on to your purse strings, people. It’s a dangerous place for any
crazed bargain hunter carrying money.
Bargains vs. Used vs. Factory
Reconditioned
The Amazon.com Outlet is a little bit different than your average outlet mall
because they don’t just sell new products for less. They also sell used mer-
chandise and factory-reconditioned merchandise. So what’s the difference?
Table 7-1 gives you a quick look at the three types of merchandise in the
Amazon.com Outlet.
Table 7-1
“Bargain,” “Used,” and “Factory Reconditioned”
Type of Product
Description
Bargain
These are your basic sale and clearance items. They’re new, in
perfect condition, and haven’t been owned before.
In books, they’ll probably be “remainders” — publishers’ over-
stocks that just didn’t sell as well as the publisher predicted. You
can often find hardback books for about $5. In the Music world the
extras are called “cut-outs” and you’ll find lots of those in the
Music outletIn the other products lines, they’re likely to be items
that an Amazon.com buyer just bought too many off. Lucky for you!
Used
These are Marketplace items that are being repurposed and
offered in the Outlet. In other words, these are items being sold
by individuals, not by Amazon — so all the usual rules of buying
from a non-Amazon entity apply. You’ll only find used items in
the following categories: Books, Camera & Photo, DVD,
Electronics, Music, Video, and Video Games.
Factory 
These are items that were returned to the manufacturer for one 
Reconditioned
reason or another (sometimes because they were broken but
often “just because”). The manufacturer thoroughly cleans,
inspects, and, if necessary, repairs the item, and then sells it
again at a dramatically reduced cost. The upshot: great prices
and more often than not, it works perfectly because it’s actually
been tested. The downside: It may not come in its original pack-
aging so it won’t make a great gift.
102
Part II: You Want It? They Got It: Shopping and Buying at Amazon.com 

How good are the deals?
Sometimes they are outstanding (I just bought a pair of red leather Kaepa ten-
nies for $9.99, down from $49.99) and sometimes not so great (like two dollars
off a $25 book). How do you know you’re getting a good deal? The obvious
answer is to look at the list price versus the sale price. When you see a 75 per-
cent discount, you know that’s got to be good. But there is another good way
to check. Do a Web search before you buy. 
You can use Google to search from the Amazon site. On most store home
pages at Amazon.com, there’s a Web-search box just beneath the Amazon
site-search box. Use it to find out what your item is selling for on other sites.
If you’re getting ready to buy a pair of red leather Kaepa tennies, search for
“red leather Kaepa shoes” and see what you come up with. (For the record,
no one could touch my $9.99 deal!) I also use this little technique when I’m
getting ready to bid on an auction, just to make sure I’m not being snowed.
Specialty Stores
Specialty Stores are the online boutiques of Amazon shopping. There are
more than 200 of them (that’s a lot of boutiques!) and what makes them fun
(and different from the rest of Amazon.com) is that they’re thematic: All the
products in a given specialty store relate to its theme. But none of the prod-
ucts that you can find in a Specialty Store are unique to that store. They all
live somewhere else on Amazon as well.
You can access the Specialty Stores directory from the main store directory.
(Just click the See More Stores link and then the Specialty Stores link in the
box on the right side of the page.) So why would you shop in a Specialty
Store? You’d shop there because you’re passionately interested in (say) Lego,
Jazz, cult movies, or power tools. This isn’t utilitarian shopping where you go
to the site and quickly get what you want. Specialty Stores are good for
browsing and for satisfying your personal interests. They’re also another
great way to find gifts, assuming you know what the recipient is into.
There are a few different kinds of Specialty Stores at Amazon. Table 7-2 out-
lines the various types and gives a few examples of each.

What’s with the Segway?
Many an Amazon shopper (and employee) has asked this question. What is
with the Segway and why does it get its own Specialty Store? (Strictly speak-
ing, the Segway Human Transporter isn’t a Specialty Store. It’s actually just a
detail page — an extremely detailed detail page. Figure 7-4 shows just a little
bit of what you’ll find on the Segway page.) The answer is simple: Jeff loves
the Segway. That said, it is an amazing invention, and it’s also a unique spot
on the Amazon Web site.
First off, for those of you who don’t know, the Segway is the “World’s first
dynamically stabilized Human Transporter.” In other words, it’s a two-
wheeled scooter that’s steadied by automatic gyroscopes, sturdy enough to
hold an adult, and (so far) legal for traveling on (many, but not all) city side-
walks. Here are a few other interesting bits about the Segway:
 Amazon is the only place to buy it online. You can also buy it by calling
Segway directly or in person at one of the ten dealerships around the
country.
 It sells for $4,950 plus shipping and taxes. This is no run-of-the-mill
scooter. 
 It can go up to 12 miles per hour. That may not sound fast, but most
people walk around 3 mph.

 You can rent one for the day. There are eight rentals shops in the
United States. To check out the nearest rental location near you, visit the
Segway Web site at

There are actually two Segways out there, as the new Segway HT p Series was
released in 2003. The HT p Series is lighter, smaller, and about $1,000 cheaper
than its predecessor, the HT i Series.

Get What You Want: Find It

In This Chapter
 Searching for the products you want
 Finding out how to use advanced search
 Refining your search results
 Getting the most from product reviews
T
here’s nothing more frustrating than knowing what you want and not
being able to find it. Truth. Everlasting love. A decent pair of black boots.
Where are they? You could spend your whole life searching. But not at
Amazon.com. Search for “truth” or “love” at Amazon and you’ll find thou-
sands of products that offer to fit the bill. Searching is miraculously simple
and remarkably fruitful.
Search results, on the other hand, can be something to contend with. So many
products, in so many categories! How do you know where to begin? And what
do you do when you’ve finally found that Italian espresso maker? That item
you’ve been hunting for. How do you know if it’s really what you wanted after
all? Getting the right information is key to successful shopping — especially
online when you can’t hold the merchandise in your hand — and Amazon is
rife with good information. You just have to know where to find it.
In this chapter, I’ll show you how to search for the items you want using
Amazon’s search functions. I’ll help you sort through your search results to
find what you’re really looking for, and I’ll show you where you can get the
best information on the products you’re considering. By chapter’s end, you’ll
be a searching sage. An e-shopping bloodhound!

Search Box: All Products or the Stores
The search box (shown in Figure 8-1) is on every “shopping” page of the
Amazon.com site. You won’t find it in places like the order pipeline and it
occasionally moves to be centered on the page, but otherwise it’s there, grac-
ing the top of the left side of the page, just below the navigation bar. 
Get to know the search box. Make it your friend, because more often than
not, it’s where your directed shopping begins.
You’ll notice that there are really only three important elements that make up
the search box: the search field, the drop-down menu, and the Go button.
These are the only elements you need to know to do a basic search at
Amazon. Here’s how it works:
1. Enter your keyword/s in the Search field.
Keywords can sometimes cause problems, so check out the sidebar enti-
tled The key to keywords” for some good keyword advice.
2. Choose an option from the drop-down menu.
This is what you’ll use to decide which part of the site to search. You
can choose All Products, or, if you know you’re looking for something
that is likely to be in a specific store, choose that store for a much nar-
rower search result.
3. Click the Go button.
This is how to get the search going!
The default for the drop-down menu is All Products. If you search without
changing it, you’ll likely get results from every store at Amazon. That can be a
lot of results to sift through. If you know what kind of product you’re looking
for, use the drop-down menu and search a specific store.

AAAGHH! Search Results Demystified
Scenario 1: you’ve just gotten a new puppy and you know you need stuff,
but you’re not sure what stuff, so you go to Amazon and do an All Products
search on “puppy.” You are faced with search results that look remarkably
like Figure 8-2. What does it mean?!

The key to keywords
When Amazon adds an item to their store, they
aren’t just putting it on a shelf somewhere.
There’s a technical process involved, which
includes entering information about the product
into their database. They enter all the basic infor-
mation — title, author, label, manufacturer — and
then they enter descriptive information about the
product. The idea is to help out when you’re
searching for something: If you don’t know the
exact title or name of what you’re looking for, you
can use keywords like “pleated khakis” or “green
sweater” that describe the product. You can also
use ISBN numbers or UPC codes as keywords.
These numbers identify specific products (ISBNs
identify books and UPCs identify just about every-
thing else) and when you use them as keywords,
Amazon.com will take you right to that product’s
detail page. 

Here’s a quick anatomy of an All Products search-results page:
 If at all possible, the search engine offers you search results from
every store. And for the matches that are sort of miscellaneous, there’s
the Everything Else category.
 You’ll find cool extras on the sides of the page. Notice that the right
and left columns feature some interesting Amazon extras — most
notably Listmania lists and So You’d Like To guides. Other Amazon
customers create these lists and guides. Amazon surfaces them in your
search results based on their relevant content. You can find out more
about these (and how to create your own) in Chapter 12.
 Amazon anticipates possible spelling errors. At the bottom of the page,
you’ll see a line that reads (in the case of the “puppy” search) No matches
for ‘puppy’. Below are matches for ‘poppy’. That’s how they
manage to offer restaurant-menu matches on my search for “puppy.”
How about Scenario 2? This time, you’ve already got a new puppy, but you
know that what you need is a book on how to train a puppy. So you go to
Amazon, type puppy in the search field, and use the drop-down menu to
select Books. Conveniently, three popular books on raising puppies are listed
first. But you still get 1,427 results! What if you don’t want one of the three
most popular? Are you going to go through 1,427 detail pages? Mais non!
Remember, search results are more specific when you enter a more specific
set of keywords. To come up with search results that look like Figure 8-3 — a
much more manageable 86 — you enter puppy training; then select Books
from the drop-down menu.

Picky, Picky: Refining 
Your Search Results
The easiest way to narrow down your search results is to add more specific
keywords. Once you’ve done that, you can then use the drop-down menu that
sits at the top of the “All results” list to sort them. 
The drop-down menu varies some from store to store, but it usually offers
some or all the following choices: Bestselling, Featured Items, Average
Customer Rating, Price: Low to High, Price: High to Low, Alphabetical: A to Z,
and Alphabetical: Z to A. When you select one of the choices from the drop-
down menu, Amazon sorts it accordingly, making it easier to find what you’re
looking.
In certain stores, like Apparel and Sporting Goods, you can actually refine
your search results using the left nav — the links running down the left side
of the page. Figure 8-4 shows the results for a search on “puppy” in the
apparel store. The left nav lets you refine your search by category, brand, or
price by simply clicking on the link that interests you. You’ll also notice that
each link in the left nav tells you how many results are in each location (in
parentheses at the end of each link).

Product Information
There’s something to be said for being able to handle a product before buying
it. That’s why so many people were skeptical about online shopping — how an
item feels is part of the decision-making process. But with the right informa-
tion, the need to feel diminishes, and the urge for convenience takes over. 
You can find all different kinds of product information at Amazon. In fact,
certain stores give you access to far more information than you’d find at a
comparable brick-and mortar-retailer. So how do you access it? In most of
the stores, the left nav on the detail page has a Product Information (or Item
Information, or Toy Information, and so on) box like the one in Figure 8-5.
This is the master list of the kinds of information Amazon offers for that
product. If you don’t see that box, then you know that item has limited infor-
mation on the site; you can find whatever information there is by scrolling
below the product image. 
Here are the different kinds of product information offered at Amazon.com:
 Buying Info: This is the basic information — price, shipping informa-
tion, and so on — that you’ll find for every product at Amazon. It lives
right next to the item’s image on the detail page. Occasionally, you’ll
have to click a link to see complete buying info — especially if there’s
a lot of info associated with the item you’re looking at.
 Big Pictures: Click on images for a bigger view of the goodies you’ve
been ogling from afar.
 Product Features or Details: Many products also have feature informa-
tion. This is usually a bulleted list of the most prominent characteristics
of that item. You’ll find this information farther down the detail page,
above the reviews.
 Technical Specs: Many items (typically electronic or mechanical things)
offer more details in the form of technical specifications. You can access
them from the left nav Item Information box on the detail page.
113
Chapter 8: Get What You Want: Find It and Suss It Out

 Product Manuals: Some products on the site (again, usually electronic
or mechanical) have PDF files you can download that contain electronic
versions of their manuals. You’ll find these in the left nav information
box or below the product details on the detail page. If you need some
help downloading and viewing PDFs, check out the “Kiss your paper-
weight goodbye” sidebar.
 Editorial Reviews: Amazon hires pros to review their products, so you
can be assured that anything they tell you is worth knowing. You’ll find
these on the detail page, above customer reviews and below product
details.
 Customer Reviews: This is the cornerstone of Amazon’s success as a
source of information about various products. Customers review the
products, giving you the lowdown on what real people think of them.
That can be a great help when you’re trying to decide what you should
and shouldn’t buy.
But wait! There’s more. When it comes to product information, Amazon
is king. Explore the detail pages of the different stores as you visit them.
They vary from store to store and each one offers its own informational
gems. You’ll find things like a link to all the books written by the author
whose book you’re looking at. You’ll see entire segments of the page devoted
to showing you like products based on other customers’ purchases. On many
detail pages, you’ll even find customer suggestions on what to buy instead of
the item you’re looking at.

Striking Infogold: Expert Advice
Sprinkled throughout Amazon.com are little informational gems — checklists,
buying guides, articles, and so on — that’ll help you make smart buying deci-
sions. These gems are extremely helpful and, unfortunately, a little bit hard to
find. In some stores, they’re on the subcategory pages under the heading
Expert Advice. Other stores put them all together in information centers. But
right now, there is no centralized directory, though there are hundreds of
guides, articles, and other helpful bits living on the site. 
To find these informational gems, you have to happen upon them in the various
stores. For example, the digital camera buying guide is on the digital camera
page in the Camera and Photo section of the electronics store. But if you want
information on buying a car seat for your child, all you have to do is go the
resource center (Figure 8-6) in the Baby store — it’s a choice in the subnav.

PDF, or portable document format, is a univer-
sal file format created by Adobe. It’s used to
convert other types of online documents —

Here’s a quick list of the kinds of expert advice you’ll find at Amazon:
 Buying Guides: Buying guides give you all the basic information you need
if you’re going to buy a specific type of product (say, a digital camera).
 Articles: These are often taken from magazines or other expert sources,
and can be anything from a lifestyle piece to a step-by-step how-to project.
 Checklists/Essentials: These quick lists show you everything-you-need-
to-have or the-basics-you-need-to-have to tackle complicated undertak-
ings. You’ll find lots of these in (for example) the Baby store.
 Tips: Typically these take the form of a top-ten list of helpful hints.
 Introduction to: These are exactly what they sound like — the shopping
equivalent of a 101 class. Unlike buying guides, these aren’t product-
driven. They’re hobby-driven!
 Glossary of terms: Here’s your basic list of important terms and their
definitions — handy for talking to salespeople or asking questions of the
experts.
Table 8-2 gives you a quick look at which stores have these informational
gems and where you’ll find them within the stores.

lar stores, Essentials are the “must-

Some of these info centers are hard to find, and you can’t dig them up by
using any of Amazon’s search tools. Amazon is always changing, and while
the info centers aren’t going anywhere, there’s no guarantee that the path
you took to get there the first time will be the same the next time. One way to
find your way back is to bookmark any info center you visit. 
Reviews
Reviews are one of the things that make Amazon Amazon. Without them, it’d
be tough to buy online. You’ll find product reviews for many, but not all, prod-
ucts at Amazon.com. They live on the detail page, usually below the fold
(that’s the newspaper throwback term for content that you have to scroll to
see) under the product information and other marketing stuff. There are a
few different kinds of reviews at Amazon:
 Amazon.com Review: This is written by an Amazon editor who has sam-
pled the product (read the book, used the camera, listened to the CD,
whatever). The significant difference between a review and a product
description is that a review puts forth an opinion of a product. The
description only describes its features or how it works. You’ll find
reviews all over the store — they’re not product specific.
117
Chapter 8: Get What You Want: Find It and Suss It Out

 Amazon.com Product Description: Product descriptions are detailed
accounts of the product’s features, but no opinion. You’ll find descrip-
tions all over Amazon.com, but particularly in the stores that sell
products that can be described objectively — Electronics, Kitchen,
Tools, and so on (but not so much in books, music, and DVD/video).
 Customer Reviews: This is where you’ll get the account of any product
that’s most free of manufacturer’s hype. Customers, of course, write cus-
tomer reviews. Sometime they’re insightful and helpful and other times
they aren’t. It’s a good idea to consider an item’s customer reviews as a
whole. Because, let’s face it, not everyone is playing with a full deck, but
just about anyone can write a customer review.
 Industry Reviews: Occasionally, you’ll find an editorial snippet from a
relevant publication or source (such as The New York Times in the Books
store). There doesn’t appear to be any rhyme or reason as to when these
industry reviews show up, but they’re a good added voice when you’re
making a buying decision — and, as you can imagine, they’re typically
positive reviews.
 Information from the source: Amazon often includes information that
the manufacturer, publisher, label, or studio has provided. This is usually
factual stuff — not just a professional opinion — but keep in mind that
whoever made the item is in business to sell it, so you may not find out
much about its shortcomings here. In fact, sometimes this information is
a bit fluffy.
It’s in the Stars: Customer Reviews
Customer reviews live just below the editorial reviews on the detail page
and they are an essential part of any Amazon shopping experience. I think
that the best way to find out if a product is worth buying is to check out the
customer reviews — carefully. Like I mentioned, customer reviews are almost
always unbiased. These people aren’t trying to sell. They’re just putting their
two cents in (and if you want to put in your own two cents, Chapter 12 tells
you how); by and large, you can trust them. The key is knowing how to look
at each individual review and how to consider the reviews as a whole.
Your standard customer review
Here’s a quick anatomy of the customer review (Figure 8-7):
 Stars: Customers rate reviews on a five-star system, with zero as the
worst and five as the best.
 Title: This is the title given to the review by the reviewer. Often it’s a
bite-sized version of what they thought of the product (but not always).
118
Part II: You Want It? They Got It: Shopping and Buying at Amazon.com 

 Date: Lets you know when the review was written. This is more impor-
tant for products that may go out of date as new versions come on the
market — electronics, computers, and so on.
 Top Reviewer Icon: Occasionally, you’ll see an icon next to the reviewer
information that says “Top (insert number here) Reviewer.” It means that
this person has written lots of helpful reviews. You’ll notice that you
have the option to vote on a review. Top Reviewers are chosen because
their reviews are voted “most helpful most often.”
 Reviewer Info: A name or an online alias, and where they’re from.
 Review Helpfulness: You may see a statement just above the review that
tells you how many people found it to be helpful. This is a part of the
review voting system. 
 Review: This is the actual review — what they thought of the product.
 Voting Option: Below the review is the question, “Was this review help-
ful to you?” followed by a Yes button and a No button. If you want, you
can choose one of the two and click. Your vote will be tabulated with the
other votes for that review to contribute to the Review Helpfulness line
and, maybe, that person’s Top Reviewer status.
Although customer reviews are relatively unbiased, it’s important to know
whether the customer whose views you’re reading is someone you’d agree
with. Fortunately, when you’re checking out an individual customer review,
you can do more than just read it. You can also do the following: 
 Look at the reviewer’s status. If that customer is rated a Top Reviewer,
the odds are better that the review is good info.
 See whether other people found the review helpful. 
 Look at the reviewers’ Friends & Family bio. If there is one, it’s worth
checking out. Who the heck are these people? What other things have
they bought or reviewed? Do you have anything in common with them?

119
Chapter 8: Get What You Want: Find It and Suss It Out

You should also consider reviews as a whole. Here are a few guidelines:
 Take note of how many reviews an item has. If an item has hundreds of
reviews, it may or may not be great, but it’s definitely popular. And it’s
got enough oomph that lots of people chose to write about it. 
 Look at the overall stars. This is, of course, an obvious thing to do, but
I’m a control freak and I can’t help myself. I had to mention it.
 Read the bad ones. Keep in mind that if an item has a handful of reviews —
let’s say ten or fewer — a couple of bad reviews can bring its score down
significantly. So scan the list for negative reviews. If you find just one or
two, read them. Sometimes kooks get online and write reviews too. It’d be a
shame to pass up a good product because of one or two grouchy reviews.
Spotlight Reviews
You may have noticed that the Customer Reviews section starts out with the
Spotlight Reviews header (as in Figure 8-8). These reviews are chosen daily by
Amazon’s editorial staff from the pool of reviews deemed most helpful by
other customers. Spotlight Reviews are always shown first, above the other
customer reviews, as long as there are enough really good reviews to qualify.
For items that have more than a few, Amazon doesn’t show all reviews on the
detail page. To see them all, click the See all customer reviews link at the
bottom of the list showing the reviews.

 Understanding browse nodes
 Browsing your way through the store
 Using the subnav
 Getting to know special areas
I
n the early days of Amazon, there was a favorite expression used by the
higher-ups. They liked to refer to the site as a “discovery machine.” While
I always thought that sounded oddly Wonka-esque and a little embarrassing, I
agree with the sentiment. Amazon is a great place to discover things. Unlike a
brick-and-mortar retailer, Amazon never cleans house. It doesn’t have to.
Instead, it gets bigger — like an onion, growing layer after layer of products
and content. Those layers make it a great place to explore and to find things
that you didn’t even know were out there. Things like Book Accessories
(which includes everything from bookmarks to Bible covers) or the Artisan
Gallery (a collection of handmade garden art and fixtures in the Outdoor
Living store).
But not everyone uses the site that way. Most new customers who come to
Amazon are searchers — they have an item in mind, they use the Search fea-
ture to find it, and they’re done. Once they spend a little bit of time at
Amazon, though, they find there’s a lot more than quick searching to be done.
That’s where Browse — the Web equivalent of window-shopping — comes in.
Amazon is set up for it — and it’s far more than just a leisurely e-stroll.
At Amazon, browse isn’t just a verb. It’s an adjective too (as in browse node),
and it’s a noun (as in doing a music browse). In this chapter, I explain the
meaning of (and some of the thinking behind) all three usages. I show you
how to browse around the store, point out some interesting stops along the
way, and explain how browsing different stores can be a different experience.
This is the part where you find out how to have some fun at Amazon, but be
warned! Browsing the site is a really good way to make an hour or two (and
yeah, okay, some of your cash) magically disappear.

The Basics of Browse
If you’ve ever gone to Amazon and found yourself clicking around the site on
stuff that catches your eye, then you’ve already browsed. It’s not difficult. In
fact, browsing comes naturally to us shoppers. But there are a few things to
know that can make you a better browser:
 Scroll! The pages at Amazon are loooong. If you’re not scrolling down well
below the fold (and by “below the fold” I mean any area beneath what’s
immediately visible when you come to the page), you’re missing more
than half of the good stuff. (I’ll get to that good stuff later in the chapter.)
 Go the whole nine yards. At least once, browse from the top to the
bottom. By that I mean, check out every layer offered within a store. For
example, your breadcrumb trail — the series of links that show your path
to your current location — might look like this: Kitchen & Housewares ➪
Categories ➪Coffee, Tea & Espresso ➪Coffee Machines ➪Drip Coffee
Machines. That way, you’ll have a better sense of how many layers of
detail there are in a given store.
 Use the info centers. Amazon is plumb full of excellent information and
lots of it lives in the info centers. (See Chapter 8 for a list of topics and
locations.) Spend some time browsing those. It’s like reading a good
magazine and shopping at the same time.
122
Part II: You Want It? They Got It: Shopping and Buying at Amazon.com 
What’s a browse node and should I
have it removed?
The short answer to that question is, “No.” As
for what it is, the simplest explanation is that a
browse node is Amazon’s term for any of the
various groupings that make up the site
structure — sort of like the e-commerce equiv-
alent of departments, aisles, and shelves. 
Think of the millions of products at Amazon.com.
If all anyone ever wanted to do was search for
things, those products could all float around in
the ether in no particular order at all. It would-
n’t matter because the Search feature would
use keywords to pull up products that matched.
But just as people like to shop in physical
stores, people want to wander the electronic
aisles of Amazon. So products are organized
into meaningful groups and each of those
groups is a browse node. 
But not all browse nodes are created equal.
There are different levels of browse nodes. The
stores are the highest level, and every page
beneath them (until you get down to the detail
page) is another browse node. Lots of products
appear in a variety of different nodes. Of course,
you can find them in their actual category (for
example, jazz music). But they might also be on
an Essentials list — which is a node of its own.
Or they might be in a Specialty Store (another
kind of node). When you’re exploring the site,
you’re jumping from node to node. Here’s
another way to think of it: The Search feature
deals with individual products; Browse deals
with groups of like products.

 Use the breadcrumb trail. You are not lost! At the top of browse node
pages there’s a breadcrumb trail (pictured in Figure 9-1) so you always
know where you are.
 Sort it! You can actually sort browse lists. For example, go to the mystery
section in Books and you’ll find that you can sort your browse list by
“featured,” “recommendations,” “top sellers,” “new releases,” and “used.”
It’s a good way to get a different look at the category you’re exploring.
 Bookmark it. If you find something nifty during your browsing adven-
ture, use your browser’s bookmark feature to bookmark it. There’s noth-
ing more frustrating than trying to find something and coming up blank.
Bookmark it and you’ll always be able to get there.
Don’t forget to scroll: Juicy tidbits
below the fold
Back in the day, everything worth anything had to be “above the fold.” The
phrase comes from the newspaper world — where there actually was a fold.
In terms of the Web, “above the fold” encompasses everything you see on the
page when you open up your browser, but before you scroll. It’s still a good
place to be if you’re someone trying to sell something on Amazon, but if
you’re a shopper, limiting yourself to things above the fold is a travesty!
Lots and lots of good stuff lives below the fold. It varies depending on what
type of page you’re on — store page, category page, detail page, and so on —
but one juicy morsel that’s always below the fold is the Bottom of the Page
Deals (See Figure 9-2). This is a random assortment of deeply discounted
products. They change daily, so remember to take a look each time you visit.

you’ll find the Customers Who Bought This Also Bought feature just
below the fold. This feature is a good way to find like products that you
might enjoy. If an entire group of people bought a book that you loved,
you might also love another book that the same group purchased.
 Reviews: Both product and customer reviews live below the fold.
 Expert Advice: You’ll find this header sprinkled throughout the site on
category and subcategory pages. This is how you can access Amazon’s
info centers and other fun information.
 Your Recent History: As you shop, Amazon keeps a log of your journey
and records it in a box that sits almost at the bottom of the page. You
can use the links in the Your Recent History box to get back to some-
thing you looked at earlier in your shopping trip.
The list versus the slide show
As you browse along, you’ll notice that not all browses (and I’m using the
words as a noun here) look the same. Amazon displays browse nodes in two
ways: the list and the slide show. Figure 9-3 shows an example of each.
Why one versus the other? The answer has to do with giving customers the
right kind of information. When you shop for books, music, or DVDs, you
probably want written product information, because knowing what the cover
art looks like doesn’t really help you. On the other hand, when you shop for
Figure 9-2:

below the

hard goods — kitchen products, TVs, cordless drills, or sweaters — seeing
the product informs you faster than written information would. Plus, with the
slide show, they can fit more products above the fold.
Using the Subnav to Find Goodies
Poor subnav. It’s ever the sidekick. The best supporting actress. It’s one of
the most underrated parts of Amazon.com. (To review, the subnav is the strip
of buttons at the top of the page just below the store tabs.) But the subnav

Chapter 9: Window-Shopping on the Web

deserves a fair shake. There are actually lots of goodies to be found by using
the subnav, and unlike lots of other things at Amazon, it’s always there so you
can always find it.
Here are a few subnav ground rules:
 Subnavs differ from store to store. All subnavs at Amazon serve the
same purpose — to help you get to places within that store in one click —
but they’re not the same store to store.
 The subnav is always the same within a given store. So no matter what
page you’re on in the Books store, for example, your subnav will look the
same. You can access the same areas from the Books store home page as
you would from a book detail page.
 Subnavs offer a mix of choices that you can find elsewhere in the
store as well as choices that are unique to the subnav. Though they
differ from store to store, all subnavs offer the same kind of choices.
There are always Browse Categories buttons, a few featured categories,
possibly an Advanced Search option, and then some goodies.
 The subnav on the Welcome page is unique. This is the only subnav
that allows access to the Top Sellers and Today’s Deals directory pages
as well as Target and the international stores.
And here are some of the goodies you’ll find on the subnav:
 Top Sellers: You’ll find a Top Sellers button on the subnav of every store
at Amazon (in Books it’s called Bestsellers). They are Amazon’s most
popular items and the lists are updated hourly! You’ll also notice a
subset of Top Sellers listed by category in boxes on the right side of the
page, as shown in Figure 9-4.
 Today’s Deals: Every store except Books, Toys, and Baby features this
subnav item. The deals are a combination of those advertised by Amazon
in Sunday circulars, and some regular deals that just show up on the site.
 New & Future Releases: You’ll find New and Future Releases in Music,
Video, and DVD. In this section you can not only check out all the new
releases by date, but you can also preorder items that haven’t been
released yet.
 Resource Center: Alas, the only subnav that features a Resource Center
is Baby. But there are several other centers on the site and I’m lobbying
to get them up on that subnav!
 Used: This shows up in several of the stores — Books, Music, DVD,
Kitchen — to name a few. If you don’t need it sparkly new, you can find
great deals here.
126
Part II: You Want It? They Got It: Shopping and Buying at Amazon.com 

 Store-Specific Goodies: Check out the subnav in each store and you’ll
find that they all have their unique sweet spots — Shop by Age in the
Toys Store, Newspapers and Professional/Trade magazines in the
Magazine store, Maternity in the Apparel store, and so on.
No matter where you are within a given store, you can click on the store’s
main tab — the one that says Electronics or Books or whatever — to get back
to that store’s home page.
Movers and Shakers
Movers and Shakers are fun. They’re the 25 biggest daily gainers in Amazon
sales ranking. In other words, they are what’s hot right now. I would never
suggest that you buy things just because the other kids are doing it, but it is
cool to check out who’s buying what — in almost-real time.
You’ll find Movers and Shakers for the following products: Books, Music,
Videos, DVDs, Electronics, Software, Toys & Games, Video Games, Kitchen &
Housewares, Magazine Subscriptions, Outdoor Living, and Tools & Hardware.
Now here’s the tricky part. As far as I can tell, you can only access the vari-
ous Movers and Shakers lists from two places: the Welcome page and the
Your Recommendations area in Your Store. In both places, it’s at the bottom
of the page, so you have to scroll down a bit.

A
t last you’ve found it! You searched. You browsed. You discovered. And
now you want to buy. But how? If you’re new to Amazon.com, buying
may be mysterious and a little bit scary. Where’s my shopping cart? Where’s
the checkout lane? Is it safe to give them my credit-card info?
Don’t fret. Buying at Amazon is as easy as shopping at Amazon — safe too. In
this chapter, I show you how to buy like a pro — from signing in to consoli-
dating orders. I walk you through the buying process step by step — putting
items in your shopping cart, entering your shipping and credit-card informa-
tion, double-checking your order, and taking the leap to being an official
Amazon customer.
You’ve Found It, Now 
How Do You Buy It?
Buying at Amazon is pretty easy — really easy after you’ve made one pur-
chase and can buy with 1-Click. But that first purchase does take a little bit of
effort. And it’s during that first purchase that you set up certain areas of your
account that you continue to use down the line. Don’t worry! You can always

make changes to your account. But that first purchase helps you set up
things like a default shipping address and default credit-card information.
Here are a few things you should know about buying at Amazon.com:
 Buying changes after your first purchase. Once you’ve bought from
Amazon and they have your information, buying gets much simpler.
When you have an active account, buying with your shopping cart is a 
4-step process: Sign In, Shipping & Payment (all on one page), Gift Wrap
(optional), and Place Order. You can also buy with 1-Click, which is, liter-
ally, a 1-Click process.
 You can cancel or return an item ordered from Amazon, but not nec-
essarily from an Amazon merchant. As long as it hasn’t entered the
shipping process, you can cancel any item ordered from Amazon, but
not any item ordered at Amazon. If you buy from an Amazon merchant,
you are subject to their cancellation policies. Same goes for returns.
 Your credit-card information is safe. Amazon uses the industry stan-
dard SSL technology (that stands for Secure Sockets Layer) to encrypt
your credit-card info as you send it. They also promise safe shopping —
shopping free from credit-card fraud — and cover any fraudulent shop-
ping on your credit card over what your bank will cover.
Signing in
Any time you want to buy, whether you’re a newbie or an old hand, you have
to sign in. If you don’t already have an account, don’t worry about it. You
create one as part of the buying process. (If you’re interested in creating an
account before you buy, check out Chapter 3.) 
If you do have an account, you’re asked to sign in before you can add an item
to your shopping cart. To do that, simply enter the e-mail address you used
to set up your account, enter your password, and click the sign-in button. 
If you’ve forgotten your password, don’t worry. Click the Forgot Your
Password link below the sign-in button and Amazon walks you through a 
3-step process to create a new one. They e-mail your new password to your
e-mail address of record instantly. The entire process won’t hold up your
shopping for more than a minute or two.
130
Part II: You Want It? They Got It: Shopping and Buying at Amazon.com 

Adding it to your shopping cart
So where is this fabled shopping cart? There are two good ways to access
your shopping cart. One is by clicking the View Cart link in the Shopping
Tools menu at the top of every page. The other is by adding something to
your cart from a detail page. 
You can stuff your cart to the brim — there’s no limit — and adding to your
cart doesn’t mean you have to buy. Once you add something, it stays there
for 90 days unless you take it out. So if you decide you don’t really feel like
buying it right now, you can exit the order pipeline and it will still be there
later.
Ship it. Ship it good.
Once you’ve added the item to your cart, you have to arrange the shipping.
Amazon makes this very easy for you. You have three choices:
 Standard shipping: This takes 3-7 days and is the cheapest option.
 Two-day shipping: This takes 2 business days and they won’t deliver on
Saturday.
 One-day shipping: This takes 1 business day and, again, no Saturday
delivery. This is the most expensive option.
One thing to keep in mind is that these shipping times refer to just that: the
shipping from the distribution center to your house. They don’t include the
availability time. That’s the time listed on the product’s detail page, some-
thing like, “usually ships within 24 hours” or “usually ships within 1 to 2
weeks.” Be sure to take that into account so you’re not disappointed when
your item doesn’t arrive the next day.
You may also be eligible for Amazon’s free Super Saver shipping. It’s for
orders over $25 but excludes certain things like toys, video games, baby
items, and things sold by Amazon merchants or marketplace sellers. The rub
is that Super Saver shipping takes an additional 3-5 days. But if you’re not in a
hurry, you can save a bundle on shipping costs.
For more details on Super Saver shipping, plus a complete list of shipping
rates and some other good shipping info, go to the Shipping section of the
Help department.

Chapter 10: Clicking Your Way to Purchase Paradise

Relatively painless paying
I say “relatively” because although the process is simple, you still have to
give them your money. That said, paying at Amazon is pretty painless. You
give them your credit-card information, they keep it on file — and don’t
worry, it’s 100 percent safe — and every time you shop, it’s ready for you to
use. You do have to enter it again (for security reasons) if you ship to a new
address, but it’s worth it in the name of safety!
If, at any point, you want to use a different credit card, you can change your
credit-card information either by accessing it through Your Account (see
Chapter 3) or during the buying process — but not if you’re using 1-Click. 
Amazon.com also accepts other methods of payment. To find out what they
are, check out Chapter 3 or visit the Payment Methods We Accept section of
the Help department. You can find it under Ordering.
To get to the Help department, simply click on Help in the Shopping Tools
menu at the top right of almost any page on the site.
Shooting the order pipeline
When you’re ready to place an item in your shopping cart, you’re about to
enter what Amazonians call, The Order Pipeline. Radical. You’re ready to buy.
Buying on Amazon for the first time is really just a few steps start to finish.
Here’s how you do it:
1. Click the Add to Shopping Cart button on the detail page of the item
you want to buy.
You find a Ready to Buy? box, looking very much like the one in Figure
10-1, on every detail page in the site. When you’re a new customer,
before you’ve made your first purchase, your only option in the Ready
to Buy? box is to “add to shopping cart.” 
2. In the new page that appears — see Figure 10-2 — confirm or Edit the
content of your shopping cart.
Only the box labeled “Your Shopping Cart” is your shopping cart. The
rest is made up of recommendations based on your purchase history
and the purchase histories of other people who’ve bought what you’re
buying. Confirm that you want to buy the items in your cart. (No stress,
though. This isn’t the moment of truth. You can delete items later in the
buying process.) If you’ve had second thoughts, click the Edit Shopping
Cart button, delete or change the necessary items, and proceed to Step 3.
132
Part II: You Want It? They Got It: Shopping and Buying at Amazon.com 

3. Keeping on the same page, choose whether you want to show gift
options during checkout, and then click Proceed to Checkout.
If your item is a gift, you may want to include a card and gift wrap, or at
least a gift note (which is free). That way, your recipient will know that
the gift is from you. Without at least a gift note, it’s tough for them to
tell. To show gift options, check the box next to Show Gift Options
During Checkout. If not, leave the box unchecked.
4. In the new page that appears — appropriately named New Customer
Sign In — enter your e-mail address in the field provided.
If you are the proud owner of several e-mail addresses, be sure to enter
the e-mail address you want listed as your user ID at Amazon.com. You
get to create a password later. The next page asks you to enter your
shipping address.

Chapter 10: Clicking Your Way to Purchase Paradise

5. Enter your shipping address and phone number in the fields provided
and then click Continue.
They also ask whether you’re shipping and billing addresses are the
same. If they are, make sure you click the Yes radio button. It saves you
time later on. 
6. In the new page that appears, choose your shipping speed —
Standard, 2-Day, or 1-Day — and then click Continue.
You might also be eligible for Super Saver shipping (free shipping on 
certain orders over $25). If so, you’ll see that option listed as well.
Remember, though, that it takes 3-5 extra days. For shipping rates, click
the Learn More link next to the header. You notice that you have another
chance here to edit the contents of your shopping cart. Again, this is not
your last chance. You also notice that you have another chance to check
the gift options button — just in case.
7. In the new page that appears — a page that looks a lot like the page in
Figure 10-3 — enter your credit-card information into the appropriate
fields of the Payment Method section, scroll down and create a pass-
word in the sensibly named Create a Password section, and then click
Continue.
The page you see in Figure 10-3 is one of the most important pages at
Amazon, because it’s where you give up your credit-card digits and
create your password. You’re asked to enter your password twice to
ensure accuracy.

134
Part II: You Want It? They Got It: Shopping and Buying at Amazon.com 

8. In the new page that appears, review your order and click the Place
Your Order button!
This is the moment of truth: You come to a page that looks like Figure
10-4. Notice that you have the opportunity to edit every part of your
order from shipping address to credit-card information. If you see some-
thing incorrect, just use the appropriate edit button to make a change. If
all’s well, place it! 
Whenever you buy with your shopping cart, you should review your order
carefully before placing it. Remember that when you put something in your
cart, it stays in the “active” part of your cart for 90 days. If within 90 days,
you add something else to your cart and proceed through the buying
process, that first item will be included in your purchase. To avoid this hap-
pening, you have to actively designate it “save for later.” If you don’t, you
might accidentally buy it.
E-Mail Confirmation
Any time you make a purchase at Amazon.com, they send you an e-mail con-
firming your buy. In fact, it shows up in your inbox about two minutes after
you make that final click.
Though not all confirmation e-mails are identical, they all contain the same
critical information.

Chapter 10: Clicking Your Way to Purchase Paradise

Figure 10-5 is a confirmation e-mail I received for a purchase I made in the
Apparel store. The e-mail is broken down into a few different sections. At the
top — not shown in Figure 10-5 — is the “many splendors of your account”
plug (my name for it, not theirs). It’s followed by purchasing information, an
order summary, and some housekeeping-type stuff at the bottom. This e-mail
is more than just a hey-we-got-your-order note. It’s also a tool. Here are the
things you can do from your confirmation e-mail:
 Access your account. Some of the more popular order-related links are
in the e-mail, or you can just go to the main “Your Account” page. 
 Access the order summary page for that item. Do that by clicking the
hot linked order number in your e-mail. You can cancel or change orders
from the order summary page.
 Change your e-mail status from HTML to text-only. If your e-mail client
(the program you use to send and receive e-mail) isn’t set up to handle
them, HTML e-mails will look like a bunch of gibberish. Also, because
they’re image heavy, they take a bit of time to download. So if you’re on
a slow connection, you may prefer a text-based e-mail. At the bottom of
the e-mail (not shown in Figure 10-5) is a link that says Prefer not to
receive HTML mail? Click here. Clicking that link takes you to your
Customer Communications Preferences page where you can change
your e-mail receiving status.

How to Cancel Your Order
If you’re suddenly stricken with buyer’s remorse before your order is sent
out, you can cancel orders at Amazon.com — but be sure to do it by the
book.
Two conditions apply to all cancellations: If you bought the item from
Amazon, and not from one of its merchant or marketplace sellers, and if the
items hasn’t yet entered the shipping process, you can cancel. You may be
able to cancel orders from merchants or marketplace sellers, but you have to
deal with them directly and adhere to their cancellation policies.
To cancel an Amazon.com order, take the following steps:
1. Click the Your Account link to access the Your Account page.
You can find the necessary link at the top of every page in the Shopping
Tools menu.
2. In the Your Account page that appears, click the Cancel Items or
Orders link.
You arrive at your Open and Recently Shipped Orders page. You should
see the order listed under the Open Orders heading.
3. Click the View or Change Order button next to the item you want to
cancel.
This takes you to the order summary page for that item. You can also
access this page by clicking the order number in your confirmation
e-mail.
4. Click the Need to Cancel Order or Change Quantities? button.
First make sure that the order you want to cancel is actually under the
Not Yet Shipped heading. Only these orders are eligible for cancellation.
If it isn’t, you can wait until it arrives and return it. For some help on
how to do that, read Chapter 4.
5. Check the Cancel Item box and then click Update Order.
The Cancel Item box is to the right of the item title. 
When you’re finished, you find yourself at a page that looks like Figure 10-6.
You also receive an e-mail from Amazon.com that confirms your cancellation.
137
Chapter 10: Clicking Your Way to Purchase Paradise

Better Buying with 1-Click
After you’ve made your first purchase, assuming you paid with a credit card,
you’re set up for 1-Click shopping. 1-Click is the patented Amazon.com tech-
nology that lets you make a purchase with just one click of your mouse. After
you’ve made that first purchase, the Ready to Buy? box on the detail page
changes to include the 1-Click option (as in Figure 10-7).
Unless you change your 1-Click settings, Amazon uses the shipping address and
credit-card information you used for that first purchase. As you continue to buy
from Amazon, you may buy gifts and have them shipped to other people. Those
people become options in the drop-down menu in the Buy box — so you can 
1-Click gifts as well.
1-Click is very easy to use. So easy, in fact, that it makes my husband a little
bit sad. (But you know what they say . . . how can you really experience joy if
you don’t sometimes experience sadness?) But there are a few things you
should know about using 1-Click ordering:

138
Part II: You Want It? They Got It: Shopping and Buying at Amazon.com 

 You can’t use 1-Click to buy products from Amazon merchants.
Remember that often, when you buy at Amazon, you’re not buying from
Amazon. So many Amazon merchants, like the ones in the apparel and
sporting goods stores, aren’t compatible with 1-Click. Only two excep-
tions to this rule: Toys ‘R’ Us and Babies ‘R’ Us.
 1-Click won’t work if you’re using cookie-blocking software. If you
think your 1-Click settings are turned on and the 1-Click option isn’t
showing up in the Ready to Buy? box (and you’re buying from Amazon
itself, rather than from a merchant) it may be that the computer fairy (or
a techie-geek spouse?) has decided to protect you by adding this soft-
ware without your knowledge. Just a thought . . . 
 You can change your 1-Click settings to use a different credit card or
shipping address. Do this in the Personal Information section of
Account Settings on the Your Account page.
 You can link specific shipping addresses with specific credit cards.
Again, access the Personal Information section of Account Settings in
Your Account. You’ll notice that the 1-Click Settings page is also the
Address Book Management page (as in Figure 10-8). Next to each entry
in your address book, you have the 1-Click settings associated with that
address. Use the Edit button to change the credit-card information asso-
ciated with that person or address. This comes in handy if you use dif-
ferent credit cards for different purposes — say, work versus pleasure,
and so on.

Chapter 10: Clicking Your Way to Purchase Paradise

Order Consolidation
If you use 1-Click to buy several items in one visit, Amazon.com does their best
to automatically consolidate your order and send things together in one pack-
age. There are, however, a few things that affect automatic order consolidation:
 Items have to be shipping to the same address. Okay. All right. Duh. But
I felt like I had to mention it.
 Items have to be bought within a 90-minute period. I don’t know what’s
behind this Cinderella-esque rule. But I do know that after 90 minutes,
it’s out of the automatic consolidation loop. You can sometimes consoli-
date them yourself through Your Account. The window for manual con-
solidation is wider — more like a few hours or even a day — though not
entirely concrete. In other words, after the 90 minutes is up, nobody is
making any promises.
 Items bought from Amazon.com can’t be consolidated with items
bought from merchants, marketplace sellers, zShops, or Auctions.
Why? Simple: Those people do their own shipping.
 Item availability times affect consolidation. You may have noticed
availability times listed on the detail page. They usually say something
like, “Availability: usually ships within 24 hours.” This little note affects
consolidation as follows: Items that ship within 3 days or fewer are con-
solidated and items that ship in more than 3 days are consolidated as
they become available. In other words, if one items ships in a week and
another in 3 weeks, they won’t make you wait 3 weeks so they can ship
them together.
 Items bought using the shopping cart won’t be consolidated with
items bought using 1-Click. Again, not sure why, but those are the rules.
 No consolidating with Super Saver. You can’t consolidate any orders
that are shipping for free under free Super Saver shipping. In other
words, no lumping an ineligible item with a Super Saver to score some
free shipping.

The More the
Merrier: The
Amazon.com
Community

In this part . . . 
T
here are more than 30 million people shopping at
Amazon.com. It may seem idealistic to think of people
who shop at the same store as a community, but they are.
And Amazon.com is no ordinary store.
Amazon breeds community. It brings people together in
the name of their shared passions — books, music, cook-
ing, gardening, woodworking, whatever — and lets them
share information about those passions (or at least infor-
mation about the products associated with those pas-
sions). Amazon also fosters that sense of community by
using the information they collect from the entire group to
point us individuals toward new products.
Any time you come to the site and make a purchase, you
are participating in the community. But there’s more to be
done at Amazon than just shop. In this part, I cover the
cool features this community has to offer and show you
how to get the most out of them. You get the lowdown on
how to become a real part of — and engage — the Amazon.

 Finding out how your shopping past affects your shopping future
 Navigating Your Store
 Getting the most from Your Recommendations
 Checking out The Page You Made
 Exploring other types of recommendations
You may not think you have anything in common with an accountant from
Cleveland, or an interior decorator from Taos, or a barista from Irvine —
and in the physical world, you may never cross paths with those people to find
out. But in the world of Amazon, any of them could be your shopping soul mate.
More than 37 million people are shopping at Amazon — and Amazon is col-
lecting data on every single one. They use that data in a host of different
ways, one of which is to point us shoppers to other products we might like.
But it’s not as simple as, “Hey, Mara! Read this book.” Amazon’s recommenda-
tion features are far more elaborate and hardworking than that. Best of all,
you don’t have to do anything but shop to take advantage of them. 
In this chapter, I cover all the cool recommendation features that Amazon
offers. I explain what they know about you and how they use it. I also show
you where to find your various recommendations and how to use some of the
features associated with them.
What Amazon Knows About You That
No One Else Knows (Revisited)
Amazon is not your all-knowing best friend. It doesn’t know that you secretly
yearn to be a professional ice dancer or an astronaut. Or that when you were

5 years old you put a button in your nose to see if it would come out the other
side. Or that sometimes you cry during dog-chow commercials. Amazon
doesn’t know any of that. But if you’ve shopped with them once, even if you
only gave them the required information, they do know a lot about who you
are and what you like.
Here’s what Amazon knows:
 Your name and shipping address. Because you gave it to them when
you filled out your info in the order pipeline.
 Your credit-card information and billing address. Because in order to
pay for your purchase you gave this to them as well.
 What you like. This they know because of where you looked when you
shopped, and because of what you ultimately bought.
 Who you like to send gifts to and what those people like. If you use
Amazon to send gifts, they remember that too.
It may seem obvious, but the nature of the Internet makes it easy to collect
information — so when you shop at Amazon, that’s what they’re doing.
They’re collecting information, saving it, and using it. That information can
be grouped into two categories: the info they collect as you shop and the
(more personal and lasting) info they collect when you buy.
As-you-shop information
You’re being watched. You may not even notice it, but as you click your way
through the pages of Amazon.com, a little shopping fairy is watching you.
That fairy (also known as “software” to those who created it) is taking note of
where you stop and what you look at — so before you even buy anything,
Amazon is tracking you and preparing recommendations.
You find this as-you-shop information put to use in two places:
 Your Recent History: This lives at the bottom of every page and travels
with you as you shop. It’s really just a log of the stores and items you’ve
looked at, and you can use it to access those places quickly and easily.
 The Page You Made: The Page You Made lives in Your Store (and I talk
more about both of these later in the chapter). This special category
page is a combination of the items you’ve looked at and related items —
updated in real time. So as you click around the store, The Page You
Made changes accordingly.

When-you-buy information
When you buy at Amazon, you’re not just improving your own recommenda-
tions, you’re adding to the information pool for the entire Amazon community.
As that information pool grows, everyone’s recommendations improve. It’s
the circle of shopping life; think of it as a public service of sorts.
Amazon uses your buying history for two purposes: to give you better recom-
mendations and to give the entire Amazon community better recommenda-
tions. They use your buying history to match you with other shoppers who
share your taste. They use it to recommend specific items. They use it to link
items on the site. Buying history is what makes Amazon a community rather
than just a store.
So very many places and features on the site are shaped by buying history —
and the best part is, you don’t have to do anything to take advantage of them.
All you have to do is shop and buy — and that’s easy.
Here are some features that are products of buying history:
 Recommendations: These are the granddaddies of Amazon personaliza-
tion features. The Big Kahuna of buying history put to use. Basically
what happens is this: You buy something, Amazon finds out who else
bought it, and then checks to see what other related things those people
bought. Then Amazon recommends the items that were the most popu-
lar. The more you buy, the more honed Your Recommendations become.
You can access your Recommendations any time by clicking on them in
the subnav of Your Store.
 Similarities: You may have noticed these on the detail pages of the site.
(You’ll also find them on your shopping cart page.) They fall under the
heading that begins, “Customers who shopped for this . . . ” (as in Figure
11-1) or “Customers who bought this.” Similarities function the same
way that Recommendations do: People buy an item, then Amazon finds
out what other related items those people bought and recommends the
items that were the most popular. But instead of being directed at you,
similarities are for everyone. 
 The Page You Made: Okay, I know I said The Page You Made was a
product of the as-you-shop information. It is, but it uses the community
buying history as well. You click around the store, and that’s how Amazon
decides what items to base your page on. Then they beef up the page by
using community buying history. It’s really a joint effort! You can access
The Page You Made either from the Welcome page (in the box on the
right side) or from the subnav of Your Store.
145
Chapter 11: It’s All About You! Cool Stuff That Happens Automatically

 Just Like You: This nifty little feature takes the whole recommendation
thing to a new level. Amazon reviews your buying history as a whole and
finds other shoppers with similar buying histories. You can access Just
Like You in the Browse box of Your Store under Your Community. There
is one caveat: you have to have enough buying history in order for
Amazon to find another customer Just Like You. How much? I can’t say,
but if you don’t find the link in Your Store, keep buying and check back
every so often. It’ll show up.
Your Very Own Store
As soon as you make one purchase at Amazon.com, you notice that a new tab
with your name on it appears in the main nav, right next to the Welcome tab.
It means you now have your very own store. It’s called (drum roll, please)
Your Store, and it’s even named after you. (For example, Figure 11-2 shows a
screen shot of my tab.) That tab will always be there and it’s how you access
Your Store.

So what is Your Store? It’s a collection of features and recommendations
based on your buying history and the related buying history of the Amazon
community — put in a store template so it looks like the rest of Amazon.com.
Check out my store “home page” in Figure 11-3.
What you find there: Subnav
You find lots of familiar things and a handful of new things in Your Store. What
you may notice first is that Your Store has a subnav unlike any other subnav
at Amazon.
Here’s what you can access through Your Store’s subnav:
 Your Favorite Stores: This is not just a series of links to the stores you
visit most often. This feature takes the stores you visit most often, con-
siders the kinds of things you buy there, throws in the community’s
buying history, and creates a unique “your favorite” kind of store. 
 Your Recommendations: This is the home for all your recommendations.
This is also where you can go to edit or change your recommendations.
 New For You: These are recommended new releases for all the categories
you’ve shopped.
 The Page You Made: This is where the Page You Made lives full time.
 Friends & Favorites: This is the part of the site that allows you to create
your own shopping network. (Check out Chapter 12 to find out more
about what you can do in Friends & Favorites.)

Chapter 11: It’s All About You! Cool Stuff That Happens Automatically

What you find there: Other goodies
Your Store is chock-full of good stuff and most of it can be accessed from the
subnav or from the Browse box on the left. But a few things that don’t live in
the subnav can only be accessed from the Browse box on the home page of
Your Store (as in Figure 11-4):
 Just Like You: Here’s where you get anonymously hooked up with a
shopper who shares your taste. You find the link to Just Like You in the
Browse box under the heading, Your Community.
 Your Lifestyle: Another form of recommendation, Your Lifestyle breaks
into three categories — work, home, and play — and then offers up
products you might like or need accordingly. You find it in the Browse
box under the More To Explore heading.
 Sell Your Collection: Because Amazon records your shopping history,
they also know some of the items you own that you might want to sell.
Sell your Collection is a log of everything you’ve ever bought at Amazon,
its used-price value, and a link to the appropriate marketplace selling
area of the site. You find this feature in the Browse box under the More
To Explore heading.
Changing your store’s name
It’s true. You can change the name of Your Store and put your personal mark on
the Internet. But there are rules. You only get to pick the first word (the second
will be “store”) and you can only use up to eight characters for the first word.
In other words, I can’t change my store’s name to “Mara’s Nasty Habit” because
Figure 11-4:
The Browse
box in Your
Store is a
good place
to access
certain
special
features.
148
Part III: The More the Merrier: The Amazon.com Community 

(a) that’s too many characters and (b) that name doesn’t include the word
“store.” But I could change it to, “Queenbee Store,” and I just might.
You can’t change the name of Your Store without changing your Amazon
screen name — they’re one and the same. This isn’t the name associated with
shipping and billing, but it’s the name they use to greet you, it’s the name
that shows up in your public info, and so on. So make sure you choose some-
thing that you don’t mind looking at and that you wouldn’t mind other people
seeing (or calling you by).
Here’s how to change the name of Your Store:
1. Click the Your Store tab on the main nav to get to Your Store and then
click the Edit Name link.
You find the Edit Name link at the top of the page, directly underneath
Your Store’s current name. If you’re not already signed in, you’re taken
to a sign-in screen.
2. Sign in by entering your password in the field provided and then
clicking the Sign in Using Our Secure Server button.
You come to a screen that looks like Figure 11-5. You notice that you can
also change your e-mail address and password of record here. Don’t do
that unless you want to. It’s not required.
3. Enter your new name in the field provided and click the Submit
Changes button.
A confirmation screen tells you that you’ve successfully changed your
account. If you click any of the nav items, you notice that Your Store has
its new name!

Your Favorite Stores
Your Favorite Stores is a good place to discover stuff at Amazon.com. You
can access it by clicking on it in the subnav of Your Store. It’s similar to Your
Recommendations — many things there were chosen to reflect your buying
history as it relates to the group buying history. This collection of items also
includes popular things from the stores that you shop regularly.
The Your Favorite Stores home page looks a lot like Figure 11-6. It’s really just
a selection (about six) of your favorites and some corresponding products in
the form of recommendations or features such as More to Explore. You’ll
notice that you can access more favorites from the Browse box on the left
side of the page. 
When you click one of your favorite stores, you come to that particular Favorite
Stores page. Each favorite store shows up on-screen in a category-page tem-
plate, which looks like Figure 11-7. Somehow this makes it more fun — it feels
more like your own store. You find your favorite categories and subcategories
in the Browse box, as well as sections like New Releases, Top Sellers, and so on.
If you go to Your Favorite Stores and find they aren’t really tickling your
fancy, you can edit them. Here’s how to do that:
1. Click the See All Favorites link in the Browse box on Your Favorite
Stores home page.
It’s a mystery to me that this is the right link, but it is. You come to the
Favorite Stores edit page, which has a series of categories and subcate-
gories next to corresponding check boxes.

2. In the Favorite Stores edit page, click the boxes next to the subjects
that interest you.
You notice that the list is broken down by store — and that the bottom
of the page offers you Other Stores. Okay, these aren’t currently the
stores you shop — not yet. But if you want to add them to your
favorites, you can click the appropriate boxes. 
If there are categories within a store that you’d like as a part of your
Favorite Stores, but that aren’t there, don’t dismay. Adding them is a bit
tricky (or, at least, unintuitive) but possible. What you need to do is add
them into your Recommendations when you select your favorite areas
(see the next section of this chapter for more on this). Once you do this,
they’ll show up in your Favorite Stores.
3. Still in the Favorite Stores edit page, click the boxes to uncheck items
that you want excluded from your favorites, and then click the Submit
button.
After you submit your changes, you come to a page that looks like Figure
11-8. It’s basically the Favorite Stores edit page all over again, but with a
personalized message at the top. If you want to continue to edit, repeat
Steps 1 through 3. If you’re finished, move on to Step 4.
4. Click the Your Store link in the personal message.
This takes you back to Your Favorite Stores home page, where you
notice that your editing has already been taken into account.

Recommendations 101
The Your Recommendations page is always being updated — not only by
you (when you buy), but also by the shopping community as their habits
change — and you can access Your Recommendations from either the
Welcome page greeting or from the subnav on the Your Store page.
From the vantage point of the Your Recommendations page, you notice a
variety of ways to view Your Recommendations. You can look at them by
favorites, by store, by bargains, or by used items. To do that, just click the
appropriate link in the Browse box.
If your recommendations aren’t inspiring, you can improve them to make them
more accurate. There is an Improve Your Recommendations box — looking a
lot like Figure 11-9 — right there on the Your Recommendations page.
There are three ways to improve your recommendations. You can “edit your
Amazon history” by rating items you’ve bought or excluding them from your
recommendations altogether. You can “select your favorite areas” by choos-
ing the stores (and the categories within them) that interest you. And you
can rate items you already own, but didn’t necessarily buy at Amazon, by
searching for and then rating them.
If you click the Improve Your Recommendations link in the Improve Your
Recommendations box, you’re asked to sign in, and to confirm that you want
to improve your recommendations. Then you’re taken to the general Improve
Your Recommendations page, where you can access any of the three choices.

Here’s how to edit your Amazon history:
1. From the Your Recommendations page, click the Edit Your Amazon
History link in the Improve Your Recommendations box.
If you’re already signed in to your account, you are taken directly to the
Edit Your History page. If not, you come to a sign-in screen.
2. Sign in by entering your password in the field provided and clicking
the Sign In button.
Unlike other sign-ins, this sign-in takes you to an acknowledgment screen.
3. Click the Continue button.
You come to the Edit Your History page. You notice the Edit Your Info
box on the left side of the page. The default setting for the Edit Your
History page is Items You Own.
4. Choose the items you’d like to edit in the Edit Your Info box.
5. Rate each item by clicking the appropriate number value.
You can give each item a rating that ranges from a question mark to 5. As
you probably guessed, 5 is the best and “?” is the default for items
you’ve bought but haven’t yet rated. You should also choose the ques-
tion mark if (for some reason) you don’t feel you can rate the item.
6. Check or uncheck the appropriate box to determine if that item will
be used to make recommendations.
You find the Use To Make Recommendations option underneath the
number ratings.
Items purchased as gifts do not offer this option.
7. Click the Save or Save and Continue button at the bottom of the page.
If you have more than 25 items in the list of items you’re rating, you will
click the Save and Continue button to move to the next page. However,
you don’t have to rate every item. Whenever you’re finished, just click the
Save or Save and Continue button to have Amazon record your changes.

8. Use the site nav to exit the Edit Your History section.
There is no “You’re Finished” page in the Edit Your History section. You
decide when you’re finished. At any point in the process, you can save
your changes and leave the area by using the main nav.
Here’s how to select your favorite areas:
1. From the Your Recommendations page, click the Select Your Favorite
Areas link in the Improve Your Recommendations box.
If you’re already signed in to your account, you’re taken directly to the
Select Favorite Stores page. If not, you come to a Sign-In screen.
2. Sign in by entering your password in the field provided and clicking
the Sign In button.
This sign-in takes you to an acknowledgment screen.
3. Click the Continue button.
You come to the first page of the Select Your Favorite Areas section.
Notice the graphic at the top of the page — right there below the bread-
crumb trail — that shows you where you are in the 4-step process.
4. Check the stores that interest you and then click the Continue button.
In addition to checking the check boxes for stores that interest you, be
sure to deselect the boxes for any stores you don’t find — or no longer
find — interesting. If a particular store strikes you as pretty dull but it has
a check mark in its box, click the box to make that check mark disappear.
5. In the new page that appears, check the categories that interest you
and then click the Continue button.
For each store you chose in the previous step, you’re offered a separate
page of category choices. If (for example) you chose three stores in Step 4,
you have three pages of category choices to work through. When you’ve
completed your last page and clicked Continue, you come to the Add
Details page.
6. In the Add Details page, enter the requested information in the fields
provided and click Continue.
For each store you chose in Step 4, you’re asked to enter one favorite or
Soon To Be Purchased item. So if you chose four stores in Step 4, you
have to fill in four fields — one for each store.
7. Choose the appropriate number rating for each item, check the box if
you own the item, and click Rate More Items or Finish.
Amazon displays items from each store you’ve chosen based on the
information you give them in Steps 4 through 6. If you’re unfamiliar with
an item, leave it as a question mark. If you click Rate More Items, Amazon
will simply offer up another list. You can rate as many items as you like.
When you do hit Finish, you’re taken back to the Your Store home page
with your recommendation changes recorded.
154
Part III: The More the Merrier: The Amazon.com Community 

You can also change your recommendations by rating items you already own.
These don’t have to be items that you purchased at Amazon, just items that
are in their catalog. You locate them by searching for them from the Your
Recommendations feature itself (as opposed to using the Search box).
Here’s how to rate items you already own:
1. From the Your Recommendations page, click the Rate Items You Own
link in the Improve Your Recommendations box.
If you’re already signed in to your account, you are taken directly to the
general Improve Your Recommendations page — Figure 11-10 gives you
an idea what it looks like. If not, you come to a sign-in screen.
2. Sign in by entering your password in the field provided and clicking
the Sign In button.
This particular sign-in takes you to an acknowledgment screen.
3. Click the Continue button.
You come to the general Improve Your Recommendations page. Unlike
the other two recommendation features, there is no beginning page for
this feature.
4. Enter the item you’d like to rate in the field provided, use the drop-
down menu to narrow your search, and click Continue.
You come to a page that offers up search results along with rating
options. You may not find an exact match, so be sure to enter solid key-
words when initiating your search. (See Chapter 8 for more on key-
words.) If your search is fairly nonspecific, you are given search results
per store with the option to view all the results from that store.

5. Choose the appropriate number rating for each item, check the box if
you own the item, and click Save and Continue.
You will be taken back to the general Improve Your Recommendations
page, but there will be a personal message at the top acknowledging
your changes.
You can also improve your recommendation item by item. On every detail
page, you’ll see a box on the left side of the page called “Rate this item.”
(You’ll have to scroll a bit to find it.) Use it to tell Amazon how much you like
that item and that info will be incorporated into your recommendations.
Amazon on Line 1: Your Message Center
You may not have noticed that you have a message center on Amazon.com,
but you do. Every customer with an account also has a message center. (Mine
looks like Figure 11-11.) You can access it from the New For You box on the
Welcome page or from the New For You section of Your Store.
So what is it? You know that Amazon isn’t much for spam. So this is basically
a way for them to tell you about new products that you might like without
having to spam you. The messages in your message center are generated
based on your shopping history and any other information you’ve given
Amazon about stuff you like. They’re basically recommendations in the form
of a “message.” You are under no obligation to ever look at them, and they
will disappear from your message center 30 days after they show up.
Occasionally, something interesting crops up.

It’s easy to get rid of unwanted messages in your message center. To delete
messages, simply click the boxes to check the message you want to get rid of
and click the Delete button. Your message center will reflect the change
immediately.
The Page You Made Without Even Trying
Anyone who tells you shopping isn’t productive is lying. When you shop at
Amazon, you are secretly hard at work. You are busy making a page that you
can then visit to do more shopping.
The Page You Made is one of the coolest features at Amazon. It’s a collection
of the places you’ve shopped mixed with some recommendations based on
the products you looked at all wrapped up in a neat little store-like page. And
it’s all built in real time. So if you start shopping now, in about five minutes
you have made a page.
You can access The Page You Made from the subnav of Your Store. It will look
something like Figure 11-12 — The Page I Made while shopping at Amazon
today.
Your Recent History on steroids
The Page You Made is like Your Recent History (Chapter 2) on steroids (but I
mean that in a good way). While Your Recent History tracks where you’ve been
Figure 11-12:
The Page
You Made
collects
information
and builds in
real time.
157
Chapter 11: It’s All About You! Cool Stuff That Happens Automatically

and presents it to you in shorthand — by products, categories, and searches —
The Page You Made takes that information and beefs it up. When you poke
around the site, you are creating a shopping profile — a quick picture of what
you’re interested in. Amazon takes that profile and uses it to build a mini
store just for you. In some ways, The Page You Made is like Your Recent
History on steroids but before it got so big that it became Your Store.
Here’s what you find on The Page You Made:
 Recently Viewed Items: You find this series of product links in the blue
box at the top left. This is the nerve center of The Page You Made
because these are the products you actually looked at — the products
on which the rest of the page is based.
 Featured Item: This sits right next to the recently viewed items on the
page — if it’s there at all. The Featured Item is something that fits your
shopping profile and that’s also been getting some attention on the site.
If nothing fits the bill, you won’t have a featured item.
 More to Explore: Here Amazon takes some of the items you’ve looked
at, finds people who bought those items, and shows you other relevant
items that those people bought. 
 Quick Picks: These are more products that fit your profile.
 Listmania: Amazon has a feature that lets customers put together their
own lists of products. It’s called Listmania and I talk more about it in
Chapter 12. Here Amazon includes several Listmania lists that fit your
profile.
 Explore Related Categories: These are handy links to other categories
that might interest you but that you haven’t visited in this shopping trip.
(Because, remember, The Page You Made happens in real time so it
doesn’t take into account any of your shopping past.)
Don’t want it? Turn it off
Some people don’t like The Page You Made. These are the stealth shoppers
who prefer anonymity. They shop in the shadows, preferring the cover of
nightfall. (Either that, or they’re husbands shopping for gifts for their occa-
sionally nosy wives.) If you’re one of those, you can easily turn off The Page
You Made.
Here’s how to do that:
1. Go to Your Store and click The Page You Made in the subnav.
You come to The Page you Made and there will be a paragraph of text at
the top that welcomes you and explains a little bit about this feature. At
the end of that paragraph is a link that says, Learn more.

You will now find yourself at the help-like Learn More page that looks
like Figure 11-13. There’s a longer explanation of what The Page You
Made is all about (and an on/off button) in the upper-right corner.
3. Click the Turn Off button.
You will remain on the same page, but the button will have changed from
a Turn Off to a Turn On. Now if you go to Your Store and then click The
Page You Made, you’re taken directly to the Learn More page.
If you want to turn the feature back on, simply click the Turn On button from
the Learn More page. But don’t be alarmed when The Page You Made is empty.
When you turn the feature off, your data is lost and you’re starting from
scratch. Spend a few minutes shopping, and you have a brand new page.
Finding Your E-Commerce Twin
I have certain friends who I trust to recommend good books, movies, products,
and so on. I’d say that seven out of ten times I like what they suggest. But those
three times, those misses, can be a little painful. And frankly, I have unusual
taste. I loved Moby Dick and Old School. I listen to Wham! and to The Flaming
Lips. And to tell you the truth, I’ve felt a little bit alone. Like a shopping island.
But Amazon knows that no woman is an island. They know that there is some-
one out there that likes the same things I like — and they’ve matched us up.

You too have a shopping doppelgänger and Amazon knows who it is. In fact,
you probably have several kindred shopping spirits and you can tap into
them through Amazon’s Just Like You feature.
You have to have enough shopping history for Amazon to make a match. If you
don’t, you won’t find a Just Like You link in Your Store. Don’t lose the faith! Keep
shopping and eventually Amazon will match you with your shopping soul mate.
How Just Like You works
Just Like You is a feature that matches you with other customers who bought
or rated several of the same products you’ve bought or rated. It’s totally
anonymous, so you don’t see any of their personal info and they don’t see
yours, and it allows you to view 25 of their most recent purchases. (Which, of
course, may be tempting for you because these people are Just Like You.)
Just Like You is something of a buried treasure. You can access it only from
the Browse box on the home page of Your Store. You find it under the Your
Community heading, below the fold.
Like all personal areas of Amazon.com, Just Like You is protected. So when
you click the link in the Your Store Browse box, you’re asked to sign in to
your account (unless you’re already signed in). Just enter your password in
the field provided and you’re taken to your Just Like You page.
Odds are your Just Like You page looks something like mine (shown in Figure
11-14), though it’s perfectly okay if your interests are different. I mean, it’s a
free country. Honest.

Here’s a quick anatomy of what you find on the page:
 The Intro. You find this at the top center of the page. It tells you a tiny
bit about the person who is “just like you.” Sometimes it tells you where
that person is from (Arizona, New York, Uranus, and so on); other times
it just says, “an Amazon.com customer.” But you knew that.
 The Drop-Down Menu. You can use the drop-down menu to sort the 25
products you’re looking at by store.
 Left Column. This column shows the items that both of you own or have
rated positively.
 Middle Column. In the middle area you find the items that the customer
like you owns or likes but that you don’t own (as far as Amazon knows).
These entries are essentially recommendations.
 Right column. On the right are items only you own. You can use this as a
reference point to identify where your tastes don’t overlap.
 Next Customer button. You find this at the top right of the right column.
You thought there was just one customer like you? Au contraire! There
are several and you can use this button to see them all, one by one. You
notice that once you move past the first page another button will appear
at the top left. Use the Previous Customer button to get back to cus-
tomers you’ve already looked at.
 Next and Previous. At the bottom of the page, but above the Bottom of
the Page Deals, you find the links that will get you to the second chunk
of products owned by your Just like You customer. (See Figure 11-15.)
Click Next to access the rest of that customer’s products.
How to turn it off

1. Click the Just Like You link in the Browse box of Your Store.
If you aren’t already signed in, you’re asked to.
2. Sign in by entering your password in the field provided and clicking
the Sign In Using Our Secure Server button.
You will come to your Just Like You page. At the top of the page, under-
neath the customer info, is a sentence that says, “How do we deter-
mine customers ‘just like you’? Learn more.”
3. Click the Learn More link at the top of the page.
You’re transferred to a page in the Help Department. (Check the bread-
crumb trail to locate yourself if you want.) The Just Like You on/off
button is at the bottom of the page.
4. Click the Turn Off button at the bottom of the page.
You will remain on the same page, but the button will have changed from
a Turn Off button to a Turn On button. Now if you go to Your Store and
then click Just Like You, you’re taken directly to the Just Like You page
in the Help Department.
To turn Just Like You back on, go to Your Store and click the Just Like you
link in the Browse box. You’re taken to the Just Like You page in the Help
Department. Just click the Turn On button at the bottom of the page.
Because Just Like You is fueled by buying history, whereas The Page You
Made is built on immediate shopping or clicking activity, Just Like You saves
all your data so the page will still be fully stocked.
One Man’s Treasure Is Another Man’s . . .
Treasure?
One of the most basic and most common things that Amazon does to help
customers find products is identify similar products. Amazon calls this fea-
ture, fittingly enough, Similarities. 
Similarities are basically open-ended recommendations. While Your
Recommendations focus on you and your buying history, Similarities are
product focused and use everyone’s buying history. They start with a prod-
uct, find all the people who bought that product, and then find the most pop-
ular other things that those people bought. 
162
Part III: The More the Merrier: The Amazon.com Community 

You’ll notice that Similarities show up all over the site, but their most common
spot is on the detail page. You may have noticed them sandwiched between the
product image and the customer reviews. Figure 11-16 shows the Similarities
for Ebay For Dummies.
You notice that Amazon identifies both other books and recommendations
for other products. If you click the Explore Similar Items link, you’re taken to
a cornucopia of Similarities goodness (as in Figure 11-17). Scroll through the
page and do a little exploring. Some products they recommend are closely
related to the original item you looked at; others are totally unrelated — just
other stuff that people liked. You can even use the drop-down list to sort
items according to how closely they’re related to the original item.

A
mazon.com is interactive, and not just because you click buttons and
things happen. It’s truly interactive — the way only a real community
can be. You can give and receive information along with thousands of other
people through Amazon.com. You can create your own personalized area.
You can generate lists that live publicly on the site. You can include your
friends and family in your Amazon experience. You don’t just have to be a
“user” at Amazon. You can also be a participant.
Amazon is a place that encourages you to put your two cents in. Now most
people who use Amazon know that they let you write reviews of the things
they sell, but I’m guessing that not that many people know that reviews are
just the tip of the iceberg. (And only about 1 million of their 37 million cus-
tomers actually write them.) There are many more “community” features at
Amazon.com. You just have to dig a little to find them.
In this chapter, I show you how to write your first customer review, help you
set up your Friends & Family area, and walk you through your first Listmania
list. I also cover Share the Love and Purchase Circles. I show you how to take
advantage of these “community” features so you can make the most of your
Amazon shopping adventure.

Loved It? Hated It? Writing
Customer Reviews
Customer reviews have been a part of Amazon.com since (almost) the very
beginning and including the customer review feature on the site was a stroke
of genius. Remember, Amazon launched as an online bookstore in the mid-
90s. That was just after man discovered fire, but before every preteen on
earth owned a cell phone — people were still very wary of this thing they
called “the Net.” But allowing customers to put their opinions on the site dis-
pelled some of the suspicion. What better way to get the straight scoop on
whether something was good or not? And what better way to give to people a
sense of ownership in the site?
More than eight years later, there are several million reviews on the site. Ask
any of those devout Amazon users, and they tell you that they never buy from
Amazon without first checking the reviews. If you spend some time on the site,
you start to recognize reviewers by name — especially the goods ones. Spend
enough time writing reviews yourself and you may become one of them.
What you can and can’t say
Though anyone with an Amazon account can write a review, there is some
protocol involved, because after all, reviews are supposed to help other
shoppers make a buying decision.
Amazon is pretty laissez faire about what you can say. A good Amazon review
focuses on the specifics — product features, a book’s content, and so on. A
good review is also meaty. Don’t just praise or condemn; explain why you like
or dislike something. This is your chance to pipe up, so use it!
Amazon is much more particular about what you can’t say. Here’s the list:
 No potty mouth. This includes both foul language and general mean-
ness. Amazon is not a place to slam that fourth-grade bully who some-
how ended up writing a book.
 No one-word reviews. Remember, reviews are there to help people. So if
you just say, “rocks!” or “sucks!” you’re not really doing that.
 No giving it away. This applies to books, DVDs, and videos, of course.
You will not be a popular reviewer if you give out the ending. This is called
a “spoiler,” and if you do it, Amazon will pull your review from the site.
 No personal contact info. I don’t know why anyone would want to give
out info such as personal phone number, e-mail address, or mailing
address to 37 million strangers. But if you’ve got a yen to do it, refrain —
it’s against the rules.
166
Part III: The More the Merrier: The Amazon.com Community 

 No competitive shopping info. Hey, everyone, even Amazon, wants to
protect his or her turf. So Amazon doesn’t allow you to advertise its
competitors on its site.
 No trolling for good votes. As an author, I can understand the temptation
to solicit Amazon’s massive customer base to boost my sales ranking, but,
alas, it’s just not kosher.
 No commenting on other reviews on the page. I admit that I have occa-
sionally enjoyed witnessing a review spat. There’s nothing like a public
forum and a little anonymity to make people feisty. But that’s not what
this forum is for — and besides, really useless reviews are regularly
dropped from the site. So no matter how insane a review looks to you,
don’t comment on it. You may be referring to some aspect of it that’s not
actually there (and then, guess what, you look like the nut job).
How to write your first review
Writing a review isn’t as challenging as writing a good review. You can review
any product at Amazon in just a few minutes, but you have to have an
Amazon.com account. If you aren’t signed in to your account, they ask you to
sign in before allowing you to write a review. So, assuming you have an
account, and you’re signed in, here’s how to do it:
1. Go to the detail page of the product you want to review.
Once you’re there, you need to scroll down below the Editorial Reviews
to where the Customer or Spotlight Reviews begin.
2. Click the Write an Online Review link.
If you’re not already signed in, you’re taken to a sign-in screen. Enter
your e-mail address and password and click the Sign In button. On the
next screen, click the Continue button. Once you’re signed in, you’re
taken to that item’s review page, which will look something like Figure
12-1. If you’re younger than 13 years, use the kid’s review form. (The link
for that is at the top of the page.)
3. Use the drop-down menu to select the number of stars that you want
to give the item.
5 stars is the highest rating; 1 is the lowest. If you’re reviewing a toy,
you’ll get to rate it three ways: how fun it is, how educational it is, and
how durable it is.
4. Enter the title for your review in the field provided.
It’s not necessary, but it’s nice to give your title a little bit of substance.
5. Type your review in the field provided.
Remember the rules. No swearing. No giving away the ending. And try to
be helpful in 1,000 words or less.
167
Chapter 12: Putting Your Two Cents In: Reviews, Lists, & Cool Features

6. Click the appropriate option to choose whether or not to display your
screen name with your review.
Amazon will offer two choices: You can display your review with your
screen name (that’s the name they use to greet you) or you can remain
anonymous.
7. Enter the name of your city in the field provided and click the
Preview Your Review button.
Telling them where you’re from is actually optional. Stars, a title, and a
review are not optional and if you forget to do one of them and click the
Preview Your Review button, you’re taken to a screen that looks like
Figure 12-2. The missing info shows up in bold, red font. Just enter the
missing piece and click the Preview Your Review button again. You’re
taken to a page that shows your review as it will look on the site. Make
sure it looks the way you want it to. If you need to change it, you can
click the Edit button to get back to your review page.
8. Check your review thoroughly and click Save.
The last page in the process thanks you and confirms that your review
was submitted. It may also ask you to enter some information to build or
update your About You area. This is 100 percent optional. Do it if you
like — no harm will come of it — but don’t feel obligated. You’ve written
your first review and you are free to return to shopping!
Reviews can be fun to write, but don’t expect immediate fame and glory. It
takes some time for your review to go live on the site. Amazon gives them-
selves a 5-to-7 day window. More often than not, it’s up there in a couple of
hours, but you won’t be able to write it and then immediately go check it out.
Patience, Grasshopper, patience.

When you’ve written a review and submitted it, you are agreeing to Amazon’s
terms and conditions. One key thing to note is that your review becomes
their property and they can use it as they like. That means that it might show
up on other sites on the web. For example, both AOL and Target use
Amazon’s reviews on their sites.
Was the review helpful?
Not only are we allowed to review items, but we’re also allowed to vote on
whether other people’s reviews were good. You may have noticed that under-
neath each review is a sentence that says, “Was this review helpful to
you?” — and then you get to click a Yes or No button to vote on reviews.
When you do so, you come to a screen that looks like Figure 12-3.
Amazon counts the votes and posts them above the review. This tally helps
you determine which reviews to take seriously and which you may be able to
disregard.
The Top Reviewers
You may have noticed that some customer reviews have little icons next to
them that look like the icon in Figure 12-4. These are the proud, the few, the
Top Reviewers.
Figure 12-2:
The
“whoops”

Chapter 12: Putting Your Two Cents In: Reviews, Lists, & Cool Features

Top Reviewers are (according to the opinions of other customers) the best
reviewers at Amazon.com. In addition to the Top Reviewer icon, you may also
have noticed that you can vote on whether a review was helpful — and that
vote is how Top Reviewers are born. Theirs are the reviews deemed most
helpful, most often, by other Amazon customers.
There are six classes of Top Reviewers: Top 1,000, Top 500, Top 100, Top 50,
Top 10 and the reviewer’s reviewer, El Numero Uno. Today, the number-one
reviewer at Amazon.com is Harriet Klausner, a former acquisitions librarian
who has written 5,617 reviews and gotten 34,701 “helpful” votes. (And all I
can say about that is “Oh, my God.”)
So what can you do to become a Top Reviewer? Write good reviews for popu-
lar items and hope that people find them helpful and vote accordingly. You
can check on the status of the Top Reviewers list from the Friends & Family
section of Your Store. You find a link to the list in the Explore browse box on
the left side of the page. But I warn you, Harriet is going to be tough to
unseat.

And another thing: customer advice
There is yet another way to give your fellow shoppers a hand. In the last year
or so, Amazon has introduced a feature called Our Customers’ Advice. It lives
on the detail page just above the Editorial Reviews. (See Figure 12-5.)
Customer Advice is actually a recommendation. Say you own a digital camera.
You love it, but it only has enough room for two print-quality pictures. You
might recommend that other shoppers buy it along with a new memory card.
With Customers Advice, you can suggest that people buy something in addi-
tion to — or instead of — the item shown on the detail page. To do that, you
have to know what the ASIN or ISBN is for your recommended item (and, of
course, you have to recommend something that Amazon sells). 
What are ASINs and ISBNs? An ASIN is something that Amazon made up. It
stands for Amazon Standard Information Number and it’s a multidigit code
used to identify products. Each product on the site has a unique ASIN, unless
it’s a book and then it has an ISBN. ISBN numbers are the industry-standard
ID for every published book that’s in the Library of Congress.
To find your recommended product’s ASIN or ISBN, just go to that item’s detail
page. The number is in the section of the page called Product Details (or some-
times Product Information). (Figure 12-6 shows the eBay For Dummies ISBN.)
ISBNs or ASINs are found here.
Figure 12-6:

(or in place
of) the item

page.
171
Chapter 12: Putting Your Two Cents In: Reviews, Lists, & Cool Features

After you’ve found the ASIN or ISBN for your recommendation, you’re ready
to give some customer advice. Here’s how you do it:
1. Go to the item’s detail page where you want your recommendation to
live.
In other words, this is the item you’re commenting on, not the additional
(or “in place of”) item you’re recommending. When you get there, scroll
down below the product information until you reach the Our Customers’
Advice header.
2. Click the Recommend an Item link.
You’re taken to a page that looks remarkably like the detail page you just
came from. Scroll a tiny bit, though, and you see the advice field.
3. Enter the ASIN or ISBN of the item you want to recommend in the
field provided.
The easiest way to do this is to copy and paste.
4. Click the appropriate circle to choose whether to recommend it in
addition to or instead of the item on the detail page.
5. Click the Submit button.
If you’re not already signed in, you’re taken to a sign-in screen. Enter
your e-mail address and password and click the Sign In button. On the
next screen, click the Continue button. Once you’re signed in, your rec-
ommendation is submitted. You’ll notice an Important Message box on
the detail page, acknowledging your recommendation. Notice, too, that
it will take a day or so for your recommendation to be posted.
If you find some Customer Advice that is completely misguided and bizarre,
you can actually do something about it. You may have noticed that at the
bottom of the Customer Advice section there is a line that says “Let us
know if any of these recommendations are inappropriate.”
Click on the Let Us Know and a series of No buttons will show up next to each
piece of Customer Advice. Click on the No button for the wonky advice, and
you’ll be alerting the appropriate editorial team. If they agree with you, they’ll
remove the advice from the site within a week or so. If not, it stays, but at
least you put your two cents in.
Shopping with the Ones You Love
Shopping at Amazon.com can be something of a family affair if you choose to
make it that way. Amazon has lots of features that you can use to loop people
in to your shopping experience — review writing, list creation, registries, and
so on. — and all those cool features have one thing in common: They have a
home in your Friends & Favorites area.
172
Part III: The More the Merrier: The Amazon.com Community 

You find your Friends & Favorites area in Your Store. To get there, click the
Friends & Favorites link — it’s the last item on the subnav. When you first
start out at Amazon, your Friends & Favorites looks a little bare. But as you
shop and participate in the community, your Friends & Favorites fattens up
(so to speak) to offer a bounty of fun extras.
But before you create your Friends & Favorites, you should know the differ-
ence between a “friend” and a “favorite.”
 Amazon Friend. At Amazon.com, an Amazon Friend is someone who has
access to the private view of your About You area. You have to create
your About You area, and it may contain personal information such as
your e-mail address. You determine who your Amazon Friends are, so
you don’t have to worry about suddenly having “friends” you don’t want
(spammers, troglodytes, your 6th grade boyfriend) know too much.
 Favorite People. Favorite People at Amazon are also people you select,
but they don’t have access to your private About You area. Typically,
they’re people whose opinions you trust; when you pick them, Amazon
uses any reviews they’ve written to populate your Friends & Favorites
page.
In short, Friends have access to your About You Area; Favorites don’t.
Friends & Favorites highlights
Friends & Favorites is the roosting place for lots of the personalization fea-
tures offered at Amazon.com. For the record, most of those features also
have other homes on the site, but Friends & Favorites is an easy way to revel
in their glory because they’re all in one place.
In the beginning, before you add to it, your Friends & Favorites area will look
something like Figure 12-7. In it, you find all kinds of goodies:
 An invitation to get started. In the center of the page you find three
blocks of text. The first invites you to create your About You area, the
second invites you to create a Wish List, and the third invites you to find
and add people to your Favorites list (this third is actually a repeat of
the search box that only shows up on this Starter page — see the next
bullet). 
 A special Search box. It’s true that there’s a Search box at the top left of
every page, but the one in your Friends & Favorites area lets you search
for people. By this I mean that you can search for other Amazon cus-
tomers who may have public profiles, wish lists, registries, and so on.
You can search by name, nickname, or e-mail address.
173
Chapter 12: Putting Your Two Cents In: Reviews, Lists, & Cool Features

 The master list of cool personalization features. You find these on the
left side of the page in the Explore box. This really is the most convenient
catalog of all that’s cool and free and personal on Amazon.com.
 Friends & Favorites management tools. Below the fold is a very important
box. It’s the Manage Your Friends & Favorites box — the easiest (but of
course not the only) access you have to these management/editing links.
After you’ve spent some time with your Friends & Favorites, it’ll look more
like mine (as in Figure 12-8) and some new things will appear on the page:
 Content based on stuff you picked. In the center of the page you find an
assortment of content based on the information you’ve entered in your
Friends & Favorites area. In Figure 12-8, you notice that I have a review
from one of my Favorite People and some Purchase Circle content based
on where I live. (I talk more about Purchase Circles later in the chapter.)
 Your Favorite People list. This you have to create, but after you do, it’s
conveniently located on the left side of the page below the Explore box.
 A list of the things you’re participating in at Amazon. This is also
known as the Your Participation box; you’ll find it on the right side of the
page just below the nav. If you’ve set up a registry, written a review, cre-
ated a list, done anything Amazon-ey, it shows up in this box and you
can access it by clicking the link.

Tell me about yourself: Creating and 
building your About You area
Your About You area is your own little Amazon club house — your own space
on the site that could include a profile, a wish list, a photo, and so on. Before
you can beef up your About You area, you have to create it. Here’s how:
1. Go to your Friends & Favorites area by clicking the link in the subnav
of Your Store.
You notice a bevy of solicitations to create your About You area. Any will
work.
2. Click the Create Your About You Area link. 
Any time you’re trying to access what can be considered private infor-
mation, Amazon asks you to sign in. So when you try to access your
About You area, you’re taken to a sign-in screen.
3. Enter your e-mail address and password in the fields provided and
click the Sign In Using Our Secure Server button.
You will come to a confirmation screen.
4. Click the Continue button.
You come to a page that looks like Figure 12-9. After you complete it, you
have a functioning About You area. From there, you can edit and add to
it to make it more your own.
Figure 12-8:

175
Chapter 12: Putting Your Two Cents In: Reviews, Lists, & Cool Features

5. Enter a name and nickname in the fields provided.
Because you’ve gotta have an account before you can have an About
You area, Amazon already knows your name — and will use it as the
default here. You can change it if you like, but any new name can’t have
more than 50 characters. As for nicknames, Amazon automatically gives
you one (mine was mara3363 — very Blade Runner). You can change this
as well. 
Nicknames are always public in your About You area — you can make
your actual name private and viewable only by Amazon Friends.
6. Choose your identity status by clicking the appropriate circle.
The thing to keep in mind here is that your “name” and “nickname” are
whatever you entered in the fields provided. They’re not necessarily
your real name or real nickname (unless, of course, you want total
strangers to know you as “Private Sassy Pants”). That said, the choices
grow more private as you move down the list. So if you’re a very private
person, choose the third option.
7. Choose your e-mail status by clicking the appropriate circle.
Again, the choices grow more private as you move down the list. If you
want more privacy, choose the second option.
8. Enter a description of yourself in the field provided and click the
Submit button.
Here’s your chance to get personal. You’ve got 4,000 characters to tell
people about yourself (that’s about 300 words). Remember, you can
choose to make this viewable only by Friends.

Once you hit that Submit button, you’re taken to your About You area. Now
it’s time to spruce the place up a bit. Here are the things you can add to your
About You area:
 A photo. To upload a photo to your About You area, you just click the Add
an Image Here link and then paste the URL for your photo in the field
provided. But (and this is a pretty big but) it necessitates you posting a
photo somewhere on the Web first in order for that photo to have a URL.
If this is too techy for you, you can use one of the “zany” images that
Amazon provides. You find these when you click that Add Image link.
 A Wish List. When you create a Wish List, it shows up in your About You
area. (To find out how to create one, check out Chapter 13.)
 A Listmania List. Listmania lists are thematic lists of products that you
(and any other customer) can create. They also appear in your About
You area and you can find out how to create one later in this chapter.
 A So You’d Like To . . . guide. These are user-created how-to guides.
They, too, find a home in your About You area and you can discover how
to create one later in the chapter.
 Friends. Now that you’ve got an About You area, you can invite Amazon
Friends to come check it out. (Adding friends to your list is a good, and
somewhat subtle, way to get them to look at your Wish List.)
Enough about you: Adding Friends and
Favorite People
A quick review: Friends can view your private stuff, Favorite People can’t, but
Amazon will use your Favorite People to populate your Friends & Family area
with content you appreciate.
Friends
Adding Friends is marvelously simple. You can do it in one fell swoop, or bit
by bit as you use the site — because each time you view a Wish List or
Registry, you have the option to add that person to your Friends list. Here’s
the one-fell-swoop method:
1. Go to your Friends & Favorites area by clicking the link in the subnav
of Your Store.
2. Scroll down the page until you see the Manage Your Friends &
Favorites box.
You find the Manage Your Friends & Favorites box on the left side of the
page.
177
Chapter 12: Putting Your Two Cents In: Reviews, Lists, & Cool Features

3. Click the Add Amazon Friends link.
You come to the Invite Friends page, which explains, one more time,
what Friends are all about.
4. Enter the e-mail addresses of the people you want to add in the field
provided and click the Add button. 
You can enter more than one e-mail address at a time, so long as you
separate them by commas. These people don’t have to have an Amazon
account. And don’t worry about Amazon spamming these people to
death — or selling their names to someone who wants to spam them to
death. Amazon doesn’t and won’t.
That’s it! Amazon sends those people an e-mail, telling them that they’re offi-
cially your Amazon Friends and can view your About You area as they please.
If they accept your invitation to become a Friend (by clicking the link in the
e-mail) they show up on your list with a star by their names. If they don’t
accept, they become a mere Favorite Person. To access your Amazon Friends
list, just click on the Amazon Friends link in the Your Participation box on the
right side of the Friend & Favorites page.
Your Friends list and your Favorites list live together in one big list. You can
differentiate between the two within the list because Friends have a star next
to their names. 
Technically, all your Amazon Friends are also Favorite People. You notice this
as soon as you create your Friends list (which you can access by clicking on
the Amazon Friends link in the Your Participation box on the right side of the
Friend & Favorites page). Those people will also show up on your Favorite
People list. So I recommend creating your Friends list first. That way, if you
run out of steam, you’ll have populated both lists and your Friends & Family
area will have a little life.
Favorite People
Adding Favorite People is trickier than adding Friends. Unfortunately, there
isn’t a “one-fell-swoop” method. Instead, there are two sort of roundabout
methods for adding Favorite People: By clicking reviewer names on the detail
page and by using the Search box at the top left of the Friends & Family page
(if you’re still on that Starter page, you can also use the Search box in the
middle of the page — the two are the same).
Using the Search box to add people to your Favorites list is the premeditated
method. It’s the method of choice if you know the name, nickname, or e-mail
address of the person you’re searching for.
Only people who have participated in some kind of community feature will
show up in People search results. In other words, they have to have a Wish
List, an About You area, shared purchases, and so on. 
178
Part III: The More the Merrier: The Amazon.com Community 

Here’s how to add Favorite People using the Search box:
1. Go to your Friends & Favorites area by clicking the link in the subnav
of Your Store.
You see that the Search box at the top left of the page — right below the
nav — is already set on People as a default.
2. Enter the name of the person you’re searching for in the search field
and click Go.
Be as specific as you can be. (For example, don’t enter Smith unless you
have time to sift through 32,000 results.) Also, keep in mind that the
search field is not case sensitive.
3. Click the name of the person you want to add.
You notice that underneath each name are links to that person’s “stuff” —
Wish List, reviews, shared purchases, and so on (as in Figure 12-10). You
should know that if the person has only a Wish List showing and you
click the name, you’re taken straight to that Wish List. And here’s the
rub: You can’t make someone a Favorite from his or her Wish List. You
can make the person a Friend (and so automatically a Favorite), but you
can’t make the person only a Favorite. In other words, if someone only
has a Wish List in the People search results, you can’t add that person to
your Favorites unless you’re also willing to make him or her a Friend.
4. Click the Add To Your Favorite People List link.
You’re taken to that person’s About You page; the person’s name is then
officially added to your Favorites list (which you can access by clicking
on the Amazon Friends link in the Your Participation box on the right
side of the Friend & Favorites page).

Adding people via the reviews on a detail page is a little bit easier and proba-
bly makes more sense. After all, the purpose of Favorites is to provide you
with content from people whose opinions you trust. So if you’re cruising the
site and read a good review, it makes sense that you’d seize the moment and
add that person to your Favorites list.
Here’s how to add someone to your Favorite People list from a review:
1. Click the person’s name.
I’m assuming three things here: One, that you’re on a detail page, two,
that you have found a review you like, and three, that the reviewer’s
name is a hot link. If all three are true, you’re taken to the Reviews page
in that reviewer’s About You area.
2. Click the About (Their Name) link in the breadcrumb trail.
You find it at the top of the page under the nav. This link takes you to the
person’s About You area.
3. Click the Add To Your Favorite People List link.
This is right next to the name at the top and center of the page. Once
you click it, you’ve added someone to your Favorite People list. To
access this list, just click on the Favorite People link in the Your
Participation box on the right side of the Friend & Favorites page.
Everybody’s Got Listmania!
What are the 20 essential items you have to have if you call yourself a sci-fi
fan? If you were a contestant on Survivor and could bring five luxury items
instead of only one, what would they be? What are the ten all-time greatest
hair-band albums? If you’ve given things like these some thought, Listmania
is going to float your boat.
Listmania is a feature that allows you to create thematic lists of products that
Amazon sells. They don’t necessarily have to be things you bought at
Amazon. You don’t even have to own them. You can create any kind of list
you want, as long as the items on it are in Amazon’s catalog.
How to create a list
Creating a Listmania list is pretty simple and very fun. To do it, you have to
have an Amazon account, but otherwise, no requirements. The very first
thing you have to do is have an idea — “Cookbooks and Kitchen Equipment
for the Novice,” “Gifts for Dog Lovers,” and so on. Once you’ve got that nailed
down, you’re set.
180
Part III: The More the Merrier: The Amazon.com Community 

Here’s how to create a Listmania list:
1. Go to your Friends & Favorites area by clicking the link in the subnav
of Your Store.
You notice a link to Listmania in the Explore box on the left side of the
page. You may have to scroll down a bit.
2. Click the Add a Listmania List link in the Explore box.
If you haven’t used your About You area, you may come to a “Who Are
You” page that will ask you to confirm your information — screen name
versus real name, e-mail address, and so on. (If not, you’ll be taken directly
to Step 4.) Make sure it looks as it should or make the appropriate changes.
3. Click Submit.
You’ll come to a sign-in screen.
4. Enter your e-mail address and password in the fields provided and
click the Sign In Using Our Secure Server button.
You’re taken to the Listmania page shown in Figure 12-11.
5. Before filling in any of the fields on the Listmania page, click the
Open Another Browser link in the middle of the page.
The link automatically opens another browser window and goes straight
to the Amazon Welcome page. Amazon recommends that you do this to
make the search easier when you’re looking for the items on your list.
You can find their ASINs or ISBNs (refer to Figure 12-6) and then copy
and paste them into the Listmania fields in the other browser window.
Open Another Browser link
Figure 12-11:

181
Chapter 12: Putting Your Two Cents In: Reviews, Lists, & Cool Features

6. Go back to the open list form in your first browser window and enter
the name of your list in the field provided.
It’s good to be descriptive and okay to have some fun.
7. Enter your qualifications in the field provided.
You don’t have to have real qualifications here — no one is checking.
But if you’re writing a list and you do have relevant qualifications (for
example, you’re writing a list on good art books and you’re a curator for
a museum), list your credentials. They’re helpful to people.
8. Use the special Search box to find an item on your list.
Do this in the “other” window — the one with the Amazon welcome page.
Once you find an item, go to its detail page, scroll down to its product
information, and find its ASIN or ISBN (again, refer to Figure 12-6).
9. Select the ASIN or ISBN and copy it.
Do this by double clicking the ASIN or ISBN and then going up to “edit”
in your browser’s menu and selecting “copy.”
10. Paste the ASIN or ISBN into the field provided on the list form.
To paste, you put your cursor in the field you want to fill, go back up to
your browser’s menu, and select “paste.” 
11. Enter your comments for that item in the field provided.
These aren’t required, but they add something.
12. Repeat Steps 6 through 9 until your list is complete and then click the
Preview button.
You list must be at least 3 items long, and no longer than 25 items (and
be sure to separate each item on the list with a comma). When you click
Preview, you’re taken to a page that shows you what your list will look
like on the site. Make sure it’s okay — and if it isn’t, click the Edit button
to make changes.
13. Click the Publish This List button.
You did it! You’re taken to a confirmation page and your list makes its
way onto the site.
Where your list lives and 
who’s gonna see it
You’ve done it. You’ve created a Listmania list and it’s a thing of beauty. So
who gets to feast their eyes on your handiwork? Your list will definitely show
up in your About You area. That means that anyone who has access to that
area can see your list.
182
Part III: The More the Merrier: The Amazon.com Community 

Your list may also show up in various other places on the site — search
results, in the marketing section of the shopping cart, on info-type pages, and
so on. This is not an act of favoritism on Amazon’s part. In fact, it has nothing
to do with who they like and everything to do with what’s in your list. When
you put ASINs and ISBNs in your list and then submit your list to the site,
Amazon registers those ASINs and ISBNs and pulls up lists for relevant situa-
tions based on those numbers. So if you wrote a list about bird-watching
essentials and someone buys a birdfeeder, your list may end up in the mar-
keting section of that person’s shopping cart.
Share the Love
It’s always a good idea to share the love, but it’s a really good idea at
Amazon.com. Share the Love is essentially a referral program — except
instead of referring people to Amazon and getting a bonus, you refer prod-
ucts to people — and if they buy them, you get a bonus.
You can be both a giver and a receiver of Love at Amazon. When you make a
purchase, you have the option to share with your friends and give them the
option to buy whatever you’ve bought, but at a discount. When your friends
make a purchase, they can share with you and you get the discount. Either
way, Love is Shared.
Love . . . That’s Entertainment!
So true. Especially at Amazon. There are a few rules associated with Amazon’s
Share the Love program. The biggest is that you can only share love with pur-
chases made in the Books, Music, Video, and DVD stores. Here are some other
important rules you should be familiar with:
 Friends have to buy within one week. When you’re the sharer (as
opposed to the sharee), your recipients have to buy whatever you’re
sharing within a week of getting the Share the Love e-mail from Amazon in
order for you to get a credit. Conversely, when you’re the sharee, you have
to buy within one week to get the discount. So the buying heat is on!
 You can only get one credit per item. Sad but true. Even if you share an
item with 500 of your closest friends and all 500 buy it within a week,
you still only get one credit.
 You must use your credits within 30 days of receiving them. After 30
days, your credits expire. You can use a bunch of credits at once, but
they all have to be within their valid period. So, again, the buying heat is
on. I admit, it’s not as hot, but still . . . it’s heat.
183
Chapter 12: Putting Your Two Cents In: Reviews, Lists, & Cool Features

 You can only use your credit at Amazon.com. The good news is you
aren’t limited to just books, music, and movies. The bad news is you
can’t use your credit at any of the international stores or with any third-
party sellers.
 You can’t return The Love. You can return items you bought with Share
the Love credits, but you won’t receive a refund for the amount of the
credit. So plan to keep The Love.
 You can’t redeem The Love for cash. Share the Love is a credit only sit-
uation. You either apply it to an Amazon purchase or you lose it.
 You have to use your shopping cart when you apply your credit. There
is a step in the shopping cart process that asks you to include promo-
tional credits. This is where you apply your Share the Love. So don’t buy
it with 1-Click if you want to apply credits.
How to be a sharer
Sharing the Love is wonderfully easy. You get to look like such a lovely, giving
person and you hardly have to lift a finger. Here’s how to be a sharer:
1. Make a purchase from the Book, Music, Video, or DVD store using
your shopping cart.
You go through just about the whole process — from adding it to your
cart through payment — before you hit the Share the Love screen. When
you do, you’re at a page that looks like Figure 12-12. If you need some
help with using the shopping cart, refer to Chapter 10.
Figure 12-12:
The Share
the Love
page.
184
Part III: The More the Merrier: The Amazon.com Community 

2. Enter the e-mail addresses of the people you want to share with in the
field provided.
You can enter multiple addresses if they’re separated by commas. You
can also Share the Love with your entire Friends list by clicking the box
next to “Also send to all Amazon Friends.” But if you don’t want to share
it with the whole group, you have to enter e-mail addresses from the list
individually in the field provided.
There are times when you don’t want to be sharing that love. If you’re
buying a book, CD, or DVD as a gift for an Amazon.com Friend, don’t
accidentally “Share the Love.” If you do, say, “bye-bye surprise.”
3. Click the box next to each item you want to share.
Unfortunately, you can’t pick and choose who gets what. Every item you
click is shared with every person you enter in the field provided.
4. Click the Send Discount and Place My Order button.
Your order is not placed unless you click this button (or the “No,
thanks . . .” button beneath it). So even if you change your mind about
sharing, you have to click one of the two buttons to complete your order.
When you’re finished, you’re taken to a page that includes Figure 12-13,
where you’re offered lots of optional things to do. These are just options.
Your order is complete and you have successfully shared.

mation —

Chapter 12: Putting Your Two Cents In: Reviews, Lists, & Cool Features

If you get any takers, your credit shows up in the Credits You’ve Earned sec-
tion of your Share the Love page. You can access this page from the Explore
box on the left side of your Friends & Favorites area in Your Store.
How to be a sharee
Being a sharee is even easier than being a sharer. Here’s how to do it:
1. Click the link to the item from the Share the Love e-mail.
When someone Shares the Love with you, you receive an e-mail that
looks like Figure 12-14. You can click the item’s link or image and you’re
taken to a Sign In screen.
2. Enter your e-mail address and password in the fields provided and
click the Sign In Using Our Secure Server button.
You come to the Discounts for You section (or tab) of your Share the
Love page. To get the discount, you have to buy the item from this page,
using the shopping cart. The language on the Share the Love page is
ambiguous about this, but if you go to the Help Department they con-
firm that all Share the Love discounts must be redeemed from the Share
the Love page.
3. Click the Add to Cart button.
Figure 12-14:

186
Part III: The More the Merrier: The Amazon.com Community 

You’re taken to your shopping cart, which will show the item at its non-
discounted price. Don’t be alarmed. Scroll a tiny bit and you notice that
the subtotal reflects the discount.
4. Click the Proceed to Checkout button.
You’re taken to another Sign In screen.
5. Enter your e-mail address and password in the fields provided and
click the Sign In Using Our Secure Server button.
This time you come to the Order Placement page. Notice that the Share
the Love discount is reflected as a line item in your order summary.
6. Click the Place Your Order button.
You, too, are encouraged to Share the Love. The next screen is the Share
the Love screen.
7. Click one of the two buttons to complete your order.
Your order isn’t complete until you either share love and click that
button, or decline and click the “No, thanks . . .” button.
Applying credits
Now for the fun part. If you’re a big shopper and a big sharer, you can build
up a hefty lot of credits. But to use them, you have to activate them! Here’s
how:
1. Go to your Friends & Favorites area by clicking the link in the subnav
of Your Store.
2. Click the Share the Love link in the Explore box on the left side of the
page.
You’re taken to your Share the Love page.
3. Click the Credits You’ve Earned tab.
You will see a list of the items that have earned you credits and your
total credit amount in red.
4. Click the Apply Credits button.
You have officially activated your credit.
You don’t have to use your credit right when you activate it. But if you don’t
use it within 30 days of receiving it, you forfeit it. When you’re ready to apply
it to a purchase, just make sure you use the shopping cart instead of 1-Click.
When you come to your order summary page, you see your Share the Love
credits listed. Make sure you check them if you want to apply them to that
order.

The People in Poughkeepsie
Love Pokemon
I made that up. Maybe the people in Poughkeepsie don’t really love Pokemon,
but they do love Kasey the Kinderbot. It’s their 13th favorite toy. (And who
can blame them? If Kasey the Kinderbot and Pokemon ever came to fisticuffs,
I’d put my money on the Kinderbot too.)
How do I know all this? Because I checked out Poughkeepsie’s Purchase
Circle on Amazon.com.
You, too, can check out Purchase Circles. You can go to Amazon and find out
what the people in your city are reading or which CDs your fellow college
alumni are buying. You can find out what movies your co-workers are watching
and which toys their kids are playing with. Purchase Circles are Amazon best-
seller lists based on commonalties — geographic, educational, organizational,
corporate, and governmental affiliations. So you can go check out Purchase
Circles that are relevant to you or take a gander at Purchase Circles that have
nothing to do with you but are just fun to look at. (The latter isn’t an act of
illicit voyeurism. It’s perfectly acceptable and entirely anonymous voyeurism.)
But Purchase Circles are more than just a curiosity. In some ways, they’re
better than regular, old bestsellers. If you’re looking for good ideas on what
to buy, it makes sense to get those recommendations from people you have
something in common with. That’s what Purchase Circles are all about.
Purchase Circles — getting around
Purchase Circles are most easily accessed from the Friends & Favorites sec-
tion of Your Store. You find a link to Purchase Circles in the “Explore” box on
the left side of the page. 
There are hundreds of Purchase Circles on Amazon.com. In fact, one of my
favorites is the Amazon.com Purchase Circle. (This is a Purchase Circle for
my former co-workers, not the 37 million people shopping at Amazon.) Here’s
how you would access it:
1. Go to your Friends & Favorites area by clicking the link in the subnav
of Your Store.
2. Click the Purchase Circles link in the Explore box on the left side of
the page.
3. Click the Companies link in the Browse Purchase Circles box.
4. Click the A-Z link in the Browse Companies box.
188
Part III: The More the Merrier: The Amazon.com Community 

5. Click the A link in the Browse Companies A-Z Purchase Circles box.
6. Click Amazon.com.
The average Purchase Circle page looks like Figure 12-15. (Ooh, Web
Development with Apache and Perl — those Amazonians sure know how to
party!) You can navigate the Purchase Circle by using the links just above the
first bestseller. Those links will also tell you which categories you find best-
seller lists for in that Purchase Circle.
You can also create a list of favorite Purchase Circles. To add a Purchase
Circle to your favorites just click the Add to Favorites button on the right
side of the page. Don’t see a button? In some cases, if a Purchase Circle isn’t
well populated, there won’t be an Add to Favorites button. If you go up one
level (back to the page you clicked from), you’re likely to find the button
there — and you can add that page to your Favorites. To access your list of
favorite Purchase Circles, just click on Purchase Circles in the Explore box on
your Friends & Favorites page. That’ll take you to the Purchase Circles page
and, if you’ve created one, your Favorite purchase Circles list.
Purchase Circles and privacy
Purchase Circles are completely private. According to Amazon’s Purchase
Circle FAQ, they are created by “aggregating anonymous data.” So you don’t
have to worry about protecting your privacy. No one will know that you love
Air Supply unless you say so.
If you’re still worried, you can remove yourself from the circle. By changing
your Purchase Circle settings, you will remove your data from the aggregate.
Here’s how to do it:

So You’d Like to Write a “So You’d
Like To . . . ” Guide
Do you have a special, secret talent? Have you recently finished up a hefty
project? Did you recently take a fabulous trip? Share your knowledge with the
rest of the Amazon community by writing a So You’d Like To . . . guide.
Creating the guide is similar to creating a Listmania list. Here are a few quick
rules to know before you get started:
 The items in your guide have to be available at Amazon. You’re not
limited to items that you’ve purchased at Amazon. You’re not even lim-
ited to items you own. 
 The items in your guide have to have an ASIN or ISBN number. This
excludes certain products, like Auction and zShops items.
 You have to recommend at least 3 and no more than 50 items. If you
write a guide with 50 items, then hats off to you!
 Your guide has to be at least 100 words long and no more than 1,500
words long.
190
Part III: The More the Merrier: The Amazon.com Community 

 The first three items you recommend are your featured items in the
guide. So choose them wisely!
Those are the rules, here’s how you use them:
1. Go to your Friends & Favorites area by clicking the link in the subnav
of Your Store.
The Friends & Favorites area duly appears.
2. Click the Write A So You’d Like To . . . Guide link in the Explore box.
It’s the last one in the Explore box — right there on the left side of the
page.
Note: As always, if you’re not already signed in, you’re taken to a Sign In
screen.
3. In the Sign In screen, enter your e-mail address and password in the
fields provided and click the Sign In Using Our Secure Server button.
You should now be at the first of two So You’d Like To . . . creation pages
(as in Figure 12-16).
4. Click the . . . open another browser link.
You find it in the second bullet under the Enter Text and Product ASINs
header. It will automatically open another window and go straight to the
Amazon Welcome page. Amazon recommends that you do this to make it
easy for you to search for the items on your list and find their ASINs or
ISBNs (as in Figure 12-6) in one window, and copy and paste them into
your guide in the other window. So you’ll be jumping back and forth
between the two windows as you write your guide.
5. Create a title for your guide in the field provided.
You do this in the “guide” window, not the second window you opened
in order to search for items. They automatically plug in the “So You’d
Like To . . . ” part. You just need to complete the sentence.
6. Enter your qualifications in the field provided.
You are a world traveler writing a travel-related guide. Or a new dog
owner writing a puppy-related guide. You get the drift.
7. Enter the text for your guide, excluding the item titles.
Don’t worry; we get to item titles in Step 8. You notice that there are spe-
cial instructions on the page that tell you how to enter items into your
guide. You don’t need to enter item titles, just ASINs or ISBNs.
8. Switch to your second browser window and use the Search feature to
find the first item in your guide.
Once you find an item, go to its detail page, scroll down to its product
information and find its ASIN or ISBN. (Refer to Figure 12-6.)
191
Chapter 12: Putting Your Two Cents In: Reviews, Lists, & Cool Features

9. Select the ASIN or ISBN and copy it.
Double-click the ASIN or ISBN and then go up to Edit in your browser’s
menu and select Copy.
10. Switch back the your other open browser window and paste the ASIN
or ISBN into the appropriate place in the text of your guide.
To paste, put your cursor where you want the number to appear, go
back up to your browser’s menu, and select Paste. Make sure you use
the proper format outlined on the So You’d Like To . . . page. Each item
entered should look like this: <ASIN: B00003IRC3i>. Even if you’re
entering an ISBN, the letters after the less-than sign should be ASIN. This
stuff (the greater and less-than signs and the ASIN rule) is important. It
has to be exact because it’s actually going to become a part of the HTML
that makes up the web page.
11. Repeat Steps 8 through 10 until your guide is complete.
Remember, at least 3 items and no more than 50. If you want to add a
section heading to your guide, make sure it’s in the proper format.
Headings should look like this: <HEADING: “heading here”>.
12. Click Save and Continue.
If you’ve spent a while constructing your guide, you may need to sign in
again. If so, just enter your e-mail address and password and click the
Sign In Using Our Secure Server button. You’re taken to the preview of
your guide. Check to make sure it looks the way you want it to look. If
you need to make changes, click the Edit button to go back to the first
So You’d Like To . . . page.

In This Chapter
 Creating a Wish List
 Setting up special occasion reminders
 Creating wedding and baby registries
 Using Gift Explorer
 Searching for Wish Lists and registries
I
love gifts. I love giving them. I love getting them. I love holidays and occa-
sions that involve giving and getting them. When I was little, I would write
out long, elaborate Christmas lists — and I’m Jewish. I’m gift-centric. I’m a
Giftist. And there’s no better place for a Giftist than Amazon.com.
Amazon is set up for good gift getting. They have registries, Wish Lists, gift-
matching tools — everything you need to ensure that you’re not going to get
another dickie from your Great-Aunt Lany. Conversely, it’s equally easy to give
good gifts using Amazon’s registries, lists, and matching tools. So you’ll never
be compelled to give another dickie to your great-niece or nephew.
In this chapter, I show you how to use all of Amazon’s gift-related lists, set up
your own Wish List, and set up wedding and baby registries. I help you hunt
for other people’s Wish Lists and registries so good gifts go where they’re
most wanted (whether you’re giving or getting them). I also show you how to
use Amazon’s Gift Explorer in case the person you’re giving to doesn’t have a
Wish List or registry. Finally, for those of you who are like me and find it diffi-
cult to remember important dates, I reveal the glory of Amazon’s Special
Occasion Reminders. They help you actually remember to use those other
gift features in time for your gift-giving events.

I Really Wish You’d Look at
My Wish List
Have you ever seen that episode of Sex and the City where Carrie, disenchanted
by the giftless plight of the single girl, decides to marry herself — and registers
at the Manolo Blahnik store? I think she sold herself short. I agree that a $475
pair of shoes can make a girl feel giddy, but one pair of shoes does not a gift
bonanza make. Carrie should have gone to Amazon.com and created a Wish
List for herself. Then she could have signed herself up for shoes and a handbag
and a nice home entertainment system.
An Amazon Wish List is the grown up equivalent of the Christmas list — only
better because it sticks around all year. And unlike wedding and baby registries,
Wish Lists are good for any gift-giving occasion. 
If you’ve got a Wish List you can access it any time by clicking on Wish List in
the Shopping Tools menu at the top of most pages on the site. (And if you
don’t have one, click Wish List to get started on making one.)
There’s more to know about Wish Lists than what you find here in this chapter.
I’m going to cover the basics — the things you absolutely need to know —
but if you want to find out more, you can do so on Amazon’s site. Just go to
the Help department by clicking on Help in the Shopping Tools menu at the
top of the page. Then click the Wish Lists & Gift Registries link, and then click
Wish Lists. You find lots of good information!
Creating your Wish List
Before you can populate your Wish List, you have to have an Amazon.com
account. Then it’s automatic; once you have an Amazon.com account, you
have a Wish List. It may be bare, but it’s there, so you may as well fill ’er up.
Adding items to your Wish List is a wonderfully simple process. The hardest
part may be deciding on what to add. If you have an Amazon account, you
only need to complete Steps 1 and 2. If you don’t, you need to complete all
the steps. Here’s how to do it:
1. Search or browse the site for the item that you want.
Don’t hold back. No one is required to buy the things on your Wish List,
so have some fun. Put that gigantic plasma TV on your Wish List. Add the
Segway Human Transporter. Why not? You might get lucky. If you need
help with searching or browsing, read Chapters 8 and 9, respectively.
2. Click the Add to Wish List button.
You find this button on the right side of the item’s detail page, just below
the fold (see Figure 13-1). If you already have an Amazon.com account,

195
Chapter 13: Giving (and Getting) Good Gifts
that’s it! You come to a screen that looks like Figure 13-2, where you’re
shown the item you’ve added, along with options to view your Wish List
or keep shopping. If you don’t have an account, just go on to Step 3,
where you enter your e-mail address on a sign-in screen.
3. In the new page that appears, enter your e-mail address in the field
provided, click the New Customer radio button, and then click the
Sign In Using Our Secure Server button.
A New to Amazon.com? page appears, asking you to register. This is just to
set you up with an account so you can have a Wish List. You won’t need to
give your credit-card information; only your name, e-mail address, and
password.

detail page.

4. Enter your name, e-mail address (twice), and password (twice) in the
fields provided and then click the Continue button.
They also ask for your birthday, but that’s optional. When you complete
this step, you get your first peek at the Your Wish List page — which
looks something like Figure 13-3. 
5. On the Your Wish List page, click the Enter Address button.
After you complete Step 4, you’ve created an account and you can popu-
late your Wish List. But if you want those Wish List items to arrive at
your house (what a concept), you’d better enter a shipping address.
Don’t worry. Nobody can see your address — just your city and state.
6. Enter your full name and address in the fields provided and click the
Submit button.
You’re taken to a page that confirms your Wish List address has been
saved. You’ll also get an e-mail confirming the creation of your Wish List.
Success! You officially have a Wish List, complete with a shipping address.
But let’s say you were in a big hurry and you just didn’t have time to enter
your shipping address. Don’t despair. You can always add your shipping
address later. Just go to the Your Wish List page by clicking on Wish List in
the shopping tools menu. Then click the Enter Shipping Address link in the
Wish List Information box on the right side of the page. Also, people buying
from your Wish List will be notified that you haven’t supplied a shipping
address and will be given the opportunity to enter it themselves during the
checkout process.
Now that you’ve inaugurated your Wish List, you can pack it full of goodies.
To add more items to your Wish List, simply repeat Steps 1 and 2.

Part III: The More the Merrier: The Amazon.com Community 

I’ve been telling you to access the Wish List from the Shopping Tools menu,
but that’s not the only way to do it. Here are a few other ways to get at your
list of goodies:
 Through the Wish List link in the Shopping Tools menu. This is the
fastest way to get there. The Shopping Tools menu is at the top right on
every page of the site.
 From the Gifts store. There’s a Wish List choice in the subnav of the
Gifts store.
 From your Friends & Favorites area. There’s a nice little link in the
Explore box on the home page of your Friends & Favorites area.
If there are items on your Wish List that are available used, Amazon will also
created a Used Wish List for you. You can access that on the main page of
Your Store and on the Your Favorite Stores page within Your Store.
You won’t necessarily know when someone buys you something off of your
Wish List (until you get it, of course). Amazon.com doesn’t make it obvious to
keep from spoiling the surprise. When you’re logged in to your account, your
Wish List will look as it always does — as you created it — whether or not
someone has purchased from it. But you can find out what’s been purchased
by making the appropriate selection from the drop-down list.
Telling people about it
Once you’ve created a Wish List, you need to spread the word. Say it loud
and say it proud and watch the goodies roll in. Here’s how to tell people
about your Wish List:
1. Click Wish List in the Shopping Tools menu.
You can access your Wish List in any number of ways. How you get there
doesn’t actually matter.
2. Click the Share Your Wish List link.
You find the link just above the items on your Wish List. When you click
it you come to a page that looks like Figure 13-4.
3. Enter the e-mail addresses of the people you want to notify in the field
provided.
You can enter as many as you like. Just separate the addresses by
commas.
4. Click the appropriate box if you want to notify your Amazon Friends.
This sends an e-mail to the entire group. For more on Amazon Friends,
read Chapter 12.
197
Chapter 13: Giving (and Getting) Good Gifts

5. Enter a message in the field provided or use the default message and
click the Send E-Mail button.
You notice that Amazon has supplied a default message explaining what
your Wish List e-mail is about. Feel free to delete this and type your own.
When you send the e-mail, you come to a confirmation screen that tells
you who your Wish List e-mail has been sent to.
Finding someone else’s Wish List
If you know you have a gift-giving occasion coming up (and if you use Special
Occasion Reminders, you’ll know), you can get on Amazon.com and search
for the giftee’s Wish List. Finding a Wish List is easy. Here’s how you do it:
1. Click Wish List in the Shopping Tools menu.
Of course, this isn’t the only way to access your Wish List, just the
fastest way.
2. Click the Find a Wish List link. 
You find the link just above the items on your Wish List.
3. Enter the name or e-mail address of the person you’re searching for in
the field provided.
If you’re going with a name search, try entering the full name. You can
enter just first or last, but unless that person has a very unusual name,
you’re going to end up with a host of search results. Also, this page has
lots of good search information, so it wouldn’t hurt to read it.
Figure 13-4:

4. Enter the city or state in the field provided.
Entering the city or state is optional, but it can help narrow your search
results. When I enter just Friedman, I get 2,581 search results. When I
enter Friedman and Seattle, I get 10 results (and 2 of them are mine).
5. Click the Find It! button.
If your search is specific enough, you end up right at that person’s Wish
List and you’re done. If not, you come to a Search Results page that
looks something like Figure 13-5. (Notice that doing a Wish List search
may also turn up registries.)
6. Click the name of the person whose Wish List you want to view.
This will take you to their Wish List (see mine in Figure 13-6 — and feel
free to use me as a test subject). You can buy items from the Wish List
by using the Shopping Cart and 1-Click buttons to the right of each item.
What if you search and search and can’t find the person you’re looking for?
You can send that person an e-mail encouraging him or her to create a Wish
List. There’s a link on the Wish List Search Results page (Figure 13-5) that
says, “Send an e-mail telling them how to create a Wish List.” If you click that
link, you come to a page that looks like Figure 13-7. Sending an e-mail to tell
someone to set up a Wish List is basically the same as sending an e-mail to
tell someone about your Wish List (instructions for how to do that appear
earlier in this chapter).

Amazon’s Special Occasion Reminders are a good way to stay in the good
graces of the ones you love. And they’re easy to set up. Here’s how you do it:
1. Click the See More Stores link.
You find this link above the nav on the right side of the page. It takes you
to the Store Directory.
2. Click the Gifts Store link under the Gifts & Registries heading.
3. Click Gift Services in the Gifts Store subnav.
4. Click the Special Occasion Reminders link.
You should now be on the first Special Occasion Reminders page. It’s
nothing more than a quick paragraph about what Reminders are and a
place to put the Create New Reminder button.
5. Click the Create New Reminder button.
You’re taken to a Sign In screen.
6. Enter your e-mail address and password in the fields provided and
then click the Sign In Using Our Secure Server button.
You come to the Create a Special Occasion Reminder page you see in
Figure 13-8.
7. Enter a name in the field provided.
This should be the name of the person associated with the event or
occasion. Ostensibly that’s the person who would receive the gift.

9. Click the appropriate box or boxes to tell Amazon when to send your
reminder.
You can choose as many boxes as you like. You’re sent a Reminder
e-mail for each box you choose.
10. Fill out the optional info.
If you want, you can tell Amazon a little bit about the person you’re gift-
ing. Enter their e-mail address in the field provided and when the occa-
sion is drawing near, Amazon will surface their Wish List for you
(assuming they have one). You can also use the drop-down menus to
give the age and gender of the recipients, and you can even enter some
of their interests (separated by commas, please). The last optional
choice is a box that’s automatically checked; it offers to remind you of
this occasion every year. If you don’t want a yearly reminder, just
uncheck the box.
11. Click the Create Reminder button.
You’re taken to your Special Occasion Reminders page, which now
shows one entry. To add more reminders, click the Create New
Reminder button and repeat Steps 6 through 10.
You access your Reminders from your About You area. Go to your Friends &
Favorites area, click on your About You Area in the Browse box, and then
click on Your Reminders under Gift Helpers in the Browse box.
Going to the Chapel: Wedding
Registries in Detail
If you’ve ever gotten married and had a registry, you know how great it is to
pick out all the stuff you need and actually get it. Amazon is an especially good
place to register because you won’t be limited to just kitchen and household
items. If you want to register for CDs, you can. If the happy couple wants a
new cell phone, they can register for it. You can register for just about any-
thing Amazon sells with the exception of used goods or Auctions items.
Amazon offers a lot good information on their Web site on how to get the most
from their registry service. Here I cover the basics of setting up and updating
your registry, and also show you how to find someone else’s registry — but
if you need more information, I encourage you to go to the Amazon Help
department (just click on Help in the Shopping Tools menu at the top of most
pages on the site). Once there, just click the Wish Lists & Gift Registries link,
and then click Wedding Registry.

Everything you ever need: The Info Center
When you get married, you get advice from everyone. Everyone wants to
share (or at least tell you) wedding stories. Everyone’s got an opinion. Things
can get heated. Some people go a little insane. Getting married can be confus-
ing and stressful. That’s what happens when we gather all those space aliens
we call our family members and ask them to sit together and make nice for an
entire day. (Or maybe I’m projecting here.)
Anyway, registering doesn’t have to be confusing and stressful. But in case you
start to feel that way, visit Amazon’s Wedding Info Center (shown in Figure 13-9).
You find it in the Wedding section of the Gifts store. Here’s how to get there:
1. Click See More Stores.
You find this link above the nav on the right side of the page. It takes you
to the Store Directory.
2. Click Wedding Registry under the Gifts & Registries heading.
3. Click Info Center in the new subnav.
This is one of the few times Amazon breaks one of its own rules. Notice
that the subnav in the Wedding section is different from the subnav in
the Gifts store, even though the wedding section is actually in the Gifts
store. Strange but true.
The Info Center has more than what you need in the way of information. You
find a thorough FAQ, checklists, buying guides, and more. Even if you don’t
think you need help, the Info Center is a good place to browse. You may get

some good ideas and find some things to register for that you didn’t even
think about. Remember, you’re only going to get married once (in theory, at
least), so you may as well make that registry a work of art.
Creating your wedding registry
Creating your wedding registry at Amazon is much like creating your Wish
List, but with a little extra work up front. It helps to know what you want on
your registry, but if you don’t, you can use Amazon’s Quick Start registry
(more on that in a minute).
Here’s how to create your Amazon.com wedding registry:
1. Click the See More Stores link.
Remember, it’s at the top right of every page on the site.
2. Click the Wedding Registries link. 
You find it under the Gifts & Registries header.
3. Click the Create Your Registry button.
You’re taken to a Sign In screen.
4. Enter your e-mail address and password in the fields provided and
then click the Sign In Using Our Secure Server button.
You should now be on the Create Your Registry page. Entering your reg-
istry information and shipping address is mandatory; the optional infor-
mation is not.
5. Enter your registry information in the fields provided.
You need to give your full name, your partner’s full name, and a name for
the registry. Notice that Amazon completes your registry name by
making whatever you enter a possessive and adding the word “Registry”
at the end.
6. Enter your shipping address in the fields provided.
People viewing your registry will only be able to see your city and state.
No need to worry about privacy here.
7. Add optional information in the fields provided at your discretion.
In the comments section, you might add something like, “Please buy us
something from our registry as we don’t really want a ceramic Dalmatian
candlestick holder.” (Or maybe I’m projecting again.) You can also add a
photo, but keep it clean, people, keep it clean.
8. Click the Create Registry button.
You come to a page that confirms that your registry has been created. 
204
Part III: The More the Merrier: The Amazon.com Community 

9. Search for items that you want in your registry.
Now it’s time to add items. You can do this in two ways: by clicking the
Start Adding Items button on the confirmation page and using a Registry
Checklist, or by hopping around the site and finding things you want.
10. If you’re using a Registry Checklist, click the check boxes next to the
items you want to add and then click the Add to Registry button. If
you’re “hopping around the site,” click the Add to Wedding Registry
button next to each item on its detail page.
You find the Add to Wedding Registry button on the right side of the
detail page underneath the Ready to Buy? box. After you add items to
your registry (regardless of how you added them), you come to a screen
that is 2⁄3 marketing and 1⁄3 acknowledgment that the item has been added
to your registry. You’ll also receive an e-mail confirming your registry.
A quick word about registry checklists. These may be the most convenient
way to add items to your registry. They’re broken out by category and each
one lists a host of options. (Figure 13-10, for example, shows the Cookware
Registry Checklist.) You can check as many options as you like and add them
all to your registry at once. You can access the Registry Checklists on the
Wedding Registry main page.
The Quick Start registry
The Kitchen & Housewares Quick Start registry is an all-categories registry
checklist. There’s a little bit of everything here — from cookware to small
appliances. Just enough to stock a happy kitchen with your sweetie.

Chapter 13: Giving (and Getting) Good Gifts

You can get to the Quick Start registry from the Wedding Registry page. To
access the registry, just click either the link in the paragraph or the Get
Started button.
Using the feature is a cakewalk (pun alert!). Check the boxes for the items
you want on your registry. You can check as many or as few as you like, and
then click one of the two Add to Registry buttons on the page (there’s one at
the top and another at the bottom). That’s it. The items are added to your
registry.
Updating your registry
You’re not stuck with your registry as is when you’ve created it. Your registry
is extremely flexible; it can change as quickly as your mood if you want it to.
To update or change your registry, first you have to access it. To do that,
simply go to the Wedding Registry page and then click the View/Update Your
Registry button. You’ll notice that there are several ways to update your
registry.
Figure 13-11 shows a sample wedding registry — Congratulations, Muffy! —
ready for updating. Here are some key things you can do from this page:
 Share your registry. You find the link to do this just above the items in
your registry. This is the same feature that you may have used for your
Wish List. Amazon will send an e-mail out on your behalf informing people
of your registry. All you need to do is enter the e-mail addresses of those
folks you want notified and then click the Send E-Mail button. Easy!
 Edit your registry information. This lives in the About Us box on the
right side of the page. Use this to change your name, your partner’s
name — it can happen! — or the name of your registry.
 Change your shipping information. This also lives in the About Us
box. It’s where you can change the address that registry items will be
shipped to.
You can also change the status of individual items on your registry. You’ll find
these options under each item in your registry:
 Change quantities. The default for the Desired box is 1. Enter whatever
number you like, and make sure you click the Save Changes button.
 Delete. Do this by simply clicking the “delete” button underneath he item.
 Move an item to another list. You can move an item from your wedding
registry to either your Wish List or baby registry. Use the drop-down
menu to choose where you want the item to go and click the “go”
button.

Finding someone else’s Wedding Registry
Finding a registry is a lot like finding a Wish List. Here’s how you do it:
1. Click Wedding Registry in the Store Directory.
You can access the Store Directory by clicking the See More Stores link
above the nav on any page of the site.
2. On the Wedding home page, enter the name of the person you’re
searching for in the field provided in the Wedding Registry Search box.
The box is on the right side of the Wedding home page. Enter the full
name of either member of the couple. Remember, anyone who sets up a
Wedding Registry is required to enter his or her partner’s name.
3. Enter the city or state in the field provided.
This helps you narrow your search results if the person you’re searching
for has a common name.
4. Click the Find it! button.
If you hit the nail on the head, you go directly to the registry itself. If not,
you come to a Search Results page.
5. Click the name of the person whose registry you want to view.
When the registry appears, you can buy items by clicking the Add To

You can also access a handy Find a Registry page from any place in the
Wedding area by clicking Find a Registry in the subnav.

Oh Baby! Baby Registries in Detail
Baby registries at Amazon are the kissing cousins of wedding registries with
one critical difference: Many of the items you’re likely to put on your registry
are going to come from Babies ‘R’ Us because Amazon’s Baby store is actually
a cobranded store. Type either babiesrus.com or amazon.com and you end
up at the same place. So baby registries are actually cobranded registries
(which can go either route, businesswise) as opposed to just Amazon.com
registries.
So what? Well, one thing that is affected by this partnership is returns. Here is
the nutshell version of the rules:
 Babies ‘R’ Us items. You can return them to Amazon.com or a Babies ‘R’
Us store, but they’re subject to the Babies ‘R’ Us return policy. 
 Amazon.com items. These can only be returned to Amazon and are sub-
ject to Amazon’s return policy.
Privacy is also an issue to consider. You should be aware that when you shop
the Baby store, you’re sharing your personal info with the “‘R’ Us family.”
This matters because their policies are not as stringent as Amazon’s are (for
example, they will solicit you over the phone to tell you about “special offers”).
Here’s how to find out more about the ‘R’ Us family’s privacy policies:
1. Click Help in the Shopping Tools menu.
2. Click the Baby Registry link.
You find it under the Gifts & Gift Certificates heading.
3. Click the Click Here link.
You find the link in the second paragraph of text.
4. In the new page that appears, click the Privacy Policy link.
Nope. You’re not there yet. One more click . . . 
5. In the new new page that appears, click ‘R’ Us Family Privacy Policy.
The lengthy, lumpy truckload of legalese that appears on your screen is
the ‘R’ Us Family Privacy Policy. If you’re particularly concerned with
privacy, you should read it.
There is one piece of good news about the partnership (other than that you
can buy all kinds of great stuff online): When you create a baby registry
online, it also exists in the ‘R’ Us stores — which means people can shop
your registry virtually or walk into a brick-and-mortar store and do it the old-
fashioned way. Also, if you already have a registry with the ‘R’ Us stores, you
can activate it online. (Tips on how to do this appear later in the chapter.)

Everything you ever need:
The Resource Center
The Resource Center in the Baby store is one of the best collections of infor-
mation you find at Amazon.com. They’re not just selling here. They’re provid-
ing valuable information. 
To access the Resource Center, go to the Baby store and click Resource
Center in the subnav.
Here are the kinds of information you find in the Baby store’s Resource Center:
 Buying Guides. You find Buying Guides on everything from baby shower
gifts to safety gates. There are 13 Buying Guides in all.
 Checklists. These are not like the checklists in the wedding registry sec-
tion. They are, in fact, just simple lists with links to category pages for
the items that are available at Amazon/Babies ‘R’ Us. There are 12 differ-
ent checklists.
 Articles and Information. These are often taken from magazines or
other expert sources. There are nine different categories of information
and several articles within each. You’ll find everything from articles on
fertility to info on behavior and development.
 Expert Advice from Your Baby Today. Here’s where Amazon excerpts
several pieces of content from Your Baby Today, an organization created
by Nestlé Carnation to “offer tips for mother and baby on health, nutri-
tion, and care; review baby and maternity products; and provide interac-
tive tools to chart pregnancy and baby’s development.” The advice in
this section appears in a question-and-answer format.
Creating your baby registry
If you’ve created a Wish List and/or wedding registry, then creating a baby
registry will be child’s play (pun alert!) — and here’s how to do it:

4. Enter your e-mail address and password in the fields provided and
then click the Sign In Using Our Secure Server button.
You come to a page that looks like Figure 13-12. Don’t worry about the
Activate Registry business. I talk about that later in the chapter.
5. Enter your registry information.
Enter your first and last names in the field provided, and then use the
drop-down menu to enter the due date. Your partner’s name is optional
and so are any comments you might want to make (such as, “Please
don’t touch my belly.”) Also, notice that the Baby Store News box is
checked as a default. If you don’t want to receive e-mail about the Baby
store, uncheck the box.
6. Enter your shipping address in the fields provided.
People viewing your registry will only be able to see your city and state.
No need to worry about privacy here. Also, in-store employees won’t be
able to see the second line of your address; if you possibly can, put your
address info on line one.
7. Click the Submit button.
If you’ve taken a bit of time, you may be asked to sign in again. Enter
your e-mail address and password in the fields provided, and click that
yellow button! You come to a page that confirms that your registry has
been created.
8. Search for items that you want in your registry.
Add items to your registry by using one of the two Quick Start Registries
or by shopping the Baby store.

Registry button. If you’re shopping the Baby Store click the Add to
Baby Registry button next to each item on its detail page.
After you create your registry, you’ll get an e-mail from Amazon confirming it.
Activating an existing registry
If you already have a registry with an ‘R’ Us store, and indicated that you
wanted to be able to see it online, you can view it and buy from it at Amazon.
You won’t, however, be able to change or edit it. To do that you have to acti-
vate it. If you gave the ‘R’ Us folks your e-mail address when you created your
registry in the store, they should have sent you an e-mail with instructions on
how to activate your registry. If not, you can request another e-mail by clicking
the Activate Registry button on your registry page. Enter your e-mail address
and your registry number and click the Send E-Mail button. Amazon will send
the ‘R’ Us store an e-mail requesting that they send you instructions.
Quick Start registries
The Baby store has two Quick Start registries: Bestsellers and Top of the Line.
They function the same way the Kitchen & Housewares Quick Start registry
does for Wedding Registry types, but with one critical difference: instead of
checking what you want, you uncheck the items you don’t want. Tricky, I know. 
You can access the Quick Start registries from your registry page. You find
the Quick Start Registries link at the top center of the page, just below your
greeting. Click it and then choose which registry you want. Within the reg-
istry, just uncheck the boxes for the items you don’t want on your registry
and click one of the two Add to Baby Registry buttons on the page. (Again,
there’s one at the top and another at the bottom.) 
Updating your registry
You update your registry right on your registry page. You can access your
registry directly from the subnav of the Baby store.
Here are some key things you can do from this page:
 Share your registry. This link sits at the top center of the page along
with the Quick Start Registries and New Parent’s Checklist. Amazon
sends an e-mail on your behalf, informing your list of your registry. All
you need do is enter the e-mail addresses of the potential gift givers.
211
Chapter 13: Giving (and Getting) Good Gifts

 Edit your registry and shipping information. You can do this from the
Your Information box on the upper-left side of the page.
 Access the New Parent’s Checklist. This is a good resource. It’s a
very comprehensive list and can help jog your memory lest you forget
something.
And you’ll find these editing options under each item in the registry:
 Change quantities. The default for the Desired box is 1. Enter whatever
number you like, and make sure you click the Save Changes button.
 Delete items. Do this by simply clicking the Delete button underneath the
item.
 Find someone else’s baby registry. The Baby Registry Search box sits
just below the Your Information box.
Finding someone else’s baby registry
Finding a registry is a lot like finding a Wish List. Here’s how you do it:
1. Click Baby Registry in the Store Directory.
You can access the Store Directory by clicking See More Stores above
the nav on any page of the site. You can also access the Baby Registry
by clicking it in the subnav of the Baby store.
2. Enter the information for the person you’re searching for in the fields
provided in the Baby Registry Search box.
You can search by name and location, registry number, or e-mail.
3. Click the Find It! button.
Even if there’s only one match, you come to a Search Results page.
4. Click the name of the person whose registry you want to view.
Notice that the registry is broken down by items available online and
items that you have to buy in the store. You can use the store locator to
find a store near you that has that item in stock. You can also view the
items on the list that have already been purchased. 
When All Else Fails: Gift Explorer
You’ve searched tirelessly for a Wish List or registry. You’ve sent them an
e-mail asking them to create a Wish List or registry. But there’s no Wish List
and no registry. It’s time for the Gift Explorer — a handy, fun feature that
helps you find gifts that match the recipients’ interests.

Part III: The More the Merrier: The Amazon.com Community 

You can access Gift Explorer from the Search box on the Gifts store home
page. That particular Search box is set up with the Gift Explorer function
ready to go. Just enter a keyword in the field provided, make sure the Use Gift
Explorer box is checked, and click Go. You get search results that look like
Figure 13-13. The results are broken out by store and you can use the More
Like These buttons to help refine your results further.

In this part . . .
E
veryone knows you can buy things at Amazon.com.
There are more than 30 million people doing it! But
not everyone knows that you can use the site to make
money — lots of money.
In this part, I show you how to use Amazon.com to make
money. I cover Marketplace, Auctions, and zShops — 
selling programs that anyone can use. I talk about
Amazon.com Advantage — a program for independent
publishers, labels, and studios. And I give you a complete
overview of Associates — Amazon’s 1,000,000-member
Web-referral program.

F
ew people know just how many moneymaking opportunities there are at
Amazon.com. Amazon is an actual store. It’s true. But it’s also a store
that allows you, the customer, to become a merchant. With a hefty dash of
the right stuff and enough time to spare, you can actually make a living using
Amazon.com. There are two ways to do that: You can sell stuff yourself or
you can partner.
Selling stuff is pretty simple in concept. You have something you want to sell;
you post it on the site using one of Amazon’s selling venues; Amazon takes a
cut when someone buys it. For those of you who are thinking, “I don’t want to
give them a cut! I’m going to sell it on my own.” Just remember, they have a
store all set up for you — and (more important) 37 million customers. Take
my word for it. It’s worth it!
Partnering is a little bit less defined but can be equally lucrative. Amazon has
a couple of different partnering opportunities that are something like referral
programs — you put links to Amazon on your site and if people use them and
buy, you get paid. These are for people who have their own Web sites and
want to use them to earn extra cash (and you’d be amazed at how much
extra cash some people earn!).
In this chapter, I cover the basics of all of Amazon’s moneymaking opportuni-
ties. I give you a general overview of each, talk about how you get paid, cover
the rules and regulations, and point you to some advanced techniques to
make the most of your efforts.

A Quick Look at the Venues
There are six moneymaking venues at Amazon.com — Marketplace, Auctions,
zShops, Advantage, Associates, and Honor System — and you’ve probably
come across at least half of them without even realizing it. In fact, some of
them are woven into the site seamlessly.
Each program falls into one of the two categories I’ve described — a selling
opportunity or a partnering opportunity. If you don’t have a Web site of your
own, you won’t be able to take advantage of the partnering opportunities. But
the selling is for everyone.
Marketplace
Marketplace is Amazon’s consignment program. If you’ve shopped at
Amazon, you’ve seen Marketplace in action. You find Marketplace items on
the detail pages. Maybe you’ve noticed the invitation to buy an item used
(as in Figure 14-1). Those items are being sold through Marketplace.
Marketplace is the “Everyman” selling tool. Anyone can use it and it’s rela-
tively simple to set up. Also, you can sell in any quantity — one-offs or bulk
loads. It’s the most flexible of Amazon’s selling programs. Of course, there are
some rules and restrictions associated with Marketplace (you can scope
them out in Chapter 15). But if you’re just looking to try out some Amazon
opportunities — just dipping your foot in the online selling pool, as it were —
Marketplace is a good place to start.
Here are the basics of the program:
 The item you sell has to be in Amazon’s catalog. They feature the item
on the detail page, right next to the brand-new one they’re selling. So if
they don’t sell the item already, there isn’t a page in the catalog, and that
means no place to feature your product. You can even sell collectible
versions of items they have in their catalog.
Figure 14-1:

place items.
218
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

 You set a fixed price. Marketplace is not an eBay-style online auction.
It’s a fixed-price sale. If you’re uncertain as to how to price your items,
Amazon makes a suggestion.
 Amazon takes a cut. They charge a 99-cent-per-item flat fee plus a per-
centage commission. (In effect, it’s not worth your while to sell an item
for $1.50.)
 You do the shipping, but Amazon gives you a shipping credit. Amazon
gives you a shipping credit based on the item you sell — different items
earn different amounts — and where and how quickly you ship. You ship
the item directly to your buyer. Amazon has clear guidelines about how
to pack and ship appropriately posted on their site.
 All payments happen through Amazon. You won’t receive money
directly from your buyer. They pay Amazon and Amazon pays you.
Auctions
This is Amazon’s version of the eBay concept — online auctions of just about
any item you’d care to sell. Unlike Marketplace, you don’t have to auction off
an item that’s identical to items already in Amazon’s catalog, though you
could if you wanted to.
Auctions offers more freedom in terms of what you can list, but less expo-
sure. Because Marketplace items are featured in the stores on regular detail
pages, they get all the exposure that those items get. Auctions are in a store
of their own — slightly buried — and each item has its own detail page. So
when you auction an item at Amazon, you are relying on customers to look
for that item specifically. 
In many ways, Marketplace has upstaged Auctions. Amazon offers so many dif-
ferent products now, it’s hard to imagine what you might sell that you couldn’t
find in their catalog. Still, Auctions can be a good place to sell certain things —
most notably, collectibles that aren’t already in Amazon’s catalog — because
you can sell such collectibles at a fixed price through Marketplace. (In other
words, you’re better off selling a collectible book through Marketplace than
you are through Auctions, because in Marketplace you have the benefit of the
bookstore’s exposure — more potential customers looking for what you’re
offering.)
The basics of Auctions are simple:
 You post an item on the Auctions site. There are rules about what you
can and can’t sell. See Chapter 16 for the details.
 Amazon customers bid on your item. Of course, it goes to the highest
bidder.
219
Chapter 14: The Basics of Using Amazon.com to Build Bucks

 You collect payment through Amazon or on your own. All Amazon sell-
ers sign up for Amazon Payments, but Auctions sellers are also allowed
to accept other methods of payment. More on Amazon Payments later in
this chapter. (More on other methods of payment in Chapter 16.)
 You do the shipping. Alas, no shipping credit here, but most Auctions
sellers have the buyer pay for shipping as part of the deal.
 Amazon takes a cut. They charge a ten-cent listing fee per item that is
not refundable, even if the item doesn’t sell. If the item does sell, they
also charge a percentage as a closing fee.
Amazon’s fees are generally lower than eBay’s, but fewer customers shop
Amazon’s auctions, so the final price you get may well be lower too. Just a
thought. . . .
zShops
zShops are mini stores created by independent sellers. They’re a trickier
proposition in terms of set-up. Normally you would only want to set up a
zShop if you had several items you wanted to sell — ideally, a selection of
items that would make sense together all in one online store. To find out
more about setting up a zShop, check out Chapter 16.
The basics of zShops are as follows:
 You create a storefront on Amazon.com. When you sign up for zShops,
you actually have your own storefront that may look something like
Figure 14-2. You upload images and/or descriptions of your products to
your storefront.
 You sell items at a fixed price. These can be items that are also in
Amazon’s catalog, or unique items that aren’t.
 You collect payment through Amazon or on your own. Like Auctions
sellers, zShops sellers are allowed to accept other methods of payment
in addition to Amazon Payments.
 You ship. Again, no credit here, but you can have the buyer pay for
shipping.
 Amazon takes a cut. All zShops merchants are required to become Pro
Merchant subscribers. There is a monthly fee of $39.99 for up to 40,000
items. (See? They really do intend for you to have your own store!) They
also charge a percentage as a closing fee.
220
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

Advantage
Advantage is a program that Amazon developed to help independent publish-
ers, studios, and labels sell their work. So if you have independently pro-
duced videos, albums, or books and you need some help with distribution,
Advantage is for you.
Advantage is actually a very elaborate program and can make a huge differ-
ence in the life of an independent artist. But it’s not as “autopilot” as other
Amazon selling opportunities. For Advantage to work, you have to put in
some effort — not just on setup, but in maintenance too. 
One of the nice things about Advantage is that your products are sold on the
site the same way any label’s, publisher’s or studio’s products are sold. They
show up in browse lists and search results — indistinguishable from bigger
fishes titles. If they’re especially good, they may get the attention of an Amazon
editor who might feature them. But at the end of the day, you are responsible
for marketing your titles. Amazon just takes care of the selling logistics and
the fulfillment. To discover more about Advantage, look at Chapter 17.
Here are the basics of the Advantage program:
 You apply to the Advantage program. They don’t accept just anybody.
Your products have to have the appropriate codes: ISBN or UPC. They
must also be appropriate in terms of content (that is, no porn or other
unsavory material).
Figure 14-2:
A zShops
storefront.
221
Chapter 14: The Basics of Using Amazon.com to Build Bucks

 You send products to Amazon’s distribution centers. If you’re
accepted, they send you an order. When they get low on inventory, they
let you know and you can send more goods.
 Amazon does the shipping. The nice thing about Advantage is that
Amazon handles the fulfillment so you never have to worry about get-
ting the goods to the customer.
 Amazon pays you and takes a cut. The program has an annual fee of
$29.95. Each month, Amazon sends you a check for 45 percent of the
list price of the items you’ve sold. In other words, they take a 55 percent
cut. This may sound hefty, but keep in mind that you can list titles that
aren’t in Amazon’s catalog, and they handle the fulfillment to individual
customers.
Associates
Associates is Amazon’s referral program and it’s the largest Web-referral pro-
gram in existence, with almost 1,000,000 members. It’s a very basic concept:
You put a link to Amazon on your Web site and whenever anyone uses it to go
to the site and buy something, you get a referral fee.
Anyone with an appropriate Web site can be an Amazon.com Associate. The
program is free and it’s pretty easy to sign up. For more on Associates, read
Chapter 18.
Honor System
This is the newest kid on the block. Honor System is a program that allows
you to collect voluntary donations or ask for payments (for using your digital
content) from the people who visit your Web site. They click a graphic that
Amazon supplies, and the transaction occurs through Amazon.com. (To see
one of these graphics, check out www.recipesource.com. Scroll down a bit —
it’s on the left side well below the fold.)
In terms of payment, Honor System is closer to Marketplace or zShops than it
is to Associates. For each Honor System payment you receive, Amazon
charges you a flat fee of $.15 and 5 percent commission. 
The Check Isn’t in the Mail: Getting Paid
There are lots of things that make selling or partnering with Amazon a good
idea — tons of customers, giant store already in existence — but getting paid
might be the best reason of all. When you deal with Amazon, you get paid.
222
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

They’re all set up for it. It’s easy for you. It’s easy for your customers (because
they’re really Amazon’s customers). It’s great. And anyone who has ever had
the unpleasant experience of trying to track down a customer for payment
knows just how great it is to have someone else do it for you.
Signing up for Amazon Payments
Advantage, Associates, and Honor System have their own methods of pay-
ment. Basically, you have an account on Amazon’s site that shows you how
much you’ve earned and they send you a monthly check or you can elect to
have the money moved directly into your bank account. (More on this in
Chapters 17 and 18.)
Amazon Payments is what you use to get paid for your Marketplace,
Auctions, and zShops sales. You don’t have to use Amazon Payments for the
latter two, but it’s what makes getting paid so simple.
You’re required to sign up for Amazon Payments when you list your first item
or items in Marketplace, Auctions, or zShops. It’s part of the process. You can
also sign up for Amazon Payments without listing an item — just to get ready. 
You don’t have to have a preexisting account at Amazon to sell there, but you
do need to set one up in the process of signing up for Amazon Payments.
Here’s how to sign up if you don’t already have an Amazon account:
1. Go to the Help Department.
Do this by clicking on Help in the shopping tools menu at the top of
almost any page on the site.
2. Click the Selling at Amazon.com link.
You have to scroll below the fold to find this header.
3. Click the Amazon Payments Help link in the Browse box.
The Browse box is on the top left of the page.
4. Click the Apply Now link in the first paragraph of text.
This is where the application process actually begins. The very first
thing you’re asked to do is sign in.
5. Enter your e-mail address in the field provided, click the circle that says
that you don’t have a password, and then click the Continue button.
You come to a screen that asks you to create a password. Be sure to pick
something easy for you to remember and very hard (heck, let’s shoot for
impossible) for someone else to guess.
6. Enter your first and last names in the fields provided, enter your pass-
word twice, and then click Continue.
223
Chapter 14: The Basics of Using Amazon.com to Build Bucks

7. Enter your credit-card number and cardholder name in the fields
provided.
Before you can use Amazon Payments, you have to give Amazon your
credit-card info. They use it to deduct their share should you decide to
have buyers pay you independently. It’s totally secure, but if you’re con-
cerned, click the Why This Is Safe link in the introductory text.
8. Use the drop-down menus to choose card type and expiration date
and then click Continue.
You’ll need to supply the billing address associated with the card you gave.
9. Enter your name, billing address, and phone number in the fields pro-
vided and then click Continue.
You come to a page that looks like Figure 14-3. If you already had an
Amazon.com account, this would be the first page you’d see after sign-
ing in. Confirm that all the information on this page is as it should be. If
you want to change your nickname, do. Remember, this is the name that
your buyers see, so if you don’t want a bunch of crazy, unsolicited
e-mails, don’t use your e-mail address here. Also, if you’re a preexisting
account holder, you may need to fill in the phone number fields and the
nickname box. Mine were empty when I signed in.
10. Check the box that indicates that you’ve read and agree to the
Participation Agreement and then click Continue.
I know it’s not fun to read the agreement, but do it anyway. Also, you
notice that at the bottom of the page there is the option to give Amazon
your checking account number or do it later. The default is set at “do it
later” and that’s what I’d do. If you sell something, you can enter it then.
Figure 14-3:
The Amazon
Payments

224
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

You come to a page confirming your account has been set up. Now you’re
ready to sell!
Setting up Amazon Payments if you do already have an Amazon account is
much faster. Here’s how:
1. Click the Selling at Amazon.com link in the Help Department.
2. Click the Amazon Payments Help link in the Browse box.
Again, you find the Browse box on the top left of the page.
3. Click the Apply Now link in the first paragraph of text.
This is where the application process actually begins. The very first
thing you’re asked to do is sign in.
4. Enter your e-mail address and password in the fields provided and
then click the Continue button.
Now is when you come to a page that looks like Figure 14-3. 
5. Enter your phone number and nickname in the fields provided.
These fields were empty when I signed in to the form.
6. Check the box that indicates that you’ve read and agree to the
Participation Agreement and then click Continue.
That’s it. You’re done. You’ve just set up Amazon Payments.
Show me the money
Once your Amazon Payments application is accepted — and if you have a
valid credit card, you shouldn’t have any problem with that — you’re ready
to sell. Amazon deposits the money from your Amazon Payments account
into your checking account every 14 days. If you didn’t enter your checking
account info in the application process, you’re asked to do it after you make
your first sale and they deposit the funds 14 days after that. If you want the
funds transferred more regularly, you can arrange that through your seller
account after the original 14-day cycle.
So how much do you get? That depends on what you sell and where you sell it.
Table 14-1 gives you a quick overview of each moneymaking venue and the fees
and commissions associated with it. Table 14-2 gives you the rundown on
Amazon’s shipping credit.
Sometimes, the shipping credit is more than it actually costs you to ship.
That’ll put a few extra coins in your purse!

If You Don’t Have Anything 
Nice to Say . . . 
People know they can trust Amazon.com. But how do they determine if an
individual seller on Amazon is going to be honorable and trustworthy? The
answer is feedback.
Giving and getting feedback is a critical part of the Marketplace, Auctions,
and zShops communities. The feedback star rating is a lot like customer
review stars, except instead of rating the product, they’re rating you!
227
Chapter 14: The Basics of Using Amazon.com to Build Bucks

Feedback basics
Every time you sell something at Amazon.com, your buyer has 60 days to
give you a feedback rating. They fill out a form that looks like Figure 14-4 and
their comments show up in your public Member Profile (see Figure 14-5). You
also receive a score from 1 to 5 stars, with 1 being the worst and 5 being
excellent. Each star rating you get figures in to your average and display with
your nickname on both your Member Profile page and all your items’ detail
pages. As a seller, you should take care to make sure your rating is a good
one. After all, it follows you wherever you go.
Here’s how to stay in good feedback graces:
 Tell the truth. There is nothing worse than misrepresenting your prod-
uct. Tell the truth about what you’re selling and be specific! Give an
accurate description of the item’s condition. Be truthful about its
authenticity. Be straightforward and you avoid a lot of hassles and bad
feedback. When it comes to selling on Amazon, honesty is definitely the
best policy.
 Ship it fast. When people buy things from Amazon, they know when to
expect them. Clearly you don’t have the same distribution system at
your fingertips, but you are still expected to uphold Amazon’s tradition
of timely shipping. People want their stuff, you know?
 Pack it well. If you don’t, and it gets damaged en route, you’re going to
have an angry customer nipping at your feedback heels. Amazon has very
clear guidelines about how to pack items on their site. (See Chapter 15
for more info.) Follow them and you should be fine.
Figure 14-4:
The
feedback
form is

reputation is
made or

228
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

 Stay in touch. Don’t be a stranger. Contact your buyer quickly to arrange
shipping. Be responsive if there’s some kind of problem. Let them know
when you’ve shipped the item. Pretend that you’re Amazon.com, and
provide the kind of good service they give their customers. 
Giving feedback on your feedback
You should know that after feedback is submitted, it can’t be changed. So you
really only get one chance with each customer. You might have ten perfect
fives on your record, but screw up once, and your stars reflect it.
However, things happen, and sometimes a sale goes south. Maybe you have a
disagreement with a customer. Maybe you’re just having a bad month. You
can’t remove feedback, but you can comment on the feedback you’ve been
given. Here’s how:
1. Click on Your Account in the Shopping Tools menu.
The Shopping Tools menu is at the top of every page on the site.
2. Click the Your Seller Account link.
You find this in the Auctions, zShops, and Marketplace box on the right
side of the page.
3. Click the View Your Member Profile link.
You need to scroll down a bit. It’s below the fold, under the Your
Storefront and Profile header.
Figure 14-5:

Chapter 14: The Basics of Using Amazon.com to Build Bucks

4. Click the Leave Feedback link.
This is in the first box of your Member Profile, just under your stars.
5. Enter your comments in the field provided and then click Submit.
Don’t forget that all feedback — even feedback on your feedback — is
permanent. So enter your comments thoughtfully. Also, you can’t
respond to individual ratings or comments, so you may want to refer to
the comment you’re addressing.
Hey Big Seller: Pro Merchant
Subscriptions
Amazon says that the Pro Merchant subscription is for “frequent sellers.” To
me, that means anyone selling enough Marketplace items each month that
they’re paying more in flat fees than the $39.99 cost of the subscription.
Because the Marketplace flat fee is about a buck per sale, you’d have to be
selling more than 40 items a month to make the Pro Merchant subscription
worth your while. (Pro Merchants also get their Auctions listing fees waived,
but because that fee is only ten cents apiece, you’d have to be listing more
than 400 items a month for it to matter and something tells me you’re not
doing that.)
Amazon only waives the flat fee with Pro Merchant subscriptions. You are
still responsible for paying the commissions. 
So what are the perks? These are the reasons to become a Pro Merchant at
Amazon.com:
 You are selling more than 40 items each month. If you’re a big seller,
Pro Merchant can save you money.
 You automatically get a zShops storefront. Only Pro Merchants get
storefronts. Having all your goods in one, easy-to-use place makes for
good selling, especially if you have a way to point people to your store
(say from your own Web site).
 You get to use the Inventory Loader. This is a bulk loading tool that can
save you lots of time. It allows you enter all the items you’re selling into
one Excel spreadsheet and then upload it to the site at once!
 You can list as many marketplace items as you want. You have a limit
of 40,000 items for zShops and Auctions, but you can list the day away in
Marketplace.

 You get to use Auction Pro. If you are a big Auctions seller, Auction Pro
can help you. It’s an invitation-only program for Auctions sellers who
sell a lot and have a high rating. Auction Pros get an icon by their dis-
play name, marketing incentives, and other perks. You have to be a Pro
Merchant to apply.
How to sign up
In order to be a Pro Merchant, you need to have an Amazon account and you
need to be set up for Amazon Payments. If you’re not, Amazon walks you
through the process as a part of Pro Merchant sign-up. In fact, if you don’t
already have an Amazon account, the Pro Merchant sign-up process is virtu-
ally the same as the Amazon Payments sign-up process, with the key differ-
ence being you have to start from the Pro Merchant subscription page.
Here’s how to sign up for a Pro Merchant subscription if you don’t already
have an Amazon account:
1. Click Help in the Shopping Tools menu.
This is at the top of every page on the site.
2. Enter Pro Merchant in the Search field and then click Go.
You find the Search box at the top of the page. The very first search
result you see is for the Pro Merchant subscription.
3. Click the Pro Merchant Subscription link.
4. Click the Review the Terms and Subscribe link.
This lives in the first paragraph of text on the page. For the record, the
terms on the next page are the same as the terms on the first Pro
Merchant subscription page.
5. In the new page that appears, click the Click Here To Start Your
Subscription button.
You’re taken to a Sign In screen.
6. Enter your e-mail address in the field provided, click the circle that
says that you don’t have a password and then click the Continue
button.
You come to a screen that asks you to create a password. Be sure to pick
something easy for you to remember and very hard for someone else to
guess.
7. Enter your first and last names in the fields provided, enter your pass-
word twice, and then click Continue.

8. Enter your credit-card number and cardholder name in the fields
provided.
In order to be a Pro Merchant, you have to give Amazon your credit-card
info. 
9. Use the drop-down menus to choose card type and expiration date
and then click Continue.
You need to supply the billing address associated with the card you gave.
10. Enter your name, billing address, and phone number in the fields pro-
vided and then click Continue.

To become a Pro Merchant if you do already have an Amazon account, com-
plete the following abridged version:
1. Click Help in the Shopping Tools menu.
This is at the top of every page on the site.
2. Enter “pro merchant” in the search field and click “Go.”
You find the search box at the top of the page. The very first search
result you see is for the Pro Merchant subscription.
3. Click the Pro Merchant Subscription link.
4. Click the Review the Terms and Subscribe link.
This lives in the first paragraph of text on the page. For the record, the
terms on the next page are the same as the terms on the first Pro
Merchant subscription page.
5. Click the Click Here To Start Your Subscription button.
You’re taken to a Sign In screen.
6. Enter your password in the field provided and then click the Continue
button.
You come to the registration form. 
7. Enter your daytime phone number in the field provided and then
click Continue.
You may also want to change your nickname. Amazon supplies one, but
if you don’t like it, feel free to change it.
8. Check the box that indicates that you’ve read and agree to the
Participation Agreement and then click Continue.

Closing up shop
You may find that you’re just not selling enough to make a Pro Merchant
account worth your while. No problem. You can cancel your account at any
time and you won’t be charged for the upcoming month.
Here’s how to cancel your account:
1. Click Your Account in the Shopping Tools menu.
This is at the top of every page on the site.
2. Click the Your Seller Account link.
You find this in the Auctions, zShops, and Marketplace box on the right
side of the page.
3. Click Edit Your Buyer and Seller Settings.
This link is below the fold under the Your Account Settings header.
4. Click the Cancel Subscription link next to the Pro Merchant
Subscription header.
5. Click the Click Here To Cancel Your Pro Merchant Subscription
button.
Your subscription is cancelled! So you know, your subscription runs on a
month to month schedule based on the day you signed up. If you signed up
on the 15th of the month and cancel on the 25th, technically you’re a member
until the 15th of the following month but your subscription won’t renew. In
other words, Amazon doesn’t prorate your account.
For the Not-So-Dumb Dummies:
Web Services
According to Amazon.com, Web Services are “self-contained applications that
can be published and invoked across the Web using XML-based protocols.”
I’m going to decipher that in a minute, but first let me tell you that you only
need to read this if you have a Web site and/or are a software developer.
Amazon’s Web services are for people who want to enhance their own Web
sites, develop applications for other people who have Web sites, or develop
applications to help people sell products through Marketplace (things like
pricing software and inventory loading tools). If that doesn’t describe you,
move on. I beg of you . . . spare yourself!
233
Chapter 14: The Basics of Using Amazon.com to Build Bucks

The Dummies definition
First of all, Web services are not just an Amazon thing. They’re a Web thing
and lots of people are excited about them. There are books on it. (In fact, one
of them is called .NET Web Services For Dummies.) Still, for most of us, they’re
a mystery. We might interact with them regularly, but we don’t know it.
The Amazon definition of Web services is a chunky one. (I’m a Web savvy
person and when I read it my eyes began to cross a little.) My “Dummies” def-
inition is decidedly less chunky, but probably loses some of the meaning. So
all you developers out there, forgive me.
Web services are modular applications that can talk to each other. And because
they can talk to each other, they can share information in a symbiotic way. But
it’s easier for us laymen to understand Web services in terms of what they do. 
Here’s a non-Amazon example: someone with a travel log Web site includes a
Web services application from an online travel company so that their visitors
can buy tickets without leaving their site. They’re happy because they’ve pro-
vided a good service and kept their visitor there, and the online travel com-
pany is happy because they’ve made a sale. 
Amazon’s Web services foster the same kind of symbiosis. A developer might
use Amazon’s Web services to show Amazon search results on his or her own
Web site. You can also use Amazon’s Web services to let your customers add
items to their shopping cart without leaving your site. Conceptually,
Amazon’s Web services are a souped-up version of the Associates Program.
Functionally, they work in tandem because if you want to earn money using
Amazon Web services, you must also be an Associate.
Where to go to find out more about it
If you are interested in using Amazon’s Web services, you can find out more
about the whole process and even download a developer’s kit for free from
the Amazon site. Your door to Web services development is just three quick
steps (and a degree in computer science) away:
1. Go to www.amazon.com.
If you’re already at Amazon, that means you should click the Welcome tab.
2. Click Sell Your Stuff in the subnav.
You’re in the Make Money area of the site. Notice that all tabs have gone
away except the Make Money tab and the Welcome tab.
3. Click Web Services in the subnav.
You’ll find yourself at the Web Services page — lots of good resources in
the left nav!
234
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

You’ll find all kinds of goodies in the Web Services section: discussion
boards, tutorials, sample sites, “developer chat” (ooh la la). This is where
you should go not only to find out about the program, but also to download
the tools you’ll need to start using the program.
If you want to check out a few sites that are using Web services, try
www.nba.com, www.ipilot.net, or www.sellerengine.com.
The Fine Print: Rules and Policies
If you started your own business selling items on the Web, you’d have a lot of
paperwork to do — lawyer stuff, IRS stuff, and insurance stuff. When you sell
things at Amazon, they’ve done a lot of that work for you. Still, you can’t
escape the fine print.
There are rules and policies for each of the selling opportunities at
Amazon.com. Before you embark on your first sale, you should familiarize
yourself with them. Don’t forget that when you post an item on their site,
you’re entering into a business agreement. So make sure you know what
that means. 
Here are some of the important rules and policies for selling with
Marketplace, Auctions, or zShops:
 No naughty content. Nine out of ten times you can use common sense
to determine what you can and can’t sell on Amazon.com. But for that
tenth time, read the prohibited content list in Chapter 1.
 Describe your product accurately. Amazon has specific guidelines
about how to list the condition of your items. For example, “new” means
brand new, unopened, in perfect condition. Also, be as straightforward
as you can be. Neglecting to mention something about your item is no
better than outright misrepresentation.
 Don’t abuse the ratings forum. Don’t post ratings to your own account.
Don’t take out a personal vendetta on someone else’s. The ratings are
the only way buyers have of evaluating sellers. So keep it clean and
honest.
 Only contact your buyer as it relates to your transaction. I once bought
a pair of cycling shorts on eBay and the seller proceeded to bombard me
with spam. Don’t do that. And definitely don’t contact your seller in any
kind of social way. This is business, man!
 Don’t bid on your own auction to jack up the price. This is called “shill
bidding” and it’s very taboo in the world of online auctions. I don’t think
I need to tell you why.
235
Chapter 14: The Basics of Using Amazon.com to Build Bucks

There are many other rules associated with these programs. You find them in
the Help department, along with the condition guidelines, the prohibited con-
tent list, and a whole lot of other stuff. Here’s how to find them:
1. Click Help in the Shopping Tools menu.
Yes. It’s still at the top of each page.
2. Click Policies, Glossaries, and FAQs.
You find the link under the Selling at Amazon.com header.
3. Click on Policy Information.
Everything here is important, particularly the Participation Agreement
as that’s the legal contract. The community rules — we’re talking the
Amazon community here, not your home community — are also very
important. 
Changed your mind?
What do you do if you list something on the site and then change your mind?
You can delete a Marketplace or zShops listing at any time provided it hasn’t
already been purchased. You can delete an Auctions item only if it has no bids.
Here’s how to delete a Marketplace, zShops, or Auctions listing from the site:
1. Click Your Account in the Shopping Tools menu.
This is at the top of every page on the site.
2. Click the Your Seller Account link.
You find this in the Auctions, zShops, and Marketplace box on the right
side of the page. Your Seller Account page looks something like Figure 14-6.
3. Click the appropriate Open or Opening Soon link.
Click one of the Open or Opening Soon links depending on when and
where you listed your item. If your item hasn’t posted to the site yet,
choose Opening Soon for either Marketplace and zShops or for Auctions.
If your item is already up on the site, choose the appropriate Open link.
4. Click the Modify This Listing link.
Don’t click the title of your item. That leads to your listing page. You
want the link beneath the item you want to cancel.
5. Click the Close This Listing Now button.
On the next screen, you’re asked to give a reason for why you’re closing
the listing. This reason shows up on the listing page, so be professional
but honest.
236
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

6. Enter your reason for closing and click the Close This Listing Now
button.
That’s all it takes. You receive an e-mail confirming your cancellation
almost immediately.
Returns
As part of doing business with Amazon, you are required to accept returns —
even if the item is exactly as you said it was. If you do have a buyer who
wants to return an item, you need to work out the logistics between the two
of you. Your buyer can’t return the item using the site the way they would
with an item bought from Amazon.com.
A few things to note:
 All returns must happen within 60 days of the transaction.
 If the return is not due to your error, feel no obligation to refund the
buyer’s shipping costs.
 If you are at fault, you should reimburse all shipping costs.
 If you did not use Amazon Payments for the transaction, you need to
administer the refund on your own — the steps below won’t help you.
 If you are in no way at fault and you feel that the item has lost some of
it’s salability, you may decide to issue a partial refund. This is something
you should work with your buyer, though, before you initiate it.

Chapter 14: The Basics of Using Amazon.com to Build Bucks

When a buyer returns an item, you have to refund at least some of their money
and it’s your responsibility to initiate the refund. Again, they can’t go to the
site and return the item themselves. Here’s how to refund a buyer’s money —
assuming that you used Amazon Payments for the initial transaction:
1. Click Your Account in the Shopping Tools menu.
This is at the top of every page on the site.
2. Click the Your Seller Account link.
You find this in the Auctions, zShops, and Marketplace box on the right
side of the page.
3. Click the Manage Your Amazon Payments Account/View Billing
History link.
4. Click the Search Your Payments Transactions link.

My Stupid Fight Club Story: 
A Lesson in Haste and Forgiveness
I have actually committed an Amazon cardinal
sin. I have neglected to ship an item that I sold
on Marketplace. Here’s what happened:
About a year or two ago I wanted to try
out Marketplace. I grabbed a book off of my
bookshelf — one that I’d read and was willing
to part with — and posted it on the site. I chose
a hardback book because I felt like it wouldn’t
be worth my while to post a paperback. 
It was so easy. So fast. I entered the ISBN,
entered Amazon’s recommended price, and
voila! I couldn’t wait to go look at my used Fight
Club listing. Imagine my horror when I found that
my book was the cheapest used one listed —
by about $110. Turns out I had a first run edition
worth at least $120 bucks. I’d listed mine for $16. 
I scrambled to cancel the item, but it was
snapped up immediately. Some unsuspecting
person had just scored big. I was beside myself.
How could I have been so stupid? Why didn’t I
do my research? It would’ve taken me about 60
seconds.
And then I did the unthinkable. I wrote my buyer
an e-mail explaining my ignorant foible and
asked her if I could credit her account and sell
the book for something closer to its actual
value. She was a truly kind person and took pity
on me (so I sent her a nice Amazon gift certifi-
cate) but she shouldn’t have. I was in clear
violation of the rules. If I had it to do again, I’d
sell it to her for $16 and take the loss like a
champ. Instead I behaved like a rookie. Granted
I ended up selling the book for $120 (hey, that’s
a cashmere sweater!) but in the eyes of the
Marketplace community, I was a cur.
So the lesson . . . well there were actually two.
The first, and most obvious, is do your research.
The second is that you run into some very nice
people in your dealings on Amazon and it
behooves you to be equally as kind.

5. Enter your password in the field provided and click the Sign In Using
Our Secure Server button.
Notice that this is an unusual Sign In screen. It’s the same drill, though.
6. Use the drop-down menus to enter the date range for the transaction,
click the appropriate circle, and then click Search.
You can also choose to narrow your search by title, transaction type, or
status. You come to a page that looks like Figure 14-7.
7. Click the transaction ID for the appropriate item.
8. Click the Refund link.
9. Enter the amount of the refund in the field provided and click the
Refund button.
Amazon sets the default amount at a full refund. If you are giving a par-
tial refund, change the amount accordingly. You can also enter a com-
ment in the field provided. Use the drop-down menu to enter a reason
for your refund.
Amazon refunds the buyer’s credit card, deducts the refund amount from
your Payments account, and credits you their fees and commissions.
What if it gets broken on the way
It’s a bummer, but it happens. Even if you pack it precisely to Amazon’s stan-
dards, sometimes bad things occur in transit. If an item breaks en route, you
should give the buyer a complete refund and swallow the cost in the name of
your feedback rating. But if it was an expensive item, that’s gonna sting. 
Amazon is set up to protect buyers with the A-to-Z Guarantee. Some buyers
also ask you to get an escrow account. To protect yourself, you may want to
insure your package. You can insure packages at the U.S. Post Office, FedEx,
and UPS. It’s worth the extra cost.

Other potential pitfalls
Let’s face it. We live in an imperfect world. If you sell on Amazon long enough,
something is bound to go wrong. Here’s a short list of potential pitfalls and a
few words about what you can do:
 You shipped it and it came back to you. First off, make sure you
shipped it to the right address. If you didn’t, e-mail your buyer immedi-
ately, beg forgiveness, and get it back out the door (with the right
address) ASAP. Most normal buyers understand. If the address is cor-
rect, e-mail your buyer and get the scoop. Maybe they can supply you
with another address. If all else fails, refund the buyer.
 You shipped it and it got lost. If you didn’t insure the item, you just
have to eat the cost. Don’t accuse the buyer of trickery, even if you sus-
pect them. This could do nasty things to your rating. If, though, you
notice that the buyer has lots of bad feedback, you might report them to
Amazon by e-mailing reports@amazon.com. 
 A buyer files an A-to-Z Guarantee claim against you. This means that
you and your buyer came to an impasse. If you really feel you shouldn’t
have to refund their purchase and they really feel you should, they may
file a claim against you. Amazon sends you an e-mail to inform you of the
claim, asking you to tell them when the item was shipped. And that’s
pretty much it (although you can also expect to get a nasty rating from
that buyer).
If you have a “large” number of claims filed against you, Amazon termi-
nates your account. I don’t know how many “large” is, but if you have
more than two or three filed against you, I’m thinking you should give up
selling online.

mazon.com is its own little shopping ecosystem. You buy things. You
use them. And then you can sell them to someone else who buys them,
uses them, and maybe sells them to yet another person, and so on. It’s the
buying/selling circle of life. 
In this chapter I show you how to use Marketplace to sell the things you’ve
purchased at Amazon.com — and maybe things you didn’t buy there, but
that they sell. I tell you where to go to list your items, what items to list, and
how to describe them. I cover pricing, shipping, and communicating with
your buyer. I show you how to maximize this selling program so you can play
your role in the shopping circle of life.
Marketplace Basics
Amazon Marketplace is the backbone of selling on Amazon.com. It’s a simple
but brilliant idea: Let people sell the items they bought at Amazon to other
Amazon customers. After all, lots of people don’t care if their book or CD is
used. They’d rather save a few bucks. 
But Marketplace came from humble beginnings. Originally, the idea was to
compete with eBay, and Amazon Auctions was the way to sell on Amazon.com.
Then zShops was born — to give customers their own little space on the

site where they could sell fixed-price items that you couldn’t already find at
Amazon.com. But not every person wants a whole storefront, and not every-
one has something exotic to sell. So, with relatively little fanfare, Marketplace
came to be — and unlike Auctions and zShops, it’s flourishing.
Anyone can sell with Marketplace. They’ve made it incredibly simple to use.
But before you get started, there are a few things you need to know. Here are
the Marketplace basics:
 You can sell any item in Amazon’s catalog. And it doesn’t actually
matter where you bought it. 
 Your item is featured on the detail page of the same item that Amazon
is selling new. In my opinion, Marketplace has been successful because
of this arrangement. It’s basically free advertising. Every time someone
searches for that new book or video or other product, they’re inadver-
tently searching for your used version.
 There are four classifications of used items on Amazon.com. They are
“new” as in brand, spanking new, “collectible,” “refurbished,” which
means “good as new” still in its original box with an original manufac-
turer’s warranty, and regular, old “used.”
 You handle the shipping. You ship your item directly to your buyer.
Amazon supplies a shipping credit. 
 All payments are run through Amazon.com. This makes it easy. Buyers
can use their regular accounts to make their Marketplace purchases,
and you are paid through a program called Amazon Payments.
What you can and can’t sell 
using Marketplace
The short answer is that you can sell anything in their catalog. But, like all
good things, there are a few “buts.” Here are the things you can’t sell through
Marketplace:
 Promotional books, music, videos or DVDs. These are items that are
released early, usually to industry people for promotional purposes
(Amazon itself gets tons of them!). You can’t sell them on the site, as they
are not authorized for retail distribution or sale.
 Unauthorized and unlicensed merchandise. This applies to books,
music, videos, DVDs, and especially software. Here’s what Amazon has
to say about it: “All items sold through Amazon Marketplace must be
commercially produced and authorized or licensed as a retail product.” 
242
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

 Recopied media. It may be obvious to you, but I’ll say it anyway. You
can’t make a bunch of copies of your favorite Elton John CD and sell
them on Amazon.com. If you did, you’d be infringing on all kinds of copy-
rights and trademarks. Whole industries get upset about that, and
people have been sued and worse. (But you knew that.) 
Where to go to start selling
Before you go anywhere, go to your garage. Got a pile of stuff that is waiting
for a garage sale? There may be goodies in there that you can sell at Amazon
instead. Remember, it just has to be something in Amazon’s catalog — it
doesn’t matter if you didn’t buy it there. So cull through your giveaway pile,
your bookshelf, your CD collection. You’ll probably find tons of things to sell.
The next stop on the selling train is the site. Go to Amazon and see if your
items are there. Also, check out the More Buying Options box to see how
many (if any) are already being sold through Marketplace. It may be that
none are being sold used but that buyers are waiting. (If this is the case there
will be a “buyers waiting” message in the box.) That makes for some good
selling for you!
When you’ve found some stuff to sell and you’ve done your research, there
are two easy places you can go to list items through Marketplace: the detail
page and the Sell Your Stuff area.
To access the detail page of the item you want to sell, simply do a search for
that item and click the appropriate search result. (Need help searching? Read
Chapter 8.) You also need to do a search to ensure that the item is, in fact, in
Amazon’s catalog.
To access Marketplace listing pages from the Sell your Stuff area, do the
following:
1. Go to www.amazon.com. 
If you’re already on the site, but not at the Welcome page, click the
Welcome tab. Just so you know, you can only find Sell Your Stuff in the
subnav when you’re on the Welcome page.
2. Click Sell Your Stuff in the Subnav.
You come to a page that look likes Figure 15-1. This is the Marketplace
home base; you can search for your item from here by keyword or by
ISBN (for books only), ASIN, or UPC. Notice how both the tab and the
subnav have changed. You can access three of the six selling/partnering
opportunities from the Make Money subnav.
243
Chapter 15: The Buying/Selling Circle: Amazon.com Marketplace

Listing Your Item
Listing your items is actually a surprisingly simple process. You can do it
most easily from the detail page or from the Marketplace page in the Sell Your
Stuff (also known as Make Money) section of the site. I outline both processes
here, and then give you some more detailed tips and info on describing the
condition and setting your price later in this chapter.
In order to sell at Amazon.com, you need to have an Amazon account. If you
don’t, you’re walked through the process as a part of listing your item. You
can also read Chapter 3 to find out how to set up an Amazon account. But
just so you know, the instructions below assume that you already have an
Amazon.com account.
Here’s how to list an item from the detail page:
1. Go to the item’s detail page.
Do this by searching for the item and clicking the appropriate search
result.
2. Click the Sell Yours Here button.
You find it in the More Buying Choices box, just below the Ready to Buy?
box on the right side of the page. (See Figure 15-2.)
Figure 15-1:

place page

Money area.

Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

3. Verify your item.
The new page that appears (see Figure 15-3) asks you to verify that this is
the exact item you want to sell. This is actually a very important step —
especially if you’re selling a book. The classic pitfall is to accidentally
sell a paperback as a hardcover or vice versa. So do be sure to check!
4. Use the drop-down menu to describe the condition of your item.
You have several choices that range from new to collectible to used-
acceptable. More details on this later in the chapter.

5. Add your comments about the item in the field provided and click
Continue.
If you chose anything other than “new,” you may want to add comments
that give more details on the item’s condition. It’s not mandatory, but it’s
a good practice — an informed buyer is a happier buyer.
6. Enter your price in the field provided.
Amazon advises you of both the highest price you can enter and their
recommended price based on the condition you chose. More on this
later in the chapter.
7. Enter your zip code in the field provided.
This is the zip code for your Ship From location.
8. Select your shipping options by clicking the appropriate boxes and
click Continue.
You are required to offer standard shipping and you can choose to also
offer international and expedited shipping.
Offering international shipping increases the number of potential
buyers, but it also slightly increases the hassle factor, because you need
to figure out how to get it to, say, Eritrea. With expedited shipping you
get a larger shipping credit, but, of course, faster shipping costs more.
Still, it’s a good option to offer around the holidays, when all the pro-
crastinators (like moi) are desperate!
9. Confirm and click List Item For Sale.
You come to a page that looks like Figure 15-4. Notice that Amazon out-
lines all the money-related info associated with your items. You’ll find
things like how much you’re charging, what their fees are, and your ship-
ping credit — the amount Amazon tacks on to your payment to cover
shipping costs. Make sure that all the information is correct. 
Once you click the list button, your listing is official. You can change the
price or cancel the listing at any time until someone purchases your item. For
instructions on how to cancel a listing, read Chapter 14. Here’s how to
change the price of your listing:
1. Click on Your Account in the Shopping Tools menu.
You’ll find this at the top of most pages on the site.
2. Click on Your Seller Account in the Auctions, zShops, and Marketplace
box.
This is on the right side of the page. When you click, it takes you to the
Your Seller Account page.
246
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

3. Click on the appropriate link under the View Items heading.
You’ll find this in the Your Inventory section. If you’ve just listed the
item (as in, ten minutes ago) and want to change the price, click the
Opening Soon link next to Amazon.com Marketplace and zShops. If the
listing is already open, click the Open link next to Amazon.com
Marketplace.
4. Click Modify This Listing under the appropriate item.
This will take you to that item’s information page where you can edit the

Describing the condition
I can’t stress enough how important it is to list your item accurately!
Amazon.com has very specific guidelines for describing the condition of the
items you sell on Marketplace. Make sure you follow them to the letter. You
don’t want to be that seller who fibbed (even unintentionally) about their
item. That makes for some stinky ratings (ratings being the public feedback
that your buyers give you).
The classifications for item condition include both the status of the item
and — for a used item — its physical condition. An item can be one of four
statuses — or is that statii?:
 New. This means brand new, never used, still in the packaging and in
perfect shape.
 Used. This is anything that’s not “new.”
 Refurbished. These are nonmedia used items that are “good as new”
with a manufacturer’s warrantee.
 Collectible. This applies only to media items — books, music, videos,
and DVDs. In order for an item to be collectible it needs to be empiri-
cally unique (as opposed to just special to you). Signed items, out-of-
print items, and rare items are all collectible.

Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

Here’s an overview of the four different physical condition classifications:
 Like New. New enough that you’d feel comfortable giving it as a gift. It
doesn’t have to be in its original packaging, but it has to be otherwise
perfect.
 Very Good. This means you’ve taken very good care of it, but it wouldn’t
be mistaken for new. There might be some small signs of cosmetic wear. 
 Good. Definitely showing signs of wear, but still functions perfectly. 
 Acceptable. This can show significant signs of cosmetic wear, but it still
has to work. That means if it’s a mixer, it mixes — on all settings. If it’s a
book, it’s got all its pages and they’re all readable.
So an item might be used-like new, or collectible-acceptable. These classifica-
tions give more detail, so the buyer has a better idea of what they’re getting.
Amazon’s guidelines are actually more specific than the overview I just gave.
If you need more information, you can access the Help department by clicking
Selling at Amazon.com, then Listing Your Item, and then Conditions Guidelines.
How to set your price
Amazon makes a recommendation for how you should price your item within
the listing process, but you shouldn’t rely solely on that. Before you list any
item, make sure that you know for sure what you’ve got and what it’s worth.
You can do that by searching around on the Web a bit, or just by looking at
the item’s detail page on Amazon.com. Either way, it’s worth the extra time.
(Read my Fight Club tale in Chapter 14 if you need convincing.)
Also, Amazon lists products in lowest-to-highest price order, and, of course,
the item at the top often sells first. So you might pull a Price is Right maneu-
ver and list your item at one cent less than the current lowest price (assum-
ing it’s in a comparable condition). That way it’ll show up first on the list.
Amazon has several rules regarding pricing. If you break them within the list-
ing process, they let you know by keeping you from finalizing your listing.
They send you back to the pricing page with some text that explains your
mistake. (See Figure 15-6.) It makes it easier to know what those rules are
ahead of time. Here they are in a nutshell:
 New. For books, music, videos, DVDs, software, and computer games,
you have to set your price at or below the Amazon.com price. For all
other items, you can set any price, but I think it’s unlikely that anyone
will buy yours if it’s more expensive than the Amazon price. 
 Refurbished. You have to set the price at or below the latest Amazon.com
price. If you want to sell it, though, you price it lower than Amazon’s price. 
249
Chapter 15: The Buying/Selling Circle: Amazon.com Marketplace

 Used. Again, at or below Amazon.com’s price for the same item new. 
 Collectible. You can set the price at whatever you want. This is one that
requires some knowledge and/or research to get a sense of market
value. Also, make sure you let buyers know why your item is collectible
by filling out the comment section in the listing process.
Even if Amazon’s price changes, your price stays wherever you set it. You
have to change it manually and you can do that from your Seller Account. To
access your Seller Account, click Your Account in the Shopping Tools menu
at the top of the page to go to the Your Account page and then click the Seller
Account link in the Auctions, zShops, and Marketplace box on the right side
of the page. Use the inventory links to find the item you want to change. (For
more detailed instructions look at the Listing Your Item section of this chapter.)
Communicating with Your Buyer
When your item sells, you’ll get an e-mail from Amazon notifying you of that
fact. You don’t have to worry about getting paid. With Marketplace, that hap-
pens automatically. All you have to do now is ship the item.
You will need to communicate with your buyer once they purchase your
item. But don’t become overzealous and bombard your buyer with e-mail.
Keep it professional, courteous, and brief. Remember what happened to
Bridget Fonda in Single White Female? This isn’t a friendship you’re starting.
It’s a business transaction.

250
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

As far as I’m concerned, there are only three times that you should e-mail
your buyer:
 When they make the purchase. This is optional. Amazon sends you an
e-mail with the buyer’s shipping address and e-mail address. Some
people send an e-mail just to make contact and acknowledge the pur-
chase. I’ve gotten these e-mails and I appreciate them.
 When you ship the item. This is not optional. You should send an e-mail
to your buyer on the day you ship the item. They know when to expect
its arrival — and if it doesn’t show up, they can act quickly.
 When something goes wrong. Mishaps occur, and when they do it’s
best to keep your buyer in the loop.
Pack It Up. Ship It Off.
Here’s what you should do to ensure a good shipping experience for you and
your buyer:
 Carefully read your Sold — Ship now! e-mail. When your item sells,
Amazon sends you an e-mail that looks like Figure 15-7. You can find all
the information you need to complete the transaction — your buyer’s
shipping address, their e-mail address, a link to the shipping guidelines,
your packing slip, and more.
 Print out your packing slip and include it in your package. This is part
of the body of your Sold — Ship now! e-mail (as shown in Figure 15-7).
You can print the whole e-mail and cut out the packing-slip part, or cut
and paste the packing-slip part into a new document and print that. If all
else fails, you can handwrite the information and include that in your
package.
 Pack your item carefully. Refer to Amazon’s shipping guidelines. You
can get to them by clicking the link in your e-mail, or by going to the
Help Department. You’ll find the guidelines under Shipping and
Packaging in the Fulfillment, Getting Paid and Feedback section of the
Selling at Amazon.com area.
 Label your package clearly. Make sure you put Your Amazon.com
Marketplace Order prominently on the outside of the package.
 Ship your package. You know that Amazon gives you a shipping credit
for Marketplace orders. (If you’re not sure how much of a credit, check
out Chapter 14.) There is no negotiating that credit. If the credit covers
your shipping costs, great. If it doesn’t — sometimes giant, heavy items
or strangely shaped items or items going to crazy places cost more than
251
Chapter 15: The Buying/Selling Circle: Amazon.com Marketplace

the credit — you are still required to ship the item. On the other hand,
sometimes the credit more than covers it. When this happens, one great
way to improve your feedback rating is to upgrade your buyer’s ship-
ping to First-Class Priority Mail. It doesn’t cost much more, but it fills
buyers with glee.
 E-mail your buyer. Let them know that you’ve shipped, when to expect
the item, and what method you used for shipping.

Auctions and zShops
In This Chapter
 Understanding the difference between Auctions and zShops
 Creating a good Auctions listing
 Listing single and multiple items with zShops
 Making the most of your zShops storefront
 Interacting with your buyer
A
uctions and zShops are the Cinderellas of Amazon.com. They’re such
great programs, I feel everyone should be talking about them. Don’t the
masses know that walking arm in arm with Amazon.com means walking arm
in arm with 37 million customers? Alas, they don’t. But now you do.
You can actually make a lot of money selling with Auctions and zShops. You
just need the three Ss: the stuff, the show, and the service. (Those are my
three Ss, by the way.) In this chapter I talk about all three. I give you a quick
overview of what you can and can’t, and what you should and shouldn’t sell
at Amazon.com. I show you how to create an Auctions listing that gives your
buyers all the information they could ever want. I help you list single and multi-
ple items with zShops and tell you how to make the most of your storefront. I
explain the supplementary selling services Amazon offers and give you point-
ers on how to best deal with your buyers — the good, the bad and the ugly.
That said, this is really a “basics of . . . ” kind of chapter — it would take a
separate book to hold everything there is to know about using Auctions
and zShops. So I encourage you to spend some time reading the Auctions and
zShops sections of Amazon’s Help department — you know, that department

that pops up when you click Help in the Shopping Tools menu of any page on
the site. The Auctions and zShops sections hang out under the Selling at
Amazon.com heading and they are absolutely packed with the information
you need to be a selling pro.
The Differences between
Auctions and zShops
There are two main things that Auctions and zShops have in common and
two main things that differentiate them.
Here’s what they share:
 They’re both selling opportunities at Amazon.com. That’s right. You
can use either program to sell stuff and make some money.
 Both programs allow you to sell items that are not already in Amazon’s
catalog. That’s not to say you have carte blanche, just that you are not
restricted to items they already sell as you are with Marketplace. (For
more on Marketplace, see Chapter 15.) When you sell with either Auctions
or zShops, your items will get detail pages of their own. 
And here’s what makes them different:
 The price. Auctions items go to the highest bidder, while zShops is a
fixed-price selling venue.
 The quantity. You can use Auctions to sell just one item or to sell hun-
dreds of items. zShops, however, is only for volume sellers.
 The Pro Merchant Subscription. zShops requires you to have a Pro
Merchant subscription.
There are other differences — different fees and commissions, to name two —
but these three are the biggies that can help you figure out where you should
be selling.
If you’ve read Chapter 15 on Amazon’s Marketplace feature and spent a little
time considering the three selling venues, you may have spotted the hole in
the system: As of this moment, there is no good venue for selling single items
that are not in Amazon’s catalog at a fixed price. You can sell a single, fixed-
price item through zShops, but it has to be a spendy number to warrant
paying the $39.99 monthly subscription fee. (You can also set a reserve price
in your auction to ensure you get the amount you want, but that’s not really
the same. You still have to auction it off.)
254
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

What You Can, Can’t, Should,
and Shouldn’t Sell
First things first: Amazon.com isn’t a virtual red-light district. So if you were
thinking of setting up an online shop to sell merchandise that would require
the use of “Adult” as a descriptor, think again. (For example, toys are fine.
Adult toys are not.) On the site, Amazon says it subscribes to a “community
standard” and that all sellers must subscribe to this standard as well (and
next up is an outline of the Don’ts in this standard).
You probably won’t feel compelled to buck the system here. If you do, you
should know that Amazon reserves the right to determine what is appropri-
ate for their site. You should also know that if they determine your item (or
items) to be inappropriate, they remove the offending stuff from the site with-
out refunding any of their listing fees.
So what you can sell is anything that’s both legal and appropriate. Here’s a
list that gives a better idea of what that means:
 No pornography. This includes hard-core stuff, “toys,” and bizarre
things like “soiled undergarments” (eewww). You can sell condoms,
“unrated erotic videos,” and artsy erotica, but you have to put censor
strips over all nudity and any graphic text that might show up in the
photo. The differentiation they make here is that if you’d find it in an
independent bookstore, it’s probably okay. If you’d find it in an adult
entertainment store, it probably isn’t. As for the overlap, use your
common sense and remember that people under 18 also shop at
Amazon.com.
 No offensive material. The things that Amazon lists as examples
of offensive material are “crime-scene photos or human organs and
body parts.” So if you’re selling stolen organs on the black market,
Amazon.com isn’t for you. Perhaps a more relevant reading of this rule
would include things that are blatantly racist, things that encourage acts
of violence, and so on. They do encourage sellers to be mindful of other
cultures and remember that the audience is “our global community.”
 No illegal items. This isn’t just the obvious stuff — narcotics, Cuban
cigars, and so on. It also includes anything that would encourage or abet
an illegal act — like those cable descramblers or lock-picking devices
you might have in the back of the garage (but probably don’t, right?).
They make a point of noting that you can sell packaged food as long as it
“meets all applicable federal, state, and local standards for sale to con-
sumers.” That’s right — Spam is not an illegal item, as long as it’s the
kind you can actually put in a sandwich.
255
Chapter 16: Where on Earth Did You Find That? Auctions and zShops

 Stolen goods. If this is the rule that keeps you from selling at
Amazon.com, I’m going to hazard a guess that not being able to list your
Auction item is the least of your worries.
 No items that overtly infringe upon an individual’s privacy. No videos
you took of your celebrity (or noncelebrity) neighbor. No photos that
the subject might not want on the Internet. Nothing that would reveal
someone else’s personal information. Use yourself as the benchmark
here. If you’re someone with few or no inhibitions, then use a more pri-
vate friend as the benchmark. Also, telemarketers be warned! This prohi-
bition includes marketing lists.
 No recopied or bootlegged media. You are not allowed to copy books,
music, videos, images, and so on, and sell them at Amazon.com. You
can’t even make an awesome mix tape and sell it at Amazon.com. It’s not
because Amazon is persnickety. This is now an industry standard, and it
includes things like tapes of concerts you’ve been to, pay-per-view
events you recorded on TV, movies you’ve taped, and so on.
 No promotional media. These prerelease items are usually given to
industry people and marked Promotional Use Only (or words to that
effect). This includes advanced copies of books.
 No copied or bootlegged video games. If you’re going to sell a video
game at Amazon, it has to be the full retail version — just like one you’d
buy at the mall.
 No copied software. Same deal here. It has to be the retail version that
you’d buy at the mall.
 No satellite technology. Amazon says, “Any item that enables unautho-
rized transmission/reception of a satellite broadcast/signal is prohibited.”
So, for example, you can’t sell the smart card out of your cell phone.
 No replicas of trademarked items. In other words, no fakes allowed. So
if you were thinking about selling that so-close-even-Kate-herself-wouldn’t-
know Kate Spade knockoff, don’t. You’d be playing with fire.
 No unauthorized celebrity stuff. If you’re going to create your own set
of Madonna coasters, you need to get her permission. If you already own
a set of authorized Madonna coasters, you can resell those.
 No domain names. I don’t know that anyone would come to Amazon.
com to buy a domain name, but it doesn’t matter, because sale of them
is prohibited!
 No firearms, ammunition, or weapons. The only kind of gun you can
sell at Amazon.com is one that shoots rubber pellets or foam darts. This
rule also applies to other weapons like martial-arts throwing stars and
stun guns. Also, no fireworks. The idea here is that you can’t sell any-
thing that is designed to be used as an implement to harm someone.
 No phony “come to my Web site” listings. If you’re going to sell at
Amazon, you actually have to sell at Amazon. Don’t use Auctions as a
256
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

vehicle to get people to your own online store by creating a listing that
gives people instructions on how to get there. That won’t float with the
powers that be.
 No products that have been recalled by the Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC). No recalls. Not even if you’re Californian. For a list
of recalled items, go the CPSC Web site at www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/
prerel/prerel.html.
 No living creatures and unauthorized/illegal wildlife products. To clar-
ify, you definitely can’t sell 99 percent of the live animals that come to
mind. No dogs. No cats. No ferrets. The only ones you can sell are shell-
fish and crustaceans (as food), assuming you obey all applicable laws.
Don’t just think you can send a bucket of clams through the mail. You
can’t. And by “unauthorized wildlife products” they mean things like the
skin of an endangered animal or an elephant tusk. You can sell autho-
rized products like fur coats (assuming, of course, that they’re not made
of fur from an endangered species). Also, you can sell legal plants. 
 No real estate. No auctioning off the Brooklyn Bridge or your summer
home in Aspen (even if you really are the owner).
 No wine and other alcoholic beverages. This is not based on the
“appropriate” rule. You can’t sell alcoholic beverages at Amazon.com
primarily because of the various governmental restrictions on the sale of
those items. I wouldn’t want you to think Amazon prudish.
So what can you sell? Anything else. What should you sell? That’s another
matter all together. I don’t know, empirically, what you should sell on
Auctions and zShops. Nobody does — so much of it has to do with taste. As
an example, the year zShops launched, one of the hot items being sold was
the Turducken — a chicken stuffed in a duck stuffed in a turkey. (Not live, of
course, because that would be against the rules.) Who could’ve predicted it?
Not me. Who’d eat it? Anyone craving a poultry medley, I guess.
I’m making a disclaimer — I’m no Auctions/zShops clairvoyant. But I have
spent a lot of time with the site and I do feel I can give you some pointers.
Here are a few Dos and Don’ts for selling at Auctions and zShops:
 Don’t sell inexpensive single items that are in the catalog. First of all,
any item you list in Marketplace will also show up in zShops. So there’s
no reason to pay the subscription fee if you don’t have to. Also, your
items will get more exposure through Marketplace because they’re
shown on the detail page of the new item that Amazon is selling. If
you’re creating a zShop, you could create one that sold items in the 
catalog — but only if it made sense (see the next bullet).
 Do sell items that go together. When you’re creating a zShop, sell items
that make sense together. This is how you make additional sales. For
example, if someone is buying a fishing rod, they might also be looking
for a reel. 
257
Chapter 16: Where on Earth Did You Find That? Auctions and zShops

 Don’t sell what everyone else is selling. Be sure to visit the site and do
some research before you list your item. Find out if your item is already
being sold. Is the market flooded? Are like items selling? Do a little dig-
ging and find out whether you’re offering unique merchandise. If you are,
you have a better chance of selling it.
 Do sell items that are “hot.” Popular, that is (not stolen). The key here
is to know what’s hot. One good way to do research on this is to check
out Amazon’s Top Sellers and then do a little extrapolating. In other
words, if an artist’s new CD is a top seller, then maybe items related to
that artist would be hot sellers. Admittedly, there’s a fine line between
selling an item that’s hot and selling something that everyone else is
already selling. So you really have to do your research.
 Don’t sell things that are inexpensive and easily accessible when new.
This may seem obvious, but every now and then I come across some-
thing on the site and think, “Who on earth would buy that and why?” If
you’re selling something that I can buy at the drugstore down the street
for two dollars more, I’ll buy it at the drugstore and eat the two bucks.
 Do sell one-of-kind or rare items. To me, this is what Auctions and
zShops are all about. That’s not to say that you have to sell handmade
things or collectibles there. You can sell just about anything, but origi-
nally these two stores were billed as the places to find special, unusual
items. So listen up, all you crafty people out there! Auctions and zShops
are a great place to sell your wares.
Creating a Good Auctions Listing
I’m going to get into the nitty-gritty of Auctions here. But don’t dismay.
zShops is next in line, later in the chapter.
Creating a good Auctions listing is a craft (and you can acquire the tools you
need to master it right here). All the thinking and planning and researching in
the world won’t help you sell if you don’t have a good listing. So what makes
a listing good? The right kind of information. Here are the essentials for any
good listing:
 A precise title. You have a total of 80 characters at your disposal. Use
them wisely. Describe the item you’re selling as accurately as you can in
as few words as is possible. For example, if you’re selling a set of sta-
tionery, you’re better off with a title that says, “Set of five hand-printed
“Year of the Sheep” cards with envelopes” (65 characters) than just “Set
of hand-printed cards” (27 characters). Be brief, but not at the expense
of being precise.
 A good photo. As far as I’m concerned, you have to have a photo (unless
you’re selling something for which a photo wouldn’t be relevant — like a
date with Brad Pitt). And not just any old photo. You need a good photo.
More on this later in the chapter.
258
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

 An accurate description. You have a lot of room here — 4,000 charac-
ters, including spaces. Use it to give your buyer every piece of informa-
tion you can envision them wanting. Amazon suggests that you put
yourself in the buyer’s shoes. That’s good advice. Better yet, look at a
few similar auctions and take note of the information (or lack of informa-
tion) given. Did you walk away from the listing with unanswered ques-
tions? Write them down and be sure to answer them in your description.
Think about what makes your item unique and include that information.
And most important, remember that honesty is the best policy, so be as
truthful and as accurate as you can be.
 Precalculated shipping costs. You can put something in your descrip-
tion that states that the buyer pays for shipping costs, but it’s better to
actually calculate them and include them as a line item in the auction
form itself. That way buyers know what to expect and aren’t at risk for
getting shipping fee sticker shock. What some people do is figure out the
most expensive possible shipping price within the areas that they’re
willing to ship to and list that. Other people find a range and list that
(and I prefer this as a buyer). Or, for example, if they’re shipping from
the Midwest and they are only willing to ship to the continental U.S.,
they might list the amount they’ll charge to ship to the West Coast and
the amount they’ll charge to ship to the East Coast.
 The right categorization. This is not important for the detail page itself,
but for getting people there. Putting your item in the right categories
means that it shows up in the appropriate search results. If you’re uncer-
tain about where your item belongs, do some browsing for similar items
(within Auctions) and see where they show up. 
I’m a firm believer that the success of any auction lies in the prep work. The
actual listing process is much simpler. 
As with any other Amazon transaction, you must have an Amazon account to
list an item on Auctions. If you don’t, you’re walked through the sign-up as a
part of the listing process. You can also set an account up ahead of time (see
Chapter 3 for instructions). All sellers must also be signed up for Amazon
Payments. You won’t be able to sell if you aren’t. Again, you do it either as a
part of the listing process or separately. For instructions on how to sign up
for Amazon Payments, see Chapter 14.
These instructions assume that you already have an account and that you’re
set up to pay using Amazon Payments:
1. Click Your Account in the Shopping Tools menu.
The Shopping Tools menu sits at the top of just about every page on
the site.
2. Click the Your Seller Account link.
This is in the Auctions, zShops, and Marketplace box on the right side of
the page.
259
Chapter 16: Where on Earth Did You Find That? Auctions and zShops

3. Click the List Single Items link.
You’ll find this under the List Your Items For Sale heading in the Your
Inventory section.
4. Click Amazon Auctions.
You come to a page that looks like Figure 16-1. This is where you will
enter your item information. (If you’re not already set up with Amazon
Payments, you’ll be taken to a Sign In screen and then a screen where
you’ll enter your credit-card info and check that you’ve read and agree
to the terms of the participation agreement.)
5. Enter your auction title and description in the fields provided.
Remember to be descriptive and straightforward. Also, check for
spelling errors.
6. Click the Upload My Image box and then either click Browse or enter
the URL for your image in the field provided.
The first thing you need to know is that all images must either be GIFs or
JPEGs. (For more file information, click the Image Tips and Tricks link.) If
you are technically savvy enough to have your image hosted on the Web
somewhere, then you probably don’t need an explanation of how to
enter the URL in the field. Everyone else should choose the first image
option. When you click Browse, you get a chance to comb through the
folders on your computer’s hard drive in search of your image. To make
this process easier, make sure beforehand that you’ve stored the image
somewhere obvious (say, in a folder on your desktop). When you locate
the image, simply double-click it and you’re taken back to the Auctions
listing page, where the name of the image appears automatically in the
Figure 16-1:
The Item
Information
section of
the Auctions
listing page.
260
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

field. What happens here is that because you and your hard drive are
connected to the Internet, Amazon’s technology can make a copy of
your image and store it on their server.
7. If applicable, enter the UPC or ISBN number of the item you’re selling
in the Product Identification field.
These two numbers are standard identification numbers (ISBNs are for
books, UPCs are for most other things). If there is one, you may as well
add it. It gives the user more information — they can use the numbers to
look up the product and see it new either on Amazon or somewhere else.
8. Enter a minimum bid in the field provided.
Amazon puts $1.00 in that field as a default. You can change that number
as you like. Just keep in mind that your minimum bid should allow some
“bidding up.” In other words, if you’re hoping to sell an item for $30.00,
don’t set the minimum bid at $30.00. Set it a little bit lower to attract bar-
gain hunters and to allow a little competitive bidding to occur. But don’t
set it so low that you’re giving something away if you have a lack of bid-
ders. If you’re not going to have a reserve price — the minimum amount
of money you’re willing to take for the item — set your minimum bid
somewhere close to the lowest amount you’re willing to accept for the
item.
9. In the Reserve Price section of the page, either click the No radio
button or click Yes and then enter your reserve price in the field 
provided.
You don’t have to enter a reserve price. If you choose to, however, I rec-
ommend that you don’t make it wildly different from your minimum bid.
When you set a reserve price, highest bids won’t count as winning bids
until they match or exceed it — and remember, bidders don’t know what
the reserve is. So it’s possible for a bidder to have a maximum bid that is
lower than your reserve price but higher than your minimum bid. That
means the bidder is bidding on your auction without any chance of 
winning — which is frustrating and not a good way to attract customers.
Please note that once you set a reserve price and list your auction, you
can’t change the reserve price later.
10. In the Take It Price section, either click the No radio button or click
Yes and then enter your Take-It Price in the field provided.
This is the amount of money that you’d be willing to accept for the item —
much like eBay’s Buy it Now option. It’s a cool feature as it allows shop-
pers to buy your items with 1-Click. If someone does buy your item using
the Take-It price, the auction automatically ends. Take-It Prices are listed
on the auction detail page.
11. Enter your shipping and handling fees in the field provided.
This is optional, but I highly recommend it. If you need help calculating
fees, visit the Web site of the carrier you plan to use. And remember,
shipping sticker shock makes for unhappy buyers (and bad ratings). So
261
Chapter 16: Where on Earth Did You Find That? Auctions and zShops

don’t use the shipping and handling as a way to make more money. Keep
it realistic and your buyers will be happy.
12. Use the drop-down menus to enter your item in the appropriate 
category.
There are just shy of 20 drop-downs here (as shown in Figure 16-2) — and
you can pick only one! Be mindful and put your stuff in the right category
so it’ll show up in the right search results and in the right browse nodes. If
you’re uncertain about where your item belongs, do some browsing for
similar items (within Auctions) and see where they show up.
13. Enter your listing information.
Figure 16-3 shows the listing information section of the form. Use the
drop-down menu to choose the duration of your auction (default is at 
7 days). Click the appropriate circles to choose the type — standard,
Dutch, or private (see the “Standard, Dutch, or Private?” sidebar for
more info on these) — and whether or not to relist (you get one freebie
here). You can also check the box if you want to carry over merchandis-
ing features and fees.
14. Enter your selling preferences.
Figure 16-4 shows the Selling Preferences area of the form. This is where
you enter the critical payment and shipping information. Click the boxes
and circles as appropriate. Remember that you are required to accept
Amazon Payments; any other method of payment is optional. Also,
although the Returns section of the form is optional, accepting returns is
not — that’s something you have to be prepared to do if you want to do
business. In effect, what you’re really entering here is your policy on
refunds.

15. Choose optional features.
These are additional merchandising tools that you can use to promote
your auction. Most of them cost money. (More on these later in the
chapter.)

You’re taken to a page where you can review your information. If you
need to make changes, click the Edit button to return to the listing form.

Chapter 16: Where on Earth Did You Find That? Auctions and zShops
Standard, Dutch, or Private?
A standard auction is exactly that — any plain,
old auction where you offer up an item and
people bid on it. The highest bidder wins and
everyone else goes home empty handed.
In a Dutch auction, the seller has more than one
of the same item to sell and auctions them all off
at the same time. Bidders commit to both the
number of the items they want to buy and how
much they want to bid per item. The final per-
item price in a Dutch auction is determined by
the lowest winning bids. Then the items are dis-
tributed based on bid amount and quantity
requested with highest winning bidder getting
dibs. Amazon’s own example spells it out more
clearly. “Joe and Sue are the individual high
bidders in a Dutch auction for lamps. Joe placed
a bid for 30 lamps at $20 each. In a subsequent
bid, Sue offered to buy 10 lamps at $65 each.
Because Sue’s high bid ($65) is greater than
Joe’s high bid ($20), Sue is entitled to all 10
lamps she requested at the $20 price (the lowest
winning bid). Joe is entitled to the remaining 20
lamps at $20 each, even though his original bid
was for a quantity of 30.”
Private auctions are much simpler, though
they’re pretty rare and usually for high-ticket
items. During a private auction, bids are public
on the site as usual, but bidders are not identi-
fied. When the auction ends, both the seller and
the highest bidder are notified via e-mail.

Editing or Canceling an Auction
When you’ve successfully posted an auction, you can edit it as necessary.
Here’s how to do that:
1. Click Your Account in the Shopping Tools menu.
Look for this at the top of just about every page on the site.
2. Click the Your Seller Account link.
This is in the Auctions, zShops, and Marketplace box on the right side of
the page.
3. Click the Open link in the Auctions section.
You’ll find the link in the View Items section of Your Inventory. This link
will take you to a page that lists all your open items.
4. Click the Modify Listing link for the item you want to edit.
This takes you to the auctions-listing form for that item. From here, the
editing process is exactly like the original listing process. Make the nec-
essary changes, but remember that you can’t change a reserve price
once it’s set.
5. Click the Preview Your Auction button.
Review your new information and click the Edit button to return to the
listing form.
6. Click the Submit Your Auction button.
You should see your edits on-screen immediately. Click the link to your
auction to confirm that it works.
Figure 16-4:

and

264
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

It is really important that you not change the description of your item in such
a way that existing bidders will be disappointed. If you must do this, just
know that they can cancel their bids and that it’s a pretty good way to get
some bad feedback.
Also, you may have noticed that an End This Auction Now button appears on
the listing form after you complete Step 4 in this process (as shown in Figure
16-5). You can end an auction before it closes, but if there are bidders, it’s
strongly discouraged. (This recently happened to me and I was so annoyed! I
wanted that little key chain and was anxiously awaiting the end of the auction
to see if I’d won.) If you absolutely have to do that, here’s how to do it:
1. Click Your Account in the Shopping Tools menu.
It’s at the top of just about every page on the site.
2. Click the Your Seller Account link.
This is in the Auctions, zShops, and Marketplace box on the right side of
the page.
3. Click the Open link in the Auctions section.
The link, which lives in the View Items section of Your Inventory, takes
you to a page that lists all your open items.
4. Click the Modify Listing link for the item you want to edit.
You should be at the listing form for the auction you want to cancel. At
the top of the page (which looks like Figure 16-5), you’ll see the End This
Auction Now button.
Figure 16-5:
The End

(cancella-
tion) button
is at the top
of every live

265
Chapter 16: Where on Earth Did You Find That? Auctions and zShops

5. Click the End This Auction Now button.
You come to a page that looks like Figure 16-6.
6. Enter your reason for ending the auction in the field provided and
click End This Auction Now.
That’s it. Your auction is cancelled and you’ll receive an e-mail confirm-
ing cancellation shortly thereafter. Any existing bidders will also receive
an e-mail that the auction has been cancelled.
Selling with zShops
When you use zShops to sell your merchandise, you have to meet three
requirements:
 You must have an Amazon account. If you need instructions on how to
set one up, read Chapter 3.
 You must be signed up to accept Amazon Payments. All Amazon sellers
have to accept Amazon Payments. With zShops, you can also accept
other forms of payment. To find out how to sign up, read Chapter 14.
 You must have a Pro Merchant account. All Amazon sellers can make
use of a Pro Merchant account, but only zShops requires it. To find out
how to sign up, read Chapter 14.
Once you’ve signed up for all three, you’re ready to sell! And don’t forget, you
can also use your Pro Merchant subscription to sell in volume, both on
Auctions and with Marketplace.
Figure 16-6:

Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

Listing a single item
I know I said that zShops is for volume sellers — and nine times out of ten, it
is. But sometimes people list single items with zShops. These are usually
high-ticket items that warrant spending the $39.99 monthly Pro Merchant
subscription fee. (Recently I found a $2,500 dirt bike on zShops — that’s a
good example of a single item worth listing.) If you have a high-ticket item
you’d like to sell, here’s how to do it (note that these instructions assume
that you’ve already met the three requirements just described — that you
have an Amazon account, that you’re signed up for Payments, and that you
have a Pro Merchant account ):
1. Click Your Account in the Shopping Tools menu.
It’s at the top of just about every page on the site.
2. Click the Your Seller Account link.
This is in the Auctions, zShops, and Marketplace box on the right side of
the page.
3. Click the List Single Items link.
You’ll find this under the List Your Items For Sale heading in the Your
Inventory section.
4. Click Amazon zShops.
Note that if you’re not already set up with Amazon Payments, you’ll
be taken to a sign-in screen and then a screen where you’ll enter your
credit-card info. If you are signed up, you come to a page that looks like
Figure 16-7. Scroll down a bit and you’ll see that this is the zShops 
single-listing form (almost identical to the Auctions single-listing form).
But before you scroll, notice that you have the option to list with
Marketplace — but only (of course) if the item you’re selling is in
Amazon’s catalog. All Marketplace items also show up in zShops, but not
vice versa. Here I’m assuming that you’re listing an item that isn’t in the
catalog. For those few times when it might be, you’d list it in zShops
anyway. (I tell you about those times in the “Scary math — better to sell
with zShops or Marketplace?” sidebar later in the chapter.)
5. Enter your title and description in the fields provided.
Remember to be descriptive and straightforward. Also, check for
spelling errors.
6. Click the Upload My Image . . . box and then either click Browse or
enter the URL for your image in the field provided.
As with Auctions, all images must either be GIFs or JPEGs. (For more file
information click the Image Tips and Tricks link.) If you have your image
hosted on the Web somewhere, enter the URL in the field provided. For
everyone else, click Browse and search through the folders on your
computer’s hard drive to find your image. To make things easier for
267
Chapter 16: Where on Earth Did You Find That? Auctions and zShops

yourself, store the image somewhere obvious, like in a folder on your
desktop. When you locate the image, simply double-click it and you’re
taken back to the zShops listing page, where the name of the image
appears automatically in the field. (Because you and your hard drive are
connected to the Internet, Amazon’s technology can make a copy of
your image and store it on their server.)
7. Enter the price in the field provided.
Just to remind you, this is a fixed price. Also, don’t forget that Amazon
takes a percentage of the closing fee; take that into account when you’re
banking on your profits.
8. Enter your quantity-on-hand in the field provided.
Even though this is a single listing, you can still have more than one on
hand. You have to have at least one on hand.
9. Enter your shipping and handling fees in the field provided.
Again, optional but highly recommended. If you need help calculating
fees, visit the Web site of the carrier you plan to use.
10. Use the drop-down menus to enter your item in the appropriate 
category.
Remember that you can pick only one; make sure you put your stuff in
the right category.
11. Check the Yes box if you want to carry over your merchandising fea-
tures and fees.
I actually think this belongs below the optional features (it would defi-
nitely make more sense there). What this means is that if you’re going to
Figure 16-7:
The zShops
single-
listing form
offers the
option of
listing with
Marketplace
as well.
268
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

sign up for some of Amazon’s optional features for the item you’re list-
ing, you can carry them over (or automatically renew them) for as long
as the item is listed. So, for example, if you decide to pay $2.00 for a
boldfaced title, and you check the box, you’ll be paying $2.00 every two
weeks to keep the title boldfaced.
12. Enter your selling preferences.
This is where you enter critical payment and shipping information. Click
the boxes and circles as appropriate. 
It bears repeating: You are required to accept Amazon Payments; any
other method of payment is optional. Also, what you’re really entering
here is your policy on refunds; although the Returns section if the form
is optional, actually accepting returns is not.
13. Choose optional features.
Optional features are the same for Auctions and zShops. They are addi-
tional merchandising tools you can use to promote your listings. You
can find out more about these by reading the “Snazzing It Up for Better
Selling” section, later in this chapter.
14. Click the Preview Your Listing button.
You’re taken to a page where you can review your information. If you
need to make changes, click the Edit button to return to the listing form.
269
Chapter 16: Where on Earth Did You Find That? Auctions and zShops
Scary math — better to sell with 
zShops or Marketplace?
If you’re selling a particularly spendy (that’s the
optimistic word for pricey) item, even if it is in
Amazon’s catalog, it might be better to list it only
in zShops and pay the $39.99 monthly fee. So
how spendy is spendy?
Remember, when you list with Marketplace you
pay a $.99 listing fee and a percentage of the
total price of the item. That’s 6 percent of sales
price on computers, 8 percent on camera,
photo, and electronics, and 15 percent on all
other products. When you list with zShops, you
pay your Pro Merchant subscription monthly
fee of $39.99 plus a 5 percent closing fee on
items that sell for $0.01 to $25.00, a $1.25 addi-
tional flat fee plus 2.5 percent closing fee on
items that sell for$25.01 to $1,000.00, and a
$25.63 additional flat fee plus 1.25 percent clos-
ing fee on items that sell for more than $1,000.
Consider this: If you’re selling a plasma TV for
$950, you give Amazon roughly $77 if you sell
through Marketplace. If you sell it through
zShops and it only takes one month to get that
sale, you only give Amazon about $65. The more
expensive the item, the greater the gap
between those two numbers. So when you’re
selling an expensive item, do the math. Then
decide whether the numbers warrant selling on
zShops instead of Marketplace, keeping in mind
that Marketplace gives you more exposure.

15. Click the Submit Your Listing button.
You’re done! You can edit any zShops listing from your Seller Account page in
the same way that you’d edit an Auctions or Marketplace listing.
Listing multiple items
You can list items in zShops one by one, but if you have several items to list,
you can save time by using the Inventory Loader. The Inventory Loader is the
Marketplace and zShops multiple-listing tool (in Auctions it’s the Auctions
Bulk Uploader). Using the Inventory Loader is simple. Preparing to use it is
not as simple.
In order to use the Inventory Loader, you need to put your items into a single
Excel spreadsheet according to Amazon’s guidelines (booksellers can also
use a Universal Information Exchange Environment document). You can find
detailed instructions on how to prepare your spreadsheet in the Selling at
Amazon.com section of the Help department. Click zShops, then zShops
Volume Listing Tools, and then Building Your Spreadsheet.
You have the option of having Amazon send you a prepared Excel spreadsheet.
If you’re at all uncomfortable with Excel, I recommend you take advantage of
this offer. Just click the Click Here link in the second paragraph of the Build
Your Spreadsheet page and your e-mail client program generates an e-mail. You
don’t need to write anything in the subject line or body of the e-mail. Just click
the Send button. You’ll receive the spreadsheet template via e-mail almost
immediately. It comes ready for either Marketplace or zShops. If you’re using it
for zShops, just ignore or delete the Marketplace-specific columns.
Once you’ve completed your spreadsheet, you’re ready to upload your items.
Here’s how:
1. Click Your Account in the Shopping Tools menu.
It’s at the top of just about every page on the site.
2. Click the Your Seller Account link.
This is in the Auctions, zShops, and Marketplace box on the right side of
the page.
3. Click the Upload Multiple Items link.
This link lives under the List Your Items For Sale heading in the Your
Inventory section.
4. Click the Tab Delimited link.
Unless you’re using UIEE software, this is the link for you. You’ll come to
a Sign In screen.
270
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

5. Enter your password in the field provided and click the Sign In Using
Our Secure Server button.
You come to a page that looks like Figure 16-8. 
6. Use the drop-down menus to choose your selling venue and upload
option.
Choose zShops Only for the selling program and Add/Modify/Delete for
your upload option.
7. Click Browse to find the file you want to upload.
Clicking Browse sends you combing through the folders on your com-
puter’s hard drive in search of your file. To make that easier, store the
file somewhere obvious (such as a folder on your desktop). When you
locate it, simply double-click it (or click the Open button). Amazon
makes a copy of your document and stores it on their server. You’ll be
taken back to the upload page where you should see the name of the file
automatically placed in the appropriate field.
8. Click the Upload Now button.
That’s all it takes. You come to a page that looks like Figure 16-9. You can
check the status of your upload to make sure that everything went okay
by clicking the Review Inventory Upload Status button. If it didn’t go
right, Amazon sends you an e-mail with a link to a detailed error log that
explains what went wrong.

Snazzing It Up for Better Selling: Good
Photos and Optional Features
There are several things you can do to your auctions and zShops listings to
give them some oomph. Some of them are free and some cost money. All of
them are available from the auctions or zShops listing forms.
The first, and as far as I’m concerned the most important, is the photo. I’ve
already mentioned the photo and sung its praises, but let me say it again: You
have to have a good photo! Maybe you’ll sell something without a photo. I’m
sure it happens every now and then. But ask yourself this: Would you buy
something online from a stranger if you couldn’t look at it first?
Amazon has a wealth of good photo tips on its site and you can access them
from the listing form itself. Just click the Image Tips and Tricks link from the
Item Information section of the listing form. You’ll find instructions on how to
capture your image, convert it to digital, size it, and upload it to the site.
Also, when you take your photo, make sure it’s a good one. Here are a few
more tips:
 Use a solid background. Don’t distract buyers with background mumbo
jumbo. Try laying your item on a piece of white poster board.
 Make sure you have enough light. A dark photo is not a flattering
photo. If you are taking the photo in a room that’s not well lit, use a flash
and bring in an extra lamp for more light.
 Take several shots. And then pick the best one.
Figure 16-9:
This is the
Multiple
Item Upload
Confirm-
ation page.
272
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

 Put a few photos in your image. This is for those of you who are com-
fortable using photo-manipulation programs. Amazon allows you to
upload one image per detail page, but that doesn’t mean the image has
to contain only one photo. If you want, take a general shot of your item
and then a couple of detail shots. Make the general shot the largest and
use the detail shots smaller and on the side. You can then save it as one
image and upload it to the site. It will be hard to discern details in the
thumbnail, but much more detail will be available in the full-size photo
farther down the page.
The other ways to spice up your listings are to make use of the optional fea-
tures that Amazon offers. The Optional Features section is that last section
on the listing form (see Figure 16-10) and you can activate these features from
the form. Here’s a quick review of what each one is:
 Boldface title. This is exactly like the yellow pages. For $2.00 you can
have your title bolded in the search results and on browse pages.
According to Amazon, there is a 30 percent increase in sales for titles
that choose the boldface title.
 First bidder discount. You have the option of giving the first bidder on
your item a 10 percent discount. It costs you 10 percent of the final
price, but you have a better chance of selling it. The sell-through
increase is 15 percent.
 Crosslinks. This is a way to cross-merchandise your item by surfacing it
on other relevant pages on the site. Happily, crosslinks are free. To use
them, you just have to find three items in the Books, Music, Video, or
DVD stores that you feel are related to your item and put their ASINs or
ISBNs in the fields provided. (ASINs and ISBNs are product identification
numbers. You can find them in the product information on an item’s
detail page.) Crosslinks increase sell-through by 20 percent.
 Bid for featured placement. You can use this to get yourself featured
higher up on search results and browse pages. In effect, it’s an auction
for placement; you are bidding against other sellers. Why? Simple:
Featured placement increases sell-through by 60 percent. To find out
more about this program, click the Learn More link in the Increase Your
Bids for Featured Placement section of the listing form. You can also
access this information from the Auctions and zShops sections of the
Selling at Amazon.com area in the Help department.
There are other ways to promote your listings. You can find out about them
in the Help department by going to the Selling at Amazon.com section, click-
ing on either the Auctions link or the zShops link and then on Promoting Your
Auctions/zShops Listing.
273
Chapter 16: Where on Earth Did You Find That? Auctions and zShops

Your zShops Storefront
When you become a Pro Merchant, you also get your own zShops storefront.
These are accessible from item detail pages, and they are your own for “deco-
rating” as you please. 
You don’t have to spruce up your storefront. If you want, you can just rely on
your items surfacing in search results and on browse pages. But if you want
to direct people to your zShop — say, from your own Web site — you should
make it look good.
Here are the things you can do to make a more professional-looking zShop:
 Customize your brand bar. The brand bar is the strip that surrounds
your page and identifies your store. Amazon automatically puts your
nickname there, followed by zShop, and sets the default color at gray.
You can replace your nickname with another name or your company’s
logo, change the brand-bar color, and add your business’ URL and e-mail
address at the bottom of the page.
 Beef up your Browse box. When you upload several items to zShops
and you enter each item in a category, Amazon will use those categories
to create a default Browse box for your storefront. You can recategorize
them yourself and create a custom browse box that’ll make more sense
in your store. You can do this as an edit or when you upload.
 Create a Custom Search box. The Custom Search box is in the upper-left
corner of your store. You can give it its own label and fill it with links to
prearranged search results — a quick way to highlight certain products
in your store.
Figure 16-10:
Optional
features
help you
advertise
your
auction.
274
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

 Include featured listings. Featured listings show up on the right side of
your page. They’re just like the featured products on Amazon store
pages. You can show as many as five featured listings on your page at
one time. (You can choose to have more; Amazon rotates through them.)
Make sure you choose items that have good photos and solid descrip-
tions; they make good featured listings.
 Include a description of your store and a photo. Tell potential buyers a
little bit about your store and include a photo. (It doesn’t have to be of
you — just something to give the page some life, See Figure 16-11.) 
You can add these features to your zShop by clicking the Edit Your zShops
Storefront link on your Seller Account page. If you need more information or
instruction on how to add these features, visit the Help department. For
detailed information in the zShops section of Selling at Amazon.com, just
click zShops Storefront.
Sold!
So what happens when your Auctions or zShops item sells? Three things. You
make contact. You collect payment. You ship the item. Most of the time, sales
go smoothly. But if you’ve spent any time at all looking at vendor feedback
ratings at Auctions and zShops, you know that even great vendors can have
rough sales. Here are a few pointers for keeping your sales running smoothly:

alizing their

275
Chapter 16: Where on Earth Did You Find That? Auctions and zShops

 Stay in touch but don’t stalk. Contact your buyer only when necessary.
My definition of “necessary” is when they make the purchase, when you
ship, and if anything goes wrong.
 Collect all non-Amazon-Payments payments. If you’re going to accept
other methods of payment and a buyer chooses to pay that way, make
sure you arrange payment as soon as the item sells.
 Pack carefully and wisely. Carefully means that you should use materi-
als suited to the item you’re sending so it arrives safe and sound. Wisely
means you’ve been meticulous about labeling your package — be sure to
write “Your Amazon.com zShops/Auctions Order” clearly on the package. 
 Ship promptly. You will get a negative feedback rating if more than a few
days pass. So ship as soon as is possible.
For more information on what to do after a sale (and some troubleshooting
help) visit the Selling at Amazon.com section in the Help department. You’ll
find what you need in the Auctions and zShops sections under Making an
Auctions/zShops Sale.

Leveling the Playing Field:
Amazon.com Advantage
In This Chapter
 Finding whether Advantage is right for you
 Applying for Advantage
 Marketing your products
 Keeping your inventory stocked
 Getting paid
 Understanding the agreement
A
mazon.com Advantage started out as a little pet project — a way to give
independent publishers a leg up in the world of book sales. Buying on
the Internet was just starting to happen and Amazon.com was the pioneer.
They thought, Why not approach small publishers who have no good way to
distribute their products and let them put stuff on the site? They called it “level-
ing the playing field” because Advantage titles got the same detail page —
thus had the same presence — as any title on the site.
The program was a success and the pet project grew to be a real business.
Today Advantage includes music and video as well as original books. Today
there are thousands of Advantage members, and hundreds of thousands of
their titles on the site.
In this chapter, I cover all the Amazon.com Advantage essentials. I start by
telling you who should sign up for the Advantage program, because it’s not
for everyone. I show you how to apply, and what to do after you’re accepted
into the program. I cover marketing, inventory management, and payment.
And I tell you what you need to know about the rules so you don’t get into
trouble along the way.

Who Can Apply?
As I said, Amazon.com Advantage isn’t for everyone. It isn’t even for every
independent publisher, label, or studio. If you’re thinking of applying for the
Advantage program, make sure you meet these criteria:
 You have an e-mail account and Web access. Amazon.com is a 
Web-based business and so is Advantage. You do all your account 
management — and 99 percent of your communicating — electronically.
That means you have to have e-mail and Internet access.
 You are located in North America. Alas, as of right now, the only other
Advantage program is Advantage for books in the U.K.
 You have worldwide distribution rights. You must have these for all
titles that you enroll in the program.
 Your titles have the appropriate codes. Books have to have ISBNs
printed on them. CDs, videos, and DVDs must have UPCs printed on
them (on the sleeves for videos and DVDs). All titles must have bar
codes printed on them; the bar codes must scan to match the ISBN or
UPC of the title they accompany.
 You actually have the title in hand. Don’t apply for the program using
titles that haven’t been released yet. Amazon asks that you have titles in
hand, ready to ship.
 Your titles are packaged appropriately. CDs, videos, and DVDs should
be shrink-wrapped, and CDs should be in a “protective case” (a jewel
case is standard).
 Your books list for at least $2.99.
 Your titles meet Amazon’s suitability standards. This doesn’t just mean
“no porn.” This also relates to things like quality of production.
The Program Basics
Advantage is essentially a consignment program. You give Amazon your titles
and they sell them and take a cut of the profits. Here are the program basics:
 Getting accepted. Not everyone can be an Advantage member. (See the
“Who Can Apply?” section for details.) You fill out an application online
and if you’re accepted into the program, you receive a confirmation
e-mail with a couple of weeks.
 Getting your titles on the site. You send the Advantage team a market-
ing package that includes information on how to categorize your titles
(so they end up in the right place on the site), actual physical copies of
278
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

the titles so they can scan the cover art, and any additional information
to put on your titles’ detail pages. The Advantage team uploads your
titles to the site.
 Shipping copies of your titles to Amazon. After you’re accepted, you
receive an e-mail order from Amazon. You send the requested number of
units directly to the specified Amazon distribution center. Every time
your inventory is low, you receive an e-mail with a new order (assuming
your sales are okay); you’re responsible for replenishing the stock.
 Getting your titles to consumers. Here’s the great part: Amazon takes
care of all that. They take and process the order. They handle all the ful-
fillment. And they deal with any returns.
 Getting paid. Amazon automatically pays you for titles sold in the previ-
ous month. In other words, they pay monthly net every 30 days.
 Getting the man paid. Amazon takes a 45 percent cut of the listing price.
That may sound like a lot, but it’s actually based on a standard 55 per-
cent purchase discount. They also charge a yearly membership fee of
$29.95 that’s automatically deducted from your account.
Sign on the Dotted Line
It’s surprisingly easy to sign up for Advantage. So easy, in fact, that you might
jump into it without giving it the proper forethought.
Remember, by signing up for Advantage, you’re signing a legally binding busi-
ness agreement with Amazon.com. So make sure you know what you’re get-
ting into.
The best way to find out exactly what you’re getting into is to read the
Advantage membership agreement. You can access it from the main
Advantage info page. To get there, do the following:
1. Click See More Stores.
You find this at the top of almost every page on the site, just to the right
of the tabs.
2. Click the Advantage link in the Make Money box.
This is on the right side of the store directory page. It takes you to what
I call the “teaser” page — a screener to make sure that people don’t con-
fuse Advantage with Marketplace. It’s also where you sign in once you’re
a member.
3. Click either of the Read More About the Advantage Program links.
There’s one in the first paragraph and one in the box on the left. Both
take you to the real Advantage page (which looks like Figure 17-1).

Chapter 17: Leveling the Playing Field: Amazon.com Advantage

All about the membership agreement
To access the membership agreement, just click the link under Additional
Information on the Advantage info page. The membership agreement is
exactly what it looks like: a legal document. You should read through it thor-
oughly and probably have a lawyer look at it, but here are some of the finer
points:
 Amazon holds the cards. They can reject your application, even if you
meet all the criteria. They don’t typically do this, but they can.
 No refunds. They bill you $29.95 for the yearly membership fee each
May. If for any reason your membership is terminated, they keep the
dough.
 Every title gets reviewed. Getting accepted by virtue of a few titles does
not mean that every title you ever submit will be accepted. Amazon
screens every title you send them and, like the application process, they
can reject any title at their sole discretion — even if it meets criteria.
 You pay for shipping. Not to individual customers, but to Amazon’s distri-
bution centers. This includes freight, insurance, and any customs duties.
 Until it gets there, it’s your baby. Until your items arrive at the distribu-
tion center and are deemed acceptable, they are your responsibility.
That means that if they get lost along the way or damaged en route, you
bear the expense. And, if they show up but don’t meet Amazon’s stan-
dards (bar codes in the right place and so on), you pay the return ship-
ping expense.

the

Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

 Speed counts. The availability listing of your title on its detail page
depends on your speed in refilling orders. When Amazon has your title
in stock, they list its availability as “usually ships in 24 hours.” When it’s
not in stock, availability changes to reflect your delivery history. 
 Amazon names their price. You suggest a retail price for each title, but
Amazon makes the ultimate decision and that’s that.
 You only get paid if your titles are bought. Remember, this is a consign-
ment program. Amazon places orders with you, but they’re not actually
buying the titles. You get paid when Amazon’s customers buy the titles.
 Use Mickey and you pay the price. You really do have to have world-
wide distribution rights and if your titles break any copyright laws, you
are responsible for any expenses incurred. In other words, you pay for
the lawyers and the settlement if Disney sues.
 Zip the lip. If Amazon sends you any confidential info as a part of your
participation in the program, you agree that you will keep it confidential.
 They can change the name of the game. Amazon reserves the right to
change the membership agreement at any time without telling you about
it. If you continue with your membership, you are legally agreeing to the
new terms.
 The Dear John letter. Both you and Amazon can end the agreement at
any time and for any reason, but it has to be in writing. Also, if either of
you end the agreement, Amazon has the right to buy any of your remain-
ing title that it has in stock at the 45 percent price. This is actually a
good thing. Here’s something not as good: If they end the agreement
after the first six months (or during the first six months because of
something naughty that you did), you pay for the returns.
 Just friends. Just so you know, by signing up for Advantage, you’re not
“in business” with Amazon.com. Basically, they owe you nothing outside
of the agreement.
 They’re not promising the moon. Amazon’s deep pockets are closed to
you when it comes to litigation. If something were to happen that was
their responsibility and that affected your sales, they would only be
liable for the total amount of your previous year’s Advantage profits
(your 45 percent).
 This applies to you and yours. If you put someone else in charge or give
that person ownership of your titles, then that person is beholden to the
agreement. Also, you have to notify Amazon in writing when you make
this designation.
Remember, by applying for the program, you’re agreeing to the terms and
conditions outlined in the membership agreement.
281
Chapter 17: Leveling the Playing Field: Amazon.com Advantage

Instructions and rules
Because they are referred to so many times in the membership agreement,
the instructions and rules are also part of the agreement. So you should get
to know them.
I’ve outlined some of them earlier in this chapter (in the “Who Can Apply?”
and “The Program Basics” sections), but you can access the instructions and
rules in their entirety on the site (unlike the membership agreement, they’re
written in laymen’s terms). Here’s how:
1. Click See More Stores.
You find this link at the top of almost every page on the site, just to the
right of the tabs.
2. Click Advantage in the Make Money box.
The Make Money box is on the right side of the store directory page. 
3. Click either of the Read More About the Advantage Program links.
There’s one in the first paragraph and one in the box on the left.
4. Click Instructions & Rules.
You find this link in the Browse box under Additional Information.
Get Ready to Apply Yourself
When you apply for Advantage, you’re getting ready to participate in a real —
legally binding — business relationship. Nothing too scary there, but it’s
worth keeping your eyes open.
You have to remember two things: By sending off your application you’re
agreeing to Amazon’s terms and conditions should you be accepted, and not
everyone gets accepted. Amazon reserves the right to deny membership at
their sole discretion. If you don’t meet the criteria I outlined in the “Who Can
Apply?” section earlier in this chapter, you definitely won’t be accepted, but
the “sole discretion” part means they can deny your application for reasons
other than those — say, because the guy you bullied in fifth grade is now the
guy who approves applications at Amazon.com Advantage. (Okay, not really.
But weirder stuff has happened.)
When you sit down to apply, make sure you’ve thoroughly read the member-
ship agreement and the instructions and rules. Also, have your checkbook
(business checkbook if you’ve got one) ready.
282
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

The application is meaty. You have to give them two types of information:
your Advantage account information and your titles information. Steps 1
through 15 are Advantage account information — long but relatively painless.
Steps 16 through 18 are title information — just three steps, but more work.
Step 19 is a cinch — just double-checking your work. 
Here’s how to apply:
1. Click See More Stores.
There it is at the top of almost every page on the site, just to the right of
the tabs.
2. Click Advantage in the Make Money box.
This is on the right side of the store-directory page.
3. Click either of the Read More About the Advantage Program links.
There’s one in the first paragraph and one in the box on the left.
4. Click the Apply Now! button.
This takes you to a page that looks like Figure 17-2. As you work through
this page, be sure to read it carefully.
5. Check the boxes to show that you are eligible to be an Advantage
member.
And really, don’t apply unless you’re positive that you’re eligible.
6. Check the box that indicates you’ve read — and agree to — the terms
and conditions in the membership agreement.
I know I’m starting to sound like your mom, but I’ll say it one more time:
Did you do your homework? If not, read that agreement, make sure you
understand it, and consider having a lawyer check it out for you. (That’s
the last time. I promise.)
7. Enter a login name and password in the fields provided.
As always, pick a password that’s easy for you to remember and hard for
someone else to guess. Amazon suggests you write them both down and
that’s not a bad idea (as long as you have a really secure place to keep
the piece of paper). Also, note that unlike your consumer Amazon login
and password, these are case sensitive.
8. Enter the name and URL for your own Web site in the fields provided.
This isn’t mandatory, but it helps them in their application-review
process.
9. Use the drop-down menu and field provided to tell them how you dis-
covered the program.
Again, not mandatory, but this helps them with their own marketing
efforts — and they’re the nice people who are helping out your business,
so give ’em a hand.
283
Chapter 17: Leveling the Playing Field: Amazon.com Advantage

10. Click Continue.
Now it’s time to fill out your account info (as in Figure 17-3).
11. Enter the contact information for the inventory person in the fields
provided.
This is the person responsible for keeping your titles stocked. Amazon
asks for all the usual suspects — name, e-mail address, and mailing
address. Notice that the drop-down menu for country includes the U.S.,
Canada, and Mexico — and only those. Remember, Advantage is for
North America only (that Advantage for books in the U.K. is so far the
only exception).
12. On the Business and Payment Contact side of the page, either check
the handy box or enter your business-and-payment contact informa-
tion in the fields provided.
If the business-and-payment person is the same as the inventory person,
just check the box. If not, enter the new person’s contact information.
13. Enter your taxpayer identification information in the fields provided.
For the first field, if you’re an individual, use your Social Security
number. If you have a tax ID number, use that. Use the drop-down menu
to indicate your taxpayer status.
14. Click the appropriate circle to select how you want to get paid, and
then click Confirm.
You don’t have to choose electronic funds-transfer, but it’s easier and
cheaper. You can choose to have Amazon cut a check, but they have to
owe you at least $100 before they can do it, and then they charge you $8
per check. Anyone who doesn’t have a U.S. bank account has to opt for
the check.

15. If you chose electronic funds-transfer as your payment method, enter
your bank account information in the fields provided (as in Figure 17-4)
and click Confirm. If you chose to receive a check, move to the next
step.
You’re asked to enter your bank name, your routing number (if you need
it, use the Help link for some guidance with this one), your account
number, and the name of the primary account holder. Use the drop-
down menus to indicate the type of account.

Chapter 17: Leveling the Playing Field: Amazon.com Advantage

16. Enter the ISBN or UPC for each of your titles in the fields provided,
use the drop-down menus to indicate product type, and then click
Continue.
Your titles have to have ISBN or UPC numbers in order to be accepted
into the program. ISBNs are 10 digits long and UPCs are 12. Don’t include
any hyphens or spaces, and make sure the numbers you enter in the
fields (as in Figure 17-5) match the numbers on your titles. If they don’t,
Amazon can’t accept them when they arrive.
17. Enter your title’s critical information in the fields provided.
You come to a page that looks like Figure 17-6. (This is a book page. CD
and DVD/video pages differ as you might expect). You fill out a page like
this for each title you are submitting. Note that you’re asked for the
item’s suggested retail price. Keep in mind that Amazon has the ultimate
say here.
18. Enter any optional information and click Continue.
You have the option to enter a description of the title, an author/artist
bio, and any excerpts from reviews the title has gotten. Do it! The more
information you give, the more likely someone is to buy.
Applicable copyright laws dictate that you can only use up to 20 words
of a review from any given source. Also, make sure you indicate the
source of the review in the designated field, not in the review field itself.
19. Confirm your application and then click the Yes, I Want To Add New
Title(s) To My Advantage Account button.
Your application won’t be complete until you click that button. When
you do, you’re taken to a confirmation page. Phew!

Applications take a couple of weeks to process, but you receive an e-mail
almost immediately confirming that your application was received.
Members Only
After you’re accepted into the program, you find a wealth of resources at
your fingertips. I can’t tell you how to use each one in this book. (That’d be a
book on its own. Okay, maybe not a book, but a large pamphlet.) But I can
give you a bird’s-eye view of what’s there and what you can do with it.
First things first. Here’s how you log in:
1. Click See More Stores.
You find this at the top of almost every page on the site, just to the right
of the tabs.
2. Click Advantage in the Make Money box.
This is on the right side of the store directory page.
3. Click the Log-In button.
This takes you to the official login page. Bookmark it so you have easy
access from now on.
4. Enter your login name and password in the fields provided and click

The magic box
On each page of the Advantage member site is a little box in the upper-left
corner. Figure 17-8 gives you a close-up view.
Here’s what you can do from the magic box:
 Add titles. Just click the button and fill out a quick form to identify your-
self. You’re swooped back into the title-adding process (from the appli-
cation, remember?).
 Check your orders. Your Check Orders page gives you a history of new
orders, orders that have been confirmed but not received, and com-
pleted orders (as in Figure 17-9). Click any order to see its details and a
shipping label to use when you send copies of it off to Amazon.

 View your reports. Find out how your titles are performing by viewing
your reports. You get sales and inventory information for each title in
the program.
 Change your account info. Here’s where you change things like contact
information, payment options, and so on.
 Access the Information Center. The Information Center is your good
friend. Find everything from shipping info to payment help here. It’s a
humble little box — free of festoon — but it’s the central nervous system
of the program.
The Information Center
This page is essentially the same as the Advantage members home page.
Click Info center in the magic box at the top left of the page and you see that
the only change is the disappearance of the Maximize Your Membership box
at the top. True to its name, this is where you can find out just about any-
thing you might ever want to know about your account and the program. But
remember, it’s not called an Action Center; if you’re ready to get stuff done,
use the magic box. The Information Center is more of a resource.
Here’s a quick overview of the areas in the Advantage Information Center:
 Your Account. Your Account is where you find info on your membership
responsibilities, how to contact Amazon, how to edit your contact infor-
mation and change your login and password, and how to close your
account. 
Figure 17-9:
The
Advantage
orders page.
289
Chapter 17: Leveling the Playing Field: Amazon.com Advantage

 Your Titles. This is the everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-your-
titles-but-were-afraid-to-ask” section. You can find info on everything
from how to submit cover art to whom to contact if you need a new ISBN
or UPC.
 Orders. Here’s where you get the word on everything from order-
processing times to Amazon’s lost-orders policy.
 Payment. Ah, yes. The money. Go here for all payment-related 
information.
 Shipping. This refers to how you should ship your titles to Amazon, and
it’s the meatiest of all sections. You’ll probably use this area often. Find
out about everything from damage standards to how to ship entire pal-
lets (and I hope you have a need for the latter, because that’s a sign
you’re doing some wheeling and dealing).
The Matter of Marketing
When you’re an Advantage member, your titles appear in Amazon’s catalog.
But you can make them perform better by marketing them. Some of the mar-
keting opportunities available to you cost money and some are free. You
should definitely take advantage of the free ones; if you’re flush, consider the
others as well.
You are responsible for the fate of your titles. Advantage offers a great selling
forum (Amazon.com, of course) but you have to market your titles yourself!
Using the Marketing Resource Centers
The first thing you should do is check out the Marketing Resource Centers.
There are three — books, music, and video (DVD) — and they’re free. You
can access them most easily from the box on the lower-left side of the
Advantage member home page (shown in Figure 17-10). This box is also on
most other main pages in the member site.
Figure 17-10:
Access the
resource
centers
from this
box.
290
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

These resource centers probably aren’t going to change your life, but they do
offer some good information. You find things like articles on how to market
your titles, tips for “guerilla marketing,” contact information for publications
(so you can get your titles reviewed and get some free PR), and more.
Making your detail page sing
This is the key to selling well on Amazon.com. You can easily make your
detail page a winner — and it’s 100 percent free. Here’s how you can make
your detail page stand up and sing:
 Include a good photo. You can scan the cover art yourself and upload it
to the site, or send Amazon a copy (don’t send it to the distribution
center, but to the Advantage department) and they’ll scan it for you.
Either way, make sure there’s a picture on each of your titles’ detail
pages. For books, you can also include interior images (and you should).
 Write a thorough description. Give prospective buyers the info they
want. The more they know about your title, the more likely they are
to buy.
 Include comments. You have the option to include comments from the
publisher, label, studio, author, or artist. Do it! It’s fun for buyers to get a
glimpse behind the scenes, and remember, more info is good.
 Include a table of contents or track listing. Tempt them with a peek at
the goodies inside. (When you shop at Amazon, don’t you like to see this
stuff?)
 Include reviews. Including industry reviews is a good way to gain credi-
bility. Just be sure you obey applicable copyright laws; reviews are usu-
ally somebody’s copyrighted work.
 Upload MP3s. This is a relatively new feature for music Advantage mem-
bers. You can now upload your tracks to your detail pages as a part of
Amazon’s digital downloads.
You can find out more about how to spruce up your detail pages using the
Your Titles section of the Information Center.
Paid placements
You may not already know this (and you may not remember the scandal that
flared up around it in the late ’90s), but Amazon.com has a co-op program
(co-op is short for cooperative here and a co-op program, at least in this
case, means that publishers pay Amazon for specific placement on their site).
That means many of the items you see featured on the site are in the high-
visibility spots because someone paid for the placement. Does that mean
Amazon gives good reviews for money? No. It just means that a manufacturer,
291
Chapter 17: Leveling the Playing Field: Amazon.com Advantage

publisher, label, or whoever, can buy placement for their products on the site
(and in printed marketing materials). The review is unbiased — and typically
companies don’t choose to pay for high-visibility spots unless their items
have good reviews associated with them. (For the record, this is standard
practice in the retail world. How about those display tables at the front of big
chain bookstores? Co-op dollars put those books there.)
Paid Placements is a co-op program available to small Amazon vendors —
including, but not exclusive to Advantage members — whose annual sales
with Amazon are less than $1,000,000. It’s a chance for smaller companies to
get their products noticed, not just by more people, but by the right people to
help them succeed.
There are two paid-placement programs:
 Single New Product e-mails. These e-mails feature new releases and go
to a very targeted audience. Remember, Amazon has tons of info on the
people who buy from them and they put that info to use when sending
out marketing e-mails. They find people who have bought similar items
(or items from similar artists) and mail only to them. You choose which
titles are featured in a Single New Product e-mail.
 Buy X, Get Y. This is a promotion that lets you give shoppers a deal for
buying two titles together. The “deal” is featured on both titles’ detail
pages for one month (sometimes listed under the Best Value heading).
This is a great way to get lesser-known titles in front of your audience. 
Here’s how to get more info on the Paid Placements program:
1. Click See More Stores.
You find this at the top of almost every page on the site, just to the right
of the tabs.
2. Click Paid Placements in the Make Money box.
Notice that Paid Placements has its own button in the Make Money box —
it’s not a part of the Advantage section. That’s because there are several
small publishers, labels, and studios that sell at Amazon but aren’t in the
Advantage program.
3. Click the Sign Up button.
You can also click Click Here at the top of the page. Both take you to a
page that looks like Figure 17-11. You are not actually signing up here,
just filling out a form to get more information.
4. Enter your name and your business name in the fields provided.
Notice that they want your last name first.
5. Use the drop-down menu to choose your product line.
Notice that Paid Placements are only available for books, music, video,
and DVD.
292
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

6. Enter your ASINs or ISBNs in the fields provided.
To enroll in Paid Placements you have to already have a title or titles in
Amazon’s catalog. Every title in the catalog has a number that identifies
it — an ISBN for books and an ASIN for everything else. You’ll find these
numbers in the product information section on the detail page.
7. Use the drop-down menu to describe your relationship to the title.
The choices are Author, Artist, Publisher, Studio, Label, and Other.
Anyone is eligible here as this is only a request for information.
8. Enter your e-mail address and phone number in the fields provided.
If you already have an Amazon account, your contact e-mail address is
filled in automatically. You can change it if you want to.
9. Click the appropriate circle to indicate whether you’re an Advantage
member.
10. Use the drop-down menu to tell them how you heard about the pro-
gram, and then click Continue.
You’re asked to review your information before submitting it. Use the
Edit button to make any needed changes.
11. Click Submit.
You come to a confirmation page assuring you that info is on the way. You
should get that info via e-mail almost immediately. In that e-mail you find
the program costs, nomination form, and instructions on how to proceed.
All communication for the program is done via e-mail, so fill out the form
and send it back to the address included in the body of the e-mail.
Figure 17-11:

293
Chapter 17: Leveling the Playing Field: Amazon.com Advantage

“What about costs?” you may be asking. Single New Product e-mails cost $500
per new title, per e-mail; Buy X, Get Y costs $1,500 per one-month promotion.
You can pay Amazon yearly, quarterly, or title by title, but you have to send
them a check before they let you participate in the program.
The Matter of Money
Unlike other selling programs at Amazon.com, Advantage takes a serious cut
of the cash — 55 percent of list price, to be exact (and they determine the list
price to boot). So you may ask yourself, “What’s to stop me from getting
myself a zShop, selling my titles there, and paying only 5 percent?”
Technically nothing, but don’t do it.
If you asked most Advantage salespeople why you should join, they’d tell you
that Advantage is great because it helps get products out there. They’d tell
you that it takes the burden of fulfillment off the little guy and lets you focus
on producing. They’d probably tell you about the ease of keeping your inven-
tory up-to-date and the joy of getting paid on time. All that is true, but the
real reason to join Advantage is exposure.
With Advantage, your titles are in there with the big guys. Your books are in the
bookstore. Your CDs are in the music store. And your videos and DVDs are in
the video and DVD stores. When shoppers are browsing in those stores, they
find your titles just as they would those of the big publishers, studios, and
labels. Advantage puts you in the game in a way that zShops can’t.
Payment terms
Amazon automatically pays you at the end of every month for the items sold
the previous month. They pay 45 percent of the list price and they deposit it
automatically in your checking account. If you don’t have a U.S. checking
account, they write you a check (but they’ll charge you eight bucks for it!).
So, if in March (for example) you sell 17 copies of a $10 book, you’ll find
about $76 in your checking account at the end of April.
Annual fee
The Advantage program has a $29.95 annual membership fee. Amazon
deducts it from your Advantage account each May.
The fee is nonrefundable — even if they terminate your agreement.

three years later, it’s just a Web site, and I find myself thinking, What has that
Web site done for us lately?
You don’t have to have a lazy Web site. You can put your Web site to work.
With just a little bit of effort up front, you can make your Web site earn
money (and if you’ve got the right Web site, a lot of money). How? Become an
Amazon Associate, and instead of selling with Amazon.com, you can partner
with Amazon to earn some extra cash.
Associates is Amazon’s referral program — and with more than 1,000,000
members, it’s the Web’s largest. The concept is simple: You link from your
site to Amazon’s, and if one of your visitors uses your links to go to Amazon
and buy something, you get a referral fee. It’s an easy way to use your exist-
ing Web site to earn money.
In this chapter, I’ll explain the ins and outs of Associates. I’ll show you how to
join and I’ll explain how to take advantage of the spoils in Associates Central —
Amazon’s resource center for the Associates program. I’ll help you get that lazy
Web site of yours off its keister and on its way to the bank.

Associates Basics
Associates is a referral program — but with a high-tech spin. You sign up on
the site, you communicate via e-mail, you get paid via electronic funds-transfer
(or Amazon gift certificate), and all your referring happens on the Web. So do
you have to be web savvy to be an Associate? Yes. You don’t need to know
how to write HTML freehand, but you need to have a Web site that you can
add links to, and you need to know enough about HTML that you can figure
out where to paste the code that Amazon supplies. 
Who can join?
You do have to have a Web site to be an Associate, but having a Web site
doesn’t automatically make you eligible. This is Amazon we’re talking about.
They have a reputation to uphold. So here are the restrictions:
 Nothing XXX. Erotica, yes. Hard-core porn, no. Rough-and-ready rule
with Amazon is Keep it artsy and you’re usually good to go.
 No sites that promote violence. Because that’s just creepy. Besides,
what would you refer people to? Fight Club?
 No sites that encourage discrimination based on race, sex, religion,
nationality, disability, sexual orientation, or age. Sorry, white suprema-
cists, but Amazon is raining on your little hooded parade.
 Nothing illegal. If you’ve got a Web site that teaches people how to man-
ufacture crystal meth in their basements, you can forget about being an
Associate.
 No sites that have faux-Amazon names. This is a strange one, but it has
to do with Amazon protecting their intellectual property. Basically, they
don’t want you if your URL is an Amazon knockoff. The examples they
give are amazon.mydomain.com, amaozn.com, and
amazonauctions.net. (None of which exist, by the way.)
 No sites that violate intellectual property rights. So no “come here and
download a bunch of pirated software” sites, or anything like that.
These are the things that will definitely keep you from being an Associate.
Amazon also reserves the right to refuse anyone admission into the program
for any reason. That said, if you’re none of the above, you’ll likely be accepted.
How it works 
On the simplest level, it works like this:
296
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

 You sign up and are accepted into the program.
 You use Associates Central to get tagged links and graphics to add to
your site.
 Your visitors click the links and go to Amazon.
 They buy qualifying products during their sessions. (More on this later.)
 Amazon keeps track of their purchases (thus, your referral fees).
 You get paid quarterly in the total amount of your referral fees.
Good news! You get a referral fee any time a user goes from your site to
Amazon and makes a qualified purchase — even if you linked them to a spe-
cific product and they bought something totally different.
What you get
How much do you get paid? The short answer is from 2.5 percent to 15per-
cent on the purchase price of all qualifying products. But it’s actually much
more complicated than that.
There are four things you need to consider when figuring out what your
Associates booty might be:
 Qualifying products. Not all products sold at Amazon earn referral fees.
The following are exempt: products sold through Auctions or zShops,
products sold by the Gap, Old Navy, or Nordstrom, products sold by
partners like drugstore.comtm, and most of the wireless service plans
sold on the site.
 The session. When your buyer buys also determines whether a purchase
earns a referral fee. The span of time during which referral fees can be
earned is called the session. It starts when a potential buyer clicks from
your site to Amazon, and ends when 24 hours goes by, or they order the
product, or they click another Associate’s link.
 Varying referral fees. Different products earn different fees:
• “Individually linked books” earn the magic 15 percent. This is a
special category — and the only one that earns such a high referral
rate. To get this rate, you have to link directly to a book from your
site and a user has to go there and buy it immediately, without
going anywhere else on the site first. Also, the book must be listed
at 10 percent to 30 percent of the publisher’s listed price.
• ToysRUs.com, BabiesRUs.com, and Imaginarium.com products
earn 5 percent.
297
Chapter 18: Cash by Association: Amazon Associates

• Third-party-seller products (this includes anything in the apparel
store and all used products) earn 2.5 percent.
• All other products earn 5 percent unless you used Easy links on
your site (more on this later), in which case they earn 6 percent.
 The fee structure you choose. There are two fee structures within the
Associates program: the Classic fee structure and the Tiered fee structure.
The Classic fee structure calculates your referral fees on an item-by-item
basis according to the amounts described above. Until fairly recently, this
was the only fee structure. The Tiered fee structure also uses the amounts
described above, but offers an additional bonus. The catch is that you
have to meet certain criteria to be eligible for the bonus.
• You have to make at least 121 referrals a month that result in a
qualified sale. If you make fewer than 121 but more than 40, you
get no bonus. If you make fewer than 41, you pay Amazon. Yes,
that’s right. You pay them 20 percent of the referral fees you earned
that quarter.
• At least 5 of those 121 must be nonmedia items. That means any-
thing but books, music, videos, or DVDs.
So the Tiered program is really for “bigger” Associates. In fact, it’s great for
bigger Associates. The more you refer and sell, the bigger your bonus gets.
Figure 18-1 is the Tiered fee schedule for the fourth quarter of 2003.
There are a few other things you should know about the Tiered fee structure:
 To be eligible, you have to use the new Easy Links on the home page
of your site. These links are updated dynamically by Amazon.com —
very cool!
 You have to opt in to the program. If you don’t, you continue to earn
according to the Classic plan.
 The payment structure is not permanent. The Tiered fee structure is still
in the development phase and Amazon is trying to find the happy zone. So
they reserve (and exercise) the right to change the payment structure.

Surprise, Surprise . . . 
Darrell Benatar’s wife, Lisa, was the gift giver in
the family. She was always looking for good
ideas and asking friends for gift-giving sugges-
tions. Darrell thought, What if there were a
place on the Web where you could solicit and
offer good gift-giving advice? And Surprise.com
was born. (See the figure included here.)
They wanted the site to have both depth and
breadth, so they knew they couldn’t carry all the
gifts they were suggesting as inventory. They
also wanted Surprise.com to be totally credible.
By simply referring people to good products,
they could hold on to that credibility — they’d
never have to unload inventory or kowtow to
advertisers. But the question then became,
“How do we make money if we’re not selling
anything and we want to remain credible?” The
answer was referral fees — and Amazon.com
was a natural choice. They had an established
referral program in Associates, the broadest
selection, and great customer service.
So can you make any money doing this? In non-
holiday months, Surprise.com brings in $5,000 to
$10,000 per month from Amazon.com alone. In
the fourth quarter, those numbers triple. And
consider this, Surprise.com started doing busi-
ness before the dot-com crash. Not only have
they survived, but they also have remained prof-
itable through it all.

only commitment you make by signing up is agreeing to their rules. Here’s
how to do it:
1. Click See More Stores.
It’s at the top of almost any page on the site.
2. Click Associates in the Make Money box.
You’ll find this on the right side of the store-directory page.
3. Click the Join Now button.
This is on the left side of the page. It takes you to a page that looks like
Figure 18-2. You don’t have to have an Amazon account to be an
Associate, but make sure you click the appropriate circle.
4. Enter your e-mail address and password in the fields provided and
click Submit.
Be sure to enter the e-mail address you want them to use when commu-
nicating with you about the program. You can use your Amazon pass-
word (if you have one) or create a new password. Just be sure it’s easy
for you to remember and hard for someone else to guess.
5. In the new page that appears, check the box to indicate that you’ve
read and agree to the terms and conditions in the Operating
Agreement.
Make sure you read that agreement. Nobody wants churlish lawyers
snapping at their heels.
6. Enter the payee information in the fields provided.
Figure 18-2:

address and

Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

If you’re applying as an individual, enter your name. If you’re applying
for your company, enter its name. This info tells your buyers who to
write the checks to, so to speak.
7. Enter your taxpayer information in the field provided and use the
drop-down menu to indicate your status.
Individuals can enter Social Security number; companies enter a tax ID
number.
8. Enter your contact information in the fields provided or check the box
if your contact information is the same as your payee information.
9. Click the appropriate circle to choose how you want to get paid.
You have three choices. You can be paid by electronic funds-transfer
(but only if you have a U.S. bank account), Amazon gift certificate, or
check.
They charge you an $8 fee per check.
10. Enter the name and URL for your Web site in the fields provided.
11. Describe your Web site and what you plan to list in the fields pro-
vided and then click Submit.
You can also use the drop-down menu to tell them how you found out
about the program. If you’ve chosen to be paid by electronic funds-
transfer, you’ll come to a screen that looks like Figure 18-3 and asks for
your bank account information. If you chose one of the other two
options, you’ll skip the next step.
12. Enter your bank account information in the fields provided and click
Submit.
They ask you to enter the bank name, account type, routing number (if
you need help on this one, click the Help link), account number, and
account holder name. Don’t fret. This information is perfectly safe.
13. Confirm your information and click Submit.
This confirmation page shows you the information you just entered.
Check through your application and use the Edit button if you need to
make changes.
14. Click the appropriate boxes to indicate which products you may be
referring and use the drop-down menus to further describe your com-
pany or organization.
You come to a page that looks like Figure 18-4. This is what I call the
“getting to know you” page. Don’t worry. You’re not committing to any-
thing here — just giving them a little info. For that second drop-down,
they’re really asking, “What kind of site are you?”

You’re finished. Your application is reviewed quickly — figure on no more
than a couple of days — and you receive an e-mail welcoming you to the pro-

you immediate access to Associates Central so you can get started on build-
ing your links right away.

Associates Central
Associates Central is your information resource for all things related to the
Associates program. It is the hub of the program and you’ll use it regularly to
 Build links to your site
 Look at your online earnings reports
 Get graphics for your site from the graphics library
 Update your account information
 Get news about Associates offers and program changes
 Find out how to better use the program
Before you can use Associates Central, however, you have to know how to get
there. Here’s how to access it from Amazon.com:

1. Click See More Stores.
It’s at the top of just about every page on the site.
2. Click Associates in the Make Money box.
You’ll find this on the right side of the store-directory page.
3. Click the Log-In button.
This is on the left side of the page in the Member Sign-In box. You’ll
come to the Log In screen, which looks like Figure 18-6. Bookmark this
page so you can access it quickly in the future.
4. Enter your Associates e-mail address and password in the fields pro-
vided and click Log-In.
There are two things to remember here. First, this is the e-mail address
and password associated with your Associates account, not necessarily
your Amazon customer account. Second, your Associates e-mail and
password are case-sensitive (unlike your Amazon customer account).

Figure 18-7 is the Associates Central home page; if you’re looking at it, you’re
logged in. The home page is a good place to get your Associates news. Make
sure you scroll down because sometimes there are goodies hiding below the
fold.
You can always get back to the Associates Central home page by clicking
either the Associates Central Home graphic above the nav on the right side of
the page, or by clicking the Associates Central Home link in the nav.

Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

To get back to the Amazon.com Welcome page, click the Amazon.com logo at
the top left of the page above the nav. You can move in and out of your
Associates account without having to log back in.
Clicking the Amazon logo takes you out of Associates Central, but it doesn’t
log you out. Notice the Logout button in the box in the upper-left corner of
the page below the nav. If you’re logged in and idle for long enough — that
means no clicking around or activity — Amazon logs you out automatically,
but the length of time before they do that is significantly longer than it is with
your customer account. If you’re using a public terminal, it’s important that
you log out when you’re done using Associates Central or you risk giving
strangers access to your Associates account.
Leaving Home: A quick lay of the land
The choices in the Associates Central nav are completely different from those
in the usual Amazon.com nav. There are no tabs here and no subnav. Just to
be clear, you are no longer in the store.
Here’s a quick look at the different parts of Associates Central:
 Browse Associates Web sites. This is a relatively new feature. You can
use it to see how other Associates are using the program.
 Build-A-Link. You’ll be using this area a lot. This is where you’ll find
instructions and HTML for the different kinds of links that you can add
to your site. These links fall into two categories: Amazon Recommends
links (which are dynamic) and Static links. The former links — which are

home page. 
305
Chapter 18: Cash by Association: Amazon Associates

especially cool — allow you to do everything from adding promotional
links that get updated automatically to creating dynamic links based on
specific keywords (also known as keyword links).
 Logos & Graphics. This is the kissing cousin of Build-A-Link. Associates
has a huge library of buttons, banners, and logos you can download and
add to your site. You’ll find them here.
 Best Practices. Best Practices is essentially a guide to getting the most
from the program. You’ll find tips, ideas, case studies, and more.
 View Reports. Here’s where you find your performance results, includ-
ing your earnings to date.
 Update Account. Use this area to do everything from editing your e-mail
address to changing your site classification.
 Payment Options. This is not related to your referral-fee structure, but to
the way in which Amazon compensates you. You can edit your current
payment option information or change your chosen method of payment.
 FAQ. The FAQ in Associates Central is really more of a Help department.
You’ll find tons of answers to questions you may have, plus a glossary of
terms, and a link to the operating agreement.
 Discussion Boards. Associates is a community. The discussion boards
are a great way to participate in that community. You’ll also find a read-
only announcement board in this section; look there for Associates pro-
gram news.
Adding to your site: Build-A-Link
versus Logos & Graphics
There are two places to go within Associates Central to get graphics to add to
your site: Logos & Graphics and Build-A-Link. Here’s a brief description of each:
 Logos & Graphics. This is what Associates started out as: a library of
prebuilt buttons and banners that lead to the stores and to many top-
level category pages. There are literally hundreds of static and animated
buttons and banners to choose from in this section. You’ll also find
Amazon.com logos here; you can use those to link to the Welcome page. 
When you use these buttons and banners, you have to host them your-
self. That means that, after you download them, you are responsible for
putting them (and keeping them) up on your site. You copy the images
from the Associates site and then upload them to your site’s directory.
 Build-A-Link. Build-A-Link, for the most part, doesn’t offer prebuilt
images. Instead, it gives you a variety of ways to create customized
and/or dynamic links for your site. They’re easy to create, but (unlike
the images in Logos & Graphics) they do require some setup work.
306
Part IV: Making Money at Amazon.com 

Whether you’re using images from the image library in Logos & Graphics, or
creating your own keyword link (a dynamic link based on specific keywords)
in Build-A-Link, Amazon.com makes adding to your site as simple as is possi-
ble. Here are a few things you should know about how the process works:
 Amazon generates the HTML. All you have to do is cut and paste it into
your site’s code. 
 Your code is automatically tagged. When you log in, Associates knows
to tag any HTML they create for you with your specific information.
That’s how they recognize the shoppers you refer.
 Amazon can serve some of your links. For many of the links available,
you can choose to have Amazon.com serve them. What this means is
that you paste the HTML they provide into your site’s code and you’re
done. You don’t have to upload graphics. Amazon will take care of that
dynamically through the code they give you.
 You upload the graphics if you’re hosting your own links. If you
choose not to use the dynamic links they offer, you’ll need to copy the
graphics for your link from Associates Central and then upload it to the
image directory you’re using for your Web site.
More on Build-A-Link
There are several different kinds of links you can create in Build-A-Link. They
fall into two categories: Amazon Recommends links and Static links.
Amazon Recommends links
These are dynamic links that Amazon serves and updates regularly. You enter
the code and (in some cases) choose the subject matter; Amazon refreshes
the content of the link accordingly. In other words, you don’t have to upload
any graphics to your site. The idea is to keep your content fresh without
having to do any additional work. Here are the different types of Amazon
Recommends links:
 Easy Links: Easy Links promote special offers at Amazon.com. They are
essentially advertising and Amazon will update them with whatever hot
offers they have at moment. See Figure 18-8 for an example of an Easy Link.
 Amazon.com Platinum Visa® Card Links: When you add one of the ban-
ners or buttons to your site, you receive a $20 referral fee for each appli-
cant who gets approved. This is actually a special promotion that
Associates is offering its members; it may end at any time, depending on
the success of the program. In the meantime, it’s a great deal. The good
news is that if it does end, you don’t have to worry about updating your
site. Because this is a dynamically served link, Amazon just refreshes the
content with other promotional offers — your Visa promo link becomes
(in effect) an Easy Link.
307
Chapter 18: Cash by Association: Amazon Associates

 Keyword Links: These are very cool. You choose a product category
and then enter keywords and Amazon serves up a variety of relevant
graphics to your site. So, for example, if you have a Louisiana travel site,
you might choose “books” in the drop-down menu and then enter “food”
and “New Orleans” in the keyword field. If you did, you’d get something
that looks like Figure 18-9.
 General Bestsellers Links: These links allow you to grab the current top
sellers in a particular category. They change as the top sellers in that
category change. Figure 18-10 is an example of a General Bestseller Link
for cooking, food, and wine books.
 Browse-based Bestsellers Links: These links allow you to be more spe-
cific with your top seller lists. While General Bestseller Links access top-
level categories within each store, browse-based bestseller links allow
you to drill down until you’re just above the detail page. And, like
General Bestseller Links, these are updated as they change on the site.

Static links
Static links don’t refresh as Amazon Recommends links do, but they allow
you to be more specific with the content you offer. Here are the different
types of Static links that you’ll find at Associates Central:
 Individual Item Links: These are exactly what they sound like: links that
go directly to a specific item’s detail page. You pick the item and you can
either have Amazon serve — deliver via the Web — the graphic to your
Web site or host it yourself (for example, keep it on your own server and
deliver it yourself). I recommend the former, though, because the served
graphics include the item’s price and a Buy from Amazon.com button.
Figure 18-11 is the preview for a served individual item link for eBay For
Dummies, including the HTML on the box on the left.
 Quick-Click Links: These allow your customers to buy individual items
without having to go to Amazon.com. Your graphic includes a button
that says buy from Amazon.com. When users click the button, a
window pops up with a Ready to Buy? box. (See Figure 18-12 for an
example.) All Ready to Buy? boxes have the Add To Shopping Cart
button, but if that person is a recognized Amazon customer, they’ll also
have the option to buy with 1-Click.

Chapter 18: Cash by Association: Amazon Associates

 Amazon.com Home Page Links: According to Associates, these are the
most effective Static links. They’re also incredibly simple — in effect,
they’re plug-and-play.
 Search Box Links: There are two types of Search Box Links: with a 
drop-down menu and without. Either way, your visitors will use these
just as they do the Search box on Amazon’s site. They’ll enter keywords
and be taken to search results. If you choose to have a drop-down
menu included, you can customize the contents of the menu by using the
Customized Search Box feature. Figure 18-13 is my electronics Customized
Search Box Link. You can choose to have the contents in a drop-down
menu or listed out.
 Search Results Links: If you know what content you want your user to
see, create the search results yourself. With these links, you choose the
subject matter and your visitors are taken to those search results.
 Subject and Genre Browse Menus: These take your visitors to specific
browse pages. There are 17 different choices for Browse Menu Links and
each one has a drop-down menu.
 Favorite Destination Links: These are prebuilt links to Amazon hot spots.
 Links to Any Page: This is the catch-all. If you can’t find what you need
anywhere else, try this, but note that you can’t use it to link to search
results. You have to use the Search Results Link for that. Also, if you’re
thinking of linking to a seasonal page, keep in mind that the page goes
away after the season.

More on Best Practices
Best Practices is basically a free Web marketing tutorial from the best in the
business. So it’s worth your while to take advantage of it. You’ll find it by
clicking on it in the Associates subnav. Here’s an overview of what you’ll find
in that section of Associates Central:
 Cross-promotion tips: There’s a big push in the Associates program to
promote nonmedia products — anything other than books, music,
videos, and DVDs (those are, of course, the first four products Amazon
offered, and they get plenty of attention). This section helps you pro-
mote nonmedia products on your site. It includes things like how to pick
the right products to promote, and how to use your reports to help
determine what products your visitors want to buy.
 Get more traffic: As they state in the introduction to this section, traffic
is the key to success when it comes to the Associates program. It doesn’t
matter how well you pick products or how many great links you add if
nobody comes to your site. This is a rich section of Best Practices. (See
Figure 18-14 for the Get More Traffic category page.) You’ll find good
advice on how to work with search engines, plus case studies on what
other Associates have done to generate traffic.
 Promote smarter: This section is a good complement to the cross- 
promotion section. It includes tips on how to select items and tips on
how to best use the links Associates offers.
 Learn from other associates: This takes you to a box at the bottom of
the Best Practices page where you’ll find a collection of case studies in
the Best Practices section.
 Power Users: This section is for Associates who want to use Amazon
Web Services as a part of their participation in the program. (See
Chapter 16 for more on Web services.)
 Other helpful tips: This resource section offers links to other sites.
You’ll find links to HTML how-to sites, links to online marketing sites,
and so on.

More on View Reports
Build-A-Link, Logos & Graphics, and Best Practices are definitely where you
need to start when you join the Associates program. But the View Reports
section of Associates Central may be the most important place in terms of
determining your future success.
Your reports are pieces of a puzzle and it’s your job to put them together. If
read carefully and extrapolated from effectively, they can help you figure out
what it is that your visitors want to buy, and how you should get them to those
products from your site. You may think the answer is obvious — “I have a site
about dogs so I’m going to sell dog books to my visitors by linking directly to
them.” But your reports may tell a totally different story. You may find that
though your visitors are dog enthusiasts, they are clicking from your site to the
dog books you recommend, leaving those detail pages, and buying CDs.
All this gallivanting on the part of your visitors is no reason for dismay! That’s
good information. Remember, no matter what product you recommend, if a vis-
itor goes from your site to Amazon and buys a qualified product within 24
hours, you get a referral fee. So if you discover that visitors from your site want
to buy CDs instead of dog books, put that knowledge to work for you. Send
them to the Music store or send them to the Welcome page. Test out both
options and then review your reports again to see what worked.

of action associated with it.) This is the first page you come to when you visit
View Reports. You’ll notice that there are two kinds of reports that you can
look at: earnings reports and traffic reports. You’ll also notice that there’s an
overview of your link performance. This tells you whether or not specific link
types are actually generating sales for you. 
Earnings reports
If you click the See Report button next to the Your Earnings heading on the
Snapshot page, you’ll come to the Earnings Reports page. You can view your
earnings reports by total or by per-item earnings. You can also tailor your
report by date.
Figure 18-16 is a per-item earnings report. It’s essential that you look not only
at your total earnings, but also at your per-item earnings. The latter can help
you figure out how to better identify what your visitors want to buy.
Traffic reports
Traffic reports are equally as important as earnings reports. You can access
your traffic reports by clicking the See Report button next to the Traffic
Summary heading on the Snapshot page. You can view traffic by day, by item
purchased, by click through, and by linking method. Figure 18-17 shows a
traffic report by click through. You can see that of all the items this Associate
linked to, the Lord of the Rings item had the highest click through rate — that
is, more people clicked on that link than any of the others.

There are more than 1,000,000 Associates out there and some of them are
really making the most of the program. Here are a few good Associate sites 
to check out:
 Surprise.com. This great-gift-ideas site uses several different types of
links. It also runs the gamut in terms of what types of products it fea-
tures. Go to www.surprise.com.
 Musicchoice.com. This is a music lovers’ site that has news, audio
streams, and recommendations for CDs that users can purchase at
Amazon. You’ll find it at www.musicchoice.com.
 Boxofficemojo.com. This is a movie lovers’ site. They’re making good

F
or the first year or so that I worked at Amazon, I was responsible for
crafting the e-mails that we sent to customers. Even back then, we were
very conscious of people’s aversion to spam — so we took painstaking mea-
sures to make sure those e-mails were as un-spamlike as possible. My assign-
ment was to make each e-mail brief but informative, friendly but professional,
relevant, engaging, intelligent, and if possible, witty. I developed an apprecia-
tion for e-mail.
When you circulate in the Amazon community — as both a buyer and a
seller — you find that your inbox quickly fills up with Amazon-related e-mail.
There’s a lot of communicating to do, and it all happens electronically.

In this chapter, I identify ten of the e-mails you might get from Amazon.com. I
show you the e-mails you automatically get as a buyer, the e-mail you automati-
cally get when you sell something at Amazon, and a few of the e-mails you
might get if you choose to take advantage of some of Amazon’s fun features.
Order Confirmation 
The Order Confirmation e-mail (see Figure 19-1) is the cornerstone of
Amazon’s e-mail communication. You get one every time you order and it
contains all the info you might need regarding that order: links to Your
Account, purchasing information, and an order summary.
Your Item Has Shipped
You receive this e-mail as soon as your order leaves the distribution center. It
includes a link to Your Account, a summary of what was shipped and where
they shipped it, and a tracking number (Figure 19-2 shows what to look for.) 
You Are a Winner!
Of course you already knew that, but still, it’s nice to get some validation
from Amazon.com. There’s nothing out there that satisfies the competitive
Figure 19-1:

confirmation
e-mail.

shop-a-holic quite like the Amazon Auctions You Are A Winner! e-mail. (Check
out Figure 19-3.) It means that not only are you going to get something you
wanted, but you also beat someone else out in the process. Hooray!
Sold — Ship Now!
Almost as thrilling as the thought of winning is the thought of selling your
stuff. The very first time I posted something on Amazon.com using
Marketplace, I was doubtful. I did it as an experiment more than anything
Figure 19-3:
I’m a
winner!
Woo-hoo!

else. When I got the e-mail announcing that my item had sold, it was a shock.
For some reason, I didn’t believe it would work. But it did, just like that, and I
was suddenly a few bucks richer.
The Sold e-mail is a bit more complicated than other e-mails you might get
from Amazon.com because it contains the information you need to complete
your transaction. Figure 19-4 is a standard “sold” e-mail for Marketplace. It
includes the sale details, the buyer’s shipping address, a packing slip to
include when you ship, and other important information.
Shared Wish List 
Do you have a Wish List yet? Have you read Chapter 12? If you answered “no”
to either question, you need to get a-crackin’. There are occasions to be cele-
brated and gifts to be purchased . . . for you, of course.
When you create a Wish List (and any time after you create a Wish List), you
can elect to share it with loved ones. This may seem a little brutish, but I’m
telling you, it makes life easier for the people who buy you gifts.
When you share your Wish List, your loved ones get an e-mail from
Amazon.com (next best thing to a little bird telling them). You can use the
default message that Amazon supplies, or you can fill in your own — as I’ve
opted to do in Figure 19-5.
Figure 19-4:

all the info

your sale.
320
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Cancellation E-Mail
When you cancel an item that you’ve ordered (before it’s hit the shipping
process, of course) Amazon will send you an e-mail confirming your cancella-
tion, as shown in Figure 19-6. Notice that the e-mail is very brief (don’t take it
personally). It tells you the status of the order — cancelled — and lists the
item that was in the order.
New for You
This is another e-mail notification that you can sign up for (in Your Store).
New for You e-mails (see Figure 19-7) include new releases, recommendations,

Chapter 19: Ten E-Mails You Might Get from Amazon.com

and articles or interviews. But it’s not just a random selection of stuff. The
content is chosen for you, based on your purchase history. So it’s stuff you’re
likely to be interested in.
Share the Love
Will Share the Love unite the world in its shopping embrace? Probably not,
but it is a good way to help your pals while helping yourself. Share the Love
is Amazon’s program that lets shoppers give their friends discounts on cer-
tain items they’ve bought. If those friends then buy the items, the original
shopper gets a credit to apply to some other purchase down the line. (If you
need a refresher, read Chapter 12.)
You don’t have to do a thing to receive a Share the Love e-mail (except be
someone who’s loved). When you receive one, it looks something like Figure
19-8. (Okay. I admit it. I sent this one to myself.)
Special Occasion Reminders
You set up these reminders in the Friends & Favorites area of your store. You
choose the occasion, when and how often to be reminded, and then enter the
date. Amazon sends you an e-mail reminding you. (See Figure 19-9.) If you give
Figure 19-7:

them the giftee’s e-mail address, they hunt to see whether there’s a Wish List
associated with it — and surface that for you. If gift giving is the meat and
potatoes of your relationships, these e-mails can really save your rump roast
(and maybe your marriage).
Weekly Movie Showtimes
This is a nifty feature that you’ll find in Amazon’s Video and DVD stores and
in the Store Directory under the Services heading. You enter your zip code,
and Amazon will send you an e-mail every Friday (sometimes late Thursday

I
love a bargain. I love the hunt. I love the moment of finding that amazing
deal — and even more, I love the moment of telling someone about it. Even
when I don’t need a bargain, I want a bargain. It’s the malcontent in me. I like
the sensation of pulling a fast one. I want to feel that I’m outsmarting the man.
Amazon.com is a great place to hunt for bargains. Truth be told, you don’t
actually have to look that hard. There are bargains everywhere — ripe for the
picking. Recently, I got a pair of red leather Kaeppa tennis shoes for $9.95
(plus shipping). I saw them two days later on the site for $49.95. That was a
small victory for me.
In this chapter, I show you ten ways to get good deals at Amazon.com. Some of
them I’ve already covered in the book, and some are new material. Some offer
really good deals, and some will just save you a few bucks. But if you’re any-
thing like me, they all tickle your fancy and tempt the bargain-hunter in you.

The Outlet
Did you know that Amazon has an outlet? It’s true, and you don’t have to
drive to the middle of nowhere to get there. (And they don’t have racks and
racks of weird colors and size zeroes.)
The easiest way to access the Outlet is from the Bargains section of the Store
Directory. (Click the See More Stores link at the top of the page to get to the
Store Directory.) The Outlet is the most obvious place to go for deals. It’s a
collection of everything in the store that’s on clearance — plus you can link
to the refurbished items and the Friday sale from the Outlet subnav. (More on
the Outlet in Chapter 7.)
My particular favorite is the Kitchen and Housewares outlet. I have my eye on
the Ronco compact rotisserie — and look at that price (see Figure 20-1)! Can
you beat it? (If you can, please e-mail me.)
Striking Gold in Your Gold Box
Have you ever noticed the sparkly golden goodness in the upper-right corner
of every page? If you’ve got an Amazon account, that box even bears your
name. That’s your Gold Box, and if you’ve never looked at it, you’re a stronger
person than I am.
Your Gold Box is like your own personal bargain stash. It’s filled with ten
good deals on items chosen according to your shopping history. But here’s
Figure 20-1:
The Outlet is
square one
for great
deals.
326
Part V: The Part of Tens 

the thing: it changes every day, the offers are good for only 60 minutes from
when you open the box, and you only get one chance to buy — if you pass,
you pass forever.
Figure 20-2 is the first screen you see after you open your Gold Box. Fellow
shoppers, we are being taunted by Amazon.com — dared into passing up a
good deal. Them’s fightin’ words! (Please note: if you’re a bargain-hunter and
an indecisive person, Gold Box will be your undoing.)
At the Bottom of the Page
I mention this briefly in Chapter 9, and I’m mentioning it here again: There are
good deals to be found at the bottom of the page — every page. Fittingly
enough, they’re called “Bottom of the Page Deals” and they change every day.
One thing I’ve noticed about these deals is that they’re decidedly unglam-
orous. If you’re looking for a cute sweater at a steal, you’re not going to find it
at the bottom of the page. That said, you can find great savings on stuff you
might actually need.
Figure 20-3 is a look at one day’s worth of bottom of the page deals. Is there
anything there that’s going to give me bragging rights with my girlfriends? No.
Would I be glad to save $30 on beef jerky? Yes. (And I’m the person who
might buy the massive bag of beef jerky online.) 
Often you find mundane, household-type items at the bottom of the page. But
don’t knock it. If you’re going to buy the gigant-o-pack of beef jerky, wouldn’t
you rather get it for 30 bucks less and then spend that $30 on something
more fun? (If you saved it, then it’s free money!)

Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Get Great Deals

Super Saver Shipping
If you’ve got time, and you’re spending more than $25, you can save money
with Super Saver Shipping. Super Saver Shipping is Amazon’s way of helping
you save money and giving themselves a little extra time to ship your stuff.
Here’s how it works:
1. Find more than $25 worth of eligible stuff that you want to buy.
This can be one item or several, but make sure all items are eligible for
Super Saver Shipping. You’ll know because they’re marked with the little
shopping-cart icon.
2. Put the products you want in your Shopping Cart by clicking the Add
To Shopping Cart button on their detail pages.
This is important. You don’t get Super Saver Shipping automatically —
you select it during the checkout process. There is a way to get it with 
1-Click, but it’s actually more complicated than just buying with the shop-
ping cart.
3. After you’ve added your last item, click Proceed To Checkout.
You come to a Sign In screen.
4. Enter your e-mail address and password in the fields provided and
click that secure server button.
You come to your Order Review page. Notice that you have several
choices for shipping (as shown in Figure 20-4). To get Super Saver
Shipping, you must ship your items to a single U.S. address.

328
Part V: The Part of Tens 

5. Click the Super Saver Shipping circle to select that as your shipping
speed.
Your order will take, on average, about 3 to 5 days longer to ship. So if
you’re in a hurry, Super Saver Shipping is not for you. (Hey, either it’s
time or it’s money.)
6. Click Place Your Order.
You can save a lot of money. A lot! Check out Figure 20-4. Before I selected
Super Saver Shipping, I was going to pay almost $15 in shipping fees.
Amazon.com Trivia
This isn’t really a great deal, but it is kind of fun. On the Welcome page, below
the fold, is a trivia question (see Figure 20-5). If you answer it correctly,
Amazon puts a nickel in your account. If you click the Try for Another Nickel
button, they give you another question. If you answer that correctly, you get
another nickel. You can do this until you get bored, or until your boss
catches you.
I know. A nickel won’t buy you much. But you can answer the questions sev-
eral times a day, for several days in a row, and stockpile them. I have a friend
who’s saved up $1.35.

Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Get Great Deals

Trivia isn’t always there. Depending on what else is going on in the store, that
Welcome page real estate may be devoted to something with a higher profile.
Check back, though, and you’ll find it eventually.
You can use your trivia money toward a purchase on the site for up to10 per-
cent of the purchase price — not on any product; some restrictions apply. To
find out what those restrictions are, click the Learn More link below and to
the right of the trivia question.
Amazon.com Credit Card
The Amazon.com Platinum Visa is like a frequent flyer miles card, but for
shopping. It’s an awesome thing that I’m not allowed to get because I’ve been
barred (by my husband, not the law) from applying for any more credit cards.
You, however, are free to apply. Here’s the deal:
 You get 3 points for every dollar spent at Amazon.com, and 1 point for
every dollar spent anywhere else.
 For every 2,500 points you get, you get $25 to spend at Amazon.com.
Plus, there’s no annual fee. If you want to apply, just go to the Store Directory
(by clicking See More Stores) and click on the Amazon.com Visa Card link
under Services heading. Like all things Amazon, you apply online.
Better Together
This is sort of like twofers on the Web. Maybe you’ve noticed it on the detail
pages of certain items. (If not, check out Figure 20-6.) Amazon will offer up
another recommended item and you can buy them both at a discount.
Sometimes the discount isn’t much, but sometimes you luck out. Also, I’ve
noticed that sometimes this feature is called Best Value.

Today’s Deals
Today’s Deals mean that every day at Amazon.com is a sale day. (Music to
the ears of us bargain hunters.) There’s a general Today’s Deals area, and
then most individual stores have their own daily deals. 
You can access the general area most easily by clicking on Today’s Deals in
the subnav of the Welcome page. You’ll find deals for most of the different
product lines that Amazon sells, plus you can access all of the goodies they
advertise in the Sunday circular (of the newspaper, that is). To find daily bar-
gains within a specific store — DVD, Kitchen & Housewares, etc. — simply
click on Today’s Deals in that store’s subnav.
A word of caution: when you go to Today’s Deals, be prepared to buy. Just
this week I was browsing Today’s Deals in Kitchen & Housewares and I ended
up buying myself a $210 mandolin. BUT, I got it for the low, low price of $65 . . .
and it came with a fancy baking sheet as a free gift . . . and I qualified for free
Super Saver Shipping. Did I say the deals are good? I mean reeeeeeeeeally
gooooooood.
In Your Box
This isn’t necessarily a way to save money at Amazon, but a way to save
money compliments of Amazon. If you’ve ever ordered from Amazon — not a
Marketplace order, but a regular Amazon order — you probably found a
bunch of marketing material in your box when it arrived.
Figure 20-6:

In that marketing material, you find discounts at other pal-of-Amazon stores. I
myself am a big fan of Bluefly.com — and there are always Bluefly discounts
in my Amazon shipments. I’ve saved a bundle, compliments of my former
employer — and you can, too. But don’t throw the marketing material away!
You need the promotional codes in there when you make your purchase.
Friday Sale
Every Friday, Amazon has a special sale with extra special discounts. But
only on Friday. You can access the Friday Sale from the subnav in the Outlet
(and you can access the Outlet from the store directory). Figure 20-7 gives
you an idea of what you can find there.

ave I told you the story of the Turducken? It’s the chicken, stuffed in a
duck, stuffed in a turkey. The year zShops launched, it was the talk of
the office. People loved the Turducken and they were actually buying it for
the holidays. It was fascinating, in a train-wreck-meets-Renaissance-fair kind
of way. Who would think to do this? (Paul Prudhomme, it turns out.) And who
would think to sell it online? (Not Paul Prudhomme.) I’ve since discovered
that in any traditional Turducken (traditional? who knew?), the birds are
boneless. So the notion of finding just the right-size fowl and then cramming
one into the other and then the other has been debunked. But still . . . how
strange!
I admit that “strange” is a relative term — subjective and open to interpreta-
tion. And there is certainly no governing body at Amazon to identify universal
criteria for “strangeness.” But disclaimers aside, there are some wonderfully
odd items being sold on Amazon.com (and I say that with love in my heart).
In this chapter, I show you ten of them. Maybe they’re not the strangest — it’s
a big catalog, after all — but they’re definitely up there.

CyberPounce
Forget about balls of yarn and little rubber mice. If you are a pet owner of the
new millennium, you must buy your cat CyberPounce — the computer game
for cats. (See Figure 21-1.) It has two modes — one where your cat “plays”
alone, and one where the two of you can play together. This is a good way to
stimulate your cat’s imagination — and besides, it helps them master their
multiplication tables. 
I don’t know. My cat’s not smart enough to play computer games. He’d much
rather sit on my stomach and claw me when I’m trying to read. I think
CyberPounce is what happens when you allow software developers and
animal behaviorists to fraternize. 
Pyramat PM300 Sound Lounger
This subwoofer-meets-gym-mat is a gamer’s delight. I’m teasing, but I have to
tell you that I think the people at Pyramat are sitting (or lounging) on a gold
mine here. It’s a portable lounger/mat with a surround-sound speaker system
built into the headrest. (Check it out in Figure 21-2.) This thing has 25 perfect
reviews from people all across the country, including one that deems it the
“butt-kicking chair of the future.” I’m going to give this to my mother-in-law
for Christmas along with a PS2.

Ronco FD5 Food Dehydrator, Yogurt
Maker, and Beef Jerky Machine
This one makes the list just because of the yogurt/jerky combo. I love a good
jerky as much as the next girl, and, again, I’m tempted to buy myself some-
thing like this. But I hesitate when I see “yogurt” as part of the mix. That said,
people generally like this machine. It’s affordable. It makes good jerky and
fruit rolls. I gather from the reviews that it’s more of a “starter” dehydrator.
That’s okay with me. I’m not looking for a fancy dehydrator, just one that
sucks the moisture out of meat. And, as Figure 21-7 clearly shows, the Ronco
folks have space-age design down pat.

Why did they have to call it that? (Maybe it means something different in
dogspeak?). You won’t find the answer in Figure 21-9.

The Esoteric Amazon: Honor
System and Amazon Anywhere
T
here have always been two factions duking it out at Amazon.com: the
people who think it’s a high-tech company and the people who think it’s a
retail company. (Ask Jeff Bezos and he’ll probably tell you that it’s both.)
This is actually good for us customers. It’s because of these two factions that
Amazon is both technologically smart and a really good store. But every so
often, the technology side wins out. This isn’t bad for customers. It just
means that, occasionally, Amazon develops a feature that’s a little bit ahead
of its time. Honor System and Amazon Anywhere are two of those features.
On Your Honor (System)
Honor System is Amazon’s program that allows people who have Web sites to
charge for their digital content or take voluntary donations. In other words, if
you have a Web site, you can put a graphic on it that allows people to pay
you via Amazon.com. Here’s how it works:
 You have a Web site. And you want either to charge visitors for using it
or you want to accept donations. 
 You create a PayPage at Amazon.com. PayPages are essentially detail
pages, but for your company or organization. Your PayPage lives on
Amazon.com, and on it you explain what your company or organization
is all about — and why you’re asking for money. This is also where you
list any minimum donation information and other things like that. (See
Figure A-1.)
 You create a PayBox to put on your Web site. The PayBox is the
graphic that Amazon supplies (and you customize) to call visitors to
action! (See Figure A-2.)

Amazon.com For Dummies 
 Visitors click on your PayBox. They’re taken to your PayPage where
they can enter the amount they want to give (for donations) or are
paying (for content). 
 Visitors pay you via Amazon. Amazon requires a minimum payment of
$1 per transaction.
 Amazon sends them a Thank You e-mail. You create the text for this
e-mail when you set up your PayPage and PayBox.
 Amazon pays you and takes a commission. Amazon’s fees are 5 percent
of the total transaction plus a flat fee of $.19 per transaction.
Figure A-1 is the PayPage on Amazon for Lost and Found Sound — a program
on National Public Radio. Figure A-2 is the PayBox I clicked to access their
PayPage. It was very easy.
If you want to set up an Honor System for your organization, you can access
it easily from the Welcome page. Just scroll way down, almost to the bottom,
and on the left side of the page is a box labeled Special Features. Honor
System is a link in that box.

Honor System is a great idea. It’s especially good for charitable organizations
on a small budget, or anyone with a content-laden Web site that wants to get
paid for their hard work. But it hasn’t really caught on . . . yet.
Amazon Anywhere
Amazon Anywhere is Amazon’s mobile shopping program. Okay, I know lots
of you will be wondering why I’m listing this as a feature that’s ahead of its
time. After all, there are lots of people out there shopping online with their
Internet-enabled cell phones and PDAs. 
It’s true. But the reason I list it is because Amazon Anywhere has actually
been around for years — long before shopping with your cell phone was
something people knew about.
Amazon Anywhere launched when I still worked at Amazon.com. That was
almost four years ago — when cell phones were still the size of small babies.
Hardly anybody was using a cell phone to shop online — at least, nobody in
the U.S. (Mobile shopping? What a concept!) I didn’t even own a cell phone
when they launched Amazon Anywhere (or AA, as I like to call it), because —
let’s face it — if you have to shop so badly that you need to be able to do it
no matter where you are, you’ve got a problem.
Today, people in Japan use Amazon Anywhere like crazy, and it’s good for more
than just shopping. You can also use it to access Amazon content like customer
reviews — handy when you’re at the video store battling with your spouse
over what to rent. So if you’re inspired, and you’ve got a Web-enabled mobile
phone, PDA, or pocket PC, try Amazon Anywhere. For instructions on how to
get set up, go to the Amazon Anywhere section of the site. You can access it in
the Special Features box at the bottom left of the Welcome page — the same
place you go for Honor System.
