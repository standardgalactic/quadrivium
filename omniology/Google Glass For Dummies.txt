Introduction
W

elcome to Google Glass For Dummies, a resource for using the Google 
Glass wearable computer in your everyday life.
Glass is one of the first devices in the wearable-computing market, and 
though that’s really exciting — and probably is one of the reasons why you 
purchased Glass in the first place — you may not be prepared for the differ­
ences in the user interface. Interacting with Glass is unlike anything you’ve 
experienced before.
To help get you up to speed quickly, this book dishes out information about 
Glass in easily digestible chunks so that you can get answers to your ques­
tions fast and then get back to using your Glass to get directions, take pic­
tures, and much more.
About This Book
Unlike other books that require you to read an entire chapter in one sitting 
to understand what’s going on, this book is more like a dictionary — or, if 
you prefer, a printed version of what you find in online help. That is, you can 
search the book for the information you need, read the page that contains the 
answers, and then put the book down and get back to work (or play).
We discuss the following subjects (among others) in this book in plain 
English:
	
✓	Fitting Glass comfortably on your head and fitting the device with 
shades and shields
	
✓	Setting up Glass by using the MyGlass app in your web browser or on 
your smartphone
	
✓	Manipulating Glass by using your voice and your finger on the touchpad
	
✓	Using Glass responsibly so you can show it to others while respecting 
their privacy and safeguarding your data
	
✓	Taking pictures and shooting videos, and then sharing those photos and 
videos with others
	
✓	Navigating to your destination and getting suggestions from Glass about 
places to visit and photograph
	
✓	Troubleshooting and resolving problems with Glass

Google Glass For Dummies 
Within this book, you may note that some web addresses break across two 
lines of text. If you’re reading this book in print and want to visit one of 
these web pages, simply key in the web address exactly as it’s noted in the 
text, pretending that the line break doesn’t exist. If you’re reading this as 
an e-book, you’ve got it easy; just click or tap the web address to be taken 
directly to the web page.
Foolish Assumptions
We’ve taken the risk of making some assumptions about what you already 
have or know:
	
✓	You have some experience with computing technology, with a computer, 
tablet, and/or smartphone. You may have also seen Glass on the web or 
watched someone demonstrate the device.
	
✓	You either have Glass and want to know how to use it, or you have a 
keen interest in finding out more about it — perhaps to make a decision 
about purchasing the device.
	
✓	You want to know how to make Glass do what you want it to do.
We also assume that you’ll want to have this book nearby to help answer 
questions or resolve problems in your time of need.
Icons Used in This Book
Just like the screen of Google Glass, several icons throughout this book indicate 
important information. These icons, which appear in the left margin, tell you 
something extra about the topic you’re reading about or hammer a point home.
	
The Tip icon marks tips (duh!) and shortcuts that make using Glass easier.
	
The Remember icon marks information that’s especially important to know. 
To  siphon off the most important information in each chapter, just skim the 
Remember text.
www.it-ebooks.info

3
 Introduction
	
The Technical Stuff icon denotes information of a highly technical nature that 
you can skip if you want to (but we hope you won’t).
	
The Warning icon tells you to watch out! It flags important information that 
may save you headaches — not to mention your data — when you use Glass.
Beyond the Book
We’ve written a lot of extra content that you won’t find in this book. Go online 
to find the following:
	
✓	Web Extras: www.dummies.com/extras/googleglass
	
	Here, you’ll find online articles that go into more detail about how to use 
various Glass apps and discoveries we’ve made about Glass as we’ve 
used it in the real world.
	
✓	Cheat Sheet: www.dummies.com/cheatsheet/googleglass
	
	Our Cheat Sheet offers plenty of tips and tricks for making life with Glass 
easier.
	
✓	Updates to this book (if any): www.dummies.com/extras/
googleglass
	
	Google continually updates the Glass hardware and software, so you can 
keep your book up to date by reading our update articles.
Where to Go from Here
This book is yours, so you can annotate and augment the text any way you 
want — by highlighting text, adding notes, or placing bookmarks at strategic 
locations so you can return to those places quickly.
If you’ve just purchased Glass and want to get grounded in what the device is 
all about, flip to Chapter 1. If you can’t wait to get your Glass out of the box 
and start playing with it, however, start with Chapter 2.

Chapter 1
The World Through Glass
In This Chapter
▶	Introducing Glass
▶	Seeing how Glass fits into your life
▶	Discovering what you can do with Glass
▶	Beginning the exciting journey with Glass
Once a new technology rolls over you, if you’re not part of the steamroller, 
you’re part of the road.
— Stewart Brand
D

o you remember the first time you used your smartphone? Your tablet? 
What about your first computer? Your experience each time may have 
been the same: Not only are you using something that’s exciting and new, but 
also, your life is changing for the better.
That’s probably the same feeling you have with Google Glass, which is the 
next step in mobile computing. Instead of having to fumble with your smart­
phone to get things done, now you can wear a computer on your head and 
control it (mostly) with your voice.
Google Glass isn’t an immersive experience, in which you keep the unit on 
all the time and you’re continually distracted by it. Glass is on only when 
you want it on. Indeed, the Glass screen is off by default, and just as with 
any computer or smartphone, you have to take specific actions to turn it on.
	
Google Glass is a form of augmented reality, which means that it provides a live 
view of your physical environment augmented by what you see on the screen, 
such as a map of your current location. Augmented-reality environments cover 
your entire field of vision. Google designed the Glass screen to be above your 
field of vision, however, to make it as unobtrusive as possible.

Part I: Getting Started with Google Glass 
What Is This Thing Called Glass?
Wearable devices are a hot new area of computing, and companies are 
scrambling to create computers that you can wear on your wrist (called 
smartwatches) and computers that sit on your head like eyeglasses (called 
wearable computing glasses).
In the case of wearable computing glasses, Google recognized that seeing is the 
most natural way of consuming information and that computing technology has 
become small enough for a computer to fit within the frame of a pair of glasses.
Google created a small screen that pairs information with what you see in 
the natural environment, as shown in Figure 1-1. What’s more, it developed 
an operating system that understands your voice commands so that you can 
perform tasks without using your hands, arms, or neck.

Thus, Google Glass and the market niche of wearable computing glasses 
were born. Glass was a media sensation from the time it was announced, 
but despite all the hype (both good and bad), the mission of Glass hasn’t 
changed: to deliver information as quickly and conveniently as possible 
with cutting-edge technology.
Google Glass comes in five frame colors — charcoal, tangerine, shale, cotton, 
and sky — so you can match your Glass to your personality.

 Chapter 1: The World Through Glass
Google provides clear and shaded protective shields with Glass. The clear 
shields protect your eyes from the wind and other elements, and also make 
your Glass look like any other pair of glasses. The shaded shields reduce 
ambient light so you won’t squint outside on a sunny day.
	
At this writing, prescription shields have also been announced for Glass. You 
can search for Google Glass prescription to see what prescription lenses are 
available.
	
Before you buy, talk with your optometrist to find out whether using Glass 
with prescription lenses is right for you.
What does Google Glass do?
Here’s what Google Glass does when it’s on and connected to the Internet:
	
✓	Takes photos and videos, and sends them to one or more of your con­
tacts. The Glass camera sees the world through your eyes at the very 
moment you take the photo or record the video.
	
✓	Sends e-mail and text messages to your contacts, and receives the same 
from them.
	
✓	Allows you to chat live via video with one or more Google+ friends via 
Google Hangouts.
	
✓	Sends and receives phone calls.
	
✓	Searches the web with the Google search engine (of course) so that you 
can find information easily.
	
✓	Translates text from one language to another. Glass speaks the trans­
lated text and also shows a phonetic spelling of the translated word(s) 
on its screen.
	
✓	Provides turn-by-turn navigation with maps as you drive, ride, or walk to 
your destination.
	
✓	Shows current information that’s important to you, including the time, 
the weather, and your appointments for the day.
	
✓	Recognizes the song that’s playing on the device and identifies the 
artist(s) singing the song, in case you don’t know.
	
If your Glass is on but not connected to the Internet, you can only take 
photos and videos with the device. If you have a Wi-Fi connection, functional­
ity is expanded to sending and receiving e-mail messages, connecting to the 
Internet, sharing information on social networking websites, and participating

Part I: Getting Started with Google Glass 
in Google Hangouts for videoconferencing. You need to connect Glass to your 
phone if you want to use your phone’s 3G or 4G Internet connection, send SMS 
messages, and use GPS (Global Positioning System) so Glass can find your cur­
rent location.
How does Glass differ from 
other mobile devices?
Google Glass competes not only with other wearable computing glasses, but 
also with other mobile devices, including smartphones and smartwatches. 
Yet Glass is the most convenient wearable device produced to date and gives 
you the broadest access.
With Glass, for example, you don’t need to move multiple parts of your body 
to fish for your smartphone, keep the phone in your hand, and then hold 
your arm up to your ear for a while. Those maneuvers can be more painful 
than just moving your head and using your voice with Glass. What’s more, 
you can have a live video conversation with someone else, and that other 
person sees what your Glass camera sees.
In the case of a smartwatch, you have to move your wrist to your mouth (and 
possibly roll up your sleeve) so you can talk into the phone or see what’s 
happening on the screen. Smartphone screens are relatively small, and smart­
watch screens have to be even smaller to fit on your wrist, so your eyes may 
be strained. The Glass screen looks like a 25-inch television screen that’s 
8 feet away from you, so you don’t strain to see things.
	
You’ll still be talking on Google Glass in public as you would on a smartphone 
or smartwatch, of course, and you should follow proper etiquette when using 
your Glass. You find out about following Glass etiquette and using the device 
responsibly in Chapter 7.
How Glass Fits into Your Life
Several Glass applications (apps, for short) have been developed to make 
users’ lives easier:
	
✓	SMARTSign: This app teaches American Sign Language (ASL) to Glass 
wearers. The app was designed to help parents communicate with their 
hearing-impaired or deaf children and also teach ASL to their other chil­
dren who can hear. Visit the SMARTSign website at www.cc.gatech.
edu/content/smartsign-google-glass.
www.it-ebooks.info

11
 Chapter 1: The World Through Glass
	
✓	Field Trip: This app for Glass displays information about a nearby point 
of interest. If you’re near a landmark, you see information on your Glass 
about that landmark. You can also find out about destinations you’re 
thinking about visiting, such as a new restaurant in town. Yes, you can 
do the same things with your smartphone, but the process is more cum­
bersome than seeing the information about your landmark or destina­
tion as you’re looking at it in real time. You can get more information and 
activate the app at www.fieldtripper.com/glass.
	
✓	Question-Answer and Memento: Through its OpenGlass project, Dapper 
Vision has developed two apps to help the visually impaired and blind 
“see” what Google Glass is seeing. The Question-Answer app allows the 
user to take a picture of what his or her Glass is looking at and then 
sends the picture to a social networking site such as Twitter. When 
someone responds with a description of the picture, Glass reads that 
response to the user. The other app, Memento, allows a user to record 
voice commentary about a specific scene and then plays the commen­
tary when a visually impaired user wearing Glass visits the scene. You 
can get more information about these apps at www.openshades.com.
More Glass apps are being developed daily. You find out more about available 
Glass apps and shopping for apps in Chapter 12.
	
The catalog of apps is always changing. By the time you read this book, some 
of the apps we discuss may have different names; may have added or changed 
functionality; or may not be offered anymore, either because they weren’t suc­
cessful or were replaced by newer versions. Be sure to visit the apps’ websites 
and the MyGlass website (www.google.com/myglass). You find out more 
about MyGlass in Chapter 5.
What You Can Do with Glass
This section provides some examples of what you can do with Glass. Some of 
them are hypothetical, based on what Glass can do now; others are based on 
real-world experiences.
Manage air travel
A married couple walk through an airport. They don’t have to look at the 
television screens displaying flight information because they’re both wearing 
Glass, so they both get real-time flight updates on their Glass screens. When 
they eat at an ethnic restaurant in the airport, they look up ways to translate 
phrases such as good and thank you into the proprietor’s native language.
www.it-ebooks.info

12
Part I: Getting Started with Google Glass 
When the couple finish eating, they see a map of the airport on their Glass 
screens, showing them the correct boarding gate. During the flight home, the 
wife speaks a quick message to her mother about their time of arrival, and 
that message appears on her mother’s phone. The couple didn’t have to add 
anything to their devices to make all this work; all that functionality comes 
with each Glass out of the box.
Do your job more efficiently
You can use Google Glass to collaborate with other professionals and 
improve your job results, as follows:
	
✓	A surgeon at Ohio State University used the video features of Google 
Glass to show live knee surgery to other doctors connected through 
a Google Hangout. This approach provides an opportunity not only to 
teach, but also to collaborate live with other surgeons while a procedure 
is performed. In both cases, viewing doctors can see what’s happening 
just as the performing doctor sees it.
	
	Doctors can also use Glass to get updated information such as the latest 
CT (computed tomography) scan results, reports from specialists, and 
drug interactions.
	
✓	Mutualink (www.mutualink.net) has developed an app that allows 
public-safety personnel and first responders to use Glass to communi­
cate with colleagues, get information about patients, and keep abreast of 
emergency situations. Emergency medical technicians who use this app 
on Glass can get a list of allergies onscreen while keeping their hands 
free, as well as communicate with an emergency-room doctor before the 
patient arrives at the hospital.
	
✓	Fiberlink (www.maas360.com) has created mobility management 
software that helps information technology professionals find miss­
ing smartphones, police the company network, and change network 
user information from Glass. If you’re often on the go but need to keep 
tabs on a network, using Glass with Fiberlink software may be a good 
solution.
Get fit and get cooking
The LynxFit app (www.lynxfit.com) contains a wide variety of workouts 
(including yoga, CrossFit, running, and walking) so you can follow the work­
out regimen on your Google Glass screen as you exercise. What’s more, the 
app tracks your statistics as you exercise so you can see just how many calo­
ries you’re burning — and perhaps get motivated to work harder.
www.it-ebooks.info

13
 Chapter 1: The World Through Glass
If you like to cook but want to use both hands for cooking and/or don’t want 
to get your smartphone or tablet smudged with food stains, you can use 
the Allthecooks app (www.allthecooks.com). This app lists recipes with 
step-by-step instructions so you can cook delicious meals successfully. The 
instructions appear on the Glass screen, so you don’t have to wash your 
hands to consult a smartphone or tablet; as you complete each step, simply 
tell the Allthecooks app to proceed to the next one.
Meet people
You have a built-in conversation starter when you wear your Glass out in 
public. Glass gets attention wherever it goes, whether it’s at the mall, on 
the street, or in the store. Also, don’t be surprised if strangers want to try 
on your Glass. For more about how to handle questions and requests, see 
Chapter 7.
Is Glass the Most Exciting Thing Ever?
Glass is exciting because it’s the next step in the evolution of both comput­
ing and human communication. The amount of excitement you feel may vary, 
depending on what you use Glass for and perhaps depending on the reac­
tions you get from others. But Glass is only going to get better, because the 
device receives regular operating-system updates, and companies are con­
tinuously developing new apps for it.
With all this in mind, it’s time for you to begin your adventure with Glass by 
taking the device out of its box and setting it up as we show you in the next 
two chapters.
www.it-ebooks.info

Part I: Getting Started with Google Glass 
The downside of Glass
Like any piece of new technology, Glass has 
a few limitations. Here’s what we know at this 
writing:
	✓	Work in progress: Google calls Glass a 
ten-year commitment, stating that it’ll be 
ten years before the device gets to where 
Google wants it to be. The company is 
depending on users to provide feedback 
that will make Glass better, so there will 
be some fits and starts as Google tries to 
determine how best to balance Glass fea­
tures with users’ concerns. While this book 
was being written, for example, Google 
removed facial-recognition software from 
Glass because of privacy concerns.
	✓	For teenagers and adults only: Google rec­
ommends that children under 13 not use 
Glass, as it could harm developing vision.
	✓	A brief return period: You’re entitled to 
return your Glass if you decide that it isn’t 
for you. You should do that during the appli­
cable refund period, which is 30 days at 
this writing. Google may also charge you a 
restocking fee for your return.
	✓	A caveat if you had Lasik eye repair: For 
those of you who had Lasik surgery to 
repair your vision, get advice from your 
optometrist about using Glass.
	✓	Future ads: Google has patented a “pay-
per-gaze” advertising model that could 
bring advertising to Glass when the number 
of users reaches critical mass. It remains 
to be seen what form that advertising will 
take, but ads are likely to come to Glass 
sooner rather than later.
	✓	No support for forms: Glass doesn’t sup­
port the use of forms to sign in to websites. 
You can’t even use a different device to 
log in and then use the website on Glass. 
Therefore, if you plan to use a website that 
requires a login form, be sure to use that 
website on another device, such as a com­
puter, tablet, or smartphone.
	✓	No support for Adobe Flash: Flash videos 
won’t play in the Browser app (see 
Chapter 9), so you won’t be able to view a 
lot of videos on YouTube and other popu­
lar video-sharing websites. YouTube and 
similar websites are now using videos pro­
duced with HTML5, however, and you can 
view those videos on Glass without any 
trouble.
Some (or even all) of these problems may 
be resolved by the time you read this book. 
YouTube is owned by Google, for example, so 
it’s reasonable to assume that Google wants 
Glass users to be able to view videos on the 
device. Bookmark the Google Glass website 
(www.google.com/glass) on your Glass, 
and check it regularly to get the latest news 
and updates.

In order to change the world, you have to get your head together first.
— Jimi Hendrix
W

hen you finally have Google Glass in your hands, you’ll want to put it 
on your head right away. It’s an amazing feeling when you first look 
up and see a small screen that lights up and waits for your orders. You have 
two choices about what to do next: Look at the clock on the first screen, or 
start exploring what this device is capable of doing.
Although watching numbers change on the clock can be exciting, there’s 
something even more exciting to explore just above your line of sight: a com­
puter that performs almost every function you can imagine.
This chapter discusses how you can use Glass comfortably in your everyday 
activities and look good while wearing it.
Put Your Glass On
Before putting your Glass on your head, you should familiarize yourself with 
all the features that the device offers. We know that some of you are smart 
enough to figure things out on your own, but if you’re not a technical type, 
this section is for you. Here, we walk you through unboxing Glass, reviewing 
all the Glass features, and turning your device on for the first time.
www.it-ebooks.info

Part I: Getting Started with Google Glass 
Unboxing Glass
To use Glass, you have to take it out of its beautiful packaging so that you can 
get acquainted with everything that’s inside. You should find the following 
items inside the large box:
	
✓	Glass: Don’t be surprised if it’s not there anymore, because if you’re 
excited as we were when we first opened the box, you may already have 
the device on your head.
	
✓	Micro USB cable: You use this cable to connect your Glass to a computer 
or a wall charger.
	
✓	Wall charger: The charger is paired with the micro USB cable. We talk 
about charging later in this chapter.
	
✓	Pouch: The pouch serves to protect your Glass and its accessories. It’s a 
really nice gesture by Google to include a light, durable case that makes 
Glass safe.
	
✓	Earbud: An earbud is a miniature headphone that fits inside the ear. The 
earbud for Glass is attached to a piece of cardboard and placed inside 
the pouch. Place the earbud in your desired ear and then connect it to 
Glass by inserting its plug into the micro USB port, which is the same 
port you use to charge Glass.
	
✓	Additional nose pads: Everyone is unique, and these nose pads adapt to 
uniqueness. Try them all to see which pair fits you best.
	
✓	Q&A: Read this list of common questions and answers about Glass if 
you’re curious.
Your package should also include two smaller boxes. Google wants you to 
take your Glass outside, so the device comes includes a pair of eye-protecting 
lenses, called shields:
	
✓	Glass Shade: This tinted shield is Google’s replacement for your regular 
sunglasses, designed to deliver the best experience on sunny days. Now 
go play outside.
	
✓	Glass Shield: This clear shield offers great protection on windy days.
A case is included with the shields so you can store them while they’re not 
in use. You can change shields easily. Just put the shield you want to use 
between the nose-pad holders, and you’re set. For more about changing 
shields, see Chapter 11.
www.it-ebooks.info

 Chapter 2: Finally On Your Head
Getting to know your Glass
To start mastering something, you must understand the basics. Figure 2-1 
shows the basic key features of Glass:
	
✓	Display: The display shows you all the information that’s available on 
your Glass, including e-mails, pictures, videos, and any other content.
	
✓	Camera button: Press and release this button to take a photo. If you 
hold the button down, Glass starts to record a video. You can find more 
about taking photos and videos in Chapter 8.
	
✓	Touchpad: On the right side of Glass is a flat surface called the touchpad, 
which allows you to navigate among the screens you see in the display. 
Swipe forward and backward to navigate the Glass timeline, which dis­
plays your current and past activities, or swipe down to return to the 
previous screen.
	
	You can also start Google voice search, which allows you to search the 
web. Tap the touchpad three times slowly when the display is off, and 
speak your search terms into your Glass. If you’re at the Home screen, 
you can start voice search by saying “OK Glass, Google . . .” followed by 
your search term. Chapter 9 talks more about searching with Glass.
	
✓	USB/power connector: The USB/power connector is on the bottom of 
the Glass unit, near the end of the touchpad. Attach the USB cable to 
charge Glass, or attach the power connector to connect your Glass with 
your computer to exchange files.
	
✓	Power button: On the inner right side, near the end of the touchpad, is a 
button that turns your Glass on and off. Press the button to power your 
device on or shut it down.
	
✓	LED: The LED, located on the back of the touchpad, displays white light 
when Glass is charging, starting up, or shutting down. The LED also 
blinks slowly while you’re charging the device.
	
✓	Speaker: This oval speaker, engraved with the Glass logo, delivers all the 
sounds from the device.
	
✓	Battery: At the bottom-left side of the frame is the battery that powers 
your device. See the “Charging Glass” section later in this chapter to get 
more information about the health of the battery.
	
✓	Frame: The Glass frame is extremely durable and can be bent to fit any 
face. Try it.
	
✓	Nose pads: Those little things in the middle of the frame are there to 
keep your Glass from falling off your head. Feel free to adjust the pads to 
suit your needs. For more information, see “Fitting Your Glass” later in 
this chapter.

Turning Glass on and off
The first time you turn on a new device, you get a warm feeling that some­
thing new is happening and that you’re a part of it. So do this:
	
1.	Press the power button firmly.
	
	 The LED behind the button turns on and stays on while Glass starts up. 
After the device boots successfully, the display turns on (see Figure 2-2), 
and you hear a rising chime sound.
www.it-ebooks.info

Figure 2-2: 
The first 
screen you 
see after 
powering 
on.
	
	
2.	To turn off your Glass, press the power button until you hear a falling 
chime sound.
	
	 That’s it.
Whenever Glass is turned on, you can set either of these options at any time:
	
✓	Head Wake Up: This option is on by default. When you tilt your head up 
at a specified angle, your Glass turns the screen on and waits for your 
orders. For more on this feature, check out Chapter 6.
	
✓	On-Head Detection: This feature tells Glass whether or not you’re wear­
ing it. Glass turns off when you take it off your head so that nothing bad 
will happen if you accidentally tap the device while you’re giving it a 
break. For details on configuring On-Head Detection, see Chapter 6.
	
If your Glass isn’t responding to your commands, you can fully power it down 
(that is, perform a hard reset) and then restart it by holding the power button 
down for 15 seconds. After Glass shuts down, restart the device by pressing 
the power button again.
You may also see a low-battery warning — perhaps the most annoying mes­
sage of all on any battery-powered device. Until humans invent a power 
source that provides an infinite supply of energy, you’ll see a message similar 
to Figure 2-3 every time Glass gets hungry. When Glass runs out of battery 
power, it powers itself down automatically.
	
Fear not — this shutdown is normal behavior. Just connect your charger to 
Glass (see the next section). When the device has enough power, it turns on 
again automatically.

Charging Glass
Every device on this planet has to have energy to do its thing, and Glass is no 
exception. Fortunately, the kind people at Google made the charging process 
really easy for you. The box that Glass comes in (refer to “Unboxing Glass” 
earlier in this chapter) contains a funny-looking micro USB cable and a char­
ger. The charger and the cable plug are two-tone — black and white — so that 
you always know which way to plug the USB connector into the charger.
Glass comes from the factory partially charged so that you can start using 
it right away. Before using your Glass for the first time, however, you should 
charge it fully. (You don’t want to see a low-battery message while you’re in 
the middle of exploring your device.) Just follow these three simple steps:
	
1.	Connect the micro USB cable to the wall charger.
	
	 Take the narrow end of the cable and plug it into the wall charger.
	
2.	Connect the free end of the micro USB cable to your Glass.
	
	 Flip your Glass over and find the socket that matches the free end of the 
micro USB cable, above the power button. The white part of the micro 
USB cable should face the outside of the Glass device.
	
3.	Plug the wall charger into a wall socket.
	
	 When you’ve connected everything successfully, the LED near the power 
button starts blinking slowly, and the display shows an animated battery 
icon. You’re officially charging your Glass for the first time.
	
Another way to charge Glass is to connect it to your computer. The downside 
of this process is that it takes longer than the cable-and-wall-charger method.
www.it-ebooks.info

21
 Chapter 2: Finally On Your Head
	
You can use your Glass while the battery is getting its life back. The micro USB 
cable is designed so that it won’t be in your way while it’s connected to Glass.
If you’re charging while you’re within range of a Wi-Fi network that you’re 
already using for your Glass and any other Wi-Fi device (such as your smart­
phone), Glass automatically checks for software updates. It also synchronizes 
all the pictures and videos you’ve stored on it with your Google+ account so 
that you can share those photos and videos with your Google+ friends.
	
The Glass battery isn’t removable, so if the battery dies, the device isn’t useful 
anymore. The best thing to do in this case is contact your Glass Guide, who 
can help you get a replacement device. You can reach your Glass Guide by 
phone at (800) 452-7793 or by e-mail at glass-support@google.com. You 
find out more about Glass Guides in Chapter 17.
	
If you find that your battery isn’t staying charged very long, Glass Guides sug­
gest that you plug the device in for an hour and then unplug the device for an 
hour. You’ll perform this plug-and-unplug regimen 12 times within a 24-hour 
period. When you’re finished, use Glass as you normally would, and see 
whether it stays charged as long as you expect. If not, contact a Glass Guide 
(see the preceding paragraph).
Fitting Your Glass
You have two good reasons to read this section:
	
✓	You should feel comfortable while wearing your Glass.
	
✓	You’ll probably attract a lot of attention, so it’s important to look good.
The fitting process is simple, and if you fit the device on your head correctly, 
fitting should be a one-time event. The key to a comfortable Glass experience 
is making sure that the device isn’t in your way when you’re enjoying your 
everyday activities.
Here are a few pointers for wearing Glass comfortably and looking great while 
doing it:
	
✓	Position the display above your line of sight. The small cube that func­
tions as the display (refer to Figure 2-1 earlier in this chapter) should be 
located above your eye, not directly in front of it. Glass is designed to 
stay out of your way when it’s not needed.
www.it-ebooks.info

22
Part I: Getting Started with Google Glass 
	
✓	Adjust the display as needed. Move the display forward or backward 
until you’re able to see every corner of the screen clearly.
	
✓	Adjust the nose pads. Like every other pair of glasses you may have worn, 
Glass has to fit perfectly on your nose to work properly. The nose pads 
are adjustable, so do a little tweaking to get the best fit for your head.
	
It takes time to get used to wearing Glass, just as it does to get used to wearing 
a pair of new eyeglasses. Have fun exploring!

magine a life without settings. You can pick up any device that you want to 
use, and because it knows who you are, it adapts to you instantly.
Now return to the present day. You have your shiny new device in your hand 
(or, in this case, on your head), and you want to start using it immediately. 
First, though, you must make a bunch of settings to make it usable.
That process could be tricky, but fear not; this chapter shows you how everything 
works.
Completing the Google Glass Checklist
To keep your Glass connected to the Internet and/or to your Android smart­
phone, you need the following:
	
✓	Glass: Make sure that you have it charged up and ready to go (see 
Chapter 2). You don’t want to be surprised by news of an empty battery.
	
✓	Google account: A Google account is required to set up Glass. If you 
don’t already have a Google account, you can create one at http://
accounts.google.com.
www.it-ebooks.info

24
Part I: Getting Started with Google Glass 
	
	Your Google account should have Google+ and Gmail services enabled. 
These two services are required so that Glass can authenticate you and 
use Google+ features.
	
✓	Connection to the Internet: Internet connection is essential for Glass. 
Without it, Glass is just an expensive pair of glasses with a great camera.
	
✓	Computer with web browser: Your primary computer will do just fine, 
as long as it has a working Internet connection and a web browser.
	
✓	Smartphone or tablet with Bluetooth: A Bluetooth-enabled device 
allows you to use some of the phone features of your Glass, such as 
making phone calls, sending and receiving text messages, and getting 
directions to your next destination. You can also use your smartphone 
carrier’s data connection to connect your Glass to the Internet.
	
✓	MyGlass app: If you have an Android smartphone, you should install the 
MyGlass app to configure Google Glass.
	
Because Google produces both Glass and the Android operating system, it 
should come as no surprise that if you use Glass with an Android smartphone, 
you can take advantage of some features you can’t get when you use Glass 
with an iPhone. For that reason, we cover the Android process in this chapter. 
You find out more about downloading and using the MyGlass app in “Setup on 
an Android phone” later in this chapter.
Setting Up Your Glass in 
Many (OK, Two) Ways
When you put Glass on your head and power it on for the first time, you see 
the Glass logo screen, followed by a welcome screen. The welcome screen 
asks you to start the setup process by swiping forward on the touchpad.
After you swipe forward, you see a screen that says Great, which means that 
Glass acknowledges that you know how to swipe forward on the touchpad. 
Start the swiping tutorial process by swiping forward on the touchpad once 
more. Then follow these steps:
	
1.	Respond to the tutorial’s animation and onscreen request (Let’s 
practice swiping down) by swiping down on the touchpad.
	
	 A new screen says Perfect and asks you to swipe forward.
	
2.	Proceed to the next step by swiping forward on the touchpad.

Mastering the Basics
In This Chapter
▶	Navigating the Home screen
▶	Controlling Glass with your hands and voice
▶	Interacting with the timeline
▶	Managing Glass cards
Any fool can know. The point is to understand.
— Albert Einstein
T

he fun begins when you get Glass to do what you want, and we show you 
how in this chapter, starting with the basic gestures you need to make 
Glass go.
You also see how to navigate the timeline, which contains notifications about 
various activities. Your Glass notifies you about new activities as they occur, 
such as when you receive a new e-mail message.
Starting with the Home Screen
The Home screen, shown in Figure 4-1, is the first thing you see when you 
activate your Glass. To wake up Glass, tap the touchpad or lift your head up 
as though you’re looking at the moon. Your Glass display turns on, and you 
see a screen displaying the current time and the text "ok glass".
	
If you’re unsure where everything is on your Glass, see Chapter 2.
www.it-ebooks.info

38
Part II: Exploring Glass

The Home 
screen.
	
Using Your Hands to 
Control Your Glass
You must perform certain basic operations every time you wear your device. 
The learning curve isn’t flat, but it’s not as steep as you may think. All the 
basic gestures are done on the flat surface on the right side of the device, 
called the touchpad. Some of the gestures are similar to those used on all 
other touchscreen devices.
The following sections make you a master of swiping, tapping, and other cool 
gestures.
Swiping
When you swipe on your Glass, you’re moving objects on its screen. To 
swipe, just put your finger on the touchpad and drag it to another spot 
(see Figure 4-2).
You can swipe forward, backward, up, and down. As you swipe, objects 
on the screen move in the direction in which your finger is moving. If you 
want to scroll quickly through a long list of notifications, for example, 
swipe quickly on the touchpad. (We cover notifications, called cards, later 
in this chapter.)

Tapping
Tapping means placing your finger on the touchpad to confirm an action 
onscreen. Think of it as the equivalent of pressing the Enter key on your com­
puter keyboard or, if you prefer, tapping the Enter key on your smartphone or 
tablet.
If you use a smartphone, selecting or confirming items on the Glass screen 
comes naturally. All you have to do is tap the touchpad.
Dismissing an action
You can cancel an action by swiping your finger from the top of the touchpad 
to the bottom, as shown in Figure 4-3. Google calls this action the dismiss 
gesture. If you use the dismiss gesture while you’re on the Home screen, for 
example, Glass turns off the display.
	
Apply this gesture if you want to move back one step anywhere on the time­
line (see “Touring the Timeline” later in this chapter).
www.it-ebooks.info

Waking up Glass
If you don’t see anything on the Glass screen after you put the device on your 
head, and you’re sure that you’ve turned it on, your Glass is in sleep mode. 
There are two ways to wake Glass up and show information on its screen:
	
✓	Tap the touchpad.
	
✓	Tilt your head up.
	
If you don’t want to tilt your head up to wake up your Glass, you can change 
the wake-up setting so that you can wake Glass only by tapping the touchpad. 
For more information about changing settings, see Chapter 6.
Using Your Voice to Dictate to Your Glass
Though some teenagers may beg to differ, perhaps the most natural way to 
communicate with someone is to speak to him or her. Google designed Glass 
so you don’t have to use the touchpad if you don’t want to; you can just 
speak commands to your Glass.
When you start Glass and view the Home screen, the "ok glass" text is 
there to encourage you to speak “OK Glass” aloud. After you say “OK Glass,” 
the Glass microphone recognizes your command and opens a menu of voice-
command options (see Figure 4-4).
www.it-ebooks.info

41
 Chapter 4: Mastering the Basics
	
Figure 4-4: 
The voice-
commands 
menu.
	
You can move through the menu by tilting your head up and down. As you 
move your head, Glass moves the menu of voice commands to follow your 
head movement. When you’re ready, say “OK Glass” again and speak a com­
mand from the menu, and Glass responds.
Voice commands include the following:
	
✓	“Google”: Glass performs a Google search. You could say, for example, 
“OK Glass, Google current time in San Francisco.”
	
✓	“Take a picture”: Glass immediately takes a picture of what appears on 
its screen, adds the photo to a card, and places that card on the time­
line. This voice command may be the one you use most often. For more 
about taking pictures, see Chapter 8.
	
✓	“Record a video”: Glass records a ten-second video of what appears 
in front of the camera. You can extend that time by tapping the touch­
pad and then choosing Extend Video from the menu or by pressing the 
Camera button.
	
✓	“Get directions to. . .”: If you’re using your Glass with a smartphone 
that’s running the MyGlass app (see Chapter 5), you see turn-by-turn 
directions to your destination from your current location. Saying “OK 
Glass, get directions to San Francisco,” for example, returns a screen 
with directions to The City. Find out more about navigating to a desired 
location in Chapter 11.
	
✓	“Send a message to. . .”: If you’re using an Android smartphone with 
your Glass, this command sends an instant message to the phone 
number that’s associated with the name of the contact. (If you’re using 
an iPhone or a Wi-Fi connection, Glass sends an e-mail message instead.) 
www.it-ebooks.info

42
Part II: Exploring Glass 
Saying “OK Glass, send message to Jane Doe” opens a screen where you 
can speak the message that you want to send to Ms. Doe. We discuss 
sending instant messages from Glass in Chapter 10.
	
✓	“Make a call to. . .”: This command begins a call to the phone number 
that’s associated with the name of your contact. Saying “OK Glass, make 
a call to John Smith” calls the phone number that’s contained within 
John Smith’s contact record. For more about adding and managing your 
contacts, see Chapter 5; for details on making phone calls with Glass, 
see Chapter 10.
	
✓	“Make a video call to. . .”: This command lets you share what you’re 
seeing or doing with a contact who has a Google+ account. For more 
about making video calls, see Chapter 10.
We cover voice commands in greater detail in Chapter 8.
	
Voice recognition on Glass isn’t perfect (yet), so if your Glass can’t recognize 
what you’re saying, or if you’d rather not tilt your head up and down and 
speak the commands you see on the menu, tap the Home screen; swipe for­
ward and backward through the available menu options; and select an option 
by tapping the touchpad.
Touring the Timeline
When you wake up your Glass, you see the timeline screen. Notifications on 
this screen appear as rows of cards. Cards can contain text such as e-mail and 
instant messages, images, and/or videos. Figure 4-5 shows examples of cards 
on the timeline screen.
	
Figure 4-5: 
The timeline 
screen.
	
www.it-ebooks.info

43
 Chapter 4: Mastering the Basics
To the left of the Home screen (shown at center in Figure 4-5), you see an area 
including cards that contain current or future information, such as upcoming 
events on your calendar, as well as any pinned cards that you want to access 
quickly. (We discuss pinning cards later in this chapter.) To the right of the 
Home screen are cards that contain notifications you received in the past, 
such as e-mail messages.
When Glass adds a new card, that card appears as the first card on the Home 
screen; older cards move one place to the right. You can move through the 
row of cards by dragging your finger on the touchpad. You can view more 
information within a displayed card by tapping the touchpad.
Playing with Cards
You can move between cards on the timeline by using the touchpad and 
swiping forward and backward, as we discuss in the following sections.
Viewing current and upcoming events
View current and upcoming events in your calendar by swiping backward 
on the touchpad. These events appear on the timeline (refer to Figure 4-5). 
Figure 4-6 shows an example information card for an upcoming flight.

44
Part II: Exploring Glass 
Viewing recent events
Scroll through all timeline cards on the screen by swiping forward or back­
ward on the touchpad. Each card displays information about recent events, 
such as pictures taken, videos recorded, and messages sent — in other 
words, every activity that you’ve performed recently.
Figure 4-7 shows a card displaying the results of a recent Google search on 
the keywords time in San Francisco. You can find out more about doing a 
Google search in Chapter 9.
	
Figure 4-7: 
Results of 
a Google 
search.
	
Choosing commands for cards
When you tap any card on the timeline, a menu appears, displaying all the 
actions you can perform (see Figure 4-8). You can move between menu 
options by swiping forward and backward on the touchpad and then select 
an option by tapping the touchpad.
	
Figure 4-8: 
An example 
menu option 
for a card.
	
	
Menu options vary from card to card, and some cards may not have any menu 
options.
www.it-ebooks.info

45
 Chapter 4: Mastering the Basics
Here are some of the most common menu options for cards:
	
✓	Share: This command shares your picture or video with your contacts, 
your circles in Google+, and other social networks (such as Facebook) 
you’re using with Glass. Find out more about sharing pictures and 
videos in Chapter 8.
	
✓	Pin: This command pins the selected card to the timeline. We discuss 
pinning cards later in this chapter.
	
✓	Reply: This command replies to the selected message by transcribing 
your spoken message into text.
	
✓	Delete: The Delete command removes the selected card from the 
timeline.
	
✓	Call: This command is available only if your Glass is connected to your 
Android smartphone through a Bluetooth connection so that you can 
make phone calls.
	
✓	Read Aloud: When you choose this command, Glass reads the text on 
the card so that you can listen to its content on the speaker.
If you’d rather go back to the card without making any menu choices, close 
the menu by swiping down on the touchpad.
Working with bundled cards
Some cards have a folded top-right corner, which indicates that the card 
is bundled. A bundled card is a group of cards containing information that 
belongs together. A bundle might contain a card with the current temperature 
and another card with the extended forecast, for example (see Figure 4-9).
	
Figure 4-9: 
A bundled 
weather 
card.
	
www.it-ebooks.info

46
Part II: Exploring Glass 
When you tap a bundled card, you see the cards within the bundle. You can 
move between individual cards within the bundle by swiping forward or 
backward.
Receiving notifications
If your Glass is connected to the Internet through a Wi-Fi connection, it con­
tinually keeps track of your online activities (such as your e-mail account), 
and if something new happens, Glass adds a notification card to the timeline 
immediately.
When you receive a new notification, you hear a chime from the Glass 
speaker. You also see the new notification card, with the text Just Now in 
the bottom-right corner, as shown in Figure 4-10. This new card is displayed 
for five seconds after you hear the chime. When that period elapses, the noti­
fication appears on the timeline.
	
Figure 4-10: 
A new 
notification 
card.
	
Within that five-second window, you can view the entire notification card 
onscreen by tapping the touchpad or by tilting your head up. A notification 
card may also include menu options, such as one to delete the notification; 
you can access the menu while you’re viewing the entire card by tapping the 
touchpad.
	
To see missed notifications, swipe forward on the touchpad to see your recent 
notifications in the order in which they arrived.

▶	Adding and managing contacts
▶	Enabling a Wi-Fi network
▶	Tracking the current location of your Glass
▶	Enabling and disabling Glassware applications
Each day I live in a glass room unless I break it with the thrusting of my 
senses and pass through the splintered walls to the great landscape.
— Mervyn Peake
I

n this chapter, we introduce the MyGlass website, which you can access 
from your computer, tablet, or smartphone. MyGlass allows you to tweak 
your Glass settings so that the device works best for you.
If you want to add your Glass to another Wi-Fi network, such as a network 
offered by a hotel where you’re staying, you can do this with MyGlass. You 
can also locate a misplaced Glass with MyGlass so that you can get your 
device back in your hands as soon as possible.
In addition, you can use MyGlass to enable or disable Glassware, which is 
a Google term for web-based apps that can send data to and receive data 
from Glass, as well as apps that are written specifically to run on Glass. This 
enabling and disabling feature allows you to hide Glassware so that your 
Glass screen shows only the apps you want to use.

Taking the Red Carpet Tour of MyGlass
To tour MyGlass for the first time, fire up your favorite browser on your 
­computer, tablet, or smartphone and then follow these steps:
	
1.	In the browser address bar, type www.google.com/myglass and 
then tap or press Enter.
	
	 If you aren’t logged in to your Google account already, you see the 
Google login page so that you can log in to your Google account.
	
	 If you’re already logged in to Google, you may see a warning page similar 
to Figure 5-1. Don’t panic; this warning screen is a good thing. Google is 
making sure that you are who you say you are, because it doesn’t want 
an unauthorized user changing your Glass experience.
Figure 5-1: 
The

warning 
page.
	
2.	Tap or click the OK button and then type your Google e-mail address 
and password in the Accounts screen.
	
	 After you log in, the MyGlass home page appears, as shown in Figure 5-2. 
The home-page content is organized in a row of cards, just as in your 
Glass timeline, so you’ll feel right at home. A menu bar appears at the 
top of the home page, with menu options at the left end and your Google 
e-mail address and account photo at the right end.
	
3.	Do any of the following:
 
• Select Setup if you want to set up Glass for the first time or after 
you perform a factory reset.
 
• Select MyGlass or the Glass logo to return to the MyGlass home 
page.
 
• Select Glassware so you can shop for Glassware, add Glassware to 
your Glass, or remove Glassware from your Glass.

 Chapter 5: Enhancing Glass with the MyGlass Website
 
• Select Explorers to visit the Glass Community website at 
https://www.glass-community.com.
 
• Select Support to open a new tab in your browser and view the 
Glass support page.
 
• Select your Google e-mail address or account photo to view 
your Google account information, add an account, or sign out 
of MyGlass.
Managing Your Contact List
One of the cards on the MyGlass home page lets you add a contact (refer 
to Figure 5-2), because Google recognizes that you’ll often want to contact 
your friends via voice call, video call, or instant message. Google also knows 
that you’ll likely prefer telling your Glass to call people to fumbling for your 
smartphone.

Part II: Exploring Glass 
 
If you don’t have a Google Contacts database, you can set one up for free at 
www.google.com/contacts. You can access your contacts list from your 
favorite web browser, as well as synchronize your contacts with other pro­
grams and devices.
To make your life even easier, Google allows you to import contacts from 
your Google Contacts database to your Glass by using the MyGlass website 
or the MyGlass app on your smartphone. When you initiate a voice call, video 
call, or instant message, your Glass shows a list of your contacts so you can 
scroll to and select the desired contact.
 
You can access your imported contacts from the Google Contacts database 
only by using the touchpad; you can’t use the voice feature. That is, when you 
send a message, you need to scroll through the contact list by swiping back­
ward and forward on the touchpad. When you find the contact you want, tap 
the touchpad.
	
Unfortunately, at this writing, MyGlass can store no more than ten contacts 
that you add within Glass. If your MyGlass contact database is full and you 
want to add another contact, you have to remove an existing contact first.
Importing a contact
To import an existing contact from your Google Contacts database to 
MyGlass, follow these steps:
	
1.	On the MyGlass website, tap or click the Add a Contact card 
(see Figure 5-3).

Viewing a contact card
A contact card (see Figure 5-7) displays the same information on the MyGlass 
website and in the MyGlass app: the contact’s name, a photo of the contact 
(if any), and icons in the top-left corner that show what type of information 
the card contains.
	
Figure 5-7: 
Example 
contact 
card.
	
In Figure 5-7, the envelope icon indicates that the contact has an e-mail 
address, and the telephone-receiver icon shows that the contact has a phone 
number.
You can get more information about the contact by tapping the contact card. 
If the contact has more than one e-mail address and/or more than one phone 
number, a blue check box appears to the right of the contact’s preferred 
e-mail address and/or phone number, as shown in Figure 5-8.

its database.
	
Removing a contact removes it only from MyGlass. The contact remains safely 
stored in Google Contacts.
Merging contacts
Synchronizing your Google Contacts database with Glass can take a while if 
your database has multiple contacts for several people. Fortunately, Google 
Contacts makes it easy to clean up your database by merging information in 
all contacts that have the same name. To merge contacts, follow these steps:

Part II: Exploring Glass 
Adding a Wi-Fi Network by Using 
the MyGlass Web App
When you’re out and about, you won’t have access to the Wi-Fi network 
that you use on a regular basis in your home or office. If you’re going to be 
using a Wi-Fi network in your office, at a hotel, or even at your favorite coffee 
shop, you can add a new Wi-Fi network for your current location within the 
MyGlass website (www.google.com/myglass) and save it the next time 
you’re there.
You’ll find two types of Wi-Fi networks:
	
✓	Open: An open network allows anyone to use your Wi-Fi connection 
because it isn’t secured with a password.
	
✓	Protected: A protected network requires authentication to gain access 
to network resources. To use and connect to a protected Wi-Fi network, 
you need three things: a network name, an encryption method, and the 
network password.
MyGlass makes it easy for you to set up a new Wi-Fi network that you can 
store on your Glass so you can connect to the network easily when you’re in 
range of that network.
Generating a QR code
The first step in connecting to a Wi-Fi network in MyGlass is generating a QR 
(Quick Response) code for that network. You can create a QR code for two 
types of Wi-Fi networks: an open network, which doesn’t require a password, 
and an encrypted (or hidden) network, which requires a password. (For more 
on QR codes, see Chapter 3.)
For an open network
If you’re at a location that offers public Wi-Fi, such as a coffee shop or an air­
port, here’s how to create a QR code for that public network:
	
1.	Tap or click the My Wifi Networks card on the home page (see 
Figure 5-10).
	
	 The Add Network card appears so that you can add information about 
your Wi-Fi network.
www.it-ebooks.info

59
 Chapter 5: Enhancing Glass with the MyGlass Website
	
Figure 5-10: 
The My Wifi 
Networks 
card.
	
	
2.	Type your wireless network name in the Enter Network Name field.
	
3.	Type the password (if one is required) in the Click to Enter Password 
field.
	
	 Passwords are case-sensitive.
	
4.	Tap or click Generate Code (see Figure 5-11).
	
	 This link is active only when you’ve entered all the information for your 
Wi-Fi network. If the link is disabled, check your settings to ensure that 
you named your network properly, selected the correct encryption 
method, and entered a password if necessary.
 
 After you select Generate Code, a QR code appears onscreen. This code 
allows you to add the Wi-Fi network, which we discuss in “Adding the 
network to your Glass” later in this chapter.

For a hidden network
To create a QR code for a hidden network, follow these steps:
	
1.	Tap or click the My Wifi Networks card on the home page (refer to 
Figure 5-10).
	
	 The Add Network card appears (refer to Figure 5-11).
	
2.	At the bottom of the card, tap or click the Encryption Type text link.
	
3.	Type your wireless network name in the MyWifiNetwork field.
	
4.	Type the password in the password field.
	
	 Note that passwords are case-sensitive.
	
5.	Select the Wi-Fi encryption method by tapping or clicking the WPA/
WPA2 button.
	
	 You see three encryption options in the drop-down menu: None, WPA/
WPA2, and WEB (see Figure 5-12).
	
Figure 5-12: 
Choose an 
encryption 
option.
	
	
6.	Select the appropriate encryption method.
	
	 If you don’t know which encryption method the network uses and/or the 
network password, consult the staff of the location that offers the Wi-Fi 
service.
	
7.	Tap or click Generate Code.
	
	 This link is active only when you’ve entered all the information for your 
Wi-Fi network. If the link is disabled, check your settings to ensure that 
you named your network properly, selected the correct encryption 
method, and entered a password (if necessary).
 
 After you select Generate Code, a QR code appears onscreen, as shown 
in Figure 5-13. This code allows you to add the Wi-Fi network, which we 
discuss in the next section.

Tracking Down Your Glass
The MyGlass app for your Android smartphone includes the nifty Device 
Location card, which helps you locate your Glass as quickly as possible in 
case you misplace it.
www.it-ebooks.info

64
Part II: Exploring Glass 
	
The Device Location card works if your Glass has a Wi-Fi connection or is 
paired with a smartphone that has the MyGlass app installed on it. If you 
haven’t done so yet, find out how to pair your Glass and your smartphone in 
Chapter 3.
The Device Location card in MyGlass (see Figure 5-19) shows you the cur­
rent location of your Glass. It also shows the last time MyGlass checked your 
smartphone to get the location of your Glass.
	
Figure 5-19: 
The Device 
Location 
card.
	
To view a map showing the device’s current location, click or tap the card. 
A map displays the pinned location of your Glass device, as shown in 
Figure 5-20. Unfortunately, this display is as close as MyGlass can get to find­
ing your Glass, but it should give you enough information to search the area 
or call the authorities.

Enabling or Disabling Glassware
Glassware apps can send content to and receive content from your Glass. 
Some Glassware apps are preinstalled. You can use MyGlass to shop for more 
Glassware and to customize the apps on your Glass by tapping the Glassware 
menu option at the top of the MyGlass home page.
 
See Chapter 12 for a complete discussion of preinstalled and third-party 
Glassware apps.
A list of Glassware apps appears on the MyGlass home page. Each Glassware 
app card contains the name of the app, a brief description, and an On/Off 
slider button (see Figure 5-21).

 lass is a remarkably flexible system that allows you to obtain and 
change information and connections to fit your needs. You may find 
yourself at a coffee shop that offers a free Wi-Fi connection (and what self-
respecting coffee shop doesn’t?), but you need to set up a new connection on 
your Glass. What do you do?
It’s easy to access a list of Settings cards from the Home screen and then set 
up your Wi-Fi connection. But setting up Wi-Fi connections is just one of the 
things you can do on Glass. You can also
	
✓	Set up a connection with a Bluetooth device such as your smartphone
	
✓	Tell Glass how it should wake up when you tilt your head
	
✓	Get information about the device, such as how much memory is 
­available for storing photos, videos, and timeline items
	
✓	Change the volume settings of the speaker so your ear and brain are 
comfortable
www.it-ebooks.info

68
Part II: Exploring Glass 
In case Glass is having trouble operating correctly and you suspect that an 
app is to blame, you don’t break Glass the way you break glass when you 
want to get a fire extinguisher or fire hose. Instead, you can reset your Glass 
to its original factory settings — the ones it had when you first took it out of 
the box. Then you can start running Glass again and see whether the trouble 
continues.
Finding the Settings Bundle
You can find the Settings bundle by swiping backward on the touchpad until 
you see the bundle, as shown in Figure 6-1.
	
Figure 6-1: 
A Glass 
Settings 
card bundle.
	
	
You can tell that you’re looking at a bundle because the top-right corner of 
the card contains a white right triangle and the card itself displays the battery 
status.
When you tap the Settings card bundle, you see several individual settings 
cards:
	
✓	Wifi: The Wifi Settings card shows the status of your Wi-Fi network 
­connection. (See “Doing the Old Join and Switch” later in this chapter.)
	
✓	Bluetooth: The Bluetooth Settings card shows the status of the active 
connection with a Bluetooth device. (See “Pairing with Bluetooth 
Devices” later in this chapter.)
	
✓	Device Info: The Device Info Settings card gives you vital information 
about your Glass, including storage and operating system. (See “Seeing 
What’s Going On” later in this chapter.)
www.it-ebooks.info

69
 Chapter 6: Managing Glass Settings
	
✓	Head Wake Up: The Head Wake Up Settings card allows you to set the 
angle at which you need to tilt your head to turn on the screen. (See 
“Using Settings That Use Your Head” later in this chapter.)
	
✓	On-Head Detection: The On-Head Detection Settings card turns Glass on 
as soon as you put it on your head. (See “Using Settings That Use Your 
Head” later in this chapter.)
	
✓	Screen Lock: The Screen Lock Settings card allows you to set a pattern-
based password and lock the screen whenever you take Glass off your 
head or deactivate the device. When you put Glass back on your head 
or activate it, you need to enter the pattern on your touchpad to access 
screens and functions. (For details on setting Screen Lock, see this 
book’s Web Extras at www.dummies.com/extras/googleglass.)
	
✓	Wink: The Wink Settings card allows you to activate the Wink fea­
ture, which lets you take a photo by winking your right eye — even if 
the Glass display is off. (To find out more about setting up Wink, see 
Chapter 8.)
	
✓	Volume: The Volume card shows the current volume level of your 
speaker as a percentage. (See “Getting the Volume Just Right” later in 
this chapter.)
We cover battery charge in Chapter 2. For details about tweaking your Glass 
by using settings cards, read on.
Seeing What’s Going On
When you’re in the Glass Settings screen, you can get more information about 
the device by tapping the Settings card bundle and then tapping the Device 
Info card, shown in Figure 6-2.

Part II: Exploring Glass 
Storage
Glass contains 16GB of storage space, 12GB of which is allocated for pictures, 
video, and other timeline attachments. If you have a Google+ account, your 
photos and video are automatically synced with your Google+ Auto Backup 
folder (see Chapter 8).
	
You can get more information about the Google+ Auto Backup folder, 
including how to turn the folder on and off and how many files you can 
back up to the folder, at https://support.google.com/plus/
answer/1647509?hl=en.
Operating system
The bottom of the Device Info card shows the current version of the Glass 
operating system that’s running. It also indicates whether an operating-
system update is available. The next time you plug Glass into the charger, it 
downloads and installs any operating-system update, even if you don’t check 
to see whether an update is available.
	
All Glass updates are downloaded through your Wi-Fi connection automati­
cally, but the device has to be connected to the Internet for that to happen.
Getting the Volume Just Right
By default, speaker volume on your Glass is set to 100 percent. Because Glass 
makes sounds the first time you turn it on, you’ll know whether this speaker 
setting is too loud or just right.
Changing the default volume setting is easy. Just tap the Settings card 
bundle; tap the Volume Settings card, shown in Figure 6-3; and then slide 
your finger forward and backward on the touchpad to move the onscreen 
volume slider.
When you release your finger, the slider disappears, and the speaker chimes 
so that you can determine whether the new volume is right. If you need 
to adjust the volume more, tap the Volume Settings card again and reset 
the slider.

Doing the Old Join and Switch
Many coffee shops, restaurants, and other businesses have free Wi-Fi net­
works available to persuade customers to stay a while, perhaps buy more 
products or services, and attract other customers to meet you at that loca­
tion (and, of course, buy things themselves).
Glass automatically detects Wi-Fi networks in your immediate area so that 
you can join one of them. Then you can browse the Internet, check your 
e-mail, and browse your social networking profiles without having to look at 
your smartphone screen or bring a laptop with you.
Joining a network
If you’re at a location that offers public Wi-Fi service, such as at a coffee shop 
or airport, your Glass finds all public Wi-Fi connections near you. These con­
nections don’t require a password for you to access their networks.
Here’s how to join a public Wi-Fi connection that your Glass finds:
	
1.	Swipe backward on the touchpad until you see the Settings card 
bundle (refer to Figure 6-1).
	
2.	Tap the Settings card bundle.
	
	 The Wifi Settings card appears, as shown in Figure 6-4.
www.it-ebooks.info

72
Part II: Exploring Glass 
	
Figure 6-4: 
The Wifi 
Settings

3.	Tap the Wifi Settings card to view all available Wi-Fi network connec­
tions near you.
	
4.	Swipe forward on the touchpad until you see the network you want to 
join.
	
5.	Tap the touchpad and wait for Glass to connect you to the network.
	
Another way to join a Wi-Fi network is to use a QR code in MyGlass — a 
requirement if you want to join a secured Wi-Fi network that requires a 
­password. See Chapter 5 for details.
Switching networks
When you leave your favorite Wi-Fi hotspot to go to another location, such as 
your home network, it’s easy to switch to that network on your Glass. Follow 
these steps:
	
1.	Tap the Settings card bundle.
	
2.	Tap the Wifi Settings card.
	
3.	Tap Switch Network in the resulting menu.
	
	 You see a list of the networks that Glass has detected.
	
4.	Tap the name of the network you want to join.
	
	 Glass automatically disconnects you from the active open network and 
switches you to your selected network.
www.it-ebooks.info

73
 Chapter 6: Managing Glass Settings
	
If you’ve already added details about a Wi-Fi network on the MyGlass website 
or on the MyGlass app for smartphones, you can switch to that Wi-Fi network 
without having to set up any other information. If you don’t have informa­
tion about the Wi-Fi network that Glass found, you need to set up the Wi-Fi 
connection.
Disconnecting from a network
What do you do if you don’t want to be connected to a wireless network any­
more? Tell Glass to forget the network by tapping the network’s name in the 
Wi-Fi connection card and then tapping Forget on the resulting menu. When 
you forget a network, Glass disconnects you from the Wi-Fi connection. It also 
removes this connection from memory, so if you want to connect to the net­
work again later, you have to join the network again.
Pairing with Bluetooth Devices
To check the current Bluetooth status of your Glass, tap the Settings bundle 
card and then tap the Bluetooth Settings card, shown in Figure 6-5.
	
Figure 6-5: 
The 
Bluetooth 
Settings 
card.

74
Part II: Exploring Glass 
Bluetooth connections require each device to be discoverable. In the case of 
Google Glass, you have to tell your smartphone that you want to pair it with 
your Glass. To see how this process works, connect (pair) your smartphone 
and your Glass via Bluetooth by following these steps:
	
1.	Open the Bluetooth Settings screen on your smartphone.
	
2.	On your Glass, tap the Settings card bundle and then tap the 
Bluetooth Settings card.
	
3.	On your smartphone, select Search for Devices.
	
4.	When the smartphone finds the device, tap Glass Device in the list of 
available devices.
	
	 On your smartphone’s screen, you see the Bluetooth Pairing Request 
window (see Figure 6-6), which includes a passkey. On the screen of your 
Glass, you see a card with the same passkey.
	
Figure 6-6: 
The 
Bluetooth 
Pairing 
Request 
window.
	
	
5.	Make sure that the passkeys on your Glass and your smartphone 
match.
www.it-ebooks.info

75
 Chapter 6: Managing Glass Settings
	
	 If the passkeys don’t match, you should contact your smartphone manu­
facturer and/or a Glass Guide for more assistance. You can find out more 
about Glass Guides and getting help in Chapter 17.
	
6.	Pair the devices by tapping the Pair button on your smartphone and 
then tapping the touchpad on your Glass.
	
	 Glass displays a card stating that pairing was successful. After a few 
seconds, Glass returns you to the Bluetooth Settings card, which looks 
similar to Figure 6-7.
	
Figure 6-7:

More Bluetooth fun
Even if your Glass isn’t paired with a Bluetooth 
device, the Bluetooth Settings card lets you do 
three things:
	✓	Use your Glass as a Bluetooth headset. If 
you want to use your Glass as a headset to 
talk on the phone with friends, you can do 
that by setting up a Bluetooth connection 
between your Glass and your smartphone.
	✓	Use a Bluetooth data connection. Glass 
constantly searches for Bluetooth devices 
to which it can connect. If you’ve paired 
Glass with your smartphone, you can 
­connect to the Internet on your Glass by 
using your smartphone’s data connection.
	✓	Check the status of your MyGlass app. If 
you have the MyGlass app installed, the 
Bluetooth Settings card shows whether 
your connection to the app is active.

Part II: Exploring Glass 
Using Settings That Use Your Head
You have three ways to turn on the display:
	
✓	Tap the touchpad.
	
✓	Use the Head Wake Up feature.
	
✓	Use On-Head Detection.
In this section, we discuss how to configure the ones that use your head.
Configuring Head Wake Up
Head Wake Up lets you turn on the display by tilting your head up instead 
of tapping the touchpad. To access this feature’s settings, tap the Settings 
card bundle and then tap the Head Wake Up Settings card (see Figure 6-8). 
This card shows whether the feature is enabled and also shows its wake 
angle — the angle at which you need to tilt your head to wake the device.
	
Figure 6-8: 
Head Wake 
Up Settings 
card.
	
By default, the wake angle is 30 degrees. Fortunately, Google recognizes that 
you may not find this setting comfortable, especially if you tilt your head 
often. You can change the default wake angle, as follows:
	
1.	Tap the Settings card bundle and then tap the Head Wake Up 
Settings card.
	
2.	When the menu appears, swipe forward to find and tap Set Wake 
Angle.

Configuring On-Head Detection
Instead of having to remember to press the power button to turn Glass on or 
off, you can enable On-Head Detection instead. This feature activates Glass 
when it’s on your head and deactivates it when the device isn’t on your head. 
When Glass is off, the device is still powered on, but its touchpad, display, 
and audio are off, and it won’t pick up any incoming phone calls.
To configure the On-Head Detection feature, follow these steps:
	
1.	Tap the Settings card bundle and then tap the On-Head Detection 
Settings card (see Figure 6-10).
	
2.	Tap Calibrate on the resulting menu.
	
3.	When your Glass prompts you to do so, take it off for a few seconds.
	
	 As you take the device off, the speaker plays a descending chime.
	
4.	Put Glass back on your head and then tap the touchpad.
	
	 When you put the device on your head again, the speaker plays a rising 
chime, and you can interact with your Glass again.
	
If you find that On-Head Detection isn’t working as well as you’d like, tap the 
On-Head Detection Settings card to turn off this feature. Then recalibrate 
On-Head Detection by following the steps in this section.

Resetting Glass
Glass is a computer, and like all computers, it may not always run as well as 
it should, or an app may not function properly. In such cases, you may want 
to reset your Glass. When you reset Glass, all data on it is deleted, and all the 
settings that came on it when it left the factory are restored, so the device is 
just like new.
	
Be careful when you reset Glass, because when you do, you’ll lose that data 
forever — with the exception of any data that you downloaded to Glass from 
your Google+ Auto Backup folder (see “Storage” earlier in this chapter). As 
you do with any computer, make sure that the important data on your Glass is 
stored elsewhere (such as your Google+ Auto Backup folder) before you reset 
the device.
If you need to reset Glass to its original factory settings, tap the Settings card 
bundle, tap the Device Info Settings card, and then choose Factory Reset 
from the menu shown in Figure 6-11.

 Chapter 6: Managing Glass Settings
Glass asks you to confirm that you want to reset it, as shown in Figure 6-12. 
Begin the reset process by tapping the touchpad. If you want to abort the 
process and return to the Device Info Settings card, swipe down on the 
touchpad.

Using Glass Responsibly
In This Chapter
▶	What to capture on Glass
▶	What to share from Glass
▶	How to use your Glass politely
You must take personal responsibility. You cannot change the circumstances, 
the seasons, or the wind, but you can change yourself. That is something you 
have charge of.
— Jim Rohn
W

hen Google Glass was introduced in spring 2013, numerous web 
articles appeared to tell you — and, presumably, the Google Glass 
Explorers who were testing it — all about Google Glass etiquette. In your 
favorite search engine, just search for google glass etiquette to see the list 
for yourself.
But there’s no need to stress; getting inside information like this is why 
you’re reading this book. In this chapter, we list some of the ways you should 
and shouldn’t use your Glass.
	
For more advice about what not to do, see Chapter 19.
There’s a Computer on Your Head
Wearing a Glass in everyday life can create some unintended consequences. 
One shining example occurred in late October 2013, when a driver in California 
was cited for wearing her Google Glass while driving (see Figure 7-1). According 
to the citation, she was violating a state law that requires people not to drive 
www.it-ebooks.info

82
Part II: Exploring Glass 
a vehicle equipped with a monitor unless it displays “global mapping dis­
plays, external media player (MP3), or satellite radio information.” The driver 
fought the ticket, however, because she didn’t have her Glass turned on at 
the time, and the officer couldn’t prove otherwise.
	
Figure 7-1: 
Driving with 
Glass.
	
In early 2014, a judge in traffic court agreed with the driver. The charges 
were thrown out because there was no evidence beyond a reasonable doubt 
that her Glass was turned on at the time. Though this episode had a happy 
ending, it also illustrates the brave new world that we’re entering with wear­
able computers and acts as a reminder that (as with any piece of technology) 
a set of unwritten etiquette rules comes with your Glass.
There’s a Camera on Your Head
Sometimes, it’s hard to remember that you have your Glass on your head 
because it’s so light and unobtrusive, which may be why the driver who 
was cited for wearing her Glass (see the preceding section) didn’t even think 
about removing it. The people you interact with, however, may behave a bit 
oddly toward you. That behavior may be caused by your inability to main­
tain eye contact with them because you’re too busy looking at the screen or 
moving your head up to activate your Glass.
Also, people may not be sure that you’re not taking photos or recording 
video surreptitiously. Experienced users can tell when you’re taking a photo 
or video (the Glass screen lights up, and you have to speak a command or 
push a button), but not everyone is familiar enough with this new technology 
to recognize these signs.
www.it-ebooks.info

83
 Chapter 7: Using Glass Responsibly
	
When you’re talking with people, it’s a good idea to take your Glass off your 
head. That way, they’ll know that you’re giving them your full attention and 
that you’re not secretly recording the conversation.
Ask permission before recording
You can’t control what photos and videos other people take on Glass, and the 
general rule applies that a few bad apples can spoil things for everyone else. 
By the time you read this book, those bad apples may have already made it 
difficult for everyone else to take photos and videos on Glass without arous­
ing suspicion.
You can go a long way toward alleviating that suspicion by always asking per­
mission before taking photos and videos of anyone — or of any business, or 
of anyone’s pets or children.
Share responsibly
This guideline was illustrated expertly by popular tech blogger Robert Scoble, 
an early tester and proponent of Glass who showed his enthusiasm by taking 
a picture of himself with his Glass on his head. . .as he was taking a shower.
Though Scoble was discreet, the photo didn’t exactly kindle enthusiasm 
among potential users. Instead, people (especially those in the media) took 
note that Glass doesn’t tell people other than the wearer that the camera is 
on, so it could encourage all sorts of mischief.
Make Miss Manners proud: Immediately share your photos and videos with 
the person who gave you permission to take them (see the preceding sec­
tion) and then ask whether it’s all right to share them with anyone else. If 
not, don’t post those items on the web. Instead, take a minute to delete the 
photos from your Glass and any other file-storage services you use, such as 
your Google+ backup folder.
Don’t Be a Showoff
You may have already been annoyed by someone who talks loudly on his 
smartphone in a public place. You’ll be the person people love to hate if you 
make phone calls on your Glass, start speaking commands to it, or dictate 
e-mail messages to it in public. Don’t show off with Glass, either intentionally 
or unintentionally.
www.it-ebooks.info

84
Part II: Exploring Glass 
	
One way to avoid being a showoff is to avoid wearing your Glass to a party or 
other social gathering. It’s nice to be able to check a person’s name and inter­
ests before you talk to her, but she may be uncomfortable when you recite all 
her interests instead of asking her for that information.
	
Also, don’t use Glass to correct someone else’s grammar or to try to show that 
you’re superior to them because you have the coolest technology. If you do, 
don’t be surprised to find people avoiding you. (If you’re surprised or if you 
feel the need to feel superior, we can’t help you.)
Be a Glass Ambassador
When you wear your Glass, people are going to ask you about the device and 
what it can do. They may simply be curious, or they may be afraid that you’re 
going to do something nefarious with your Glass.
So be gracious. Answer all questions as completely as you can, and if you 
can’t find the answers, ask the other person for his preferred contact infor­
mation so you can send him the answers when you find them.
Know That Wearing Glass Is a Privilege
Use Glass wisely, because courtesy matters. If you fret that courtesy isn’t 
part of society anymore, here’s your chance to be a rebel.
If you want to see what could happen if you don’t use your Glass wisely, the 
Mashable website offers a helpful, amusing video at http://mashable.
com/2013/05/16/google-glass-glasshole. A bonus video on that page 
shows you how New Yorkers react to a person wearing Glass, which gives 
you a good idea of the reactions you can expect when you wear your own 
Glass in public.

Making Your Memories
In This Chapter
▶	Taking pictures with the touchscreen and your voice
▶	Recording and playing videos
▶	Sharing and captioning your media
▶	Backing up your media to other devices
What I like about photographs is that they capture a moment that’s gone 
forever, impossible to reproduce.
— Karl Lagerfeld
G

  oogle Glass was made for taking pictures and videos. The device is 
equipped with a 5-megapixel camera and lots of operating-system bells 
and whistles designed to give you the best results from your pictures or 
videos. The camera, for example, uses high dynamic range (HDR) imaging 
technology to detect low-light environments and adjusts automatically to 
capture brighter, sharper pictures even when the subjects are moving.
Instead of fumbling for your smartphone and then launching a camera app, 
you can take pictures and videos with your Glass by speaking a few words 
or even blinking your eyes — especially convenient when you can’t use your 
hands, such as while riding your bike.
The real power of capturing media on your Glass, however, is in using the 
Google+ service to add captions to your pictures and videos, share them with 
friends, and back up your files from your Android or iOS smartphone. We 
show you how to do all that in this chapter.
Snapping Pictures
When Glass takes a picture, it captures an image based on what you’re 
­currently looking at. Glass gives you three ways to take a picture:
www.it-ebooks.info

88
Part III: It Can Do That? 
	
✓	At the Home screen, say “OK Glass, take a picture.”
	
✓	Press the Camera button in the top-right corner of the Glass frame, 
above your right eye. (You can use this button to take a picture even 
when the Glass display is off.)
	
✓	When the Wink feature is on, you can take a picture by winking your 
right eye.
	
✓	At the Home screen, tap the touchpad and then choose Take Picture 
from the menu shown in Figure 8-1.
	
Figure 8-1: 
Choose 
Take Picture 
from this 
menu.
	
After your Glass takes the picture, you see a preview onscreen, as shown in 
Figure 8-2. You can share the picture from the screen by tapping the touch­
pad or by saying “OK Glass, share with. . .” followed by the name of the con­
tact or Google+ circle you want to share the picture with. (You can also share 
it with a Facebook friend if you have the Facebook Glass app installed.) We 
discuss sharing in more detail later in this chapter.

89
 Chapter 8: Making Your Memories
To view the picture in your timeline, swipe forward on the touchpad at the 
Home screen. Tap the touchpad again to share or delete the picture from 
your timeline. You can also find the picture in your Auto Backup album on 
Google+ after Glass has a chance to sync your pictures (see “Backing Up Your 
Media to Google+” later in this chapter).
Winking to take a picture
Your Glass detects a wink, and the Wink feature makes good use of this eye-
blinking capability so you can take a picture just by winking your right eye.
	
You should always let people know that you’re going to take a picture of them 
by winking before you do so. Otherwise, those who think you’re winking at 
them may let you know that they don’t appreciate it.
Before you can wink to take a picture, you need to activate the Wink feature, 
like so:
	
1.	On the timeline screen, tap the Settings card.
	
2.	Tap the Wink Settings card.
	
3.	When you’re prompted to do so, look at the screen and wink twice so 
that Glass can calibrate the feature correctly.
Now that you have the Wink feature enabled, you can use it whether the 
Glass screen is on or off. You can check whether Wink is on by looking at the 
Wink Settings card (see Figure 8-3). If you don’t want to use the Wink feature, 
deactivate it by following Steps 1 and 2 above and then choosing Disable on 
the Wink screen.

Part III: It Can Do That? 
Evoking a vignette
In Glass parlance, a vignette superimposes Glass features on your screen over 
the picture you’ve just taken. This feature is a neat little way to share your 
experience of taking pictures on Glass. Here’s how to make a vignette:
	
1.	Make sure that the screen displays the feature (such as the weather 
forecast) you want to use.
	
2.	Take the picture by pressing the Camera button.
	
3.	Tap the touchpad and then choose Make Vignette from the menu.
	
	 The vignette appears onscreen (see Figure 8-4). If you want to see more 
menu options (such as one that lets you share the vignette with some­
one else), say “OK Glass” or tap the touchpad and then choose the 
desired option from the menu.
	
Figure 8-4: 
A Glass 
vignette.
	
Capturing Videos
Like the cameras on most smartphones sold today, the camera on your Glass 
allows you to take videos. Capturing videos with your Glass is similar to 
taking pictures. You have a choice of three ways to start recording:
	
✓	At the Home screen, say “OK Glass, record a video.”
	
✓	Press and hold the Camera button for 1 second. (This button is in the 
top- right corner of the Glass frame, above your right eye.)
	
✓	At the Home screen, tap the touchpad and then choose Record Video 
from the menu (see Figure 8-5).
www.it-ebooks.info

91
 Chapter 8: Making Your Memories
	
Figure 8-5: 
Choose this 
command 
to record a 
video.
	
While Glass is recording your video, you see that video on your display, as 
well as a time counter. By default, Glass records video clips for 10 seconds 
and then stops recording automatically, but you can extend recording time, 
as we discuss in the next section.
	
When you finish recording your video, it appears as a card on your timeline, 
and it also appears in your Auto Backup album on Google+. (For more on Auto 
Backup, see “Backing Up Your Media to Google+” later in this chapter.)
Extending a recording
The reason for the “10-second rule” for video recording on Glass is that 
Google thinks you’ll want to take brief videos and share them immediately. 
Recording videos longer than 10 seconds is both possible and easy, though.
	
Recording requires a lot of processing power. As a result, the longer you 
record a video, the hotter the Glass device gets. If your Glass gets too hot, it 
may become too uncomfortable for you to wear and may also start to behave 
erratically. Keep a close eye (pun unintended) on the temperature of your 
Glass, and stop recording when it heats up (see “Stopping a recording” later in 
this chapter).
You have two ways to extend a recording:
	
✓	While the video is recording (see Figure 8-6), press the Camera button.
	
✓	Tap the touchpad and then choose Extend Video from the menu that 
appears.
www.it-ebooks.info

92
Part III: It Can Do That? 
	
	 The progress bar at the bottom of the display disappears, and Glass 
continues to record until you tell it to stop (see the next section) or until 
you run out of battery power or file storage.
	
Even if you used the “OK Glass” voice command to start recording, you have 
to use your hands to extend or stop the recording.
	
Figure 8-6: 
Just press 
Camera to 
extend the 
recording.
	
Stopping a recording
You can stop recording in either of two ways, depending on how you’re 
recording:
	
✓	If you’re making a default 10-second recording and want to stop record­
ing before the time limit expires, tap the touchpad, swipe through the 
video menu, and then choose Stop Recording from the menu.
	
✓	If you’re making an extended recording (see the preceding section), 
press the Camera button once. You can also choose Stop Recording from 
the menu as you would with a 10-second video.
When you stop recording, the "ok glass" prompt appears at the bottom 
of the screen, as shown in Figure 8-7. If you want to share the video with or 
send the video to one of your contacts or people in a Google+ circle, say “OK 
Glass, share with. . .” followed by the name of your contact or circle. We talk 
about other ways to share later in this chapter.

Figure 8-7: 
You can 
issue a

Playing video
After you record a video, it appears on your Glass timeline as a card. Tapping 
the card opens a menu that offers the following choices:
	
✓	Play: Plays the video from the beginning (see Figure 8-8).
	
✓	Share: Opens another menu that allows you to share the video with 
one or more contacts, Google+ friends, or various social networks via 
Glassware apps.
	
✓	Delete: Removes the video from your timeline and from your Glass.
	
Figure 8-8: 
Start playing 
the video by 
choosing 
Play.
	
	
You can always pause playback by tapping the touchpad and resume playback 
by tapping the touchpad again. Also, while the video is playing, you can swipe 
backward on the touchpad to rewind and swipe forward to skip boring parts.

94
Part III: It Can Do That? 
Sharing Your Glass Media
Glass is built to share data. You can share pictures and videos from your 
Glass with your friends, your Google+ circles, and other social media shar­
ing apps available for Glass (such as Facebook and YouTube). This section 
shows you how.
	
Google+ keeps an eye out for content in posts that isn’t eligible to be shared. 
You must not share pictures or videos that are owned by another person or 
by a company without express written permission, for example. If you don’t, 
your post will be removed, and you could be barred from the Google+ service. 
If you’re not certain how you should use your Glass to share information, see 
Chapter 7.
Sharing from your timeline
It’s easy to share a picture or video from your timeline. Just follow these 
steps:
	
1.	Find the picture’s or video’s card by swiping forward and backward 
on your timeline until the card appears onscreen.
	
2.	Tap the touchpad and then choose Share from the menu.
	
	 You see the Share icon, as shown in Figure 8-9.
Capture with care
Taking pictures and videos of yourself or others 
could create unintended consequences if 
you’re not careful. Plenty of people have been 
denied jobs or fired for posting inappropriate 
pictures or videos to their social networking 
profiles. If you tell your boss that you’re sick, for 
example, and then post a video that you took on 
your Glass while enjoying a bike ride that same 
day, he or she may decide that you’re not smart 
enough to continue working for the company.
Also, after you take pictures or videos of your­
self, you may want to share them with a trusted 
friend or two to ensure that the material is 
appropriate. If you’re too embarrassed to show 
a picture or video of yourself to friends, that’s a 
good sign that you shouldn’t show it to anyone 
else.

Figure 8-9: 
The Share 
icon allows 
you to share 
a picture 
or video by 
tapping the 
touchpad.
	
	
3.	Swipe through the available sharing options in the menu and then 
select the service with which you want to share your picture or video.
	
4.	If you want to add a caption, see the next section; otherwise, wait 
until Glass shares your picture or video.
	
	 When Glass finishes the sharing process, you see the picture or video 
onscreen.
Adding captions
Have you ever been frustrated when someone shares a picture with you 
but doesn’t add the filename or a brief description? Posting media without 
explaining who’s in the picture or video and what that person is doing can 
cause viewers to complain to you — or ignore your posts. Your Glass makes 
it easy for you to be nice to your viewers by adding captions.
	
At the bottom of the screen is the progress bar, which is a white line. This line 
moves from left to right and denotes the time it takes to share the picture or 
video. You can decide whether you want to add a caption while the progress 
bar is onscreen. When the progress bar reaches the right side of the screen, 
time runs out; the progress bar disappears; and you’re sharing without a 
caption.
You can add a caption in two ways:
	
✓	Tap the touchpad after you tell Glass the contact, Google+ circle, or 
social network (such as Facebook) with which you want to share your 
picture or video (refer to “Sharing from your timeline” earlier in this 
chapter).
www.it-ebooks.info

96
Part III: It Can Do That? 
	
✓	When you share a picture or video from your timeline, you see "ok 
glass" at the bottom of the screen, as shown in Figure 8-10. This text 
informs you that you can speak commands, so the other way you can 
add a caption is to say “OK Glass, add caption.”
	
Figure 8-10: 
You can tell 
Glass to add 
a caption.
	
Whichever of the preceding two methods you choose, when the Caption 
screen appears, say what you want to include in the caption. As you speak, 
the words appear onscreen so that you can see what the caption will look like 
(see Figure 8-11). You can include hashtags, if you want; see the nearby side­
bar “Cooking up caption #hashtags.”
	
Figure 8-11: 
Speak your 
caption.

97
 Chapter 8: Making Your Memories
If you decide that you don’t want to add the caption, swipe down on the 
touchpad. If you do want to add it, tap the touchpad. Your caption appears in 
the bottom-left corner of the picture, and text below the picture informs you 
when the caption was added (see Figure 8-12).
	
Figure 8-12: 
Your 
finished 
caption, 
complete 
with time

Sharing with your computer
Another way to share your media is to share it with your computer. Just ­connect 
your Glass to your computer with a micro USB cable. Your computer recognizes 
that Glass is a media device, just like a smartphone or camera. Then you can 
access the Glass files on your computer as you would any other picture and 
video files.
Cooking up caption #hashtags
If you want other Google+ users to find your 
pictures based on a specific topic, you can 
add hashtag topics to your caption. Hashtag 
topics are preceded by the pound (#) sign, 
and Google+ searches for them in posts when 
a Google+ user searches for a topic. By default, 
Glass adds the #throughglass topic to your 
caption automatically.
You can add your own hashtag topics to your 
caption, too. If you say “hashtag biking,” for 
example, Glass automatically converts your 
spoken text to #biking.
www.it-ebooks.info

98
Part III: It Can Do That? 
To view your pictures and videos in Windows Explorer, click the Glass device 
in the folder tree and then navigate to the \DCIM\Camera folder. On a Mac, 
use the Finder to navigate to the appropriate media folder. Then share, copy, 
and paste files from that folder as you would from any other folder on your 
computer.
Backing Up Your Media to Google+
Google automatically synchronizes all your pictures and videos to your Auto 
Backup album on Google+ when you plug your Glass into the charger and 
connect it to the Internet via Wi-Fi (see Chapter 3).
	
The Auto Backup folder is part of the Google Drive account that’s part of your 
Google account. You can find out more about Google Drive at https://
support.google.com/drive/answer/2424384?hl=en.
Pictures and videos upload at their original resolutions, up to a maximum 
4,288 by 2,848 pixels. Google provides 15GB of free storage space in the Auto 
Backup folder, which should be enough for most needs.
	
If the pictures in the Auto Backup folder occupy more than 15GB, Google 
automatically resizes the pictures to standard size: a maximum 2,048 pixels on 
the longest edge. This resizing frees some room in the Auto Backup folder for 
more files.
Google allows you to back up an unlimited number of videos to the Auto 
Backup folder as long as each video is less than 15 minutes long and has a 
resolution of 1080p or lower. (1080p resolution is 1,920 by 1,080 pixels.) If you 
back up videos that are longer than 15 minutes, those files count against your 
15GB space quota.
So what happens if you need more space? You can get it — at a price, starting 
at $4.99 per month for 100GB. You can view the full storage plan and pricing 
list at https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375123.
	
If you don’t want to worry about maxing out your online storage space, you 
can also back up files to your computer (see “Sharing with your computer” 
earlier in this chapter). Just copy files from your Glass to a folder on your 
computer.
www.it-ebooks.info

99
 Chapter 8: Making Your Memories
Accessing backed-up files
You can access synchronized files from the Google+ website on your browser 
or through the Google+ app on your Android or iOS device. When Glass is 
connected to the Internet through a Wi-Fi connection, you can also use these 
services to sync the pictures on your Glass to the Auto Backup album at 
any time. In addition, you can use the Google+ app to move files from the 
Auto Backup folder to a Google+ folder that you share with Google+ contacts 
and/or circles.
Backing up manually (Android and iOS)
After you enable Auto Backup, the Google+ app uploads any pictures or 
videos you take with your smartphone or tablet to the Auto Backup folder 
automatically. When you sign out of the Google+ app, any pictures and videos 
that you take don’t upload to the Auto Backup folder. You can upload those

(Almost) Everything Is 
Possible Online
In This Chapter
▶	Performing a Google search
▶	Browsing the web on Glass
▶	Hanging out in Hangouts
▶	Getting and sending e-mail
▶	Getting the latest information with Google Now
Answers are what we are trying to get at; search is a process by which you 
may be able to get answers, but it’s not the end goal. It’s a mechanism.
— Conrad Wolfram
S

earching for information without reaching for your smartphone is one of 
the big advantages of using Google Glass. It’s easy to search the web by 
using the built-in Google search engine from the Home screen. Glass also offers 
the Google Now service, an automated personal assistant that shows informa­
tion cards based on what Glass knows about you and how you use Glass.
In addition, Glass creates timeline entries that are based on how you use 
Google technologies. If you travel between work and home often, for example, 
Glass creates a new timeline card with a map automatically; this map shows 
you the fastest route you can take from your work location back home.
Glass also contains built-in apps for connecting with people. You can use the 
industry-standard Short Message Service (SMS) to send brief text messages 
to other users via Glass. You can chat in a live video call in Google Hangouts. 
And you can send e-mail messages. We show you how in this chapter.
	
SMS functionality is available only if you’re using Glass with an Android smart­
phone on which the MyGlass app is installed. If you don’t have SMS functional­
ity, Glass sends any SMS message by e-mail to the recipient automatically.

Part III: It Can Do That? 
Searching to Your Heart’s Content
To search the Internet on Glass, you need to be connected to the Internet 
through the device’s Wi-Fi connection or your smartphone’s data plan. (See 
Chapter 6 to find out how to pair Glass with your smartphone.) You have 
three ways to search for information:
	
✓	At the Home screen, say “OK Glass, Google. . .” followed by the word(s) 
you want to search for or the question you want answered. A couple of 
seconds after you stop speaking, Glass displays the result onscreen.
	
✓	At the Home screen, tap the touchpad and then tap Google on the menu. 
When the Google screen appears, say the search word(s) or ask your 
question.
	
✓	If the screen is off, you can turn it on by tapping the touchpad three 
times slowly. When you see the Google screen, say the search word(s) or 
ask your question.
For every search result, Glass not only displays the result onscreen (in words 
and/or pictures), but also reads the result to you over its speaker. You don’t 
need to enable any setting to have Glass read the search results to you; 
this feature works right out of the box. To find out more about Glass basics, 
including how and when Glass talks to you, see Chapter 4.
What you can search for
You can initiate many types of searches on Glass. Here are a few examples:
	
✓	Service tips: You can use Glass to calculate the tip when you go out to 
dinner. If you ask “What is 15 percent of 33 dollars?”, for example, Glass 
displays the result shown in Figure 9-1.
	
Figure 9-1: 
Glass cal-
culates a 
dinner tip.

103
 Chapter 9: (Almost) Everything Is Possible Online
	
✓	Translations: You can translate phrases into other languages. When you 
ask “How do you say ‘Good afternoon?’ in Slovenian?”, you see the trans­
lation shown in Figure 9-2.
	
Figure 9-2: 
Asking a 
question in 
Slovenian.
	
	
✓	Definitions: You may want to get the definition of a word you don’t know 
or want to know more about. When you say “Define serendipity,” Glass 
displays the word’s definition, as well as its pronunciation and part of 
speech (see Figure 9-3).
	
Figure 9-3: 
Glass can 
be a walking 
dictionary.
	
	
✓	Nearby attractions: You can find attractions in a city you’re visiting. To 
find places to dine in San Francisco, say “Restaurants in San Francisco.” 
Glass finds the restaurants closest to your current location and displays 
them on a map, as shown in Figure 9-4. You can get more information 
about a restaurant by selecting the restaurant in the list. (Scrolling 
through the list may be required.)

options 
in San 
Francisco.
	
	
After you search for something on your Glass, the search appears as a card in 
your timeline (see Chapter 4). You can delete a past search by deleting its card 
from the timeline.
How to find out more
In some cases, Glass may not give you all the information you want in 
response to a query, but you don’t have to settle for its first answer. You can 
follow up on a search result in two ways: by asking a follow-up question or by 
viewing a website.
Ask a follow-up question
You ask a follow-up question by going back to the Google Search screen and 
asking the question by using pronouns. To get more information about a 
result that shows you how tall the Eiffel Tower is, for example, you can ask 
“When was it built?” Glass is smart enough to realize that you’re following up 
on your last question and that it refers to the Eiffel Tower, so it displays the 
screen shown in Figure 9-5, telling you that construction of the Eiffel Tower 
began in 1887.
View a website
Sometimes, a result screen displays a URL in the bottom-left corner; this URL 
is a link to the website where Glass got the result information. In Figure 9-6, 
for example, a search result for a question about why the sky is blue contains 
a link to a website at the University of California–Riverside.

Browsing Any Time, Anywhere
Google produces its own web browser, Chrome, for desktops, laptops, tab­
lets, and smartphones, so it’s no surprise that Google created a special ver­
sion of Chrome for Glass that takes advantage of the device’s user interface. 
On Glass, the Chrome browser is called the Browser app.
Websites designed for mobile devices look best on Glass, which is also a 
mobile device and has screen resolution (640 by 360 pixels) similar to that of 
many other mobile devices. The Browser app makes it easy for you to navi­
gate all types of websites that you encounter, however.
	
If a website has a mobile version, that website detects that Glass is a mobile 
device and opens the mobile version automatically. The Browser app on your 
Glass, however, doesn’t work with gestures that you can use on mobile web­
sites. On a smartphone, for example, you can view different sections of a site 
by swiping left to right. Because you need to use gestures to navigate in the 
Glass operating system, however, you need to tap the section heading link to 
view more information.
You can open the Browser app in a search result screen by tapping the touch­
pad and then choosing View Website from the menu. The Browser app displays 
the website and highlights the center of the screen (see Figure 9-7), which 
shows the area of the site that you can manipulate to do various things.
You can use your finger and your head to move around a website by using 
four gestures: scrolling, zooming, panning, and tapping. We discuss these ges­
tures in the following sections.

Figure 9-7: 
The center 
of the 
screen con-
tains a high-

bounded by 
a dashed 
circle.
	
	
The Browser app doesn’t close automatically after a period of inactivity. Like 
any app, the Browser app drinks juice from your battery, and if you decide to 
do something else on Glass, the Browser app remains active. So to prevent any 
unexpected low-battery message from popping up on the screen (which, of 
course, will happen when you’re doing something important), be sure to close 
the Browser card in your timeline. If you need to know how to do that, get up 
to speed in Chapter 4.
Scroll up and down
To scroll down a web page, slide your finger forward on the touchpad, 
and to scroll up a web page, slide your finger backward on the touchpad 
(see Figure 9-8). As you move up and down the website, the viewable area 
onscreen changes as well.

Part III: It Can Do That? 
Zoom in and out
Slide two fingers forward or backward to zoom in and out, respectively, as 
shown in Figure 9-9. When you zoom in, the text and images onscreen and 
in the viewable area get larger. When you zoom out, the text and images 
onscreen and in the viewable area get smaller.
	
Figure 9-9: 
Zooming a 
web page.
	
@Wiley/Michael E. Trent
Look around a web page
If a web page is wider than the Glass screen (which may be the case more 
often than not), just use your head — that is, hold two fingers on the touch­
pad and then move your head around. The web page moves up, down, left, 
and right onscreen as your head moves in those directions.
Tap a link
In the center of the viewable area is a group of small dots arranged in a circu­
lar pattern (see Figure 9-10). This circular pointer serves the same function as 
a mouse pointer on a desktop computer. To position this pointer, maneuver 
the screen so that the pointer appears over the hyperlinked text or image 
that you want. When you do, the text link changes color or a colored box 
appears around the image. To select the link, tap the touchpad.

Hanging Out with Your Friends
Because Glass comes from Google, several Google technologies work with it 
right out of the box. One of these technologies is Hangouts, Google’s video­
conferencing app. Glass lets you use Hangouts to send and receive chats and 
photos, as well as make video calls.
	
If you want to have a video call through Hangouts, your contact must also be 
logged in to Hangouts and connected with you as a friend.
You can initiate a video call with a contact on Google+ or a group of contacts 
in a Google+ circle. You can also receive a video call from another Google+ 
user (or even from another Glass user). When you participate in a Google 
Hangout, you see the video of the other participants on your screen, and 
the other participants see your point of view — that is, what you’re seeing 
through the camera of your Glass.
	
Keep in mind four important facts about receiving and initiating video calls on 
Glass:
	
✓	You can make video calls only if you’re running the Hangouts app on 
your Glass.
	
✓	Video calls use up your battery a little faster than other activities do, so 
it’s best to keep your video conversations as brief as possible.
www.it-ebooks.info

110
Part III: It Can Do That? 
	
✓	As more invitees join your Hangout, the faces on the screen become smaller 
to accommodate all the people you’re chatting with. Don’t worry, though; 
the number of faces you see won’t resemble a CNBC television discussion 
with multiple analysts, in which you can barely see all the faces on the 
screen. You’ll still be able to recognize everyone in the Hangout.
	
✓	We recognize that you’re an upstanding citizen, but this reminder is 
important: Consider etiquette and common sense when you’re in a video 
Hangout. Refrain from broadcasting events or content where such activ­
ity is prohibited, such as a movie playing in a theater.
Joining a Hangout
When you get a request to join a Google Hangout, you hear a chime on the Glass 
speaker and also see a picture of the person who’s inviting you to the Hangout.
If you want to join the call, tap the touchpad or say “OK Glass, accept call.” 
To decline the invitation, ignore it by swiping forward on the touchpad or say 
“OK Glass, reject call.”
Starting a Hangout
You can start a Hangout of your own from any screen. Just say “OK Glass, 
make a video call to. . .” followed by the name of the contact or the name of 
the Google+ circle containing the contacts you want to invite to the Hangout. 
If the contact has logged in to the Google+ website on his or her computer or 
has the Hangout app for the iOS or Android mobile platforms, that contact 
can participate in the Hangout.
	
If the contact or circle you name isn’t in your Google Contacts database, a 
brief message appears onscreen, stating that the contact or circle doesn’t 
exist. In such a case, you have to add that contact first (see Chapter 5).
After you invite a contact to a Hangout, you see the Waiting screen, which 
tells you that you’re waiting for your invited contact to join your Hangout 
(see Figure 9-11).
	
You can continue to do other things while you wait for a contact to join your 
Hangout (see the next section) by swiping down on the touchpad to access 
your timeline.
When someone joins the Hangout, you hear the chime that sounds when you 
receive a request to connect; then you see the contact’s face on the Hangouts 
screen. When more of your invitees connect with you in the Hangout, you 
hear that chime and see those contacts’ faces onscreen.

Taking action in a Hangout
While you’re in a Hangout, you can perform other tasks, such as check your 
timeline for an appointment on your calendar. When you do, your camera is 
muted (that is, turned off), and other Hangout participants won’t be able to see 
your point of view. Your audio is still on, however, so your Hangout participants 
will be able to hear you. You can re-enter the video call and unmute your camera 
by tapping the active video-call card on the left side of the Home screen.
During your Hangout, you can do a variety of other things by tapping the 
touchpad and then choosing one of these options from the menu:
	
✓	People: See a list of people who are in the video call with you.
	
✓	Leave: Exit the Hangout. If you’re the person who started the Hangout, 
the Hangout ends for all participants when you leave.
	
✓	Invite: Add people or circles up to a maximum of ten contacts.
	
✓	Mute Mic: Deactivate the microphone so that Hangout participants can’t 
hear you.
	
✓	Mute Video: Deactivate the camera so that Hangout participants can’t 
see what’s on your screen. (You may want to participants know that 
you’re turning off your video before you do this so that they don’t 
wonder what happened to you.)
Sending E-mail Messages
E-mail is a very popular way of sending information, so Glass lets you send and 
receive e-mail messages. If your contact has only an e-mail address and no phone 
number or any other contact information, such as a Google account, Glass sends 
messages for that person to his or her e-mail address automatically.
www.it-ebooks.info

112
Part III: It Can Do That? 
	
Before you send e-mail messages on your Glass, you need to add e-mail con­
tacts via the MyGlass website or the MyGlass app on your smartphone. For 
details, see Chapter 5.
You’ve got mail
When you receive an incoming e-mail message, Glass plays a unique chime, 
even if the display is off. Here’s how to read and respond to e-mail:
	
1.	Turn on the display by tapping the touchpad or using Head Wake Up 
(see Chapter 6).
	
	 The e-mail card appears, as shown in Figure 9-12, including the e-mail 
Subject line, a snippet of the message, and photos of you and/or the 
recipient (if those photos exist).
	
Figure 9-12: 
Getting 
e-mail on 
Glass.
	
	
2.	Tap the touchpad and then choose one of the following options from 
the resulting menu:
 
• Read More: Read more of the message if it’s too long to fit on the 
screen.
 
• Reply: Open the Reply screen so that you can speak a reply and 
then send it to the recipient.
 
• Archive: Save the message to Glass and delete the message from 
the timeline.
 
• Read Aloud: Have Glass read the displayed message snippet to you.
 
• Star: Mark the message as one of your favorites.
 
• Delete: Delete the message from the timeline.
www.it-ebooks.info

113
 Chapter 9: (Almost) Everything Is Possible Online
	
3.	Swipe down on the touchpad to close the menu.
	
4.	To close the e-mail card and return to the timeline, swipe down on the 
touchpad while you’re viewing the e-mail card.
	
If your e-mail message is part of a thread (related messages about the same 
topic), the e-mail message card appears as a bundled card. You can read all 
the messages in the thread by tapping the card and then swiping backward 
and forward on the touchpad. We discuss bundled cards in Chapter 4.
Open hailing frequencies
It’s easy to send an e-mail message to someone else. Just follow these steps:
	
1.	Say “OK Glass, send a message to.”
	
	 Glass displays your contacts list.
	
2.	Speak the name of the intended recipient or select it by using the 
touchpad.
	
	 The Send Message To screen appears, as shown in Figure 9-13.
	
Figure 9-13: 
Confirm the 
recipient’s 
name in 
the Send 
Message To 
screen.
	
	
3.	Speak your message.
	
	 As you do, the text appears below the recipient’s name, as shown in 
Figure 9-14.

114
Part III: It Can Do That? 
	
	 A couple of seconds after you stop speaking, the Glass screen shows a 
message for a few seconds so that you can cancel the send by swiping 
down on the touchpad. If you do nothing, you see the Sent message 
text on the screen for a second or two; then the message appears as 
a card on your timeline. The recipient sees the words Sent through 
Glass appended to the end of the message.

Getting Fast Facts with Google Now
You may have heard about automated personal assistants such as Siri, the 
iOS feature that lets you ask your device questions and get spoken informa­
tion about all sorts of stuff. Google has its own automated personal assistant, 
called Google Now. The Google Now app gives you the information you need 
in several categories, including Calendar, Flights, Weather, Sports, Stocks, and 
Places (see Figure 9-15).
The Google Now app monitors how you use Glass and places cards on your 
timeline that reflect your interests. If you’re traveling, for example, Google 
Now detects flight delays and displays a card onscreen automatically. In 
some cases, you may find out about a delay before you leave for the airport.
	
To set up Google Now on Glass, you need an Android smartphone, because 
the Google Now app requires the Google Search app that comes preinstalled 
on Android smartphones running the Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) operating 
system or a later version.

Chapter 10
Using Glass with Your Phone
In This Chapter
▶	Making and receiving calls
▶	Exchanging messages with friends
▶	Sharing your screen live
▶	Controlling your Glass remotely
To me, e-mails are a little bit frustrating. I think that the telephone is much 
preferred because you get the sound of the voice and the interest and 
everything else you can’t see in an e-mail.
— T. Boone Pickens
G

lass doesn’t have a phone incorporated into its hardware — at least, 
not in the first version of the device — so it relies on any smartphone 
that allows you to make Bluetooth connections. When you connect your 
smartphone and your Glass, you’ll be able to place calls by speaking into 
Glass and also receive calls over your hands-free handset.
If your contact has a phone number, and you want to send a message to that 
person, Glass sends a Short Message Service (SMS) message to the person’s 
smartphone or tablet. The SMS service works with your Android smart­
phone so you can tell Glass to dictate a message to a specific contact. When 
you send that message, it appears in the contact’s messaging app on his 
smartphone.
Finally, the MyGlass app available on smartphones comes with a nifty feature 
called screencasting, which allows you to project what’s happening on the 
Glass screen to a projector or a smartphone. You can even use the MyGlass 
app to control Glass from your smartphone while you’re screencasting, which 
is useful for explaining how to navigate on Glass to your audience.
www.it-ebooks.info

118
Part III: It Can Do That? 
Making and Taking Phone Calls
The benefit of using Glass as a headset for making and receiving calls is that 
you don’t have to fumble for your phone in your pocket and then keep look­
ing down at your phone or holding the phone to your head to converse with 
someone. Instead, Glass gives you the freedom to make and receive calls 
hands-free.
	
For purposes of this chapter, we assume that you’ve already connected your 
smartphone to your Glass via a Bluetooth connection. If you aren’t sure how 
to do that, see Chapter 6.
Opening a channel
It’s easy to make a call. Just say “OK Glass, make a call to. . .” followed by the 
name of the person in the Glass contact database whom you want to call. If 
you say “OK Glass, make a call to Albert Einstein,” you see the call screen 
shown in Figure 10-1.
	
Figure 10-1: 
Calling 
a world-
famous 
scientist.
	
	
Be sure that you have a phone number in the contact record on your Glass for 
the person you want to call (see Chapter 5).
Captain, you’re being hailed
When you receive a phone call, Glass plays a rising and falling chime on its 
speaker and then displays the name and phone number of the person who’s 
calling you.
www.it-ebooks.info

119
 Chapter 10: Using Glass with Your Phone
To accept the call, do either of the following:
	
✓	Tap the touchpad and choose Accept from the menu.
	
✓	Say “OK Glass, answer call.”
To reject the call, do one of the following:
	
✓	Tap the touchpad and swipe down.
	
✓	Tap the touchpad, swipe forward, and then choose Reject from the menu.
	
✓	Say “OK Glass, decline call.”
Controlling your call
During a call, you can use either your Glass or your smartphone to control 
the call, as follows:
	
✓	On your Glass, to mute your voice so that the other person can’t hear 
you, tap the touchpad and choose Mute Your Mic from the menu. You 
can unmute your voice and be heard again by tapping the touchpad and 
choosing Unmute from the menu.
	
✓	On your Glass, end the call by tapping the touchpad and then choosing 
End Call from the menu.
	
✓	On your smartphone, end the call by tapping End onscreen.
Sending SMS Messages
If a contact record stored in the contact database on your Glass includes a 
phone number, you can send an SMS message to that contact by using your 
voice instead of hunting and pecking with your thumbs as you would on a 
smartphone.
	
You can access your imported contacts from the Google Contacts database 
only by using the touchpad; you can’t use the voice feature. That is, when you 
send a message, you need to scroll through the contact list by swiping back­
ward or forward on the touchpad. When you find the contact name you want, 
tap the touchpad.
Glass doesn’t have built-in SMS messaging capabilities — at least, not yet. 
Instead, it uses the Google Voice app on your phone (if you’ve installed it and 
set it up) or the messaging app on your smartphone to send SMS messages.
	
At this writing, SMS messaging is available only via a Bluetooth connection to 
an Android smartphone running the MyGlass app (see Chapter 5).

Sending to a Glass contact
To send an SMS message, follow these steps:
	
1.	Say “OK Glass, send a message to. . .” followed by the name of the 
contact.
	
	 The Send Message screen appears, as shown in Figure 10-2, so you can 
see that Glass has recognized the name of your contact.

2.	Start dictating your message.
	
	 As you speak, the message appears below the contact’s name (see 
Figure 10-3).
	
	 A couple of seconds after you stop speaking, Glass sends the message. 
You see Sent text onscreen for a second or two; then the message 
appears in a card on your timeline.

121
 Chapter 10: Using Glass with Your Phone
	
You have only a couple of seconds to cancel a message before it’s sent off to 
the contact’s message app, so keep your messages short and to the point.
Sending to a smartphone contact
If you want to send an SMS message to someone who isn’t in your Glass con­
tacts list but is in your smartphone’s contacts list, here’s how to do that:
	
1.	On the Home screen, tap the touchpad.
	
2.	Choose Send Message from the menu.
	
3.	Find the smartphone contact by swiping backward and forward on 
the touchpad.
	
4.	Dictate the message (see “Sending to a Glass contact” earlier in this 
chapter).
Going Live with Screencasting
Your Glass can use your smartphone to show people a live view of what 
you’re seeing on the Glass screen. You can show people what you’re look­
ing at on your smartphone, for example, or you can connect Glass to a large 
monitor or even a projector by connecting the smartphone to the monitor 
or projector (via an HDMI adapter cable). Before you can screencast, you 
need to set up the MyGlass app on your smartphone (see Chapter 5).
	
Here are some important screencasting facts to keep in mind:
	
✓	Screencasting doesn’t transfer sound to your phone; the sounds you 
hear on your Glass stay confined to the Glass speaker. If you’re present­
ing Glass to an audience, make sure that you tell them what you’re hearing 
on your Glass as you perform tasks.
	
✓	When you begin your presentation, tell your audience that there’ll be 
a brief delay before what you see on the Glass screen appears on the 
smartphone, monitor, or projector. This disclaimer helps your audi­
ence members understand that the slow performance they see on the 
phone, monitor, or projector doesn’t match what they’d see on the 
Glass screen.

Starting and stopping a screencast
When you’ve set up MyGlass as described in Chapter 5, you can screencast 
by following these steps:
	
1.	Open the MyGlass app on your smartphone.
	
2.	Choose Screencast from the menu (see Figure 10-4).
	
	 The screencast begins immediately, and the phone’s screen displays 
exactly what you’re seeing on the Glass screen.
	
3.	To end the screencast, tap the smartphone’s Back or Home button.

 Chapter 10: Using Glass with Your Phone
Connecting to a video device
HDMI cables allow you to connect your Android smartphone to any video 
device that has an HDMI port, including most monitors and projectors pro­
duced in the past two or three years.
	
Because each phone is different, be sure to consult your smartphone’s docu­
mentation and the manufacturer’s website to find out how to connect your 
smartphone to your monitor or projector effectively.
Controlling a screencast
If you’re using a smartphone running Android 4.1 or later, you can use the 
MyGlass smartphone app to control your Glass. (Remote control of your 
Glass isn’t available in the iOS MyGlass app as of this writing.)
You may want to control your Glass remotely for several reasons:
	
✓	You feel more comfortable using your smartphone to do things on your 
Glass.
	
✓	You want to transition to the Glass user interface slowly.
	
✓	You want to use your smartphone to show someone else how to navi­
gate the Glass screens while you’re using Glass.
After you begin a screencast, the smartphone screen displays what’s on the 
Glass screen, as shown in Figure 10-5.
	
Figure 10-5:

screen as 
it appears 
on a

124
Part III: It Can Do That? 
You can use the following gestures on your phone as equivalent gestures on 
your Glass:
	
✓	Swipe up and down on the smartphone screen to swipe up and down, 
respectively, on the Glass touchpad.
	
✓	Swipe left and right to swipe backward and forward, respectively, on the 
Glass touchpad.
	
✓	Tap the smartphone screen to tap the Glass touchpad.
If you decide that you don’t want to use your smartphone to control Glass 
any longer, just tap your smartphone’s Back or Home button.
Best and worst bets for screencasts
If you’re wondering how to make Glass shine 
for your audience, here are some Glass fea­
tures and tasks that make good screencasts, as 
well as some that don’t (at this writing, anyway).
Good:
	✓	Swipe back and forth on the timeline, open 
a card, and open a card bundle.
	✓	Open the Google Now card and point out 
Google Now features, such as the latest 
appointments on your calendar.
	✓	Make a phone call to someone in your 
audience. (Be sure to add that person to 
your contacts list before your presenta­
tion. Also, test a phone call first to ensure 
that the call video appears properly in the 
screencast.)
	✓	Send an e-mail or SMS message to some­
one in your audience. The audience will 
see the message as you speak into Glass, 
and the person who receives the mes­
sage can verify that it arrived on his or her 
smartphone.
	✓	Show the current weather where you are, 
or ask an audience member for a city and 
then show the current weather and fore­
cast for that city.
	✓	Take a picture of something  —  even of 
your audience members, if they agree to 
let you — and share that picture on your 
favorite social network.
Not so good:
	✓	Web browsing can be a bit sluggish, so test 
it at the site of your presentation before­
hand. If the test fails, you can easily keep 
browsing out of your presentation.
	✓	If you turn or move too quickly while dem­
onstrating how GPS works, the screencast 
starts to lag. Test this feature before the 
presentation to get an idea of how quickly 
you can move without any problems.
	✓	Because of the delay between Glass and 
the projector, you may want to reserve 
video demonstrations for people who also 
have Glass on their heads.

▶	Getting directions with your Glass
▶	Naming that tune
▶	Giving your eyes a break
This wired generation is kind of cool.
— LeVar Burton
O

ne of the best things about owning any new device, especially Glass, is 
discovering all the cool stuff it can do. In this chapter, we show you a 
few fun things you can do with your Glass.
Navigating the World in a Flash
Before you try to get directions on your Glass, be sure that you’ve done three 
things:
	
✓	Installed the MyGlass app and enabled GPS location services on your 
smartphone (see Chapter 5)
	
✓	Paired Glass with your smartphone (see Chapter 3)
	
✓	Connected Glass to the Internet (see Chapter 3)
Getting routed
When everything’s in place, give the built-in navigation app a try by asking 
Glass for directions to a major city. By default, the directions you see are 
those for driving to your destination.
www.it-ebooks.info

126
Part III: It Can Do That? 
The Google Maps view is good, but it doesn’t give you precise directions. To 
augment a map with a route, for example, say “OK Glass, get directions to San 
Francisco.” The route information card appears, as shown on the right side of 
Figure 11-1. This card lists your current location, the name of the next street 
or exit you need to take, the turn direction, and the distance to the turn, as 
well as how long it will take to get to your destination.
Figure 11-1: 
The route 
informa-
tion card 
does almost 
everything 
but drive the 
car for you.
To close the Google Maps or route information screen (see the next section), 
just tap the touchpad and then choose Stop from the menu that appears.
	
Even if you take your Glass off your head or turn the screen off while the navi­
gation app is running, the app continues to run in the background, and when­
ever new directions occur, Glass plays those directions over its speaker.
Deciding how to get there
You don’t necessarily have to drive to use Glass for navigation. The device 
can give you directions no matter how you’re traveling, be it on foot, via 
bicycle, on public transportation, or by car.
	
Google built the Google Maps Transit system into Glass so that users in select 
cities can get information on local bus and train travel. You can view train and 
bus timetables, find out whether (and when) to switch trains or buses, find 
the distance to the nearest terminal, and see how long it will take you to reach 
your destination based on your method of travel. You can see which cities are 
served by Google Maps Transit at www.google.com/landing/transit/
cities/index.html.
www.it-ebooks.info

127
 Chapter 11: Other Cool Stuff
Change your travel mode
If you want to change your method of travel, you can do so from within the 
Google Maps screen or the route information screen. Just tap the touchpad 
and then choose Transit (for bus or train), Drive (for car), Walk, or Bike. 
The information onscreen changes to reflect the new mode of travel.
	
The next time you view directions in the Google Maps or route information 
screen, the mode of travel defaults to your last selected mode.
View your entire route
If you want to see the route for your entire trip, here’s what to do:
	
1.	Tap the touchpad.
	
2.	Select the Show Route option by tapping the touchpad.
	
	 The Show Route screen displays a map that shows your starting point 
(a blue arrow), the path to your destination (a blue line), and the desti­
nation (a red pin), as shown in Figure 11-2. Below the map, you also see 
the following information, from left to right:
 
• An icon representing the selected mode of transportation
 
• The destination city
 
• The miles from your current location to your destination
 
• The travel time from your current location to your destination

mileage and 
travel time

Part III: It Can Do That? 
Review transit directions
If you’re traveling to your destination via one or more transit modes, you can 
get step-by-step directions to your destination. You see details about your 
trip on a screen that’s similar to Figure 11-3.
	
Figure 11-3: 
The direc-
tions 
include how 
long your 
entire round 
trip will 
take.
	
Here’s what these symbols represent:
	
✓	Travel methods: The white icons above the colored line show the meth­
ods of transportation you’ll need to take. You may see icons that denote 
walking (a stick figure), taking a bus (a bus icon), taking a train (a train 
icon), biking (a bike icon), and/or driving (a car icon) during different 
phases of the trip. The trip depicted in Figure 11-3, for example, has 
seven phases. You’d walk to the bus station, take several bus routes, and 
then take the city light-rail system to your destination.
	
✓	Trip phases: The line denotes what you’ll be doing at any phase of the 
trip and is color-coded to correspond with the icons above the line. 
Here’s what the various segments of the line shown in Figure 11-3 mean:
 
• Cyan dotted line: This line represents a walking route.
 
• Blue solid line: This line shows a bus or light-rail route.
	
	You may see different colors for different types of routes. In 
Figure 11-3, the light blue line signifies the bus route in your cur­
rent city, and the dark blue line signifies the bus and light-rail 
routes to and within your destination city.
 
• Green solid line: This line depicts a train route (not shown in 
Figure 11-3).
www.it-ebooks.info

129
 Chapter 11: Other Cool Stuff
 
• Circles: A circle marks the beginning or end of a phase. The colors 
of the circles denote what you’re going to do next. A blue circle, for 
example, means that the next step in your trip is boarding a light-rail 
train.
 
• Lines connecting circles: These symbols represent the length of 
each phase of the trip relative to the overall length of the trip.
Checking out the neighborhood
Because Glass is connected to the GPS locator on your smartphone, your 
phone keeps track not only of where you are, but also of what interesting 
attractions are nearby. After all, Google doesn’t want you to miss any photos 
you can take with Glass and share with your family members and friends.
When an attraction is near you, a card on the timeline shows that attraction. 
If your phone finds several attractions in your area, you see a card bundle, as 
shown in Figure 11-4.
	
Figure 11-4: 
When 
you’re 
in Paris, 
attractions 
are all 
around you.
	
View the attractions as individual cards by tapping the bundle or (if only 
one attraction is nearby) view the attraction’s card in the timeline (see 
Figure 11-5).

Get details 
on a notable 
photo spot 
in Mountain 
View,

www.it-ebooks.info

130
Part III: It Can Do That? 
	
If you want to find certain types of attractions or businesses, such as a coffee 
shop where you can relax and catch up on your e-mail, just say something like 
“OK Glass, get directions to a coffee shop.” The resulting Google Maps page 
shows a list of all the coffee shops near your current location. You can scroll 
up and down the list of coffee shops and then tap a name in the list to get 
directions to that coffee shop.
Finding Out What’s Playing
Another good use of Glass is listening to music through the device’s 
speaker — much easier than digging up your smartphone and headphones 
and then putting your smartphone back where you found it. But you can do 
more than just listen to music. The Sound Search feature makes it easy for 
you to ask who’s singing that song.
While you’re listening to a song that’s playing over the speakers at your 
favorite coffee shop, you can find out the name of that song and the artist in 
one of two ways:
	
✓	Slowly tap the touchpad twice until the Google Search screen appears; 
then swipe forward on the touchpad.
	
✓	Say “OK Glass, Google what song is this?”
Whichever method you use, Glass listens to the song and then displays the 
details (see Figure 11-6). Now you can rest easy at night.
Directing your attention to appointments
You may find that you’re so enamored with get­
ting directions and finding out more about your 
environment that you forget about your next 
meeting. Thanks to the connection between your 
smartphone and your Glass, you can get remind­
ers of upcoming appointments that you’ve 
stored on the Google Now service. For informa­
tion on how to set up reminders on Google Now, 
see https://support.google.com/
websearch/answer/3122344?hl=en. 
You can also find out more about setting up and 
using Google Now on Glass in Chapter 9.

Treating Your Eyes Right
When you’re outdoors, you may find yourself squinting because the light is 
too bright. Not to worry. Google includes a sunglass shade with every Glass. 
You can also use a different frame if you don’t like the one that came with 
your device. We show you how to customize your look in this section.
	
You can get two types of eye protection for your Glass. The first type is a clear 
shield that protects your eyes, akin to safety goggles (but much more stylish 
and comfortable). You can also use a sunglass shade, which helps block sun­
light and protects your eyes on a bright, sunny day. Both clear and sunglass 
shields come with Glass.
Throwing shade
Google partnered with Maui Jim (www.mauijim.com) and Zeal Optics (www.
zealoptics.com) to put both a sunglass shade and a clear shield inside the 
box your Glass came in. Here’s how to attach either one:
	
1.	Align the shade outward so that it wraps around the front of your 
frame, as shown in Figure 11-7.
	
Figure 11-7: 
Align the 
shade.

2.	Tilt the shade so that the black cushion along the top of the shade’s 
nose bridge slides over the nose stems (see Figure 11-8).
	
Figure 11-8: 
Tilt the 
shade.
	
 
@Wiley/Michael E. Trent
	
3.	Slide the shade into place (shade outside the nose stems and black 
cushion inside the nose stems), as shown in Figure 11-9.
	
	 When the shield is firmly positioned and flush with the top of the Glass 
frame (see Figure 11-10), you’re ready to go outside. Enjoy the sunshine.

If you want a clear shield to protect your eyes from the elements, you can find 
one (and other Glass accessories) at https://glass.google.com/
getglass. If you don’t see the desired accessory, check back in a few days.
Switching frames
The frame that came with your Glass may not be exactly to your liking. If 
not, you can purchase a new frame for $225 (plus tax) at https://glass.
google.com/getglass. With your new frame, you also get a hard-body 
case, screwdriver, cleaning cloth, and extra nose pads.
What’s more, Google has now made four titanium frames available with 
your prescription lenses so you can see clearly and get the advantages of 
Glass. You can see all the frames at www.google.com/glass/start/
how-it-looks.
	
If you want to affix prescription lenses to your titanium frame, you need to talk 
with your eye care provider and/or visit a Glass Preferred Provider to have 
him or her install your lenses. Google recommends lenses cut within +4 to –4 
with astigmatism up to 2D. You can find a list of Glass Preferred Providers at 
www.google.com/glass/help/frames/providers.
	
You should check with your vision insurance company to see whether the 
company will cover the cost of your new Glass frame with prescription lenses. 
At this writing, only Vision Service Plan has announced support for the new 
Glass titanium frame.
Off with the old
As soon as you get your new frame, remove the old one by following these 
steps:
	
1.	Remove the screw on the inside of the device with a Torx T4 
screwdriver.
	
	 You can purchase a Torx T4 screwdriver at any hardware store (online 
or bricks-and-mortar).
	
2.	Grip the frame with your left hand and the pod with your right hand.
	
	 Google refers to the side of Glass that contains the camera, screen, 
speaker, and other circuitry as the pod.

To attach the new frame, follow these steps:
	
1.	Grip the frame with your left hand and the pod with your right hand.
	
2.	Align the screw hole in the frame with the screw hole on the pod.
	
3.	While holding the frame and pod together with your right hand, place 
the screw in the frame hole, and use a Torx T4 screwdriver to screw 
the frame and pod together.

T

he promise of wearable computers is that the devices themselves go 
away. That is, they melt into the background to deliver data as you need it 
instead of requiring you to look for something, as other computing devices do.
Apps written specifically for Google Glass are available now. These apps, 
which Google calls Glassware, go a long way toward fulfilling the promise that 
you see data only when you need it.
Shop for Glassware
Apps aren’t installed on Glass by default. Instead, you shop for them on the 
MyGlass website or on the MyGlass app on your smartphone (see Chapter 5).
Browse apps
To check out some of the Glassware that’s available, follow these steps:
	
1.	Go to the MyGlass website (www.google.com/myglass) on your 
smartphone or computer.
www.it-ebooks.info

138
Part IV: Give More Power to Your Glass 
	
2.	Click or tap Glassware on the menu bar at the top of the MyGlass 
home page (see Figure 12-1).
	
Figure 12-1: 
Select 
Glassware.
	
	
	 The Glassware page appears (see Figure 12-2), displaying two sections 
of apps that are available for Glass. The top section, Featured Glassware, 
lists apps that Google recommends. Below it, the All Glassware section 
shows all available apps. In both sections, apps are represented as cards 
and listed alphabetically from left to right.
	
	 Each app card contains the following information:
 
• The name of the app
 
• A description of the app
 
• The app icon
 
• A blue icon with a check mark (if the app is installed on your 
Glass) or a gray icon with a plus sign (if the app isn’t installed)
	
3.	Scroll the screen to view all the apps.
Many apps are available at this writing, including the following:
	
✓	Allthecooks Recipes: If you not only like to cook, but also like to share 
recipes, tips, and ask questions of other chefs, this app gives you the 
best of both worlds. You can read and follow recipes on your Glass 
instead of flipping through a printed recipe book and also connect with 
fellow app users to get recipes, share information, and ask how you can 
make your dishes even better.
	
✓	Compass: This app tells you the direction in which your head is pointing 
so you can orient yourself in the real world. The Compass app also uses 
your GPS location when you have your Glass connected to your smart­
phone to tell you when you’re near an interesting landmark, in case you 
want to check it out.

 Chapter 12: Finding Third-Party Apps
	
Figure 12-2: 
The 
Glassware 
page 
­displays 
available 
apps for 
Glass.
	
	
✓	GolfSight: Glass is great for golfers, because you can use the device 
without letting go of your club to check your smartphone. What’s more, 
the GolfSight app for Glass lets you calculate the distance to the next 
hole and adjust your strategy accordingly.
	
✓	IFTTT: Use the IFTTT app (the acronym stands for If This, Then That) to 
tell your Glass to do something when an event is triggered. You can tell 
IFTTT to send you an e-mail message whenever you’re mentioned in a 
Twitter post, for example.
	
✓	Mini Games: Google created five simple games — Balance, Clay Shooter, 
Matcher, Shape Splitter, and Tennis — that let you have fun and take 
advantage of the unique features of Glass. All you have to do to start 
playing these games is say “OK, Glass, play a game” at the Home screen.
	
✓	Spellista: If you’re a big fan of word-jumble games, the Spellista app 
is for you. Each level of the game allows you to unscramble different 
words. You can also play the game with other Spellista users through 
your Internet connection.
	
✓	Stopwatch: When you need to time a process or an event, you can use 
the Stopwatch app for Glass instead of using your smartphone or even 
your watch.
www.it-ebooks.info

140
Part IV: Give More Power to Your Glass 
	
✓	Strava: Going out for a run or a bike ride? Put Glass on your head and 
use the Strava app to keep track of statistics you want to know, such as 
how far and how long you’ve traveled. You can also view a map showing 
where you are on your route.
	
✓	Umano: Every day, this app sends your Glass interesting articles on 
topics such as technology, politics, and getting more from your personal 
life. The articles appear as cards on the timeline. Professional voice 
actors — not computer voice simulations — read the articles to you on 
your Glass, so the app sounds like a personal radio broadcast.
	
✓	Video Voyager: The Video Voyager (VV) app allows you to associ­
ate videos you take on your Glass with the locations where they were 
shared. You can share your videos taken with VV with other VV users, 
and you receive notifications when other VV users share videos taken 
near your current location.
	
✓	Word Lens: When you’re in a foreign country, viewing printed text or 
signs in a different language, you can use the Word Lens app to view 
those words and have the app translate them into your preferred 
language.
	
If you’re not sure which apps are worth using, and you’d rather not take the 
time to download and test each one, you can see what apps other Glass users 
are using on the Google+ website. See “Get Some Friendly Advice” later in this 
chapter.
Download apps
As of this writing, all Glass apps are available for free. When you find an app 
that you’re interested in, you can download it by following these steps:
	
1.	Click or tap the app’s card (refer to Figure 12-2).
	
	 A plus icon appears in the bottom-right corner of the card (see 
Figure 12-3).
	
Figure 12-3: 
Click or tap 
the plus 
icon on the 
card.

2.	 Install the app by clicking or tapping the plus icon.
	
	 The app’s description card appears (see Figure 12-4).
	
Figure 12-4: 
An app’s 
description 
card.
	
	
3.	To see what permissions you need on your Glass to run the app, click 
or tap the Permissions link.
	
	 A permissions tab or window pops up. To close the tab or window, click 
or tap the Close button (X) in its top-right corner.
	
4.	Do one of the following:
 
• To close the card without installing the app, click or tap its Close 
button.
 
• To install the app, click or tap the Off button.
During installation, you see the progress of the installation on the card; then 
the new app’s card appears on your timeline, as shown in Figure 12-5. When 
you see this card, you know that installation was successful and that you can 
start exploring the new app on your Glass.

Part IV: Give More Power to Your Glass 
Start Me Up
When you have a new app on your Glass, you can start it from the timeline in 
either of two ways:
	
✓	If your new app accepts voice commands, say “OK Glass. . .” You see a 
menu of commands for starting various apps. You can scroll through the 
list by moving your head up and down until you see the command you 
want. Start the app by speaking the command you see onscreen.
	
✓	Tap the app’s card in the timeline (refer to Figure 12-5).
If you download and install the Compass app, for example, you start it from 
the timeline by saying “OK Glass, start Compass.” The Compass app screen 
appears, showing the direction in which you’re facing (see Figure 12-6).
	
Figure 12-6: 
The 
Compass 
app shows 
that you’re 
facing north.
	
Get Some Friendly Advice
At this writing, the Glassware page of the MyGlass website doesn’t include 
user reviews. But there’s an easy way to find out what apps other Glass users 
are using and what they think of those apps: Visit the Google+ website at 
http://plus.google.com.
When a Glass user shares pictures or video of a running Glass app in a 
Google+ post, the #throughglass hashtag is added to the post automati­
cally. So the next time you visit Google+ on your computer or smartphone, 
search for #throughglass, and you’ll find a lot of posts by other Glass 
users (see Figure 12-7).

ust like any other piece of technology, Glass isn’t a piece of artwork that’s 
meant only to be stared at through a protective translucent box. (If you 
want to do that, of course, feel free.) Glass is designed to be used — and used 
so that it enhances the life of the person who wears it.
The old promise that technology will make our lives easier doesn’t mean that 
we don’t have to take time out of our lives to get the latest operating-system 
(OS) updates that add new features and fix bugs. At least Google has made 
updating as easy and unobtrusive as possible. You can do the job yourself or 
let Glass do the work, as you see in this chapter.
	
Whether you update manually or automatically, never power off Glass during 
an update process. If you do, when you turn your Glass back on, you may find 
that the OS isn’t working properly, and you may also have lost data stored on 
the device.
Letting Glass Update Itself
Like any other modern OS, the Glass OS can download updates by itself. 
Glass connects to the Google servers periodically for updates, and if it finds 
one, the device downloads the update automatically.

Part IV: Give More Power to Your Glass 
Your Glass won’t install updates automatically, however, unless Wi-Fi is 
enabled and the device is charged. When you plug Glass into the charger, the 
device updates the OS (if an update is available) while it charges the battery.
	
Before you charge the battery, be sure that the display is off and that you have 
a Wi-Fi connection enabled (such as through a wireless router on your home 
network). If Glass is off, the device will turn on when you start to charge it.
	
Glass installs OS updates as soon as its battery is 50 percent charged, so you 
don’t need to worry about fully charging Glass to get updates.
Finding out what got installed
New OS updates may include some new features that you see right away. 
Other improvements happen under the hood and aren’t readily apparent. 
Google gives you two ways to find out everything you need to know about 
the latest (and past) updates: Google+ and release notes.
Get updates on Google+
View the latest information about Glass, including update features, on the 
Google+ Glass page at http://plus.google.com/+GoogleGlass. If you 
want to get new information about Glass features before they’re announced 
to the general public, you can visit the MyGlass page (www.google.com/
myglass) and read messages in the Explorer forums.
Read the release notes
Visit the Google Glass support page at https://support.google.com/
glass. When you open the page, here’s what to do:
	
1.	In the Exploring Glass section, click or tap Frequently Asked 
Questions.
	
	 A column of FAQ links appears on the right side of the page.
	
2.	In the FAQ links column, click or tap Release Notes.
	
	 The Release Notes page appears, displaying a link to the release notes 
for the latest version.
	
	 You can also view archived release notes for earlier updates by clicking 
or tapping the Archive link and then clicking or tapping the release-
notes link for the appropriate version.

 Chapter 13: Upgrading Your Glass
Checking the OS version
Checking the version of the Glass OS that’s installed on your device is easy. 
All you have to do is tap the Settings card in the timeline and then view the 
Device Info Settings card onscreen.
The Device Info Settings card (see Figure 13-1) tells you whether you have 
the latest OS, whether an update is available, and how much storage space is 
available; it also lists the serial number of your Glass.
	
Figure 13-1: 
The Device 
Info Settings 
card tells 
you when 
the OS is up 
to date.
	
If an update is available, you can prepare to charge your Glass and update 
the OS at the same time (refer to “Letting Glass Update Itself” earlier in this 
chapter).
Updating Glass Manually
If you know that the latest OS update is available and you want to get it 
right away, such as to fix a bug that’s been. . . well, bugging you, you can. 
Here’s how:
	
1.	Open the Settings bundle card on the timeline.
	
2.	Tap the Device Info Settings card.

Hacking Your Glass
In This Chapter
▶	Giving users the best experience in your Glass app
▶	Deciding how to develop a Glass app
▶	Submitting your Glassware for inclusion on the MyGlass website
If you give a hacker a new toy, the first thing he’ll do is take it apart to figure 
out how it works.
— Jamie Zawinski
W

hen desktop computers were new and exciting (in the 1970s and 1980s), 
the term hack appeared in the computing lexicon. If you were a hacker 
who hacked a computer, it meant that you were able to figure out how to make 
the computer do useful, interesting, and/or unexpected things that you would 
share with others. Your hack inspired others to hack more computers and do 
more useful things. These days, however, the terms hack and hacker have nega­
tive connotations.
Glass brings new, exciting technology to the computing realm, so when we 
say hacking in this chapter, we mean teaching Glass new tricks, building 
something useful, and inspiring other Glass app developers.
Google wants as many people as possible to develop Glassware — apps 
for Glass — because (blunt honesty alert) if more Glassware is available, 
more people are likely to buy Glass. What’s more, if you offer good-quality 
Glassware, your chances of submitting even more Glassware to the MyGlass 
website go up.
www.it-ebooks.info

150
Part IV: Give More Power to Your Glass 
Giving Users What They Want
Glass has some specific user interface requirements that you need to follow, 
not only to create a great app, but also to give users the features they expect 
after they’ve used other Glass apps.
	
Don’t just port an app written for a smartphone, tablet, or laptop to Glass, 
because the user interfaces for those other devices are fundamentally 
­different from the Glass user interface.
	
Keep three main design principles at the top of your mind as you create 
your app:
	
✓	Ensure that the information on the screen doesn’t distract the user from 
what’s going on in the real world in front of him.
	
✓	Show information that’s relevant and timely.
	
✓	Use an interface that integrates both visual and audial models.
Unobtrusive display
Glass is designed to provide quick information that adds to what the user is 
experiencing in real life. Too much information, however, subtracts from the 
user’s experience. Users are looking at real life as well as information on the 
Glass screen, so it’s important to make the information displayed on your 
Glassware as unobtrusive as possible.
One good example of how to use the Glass interface correctly is Google 
Search. If a user searches for jellyfish while viewing the creatures in an aquar­
ium, for example, a brief definition of jellyfish appears on her Glass screen 
just above her line of sight (see Figure 14-1). The definition doesn’t detract 
from her view of the jellyfish in the aquarium tank in front of her.
	
Figure 14-1: 
A search 
result 
appears 
slightly 
above what 
the user 
sees in real 
life.
	
www.it-ebooks.info

151
 Chapter 14: Hacking Your Glass
What’s more, information provided at inappropriate times will likely cause 
users to remove your Glassware. . .and tell all their friends to avoid it, too. 
Consider the example shown in Figure 14-2. The user wakes up very early 
in the morning and puts on his Glass to see what’s going on. A few seconds 
later, he sees an ad for a cabbage sale.
	
Figure 14-2: 
A cabbage 
sale can 
be good or 
bad news, 
depending 
on your 
audience.
	
Chances are pretty good that most users don’t need cabbage at 3:37 a.m., 
and most grocery stores are closed at that time anyway. If the user regu­
larly shops at a 24-hour supermarket, however, and needs to get cabbage 
for the day’s holiday meal right away, the ad may be appropriate. Your app 
can use the GPS connection between your app and your smartphone to 
“see” that the user is in or near the store and display information about 
that cabbage sale.
Relevant information
The information on the screen should be both current and relevant to what 
the user is seeing on her Glass so she’s convinced that your Glassware is 
important. If the user isn’t convinced, she won’t let your wares take up valu­
able storage space on her Glass.
If a user needs to pop over to the grocery store to pick up some dinner, for 
example, she can use the Evernote app to display the shopping list on the 
Glass screen. This app saves the Glass user time because she doesn’t have 
to fumble for her smartphone or a handwritten list to find out what’s needed. 
Instead, she can focus on shopping.

152
Part IV: Give More Power to Your Glass 
Voice control
Users are going to use their voices to manipulate Glass and Glassware, so it’s 
important to implement a visual and audial user model. After all, a user can 
start any app by using his voice, and there are plenty of examples about how 
to use voice control within an app. Figure 14-3, for example, shows the use of 
voice control in the Google Search app.
	
Figure 14-3: 
The Google 
Search app.
	
	
If you’re going to include voice interaction in your Glassware, keep in mind the 
Glass rule that a voice command or message is initiated or sent after the user 
stops talking.
Choosing a Development Environment
You can use two types of development environments to build your Glassware: 
the Glass Development Kit (GDK) and the Mirror application programming 
interface (API).
Google produces the GDK so that you can build your Glassware directly on 
your Glass — useful if you want to use features such as location, sensors, and 
voice input. With GDK development, you can do basically the same things 
that you would on an Android smartphone or tablet, but your app needs to 
be designed to meet specific Glass user-interface requirements, discussed in 
“Giving Users What They Want” earlier in this chapter.
If you want to build web-based services that you can use to interact with 
Glass, use the Mirror API instead. This technology stores your Glassware 
code on the web so that you don’t need to run the Glass app on Glass. 
Instead, your web-based service accesses your app code in the cloud and 
shows its information on the Glass screen.
www.it-ebooks.info

153
 Chapter 14: Hacking Your Glass
	
If you develop a Glassware app with GDK and want to run that Glassware from 
a card on Glass, you can use the Mirror API to insert the card into the timeline. 
Then your users have it easy: They can just select the Glassware web app’s 
card in the timeline and choose the app name from the menu.
Looking into the Mirror
Google recommends that you use the Mirror API to start developing your 
Glassware because you can write the code in a variety of programming lan­
guages, such as Java, PHP, and .NET.
	
Before you start, check out the Quick Start demo project to see how Mirror 
API code works (discussed later in this section) and get cues for building your 
own Glassware from that sample code. You can view the Quick Start project on 
your smartphone, tablet, or computer.
	
You need to have an existing web server so you can run your Glassware. 
You also need to know the address of the website where your Glassware 
project is stored so you can access that website from Glass and test your 
Glassware.
Start by visiting the Google Developers website to find Quick Start projects in 
each of the six programming languages that Google uses for the mobile API:
	
✓	Go: https://developers.google.com/glass/quickstart/go
	
✓	Java: https://developers.google.com/glass/quickstart/java
	
✓	.NET: https://developers.google.com/glass/quickstart/dotnet
	
✓	PHP: https://developers.google.com/glass/quickstart/php
	
✓	Python: https://developers.google.com/glass/quickstart/
python
	
✓	Ruby: https://developers.google.com/glass/quickstart/ruby
Each website tells you how to access the Quick Start project for that lan­
guage. For this example, we look at the Quick Start project that shows you 
how basic functions work in the Mirror API.
Here’s how to find and run the project that tests the Mirror API functionality 
on Glass:
	
1.	Navigate to https://glass-java-starter-demo.appspot.com in 
your web browser.
	
	 An OAuth 2.0 permission request screen appears.
	
2.	Type the account username and password.
	
	 This account should be the same account that you use to access Glass.

Part IV: Give More Power to Your Glass 
	
3.	Click or tap the OK button.
	
4.	Look at the controls of the project website, shown in Figure 14-4, and 
experiment with the features of the Mirror API.
	
	 The timeline items appear on the Glass screen.
	
Figure 14-4: 
The timeline 
section 
allows you 
to insert 
a text 
message, 
picture, or 
card into

Building from the kit
The Glass Development Kit (GDK) is for people who already know how to 
develop apps for the Android operating system and want to get building. 
Even if you’re a seasoned Android developer, the differences in the Glass user 
interface create a learning curve.
Setting up the GDK
These instructions presume that you already have the ADT (Android 
Developer Tools) bundle installed and running on the computer you use 
to develop software. If you don’t, download the ADT from the Android 
Developers website at http://developer.android.com/sdk/
installing/bundle.html.
www.it-ebooks.info

155
 Chapter 14: Hacking Your Glass
With that out of the way, here’s how to set up GDK within the ADT bundle 
window:
	
1.	Click Window on the menu bar.
	
2.	Click Android SDK Manager.
	
	 The Android SDK Manager window appears.
	
3.	In the Android 4.0.3 (API 15) section, check the boxes labeled 
SDK Platform and Glass Development Kit Sneak Peek, as shown in 
Figure 14-5.
	
	 The ADT bundle installs both items.
Figure 14-5: 
Select SDK 
Platform 
and GDK 
Sneak Peek.
Connecting Glass to the GDK
To connect your Glass to the GDK, follow these steps:
	
1.	Put your Glass on your head, if you haven’t done so already.
	
2.	Select the Settings card.
	
3.	Select the Device Info Settings card.
	
4.	Tap Debug.
www.it-ebooks.info

156
Part IV: Give More Power to Your Glass 
	
When you’re set up, you can verify the connection between your Glass and 
the GDK by opening the Eclipse app on your computer. This app allows you 
to create apps in a variety of languages, such as Java, Python, PHP, and C. You 
can confirm that Glass and the GDK are connected from within the Eclipse app 
by following these steps:
	
1.	Choose Window➪Open Perspective➪DDMS.
	
	 The DDMS window opens.
	
2.	Verify that Glass is listed on the Devices tab.
Checking out sample Glassware
If you want to see examples of what Glassware looks like, the GDK contains 
several sample files for you to play with. Here’s how to find and launch them 
on your computer within the Eclipse app window:
	
1.	Choose File➪New Project➪Android Sample Project.
	
	 The Android Sample Project window appears.
	
2.	Check the Glass Development Kit box, and click Next.
	
3.	Check the box next to the name of the sample you want to run.
	
	 You can choose the Compass, Stopwatch, or Time sample.
	
4.	Click Finish.
	
	 You return to the Eclipse app window.
	
5.	Right-click the sample name in the list and choose Run As from the 
contextual menu.
	
	 A new window opens, asking whether you want to run the app on your 
computer within the Glass emulator or on the Glass device that’s con­
nected to your computer.
	
6.	Click Glass Device.
	
	 You see the sample Glassware running on the Glass screen.
Getting to work
When you’ve finished inspecting the sample files, put this book down and visit 
the Google Developers website so you can go through the interactive Building 
Your First App tutorial at http://developer.android.com/training/
basics/firstapp/index.html. You can also explore the Developers web­
site to see whether the other tutorials on the site strike your fancy.
	
You should build a few simple Glassware apps before you start building the 
Glassware of your dreams. Practice gives you the experience you need to pre­
vent development headaches later.

157
 Chapter 14: Hacking Your Glass
Submitting Your Glassware to Google
When you’re satisfied that the Glassware you’ve developed is ready for 
users, submit it for inspection at the Glassware Distribution page (https://
developers.google.com/glass/distribute/index).
Naturally, Google wants all the software it offers in MyGlass to be high-
quality. To meet that goal, it requires developers to follow a launch checklist, 
which includes the following items:
	
✓	Review the app to ensure that it reflects Google’s best practices for 
Glassware development. You can get the latest information about best 
practices at https://developers.google.com/glass/design/
best-practices.
	
✓	Follow Google’s branding and writing requirements, such as writing 
Glassware descriptions in English.
	
✓	If your site has a website that you use to promote your Glassware, follow 
Google’s requirements for designing the site.
	
✓	Confirm that you tested the Glassware on your Glass by using the soft­
ware as users would.
	
✓	Provide graphics and screen shots that can be used to promote your 
Glassware.
If you’re not intimidated by this partial list, you can read the entire check­
list of requirements at https://developers.google.com/glass/
distribute/checklist.
	
As with any task that goes through a checklist review, the review process will 
go more quickly if you meet all these requirements to a T.
Using only the Android SDK with Glass
The GDK gives you an all-access pass to Glass 
features. You can create Android apps by using 
just the Android Software Development Kit 
(SDK) on Glass, however, because Glass runs 
a version of the Android operating system. 
If you want to find out how to do this, and 
understand the benefits and pitfalls involved, 
you can find a good presentation on the 
Google Developers website at https://
developers.google.com/events/
io/sessions/332704837.

Glass Problems
In This Chapter
▶	Coping with common concerns
▶	Fitting Glass comfortably
▶	Fixing app and feature problems
▶	Going to Google for help
We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when

— Albert Einstein
T

hough it doesn’t look like any other computer, Glass is still a computer, 
and that means you’ll have some problems with it from time to time. 
Many of these problems are small and correctable, so you may want to book­
mark this chapter for future reference.
Fixing Common Wonkiness
If your Glass is acting wonky (wonky is a technical term), here are some 
­solutions to try for different situations.
Wi-Fi worries
If your Wi-Fi connection isn’t working, you can forget it by following these steps:
	
1.	Tap the Settings card in the timeline.
	
2.	In the Settings screen, open the Options menu by tapping the touchpad.
www.it-ebooks.info

162
Part V: Maintaining Your Glass 
	
3.	Choose Forget Connection from the menu.
	
	 Glass immediately forgets the connection so that you can add the Wi-Fi 
connection again or try another one.
	
For details on Wi-Fi setup, see Chapter 5.
Tethering troubles
If you’re using Glass with your Android smartphone or iPhone to connect to a 
cellphone provider’s Internet network, you know that when your Wi-Fi connec­
tion isn’t available, you can use your tethered data connection to the provid­
er’s network. (That is, you can if you’re in range of a cellphone tower’s signal.)
If your Glass says that you’re connected to the Internet but you can’t do any­
thing Internet-related, such as browse the web or check your e-mail inbox, 
you can forget the data connection in much the same way that you can a 
Wi-Fi connection. Then you can restart the data connection and see whether 
your Glass can use the Internet.
On an Android smartphone
If you have an Android smartphone, here’s how to forget the data connection 
and restart it:
	
1.	Tap the Settings card in the timeline.
	
2.	Tap the More Settings card.
	
3.	Tap Mobile Networks.
	
4.	Turn off your data connection by clearing the check box in the Data 
Enabled section.
	
5.	Wait about 20 seconds and then reestablish the data connection by 
checking the Data Enabled check box.
On an iPhone
If you have an iPhone, here’s how to turn the data connection off and 
on again:
	
1.	Open the Settings screen.
	
2.	Tap Cellular.
	
3.	Swipe the Cellular Data button from right to left.
	
4.	Wait about 20 seconds and then reestablish the data connection by 
swiping the Cellular Data button from left to right.
www.it-ebooks.info

163
 Chapter 15: Troubleshooting Common Glass Problems
	
If you’re using another computing device that has a working Internet 
­connection — such as a tablet, laptop, or desktop computer — you can 
also  check for documentation on the device provider’s website.
Bluetooth bummers
If your Glass is telling you that you made that left turn in Albuquerque and 
now you’re in Los Angeles when you’re actually in a bullfighting ring, the 
Bluetooth connection with your smartphone isn’t working correctly. You can 
apply any of three potential remedies:
	
✓	On your smartphone, turn Bluetooth off. When Glass tells you that the 
Bluetooth connection is forgotten, you can reestablish the connection 
with your smartphone (see Chapter 6).
	
✓	Turn off your smartphone and then turn it back on. When you turn off 
the phone, you immediately lose the Bluetooth connection, but the 
smartphone will find the Glass Bluetooth connection after you turn it 
back on.
	
✓	If you’re using the MyGlass app on your smartphone (see Chapter 5), 
quit the app and then restart it.
General glitches
One good fix for any misbehaving computing device is to close it down and 
restart it. Glass is no different. You can hard-reset the device by holding your 
finger on the power button for 15 seconds, no matter what you’re viewing 
onscreen. After 15 seconds, you hear a higher-to-lower chime. Release the 
touchpad. When Glass turns off, wait a few seconds, turn Glass back on, and 
see whether the problem is solved.
If not, the last resort is to perform a factory reset that restores Glass to its 
original factory settings. Here’s how:
	
1.	Tap the Settings card in the timeline.
	
2.	Tap the Device Info Settings card.
	
3.	Choose Factory Reset from the menu.
	
	 A warning onscreen tells you that you’ll lose all data unless you’ve 
backed up that data to an external source such as Google+ Auto Backup 
(see Chapter 8).
www.it-ebooks.info

164
Part V: Maintaining Your Glass 
	
If you want to save any data stored on your Glass, such as pictures and videos, 
be sure to check your Google+ Auto Backup account on another device, such 
as your smartphone or computer, to confirm the photos and videos are there.
Begin the restoration process by selecting Yes on the screen. After your 
device’s factory settings are restored, you can start setting up your accounts, 
connections, and apps. To find out how to set up Glass, see Chapter 3.
Fitting Glass to Your Face
As with any pair of glasses, you may have trouble wearing Glass at first. You 
may also find damage associated with normal wear and tear. Here are some 
ideas for solving various problems related to putting Glass on your head.
Finding the Goldilocks fit
If you wear eyeglasses, chances are that you’ll have a good idea how to fit 
Glass on your head comfortably because you’re used to adjusting your eye­
glasses. But if you can’t get the right fit no matter what you try, or if you’re 
not used to wearing glasses, consider trying one or more of the following 
solutions:
	
✓	If you’re picking up your Glass at a Google Base Camp in New York, Los 
Angeles, or San Francisco, find out whether you can get fitted there after 
you purchase the device online. Also check to see whether you can get 
refitted at that Base Camp later, if necessary.
	
✓	Visit the Google Glass Help site or call a Glass Guide for live help (see 
“Getting Help from Google” later in this chapter).
	
✓	Consider getting a new frame for your Glass that may provide a more 
comfortable fit. We cover changing frames in Chapter 11.
Getting accustomed to your Glass
Your eyes and your brain aren’t used to having a screen right in front of them, 
so you may experience pain in your head — not only from an ill-positioned 
Glass, but also from eyestrain as you try to get used to the Glass experience.
Using Glass is like exercising. When you start an exercise program to get fit, 
you don’t run a marathon right away. Likewise, you don’t use Glass for hours 
at a time right away. Instead, use your Glass for short periods at first, adding 
a few minutes each day. Any time you feel uncomfortable, take Glass off, and 
wear it again when you feel like it.
www.it-ebooks.info

165
 Chapter 15: Troubleshooting Common Glass Problems
Fixing a crack in the frame
Glass is a pretty sturdy device, but like any pair of glasses, it’s subject to 
wear and tear over time. One common signal of wear is a crack in the frame, 
especially near joints such as those between the frame and nose pads.
When you find a crack in the frame, here are some solutions you can try:
	
✓	Visit the Glass Community (https://www.glass-community.com) 
to find out what solutions other users have employed. You may also 
want to take a picture of the crack with your smartphone and post it 
on the site to see whether any users and/or Glass Guides can provide 
suggestions.
	
✓	Contact a Glass Guide by phone or e-mail to get some ideas. The Guide 
may want to start a Google Hangout on your computer or smartphone 
so he or she can see exactly what the problem is and offer solutions. 
(For more on Hangouts, see Chapter 9.)
	
✓	If all else fails, the Guide may arrange to have Google ship you a 
­replacement frame.
For more information, see “Getting Help from Google” later in this chapter.
Resolving Operation Errors
If you find that certain functions aren’t working on Glass as described in 
this book, here are some ideas for resolving problems with different features 
and apps.
I see dead pixels
Google works hard to ensure that all the pixels on each Glass function prop­
erly when the device comes out of the factory. As with any technology, how­
ever, problems happen, and you may be the unlucky owner of a Glass that 
has one or more dead pixels. Dead, in this context, means that the pixels are 
black or unlit no matter what comes up onscreen. At best, dead pixels are 
really annoying; at worst, they obscure important information.
If you see dead pixels, don’t hesitate to visit the Google Glass Help site and 
contact a Glass Guide (see “Getting Help from Google” later in this chapter). 
Google offers a 30-day warranty, so if your Glass is damaged or not working 
correctly, move quickly to get a replacement device.

Part V: Maintaining Your Glass 
My map is frozen
Sometimes, an app stalls after an upgrade. You may see stalling issues with 
the Maps app after an update, for example, because of Bluetooth synchroni­
zation issues between your Glass and your smartphone.
The solution is straightforward: On your smartphone, turn off Bluetooth. 
When Glass tells you that the Bluetooth connection is forgotten, reestablish 
the Bluetooth connection on your smartphone.
Callers sound like they’re underwater
Glass uses bone-conduction transducer (BCT) technology in its speaker. BCT 
picks up the vibrations from your skull to help improve call quality. You may 
have heard of BCT because it’s used in smartphones, earbuds, and head­
phones as well.
Despite this technology, you may still have trouble hearing people on the 
phone, especially in noisy areas. You can take some steps to fix this problem:
	
✓	Reposition the speaker. Check the position of the speaker to ensure 
that it comes up right against your ear. The speaker works best when it’s 
right up against your ear.
	
✓	Turn up the volume. If the voice you’re listening to is too soft, tap the 
Settings card in the timeline and then tap the Volume Settings card to 
view and change the volume.
	
	This procedure may seem to be elementary, but when you’re in a loud 
place and your caller’s voice is suddenly too soft, you may not think to 
turn up the volume.
	
✓	Connect the earbuds that came with your Glass to the device. The ear­
buds include printed instructions that tell you how to connect them to 
Glass.
	
✓	Move. If you still can’t hear the person adequately with either the 
speaker or the earbud, consider placing your hand over your free ear 
and/or moving to a quieter location.
If all else fails, ask a Glass Guide to talk you through more troubleshooting 
steps (see “Getting Help from Google” later in this chapter).

 Chapter 15: Troubleshooting Common Glass Problems
I have files and I can’t back up
If you can’t use the Auto Backup feature to back up one or more files from 
your Glass to your Google+ Auto Backup account, here are some ideas:
	
✓	Turn off your Glass, turn it back on, and see whether Auto Backup works 
the way you expect.
	
✓	If you have a large number of files to back up, especially pictures and 
videos that take up a lot of space, these files back up automatically when 
you charge your Glass while the device has an active Wi-Fi connection.
	
	When you try to back up while Glass is running on battery power, the 
backup process goes much more slowly, and the battery may run out of 
power before the backup is completed.
	
✓	Check your Google+ account settings to ensure that you have enough 
space in your Auto Backup account to accommodate all the files you 
want to back up. The default amount of space in your backup account 
is 15GB. You should receive a notification from Google when you’re run­
ning low on space, but if you don’t (or if you’re just curious about how 
much room you have left), you can find out how to pay for 100GB and 
200GB plans at https://www.google.com/settings/storage.
	
✓	Connect your Glass to your computer and then sync your pictures, 
videos, and other files to your computer (see the next section).
Pictures and video won’t sync 
to my computer
When you connect your computer to your Glass by using the micro USB cable 
that’s included with Glass, your computer should recognize Glass as another 
external storage device and display it in your list of storage devices. Though 
the days of “Plug ’n’ Pray” are over, there may be times when your computer 
can’t find Glass when it’s connected to your computer. If you have this problem, 
here are some solutions to try:
	
✓	Remove the micro USB cable from the computer, wait a few seconds, and 
then connect the cable to a different USB port on the computer.
	
✓	Turn off Glass, remove the micro USB cable from the computer, turn 
Glass back on, and then connect the cable to the same or a different USB 
port on the computer.
	
✓	If you can’t use your computer’s file-management app (such as File 
Explorer on a Windows PC or Finder on a Mac), try using another app to 
move the files.

	You can use Google’s Picasa image-editing software, for example. It’s 
web-based, it recognizes Glass automatically when you have the device 
connected to your computer with a micro USB cable, and it allows you 
to move your photos between your Glass and your computer.
If none of these solutions solves your problem, you may have a defective 
micro USB cable. Contact a Glass Guide (see the next section) to find out 
whether the cable needs to be replaced.

Keeping Your Glass in 
Top Condition
In This Chapter
▶	Treating the device with care
▶	Keeping Glass fully charged
▶	Upgrading the operating system
Success is a science; if you have the conditions, you get the result.
— Oscar Wilde
G

  lass is a rugged piece of technology that can handle the rigors of day-to-day 
use. Over and over every day, you put Glass on and take it off, press 
your finger to the touchpad, and use the camera to take plenty of pictures and 
videos.
As with any other piece of technology, you need to know how to treat your 
device kindly so you can enjoy it for years to come. For one thing, you need 
to protect it from various hazards. The frame (and perhaps more) will break if 
you forget to take Glass off your couch before your large indoor dog sits on it. 
(And the dog will sit on it.)
You also need to know how to store Glass properly, purchase genuine Glass 
replacement parts, keep the device fully charged, and keep the operating 
system updated so you can get the most out of your device. We show you 
how in this chapter.
Handling Glass with Care
As with any other product, the performance of your Glass depends on how 
well you take care of it. Glass has several sensitive parts that you must treat 
with care. Fortunately, the device comes with its own pouch so you can store 
your Glass safely when you’re finished using it.
www.it-ebooks.info

172
Part V: Maintaining Your Glass 
Keep it right side up
Don’t take off Glass and leave it upside down. Why, you ask? You may think 
that Glass is like any other pair of glasses. It’s not. For one thing, it’s heavier 
than a regular pair of glasses. Also, positioning is important. When you put 
your Glass on, the camera and screen unit are on the right side of the device. 
If you place the device upside down, as shown in Figure 16-1, especially on a 
hard surface, its weight will press the Camera button — and Glass will take 
pictures and record video even if it’s turned off. The next time you put on 
your Glass, you could find that it’s storing a lot of pictures or a long video 
that you didn’t expect. Worse, taking those pictures and videos may have 
drained your battery completely.
	
Figure 16-1: 
When 
you rest 
your Glass 
upside 
down, the 
device 
presses 
down on 
the Camera 
button.
	
What’s more, if you don’t have a Glass shield and constantly leave your Glass 
on a hard surface, the nose pads will move slightly, and in time, the device 
won’t feel comfortable anymore. (For details on where to get a shield, see 
Chapter 11.)
	
If you connect the micro USB cable that came with your Glass to your charger, 
Glass will rest the right way while you’re charging it.
Watch the weather forecast
Glass is sensitive to the elements, so don’t take it out in the rain or on a 
humid day (especially in the Southern or Midwestern United States in the 
summer).
www.it-ebooks.info

173
 Chapter 16: Keeping Your Glass in Top Condition
Even if no actual rain is falling, or if you put a hoodie on over your Glass, 
water can condense within the unit. Then you may find that Glass isn’t work­
ing right. It may just shut itself off, for example. Putting Glass in dry rice 
won’t solve the problem.
What’s more, the reflective foil around the screen cube may ripple or pos­
sibly tear in high humidity. If the foil ripples, you’re going to have a much 
harder time seeing the Glass screen; if the foil tears, you won’t be able to see 
the screen at all.
	
At this writing, Google hasn’t published temperature limits for Glass, but you 
can always get the latest tech specs for the device at https://support.
google.com/glass/answer/3064128?hl=en&ref_topic=3063354.
Store it in a pouch
Glass comes with a pouch (see Figure 16-2) that protects it from scratches, 
dust, and the elements. The bottom of the pouch contains a hard protective 
shell, so if you drop the pouch, your Glass will still be protected. The pouch 
stores Glass safely with or without a protective shield (see Chapter 11).
	
Figure 16-2: 
A closed 
Glass 
pouch.
	
www.it-ebooks.info

174
Part V: Maintaining Your Glass 
If you misplace your pouch or want to get an extra for use at another location 
(one for home and one for the office, for example), you can purchase another 
pouch from the Glass Store at https://glass.google.com/getglass.
	
Don’t panic if you don’t find a pouch in the Glass Store; the item may be 
­temporarily out of stock. Check back another day.
Empowering Your Glass
You should always keep your Glass charged and updated, even if you’re not 
going to be using it. Otherwise, you may miss interesting moments because 
your battery has run out of power or you haven’t installed an upgrade.
When you took your Glass out of the box for the first time, you probably saw 
that it came with a charger unit and a micro USB cable. The cable and charger 
are two-tone so that you know the correct way to place the cable. The micro 
USB port on your Glass is white on the bottom, so you can match the white at 
the bottom of the port to the white portion of the cable.
On your cable (see Figure 16-3), one side of the port is white, which tells 
you to insert the white side of the micro USB cable into the white side of the 
power port on your Glass; the white side of the cable appears on the outside 
of your Glass.
	
Figure 16-3: 
One side of 
the cable 
port is 
white, to 
plug into the 
charger; the 
other side 
plugs into 
the Glass 
device.

175
 Chapter 16: Keeping Your Glass in Top Condition
You’ll know that it’s time to charge Glass when you see the empty-battery 
icon on the Glass screen (see Figure 16-4). As Glass charges to full power, the 
LED near the power button pulsates slowly, and the battery icon updates the 
charge-percentage status. When the screen says the charge is at 100 percent, 
the battery is fully charged, and Glass is ready for you to unplug and use.
	
Figure 16-4: 
The empty-
battery icon 
tells you 
that Glass 
needs to be 
charged.
	
	
You can also charge Glass (as well as transfer files) by plugging the micro USB 
cable into an available USB port on your computer.
Whether you charge Glass by using the charger or your computer, if you’re 
in range of a Wi-Fi network, Glass automatically updates its operating system 
and synchronizes new photos and videos with your Google+ Auto Backup 
account. For details on updating the operating system, see Chapter 13.
	
If you misplace your charger or need a charger for a separate location, you 
can purchase another charger from the Glass Store at https://glass.
google.com/getglass.
	
Always get a genuine Google Glass charger so you can be assured that you 
won’t be shocked by power or charging problems.

Tell everyone what you want to do and someone will want to help you do it.
— W. Clement Stone
Y

ou may have turned to this chapter because you’re having a problem 
with your Glass and none of the suggestions in other chapters in this 
book has solved it, or you may just want to familiarize yourself with the sup­
port options you have available.
Google offers plenty of help options, as you see in this chapter.
Checking Out the FAQs
The Google Glass Help website contains several articles that answer fre­
quently asked questions (FAQs). You can view the FAQs in various catego­
ries at https://support.google.com/glass. The Help page, shown in 
Figure 17-1, displays the categories. By default, the Get Started category is 
open, listing the topics within the category.
You can view topics within a category by clicking or tapping the category 
name. View more information about a topic by clicking or tapping its name in 
the list; an article on that topic appears (see Figure 17-2) so you can find out 
whether the information it contains answers your question. In some articles, 
a Next Steps section appears at the end; click or tap the links in that section 
to read articles that contain related information.

 Chapter 17: Getting Help with Glass
To the right of each help article is a list of links to related articles. Above the 
article is a gray bar, the left end of which contains a breadcrumb-style naviga­
tion system that shows where you are in the help system. The page you’re on 
appears as a highlighted link at the right end of the breadcrumb list (Help, 
in Figure 17-2), and parent page links appear to the left of the current page 
(Google Glass, in Figure 17-1). Go to the page by clicking or tapping the link in 
the breadcrumb list.
	
You can also search for a particular topic by typing the character(s) and/or 
word(s) in the Search Google Glass Help box at the top of any page on the help 
website. After you type the character(s) or word(s), begin searching by click­
ing or tapping the blue search button to the right of the search box.
Going to Google for Help
If you can’t find the answer to your question on the Google Glass Help 
­website, you have two ways to contact a Glass Guide by phone: Call Google 
directly, or visit the help website and ask a Glass Guide to call you.
Calling Google
Call Google at (800) GLASSXE — which is (800) 452-7793 if you don’t like to 
hunt and peck on your telephone keypad. Glass Guides are available by phone 
every day from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. Pacific time. The only exception to this rule is 
during the winter holiday season from December 20 through January 4. Check 
the Google Glass Help website at https://support.google.com/glass/
answer/3079854 to get the latest news about phone availability.
	
When you purchased your Glass, you received your unique Glass ID in an 
e-mail message sent to the address you provided Google. You need to have 
this Glass ID at the ready so that the Glass Guide can identify you, call up your 
Glass information, and help you more effectively.
Requesting a call from a Glass Guide
One of life’s axioms is that when you talk to technical support, you have to 
wait. Google gets around this problem by offering to have a Glass Guide call 
you when one is available. You need to log into your Google account and then 
visit the Google Glass Help website to get started. Next, follow these steps:
	
1.	Click or tap the Contact Us link in the top-right corner of the Support 
home page.
	
	 The Contact Us page appears, as shown in Figure 17-3.
www.it-ebooks.info

2.	Click or tap the Call Us button.
	
3.	Type your name, e-mail address, and phone number in the appropriate 
fields.
	
	 The estimated time before a Guide will call you appears below the phone 
number (see Figure 17-4).
	
4.	Click or tap the Call Me button.
	
	 A new screen appears, thanking you for submitting the form and telling 
you that a Glass Guide will call you shortly.
	
The estimated time for a Glass Guide to call you is just an estimate. It may take 
less or more time for a Guide to call. Be sure to stay near your phone (or take 
your phone with you) and have the ringer turned on.

Asking for help by e-mail
If your problem isn’t a pressing one, and you prefer to talk with a Glass Guide 
online instead of on the phone, Google gives you two options. The first option 
is to send an e-mail message to glass-support@google.com. The other 
option is to fill out a contact form on the Google Glass Help website, like so:
	
1.	Visit http://support.google.com/glass.
	
2.	Click or tap the Contact Us link in the top-right corner of the page.
	
3.	In the resulting page, click or tap the Contact Form link (see 
Figure 17-5).
	
	 The contact form opens.
	
4.	Fill out the contact form (see Figure 17-6).
	
	 Items with an asterisk after them are required; you must fill in these 
boxes for Google to accept the form. If you don’t fill in a required box, 
the form reappears, listing the boxes you need to fill in.

Turning to the Glass User Community
You may be able to get information about any problems you have from other 
Glass users and from Google itself. The Glass Community website is the place 
to exchange messages with other Glass users if you have a problem or you 
want to discuss experiences. Google also maintains a Google Glass profile on 
Google+ so you can get the latest information and operating-system updates 
for Glass.
Glass Community
You can send messages to and receive messages from other Glass users 
at the online Glass Community, available at https://www.glass-

sages in a variety of categories.
The community home page, shown in Figure 17-7, is divided into two 
sections:
	
✓	The left side of the screen contains several tiles of information you may 
be interested in. The Top Kudoed Posts tile, for example, represents the

Ten Apps You Need to “See”
In This Chapter
▶	Getting the best Google apps for Glass
▶	Connecting with others
▶	Putting utilities to work
▶	Enjoying game play and leisure apps
Man’s greatness consists in his ability to do and the proper application of his 
powers to things needed to be done.
— Frederick Douglass
A

t the time this book was written, fewer than 100 apps were available for 
Glass, but the fact that even that many apps were available for a project 
still in the development and testing stage attests to the excitement generated 
by this new type of computing device. By now, you may have hundreds or 
even thousands of apps to choose among.
Even so, some of the early apps were developed for a reason: They take great 
advantage of Glass to show you the things can do to make your life better. 
Google has made several free apps available at https://glass.google.
com/glassware.
	
The apps in the Glass Store are approved for use with Glass, but those aren’t 
the only apps you can use. One good resource where you can view third-party 
apps, as well as the latest Glass updates, is the GlassAppSource website at 
www.glassappsource.com.
Google Apps
Because Glass is a Google product, it makes sense that Google made some of 
its most popular apps available for Glass on the day the device was released.
www.it-ebooks.info

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Hangouts
Hangouts (see Chapter 9) is Google’s instant-messaging (IM) app that allows 
you to connect in a live text or video chat with anyone who’s using the Hangouts 
app on a computer, tablet, or smartphone.
You can send photos to other Hangouts members while you’re on a text or 
video chat, and when you’re on a video chat, other people can see what 
you’re viewing on your Glass.
	
You should download Hangouts, not only because this app is a great use 
of Glass, but also because Glass Guides (which is what Google calls Glass 
support representatives) may ask you to engage in a Hangout if you have a 
problem.
Google Play Music
Google has its own music catalog on the Google Play website, so it probably 
comes as no surprise that Google created an app for Glass that allows you to 
access the Play Music website directly without having to visit the Google Play 
site.
You can use the Play Music app to find songs and albums, purchase songs 
and albums, and download them to Glass so you can play songs when­
ever you want without having to fumble for your smartphone and/or 
headphones.
Google makes it easy to use the Glass interface to navigate the Play Music 
­catalog. You can search by song, album, or artist. You can also create a playlist 
of your favorite songs so you can play one or more songs within that playlist.
You don’t even have to use the touchpad to listen to a song. While you’re 
viewing the timeline screen, you can just say “OK Glass, listen to. . .” followed 
by the name of the song, album, playlist, or all songs by the artist, as shown 
in Figure 18-1.
When you listen to an album or playlist, the app starts playing the first song 
in the album or playlist. If you listen to all songs by an artist, the app finds 
the first song by the artist you downloaded and starts to play that song.

YouTube
Google purchased the video-sharing website YouTube in 2006, and YouTube 
is easily one of the most popular websites today. Because taking videos is a 
popular use of Glass, Mr. Spock would agree that it’s logical that Google cre­
ated a YouTube app for Glass so you can share the videos you take on Glass 
easily.
Here’s a quick primer on how to publish your videos by using the YouTube 
app for Glass:
	
1.	Record the video or select the card in the timeline that contains the 
video you want to share.
	
2.	Tap the touchpad and then choose Share from the menu.
	
3.	Choose the channel to which you want to publish your video.
	
	 You can choose the default channel you created when you set up your 
YouTube account, or you can select another channel.
	
4.	Choose the privacy setting you want to use (see Figure 18-2).
	
	 You can choose Public (all YouTube users can watch the video), Unlisted 
(only you can watch it), or Private (only invited YouTube users can 
watch it).
	
	 The YouTube app publishes your Glass video to the channel automati­
cally. When the app finishes publishing the video, it plays the uploaded 
video so you can verify that it looks as you expect.

Figure 18-2:

public you 
want your 
video to be.
	
	
You can also verify that your video uploaded correctly by opening YouTube on 
another device, such as your computer, and opening the appropriate channel 
to see whether the video is there.
Social and Connectivity Apps
Some interesting apps let you use Glass to keep apprised of what’s happen­
ing, communicate with people who don’t speak your language, and access 
your Facebook account.
IFTTT
IFTTT (an acronym for If This Then That) lets you create connections between 
apps by saying “If this, then that.” The this part of the argument is a trigger 
such as “I’m tagged in a Facebook photo.” The that part of the argument is an 
action such as “Send me an e-mail message.” The app calls this completed 
argument a recipe that you can save and activate so that Glass will remind 
you when the trigger event occurs.
Several premade recipes are available, based in part on your current location. 
Figure 18-3, for example, shows weather recipes for a specific location.
	
If you want the IFTTT app to find your current location, you need to set up the 
MyGlass app on your smartphone (see Chapter 5) so that the app can find you 
by using the smartphone’s GPS feature.

Facebook
Facebook is as close to a ubiquitous social networking website as you can 
get. You don’t need to check your phone for Facebook updates anymore, 
because now you can get that information directly on your Glass.
The first thing you need to do is download and install the Facebook 
Glassware from the MyGlass website or get the smartphone app. After you’re 
in MyGlass, here’s what to do:
	
1.	Activate the Facebook app by clicking or tapping the Facebook card.
	
2.	If you’re not logged in to Facebook, type your Facebook username 
and password in the appropriate fields and then click or tap the Allow 
Access button.

3.	On the Glass timeline screen, select the Facebook card.
	
	 The Facebook posts appear as cards.
	
4.	View a post by tapping the appropriate card.
	
	 The post appears onscreen, as shown in Figure 18-4.

It’s easy to share photos and videos you’ve taken on Glass with your 
Facebook friends. Here’s how:
	
1.	Take a photo or video on Glass.
	
2.	Tap the touchpad.
	
3.	Choose Share from the menu.
	
4.	Choose a sharing option: Only Me, Friends, or Public (that is, every­
one on Facebook).
	
	 You can verify that your photo or video was posted to Facebook in the 
Facebook Glass app.
You can also use Facebook to share a photo or video stored on Glass by 
finding the photo or video card on the timeline and then repeating Steps 2 
through 4.
	
To find out how to take photos and videos with Glass, see Chapter 8.
Useful Utilities
Several Glass utility apps help make your life a little bit easier. Here are a 
couple of examples for you to consider.

 Chapter 18: Ten Apps You Need to “See”
Word Lens
The Word Lens app is another cool example of what you can do with Glass. 
If you have text that’s printed in another language, you can translate it into 
your preferred language, as shown in Figure 18-5. (By the way, the text in the 
figure means Welcome to the future.) All you have to do is hold your head still 
while you look at the printed page; after a few seconds, you see the transla­
tion in the top-right corner of the screen.
	
Figure 18-5: 
Translate 
onscreen 
text into 
your pre-
ferred 
language.
	
	
The text needs to be as clear as possible for the Word Lens app to translate 
the text successfully.
	
You can get the best translation results when the text is printed on a laser 
printer, in an easily recognizable font such as Arial, and at a fairly large size.
The app is self-contained, so you can translate text without using an active 
Wi-Fi connection to the Internet.
You can translate text between English and the following languages:
	
✓	French
	
✓	German
	
✓	Italian
	
✓	Portuguese
	
✓	Spanish

Stopwatch
If you find that you need to time people on a certain task, such as complet­
ing a test, you don’t need to pull out your smartphone and keep checking the 
time periodically. Instead, you can install the Glass Stopwatch app and keep 
the timer in front of your face so you can be ready to take action as soon as 
time’s up.
Here’s a how to use the Stopwatch app after you’ve installed it on Glass:
	
1.	Tap the touchpad and then choose Set Timer from the menu.
	
2.	Select the timer measurement: Hours, Minutes, or Seconds.
	
3.	Set the number of hours, minutes, or seconds the timer will run, 
depending on the measurement type you set in Step 2.
	
4.	Start the stopwatch by choosing Start from the menu, as shown in 
Figure 18-6.
	
	 You can work on other tasks on Glass while the timer is running. When 
the timer reaches zero, the speaker sounds an alarm.
	
5.	Go back to the Home screen; swipe to the left, tap the Timer card, and 
then choose Stop from the menu.

Weather Alert
When you’re out and about, you may want to know when bad weather is 
coming your way. Even on a clear day, you may need to check the air quality 
in your area. The Weather Alert app from Roll Innovation (https://glass.
whyroll.com/weatheralert/info) is a good app for getting up-to-date 
information right on the Glass screen as alerts are broadcast.
www.it-ebooks.info

197
 Chapter 18: Ten Apps You Need to “See”
	
The Weather Alert app uses National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA) data, so you can use the app only in U.S. states and territories. Also, 
not all areas of the United States are monitored, so contact Roll Innovation to 
get the latest coverage map for your area.
When a weather alert is issued, you see the alert card on the timeline screen, 
showing the type of alert, a map of the affected area, and the duration of the 
alert. This card presents only a summary of information, so if you want to 
listen to the entire alert as broadcast on NOAA weather radio, tap the touch­
pad and then choose Read Aloud from the menu. You hear the report through 
the Glass speaker.
Games and Leisure Apps
Google believes that you can play as hard as you work on Glass, so a good 
many apps allow you to enjoy your hobbies and down time. Following are a 
couple of leisure apps that you can download and check out to see whether 
they’re right for you.
Allthecooks
The Allthecooks app is almost like having a variety of cooks in the kitchen 
with you. The app gives you access to more than 150,000 recipes that 
have been added to its database by Allthecooks personnel as well as other 
Allthecooks members. You can contact those members to get feedback about 
recipes and ask questions.
When the app is running, you can say “OK Glass, find a recipe for. . .” and 
then the name of the dish you want, such as pizza (see Figure 18-7). When 
you access a recipe on Allthecooks, the recipe appears on the Glass screen in 
step-by-step format so you can prepare the recipe without having to use your 
dusty and/or greasy fingers to flip pages in a cookbook.
Figure 18-7: 
You can 
search for a 
specific dish 
to make.

198
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
The first step of each recipe tells you how long it takes to prepare, how many 
people it serves, and how much of each ingredient you need. You can move 
to the next step by swiping forward on the touchpad. If you want to go to the 
previous step, swipe backward on the touchpad.
Spellista
If you enjoy solving puzzles and/or want to give your kids a creative and 
fun way to learn to spell, consider downloading the Spellista app. This app 
contains a variety of puzzle games that challenge you to spell words based 
on clues. As you complete each game, you rack up points. The puzzles get 
increasingly difficult with each game.
What’s more, you can create your own games and share them with friends 
and family members. You can create puzzle games based on different themes 
(see Figure 18-8). You can even use your camera to create game-screen 
backgrounds.

Ten Things Not to Do with Glass
In This Chapter
▶	Wear Glass in the shower, on a date, or in bed
▶	Share inappropriate photos
▶	Touch the cube on the device
▶	Break the law or company policy by wearing Glass
The world is full of magical things patiently waiting for our wits to grow 
sharper.
— Bertrand Russell
A

s soon as early adopters of Google Glass, called Glass Explorers, began 
to wear their Glass devices out and about, the computing media started 
to comment about how they saw Explorers using their devices — and espe­
cially about how not to wear Glass in various situations.
We’ve boiled down the variety of things not to do into ten helpful tips that 
should keep you from driving people crazy, not embarrassing yourself, or both.
Shower with It
This guideline was illustrated expertly by popular tech blogger Robert 
Scoble, an early tester and proponent of Glass who showed his enthusiasm 
by taking a picture of himself with his Glass on his head while he was taking 
a shower.
www.it-ebooks.info

200
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Though Scoble was discreet, the photo didn’t exactly kindle enthusiasm among 
potential users. Instead, people (especially media people) took note that Glass 
doesn’t tell people other than the wearer that the camera is on, so the device 
could encourage all sorts of mischief. Even Google’s chief executive officer, 
Larry Page, remarked that he didn’t appreciate the shower photo despite the 
publicity.
	
You can see Scoble’s photo and read Page’s response at www.theverge.
com/2013/5/15/4333656/larry-page-teases-robert-scoble​-for-
nude-google-glass-photo.
	
What’s more, exposing Glass to moisture could result in the device’s becom­
ing inoperative, because electronic circuitry and water mix as well as cola and 
pudding. The moral of this story is to keep your reputation intact and your 
Glass safe by ensuring that you keep the device away from your shower.
Take It on a Date
For a perfect example of how not to behave on a date while using Glass, see 
the video at www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UjcqCx1Bvg. If you’d rather 
just get a summary of the video and tips on what not to do with Glass on a 
date, here you go:
	
✓	Don’t tell your date that you need Glass to see. Be honest about what 
it’s for.
	
✓	Pay attention to your date instead of searching for jokes you can tell or 
getting the latest information about the TV series Downton Abbey.
	
✓	When you think the date is becoming boring, don’t start watching sports 
highlights, play games, or take video calls.
	
✓	Your date may figure out what Google Glass is by asking Siri, Apple’s per­
sonal assistant, on the iPhone attached to her head.
In summary, take Glass off. Instead, ask your date questions, and let him or 
her talk. You’ll find out more about the other person and probably have a 
better time.

 Chapter 19: Ten Things Not to Do with Glass
Pirate a Theatrical Movie
In addition to all the good things they do, smartphones allow people to 
record movies as they’re playing in a theater and then post the movies on 
video-sharing websites such as YouTube.
Though smartphones haven’t been banned in most movie theaters, the movie 
and theater industries has responded by offering $500 to theater employees 
who identify anyone recording movies with a smartphone, call the police, and 
contact the Motion Picture Association of America through an online form 
(www.fightfilmtheft.org).
Glass makes it even easier to record movies surreptitiously, because all you’d 
have to do is turn on the video-recording feature on Glass and then sit and 
watch the movie. You don’t give away your intent by holding up your smart­
phone to watch the screen.
Though there haven’t been any Glass bans at movie theaters at this writing, 
chances are you’ll be turned away by a movie theater if an employee sees 
you sporting your Glass. Even if you put your Glass on after you enter the 
theater itself, theater workers will see the camera light that comes on while 
you’re recording. Save yourself some aggravation, and don’t be branded a 
movie pirate: Keep Glass in a safe place while you enjoy the movie.
	
Glass gets warmer the longer you use it. As you record a long video, the device 
may eventually get so hot that it overheats. The Glass circuitry likes excessive 
heat as much as any other electronic equipment does (that is, not), so unless 
you have extra money to spend on a new Glass device, overheating is another 
reason to keep Glass safe while you watch a movie.
Share Embarrassing Photos
A plethora of people still seem to think that taking naked pictures of them­
selves and sharing them with others is a good idea. The issue of “revenge 
porn,” in which angry people post private photos publicly to embarrass their 
ex-boyfriends or ex-girlfriends, has prompted the introduction of laws against 
the practice, particularly in California.
	
Even when laws are in place, keep this axiom in mind: What goes on the 
Internet stays there forever. As with any other device you can use to share 
information, people are watching, so take care about what you share.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Sleep with It
Sometimes, it’s hard to remember that you have Glass on your head because 
the device is so light and unobtrusive. If you don’t remove it when you go to 
bed, however, and you like to move around during the night, you may find 
yourself with a broken Glass frame when you wake up. (The time when you 
wake up may vary, because you may hear the frame crunching.) You can 
also break the screen by putting pressure on the cube, which fits over your 
right eye.
	
If you haven’t seen our explanation of every part of the Glass device, turn to 
Chapter 2. Then return here. Don’t worry; we’ll wait.
Even if you don’t break the frame or screen, you may put so much pressure 
on the nose pads that your Glass won’t fit properly on your face. The best-
case scenario (if you can call it that) is that you may put pressure on the 
Camera button on top of the cube, take a bunch of pictures or videos, and 
then find the battery drained.
	
If you press the Camera button when your Glass is off, the device turns on and 
starts taking pictures and/or videos. The longer it takes pictures and videos, 
the shorter its battery life is.
Touch the Cube
The discussion of the cube in the preceding section leads to a corollary warn­
ing: Don’t touch the cube. Ever. The cube is your screen, and it’s fragile, so 
if you touch it, you run a high risk of breaking it. Google won’t replace your 
Glass — even if it’s under warranty — if you break the screen due to a brain 
freeze.
Break Rules — or the Law
You may have seen signs in businesses that say something along the lines of 
“We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone.” The fact that you can wear 
your Glass almost everywhere doesn’t mean that you should wear it every­
where, especially in a private business establishment. Even before Glass was 
available for sale to the public, one Glass Explorer was kicked out of a Seattle 
restaurant for refusing to stop using the device when the server asked him to 
stop (www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2427804,00.asp).
www.it-ebooks.info

203
 Chapter 19: Ten Things Not to Do with Glass
	
Here’s an important reminder for businesses: If Glass is banned in your busi­
ness, post a reminder that people can see. That sign could save your business 
a lot of grief from angry patrons who were kicked out and complained online 
(or, worse, called lawyers).
Many casinos around the country have also banned Glass because of the 
high potential for collusion. One player at a blackjack table could see the 
dealer’s cards through a Google Hangout on the Glass screen while his part­
ner sits behind the dealer at a distance and uses his own Glass to see the 
dealer’s cards.
	
Before you start using Glass, check with your state, province, and/or country 
about laws governing the use of driving while using a screen or other monitor. 
One shining example came in late October 2013, when a driver in California 
was cited for wearing her Google Glass while driving, thus violating a state law 
that requires people not to drive a vehicle equipped with a monitor unless it 
displays “global mapping displays, external media player (MP3), or satellite 
radio information.”
	
If you have prescription shields affixed to your Glass, ask the business 
establishment for its policy on wearing Glass with prescription shields. You 
should strongly consider bringing a pair of regular prescription glasses with 
you, just in case the business doesn’t allow patrons to wear Glass under any 
circumstances.
Try to Be a Fashionista
Glass isn’t a means to show that you’re “cool” by being on the cutting edge 
or by being superior to others. It’s a device that’s supposed to help enhance 
your life in certain situations. Using Glass when you’re traveling around to get 
information is a good use of the device. If you’re going to use Glass to correct 
other people or to act superior to them, don’t be surprised to find people 
avoiding you. (If you’re surprised by this statement, or if you feel the need to 
feel superior, we can’t help you.)
Creep People Out
When you’re talking with people, it’s generally a good idea to take your Glass 
off your head to let them know that you’re giving them your full attention. 
If you don’t, the people you interact with may start behaving a bit oddly 
toward you. That behavior may be caused by your inability to maintain eye 
www.it-ebooks.info

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
contact because you’re too busy looking at the screen or moving your head 
up to activate your Glass. It may also be that people aren’t sure that you’re 
not taking their photo or taking a video surreptitiously. People can see that 
you’re taking a photo or video, not only because the Glass screen lights up as 
you’re doing so, but also because you have to speak a command or press the 
Camera button on top of the cube.
Show Off
Don’t show off with Glass, either intentionally or unintentionally. You may 
have been annoyed by someone in a public place who talks on a smartphone. 
You’ll be the person people love to hate if you make a phone call on your 
Glass, start speaking commands to it, or dictate an e-mail message it.
What’s more, you shouldn’t wear your Glass at a party or other gathering. It’s 
nice to be able to check a person’s name and interests before you talk to her, 
but she may be uncomfortable when you recite all her interests instead of 
asking her for information.
	
Glass does get attention, however, and people will ask you about it, so be gra­
cious and answer questions. Find out how to share your Glass with other 
people safely by flipping to Chapter 7.

hen you purchase Glass and start wearing it in public, you’re going to 
get a lot of attention. Like it or not, Glass is an automatic conversa­
tion starter, and you’re an ambassador for the device.
If you need to connect with other Glass users because you have a problem or 
issue and want to see how other users have handled it, or because you have 
a desire to connect with other Glass users, plenty of online and offline oppor­
tunities are available.
Connect with the Glass Community
The Glass Community is a private website you can access at https://www.
glass-community.com. You need to sign in with your Google username 
and password.
www.it-ebooks.info

206
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
	
The Glass Community has some basic rules that you should follow when you 
post messages:
	
✓	Make the text and any photos you include with your posts 
family-friendly.
	
✓	Be on your best behavior. The community has no tolerance for threats, 
harassment, or bullying.
	
✓	Avoid promoting yourself or your business. The website is for sharing 
information, not selling items or sending spam messages.
	
✓	Don’t share your personal information with others.
	
✓	Include an interesting title with your post so it will attract readers.
	
✓	Provide complete background information in your posts, such as what 
you’re doing with your Glass when an error occurs.
	
If you think that a post is inappropriate, the moderators make it easy for you 
to contact them and report any problems you think should be investigated.
Use Glass Hashtags on Social Networks
A hashtag is a word or a phrase that’s preceded by a hash symbol (#) and 
identifies a post based on a specific topic. Hashtags are neat and convenient 
ways for people who want to find out more about a topic to search for it on 
social networking websites. If you search for #throughglass on Twitter, for 
example, you’ll see posts by people who have sent text and/or photo tweets 
from Glass.
Google has established several hashtags you can add to your posts to make it 
easier for people to find your posts and start to follow you:
	
✓	#throughglass: When you send a post on a social networking website 
from your Glass, Glass adds this hashtag to the post automatically.
	
✓	#ifihadglass: This hashtag tells users about new ideas you have for 
Glass if you’re a current user or just want to buy one.
	
✓	#googleglass: This hashtag notes that the post is related to Glass.

ware and app developers. Just visit https://plus.google.com/u/0/
communities/103179668665582410083.
	
You can also search for Glass communities on Google+ by clicking or tapping 
the Home button and then clicking or tapping Communities. In the Communities 
screen that appears, type the community name you’re searching for (such as 
Glass) in the Search for Communities box.
Hook Up with LinkedIn Groups
If you frequent the LinkedIn professional networking website, you can join a 
couple of Glass groups so you can interact with other Glass users around the 
world. Here are two that you may be interested in:
	
✓	Google Glass Developers: This group is for Glass app developers. You 
can exchange ideas, post information about your latest app project, 
and get the latest news about Glass and Glass development. Access this 
group at www.linkedin.com/groups/Google-Glass-Developers-
4872136/about.
	
✓	Google Glass Forum: The Google Glass Forum group at www.linkedin.
com/groups/Google-Glass-Forum-5135187/about discusses app

LinkedIn limits the number of groups you can join to 50. If you already belong 
to 50 groups, you won’t be able to add Glass groups unless you leave an 
­existing group.
	
You can search for Glass groups in LinkedIn. You’ll see a long list of groups 
that you can join on the results page.
Wear Glass in Public
Glass is a built-in conversation starter. People will ask you about the device 
and what it can do. They may be curious, or they may be afraid that you’re 
going to do something nefarious with your Glass.
Be gracious. Answer all questions as completely as you can. You may want to 
find the answers on your Glass while you’re talking to that person — but be sure 
to tell that person you’re going to look for answers on Glass before you do it.
Do Show-and-Tell with Glass
When you get together with family members, friends, or colleagues who are 
interested in technology, be sure to bring Glass with you and answer ques­
tions. You can even share your Glass if you feel comfortable doing that. 
Maybe people will be inspired to buy a Glass themselves . . . and perhaps 
even buy this book!
	
Some people may be put off by, if not openly derisive of, Glass and wearable 
computers in general. See Chapter 19 for things not to do with Glass and how 
to present the device properly.
Develop Something Great for Glass
If you enjoy tinkering with new technologies and want to see what they can 
do, Glass is a great platform for you. You get to work on something exciting 
and new, and you may also get to develop the next big thing (and earn some 
extra income).
To find out more about “hacking” your Glass by using the Glass Development 
Kit and other development tools, see Chapter 14.

 Chapter 20: Ten Ways to Make New Friends with Glass
Get Your Glass at a Base Camp
Google has set up Base Camps in several cities around the United States, 
including San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles. If you reserved your 
Glass on the Glass website (www.google.com/glass), you can pick up the 
device at one of these Base Camps and also do the following cool stuff:
	
✓	Get your Glass fitted with the help of a Glass Guide.
	
✓	Find out more about Glassware, Glass hardware, and cool things you can 
do with the device.
	
✓	Chat with Glass Guides and other Glass users.
	
If you purchase Glass at a Base Camp, the sales tax for your state applies to 
the purchase. If you purchase your Glass in San Francisco, for example, your 
purchase price includes California sales tax at the San Francisco tax rate.
Attend Glass Events
Google+ communities announce in-person events about Glass in various 
communities around the world, so visit these communities often to get the 
most recent information.
The Meetup website (www.meetup.com) is a great place to visit for the latest 
events, not only about Glass, but also about wearable devices in general. On 
Meetup, you can search for groups and/or events, and you can change the 
search radius from your current location, such as within 100 miles of San 
Francisco.
Host Your Own Glass Event
If you can’t find an event, start one of your own! You can create events and/
or post messages asking whether people would be interested in the following 
places:
	
✓	Forums on social networking websites such as LinkedIn and Google+
	
✓	Event sites such as Meetup
	
✓	Chamber-of-commerce and other business sites

I want to thank my awesome literary agent, Carole Jelen, as well as Kathy 
Simpson and Katie Mohr for everything. Finally, I want to thank my co-author,
