Use the following properties for copper: density, ρ = 8954 kg/m^3, specific heat, cp = 381 J/kg.K, thermal 
conductivity, k = 386 W/m.K, emissivity, ε = 0.78. [VTU – Aug. 2001]
(b) Additionally, plot the variation of these quantities as emissivity of surface of sphere varies from 0.1 
to 0.9.
EES Solution:
This is the case of a small object in a large surrounding. 
So, to get Q12, use the EES Function written above.
“Data:”
R = 0.05 [m]“….radius of sphere”
epsilon_1 = 0.78“…emissivity of sphere surface”
T_1 = 1273 [K]“…sphere temp.”
T_2 = 303 [K]“….surroundings temp.”
rho = 8954[kg/m^3]“…density of copper”
cp = 381 [J/kg-K]“…sp. heat of copper”
k = 386 [W/m-K]“…thermal cond. of copper”
“Calculations:”
A_1 = 4 * pi * R^2 “[m^2]… surface area of sphere”
“To find Q12, use the EES Function already written for a small object in a large enclosure:”
Q12 = Q12_SmallObject(A_1, epsilon_1, T_1, T_2)“[W]…finds rate of initial heat loss from the sphere”

“But, Q12 is also equal to:
Q12 = mass * cp * dTbydtau, where dTbydtau is the initial rate of cooling”
“Therefore:”
mass = rho * (4/3) * pi * R^3 “…[kg]… mass of sphere”
Q12 = mass * cp * dTbydtau “…[C/s]….finds initial rate of cooling”
“Time taken to cool to 900 C:”
“Find the rate of heat loss when the sphere temp is 900 C. Then, take the average rate of heat loss from 
1000 C to 900 C, and the find the approx. time taken to cool from 1000 C to 900 C, knowing the total 
amount of heat removed in the process:”
Q12_2 = Q12_SmallObject(A_1, epsilon_1, 1173, T_2)“[W]…finds rate of heat loss from the sphere 
when it is at 900 C”

“And:”

“Therefore, approx. time taken to cool to 900 C:”
time = Q_lost / Q12_avg “[s]……time taken to cool to 900 C”
Results:
Thus:
Initial rate of heat loss, Q12 = 3637 W….Ans.
Initial rate of cooling, dT/dτ = 2.036 C/s … Ans.
Approx. time taken to cool to 900 C = time = 57.11 s …. Ans.

EES Solution: 
This is the case of long, concentric cylinders.
To find T2, use the fact that: in steady state, net radiant heat transfer between cylinders 1 and 2 must 
be equal to the net radiant heat transfer between cylinders 2 and 3.
To find Q12 between long, concentric cylinders, use the EES Function already written.
“Data:”
R1 = 0.075 [m]“….radius of inner cyl”
R2 = 0.125 [m]“….radius of middle cyl”
R3 = 0.175 [m]“….radius of outer cyl”
L = 1[m] “…assumed”
epsilon_1 = 0.05“…emissivity of surface 1”
epsilon_2 = 0.1“…emissivity of surface 2”
epsilon_3 = 0.2“…emissivity of surface 3”
T_1 = 80 [K]“…inner cylinder temp.”
T_3 = 300 [K]“….outer cylinder temp.”
“Calculations:”
“Net heat transfer between surfaces 1 and 2:
Using the EES Function already written:”
Q12 = Q12_long_concentric_cylinders(L, R1, R2, epsilon_1, epsilon_2,T_1, T_2)
“Similarly, Net heat transfer between surfaces 2 and 3:”
Q23 = Q12_long_concentric_cylinders(L, R2, R3, epsilon_2, epsilon_3,T_2, T_3)
“Equating Q12 and Q23, we get the unknown temp, T2:”
Q12 = Q23 “..equate Q12 to Q23 to get T2”

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Formula bar shows the Function entered for Q12 in cell C140.
In steady state, Q12 should be equal to Q23. i.e. (Q12 – Q23)^2  = 0.i.e. cell C142 should be equal to 
zero. But, now it is not equal to zero since we have started with an arbitrary, trial value for T2.
To find the correct value of T2:
Use Goal Seek to set (Q12 – Q23)^2 = 0, by changing T2, i.e. cell C138:
To apply Goal Seek: Go to: Data – What If analysis – Goal Seek:

5.C.2 Radiation energy exchange in 3-surface enclosures:
Prob. 5.C.2.1. Write Mathcad Functions for a general three-surface enclosures.
Recollect the schematic and Radiation network for a general 3-surface enclosure (shown below).
Here, for the 3 surfaces, area (a1, A2, A3), Temperatures (T1, T2, T3) and emissivities (eps1, eps2, eps3) 
are given. View Factors F12, F3 and F23 are either given or calculated. We have to find out the three 
Radiosities, and the rate of heat transfers.
The procedure is: 
i)	 Apply Kirchoff’s Law to the three nodes to get three algebraic equations. Here, it is important 
to assume that the (heat) current flow is into the node. The signs adjust themselves while 
solving for Radiosities. 
ii)	 Now, we write a Function to solve for the Radiosities J1, J2 and J3 with ‘Solve Block’ of Mathcad.
iii)	Then, we use this Function in another Mathcad Function to get the values of heat transferred 
from each surface and between any two surfaces.

Then, we shall verify the results using the Mathcad Function for general, three-surface enclosure written 
earlier.
Since the area A3 of the room is very large, we can take the surface resistance of A3 as equal to zero.
This means that Eb3 = J3, i.e. a large room is equivalent to a black surface.

Let us write Mathcad Functions for both the above cases:
Fig. (a) shows the radiation network for this case. The radiation network is drawn very easily by 
remembering the usual principles: for a black surface, the surface resistance is zero, i.e. Eb = J. For a re-
radiating surface too, Eb = J; further, for a re-radiating surface, Q = 0. Between two given surfaces, the 
radiosity potentials are connected by the respective space resistances, as shown. The system reduces to 
a series-parallel circuit of resistances as shown in Fig. (b).
Q12 is the net radiant heat transferred between surfaces 1 and 2.
TR is the temp of re-radiating surface.

Prob. 5.C.2.8. Two co-axial cylinders of 0.4 m and 1 m dia. are 1 m long. The annular top and bottom 
surfaces are well insulated and act as re-radiating surfaces. The inner surface is at 1000 K and has an 
emissivity of 0.6. The outer surface is maintained at 400 K and its emissivity is 0.4.
i)	 Determine the heat exchange between the surfaces
ii)	 If the annular base surfaces are open to the surroundings at 300 K, determine the radiant 
heat exchange.
If the outer cylinder is surface 2, take F21= 0.25 and F22= 0.27. [M.U. Dec. 1998] 
Mathcad Solution:

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Prob. 5.C.2.9. Two parallel plates, 0.5 m × 1 m each, are spaced 0.5 m apart. The plates are at temperatures 
of 1000 C and 500 C and their emissivities are 0.2 and 0.5 respectively. The plates are located in a large 
room, the walls of which are at 27 C. The surfaces of the plates facing each other only exchange heat 
by radiation. Determine the rates of heat lost by each plate and heat gain of the walls by radiation. Use 
radiation network for solution. Assume shape factor between parallel plates: F12 = F21 = 0.285. [M.U. 1996]

This problem is the same as Prob.5.C.2.3, which was solved with Mathcad.
However, now we shall solve it with EES:
EES Solution:
The schematic fig. and the radiation network are shown in Fig (a) and (b) above.
We shall, first write an EES PROCEDURE to calculate the Emissive powers and Resistances involved, 
to reduce labour; then, we shall use that Procedure in a Main EES program to find out the Radiosities 
by applying the Kirchoff’s Law to the three nodes J1, J2 and J3 and solve the resulting three equations 
simultaneously to get J1, J2 and J3. Then, the heat transfers are easily calculated by applying the Ohm’s 
Law between any two given radiosity potentials.

While writing the above equations, remember to consider all heat currents as flowing in to the 
respective node.
First, get the Emissive powers and various resistances using the EES Function written earlier.
Then, solve simultaneously the three equations obtained by applying the Kirchoff’s Law to the three 
Nodes, written above.
To get the View Factors F12, F13 and F23 use the EES Function for two parallel disks, written earlier.
Following is the EES program:

“Data:”
R = 0.75 [m]
L = 2 [m]
A_1 = pi * R^2 “[m^2]…area of top disk”
A_2 = A_1 “[m^2]…area ofbottom disk”
A_3 = 2 * pi * R * L “[m^2] …area of walls”
T_1 = 800 [K]“…temp of top disk”
T_2 = 600 [K]“…temp of bottom disk”
T_3 =1400 [K]“….temp of walls”

We use the EES Function written earlier to calculate Emissive powers and resistances.

“F_11 + F_12 + F_13 = 1 … by Summation rule for surface 1”
“But, ”
F_11 = 0 “…since surface 1 is flat;
Also, F_12 = F_13, by symmetry.”
“Therefore:”

Now, let us prepare an EXCEL template to solve general, three surface enclosure problem.
Here, in the worksheet, we will first have a portion where we calculate View Factors, say for the three 
important geometries, viz. parallel rectangles, coaxial parallel discs and perpendicular rectangles with 
a common edge.
Recollect that we have already written EXCEL – VBA Functions for View factors for these geometries. 
See Problems 5B.11, 5B.12 and 5B.13.
Then, in the template, we will calculate the Emissive powers and various ‘surface resistances’ and ‘space 
resistances’. Then, we will solve the three equations obtained by writing the Kirchoff’s Law for the three 
nodes, to obtain the radiosities J1, J2 and J3. We shall use the EXCEL Solver to do this. Knowing J1, J2 
and J3, the heat flows from a given surface or between any two surfaces are easily calculated.
Following is the worksheet:
First, a template for View Factors:

Note in the above that in a corner of the worksheet, there is a template to calculate the View Factors for 
the aforesaid three geometries using the VBA Functions already written. For example, View factor for 
Coaxial, parallel disks is calculated in cell M79, using the VBA Function. The Function entered can be 
seen in the Formula bar. If we change the values of r_i, r_j or L in cells M76, M77 and M78 respectively, 
immediately the View factor in cell M79 will change. Similarly, we can find out the View factors for other 
two geometries by entering data in respective cells.
Let us remind ourselves the radiation network for the three surface enclosure (given above) and the 
equations obtained by applying the Kirchoff’s Law to the three Nodes:

In the above, first, put guess values of 1000 each for J1, J2 and J3.
Then, for Nodes 1, 2 and 3 enter the corresponding equations, obtained by applying Kirchoff’s Law, 
given earlier.
See the Formula bar in the above screen shot for formula entered for Node 1, in cell C114. Similarly, 
formulas are entered for Nodes 2 and 3 in cells C115 and C116.
Sum of the squares of C114 to C116 should be zero, but, in this case since J1, J2 and J3 are assumed 
values, the sum of squares is not zero.
Apply Solver to make C117 zero by changing J1, J2 and J3. (i.e. cells C11, D111 and E111.)

In the above heat transfers from/to each surface (Q_1, Q_2 and Q_3), and also between surfaces (Q_12, 
Q_13, Q_23) are calculated using formulas given earlier. For ex. see in the Formula bar, the formula 
entered to calculate Q_1 in cell C125. 
Negative sign for a heat transfer indicates heat coming in to the surface.
As a check: Sum of Q1, Q2 and Q3 should be zero.
Thus:
Q1 = -563507.24 W, Q2 = -100876.84 W and Q3 = 664384.1 W … Ans.

(b) If surface 3 is black, what are the values of Q1, Q2 and Q3?
Now, simply change eps3 = 0.9999. Remember not to put eps3 = 1, to avoid division by zero, as explained 
earlier.
Then, all other related quantities will change in the worksheet.

Prob. 5.C.2.14.Two parallel plates of size 1 m × 1 m are spaced 0.5 m apart and are located in a very 
large room, the walls of which are maintained at a temp of 27 C. One plate is maintained at a temp of 
900 C and the other at 400 C. Their emissivities are 0.2 and 0.5 respectively. If the plates exchange heat 
between themselves and surroundings, find the net heat transfer to each plate and to the room. Consider 
only the plate surfaces facing each other. [VTU – M.Tech. – Dec. 2009–Jan. 2010]
(b) In addition, plot Q1 and Q12 against ε1, for 0.1 < ε1 < 0.9.
This is the same as Prob. 5.C.2.4. which was solved with Mathcad earlier.
Now, let us solve it with EXCEL:
Use the Template prepared in the previous Problem.
Use A3 = Area of the room as very large, say 1E06 m^2, and the emissivity as 0.99 (black body).

=======================================================================
Prob. 5.C.2.15. A cylindrical shaped furnace is 1 m dia and 1.2 m high. The top surface, having an 
emissivity of 0.7 emits a uniform heat flux of 7 kW/m^2. The bottom surface with an emissivity of 0.4 
is maintained at 350 K. The sides are insulated and function as reradiating surfaces. Determine the heat 
transfer to bottom surface and also the temperature of top and sides.
(b) Also, plot Q1, T1 and T3 against J1, as J1 varies from 300 to 1100 W/m^2, other conditions remaining 
the same.

Fig.Prob.5.C.2.15 (b)
EXCEL Solution:
Note that in this case heat flux at the top is given and not its emissive power. So, the flux is to be taken as 
radiosity of the surface. i.e. J1 = 7000 W/m^2. The equivalent radiation circuit is shown in Fig. (b) above.
Recollect that the Kirchoff’s eqns for a general three surface enclosure are:
However, in the above case, J1 is known, and Eb1 is to be found out.
Also, for Node J3, since Eb3 = J3, the first term in eqn for Node J3 will be zero. Therefore, eps3 
does not enter in to calculations. Anyway, we enter eps3 = 0.99.
So, apply the Solver to solve for Eb1, J2 and J3 from the above three eqns; have a trial values for 
Eb1, J2 and J3 to start with, say equal to 1000 each.
Once Eb1 is obtained, get T1 from Eb1 = sigma * T1^4.
And, when J3 is known, get T3 from Eb3 = J3 = sigma * T3^4.
Use the Template prepared for the three surface enclosure.

For Nodes 1, 2 and 3 enter the corresponding equations, obtained by applying Kirchoff’s Law, are entered. 
Eqn for Node J3 can be seen in the Formula bar above.
Sum of the squares of C114 to C116 should be zero, but, in this case since Eb1, J2 and J3 are assumed 
values, the sum of squares is not zero.
Apply Solver to make C117 zero by changing Eb1, J2 and J3. (i.e. cells C102, D111 and E111.)

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Also, note that temps T1 and T3 are calculated.
Sum_diff^2 is almost equal to zero.
And, results of equations at Nodes 1, 2 and 3 are almost equal to zero.
Next, continue the calculations for heat transfers:
In the above, heat transfers from/to each surface (Q_1, Q_2 and Q_3), and also between surfaces (Q_12, 
Q_13, Q_23) are calculated using formulas given earlier. For ex. see in the Formula bar, the formula 
entered to calculate Q_1 in cell C125. 
Negative sign for a heat transfer indicates heat coming in to the surface.
As a check: Sum of Q1, Q2 and Q3 should be zero.
Thus:
Q1 = 1477.72 W, Q2 = -1477.72 W , Eb1 = 7810 W/m^2, T1 = 609.14 K, T3 = 553.88 K … Ans.

Now, let us use the above EES Functions to solve some problems:
Prob.5.D.13. Two very large parallel planes, with emissivities 0.3 and 0.8 exchange heat. Find the 
percentage reduction in heat transfer when a polished Aluminium shield (eps = 0.04) is placed between 
them. [VTU – May/June 2010]
EES Solution:
We have:
Therefore, taking the ratio of Q12 with shield to that without shield:
In EES data and this eqn for Ratio are entered:
“Data:”
eps_1 = 0.3
eps_2 = 0.8
eps_s1 = 0.04
eps_s2 = 0.04
Ratio = (1/eps_1 + 1/eps_2 – 1) / ((1/eps_1 + 1/eps_2 – 1) + (1/eps_s1 + 1/eps_s2 – 1))
And, Results:
i.e. Q12 with shield is 6.815% of that without shield…. Ans.

Prob.5.D.14. Two large parallel planes with emissivity 0.6 are at 900 K and 300 K. A radiation shield 
with one side polished and having emissivity of 0.05 and the other side unpolished with emissivity 0.4 
is proposed to be used between them. Which side of the shield should face the hotter plane if the temp 
of the shield is to be kept minimum? Justify your answer. [VTU – June 2012]
(b) Also, for the case 1, plot Q12_with_shield and T_shield as eps_s1 (i.e. emissivity of shield surface 
facing the 900 K surface) varies from 0.05 to 0.4:
EES Solution:
We shall use the EES Functions written above:
“Data:”
A = 1“[m^2]”
eps_1 = 0.6
eps_2 = 0.6
eps_s1 = 0.05 “..facing surface 1”
eps_s2 = 0.4 “…. facing surface 2”

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

between them evacuated. The inner sphere has an outer dia D1 = 0.3 m and for outer sphere the inner 
dia D2 = 0.4 m and emissivities eps1 = 0.2 and eps2 = 0.25. Temperatures are maintained at temps T1 = 
90K and T2 = 300 K respectively. A coaxial shield of diameter D3 = 0.35 m and emissivity eps_s = 0.05 
on both its surfaces is placed between the two spheres. If the latent heat of vaporization of LOX is 
2.13 × 10^5 J/kg, determine:
a)	 the boil-off rate of liquid oxygen when there is no shield,
b)	 the boil-off rate of liquid oxygen when the shield is present. What is the equilibrium temp of

‘Radiation error’ in temperature measurement
Note that the in the above Solve block, Tc and Ts are written as Functions of Tw, Tf, εc, εs and h. This helps 
us to vary any of those variables and find Tc and Ts and to draw graphs.
Result of above Function for the above example is:
Tc is the first item of the result vector, and Ts is the second item.
We extract these from the output vector as:

Prob.5E.2. Hot gas at 1350 K is flowing in a duct whose walls are maintained at a temperature Tw = 530 K. 
A thermocouple (TC) placed in the stream to measure temp. If the emissivity of the thermocouple junction 
is εc = 0.5 and the convective heat transfer coefficient between the flowing air and the thermocouple is 
h = 115 W/(m2.C), find out the temperature shown by the TC.
(b) Now, if a radiation shield (εs = 0.1) is placed between the thermocouple and the walls, what will be 
new value of Tc read by the thermocouple? And how much is the radiation error?

Prob. 5.E.3. Hot air is flowing in a duct whose walls are maintained at a temperature Tw = 450 
K. A thermocouple (TC) placed in the stream shows a reading of 650 K. If the emissivity of the 
thermocouple junction is εc = 0.8 and the convective heat transfer coefficient between the flowing air 
and the thermocouple is h = 85 W/(m2.C), find out the true temperature of the flowing stream.
(b) Now, if a radiation shield (εs = 0.3) is placed between the thermocouple and the walls, what will be 
new value of Tc read by the thermocouple? And how much is the temperature error?
(c) Plot the radiation error and shield temp as εs varies from 0.05 to 0.5.
EES Solution:

“Calculations:”
“When there is no radiation shield:”
T_f = T_c + epsilon_c * sigma * (T_c^4 – T_w^4) / h “…finds true temp of fluid”
“When radiation shield is present:”
“By heat balance on the Thermocouple bead:”
h * (T_f – T_c_with_shield) = sigma * epsilon_c * (T_c_with_shield^4 – T_s^4) “…. eqn, (A).”
“By heat balance on the Shield:”
2 * h * (T_f – T_s) = epsilon_s * sigma * (T_s^4 – T_w^4) “…eqn. (B).”
“Solving eqns. (A) and (B) simultaneously, we get thermocouple reading (T_c) and the Shield temp. ( T_s)”
“Radiation error:”
Error_no_shield = T_f – T_c “[deg.C]…. error when there is no shield”
Error_with_shield = T_f – T_c_with_shield “[deg.C]…. error when the shield is present”
Results:
Thus:
True temp of fluid = T_f = 723.4 K …. Ans.
TC reading when the shield is present = 714.6 deg.C … Ans.
Shield temp = T_s = 703 K … Ans.

Now, the condition to be satisfied is: Error_no_shield = New_error 
We have to find eps_c such that this condition is satisfied.
So, apply Goal seek to make value in cell D17 equal to 5.114 by changing cell D10 (i.e. eps_c):
Go to Data-WhatIf Analysis – Goal Seek:
Click on Goal Seek; we get the following window, fill it up as shown:

(c) Now, if a shield of emissivity 0.3 is kept surrounding the TC bead, what is the new temp error? 
And what is the shield temp?
Note in the above screen shot that we have started with a guess value of 450 for T_s in cell D30.
Applying Goal Seek to make cell D40 equal to zero by changing cell D30 (i.e. T_s), we get the value of 
temp of Shield T_s:

Now, continue to calculate the new reading of TC:
Note in the above screen shot that we have started with a guess value of 500 for T_c_with_shield in cell 
D51.
Applying Goal Seek to make cell D55 equal to zero by changing cell D51 (i.e. T_c_with_shield), we get 
the value of temp of Shield T_c_with_shield:

2.	 Now, we need a VBA program to read eps_s values one by one and apply Goal Seek twice 
to get T_s and T_c_with_shield, and thereby get Error_with_shield, and then copy the 
calculated values in the main worksheet to their respective places in the Table. Also, this 
program should be run from a command button.
