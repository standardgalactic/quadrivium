large pharmaceutical company who was interested in consulting services.They
started off the conversation stating that they had some problems and thought that
my company might be able to help.They had noticed a trend with one of their for-
eign competitors. Every time they went to release a new product (in this case a new
drug), one of their competitors would release a similar drug with a similar name sev-
eral weeks before them and would beat them to market. If you understand the drug
industry, you’ll know that this is a serious problem.The ﬁrst company to get a
product to market usually is able to obtain a higher market share and higher demand
than its competitors.Therefore, this represented a huge monetary loss to the com-
pany and the executives were concerned.
This initially sounded like a potential problem but I needed more details. My
follow-up question was how often had this occurred and over what time period.The
executive I was talking with said it had happened eight times over the prior 12
months. I was sitting there thinking:You think there is a problem? My next question
was,“Why did you wait so long to call someone?”Their answer was,“We ﬁgured it
was just a coincidence, because the only way this could have happened was if an
insider was giving the information to a competitor and we trust all of the employees
so this could not be the case.” Over the next several months they were going to
realize how wrong that previous statement was.
I led an internal assessment team and over the course of several months found
three different groups of people (each consisting of 2-4 people), working for two
different competitors.Actually, one group was working for a foreign competitor and
the other two groups were working for a foreign government.
The fact that this story is true is scary, but what makes it even more troubling is
that this happened more than 18 months ago and I have worked on and am aware of
at least 15 other similar cases.The average monetary loss of the case I worked on was
estimated at $350 million annually.
The Devil Inside
“I trust everyone, it is the devil inside that I do not trust,” is a great line from the
movie The Italian Job. Everyone has the potential do to harm, including your
employees. If you look at the minimal background checks that most companies per-
form on their employees, you have to wonder what that trust is based on. Why is it
that once a total stranger is hired at your company, you now completely trust that
person? Just because they are now called an employee does not mean they have loy-

alty to your organization and would do nothing to hurt the company. We do not
want you to be so paranoid that your company cannot function, but a healthy dose
of paranoia is good.
Aldrich Ames, Robert Hanssen, and other spies had one thing in common: they
passed the polygraph (lie detector test) with almost a perfect score. How could a
machine that tests whether people are lying not catch the biggest liars that cost so
many people their lives? The reason is a polygraph does not detect lies, it detects
guilt. In these cases, either the people felt justiﬁed by their actions and did not feel
guilty about them or they were trained to be able to bypass and deceive people.
Only by closely watching people over time will you start to understand that there
are certain people who cannot be trusted.
Insider threat and corporate espionage rely on the fact that it is sometimes better
to live in denial and be happy than to know the truth and have to deal with it. One
of my associates recently found out his wife was cheating on him and was very
annoyed with the person who told him.The person who told him said,“Why are
you mad at me? Didn’t you want to know?”And the person’s response was,“No.” It
was easier to live with a lie than deal with the truth. While most executives might
not be bold enough to admit this, it is very true in corporations and governments
around the world. It is easier to trust your employees and keep life simple, than to
suspect everyone and deal with the complexities it creates. However, if it will put
your company out of business, cause hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of loss, or
cause people to die, you might think differently about the answer.
Nobody wants to believe the truth, but corporate espionage via the insider
threat is causing huge problems. Many companies either do not have the proper
monitoring to realize or do not want to admit that it is happening to them. For
some reason, with many crimes, including insider threat, victims feel embarrassed
and ashamed.They are the victims, they did nothing wrong, but for some reason
these criminals turn the tables on who is at fault. I have heard rape victims say that it
was their own fault they were raped. I have also heard numerous times that it is a
company’s fault if they are stupid enough to be a victim to insider threat. With that
mentality, who is going to admit that this happened to their company? The only
person at fault is the attacker—not the victim.
The Importance of Insider Threat
Organizations tend to think that once they hire an employee or a contractor that
that person is now part of a trusted group of people.Although an organization
might give an employee additional access that an ordinary person would not have,
why should they trust that person? Many organizations perform no background

checks and no reference checks and as long as the hiring manager likes them, they
will hire them. Many people might not be who you think they are and not properly
validating them can be an expensive, if not a fatal, mistake. Because many organiza-
tions, in essence, hire complete strangers who are really unknown entities and give
them access to sensitive data, the insider threat is something that all organizations
must worry about.
If a competitor or similar entity wants to cause damage to your organization,
steal critical secrets, or put you out of business, they just have to ﬁnd a job opening,
prep someone to ace the interview, have that person get hired, and they are in.The
fact that it is that easy should scare you. Many companies have jobs open for several
weeks and it could take a couple of weeks to set up an interview.That gives a com-
petitor focused on your company a four-week period to prep someone to ace an
interview.This is what foreign governments do when they plant a spy against the
U.S.They know that a key criterion for that person is passing the polygraph, so they
will put that person through intensive training so that he or she can pass the poly-
graph with no problem.This points out a key disadvantage that organizations have.
The attacker knows what process you are going to follow to hire someone and all
they have to do is prep someone so they ace that part of the process.
In terms of the importance, I often hear people say that it is only hype and that it
cannot happen to us.This is synonymous to thinking that bad things only happen to
others, they never happen to you; until they happen to you and then you have a dif-
ferent view of the world. I remember several years ago when my father got diagnosed
with having a cancerous brain tumor. It shocked me, devastated me, and changed my
views forever. Prior to that I knew that people had brain cancer but it was something
that I could not relate to or understand because I never thought it could really
happen to me or someone I love. Bad things happened to others, not to me.This is
the denial that many of us live in, but the unfortunate truth is bad things do happen
and they could be occurring right now and you just do not know about it.
Insider threat is occurring all the time, but since it is happening within a com-
pany, it is a private attack. Public attacks like defacing a Web site are hard for a com-
pany to deny. Private attacks are much easier to conceal.
Because these attacks are being perpetrated by trusted insiders, you need to
understand the damage they can cause; how to build proper measures to prevent the
attack; how to minimize the damage; and, at a minimum, how to detect the attacks
in a timely manner. Many of the measures companies deploy today are ineffective
against the insider. When companies talk about security and securing their enter-
prise, they are concerned with the external attack, forgetting about the damage that
an insider can cause. Many people debate about what percent of attacks come from
www.syngress.com
6
Chapter 1 • What Is There to Worry About?
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 6

insiders and what percent of attacks come from outsiders.The short answer is who
cares? The real answer is this:
■
Can attacks come from external sources?
■
Can an external attack cause damage to your company?
■
Can an external attack put you out of business?
■
Can attacks come from internal sources?
■
Can an internal attack cause damage to your company?
■
Can an internal attack put you out of business?
Since the answer to all of these questions is YES, who cares what the percent is?
Both have to be addressed and both have to be dealt with. I would argue that since
the insider has access already, the amount of damage they can cause is much greater
than an external attacker and the chances of getting caught are much lower. If an
attacker comes in from the outside, he has access only to systems that are publicly
accessible and he has to break through security devices. If an attacker comes from
the inside, she has full access and minimal if any security devices to deal with.As our
digital economy continues to grow and the stakes increase, anyone who wants
serious access to an organization is not even going to waste his time with an
external attack, he is going to go right for the trusted insider.
Finally, to highlight the importance of insider threat, everyone is getting on the
bandwagon.The Unites States Secret Service is conducting a series of studies on the
insider; conferences are popping up on the subject. Why? Because billions of dollars
are being lost and something has to be done to stop the bleeding.You will never be
able to completely remove the insider threat because companies need to be able to
function. If you ﬁre all your employees, you might have prevented the insider attack,
but you will also go out of business.The key is to strike a balance between what
access people need and what access people have.
Insider Threat Deﬁned
Since everyone uses different terminology, it is important to deﬁne what we mean
by insider threat.The easiest way to get a base deﬁnition is to break the two words
apart.According to www.dictionary.com, insider is deﬁned as “one who has special
knowledge or access to conﬁdential information” and threat is deﬁned as “an expres-
sion of an intention to inﬂict pain, injury, evil, or punishment; an indication of
impending danger or harm; or one that is regarded as a possible danger.” Putting this
together, an insider threat is anyone who has special access or knowledge with the
intent to cause harm or danger.

341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 7

There is a reason that the insider threat is so powerful and most companies are
not aware of it; it is because all the standard security devices that organizations
deploy do little if anything to prevent the insider threat.
However, as much as we do not want to admit it, this is no longer true (if it ever
was).The problem with insider threat is that it takes only one person who is dis-
gruntled and looking for a quick payoff or revenge and your company is compro-
mised. Unfortunately, it is really that easy and one of the many reasons that the
problem has gotten so out of hand.
The world is also a different place than it once was. Most people today, by the
time they are at the age of 30, have had more jobs than both their parents combined
across their entire careers. In the past, people worked for one company for 30 years
and retired. Having worked for one company for an entire career builds loyalty.
However, today people switch companies fairly often and while most people are not
intentionally out to perform corporate espionage, there is a high chance they can
inadvertently perform it. When you switch companies, you most likely are going to
stay within the same industry, unless you are making a complete career change,
which is unlikely.Therefore, the chance that you are going to work for a competitor
is very high.This means some of your knowledge from your previous employer,
despite your best efforts, will leak over into this new company.
People do not like to hear it and employers do not like to admit it, but the
biggest threat to a company is their internal employees.Your employees or anyone
with special access (like a contractor) have more access than an outsider and therefore
can cause a lot more damage. However, most organizations and media still focus on
the external threat and pay little attention to the insider threat.Why? The short
answer is the external threat is easier to see and easier to defend against. If an external
attacker defaces your Web site, it is easy to detect and defend against. It is also difﬁcult
to deny because everyone can tell that it happened. However, if an employee makes
copies of all of the customer credit cards and walks out with it on a USB drive that
ﬁts in his or her wallet, it is very difﬁcult to detect and defend against.
Authorized versus Unauthorized Insider
An insider is anyone with special or additional access and an insider attack is
someone using that access against the company in some way.The key question to ask
is why does that person have the access they have and how did they get that access?
One of the best ways to defend against the insider threat is to institute a principle of
least privilege. Principle of least privilege states that you give an entity the least
amount of access they need to do their job.There are two key pieces to this. First,
you are giving your employees additional access. For employees to be able to per-
www.syngress.com
8
Chapter 1 • What Is There to Worry About?
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 8

form their job at a company, it is obvious that they will need to be given special
access that a normal person does not have.This means that every employee, con-
tractor, or anyone else performing work at your organization has the potential to
cause harm.The second key piece is needed to do their job.This focuses in on how
critical access is to an organization.You know that every employee is going to be
given special access; you just want to limit and control that access to the minimum
possible subset.
The problem with most organizations is that employees are given a lot more
access than what they actually need to do their jobs.Although the risk of insider
threat is present with every employee, giving them additional access just increases the
damage and increases the number of people that could cause harm. If only ﬁve
people out of 3000 have access to a sensitive database within your organization, one
of those ﬁve people would have to be motivated for an insider threat problem to
arise. However, if 300 out of 3000 people have access to that information, the odds
of ﬁnding or motivating someone is much higher.Therefore, the more people that
have access to a piece of information, the greater the chance it could cause harm to
your organization.
In addition, the more access that a single person has, the greater the damage that
person can cause. If 10 different managers each have access to only 10 different pieces
of sensitive data, for all 10 pieces of data to be compromised, 10 people would have
to be involved. However, if one person had access to all 10 pieces of data, then it
would take only one person to cause a grave amount of damage to the organization.
Based on this analysis, two criteria are critical for analyzing the potential for
insider threat: number of people with access to a piece of information and number
of pieces of data a single individual has. Carefully tracking and controlling critical
data and people with critical access can minimize the potential for insider threat.
We have clearly shown that access is the avenue in which insider threat is mani-
fested.The question is how did they get that access? If they were given the access
then they are authorized to access the information. If they were not given the access,
but stole, borrowed, or acquired it without permission, then it is unauthorized
access.The reason the distinction is important is that it helps determine the counter-
measures that could be put in place. Security devices like ﬁrewalls, passwords, and
encryption protect against unauthorized access. If an unprotected wireless access
point is set up, people who are unauthorized to connect to the corporate network
can still connect and access sensitive data. Someone who is unauthorized to access
the ﬁle server can walk up to an unlocked computer and access sensitive data.
However, if proper security is put in place with ﬁrewalls, encryption, and passwords,
an unauthorized person should no longer be able to connect to an unprotected

341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 9

wireless access point or to sit down in front of an unlocked system. So the security
measures that are present today can prevent unauthorized insider threat.
However, all the current security measures today will not prevent the authorized
insider.You can set up all the security you want on a network, but that will not stop
someone with proper authorization.An authorized insider is someone with a valid
reason for accessing the data but who uses that access in a way that was not intended
by the company.The NOC manager is given access to customer passwords, because
he needs that access to do his job. However, it is very hard to stop him from giving
that information to an attacker or a competitor. When talking about authorized
insider threat, intent plays a key role. People need access to do their jobs, but what
are their intentions once they get access? Luckily, as the case studies in the later
chapters will demonstrate, negative intentions rarely go without warning.
Categories of Insider Threat
Depending on the levels of access someone has, there are different categories of
insider:
■
Pure insider
■
Insider associate
■
Insider afﬁliate
■
Outside afﬁliate
Each type has different levels of access and different motives.
Pure Insider
A pure insider is an employee with all the rights and access associated with being
employed by the company.Typically, they have keys or a badge to get access to the
facility, a logon to get access to the network, and can walk around the building
unescorted.They can cause the most damage because they already have most of the
access they need.
Elevated pure insider is an insider who has additional privileged access.This usu-
ally includes system administrators who have root or administrator access on the net-
work.These people were given the additional access to do their jobs; however, in
many cases, they are given more access than what they need. Very often when com-
panies try to mitigate the risk of an insider threat, the best area to focus on is lim-
iting the access of the elevated pure insider.This is also called the “principle of least
privilege,” or giving someone the least amount of access they need to do their job.
Notice the key factors in this deﬁnition: you are not stopping people from doing
their job, you are just taking away the extra access that they do not need.

Chapter 1 • What Is There to Worry About?
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 10

With the pure insider, the key areas to focus in on to detect or prevent damage
are access, behavior, and money.Throughout this book you will see that an under-
lying factor of insider threat is access. If someone does not have proper access, it
makes their job much harder. Limiting and controlling access is key.
The second factor that comes into play is behavior. In many cases, when
someone commits an insider attack, there have usually been personal behavior pat-
terns that were predictive of such behavior. Usually they openly talked bad about the
company or management.They tended to be unhappy and angry at work and might
even have stated that one of these days they were going to get back at the company.
A third driving factor with the pure insider is money. Many of the people who
perform these attacks have ﬁnancial issues.A normal employee would not commit
insider threat. However, if you add in stress and ﬁnancial issues and someone comes
along and offers a large sum of money to make all of their problems go away, there is
a chance that person might be tempted.Therefore, tying this in with the second
point, good managers should understand and watch for unusual behavior patterns. If
a certain employee is complaining about ﬁnancial issues and child support and three
months later is driving a new Lexus, you might want to be concerned.
Insider Associate
Insider associates are people who have limited authorized access. Contractors, guards,
and cleaning and plant services all ﬁt under this category.They are not employees of
the company and do not need full access, but they need limited access. Limited
access usually takes the form of having physical access to the facility but not access
to the network.This is best illustrated by a scene in the movie Wall Street. Charlie
Sheen needed access to stock trading information.The easiest way he found to
obtain it was to get a job at the company that provided the janitorial services for the
company who he needed information on. He was given access to all of the ofﬁces
after hours and as he was cleaning the ofﬁces he looked at and made copies of sensi-
tive information that was left on people’s desks. We tend to forget that in an ofﬁce
building, locking a door really does little to protect the security of the information
in your ofﬁce. With one company I worked for, everyone left sensitive data on their
desks and locked their doors.The problem was that a master key was kept in a cen-
tral location that anyone could use to gain access to an ofﬁce. We have to remember
that there are other people who can gain access to our ofﬁces and therefore sensitive
data must always be properly secured.
To minimize the damage an insider associate can cause requires user awareness
and controlling access. Raising awareness is meant to change someone’s behavior as
compared to training that is meant to teach someone a new skill. Many employees

What Is There to Worry About? • Chapter 1
11
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 11

feel that their building, ﬂoor, and ofﬁce are properly secure and leave systems logged
in and information out that they shouldn’t. User-awareness sessions can help change
behaviors patterns, as people understand that locks do little to protect information.
They must understand that a lot of people have potential access and that they should
always properly secure sensitive data and lock systems before they walk away from
them. In addition, you should carefully examine any activity that requires access to a
facility. For example, why does the cleaning staff need access to everyone’s ofﬁce
every night? I recommend that the cleaning staff not have a master key to each
ofﬁce. Instead, when people leave at the end of the day, they can put their trash can
in the hallway. If they want their ofﬁce vacuumed, they can leave their door open; if
they do not want someone to have access, they can lock it. If employees leave their
doors open, they know others can gain access and therefore will make sure that all
sensitive date is properly secured.
Insider Afﬁliate
Pure insiders and insider associates have a legitimate reason to access the building.
The next two categories of insider do not.An insider afﬁliate is a spouse, friend, or
even client of an employee who uses the employee’s credentials to gain access.This
can be as simple as a friend coming to visit you, so you get them a badge for the
building. When you take a phone call they go to use the rest room and on the way
back they wander around looking at what is on people’s computers and on their
desks. While this can cause some problems it can usually be controlled.
The more damaging insider afﬁliate is someone who directly acts as an employee
using the employee’s credentials.The most common is remote access.Your spouse
wants to sit on the couch and surf the Web and wants to borrow your laptop.You
give him your user ID and password so he can log on and access the Internet. But
what else is he accessing either deliberately or on purpose? I have also seen cases
where a spouse is running out for the day and hands over his access card for the
building and PIN number and says,“Can you swing by the ofﬁce and pick up a few
papers for me?” Once again, people think this is harmless, but if you stop and think
about it, you’ll realize the results can be very damaging.
To prevent insider afﬁliates, the best measure is to implement policies and proce-
dures.You should never take for granted that employees will do the right thing. I
have seen people say,“Well, of course everyone should know that they should not let
someone borrow their user ID and password.” But then I see others saying,“Why
can’t I, I am not doing any harm and I did not know that I wasn’t suppose to.”
The short answer is to never make assumptions.You should have clearly written
policies and procedures, explain them to all employees, and require that they sign off
www.syngress.com
12
Chapter 1 • What Is There to Worry About?
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 12

that they understand them.Then, any deviation from the policy can be taken as a
deliberate action on the part of an employee.
Outside Afﬁliate
Outside afﬁliates are non-trusted outsiders who use open access to gain access to an
organization’s resources.Today, one of the best examples is wireless access. If a com-
pany sets up an unprotected wireless access point, what stops an outsider from con-
necting? Nothing.Therefore, if an outsider is sitting at a Starbucks across from your
ofﬁce building and connects to your wireless network, are they breaking into your
network? No.You are leaving the door wide open and they are wandering in.This is
the same as leaving the front door unlocked with no access controls or guards,
allowing anyone to walk in off the street.
Although the outside afﬁliate seems obvious, it is often overlooked by many
companies. Protecting against the outside afﬁliate requires proper access controls in
place for all types of access, including virtual and physical access.
Key Aspects of Insider Threat
The key thing to remember when dealing with insiders is that they have access and
in most cases will exploit the weakest link that gives them the greatest chance of
access, while minimizing the chances that they get caught. Why try to break through
a ﬁrewall and gain access to a system with a private address, when you can ﬁnd
someone behind the ﬁrewall with full access to the system? I know it has been
emphasized many times, but taking advantage of access is a driving force in the
insider attack.
Most people, when they think of attackers, think of someone with a huge
amount of technical sophistication that can walk through virtual cyber walls and
gain access to anything that they want. However, insiders take advantage of the fact
that they already have access, so many of the attack methods tend to be very low in
technical sophistication. In some cases, if a pure insider or insider associate has partial
access, they will sometimes use additional techniques to increase their access.
However, since they are typically not dealing with any security devices, most of the
methods tend to be fairly straightforward.
It is also important to remember that to launch an effective attack, attackers need
knowledge of the organization they are trying to attack. External attackers could
spend weeks, if not longer, trying to acquire the information they need to launch a
successful attack. In some cases, if they cannot gain enough knowledge, they might
decide to go against a different target. However, in the case of the insider, they have
full knowledge of your operations.They know what is checked and what is not
www.syngress.com
What Is There to Worry About? • Chapter 1
13
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 13

checked and can even test the system. For example, when they are trying to access
their private shares, they could click on someone else’s and see if anyone says any-
thing. If they do this multiple times and nothing ever happens, they have now gained
valuable knowledge that either access information is not being logged or not being
watched. Because they have access to the operations, they either have detailed
knowledge of how things operate or they can gain it quickly by testing the system.
NOTE
A private share is a folder on a ﬁle server that is only accessible by that indi-
vidual and meant to hold personal or sensitive information.  For example at
most companies each person has his or her own private share to store ﬁles.
Acceptable Level of Loss
Everyone has heard the phrase no pain no gain or no risk no reward. Every com-
pany in business has to take some level of risk; otherwise, the company will not be
able to survive. If you say that your company will have no risk of insider threat, then
do not hire any employees. However, the second you hire one employee your
chances of having an insider attack increase; as you hire more employees the risk
keeps increasing. From a naïve standpoint, you might ask, if your risk keeps
increasing why would you keep hiring people? The short answer is so that the com-
pany can grow and revenues and proﬁts can increase and most companies are willing
to take that risk.
This is also true of external attacks.As soon as you provide e-mail and Web ser-
vices to the Internet, your chances of being attacked from the outside increase.
However, your level of service and revenues also increase so it is a risk worth taking.
The bottom line is, you have to ﬁgure out what your acceptable level of loss is
and then build in proper measures to protect against it. Many companies do not do
this, throw caution to the wind, lose large amounts of money, and potentially go out
of business due to insider attacks. It is much better to realize that there will be some
level of loss but build in measures to minimize it to an acceptable level.
For example, hiring and giving everyone administrator access would be a huge
potential for loss and not one that I would be willing to accept. On the other hand,
if you require that anyone needing administrator access has to justify why they need
it, get sign off by two executives, and go through a series of additional background
checks before he or she is given the access, this will help reduce the risk.You might

Chapter 1 • What Is There to Worry About?
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 14

also put measures in place to rotate out key positions so it would be harder for a
person to cause damage over a long period of time. In the chapters that follow, you
will see how rotation in particular could have drastically shortened damage in many
insider threat cases, such as when Mel Spillman stole nearly ﬁve million dollars over
15 years. In addition, you might set up separation of duties in which two people are
required to perform a certain function, which prevents a single person from causing
damage.This could have been monumental in reducing some of the visa fraud cases
we will discuss, such as when Hsin Hui Hsu sent fraudulent letters inviting poten-
tially hundreds of unauthorized Chinese nationals into the United States for “discus-
sions” that were never meant to take place.
None of these measures mentioned would stop a determined attacker, but they
enable you to properly manage risk to an acceptable level.
Insider attacks are likely to occur against your organization; the questions is
whether you will be able to prevent most of them and in cases where you cannot
prevent them, can you detect them in a timely manner?
Prevention versus Detection
One saying that I use a lot is,“Prevention is ideal but detection is a must.”You
always try to prevent attacks as much as possible and in cases where you cannot pre-
vent an attack, you try to detect it in a timely manner and minimize the damage.
The problem with insider threat is that prevention does not scale very well. If
someone wants to compromise a piece of data he is going to do it.Therefore, while
prevention measures should be put in place, they must always be teamed with detec-
tive measures.You have to assume that someone with inside knowledge and access
will be able to work around the prevention measures; the key is, can you detect
them and then take follow-up action to control the damage?
When I work with many companies on insider threat, they tell me that they
want to put measures in place to detect attackers, not prevent them.Their logic is: if
we prevent someone from doing something, they will just get more sophisticated
and those more-sophisticated measures we might not know about. On the other
hand, if we detect that someone is doing something, we have the proof and can take
follow-up action to stop them by prosecuting or taking other measures against them.
In reality, what we are striving for is covert detection with reactive prevention.
The reason this is the case is that there is so much going on in a network it is very
difﬁcult to ﬁnd the malicious behavior. Many people say it is like ﬁnding a needle in
a haystack. I think it is a lot worse than that and is like ﬁnding a single grain of sand
among all the beaches in the world.

The problem with insider threat is ﬁnding enough information or having a
high-enough level of conﬁdence to know that someone is committing an insider
attack. Most of us would agree that if we are 99 percent sure that someone is com-
mitting an insider attack, we would take action against them; if we were one percent
sure, we would not take action. It is always easy to deﬁne the extremes, but what
about the area in the middle that is gray? What is the burden of proof for your orga-
nization in which you have enough information to take action?
I want you to re-read the preceding paragraph.At ﬁrst you might wonder what
it has to do with prevention versus detection, but as you read it closely, you’ll see it
is talking about behavior: having enough indication that someone is up to no good.
To gain the proper level of conﬁdence, you must gather information, which is a cat-
egory of detection. With detective measures you are monitoring and gathering
information; when you have enough data points, you take action.
I am not saying that prevention should never be used against insider threats; I am
just saying that you need a ﬁne balance between prevention and detection.
Preventive measures will stop a basic insider, which is what you want.A low-grade
attacker you just want to stop and make go away, they are not worth additional
effort. However, when it comes to high-end attackers who will put in whatever
measure is necessary to accomplish a task, prevention will not stop them. It will just
cause them to dig deeper and make it harder for you to ﬁnd them the next time
they come back. In these cases, detective measures will be key for ﬁnding and stop-
ping them.
The bottom line is, to stop the insider threat problem, an organization has to put
together a comprehensive and integrated solution of preventive and detective mea-
sures that encompass both host- and network-based solutions.
Insider versus External Threat
Arguing over whether insider versus external threat causes the most damage is what
I categorize across the industry as a holy war.A holy war is a situation where you
have smart people on both sides who disagree and the disagreement has gone on for
so long that a stalemate has occurred. Regardless what the other side says, the group
in disagreement will not listen.This is a no-win situation.The short answer that I
stated previously in this chapter is: they both can cause damage and they both have
to be addressed.
The problem to date is that most security efforts and focus have been on the
external threat.At most organizations more energy and effort have been put against
the external threat than the internal threat.The reason is simple: it is easier to stop,
easier to control, and more visible. If you have system x you can state that it should

Chapter 1 • What Is There to Worry About?
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 16

not be accessible from the Internet and put measures in place to prevent it.Then if
someone accesses it externally, it sets off a ﬂag.The problem with the insider threat is,
people are suppose to access server x but only for legitimate purposes. Now you have
to measure intent when someone accesses data, which is almost impossible to do.
In addition, the outsider threat is more understood. We understand the means
and methods and exploit scripts that are utilized to attack systems because we have a
lot of case study. With insider threat we know it is occurring and it is damaging, but
we have less factual data to base conclusions on.
Companies that are going to survive and thrive in the coming century are going
to have to turn their focus to the insider and take action against these types of
threats. Otherwise, by the time they do, there will not be much of their company left
to save.
Why the Insider 
Threat Has Been Ignored
At this point you might be saying that if the insider threat is so damaging, why has it
been ignored and why haven’t people been focusing on it early? There are many rea-
sons for this. First, it is not an easy problem. It is very hard to understand and almost
impossible to get your arms around. Both the CIA and FBI knew of the damages of
insider threat and took many measures to prevent it. However, over the past ten years
they have still been severely impacted by it.
There are three key reasons that the insider threat has been ignored:
■
Organizations do not know it is happening.
■
It is easy to be in denial.
■
Organizations fear bad publicity.
Each of these three areas will be examined in the following sections.
Organizations Do Not Know It Is Happening
Many companies do not even realize it is happening to them. Companies have good
quarters and they have bad quarters; they have times where revenue is high and they
have times when revenue is low.When the bad times occur, there are usually reason-
able explanations for them. If a company had poor earnings in a given quarter because
a new product they released did not do as well as they thought because a competitor
came out with a similar product two months earlier, it is easy to write this off to poor
www.syngress.com
What Is There to Worry About? • Chapter 1

341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 17

market analysis. Because insider threat is a relatively new area for companies, their ﬁrst
thought is not going to be that it was because of an insider attack.
As insiders keep increasing in sophistication, it is going to be harder and harder
for companies to know it is happening to them and are going to ﬁnd other explana-
tions for why the damage occurred.
We are not trying to turn companies into Chicken Little, where they run around
saying the sky is falling, but we are trying to raise companies’ awareness of what is
happening and potentially give them an alternative explanation to what is happening
when none of the conventional explanations seem to make sense. It is a hard
problem and difﬁcult to investigate, but the key thing to remember is: it will not go
away. If you ignore it, it will only get worse.Therefore, if you think there is the
potential that your organization is the victim of an insider attack, the sooner you
start working the problem, the easier it will be and the less energy you will have to
put in down the road. Insider threat is like a ﬁre.The sooner you can detect a ﬁre,
the easier it is to deal with it. Ignoring a ﬁre will not cause it to go out; it will keep
getting worse and worse over time.
I would argue that if your company has been in existence for a while and has
employees, the internal attack is occurring at some level. It might be a frustrated
employee deleting some ﬁles, or someone bringing supplies home for the children,
or people leaving sensitive documents at another location. While these might not
seem damaging, think of the ﬁre example. Do you want to put the ﬁre out now
while it is small or wait until it becomes a big problem?
It Is Easy to Be in Denial
After you admit you have a problem, you have to deal with it. One of my friends
had a drinking problem and he would never admit to it. Everyone around him kept
saying that they do not understand how he cannot recognize he has this problem. It
turned out that it was twofold. First, he always justiﬁed it in his mind and down-
played it so he thought it was not as bad as it really was. Second, he knew that once
he admitted he had a problem, he would have to do something about it, which he
did not want to do.
These things are true with any problem that a company or person faces. It is
sometimes easier to live in denial than to accept the truth and have to deal with it.
Also, some companies write it off saying that they are willing to accept a certain
level of loss to insider threat.That would be okay if they could answer these two
questions: How much are you losing to insider threat? And what is your level of tol-
erance? If companies knew the answers to these questions and could live with them,
www.syngress.com
18
Chapter 1 • What Is There to Worry About?
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 18

that would be acceptable.The problem is that most companies have no idea how
much money they are losing.
When it comes to insider threat, you are going to have to pay now or pay later
and the sooner you pay, the less you will have to pay. While it is easier to live in
denial for a short period of time, it is easier to identify and deal with the problem
now than allow it to grow worse over time.
Fear of Bad Publicity
In some cases, companies are acknowledging they have a problem and dealing with
it but not telling anyone because of the fear of bad publicity.
If a ﬁnancial institution had three large clients compromised because of an insider
attack and they publicly announced it, how many other clients would change banks
because they fear that it could happen to them? The funny thing is a bank admitting
they had a problem and ﬁxed it is more secure than a bank who claims they never had
any problems. However, when it comes to bad publicity, logic does not always hold up.
Therefore, many places would rather keep their dirty secrets inside than expose them
to the public.The real question that most executives ask is: what beneﬁt or good will
come of publicly announcing we had a problem? Except for raising awareness across
the industry, little direct beneﬁt will come to the company.
Why the Insider Threat Is 
Worse Than the External Threat
We have talked about the difference between the insider and external threat and
why the insider threat has been ignored. In this section we are going to look at why
the insider threat is potentially worse and what action must be taken to prevent and
detect these types of attacks.
Although any type of attack can cause damage, the insider threat is usually worse
for the following reasons:
■
It’s easier to implement.
■
Current solutions do not scale.
■
There’s a high chance of success.
■
There’s less chance of being caught.
www.syngress.com
What Is There to Worry About? • Chapter 1
19
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 19

Easier
In many cases the insider attack is fairly easy because the person committing the act
either has all or most of the access she needs. In addition, she has the knowledge to
pull off the attack with less chance of being caught.A person committing an
external attack has no idea what is going on at the other end. Fifteen people could
be watching and ready to take legal action against him or they could be ignoring
him. He could be very close to success or very far from it. He receives little knowl-
edge and information and because the details of the site he is attacking are
unknown, he is executing a blind attack, which is very difﬁcult.
While some inside attacks are sophisticated, many of them are very straightfor-
ward because the attacker has the knowledge and access needed to commit the
attack in a seamless manner.
Current Solutions Do Not Scale
Most security devices that are deployed at organizations are meant to stop the external
attack. Firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems
(IPS) are based off some attack vector that they are trying to prevent. Firewalls block
access to certain ports, which stops an attacker but does not stop an insider. If an
insider needs access to certain information to do his job, a ﬁrewall will allow it. If that
person uploads data to an external site or e-mails it to an unauthorized party, it is
almost impossible for a ﬁrewall to prevent. IDS and IPS work off known signatures of
attack. Most external attacks have known signatures, most internal attacks do not. In
addition, most security devices are deployed at the perimeter. Once you get past the
perimeter there are minimal internal protection measures.
As we have talked about, limiting access and implementing policies and proce-
dures are key to preventing the insider threat. It should not be surprising that most
organizations do a terrible job at controlling access and an even worse job at having
clear, consistent policies. While companies claim they are doing this, they are not
doing a good job.The analogy I like to use with security policies is that of sex when
I went to high school. When I was in high school, everyone talked about sex and
said they were having sex, but in reality, very few people were having sex and those
that were having it were doing it incorrectly. Sorry for the bluntness, but that per-
fectly describes the state of security policies today.
Security measures that are in place are mainly for the perimeter and do not scale
to the insider. Measures that will protect against the insider are hard to implement at
a large organization and do not scale very well.

341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 20

High Chance of Success
If someone gives you all the details and gives you the access you need, success is
almost guaranteed. Now, I want to be careful not to over hype how easy the insider
threat is, but I would at least argue that it is going to be easier than the external
threat. One of the reasons there are more case studies on external threat in this book
is because more people get caught. Particularly in the chapter on commercial threats
you will notice that more than half the insiders were caught when the competing
company they offered their proprietary information to contacted the authorities.
What about the companies that are not so honest and ethical? How many other
cases are out there that we are not aware of? The more people that get caught, the
better you can understand a given problem.
Even if companies have proper access control in place and solid policies, the
insider threat will be easier than the external threat for the foreseeable future.
Less Chance of Being Caught
If you know the environment and have access, you are technically not breaking in. If
you are not breaking in, the chances of being caught are much lower. If an attacker
has to maliciously compromise a ﬁrewall and use a zero-day exploit to break into a
system and is doing things that are not suppose to be done, he has a higher chance
of being detected. However, if he is accessing data that he is allowed to access but
using it a manner that he is not supposed to, it is much harder for that action to be
detected.
The Effect of Insider 
Threats on a Company
We have spent a lot of time laying the foundation for the insider threat and why an
organization needs to be concerned with it.This section is where the rubber hits the
road and we start to show how it can really impact your company and potentially
put you out of business. It is one thing to know that the insider threat exists; it is
completely different to see how it can affect your company’s bottom line.
The obvious types of insider activity focus on disgruntled employees and usually
revolve around destroying data or modifying data to cause harm to an organization
(sabotage).Although these attacks cause monetary loss, they usually are easy to detect
after the fact because the insider wants to take credit for his actions. Based on that,
these are usually one-time attacks, where once the attacker performs his actions, he
either disappears or is caught.
www.syngress.com
What Is There to Worry About? • Chapter 1

341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 21

Other types of attacks are more damaging because they are done for different
reasons, mainly ﬁnancial gain, and therefore are much harder to stop or detect.The
ﬁrst area is fraud.According to www.dictionary.com, fraud is deﬁned as:
“Deception carried out for the purpose of achieving personal gain while
causing injury to another party. For example, selling a new security issue while
intentionally concealing important facts related to the issue is fraud.”
Releasing false information to outsiders or intentionally misrepresenting a
product internally, all fall under the category of fraud.The more knowledge that you
have, the easier it is to present false information to obtain the desired results that you
are after.
One of the most damaging forms of insider threat is theft of intellectual prop-
erty (IP).Although some companies do not recognize or admit to it, every organiza-
tion that is in business has IP that must be protected. If this IP is compromised or
given to the wrong person it could undermine the ﬁnancial stability of the company.
If a company understands, recognizes, and protects its IP, it can still be compromised,
but it will be much harder. What is devastating is situations were a large percent of
internal employees have access to sensitive IP. It only takes one person to cross the
line and cause damage to the organization. In many cases, IP cases revolve around
theft or breach of conﬁdentiality of IP.
A twist on this is sabotage or modiﬁcation of critical IP. One way to damage a
company is to take sensitive IP and give it to a competitor.Another method is to
modify the IP so it does not work or causes harm, which would cause the company
to discontinue the use of that IP, which in some cases can be even more damaging.
Would you rather have a viable product that has strong competition or no viable
product regardless of the competition?
Fraud, theft of IP, and sabotage can all lead to the following:
■
Monetary loss to the organization
■
Financial instability
■
Decrease in competitive advantage
■
Loss of customers
■
Loss of consumer conﬁdence
There are many indicators that insider threat is happening at your company but
companies have to be looking in the right area to see them. If your eyes are closed
or you are looking the wrong direction, you might never realize that there is a
problem.

Chapter 1 • What Is There to Worry About?
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 22

What you have to remember is that insider attackers rarely think about the con-
sequences of their actions or when they do, they obscure the facts to justify them in
their minds.
How Bad Is It—
Statistics on What Is Happening
I can talk all day about the damage insider threat is causing companies and the cases
that I have seen, but I thought it would be helpful to list some statistics across the
industry and from recent reports.This section will show statistic, charts, and informa-
tion from external sources, to validate the damage insider threat is causing across the
world.
Insider Threat Study
The ﬁrst set of ﬁndings is from a recent report titled “Insider Threat Study: Illicit
Cyber Activity in the Banking and Finance Sector” that was written by the National
Threat Assessment Center of the United States Secret Service and the CERT
Coordination Center.The full report can be found at: www.sei.cmu.edu/
publications/documents/04.reports/04tr021/04tr021.html
The following are some critical points from the study. Each conclusive point
from the study will be listed followed by brief analysis:
Conclusion
In 87 percent of the cases studied, the insiders employed simple, legitimate user
commands to carry out the incidents. Only a small number of cases required tech-
nical knowledge of network security. For example, very few cases were carried out
via a script or program (nine percent), and only slightly more involved spooﬁng or
ﬂooding (13 percent).There was no evidence that any insider scanned computer sys-
tems to discover vulnerabilities prior to the incident.
Analysis
This report highlights that this is not a technical problem but predominately an
access problem. For external threat it is mainly a technical problem that can be
solved with security devices like ﬁrewalls, IPS, and IDS.The insider already has
access and is just using the access they have in an unauthorized manner.

What Is There to Worry About? • Chapter 1
23
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 23

Conclusion
In 70 percent of cases studied, the insiders exploited or attempted to exploit systemic
vulnerabilities in applications, processes, or procedures (for example, business rule
checks, authorized overrides) to carry out the incidents. In 61 percent of the cases,
the insiders exploited vulnerabilities inherent in the design of the hardware, software,
or network.
Analysis
One of the big problems with insiders is that they have knowledge. External
attackers cannot exploit something they do not know about.An insider knows your
organization’s deepest, darkest secrets and will utilize them to her advantage.A
trusted insider might know about a security hole and purposely not ﬁx it so she can
use it to gain access later. She might also create security holes that no one else will
ﬁnd, so she can get back in later. In most organizations, if a security engineer or
system administrator wanted to create a back door that no one else knew about and
that was virtually undetectable, he could.The reason is that most organizations do
not have enough people to implement full checks and balances and they trust that
their employees and contractors will always do the right thing.
Conclusion
In 78 percent of the incidents, the insiders were authorized users with active com-
puter accounts at the time of the incident. In 43 percent of the cases, the insider
used his or her own username and password to carry out the incident.
Analysis
In most cases, insiders are not really breaking into a system.They are just taking
advantage of access they already have. What is also interesting is that they are using
their actual accounts, so they are not trying to hide anything. Either they know the
organization’s security is so bad that they are not even looking at the logs; they do
not care if they get caught; or they are so unsophisticated about technology that they
do not even realize that someone could be watching them. With regards to the ﬁrst
item, in most cases insiders will test the waters.They will try something minor and
see if anyone notices. If no one notices they will be a little more aggressive. If after
several times no one notices, they ﬁgure they are in the clear.This is typically how
an insider is caught because over time they let their guard down and push the limits
(they get greedy) and someone notices.

Chapter 1 • What Is There to Worry About?
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 24

Conclusion
There were some cases in which the insider used other means beyond his or her
user account to perpetrate the harm.Twenty-six percent of the cases involved the
use of someone else’s computer account, physical use of an unattended terminal with
an open user account, or social engineering (that is, gaining access through manipu-
lation of a person or persons who can permit or facilitate access to a system or data).
Analysis
When performing an insider attack, even if the company is fairly secure, the weakest
link in any organization is the human link. One person leaving his terminal
unlocked for one hour on one day when he goes to a meeting provides the oppor-
tunity for an insider attack. In cases where an insider cannot ﬁnd an unlocked ter-
minal, she can usually obtain some level of access through social engineering
attempts (just asking).
Conclusion
Only 23 percent of the insiders were employed in technical positions, with 17 per-
cent of the insiders possessing system administrator or root access.
Analysis
This is no longer a revenge of the nerds situation. When insider threat is mentioned,
most people think it is perpetrated by the technical staff. On the contrary, it can be
anyone with a computer across your entire organization.Anyone who has access to
the physical building that houses your organization has the potential to commit
insider threat.This is why the problem is so difﬁcult to detect and prevent: any one
of your employees or contractors has the potential, means, and methods to cause
harm.
Conclusion
Thirty-nine percent of the insiders were unaware of the organizations’ technical
security measures.
Analysis
This is one of my favorite statistics.A little less than half of the people committing
insider threat did not know and did not care about any technical security measures
that were in place. Reading deeper into this, the technical measures did nothing to
www.syngress.com
What Is There to Worry About? • Chapter 1
25
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 25

detect or stop the attack. Reading even deeper, the reason technical measures were
ineffective is because almost 40 percent of the attacks were non-technical.
Conclusion
In 81 percent of the incidents, the insiders planned their actions in advance.
Analysis
Initially, insider attacks were mostly reactive attacks by disgruntled employees. Now
it is turning into a pre-meditated crime. People are carefully thinking about what
they want to do, learning the environment, and carefully planning the crime so they
do not get caught. Pre-meditation also implies that there is more to gain, for
example monetary rewards. If an attacker just wants to cause loss to the company, he
doesn’t have to plan too much and it is usually a one-time event. If he wants to
increase compensation to himself, it takes longer to plan it so he does not get
caught, because he wants the crime to be a recurring event.
Conclusion
In 85 percent of the incidents, someone other than the insider had full or partial
knowledge of the insider’s intentions, plans, or activities.These included:
■
Individuals involved in the incident and/or potential beneﬁciaries of the
insider activity (74 percent) 
■
Coworkers (22 percent) 
■
Friends (13 percent) 
■
Family members (9 percent) 
Analysis
No matter how good you think you are, there are always going to be others who
know about what you are doing.You see this all the time in the media after
someone is caught committing a crime and they interview their friends.There is
always a friend or co-worker who says,“We always knew Johnny was suspicious and
was up to no good; this does not surprise me at all.”The question is: why didn’t they
say anything? If you want to catch an insider, you must raise awareness among co-
workers to report suspicious activity.

Chapter 1 • What Is There to Worry About?
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 26

Conclusion
In 31 percent of the incidents, there was some indication that the insider’s planning
behavior was noticeable. Planning behaviors included stealing administrative-level
passwords, copying information from a home computer onto the organization’s
system, and approaching a former coworker for help in changing ﬁnancial data.
Analysis
A crime is never composed of a single incident.There are many sub-components
that have to occur before the actual crime is committed. In this case, the sub-com-
ponents of insider threat are usually obvious actions that can be detected, prevented,
and acted upon before the actual crime is committed.
Conclusion
Sixty-ﬁve percent of the insiders did not consider the possible negative consequences
associated with carrying out the incident.
Analysis
There are many things that make an insider tick, but most of them are selﬁsh reasons
related to the individual. Financial gain, frustration, anger, and payback are all exam-
ples. In many cases the insider fails to look at the negative actions that could occur
to them or the organization.This also ties in with the previous conclusion that other
people, including family members, knew something was going on. Clearly letting
people know the consequences of their actions and what could happen is often a
solid deterrent against insider threat.
Conclusion
The motive and goal for most insiders studied were the prospects of ﬁnancial gain
(both 81 percent).Twenty-seven percent of the insiders studied were experiencing
ﬁnancial difﬁculty at the time of the incident.
Analysis
Money is a drug that entices almost everyone to become its prisoner. Money is a
strong motivator and most people think if they had more money, that all their prob-
lems would go away.Therefore, it should be no surprise that one of the strongest
motivators of committing an insider crime is money.There is a reason that govern-
ment agencies that handle classiﬁed information require their employees and con-
tractors to ﬁll out ﬁnancial disclosure forms. Money problems can be a big indicator
www.syngress.com
What Is There to Worry About? • Chapter 1
27
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 27

of someone who might commit espionage attacks against an organization. It means
they are highly susceptible to bribes when approached with an opportunity to earn
fast money. When foreign governments are trying to recruit spies, money is usually
the number one incentive and is usually a factor they look at to determine who they
should recruit.
Conclusion
In 27 percent of the incidents, insiders had multiple motives for engaging in the
incident.
Analysis
Although money is a primary motivator, there are usually secondary motivators.This
is the straw-that-broke-the-camel’s-back syndrome. In many cases there is usually a
seemingly minor event that tips the scales to someone committing corporate espi-
onage. During analysis, many people ask how Johnny not receiving a three-percent
raise would cause him to try to destroy the company. What these analysts fail to
realize is that that was just the last straw. If you go back two years, what caused
Johnny to do this was his divorce, ﬁnancial trouble, sick parent, not getting promoted
three times, and working longer hours than anyone else. Not getting the three-per-
cent raise just pushed him over the edge.
Conclusion
Insiders ranged from 18 to 59 years of age. Forty-two percent of the insiders were
female. Insiders came from a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds and were in a
range of family situations, with 54 percent single and 31 percent married.
Analysis
For every crime, people like to put together demographics of the people who are
most likely to commit the crime. For different types of robberies, law enforcement
can tell you the demographic proﬁle of someone likely to commit the crime.This
helps law enforcement in preventing and investigating the crime because they can
focus in on a smaller group. However, with the insider, there is no demographic pro-
ﬁle.The people committing these crimes are all across the board.Therefore, anyone
at your organization could be committing corporate espionage. From the summer
intern to the 30-year-tenured executive, they all have the potential of committing
internal espionage.

Chapter 1 • What Is There to Worry About?
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 28

Conclusion
Insiders were employed in a variety of positions within their organizations,
including:
■
Service (31 percent) 
■
Administrative/clerical (23 percent) 
■
Professional (19 percent) 
■
Technical (23 percent) 
Analysis
This conclusion drives home our previous point that there is no proﬁle that can be
generated of someone who will commit insider threat.Almost every position in your
organization has sensitive information and access is all that is needed to commit this
crime. In cases where a given position does not have access, it is usually fairly easy to
obtain that access.
Conclusion
As reported earlier, only 17 percent of the insiders had system administrator/root
access prior to the incident.
Analysis
The reason the insider threat is so devastating to an organization is that almost every
position has more access than they need to do their job. So when someone decides
to turn to the dark side, they already have access to the information they need. If
organizations did a better job of controlling access to sensitive data, it would make
the insider threat more difﬁcult, easier to detect and easier to control.
Conclusion
Twenty-seven percent of insiders had come to the attention of either a supervisor or
coworker for some concerning behavior prior to the incident. Examples of these
behaviors include increasing complaints to supervisors regarding salary dissatisfaction,
increased cell phone use at the ofﬁce, refusal to work with new supervisors,
increased outbursts directed at coworkers, and isolation from coworkers.

Analysis
Many organizations say that they wish there were indicators of people who will
commit insider-threat activities.The answer is: there are. Insiders that cause harm to
the organization have visible showed behavioral and professional problems at the
ofﬁce. In many cases, organizations never tie these people back to causing damage,
but this conclusion shows that those people need to be isolated and removed from
the organization.
Conclusion
Twenty-seven percent of the insiders had prior arrests.
Analysis
What makes this conclusion even scarier is that most of the employers probably had
no idea that their employees had prior arrests. Most employers don’t perform back-
ground or ﬁnancial checks during the hiring process. If someone aces an interview,
she is hired. However, validating the background and knowing the individual you are
dealing with are critical.
Conclusion
In 61 percent of the cases, the insiders were detected by persons who were not
responsible for security, including
■
Customers (35 percent) 
■
Supervisors (13 percent) 
■
Other non-security personnel (13 percent)
Analysis
Fireﬁghters are responsible for putting out the ﬁres not for detecting the ﬁres.The
population is responsible for detecting the ﬁres and calling them in so the experts
can do their jobs. While this makes perfect sense, many companies don’t follow it.
Many companies say it is the security department’s responsible for ﬁnding security
breaches.That is one of the reasons the problem is so bad today. It is the security
department who is responsible for dealing with the problems, but it is the entire
company that is responsible for calling in the problems. Everyone must be trained to
notify the appropriate people if they see suspicious behavior.

Conclusion
In at least 61 percent of the cases, insiders were caught through manual (that is, non-
automated) procedures, including an inability to log in, customer complaints, manual
account audits, and notiﬁcation by outsiders.
Analysis
Because many of these attacks are low-tech crimes, in many cases they are detected
with low-tech methods.Automated devices will help, but nothing can replace the
analytical capability of a human. Humans must be involved and must perform the
analysis to determine if there is a problem.
Conclusion
Eighty-three percent of the insider threat cases involved attacks that took place phys-
ically from within the insider’s organization. In 70 percent of the cases, the incidents
took place during normal working hours.
Analysis
Your organization is going to be the crime scene of the attack. Many people think
that these attacks are done covertly in the middle of the night and therefore they
look for anomalies in access time. However, many attacks are committed during
normal works hours as part of a person’s job.
These conclusions should help to lay the groundwork that many of the ways
that people look at insider crime and who is committing these crimes are different
from what was originally thought. While this section focused on a speciﬁc report,
CERT also tracks computer crimes across the Internet.
The attacks are increasing exponentially and will continue to get worse. What is
interesting is that because there are so many attacks occurring and it is getting so out
of hand, CERT no longer tracks this information.
Beware of Insider Threats to Your Security
The next set of information on insider threat is from an article titled,“Beware of
insider threats to your security.”The full article can be found at www.viack.com/

The following are some of the key ﬁndings from the article:

Conclusion
The Gartner Group estimates that 70 percent of security incidents that cause mone-
tary loss to enterprises involve insiders.
Analysis
When executives ask why they should be concerned about internal threat, this
statistic is the driving theme.The reason is, it could cost your organization a signiﬁ-
cant amount of money and potentially put you out of business.
Conclusion
Credit reporting agency TransUnion recently stated the top cause of identity theft,
which the FTC reported as generating business losses of nearly $48 billion in 2003,
is now theft of records from employers that maintain records on many individuals.
Analysis
This is starting to show that the inroads of insider threat are deep and wide. Identify
theft is being traced back to the trusted insider that is using and compromising
information that they should not have access to. For any organization that maintains
sensitive information about their clients, this is a huge concern. If client information
is compromised because your organization did not properly protect it, your organi-
zation could have liability issues.Also, many states and the federal government are
looking at making it a requirement that if you think that personal information might
have been compromised, you must report it to the individual and potentially to the
government.
Conclusion
Recent FBI statistics show that 59 percent of computer hackings are done internally
(based only on what is reported).
Analysis
A long-debated issue is what percent of attacks occur from within the organization.
Although the number can be debated, the recent CSI/FBI Computer Crime Report
states that more than half of all attacks and monetary damage to an organization is
done by a trusted insider. Regardless of whether you believe the statistic or not,
insider threat is a huge problem and will only continue to get worse.

Conclusion
A source inside the United States intelligence community stated that more then 85
percent of all incidents involving the attempted theft or corruption of classiﬁed data
involved an individual who had already been thoroughly vetted and been given legal
access to that data.
Analysis
Controlling access is critical, but producing granularity of controls is even more
important. For classiﬁed information to be publicly revealed, it almost has to be an
inside job, because only insiders have access to the information.Therefore, the only
way this information can be compromised is if someone trusted either deliberately or
accidentally reveals it to someone who should not have access. Now if the US govern-
ment, which takes extensive measures to protect classiﬁed information, still has internal
compromises, is there any hope for small, non-governmental organizations?
Espionage: A Real Threat
Many companies do not even realize they are being attacked and victims of corpo-
rate espionage; and in cases where they do realize it, they are not reporting it.This is
the basis for the next article we are going to cover,“Espionage:A Real Threat,”
which can be found at: www.optimizemag.com/article/showArticle.
jhtml?articleId=17700988&pgno=3
This article shows that economic espionage is on the rise.
Preliminary System Dynamics 
Maps of the Insider Cyber-Threat Problem
The next report is an exercise that was undertaken as part of CERT.The report dis-
plays the results of what is to be deemed a work in progress. It is important to note
that it is not a complete report or a ﬁnished product. In addition, many of the ﬁnd-
ings are based on expert opinion and not factual data. Nonetheless, I though that
several of the key diagrams from the study were worth inclusion in this section with
some additional explanation.The full report can be found at: www.cert.org/archive/
pdf/InsiderThreatSystemDynamics.pdf
What is important to note is that all of the attacks included both high and low-
tech attack methods. In addition, the motivation of the attacks covered the broad
range. Nonetheless, you can see that the coverage of insider threat and the potential
damage is very broad.

Do You Really Know 
What Your Programmers Are Doing?
Anyone with any access to critical data could represent a threat to your organization.
A key group of people who have a large amount of control in an organization are
the programmers. Programmers implement applications that are either used inter-
nally or sold externally to a large number of customers. Backdoors and other prob-
lems in code could represent a large threat to intellectual property of an organization
The article “Do You Really Know What Your Programmers Are Doing?” which
can be found at www.mintaka.com/whitepaper/White%20Paper%20-
%20Security.pdf, talks about the impact of insider threat.
What is of interest is the breakdown of human threats.Although human threats
can be non-malicious and can come from outsiders, many of the threats come from
insiders.
How Much is Too Much Data Loss?
Finishing up this section, we are going to look at the article “How Much Is Too
Much Data Loss?” which can be found at http://internetnews.com/
security/print.php/3503331.
This article highlights some of the similar points that we have seen, but it is also
a good summary of the problem insider threat represents to an organization.
The following are some of the key points:
Conclusion
According to the Gartner Group, 70 percent of security incidents that occur are
inside jobs, making the insider threat arguably the most critical one facing 
enterprises.
Analysis
Although the insider threat is one of the most critical risks facing an organization,
very few organizations either recognize it or know that it exists. Many organizations
that I have worked with on insider threat recognize it as a major problem only after
there is a problem or huge monetary risk to the organization.
Conclusion
One out of every 500 e-mail messages contains conﬁdential information, customer
data, employee data, ﬁnancial information, intellectual property, or competitive infor-

mation,” said Kelly. She offered another way to look at it: a company with 50,000
employees, each sending 10 e-mail messages outside the company per day, would
incur nearly 1,000 potential data security violations per day.
Analysis
This emphasizes that the problem is occurring on a regular basis and is a part of
normal business. One of the reasons so many companies suffer from insider threat is
because it is so difﬁcult to solve. If it were an isolated problem or one that infre-
quently occurred, it would be easy to solve. However, since it is ingrained in how
people normally operate, it would require an entire paradigm shift to solve.
Conclusion
The Ponemon Institute, a private research company, recently released its 2004 Data
Security Tracking Study with alarming results. Of the 163 companies participating,
75 percent, or 122 companies, reported a data-security breach within the past 12
months.The majority of the companies were Fortune 1000.
Analysis
What is scary about this is that only a small percent of companies actually know
about and detect security breaches. If 75 percent admitted having a breach, the actu-
ally number of breaches and monetary loss is much higher.
Conclusion
A recent survey by the FBI and Computer Security Institute found that between
2000 and 2003, about 40 percent of all companies confronted an attempted informa-
tion snatch each year.
Analysis
The good news is that organizations are starting to crack down on internal threat.
The problem is that in many cases, it is too little to late.
Targets of Attack
If you do not know what someone is trying to do or target it is hard to stop them.
Therefore in order to build appropriate protection measures and to understand the
real threat, you need to understand what is being targeted.After you understand
what the attacker’s end objective is, you can not only build appropriate defense mea-
sures, but you can also test those measures to make sure they are effective.

If someone is committing insider threat, he is targeting your company; more
speciﬁcally, he is targeting your IP.At the center of the bulls-eye is your organiza-
tion’s IP.That is what ultimately differentiates your organization from the competi-
tion; it is what makes your organization unique and is the ﬁnancial engine behind its
success.
There are different levels and types of IP that can be a target of attack.The
obvious types of IP that would represent the greatest loss to your organization fall
along the lines of formulas, source code, customer lists, and marketing plans.This
obvious, or primary, IP is what forms the core of your business line. If someone asks
you what your organization does, the primary IP is most likely highlighted in that
description. For example, if you ask someone what Pepsi does, they would say they
produce soda. Even in that brief description, their primary IP is identiﬁed: the recipe
and methods for producing their brand of soda. Microsoft produces software. Once
again, even in a two-word description the organization’s IP is quickly identiﬁed.
Therefore, the ﬁrst step in the protection of your organization is to create a list of
the primary IP in your organization, minimize and control who has access to it, and
focus your attention on protecting that information.
Although primary IP is often the main focus, you cannot lose sight of the non-
obvious, or secondary, IP for your organization. While it might not be as critical as
the primary IP, it can still cause damage and has to be identiﬁed and tracked.
Secondary IP is the street address of your building, system conﬁgurations, routers,
access to critical areas, etc.These do not represent the core business line, like primary
IP does, but they support the primary IP and could still be targeted by an insider.
To illustrate the difference between primary and secondary IP, let’s look at two
examples. If a pharmaceutical employee takes the recipe for a new drug and gives it
to a competitor, she is clearly attacking the company’s primary IP. However, if a dis-
gruntled employee of an Internet sales company disconnects the primary Internet
connection so customers cannot get to the company’s e-commerce site, he is tar-
geting the secondary IP.
In both cases, it is critical to know what your primary and secondary IP are
because they will be the targets of attack.The more you can do to protect them, the
better off you will be.Although this seems easy, correctly identifying IP is often the
hardest and most-overlooked area of most companies. I guarantee you if you go up
to any key stakeholders in the company and ask them what the primary and sec-
ondary IP are for your organization, they will either miss items or be incorrect on
what those items are. Sometimes things that seem obvious and straightforward are
very difﬁcult to identify.Therefore, do not take the task of identifying IP lightly.
Spend the time and energy to do it correctly because the better job you do in iden-

36
Chapter 1 • What Is There to Worry About?
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 36

tifying the prospect of attack, the easier your job will be in protecting and pre-
venting those attacks.
Just to show you how bad the problem is, let’s assume that you have correctly
identiﬁed the IP for your organization. Now ask yourself who has access to that
information. If you are not scared enough, ask yourself the follow-up question of
even if you knew who had access, would you know who is accessing the data, when
they are accessing it, and what they are doing with it. What seemed like an easy
question is growing rapidly in complexity as you start to develop a plan of attack. In
reality, the problem of dealing with insider threat is not easy. I often compare it to
accounting for each grain of sand on a beach and making sure they do not move.
However, it is worthwhile to make the investment because if you do not, since the
threat is growing rapidly, there might not be any part of your company left once the
attacker is done.You have to always remember that the ultimate goal of an attack is
to cause harm to your company.
Now that we have looked at the main target, let’s brieﬂy examine what an
attacker could do to your primary or secondary IP. In dealing with what they can
do, we can map it back to the core areas of security: conﬁdentiality, integrity, and
availability.After you identify the IP, you have to ask yourself what the primary
attack vector is going to be. Would they try to reveal the information to someone
who should not have access (conﬁdentiality), modify it to reduce the value
(integrity), or destroy it (availability)? Typically, the high-end insider primarily
focuses on conﬁdentiality with integrity as a secondary goal.The lower-end attacker,
for example, a disgruntled employee, will usually focus on availability with integrity
as a secondary goal.
The Threat Is Real
Insider threat is no longer a ﬁctitious concept that people write about and that you
see in movies. It is real and it is happening all the time and those who do not take it
seriously may be hurt by its results.
Think of the damage that viruses and worms cause to organizations.These are
attacks that start on the Internet and manage to get through organizations’ ﬁrewalls,
perimeters, and security devices and cause severe loss. If an external worm can pene-
trate an organization with ease, what can someone who is behind the ﬁrewall and
security perimeter do? The short answer is: almost anything they want.Although
people can argue over the validity and strength of ﬁrewalls, IDS, and perimeter secu-
rity, at least there are some measures in place. When it comes to insiders, there is
little stopping them because they are a trusted entity. What is even worse than not
preventing them is not trying to detect their actions.This means that not only is
www.syngress.com
What Is There to Worry About? • Chapter 1
37
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 37

nothing stopping an insider but nothing is watching or recording their actions to
even tell something is happening.
As we talked about earlier, many organizations would rather live in denial than
ﬁx the problem. Unfortunately with a real threat, denial will only cause more harm.
The insider threat is like a tumor; if you realize there is a problem and address it, you
will have short-term suffering but a good chance of recovery. If you ignore it, it will
keep getting worse and while you might have short-term enjoyment, it will most
likely kill you.
You might be saying that you acknowledge that the threat is real, but that your
company is not vulnerable.The reality is that almost every organization is vulnerable
because almost every organization has minimal if any controls in place and they do
not carefully control access to data. Some organizations might have some basic access
controls in place, but that is not good enough. If even one person has more access
than what they need to do their job, that is too much access. Giving everyone the
least access they need to do their job is critical, plus putting auditing measures in
place to track behavior, even if you know that access is strictly controlled. What
stops someone who has legitimate access from e-mailing it to someone who should
not have access? Not only do you have to strictly control access, you must also mon-
itor it. Since too-much access it what leads to ultimate compromise and too-little
monitoring is what leads to someone not being caught or controlled, both play a
critical role in your insider threat arsenal.
More and more organizations are starting to recognize that insider threat is
important; the problem is it is after the fact. I know of a ton of companies that have
been victims to insider threat; I do not know of any that have successful stopped an
insider threat initially.All of our case studies, histories, and knowledge of insider
threat are after the problem occurs and a company gets compromised.The real
problem is, we are ﬁnding out about the problem because of the damage not
because the insiders are being caught.At least if we caught the insider after the fact
we could stop that person from doing it again. Unfortunately, we know it is hap-
pening but we do not know who did it.This creates a double-edged sword. Most
executives do not believe what they cannot see, so they initially do not take insider
threat seriously.Then, after it happens and there is critical damage, they ask why no
one warned them or told them it was a problem so they could have ﬁxed it.
So far in 2005 it is estimated that more than 10 million identities have been
stolen, with a loss of more than $50 million resulting from it. What more proof do
we want that this is a real threat? You might ask what stolen identities have to do
with insider threat.The answer is: there is a direct correlation. How is personal infor-
mation taken to steal someone’s identity? Through an insider who has access to that
www.syngress.com

Chapter 1 • What Is There to Worry About?
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 38

information for the company they work for. Credit card fraud and identity theft are
both caused by insiders stealing information they should not have access to.
The Bali bomber wrote a manifesto from jail urging terrorists to take terrorism
to cyberspace. Why? Because he knows that is a weak link that can easily be
exploited. Organizations and countries have critical infrastructures all stored in com-
puters. If that information is compromised, it could have the same impact as an
actual bomb.
The book Unrestricted Warfare, by Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui (Beijing: PLA
Literature and Arts Publishing House, February 1999), which can be downloaded at
www.terrorism.com/documents/TRC-Analysis/unrestricted.pdf, talks about how
cyber weapons will become the weapons of the future.The key fact is that this levels
the playing ﬁeld across all countries. Who can compete with the nuclear arsenal of
the U.S.? However, with cyber weapons, all the barriers to entry and monitoring are
gone. Just think if you put together two or three of the cyber weapons together in a
coordinated fashion, you would have the cyber version of the perfect storm.
Insider threat needs to be moved up in importance and discussed in boardrooms
prior to attacks, not after signiﬁcant monetary loss. Proactive measures need to be to
taken to stop insider attacks from occurring, not reactive measures to clean up 
the mess.
What is scary is there is really minimal skill needed to launch these attacks.You
really do not need to know anything if you have access.You just drag and drop infor-
mation you should not be sending outside the company and you e-mail it to a com-
petitor or a Hotmail account.Years of company IP can be extracted in minutes. Even if
you do not have access, there are tools you can download and run to get access. If you
can install MS Ofﬁce, you can install and run these tools. Unfortunately, they are really
that easy to use.The days of knowing how to write, compile, build, and exploit are
gone.These tools are publicly available, free for the taking.
The sale of stolen IP makes the stolen car industry look small time. It is hap-
pening constantly and is such a norm, that people do not even realize it.An unpro-
tected computer is an insider threat even if the user of the system is the most ethical
employee on the planet.The computer and account has trusted access, not the
person, and if someone can compromise the system because the person went to
lunch and left his system unlocked, that is a huge source of insider threat and loss for
a company.
We can predict with high reliability snowstorms and severe weather before they
occur.This early-warning system enables people to prepare and take action to help
minimize the damage.The reason we can predict weather is because we look for
indicators using radar and other advanced techniques. We need to develop cyber
indicators. Some initial indicators that could show a company is vulnerable are: no
www.syngress.com
What Is There to Worry About? • Chapter 1
39
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 39

or weak policies, weak passwords, and no list of critical assets. If we can better iden-
tify and track these cyber indicators, we will have a better chance of reacting to the
problem.
Proﬁling the Insider
One problem with the insider threat is there is no single proﬁle that can be used to
help identify who might be committing these crimes. With other crimes there are
clear proﬁles you can look for.There is a set proﬁle for the person who would rob a
gas station or commit rape. However, with insider threat there is no demographic
proﬁle. People who have been caught vary in age, sex, social background, and educa-
tion and cover the entire range of categories of people.
There was one report that had a proﬁle for the person most likely to commit
insider threat.The proﬁle was someone in their mid 30s, works long hours, logs into
the company at night, sometimes works weekends, drinks, smokes, and is divorced. I
laugh because that covers almost everyone I know.Therefore rash attempts like this
never really generate anything meaningful in terms of a demographic proﬁle.
One of the biggest indicators of an attacker is someone who is highly frustrated
with his company and/or boss and who openly admits to his frustration and dissatis-
faction with his job.You unfortunately see this all the time, when someone goes into
work and shoots someone and they interview their co-workers and they say,“Johnny
always talked about doing this, we knew it would happen someday and was only a
matter of time.”You think, why didn’t anybody say anything or the boss do anything
about it.The problem is in the past people never took this very seriously. Management
and co-workers have to realize that these verbal outbreaks could be a pre-cursor to
additional actions and if acted upon early, the crime could be prevented.
Most of the attacks were never very technical in nature. Based on the wide range
of access most people have, it is fairly easy for people to commit these crimes. Many
people committing the crimes have been at the company for 3-5 years, so they are
viewed as trusted entities. Finally, many of the people committing the crimes justify
the crimes in their minds and do not fully understand the repercussions of their
actions. In one case a spouse said,“I knew my husband was doing this but I never
thought he would get arrested and be put in jail. I wish I had said something
sooner.” In another case, the person blamed the company because he had to get an
expensive operation and since the company would not give him a bonus he felt it
was his right to commit the crime.
The motives for committing the crimes cover a broad spectrum, but the main
areas are ﬁnancial gain, revenge, and retaliation for a negative work environment. In
addition, most of the insiders that were caught got caught because they were greedy,
www.syngress.com
40
Chapter 1 • What Is There to Worry About?
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 40

they bragged, or they got sloppy. Unfortunately, this means that the good criminals
rarely get caught.
Preventing Insider Threat
There is no single thing that you can do to prevent an insider threat.The concept of
defense in depth applies here as it does to all areas of security. No single solution is
going to make you secure. Only by putting many defense measures together will you
be secure and those measures must encompass both preventive and detective measures.
Some of the key things that can be done to prevent or minimize the damage of
the insider threat are the following:
■
Security awareness Employees, contractors, and any other insiders need
to be educated on how to protect corporate assets.They need to under-
stand the dangers and methods of social engineering and be careful what
information they give out.They also have to be cognizant that insiders
could exist at their company and not only do their part to protect corpo-
rate assets (for example, locking their workstations), but they also have to
look for indications of insider threat and report them to the correct parties.
■
Separation of duties Any critical job function or access to critical infor-
mation should involve two or more people.This prevents a single person
from committing an inside attack.
■
Rotation of duties All critical jobs should have multiple people who
perform the roles and those people should be rotated through periodically.
If a person knows that someone else is going to be performing a given role
in two months, it will be much harder for them to commit fraud or other
insider attacks, because there is a good chance someone might catch it later.
■
Least privilege Any additional access that someone has can be used
against the company.Although access is needed for people to perform their
jobs, this access should be carefully controlled. People should be given only
the access they need to do their jobs and nothing else.
■
Controlled access Access is what someone is going to use to compro-
mise an organization.The more a company knows what access people have,
the better they can control it.
■
Logging and auditing Organizations must know what is happening on
their network and this information must be reviewed on a regular basis. If
someone’s actions are not logged, a company will have no idea who did
what and will not be able to detect the insider. Even if this information is
www.syngress.com
What Is There to Worry About? • Chapter 1
41
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 41

logged, if it is not reviewed on a regular basis, an organization will not be
able to catch an attacker in a timely manner.
■
Policies A policy states what a company’s stance is on security and what is
expected of anyone with inside access.A policy is a mandatory document
that is clear and concise and that everyone must follow. If a policy does not
exist, how do insiders know what is expected of them? I once knew an
employee that bragged about making copies of software when he left a
company. When I questioned his concern of legality and theft, he replied
simply by saying,“I never signed anything.”This information must be pre-
sented to them in a way that they understand and it must be made clear
that they have to follow it.
■
Defense in depth When it comes to network security, there is no silver
bullet. No single solution is going to make you sure. Organizations must
deploy a layered security model, with checks and balances across each layer.
■
Look beyond technology Many inside attacks are not technology
driven. Organizations must realize that non-technology-based solutions
need to be implemented across the company.
■
Archive critical data Any critical information must be properly archived
and protected.This way all the IP is not in one place if a system gets
destroyed or compromised.
■
Complete solution Any solution that is implemented must include all
aspects of the company: people, data, technology, procedures, and policies.
New World Order
The world is a different place than it used to be. Insider threat is occurring and it is
increasing at a rapid pace. Organizations that do not understand it or are not willing
to get on the bandwagon are going to suffer damage and loss. Organizations that are
going to survive have to realize the threat is real and take action immediately,
because most likely the damage has already begun beneath the surface.
Organizations must understand that security is an ongoing task that must con-
stantly be done and readjusted. Security goes way beyond technology and is never
complete.There is no such thing as 100 percent security. Which means you will
never get it right but you have to keep trying to get it close enough. In order to
properly implement security you must understand the organization’s structure, mis-
www.syngress.com
42
Chapter 1 • What Is There to Worry About?
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 42

sion, and politics so security can be seamlessly integrated. Security is a means to an
end but it is not an end state.
There are some insiders who will do anything they have to in order to compro-
mise your organization. However, there are a lot of insiders who just take advantage
of opportunity.They are working on a system, they ﬁnd a problem, no one is
watching and they take advantage of it.The determined insider will always be a
problem, but the opportunistic insider can be stopped by organizations with com-
prehensive, integrated security solutions.
Many people, who have been at companies for several years and have been
caught committing insider threat, were found to have less-than-perfect backgrounds
when they were investigated.They had criminal records that the company never new
about.Think of the damage that could have been saved if the company did the
proper checks prior to the incident as opposed to after.
If you want to ﬁnd where the hole is in a tire, you put it under water and see
where the bubbles come out. Now, we are not suggesting that you hold your
employees’ heads under water until they confess, but we are saying that if you
tighten down security you will quickly see the problem areas emerging.
Future Trends
We have covered a lot of ground in this chapter and felt that an appropriate sum-
mary would be necessary to cover the future trends that we see occurring in the
industry.
Policies and Procedures
Many companies, from a cyber perspective, lack clear control and direction in terms
of protecting and controlling access to their critical assets. While companies are
focusing on long-term strategic plans for their organizations, they need to address
the critical IP and put together clear guidelines for what is expected of their
insiders.As we move forward, the lack of solid policies is going to manifest itself
more and more in companies. Companies that are serious about the insider threat
are going to realize that the old style of inefﬁcient policies is no longer going to
work.Therefore, instead of trying to re-work existing policies, companies are going
to realize that they are going to have to re-write their policies from scratch.
It is critical with any organization that everyone is on the same page with
regards to protection of information. Just because you have a policy does not mean
people will follow it; however, without the policy as the starting point, there is no
way you can perform consistent enforcement across an organization. While it is difﬁ-

cult, and executives never want to put things in writing, it is critical that a clear, con-
cise policy with appropriate repercussions be put in place.
Access Controls
Access is the gateway in which the insider threat is manifested.Typically, in most
organizations, access control is poorly implemented and poorly understood. Moving
forward, companies are going to have to change this.Those that have been burnt in
the past by insider threat or those that want to make sure they do not get burnt
moving forward, will have to take the time to properly control access to critical data.
This is a multi-staged process, involving identifying critical IP, determining who
should have access to it, and controlling and tracking that access.
Miniaturization
Data and critical IP is at the heart of any organization and extracting and compro-
mising that information is at the heart of insider threat.As technology continues to
advance, storage devices are going to become smaller and smaller and embedded in
other devices. Storage devices that ﬁt in watches or pens and that are the size of
pennies will make it much harder to be able to track and control this information.
Attackers are always going to take the easiest path or exploit the weakest link when
they are compromising an organization, and with storage technology getting smaller
and smaller, the physical attack will become that much easier.
Even with guards and other physical security measures, it is too easy for
someone to walk out with large amounts of information.Therefore companies are
going to have to do a better job of locking down computers. In reality, do most
individuals at a company need access to USB, serial, and parallel ports on their com-
puters? The short answer is no.They have backup and storage across the network,
there is not a legitimate reason we should be handing out laptops and desktop com-
puters that make it trivial for this information to be extracted.Through software and
hardware, these devices can be disabled and locked down to stop someone from
using them in an inappropriate manner.As storage devices become so tiny that they
can pass through any guard, companies will have to react by implementing a prin-
ciple of least privilege at the hardware level.
Moles
As perimeters continue to be tightened down and new security devices get added to
the perimeter arsenal, external attacks are going to become more and more difﬁcult.
As external attacks become more difﬁcult it is not going to be worth the attackers’
www.syngress.com

Chapter 1 • What Is There to Worry About?
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 44

efforts.They are going to rely more on the use of moles to extract the data and
cause damage to organizations. Planting an insider as a mole is as trivial as putting
together a résumé, acing an interview and getting hired.Taking an insider and con-
verting them to a mole is as easy as ﬁnding a weakness and exploiting it.Two
common weaknesses are money and blackmail. It is usually easy to ﬁnd someone
who has some ﬁnancial trouble. Offering them money to help them out is a tempta-
tion some people cannot resist. In addition, most people have deep, dark secrets.
Finding out those secrets and threatening to reveal them is another way to convince
people to cooperate.
Since moles are so easy and extremely effective, attackers are going to rely more
and more on this method to accomplish their goals.This is why performing thor-
ough background checks and validating employees and monitoring them is going to
be even more critical.
Outsourcing
Outsourcing is becoming a norm for companies of all sizes.The cost-beneﬁt analysis
not only points to the fact that it is here to stay but that it is going to increase in
popularity moving forward.This section is not implying in any way that outsourcing
is bad, it is just pointing out that with outsourcing comes new challenges and con-
cerns that a company has to be aware of.
With outsourcing, you are taking the zone of insiders and increasing it to the
outsourcing company. In most situations, any source code that would be outsourced
is considered IP for the company.Therefore, there is now a whole new group of
people that will not only have access to the source code but could also make inad-
vertent changes to the code or create backdoors. Conﬁdentiality can be controlled
thought NDA, contractual agreements, background checks, and internal isolation by
the outsourcing company. Integrity checks require that any code, whether it is out-
sourced or not, be validated by a separate party. Whether code is developed inside
your company or outside there is the potential that an insider can create back doors
to cause problems at a later point in time.Therefore third-party testing and code
review must be performed to minimize the potential damage.
Porous Networks and Systems
As new functionality and enhancements are added to networks, they are and will
continue to become more porous.A more porous network means the number and
chances of having outside afﬁliates increases.As more holes are punched through the
ﬁrewalls and wireless and extranet connections are set up, the exposure of the critical
www.syngress.com
What Is There to Worry About? • Chapter 1
45
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 45

infrastructure increases and the number of potential people who can access critical
IP also increases.
Therefore, organizations need to understand that these phenomena are hap-
pening and build in appropriate controls at the host and server level.
Ease of Use of Tools
Attack tools are not only increasing in ease of use but also increasing in capability
and functionality. In the past, manual methods were required to use tools to gain
access. In the future, the tools will become completely automated. Now, an insider
who does not have proper access can gain access through the use of one of these
tools. Because the landscape is going to continue to increase in complexity from a
defense standpoint, the sooner that companies can start to defend against the insider
threat the easier it will be.
Relays on the Rise
Attackers do not want to spend money on expensive resources or attack from their
own systems because it is traceable. Instead, attackers use relays.A relay is a site that
has weak security; the attacker breaks into the site and sets up a safe haven. From this
site she can load all her tools and launch attacks. Now she is using someone else’s
resources and if a victim traces back the address it will go to the relay site and not
the real attacker.This concept is not new, but moving forward it is going to be taken
to a new level.
Attackers are going to start to compromise and inﬁltrate entire companies and
use them as massive control centers for insider attacks. In essence, corporations will
inadvertently be sub-funding illicit activity because they have poor security. If I am
going to launch a massive insider attack, I need resources, I need Internet connec-
tivity, and what better place to ﬁnd it than a large company that has redundant T1 or
T3s and extra servers? In essence, attackers are ﬁnding that organizations provide
them “free” collocation services.
You might ask, while a company would prefer this does not happen, what is the
big concern? The biggest concern with this happening to an organization is down-
stream liability.This means that if your company has such weak security that they
allow themselves to be a launching-off platform, they could potentially be held lia-
bility for being grossly negligent in securing their enterprise. Not only could this
cause serious monetary issues for a company, but if legal action is taken, the case is
public and that could result in bad reputation, loss of customer conﬁdence, and loss
of customers.

Social Engineering
The weakest link in any organization is the people. Since most insiders had full
access it has always been easy to just compromise an insider. However, as companies
start to tighten controls, full access is going to be limited and taken away.Therefore,
attackers need other ways to get the information or access they need; the solution:
social engineering.
Social engineering is human manipulation where you pretend to be someone
you’re not with the sole goal of gaining access or information you otherwise would
not have.
Social engineering is a very powerful, yet easy tool at the attacker’s disposal.As
social engineering attacks increase, organizations need to do a better job at educa-
tion, making people aware, and defending against these types of attacks.
Plants
When many people think of insider threat they think that as soon as someone has
access, they will commit the act immediately. While this would seem logical, it is
easy to trace and the person is usually limited in access and capability.A good insider
knows that patience is the key.
More and more governments are putting plants in competing companies in for-
eign countries.They view this as a long-term investment, so they will give you a
fully qualiﬁed candidate to work at your company.This person will work their butt
off for many years, learning the process, gaining trust, getting promoted, and then
eventually will slowly start to extract sensitive information from the company.
This model is highly effective and very hard to detect and trace. No one thinks
that someone would get hired at a company and work very hard so that in ﬁve years
he could compromise data.To many of us it does not make sense, but to the skilled
attacker or government organization it is a worthwhile investment.
Tolerance Increasing
As attacks increase, people’s tolerance for pain increases.There are worm outbreaks
and other attacks that three years ago would have made the front page of every
paper, but today they do not even get a mention because people’s tolerance for this
type of behavior is increasing. Instead of doing something about it, we are accepting
it as a norm.
This model is very dangerous because as soon as you get in the acceptance
mode, the problem will keep getting worse and worse and no one will notice.
www.syngress.com
What Is There to Worry About? • Chapter 1
47
341_INS_THR_01.qxd  11/18/05  6:51 PM  Page 47

Something has to change; otherwise, the impact of the insider will cause such ﬁnan-
cial loss that it will impact the entire economic infrastructure.
Framing
As attackers get more sophisticated, they are looking for ways not to get caught.
Especially in the case of the plant, if you worked three years in an organization you
would want to get a lot of mileage out of it and not commit one act of insider
threat and get caught.The easiest way to not get caught is to frame someone else.
Instead of using your own identity, more and more attackers are compromising and
using someone else’s identity so that person gets blamed for the attack. If a skilled
attacker does this properly, he can build up so much evidence against the person he
is framing that there is no questioning or doubt in anyone’s mind who committed
the insider attack.
This trend is very scary because now you have innocent people becoming vic-
tims, in addition to the company.Therefore it is very critical that companies carefully
examine the facts to make sure they are not punishing the wrong person.
Lack of Cyber Respect
It is amazing, but we are raising a generation today that has minimal respect for the
cyber world.The total lack of appreciation and understanding of cyber ethics is
downright scary. Many people would never think of stealing someone’s wallet, but
they have no problem reading people’s e-mail or compromising their user ID and
password.
As organizations put together new policies and procedures, they have to realize
that they have a long road ahead of them in changing how people perceive and act
towards information that exists in a digital format. By covering the future trends, you
will help your organization properly build defensive measures against the insider
threat that will not only work today but scale tomorrow.
Summary
This chapter was meant to serve as an introduction to how bad the problem is and
why you should be concerned about it. Some problems if you ignore them they
will go away, this problem will only continue to get worse. It is important that
organizations understand the risks that insider threat can have, realize it is occurring
today and take action to minimize or prevent the damage that it can cause.

Introduction
In the previous chapter we laid the foundation for insider threat. We raised awareness
and showed that it is a serious problem that requires serious attention. Insider threat
has always been around, but with the widespread use of the Internet and computers,
it has created a new arena that will allow insider threat to ﬂourish like we have never
seen it before. In an ofﬁce full of paper there was always the potential for someone
to copy a piece of paper that they were not supposed to copy, carry a paper copy of
a document out of a facility, or tell someone what they read about.This problem of
having a trusted insider use his or her access and knowledge to hurt the company
always existed, but it was bound.
The methods that could be used before computers and the Internet to commit
insider threat were limited:
■
Extraction of a document in its original form
■
Copy with potential miniaturization
■
Faxing
■
Verbal word of mouth
■
Modiﬁcation of information
■
Destruction of information
To commit insider threat an attacker has to focus on compromising the conﬁ-
dentiality, integrity, or availability of critical IP across the organization. Even though
there were methods to do this prior to the widespread use of computers and the
Internet, they were controlled and bounded.
The easiest and most straightforward method, which still works today, is extrac-
tion of a document in its original form out of the organization.This could also
entail physical relays, where someone gives the document to another department or
group, who eventually transferred it out of the organization. One of the best and
easiest ways I have seen attackers do this is via mail. Many organizations had guards
that checked your bag when you left so it would be hard to walk out with a classi-
ﬁed document in your briefcase. However, if I took that document from within the
building and put it within an envelope with a stamp, no one would check it.There
was a case where an organization would actually check mail and briefcases, but not
FedEx packages.The reason is that there was a separate process and approval for
being able to use FedEx, and when they set it up they were not thinking about
insider threat.Yet an insider quickly found this as the best path for extracting infor-

mation from the company.Although we might not always think about it, attackers
will always ﬁnd the weakest link and exploit it.
This is one of the reasons why it is critical to have a document classiﬁcation
scheme in place. In this book we are talking about classiﬁcation scheme in a general
sense. It does not matter if you are a government intelligence organization or a
Fortune 500 company; you need some way to be able to mark and protect informa-
tion.The government might use the term “top secret,” and a commercial company
might use the term “company proprietary” or “trade secret”; however, the level of
protection remains the same.The documents must be marked and done so in a clear
and consistent fashion. If documents are not properly classiﬁed and marked, how
would a guard or anybody be able to determine that you should not be leaving with
a sensitive document? Some easy criteria have to be used so that spot checks can be
performed.
Traditionally organizations would mark documents just at the bottom of the
document.The problem with this method is if someone was quickly looking at the
document, they might miss the marking at the bottom. Based on the limitations,
organizations would then mark at the top and bottom of the document.Although
this was easy to spot, it still had some limitations.The main limitation was that if
someone made a copy of the document they could cover up or cut off the labels at
the top and bottom and conceal the actual level of the document.This is why today
companies use a watermark on the page that goes behind the text.This can be seen
in the Figure 2.1.

This makes it much harder for someone to try to remove and cover it up. I have
seen cases where someone has tried to use white out to cover it up, but that does
not work very well.Another method used is to mark each paragraph with a sensi-
tivity label.Although this method works, it is harder for the person creating the doc-
ument, plus a spot check could easily miss it because you would have to look much
closer at the document.
A slight twist on this is to make a copy of the document and take the copy out
with you. One advantage of making a copy is if the document has document con-
trol, where it has to be checked in or out if you left with the original, someone
would know the document was missing. However, if I made a copy, I would be able
to return the original to document control and take the copy home with me.The
other advantage of copying is many copy machines have advanced features.These
features could be used to make the document smaller in size and easier to conceal. If
you have a single-sided document that is 100 pages, making a copy double-sided can
cut the document in half.
Copy machines also having settings where you can reduce the contrast and make
the copy either lighter or darker. I have seen cases where the watermark is so light
that you could reduce the contrast by making a copy and removing the watermark.
If you make a second copy with a darker contrast, the text will darken back up but
the watermark will have been removed.
Many copiers also have size reduction capability.This is advantageous for many
reasons. First it allows you to make a document much smaller in size. If I have a
100-page document and I reduce each page to 50%, now I can ﬁt two pages per one
printed page. If I use full duplex, I can reduce the document down to 25 pages. If I
am a trying to remove a large number of documents, this can be the difference in
slipping some documents in my briefcase and having to carry out a big box, which
raises the suspicion level.
In addition to using copy machines to do this there are miniaturized cameras
that have been developed just for this purpose.The cameras are very small and can
easily ﬁt within a pocket or embedded within a watch or a pair of glasses to make it
very hard to detect. Now the attacker can take pictures of the document, leave with
them on the tiny device, and then develop the pictures once they are at a safe
facility.This technique and method has been around for a long time and is best illus-
trated in the movie,“Wall Street.” It is actually not a bad movie to watch, but in the
movie, the main character wants to commit insider trading. He works at the com-
pany but does not have access to his boss’s ofﬁce. He uses his internal knowledge of
the organization to ﬁgure out where the sensitive documents are kept and when his
boss leaves. Now he knows what he has to do and when he has to do it; he just
needs to get access.To get access he interviews with the cleaning service that cleans
www.syngress.com
52
Chapter 2 • Behind the Crime
341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 52

the ofﬁces and gets a job working in the evening.To perform his job with the
cleaning service he needs keys to all the ofﬁces. Since the cleaning company times
you for each ﬂoor, he actually cleans some of the ofﬁces very quickly so he can
spend more time in his boss’s ofﬁce and not have it look suspicious. When he is in
his boss’s ofﬁce, he pulls out a miniature camera that he bought at the local elec-
tronic store and starts taking pictures of all the sensitive documents.Although this
method works, I have also seen cases where you could look through the garbage to
extract data.An ideal case that would also ﬁt well is if I have access and can make
copies but I cannot leave with a large amount of documents. I could also get a job
with the cleaning service and us the large trash can on wheels as a means for getting
the document out of the building. I then come back later that night and extract the
documents from the dumpster.There are lots of opportunities and unconventional
methods people will use to accomplish their task of insider threat.
Although simple and straightforward faxing is a method that, despite all the
technological advances today, still has its spot in the ofﬁce. Prior to computers and
even today, if you needed to send a document to someone very quickly, faxing was a
method for doing this using traditional phone lines. Most organizations have or had
fax machines on almost every ﬂoor, so it would be relatively easy for someone to be
able to take a document and extract it out of the company using the fax. Once
again, even companies that have guards checking bags when you leave usually do not
have checks at the fax machines. One company I know of actually had checks at the
fax machine.The fax machines were locked in a person’s ofﬁce and they had to per-
form all faxing.This allowed them to be able to review the fax prior to sending it
out. Even in this case, the system could be bypassed if this person was on vacation or
not in the ofﬁce. However, there was even an easier way that an insider found. Fax
machines could be purchased relatively cheaply.This person bought a fax machine,
plugged it in at the ofﬁce, shut the door, and began faxing, allowing him to bypass
all corporate controls. In this case, the funny part about it is the insider expensed the
fax machine back to the company and the boss approved it.
Although fax machines and miniature cameras present their own challenges, at
least there is still physical IP leaving the organization so proper perimeters and
checking can still potentially ﬂag it.The harder problem is when there is nothing to
catch or stop, and the information is stored in an intangible format—someone’s
brain. Unless technology advances there is no way to scan someone’s brain and make
sure that he or she is not leaving with anything critical, and even if we could, it
would be much harder to determine that the person intends to do harm with that
information. Verbal word of mouth is probably the easiest and still one of the most
common methods for extracting data out of the organization. I read a sensitive doc-
ument, remember key facts, and walk out of the organization with nothing tangible.
www.syngress.com
Behind the Crime • Chapter 2
53
341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 53

No matter what checks are in place, there is no way they can stop you.Then you
would meet up with someone at a remote location and give them a data dump of
the critical data.
There is no way someone will remember a 50-page document word by word,
but most people can remember the key or critical facts that could still result in a
compromise.You can perform this experiment with a book.After someone reads a
book, ask them to recite the entire book, word by word—they will not be able to
do it. However, if you ask them for the general plot, the critical facts, and even the
key characters, I am sure they will be able to do it.This is a big problem and comes
down to controlling access. If someone is not able to read a document, they will
never be able to repeat it to someone else.This problem is where the saying during
World War II came from:“Loose Lips, Sink Ships.” People have to learn that what
happens at work stays at work.
All the methods we talked about apply mainly to disclosure of information:
someone who has special access revealing sensitive information to someone who
should not have access.This is the main thrust and focus of insider threat, and it
requires removal of information from the organization in some format, which could
be hard and risky in some organizations. In cases where you cannot extract data
from an organization, having access within the walls of the organization, an insider
can still cause harm in two other areas: modiﬁcation of information (integrity) and
destruction of information (availability).
Ideally as an insider spy, my ultimate goal is to be able to get a copy of the data;
however, I do not want to blow my cover and get caught.Therefore if I cannot get the
information out of the company, if I can modify the data I still provide a better service
for the ultimate company I am working for by causing harm to its competitor. If I
modify sales projection, I can cause reputational damage. If I can modify a proposal
with the wrong numbers, I can cause ﬁnancial harm to the organization. If I modify
critical formulas or controls for critical systems, I could cause lawsuits that would result
in both ﬁnancial and reputational harm.Though integrity is not always the ﬁrst choice,
it can still provide beneﬁt.
Destruction of information is typically the main form of a disgruntled employee
who is not looking for a direct beneﬁt but trying just to cause harm to the organiza-
tion or punish the organization for the way he or she has been treated. Destruction,
depending on the level and technique that is applied, can be very easy and simple to
do. It can also be used as a last resort if extracting the data out of the organization
does not work. Ideally a competitor wants to be able to get a copy of the latest pro-
posal a company is submitting so they can underbid them. However, if you cannot
ﬁnd out that data, but you can destroy all copies of the proposal two days before it is
due, in essence you have accomplished the same net effect. By destroying the pro-
www.syngress.com
54
Chapter 2 • Behind the Crime
341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 54

posal you will not be able to bid, and now since your company is not submitting a
proposal I no longer have to worry about outbidding you. In some cases this could
offer a big advantage because if you know you will be the only bid then price really
is less important than before.
It is important to note that although these methods were used before there were
computers, these methods will still work today.This is why organizations have to be
so careful and make sure they look at the big picture. I have seen companies that are
so focused on computers, they forget about the obvious and let people walk out the
front door with documents in their brief cases.Their cyber security is so secure that
you would not be able to do this electronically, but their physical security measures
are so overlooked that an attacker could exploit that area with ease.
Although these traditional methods we just discussed could still cause harm to
the company, it was something you could get your arms around and defend and
detect. It was a known problem that was bounded in its methods and complexity.
Therefore there were methods that could be used to counter this activity and the
methods were known and understood, and if performed correctly, worked.
The following were some of the methods that were used to protect against this
type of attack:
■
Marked, color-coded covers
■
Locks
■
Guards
■
Locked rooms with checks
■
Spot checks
■
Separation of duties
There is no such thing as 100% preventive measures, but the trick is to try to
defend as much as possible and hope with proper awareness and training that most
people will do the right thing.
One way to prevent information from leaving the organization is to carefully
mark documents, both top and bottom, and with a watermark, as we discussed ear-
lier. Something else that is helpful is putting a cover sheet on every document.A red
cover sheet means the document should never leave the company, a yellow cover
sheet means it can leave only if it is properly secure, and a white cover sheet means
the document contains no sensitive information. Now you can argue that someone
can just remove the cover sheet. However, a document without a cover sheet is an
immediate ﬂag because every document must have a cover sheet. If removing a
www.syngress.com
Behind the Crime • Chapter 2
55
341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 55

cover sheet is easy I can just as easily remove a red cover sheet and put a white cover
sheet on top.Although that is correct, that is still a little harder.
There is no perfect solution—the trick is to keep modifying the solution to the
point where is comes prohibitively harder for someone to bypass it.At one Fortune
500 company, they used the color-coded sheets, but each cover sheet had to have the
document’s name printed on it and a manager’s signature verifying that the cover
sheet and document named matched. Once again, people can always be tricked but
this made it a lot harder for someone to bypass. Now you would have to involve
other people to bypass the system, and even if you think your boss may not actually
check, it is still a risky thing to do.
Fear of being caught is a big driving factor, an advantage of using this method.
Most people will not chance having the boss sign a form in which the cover sheet
does not match the title. With proper training, bosses should be made aware that
checking documents on a regular basis is vital, plus periodically telling employees
they are going to review documents to make sure they match the covers keeps
people on their toes. If you are a boss that is known for carefully reviewing docu-
ments, once you catch one or two people and the word spreads, the chances of
someone else trying to do this would be very slim.
Locks, though fairly basic, can be very effective at controlling and preventing
access. If someone cannot get into a room or cabinet it becomes harder for them to
cause harm. If you cannot get access to something you cannot disclose it, you cannot
modify it, and you cannot destroy it.The effectiveness of this control depends on the
type of lock you are using and how the key to the lock is controlled.The lock is not
what protects the data, it is the conﬁdentiality and control of the key that keeps the
data secure. Key accountability and key control are the driving success factors behind
the effective use of locks.Therefore the more carefully you can control the key and
track accountability, the higher the effectiveness of the lock.
Standard locks such as key-based locks controls access, but there is not a high
grade of accountability of the key. People can give the key to someone else, they can
make copies of the keys, and they can loose the keys. If 20 people all have a key to a
given room and something is missing from the room, it will be very difﬁcult to tell
which of the 20 people did it.The other problem with standard locks that is often
misused is the master key.A master key can get into any ofﬁce. Even if I am the only
one with a key to my ofﬁce, but three people have a master key, we still have not
achieved accountability.
The next general category of locks is something that can be tied to an indi-
vidual, such as an access card. Each person has a different access card and is given
permission to the areas needed to access in order to work. Even though 20 people
have access to a room, since they each have a different access card, we can still have

56
Chapter 2 • Behind the Crime
341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 56

accountability and know at any instance which speciﬁc individual gained access.The
problem with access cards is people can still lend them to others and lose them.
Biometric-based locks are the ﬁnal general category of locks. Here, the key of
the lock is tied to a personal attribute such as a hand scan, a retina scan, or voice
recognition, just to name a few.The advantage of this method is that it is tied to the
person and cannot be borrowed or lost. It is always with you and depending on the
method is usually good for 15 or more years.The disadvantage is that these devices
can be fairly expensive and some people are still distrustful of giving away their per-
sonal attributes so the company can always track them.
Guards also serve as an effective measure for preventing insider threat. Guards can
provide effective choke points and have detailed analytical capability if they are trained
correctly. Guards can be trained to be located at all critical perimeters and perform
spot checks, looking for suspicious activity and stopping individuals.They can also ask
people what they are leaving with and why. Some people do not see the value in
questioning because they say that it will catch only honest people because attackers
will lie, but combined with other techniques, it can show intent. If I ask you as you get
off the elevator if you have any laptops or data storage devices that you are leaving
with and you say no, then at the exit another guard checks your bag and ﬁnds a
laptop, now we know that you have intentionally lied and tried to bypass the system.
Without the ﬁrst step of asking you a question, during the spot check you could have
claimed that you did not know you were not supposed to have a laptop. However,
now because we used a two-step process, you were caught red-handed.
In addition to being placed at perimeters, guards also have value walking around
the facility looking for suspicious activity and performing random spot checks. If I
know that no one else is around, I can make copies and fax sensitive data without
anyone knowing. However, if I now know that a guard could walk by at any
moment looking for unusual activity, and the activity I am currently performing is
highly suspicious, I might be less tempted to continue my activities. In addition to
looking for suspicious activity the guards can also do what is termed a traditional
spot check just to make sure people are following procedures and doing what they
are supposed to be doing. If all sensitive documents are supposed to be locked up if
they are not in your possession and a guard ﬁnds a sensitive document on a desk
with no one around, this represents a security violation. Just because a person left a
document on a desk does not mean they are out to cause harm. However, the fact
that anyone else could walk by and see the document represents an avenue where an
untrusted entity could take the document or read it and gain access to information
they should not have access to.
If a document is very sensitive, it should be locked in a room and not allowed to
be removed. Now people can come in read the document and leave but the docu-

Behind the Crime • Chapter 2
57
341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 57

ment can never leave with them. If the room containing the document does not
contain any phone lines, copy machines, or other electronic equipment the chances
of someone being able to extract the document is very slim. In addition, if the room
requires two different people to open and you have to sign in and out and you are
being monitored as you are examining the document, this also adds additional mea-
sures of protection.
We alluded to it when we talked about locked rooms, but separation of duties is
another effective measure to defend against traditional insider threat. If only a single
person is responsible for performing a task it is easy for that person to abuse privi-
leges and cover up any malicious activity he or she is doing. However, if two people
are involved with any task it would be much harder for any one individual to cause
harm on his or her own.
Although these security methods seem basic and straightforward, they work and
they solved the problem. Before computers, insider threat was still a problem, but
companies knew how to control it and if they were concerned enough about it they
could take action. It was not a problem that was out of control, where the attacker
clearly had the upper hand.
Now that you have added computers, the Internet, and the mobile work force,
just to name a few, we have a whole different ball game. Now, the potential for loss
is huge and the methods they can utilize are numerous.
However, do not discount these measures. Even though they are not the main
focus of this chapter, they still have value and use today, and sometimes the simple
solutions work better than the more complex solutions.
Overview of Technologies
Technologies typically are going to serve as the basis for insider threat attacks. Even
though simple, nontechnical attacks still work and are effective, they are not the
focus of this chapter.They were covered in the introduction to lay the foundation.
The main focus is to give an overview of key technologies and how they can be
used to cause harm and damage across your organization.
It is important to remember that this is not a comprehensive list, and technolo-
gies are always changing. However, there are certain technologies that must be
understood so you can try to stay one step ahead of the malicious insider.
The key technology areas that will be addressed are:
■
Information extraction
■
Network leakage

■
Encryption
■
Steganography
■
Malicious attacks
■
Beyond computers
■
Humans
As you read through each section and start to understand each technology, how
it works, and how it would be used, remember to think about the entire scenario in
which this could be used to cause harm by a trusted insider. Understanding the core
technologies is critical, but thinking about the big picture and how it would be used
in an attack scenario will get you the best value in understanding how the malicious
insider operates and how to defend against them.
Information Extraction
As we covered in the introduction, insider threat was occurring long before com-
puters and long before the Internet was created.As long as organizations had sensi-
tive data that they did not want anyone to obtain, insider threat existed. Even Julius
Caesar had to worry about insiders and how they could hurt his organization.
Probably the most famous example of insider threat is that of Jesus and Judas. Jesus’
trusted disciples knew sensitive and critical data that no one else knew, and though
Judas was a trusted insider, he was paid off to cause harm to Jesus.
In most cases computers do not invent new areas of crime, they just bring it to a
whole new level. Computers and the Internet and companies having LANs did not
create insider threat, it always existed.This new technological infrastructure just
made the area of insider threat a more fertile ground for attackers because now their
options and means and methods for causing harm are almost endless.
Before computers the main method of committing insider threat was information
extraction; taking a sensitive document, taking it outside of the company, and giving it
to someone else. Since technology did not create the problem of insider threat as we
apply technology to the problem, the problem does not change.The main issue with
insider threat in the current digital age is extraction of information, now using net-
works as opposed to putting a hard copy in a briefcase and walking out.
Therefore we will start looking at technologies in the area of information
extraction, and then at additional technologies.The core technologies in the insider
threat tool chest that we will examine are the following:

NOTE
For most of the examples we will be using Windows. Everything that can be
done with Windows can be done with UNIX. We are doing this for many rea-
sons: First, many attackers are not that technical and therefore most likely will
be using Windows as their primary OS. Second, most insiders are going to be
using their desktop to commit insider threat and once again, Windows is the
primary OS for desktops.
Hidden Files
Data exists in a digital form on your computer, on a server and in packets that are
ﬂying across your network.A simple but effective way to extract data out of your
organization is to hide those ﬁles on your computer so if someone does a basic
directory search they will not be able to see or ﬁnd the documents on your system.
In this section we are not talking about data hiding or steganography; that is such a
broad topic in and of itself that it deserves its own section later. We are talking about
basic ﬁle hiding on your system.
Similar Directory
The ﬁrst method of hiding ﬁles on a system is to ﬁnd a directory that contains a lot
of ﬁles with similar names and create a new ﬁle or directory with a similar sounding
name.The chances that someone knows or will check every single directory is slim.
From a directory standpoint, c:\windows is a great spot for creating new directories
that will never be spotted. Figure 2.2 is a screen shot from a portion of the c:\win-
dows directory.

341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 60

Figure 2.2 A Portion of the C:\Windows Directory
Can you tell me which directory is supposed to belong and which one is not
supposed to? If I go in and create a new directory that starts with $NTUninstall, it
will blend in and be virtually invisible.Adding to the fact that most people are very
leery of deleting directories in the Windows main folder, and that there is minimal
information on the correct folders that should be there, means most people when
examining their system will ignore it.Add that with the fact that the folders are con-
stantly changing based on the running of the system, no one is going to take the
chance of trying to delete ﬁles that could cause their system to stop operating.
Similar File
From a ﬁle hiding perspective a great area to hide ﬁles is in c:\windows\system32,
especially if you pick a ﬁle name beginning with ms (see Figure 2.3).
www.syngress.com
Behind the Crime • Chapter 2
61
341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 61

Figure 2.3 The C:\Windows\System32 Directory
In this directory you have many ﬁles beginning with ms and of a variety of ﬁle
types, once again making the attacker’s job very easy to perform.
File Extension
Another variant to hidden ﬁles that works very well is to change the ﬁle extension.
If I have an .exe and I change it to a ﬁle type of .dll or .doc, it will make it harder
for someone to ﬁnd. If attackers think I have a malicious .exe on my system, they are
going to go into my system and look for it; if they do not ﬁnd it, some people
would stop looking. Now when you want to run the program you would have to
rename the ﬁle type back to an .exe and run the program.Anyone who has worked
at a company and has had to use e-mail is probably very familiar with this tactic.
This is probably one of the most common tactics to get past e-mail ﬁlters. If your e-
mail ﬁlter blocks Word documents or .exe ﬁles from coming into the mail server
because they can contain viruses, you would just change the ﬁle extension on the
ﬁle, attach it to your e-mail, and have the person on the other side just rename it
back.To do this you would either right-click on the ﬁle and rename it or use the
rename command from a DOS prompt to change the ﬁle type.
Hidden Attribute
Getting slightly more advanced than what we have been doing, you can use the
hidden ﬁle attribute to hide the ﬁles. Files have attributes that can be set; one is the
www.syngress.com
62
Chapter 2 • Behind the Crime
341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 62

ability to hide the ﬁle. By right-clicking on a ﬁle and clicking Properties, you can see
the two main properties for a Windows ﬁle: Read-only and Hidden (see Figure 2.4).
Figure 2.4 Properties for a Windows File
With the hidden attribute selected, you will not be able to see the ﬁle.You can
also use the attrib command from a cmd prompt to change the attribute of ﬁles
(see Figure 2.5).
Figure 2.5 Changing the Attribute of Files
Behind the Crime • Chapter 2
63

341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 63

In this example we started off by showing a directory with two ﬁles in it. We
used the attrib command to add the hidden attribute (+h) to the ﬁle.Then we did
another directory listing and you can see that the ﬁle is no longer displayed.
However, if you use the attrib command with no arguments you can quickly see
that the ﬁle is still listed, with the H or hidden ﬂag. Finally if you use the attrib
command with the –h, you can remove the hidden attribute and the ﬁle will once
again appear.
It is very easy for someone to hide ﬁles on a system, and if you are not aware of
it, it is easy for you to miss them. I recommend always conﬁguring Windows
Explorer to always display all ﬁles, including hidden ﬁles.This way there are no sur-
prises and you see everything that is on the system. If you are ever performing any
analysis across a system it is recommended to always conﬁgure Windows Explorer to
show all ﬁles.
From Windows Explorer, select the Tools menu and click Folder Options,
then select the View tab.The penultimate item under hidden ﬁles and folders is set
by default to Do not show hidden ﬁles and folder. My recommendation is to always
change the setting to Show hidden ﬁles and folders as it is set in Figure 2.6.
Figure 2.6 Windows Folder Options
Even though attackers can still ﬁnd ways around this technique, it still provides a
basic level of protection.

Alternative Data Streams
The next technique we are going to look at, which is fairly advanced and very pow-
erful, is alternative data streams.This is a feature that is available with NTFS ﬁle par-
titions on Windows. Since it is recommended that you always use NTFS as the ﬁle
system, this technique will work on most systems. By right-clicking on a disk and
selecting Properties you can quickly see what the ﬁle partition is (see Figure 2.7).
Figure 2.7 Local Disk Properties
In Figure 2.7, you can look under ﬁle system and tell that it is NTFS, the default
on most systems.
With NTFS there is a feature called Alternative Data Streams that turns every
ﬁle into a ﬁle cabinet, and each ﬁle cabinet can contain many ﬁles. When I open the
draw of my ﬁle cabinet at home I have my ﬁles, one for each of my clients, one for
my bills, and so on. Here you can do the same thing.The ﬁle cabinet is the name of
the ﬁle, and then I can attach additional ﬁles to the main ﬁle and each of the addi-
tional ﬁles are hidden and cannot be seen. When a secondary ﬁle is hidden within a
main ﬁle using alternative data streams, the secondary ﬁle cannot be executed, but
whenever the main ﬁle is copied or moved, the secondary ﬁle automatically moves
along with it.Then if you want to use the secondary ﬁle, you have to unattach it
from the main ﬁle and use it.
This is a technique used by inside attackers to hide sensitive data on a system
and unless you know it is there it is almost impossible to ﬁnd. Now I can take my

Behind the Crime • Chapter 2
65
341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 65

sensitive ﬁles, hide them in an alternative data stream, and either leave it on my
system or copy the ﬁle somewhere else.Anyone looking at the ﬁle would have no
idea that there are other secondary ﬁles, ﬁled away in the main ﬁle.
There are two ways to create alternative data streams:
■
Attaching to a ﬁle. Use the cp program from the NT resource kit.The
format for issuing the command is:
cp hiddenstuff.exe boringﬁle.exe:stream1.exe
■
Attaching to a directory. Use Notepad to open a ﬁle stream connected
to a directory using the following command:
c:\ notepad <directory_name>:<stream_name>
Attaching to a File
To create an alternative data stream you have to use the cp command from the
resource kit. Figure 2.8 shows the sequence for creating an alternative data stream.
Figure 2.8 Creating an Alternative Data Stream
Typically this method is used if the ﬁle you want to hide already exists so you
can attach it to a primary ﬁle as an alternative data stream. Notice there is nothing

341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 66

unusual about the ﬁle that has changed. It still looks the same in terms of size. Even
if you check Properties from within Windows Explorer, there is nothing unusual
that stands out (see Figure 2.9).
Figure 2.9 File2 Properties
Alternative data streams are fairly nasty, since if you know the ﬁle is there you
can extract it, but if you do not know it is there is could be very difﬁcult to ﬁnd.
Attaching to a Directory
Attaching a stream to a directory works best if you are creating a new ﬁle from
scratch; however, it can also be used if the ﬁle already exists. If you start Notepad
with a ﬁlename of a directory and a ﬁlename, it will create an alternative data stream
attached to the directory. If it is a new stream, Windows will prompt you on
whether you want to create a new ﬁlename (see Figure 2.10).

Select Yes and then type or paste the contents of the information you want in
the stream. When you are done close the ﬁle and the stream will have been created.
This can be seen in Figure 2.11.
Figure 2.11 Creating an Alternative Data Stream
We open up Notepad and create a stream attached to directory test2.After we
are done you can see that there are no visible signs of the stream in either directory.
Removable Media
Although alternative data streams and hidden ﬁles are interesting concepts, we still
have to be able to walk out the front door with our information. Hidden ﬁles will
make it harder for someone to ﬁnd, but we still have to put the information on
something so we can leave the company with it.
One of the best ways to remove information from an organization in a covert
manner is with removable media.Technology is an amazing thing, especially in this
regard.The longer you can wait the more storage you can get in a smaller form
factor. Memory sticks that used to contain 128 MB of memory now, for the same
size, can contain over 4 GB of information. In many cases you can ﬁnd something
half the size that contains twice as much data storage capability.The real question is
how much do you want to spend; today you are not talking that much money.
As I write this chapter, I am sitting on a train with a USB drive the size of the key
to my car that contains 4 GB of data.While this is very powerful, because as I travel I
can back up my data on the ﬂy, it also raises interesting questions with regards to secu-
www.syngress.com
68
Chapter 2 • Behind the Crime
341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 68

rity.What if I lose the USB drive and someone else gets hold of it? During the train
ride I can back up all my critical data in a few minutes on a device that easily can be
concealed.What if someone else can get three minutes with my laptop when I am at a
meeting or presenting and I step out to take a break? One of my themes that really
drive home this point is that anything that can be used for good, can be used for evil.
Organizations and IT people love these new portable devices, but we have to step back
and think about the implications this technology poses.
Based on the ease with which someone can extract data out of the organization,
the real question is whether allowing USB drives on work computers is worth the
risk. People can back up their work, but they can also use it to cause signiﬁcant
harm to the company. Since most organizations have ﬁle servers, does it make sense
to force all users to back up and store sensitive ﬁles on the ﬁle server and not run
the risk of having USB ports accessible? You might bring up the point that for trav-
eling users they would need this capability, but laptops present their own problems
(covered in the following section).
So far with removable media we covered only small USB drives.There are many
other storage types, however, that plug into serial and parallel connections and even
use local wireless. Once again the decision has to be made on which is the lesser of
the evils, allowing the access or not allowing the access. Since there are alternative
ways for users to accomplish the same task in a more secure manner, my recommen-
dation is to lock them down.
Removable media also comes in different form factors.There are watches and
jewelry that contain USB plugs, and some of it is quite good.You could detect the
earlier versions because they were unusual—geek-wear that most normal, self-
respecting people would not wear. However, the new USB watches that contain over
8 GB of storage are no bigger than and look similar to the Tiger Woods self-
charging Tag watch.There are also rings, earrings, and necklaces with storage capa-
bility very well concealed. Now if you see any people at your organization wearing
an extra amount of bling, you might want to keep a closer eye on them.
Probably the biggest culprit of them all I saved for last, because it always creates
quite a stir when I bring it up at conferences: iPods.Yes, I am actually saying that
organizations should have policies about bringing iPods to work, and should restrict
and control the usage. I have no problem with people listening to music at work, but
I do have a problem with people bringing a 4+GB hard drive to work in which
they can copy and store anything they want conveniently disguised as a music
device. I am not against iPods (I actually own several); it is an awesome invention,
but you just have to realize the risk it presents.
Put aside all your personal preferences and biases on the matter, and ask yourself
if your organization should take the risk of allowing people to bring in personal
www.syngress.com
Behind the Crime • Chapter 2
69
341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 69

devices that can store large amounts of data, remembering that it is their personal
device and you have no control over it. In essence if you allow them to come into
work with it and you have no policy stating they cannot, then since it is their per-
sonal property you have to allow them to leave with it.
Laptops
Laptops are probably one of the greatest, most powerful weapons for insider threat
available to the attacker today.At this point I know some people must think I have
lost my mind. First I insult iPods and now I am going after laptops.You are probably
thinking that in the next section I am going to say Blackberrys are evil too (well,
just wait until you read the next section).The point is control of IP is what compa-
nies should be focusing their energy and attention on, and any device that can pro-
vide a convenient avenue for circumventing those controls should be examined very
carefully. I agree that laptops play a critical role in the IT arsenal of any organization,
but we have to be aware of the threats that they pose and put measures in place to
carefully control them.
Just to prove my point on how dangerous a laptop can be if it is not carefully
controlled, I want you to do this simple exercise. Randomly walk around and
borrow someone’s laptop at your organization. Before you look at it ask yourself
how much the laptop is worth.You are probably thinking $1K to $2K, focusing on
the price it would cost to replace the physical equipment.Then I want you to do a
quick analysis of the laptop looking at what ﬁles, data, e-mail, and such is on the
laptop, and what damage it would cause if that information was exposed to the
media or a competitor. Do not spend a lot of time analyzing it; 45 minutes max will
be able to give you a good idea of what is on the system. Now ask yourself how
much the laptop is worth (really thinking how much monetary loss and damage the
company would suffer if this laptop was put into the wrong hands).
Many executives or managers before they travel dump all the critical data from the
ﬁle server onto their laptop so they have all the information they need while they are
on the road. In many cases the laptop is no longer used just for traveling, it is also their
desktop system.The term portable desktop has emerged, showing that laptops are no
longer computers that people use just when they travel; they are now systems that are
used all the time, and for smaller companies that do not have ﬁle servers, the laptop is
the ﬁle server and contains all the critical IP belonging to a company.
Laptops are a necessary evil, and we have to make sure that we understand the
inherent risks and put measures in place like encryption, and minimize wireless to
make sure the information stays protected as possible. Purging is also a good practice,
where any unnecessary information or data that is not needed is removed from the
www.syngress.com
70
Chapter 2 • Behind the Crime
341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 70

system. Now if for some reason the system is compromised, the amount of data loss
is minimal.
We have to make sure we avoid being digital pack rats. We would jokingly tease
my grandparents that everything they ever bought they still had, because they would
never throw anything out.Their garage and closets are ﬁlled with things that they
can’t even identify, and could not ﬁnd even if they wanted to. We say we do not
understand why people do that, but then I look at my ofﬁce and realize that any-
thing I ever created digitally I still have. Half the stuff I probably could not ﬁnd if I
wanted to, but I have it somewhere. Especially because laptops are so easy for
someone to take, we have to make sure we do not become digital pack rats. Store
the minimal amount of information needed and minimize your overall risk with
what you are carrying around with you.
PDAs/Blackberrys
I deﬁnitely could not live without my Blackberry, and I am not sure if it is a quality-
of-life addiction, but nonetheless, a Blackberry and PDA enhance our lives by
bringing information to our ﬁngertips anywhere we might be.You can be in a
meeting and not be able to take a cell phone call but can quickly look down at a
PDA or Blackberry and pick up emergency messages or even send quick replies to
messages that might be very urgent. Why make the person wait six hours to get an
answer to a question because you are tied up in a meeting, when you can just shoot
them a quick reply back on your mobile device in less than 30 seconds?
With PDAs, however, take all the problems and issues associated with a laptop
and multiply them. Essentially, PDAs have the same information that a laptop might
contain, except with even less protection and in a much smaller form factor.At least
laptops have a password that is required to log in before you can access the data, and
even though it can be bypassed it still provides some level of protection. With most
PDAs, though, there is no security, or if there is, most people turn it off. If I lose my
Blackberry, someone can get access to e-mails, ﬁles, contacts, and credit card num-
bers, social security numbers, and other very sensitive information that many people
store (not that I would) on their PDAs.
I had a client that started having some strange problems where their servers were
being accessed and data was being copied, but there was no sign of attack, no visible
break-in, no back doors or Trojans that you normally would see with a typical
account.To make a long story short, one of the admins lost his Blackberry, purchased
a new one, and never made a big deal about it. However, within all his e-mails and
ﬁles were all the IP addresses, passwords, conﬁguration information, and so on, and
evidently someone got hold of it and started using that information to log in
www.syngress.com
Behind the Crime • Chapter 2
71
341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 71

remotely.Therefore we quickly had to go in and change all the passwords on critical
systems and control external access into the network. Even though the attacker came
from the outside, I would clearly list this as an insider threat because a trusted insider
with special access, in essence, took all the passwords and gave them to an untrusted
entity so they could come in and do whatever they wanted to do. It wasn’t on pur-
pose, but unfortunately in this game that does not matter. Whether it was done
intentionally or accidentally, the fact remains that an insider created an open door for
an outsider to gain access.
The really scary part about this case was when I questioned why they did not
have procedures and formal notiﬁcation when critical equipment with sensitive data
is lost, so immediate action can be taken.The response was that it happens all the
time, and it would be too much work to change passwords every time it happened.
If that is the case, you have a few options:
■
Limit the information that is on the PDAs.
■
Limit who actually has PDAs.
■
Put together better awareness methods to minimize the chance of equip-
ment getting lost.
■
Do not use PDAs, because if you are not willing to accept the responsi-
bility that goes along with them, then the organization should not have to
accept the risk.
The other scary thing about PDAs is that people leave them lying around.
During authorized insider threat penetration tests that I performed, people left PDAs
on their desk when they went to meetings or lunch. Since it was authorized and I
had permission, it was easy hypothetically to take the PDA, download the data to my
computer (which takes about ﬁve minutes), and then put the PDA back. In most
cases the person does not even know it is gone. In one case, when I went to return
it, the person was sitting there, so I had to think quickly. I said I found the PDA in
the break room, and the person admitted to often forgetting where he put it, and
said he must have left it behind.As I stated earlier, the information that is found on
PDAs is scary and organizations must do a much better job in protecting and con-
trolling the information.
Wireless Exﬁltration
The last technology that we are going to cover under information extraction that
requires no introduction at all is wireless. Wireless is probably one of the easiest ways
for an outsider to become an insider.There are many maps showing all the wireless

access points in a given city; Figure 2.12 shows a map of commercial wireless
antennas in the United States (from  http://www.cybergeography.org/atlas/wire-
less.html).
Figure 2.12 Commercial Wireless Antennas in the United States
If you do not think wireless is a problem you might want to look closely at the
map in Figure 2.12 and at other war driving maps that have been produced for
almost every city (available on the Internet). War driving is the technique of driving
around an area with a wireless antenna and GPS locator and a preloaded map, and
plotting out the location for all wireless access points, both protected and unpro-
tected. If you think you can put up wireless and not be found you are wrong. Not
only will other people be able to ﬁnd you relatively quickly, but with tools like
Network Stumbler anyone can quickly ﬁnd wireless access points in a given area (see
Figure 2.13).

Figure 2.13 Using Network Stumbler
As I was writing this section I just opened up Network Stumbler to see what I
would ﬁnd and a whole list of APs popped up including at least a dozen that are not
protected. Even the ones that are protected are not necessarily protected with strong
security. Encryption on just means some from of encryption is being used, but many
of them have weaknesses and ways to be broken if they are not conﬁgured correctly.
There are three general categories of wireless that we are concerned with:
■
Authorized wireless
■
Rogue wireless
■
Ad-hoc wireless
Authorized Wireless
Even authorized wireless connections can create problems for an organization.They
can be misconﬁgured and cause harm just like authorized users can make mistakes
and cause harm.The ﬁrst problem with authorized wireless is not properly
restricting who can gain access to the device.There is still a large percent of autho-
rized wireless access points that anyone could connect to.
I still remember talking with a friend, who is a ﬁnancial advisor, about wireless. He
said that his very large company does not allow wireless use, so some people are setting
up rogue access points. He said that he usually just connects to Company X, which is a
large government contractor, and uses their wireless because it is not properly secured
www.syngress.com
74
Chapter 2 • Behind the Crime
341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 74

and seems to work ﬁne for him. I quickly told him never to send me an e-mail again,
because I do not want all my sensitive data to go through that other company’s net-
work. He sheepishly said that he had a feeling that was a bad idea.
The second problem with authorized wireless is that they are connected directly
to the private network. Even if proper security is put in place, wireless should be
used as a means of access and still terminate at a perimeter, preferably the ﬁrewall.
Then if the ﬁrewall determines the access is OK, then and only then should it be
allowed onto the network.A wireless access point is not a ﬁrewall and it is not an
IDS, therefore do not let it bypass your ﬁrewall and IDS.Any connection needs to
be validated by your security devices, no exceptions.
Even if proper authentication is used, your data still might be going across the
air, unencrypted. Even though you have slightly reduced the problem it is not much
better. Now someone sitting in the parking lot or building across the street cannot
directly connect to your network and access your data, but they can sniff all the
trafﬁc and if any sensitive data is being sent over the wireless network, they can still
intercept it and analyze it.There is a lot of confusion on what companies actually are
getting and what a given protocol will provide, but the best way to know for sure is
to test it. When was the last time you set up a sniffer and examined your trafﬁc to
make sure it is really encrypted? People tell me all the time, we are ﬁne because the
product provides encryption. Great, but are you using the encryption and did you set
it up correctly? The only way you will know for sure is if you test it.
One of the big reasons why authorized wireless is still causing problems is
because many companies are being forced into wireless sooner than they would
prefer and therefore are not taking the time to set it up correctly. With many organi-
zations, rogue wireless has gotten so out of hand, that many companies feel the only
way to stop people from setting up rogue points is if they provide wireless to their
employees. However, this solves the rogue problem only if it is set up correctly; oth-
erwise you are spending a lot of money to have the same problems you did before
you set up your own sanctioned company wireless network.
Rogue Wireless
Wireless is truly a plug-and-play commodity. From your favorite electronic store you
can buy a wireless access point for around $50; an insider goes into work, unplugs
the cat5 cable from his or her computer, and plugs it into the wireless access point.
Then they take a second cat5 cable, plug one end into the wireless access point, one
end into the computer, and you now have a rogue access point at your facility. Five
minutes and $50 is all it takes. Many users know the dangers of rogue wireless and
set it up anyway because the convenience is more important. Others do not under-

Behind the Crime • Chapter 2
75
341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 75

stand the dangers and think that if you buy something it must be secure, because
stores would not be selling and setting up a rogue AP unintentionally.
Either way a rogue AP presents an easy way for an attacker to gain access to a
network.The problem is, your organization needs to be prepared to detect and
defend against rogue APs. Since they have become such a problem, there are actually
commercially available wireless solutions that will access, track, identify, and disable
rogue APs.These solutions work very well—the only thing you have to be careful
about is that you do not take what you believe to be a rogue AP ofﬂine, when in
reality, it is not on your network and does not belong to you, it belongs to another
company that has ofﬁce space in your building.As with any solution, measure twice
before you cut.
Ad Hoc Wireless
By default with most conﬁgurations of Windows Operating Systems, when you turn
on your wireless card, ad-hoc wireless also is turned on by default. With wireless ad-
hoc or host-to-host wireless your computer is advertising itself as an open connec-
tion that someone can connect to.This vulnerability is shown in Figure 2.14 with
the two bottom wireless connections.
Figure 2.14 Vulnerabilities in a Wireless Network
Now if someone connects to these connections they most likely will not have
Internet access but they potentially could access any ﬁles or programs that are on
that computer. Based on our earlier discussion of laptops, you can now see how bad
www.syngress.com
76
Chapter 2 • Behind the Crime
341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 76

the problem can get. Now you have an executive who has all the critical IP of the
company on his laptop. He leaves his laptop and wireless on and goes to dinner, and
as he is sipping a martini, someone is accessing and copying all the sensitive IP off
his system. When he comes back from dinner, he has no idea what just happened
and how bad it really is.
Regardless of which method of wireless is used, this provides an easy gateway for
someone to get access to critical resources, and unfortunately in most cases,
bypassing the perimeter.The typical rule of strong perimeter design is all connec-
tions must go through the ﬁrewall. However, for some reason, with wireless, many
organizations decide to put it behind the ﬁrewall so if it is not conﬁgured correctly
(which in most cases it is not), it allows an untrusted outsider to become an insider,
putting your entire network at risk.
Wireless is so easy to perform today that people tend to forget what a huge risk
it could present.Therefore it is critical that measures be put in place to control and
secure wireless, otherwise the base of trusted users on your network could be a lot
larger. In one case a security administrator said I was given an unfair advantage based
on how the wireless was conﬁgured. I have 8,000 users, which I thought was what I
was up against in combating the insider threat problem, but to do misconﬁgured
wireless, the number of trusted users I had to deal with was more than 20 million.
Although wireless has value, make sure the reward is worth the risk you are taking.
Network Leakage
Acquiring access to information does not accomplish anything if you cannot extract
it from the organization. In prior sections we talked about walking out the front door
with the IP either in paper form or digital form. However, that can still be cumber-
some and risky. Ideally from an insider’s desk they would like to be able to extract
data from the organization via the network.The network provides an avenue and
connection to the rest of the world. From your desktop computer you have full access
to the entire world via the network connection that is connected to the Internet: full
access to the Internet, anytime that you need it.Therefore it should come as no sur-
prise that network leakage is a major problem for organizations. If people have the
access not only are they going to use it, they are also going to abuse it.
We have talked a great deal about controlling access and limiting access, and one
of the key principles that we have talked about is principle of least privilege—giving
someone the least amount of access they need to do their jobs.Although we under-
stand and adhere to this principle in some parts of our company, why is it that the
one area that has the most power and the most potential for abuse is the one area in
which we ignore the principle of least privilege: the network, or more speciﬁcally,
network access?

341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 77

Being able to access any systems or resources on the Internet from within a
trusted private network is clearly a problem.The potential for people to take sensi-
tive documents and tunnel them through the opening in the network to any
resource on the Internet is an insider threat’s dream come true. Changing this will
require a major paradigm shift. My ﬁrst question in most organizations is to ask why
people need access to the Internet to do their job. Give me a reason why every
employee needs to access the Web, e-mail, instant messaging, and so on, with little or
no protection. Some organizations are slowly understanding that the risk is too
great, and are implementing solutions like proxy servers. With a proxy server the
employees have to authenticate to a server that will then analyze and service all
requests.The employee never directly talks with resources on the Internet; the proxy
will perform the actions on his or her behalf.Although this is a good start, it is still
not as properly or ﬁnely grained controlled as it needs to be.
Most perimeters at organizations are set up to block or limit inbound connec-
tions, and perform little ﬁltering outbound. Even organizations that are starting to
ﬁlter outbound trafﬁc still allow certain trafﬁc out.Two types of trafﬁc that are
always allowed out of an organization are Web and e-mail trafﬁc.Those two proto-
cols/applications are the life-blood of any organization, and are needed to ﬂow so
employees can do their jobs.Therefore in this section we are going to look at both
Web and e-mail in additional detail.
Web Access
The Web is no longer just a source of information; it has turned into a front end for
almost any application or protocol that you would want to run. Initially there were
separate protocols for performing e-mail and ﬁle transfers and sending messages back
and forth.Although they still exist, the Web has transformed itself into a multipur-
pose protocol in which almost anything can be done by utilizing the simple power
of a Web browser.
E-mail has always represented a potential risk (it is covered in the next section),
but at least there was a central server that could limit and control e-mail leaving the
company. Now with the power of the Web, users via a Web browser can send and
receive e-mail, bypassing most of the ﬁlters that are in place. Even proxies that are
starting to ﬁlter out Web-based e-mail has had difﬁculty via the use of encryption.
Now Web-based e-mail is setting up SSL connections that look similar to e-commerce
sites, which are allowed, but now all the content is encrypted. Not only is it almost
impossible to block, but now you cannot even monitor or see what is going on. Figure
2.15 shows one of the more popular Web-based e-mail programs, Hotmail.

341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 78

Figure 2.15 The Hotmail Login Screen
No messy clients, no special protocols—all through the power of the Web you
can send and receive e-mail and even attach sensitive documents out of an 
organization.
Although this is a specialized application, most corporate e-mail servers also have
Web front-ends set up so people can check e-mail anywhere, anytime.The problem
with these front-end applications is that many people use them so if they do no have
their computers with them, they can access e-mail from a Web kiosk at a hotel or
airport, to log in, check e-mail, and disconnect.The problem with many of these
Web-based applications is that information could be cached or locally stored and if
not done correctly, other people could quickly retrieve the information and log into
your mail server. Once again, what type of information usually is stored in your mail
box? Almost everything, including critical IP for your organization.
If surﬁng the Web was not bad enough, now there is a whole suite of products
called anonymizers, with the goal of making your Web surﬁng experience anonymous
to anyone watching. Now if your company is trying to watch or carefully control
Web surﬁng, via an anonymizer they now no longer know where you are going or
what you are actually doing. One of the more popular sites for doing this is
http://www.anonymizer.com (see Figure 2.16).

Figure 2.16 The Anonymizer Home Page
This site currently charges, but there are many sites that are still available for free.
More and more corporate sites are blocking or not allowing access to these sites
from within the corporation.Although this strategy is effective, so all user surﬁng can
be watched and controlled, the well-versed employee usually will ﬁnd a way around
the controls.
E-mail
E-mail is another application that has huge potential based on the power of being
able to send information, including attachments, to anyone in the world with the
click of a button. If you are looking for an easy and simple way to perform an
insider threat and extract data from the organization, e-mail is your answer.As you
will see later, even if it is being monitored, the use of encryption or steganography
can make it harder to track and block. Even in the ideal case you could just use a
Web-based client that we talked about earlier to bypass the corporate mail server.
Just to show you how simple, yet powerful e-mail can be, let’s look at e-mail
basics. In order to send e-mail out to another system, your e-mail client has to con-
nect to a mail server.The mail server then connects to the destination’s domain mail
server and transfers the message.There is a little more that goes on behind the
scenes, but the key point to remember is in order to send out e-mail you have to
connect to an e-mail server. Most organizations tighten down and properly secure
their e-mail server, but there is an obvious solution for the insider that most people
miss. Why not run an e-mail server on your local desktop? Now you are controlling
www.syngress.com
80

everything.You can conﬁgure your local e-mail server to do whatever you want and
it will make outbound connections.There are several of these programs available for
download.A quick search of Tucows gives a long listing (see Figure 2.17).
Figure 2.17 Searching for E-mail Server Programs on Tucows.com
One of the programs that I have found very useful is SL Mail (see Figure 2.18).

It is highly conﬁgurable, very powerful, and runs on a local desktop. Now if you
want to send mail out or perform any tricks with e-mail aliases or spooﬁng
addresses, you no longer have to worry about e-mail servers ﬁltering out the mes-
sage or not allowing them to run.You are running your own e-mail server and can
conﬁgure it any way that you like (see Figure 2.19).
Figure 2.19 Conﬁguring Your E-mail Server
Figure 2.19 shows some of the many options that you can use to conﬁgure or
set up the system to send e-mail from your local system.These programs have legiti-
mate uses, an attacker can always use them to bypass the controls that are in place.
Spooﬁng e-mail is also just as easy.You just have to go into your e-mail settings
and create a new account (see Figure 2.20).

Once you are within the e-mail accounts, just select Add a new account and
enter whatever information you would like (see Figure 2.21).
Figure 2.21 Adding Information to a New E-mail Account
You can create a spoofed e-mail address for a competitor or just play games with
your friends.The only trick is getting your e-mail server to send it out, but since
you control your e-mail server, that is trivial. It is important to remember that if you

Behind the Crime • Chapter 2
83
341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 83

are spooﬁng a legitimate e-mail address, when the person receives the message and
replies back it will go back to the real person’s e-mail address.Therefore if they
realize they are getting responses to e-mails they never sent out, they might ﬁgure
out there is a problem. However, if you are an insider attacking the system and
trying to trick someone into getting access, it might work. For example at many
companies you need to get an e-mail from your boss approving access to a certain
resource. In this case it is usually a one-way communication, so if I can send a
spoofed approval, it could work to get the additional access.
Cryptography
One of the main measures of protection organizations are using to protect sensitive
information from leaving the organization is by monitoring trafﬁc.They either are
looking for keywords, actual ﬁlenames, or the content of critical IP to track and pre-
vent information from leaving the company.To keep from being caught, one of the
technologies that insider attackers are using is encryption. Cryptography garbles a
message in such a way that its meaning is concealed.
With cryptography you start off with a plaintext message, which is a message in
its original form.You then use an encryption algorithm to garble a message, which
creates ciphertext.You would then use a decryption algorithm to take the ciphertext
and convert it back to a plaintext message. During the encryption and decryption
process, what protects the ciphertext and stops someone from inadvertently
decrypting it back to the plaintext message is the key.Therefore the secrecy of the
ciphertext is based on the secrecy of the key, not the secrecy of the algorithm.
Therefore to use an encryption program you have to generate a key.The key
usually is tied to a username and e-mail address (see Figure 2.22).
Figure 2.22 Using an Encryption Key

341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 84

However, no validation is performed so you can put in bogus information that
could be used later to launch a man-in-the-middle attack where you can trick
someone into using a false key. If you know the public key for a user you can
encrypt a message; but only if you know a private key can you decrypt a message.
Therefore the public key can be distributed via a trusted channel, but your private
key should never be given out. If someone can get access to your private key, then
they can decrypt and read all your messages.
Detection
The beneﬁt of encryption is that someone cannot read the content of the original
message; however, encryption is detectable.
From a nonmathematical standpoint, if you are expecting to see ASCII charac-
ters and English text in a message and you see the following, clearly you can tell
there is a problem.

Although this is not a mathematically sound way of doing the analysis, it works at
a high level. However, mathematically, there is also a way to detect encryption. One of
the qualities of strong ciphertext is that the output of encryption is random.This is
important because given the ciphertext of a message, there should be no way to deter-
mine the plaintext message. If the ciphertext is not random, that means there are pat-
terns that can be used to predict the plaintext message, which is not a good thing.
However, this quality of strong encryption can also be used as a detective message.

With a normal message, all characters do not appear with the same frequency;
some appear more than others.This should be evident if you have ever watched the
Wheel of Fortune—people will always try some letters before others. Samuel Morse,
who invented the Morse code, wanted to make it as efﬁcient as possible, so he
would give the simplest codes to the letter that appear with the highest frequency
and the longer codes to the letters that appear with less frequency. He determined
frequency by counting the number of letters in sets of printers’ type.The following
are the values he came up with:
12,000
E
2,500
F
9,000
T
2,000
W, Y
8,000
A, I, N, O, S
1,700
G, P
6,400
H
1,600
B
6,200
R

V
4,400

4,000
L
500
Q
3,400
U
400
J, X
3,000
C, M
200
Z
Therefore E, followed by T, are the letters that usually appear with the highest
frequency. Based on this analysis if you plot a histogram of the letters in a typical
document, you would get a very uneven histogram that would look like the one
shown in Figure 2.23.

341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 86

However, if you plot out the histogram for encrypted information, since cipher-
text by nature is random, you will get a very ﬂat histogram (see Figure 2.24).
Figure 2.24 A Flat Histogram Plotting Letters in Encrypted Text
By looking at character frequency of the data you are examining you could
detect whether the information is encrypted or not.
The good news is an organization can tell if information is encrypted; the bad
news is if robust encryption is used you might never be able to decrypt the informa-
tion and ﬁgure out the meaning of the message. However, in many cases, the mere
fact that someone is encrypting information is enough to suspect them and watch
them closely. If the organization does not have a sanctioned encryption program, in
essence no one should be using encryption.The fact that someone is using encryp-
tion means they are using their own noncompany-sponsored program.This immedi-
ately raises a question. Second, the insider probably is only using encryption for
certain communication, not all communication. Now the question becomes, who is
the insider talking to and what are they saying that is so sensitive that he or she feels
the need to encrypt the data during this transmission? Even though you might never
know the actual content of the original message, you should be able to perform
enough analysis to be able to warrant a more detailed investigation, and watch the
person very closely.

Steganography
Steganography is data hiding, and is meant to conceal the true meaning of a mes-
sage. With cryptography, you know someone is sending a sensitive message, you just
do not know what it is. With steganography, you have no idea that someone is even
sending a sensitive message because they are sending an overt message that com-
pletely conceals and hides the original covert message.Therefore cryptography often
is referred to as secret communication and steganography is referred to as covert
communication.
The analogy I like to use to differentiate between the two is the following. If I
inherited a lot of gold I would want to keep it safe and protected. One option
would be for me to purchase a big safe and keep it in my living room with all the
gold locked inside. If you came to my house for a drink you would see the big safe
in my living room. It would be locked so you could not open it. Even though the
information inside was protected and you had no idea what was inside, you would
know I must have something very valuable to lock it in such a big safe.That is cryp-
tography.You do not know what I have but you know I am protecting something.
Another option would be for me to cut out the sheet rock on one of the walls,
make a shelf, and stack all the gold on the shelf.Then I would put a picture on top
of it on the wall. Now if you came to my house there was nothing unusual. I have
some pictures on my walls, but it is quite normal for people to hang pictures on the
walls. In this case nothing looks strange and you have no idea that I have anything of
value.That is steganography.The sensitive gold is hidden and you have no idea it is
there.The problem with straight steganography is if you noticed that the picture was
crooked and went over to the wall to straighten it out, you would notice the wall is
cut out behind the picture, and when you lifted up the picture you would see all 
my gold.
To maximize the efﬁciency of both technologies they often are used together.
First I would install a wall safe and put the gold in the wall safe (cryptography).Then
I would put a picture on top of the wall safe to conceal the safe (steganography).
Together they provide a robust solution for inside attackers to protect their data and
hide their information so no one at the company has any idea of what is going on.
To illustrate the power of steganography, we will use a program called S-tools.
S-tools uses a simple drag-and-drop interface to perform steganography (see 
Figure 2.25).

When S-tools hides information within a ﬁle it not only uses a pass-phrase to
protect the information, it also uses encryption to keep the information secure (see
Figure 2.26).

After you type the required information, S-tools automatically will hide the
covert message within the overt message (see Figure 2.27).

Figure 2.27 Hiding a Covert Message within an Overt Message
The image on the left is the original image and the image on the right is the
one with data hidden in it. Based on the how the algorithm works there is no visual
difference between the two ﬁles.The binary composition of the two ﬁles are dif-
ferent, but visually, they are identical.
Steganography is a very popular technology for attackers because it allows them
to completely conceal the true meaning of the communication and hide it in an
overt image of any type.
There are two general ways to protect against steganography on your network:
removal and detection. In some cases an organization does not care if someone is
using steganography, they just want to make sure sensitive information does not leave
the organization.Typically the easiest way to remove steganography is to convert the
image to a different ﬁle type. For example the most common type of ﬁles on the
Internet today are .jpeg ﬁles.The reason .jpeg ﬁles are so popular is because they are
compressed ﬁles and are smaller than normal ﬁles.Therefore if you take a .jpeg ﬁle,
convert it to a .bmp ﬁle, and then convert it back to a .jpeg ﬁle, although the image
will look the same, the binary content will be different. During uncompression and
decompression, the least signiﬁcant bits are modiﬁed and this is where data is hidden
with steganography.This conversion will remove any data that has been hidden
within the ﬁle.
The second method is detection. For each steganography technique there are
different ways to detect whether data has been hidden, but with S-tools it is fairly
straightforward. S-tools works by making duplicate colors in the color table.

Chapter 2 • Behind the Crime
341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 90

Therefore by writing a simple program to check for duplicate colors, you can tell
whether data has been embedded within an image.
Normal File:
D:\DH\Data\BMP>bmpmap test.bmp
Filename: test.bmp
Actual size: 66146 
Reported: 66146
Near duplicate colors: 2
Embedded File:
D:\DH\Data\BMP\STools>bmpmap test_h.bmp
Filename: test_h.bmp
Actual size: 66614 
Reported: 66614
Near duplicate colors: 1046
You can see that in a ﬁle without data embedded within it the number of dupli-
cate colors is less than 20. In a ﬁle that has data embedded within it, the number of
duplicate colors is much higher than 20.Therefore a simple check of the duplicate
colors would allow an organization to be able to detect steganography.
Malicious Acts 
Malicious attacks typically are used by external attackers to gain access to a system.
Since someone on the outside does not have access to critical systems or ﬁles they
often need to use exploitation methods to attack a system and get access.Typically
with an insider attack, the insider has access and the challenge becomes how to hide
and extract the data from the organization. In addition, since most insiders are non-
technical, exploitation methods are used only as a path of last resort.
Although the use of malicious acts as the primary measure for insider attack
often does not happen, to gain additional access or elevated privileges malicious acts
do come into play. In a situation where I have some access but not all the access I
need to access the data, I might use a malicious attack to elevate my privileges or
gain access to a system.These attacks usually involve running exploit code against a
system. Some insiders may write their own exploits or even ﬁnd their own zero day
www.syngress.com
Behind the Crime • Chapter 2
91
341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 91

exploits, but many will use tools that already have been written.The advantage of
utilizing zero day code is because most IDS would not be able to detect it or ﬁnd it
because there is no known pattern or signature.
Malicious attacks can also take other forms including the following:
■
Deceit and deception
■
Perception management
■
Information corruption
■
Theft
■
Destruction
■
Unlocked system
Although not the main focus or technology normally used for insider threat, in
some cases an insider can reach deep into his or her arsenal and use these techniques
to gain access to the information needed or to cause harm to the organization.
The Human
The weakest link in any security problem is the human factor, and insider threat is
no different. No matter how well thought out your security plan is, no matter how
much technology you utilize, no matter how many resources you have, humans still
will be one of the key areas of focus for the insider to do harm.
Even though the insider typically has some access needed to do the job, often
additional access is needed in order to acquire the access he or she needs to fully
compromise critical IP.There are many ways that can be done, and we looked at sev-
eral already, from malicious attacks to using out-of-band systems like voice mail. One
of the easiest methods is to compromise the human element and have a human tell
you the information you need, or at least give you enough data points to be able to
make your job as the attacker easier.
This concept of essentially tricking someone into giving you information they
normally should not give you is called social engineering, and it has been around for-
ever. When my wife accuses me of lying to her, I respond jokingly that I am not
lying, I am social engineering her (which, by the way, I do not recommend if you
are married!). In short, social engineering is lying, it just sounds better than saying
you are a liar.
The formal deﬁnition of social engineering is pretending to be something that
you are not, with the goal of tricking someone into giving you information they
normally should not give you and that you should not have access to. Essentially, if
www.syngress.com
92
Chapter 2 • Behind the Crime
341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 92

the person knew your true intent, he or she would not tell you the information, but
since you are “in disguise” you are able to trick him or her. Some simple but effec-
tive examples of social engineering are:
■
Calling the help desk requesting a new account to be set up
■
Calling IT and acting like a vendor to ﬁnd out how a piece of software is
conﬁgured or where it is installed
■
Impersonating a manager to get an employee to send you a proposal
■
Impersonating a manager to get approval to access a sensitive directory
The interesting fact about social engineering is that many people overlook it
because it seems so simple. But remember, just because something is simple does not
mean that it is not extremely powerful.
Most people have a default level of trust—if you do not do anything to convince
them otherwise, they generally trust you. Some of the other reasons why social engi-
neering is effective include the following:
■
Exploits human behavior.As we stated, if you are nice and friendly most
people will trust you. Most people’s personalities assume it is better to have
a default mode of trust unless you do something to change their minds,
than to go through life paranoid and not trusting or talking to anyone.
■
Trust is good. Some level of trust is not a bad thing. When I meet
someone for the ﬁrst time it is much better to start talking and assume
some level of trust than to sit in the corner thinking everyone is evil. But
always remember the saying from the movie, Italian Job,“I trust everyone, it
is the devil inside I do not trust.”
■
If you are nice you must be honest. Despite all the effort that we
spend teaching our children not to trust strangers, most people grow up
still thinking that it is OK to talk and socialize with nice people.Although
interacting with people you do not know can be intriguing and give you a
new outlook on life, you always have to be careful that there is a distinct
difference between friendliness and trust.
■
People love to talk.This is probably one of the biggest reasons social
engineering is so effective. If you just give someone an opportunity and ask
questions that are nonthreatening, you can get someone to tell you almost
anything.
■
If you listen, you must be trustworthy. Many people are lonely, and
one of the signs of loneliness is that they have no one to talk to.Actually,
www.syngress.com
Behind the Crime • Chapter 2
93
341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 93

the real sign is that they have no one who listens to them. Many people
just want to hear themselves speak and when they talk with someone it is a
competition of who can get more words in and dominate the session.
Many people are not good listeners.Therefore if you are a good listener
people are more prone to talking. It is critical to remember there is a differ-
ence between listening and not talking. I had one person tell me that when
he talked with someone, he let the other person talk 90 percent of the
time, therefore he was a good listener.You cannot make that correlation.
Just because someone is not talking does not mean he is listening; he could
be daydreaming or thinking about other things. Listening is a process of
engaging with another person, understanding what he is saying, and being
sincere. If you talk with someone who hardly talks, it could be because he
could tell you were not interested and not really listening.
■
People love to tell secrets. By having a secret that no one else knows
people feel empowered. However, that empowerment is diminished if you
do not tell anyone about the secret.Therefore the fact that someone knows
something no one else knows, they have this eagerness to tell someone. In
addition many people love to gossip and ﬁnd out what other people are
doing.Taking this and carefully planning a conversation can be a perfect
avenue into social engineering.
The other item that makes social engineering so popular is that you need min-
imal, if any, information to perform social engineering.Although no information is
required to perform social engineering, the more information you have, the higher
the chance of success. If you are going to pretend to be a manager or from a dif-
ferent department, the more supporting data you can use or names you can throw
out to put the person you are talking to at ease, the greater the chance of the attack
being successful.Typically with an external social engineering attack, some general
recon is appropriate so you are not going into it blind. However, if you are talking
about internal social engineering, although you can perform additional recon, most
insiders just by nature of their job have enough information to make the attack
highly successful.
Social engineering can come in many ﬂavors and types. I have found that just by
being nice and helpful, usually you can get whatever information you need.
However, in cases where that does not work, the following are some additional types
of social engineering that can be used:
■
Just asking. The most general type of social engineering and the one that
often is overlooked because it is so obvious is just asking for the informa-
tion. In many cases if you are conﬁdent about how you present yourself
www.syngress.com
94
Chapter 2 • Behind the Crime
341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 94

and you ask for something with authority, many times people will give it to
you. Many buildings have guards in the front of a building but if you walk
in the building you do not need an escort. If you walk in and look around
and act like a visitor you will be stopped and have to sign in. However, if
you walk with conﬁdence as if  you belong and know where you are
going, in many cases, you will not be stopped.
■
Impersonation. Pretending to be someone else is probably the most pop-
ular method of social engineering. If I pretend to be from the help desk I
can probably get an executive assistant to open a CEO’s ofﬁce so I could
supposedly ﬁx a problem he was having. Even if the assistant says I do not
know about any problem, you can say he was complaining to my boss
about a problem, but if you prefer I just leave it and wait until he gets back
that is ﬁne. Most people do not want to be the one to be blamed for not
having a problem ﬁxed, so in most cases you would be given access.
■
Misleading and redirection. With both of these you are giving someone
false information with the purpose of misleading them, confusing them, or
causing them to make a decision they normally would not make. For
example, I heard a rumor that we had a ﬁre code violation, and sometime
this weekend they are going to come in and inspect the ofﬁce. If they
cannot get into an ofﬁce, they might ﬁne the company, so make sure you
leave your ofﬁce open this weekend. Clearly you are presenting someone
with false information so you can gain access after hours.
■
Anger. Although I would recommend using this method as a last resort, it
will work in some cases. Instead of being nice, kind, and trying to sweet-talk
someone into doing something, you get very angry and raise you voice.
Some people do not like conﬂict so if you start getting upset and angry they
would rather just give you what you want than risk making a scene.The risk
of anger social engineering is that you could annoy the other person and he
or she could get angry; then nothing would get accomplished.
To defend against social engineering, the best defense measure is to raise user
awareness on the dangers that social engineering can pose to a company. In addition,
strict policies with clear guidelines that are tightly enforced will also limit the
chances that people could be tricked into given access. Employees have to realize
that a company is taking social engineering seriously, and if it is enforced and proper
measures are taken, the amount of social engineering attacks will decrease.This is not
a problem that will be solved instantly, but with time it will get better.

Summary
This chapter covered a wide range of technologies and methods that can be used by
an insider to cause harm to a company. Just like with viruses and other attacks,
attackers often are taking a base method and modifying or creating variants of it to
make it more powerful and difﬁcult to attack.The same thing will occur with the
insider threat.This chapter covered the base technologies and some variants, but
expect to see additional variants and new methods evolve.As companies become
more and more savvy on prevention and detection techniques for the insider threat,
attackers are going to be forced to enhance their means and methods of using these
technologies, and even in some cases, developing new technologies.
This often is referred to as the leap-frog approach. Either the “good guys” (secu-
rity professionals) or the “bad guys” (attackers) can start the game, but usually it is
the attackers. Most security measures are put in place because of a need; if there is a
not a need, why spend money on something? Remember from our analysis that
threat drives the train. If there is not a threat, than whether there is a vulnerability or
not is irrelevant.Threat is tied back to possible danger and created by attackers.
Every time an attacker develops a new method or technique for exploiting a system,
he or she is creating a new threat, and in most cases, there is a high chance the com-
pany has a resulting vulnerability.The reason is simple: attackers develop methods to
break in and cause harm, which is manifested through a vulnerability. If there is not
a vulnerability then the attacker will spend all this effort on a technique that will
never amount to anything of value.Attackers are very smart and clever and usually
develop threats out of a need because they saw an opportunity they want to take
advantage of.
Based on these reasons, we assume that the attacker will start the game.The
attacker will leap-frog over the security professionals.This usually is done by the
attacker ﬁnding a way into a system or a way to compromise data from an insider
perspective, that a company has not thought about and has an inherent vulnerability
to the attack. Once this starts being exploited by the attacker, security professionals
start ﬁguring out a way to ﬁx the problem and stop the attack. Once they are able to
do this they leap over the attacker.At this point the attackers’ chance of success is
either stopped or greatly diminished, and they have to ﬁgure out a new way to
accomplish their goals, which usually entails the compromise of sensitive IP. In most
cases they will modify an existing attack, or in some cases, create a whole new attack
that once again is successful. Now they have leap-frogged over the security profes-
sional.This game usually continues, and is what guarantees that security professionals
will be employed for a long period of time.

Chapter 2 • Behind the Crime
341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 96

The problem with any new area, and insider threat is no exception, is the time it
takes for security professionals to leap over the attackers.This usually takes a long
period of time; however, the time it takes for attackers to leap-frog over the security
professionals is usually fairly quick.Therefore it is critical that we are properly pre-
pared going into this battle.The more we can understand the technology that is
behind the attack, and start thinking about both prevention and detection measures,
the better chances we will have at protecting our organizations from attack.
We covered a lot of different technologies that are used by attackers. Some of the
technologies you might have known about and we presented a different perspective;
some were very cool, and ones James Bond might use, and others seemed very basic.
You might have questioned why something this basic was in this chapter. Remember
that this chapter is not titled,“Cool and Crazy Technologies,” it was meant to give
you some insight to what is used to commit the crimes.Attackers do not care if the
method is cool or not, they care about getting the job done. If the technology will
help them accomplish the goal, they will use it. In most cases, if you have two ways
to accomplish something—one that is very complicated and high tech and one that
is simple and straightforward—and they both have the same chance of working with
the same success rate, an attacker would always pick the more straightforward one.
The simpler something is, the less chance for mistake.Also, if a simple method will
work as good as a more advanced technique, why waste the advanced technique? An
attacker only wants to use just enough energy to get the job done.Anything else
could raise there proﬁle, have a higher risk of getting caught, and give away an
advanced technique.
Therefore, you have to look at how effective any technology that we review is
going to be. Even though it might seem basic, the question you have to ask yourself
is whether it work in your organization. If it will get past your security defenses and
cause an attack to be successful, then you have to worry about it.The good news
you should say to yourself is, if it is a basic attack, it should be easier to defend
against than a more complicated attack.
In this chapter we dissected each technology by looking at each one separately;
however, in practice, many are used together.Traditionally some form of social engi-
neering usually comes into play before someone actually extracts IP out of the com-
pany. Essentially the social engineering piece is a good way to test the waters to try
and ﬁnd out as much information as possible to minimize the chance of getting
caught and maximize the chance of being successful.
Another example is that if I am going to use steganography, I am always going to
use it with encryption.This way if someone actually determines that steganography
is being used, they will not be able to read the content of the message. In addition, if
my ultimate goal is to get sensitive IP to a competitor, even if steganography is going
www.syngress.com
Behind the Crime • Chapter 2
97
341_INS_THR_02.qxd  11/18/05  6:58 PM  Page 97

to be used, I am not going to send it directly to someone at the competitor’s e-mail
address. Even though it might be pictures of my vacation, it could raise the suspicion
level and create a link that I would prefer didn’t exist.Therefore I would encrypt the
IP, then hide it with steganography and send it to an e-mail alias outside of the com-
pany.Then from my personal home connection with no link to the company, I
would download the message, extract the content, and even use relays before I send
it to the competitor. Even though my company would have a hard time of ﬁnding
out, I do not want anyone to put a link between me and the company; therefore
relays provide an extra level of protection.
As you think back about the chapter, think about how an attacker would mix
and match these different technologies to cause harm to your organization.The
more you can think like an attacker and understand how they operate, the better
you will be at defending the insider threat.
Technology is the foundation for how an attacker would compromise a com-
pany, but it is the raw materials of the attack that have to be fashioned and reﬁned to
come up with an actual attack.The reﬁnement from taking a core technology and
putting together an attack is the means and methods of how attackers operate.That
is the level we need to think about. Understanding the technology is important, but
what would be the means and methods an attacker would use to launch the attack is
the end state. Being able to prevent and defend against a given technology is critical,
but being able to protect against an entire attack is the ultimate goal. By knowing
the means and ways an attack is going to use a technology against you will help you
build the best defense possible. By understanding the full method, there might be
easier ways to be able to defend against the attack ,and ultimately the more you
know, the more in-depth defense you can apply to securing your organization.
The way this usually is done in practice is to create scenarios.Taking the infor-
mation you learned in this chapter about the technologies and by understanding the
real threats, you should build a series of scenarios of how an insider would compro-
mise your organization.Try to put as many details into the scenarios as possible.
Once you have the scenarios, ﬁgure out how you would defend against it and what
changes you need to implement so the attack will not be successful. In order to do
this it is critical that you put the scenarios in priority order, focusing heavily on like-
lihood of the attack. If the scenario has a high chance of occurring and could have a
huge loss, you would spend more time defending against it than if it had a low like-
lihood of success.
Just to give you a sample, the following is a high-level scenario that can be used
as a starting point:

■
Executive targeting. After careful analysis, one of the employees working
at your organization has identiﬁed that whenever the CEO travels, he has
all the critical corporate IP on his laptop. By accessing help desk tickets
they know that this executive has complained numerous times while on
travel that he does not have the information he needs to do his job.To ﬁx
the problem they load all the data onto his system prior to his trip.The
insider also knows that the executive has been locked out of his system
many times and therefore his password is always set to the same password.
Through social engineering they can acquire the password from the execu-
tive assistant.The insider checks corporate bulletins and knows the CEO is
giving a presentation in California next Tuesday, so he will be traveling on
Monday. By watching the pattern of the executive, the help desk loads his
system with all the data prior to him leaving and then he comes in the
morning of his trip, picks up his laptop, and goes on the trip. By talking
with the help desk they are going to conﬁgure the laptop on Friday and
leave it on his desk Friday evening so the CEO can pick up the laptop on
Monday.This represents a window of opportunity over the weekend to go
into the ofﬁce, log in to the computer, copy the data to a USB drive, and
leave.
Likelihood: Very high.
Impact: Very high.
Problems: Once you put together a scenario and determine that it has
a high likelihood of occurring and the impact could be high, you then
want to ﬁgure out what the problems are, and possible solutions.The prob-
lems are people not being properly training on social engineering: the
CEO not being made aware of security and presented with alternatives to
accomplish what he wants with the same ease but more secure. Finally, sen-
sitive corporate records and the laptops they are stored on are not properly
protected.
For purposes of this book we listed a high-level scenario to serve as a starting
point, but it should be developed in a lot more detail to make sure your company is
ready and prepared to deal with the insider no matter what method of attack is used.
Scenarios are critical because the more planning you perform the better off you
will be in the long run.Although you can never predict the future with 100 percent
accuracy, the more you can do to ﬁgure out what is going to happen and plan for it,
the better off you are. In the military they are constantly running scenarios and
training against them because they know it is not 100 percent accurate, but it will be
pretty close, and the more your organization can be prepared the better off you will

be.The more time you take to create the scenarios, the more valuable they will be in
a preparedness and training tool.The less time and thought you put into them, the
less value they will have.
Although this chapter talked about some cool technologies, the chapter was
about awareness and allowing you to use that knowledge to build defenses before
attackers strike.

Government
In the previous section, we opened your eyes to the very real concern of insider threat
and detailed the speciﬁcs that characterize this problem. We talked about why detection
is so difﬁcult and why it is often covered up to prevent bad publicity and additional dis-
closure of sensitive intellectual property. We identiﬁed the general motives of insiders
and described common methods that are used.
After you grasped exactly what there is to worry about in Chapter 1, we moved on
to the technology used and misused by many insiders. We talked about information
hiding, encryption, steganography, and malicious acts such as information theft and cor-
ruption. In addition, we stepped beyond computer networks and addressed concerns of
other technological systems, such as voicemail and biometrics, that can be manipulated
by rogue insiders. We then turned our attention to one of the most common
victims/tools of corruption… the human.
Now we will apply your understanding of both the threats and the tools to real
cases that have been tried within the legal systems of the United States and other coun-
tries.Although they are not as glamorous as Hollywood ﬁction, our cases studies are
entirely factual. We believe that this will give you a better understanding of what has
truly happened in the past.
Cases are organized by venue. In this section we discuss crimes that are committed
within the government.This starts within the conﬁnes of state and local institutions and
ends with unique threats within the United States federal government. According to
the May 2005 U.S. Secret Service and CERT Coordination Center/SEI Insider
Threat Study titled “Insider Threat Study: Computer System Sabotage in Critical
Infrastructure Sectors,” 16% of insider activity occurs within government organiza-
tions. (To read this study, go to www.secretservice.gov/ntac/its_report_050516.pdf.)
101
341_INS_THR_03.qxd  11/19/05  11:44 AM  Page 101

Although the lessons learned can be equally applied to each type of organization,
speciﬁcs on the type of access employees have, such as the manufacturing of identiﬁ-
cation cards verses national secrets, changes what type of malicious activity they con-
duct. Case studies include: misuse of ofﬁcial network access, incidents involving fraud
and tampering with property (including conﬁdential or controlled information), and
sabotage.
In section three we will turn our attention away from public safety and stability to
ﬁnancial interests of the commercial sector. For each, we describe threats, provide real-
world case examples, and analyze prevention, detection, and remediation strategies.

Introduction
In this chapter we discuss unique insider threats to state and local government institu-
tions.This includes organizations such as mass transit, utilities, and licensing agencies
(for example, Department of Motor Vehicles/Bureau of Motor Vehicles
[DMV/BMV]).Although threats of sabotage are very real, and we discuss the possibili-
ties in depth, thankfully, at the time of writing this book, most of the cases revolve
around fraud. Unlike some of the motivations that you will see in the next chapter,
most of this fraud is strictly tied to greed and the desire for additional income.
One such instance that we will discuss is when a DMV employee sold sensitive
information about individuals to a private investigator. Other examples we will cover
in this chapter are the numerous cases in which DMV/BMV employees used their

acquire them.As another example of a prevalent insider threat, we will talk about
cases in which insiders used their access to fraudulently “give” money to friends and
family.
While we detail what happens in each case, in your mind identify how they
apply to you.Although your company or organization may not have Electronic
Beneﬁt Transaction (EBT) cards like the victims in this chapter, you probably pro-
vide access to corporate charge cards that could be misused in the same manner. Just
as the DMV has databases of sensitive information about local citizens, you may have
a database of sensitive client and employee information, both of which could be dis-
closed by a malicious insider.
For each case, put yourself in the position of the employee’s supervisor or an
auditor. How could this have been prevented? Why were they able to get away with
this for so long? What can you do to ensure that the same does not happen to you
or your organization?
Threats You May Face
In our research we discovered that although rarely publicized, state and local govern-
ments are frequent victims of insiders.According to the United States Department of
Justice in 2003 alone, 94 state ofﬁcials were charged with corruption, 87 were con-
victed, and 38 more awaited trial. In addition, 259 local government ofﬁcials were
charged with corruption, 119 were convicted, and 106 awaited trial.1 When statistics
for the past decade are combined, on average 249 state and local ofﬁcials are charged
with corruption each year, 206 are prosecuted, and 92 await trial.
In a society where everything has a price, corruption does happen, and on a
consistent basis. Unfortunately, this is often caused by the proportionally larger
number of employees when compared to most companies, and the low salaries of
many entry-level workers. In general, the equation of low pay and high access to
sensitive data rarely turns out positively.These employees are frequently susceptible
to being bribed to leverage their access in a malicious manner. Steps to prevent and
mitigate this type of insider threat must be continually implemented and reassessed.
The ﬁrst stage to preventing any type of crime is to be aware of potential
threats. Recognizing vulnerabilities allows for preventative measures to be imple-
mented before they can be exploited.This type of analysis comes in two forms: 1)
identifying anticipated problems and 2) examining what whet wrong in previous
cases.That is precisely what we intend to do in the following chapters. We start by

State and Local Government Insiders • Chapter 3

identifying areas that have a high potential for exploitation, followed by speciﬁc
examples of insider activity that have happened in the past.
In this chapter we focus on where the government ties closest to its citizens: at
the state and local level.These entities are primarily responsible for ensuring the wel-
fare and safety of residents and economic health of local companies.Threats at this
level can be generalized as a loss of safety or a loss of property (see Figure 3.1).
Figure 3.1 Threats and Subsequent Effects from Insiders at the State and
Local Level
Threats that involve loss of safety are the least common, but the most dangerous.
In general, the speciﬁc event that triggers this category of threat is sabotage, or in

some cases even the “threat” of sabotage. For example, a true emergency that causes
a substantial response from emergency personnel leaves citizens vulnerable to other
threats.This is because response time will be signiﬁcantly slower due to the fact that
personnel and equipment are already in route to, or on location at the ﬁrst emer-
gency. Similarly, the “threat” of a widespread emergency can also cause the same
deployment and leave citizens vulnerable to a true crisis if it were to happen at the
same time.
Beyond the potential for loss of life, sabotage can have other immediate and
long-term effects.As it happens, the event may cause loss of property which takes
away access to a resource needed by others.This may impact jobs, irreplaceable
records, or expensive equipment. In addition, the cost of responding must be
accounted for.After the July 2005 bombings in the London mass transit system, pop-
ular mass transit systems across the United States (and other countries) dramatically
increased their number of security personnel. Even though the event did not happen
in these locations, the “threat” of the event occurring became realized and therefore
those cities were impacted with the burden of non-budgeted economic effects.
The impact of this non-budgeted cost is not insigniﬁcant and causes consider-
able ripple effects in unrelated areas. For example, consider that if positioning ﬁve
additional patrols at a single subway system may cost $200,000 ($40,000 x 5). Next
imagine what this means to a city that has 20 subway stations.This cost is now $4
million.Then apply this to a state that has two mass transit systems, $8 million, and a
country that has thirty, $120 million.This means that there will be $120 million dol-
lars less for programs that were originally earmarked to receive this funding.This
shortcoming is often compensated for by temporarily shufﬂing priorities of other
important programs. For example, this might mean that this year the DMV of each
state cannot hire the additional auditing personnel that are needed to protect against
their threats, or it may mean that local schools may not have the same number of
patrols and crossing guards.
After the event itself has taken place, costs of repair must be accounted for.
Beyond costs of new construction, there is the cost of demolition and removal.
Redirection of this money may mean that the local ﬁre department does not have
the funds to purchase the two new ﬁre trucks that are necessary to accommodate a
growing population, or it may reduce funds for “ice and snow” removal in the
winter, which in turn can mean more dangerous roads for motorists. Costs must be
accounted for, and they have unavoidable side effects to the needs of others.
The second category of threat at the state and local level is loss of property.This
loss can come in the form of information theft, or the theft of money or materials.
When information is stolen, there are costs associated. Some of these costs are in the
form of money such as when irreparable harm has been caused to an innocent cit-

izen, or it may have a human effect such as loss of trust by citizens that rely on the
organization.
In the next section we will analyze each of these threats caused by events, and
their immediate and long-term effects. We start at the home or ofﬁce, and then
expand outward.
At the Home or Ofﬁce
Call it paranoia, but threats from rogue state and local government employees can
even reach into the sanctity of your home or ofﬁce.This is because of our sense of
“community.” We gather together to share services such as ﬁrst responders when
emergencies occur, fresh water, sanitary sewage removal, electricity, natural gas, tele-
phone service, and Internet service.Although in the United States most of these ser-
vices are not provided directly by the government, many are “privatized” and for the
sake of organization in this book we will treat them as if they are. Without their
proper operation, the health of both citizens of the community and local businesses
are at risk.
First Responders
Safety and public well-being requires conﬁdence that ﬁrst responders such as ﬁre
and rescue will provide the help needed. Imagine calling 9-1-1 and not having
anyone answer. Even the most equipped ﬁre and rescue department in the nation
will be useless if they are not dispatched when they are needed. Similarly, a ﬁre
department that attempts to dispatch a crew to a ﬁre, but determines that their
engine is malfunctioning does no good. Just look at the impact one person with
malicious intent had when he used an e-mail attachment to launch a distributed
attack against a 9-1-1 service. 2 Luckily he only sent the e-mail to 20 users, only 10
of which triggered responses from emergency personnel. Just imagine the impact if
he had sent it to hundreds or thousands instead.
Although there are many safety measures in place for these organizations,
they are still vulnerable to insider attack. Employees within these ranks must be
stringently screened (even in the case of volunteer organizations). Otherwise, one
rogue insider with malicious intent can disrupt the services of others.
Access granted to technologies such as computers used to process and dis-
patch during emergencies must be strictly limited and should be frequently audited
for security.Automated integrity checks could be implemented daily, if not hourly,
to ensure that records have not been corrupted or deleted. Back-ups should be made
on a frequent basis and be easy to reinstate. Employees should be trained on how to
handle this type of threat just as they are trained to handle external emergencies.

Water 
Water is a necessity of our well-being and we take its cleanliness for granted as we
ﬁll our glasses and pitchers for drinking. Much of the coverage on this threat is
highly sensationalized and highly credible reports do illustrate the difﬁculty of tam-
pering with our water supply on a large scale. However, it should be said that like
ﬁrst responders, employees within these organizations should be screened. Even steps
such as verifying past employment records on a résumé or application, or verifying
past claims of residency, can go a long way in preventing someone with a shady his-
tory from causing damage.
Electricity 
An easier target than water, and as effective (if not more), is electricity. Electricity
goes far beyond watching television and surﬁng on the Internet. Most buildings over
three ﬂoors high need electricity to pump water.This means apartment complexes,
hospitals, and ofﬁce buildings need electricity for water alone. Even with generators,
electricity can hinder emergency personnel from responding in a comprehensive
fashion.
An insider can be a service person that purposefully disables access by cutting
power lines or an operator that stops access through computerized controlling
equipment like SCADA devices. Both can cause signiﬁcant damage.
Over the past two years, Washington, DC, has been plagued with “exploding
manhole covers.”These explosions that send the covers ﬂying through the air are
caused by problematic underground electrical wiring igniting accumulated sewage
gas.At periods these explosions occur daily and are almost comical when viewed
independently of their side effect to the community. Besides the costs of response
and repair, these tend to occur in areas of heavy population. Each instance usually
causes ten or twenty stores to lose power, and thousands of commuters are impacted
with heavy trafﬁc. Businesses without power lose revenue for the day, and in the case
of groceries and restaurants, also lose their stock of fresh and frozen items.These are
examples of a series of accidental problems, but a targeted insider could do signiﬁ-
cantly more damage.
Natural Gas
Similar to the example of the manhole covers, several aging neighborhoods in
Maryland have had houses literally explode because of gas leaks in the sewer lines.
Instead of the leak being in appliances within the home as one might expect, the gas
lines outside the house are faulty and require repair.The leaking gas is held under-

ground by soil and is guided into homes through other conduits such as the “extra”
space around water and sewer pipes. Once inside the house they accumulate and
explode. Incidents such as this have the capability of leveling buildings and injuring
or killing everyone inside. Like electrical sabotage, this example shows the extreme
danger caused by an accidental problem. If an event such as this were caused through
sabotage, the results could be catastrophic.
Telephone
With the exception of access to ﬁrst responders discussed previously, not having
access to the telephone may impact the welfare of its citizens but will have little
impact on their actual health. However, not having access to telephone service can
have a major impact on the health of a business. Reliable communication is the
lifeblood of all companies. Customers expect businesses to be available for questions,
consultation, and sale. Businesses need continual access to their employees (especially
those traveling or working remote) and partners. Without this access, economic
impact is inevitable.
Other than sabotage, an insider with access to telephone service records could
still cause damage to a company. For instance, if the competitor of a consulting com-
pany had access to their telephone records, they could easily identify who their cus-
tomers are. From this list they could contact those customers and offer them reduced
prices. Protection of databases such as these is essential to the economic health of
local companies that rely on this service.
Internet
Businesses also rely on communication across the Internet to complete day-to-day
tasks. E-mail and Web site availability can often be more important than telephone
access for some e-commerce businesses.Also, with the increased popularity of VoIP
(Voice over Internet Protocol) in both government and private communications,
network and Internet security must be taken much more seriously to prevent infor-
mation loss.
A bribed insider within an Internet service provider has the potential to inter-
cept large amounts of unencrypted network trafﬁc, as well as to spoof trafﬁc with
malicious intent. One example of a similar case happened a few years back when the
owner of an Internet service provider monitored the trafﬁc of his clients. When they
searched for or purchased books he would redirect their trafﬁc and send them adver-
tisements for his own store.You could argue that this was unfair access for any com-
peting bookstores.

Miles from the Home or Business
Moving the radius out from the home or business we come to other vulnerable
areas. Some of these include trafﬁc control, mass transit, voting safety, and licensing
organizations.
Trafﬁc Control
In our current technological state, many seemingly simple devices have become
automated with extremely complex systems.The trafﬁc control mechanisms are one
of the many devices that have become autonomous.Although most of the systems
are extremely robust and rarely experience problems or long-term downtime, many
are still vulnerable to compromise via malicious insiders.
Many of us take advantage of these seemingly mundane controls, expecting they
will always be operational. Imagine a large city environment during the peak of
rush-hour trafﬁc.Then imagine what would happen if all the trafﬁc control mecha-
nisms (trafﬁc lights, warning signals, etc.) stopped operating as one would expect
them to. What if all the trafﬁc lights turned green? Would anyone notice in time to
prevent an accident? Or would they just presume that because their light was green
that they should be able to safely venture into an intersection. Now imagine this as a
widespread phenomenon.This type of disturbance could cost lives, cause panic, and
drastically disrupt the U.S. economy.This may seem like a scare tactic, but it is not
far from the truth.A single insider with enough information has the potential to
craft such an attack.
Mass Transit
Airlines, trains, and public transportation all rely on technology to accomplish their
end goal: getting their passengers where they need to go in a safe and reliable
manner.As we have seen in suicide attacks across the world, mass transit is highly
vulnerable to attack. In some cases attackers leveraged identiﬁcation cards and papers
that were supplied by malicious insiders.
As inspection prior to boarding grows, attackers may attempt to make even more
use of insider access. Many theorize that the crash of EgyptAir 990 60 miles south of
Nantucket, Massachusetts on October 31, 1999, is an example of this. In March
2002, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) released the following state-
ment:“The National Transportation Safety Board today determined that the prob-
able cause of the crash of EgyptAir ﬂight 990 was the airplane’s departure from
normal cruise ﬂight and subsequent impact with the Atlantic Ocean as a result of the

relief ﬁrst ofﬁcer’s ﬂight control inputs.The reason for the relief ﬁrst ofﬁcer’s actions
was not determined.” 3
Voting Safety
Voting is an extremely important component of every democratic society.
Unfortunately, like any competition where power or money is at stake, there will
always be individuals who wish to tip the scale in their favor. Vote buying is nothing
new, and now that many voting systems have become electronic, there is an even
higher risk of compromise. One unique problem of this risk is that detection is
extremely difﬁcult. We will explore this topic further in the case studies.
Licensing Organizations
Any type of licensing organization is vulnerable to fraudulent license distribution
and the exposure of sensitive information. In many cities public access is freely
granted to blueprint drawings stored for homes and businesses that have acquired
licenses. In other cases, these sensitive drawings are only available to city clerks and
investigators.The drawings explicitly indicate rooms and their type of use. For a
thief, knowing the window that goes to the “ofﬁce” in a home can lead them
directly to documents they can use to steal your identity.
DMVs and BMVs also have two common threats.The ﬁrst is concern over sen-
sitive personal information being misused. With identiﬁcation information an ever
growing commodity among thieves, these databases are a prime target.The second
threat is the manufacture and sale of fraudulent licenses.This becomes obvious with
the tremendous number of case examples on the subject in the following section.
NOTE
In the next chapter we will discuss some of the large and organized threats that
the federal government faces from foreign intelligence organizations. Although
in general, state and local governments are not direct targets of intelligence
activities like the federal government is, increased sharing of databases and
information may change that.
As organizations work closely together, the lines between some may blur
and thus insiders may look to leverage their access for espionage. State and
local governments are “new” to this type of threat and therefore may be easy
targets for attackers.

Incidents
Looking at potential areas of weakness can help to protect against attacks before they
take place, but analyzing attacks that have already taken place can be just as (if not
more) important. Just as transportation safety ofﬁcials gather statistics and review case
studies of accidents that occur, we will review cases where insiders have misused
their access. Most of the cases we will discuss involve fraud or the theft of informa-
tion and/or property.
A Closer Look…
Is There Power behind Fear?
According to early 18th-century philosopher Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832), there
is power behind fear. He writes in his work, An Introduction to the Principles of
Morals and Legislation, that humans are controlled by desire for gratiﬁcation and
contemplation over negative effects of such action. 4 Fear, he deﬁnes, is “the
prospect of pain.” When describing his view of our decision process, Bentham
writes:
“… the other of danger. The pain which it produces is a pain of apprehen-
sion: a pain grounded on the apprehension of suffering such mischiefs or incon-
veniences, whatever they may be, as it is the nature of the primary mischief to
produce. It may be styled, in one word, the alarm. The danger is the chance,
whatever it may be, which the multitude it concerns may in consequence of the
primary mischief stand exposed to, of suffering such mischiefs or inconveniences.
For danger is nothing but the chance of pain, or, what comes to the same thing,
of loss of pleasure.”
The two government-produced posters in Figure 3.2 show images of former
federal employees Aldrich Ames (left) and Earl Pitts who were both convicted of
espionage. These posters were designed to deter against espionage. The poster
of Ames is available at www.wasc.noaa.gov/wrso/posters/Security_Awareness_

Corruption in the DMV
When threats related to state and local governments are considered, corruption
within the DMV or BMV immediately come to mind. It is easier than you think for
someone to acquire one or more fraudulent licenses using different names and ages.
When placed side by side you may be able to identify that two pictures of the driver
in Figure 3.3 are of the same individual. In both cases the same shirt is being worn,
but they have different haircuts which can dramatically change appearances.

Chapter 3 • State and Local Government Insiders
The interesting point about each of these “security awareness” posters is
that they make the statement that if you commit this crime, you will be caught.
When you are caught, you will look just like these traitors sitting in a prison uni-
form with concrete walls and bars. Their purpose is to place fear of being caught
in the mind of anyone contemplating this crime.

Figure 3.3 Photographs of Two Fraudulent Licenses of the Same Person 
In an electronic database, however, these licenses are far from similar. On the left
the driver is named “Sorre Reeg”, but on the right he is “David Esler.” In each case,
addresses, birthdays, and signatures are totally different. Verifying the integrity of one
or the other electronically by the data alone is difﬁcult. We must place some level of
trust and reliance on those that legitimately manufacture these licenses to validate
their integrity. Unfortunately as we discuss next, this trust is sometimes taken for
granted.
In this section we have a selected listing of cases involving corrupt insiders
within these state-run organizations.This list is far from complete, but we have
chosen a diverse collection to bring many different threats to light.

BMV Employee Allegedly Offered To Validate a Suspended License
for $100 (March 4, 2001)  In Ohio, a BMV employee, Reginald Spence,

Following this, the women who received the offer called the authorities. She
aided police to set up a meeting with Spence to catch him in the act.
According to reports, an undercover police ofﬁcer met with Spence and
provided the $100, at which time he also solicited her to have sex with him.

Analysis of Fraudulent IDs Supplied at DMV/BMV
Although each instance is unique when it comes to the details, they all stem from an
employee misusing their insider access in a fraudulent manner. One highly successful
preventative measure would be to require that each transaction be veriﬁed by
another party prior to completion.This would ensure that a “lone” insider could not
utilize their access to fraudulently grant passports, licenses, etc. However, we realize
this solution is virtually impossible to implement because of the shear number of
transactions that take place every day, and the limited resources that these organiza-
tions have to operate. Instead, we suggest that random spot checking may be a good
alternative to help deter and identify this type of fraudulent activity.Technological
solutions such as automated monitoring and biometrics may also prove to be lucra-
tive in detecting this type of threat:
■
Consider video taping employees and the applicants. Video record-
ings could be time stamped and made to correspond to transactions.
Automated analysis could be made to ﬂag new entries that are created prior
or after standard work hours and snapshots of the video could be sent to an
auditor. If the video shows that no applicant is present, then the transaction
could be investigated further. Video recording will also act as a deterrent to
the employee misusing their access.
■
Make use of biometrics technologies. In the case of the two driver’s
licenses in Figure 3.3, biometrics would have been able to successfully
identify that the photos are of the same person. It seems feasible that sys-
tems could be put in place to scour DMV databases in an automated
fashion searching for images that appear to be identical. In the case of the
9/11 hijackers for instance, many acquired multiple identiﬁcation cards
using aliases. 5 Computerized checks such as this could help to identify
these anomalies.

Case Study: Using Insider 
Access to Sell Private Information
In this case an insider uses access not to sell false documents to someone, but to
proﬁt by selling sensitive information to an investigator. We as private citizens expect
that the personal information we provide to BMV/DMV licensing agencies and
taxing organizations like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will not be disclosed
outside of those environments.As this case demonstrates, insiders can break this 
critical trust.

Details
In New York State, former DMV employee Catherine Puckett, 41, owner of Protrac,
Inc., a private investigations ﬁrm; Vincent Liptak, 57; and Liptak’s secretary, Stacie
Kalbacher, 44, were arraigned on a 20-count indictment in the theft of information
from DMV computers. Liptak and Kalbacher allegedly bribed Puckett to repeatedly
steal sensitive personal information from a DMV computer database over the course
of two years.
This stolen information was sent using the DMV e-mail system to Liptak and
Kalbacher.At the time, Puckett was an eight-year veteran of the DMV.According to
the New York Attorney General’s Criminal Prosecutions Bureau, Puckett pled guilty
on January 2, 2002, to receiving a reward for ofﬁcial misconduct and was sentenced
to pay restitution March 2002.

Only employees that need continued admission to sensitive infor-
mation should be given access. Access to databases and other elec-
tronic data containing sensitive personal information should be restricted to
the furthest extent possible.
■
Access to records in sensitive databases should be frequently
audited. Each employee should have his or her own username and pass-
word.A monitoring system should be implemented to identify who
accesses what records when.This monitoring can identify unusual after-
hours activities as well as identify when as an employee accesses records
beyond legitimate work requirements.This monitoring system should be
advertised to help deter curious employees.
■
Records should not be cut-and-paste capable and printing should
be monitored. Records that can easily be copied can easily be dis-
tributed electronically. By preventing cutting and pasting of information,
insiders are forced to type, write, or print the information.
■
Outgoing e-mail and messaging should be automatically moni-
tored for sensitive information. This case is an example of how moni-
toring of e-mail for outgoing sensitive information could have detected this
activity. Items such as Social Security numbers can be scanned in outgoing
e-mail and messaging using technologies available today. In addition, the
occurrence of large amounts of encrypted trafﬁc is identiﬁable and can
indicate someone trying to hide sensitive information that is being 
transmitted.

A Closer Look…
Is Prevention the Same as Deterrence?
While the following deﬁnitions from Merriam-Webster (www.webster.com) are
similar, and the end goal of stopping an event from taking place are the same,
the means of researching that goal are signiﬁcantly different:
Prevent (pronunciation: pri-’vent)  Function: verb
Etymology: Middle English, to anticipate, from Latin praeventus, past par-
ticiple of praevenire to come before, anticipate, forestall, from prae- + venire to
come — more at COME
transitive senses
1: archaic a : to be in readiness for (as an occasion) b : to meet or sat-
isfy in advance c : to act ahead of d : to go or arrive before
2: to deprive of power or hope of acting or succeeding
3: to keep from happening or existing 
4: to hold or keep back : HINDER, STOP—often used with from
Deter (pronunciation: di-’t&r, dE-)  Function: transitive verb
Inﬂected Form(s): de·terred; de·ter·ring
Etymology: Latin deterrEre, from de- + terrEre to frighten—more at
TERROR
1: to turn aside, discourage, or prevent from acting
2: INHIBIT
When applied to our context, prevention refers to eliminating the vulnera-
bility that can be leveraged by an insider to do damage. In contrast, when the
vulnerability cannot be eliminated, deterrence attempts to convince the insider
not to exploit the vulnerability.
Although simple, an analogy can be drawn from a child and a piece of
candy. You can prevent the child from having the candy altogether by placing it
out of reach. Alternatively, you can attempt to persuade the child that he is not
allowed to have the candy sitting in front of him and that you will punish him if
he does. Anyone with young children knows that the ﬁrst circumstance has a sig-
niﬁcantly better chance of success.
Removing the vulnerability altogether is the most desirable choice when
possible. When this is not an option, you should attempt to dissuade and deter
employees from committing the crime through overt types of monitoring. These
include video cameras, advertised database transaction monitoring, and adver-
tised e-mail content monitoring.

Case Studies: 
Theft of Electronic Beneﬁts
Theft and corruption of beneﬁts such as food stamps is nothing new. However, with
transitions from paper accounting to electronic databases, monitoring of these systems
should help to reduce occurrences. Some may argue, although, that without proper
safeguards it instead enables thieves to operate in a more efﬁcient manner. In the next
section, we discuss two cases that demonstrate how easily this can be done with com-
puters using EBT cards (see Figure 3.4 for an example of a Virginia EBT card).

On June 27, 2005, suspended FSSA employees Geraldine Harper and Mary Miracle
were both arrested and charged with theft, conspiracy to commit theft, welfare fraud,
ofﬁcial misconduct, and corrupt business inﬂuence, among other lesser charges.
Miracle was a 19-year veteran of the agency and Harper was nearing retirement,

Marion County Prosecutor Carl Brizzi said “these two women used their exper-
tise to satisfy their individual greed.You and I and all of the taxpayers of Indiana are
victims in this case, because the money taken out of our paychecks – supposedly
going to those who have nothing – went to those who wanted everything.”
While working at FSSA, both women were responsible for distributing funds
from the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program. Families in tem-
porary need were mailed an EBT card.This acted similarly to an ATM card and
could be used as cash or food stamps in stores. Each family was evaluated and an
amount, usually $500 to $1500 a month, was provided to them for up to six months.
According to Brizzi,“Harper and Miracle would create ﬁctitious accounts and
mail EBT cards to themselves or to family or friends.They would then take the
cards to ATMs and drain all of the cash and use it for themselves.They would also
sell the value of the food stamps contained in the cards on the black market, so they
were making money two ways.They would then “reﬁll” the card each month. We
estimate that they made $100,000 in TANF funds and a like amount in food stamps.
This had been going on since at least 2003.”
Analysis
Harper and Miracle were reportedly detected because they repeatedly began adding
auxiliary funds to cards that had already been maxed out. Because of this unusual
occurrence, an FSSA supervisor became suspicious and determined that the cards
were fraudulent.The supervisor determined that they had been obtained with fake
Social Security numbers and sent to incorrect addresses.
Because this is an electronic system, it seems plausible that the Social Security
number of the recipient could be tied into a larger database to determine its validity
and prevent fake numbers. In addition, a change such as this could prevent one
person from obtaining funds from multiple locations.This is also an example of how
frequent random auditing is necessary in environments in which employees have
access to ﬁnancial transactions.
A few states issue EBT cards that carry photographs on them. By doing this the
number of cards “issued” to one person could be drastically limited. It would be an
interesting case study to investigate if those states have signiﬁcantly lower levels of
EBT card fraud than the ones that do not have photographs.
In addition, just as with driver’s licenses, the databases could be searched using
biometrics to identify duplicate cards issued to one person’s photograph.

Details
On February 2, 2005, Glenda Taylor, 48, of Riviera Beach, Florida, was arrested and
charged with grand theft, public assistance fraud, and offenses against intellectual
property.According to a Florida Department of Law Enforcement press release,
Taylor is accused of issuing more than $7,300 in fraudulent food stamp beneﬁts.
After receiving information from the Florida Department of Children and Families
Beneﬁt Recovery Unit back in 2003 an investigation was launched.
Taylor, an employee for 18 years, is accused of creating fraudulent EBT cards
using the Florida Online Recipient Integrated Data Access (FLORIDA) system. In
addition, she reportedly reopened closed cases (such as her deceased mother’s) and
changed eligibility information and the mailing address of the EBT cards.This is an
ongoing investigation and authorities do not yet know who was receiving and using
the fraudulent cards.
Analysis
Like the previous case, this demonstrates the need of oversight for employees that
access and disburse large amounts of funds. It also demonstrates that database transac-
tions can be logged and analyzed to determine if fraudulent access is taking place.
Reopening closed and deceased cases should be audited to prevent events such as
this.
Lessons Learned from Both EBT Cases
In most states EBT cards have only been around since the early 1990s.They are still
making constant improvements in the way they are processed and in techniques to
prevent against fraud. Here are some suggestions we have for these (and other) bene-
ﬁts cards used in state governments and elsewhere:

■
Automated veriﬁcation of address, Social Security information, and eligi-
bility for beneﬁts could prevent most cases of fraud.
■
Transaction auditing, especially when “closed” cases are reopened or
addresses are changed, should be implemented. When transactions occur
before or after normal business hours they should be ﬂagged and audited as
well.
■
Rotating employees to different positions occasionally can also help to limit
and detect malicious activity such as this.
■
Photographs on the cards could limit the amount of fraud.
A Closer Look…
What Is “Need-to-Know”?
Need-to-know is a phrase that describes a security policy requiring not only the
correct level of clearance for information, but a genuine need to know the infor-
mation in order to conduct ofﬁcial business. It is used throughout the govern-
ment, especially in classiﬁed environments. From a United States military Web
site discussing proper handing of sensitive information, it is described as follows:
Need-to-know is one of the most fundamental security principles. The
practice of need-to-know limits the damage that can be done by a trusted insider
who goes bad. Failures in implementing the need-to-know principle have con-
tributed greatly to the damage caused by a number of recent espionage cases
Even organizations that do not guard classiﬁed information should use the
need-to-know principle. For example, if an employee is not responsible for
adding or changing entries within an EBT card database, then they should not be
instructed on how to do it by anyone else. An employee desiring to commit fraud
from a database such as this may act curious to another who has knowledge of
how to log in and create transactions. In general, this starts as small talk and
eventually ends with the employee unknowingly aiding in the crime. 
The classiﬁed world has witnessed the phenomena too many times, specif-
ically in cases involving espionage. Smoking areas used to be a particularly vul-
nerable area because they were a place where people went and talked on a
scheduled basis. For example, an insider wishing to gain access to the informa-
tion of another may observe that the employee tends to smoke just before lunch
and again in the early afternoon. The insider may purposefully time himself to be
in the same place at the same time as the employee to smoke. The two are now

standing outside together and they begin to talk. As time goes on and the two
employees develop a bond, the insider may push with probing questions that
otherwise would be alerting if asked by a stranger. Because of this, drawings such
as the one shown in Figure 3.5 are generally posted around smoking areas to
raise awareness. This reminds employees that just because someone asks a ques-
tion, they are not obligated to answer. Smoking areas are an example of locations
where the “need-to-know” principle was not practiced in the past and sensitive
classiﬁed information was divulged to an insider. More can be read about this in
the next chapter.

Case Study: Lottery Fraud
Lottery tickets would not sell if the game was thought to be ﬁxed.Unfortunately,
however, in at least one circumstance, that is exactly what happened.As the next case
study demonstrates, access to knowledge such as the location of a winning multimil-
lion-dollar ticket can bring out the worst in people.Although you will see that mis-
takes were made, particularly in lack of practice of the “need-to-know” principle, we
would like to point out that this case is an excellent example of how insider threat
can be detected.

Former Indiana lottery employee is charged with passing on the location of a win-
ning ticket in the “$2,000,000 Bonus Spectacular” game.
Source
Marion County Press Release
www.indygov.org/eGov/County/Pros/Prosecute/WhiteCollar/Corrupt/home.htm
Details
According to accusations, former Indiana lottery security guard William Foreman,
59, knew the location of a winning $2,000,000 Bonus Spectacular scratch-off game
ticket and passed it to two of his friends, Chad R.Adkins, 28, and Daniel J. Foltz, 31.
Authorities indicate that months before the winning ticket was claimed they
thought the game had been compromised because someone (identiﬁed by Store
Clerk Ragina Warner as Foltz) purchased the entire stock of $20 tickets from the
Cross Plains store.This immediate $640 purchase in May was unusual.
In September, Foltz went to claim his prize at the lottery ofﬁce. Once he
explained that the winning ticket was co-owned by another individual, lottery ofﬁcials
indicated that the co-winner had to appear in person as well.When Adkins did appear
the next day, he was immediately recognized by security chief Peter Byrne as a friend
of the lottery security guard William Foreman. Given this, their payment was initially
delayed and Foreman was asked to take a polygraph test. He refused and resigned from
his position despite the fact that he was nearly vested in the state pension.
According to authorities, the compromise occurred on May 13, 2004, when lot-
tery investigator Mathew Hollcraft was given a “ticket reconstruction list” from the
manufacturer in Georgia. With sensitive information known only to people within
the lottery system, Hollcraft was able to determine the location of all ﬁve winning
tickets. Both Peter Byrne and Foreman had access to this list. Byrne was also asked
to take a polygraph test, which he passed.
Former Indiana lottery security guard William Foreman was then arrested and
charged with disclosing conﬁdential information related to a lottery and theft.
The Indianapolis Star reports that Adkins and Foltz have ﬁled guilty pleas
agreeing to testify against William Foreman. 6 “This type of insider trading could
devastate the public’s conﬁdence in the lottery,” Marion County Prosecutor Carl
Brizzi said.“This is one occasion when the game was ﬁxed.Those responsible need
to be held accountable.” If Foreman is convicted of disclosing the secret location of
the winning lottery ticket, he could serve up to ﬁfty years in prison.

Analysis
This case is an excellent example of successful detection and remediation against
insider threat.Although Foreman never should have been able to obtain the location
of the winning lottery ticket, his actions were indeed detected. Luckily, one of the
persons that went to claim the winnings was recognized to be Foreman’s friend, and
thus raised suspicions about the plot. From this case we learned the following 
countermeasures:
■
Practice “Need-to-Know.” Foreman never should have had access to
where the winning lottery ticket was sold.
■
Audit employees that have access to sensitive information.
Foreman was asked to take a polygraph test, but he refused and resigned
from his position.
■
Audit recipients of beneﬁts. Both of the “winners” were found to have
ties to Foreman. If the recipients of the EBT cards were veriﬁed in this
manner, the two previous cases could have been detected and possibly 
prevented.
A Look at Technology…
Is a “Real ID” the Real Answer?
On January 26, 2005, the Real ID Act was introduced to the House of
Representatives. The Real ID is a method of identiﬁcation meant to prevent sus-
pected terrorists and illegal aliens from unlawfully traveling around the country.
It is essentially a form of national ID that one would have to present at airports,
train stations, and maybe elsewhere.
The ID will contain at a minimum: full legal name, date of birth, gender,
driver’s license number, digital photo, home address, signature, and a common
machine-readable technology. Also, before receiving the ID, you must be able to
present a photo ID, date-of-birth documentation, Social Security number, and
proof of residence. All of this data will then be added to a state-controlled
database. However, the databases will be shared from state-to-state, creating a
national database of United States citizens.
Although the act was well perceived by the House, many argue that it is not
a terribly effective tool. DMV employees will still issue the ID, so the threat of

compromise via an insider is still a very real problem. Also, those same DMV
employees will have access to the entire national database, making the effects of
compromise much more widespread.
As noted in this chapter, many DMV and BMV employees have accepted
payment to produce drivers’ licenses with falsiﬁed information and to reveal con-
ﬁdential information of citizens. Also, since the card is meant to be universal, and
will contain a common machine-readable technology, it will be much easier for
thieves to extract data from the ID. This threat could very likely lead to an increase
in identity theft and similar fraud.
After reviewing the cases in this chapter you may come to the conclusion
that the money being put into this mechanism may be better spent in reforming
the screening process of DMV and BMV employees and adding detection mech-
anisms to prevent insiders from utilizing their access unlawfully. At any rate, Real
ID deserves careful consideration, and more research needs to be done to deter-
mine the effectiveness to prevent illegal activity. Read the act for yourself at
http://thomas.loc.gov/ and you be the judge.
Case Study: Clerk Steals 
More Than $4.9M from Estates
You may be familiar with this next story from news reports a few years back. No
matter how many times you hear about it, it will probably still amaze you that this
brazen theft was able to continue for so long without detection. Despite his lavish
lifestyle, and even after this insider “retired” and the position was eliminated, he con-
tinued his path of crime without being caught.

In the late 1990s, Mel Spillman was a well-known member of the Ferrari racing
community.A quick search on Google for “Mel Spillman Ferrari” still details some
of his expeditions and road races all across the United States. Some of the cars in his
Ferrari collection are pictured in Figure 3.6.

How did Spillman do it? With his home computer, a forged signature, and stolen
county seals. Melvyn Spillman began his career as a Bexar County employee serving
as a Probate Clerk in 1969.After this he was a Probate Court Administrative
Assistant (Court Coordinator) and later became a Supervisor in the Probate Court
until 1982. Spillman then served as a Consultant to the Probate Court until 1988
when he transferred out to the District Court’s Ofﬁce as a Departmental Supervisor.
In 1999 he retired.
According to police, Stillman began committing this fraud at the Bexar County
courthouse in 1986 while he was a Probate Clerk. Despite his retirement, the fraud
did not end until July 2001 when he was arrested at a local bank attempting to close
out the account of a decedent. In these years it is estimated that Spillman fraudu-
lently misappropriated more than $4.9 million.
Now, you may be asking yourself,“how could he do this and not get caught?”
As part of his job, he was responsible for settling the estates of deceased individuals that
had no heirs.This included working in the medical examiner’s ofﬁce and handling
funeral arrangements for these individuals. He was supposed to liquidate the property
and turn over all the proceeds to the state. Instead, Spillman stole the money and ille-
gally turned the estates over to himself.
In cases where he sold the property, he kept the money. In other cases he used his
home computer to create forged documents.An example of one of these documents
that enabled him to take control of the properties is in Figure 3.7. He put these houses
up for rent under his name and ownership and retained the earnings. During estate liq-
uidations, he claimed many of the antiques and valuables for himself prior to offering
them to the public for sale. Some of these antiques can be seen in photos of property
seized following his arrest (see Figure 3.8).

Bexar County 290th Criminal District Court Judge Sharon MacRae sentenced
Spillman to two maximum terms of 10 years each in prison for forgery and imper-
sonation of a public servant.These sentences are being served concurrently and
Spillman will be eligible for parole in 2007.
Analysis
According to police investigations, Spillman stole nearly ﬁve million dollars from the
estates of 122 people. Even after his position was ofﬁcially eliminated in 1988,
Spillman continued to do the job. When he retired in 1999, he operated as a private
consultant for the court and continued his fraudulent scheme. It wasn’t until 2001
when a probate judge noticed Spillman’s name incorrectly listed on papers as a
“court administrator” that the situation came to light.The length of time that this
fraud continued is unbelievable.The case illustrates the importance of the following
countermeasures to prevent this from happening in your workplace:
■
Accountability of sensitive materials Sensitive materials such as seals
and badges must be closely accounted for.
■
Rotation of employees with sensitive access  Spillman was rotated,
but unfortunately his previous position was never reﬁlled.This left the door
www.syngress.com
State and Local Government Insiders • Chapter 3
133
341_INS_THR_03.qxd  11/19/05  11:45 AM  Page 133

open for him to continue his fraud. If someone else had taken on his past
responsibility, his actions would have likely stopped upon his rotation.
■
Auditing and Authentication  It seems as if the distribution of estate
funds to the appropriate recipients was never veriﬁed. Given the sensitivity
of his access and the large amount of money at stake, these transactions
should have been logged and audited. Similarly, if the fraudulent letters that
he created on his home computer had been authenticated this could have,
in theory, been detected much sooner.
Vote Tampering
Vote buying corrupts the very notion of democracy by maliciously providing one
candidate a fraudulent advantage over the other. Hundreds of cases related to this
topic have occurred in the past, and very likely hundreds of cases will occur in the
future. In the next few sections, we discuss several cases that occurred within the
Eastern District of Kentucky alone.These cases came to light following a federal
investigation of the May 1998 primary election in Knott County, Kentucky. In 2003,
these cases were tried in court.There were seven separate cases comprising a total of
10 defendants. Five pleaded guilty, two were convicted by a jury, and three others
were acquitted.
United States of America v. Calhoun
On August 19, 2003, Jimmy Calhoun pleaded guilty to two counts of vote-buying.
He paid two persons to vote by absentee ballot for candidates headed by Donnie
Newsome who was the successful candidate for County Judge Executive in the 
election.

United States of America v. Johnson
On June 2, 2003, Newton Johnson pled guilty to paying people to vote by absentee
ballot for candidates headed by Donnie Newsome in the May 1998 Knott County,
Kentucky, primary election. Johnson reached a plea agreement and participated with
the government to uncover the larger conspiracy headed by Donnie Newsome.
Johnson testiﬁed that Newsome, the winning County Judge Executive, had
offered to give him a road improvement and a county job in exchange for his
actions. Given Johnson’s circumstances of living in a remote mountain hollow in
which he could not leave without the road improvement, and his illiteracy, which
made it difﬁcult for him to acquire a job, he agreed.
United States of America 
v. Pigman, Newsome, and Smith
On July 8, 2003, Keith Pigman pled guilty with a plea agreement to conspiracy to
commit vote-buying as well as one count of vote-buying. Upon his agreement, he
cooperated with investigators and testiﬁed against both Newsome and Smith. He veri-
ﬁed the existence of a conspiracy to pay “numerous impoverished, handicapped, illit-
erate, or otherwise impaired persons” to vote for the candidates headed by Newsome.
In addition, he explained that these people were purposefully chosen because they felt
their credibility would be in question if an investigation did take place. In exchange for
his part in the conspiracy, Newsome gave Pigman a county job.
County Judge Executive Donnie Newsome and his supporter Willard Smith
were convicted on charges of conspiracy to commit vote-buying and several counts
of vote-buying.Together the three approached and paid others to convince people
to vote for the slate of Newsome candidates using absentee vote.

A Closer Look…
Is Electronic Voting Safe?
In short the answer to that question is no. If an attacker wants it bad enough and
pairs with an insider who understands the ins and outs of the software, com-
promise is a very real threat. Just as fake IDs can be purchased, fraudulent iden-
tiﬁcation information can be presented, or bypassed altogether, with the
cooperation of an insider. Although widespread corruption of this type would be
an extremely difﬁcult task, it is possible. Especially in this technological age, the
Internet is quickly becoming a convenient solution for voting both at home and
abroad. Internet voting is still in its premature stages and is not the most reliable
means of voting. Also, unlike other electronic voting mechanisms, there is no way
to conﬁrm, short of a re-vote, that the results were legitimate. Although most
electronic voting systems are capable of detecting and mitigating anomalies, cur-
rent Internet voting technology is extremely vulnerable to widespread unde-
tectable compromise. However, electronic voting safety is a big concern of the
U.S. government and they are currently looking for new ways to ensure the secu-
rity and integrity of the process.

Prosecution Statistics
Figure 3.10 contains prosecution statistics taken from the Department of Justice
Report to Congress on the Activities and Operations of the Public Integrity Section
for 2003.You can see that the number of ofﬁcials charged with corruption has
remained fairly steady since 1984.The highest number of charges occurred in 1993
(309) and the lowest number in 1984 (203). Otherwise, on average 249 local ofﬁcials
are charged every year.

To help identify if your state is one of the problematic areas, we have correlated
the statistics in the Department of Justice Report with Population data from the
census bureau. Ratios for each state are calculated, and then states are ranked by the
score of their ratio. From this chart you can see that in 2003 the top ten most cor-
rupt states by population ratio are as follows:
■
District of Columbia*
■
North Dakota

The source for number of convictions in each state Report to Congress on the
Activities and Operations of the Public Integrity Section for 2003
(www.usdoj.gov/criminal/pin/AnnReport_03.pdf). Note that this report is incom-
plete and does not provide statistics for Tennessee through Wisconsin. Despite
attempts to collect this information from the Public Integrity Section, we could not
determine these values. For these states, we used their statistics from 2002 instead.
Closing Thoughts
State and local governments are frequent victims of insiders. In some cases, these
employees use their access and knowledge to steal beneﬁts such as those from EBT
cards, and in one case those beneﬁts actually came from estates of local citizens that
had recently died.
State and local insiders within the DMV/BMV use their access to sell informa-
tion from sensitive databases about private citizens, bribe applicants for illegal activi-
ties related to their accounts, or even produce fraudulent licenses for those that
cannot legally obtain them.
In other cases, individuals used bribery to “buy” votes under the presumption
that once they were elected they would use their insider access to provide favors
such as road improvements, contracts, and government jobs.This threat will likely
become even more widespread as more counties transition to mail-only and elec-
tronic voting to reduce crowds and increase voter turnout.

As we demonstrate, even the lottery is susceptible to insider threat.
These threats can be either prevented or deterred. Prevention helps to remove
the possibility of its occurrence. For example, the lottery security guard should have
been prevented from knowing where the winning ticket was located.
For those that must have access to the sensitive information, the threats can be
deterred.As an example, DMV employees should be told that each of their transac-
tions is monitored and audited and that they will face steep ﬁnes if they are caught
making fraudulent entries.As the 18th-century philosopher Jeremy Bentham sug-
gests, the perceived notion of being caught partnered with penalties that will out-
weigh the beneﬁt of their actions is one way to prevent malicious activities.
Although the cases that we analyze in this chapter are examples of incidents
within state and local government, the threats are not unique to these organizations.
The federal government and even companies have similar situations that can (and
probably do) result in insider attacks.

Summary
Corruption within state and local government does happen and on a consistent
basis; on average 249 state and local ofﬁcials are charged with corruption each year,
206 are prosecuted, and 92 await trial. Potential threats are categorized as a loss of
safety and/or loss of property. Sometimes the threat of sabotage can be almost as
damaging as the act itself. Examples include the additional unbudgeted costs that
resulted from increased security worldwide after the July 2005 London mass transit
bombing.
At the home or ofﬁce possible threats include ﬁrst responders, water, electricity,
natural gas, telephone, and Internet service.Away from the home or ofﬁce threats
include trafﬁc control systems, mass transit, voting safety, and licensing organizations.
The difference between prevention and deterrence is that the ﬁrst removes the vul-
nerability whereas the latter attempts to convince the individual from not exploiting
it. Whenever possible, always prevent and use deterrence as a last resort, or as an
additional layer of security.
Philosopher Jeremy Bentham suggests that our decisions are based on contem-
plation of the likelihood that we will be caught versus the beneﬁt we will acquire
from the act.Your organization should take the following measures to detect an
inside threat:
■
Practice “need-to-know.”
■
Frequently audit access and transaction records for sensitive databases.
■
Disable “cut and paste” functionality from records and monitor printing.
■
Automatically monitor outgoing e-mail and messaging for sensitive infor-
mation.
■
If possible, automatically check and conﬁrm identiﬁcation information such
as biometric images, addresses, Social Security numbers, and eligibility for
beneﬁts for each transaction.
■
Rotate employees to different positions occasionally to limit and detect
malicious activity.
■
Audit employees that have access to sensitive information.
■
Audit recipients who are granted beneﬁts such as EBT cards, lottery pay-
outs, and corporate credit cards in the commercial environment.
■
Have an accountability program for sensitive materials such as seals, badges,
and ofﬁcial letterhead.

Department of Justice Report on the Activities and Operations of
the Pubic Integrity Section
Introduction
Insiders within the ranks of the federal government have been around since the
notion of government ﬁrst existed. Many of the “founding fathers” of the United
States had a rich background in espionage and practiced it extensively during the
Revolutionary War.
In those days, insiders were generally depicted as patriots that risked their lives to
inﬁltrate enemy camps.Today it is the face of traitors such as Aldrich Ames and
Robert Hanssen, often motivated by greed, that come to mind instead.
In this chapter, we hope to draw your attention to the fact that insiders within
the federal government do not just commit espionage.They steal taxpayers’ dollars
through time and attendance fraud, illegally charge personal items to government
charge cards, expose sensitive information about citizens and undercover investiga-
tions, sell controlled privileges such as visas, plant backdoors in computer systems,
and even use government vehicles to smuggle illegal drugs into the country.
To help you work to counter these activities, we identify many problems that
result in possible threats to the federal government and discuss case examples of past
insider activity within the federal government.

If you are an employee of the federal government, then we hope that reading
this chapter will help you to better prevent and/or detect when these events occur
in your ofﬁce. We hope that we raise your awareness of the possibility of each threat
and hope that you are able to take some of the corrective countermeasures that we
suggest and put them into practice.
For those that work in commercial environments, particularly those that are gov-
ernment contractors, then this chapter also applies to you. Fraudulent awarding of
contracts by employees that accept bribes, instead of conducting a fair selection pro-
cess, impact your chances of surviving as a company.Time and attendance fraud is
still a rampant problem, and as long as there are corporate credit cards with little
monitoring, employees will misuse them. When we talk about sensitive FBI inves-
tigative information that is stolen or national intelligence that is sold by spies, con-
sider the price tag of your own computer databases. Who would want to buy them,
and who is in a position of selling them? If you are in the engineering business, you
need to be concerned with your designs and drawings; if you are a consultant,
imagine how upset your clients would be if their sensitive information were exposed
because of someone in your company.
Threats
Like in state and local governments, threats are generally categorized by a loss of
safety and/or a loss of property. Property can be in the form of money (for example,
time and attendance fraud), physical property (such as the theft of computers), infor-
mation (such as in cases of espionage, or even public trust).
It is necessary to ﬁrst understand the importance of public trust to realize the
extent to which fraud can affect it. If citizens cannot trust that police will protect
them, where can they turn? If FBI informants believe that their name is going to be
leaked to the public, will they continue to cooperate? Will our intelligence ofﬁcers
be able to continue acquiring information overseas if the Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) is infested with rogue insiders that sell their names for money?
Beyond doubt, the answer to each of these questions is no.
Governments rely on public trust and integrity to maintain a sense of stability. In
a country where media coverage is virtually unregulated, and public speech is thank-
fully an exercised freedom, this can be difﬁcult. Organizations must constantly search
for, investigate, and audit its employees.As you can see from this statement on the
FBI Web site, the FBI identiﬁes investigation of espionage and public corruption as
one of their top priorities, second only to terrorism:
www.syngress.com
148
Chapter 4 • Federal Government
341_INS_THRT_04.qxd  11/19/05  11:49 AM  Page 148

Public corruption is one of the FBI’s top investigative priorities—
behind only terrorism, espionage, and cyber crimes. Why? Because
our democracy and national security depend on a healthy, efﬁcient,
and ethical government. 1
When you consider that in the case of sabotage, insiders are often terrorists, then
you see that the topics in this chapter are the top three focus areas of the FBI.
Loss of Safety
The primary threat of concern to the federal government is loss of safety. Security of
the government at this level is imperative to stability as a nation. In the past, con-
cerns over safety stemmed from foreign governments, but in this day and age it
comes from terrorism.
The effects of successful inﬁltration as an insider within the federal government
by foreign or domestic terrorists would be devastating.Threats of this kind are
unfortunately limited only by the maliciousness and access that an attacker has.
Just imagine the outcome if a terrorist inﬁltrated the White House or Capitol
building staff, or if one was placed as an air trafﬁc controller at a busy airport like
Chicago O’Hare.
To help keep this nation safe, never underestimate the importance of pre-
employment background checks. Even if the position that you are hiring for does
not directly lead to sensitive positions such as these, an attacker could use your orga-
nization as a stepping stone to begin a “credible” slate of references and history.
Loss of Property
The federal government has to spend a great deal of effort in the prevention, deter-
rence, detection, and ultimately the remediation, of traitors that commit espionage.
Figure 4.1 contains an image of a poster distributed by the government that lists the
names and faces of several convicted federal employees that have committed treason
against the United States (the poster is available for download at www.ncix.gov/
publications/posters_calendars/posters/poster_oneevil.php).At the bottom it has a
quote from George Washington that reads:“There is one evil I dread, and that is, their
spies. I could wish, therefore, the most attentive watch be kept….”
We will talk about two of these cases, but we also want to make the point that
theft within the federal government takes on many faces beyond espionage. It is the
secretary that fraudulently adds 10 hours of overtime to her paycheck every week; it
is the contracting ofﬁcer that accepts bribes in exchange for a ﬁxed award, impacting
the other companies attempting to conduct business in a fair and ethical manner; it

is the FBI agent that blows an investigation by leaking information, possibly placing
sources and agents in danger; it is the administrator that processes government credit
card applications who employees trust with their sensitive information such as social
security numbers, bank accounts, and mother’s maiden names; and it is the computer
programmer that creates backdoors or purposefully destroys irreplaceable databases.
At the risk of sounding paranoid, threats are everywhere within these organiza-
tions and we have not even talked about the long-term impact such as loss of
national and global trust.

Time and Attendance Fraud
One rampant problem within the federal government is time and attendance fraud.
In these situations, employees purposefully misrepresent the number of hours they
work in an effort to increase the amount of money they are paid in a given period.
There is no doubt that fraud of this nature also occurs widely within private
industry, but it is a particularly egregious act within the federal government, because
taxpayers foot the bill.
As you will read in the following case studies, this fraud is often committed by
the very people that are trusted to enter the time for others. We speculate that this is
because they are generally in a position where they are responsible for forwarding
timecards directly from a supervisor to the accounting ofﬁce.This means that they
have little or no oversight over their own timecard and what gets entered into it.
In addition, to make transactions fast and easy each week, many of these per-
sonnel had access to the user names and passwords of their supervisors.They easily
approved their own overtime using this access without any fear of being detected.
Most of the time the quantities of fraudulent time charged were small, and dis-
tributed across several months.This made detection signiﬁcantly more difﬁcult.
Government Credit Card Fraud
Far too often, greed gets the best of people when they have access to what they per-
ceive to be the “easy money” of credit cards. Cases of this type of fraud can be espe-
cially dangerous in the bureaucracy of large government agencies in which
accountability sometimes gets overlooked.The following are a small subset of the
enormously large number of credit card fraud cases we found in our research.
Case Study: IRS Employee 
Appeals Conviction of Wire Fraud
In our ﬁrst case study we write about a former Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
employee that despite an initial guilty verdict was judged to be innocent of any
crime upon appeal.This case makes the point that simply acquiring sensitive infor-
mation in a prohibited manner does not automatically make it illegal.
Topic
A former IRS employee appeals his jury conviction of wire and computer fraud.

Richard W. Czubinski
Case Number: 1:95-cr-10165-NMG
Details
Richard Czubinski was employed by the IRS as a local Contact Representative in
the Boston ofﬁce. His ofﬁcial duties included answering questions by taxpayers and
performing searches in highly sensitive IRS databases such as the Integrated Data
Retrieval System (IDRS).
With his access he could retrieve records from almost every account in the
Martinsburg, West Virginia,“master record” site.
Despite this blanket access, IRS policies strictly enforced that records were only
to be accessed on a “need-to-know” basis. Speciﬁcally, according to court docu-
ments,“Employees must make every effort to assure security and prevent unautho-
rized disclosure of protected information in the use of government-owned or leased
computers. In addition, employees may not use any Service computer system for
other than ofﬁcial purposes.” Czubinski also received speciﬁc rules that addressed
IDRS access, such as “Access only those accounts required to accomplish your ofﬁ-
cial duties.”
However, according to court records and evidence based on internal IRS audi-
tors, he ignored these rules. In fact, audit trails ascertain that Czubinski carried out
frequent unofﬁcial searches of this database in 1992.As an example, he conducted
searches related to:
■
Two individuals with ties to the David Duke Presidential campaign
■
An assistant district attorney (and his wife) that was prosecuting his father
on a felony offense
■
Boston City Counselor Jim Kelly’s Campaign Committee (note that Kelly
had previously defeated Czubinski when he ran for the Counselor seat of
District 2)
■
One of his brother’s instructors
■
A Boston Housing Authority police ofﬁcer and his spouse (he was involved
in an organization with one of Czubinski’s brothers)

■
A women he had dated; and
■
Other social acquaintances.
In 1995 he was indicted under allegations of wire fraud because the database
lines of communications crossed state boundaries.Although the government did not
accuse Czubinski of disclosing the conﬁdential information he had accessed during
these searches, it contended that he had intended to use the information in disrep-
utable ways.The indictment states that he:
… defrauded the IRS of conﬁdential property and defrauded the
IRS and the public of his honest services by using his valid pass-
word to acquire conﬁdential taxpayer information as part of a
scheme to:
■
build “dossiers” on associates in the KKK;
■
seek information regarding an assistant district attorney who
was then prosecuting Czubinski’s father on an unrelated crim-
inal charge; and
■
perform opposition research by inspecting the records of a
political opponent in the race for a Boston City Councilor seat.
In the meantime, Czubinski ﬁled a motion to dismiss the indictment arguing
that while unauthorized, the “browsing” did not deprive the IRS of any property,
and hence, was not a crime. In addition, Czubinski claimed that the section 1346
(intangible right to honest service amendment to the mail and wire fraud statutes)
was unconstitutionally vague in the context of his case.
To further complicate matters, according to one account, a newspaper had “just
uncovered his righteous role” which was what they claim sparked the entire investi-
gation. 2 Following this, Czubinski ﬁled motions to prevent references to some of his
white supremacist activities, including his membership in a KKK chapter, from trial.
This was denied; however, special instructions regarding the relevance of these afﬁlia-
tions were discussed during jury instructions.
On December 15, 1995, the jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts except
for wire fraud count 3. Following this verdict, Czubinski ﬁled an appeal.
As the ruling on the appeal states, he was never found to actually take any action
to use this information and the mere “searching” alone was not found to cause
damage:
www.syngress.com
Federal Government • Chapter 4
153
341_INS_THRT_04.qxd  11/19/05  11:49 AM  Page 153

… The fatal ﬂaw in the government’s case is that it has not shown
beyond a reasonable doubt that Czubinski intended to carry out a
scheme to deprive the IRS of its property interest in conﬁdential
information…
… The government’s only evidence demonstrating any intent to use
the conﬁdential information for nefarious ends was the trial testi-
mony of William A. Murray, an acquaintance of Czubinski who
brieﬂy participated in Czubinski’s local Invisible Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan (“KKK”) chapter and worked with him on the David Duke
campaign. Murray testiﬁed that Czubinski had once stated at a
social gathering in “early 1992” that “he intended to use some of
that information to build dossiers on people” involved in “the
white supremacist movement.” Trial Transcript, Vol. 2 at 170, 188.
There is, however, no evidence that Czubinski created dossiers, took
steps toward making dossiers (such as by printing out or recording
the information he browsed), or shared any of the information he
accessed in the years following the single comment to Murray. No
other witness testiﬁed to having any knowledge of Czubinski’s
alleged intent to create “dossiers” on KKK members.
This appeal was accepted and Czubinski was found to be innocent
Analysis
Although Czubinski was not found to be guilty of any crime in the end, this is an
interesting case.The court found that his “browsing” of unauthorized information
alone was itself not a crime. Because the defense could not demonstrate that what he
had done deprived the IRS of property, he could not be charged. It marks the impor-
tance of recording transactions such as e-mail, transfers to removable media, and
printing.We are in no way saying that Czubinski did these things, but if he had, and
the transactions were recorded then the outcome of the case may have been different.
Czubinski’s unauthorized queries were detected by auditors, but the lesson
learned in this case is that beyond evidence of collection, intent and proof of the
actual crime (i.e., depriving the IRS of its property) should be demonstrated.

Jeffrey D. Fudge
Case Number: 3:03-cr-380-R
Details
Jeffrey D. Fudge, 33, was an FBI investigative analyst who had worked for the bureau
since 1988. He was responsible for serving subpoenas, analyzing phone records,
assisting in criminal and administrative investigations, and conducting searches in
highly restricted FBI databases. Given the sensitivity of the records in these databases,
access to entries was limited to “need-to-know.” Searches were allowed only within
the bounds of ofﬁcial business. Because of the duties of his job, Jeffrey Fudge was
granted access. In particular, through the course of his normal operations, he had
access to the Automated Case Support system (ACS), the National Crime
Information Center (NCIC), the Texas Crime Information Center (TCIC), the
Texas Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (TLETS), and the FBI
Network (FBINET) databases.
According to court records, around October 7, 1997, Fudge began misusing this
position of trust and accessed FBI ﬁles and computer programs to search cases that
were not part of his ofﬁcial business.This continued through the years and ended on
or about April 25, 2003. During this time, Fudge conducted these unofﬁcial searches
to determine if the people he inquired about were being investigated.These people
were often friends and prominent Dallas,Texas, citizens.
One case, however, was a little different: Fudge was passing the information he
acquired on to his family. On May 18, 2004, Fudge pled guilty to illegally using the
www.syngress.com
Federal Government • Chapter 4

341_INS_THRT_04.qxd  11/19/05  11:49 AM  Page 155

databases to search for information about his own brother who was currently being
investigated by the FBI for HUD fraud.
In his plea, he confessed to conducting these searches on November 16, 1999,
and on several occasions between October 1997 and April 2003. In one of these
instances his brother called him (on April 14, 2003) and stated that he was being fol-
lowed by vehicles. He asked Fudge to use his access to the FBI databases to deter-
mine if the cars were registered to law enforcement.
Fudge then conducted searches using the TLETS and ACS systems and, ironi-
cally, determined that the cars were not registered to law enforcement and told his
brother that he was not under investigation. Note that the ACS, NCIC, and
FBINET communications travel across interstate communication lines.
On November 5, 2003, a federal grand jury returned a ten-count indictment
against Fudge and he was subsequently arrested and ﬁred at the FBI headquarters.
Following this, Steven P. Beauchamp, Special Agent in Charge of the Department of
Justice – Ofﬁce of the Inspector General, Dallas Field Ofﬁce, stated:
This indictment serves as a reminder that the Department will not
tolerate the misuse and unauthorized disclosure of sensitive law
enforcement information. In today’s world, and with advancing
technology, there is too much at stake. All of law enforcement
must be vigilant and protect against those who would compromise
our most important asset – our information.
During trial, Fudge entered a guilty plea agreement and was placed on probation
for two years and ordered to pay restitution.
Analysis
This case is similar to the IRS case, except that Fudge disclosed the information he
had unofﬁcially obtained to others.This is an important distinction, because Fudge
was found guilty whereas Czubinski was not. Like the previous case, this demon-
strates the need to frequently audit searches and access to sensitive databases.The
integrity and conﬁdentiality of these must be protected at all costs. Keep in mind
that the burden may be on you to prove that the insider either used, or intended to
use, the information for something beyond mere curiosity.

Narissa Smalls
Case Number: 1:03-cr-00496-GK-1
Details
Narissa Smalls was a Legal Technician for the FBI. She worked in the Freedom of
Information and Privacy Act Unit located at FBI headquarters in Washington, DC.
Her position was to search the FBI ACS computer system to collect information
needed in administrative matters and in responses to Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) requests made by the public.
However, she also used her access to make unofﬁcial searches into cases she had
no need to know. In particular, she searched for information about people who were
the subject of ongoing drug investigations. In at least one instance she printed the
information and brought it to her home. She then shared this information with
those people that were under investigation.
Smalls was sentenced to 12 months and one day in prison, followed by a two-
year supervised release.

Analysis
Similar to the last case, this example describes someone that used their access to pro-
vide restricted information to others. It is interesting to point out that neither of
these last two cases involved ﬁnancial motivation. Instead actions of the insider were
done for personal reasons or for friend/family motivations. In all cases the best
advice to prevent this activity is to conduct thorough background checks, watch for
the warning signs, and continually monitor and audit access.

James W. Brown
Details
James W. Brown was an employee of the United States Department of Energy
(DOE). He worked as a General Supply Specialist. One of his responsibilities was to
select and manage contracts related to carpet cleaning. He had the authority to make
awards for bids that were under $25,000 without any supervision.
As a representative of the federal government, it was his responsibility to ensure
that the lowest rate was always chosen. In addition, he was required to establish fair
and honest selection criteria. Unfortunately for both the taxpayers of the United
States and the vendors that participated in the bidding process, this was not the case.
www.syngress.com
158
Chapter 4 • Federal Government
341_INS_THRT_04.qxd  11/19/05  11:49 AM  Page 158

He was found to have accepted bribes between $5,000 and $10,000 on multiple
occasions; he had instead based his selection on enticements and kickbacks. In at
least one instance, Brown even provided the ﬁxed winner a copy of a competitor’s
price list.This enabled them to unfairly see their competitor’s sensitive proprietary
information and to place the lowest bid.
On January 13, 2003, Brown pled guilty to this charge, and on June 5, 2003, he
was sentenced to one year of incarceration (six months in jail and six months home
monitoring) and a ﬁne.
Analysis
Bribery is an especially difﬁcult threat to prevent and detect because it leaves such a
small audit trail. In this case, Brown was authorized to make awards without any super-
vision whatsoever—an effort to reduce bureaucracy and lower the costs to taxpayers.
In addition, he did select the bids with the lowest price, so from the outside it
appeared as if he were doing his job properly. One of the only telltale signs in this
case is that he provided the price list to the competitor. Depending on how he did
this it may not have even been detectable. In theory he could have had the list vis-
ible on his desk when the contractor came to visit, or he may have secretly taken a
copy with him to visit with the contractor.
Our best recommendation for situations such as this is to implement an
auditable computerized solicitation system. One example of such a system is utilized
by the Department of Defense (DoD) small business program, and can be found at:
www.dodsbir.net/submission/SignIn.asp.
In this system, all proposals and bids from qualiﬁed companies are solicited and
must be received electronically by a speciﬁc closing date. Prior to that date, program
managers making selections are not able to access the bids.After the date closes and all
proposals/bids have been received, then they are evaluated. In the case of the DoD
small business program they are evaluated by a committee, but in the case of smaller
purchases such as carpet cleaning, the prices could be evaluated by an individual.
Because the individual cannot access any bid until all have been received at the
solicitation’s closing, an unscrupulous employee cannot accept bribes in exchange for
disclosure of this information. In addition, even if the insider were to add favor to a
particular company, the entire transaction would be auditable.The widespread adver-
tising of this auditing could also help in deterring would-be insiders.

Case Study: Time Fraud 
in the Patent and Trademark Ofﬁce
We will now shift gears to study a series of cases that involve time fraud. In each cir-
cumstance federal government employees misused their access to fraudulently proﬁt
from unearned income. We will start ﬁrst with one example from the Patent and
Trademark Ofﬁce.

Kimberlee L. Clark
Case Number: 1:2002mj01070
Details
Kimberlee Clark was a personal assistant at the United States Patent and Trademark
Ofﬁce in Crystal City, Virginia. Part of her responsibility was to be the timekeeper
for her group. In this position, she collected timesheet information from the
employees and sent them on to the National Finance Center in New Orleans,
Louisiana, for processing. She was also responsible for processing her own timesheet
information.
In 14 different pay periods from 1999 to 2000, Clark claimed more hours than
what was conﬁrmed. In total, she fraudulently acquired approximately $5,930 in
additional salary through these false claims. She pled guilty to this theft of govern-
ment money and was sentenced to 20 days of incarceration during one year of
supervised probation, four years of unsupervised probation, and restitution for the
taxpayer money that she stole.
Analysis
We have had people ask us many times how time and attendance fraud can be pre-
vented. In most cases it is our opinion that the supervisor should be responsible for
verifying the hours and overtime worked by employees.That is part of their job to
www.syngress.com
160
Chapter 4 • Federal Government
341_INS_THRT_04.qxd  11/19/05  11:49 AM  Page 160

know who works, and when. However, in this case study and the following case exam-
ples on time and attendance fraud, there was a ﬂaw in this reviewing system.The
supervisor never had access to the claims made by the time and attendance clerks.
While they may have approved one set of hours on paper, a completely different set
was sent to the payroll department. Granted, continual checking and veriﬁcation is
what sometimes gives the government a bad name, and is why actions appear to take
so long to process, but some additional veriﬁcation can help detect and prevent this
form of fraud. In the end, it is likely that the amount of unearned wages paid out ille-
gally would be better spent on hiring additional auditing personnel.
Beyond distribution of statements for hours submitted back to supervisors, there
are some technical means for veriﬁcation that, while not foolproof, can be incorpo-
rated into an auditing system as well.There are several computerized accounting sys-
tems in which users must sign in at the start of work and sign out when they are
ﬁnished.Time accounting systems like this are required for many government con-
tractors. However, we should note that systems such as these can be offensive to
employees and display a lack of trust in their dedication. When expectations are low-
ered for performance, more often than not, people lower their performance to meet
the expectations.
More-silent accounting methods can also be implemented, such as automated
veriﬁcation based on login/logout or badge enter/exit logs.These will in no way be
foolproof, but they can be helpful in identifying a habitual offender that often claims
three hours of overtime on a Friday when the badge system placed them outside of
the building for the weekend shortly after lunch.To help illustrate how rampant a
problem this is, several similar examples of fraudulent claims follow. However, this is
just a sampling of hundreds of cases that we identiﬁed on the subject.
Case Study: Time Fraud in 
the Department of Commerce
The amount of fraudulent salary paid in this case is three times that of the previous

Brenda Dobbs
Case Number: 1:03-cr-00219-JDB-1
Details
Brenda Dobbs was a secretary and program support assistant for the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Ofﬁce of General Counsel for
Natural Resources, part of the Department of Commerce. Like Clark, Dobbs was
the time and attendance clerk for her ofﬁce.
In this position, Dobbs made false reports on her time and attendance reports.
Her fraud continued from 1996 to 2001.The result was that she obtained
$18,564.91 in additional salary.This salary was paid by taxpayers for work that she
did not perform.
In addition, using an NOAA account number, Dobbs purchased Sprint and
Verizon cellular phones services. She often used these phones for personal calls and
accumulated $3,152 in unofﬁcial charges.These charges were submitted to the gov-
ernment for payment.
After Dobbs was caught, she pleaded guilty to a charge of government property
theft. On September 4, 2003, she was sentenced to three years of probation and
restitution of the fraudulent charges she had accumulated.
Analysis
As described in the previous case, auditing, either manually by a supervisor or auto-
matically using software, can prevent this activity from continuing. Similarly, when
personal-type items such as cellular phones are provided to employees, they need to
be monitored for potential misuse.
In the case of the government, regulations for monitoring are generally easily
accepted because of the fact that taxpayers are the ones paying for the costs. It is fair,
then, to assume that proper accountability should be made to assure taxpayers that
their funds are not being misused. However, in the case of companies, the same con-
cessions should be made for stockholders or investors. One could argue that they
should be assured the same level of accountability for their investments.

Charelle Ferguson was a time and attendance keeper for the DIA. While in this
position, she misused her access to the system and fraudulent submitted 337.3 hours

Case Study: Time Fraud 
in Defense Security Services
At this point you may be amazed, like we were, at the prevalence of time fraud.
Most of these cases were detected by internal reviews speciﬁcally focusing on time
keepers. What about regular employees that slip overtime by an inattentive super-
visor? What about supervisors themselves? 
Also, we are not just picking on federal government employees. Examples of
fraudulent claims in overtime do indeed happen regularly in commercial venues.The
largest difference is that fraudulent employees identiﬁed in companies are often
silently ﬁred, but when it comes to the government they get charged in federal
court systems for all to see.
To further complicate the problem, in this next case the trusted insider was given
the user names and passwords of supervisors so that she could access the time sub-
mission and approval system. Here approval processes implemented to detect fraud
were short-circuited and bypassed all-together.

acquired.
Analysis
Like the others, Rock managed to claim more than 300 hours of fraudulent over-
time without being detected. In her case, she acquired passwords and user names that
she never should have had access to. While it is not the fault of her supervisor that
she misused her access and illegally stole funds from the United States government,
it is the job of every supervisor and employee to protect these funds from insiders.
Employees should be taught repeatedly not to give anyone their passwords and not
to ever allow others to use their accounts.

However, on September 4, 2001, she presented a letter to her supervisor that was
written on United States Attorney’s Ofﬁce stationary.The letter indicated that Sellers
was required to serve two additional grand jury recall dates in September.Those
dates came and Sellers took paid “court leave” for them. However, the letter she had
given to her supervisor was fraudulent and she did not serve as a juror those days.
She continued to present these fraudulent “jury duty” letters and between
October 21, 2001, and March 21, 2002, she had presented seven more. Based on
these letters, she fraudulently took paid “court leave” for eleven additional days.
Sellers claimed 127 hours for court leave that she never served and was paid
$2,399.03 in fraudulent wages.
A plea agreement was reached and Sellers was sentenced to 16 months probation
and $800 in restitution.
Analysis
Jury duty does not occur often, and when it does it is fairly easy to verify. Rather
than using letters provided by the employee as your proof, request proof directly
from the courthouse. Most are used to answering inquiries from curious employers
verifying the participation of the employee.
Case Study: Government Credit 
Card Fraud in the State Department
This next subject is a topic that costs everyone money in the long-run through
increased interest rates and insurance costs. We are going to talk about credit card
fraud within the government.

Two Department of State (DOS) employees and a private citizen conspire to transfer
money from government employee credit cards to Western Union ofﬁces where
they can collect it for their own use.

Details
Crystal Green was a contract employee with the DOS. Her job was to process
paperwork for DOS employees who needed to acquire credit cards for ofﬁcial busi-
ness such as travel and small ofﬁce purchases.
Besides access to the sensitive credit card numbers on this paperwork, Green had
access to private identiﬁcation information for these DOS employees. She and her co-
conspirators, Jameil Lloyd and Jacemyein Morales, used this access to commit fraud.
Crystal Green would obtain the credit card and identiﬁcation information from
the paperwork and provide it to Jameil Lloyd who was also a DOS employee. Lloyd
would then call or access the Western Union Web site and make requests for money
transfers from the cards. She would set payment to be for herself and others.
Jacemyein Morales was a private citizen associate of Green’s and was generally
responsible for picking up the money from the Western Union locations.
In one month alone, more than $4,600 was stolen from employee credit cards by
these three individuals.They had attempted to steal more than $7,600.
Green pled guilty to wire fraud and was sentenced to six months imprisonment
and six months home conﬁnement. Lloyd pled guilty to conspiracy and agreed to
cooperate in the investigation. She was sentenced to ﬁve years of probation, 100
hours of community service, and restitution of $4,654.16. Morales also agreed to
cooperate with the investigation and was sentenced to three years of probation and
$1,895 in restitution.
Analysis
Identify theft and credit card fraud is extremely difﬁcult to prevent.Anyone who has
had a legitimate charge denied because it looked suspicious can testify to how angry
and embarrassed that made them.
I can remember one instance in which I was entertaining a candidate that I
wanted to hire badly. Early that day I had used my corporate credit card to purchase
some unusual computer equipment over the Internet. Because of this, when I tried
to charge the dinner at the expensive out-of-town restaurant, my card was denied.As
a start-up, I was attempting to convey a sense of trust that my company had stability
and plenty of funds to cover the employee. Instead, having my credit card denied
made the company look like it was hardly in business. I was terribly upset and let
the banking company know that I would no longer do business with them if any of
my charges were ever denied again. Unfortunately, there is always a tradeoff between
usability and security, and credit cards are a prime example of this. In looking back,
the card company was just trying to detect and prevent fraud just as they should. It is
www.syngress.com
Federal Government • Chapter 4
167
341_INS_THRT_04.qxd  11/19/05  11:49 AM  Page 167

difﬁcult to determine what is and is not an allowed charge. For in-person charges,
one solution may be to request identiﬁcation such as a driver’s license, but this does
not help when charges are made over the telephone or across the Internet.This is an
area that requires much more research to mature technologies to detect misuse and
identity theft.
Case Study: Government Credit 
Card Fraud in the U.S. Attorney’s Ofﬁce
This next study is an example of just how much ﬁnancial damage one employee can
cause with a credit card. Beyond just fraudulent charges, this employee went as far as
selling the items that she bought with the government credit card and keeping the
proﬁt.

Case Number: 00-CR-1253-ALL
Details
Dorothy Menyweather was an employee within the United States Attorney’s Ofﬁce
for the Central District of California, located in Los Angeles. In this position, she had
been granted access to ofﬁce credit cards for ofﬁcial purchases. Instead, she used this
access for more than $100,000 in personal travel and the purchase of non-ofﬁcial
clothing, computers, and equipment. Her indictment claims:
As alleged in the indictment, Menyweather used the credit cards to
pay for travel expenses and personal bills for herself, and other
friends and relatives. She also bought computers and related equip-
ment, clothing, stereos, electronic games and gift certiﬁcates
redeemable for cash and merchandise.

As alleged in the indictment, Menyweather sold some of the com-
puters and related equipment that she purchased with the govern-
ment issued card for her beneﬁt. She used the ofﬁce’s Federal
Express account to ship the goods for delivery to her customers. 3
In the end, Menyweather admitted to stealing more than $430,000 from the
United States Attorney General’s Ofﬁce and pled guilty to one count of honest ser-
vices mail fraud. She was sentenced on September 22, 2003, to serve forty days of
incarceration (on weekends), restitution, 3000 hours of community service, and
reporting requirements.
Analysis
I ﬁnd this case incredible. Menyweather never should have been able to charge such
large amounts of money without some supervision or auditing. I do not know what
the credit limit was for the card, but I can remember that the limit on my govern-
ment card when I ﬁrst joined the CIA was high. For someone just out of college
that has never been responsible for this amount of money, initial credit limits should
be reduced.Although regulations clearly state that purchases are for ofﬁcial business
only, we recommend that lower credit limits be issued and that they are raised only
as needed.
In addition, when Menyweather sold the items she had purchased fraudulently
with her government card, she used the Federal Express account number of the
ofﬁce to ship them.Account numbers such as these are rarely audited, and they are
frequently misused.Although individual costs tied to these accounts may be small, by
tracking them, you may identify employees that are willing to cross over the line and
steal from an organization. If an employee is willing to misuse this account for per-
sonal purposes, they may be willing to misuse their access in other ways as well.
Further investigation of these charges can lead to larger discoveries of signiﬁcant
theft and corruption.
Case Study: Department of Agriculture
Employee Commits Massive Visa Fraud
As the next two case studies demonstrate, those with access to country admission
responsibility are also susceptible to fraud. Initially you may only think that
employees of embassies would be subject to this temptation, but as this next case
illustrates, it can happen in the most unlikely of places.

Hsin Hui Hsu
Case Number: 1:03-cr-00312-CKK-1
Details
Hsin Hui Hsu was an employee of the USDA. Part of his job was to identify and
invite Chinese nationals that had experience in agriculture to come to the United
States.The purpose of these trips was for Chinese nationals and USDA ofﬁcials to
meet, exchange information, and establish agreements.
However, in 1999, Hsu decided to leverage his insider position to commit fraud.
He conspired with visa brokers to assist them in illegally granting access to Chinese
nationals who otherwise could not obtain legitimate visas.The brokers were located
in both California and China and were responsible for identifying people that were
willing to pay $10,000 to enter the United States.
They would then provide names and fake biographical information to Hsu. With
this information, Hsu would then illegally use USDA letterhead to write letters of
support for these individuals.These ofﬁcial-looking letters would be taken to United
States consulates in China so that the traveler could obtain a visa.Although these
individuals had no background in agriculture, Hsu would write in the letters that
they did, and that they were specialists that were invited to attend meetings in the
United States. Hsu knew these meetings would never take place and that this was
simply a ploy to grant them admittance into the country.
In addition, Hsu also created and signed letters representing his wife, Jing Ling
Wu Hsu, and her company, Strathmore Enterprises, that “conﬁrmed” the USDA
invitations.The money that Hsu was paid by the brokers was paid into a Strathmore
bank account.
Before being caught, Hsu and Wu had been paid approximately $82,000 by the
brokers. It is estimated that hundreds of Chinese nationals were able to enter the
United States illegally because of this.

Hsin Hui Hsu was sentenced on October 22, 2003 to two years of incarceration,
supervised release for three years, and restitution of $77,400.
Analysis
Hsu misused his trusted access within the USDA. He utilized his knowledge of how
ofﬁcial request letters could be used to invite foreign nationals into the country, and
he fraudulently used ofﬁcial USDA letterhead. Employees with this level of access
should be susceptible to continual security screening.
In addition, ofﬁcial letterhead should be tightly controlled, and a ledger could be
used to log ofﬁcial requests such as the letters he issued.The problem with this case
is that Hsu was doing the same tasks as his ofﬁcial position.Therefore prevention is
difﬁcult. Instead, the countermeasures are aimed at deterring him from committing
malicious actions:The greater his perception of auditing and detection, the lower the
chances that he will accept the bribes.

cases for people requesting visas for travel to the United States.As part of this, he
interviewed candidates and processed their applications. He did this job from August
1999 to July 2002.
In January 2000, he decided to use his insider access in a malicious manner. Visa
brokers in Prague offered to pay Meerovich money if he would illegally grant access
to their clients. He agreed and between April 2000 and May 2002 he illegally
granted false visa status to at least 85 individuals. It is estimated that he made at least
$50,000 for this illegal activity.
He was caught and on June 24, 2003, was sentenced to 24 months in prison and
a ﬁne of $5,000.
Analysis
Supervisors or co-workers should periodically review cases of others when decisions
as important as visa travel are at stake. Having a single point of failure can be a
breeding ground for this type of fraud.The difﬁculty is to strike a balance between
being able to impose auditing without slowing down the approval process and
adding layers of bureaucracy.
Case Study: United States Border Patrol

Unfortunately when it comes to the money, inﬂuence, and corruption associated
with illegal drugs, the number of insider cases appears to be endless. We chose this
case example because the actions taken by the insiders were so blatant that they were
hard to believe.They used an ofﬁcial customs van to load and smuggle marijuana
into the United States on several occasion, virtually undetected.

Details
Juan Martinez was a United States Border Patrol agent. He resided in Texas and was
part of a special task force that was supervised by Customs Supervisory Special
Agent Ramon Torrez.Torrez was a corrupt insider who, with assistance from
Martinez and others, smuggled drugs from Mexico into the United States.
On several occasions Torrez asked Martinez to telephone the Border Patrol and
indicate that they were returning from Mexico with an “ofﬁcial controlled delivery
of narcotics.”This request meant that the agents normally on duty at the inspection
point would leave the area.This allowed Martinez and Torrez to pass through the
gate without any inspection by just using the key he was assigned to open the gate.
Because they knew they would not be searched, Martinez and Torrez would load
their large government vans entirely up with marijuana.This happened on at least
eight occasions. In all it is estimated that they smuggled approximately 13,000
pounds of marijuana into the United States from Mexico using their insider access.
Martinez pleaded guilty to charges and agreed to cooperate with investigations.
He was sentenced to ﬁve months in prison and ﬁve months of home conﬁnement.
Torrez was charged in a separate case.
Analysis
This is just one example of several dozen cases in which border and customs ofﬁcers
have illegally smuggled drugs themselves, or accepted bribes for allowing cars ﬁlled
with drugs to pass inspection.A longtime border agent reﬂects on this overwhelming
number of cases and says,“How do you stop corruption? You don’t, as long as there
is money and weakness in the system.You have to keep monitoring.” 4 This case and
this quote demonstrate that even the watchers need to be watched.

Montgomery Johns Gray III was a computer programmer for the United States
NLM. NLM is an organization within the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and
is the world’s largest research library of health science information. While employed
by NLM, Gray created a “backdoor” into the software he programmed.
In early 1999, NLM had identiﬁed that an intruder was illegally accessing a
computer server that was relied on by thousands of doctors.Although Gray no
longer had access to the computer system, it turned out that he was the intruder and
was accessing it through the backdoor he had created.A search warrant was executed
for Gray’s computers.Analysis led to evidence of the intrusions as well as images of
child pornography. Shortly afterward, Gray was arrested.
Gray pled guilty to receiving obscene images on the Internet and was sentenced
to ﬁve months prison, ﬁve months halfway house, three years probation, and was
ordered to pay $10,000 in restitution.
TERMINOLOGY: BACKDOOR
A backdoor, in software terms, is a program or service designed to clan-
destinely provide access to a user. Unlike standard “login” programs,
backdoors are generally designed to bypass system authorization steps.
Backdoors can either be standalone programs, or covert access capabili-
ties built into existing applications. Both are generally associated with
hacking and are often hidden and difﬁcult to detect. 
Websites such as www.packstormsecurity.org contain examples of
this type of technology, and more can be found in the book Hack
Prooﬁng Your Network by Ryan Russell.

Additional cases of misused access like this are described in the next chapter, on

All photographs from the Ames case are reprinted from the FBI Web site:
www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famcases/ames/ames.htm.
While in Virginia,Ames was part of the CIA’s Soviet/East European Division.
According to the FBI, it was in this position on April 16, 1985, that he went to the
USSR Embassy in Washington, DC, and volunteered himself as an insider spy.That
summer Ames met with a Russian diplomat in Washington several times and passed
classiﬁed information in exchange for money. He illegally disclosed sensitive infor-
mation about CIA and FBI human sources (placing their lives in danger) and pro-
vided details about technical operations that were targeting the Soviet Union.
That winter Ames met with a KGB ofﬁcer from Moscow while he was traveling
in Bogotá, Colombia, and in July 1986 he was transferred to Rome, Italy. By the
time his tour ended,Ames had received $1.88 million from the Russians in
exchange for his insider activities. Before he left, his KGB handler instructed him on
how to secretly communicate upon his return to Washington, DC.This communica-
tion was through a series of “dead drops” and clandestine letters.An example of one
such letter can be seen in Figure 4.3.

TERMINOLOGY: DEAD DROP
According to the FBI Web site, a dead drop is spy terminology for a
“place that is used to hide packages, messages, or payments.” These
locations are sometimes used to allow people to exchange items without
ever having to meet in person. 
Although the damage committed in the case studies in the previous chapter on
state and local government is serious, the actions taken by Ames reportedly caused
people to be murdered.According to the FBI, they and the CIA began to discover
that ofﬁcials they had recruited were being arrested and executed. Given this, the
FBI began to investigate and, given unusual circumstances surrounding Ames, such as
his unexplained wealth, they began to focus on him as a suspect in May 1993. By
October, an investigator had witnessed Ames make a chalk mark on a mailbox as a
signal, and in November he was observed meeting with his Russian handler in
Bogotá, Colombia.This gave authorities enough evidence to arrest him, and he was
brought into custody.
Ames pled guilty and is now serving life in prison.

Analysis
Entire books have been written on the motivation and lessons learned of this case.
We have included it to reiterate the seriousness of the damage that insiders can
create. Because Ames was working with “handlers,” he was instructed on communi-
cation tactics that would be difﬁcult for United States counter-intelligence ofﬁcials
to detect. Cases such as this teach us to remain vigilant and to keep our eyes open
for even the smallest hints that insider activity could be taking place.The combina-
tion of these anomalous events may be the only way to detect sophisticated spying
such as this.

Figure 4.4 FBI Traitor Robert Hanssen
All photographs from the Hanssen case are reprinted from the FBI website:
www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel01/hanssenphotos.htm.
It all started on January 12, 1976, when Hanssen consented to an employment
agreement to work for the FBI.According to court records, as part of this agreement
he stated:
I hereby declare that I intend to be governed by and I will comply
with the following provisions:
(1) That I am hereby advised and I understand that Federal law
such as Title 18, United States Code, Sections 793, 794, and 798;
Order of the President of the United States (Executive Order
11652); and regulations issued by the Attorney General of the
United States (28 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 16.21
through 16.26) prohibit loss, misuse, or unauthorized disclosure or
production of national security information, other classiﬁed infor-
mation and other nonclassiﬁed information in the ﬁles of the FBI;
(2) I understand that unauthorized disclosure of information in the
ﬁles of the FBI or information I may acquire as an employee of the
FBI could result in impairment of national security, place human life
in jeopardy, or result in the denial of due process to a person or
persons who are subjects of an FBI investigation, or prevent the FBI
from effectively discharging its responsibilities. I understand the
www.syngress.com
Federal Government • Chapter 4

need for this secrecy agreement; therefore, as consideration for
employment I agree that I will never divulge, publish, or reveal
either by word or conduct, or by other means disclose to any unau-
thorized recipient without ofﬁcial written authorization by the
Director of the FBI or his delegate, any information from the inves-
tigatory ﬁles of the FBI or any information relating to material con-
tained in the ﬁles, or disclose any information or produce any
material acquired as part of the performance of my ofﬁcial duties
or because of my ofﬁcial status… .
(4) That I understand unauthorized disclosure may be a violation of
Federal law and prosecuted as a criminal offense and in addition to
this agreement may be enforced by means of an injunction or
other civil remedy.7
However, while working for the FBI, he did not adhere to this agreement. He
used his sensitive access to covertly provide information to the Russians in exchange
for beneﬁts such as money. One example is the $50,000 package collected by the
FBI at the LEWIS dead drop site pictured in Figure 4.5.
Figure 4.5 Photograph of $50,000 That Was Recovered by the FBI at the

I must warn of certain risks to my security of which you may not be
aware. Your service has recently suffered some setbacks. I warn
that Mr. Boris Luzhin…  Mr. Sergey Motorin…  and Mr. Valeriy
Martynov… have been recruited by our ‘special services’. 8
Hanssen’s insider activity cost people their lives.After their names were exposed by
Hanssen, Motorin and Martynov were executed and Luzhin spent more than ﬁve years
in prison. In addition, Hanssen compromised numerous technical operations, which
resulted in “not only the value of its investments, but the priceless value of lost oppor-
tunities to gather intelligence of the most vital importance to the United States.” 7
At sentencing, a judge declared,“For his betrayal of our country, and for the
unpardonable consequences of his misconduct, Hanssen deserves to forfeit his right
ever to live again within our community and within our society.”
Analysis
We are never ones to point ﬁngers after the fact, because the truth remains that the
acts Hanssen took were the crimes, not the lack of immediate detection. However,
reviewing what happened in a meaningful way can help identify warning signs and
be used to indicate problems in the future.
In this case, it does appear as if there were signs that, if followed up on, may have
indicated a problem with Hanssen far earlier. For example, convicted spy Earl Pitts says
that he identiﬁed Hanssen as being suspicious as early as 1997 (three years before the
formal FBI investigation began). FBI spokesman John Collingwood said in a statement,
“Pitts described as ‘unusual’ a computer hacking incident involving Hanssen. Pitts did
not identify Hanssen as a spy.” 9 According to a New York Times report:
In the prison interview, Mr. Pitts recalled that a female supervisor
from the F.B.I.’s counterintelligence operations had come to his
security ofﬁce - he did not recall when - and complained that Mr.
Hanssen had broken into her classiﬁed computer. He recalled that
the supervisor had said an F.B.I. computer expert had traced the
hacking effort to Mr. Hanssen’s computer. He added that she was
“livid” at Mr. Hanssen.
An F.B.I. ofﬁcial said that when Mr. Pitts raised the matter during his
1997 debrieﬁng, the bureau concluded that he was referring to a
1992 incident in which Mr. Hanssen broke into the computer of Ray
Mislock, a senior F.B.I. counterintelligence ofﬁcial. The F.B.I. ofﬁcial
said that the incident involved the computer network in the bureau’s
www.syngress.com
Federal Government • Chapter 4

counterintelligence ofﬁce, and led several people in the ofﬁce to
believe that Mr. Hanssen had broken into their computers. 10
Reports indicate that Hanssen was clearly involved in computer activity that
should have been viewed as alerting:“…ofﬁcials willingly accepted an excuse from
Hanssen that hacking software used to steal passwords and bypass network limits
found on his computer was used to connect a new color printer.” 11 There are yet
other altercations in which Hanssen misused his access to the computer network.
Hanssen played these attacks off as demonstrations of lax security, but in reality he
should have been investigated more for his actions. We always suggest following up
on any potential security breach, no matter how small. Just as the Menyweather case
illustrated that something as small as auditing of the Federal Express shipping ledger
could have detected her massive fraud, further investigation into Hanssen’s hacking
activities could have potentially stopped his activity far sooner.

Lastly we will discuss a case of sabotage.Although we did not ﬁnd it to be nearly as
prevalent as what you will read about in the next chapter, it does happen within the
federal government. Here a disgruntled employee used her insider knowledge to
purposefully disrupt a computer system. Because of faulty backups, the damage
caused was far more than she ever anticipated.

Chapter 4 • Federal Government
341_INS_THRT_04.qxd  11/19/05  11:49 AM  Page 182

working at the Coast Guard, Singla became increasingly upset by what she viewed as
unresponsiveness to complaints of improper conduct of a contractor. In court docu-
ments, Singla said “I was frustrated and depressed because no one listened to my
complaints of sexual harassment in the workplace.”
On July 8, 1997, Singla dialed in to the Coast Guard network and used a
“shared” password of another (unsuspecting) user. Seven other people were logged
on to the system at the time. Using her access, she purposefully deleted entries
within the database.After doing this, the server immediately crashed and became
inoperable.“I wanted to get even with them,” Singla said.“I did delete information,
but I did not crash the system.”
Because the back-up tapes were faulty, the entire data had to be manually re-
entered.This cost approximately $35,000 and more than 1,800 hours to restore.
Singla was sentenced to ﬁve months in prison, ﬁve months of house arrest, and
ordered to pay restitution for the cost of the damage.
Analysis
At the time, the Coast Guard was using the proprietary Convergent Technologies
operating system.This release of the system had the weakness that enabled Singla to
view the passwords of other users.12 In addition, if the backup system had been oper-
ating properly, the deleted data could have been restored in a matter of minutes.
From this case we learn:
■
To verify the correct operation of backup systems frequently.
■
To educate employees not to share passwords.
■
To not use systems that enable other employees (even administrators) to
view the passwords of users.
■

Summary
Threats from insiders are everywhere in the federal government.There is a difference
between catching someone “browsing” sensitive information, even if it is outside of
his or her ofﬁcial scope, and catching someone distributing the information to
others who would otherwise not have access to it. Just as in state and local organiza-
tions, federal government agencies should restrict access to sensitive databases and log
and frequently review transactions.
Agencies need to make improvements in contract procurement to prevent
insider bribes and kickbacks. Monitor and audit time and attendance, especially of
those that are responsible for submitting the cards after they have been approved by a
supervisor. If requests such as repeated jury duty letters sound suspicious, take the
time to conﬁrm their validity.
Closely monitor and frequently rotate those employees that have responsibilities
dealing with large amounts of money (such as government credit cards). Set credit
limits as low as possible by default.
Audit even small charges, such as corporate or ofﬁce Federal Express account
numbers.Although the cost of misused account numbers may seem insigniﬁcant at
ﬁrst, you can use it to identify employees that are willing to misuse their access. If
you investigation these small charges, you may uncover larger levels of fraud.
Any position involving visa processing is highly susceptible to bribes by brokers.
Even in cases such as conferences and invited speeches, monitor those with the
authority to write travel request letters to continuously ensure their truthfulness.
Verify that backup systems operate properly and ensure that several employees
know the procedures for replacing data that has been corrupted. Make sure that
employees know not to share their passwords, and do not use systems that enable
anyone else (even administrators) to view the passwords of others.
When employees are terminated, verify that their badge and any other access
devices are returned, that their e-mail and other accounts such as virtual private net-
work (VPN) access has been disabled, and that all sensitive documents or letterhead
have been returned.As we will further reiterate in the coming chapters, NEVER
discount disgruntled employees.Their problems will not “go away”, and their anger
will only grow. Part IV of this book contains many suggestions we have to identify
and mitigate their actions before they damage your organization.

Introduction
Ever since a 1998 survey by the Computer Crime Institute in which they reported
that approximately 70 percent of the organizations polled had been the victim of a
computer network attack, and two-thirds of those attacks came from the inside,
“insider threat” has been a recognized concern.1 Sensitive information, such as trade
secrets and other proprietary information, can be worth more than that which is
normally stolen through time and attendance fraud, corporate credit card fraud, or
theft of equipment, as discussed in previous chapters.Although the other threats are
still a concern, protecting information from insiders is a primary focus of most cor-
porations, and consequently of this chapter.
This chapter will discuss various threats to this information, such as sabotage and
theft, the impact of these actions to the reputation and ﬁnancial health of organiza-
tions, and will describe several real-life case studies involving well-known commer-
cial companies. While some attackers were motivated by ﬁnancial greed, most
encountered through our research were simply disgruntled employees. Many of these
angry employees had a grievance about the way the organization was operating, had
recently had administrative action taken against them, faced future administrative
actions, and/or had been dismissed from their position.This raises the sometimes dif-
ﬁcult questions of: how to hire someone that you can trust, how to deal with a dis-
gruntled employee, and how to ﬁre an under-performing or problem employee.
As we describe the landmark case in which a former computer network admin-
istrator at Omega Corporation unleashed a software “bomb” that destroyed impor-

tant design and protection programs, costing the company $10 million dollars, think
about how your company or organization may be vulnerable to this type of attack.
We also discuss other cases of sabotage, such as an administrator deleting necessary
accounting databases, and in turn disrupting payroll, as well as an employee of Forbes
deliberately crashing ﬁve (of only eight) primary servers.
Then we turn our attention toward theft of information, where companies were
driven out of business by insiders that stole software source code and other propri-
etary information. We also analyze cases in which retirees and former employees had
no hesitation in approaching competitors to sell stolen information.
We talk about how insiders can cause damage by impacting a company’s reputa-
tion. In one case in particular, we tell you about an insider that allegedly e-mailed
negative messages to every customer of an Internet hosting company, prompting the
company to eventually go out of business when customers discontinued their con-
tracts.
Toward the end of the chapter we address the direct ﬁnancial losses that can be
caused by malicious insiders.As we will show you, the material wealth of a company,
such as its stock, is also vulnerable. Cisco found this out the hard way when two of
its employees stole nearly eight million dollars’ worth of company stock.
TERMINOLOGY: TRADE SECRET
According to US CODE, Title 18, 1839:
A “trade secret” includes all forms and types of ﬁnancial, business, scien-
tiﬁc, technical, economic, or engineering information, including patterns, plans,
compilations, program devices, formulas, designs, prototypes, methods, tech-
niques, processes, procedures, programs, or codes, whether tangible or intan-
gible, and whether or how stored, compiled, or memorialized physically,
electronically, graphically, photographically, or in writing if— 
(A) the owner thereof has taken reasonable measures to keep such informa-
tion secret; and 
(B) the information derives independent economic value, actual or potential,
from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through
proper means by, the public.
Threats
Similar to the previous two chapters, we start by talking about threats that an organi-
zation can face. For commercial companies, this means the threats from sabotage,

192

341_INS_THR_05.qxd  11/19/05  11:51 AM  Page 192

theft of intellectual property, theft of customer information, impacts to reputation,
and direct ﬁnancial losses. Unlike in the previous chapters, each one of these “pos-
sible” threats has actually been realized in at least one instance. We will talk about
each of these circumstances in detail, but ﬁrst let’s identify the concerns.
Sabotage
Sabotage is commonly characterized by a disgruntled employee who was recently
terminated and has decided to take some type of action in hopes of dooming the
company to failure.Although most of the cases we found ﬁt this mold, it is not
always the case. Individuals can be targets too.
An employee unhappy with a speciﬁc supervisor or coworker can covertly (or
even overtly) sabotage their performance, and in turn the overall productivity of the
company. In one situation, a senior member of an engineering team swiftly changed
the direction of the team over a series of lunches that the supervisor was not privy
to. Because the senior employee interfaced with the team everyday, whereas the
supervisor was only present weekly or bi-weekly, he was their implied leader. He had
long since desired a change in the way the team operated, and he approached the
supervisor with this request.The supervisor indicated that he was adamantly against
it, and for good reasons refused. When this happened the employee spread his inﬂu-
ence upon the other engineers.They respected him and before the supervisor real-
ized it, the entire team was demanding this change.The senior member knew that
the supervisor was against it, so he chose to sabotage his authority by convincing the
team to support him.You could say that this is in some ways a type of mutiny.
Because sabotage is generally motivated by anger or dislike, versus greed, we
believe that while it is capable of inﬂicting the most damage, it is also one of the eas-
iest to prevent.There are warning signs.

anyone who wants to understand and prevent insider threat within their organi-
zation. Key ﬁndings this year include:
■
Insider activities caused organizations ﬁnancial losses, negative
impacts to their business operations, and damage to their reputa-
tions.
■
A negative work-related event triggered most insiders’ actions.
■
Most insiders held a work-related grievance prior to the incident.
■
The most frequently reported motive was revenge.
■
The majority of attacks were accomplished using company computer
equipment.
■
In addition to harming the organizations, the insiders caused harm
to speciﬁc individuals.
■
The majority of insider attacks were only detected once there was a
noticeable irregularity in the information system or a system became
unavailable.
■
System logs were the most prevalent means by which the insider was
identiﬁed.
■
Insiders took steps to conceal their identities and their activities.
■
Most of the incidents were detected by non-security personnel.
■
When hired, the majority of insiders were granted system administer
or privileged access, but less than half of all the insiders had autho-
rized access at the time of the incident.
■
Insiders exploited systemic vulnerabilities in applications, processes,
and/or procedures, but relatively sophisticated attack tools were also
employed.
■
The majority of insiders compromised computer accounts, created
unauthorized backdoor accounts, or used shared accounts in their
attacks.
■
Remote access was used to carry out the majority of the attacks.
■
The majority of attacks took place outside normal working hours.

Theft of Intellectual Property
Competitors within the United States can steal intellectual property, or a foreign
government attempting to provide economic advantage to companies in its own
country can be the initiator. In either event, companies need to work relentlessly to
prevent this theft.To help identify technologies that are frequent targets of this

attack, we have included results from the 2004 Annual Report to Congress on
Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, prepared by the Ofﬁce of
the National Counterintelligence Executive.2 This report highlights several key tech-
nologies that were targeted for theft throughout the 2004 ﬁscal year, including the
following:
Information Systems
As in past years, information technology was the top target of foreign industries in
2004.To put it in perspective, 20 percent of all suspicious activity reported by
Defense Security Services (DSS) and more than 15 percent of the Air Force Ofﬁce
of Special Investigations (AFOSI) was related to information systems threats.These
statistics include both attempts to acquire technologies and attempts to instill tech-
nologies such as foreign-derived software within sensitive, classiﬁed environments.
Sensors
Slightly more than 10 percent of both DSS and AFOSI incidents involved sensor
technology in 2004. Sensors are primarily used by the military and include tech-
nologies such as specialized high-speed cameras, night-vision equipment, and tech-
nology used to be the “eyes and ears” of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).
Aeronautics
UAVs and other sophisticated aeronautics technologies take many years, and many
millions of dollars in research and prototyping, to develop.That probably explains
why 12 percent of DSS and 7 percent of AFOSI incidents were directly related to
aeronautics technologies in 2004.
Electronics
It should be no surprise that electronics accounted for 11 percent of both DSS and
AFOSI incidents.After designs have been perfected and ﬁnalized, they can easily be
reproduced by virtually anyone with manufacturing capabilities.
Armaments & Energetic Materials
The United States military weapons systems rely on armament and energetic mate-
rials.These technologies are used in both attack and defense systems, and exposure of
their capabilities and designs would be highly detrimental to US military forces.
Therefore, they are an obvious target of foreign economic collection and accounted
for approximately 10 percent of DSS and AFOSI incidents in 2004.

Theft of Customer Information
Customer lists are closely guarded within companies. With this sensitive information,
competitors could approach the customers and offer them discounts for their service.
Examples of this can be seen everywhere and in marketing terms are ways that
companies attempt to increase market share.Take grocery shopping for example—we
humans are creatures of habit. When we buy something as mundane as orange juice
we generally stick with a familiar brand. However, competitors of this brand desper-
ately want customers to switch and purchase their product instead.That is why many
cash registers include software that identiﬁes you as a customer of speciﬁc products.
They directly market to you through competing coupons for similar products
printed on your receipt.
This is a simpliﬁed example, but one should be able to grasp the concept. Losing
a single orange juice customer is not going to drive a company into bankruptcy;
however, for a small business that relies on one or two sources of income, this could
be a tremendous loss.
Impact to Reputation
A company cannot survive with a poor reputation. ValuJet is a prime example of
this. When the company ﬁrst started, business was booming—they had the reputa-
tion of low fares, casual dress, and a fun environment.After 110 people died on
ValuJet ﬂight 592, critics widely publicized problems with mismanagement and past
safety issues involving the ﬁre-related losses of several aircrafts.
In an attempt to free themselves from their former image and their path to
bankruptcy, they made a change. On September 24, 1997, CEO Joseph Corr stated,
“I’m pleased to announce that we are permanently retiring the name ValuJet and
henceforth we will be know as AirTran Airlines.”3 ValuJet is not alone in this desperate
effort to divorce from a bad reputation; many other companies have followed suit.
Financial Losses
Direct ﬁnancial theft is the most obvious type of loss that can be caused by an
insider. Unlike concerns involving theft of trade secrets or customer lists, direct
ﬁnancial losses are easier to identify and easier to put a dollar ﬁgure to than others.
This includes most of the other concerns discussed in previous chapters such as time
and attendance fraud; corporate credit card fraud; theft of other materials such as
equipment; and bribes and kickbacks for contracts, subcontracts, and services.As we
will demonstrate, stock and ownership is another area that is frequently targeted in
commercial companies by insiders. Because nearly every stock transfer occurs elec-
tronically, theft can occur with lightening speed.

United States Code 
Relevant to Insider Threat
Throughout this chapter we make several references to US Code Title 18 complaints
against former employees. In the next section of this chapter, we describe what each
section covers, what is included in the charges in each, and their maximum penalties.
Section 1030 Fraud and Related 
Activity in Connection with Computers 
Section 1030 violations are described as follows:
(a) Whoever—
(1) knowingly accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds authorized
access, and by means of such conduct obtains information that has been determined
by the United States Government pursuant to an Executive order or statute to
require protection against unauthorized disclosure for reasons of national defense or
foreign relations, or any restricted data, as deﬁned in paragraph y. of section 11 of the
Atomic Energy Act of 1954, with the intent or reason to believe that such informa-
tion so obtained is to be used to the injury of the United States, or to the advantage
of any foreign nation;
(2) intentionally accesses a computer without authorization or exceeds autho-
rized access, and thereby obtains information contained in a ﬁnancial record of a
ﬁnancial institution, or of a card issuer as deﬁned in section 1602(n) of title 15, or
contained in a ﬁle of a consumer reporting agency on a consumer, as such terms are
deﬁned in the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.);
(3) intentionally, without authorization to access any computer of a department
or agency of the United States, accesses such a computer of that department or
agency that is exclusively for the use of the Government of the United States or, in
the case of a computer not exclusively for such use, is used by or for the
Government of the United States and such conduct adversely affects the use of the
Government’s operation of such computer;
(4) knowingly and with intent to defraud, accesses a Federal interest computer
without authorization, or exceeds authorized access, and by means of such conduct
furthers the intended fraud and obtains anything of value, unless the object of the
fraud and the thing obtained consists only of the use of the computer;
(5)(A) through means of a computer used in interstate commerce or communi-
cations, knowingly causes the transmission of a program, information, code, or com-
mand to a computer or computer system if—

tion, knowingly causes the transmission of a program, information, code, or com-
mand to a computer or computer system—
(i) with reckless disregard of a substantial and unjustiﬁable risk that the transmis-
sion will—
(I) damage, or cause damage to, a computer, computer system, network, informa-
tion, data or program; or
(II) withhold or deny or cause the withholding or denial of the use of a com-
puter, computer services, system, network, information, data or program; and

Internal Sabotage
Now that we have identiﬁed concerns that an insider could pose, we will tell you
about several real-life cases in which they were realized. We will ﬁrst start with one
of the most damaging—sabotage.
The etymology of the word can be linked to two distinct origins: the ﬁrst is
from the Flemish, meaning to use a wooden shoe to jam machinery, 4 while the
second originates in France and refers to how striking railway workers used to cut
the metal sabot that held the tracks in place. 5 In either event, the intentions for both
are to purposely disrupt. However, the question of why is not always clear. Most of
the cases encountered during the process of writing this book are of employees or
contractors who have been terminated. Some are angry with the company for ter-
minating them, some have left of their own accord because the company was not
giving them all they felt they deserved, and some have delusional concepts that
through sabotage the company will appreciate them more. For example, according to
reports, Michael Lauffenberger allegedly felt unappreciated and thought that by sab-

otaging critical General Dynamics Atlas Missile Program data he would be consid-
ered a savior to the company as a “highly paid and valued consultant” following his
resignation. 6
It is important that you realize that your organization is not invulnerable to this.
While some of these arguments may not seem logical to you, to a disgruntled insider
they may appear to make perfect sense. Study each case and ask yourself if it could
happen to you, and what you can do to make sure that it does not.
Case Study: Dismissed Computer 
Programmer Inﬂicts $10 Million in Damage 
The case of the dismissed computer programmer inﬂicting $10 million in damage is
often considered a landmark event in the world of commercial insider threats. It
marks the ﬁrst widely publicized trial of a disgruntled employee that sought payback
using insider knowledge and access.The study is of Timothy Lloyd and the Omega
Engineering Corporation.

Timothy Lloyd
Case Number: 2:98-cr-00061-WHW-1
Details
Timothy Allen Lloyd, of Wilmington, Delaware, started as a machinist for Omega
Engineering Corporation. He climbed up the corporate ladder and became a com-
puter network programmer that was responsible for conﬁguring and maintaining
much of their Novell NetWare infrastructure at the company. In total, Lloyd spent
11 years working at Omega.
According to reports, these years were not always positive and productive.As the
company grew larger, so did their network. Lloyd found many of his responsibilities
being delegated to others and court records indicate that he perceived this as a
demotion.After Omega decided to ﬁre Lloyd, his supervisor asked him to train and

206

341_INS_THR_05.qxd  11/19/05  11:51 AM  Page 206

grant access on the ﬁle server to himself and two other employees. Lloyd never did
this. Following a series of performance and behavioral problems, Lloyd was ﬁred on
July 10, 1996.
Twenty-one days later, on the morning of July 31, 1996, it happened—a pro-
gram that Lloyd had installed on the servers prior to his departure executed and
deleted about 1200 critical programs. Despite their best efforts to restart the server, it
would not function and the manufacturing machines that relied on tooling programs
from the server could not operate properly.
Jim Ferguson was the plant manager at the time and his immediate decision was
to rebuild the server from backup tapes as quickly as possible. However, the backup
tapes were nowhere to be found. He then attempted to retrieve copies of the pro-
grams off individual workstations, but they had been deleted as well.“It was an awful
feeling,” Ferguson said.“We were starting to get an idea of all the impact and what it
was going to mean and how it was going to affect us.”
As a last resort, Ferguson ordered the manufacturing machines to continue oper-
ating with their last set of instructions—even though these orders had already been
ﬁlled. He could not let production cease.According to Assistant U.S.Attorney Grady
O’Malley, Ferguson next telephoned Lloyd and asked:
“Tim, Tim, do you have the backup tapes? Tim, we need those
tapes. Are you sure you don’t have the tapes?” 7
Lloyd told Ferguson that he did not have the tapes, and that they were left in his
desk drawer. Knowing that his desk was completely empty, Ferguson went to Lloyd’s
home and pleaded in person. Still, Lloyd indicated that he did not have possession of
the tapes.
Several different data recovery companies were hired to try to retrieve the
deleted programs, but each told Ferguson that the task was impossible. Ferguson shut
down machines, shufﬂed workers into other departments, and hired a team of pro-
grammers to rewrite the programs.“We were doing everything we could.The other
step would have been to shut down and lay off everybody,” Ferguson said.
One of the data-recovery companies, Ontrack Data International, made a copy
of the damaged Omega hard drive and analyzed it. Greg Olson, their director of
Worldwide Data Recovery Services, identiﬁed a number of anomalies with the disk.
First, he identiﬁed the presence of a user account named “12345” with supervisor
access, but no password. Second he found a program containing six strings that
looked to be the cause of the damage.
Olsen determined that the event started with a specialized script that was trig-
gered by the date July 31. He concluded that this script ﬁrst called a program named
“FIX.EXE” and second purged the drive. In his analysis of FIX.EXE he identiﬁed
www.syngress.com
Commercial • Chapter 5
207
341_INS_THR_05.qxd  11/19/05  11:51 AM  Page 207

that it was actually a copy of DELTREE.EXE, a DOS program used to delete direc-
tories of ﬁles from Windows operating systems.The only difference between the two
programs was that the standard output was changed to read “Fixing” versus
“Deleting.”
To prove that the incident occurred because of this program, Olsen recreated the
scenario in his lab with an old copy of the Omega ﬁle server disk. Just as he had
anticipated, when the system was conﬁgured for July 31, 1996, the script executed,
and the server became completely disabled.
In the meantime, Omega executives reported the case to the U.S. Secret Service,
and Special Agent William Hoffman came to Omega South to investigate. Because
Lloyd was the only person that had the access necessary to cause this damage, and he
was the last person known to possess the backup tapes on July 1, a search warrant
was issued for his house. On August 12, 1996, his home was searched and about 700
pieces of evidence were seized. Some of the most notable included: computers, disks,
CD-ROMs, 12 hard drives, and tapes.Two of the tapes, both reformatted, had in fact
been labeled “Backup” for dates “5/14/96” and “7/1/96.”
Olsen was given one of the conﬁscated “home” computers to analyze. He iden-
tiﬁed that it contained the exact same six lines of code that caused the damage on
the Omega server.
Lloyd was indicted on January 28, 1998, by a Camden federal grand jury.They
alleged he had “caused irreparable damage” to Omega’s computer systems and trans-
ported computer equipment stolen from Omega interstate to his Delaware home.
The trial lasted four weeks, and the defense blamed Omega for not hiring a net-
work administrator in place of Lloyd:
These are the guys who didn’t have a network administrator. These
are the guys whose heads are on the chopping block. It’s about
going to your boss and explaining why you didn’t have a network
administrator. It’s about explaining why you didn’t have a backup
protocol.
The prosecution argued that Lloyd was jealous and physically intimated his
coworkers.As court records indicate, witnesses claimed that Lloyd “repeatedly
elbowed, shoved, and bumped colleagues in the hallways, and that he became ver-
bally abusive.”They contended that Lloyd had been interviewing and had decided to
leave Omega for another job. In their opinion:“This was [Lloyd’s] parting shot to a
company he was leaving, a going-away gift… And it was almost a perfect crime.”

Following three days of jury deliberation, Lloyd was convicted of the computer
sabotage charge and sentenced to three and a half years in prison and more than $2
million dollars in restitution.
Lloyd still maintains his innocence.
Analysis
Several problems come to mind in analyzing this case. First and foremost is that
Lloyd appears to have been the only person with knowledge of the computer sys-
tems in this company. Court records indicate that Lloyd was the only person in the
organization that was responsible for maintaining the backup information. It is
important that you do not allow your organization to become solely dependent on
one person for anything critical to success.
The second problem became evident when Ferguson realized that Lloyd needed
to be replaced: he asked Lloyd to train others, but he refused. Unfortunately, at this
point it was too late, and requests such as this further insulted Lloyd, causing him to
become more disgruntled.As you will see throughout this chapter, an employee
refusing to train others can be a signiﬁcant warning sign for the potential of sabotage.
The third problem we identiﬁed was the out-processing of Lloyd. Many behav-
ioral psychologists, such as Eric Shaw, maintain that ﬁring is not always the best
option. 8 This may have been true in this case; it is hard to say. In either event, the
termination process was poorly handled. When Lloyd left, there was no veriﬁcation
that materials, such as the backup tapes, were properly returned.There was no anal-
ysis of the computer system to ensure that no backdoors or “ticking time bombs”
were left behind. Even worse—they never even placed anyone in Lloyd’s position to
resume these responsibilities. Still, what happened is not the fault of Omega; they did
not commit the crime. In addition, this occurred over ten years ago which was a
time before insider threat was as widely publicized as it is now. Still, it is important
that we critique cases such as this to ensure that these same lessons do not have to
be relearned by others.
The lessons learned in this case are:
■
Do not allow yourself to have a single point of failure: Place more
than one person in charge of the critical aspects of your company (the
two-person rule).
■
Deal with disgruntled employees immediately: Don’t let problems
fester and escalate.

Follow proper procedures during termination: Verify that sensitive
materials are returned and that the terminated employee no longer main-
tains access.
Case Study: Programmer with Access 
to System Passwords Deletes Payroll Data
The previous case introduced the notion that disgruntled employees can sabotage an
organization. Like Lloyd, people complained that the subject of this next case was
also allegedly difﬁcult to work with. 9 Unlike Lloyd, who had left a time bomb
behind to cause the damage, this employee went back to his former place of
employment and did the damage himself.This was also a landmark case because it
was one of the ﬁrst trials in which a computer-generated display was allowed and
considered as admissible evidence.

V.
Donald Gene Burleson
Case Number: 2-88-301-CR 
Details
Donald Burleson worked as a senior programmer and analyst for USPA, an insurance
company based in Fort Worth,Texas.The company had about 450 agents employed,
and most were distributed across the world.
The insurance agents entered their commission information into the USPA
computer system each month, and a few days later they were paid their salaries.This
payroll calculation system relied on the nearly 400,000 records stored on the server.
Most months these commission-based salaries totaled over two million dollars.
Prior to being ﬁred on September 19, 1985, Burleson had the role of adminis-
trator for the IBM System 38 computer used in the commission calculations.
Because of his position, he was aware of passwords used by other employees to log
on the server.

Two days after Burleson was ﬁred, at 8:30 A.M., a USPA employee checked the
payroll report for September. It failed to complete because many of the records
could not be found.
Log ﬁles were analyzed, and they indicated that, oddly, several computers at
USPA (including the one in Burleson’s former ofﬁce) had been turned on between
3:00 A.M. and 3:48 A.M. that same day. One of the computers that had been turned
on belonged to USPA employee Al Wynn, who testiﬁed that he was not in the
building at that time.
Initial thoughts turned to Burleson, but he had turned in his set of keys when he
was ﬁred.Through court testimony, however, it came to light that he had possession
of at least one extra key to the building. From the court records:
By backtracking various computer printouts, Duane Benson, USPA’s
programmer for the payroll commission system, testiﬁed that
records were deleted from the payroll by a set of programs which
were in turn triggered by instructions (jobs) entered into the
system at 3:37 a.m. on September 21. The programs which actually
deleted the records on September 21 were duplicates of a program
(a source program) with a different name that had been created by
September 4, 1985, when Burleson was still employed. By
September 3, 1985, a program had been created that would dupli-
cate programs, change their name, and move them around in the
computer system…
On September 23, 1985, the entire USPA computer system shut
down… On September 28, 1985, Burleson went to Benson’s home
to pick up video tapes. Benson testiﬁed that Burleson admitted that
he created the program responsible for shutting down the com-
puter system as well as creating the programs responsible for
deleting the records.
At the trial, Burleson denied being at USPA on September 3 and insisted that he
and his son were visiting his father in Jasper,Texas. He even provided a Texaco credit
card receipt for a ﬂat tire repair outside town on September 3, 1985. Prosecution,
however, demonstrated that the receipt he presented was fraudulent because it was
printed in a form that was not used by Texaco until 1987. Furthermore, his son was
placed at school that same day, and witnesses placed Burleson at a USPA staff
meeting as well.
A jury convicted Burleson of “harmful access to a computer” and he was sen-
tenced to seven years probation and $11,800 in restitution. Burleson appealed the
case, arguing that:

4.
That evidence did not prove the computer malfunctioned as claimed.
5.
That the charge against him should not have been issued because there was
not enough evidence to prove that he deleted the data.
For the ﬁrst point, the court argued that the number of records deleted did not
matter because even with vagueness of Texas Penal Code section 33.03, it was clear
that the activity was criminal.The second point reafﬁrmed that the indictment was
not based on how he did it, but the fact that he did do it.Third, the court decided
that the evidence did prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the data had been
deleted, and that it was correct to have assigned that same question to the jury.
Forth, and the most historically important, the court announced that:
The court did not err in overruling Burleson’s trial objection to a
computer-generated display showing the number of records
missing from his employer’s data ﬁle because such evidence was
not hearsay, because it was shown to be accurate and reliable,
because it did not violate the best evidence rule or the rules of
optional completeness and related writings, because the spon-
soring witness was qualiﬁed to testify, and because even if the
court did err its err did not beyond a reasonable doubt contribute
to Burleson’s sentence or conviction in that there was other testi-
mony showing that he deleted records from his employer’s data
ﬁle; and, furthermore, the court did not err in overruling Burleson’s
objection to any computer-generated printout because such print-
outs were admissible for the same reasons that the computer-gen-
erated display was admissible, and because any error which may
have been committed did not beyond a reasonable doubt con-
tribute to Burleson’s conviction or sentence in that there was other
testimony that he deleted records.
The appeal judgment was that the original trial was sufﬁcient and that the sen-
tence should stand.This case is important because it marks one of the ﬁrst instances
of computer-generated displays being accepted in courts.

Analysis
This case further emphasizes the importance of proper handling of sensitive com-
pany property such as keys. While Burleson did return his original set, court testi-
mony indicated that other employees were aware that he had made backup copies
for himself. Rarely do companies consider the consequences of the employee
becoming a sabotaging insider when keys are handed out freely. When he was termi-
nated, all of these keys should have been retrieved and accounted for.
NOTE
It is important to note that the 1996 Economic Espionage Act is criminal, not
civil law. This means that investigations are handled by the FBI and United
States Attorneys handle the prosecution. If a company cannot afford council,
the government can provide help. In addition, because of the speedy trial provi-
sion in the Sixth Amendment, these cases will be resolved far sooner than most
civil disputes. They generally don’t last more than one year. However, conviction
in federal cases is more difﬁcult. Prosecution must prove “beyond a reasonable
doubt” versus the much more lenient “preponderance of evidence” in civil trials.

In the case of the former Forbes employee crashing ﬁve servers, no one had com-
plained publicly about problems with the subject. Nevertheless, he was disgruntled
when his temporary status at Forbes was not extended and his employment was ter-
minated. Here, the employee managed to obtain the user name and password of a
current employee and remotely dialed into the system.

George Mario Parente
Case Number: 1:97-cr-01317-HB
Details
George Parente was a temporary computer technician at Forbes, Inc. When his
employment was terminated, he leveraged the user name and password of a
coworker and clandestinely dialed back into the network. With this unauthorized
access he erased all the data and programs on ﬁve servers, subsequently causing them
to crash.
Forbes’ New York operations had to be shut down for two days, which cost the
company more than $100,000.
Parente pleaded guilty on April 7, 1998, and was subsequently sentenced to ﬁve
years of probation (four months to be served as in-home conﬁnement), two hours a
week of group therapy in an impulse—and anger-management program, 200 hours
of community service, and restitution of $19,326 to Forbes, Inc.
Analysis
Without knowing more about the case, we ﬁnd it is hard to say if Parente was moti-
vated by his anger, his ego, or the delusional thought that this action would make
Forbes want to rehire him. In any case, the point of failure here is that he was able
to obtain the user name and password of a co-worker and could remotely access the
computer network without authorization. If the user name and password were
exposed to him because of technical means, that type of authentication system
should not be utilized. Not even administrators should have access to the user names
and passwords of other employees.Assuming that it was an unwitting employee that
provided the information, this case further demonstrates the importance of insider
threat training for everyone in your organization.

Are There Characteristics 
for Those That Will Sabotage?
According to many expert behavioral psychologists, such as Eric Shaw, Ph.D.,
who specializes in employee and organizational relations with security implica-
tions, there are warning signs for those that will do damage within a company.
Shaw calls this vulnerable type of personality a “proprietor.” He writes that:
“Teamwork and cooperation are not the hallmarks of a proprietor. Typically,
he will resist sharing information or training other employees in the intricacies of
his specialized, exclusive knowledge of the company’s systems. His self-imposed
isolation is out of fear that allowing others on his turf will compromise his posi-
tion… They don’t respond well to criticism or change, and don’t think twice
about criticizing others. While they believe they have the best interests of the
organization in mind, their attitudes will often poison employee moral… The
reactions [when challenged] range from sulking to violent outburst, withdrawal
to ﬁghting back with the support of allies, ignoring and avoiding the problem to
altering system components to eliminate the source of the criticism. The string
that ties all proprietors together is that their reaction is always an attempt to pre-
serve their position of control.” 
The signs Shaw deﬁnes to identify a proprietor are as follows. A proprietor:
■
Feels he or she “owns” the system.
■
Feels entitled to special privileges & exceptions to the rules.
■
Won’t delegate any vital responsibilities.
■
Encourages customer dependence on him or her only.
■
Denies others information and access and refuses to document vital
codes and processes.
■
Fights when his control is threatened, including making threats of
violence.
■
Encourages “us vs. them” culture with staff.
■
Contributes to staff turnover by hindering others’ upward mobility.
This personality trait is evident in many of the cases we have described thus
far in this chapter and is seen throughout the remaining case studies. In Chapter
8, Proﬁle, and Chapter 10, Survivability and Prevention, we will research more
into this topic and address how you can detect and mitigate proprietors before

Abdelkader Smires
Case Number: 1:00-cr-00392-RR-1
Details
Abdelkader Smires was a 31-year-old database programmer at Internet Trading
Technologies Corp. (ITTI), located in New York. In the year 2000, ITTI was pro-
cessing a considerably large number of transactions in the online stock trading busi-
ness. Even still, the chief development ofﬁcer, who was also Smires’ supervisor,
resigned from the company on March 6.
The company hired consultants to replace the employee, and asked Smires and
the second programmer to train them. Like many of the other case studies we have
observed, the two employees refused. In an attempt to maintain a stable environ-
ment, ITTI offered to pay the two employees large cash bonuses ($70,000), plus
$50,000 in stock options and a one-year contract. Initially, on March 8, they
accepted the offer, but then they changed their minds the very next day. For these

two employees, this compensation was not enough and they made counteroffers to
the company, threatening to quit if their larger demands were not met.The company
refused their offers and within hours it found its trading network under attack from
a computer in a Manhattan Kinko’s copy center.
These attacks continued for three days. Eric Friedberg, computer and telecom-
munications crime coordinator at the U.S.Attorney’s Ofﬁce in Brooklyn, New York,
said,“Although it was a potentially disastrous attack, it wasn’t a highly sophisticated
attack.” Soon, investigators tracked down a launch point to a computer at the
Queens College Campus in Flushing, New York. Identiﬁcation of the attack location
occurred in real time and within minutes they were onsite. Friedberg said,“Ten
minutes after the defendant had left the building, we were able to ﬁnd a witness to
ﬁnd out who had sat at this computer 10 minutes [earlier].”
On March 14 (two days after the attack concluded), a complaint was issued
against Smires that he “did knowingly cause the transmission of a program, informa-
tion, code, or command, and as a result of such conduct, intentionally caused damage
without authorization to a protected computer in violation of USC 18 1030(5)(A).”
He was immediately arrested and tried. On January 2, 2001, Smires pled guilty and
was sentenced to 10 months (time served), house arrest for two months, two years’
supervised release, and $20,001 in restitution.
Analysis
A $5,000 or $10,000 difference in bonus is probably not the root of the problem in
this case. Even after Smires accepted a particular dollar amount, he went back and
demanded more. In a sense, it is as if no amount would have been sufﬁcient. I once
had an employee demand that he receive a $5,000 increase in salary one year or he
would quit. While on the surface that does not seem to be an outrageous demand, I
felt that his demand had nothing to do with more money.The employee was not
happy and was looking for a reason to leave. Hypothetically, it is possible that Smires
may have felt that he was the next in line for his supervisor’s position, and he may
have been hurt when the consultants were hired from the outside. It is hard to say,
but this demonstrates the importance of how careful you must be when you hire,
ﬁre, or transfer.There is a trickle-down effect from every decision; changes that you
make can signiﬁcantly alter group dynamics.

A telecommuting employee whose status changes to contract worker resents the situa-

Patrick Angle
Case Number: 1:04-cr-10252-RCL-1
Details
Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc., of Massachusetts, hired Patrick
Angle to develop communications software to interface between the company and
its vendors. He established a “work-from-home” arrangement with Varian so that
half his time he could telecommute from his home in New Hampshire. One year
after he started, his family wanted to move to Indiana.Angle asked permission to
continue his employment in a full-time telecommuting status from Indiana.The
company agreed to this change.
Varian did not have an Indiana business license or any other legal establishment
with the state of Indiana.This meant that Angle had to become a contract worker
instead of a standard employee. Contract workers are responsible for their own tax
withholdings, health insurance, retirement, and other beneﬁts.As court records
describe, this upset him:“Angle resented this arrangement and later believed that his
Varian supervisors had not fulﬁlled all of the company’s obligations under the con-
tract.Their relationship deteriorated.” Given these problems,Angle was told around
September 8, 2003, that his contract was going to be terminated in a month.This
certainly did not help matters.

According to the charging document in this case, which was prepared by U.S.
Attorney Michael J. Sullivan,Assistant U.S.Attorney Adam J. Bookbinder, and Trial
Attorney from Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section of United States
Department of Justice Scott Garland, about one week later,Angle attacked Varian’s
computer systems:
On September 17, 2003, from his Indiana home, Angle logged into
Varian’s Cypher computer server in Massachusetts, as he was
authorized to do. This computer held the source code to the e-
commerce software that Angle had been developing for Varian, as
well as the source code to software projects that others at Varian
were developing.
To vent his frustration with Varian and in excess of his authorized
access, Angle then intentionally and without authorization trans-
mitted computer commands to the Cypher server that deleted the
source code for the e-commerce software that he had been devel-
oping, along with the source code for e-commerce software devel-
oped by others at Varian. 
After Angle sabotaged the system, he attempted to cover his tracks by editing the
server’s transaction log ﬁles. In addition, he changed the password for the system to
something none of the other employees would know. When he was ﬁnished, he par-
ticipated in a company teleconference and acted completely normal, not mentioning
anything about what he had done to the computer system. When the teleconference
was wrapping up,Angle announced to everyone that he was not going to complete
the rest of the contract and that it was his last day at Varian.
Angle then preemptively notiﬁed Varian employees about the server problem by
pretending as if he had just tried to log on, but could not. Varian kept backups of the
server and after approximately $26,455 in recovery time, the deleted software had
been replaced.
On August 22, 2004,Angle pled guilty to one count of intentionally damaging a
protected computer, USC 18 1030(a)(5)(A)(i),(B)(i).
Analysis
After analyzing court documents in this case, it appears as if the company was being
extremely ﬂexible with Angle. It is hard to imagine how he was drawn to the point
of committing sabotage. It was his own request to transfer to Indiana, and many
companies at that point would have told him he had to quit. Perhaps it was the way
in which it was handled (not being clear with him about his change of status until
www.syngress.com
Commercial • Chapter 5

341_INS_THR_05.qxd  11/19/05  11:51 AM  Page 219

after he left), or perhaps the legal requirements associated with doing business in a
particular state were never properly explained to him. It could also have been that he
was disgruntled over something entirely different, and like in the previous case, he
used this to fuel his anger. Luckily, Varian did keep backups of their software, because
without them the damage he caused would have been signiﬁcantly more severe.
From this case we can observe:
■
The beneﬁt of maintaining backups: Although time was spent recov-
ering the deleted data, signiﬁcantly more time would have been required if
the data was not backed up
■
The importance of clear and communicated expectations by all
parties: The entire event may have stemmed from a misunderstanding.
Employees (especially those that are remote) need constant lines of com-
munication.This cannot always be over the phone or through e-mail
either; often problems can be solved much more efﬁciently in face-to-face
meetings. For one thing, it demonstrates that the supervisor is attempting to
work with the employee by making the extra effort of meeting with them.
E-mails and phone calls also do not adequately convey the emotions or sig-
niﬁcance of problems to individuals.
Theft of Intellectual Property
Unlike sabotage, theft of intellectual property is not always done by disgruntled
employees. People motivated by greed, those with prior loyalties, engineers and program
managers with feelings of “ownership,” and many, many others steal intellectual property.
Theft of this type is terribly difﬁcult to detect. It is not like when a company has all its
computer equipment stolen by a thief. When information gets stolen it is silent—you
may not ever know when it winds up in the hands of your competitors.
You will notice that, for the most part, it is the honest competitor of the victim
company that raises the red ﬂag. It is troubling to think about how many companies are
not this ethical and how many fund and encourage the insider to provide further details.

Ellery Systems, Inc. was a small company located in Boulder, Colorado, that designed
and built distributed computing devices.They were funded by both the United
States Department of Defense and NASA to build a suite of innovative software
applications.Their proprietary software cost $950,000 and was on the verge of full
commercialization that is estimated to have been in the “tens of billions of dollars.” 10
One of Ellery’s trusted employees was a Chinese citizen named Liaosheng Wang
(a.k.a.Andrew Wang). While working at Ellery, Wang scheduled a trip back to China
to “visit his sick mother.” Only days after he returned, he suddenly resigned.
In a completely unauthorized activity, the next day proprietary source code that
belonged to Ellery was allegedly downloaded across the Internet to a friend of Wang
named Jing Cui who was also a Chinese citizen.
Wang confessed that he received $550,000 from a Chinese government-con-
trolled corporation named Beijing Machinery Import & Export (Group) Corp to
form a new and competing company.
At the time of this crime there was no federal statute against corporate/eco-
nomic espionage and the charges were dropped. Ellery was left with nothing.The
company promptly went out of business, and 25 employees were left without jobs.

Analysis
This case, and Congressional testimony by the former Chief Executive Ofﬁcer of
Ellery, Geoffrey Shaw, were driving forces in the creation of the Economic
Espionage Act of 1996.The good news is that there is legislation in place to prose-
cute cases of this nature now, but it still remains that prevention is best when pos-
sible. In this situation, the actual downloading of the source code occurred one day
after Wang resigned. Following his resignation, his access should have been limited
and passwords should have changed to protect the intellectual property.

Timothy Kissane
Case Number: 1:02-cr-00626-RCC-1 
Details
Timothy Kissane was a release engineer at the software company System
Management Arts Incorporated (SMARTS).The company SMARTS had a product
they called InCharge that was designed to monitor the status of large computer net-
works. SMARTS sold this product to telecommunications companies across the
world and kept its source code a guarded secret. Like other SMARTS employees,
Kissane signed a legally binding agreement to maintain this secrecy and not to dis-
close this proprietary information.
Kissane was terminated from SMARTS on November 28, 2001.Two weeks after
this date, two competitors approached SMARTS and indicated that they received
unsolicited offers for the sale of proprietary information.The offers had come from
an e-mail alias for the Yahoo account of “Joe Friday.”The e-mail offered proprietary
source code, in particular,“cvs repository of SMARTS InCharge code, from
11/20/01 as well as custom code for speciﬁc bug ﬁxes and customer-requested
enhancements.”Transmission of the e-mail was traced to a White Plains, New York,
library. In addition, the Yahoo account was also accessed a number of times from the
address of Kissane in Lavallette, New Jersey.
Timothy Kissane pled guilty to USC 18 1832(f),Theft of Trade Secrets, and was
sentenced to two years’ imprisonment with two years’ of supervised release.
Analysis
Revision control systems such as CVS are a godsend for conﬁguration management.
However, because they enable developers to “check out” copies of sensitive source
code quickly and without much oversight, they can be damaging to the protection
of intellectual property. It is difﬁcult to have employees operate in an efﬁcient
manner without freedom and trust. However, as in the previous chapter on the
Federal Government, the “need-to-know” principle must be practiced.
However, even with need-to-know, Kissane still could have attempted to sell “his
piece” of the work. When it comes to software development, there is a technology
gap between convenience and protection. In the future it would be helpful if there
were some sort of enforceable expiration of the software after some time.The feasi-

be seen.
A Closer Look…
Insiders May Not Always Have Bad Intentions
All throughout this book we provide descriptions of cases in which insiders pur-
posefully sabotage, steal, spy on, and sell out the very organizations that provide
them with salary and employment. While these cases take the limelight, it is fair to
say that not all insiders have bad intentions. In fact, sometimes the very character-
istics that make a good employee great, may in some ways be a vulnerability.
Take an academic conference for example. This is a chance for the top
researchers in a ﬁeld to get together to exchange cutting-edge ideas and “lessons
learned.” Especially in the case of workshops, the purpose is for participants to
combine experiences and further enhance the sciences. Academic conferences
are generally not tremendous business-development opportunities and for the
most part discussions are held at the technical level. This means that attendees
tend to be researchers and scientists who are not necessarily concerned over pro-
prietary/trade secret boundaries. 
As the Ofﬁce of the National Counterintelligence Executive’s Annual Report
to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage for 2004
describes, conferences such as these are a prime place where insiders may
unknowingly leak sensitive information to foreign and domestic competitors:
“One of the oldest methods used to extract technologies is the targeting at
conventions, expositions, and trade shows…. Standard collection procedures
involve clandestinely ﬁlming equipment, stealing exhibitor’s technical reference
manuals, and engaging exhibitors in discussions that might yield classiﬁed mate-
rial or ﬁll collection gaps. Exhibitors, on occasion, have also had their equipment
searched and photographed at ports of entry or have had their hotel rooms clan-
destinely entered and searched for sensitive information.”
Similarly, the report also touches on the dangers that an ill-prepared insider
can bring to a company while traveling:
“Foreign governments and businesses continue to acquire sensitive US pro-
prietary information from all types of electronic storage devices, including laptop
computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and cell phones carried by US busi-
nessman traveling abroad.” 
Unfortunately, environments such as these may not always be as safe as one
might expect, and companies must instruct employees to watch for these types
of threats. When traveling, all unnecessary information should be removed from

electronic devices and sensitive data should be protected. Conference attendees
and presenters should be told to expect probing questions and should be taught
to deal with them in an appropriate manner. When incidents arise they should be
reported to your local FBI ofﬁce.

One of the clients of 3DGeo was a Chinese oil company named PetroChina.
PetroChina purchased a copy of this software, and this purchase entitled them to a

3DGeo employee Ovidiv Fedorov and 3DGeo employee Iulian Musat
discovered that Shan was in the process of organizing a large
volume of copied ﬁles into one large master ﬁle. They were able to
observe this from their own terminals when it occurred. As Fedorov
and Musat watched, Shan changed the ﬁle from a visible ﬁle to a
hidden ﬁle, thereby attempting to disguise what he was doing. 
Fedorov began to search the ﬁle in more detail and discovered that
Shan had made copies of 3DGeo proprietary software programs
and source code, none of which is supposed to be accessible to
Shan or Qiao. All of this information is password protected.
Fedorov and Musat, acting on their own and without direction
from any law enforcement agency, looked at Qiao’s laptop com-
puter. In it they found copies of the aforementioned programs and
information, including the company’s source code.
Additionally, Fedorov and Musat found a ﬁle containing 3DGeo’s
password ﬁle. In the same ﬁle, the two saw a program called
“crack,” which is used solely to penetrate encrypted software pro-
grams by decoding the protecting passwords.
On July 7, 2004, Shan pleaded guilty to USC 18 1030(a)(4), Unauthorized
Access of a Protected Computer with Intent to Defraud and Obtaining Something
of Value. He was sentenced to time served (24 months) and two years of supervised
release.
Analysis
Enforcing security requirements on employees is both sensitive and difﬁcult, but
when you try to do the same for customers that have a check in their hand, it
becomes even more complicated. Here a customer misused his access at a vendor’s
company to conduct economic espionage.The employees of 3DGeo should be com-
mended for their vigilant work in the detection of this activity. Without it, the com-
pany may have found itself driven out of business like many of the other unfortunate
victims in this chapter.
Economic espionage by customers is not as rare as you might imagine. Many of
our clients have found out that their customers were actually “fronts” for competi-
tors or foreign companies that are not allowed to acquire the technology. Beyond
straightforward theft like what is described in this case, customers learn your rates,
proposal style, key employee names and qualiﬁcations, and most of all… capabilities.
Just as you would perform due diligence with a subcontractor you might hire, we

This is especially necessary when dealing with export-controlled materials (refer to
the US State Department Trade Controls Policy for more details). 11
Case Study: Loss of “Buy-in” Causes 
Employee to Turn Against His Company
The subject in this case is the senior member of a company. When he ﬁnds out that
the company is going to cease to exist in its current capacity he loses his loyalty and
attempts to proﬁt using economic espionage. He offers to sell intellectual property to
a customer, who in turn contacts the authorities.

Brent Alan Woodard
Case Number: 5:03-cr-20066
Details
Brent Woodard was the Director of Information Technology at Lightwave
Microsystems, Inc. When the company announced plans to stop operations in late
2002, his loyalty ceased.This change triggered Woodard to secretly steal trade secrets
and offer to sell them to one of Lightwave’s biggest competitors.
Woodard accomplished this by copying information off proprietary Lightwave
backup tapes. He then established an alias of “Joe Data” and sent an e-mail from the
account “lightwavedata@yahoo.com” to competitor JDS-Uniphase. When the chief
technology ofﬁcer at JDS received the suspicious e-mail, he immediately contacted
the FBI.The FBI then clandestinely took over the communications and began nego-
tiating terms with Woodard. While these exchanges took place, investigators were
able to trace the origination of the e-mails to Woodard’s residence.
With evidence in hand, the FBI executed a search warrant of his home in
December 2002, and an indictment for Woodard was issued shortly thereafter.
After many trial delays, on August 1, 2005, Woodard pled guilty to one count of
theft of trade secrets under USC 18 1832. His sentencing is scheduled for December

5, 2005, at 9:00 A.M. The maximum penalty for this count is 10 years in prison with
a ﬁne of $250,000, after consideration of the U.S. sentencing guidelines and the fed-
eral sentencing statute USC 18 3553.
Lightwave Microsystems, Inc has since been bought by Neophotonics
Corporation.
Analysis
Transition from one company ownership to another (most of us have done it at least
once) is difﬁcult. It is even more difﬁcult when the company gets purchased by an
organization that was previously considered a competitor.After you give time to a
company, there is a natural tendency to lose loyalty after being told that it will cease
to exist in one year. While that certainly does not make the crimes committed by
Woodard right, it deﬁnitely makes the job of detection and prevention even more
difﬁcult than in regular situations.This is a very special circumstance that needs to be
handled with great care and with tremendous oversight of the protection of propri-
etary information. It is a situation such as this that can cause someone unexpected,
such as a director in an organization, to turn against the company.
Case Study: Eastman Kodak 
Corporation Is Victimized by a Retiree
Although there are not a lot of public domain details available on the following case,
it does highlight the fact that insiders are not always disgruntled employees.They can
be retirees who have dedicated their careers to an organization. Here an employee
retired and then stole from a company after working there for 28 years.

Details
Harold Worden is not your average insider. He dedicated the better half of his life
(28 years) to Eastman Kodak. During this time, he was one of the key members of
the team that designed something called “the 401 machine” inside Kodak. It was a
machine to make the chemical acetate, an essential component of photographic ﬁlm.
When he retired in 1992, he started his own consulting company.According to
case records he actively recruited as many as 63 current and recently retired
employees of Kodak to participate in his business. From this network he was able to
obtain and sell conﬁdential information that belonged to Kodak, including informa-
tion about the 401 machine process.The activity was discovered when he attempted
to sell information to Kodak ofﬁcials that were actually posing as Chinese agents.
Worden was indicted on August 28, 1997, and immediately pled guilty to one
count of transportation of stolen property, USC 18 2314. He was sentenced a month
later to 12 months in prison, three years’ supervised release including three months
of home conﬁnement and 100 hours of community service, and a $30,000 ﬁne.
When he was sentenced, Federal Judge Michael Telesca criticized Worden for
attempting to sell his information to “not just any foreign national, but China.”
Analysis
Educate, educate, and educate your employees about the harm of economic espi-
onage against everyone. It is alleged that many of the individuals within this network
were selling stolen information for $5,000 or $10,000.This amount of money means
nothing when your entire organization can no longer afford to stay in business
because you have just given your secrets to competitors. Enforce a strong zero-toler-
ance rule for misuse of information. Convey to the employees that your organization
closely guards proprietary trade secrets and the importance of not disclosing them to
anyone, not even friends or past coworkers and supervisors.
Theft of Customer Information
As the cases in this section illustrate, insider threat does not just target technical
details such as engineering drawings or source codes. It includes sensitive proprietary
information such as customer information and sales leads for competitive advantage.
As this ﬁrst demonstrates, you need to think beyond computer systems when dealing
with insiders.Anything, including the telephone system, is vulnerable.

John Hebel
Case Number: 1:96-cr-10288-JLT-1
Details
John Hebel was a ﬁeld sales manager for the Standard Duplicating Machines
Corporation and worked directly from his home. However, his position was termi-
nated by Standard after two years and Hebel accepted a position with one of their
competitors.
While working for this competitor, Hebel repeatedly broke into the voice mail
system that belonged to Standard.The messages in this system contained sales leads
and customer information and could be used for competitive advantage over
Standard.
Hebel knew how to do this because he was an insider. He knew the phone
number to call, and he knew that the default password for the mailboxes was the
extension number and the pound sign. Unfortunately for Standard, Hebel also knew
that most employees never changed their passwords from this default.
For one year he was able to access the system without detection. He did this
several hundred times.According to one report, Standard learned about Hebel when a
customer notiﬁed them that they had been solicited by Hebel after they left a voice
message at Standard.13 Shortly thereafter, Hebel was arrested, charged with wire
fraud, and sentenced to two years of probation.

Analysis
Instruct and then periodically verify that employees change the initial passwords they
are given. Default passwords should NEVER be used, not even for unimportant sys-
tems.They seem to migrate into places they should not. For example, one of my ﬁrst
jobs was as a developer in a large lab with many computers. Remembering all the
passwords would be impossible so they were all set to one default.A few years later I
left and began working somewhere else with some of my previous co-workers.
Before I knew it, I began seeing a few servers at this new job set to this same pass-
word. It had migrated.Try not to encourage the use of one common or default pass-
word, or if you must have one, ensure that it is changed frequently (especially after
people have been terminated).

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution and the Gwinnett Daily Post had an ongoing dispute
about 34,000 newspaper subscriptions that involved a cable TV operator.The legality

Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
At the time, Carroll Campbell, Jr., was a circulation manager for the Gwinnett
Daily Post and Paul Soucy was a circulation manager for the sister newspaper,

Rockwell Citizen. While they were in these positions, Campbell used the alias
“Athena” to communicate with prosecuting Atlanta Journal-Constitution attorneys for
the case. In his letters, he offered to send copies of proprietary Post ﬁnancial and
business information, including a copy of the agreement with the cable entity that
was being challenged. In exchange for this sensitive proprietary information,
Campbell requested a payment of $150,000.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution was instructed to place a personals ad in their
newspaper if they were interested in purchasing this information. Rather than
dealing with “Athena,” they reported the offer to the FBI, which began investigating.
At the instruction of the FBI, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution placed an ad to Athena
in the personals.
After several correspondences, a meeting took place between “Athena” and an
undercover FBI agent. Campbell (a.k.a.Athena) provided a sample of the proprietary
information in exchange for $5,000.After he received it, he asked his wife (who was
proven to be innocent in this case because she was not aware of the origin of the
money) to give $1,500 of it to Paul Soucy.According to reports, Soucy was a
“lookout” during Campbell’s meetings with the FBI, who he thought was a repre-
sentative from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 14 It is also alleged that Campbell
offered another employee $300 in exchange for additional trade-secret information.
Campbell, Campbell’s wife, and Soucy were subsequently arrested on February
6, 1998. Campbell pleaded guilty to conspiracy to sell trade secrets and was sen-
tenced to three months’ imprisonment, four months’“in-house” electronic moni-
toring arrest, and three years’ supervised probation.
Analysis
This case is a bit different from the others because in theory Campbell seems to have
been attempting to act as a whistle-blower to expose alleged corruption in his orga-
nization. However, when he accepted payment in exchange for this information, he
jeopardized this defense. In conducting our research, we found a posting that was
reportedly from C. Lee Campbell, Jr. 15 What is written in this e-mail (whether
authentically written by Campbell or not) is important to reﬂect upon. It states:“A
mistake does not deﬁne me as a human being. It was just a mistake.” Motivations for
people’s actions are not always evident, and they are certainly not contained in court
proceedings. It is our goal to help organizations prevent or identify incidents in
which insiders have exposed, stolen, sold, or otherwise damaged the property of an
organization. In no way do we intend to judge or criticize actions of any of these
employees. Preventing this action by Campbell would have been difﬁcult, because in
his position he could easily acquire this information.

Impact to Reputation
Damage to a reputation can be as detrimental as theft or sabotage. Imagine the repu-
tation of a computer security company being inﬁltrated by hackers, or even worse,
insiders. What would customers of an accounting ﬁrm think if their information was
found distributed to their competitors? While the actions themselves may or may
not damage the company, the impact of these actions to their reputation can push
them out of business.

In September 2000, a disgruntled former Elite Web Hosting employee allegedly
broke into company computer systems and sent vulgar e-mails to every customer
“revealing” that Elite was transitioning into the Web porn business.The problem was
that Elite was not shifting into this line of business and the e-mails were unautho-
rized.The angry e-mails even went as far as accusing majority owner Augustino
Mireles of stealing from the company.
Thirty of Elite’s customers stopped their service, which equated to an immediate
loss of $150,000 a month in revenue.The company hired a computer-security com-
pany to try to rebuild their reputation and ensure the security of their servers, but it
was not enough. Elite never made up the revenue and eventually went out of busi-
ness. Charges were never ﬁled against the employee from this incident because, as
Mireles said, you “can’t get blood out of a stone.”The former employee was however

Analysis
As has been discussed in previous cases, you should make it difﬁcult for any one

tion as conﬁdential and should implement technology to prevent “spamming” of

Jason Smathers
Case Number: 1:04-cr-01273-AKH-1
Details
Jason Smathers was a 25-year-old employee of America Online (AOL), a wholly
owned subsidiary of Time Warner, Inc when, according to court records:
“From at least in or about April 2003, up to and including in or
about April 2004, … unlawfully, willfully, and knowingly did com-
bine, conspire, confederate [with others] and agree together and
with each other to violate the laws of the United States, to wit,
Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1037(a)(2), (b)(2)(C) and
(b)(2)(E), and 2314.” 
Smathers illegally used the credentials of another employee to access the 2003
AOL customer subscription list (92 million e-mail addresses and screen names).This
list was retrieved from a computer located at AOL headquarters in Dulles, Virginia.
www.syngress.com
234
Chapter 5 • Commercial
341_INS_THR_05.qxd  11/19/05  11:51 AM  Page 234

After he stole the list, Smathers sold it to Sean Dunaway, of Las Vegas. Dunaway had
told Smathers that he intended to use it to advertise offshore gambling to AOL cus-
tomers. However, Smathers admitted to knowing that the list may also be trans-
mitted to others that intended to send unsolicited e-mails (SPAM). In addition,
because Smathers worked with others in “deceptive practices to ensure that spam
sent in connection with the stolen list reached its intended recipients, and would not
be detected and ﬁltered by anti-spam technology,” he was in violation of the CAN-
SPAM Act.
Smathers sold the list in its entirety for $28,000. However, the damage to AOL
and its customers was enormous. It is estimated that approximately seven billion
unsolicited e-mails were sent because of this crime, plus the list is still thought to be
circulating and being used by spammers, which potentially puts the number even
higher each day. For AOL, quantifying this damage is difﬁcult. Original estimates are
that the damage was $300,000, but others have speculated that it actually reaches in
the millions when the cost to public reputation is considered.At one of the hearings
in December, the judge himself admitted that he had cancelled his own AOL service
because of the large amounts of spam he was receiving. In court, Smathers said,“I
know I’ve done something very wrong.” On August 17, 2005 Smathers was sen-
tenced to one year and three months in prison.This was a lenient sentence owing to
his cooperation during the case.
Analysis
It is extremely difﬁcult to pinpoint how much of a ﬁnancial impact this made to
AOL. In theory, both this spam and the advertising of this case persuaded many
people to discontinue their service with this provider. It is hard to quantify how
many years these clients would have otherwise subscribed to AOL, or how many
additional people discontinued their service, or chose not to select this provider
because of what these former clients may have said.
As far as prevention, Smathers did not have legitimate access to the list he sold.
At the time,AOL ofﬁcials probably did not realize the extent to which spammers
would go to obtain their e-mail addresses.
This case should be an eye-opener for large companies with many e-mail
addresses. Few organizations protect this information.Your list could also be stolen
and sold to spammers. Unsolicited e-mail wastes peoples’ time, reduces performance
on networks, and has been known to carry viruses. Consider treating your own dis-
tribution lists as sensitive information and educate your employees not to post their
work e-mail addresses to mailing lists and Web pages, because these are also places
where spammers look to collect information.

Geoffrey Osowski was a ﬁnancial analyst and Wilson Tang was an accounting manager
for Cisco Systems.As insiders they knew the ins and outs of the Sabrina computer
system that was used to manage stock options for the company.The pair eventually
used this knowledge in a malicious manner to break in and issue themselves 230,000
shares of the stock.They then sold this illegally obtained stock and purchased lavish
items such as a new Mercedes 320 for $52,000, a diamond ring for $44,000, and a
Rolex watch for $20,000.16 According to the sentencing announcement:
“… the ﬁrst time that they did this, in December 2000, they caused 97,750
shares of Cisco stock to be placed in two separate Merrill Lynch accounts, with
58,250 of the shares deposited into an account set up by Mr. Osowski and 39,500
shares deposited in an account set up by Mr.Tang. In February 2001, they caused
two additional transfers of stock, in amounts of 67,500 shares and 65,300 shares, to
be transferred to brokerage accounts in their name.”

and was sentenced to 34 months in prison, three years of supervised release, and
$7,868,637.50 in restitution.
Analysis
Fortunately, general auditing of ﬁnancial components of an organization are con-
ducted on a frequent basis, and in general is a more mature ﬁeld compared to intel-
lectual property protection.As this case demonstrates, however, it is still vulnerable to
insiders.You will see many more cases involving theft of stock and insider trading in
the next chapter.
NOTE
According to the 2005 Insider Threat Survey, the majority of insiders are actually
former employees. The report states that:
■
At the time of the incident, 59% of the insiders were former
employees or contractors of the affected organizations and 41% were
current employees or contractors.
■
The former employees or contractors left their positions for a variety of
reasons. These included the insiders being ﬁred (48%), resigning
(38%), and being laid off (7%).

Summary
Protecting information from insiders is a primary focus of most corporations. Our
research indicates that most of the subjects in current cases are disgruntled employees
who were upset over ways companies operated (whistle-blowers), had the perception
that the intellectual property legitimately belonged to them, became angry after recent
administrative action was taken against them, were knowledgeable of future administra-
tive action they faced, and/or had been recently terminated by the company.
However, we do not overlook the rare circumstance in which insiders appear to
have allegiances to other companies, or even other countries, that can be a strong
motivation.The 2004 Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and
Industrial Espionage, prepared by the Ofﬁce of the National Counterintelligence
Executive, identiﬁes the following as key technology targets of economic espionage:
information systems, sensors, aeronautics, electronics, and armaments and energetic
materials.17 Beyond pure technological intellectual property theft, companies need to
be concerned over theft of customer information, theft of ﬁnancial assets such as
stock, and negative impacts that insiders can make to their reputation.

Speaking about the attempted heist of £220 million ($420 million)
in March 2005 when keylogging software was discovered on sev-
eral computers at the London branch of the Japanese Sumitomo
Bank, and an attempt was made to illegally transfer money. 
“The defendants took advantage of an insider’s access to sensitive
information in much the same way that a gang of thieves might
get the combination to the bank vault from an insider. But the
potential windfall was probably far greater than the contents of a
bank vault, and using 21st century technology, they didn’t even
need a getaway car.”
— Kevin Donovan, the Assistant Director in Charge of the New York
Field Ofﬁce of the FBI, November 25, 2002, referring to the defen-
dants in a case that authorities believe to be the largest identify
theft case in U.S. history.
Introduction
Examples of insiders participating in bank heists have been around nearly as long as
banks themselves. Because of technology, today the threat is much more complex.
Besides traditional armed robberies, which we will demonstrate still occur with help
from insiders, banking and ﬁnancial institutions need to be prepared to prevent and
mitigate the larger threat of damage from electronic transactions. Like the other cases
discussed in this book, these transactions can include sabotage and theft. Several real
cases demonstrating this will be studied within this chapter.

Insider Threat Study: Illicit Cyber 
Activity in the Banking and Finance Sector
Here are the key ﬁndings of the 2004 United States Secret Service National Threat
Assessment Center (NTAC) and Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering
Institute’s CERT® Coordination Center (CERT/CC) Insider Threat study, which
focused on banking and ﬁnance sector incidents. The ﬁndings come from anal-
ysis of 23 cases that involved 26 insiders.
1. Most incidents required little technical sophistication.
2. Perpetrators planned their actions.
3. Financial gain motivated most perpetrators.
4. Perpetrators did not share a common proﬁle.
5. Incidents were detected by various methods and people.
6. Victim organizations suffered ﬁnancial loss.
7. Perpetrators committed acts while on the job.
Some of the interesting statistics from the study include the following:
In 70% of cases studied, the insiders exploited or attempted to exploit sys-
tematic vulnerabilities in applications and/or processes or procedures (for
example, business rule checks and authorized overrides) to carry out the inci-
dents. In 61% of the cases, insiders exploited vulnerabilities inherent in the
design of the hardware, software, or network.
In 85% of the incidents, someone other than the insider had full or partial
knowledge about the insider’s intentions, plans, and/or activities (22% of those
were co-workers).
In 31% of the incidents, there was some indication that the insider’s plan-
ning behavior was noticeable. Planning behaviors included stealing administra-
tive-level passwords, copying information from a home computer onto the
organization’s system, and approaching a former co-worker to get help in
changing ﬁnancial data.
Twenty-seven percent of the insiders had prior arrests.
Eighty-tree percent of the insider threat cases involved attacks that took
place physically from within the insider’s organization. In 70% of the cases, the
incidents took place during normal working hours. Thirty percent of the incidents
were carried out from the insiders’ homes through remote access. Of those
attacks, 57% involved actions both at the workplace and from home.

We encourage you to download (www.cert.org/archive/pdf/bankfin
040820.pdf) and read this study in its entirety. Although only a fraction of the
cases discussed in this chapter overlap with the cases in the studies, there is a
remarkable parallel between the main ﬁndings.
Threats
The banking and ﬁnancial sector has most recently suffered through the seemingly
constant stream of databases containing identity information being “lost” and stolen.
In most of these cases, an outside hacker did not access the databases. Insiders sold
them, or inside information was used to acquire them.Although these threats have
grabbed recent headlines, they are not the most signiﬁcant concern of these institu-
tions. Unlike all the other sectors we have discussed, the foundation for banks is cur-
rency.This means that instead of stealing trade secrets and selling them to
competitors, insiders can skip right to embezzling money.
However, motivation is not always this simple. When it comes to this sector, we
will study another situation: rogue trading.Traders are paid to use their experience
and ﬁne-tuned judgment to make investment decisions that will eventually turn over
a proﬁt. When these traders make mistakes, they lose money. However, ego and/or
management style sometimes push these traders to hide their mistakes. By hiding the
problems they use insider know-how to bypass necessary checks and balances within
organizations.As we will demonstrate, this can be a costly event for a company
because the losses can grow unfettered.
Sabotage
Like with the insiders we’ve seen in previous chapters, banking and ﬁnancial sector
insiders usually show signs of being disgruntled. Unlike those in previous chapters
though, ﬁnancial sector insiders demonstrate that they understand concepts of invest-
ment. We will describe a case involving an employee of USB PaineWebber that pur-
chased a large number of “put” options for his company prior to allegedly causing
damage to their computer network. It is alleged that in addition to disrupting the
operations of the company, he anticipated that the price of the stock would
plummet from his actions, and that he would beneﬁt ﬁnancially through his put
options.

Theft
Theft involving banking and ﬁnance is complex. Insiders can steal, embezzle, make
poor decisions with money, and compromise intellectual property as in previous cases.
Financial Theft
Financial theft is fairly straightforward.An insider that knows the system and knows
how to exploit it is likely to do so.The insider either helps to arrange a robbery at a
large institution, or transfers money to secret accounts. Some cases are even more
intriguing. One we will discuss occurred recently when the Helsinki branch of GE
Money realized that someone “broke” into their network and stole money. Records
pointed to a neighborhood apartment complex.This apartment had unsecured wire-
less access, and, as it turns out, a bank insider is suspected of illegally transferring the
money from this access point.
Rogue Trading
From the late Rear Admiral Eugene Carroll, U.S. Navy (retired), we learn that “there
is an old military doctrine called the First Rule of Holes: If you ﬁnd yourself stuck
in one, stop digging.”This is a rule that the perpetrators in the cases that follow
would have beneﬁted greatly from.As Nick Leeson, one of the rogue traders said,“It
had started off so small, but had rapidly seized hold and was now all across me like a
cancer.”1
Rogue trading is a problem that we will explore in depth. Besides its obvious
implication to the banking and ﬁnance sector, it has consequences for all organiza-
tions. Rogue traders are highly motivated employees that make mistakes.These mis-
takes are compounded with their belief that the mistake was a one-time occurrence
that they can make up for without reporting the problem.The issue comes when
their belief is incorrect and instead of one mistake that can be easily corrected for,
the problem is compounded.Their losses grow and practically double in size with
each attempt to make up for the problem. We will discuss cases such as John Rusnak
who lost $691 million at AllFirst Bank and Nick Leeson who bankrupted Barrings
Bank with $1 billion in losses, among others.
Intellectual Property
Like any institution, banks and ﬁnancial sector companies have intellectual property.
Unlike engineering ﬁrms that guard trade secrets, these organizations generally have
large collections of conﬁdential customer information. In the wrong hands, this
information can lead to identity theft and fraudulent purchases.

Case Study: Disgruntled USB 
PaineWebber Employee Charged with Sabotage
We study this case ﬁrst to illustrate that ﬁnancial institutions are not immune to sab-
otage, and second to show that insiders in these organizations are savvy of the ﬁnan-
cial consequences.The employee in this case allegedly caused signiﬁcant damage to
the computer network of the organization, but before he did this he purchased a
large number of “put” options. He anticipated beneﬁting ﬁnancially from these
options.

Roger Duronio
Case Number: 2:02-CR-00933-JAG-1
Details
Roger Duronio allegedly launched a software logic bomb that caused more than $3
million in damage to his company. Unlike previous cases of sabotage, reports indicate
that Duronio had a plan to ﬁnancially beneﬁt from this event.Although this event
took place in 2002, this is a complex case and the trial is ongoing.
It all started in Weehawken, New Jersey, where PaineWebber hired Roger
Duronio on June 28, 1999. He was a system administrator who had access to and
responsibility for the entire USB PaineWebber computer network. His base salary
was $115,000 and his contract allowed for $60,000 a year in bonuses. However, he
continually expressed his dissatisfaction with his earnings.Then, on Friday February
22, 2002, he quit. One week later, approximately 1,500 networked computers for the
company failed.
At the same time, Duronio purchased put option contracts for $21,762 that
expired on March 15, 2002; he had anticipated that the stock price would soon go
down.

NOTE
A put option enables someone to sell his or her stock at the pre-designated
strike price rather than the current market price. If the actual price is less than
the stock price, the owner of the put options makes a proﬁt when it is exer-
cised: strike price – current price = proﬁt. 
In Roger Duronio’s case, he purchased options at an average strike price of
$42.91 for 31,800 shares of USB stock.2 If the price of stock had fallen to
$35.00 he would have made $7.91 off each share:
($42.91 - $35.00) x 31,800 = $251,538
However, the attack that occurred was not made public at the time, and the
price of stock in March never fell lower than $45.00.
http://biz.yahoo.com/opt/basics4.html
Early in the morning on Monday, March 4, 2002, more than 1,000 of USB
PaineWebber’s UNIX systems (AIX and Solaris) had their entire hard drives deleted.
As described in the Evidentiary Summary from court documents:
The logic bomb had three basic parts: (1) a trigger, (2) an initiator,
and (3) a payload. A trigger—a compiled binary named “rpc.logd”
and “syschg”—caused the infected computers to execute the pay-
load at 9:30 a.m. on Mondays in March, April, or May. The initiator
—an OS-speciﬁc shell script named “rc.nfs” for AIX and
“S71rpclog” for Solaris—ensured that the trigger executed even
after reboots. The payload—a copy of the UNIX “rm” command—
deleted the entire hard drive of the infected computers.
One of the central servers was used to distribute this attack throughout the net-
work.This server ﬁrst scanned to ensure that the computers were capable of running
the “rc.nfs” shell script. If they were, the program “rsh_scan2.ksh” did the following
(verbatim from the Evidentiary Summary):
■
Connected to each target computer;
■
Copied and ran a shell script on each target computer, which stopped the trigger
(“rpc.logd”) from executing;
■
Updated the trigger by placing copies of the trigger into two ﬁles: /usr/sbin/rpc.logd
and /usr/bin/syschg;
■
Instructed each computer to create “mrm” by saving the “rm” command as “mrm”;

Banking and Financial Sector • Chapter 6
247
341_INS_THR_06.qxd  11/21/05  12:01 PM  Page 247

■
Restarted to “rpc.logd” trigger (not the “syschg” version) by using the nohup com-
mand – which ensured that the trigger will keep running even though the executor is
no longer logged in;
■
Deleted the shell script mentioned above that killed the trigger; and
■
Deleted a ﬁle called “ll_list,” which is a ﬁle very similar to the list of target 
computers.
There was a third scan, basically identical to the previous one, that was scheduled
to execute March 1, 2002.
When Duriono’s house was searched, they found several copies of the source
code named “wait_tst.c”, which corresponded to the trigger program. One copy
found during the search was a printout left on his bedroom dresser. Backups recov-
ered from his home contained copies and recorded history of the root user accessing
and compiling this ﬁle. When analysis of histories took place it is interesting to point
out that:
By searching the 111 user’s command history ﬁles from the
November 2001 and December 2001 backups, it was determined
that “root” and “rduronio” were the only users to access this direc-
tory and that when accessed as “root” or as “rduronio,” the same
“walk and talk” was used.
As an example, in December,“root” typed:
cd /y2k*/y2k*
tail –f nohup.out
ps –ef | grep scan
In January,“rduronio” typed:
ps –ef | grep scan
cd /y2k*/y2k*
ls
ls –al nohup*
tail –f nohup.out
su –
Both behaviors (commands and the syntax used) are very similar.
It is calculated that this attack cost USB PaineWebber $3,228,692 (including
forensics analysis).This is an ongoing case. Duronio is charged with one count of
securities fraud and one count of computer fraud, each of which can bring him up
to10 years in prison, and combined the ﬁnes can be as high as $1.25 million.

Analysis
If Duronio is found guilty, this case will illustrate a clever attempt at proﬁting from
an intentional act of sabotage. It also further enforces the argument that there are
visible warning signs of employees that are at the point of sabotage. Court records
indicate that Duronio was not happy in his position and frequently complained
about his compensation.
Because records point to “root” as the user responsible for most of the damage,
this case also highlights the problem that can occur when several employees are
allowed to share the same administrator account.When one acts in a malicious
manner, it is difﬁcult to determine (and prove in court) exactly who is responsible.
Consider using better authentication by not allowing root to log in directly. Force
administrators to log in using their name, and “su” to root level access.To maintain
proper records, conﬁgure syslog for remote logging.Additionally, privileged non-root
accounts can be made to help segregate activities from one administrator to the next.

Details
John Rusnak was a foreign currency trader. He gambled on what forthcoming con-
version rates would be in other countries, particularly between the yen, euro, and
U.S. dollar. Rusnak’s career began in 1986 at Fidelity Bank in Philadelphia and then
moved to Chemical Bank in New York two years later. In the early nineties he was
looking for a change, and interviewed for a position at AllFirst Bank in Maryland.
When he told AllFirst Treasurer David Cronin that he would “consistently make
more money by running a large option book hedged in the cash markets, buying
options when they were cheap and selling them when they were expensive,”3 he was
offered a job.
When Rusnak was hired by AllFirst in 1993, the yen had been rising against the
dollar for three years solid. Rusnak believed that this trend was going to continue,
and purchased large amounts of yen for future delivery.This was essentially a bet that
the price of the yen was going to continue growing stronger against the dollar.
However, as Figure 6.1 illustrates, this was not what happened. Unfortunately for
Rusnak, the Toyko market fell after an earthquake struck Kobe on January 17, 1995.

For Rusnak, this meant trouble. Forward contracts are binding, and he had no
choice but to take the losses. By the end of 1997 he had lost $29.1 million. Rather
than immediately accounting for the large losses caused by the Asian market crisis,
he hid them. Like the other cases we will discuss in this section, Rusnak believed

that the mistakes he made were not repeatable, and that if he continued he would be
able to recover. He continuously created fake options, backed up by falsiﬁed docu-
ments to cover up these problems.
By early 1999, his supervisor, a trading manager, left the company. Because of
budget concerns, this position was never reﬁlled. Instead, Rusnak reported directly to
the treasurer.At this time his debt had nearly doubled, up to $41.5 Million.To
attempt to overcome his losses, he made larger trades using prime brokerage
accounts. He leveraged the fact that these types of contracts, historical rate rollovers
(HRRO), could be used to hide losses. Despite a previous warning by the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York:
The Foreign Exchange Committee believes that rolling contracts at
historical rates is a dangerous practice which should be avoided
absent compelling justiﬁcation and procedural safeguards. Because
of the special risks, the Committee urges dealers that continue to
accommodate customer requests for historical-rate rollovers to take
the following three steps: (i) inquire about the customer’s motiva-
tion in requesting an off-market rate trade to gauge the commer-
cial justiﬁcation; (ii) make sure that senior customer management is
aware of the transaction and the special risks involved; and (iii)
obtain the informed consent of one’s own senior management to
take on the additional risk and any effective credit extension.4
However, Rusnak was never questioned. Furthermore, despite having a Value at
Risk (VaR) of $1.5 million by the end of 1999, his losses had doubled again to $90
million. He cleverly hid his problem by manipulating this calculation. By entering
fake options, his true (losing) open forward positions looked like he was hedging
them. In addition, because he was the one that reported his VaR, he distorted the
values in the spreadsheet. Because there was no auditing or conﬁrmation of this data,
he was never challenged.
Rusnak had to worry about the stop-loss limit, though.This is a set amount that
he was allowed to lose before his trading would be frozen for the month. He ﬁgured
out that he could manipulate his check for this value by faking the currency
exchange rate that was used to calculate it. Like the other, he supplied this spread-
sheet to management himself. Unlike the other, the Treasury ofﬁce independently
conﬁrmed this value. Rusnak was savvy though; he convinced his management that
he needed current exchange rates downloaded directly to his computer from
Reuters. Because this feed cost $10,000, the bank thought they would save money
by copying the foreign exchange rates from Rusnak’s computer to any others

(including the Treasury ofﬁce responsible for auditing his calculations).This gave
Rusnak the control he needed to fraudulently validate their calculations.
NOTE
Value at Risk (VaR) is a calculation used as a metric to determine the risk associ-
ated with a trading portfolio. It is used in most any industry that holds liquid
assets such as banks, energy traders, commodity companies, and ﬁnancial ﬁrms.
The purpose is to deﬁne an acceptable loss for a particular group or individual
that guarantees their single losses will not signiﬁcantly impact the organization
as a whole.
http://www.riskglossary.com/link/value_at_risk.htm
Around the end of 2000, Rusnak’s supervisors began to notice that something
was not quite right.They cut his cash by restricting his use of the balance sheet.At
this point, though, his losses had more than doubled up to $300 million. He had to
change his strategy to try to get ahead; he sold deep-in-the-money options for more
trading cash.The premiums for these options were in the millions, yet the likelihood
that they would be exercised was extremely high. One example was an agreement
he made with Citibank in early 2001. Rusnak agreed to set the strike (that is, selling)
price of yen at 77.37 yen to the dollar.5 At the time, the true exchange rate was 116 yen
to the dollar, and as the previous ﬁgure had illustrated, the probability of this rate
occurring was highly unlikely. The value of the dollar would have essentially had to
drop almost 35% within one year.The premium for this “loan” was $125 million. He
did this at a number of other institutions, including Bank of America, Deutsche
Bank, Bank of New York, and Merrill Lynch, and he did not hide why he needed
the money from these banks. In an e-mail discovered after he was apprehended,
Rusnak wrote “I have come to you with a problem; we need to outsource our bal-
ance sheet funding.”6
In the ﬁve years Rusnak traded with losses that should have been detected, there
was only one audit.The audit staff did question one of his trades, but he was able to
outsmart their scrutiny.They asked to conﬁrm a trade that he entered. Because this
entry was fraudulent, there was no legitimate sponsor to send the conﬁrmation. He
instead went to a nearby Mail Boxes Etc. and purchased a fax account under the fake
name “David Russell.” When the auditors faxed the conﬁrmation to “David
Russell,” Rusnak had the store reply with a conﬁrmation.
In December 2001, Rusnak’s supervisors began to get concerned. When
Treasurer David Cronin saw that the balance sheet for January 2002 was $50 million
www.syngress.com
252
Chapter 6 • Banking and Financial Sector
341_INS_THR_06.qxd  11/21/05  12:01 PM  Page 252

higher than he had approved, and that the foreign exchange trading volume had
been $25 billion, he temporarily froze Rusnak’s authorization to trade. Rusnak was
asked to prove authenticity for several of the trades, and once again he produced
fraudulent conﬁrmations.This time, however, his supervisors were suspicious.They
questioned him, and he lost his temper, saying,“I’m the guy who makes money
around here.”7 This was Friday, February 1, 2002. Once he regained composure fol-
lowing a walk, he said he would call them on Sunday with the phone number of
someone that could conﬁrm the trades.8 However, this never happened and he never
showed up for work on Monday. Instead he consulted a lawyer and turned himself
in to the FBI. Rusnak pled guilty to bank fraud and was sentenced to 90 months in
prison, ﬁve years of supervised release, and $691 million in restitution.
Analysis
Like other rogue traders, the prime motivation is to continually, almost compulsively,
try to “dig out” of the hole. Former U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, Eugene
Ludwig, was commissioned by the AIB board of directors to independently investi-
gate what went wrong in this case. He reported that Rusnak had taken advantage of
the “weak control environment” and his trades “did not receive the careful scrutiny
that they deserved.”9
Although it is clear that Rusnak did not embezzle the money,Table 6.1 illus-
trates that he was paid large bonuses, which were based on the “perceived” proﬁts he
was reporting.

One of the “lessons learned” from this case is that basing compensation so heavily on
proﬁts of an individual may not be a good choice as a method of reward.This can
encourage risk taking beyond healthy levels. In addition, Rusnak worked alone.

There was no one else that would have the opportunity to observe ﬁrst hand what
was happening. Even the required “vacation” period, which would have provided
insight into his behavior, was overlooked.As the Ludwig Report describes:
It is for good reason that banks in the United States are required to
have a guideline that bars traders from trading two weeks per year.
Having a second employee take over for even the most trusted
bank employee is a mechanism for uncovering fraud. Although Mr.
Rusnak did take vacations, the efﬁcacy of the two-week rule was
vitiated because Mr. Rusnak was allowed to continue trading from
his computer.
Audits need to be truly independent. Staff should do due diligence on the points
of contact provided for conﬁrmations.This lesson applies throughout all organiza-
tions.As an example, if you are provided the name and number of a reference for a
potential employee, the recommendation by the reference is only as good as their
authenticity.

Details
This case brought down the oldest standing British merchant bank. Despite sur-
viving 232 years of trading, which included signiﬁcant ﬁnancing of the Napoleonic
wars, French reparations after Waterloo, ﬁnancing of the Louisiana Purchase, and
Argentine railway bonds that went awry, Barings Bank could not survive Nick
Leeson.
Nick Leeson started his working career as a clerk at Coutts & Co. Bank in 1985.
Shortly thereafter he moved to Morgan Stanley and learned how trades were con-
ducted. Barings offered him a job in 1989 as a clerk, but three years later he was
offered an even better position in the ﬁrm’s Singapore ofﬁce.Almost immediately
afterward he passed his exam and qualiﬁed to trade on the Singapore International
Monetary Exchange (SIMEX). By the end of this year (1992), he already had
secretly lost £2 million. One year later it was £13 million. By 1994, Leeson had
accumulated £185 million in hidden losses.
Leeson used a trading called “straddle,” which generally produces a proﬁt when
the markets are stable. However, because of an accounting error caused by the mis-
matched exchange rates, he lost 20,000 pounds of sterling. He created a computer
record named “Account 88888” that he used to hide/write-off his initial loss. Leeson
thought that he would be able to make up for this small loss with unauthorized
trades. Unfortunately for him, like Rusnak he was burned by the fall of the yen in
1995. His losses quickly increased to about £742 million.
On February 26, 1996, he disappeared with his family. Leeson was caught and
arrested in Frankfurt and was sentenced to six and one-half years in prison. (Note:
Nick Leeson developed cancer while in prison, and was released for medical 
treatment.)

History of Barings Bank
Barings Brothers & Co. banking company was established in 1762 by Sir Francis
Baring. It was this bank that helped to ﬁnance the Louisiana Purchase in 1802, at
the same time that it ﬁnanced Napoleon’s war effort against France. Barings had
problems after the Brazilian revolution and was rescued by a consortium
including the governor of the Bank of England. While this near bankruptcy sig-
niﬁcantly impacted the equity and strength of the company, it pushed forward.

A close tie with the British monarchy was formed with King George V, and unlike
many banks, Barings survived the great Depression. What Barings did not survive
was Nick Leeson, whose rogue trading cost the company $1.4 billion that it did
not have. The bank collapsed on February 26, 1995, and was purchased by the
Dutch bank ING who paid only one pound. In March 2005 this portion of ING
named Baring Asset management was sold to Mass Mutual and Northern Trust.

Analysis
This case is nearly identical to the previous one.A high-risk trader was in a position
that enabled him to compromise the checks-and-balances oversight of the back
ofﬁce. Because of this, many analysts are quick to point out that Barings too failed,
and that Leeson is not the only person at blame.
Besides a basic lack of auditing and accountability, top Barings managers demon-
strated that they did not have a ﬁrm grasp (or did not care) of the type and level of
risk that Leeson was taking.Analysis shows that the proﬁts he was reporting were
too high for what was possible. Instead of taking these reports as warnings, the man-
ager rewarded Leeson.The old line that if it looks too good to be true, it probably is,
holds accurate in this case.The same shows for each of these rogue traders.
Unbelievably high proﬁts were reported.At one point in time each of the traders
was viewed as the “golden boy” of the organization. It should be a lesson that even
when things appear to be better than possible on the surface, they should be audited
and their accuracy conﬁrmed.
Another fault in this case was that Leeson did not have one single line of
reporting. He reported to a supervisor in London when it came to his proprietary
trading, and then to yet another ofﬁce in Tokyo for trading requested by customers.
By not having one single person or entity that looked over his activities, he could
hide his activities.
NOTE
According to www.trading-glossary.com, Back Ofﬁce refers to:
Brokerage House clerical operations that support, but do not include, the
trading of stocks and other securities. All written conﬁrmation and settlement
of trades, record keeping, and regulatory compliance happen in the back ofﬁce.

Case Study: Daiwa Bank 
Loses $1.1 Billion to Rogue Trading
The rogue trader in this case study lost $1.1 billion for Daiwa Bank, nearly as much
as Nick Leeson did for Barings. Unlike Barings, Daiwa Bank was able to remain in
business despite the signiﬁcant losses. In addition, unlike previous cases, senior man-
agers were held accountable for these losses.

Toshihide Iguchi
Case Number: 1:95-cr-00914-LAK-1
Details
Toshihide Iguchi was a Japan-born U.S. citizen who lived in New York.After col-
lege, in 1977, he joined the Daiwas New York branch. With an academic back-
ground in psychology from Southwest Missouri State University,10 Iguchi was started
in securities for the back ofﬁce of the branch. Business for the branch greatly
increased in the mid-1980s. Partially because of this growth, Iguchi was promoted to
be a trader in 1984.
Like many of the other rogue trading cases, management made a critical mistake
when promoting Iguchi. His back ofﬁce position was never reﬁlled, so he was able
to trade and continue his previous responsibilities.This put him in the very dan-
gerous position of making trades and being the person responsible for auditing them.
For obvious reasons, this practice is not recommended.
Shortly after Iguchi was promoted to trader, he had lost several hundred thou-
sand dollars from his activities. He tried to cover up his losses by selling U.S.Treasury
bonds that were purchased on behalf of customers in a sub-custody account at
Bankers Trust. By virtue of his back ofﬁce responsibilities, Iguchi was responsible for
keeping track of this account.To further conceal that the securities had been sold, he
falsiﬁed Bankers Trust account statements.
This continued for 11 years with compounding losses that were continuously
concealed by more than 30,000 forged trading slips.The losses grew increasingly
www.syngress.com
Banking and Financial Sector • Chapter 6

341_INS_THR_06.qxd  11/21/05  12:01 PM  Page 257

large when customers began requesting to sell some of their securities. Iguchi had
already sold them, and these customers were owed accumulated interest that had
never actually been earned.To pay this interest, Iguchi sold additional securities, con-
tinuing a loss situation that was impossible to overcome. He had lost approximately
$377 million in customer securities and $733 million of Daiwas’ own investment
securities.
On July 13, Iguchi wrote a 30-page confession letter to Daiwa. In this letter, and
others that followed by Iguchi, he suggested that supervisors had assisted him with
the cover-up of losses. In the early fall (September 18), Daiwa reported the problem
to the Federal Reserve Board. Because of this delay, the United States government
ﬁled a multiple-count indictment and complaint against Daiwa Bank.11 In particular,
one of the issues was that on or about July 31, 1995:
The New York Branch submitted to the Federal Reserve Board a
quarterly, “Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and
Agencies of Foreign Banks” for the period ending June 30, 1995.
This report falsely stated that the assets of the New York Branch
included $615,987,000 of “trading assets,” a number that included
approximately $600 million of short-term United States Treasury
obligations that Iguchi had sold and therefore were missing from
the Bankers Trust account.
Unlike Barings Bank, Daiwa Bank had over $200 billion in assets and $8 billion
of reserves that enabled them to ﬁnancially survive these losses. However, their repu-
tation was signiﬁcantly damaged.Their entire business strategy of moving into inter-
national markets was lost, and they refocused their future business in Japan and
Southeast Asia. In addition, following legal action by shareholders, a Japanese court
punished board members and executives that had failed to provide appropriate over-
sight, and in some cases attempted to cover-up the problem.These senior managers
were collectively required to pay $775 million in damages.12
Iguchi was sentenced to four years in prison, ﬁve years parole, and $2.6 million
restitution. While Iguchi was in prison, he was interviewed by Time magazine. He
made an interesting comment when he was asked, “When this started, did it seem
like a crime?”
To me, it was only a violation of internal rules. I think all traders
have a tendency to fall into the same trap. You always have a way
of recovering the loss. As long as that possibility is there, you either
admit your loss and lose face and your job, or you wait a little — a
month or two months or however long it takes. No one ever goes
into the market thinking he is going to lose money.13

Analysis
In any industry, risk is necessary. However, those that take the risks should not have
the opportunity to cover them up.Again in this case we see the important lesson
learned that risk-taking must be kept separate from record keeping.This goes in
almost any environment and is not restricted to the ﬁnancial sector. Sales numbers
and the “health” of organizations must be analyzed and conﬁrmed outside of those
reporting them.
With the separation, losses can still occur, but they can be detected before they
are compounded and grow to be out of control.This case is different from the
others because the managers that exercised lax control were also penalized in the
end. It was Iguchi that said he confessed because he was afraid that there was no end
to the fraud. He was never afraid of being caught because he didn’t think he was
breaking any laws; Iguchi was more afraid that he wouldn’t be caught.

Ean Wolf was an 18-year-old senior at Cherry Hill West High School in Cherry
Hill, NC. When he was not in school, he was a weekend bank teller at the local

bank and was given the position of weekend teller supervisor.This meant he had
keys to the bank and the combination of the vault.

Minutes before it was scheduled to open on Sunday, June 11, 2000, the bank was
robbed. When interviewed by investigators, Wolf admitted that he had told Quinzel
Champagne insider information about security at the bank. In addition to telling
Champagne the number and location of security cameras and number of employees,
he told him how much money was in the bank on different days.
According to court documents,Wolf took part in the actual robbery by pre-
tending to be a victim. He said that the day was orchestrated so that Champagne
approached him in the parking lot wearing a ski mask and carrying a gun.Wolf acted
as if he was “forced” into the bank through a back door by Champagne. Once inside,
Champagne instructed everyone into the vault and “ordered”Wolf to assist him in
gathering the money.When he left, he had taken approximately $308,815 in cash.
Wolf admitted that Champagne agreed to pay him $35,000 for his part in the
orchestrated robbery.
Analysis
The point of this story is to remind you not to overlook the obvious threats. In this
day and age it is easy to throw money at technological solutions for prevention, but
in reality it is the person that is the weakest link. Perhaps a background check could
have exposed a questionable history, or perhaps pre-employment screening could
have demonstrated that he was not mature enough for the responsibility, or that he
had ﬁnancial obligations beyond his means. Just because you purchase security cam-
eras and a vault does not mean you are safe.

Philip Cummings
Case Number: 1:03-cr-00109-GBD-1
Details
Philip Cumming was an employee of New York–based Teledata Communications
Inc (TCI).As the TCI Web site (www.tcicredit.com/) explains,“Companies all
around the country rely on our products for efﬁcient and affordable access to credit
bureaus, and as links to public records.TCI saves our customers countless hours by
automating the process for conducting background checks, employment screenings,
tenant screenings, and more.”The company essentially provides computerized access
for banks and other organizations to check the credit histories of individuals quickly.
TCI has access to three of the biggest credit history bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and
TransUnion.
Cummings was a help desk employee at TCI and had access to conﬁdential pass-
words and secret codes needed to access credit reports from these bureaus. In his
short time in this position (mid-1999 through March 2000), he participated in what
authorities believe is the largest identity theft case in U.S. History.A co-conspirator,
Linus Baptiste, dealt with at least 20 different people in New York who would then
go on to request credit reports for speciﬁc individuals. Cummings downloaded their
credit reports and supplied them to the co-conspirator who sold them for $60.
Baptiste split this proﬁt with Cummings.
When Cummings moved to Georgia in early 2000, he kept the scam alive by
periodically traveling to New York to download the requested credit reports.
Eventually, Cummings provided Baptiste with a laptop that had been set up with the
proper software, passwords, and codes. With this laptop, the co-conspirator was able
to directly retrieve records from Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.As passwords
and codes changed, Cummings provided updated versions so that the theft could
continue.
In addition to the cost associated with fraudulent charges and identify theft of
the individual victims, the entities whose passwords and codes were used also suf-
fered losses.These organizations were billed for each credit record that was retrieved
using their password.As an example, the Ford Motor Credit Corp. in Grand Rapids,
Michigan, noticed their bill included approximately 15,000 records that were falsely
retrieved in a 10-month period using their subscriber code.Thousands of other
fraudulent charges were billed to other organizations, such as Washington Mutual

Bank, Washington Mutual Finance Company, Dollar Bank, Sarah Bush Lincoln
Health Center, Personal Finance Company, Medical Bureau in Clearwater, Vintage
Apartments, Community Bank of Chaska, and Central Texas Energy.
Court records site more than 30,000 victims in the case with a conﬁrmed loss at
more than $2.7 million. Many of the individual victims had the money in their bank
accounts fraudulently withdrawn, had the addresses of their bank account changed
without authorization, and found illegitimate charges on their credit cards.
Additional participants in the theft ring such as Eniete Ukpong would purchase
expensive merchandise using the stolen credit card information, and then resell them
to others such as Ahmet Ulutas.
In the indictment, James Comey, the United States Attorney for the Southern
District of New York, said:
With a few keystrokes, these men essentially picked the pockets of
tens of thousands of Americans and, in the process, took their
identities, stole their money, and swiped their security. These
charges and the potential penalties underscore the severity of the
crimes. We will pursue and prosecute with equal vigor who may be
involved.
On September 14, 2004, Cummings pled guilty to: (1.) Conspiracy to Defraud
the United States, (2.) Fraud by Wire, and (3.) Fraud with Identiﬁcation Documents.
He faces a sentencing of 5 years in prison on count one, 14 years in prison on the
second count, 14 years on the third count, and 3 years of supervised release.The
prison terms are to be served concurrently with each other. In addition, he was sen-
tenced to $15,386,673 in restitution.
Analysis
When interviewed about the case, Linda Foley, the executive director of Identity
Theft Resource Center in San Diego, said:15
How much screening did (Cummings) go through before being
hired for the help desk?... This situation was a problem waiting to
happen.
However, when the TCI president and co-founder realized one of his past
employees was a participant in this theft ring, he replied,“We were devastated; we do
background screening, checking of people, but it’s very hard to stop when you’ve
got someone who’s a bad apple.”16 Instead, the company has changed the way their
business is done.The help desk employees no longer have access to the subscriber
passwords — the subscribers must interface directly with the credit-reporting agen-

Your Computer Might Be the Insider
Nearly every case in this book is about an insider, a person that has chosen to take
actions that negatively impact their company or organization. However, the
insider might actually be your computer. Deceptive spyware or malware can
secretly send your most trusted secrets across the Internet. While this software is
often used in connection with insiders that install it secretly, it can be you that
mistakenly downloads a program and causes the damage. One of the more
recent cases illustrating this is the attempted heist of the London branch of the
Japanese Sumitomo Bank in March 2005. Although police have not determined
if someone on the inside installed the malicious software, they did determine
that keystroke logging software was installed and used to gather the information
needed to try to steal from the bank. This particular attempt was orchestrated in
a sophisticated manner. Passwords and login information was acquired and used
to try to transfer money to ten bank accounts all around the world. Luckily, these
fraudulent transactions were detected before they were successful and the bank
did not suffer any losses.

In New Jersey, eight employees or ex-employees of major banks have been arrested
in connection with a theft ring that allegedly produced $2 million in fraudulent
costs.17 According to Captain Frank Lomia, head of Hackensack, New Jersey police
detectives, the personal data of at least 675,000 customers was stolen. It is alleged
that it was Orazio Lembo, who operated a collection agency named DRL Associates
that paid the bank employees for the information.This acquired information was
combined with workplace information from another participant who was a labor
department employee, and together was resold to numerous law ﬁrms at collection
agencies. Luckily it does not appear as if this information was used to defraud the
victims ﬁnancially like the other cases.
Analysis
Story after story, each of these cases is the same.An employee used his or her access
to acquire identity information that they used in a fraudulent manner.The informa-
tion was either used to open up accounts or to misuse funds by the employees
themselves, or the information was sold to others that conducted the identity theft.
This is a serious problem that increases with each database that gets populated with
this information.
Technological means can be used to assist in the prevention of this problem with
the institution of auditing software that reports a list of accessed accounts to a super-
visor. In addition, means such as encryption and copy-protection can help ensure
that information cannot be easily transmitted onto removable media and walked out
of the building.

Case Study: Finnish Bank 
Wireless Hacker Suspected To Be An Insider
The Helsinki branch of GE Money was “robbed” across a wireless network in a local
neighborhood. Luckily, the wire transfers raised suspicion and the funds were secured
before any money was lost.The most devastating aspect is that the prime suspect in
the robbery is the head of data security—an insider.
Topic
Helsinki GE Money head of data security is suspected of malicious insider activity
that leads to the attempted theft of €200,000 ($245,000).
Details
The former head of data security at the Helsinki branch of GE Money
(www.gemoney.ﬁ) was arrested for allegedly stealing €200,000 ($245,000) from his
company.18 He allegedly copied software and passwords from the bank onto a laptop
that belonged to the company. With two others, he purportedly used the unsecured
wireless access from a neighbor to access the network without any attribution, and
illegally transfer money from the bank.

work that had committed the crime. However, a search of his apartment led to

analysis of logs for the access point.These logs had recorded the MAC address for a
computer that was registered to GE Money, and then this laptop was allegedly con-
nected to the security ofﬁcer. Jukkapekka Risu, the Helsinki police ofﬁcer investi-
gating the case, said,“After a while, there were too many leads pointing against him,
and after we found the laptop, that was it.”19
This investigation is ongoing and although the security ofﬁcer has not yet been
charged, he has been dismissed from his position.According to the Helsingin
Sanomat,20 the data security chief confessed during interrogation and said that an
accomplice with a criminal background had forced him into the crime.According to
reports, the accomplice threatened his family and forced him to bring the laptop to a
video store a few days before the event.The reported accomplice denies involve-
ment. Pekka Pattiniemi, general manager for GE Money in Finland, said,“I can con-
ﬁrm that our local security ofﬁcer was involved.”21 The transaction was immediately
considered to be suspicious, and all of the stolen money was recovered.
A fourth suspect was later arrested after he attempted to withdraw €5,000
($6,110) from the account.
Analysis
When questions about prevention were asked, Helsinki police ofﬁcer Risu said, “I
suppose they could make their recruitment process more airtight.”22 It is not yet
known if the suspect in this case had a prior criminal record. While this case has just
started, and there are not any charges yet, the person suspected of the crime report-
edly used a company laptop loaded with the necessary software and passwords. Strict
regulations should be instituted on how enabling technology should be used (that is,
perhaps the laptop should never have been allowed to leave the building, or perhaps
audit logs could have immediately ﬂagged the MAC address when it appeared on
the network trying to illegally transfer the funds).
Legal Regulations
Suddenly instances of identify theft caused by mistakes within companies have
appeared on the radar.The question is: are these events something new, or is the
practice of public disclosure new? You be the judge.
Federal Laws
Here are some recently passed, and recently proposed, federal laws related to identify
theft and required notiﬁcation.

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act 
(Financial Services Modernization Act)
www.ftc.gov/privacy/glbact/glbsub1.htm
This act is primarily focused on setting guidelines for how organizations should
handle sensitive conﬁdential identify information.An example of one subsection of
the act follows:
(b) Financial institutions safeguards
In furtherance of the policy in subsection (a) of this section, each
agency or authority described in section 6805(a) of this title shall
establish appropriate standards for the ﬁnancial institutions subject
to their jurisdiction relating to administrative, technical, and phys-
ical safeguards—
(1) to insure the security and conﬁdentiality of customer records
and information;
(2) to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the
security or integrity of such records; and
(3) to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records
or information which could result in substantial harm or inconve-
nience to any customer.
It is generally aimed at ensuring that ﬁnancial institutions do not disclose iden-
tity information to third parties.
Health Insurance Portability 
and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
www.cms.hhs.gov/hipaa/
HIPAA is a broad act that amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. It includes
provisions to provide portability and continuity of health insurance coverage to
people that change employment. In addition, and more relative to this book, it
includes regulations to combat fraud from identity theft.
(2) SAFEGUARDS—Each person described in section 1172(a) who
maintains or transmits health information shall maintain reasonable

and appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safe-
guards—
(A) to ensure the integrity and conﬁdentiality of the information;
(B) to protect against any reasonably anticipated—
(i) threats or hazards to the security or integrity of the information;
and
(ii) unauthorized uses or disclosures of the information; and
(C) otherwise to ensure compliance with this part by the ofﬁcers
and employees of such person.
State Laws
In this section we brieﬂy describe the California Notice of Security Breach Law.
California Notice of Security Breach Law
www.privacy.ca.gov/code/cc1798.291798.82.htm
A quote by Joanne McNabb, chief of California’s Ofﬁce of Privacy Protection, gives
the best description of how the California Notice of Security Breach Law impacts
citizens:“It was because of (our) notiﬁcation law that anyone knew about the
ChoicePoint breech.They wouldn’t necessarily have been telling anybody.”23
California has led the way in the ﬁrst (and only, at the time of this book) state law
that requires organizations to notify citizens when their conﬁdential identity infor-
mation has been compromised. Nearly 30 other states have proposed similar legisla-
tion, using California as the model.
Proposed Federal Laws
In this section we describe proposed federal laws related to identify theft and
required notiﬁcation.
Schumer-Nelson ID Theft Bill

341_INS_THR_06.qxd  11/21/05  12:01 PM  Page 271

U.S. Senators Charles Schumer (New York) and Bill Nelson (Florida) have intro-
duced a bill that they believe will help prevent identify theft, better empower the
Federal Trade Commission to oversee organizations, and mandate more disclosure
requirements when compromises do occur. Schumer said his motivation for the bill
is,“What bank robbery was to the Depression Age, identity theft is to the
Information Age. Identity theft has become so pervasive and out of hand, that we
must make a real effort to prevent it before it happens. When a company like Lexis-
Nexis so badly underestimates its own ID theft breaches, it is clear that things are
totally out of hand.”24
Some of the provisions are directly related to the handling of Social Security
numbers and include provisions such as one that prohibits them from being dis-
played on employee IDs and bans the purchase and sale of Social Security numbers
by non–law enforcement entities.
Notiﬁcation of Risk to Personal Data Bill
http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c109:S.751:
On April 11, 2005, Diane Feinstein (California) introduced this bill which basically
intends to provide the same protection as the California Notice of Security Breech
Law nationwide.An example of requirements following a breach of database security
is below:
(a) Disclosure of Security Breach—
(1) IN GENERAL—Any agency, or person engaged in interstate
commerce, that owns, licenses, or collects data, whether or not
held in electronic form, containing personal information shall, fol-
lowing the discovery of a breach of security of the system main-
tained by the agency or person that contains such data, or upon
receipt of notice under paragraph (2), notify any individual of the
United States whose personal information was, or is reasonably
believed to have been, acquired by an unauthorized person.

Summary
Activities of ﬁnancial sector insiders are similar to those observed in previous chap-
ters.They conduct sabotage, steal proprietary information, embezzle money, and
unlike other cases we studied, they cause damage by taking undue risks and covering
them up. Repeatedly, the lessons learned call for auditing and outside accountability.
This is true in all cases, but is especially necessary for employees whose jobs require
high levels of risk.
This chapter also highlighted the threat of identity theft and what institutions
can do to help prevent insiders from participating in fraud rings. It also points out
the beneﬁt of legislation such as the California Notice of Security Breach Law that
protects citizens by forcing organizations that have incidents to expose them to the
victims.

“If I commit esponage [sic] I will be putting my self and family at
great risk. If I am caught I will be enprisioned [sic] for the rest of
my life, if not executed for this deed.”
— Brian Regan in a letter to Saddam Hussein where he demanded
$13 million for the classiﬁed information he offered
“The insider threat is inherent in society’s strive toward ﬁnding
better, faster, cheaper, and simpler ways to pass information,
accomplish business objectives, and survive in a fast-paced instant
and impatient society.”
— Valerie L. Caruso, USAF, Master’s Thesis titled, “Outsourcing
Information Technology and the Insider Threat”
Introduction
Statistics show that employees of government contractors are responsible for roughly
24% of espionage cases.1 However, preventing and detecting insider threat here is
perhaps more difﬁcult than any other environment, and for this reason we suspect
the number of undiscovered cases in this area is signiﬁcantly large. Government con-
tracting brings a mix of complicating characteristics that greatly compound the
chance that insiders will be successful at their activity without detection. Generally it
is the very characteristics that make contractors appealing to the government that
leaves them vulnerable to this threat:
■
Same work, less money Government contractors often have to accom-
plish the same type of activities as the government, but without the seem-
ingly unending federal resources to do it.This means that in the end,
whereas the government may accomplish a speciﬁc task to the extent nec-
essary, with burdening levels of oversight and bureaucracy, a company must
always be mindful of the bottom line ﬁnancially. Levels of security and
auditing are only applied to the extent that the activity remains proﬁtable
and within budget.
■
Faster, more agile, and less bureaucracy  When compared to the gov-
ernment, contractors make decisions and take actions faster with less
bureaucracy.Almost always this is a positive statement, but on the few occa-
sions that the person making the decisions is a malicious insider, the results
can be catastrophic because there is no oversight.

Chapter 7 • Government Subcontractors
341_INS_THR_07.qxd  11/20/05  2:57 PM  Page 276

■
Experienced and proven employees  Often defense contractors hire
retirees that have had “proven” careers within the government.To the com-
pany, this is a great move because it makes their solutions more operational
and realistic to the true needs of the government, and to the customer
these employees come with their own bona ﬁdes and do not need to be
“vetted” like unseasoned employees from other backgrounds.This trust can
be a mistake if the insider’s credentials do not match their intentions.
■
“In-ofﬁce” services support  Unlike companies that sell commercial
“products,” many government contractors provide “people” time instead.
These contracts are generally referred to as SETA (Scientiﬁc Engineering
and Technical Assistance) and the contractor physically reports to the spon-
soring government organization’s ofﬁce space.This can be most efﬁcient for
the government, because the person is available to continuously provide
solutions, but it also means that the chain of command and auditing by the
company becomes less clear. While there are many regulations that govern
who the contractor can ofﬁcially take orders from on a daily basis, more
often than not that person’s supervisor is a program manager that does not
reside in the same space, and is not aware on a day-to-day basis of the
person’s activities.This leaves room for error and lack of oversight on what
the person is doing, and roughly resembles the lack of clear back ofﬁce
auditing in the previous chapter on rogue traders.
Threats
The threats faced by government contractors are the same for any company, but
with the complication that they also face the same threats faced by the government
organizations their employees are detailed to. Employees of government contractors
have the capability both to sabotage their company’s systems and to sabotage the sys-
tems of the government organization that is sponsoring them. In addition, because in
the end contractors are proﬁt-driven companies, they are always searching for less
expensive ways to accomplish the same task. In one of the cases we will talk about in
this chapter, a large prime contractor subcontracted out to a company that brought
employees from mainland China to Dayton, Ohio, for a job. Most of these
employees were only paid $500 a month, a fraction of what a programmer from the
United States would have cost.This trend to outsource information technology
needs is not new, but it is an increasing trend that is analyzed in depth in a master’s
thesis titled,“Outsourcing Information Technology and the Insider Threat.”2

Stay Alert at Trade Shows
In Chapter 5: Commercial, we highlighted the need to be mindful of accidental
disclosure at trade shows. For government contractors, the threat is two-fold: 1)
Government contractors need to guard trade secrets like any other company, and
2) Governments do not attend trade shows, but government contractors do. This
means that people may try to get to government secrets through you.
There are countless reports of incidents involving overzealous foreign
nationals approaching contractors at these shows (I just experienced one last
month.) An excellent detailed account of one such incident is found in the Ofﬁce
of National Counterintelligence Executive Archives from September 2001. This
story describes a contractor attending a booth at the American Institute of
Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) and Ballistic Missile Defense Organization
(BMDO) Technology Conference and Exhibit July 23-26, 2001, in Virginia.3
All attendees of the conference were required to have a security clearance
of at least Secret level. Outside of the classiﬁed conference, unclassiﬁed (but sen-
sitive) booths were set up in the exhibit hall for attendees of the conference. In
this case, the contractor was manning the booth for his company when a man
walked up and began taking copies of the hand-outs available for the attendees.
The attendee of the booth could see that the man did not have a badge. When
he was questioned by the contractor, he explained that he was part of the press
and was allowed to be there without a badge. The contractor then asked what
media organization he was afﬁliated with, and he replied, “Beijing Daily News.”
The contractor asked to view his invitation to the conference, and when he could
not provide one he took the documents from the man’s hand and walked him to
the security desk. Details of the incident were later turned over to the FBI and the
902nd Military Intelligence Group. They later determined that the man had come
in through a back entrance near the kitchen and was a Chinese national “known
to target U.S. technical information.”4
Case Study: Trusted Air Force 
Master Sergeant Retires and Joins TRW
This is a case of an employee that is treated in an overly trusted manner because of
his background and past access to classiﬁed information. Luckily, it appears as if all
the detection and warning systems in place detected his behavior prior to signiﬁcant

Brian Regan
Case Number: 1:01-CR-00405-GBL-1
Details
Brian Patrick Regan was a patriot. When he turned 18 he enlisted in the United
States Air Force (USAF) and served in it continuously until he retired as an E-7
(Master Sergeant) twenty years later.As part of his enlistment, Regan took the fol-
lowing oath of ofﬁce:
I … do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the
Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and
domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and
that I will obey the orders of the President of the United States and
the orders of the ofﬁcers appointed over me, according to regula-
tions and the Uniform Code of Military Justice. So help me God.
While in the USAF, he specialized in the ﬁeld of signals intelligence analysis and
had tours of duty that included:
■
1991–1994:As a Communications Denial Analyst and an Air Defense
Analyst at USAF Intelligence Support Group at the Pentagon
■
1994–1995:As a student at Joint Military Intelligence College
■
1995–2000:Assigned to the Signals Intelligence Applications Integration
Ofﬁce at the Headquarters of the National Reconnaissance Ofﬁce (NRO)
While in these intelligence-related positions, Regan was exposed to extremely
sensitive compartmented programs and on or about November 25, 1991, he signed a
Classiﬁed Information Nondisclosure Agreement that included the following text:

2. I hereby acknowledge that I have received a
security indoctrination concerning the nature and
protection of classiﬁed information, including the
procedures to be followed in ascertaining whether
other persons to whom I contemplate disclosing
this information have been approved for access to
it, and that I understand these procedures.
3. I have been advised that the unauthorized dis-
closure, unauthorized retention, or negligent
handing of classiﬁed information by me could cause
damage or irreparable injury to the United States
or could be used to advantage by a foreign nation.
I hereby agree that I will never divulge classiﬁed
information to anyone unless: (a) I have ofﬁcially
veriﬁed that the recipient has been properly
authorized by the United States Government to
receive it; or (b) I have been given prior written
notice of authorization from the United States
Government Department or Agency … responsible for
the classiﬁcation of the information or last
granting me a security clearance that such disclo-
sure is permitted. I understand that if I am
uncertain about the classiﬁcation status of infor-
mation, I am required to conﬁrm from an authorized
ofﬁcial that the information is unclassiﬁed before
I may disclose it, except to a person as provided
in (a) or (b), above. I further understand that I
am obligated to comply with laws and regulations
that prohibit unauthorized disclosure of classiﬁed
information.
For Regan, it was the tour at NRO that changed the direction of his career.
While in the USAF he learned about the NRO and had access to signiﬁcant
amounts of sensitive classiﬁed information.According to the charging documents, he
worked in a group that was responsible for “focusing signals intelligence support for
tactically deployed military units.” When he retired, he became employed by defense
contractor TRW and continued being assigned to NRO.

Despite his repeated oaths and signed agreements, somewhere between 1999 and
2001 Regan wrote a letter to Saddam Hussein, the President of Iraq, or the intelli-
gence chief of Iraq, sealed it in an envelope, and prepared it for Iraqi intelligence
agents. He also included a second letter that contained instructions for the Iraqi
agents. Excerpts of the original letters follow (note that both letters contain uncor-
rected spelling errors).
The “instructions” letter from Regan to the Iraqi agents:
This letter is conﬁdential and directed to your
president, ( ) or intelligence chief, ( ). Please
pass this letter via diplomatic pouch and do not
discuss the existence of this letter either in
your ofﬁces or homes or via any electronic means
(phone, telex, fax,). If you do not follow these
instructions the existence of this letter and its
contents may be detected and collected by U.S.
intelligence agencies. Do not open the internal
letter prior to it reaching the intended recipi-
ents, if you do and the contents are compromise
you will have to answer to your president as to
why you were so curious.
The second letter to Hussein contained the following instructions:
This letter (AA12194107) has been encoded to pre-
vent the comprising of the information it con-
tains. The codes to decode this letter were sent
to the following address listed below prior to
sending this letter. That letter had similar
instructions on how to handle the sealed letter it
contains. If the break out codes are not delivered
let me know by placing the ad listed below in the
Sunday Washington post (automobile classiﬁed sec-
tion). If I see that ad I will resend the codes
either to the same address or a new one. Please
secure both of these letters and limit access to
only essential personnel. Should the contents of
these letters be comprised to any foreign intelli-

At the same time Regan produced an almost identical letter delivered to Libyan
agents for delivery to Muammar Qadhaﬁ. For Qadhaﬁ, Regan offered to sell a docu-
ment named “Libyan Capability Study, Libyan Air Defense” as well as sensitive satel-
lite, early-warning systems, and communications information. Court records indicate
that on or about Wednesday, June 13, 2001, Regan used a computer at the Crofton
Public Library in Crofton, Maryland, and conducted the following searches on the
Internet:
“Embassies of the Arab World”
“Embassies: Laos thru Luxembourg Embassy Resource”
“Foreign Embassies in Paris”
“Foreign Embassies in Switzerland”
“Libyian Embassies and Consulates of Libya @ Embassy World”
“People’s Bureau of the Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya”
From these searches he accessed a Web site that had the addresses and phone
numbers of Embassies for Iraq, Libya, and other Arab countries located in
Washington, DC.Then on or about Sunday June 24, 2001, he returned to the same
library and conducted the following Internet searches:
■
Iraqi embassy”
■
Iraqi embassy swiss”
■
“Embassies in Switzerland”
■
“Foreign Embassies in france”
■
“Foreign Embassies in germany”
■
“Foreign Embassies in germany of iraq”
■
“Foreign Embassies in germany of libya”
■
“Swiss hostels”
Two days later (June 26, 2001) he boarded a Lufthansa Airlines plane at Dulles
International Airport and ﬂew to Germany. He ﬂew back on July 3, 2001. His suit-
case contained glue and packing table.

NOTE
Intelink is a large, classiﬁed network used to share information among different
Intelligence organizations that is modeled after the Internet.
A demonstration of the interface for the network is at: http://www.topse-
cretnet.com/intelink/. More about the network’s creation can be found in the
book, “Top Secret Intranet: How U.S. Intelligence Built Intelink – the World’s
Largest, Most Secure Network,” by Fredrick Thomas Martin.
On July 30, 2001, Regan began working in the NRO facility in Virginia for
TRW. He was ﬁrst required to take part in several months of NRO computer-based
training. On August 1, 2001, at approximately 8:00 A.M., he reported to his NRO-
assigned computer system to being his training of the day. Despite being outside of
his ofﬁcial duties, forty minutes into his training session, Regan accessed the classi-
ﬁed system named Intelink.According to court records he “opened and viewed sev-
eral Intelink ﬁles containing classiﬁed information relating to a particular Libyan
missile test range.” Just days after this, on August 2, 2001, he applied for a temporary
duty position located in Europe, but was rejected.Then nearly every day that he was
in his ofﬁce from August 6, 2001, to August 23, 2001, he “accessed Intelink and
viewed classiﬁed information relating to military facilities in Iraq, Iran, Libya, and the
People’s Republic of China, as well as classiﬁed documents related to current United
States intelligence-collection capabilities against those countries.”This activity was
not part of his ofﬁcial duty at TRW.
The next timeline details the days up to his arrest for attempted espionage:
■
August 11, 2001. Regan purchased a plane ticket to Zurich, Switzerland
(departing August 23 and returning on August 30, 2001); about the same
time he told his TRW supervisor that he would be vacationing with his
family in Orlando, Florida, during those dates.
■
August 15, 2001. Regan accessed classiﬁed information outside the scope of
his work from Intelink.This information included classiﬁed images (one
was of a mobile surface-to-air missile launch facility in Iraq and another
was a surface-to-surface missile facility in China).
■
August 17, 2001. Handwritten geo-coordinates and other notations from
the images viewed on August 15, 2001, were found discarded on a torn
piece of paper in the burn bag in Regan’s ofﬁce.

■
August 23, 2001. Regan accessed Intelink at approximately 8:03 a.m. and
viewed an image dated “21 August 2001.”This classiﬁed image was of the
same surface-to-surface missile facility he had viewed previously, and this
time he wrote handwritten notes from the image in a small notebook he
carried in his pocket.Around 10:49 a.m. he left his ofﬁce and checked his
luggage in at the airport. Shortly after that he returned to spend several
more hours at the NRO.At 3:55 p.m. he left his ofﬁce for good and
checked in for his ﬂight destined for Switzerland. However, while he was
riding on the shuttle to his plane, at approximately 5:05 p.m., he was
approached by an FBI agent and placed under arrest. When he was
searched, the notebook containing the handwritten geo-coordinates he had
recorded early in the day was found in his pockets. Several pages of annota-
tions were found, as well as paper containing a coding system he had used
for the coordinates. In addition, his wallet contained a piece of paper that
had the addresses and telephone numbers of:
■
Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Bern, Switzerland
■
Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Vienna,Austria
■
Embassy of Iraq in Vienna,Austria
■
Iraqi Interests Section in Paris, France
A second piece of paper concealed in his right shoe contained several other
addresses of embassies.
When his residence was subsequently searched, evidence related to his queries
about “offshore IBC and bank accounts/credit cards” was found. Brian Patrick
Regan was sentenced to life in prison for Attempted Espionage (Iraq),Attempted
Espionage (China), and Gathering National Defense Information.
Analysis
The problem with this case is that Regan’s résumé does not show his true inten-
tions. His credentials highlight a patriot that enlisted in the Air Force at the age of
18, retired, and then continued to serve the country as a government subcontractor.
Despite this illusion, his true intentions come out in his letters when he wrote that
people within the intelligence community do not spy because they are afraid of
being caught. Perhaps we are more optimistic than we should be, but we sincerely
hope that the vast majority of the people in this community do not spy because they
are loyal to their country.

Case Study: Chinese National Accesses Sensitive
Passwords on Critical AF Logistics System
Unknown to the colonel in charge of the REMIS system, a subcontractor of defense
giant Litton PRC has hired Chinese nationals to work on his software. One of those
employees, Zhangyi “Steven” Liu, discovers lax security and he easily obtains full
access to the computer system and a copy of all the passwords.

Details
Zhangyi “Steven” Liu was a computer programmer from mainland China who
worked for a company (Shanghai Tandem Software Systems) that subcontracted to
Litton PRC in Dayton, Ohio. He was a single child born to poor parents in
Shanghai, China.Academically he was a good student, and he graduated in the top
10 percent of his class with a bachelor’s degree in electronic engineering from
Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 1994.The job at Shanghai Tandem Software
Systems was his ﬁrst, and he was brought to the US by the company and paid $500
a month plus about $35 per diem. Liu’s rent (apartment shared among four people),
utilities, insurance, and use of an older (shared) car were also provided by the com-
pany. He lived modestly and sent the money he earned back to his parents in China.

In his position at Shanghai Tandem Software Systems he was responsible for
working on software improvements to the unclassiﬁed software system named
REMIS at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. REMIS stands for the Reliability &
Maintainability Information System and is a “$148M logistics system used for
tracking aircraft and weapons systems mission capability data, such as maintenance
information, missile and communications-electronic information, and aircraft inven-
tory data.”5 REMIS is unclassiﬁed but is considered to be highly sensitive.
While working on the software, Liu looked around at the ﬁles on the computer
that he had access to. One of those ﬁles was a program named “ffup,” which gave a
user access to all ﬁles on the computer system. He used this program that had been
left behind as a shortcut by another developer to copy all of the passwords on the
system.6
Two weeks later, alert system administrator Jeffrey Wood discovered the intru-
sion. Just one day before Liu was scheduled to return to China he was arrested.Air
Force’s Col. William Colmer, who is responsible for managing over 170 information
systems, testiﬁed that access to REMIS could provide an adversary with “a general
sense of the overall reliability and available of crucial weapons systems.”7
Furthermore, Colmer testiﬁed that more than $350,000 was spent making thorough
checks to search for backdoors and changes in software that could have been
installed by Liu with his elevated access. One federal ofﬁcial interviewed by the
Dayton Daily News said:
The real fear was not that (Lui) had discovered something helpful
to a foreign government. The fear is that he was in a position to
put bugs in the program and cause the program to go down at a
critical time. What happens if you can’t ﬂy planes because nobody
can tell the status of the planes? 8
In court, Liu told U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Merz that he was sorry and
that he was “like a kid who found a toy… (he was) allowed to walk in a room of
secrets.They put the tools in the room without ever telling me not to use them, and
just expecting that I wouldn’t.” However, OSI Special Agent Karen Mathews said
that Liu told her he “wanted to own the system” and that he shared the passwords
he found with another Chinese programmer. In addition, according to reports, Liu
and ﬁve other Chinese nationals working on this project failed lie detector tests. 9
Initially, in May 1998, Liu was sentenced to six months in jail with a ﬁne of
$5,000. But with concerns that Liu was not properly counseled when he confessed,
the judge allowed him to withdraw his plea.At the same time, public defender
Randolph Alden request a new trial quoting the results of the Air Force Ofﬁce of
Special Investigations report that “levels of access (on REMIS) had not been estab-

341_INS_THR_07.qxd  11/20/05  2:57 PM  Page 289

lished; therefore, it was impossible for Liu to have exceeded his authorized access.”
The judge ordered that his conﬁnement could be served concurrently on work-
release in California, where he was offered a job by XYPRO Technology Corp.The
job offer was prompted by Dale E.S. Blommendahl, who is an executive member of
the XYPRO staff, and is the designer of a software package named “Safeguard” that
would have protected the REMIS system from this event. Safeguard was installed
following Liu’s arrest.
On January 14, 2000, Liu was re-sentenced to four months in prison and one
year of supervised release.At the sentencing, Liu told the judge,“This is probably the
most terrible mistake I’ve ever made in my life.”
Analysis
In court, Col. Colmer, who directs the REMIS system, testiﬁed that he was unaware
that Liu and 10 other Chinese nationals were on a subcontract by the USAF. Beyond
the signiﬁcant problem of lack of security applied to the computer systems them-
selves, there was also a lack of personnel security and a lack of clear communica-
tions.
This is possibly also a problem caused by the ﬁnancial motivations of companies
attempting to provide the least expensive solution. Dayton attorney Gary W.
Gottschlich, who previously represented Liu, said:
Steven is a scapegoat for their own stupidity and laziness. It’s just
simply economics. There are many foreign nationals from around
the world working on such projects. They’re available and they’re
cheap.10
Just today my company (a small government contractor) received an unsolicited call
from a business offering to outsource our computer programming needs to Russia at
a rate of $16/hour. Good or bad, offshore programming is on the rise, and security
procedures need to be changed to account for these scenarios.

Summary
Government contractors face the same threats as both government organizations and
corporations combined.They are pressured with conducting the same type of sensi-
tive, high-level security activities as the government, but with the additional demand
of turning a proﬁt. In addition, the lack of bureaucracy that makes companies
appealing to governments can mean lack of oversight and enable lone insiders to
hide their activity like rogue traders without a visible back ofﬁce.
Employees operating within government contractors need to be especially aware
of the danger of insider threat and have management support for the resources nec-
essary to combat it.

Introduction
“Trust no one, suspect everyone, and make counter accusations” is a saying you hear
often in the insider threat community. While it is often said as a joke, there is some
inherent value to it. Oftentimes companies suffer large amounts of damage and
problems because they have too much trust.“Johnny would never do anything
wrong; he is our most loyal employee.”Then, after there is a ﬁnancial loss, you hear
the reverse of “how could Johnny have done that to us after everything we have
done for him?”
While a dose of healthy paranoia is a good thing, you have to strike a balance
between trusting everyone and trusting no one.Too much of either will cause prob-
lems and lead to unsuccessful organizations and business relationships. If you never
trust anyone, from a personal standpoint you will never fully get to enjoy what life
has to offer. From a business standpoint you will often frustrate and annoy your
employees because they will not be given the additional responsible they deserve
because you do not trust them. From a personal sanity standpoint you will never feel
empowered enough to ever delegate any work and will feel stressed and burnt out
from matters that others could easily handle for you.This is often the reason that
really smart, intelligent people make such poor managers: they are afraid to delegate.
They do not trust than anyone can do the job as well as them or they do not want
to give away the control of information. Knowledge is power but only if you share it
in a selective manner. Not willing to trust anyone else with the information will
actually decrease the value of the data because no one else can use it to make effec-
tive decisions. On the other hand, not properly controlling it and giving it away to
everyone has its own series of problems.
This brings us to the other extreme: trusting everyone.There are certain cases
where restricting information is a good thing to do. Sometimes, if people have infor-
mation they do not need, they can be more tempted to do harm with it than if they
didn’t have it. While it is tempting to walk through life thinking no one is going to
cause any harm or do anything malicious against you, this mind-set will often back-
ﬁre on you.Therefore, it is good to realize that some selective measures need to be
put in place to determine whether someone can be trusted or not.
The way most of us do this is through proﬁling. We know what to look for in a
person and if someone acts a certain way we are more or less likely to trust them.

General Types of Proﬁling
We proﬁle all the time and do not even realize it. When we meet a new person and
we walk away thinking that person is a jerk, a mean person, etc., it is usually because
there were certain things that we examined or picked up on that led us to that con-
clusion. It would take a much longer period of time to truly know a person’s per-
sonality and how they act, but there are indicators and signs that we use to make a
determination. Even though in an hour-long meeting, the person could have had a
bad day or been very tired, you can still do a pretty good job of ﬁguring them out
in a short period of time. One key management technique that people use that is a
form of proﬁling is: if someone does not impress you in the ﬁrst week they are on
the job, they most likely will not impress you. Now, this technique can have a lot of
holes punched in it because the person might not have been given the right oppor-
tunities, they might be shy, there could be numerous reasons, but you are taking
actions they perform and forming a proﬁle of that person and judging that person
based on the proﬁle, no matter how right or wrong it is.The interesting thing is
most people do a pretty good job at proﬁling people.
My father-in-law was a police ofﬁcer when my wife and I got married and I
knew that he invited several of his fellow ofﬁcers to the wedding. Even though I had
never met them before, I went up to most of them, introduced myself, and said,“So
how long have you worked on the force with my father-in–law?”They usually gave
me a weird look and said,“How did you know?” My answer was that I could just
tell. People in different professions look and act a certain way and if you know to
look for those behavior traits, you can easily proﬁle someone and make a determina-
tion about their background, personality, and profession.Yes, I am one of those weird
people who by looking at you can tell what you do for a living.
Proﬁling is the whole concept of the game Spot the Fed that is played at
DefCon each year in Las Vegas.The idea is that you watch how people act, what
they do, and how they look, and you try to spot the federal enforcement ofﬁcials
who come to the conference each year but are dressed in civilian clothes. One of my
friends who is a fed goes every year and even though he dresses to ﬁt in with t-
shirts, ripped shorts, and purple hair, and looks like everyone else, he always gets
caught every year. It is hard to put into words, but even thought he looks the same,
he still sticks out like a sore thumb.
There are many ways of proﬁling, but the general methods that work with
detecting the insider threat are the following:
■
Actions
■
Appearance
■
Instinct
www.syngress.com
Proﬁles of the Insider Threat • Chapter 8
297
341_INS_THR_08.qxd  11/20/05  2:59 PM  Page 297

People that are lying tend to not look you in the eye when they are talking, start
playing with their ﬁngers, twirling their hair, and start to look uncomfortable. Now
these are all extreme examples but they highlight the point that there are behavior
patterns associated with different actions that someone is performing.Typically, with
the insider, we are looking for actions that would indicate nervous behavior or
behavior that shows someone is uncomfortable in a given situation or trying to
cover something up.Anyone who is a parent can attest to this, that if you walk in the
room, based on the expression on your kid’s face or how he looks, you can tell he
did something wrong or he is up to no good.
You can also see this with employees when you walk into someone’s ofﬁce and
she jumps up from the keyboard quickly or starts clicking rapidly on the screen or
even turns off the monitor if you start to walk around to the back of her desk. Her
actions are telling you that she is trying to cover up something or is up to no good.
While there can also be reasonable explanations for why people do certain things,
actions speak louder than words.
A great example of proﬁling someone based on actions is with the Scott
Peterson trial. Many people thought he was guilty and when you asked them why,
they said,“Did you see the picture of him on the news during the trial?” He showed
no remorse, he was not upset, his actions or lack thereof showed that he must be
guilty. Now, hopefully the jury listened to all of the facts, but we as humans are
going to judge people right, wrong, or indifferent based on their behaviors and cor-
responding actions.
The key thing with proﬁling an insider is if you see actions that look suspicious,
the next step is to monitor the person closely. Remember to make sure you have
proper policies in place, that you have taken away the expectation of privacy, and
that you do it in a consistent manner. If it continues, talking to the person in a non-
confrontational way could also cause the person to show other actions that could be
watched to help determine their true intent.
Now, before we go further, I want to point out that proﬁling is a science that
takes years of professional training and expertise to perfect.This chapter is meant to
just touch the surface on different things to look for and to be aware of.
The next way that we proﬁle people is based on appearance. While I do not like
this method because it could cause you to jump to false conclusions, people do it. If
you look at my class picture from when I was in 4th grade, your immediate response
is “What a geek.”Yes, I was the pudgy-faced kid with the green pants, yellow shirt,
and plaid jacket on: I was a stud. If people come into work with sandals, jeans, and a
t-shirt, we proﬁle them differently than if they are wearing a pressed suit and a
stylish tie. However, this one you have to be very careful with in regards to insider
threat.As you will see, an insider attacker can play any role, so just because someone

341_INS_THR_08.qxd  11/20/05  2:59 PM  Page 298

dresses sharp or does not dress up does not make them any more or less likely to be
a potential attacker.
The last type of proﬁling we perform is based on instinct.You’re not sure why
you feel a certain way but you really like that person or you cannot explain why but
you really do not trust that person.This is sometimes referred to as the gut test, the
smell test, or trusting your instinct.You are not always sure why, but something just
does not seem right about the person or how he acts. If you have been around for a
while and have worked with enough people, you can usually become a pretty good
judge of characters and people.
Base Proﬁle
We have talked about there being no set demographic proﬁle of people likely to
commit insider threat, but there are some basic characteristics of those people that
have been caught.This section will look at the similarities in the insiders that have
been caught and potentially prosecuted.This section is what we are calling the
lower-end attacker.The reason being is that the high-end attacker does not get
caught.The base characteristics of the people who have been caught are the fol-
lowing:
■
They had minimal technical knowledge.
■
They worked at various positions.
■
Their attacks focused on IP.
■
They were money driven.
■
They did not fully understand repercussions.
■
They somehow tipped other people off about what they were doing.
■
Anger played some part in their attack.
■
External indications of their attack were evident.
■
Their actions make an adverse impact on the company.
Minimal Technical Knowledge
Most of us have probably watched too many movies and too many re-runs of James
Bond to think that the insider is highly technical using the latest and greatest gadgets
to sneak into the facility and escape in the same stealth, covert manner.While there
might be one or two high-tech insider attackers, they are deﬁnitely not the norm.
Most people committing insider threat use low-tech methods with high effectiveness.

Proﬁles of the Insider Threat • Chapter 8
299
341_INS_THR_08.qxd  11/20/05  2:59 PM  Page 299

There are many reasons for this, but one reason is that an attacker is always going to
attack the path of least resistance or look for the weakest link to try to break in. Since
most companies are not set up or prepared to deal with the insider, their organizations
are wide open. Remember, the security of most companies is built around a strong
perimeter to protect from external attacks.They have minimal, if any, protection
against an attack that occurs within the trusted walls of their organization.
Therefore, the easiest way to compromise an organization from the inside is as
simple as copying, e-mailing, or deleting a ﬁle off the server.Attackers are not using
any special tools or techniques.They are using the normal methods they use to do
their jobs, but change their motive to do harm instead of helping the company. Most
people have access to some information, data, or systems that, if it were destroyed,
modiﬁed, or compromised, could cause harm to the company. Now, instead of
accessing the ﬁle in the normal course of their jobs, they purposely delete it or
attach it to a hotmail e-mail so that it gets sent to their personal accounts or an e-
mail account of a competitor.
While the high-tech methods make great movies, things are so bad at most orga-
nizations that just utilizing the standard operating procedures will yield the end
results the attacker is looking for.The problem with insiders using existing tools that
they use to perform their everyday jobs is that there is nothing outwardly suspicious
about what they are doing. If your company does not sanction steganography as an
authorized tool (which very few companies do), the mere fact that you have it run-
ning on your system is highly suspicious and in some cases enough evidence to take
further disciplinary action against the individual.
I have actually worked on investigations where the insider used steganography.
When I tell people about the case, they think it is very cool; however, it was actually
very simple.The company ran spyware-like scanning programs on all the desktops.
One of the checks it performed was to look for stools.exe. It found it on a com-
puter. Since there was no valid reason for this program or type of program to be on
the system, it led to an immediate investigation, which determined that the person
was extracting information out of the organization. Because this insider left a suspi-
cious exe on the desktop, he was caught. It would be easier if attackers were using
high-tech, non-sanctioned tools, because it would be easier to catch them. However,
the fact that they are using normal tools that should be on the computer makes it
very difﬁcult to trace and detect.
Hopefully, as organizations implement stronger security measures against insider
threat, insiders will be forced to install new and different tools, which will make it
easier to detect them. However, now they are in essence not doing anything out of
the ordinary or different from what they would normally do, which enables attackers
to ﬂy under the radar and be harder to detect.

Chapter 8 • Proﬁles of the Insider Threat
341_INS_THR_08.qxd  11/20/05  2:59 PM  Page 300

Worked at Various Positions
One of my favorite magazine advertisements states at the top of the page,“We just
caught the latest computer hacker at your company.”At the bottom of the page are
the words,“Betty from accounting,” followed by a mug shot of an innocent-looking
lady with a smirk on her face. Once again, it is probably the inﬂuence of movies, but
we have this impression that someone who is going to commit insider threat has to
have body piercing, cut-off jeans, and long hair in order to do harm to the company.
We think there is no way a well-dressed executive would ever do anything to hurt
the company. It is not the outer appearance that determines whether someone will
be an inside attacker, it is their inner appearance, which is very hard to tell.
If you look across the board, there is no single position in the company that will
make someone more likely to commit an insider threat than another.There is some-
thing within the insiders themselves that makes them turn on the company and to
justify what they are doing as morally just. From the entry-level data-entry clerk to
the senior VP, they all have been known to perform actions that will cause harm to
their companies.
Based on my investigation and clients, I have found more and more that the
people you would not normally suspect are the ones committing the attacks.The
simple reason is: because they would not be suspected. In addition, if they are fairly
well trusted and high up in an organization, there is also a good chance that they
will be brought into the trusted inner circle when the company is investigating the
attack. If the insider is also involved with the investigation and knows every step that
is being taken, it is trivial for her to stay one step ahead and never get caught. Now,
unsolved problems at organizations usually cause uncertainty, so an alternative
strategy is for the insider to either plant evidence or start targeting someone who
would be a likely target for the attack and have him be the fall person.
The funny thing is that it does not take much to start a witch hunt. If you have
someone in an organization of whom everyone is a little leery and there is a major
insider investigation occurring, it would probably not take much for the insider to
add some uncertainty to the equation and say,“Did anyone else notice so-and-so
acting strange?” Most likely, people will jump in and say,“Well, now that you bring
it up, I saw that person doing this,” and everyone will pretty much jump on top as if
they are playing a virtual version of kill the guy.
Therefore, when investigating an insider threat case, do not ever let position or
appearance impair your judgment. Judge the facts and only the facts and try to elim-
inate and ﬁlter out any hearsay or information that has not been validated.The dif-
ference between a good insider handler and a great insider handler is the great
insider handler will look for factual information that can be validated and will base

their investigation solely on that information and nothing else. Staying focused is
critical to making sure you don’t head down the wrong path. Falsely accusing
someone of a crime is bad and should be avoided at all cost, but the more disturbing
fact is that the real attacker is still at large within your company and most likely
knew about the investigation. Since they knew that the company was looking for an
insider, most likely they have watched their actions even more closely and the
chances of catching them now are even more difﬁcult. When investigating an insider
attack, I always say that you only have one chance to catch the person. Why?
Because if you do not catch them the ﬁrst time, there is a good chance you will
never get a second chance to catch them.They will either stop or go even more
covert so that the chances of catching them the second time are almost impossible.
Attacks Focused on IP
Almost every insider attack at one level or another is focused on intellectual prop-
erty or IP.This should logically make sense because if the attack was not focused on
revealing, modifying, or destroying something of value to the company, then it most
likely would not be classiﬁed as an insider attack. From the disgruntled employee
who wants to cause harm to the company to the advanced attacker who wants to
have ﬁnancial gain, IP is the end state that they are going to focus on.
If I am a disgruntled employee, I want to do something to harm or damage the
company. Spray painting the walls in my ofﬁce, stealing my ofﬁce furniture, and saying
nasty things about my boss in a chat room are really not going to accomplish anything.
If I want to cause harm to the company I want to cause monetary loss either directly
or indirectly. In most cases if I am going to cause monetary loss, IP has to be involved
at some level. If I take a sensitive piece of information like client credit card numbers
and I post them to a public site or send them to a newspaper, this is going to cause
embarrassment which will result in monetary loss. If I destroy a proposal that the com-
pany has been working on for ﬁve months, it is due in three days, and I destroyed all
copies including backup tapes, that is going to cause monetary loss to the company. If I
ﬁnd a high-end drug and I am able to change the formula so it is no longer produced
correctly, that will cause huge monetary loss both directly and indirectly through
potential litigation and lawsuits. In any of these cases, without even realizing it, the dis-
gruntled employee is focusing on intellectual property because he knows that is where
they he will cause the most pain for the company.
High-end insiders committing corporate espionage are usually directly targeting
IP, because that it what will give the companies they are really working for a com-
petitive advantage. If they are going to steal something, they want to steal something
that is worth a lot of money so they can either use it for their own personal advan-

tage or sell it off. Why steal a server and try to sell it for $20,000 when anyone can
buy a new server for a similar price? However, the formula for a soft drink, a client
list, a special way to solve a complex problem, are all things that could be sold for
high value because they cannot be bought anywhere else and in essence are one-of-
a-kind items.
Money Driven
Donald Trump isn’t the only one who cares about money. Money is the driving
factor for most insider threat attacks. Either indirectly or directly, money usually
plays some part in driving the insider to perform the attacks against the company. It
is amazing what money or the lack of money can cause people to do. I have seen
cases where people who committed insider attacks were caught and then claimed
that it wasn’t their fault because they had no choice.They claimed that if they hadn’t
committed the insider attack they would have lost everything and their families
would have been living on the street. While some of these stories can be heart
wrenching, money was the primary motivator that caused these people to commit
their attacks.
Some argue that in the case of a disgruntled employee that there was no mone-
tary gain for them to destroy a proposal, which is usually correct. However, money
was probably a catalyst that caused them to decide to launch the attack in the ﬁrst
place. Many employees become disgruntled when they are not given a raise or are
passed up for promotion. So the lack of money is usually a driver for launching the
attack.Also, the attack itself is driven by money. It is not driven by the positive inﬂux
of money in the pocket of the attacker, but it is driven by the negative money or the
loss of revenue that the attack will cause to the company. For some reason, causing
the company monetary harm makes attackers think they will feel better about being
passed up for a promotion.
Also, as insider attacks continue to grow, you will see the same maturity and
evolution that occurred with external attacks. Originally, external attacks were
focused on defacement of a Web site or a denial-of-service attack.These attacks
caused the company some embarrassment and potential loss but little gain to the
attacker.Then they started taking attacks to the next step and breaking in and
gaining control of systems to extract data or cause more direct monetary beneﬁt to
the attacker.
The same pattern is going to continue to occur with insider threats. Most early
publicized attacks were focused on the destruction of resources with a heavy
emphasis on the disgruntled employee, with reduction of money to the company as
a primary motivator to pay the company back for the harm that was caused to the

insider.As time moves on, we will see these attacks begin to mature and become
more motivated by money. Instead of the disgruntled employee only causing loss to
the company, the employee will decide to make money from the attack to make up
for not getting that raise. Now the style of the insider attack will start to look more
like the high-end attack where they are stealing sensitive information and selling it
to the highest bidder. If you do not think there is a market for this, you have to look
closer at what is happening in the dark corners of the Internet.
Insider mercenaries are being sought out and pitched to extract critical assets
that organizations are after. One of the prime targets for inside attacks are executives’
laptops from different corporations.There are “ads” on the Internet that offer
$100,000 dollars for the delivery of a laptop from a vice president of company x.
This might seem extreme and risky but it really isn’t. If you think about the amount
of information that would be on a laptop from a VP at a Fortune 100 company, it
easily is worth a million dollars if not more. In cases like this you might have
internal employees that see little risk of taking a laptop and let all those zeros blur
their vision.They do not even realize the harm they are causing for the company
and the potential harm they are causing for themselves.
Not Fully Understanding Repercussions
To most people, the concept of:“you break the law, you go to jail” seems pretty
straightforward, it is amazing how people justify their actions and do not think what
they are doing is wrong.There have been many studies that show that even in cases
where someone is clearly wrong, in their minds they still feel justiﬁed with their
actions and think they are right.This is the reason it is usually not beneﬁcial to argue
with someone, because you are never going to win.They think they are right and
you think you are right and that is the foundation for major feuding to occur.
Many people who commit insider attacks do not truly understand how much
trouble they could get into if they are caught and more basically do not even realize
they are breaking the law. I have seen time and time again insiders not understand
why they were arrested.“I was only playing around and deleting some ﬁles to get
the company back for not promoting me. What is the problem and why am I get-
ting into trouble?”
In one case, where the individual was sentenced to more than eight years in
prison, the person had no idea he could actually get arrested and have to go to jail.
He thought if he got caught he would be ﬁred but that was it. He had no idea that
what he was doing was so bad.This is also an area were policies can help to make
sure the line between good and bad are black and white.A policy can clearly lay out
what is expected of users and what could be the repercussions if they do not follow
the rules.

Gentle reminders are not a bad idea to remind employees that any criminal
activity will be punished to the full extent of the law. More and more companies are
putting up security policies with reminders to employees that the company takes
insider threat seriously. One of my favorite posters says that if you take corporate
secrets and share them with a competitor you will receive this gift absolutely free
and it has a picture of handcuffs.
Another problem is the addictive nature of insider attacks. With drug addiction,
the ﬁrst time people try a drug they have a small amount.Then, as they become
addicted, they slowly increase the dosage and frequency. Before they know it, the
problem has gotten out of hand. With insider threat, the attacker might ﬁrst just take
a newsletter and give it to a competitor.This is a public document that is freely dis-
tributed across the organization so there is nothing wrong with that.Then the
insider might take a sensitive company memo and think that since the newsletter
wasn’t a big deal, the company memo isn’t either.This process continues and before
you know it, very sensitive information is being handed over to a competitor.Then,
instead of one or two documents a month, the insider is leaking information on a
weekly or daily basis. Since it slowly got worse over time, in the attacker’s mind it is
still not that bad, yet in reality she has gotten in way over her head and the problem
is out of control.
While it will not work for everyone, quarterly one- to two-hour awareness ses-
sions reminding people of the dangers of insider threat and what could happen if
they get caught could potentially nip some of these problems in the bud.
Other People Knew
In almost every case, someone besides the attacker knew either explicitly what was
going on or had an idea that something suspicious was occurring. In the cases where
people explicitly knew what was occurring, it is usually because the attackers told
them.This is usually the case with a spouse or a trusted friend.There are many rea-
sons the conﬁdants never said anything, but the ﬁrst is that they thought the
attackers were justiﬁed in doing what they did.“My husband worked loyally for that
company for 10 years. How dare they not promote him? He has a right to take
action and be upset.” In some cases the spouse or trusted person might have even
encouraged the person to do something and provided a support channel that they
were doing the right thing. Once again, after the fact, we ﬁnd that most of the
spouses or trusted parties failed to realize the impact the actions would have. In one
case, a wife was in tears because she never realized what her husband was doing
would put him in jail and ruin their lives. If she had realized that beforehand, she
would have stopped him or forced him to get help.

Another reason a trusted third party does not do anything is because they are
loyal to the friend or spouse and do not think it is their place to breach that loyalty.
“My friend is going through a hard time and needs encouragement and support. He
does not need someone to rat on him or get him in trouble.” If we are talking about
something minor, that logic might hold up, but with major insider attacks, people
need to ask themselves how they would feel if their friends’ lives are ruined, they are
going to jail for ﬁve years, and they could have stopped them.Thinking about the big
picture is really key in these situations. Sometimes being a true friend requires being
put in an uncomfortable position even if your friend might not see it at the time.
The second way people ﬁnd out about insider attacks is by observing the person
do something they shouldn’t do. Even in Fortune 50 companies that are very large, it
is very difﬁcult if not impossible to do something that no one else knows about or
no one else sees.This comes up time and time again where the attacker wonders
how in the world someone could have known what he was doing, thinking there
was no way anyone could have found out about it.The world is a small place and
most attackers are not as good as they think they are.Also, the longer people do
something, the sloppier they get. In the beginning they might have covered up their
tracks, but over time they get cocky and have a greater chance of getting caught.
If other people knew something was going on, why didn’t they say anything?
People are afraid to put their noses into someone else’s business.They could be afraid
there could be retribution against them from the individual or that it is just not their
place to start trouble.These people need to step back and realize that if the company
loses money, the result will directly affect them: they will not get their raises. If the
company goes out of business and they are out of work, it really hits home.As an
employee of the company, it is your responsibility to do what is morally right and
make sure you watch out for the best interest of the company.
Anger Played Some Part
At some level anger and frustration usually contribute to the reason the insider is
committing the attack against the company. It could be a major reason in the case of
disgruntled employees who are so frustrated and angry that they feel like they have
no other solution but to take that anger out on the company. With a corporate espi-
onage attack, anger usually plays a much smaller role, but could also be the straw that
broke the camel’s back that causes the employee to turn on the company. Even with
the temptation of money, it might not be enough for most people to steal from the
company; however since their boss pissed them off and they’re a little upset, they
decide to make some extra money and give it a try.

The important point about anger is that it is a factor that can be used to detect
someone who is or more likely to commit an insider attack against a company.Anger
is not something that could easily be hidden and is usually fairly obvious to co-
workers, bosses, and contractors.Therefore, if you see someone showing a high degree
of visible anger and frustration in the workplace, you might want to keep a close eye
on them and see about getting them some sort of anger management or help.
If you think a problem is beyond hope, removing the person from the situation,
usually through termination of employment, is the best option. However, if you
catch the problem early enough it could potentially be saved. Indications of anger in
the workplace should be identiﬁed and dealt with quickly to reduce the chances of
them turning into major problems and getting out of hand.
External Indication
After a devastating insider attack, many executives say that if there had been some
way they could have known that something was going on, they could have acted
earlier or prevented it. We know in the case of insider threat that prevention is fairly
difﬁcult, but there are some things that can be done to try to prevent it, like strictly
controlling access and properly protecting critical assets. However, the more impor-
tant question is, was there anything that you could have seen that would have helped
to detect that there was a problem? In most cases there is usually some external indi-
cator that tells us that someone is about to or in the process of committing insider
threat.
It is not uncommon for people to carry around an umbrella even if it is not
raining because there are indicators that it might rain. It does not make sense to wait
for it to rain and then try to ﬁnd an umbrella. Planning is much better. With plan-
ning we look for indicators of what is going to happen and then plan for those
events to occur. In this case it is better if it looks like it is going to rain to bring an
umbrella and not need it than to not have an umbrella and get rained on.
The important thing to remember with predications and indicators is that there
is some uncertainty involved with these decisions. Sometimes rain is guaranteed, but
usually there is some chance but it is not 100%. If the weather forecast say there is a
30% chance of rain, you have to decide whether to bring your umbrella or take a
chance.There is the possibility that you react to an indicator like a cloudy sky and it
never actually rains.This same thing can occur with insider threat and reacting to
external indicators.
Now the good news is that with most insider threat cases there are some indica-
tors that can be used to determine that there is a problem.These external indicators
can be broken up into two general categories: business indicators and personal 
indicators.

Business indicators are things that are happening to the company that could be
an indication of a problem.The following are some potential business indicators:
■
Poor quarterly earnings
■
Loss of key contracts or key customers
■
Change over in employees in a given area or department
■
Increase in number of attacks or reported incidents
These are all examples of business indicators that could show there is some
problem in your organization and with some investigation could point to an insider
threat.The good news with business indicators is that they are always present when
insider threat is occurring.The bad news is it might not always be obvious that the
problem is being caused by insider threat because with any of the aforementioned
indicators there are numerous reasons why they could occur, many having nothing
to do with insider threat.Therefore, while there are indicators, none of the indicators
are exclusive to insider threat.
Going back to the good news, if we can even call it that, if there is an insider
attack of any proportion, there will always be an indicator. If there is no impact to
the company, it means that the attack did not do any harm or cause any problems
for the organization. While harm is usually the end result in the case of a disgruntled
employee, if there was no harm or any impact to the company, then in the case of a
disgruntled employee the attack did not really work.They might have deleted a ﬁle
that no one cared about or thought they deleted a ﬁle but actually didn’t.The
bottom line is if they actually targeted critical information and were successful, there
will be a business reaction or an indicator.
In the case of a high-end attacker, harm is not usually a short-term goal. One
can argue that it is a longer-term goal but if a competitor is targeting a company to
give themselves an economic advantage, then ideally over the long term if the com-
pany suffers enough harm or goes out of business they have achieved the ultimate
competitive advantage. However, the actual attack itself is not usually designed to
cause harm.The primary objective is usually to acquire a piece of critical IP. If the
insider targeted and successfully acquired a critical piece of IP, there should be some
impact to the company. If there was no impact at all, than I would question whether
the IP was really critical and why a company was spending money and resources to
keep it conﬁdential when there was no reason it needed to be kept secret.The
whole reason information needs to be kept protected is that if the information was
made public, it would cause harm to the company. Harm can come in the form of
losing market share or revenue, suffering embarrassment, etc., but the bottom line is

308
Chapter 8 • Proﬁles of the Insider Threat
341_INS_THR_08.qxd  11/20/05  2:59 PM  Page 308

there has to be some repercussions; otherwise, it does not make sense to put energy
into protecting something.
We do not want to get into the syndrome where our new hammer is insider
threat and everything is a nail. I am sure we have all seen this occur where someone
drinks a little too much of the “Kool-Aid” and now everything must be caused by
that one problem.A system goes down; it must be insider threat. Johnny does not
show up for work; he must be committing an insider attack.The list could go on
and on. What we want to do is just keep insider threat as an option. For example, if
the company did not make as much on a new product release, which contributed to
the fact that the company did not make their numbers, a little investigation should
be done. If the main reason has to do with a competitor beating them to market and
no one can ﬁgure out how the competitor did this, then insider threat should be
considered as an option. However, if the reason the product did not make money
was because there were design problems and the company admitted that they rushed
and made mistakes, then blaming it on insider threat would probably not be appro-
priate because there is a logical explanation. However, there could also be a ﬁne line
between the two. Let’s slightly modify the last scenario. In this case, let’s assume that
the product did not make money because there were lots of problems and bugs with
the system.After analysis, no one can ﬁgure out how this could have occurred
because the design was solid and everything was properly tested and despite a lot of
analysis no one can give a logical answer to how this occurred. Now insider threat
could be considered as an option.
Notice the key wording I used in all these cases. Based on business indicators
you could consider insider threat as a possible cause. I never said it must be insider
threat. I would need to do a lot of additional analysis to make the call 100%, but the
point is when you see indicators and no other explanation makes sense, insider threat
should be put on your list of possible causes for the problem.
The second type of indicators is personal indicators. Unlike business indicators,
personal indicators are not always there and can be hard to ﬁnd, but the good news
is that when they are there, they can usually be traced back to insider threat more
directly than a business indicator. We talked about anger as one of the types of per-
sonal indicators, but there could be several others. Some of the key personal business
indicators are:
■
Frustration/anger
■
Change in business patterns
■
Change in personality
■
Rash decisions
■
Sense of urgency

Frustration and anger we talked about in the previous section. Not always, but
especially in disgruntled employees, the driving factor or indicator is an increased
frustration towards the company. When dealing with indicators and personal
behavior we have to remember the straw that broke the camel’s back paradigm. I
have seen companies that say,“We knew John was angry, but we did not know he
was that angry. We told him he would get up to a 10% raise and we gave him a 7%
raise and he ﬂipped out. How could we have known?” While that seems responsible,
what you have to remember in almost every situation is that the person justifying it
is not going to give you all the facts. In this case, if you dug deeper you would
realize that over the past year the company did a series of other things to anger John.
They did not give him a bonus’ they passed him up for a promotion; they took away
his paid overtime; and they refused his vacation. Now you can better see how his
anger got to a point were he snapped.Anger usually grows over time, so if you can
catch it early you can stop a problem before it occurs.
The next personal indicator is a change in business patterns and how someone
operates and works in the ofﬁce.While personal issues could result in a change in
business patterns, this could also be an indicator of insider threat. If all of a sudden an
employee is coming in early or staying late or spending more time in the data center
when no one else is around and as soon as people come in, leaves, those are patterns
that should be watched very closely.Anything involving business practices relating to
access should be watched very closely. If someone is going to the boss or even
directly to the help desk asking for access to information she never needed access to
before and her job has not changed, this could be an indicator. In this situation the
best thing to do is to follow up and ask why.There is nothing wrong with a boss
saying,“Mary, I noticed that you have sent me forms for approval to access new direc-
tories. I was just wondering what the business reason is or why you need that access.”
If there is a logical explanation, then at least you can validate the request.
Now, if once you confront Mary she gives vague answers or acts uneasy, you
should take note. Especially if she becomes openly frustrated or angry, that is now a
combination of indicators. If you are doing your job as a boss to follow up on a
request and Mary responds by getting angry and saying,“All I do is work my butt
off around here and you always question me and accuse me! I can’t take this any-
more!” all that should be compiled together as indicators of a much bigger problem.
Some managers prefer not to deal with it just deny the request and not ask why.
Even if you deny the request, you should still validate it because if this is an indicator
of insider threat you could be doing several things with just denying the request.
First, you could be increasing the anger of that person. Second, if this person is com-
mitting or planning an insider attack, your denying her request is not going to stop
her. She tried the easy route and now she will become even more covert to get the

310
Chapter 8 • Proﬁles of the Insider Threat
341_INS_THR_08.qxd  11/20/05  2:59 PM  Page 310

access she needs and these actions you might not be able to see. So it is better to act
on an indicator than make it go away because the next approach might be so much
better that you have no chance of catching it.
Personality changes are another big indicator that there is a problem. Performing
insider attacks is like a drug that lures people in. Most people that are heavily
addicted to drugs are not happy and know they have a problem, but they do not
know how to ﬁx it because they are in over their heads.The same problem occurs
with insider threat. Once people are actively engaged in committing the crime, they
are in over their heads.They like the money they are getting for doing it but they
know it is wrong and that they need to stop. But they don’t know how.This causes
anxiety which can result in changes in personality.
Personality changes can also be more subtle, like not socializing as much in the
ofﬁce or not wanting to go out to lunch with co-workers. If the whole department
goes out to lunch on a weekly basis and one person stops going and they do not
give a good reason, that could be an indicator that you want to examine closely. If
you notice someone going outside more to talk on the cell phone, that could be an
indicator, especially if they take some calls in the ofﬁce.The question you have to
ask is why that person took one call in the ofﬁce but had to step outside so no one
heard the other calls. Especially if it is a full-time employee and the company is
paying for the cell phone, all calls should be work related.There are always personal
calls that need to be made, but if the frequency of secret calls is increasing, these are
indicators that should be watched closely.
Other personality changes involve stress-related changes like being more prone
to aggravation, not thinking logically, not attending or participating in meetings.A
good example on a recent case I worked on was the insider’s e-mail style. Before he
started causing harm to the company, this person used to write very positive, well-
thought-out e-mails.As he continued in his insider activities, his e-mails became
very snappy and illogical.They would jump around and not be complete thoughts.
Stress can also cause this, but the bottom line is, if someone’s personality is changing
so much that you can see it, whether it is an indication of insider threat or not, this
person is asking for help. Even if it turns out it had nothing to do with insider
threat, you need to care about your employees and take care of them. If they are
having problems, provide the help and guidance they need.
Two other changes to watch out for are someone making rash decisions and all
decision or actions having a tight sense of urgency. If some of these are personality
traits that someone has always had, that is less of a concern. What we are looking for
with indicators is a change in behavior.
If someone is committing an espionage attack, the demands of the competitor
will increase over time. In the beginning, the competitor is going to want to acquire

Proﬁles of the Insider Threat • Chapter 8

341_INS_THR_08.qxd  11/20/05  2:59 PM  Page 311

anything, even if it has no value, but the more value content the insider provides, the
more demanding the competitor will get.Therefore, if the company the insider is
ultimately working for is getting more demanding, the insider will get more
demanding in his personality. He will start acting more rashly, demanding that his
boss make a decision on something or questioning why it is taking the IT depart-
ment so long to get him access.This intense sense of urgency is usually a ﬂag that
there is a problem or issue.
The important thing to remember is that these are only indicators; they are not
guaranteed indicators that someone is committing or planning insider attacks. Just
like clouds do not always mean rain, someone showing one of the aforementioned
indicators does not mean she should be ﬁred.There could be many other reasons for
these things to occur. But the point is they should be watched closely because they
potentially could be an early warning sign. Especially if many of these are happening
together.You have to look at the facts because there could be other logical explana-
tions, but the point is to at least look and listen and perform some analysis to try to
prevent any insider problems before they occur or limit the amount of damage if
they are already occurring.
Impact to the Company
If someone is going to commit insider threat, he is usually going to do it to cause
harm, for ﬁnancial gain, or both.Therefore, there is going to be some impact to the
company.The problem is twofold. First, the initial impact to the company could
potentially be minor. Not always, but many insiders test the waters when performing
their attacks.They start off slow and see what happens and slowly increase in inten-
sity over time.Therefore, the initial results could potentially be hard to see and
because they are minor there could usually be a lot of other more logical explana-
tions for why something is occurring and insider threat is usually either at the end
of the list or not on the list at all for logical explanations. We have to keep every-
thing in balance, but just putting a small dot on the insider threat radar screen might
not be a bad thing just in case that small dot starts becoming a much bigger dot.
The second problem with the impact is that there can be a delay between when
the attack occurs and when the impact occurs to the company. If an insider deletes a
proposal that is due tomorrow, the impact of the attack will be known immediately.
When the company goes to submit the proposal and it is gone, they will know there
is a problem. Since the contract was not going to be awarded for another 12 months
and the company was planning on the revenue, they will not see the ﬁnancial impact
for another year, but at least they know they are going to lose and have a year to
plan for other business. However, this is not the norm. Normally, the attack occurs

312
Chapter 8 • Proﬁles of the Insider Threat
341_INS_THR_08.qxd  11/20/05  2:59 PM  Page 312

and the impact is not realized for several months or several years later. It is much
harder to trace back a ﬁnancial problem to events that occurred a year prior.
An example is an insider falsely changing the numbers on a huge, multi-year
contract. Since this contract could take six to nine months to evaluate before a
winner is even announced, the company might think they are guaranteed to win the
contract and nine months later ﬁnd out they lost. In performing the post analysis,
almost a year later, they ﬁnd out all of their ﬁnancials were incorrectly modiﬁed.
Now the company feels the impact and knows it was an insider problem, but going
back a year can be very difﬁcult.This is where things get really scary.You know you
have an insider and that they are screwing up your ﬁnancials, but over the past year,
how many other proposals did you submit that you are still waiting to hear back on?
That can give you a real sick feeling in your stomach not only knowing you lost this
contract but also knowing that you are going to lose the last ﬁve you submitted.The
only potential beneﬁt is, the more lead time you have to know you are going to lose
a bid, the more time you have to spin up the sales cycle and ﬁnd new work to make
up for the lost work.
The previous example is still not very likely. In the last example, even thought it
took a while to realize that you have a problem, you still were able to easily trace it
back to the fact it was an insider, ﬁnd out who worked on the contracts, and launch
an investigation. Normally, not only does it take a long time to realize there is a
problem, you usually have no idea what caused the problem and have no idea if
insiders had anything to do with it.
Poor market projections are a perfect example. If your company has poor earn-
ings for a given quarter or year and the stock price dropped, what caused it? Insider
threat should deﬁnitely be on the list, but you have no proof or clues at all to indi-
cate that was the case.You might know that certain projects did not live up to their
expectation, so analysis can be performed on those projects. However, some of those
projects could have been on-going for multiple years, so trying to not only go back
that far in time but also to analyze all that data could be impossible.Another
problem that is occurring today is with M&A (mergers and acquisitions). If you buy
a company and project their product to perform at x level and it didn’t, it is very
hard to determine the cause. During an acquisition there could be so many factors at
play that could impact the decision. Plus, usually there is a high turn over in
employees so the people might not even be around to provide the information you
need. Finally, when a company is purchased there is usually some amount of frustra-
tion and dissent towards the parent company.This could also lead to fertile ground
for an insider attack to occur.

Limitations
In the previous section we covered proﬁles or characteristics of known insider threat.
Taking this logic to the next level, how do we know that someone is an insider? The
only way to know for sure (even in some cases we are not 100% sure) is if they are
caught and found guilty.Therefore, the previous section looked at characteristics of
insiders who were caught attacking their company from within. Some of these cases
were covered in the previous chapters in this book and others were based on pub-
lished reports and cases that were worked on by the author.
While this information gives us a good starting point, we have to remember that
insider threat is a new and constantly evolving area. Just because we know how an
insider attacked a company six months ago, because the means and methods that
insiders are using are constantly evolving, there is a chance that the techniques might
no longer provide good indicators today. However, it is a starting point and that
cannot be overlooked. Remember that there is no secret formula that can magically
be used to catch an attacker. Even if there were, as soon as the attackers found out
about it, they would change and the formula no longer would work all of the time.
The key thing to highlight with the known cases is that they represent a base
methodology for performing an attack. It is not perfect, but you can use that infor-
mation as a starting point and at least apply the lessons learned to stop those types of
attacks from occurring against your company.
The second important limitation to point out is that these people were caught.
The really good ones are still out there, still being successful and not getting caught.
While having a base knowledge of how these attackers were caught is good, we just
have to remember that no matter how good we get, there is always someone better
than us. If you want to be really good at security and incident response, that is a
point that will serve you well. Never let your ego get the best out of you. No matter
how much you learn and how much you know, there will always be someone who
is better than you and therefore you have to out think, out maneuver, and out ﬂy
them in order to catch them and keep your company secure.
Some good people get caught and the investigators are constantly increasing in
skill and technique to be able to stay one step ahead. However, even with the best
skills and techniques, there is still a chance that attackers will get away. Remember,
the end goal of the company is not to catch the attacker.That is a nice-to–have, but
that is not their end goal.Their end goal is to stop the attack from occurring, mini-
mize the ﬁnancial loss, and make sure it does not happen again in as cost-effective
manner as possible.Therefore, many of these attackers focus their methods and atten-
tion on not getting caught. Ideally, they do not want the company to even know
anything is going on, but ultimately they want to make sure it is never traced back

314
Chapter 8 • Proﬁles of the Insider Threat
341_INS_THR_08.qxd  11/20/05  2:59 PM  Page 314

to them. Combining the company’s goals and the attacker’s goals, you can see that
with the current generation of insider attacks, companies are ﬁnding out about
them, but not catching the people who are performing them.
Since the previous section focused in on known attacks or attackers that were
caught, the question comes down to how attackers are getting caught.There are
many ways, but the general breakdown of why most attackers are caught is the 
following:
■
Greed
■
Boastfulness
■
Sloppiness
■
Stupidity
In almost everything we do, we keep pushing ourselves to be able to do more
and go further than we did previously. If you exercise or run, your ultimate goal is to
be able to increase the speed and distance you run or increase the weights or
number of reps that you perform. While consistent increase is good, this leaves the
door open for being too cocky or greedy and trying to do too much or take on too
much. When you see people who have gotten injured at the gym, it is usually
because they got greedy.They were steadily progressing on the weights they were
lifting and they were up to 90 pounds and they wanted to get over the 100-pound
limit, so they put a little extra weight on the bar, used bad form to try to lift, and
they suffered an injury.
You can also see this behavior with children who would sneak a cookie before
dinner and not get caught. Instead of being happy with the thrill of getting one
cookie, they go back for a second and a third and on the third cookie they hear
noises, they rush, and the cookies fall all over the ﬂoor and they get caught.
Greed is part of human nature and plays a role in everything we do, including
insider threat, and is usually one of the reasons someone gets caught.
The attacker starts e-mailing out one document a month to an outside account
and she gets away with it for a while.Then she starts doing it every week, then twice
a week, and starts thinking how easy it is because no one is looking at anything she
is doing and she slowly gets greedy to the point that someone notices and takes
action and she gets caught.
One of the cases I worked on, the insider was taking equipment home over
three-day weekends or when he was going to work from home so he could be as
productive as possible.The equipment contained sensitive information and was not
accessible from the Internet. So the company could either open up a big hole
www.syngress.com
Proﬁles of the Insider Threat • Chapter 8
315
341_INS_THR_08.qxd  11/20/05  2:59 PM  Page 315

through the ﬁrewall or, since they trusted this individual, they ﬁgured it was less of a
risk to let him take the equipment, so he could be productive.This continued for a
while and then the person started getting greedy. It got to the point where he would
leave with the equipment at eight in the evening and be back at work at seven in
the morning without the equipment and then two days later return with the equip-
ment.The reason the company agreed to let him take the equipment home was
because the person wanted to work from home. Clearly, if he is putting in 13-hour
days and leaving the equipment at home while he’s at work, something else is up.
They opened an investigation and found the person was giving the systems to a
competitor so they could image them, then he was bringing the systems back into
work. Now, as you will see, in many cases stupidity also plays a role, but the main
factor here was greed. If the attacker had just kept taking the equipment at a slow
rate, no one would have ever noticed.
One of the advantages to not having good protection against insider threat is
that it could possibly lure the attacker into a false sense of security. If attackers feel
that they have total control and can do whatever they would like with no chance of
being caught, there is a good chance they will get greedy and then you can catch
them. While this can work, this is not the ideal way to operate, because while the
person may eventually be caught, the amount of damage caused could be enormous.
The goal is to reduce the bleeding and in most organizations there is a strong cost-
beneﬁt incentive to catch the attacker much sooner in the process.
We mentioned earlier in this chapter that one of the indicators of the people
that are caught is other people knowing to some extent what was going on. One of
the reasons other people knew or found out is because the attacker started bragging.
Depending on the grade of the attacker, some insiders are doing it to get back at the
company, for personal recognition, or for pride.Therefore, if no one else knows that
it is happening, they are not getting full satisfaction out of the attack.Typically, the
high-end insider committing corporate espionage is more disciplined and will never
tell anyone.
Since bragging is something that could occur, it is critical that the rest of the
employees and trusted insiders at your organization understand the need to report
this information or let managers know if they see something is going on. In one
company I worked at, many of the people knew that a given employee was harming
the company because he would brag and forward e-mails but no one ever said any-
thing.After the person was ﬁred and we found this out I asked the other employees
why they did not say anything.They indicated they either thought we knew or they
did not think it was their place to say anything.After I explained to them that any-
thing that could cause monetary loss to the company could impact them directly
because if the company makes less money that could impact their bonuses, etc., and

Chapter 8 • Proﬁles of the Insider Threat
341_INS_THR_08.qxd  11/20/05  2:59 PM  Page 316

that as an employee of the company they have a right and obligation to watch out
for the company, most people understood.The other important follow-up is that the
trusted employees have to feel that they can have a conﬁdential conversation and
that it will not be made known that they were the ones who said something.You
never want to punish people who are doing the right thing and if they request that
you do not tell anyone that they told you, I recommend respecting that; otherwise,
no one will pass on information to you.
It is very important that there is a method for anonymous reporting to occur,
especially with regards to insider threat. I know some companies get frustrated with
this and demand that employees do what is in the best interest of the company and
without regard to remaining conﬁdential. While that is all well and good, you cannot
forget about human nature.You have to create an environment that takes advantage
of the fact that some attackers brag and make sure that when they do that you ﬁnd
out the information in a timely manner.
Another aspect that is tied with greed is, as people continue to perform attacks
and not get caught, they eventually get sloppy. For example, in the beginning of
launching an attack, the insider takes sensitive documents, uses stego to hide the
information, and sends it to an account that looks like his spouse’s or friend’s
account and even writes text in the message to make it look very legitimate.Then,
as time goes on, he starts getting sloppy and decides to stop using stego and stop
using cover text. Over time, the attacker essentially just starts attaching the sensitive
documents directly to e-mails and sending them out. I have even been involved in
one case where the attacker got so sloppy that he even started sending the docu-
ments directly to the competitor, which was easily traceable and how he was eventu-
ally caught.
I was involved in the investigation and it was amazing to see how this person
progressed in his attack methodology over time.The attacker started with a very
meticulous well-thought-out plan. If he had continued with that plan and stayed
diligent and never deviated, he would have never gotten caught. Knowing what I
know about the company in question, I know that they would never have been able
to ﬁnd or catch this attacker. Over time, he starting gaining so much conﬁdence and
thought that he was so good that he starting getting sloppy and taking chances that
he should not have been taking.The attacker’s view of the company decreased and
he thought their security was so bad and incompetent that he starting making the
justiﬁcation that there is no way possible that they would ever catch him and he
thought he was invincible, so he started to take more chances. He kept taking
chances that he should not have taken and his sloppiness increased to such a point
that he eventually got caught.

Proﬁles of the Insider Threat • Chapter 8
317
341_INS_THR_08.qxd  11/20/05  2:59 PM  Page 317

Once again, the fact that he got sloppy was the only reason the company was
able to catch him, so it was a good thing that the attacker got sloppy. However, I also
fault the company because this person’s care eroded over time and the company
should have caught him a lot sooner. If they had, they would have saved the com-
pany a signiﬁcant amount of money.
While we alluded to it when we talked about getting greedy and bragging, one
thing that also typically occurs is that the attacker becomes stupid and makes mis-
takes. It is usually tied into being sloppy, but no matter how good people are, they
will eventually make mistakes. Even the best quarterbacks in the NFL will eventually
fumble the ball.There is no such thing as perfect. Regardless the reason, people will
eventually make mistakes. In some cases, the mistakes could be accidental, and in
other cases, they could be intentional. If organizations are set up correctly, even with
very good high-end attackers, companies can still detect and ﬁnd when the attacker
does something stupid and makes a mistake. It does not happen often, but when it
does, it is a perfect opportunity to monopolize on the opportunity.
In another case I worked on, they had an insider that was planted at the com-
pany and worked there for more than ﬁve years.This attacker was so good the com-
pany would have never known and never suspected him. However, there was a day
when the organization the insider was ultimately working for really needed a piece
of information and the insider was getting very desperate and really needed to get
the information out. In hindsight, the attacker admitted it was a stupid thing to do,
but he e-mailed the sensitive document from his work account. His initial thought
was that he would only do it once and no one would notice. However, the company
had a ﬁltering system.The e-mail was ﬂagged by the system, investigated, and the
insider was caught.The attacker’s one stupid mistake ended a ﬁve-year run that
could have gone on for another ﬁve years.This is good news for us and bad news for
the attacker, but the bottom line is, eventually attackers will make stupid mistakes
and we have to be ready to catch them and take appropriate action.
Although the goal is to stop attackers and prevent them from causing any harm,
this is not practical across all attacks.There are some attacks that cannot be pre-
vented. Companies need to put policy, procedures, and detective measures in place so
that when attackers get greedy, brag, become sloppy and make mistakes, they can be
caught in a timely manner. While it would be better to stop attackers, detecting
them using the aforementioned measures is better than nothing.
High-End Proﬁle
We started off this chapter by looking at the proﬁle of known attackers. While that
provides a starting point, it might not paint an ideal picture of the high-end insider
www.syngress.com
318
Chapter 8 • Proﬁles of the Insider Threat
341_INS_THR_08.qxd  11/20/05  2:59 PM  Page 318

threat that is going to cause the most damage to your organization.Therefore, based
on experience and analysis, in this section we are going to present the proﬁle and
characteristics of the high-end attacker to give you an idea of their proﬁle and what
to look for to prevent the insider threat from harming your company.The following
are critical characteristics of the high-end insider threat proﬁle:
■
Hard worker
■
Quickly promoted
■
Leader
■
Dedicated
■
Trusted
■
Has special access
Disgruntled employees view their mission as an insider threat to be very short
lived.They want to cause disruption and move on to their next job. High-end
insiders see their position as an insider as a career and life decision. It is not short
lived in any way shape or form and in most cases their sole goal is your company
and to compromise and extract sensitive data for 30-plus years.The days of saying
that someone has worked here for 10 years, therefore they must be trusted, is no
longer valid. In large Fortune 50 companies it is worth the investment to have
someone act as a sleeper for three to ﬁve years before causing any harm or damage.
We also talked about the ultimate goal in some cases being to put the company out
of business. With the high-end attacker, the goal is to sustain the competitor.The
reason is simple, if I have a competitor and they are performing all this high-end
research and I am stealing the results, if they go out of business I will eventually go
out of business because I have no one to pay for my research.Therefore, I want that
company to stay around so I can keep taking advantage of their work to my ﬁnan-
cial beneﬁt and the best way to do that is to plant someone at the company.
While companies can recruit someone from inside a target company to perform
insider activities, the better method that is usually focused on at most companies is
to train someone, get him hired at the target company, have him get promoted, and
have him under your control the whole time.
Therefore, one of the ﬁrst characteristics is that the planted insider is usually a
very hard worker and the reason is simple.There is a direct correlation between hard
worker and trusted entity, which leads to more access. If a worker is lazy, if he
doesn’t get ﬁred, he is probably not going to be put on good projects or be given
much responsibility; therefore, the access he gets will be minimal. If the insider wants
to know the deepest, darkest secrets of the company, he needs to get put on the best

Proﬁles of the Insider Threat • Chapter 8
319
341_INS_THR_08.qxd  11/20/05  2:59 PM  Page 319

projects and be trusted with this data. While it is easier for an insider to steal infor-
mation than it is for an outsider, the easier method is to have the company give you
the access based on how hard you have worked for them.
If you are a hard worker, other characteristics will normally follow, the main one
being greater chance of being promoted. Once again, promotions feed right into the
hand of the inside attacker because the higher the position, the more control he has
over what is happening.Access is important, but control is even more important
because that not only gives the insider the chance to access information, but also the
possibility to modify information or perform other high-grade attacks.
Foreign governments or competitors who plant high-end insiders at your com-
pany do not just randomly pick people.There is a long process including personality
tests that are performed to enable the organization to pick just the right person who
will perform what they want but also be effective and inﬂuential in their position.
Therefore, a key characteristic is to be a natural-born leader.A leader can convince
people to do things a certain way and can in essence control a situation.The more
control an insider has, the better chance she has of obtaining access performing her job
as an insider. In some cases, one insider at a company is not enough. Based on the size
and the amount of data, a competitor might need multiple people to keep up with the
workload. Someone who is a leader would have a better chance of recruiting other
people within the organization to join the dark side and help him out.
Being a leader implies other natural characteristics: dedication and trust. Now, to
be fair, I should say implied dedication and implied trust.The ultimate dedication
and trust is to the company the insider is ultimately working for and who is paying
them off.The company who they are spying on should have an implied level of ded-
ication and trust, but since the attacker is ultimately stealing from that company, it is
false when you peel back the layers. Just on the surface it seems legitimate.
The more loyal and dedicated someone seems, the better the chance she will
have and an easier time of spying and covering up her tracks than if she were
thought to be suspicious and did not have the company’s best interest at heart.
Finally, as we have alluded to and stated several times, the key pivot point for the
insider is access.That is ultimately what they are after and what enables them to be
as effective as possible in accomplishing their mission. It should not come as a sur-
prise that usually the people who are inside attackers are in positions that require
special access. While it might seem coincidental, it is by design.Attackers carefully
plan out their career paths so they will be in a position to access sensitive informa-
tion and ideally even control the access to make it easier to cover up their tracks.
This section presented the critical attributes of the high-end insider threat.You
probably noticed as you were going through this section that many of them dovetail
with the list of attributes that you want in your ideal employee.This was something
www.syngress.com
320
Chapter 8 • Proﬁles of the Insider Threat
341_INS_THR_08.qxd  11/20/05  2:59 PM  Page 320

that was not purposely done but shows you the problem and why the problem of
insider threat will continue to get worse over time.The high-end person committing
these attacks looks and acts just like legitimate employees at your company.Actually,
the better the attacker, the more he is going to ﬁt the proﬁle of your best and ideal
employees.
This means that you can decide to hire only slackers and never run the risk of
having an insider, or you can be very careful to watch and control access, so you can
still discern the good from the bad even though they might have similar characteris-
tics in how they act and perform.
Categories of Inside Attacks
Based on the previous analysis, there are three general categories of insider threats
that could exist at your company. While every case is unique, the general categories
of people that will most likely cause harm from an insider perspective are the fol-
lowing:
■
Level 1 Self-motivated
■
Level 2
Recruited
■
Level 3 Planted
I used levels to describe the categories to show the potential for harm and the
danger that each one poses. While at the end of the day any of the three could cause
signiﬁcant monetary loss and potentially put the company out of business, the higher
the level, the more dangerous.
At the lowest level, you have the self-motivated attacker.This is the insider that
does not require any external motivation or incentive; they just decide for some
reason that they want to use their access to cause harm. While I have seen cases were
the self-motivated insider will start to extract secrets and try to sell them to the
highest bidder, this is not typical and in the cases I have seen they are not very good
at it. Most people that play in the corporate intelligence arena are very skeptical and
careful who they deal with and have connections that create the lifeblood of their
business. If an individual wakes up one morning and decides to sell corporate secrets,
there is a good chance he is not connected correctly and won’t be taken seriously.
Therefore, the most common form of level 1 or self-motivated insider is a disgrun-
tled employee that is out mainly for revenge and self satisfaction.
A level 2 attacker is someone who, on their own, does not decide to become an
insider threat, but are recruited and convinced by someone else to commit the
attacks. While recruited insiders would never have started to perform corporate espi-
www.syngress.com
Proﬁles of the Insider Threat • Chapter 8
321
341_INS_THR_08.qxd  11/20/05  2:59 PM  Page 321

onage on their own, they have weaknesses that an external entity took advantage of
to recruit them. We covered the motivators in a previous section, but the primary
motivator in most cases is money.
With a level 2 situation, it is risky for both sides initially. If someone approaches
an employee and offers to pay for company secrets, most people would be highly
suspicious.Therefore, it is usually a slower process that has to occur for both sides to
be comfortable. While this will work in some situations, the preferred method for
many entities is to just plant their own person.
Thus, the level 3 insider, in which an organization will ﬁnd someone, train him,
get him hired at the company, allow him time to get situated and earn trust, and
then start exploiting him for information, usually works better.
Types of Motivations
Many things may motivate an insider to turn to the dark side, but when all the anal-
ysis is performed on all the different cases, there are three motivators that appear
over and over again in almost every case and they are the following:
■
Financial
■
Political
■
Personal
Whether you like it or not or whether you are willing to admit it or not, money
is a very powerful thing and will cause people to behave in ways you never thought
possible.Therefore, it should not come as a big surprise that ﬁnancial motivation is a
key driving factor in insider threat cases.
Based on this, it should not come as a surprise that when organizations are
trying to recruit people to perform insider attacks for them, the one thing they look
for is people with ﬁnancial trouble or who enjoy a lifestyle that their current pay-
check cannot handle. By targeting people in this category, they know there is an
immediate need which could create a win-win situation for both sides.
Political views are another motivator that drives people. People feel very strongly
about political views and if an organization is working against those interests,
employees could have a strong reason to cause harm or want to cooperate with
people who are out to cause harm to the company.
In one situation there was a large research company who hired a new CEO.The
CEO decided to take the company in a different direction and perform research in
areas in which the net result was harmful to the environment. Everything the com-
pany was doing was legal; it just was not in the best interest of the environment.

322
Chapter 8 • Proﬁles of the Insider Threat
341_INS_THR_08.qxd  11/20/05  2:59 PM  Page 322

Because of the prior research the company had done, some pro-environmentalists
worked at the company and were very passionate about their beliefs. Instead of just
quitting, they felt it was their moral right to stop this from occurring.They ended
up launching a huge insider attack against the CEO and the new research areas. It
ended up causing the CEO to be ﬁred and almost put the company out of business.
Yes, the company did pursue legal proceedings, but the point is when your company
is on the edge of ﬁnancial ruin, lawsuits will not do a lot to help you.
The last motivator is personal.This can come in many shapes or sizes but usually
involves some form of blackmail.The attacking company ﬁnds someone with per-
sonal secrets that he does not want anyone to ﬁnd out about and threatens to reveal
the information if the person does not cooperate.This is a dangerous one and can
cause people to get into a lot of trouble and cause a lot of problems for the company
very quickly.This is one of the reasons why background checks and personal inter-
views are critical. If there is anything that someone has that they are ashamed about,
it is better to know about it and see how bad a risk it really is.This motivator is one
in which the person is usually put between a rock and a hard place. With the other
two motivators, the attackers are making a decision to knowingly cause harm to the
company. Either they need the additional money or they want to stand up for what
they believe in, but the decision is still theirs.
In the case of blackmail, the person is being forced into a decision that he does
not want to make. Either his entire life will be ruined or he will hurt the company
and he does not want to do either. While the person might be very loyal to the
company, most people would pick sacriﬁcing their company over ruining their lives.
Personal motivators can occur in one of two ways. In the ﬁrst way, the person
that wants to recruit you will dig deep into your past and try to ﬁnd out your
deepest, darkest secrets and then use them against you.They know that you have a
criminal background and will publicize it to all of your friends and co-workers
unless you cooperate.
The other way personal motivators work is to set you up.An entity that wants to
recruit you would target you and ﬁgure out that you are the person who needs to
perform an insider attack. However, you are ﬁnancially well off and do not need the
money.Therefore, they need to ﬁnd a personal reason to get you to cooperate.A
typical scenario is that they follow you to a bar one evening and have a very attrac-
tive person seduce you and entice you to go to a hotel or back to their place for a
one-night stance.You have had a hard week and a couple of drinks and they are able
to convince you to participate. During the events that follow, someone is ﬁlming and
taking detailed pictures.A week later someone else approaches you and asks you to
cooperate and if you refuse they say that they will send these pictures to your spouse
and at that point reveal the pictures that you had no idea were taken.This is why it

is very important to be careful what you do on your personal time because if you
are in a position of inﬂuence someone will try to use that against you.
Foreign Intelligence
While it has steadily been in the rise in recent years, a key area of heavy emphasis in
the past year is foreign governments actively engaging in corporate intelligence
against ﬁrms in other countries to give the local companies an economic advantage.
This is scary because with foreign governments getting more involved it is becoming
a different ball game. If a competitor is going to engage in corporate espionage, they
have to be careful because if it is ever publicized, it could look extremely bad for
them and actually cause more harm than good. So if a company is going to perform
corporate espionage, they will probably use freelance insiders who in essence sell the
critical IP of a company to the highest bidder.
However, foreign governments have completely different models and ﬁnancial
structures and in many cases if they get caught it does not matter. Since they have dif-
ferent incentives, are very well trained, and have large ﬁnancial backing, the chances
of them getting caught are slim, but the damage they can cause is huge. Know thy
enemy is a key principle in building any defensive model. It is important to realize
who your company could be up against, especially if they are a large company.
Unlike freelance insiders who want to steal critical IP and make money as soon as
possible. Foreign governments are willing to plant someone at a company for ﬁve to
ten years before they get any beneﬁt from that person.This means that there will be
no indication of the person’s true intent for three to ﬁve years and the only thing the
organization will see is a leader who works hard and is very dedicated.Then, once
they earn the company’s complete trust, they will use that for their own advantage.
While the threat landscape is always changing, this is an important enough
change to keep a close eye on. Because this method is very hard to track and is done
from a very deeply entrenched insider, once they are inside it is impossible to catch
them.
Stance
For your company, your executives need to decide what stance your organization is
going to take on insider threat.This is important in how you handle the cases and
what level of investigation you are willing to spend to run the problem to ground. It
is also important that whatever stance you take, that you clearly communicate it and
implement it in a consistent manner across your company.

For example, in the U.S. legal system and as a citizen of the U.S., you are pre-
sumed innocent until proven guilty. If someone or law enforcement wants to take
away your innocence, the burden of proof is on them to prove that you are guilty;
you do not have to prove your innocence.
However, this stance is not necessarily taken by all companies and all countries
for that matter. While as a citizen it is a very nice freedom, it can be costly to have
to prove guilt. Companies who have a large number of insider attacks can see that
the price tag in running every problem to the ground can be expensive.They ques-
tion the beneﬁt of spending a lot of money to prove someone is guilty only to ﬁre
them when they have enough proof. Instead, if they are suspicious of someone, they
just ﬁre him and hire someone else.This is very much an assumed guilty stance, but
from a monetary standpoint it is a more cost-effective measure for companies to
take. I am not saying that it is the right way to go and it can be very unfair if
someone is innocent and ﬁred; however, a company has to make business decisions
that its employees do not always like.
Therefore, it is important that companies have formal procedures and follow
them consistently across the company. Even if the measures are extreme, if they are
followed consistently, the company is usually protected. It is in cases where the com-
pany makes the decisions on the ﬂy and is inconsistent that they can get themselves
into a lot of legal trouble very quickly.
While it is more costly to prove guilt before action is taken, there is one situa-
tion were it is beneﬁcial and that is if prosecution is desired. If the company decides
that they want to pursue prosecution, then they need to have proof to win the case
and therefore they might be willing to let the person continue their actions while
they gather the needed evidence. However, this can be painful because, as you are
watching the person to get proof, they are causing harm to your organization.
A related scenario is if criminal actions were committed and the case is being
pursued by law enforcement. In this situation, your company is no longer running
the investigation and it is your company’s role to cooperate and provide assistance.
Your company might want to take one set of actions, but since it is a formal investi-
gation, you are at the mercy of law enforcement to make the ultimate call.

Summary
Proﬁling and catching an insider is not easy, but the more you know about their
proﬁle, how they act and how they operate, the easier it is to prevent and detect
them and minimize the overall loss to your company.As the saying goes, in order to
catch an attacker you have to think like an attacker.The more you understand their
characteristics, their motivators, and how they act, the better chance you have of
tracking them down.
Most often the people that are researching, analyzing, and catching the insiders
are within the security department and quite often have technical backgrounds.
There is an inherent danger associated with this. Since they are technical or have
technical backgrounds they tend to think the way techies think. However, many of
the attackers are non-technical, so you have to think out of the box in order to ﬁnd
and catch them. Instead of always thinking of high-tech solutions, think how a low-
tech person would solve the problem or how is could be solved without the use of
technology.
For example, I was working a case where we knew the individual was working
for a competitor but we could not prove it.Through many of the methods and tech-
niques outlined in this book, we were able to pinpoint the individual but we could
never catch the person red-handed.The company’s stance was that, because this was
a fairly senior person, the company wanted to be able to pursue legal action for all
the money the company lost due to this person’s actions. In order to be able to
pursue legal action, we needed proof.The problem was getting bad, so we were
working almost around the clock to catch this person. We were watching e-mail,
Web, and every form of electronic communication possible. We even had hidden
cameras to make sure the person was not taking the documents home with him and
we were coming up empty every time.
One evening we were working late and it was around two in the morning and I
was all out of ideas. I heard one of the phones ringing and I asked my colleague
whose phone it was. When I work late, if there is an emergency, I always want my
wife to me able to get in touch with me. Since no one calls at 2:00 A.M., I just
wanted to check and make sure it was not an emergency or my wife trying to track
me down.The person I was working with said it was probably the fax machine, that
the fax machine rang all day long and drove him crazy.At that point I jumped out of
my seat and said,“We got it!” I think the group I was working with thought I had
lost my mind.They couldn’t understand how the fax machine ringing could cause
me to ﬁgure out the problem. I said,“He is using the fax machine to get the data
out of the company.” We were so caught up in thinking within the box and looking
at technical solutions that we missed something as obvious as a fax machine. Sure

enough, when we pulled the log from the fax machine, there were numerous faxes
to our competitor and to the person’s home.The total page count across the two
exceeded 2,000 pages, and since the fax machine had memory, we were able to re-
create the faxes we needed and have the proof to close out the case.
Another reason that thinking out of the box is important is that most of us
would never think of causing harm to our company, so when we try to think of
how this would be done or think like an attacker, our mindset creates natural limits
because we could never imagine doing any of the things the person we are trying to
catch is doing.Therefore, it is sometimes very hard to dig deep enough or go far
enough out of the box to catch them.This is why understanding proﬁles of how
people operate is critical.The information can be used to make us much more effec-
tive at catching the insider threat.

Introduction
The biggest problem at most organizations is convincing management and execu-
tives that there is a problem. Hopefully, at this point in the book we have convinced
you of that point. If we hadn’t convinced you of that point, you probably would
have stopped reading way before this chapter, so making the argument again will do
little value.
Insider attacks are happening all the time even if companies do not realize it.The
problem with insider threat is that it cannot be prevented as with other attacks. If
someone is running a buffer overﬂow attack against your system, you can patch the
system and prevent the attack from occurring. If someone is connecting to your Web
server and exploiting port 80, you can close down port 80 or block it at the ﬁrewall
and stop the attack from occurring.Taking that logic, a simple way to stop the insider
threat is to remove all insiders.We all can see that is not a practical solution, though.
By removing all insiders, while it will effectively control insider threat, means your
company will go out of business, because no insiders means no employees and there is
no way you can run even a small company without some employees.
When we talk about prevention, we mean 100% prevention.Applying a patch
will 100% stop that speciﬁc vulnerability from occurring. However, insider threat is
much like resource-exhaustion denial-of-service attacks. While you can do things to
prevent certain types and minimize the damage, there is no way to 100% stop a
resource-exhaustion denial-of-service attack.The reason is that trafﬁc has to be
allowed to ﬂow and cutting off that trafﬁc will completely stop functionality. Insider
threat is very similar.Although some prevention measures are in place, there is no
100% way to prevent it because employees need to be allowed to have access to
resources so the company can function.
With insider threat, prevention is ideal but detection is a must.You try to do as
much as you can to prevent the attacks, but in cases where you cannot prevent the
attack, you have to make sure you detect it in a timely manner. Ideally, you would
like to stop a ﬁre from occurring in your house; however, if it does occur you want
to make sure you can detect it in a timely manner.That is why you install smoke
detectors.This raises a critical issue with detection.
Detection does minimal beneﬁt if someone does not respond.A smoke detector
will detect a problem but it will do nothing to put the ﬁre out. If no one responds,
the ﬁre will keep burning, which highlights a distinction between prevention and
detection measures.A preventive measure will prevent a problem with no interven-
tion or human involvement.A detective measure needs some intervention and it is
usually human based. Ideally we want to prevent problems but if we cannot, we need

Chapter 9 • Response: Technologies That Can Be Used to Control the Insider Threat

to deploy detective measures in such a way to make sure that a human will respond
in a timely manner to the problem or issue at hand.
Insiders must be allowed in your organization.The question is how you can
respond to the ever-growing threat of insiders attacking and stop them from
destroying your organization.This chapter will look at how you respond to the
problem of insider threat by looking at technologies and concepts that can be used to
control and limit the damage that insiders can perform. Ideally, you would prevent an
insider threat from occurring, but that is not always practical. In cases where it cannot
be prevented you want to control and limit the amount of damage that can occur.
Understanding and 
Prioritizing Critical Assets
It is very difﬁcult to protect something when you do not know what it is you are
trying to protect. What has so much value to your organization that is worth putting
time and energy into protecting? Not everything is worth protecting.At my house I
have a small statue in the front yard that I paid $50 for. If something happened to it I
would not be heartbroken. By having it in my front yard with no fence or other
protective measures, I am saying that this asset has very low value to me. I sure
would not leave a gold block worth millions in my front yard.The assets that I do
not care about protecting I will leave in my front yard; the assets that I want to pro-
tect, I will keep locked up in a safe. Really valuable assets, I would lock up at a bank.
In real life, based on our actions, we prioritize assets and determine the criticality
of items in our possession and we do this without even realizing it. However, in the
cyber sense, we do the opposite without even realizing it. We keep critical data and
critical assets available for anyone to compromise, copy, or delete and then we get
frustrated when we have an insider compromise them. If you took no energy to pro-
tect your information, how can you be upset when someone steals it?
The ﬁrst thing an organization has to do to control insider threat is to determine
the criteria that are used to determine value. Monetary worth, future beneﬁt to the
company, and competitive advantage are sample criteria that could be used.
Whatever the criteria are, they need to be determined ﬁrst. How can you say that
one asset is more critical than another asset if you do not have a criterion that is
used to make the determination?
Once you have the criteria determined, you then need to go through your orga-
nization and score all your assets according to the criteria. It is important to note
that not all criteria will be black and white.There could be some criteria that are
very subjective.This is why this exercise must involve the executives at the organiza-

331

341_INS_THR_09.qxd  11/21/05  12:58 PM  Page 331

tion. Only the person or people who are ultimately responsible for the success of the
company can truly determine the worth or score a given asset should get. If you do
not believe me, try this simple exercise. Go up to the VP of sales and ask him to
score the assets in the company. I can guarantee you that all the sales-related assets
will be scored high and all the other assets will be scored low. If you try this with
multiple directors or VPs, you will see this trend continue.
After all your assets are scored, you need to prioritize them based on the criteria.
After you are done with this portion, you should have a list of all the critical assets
across your organization.These assets represent the crown jewels of your organization
and need to be properly protected. Once the list of assets has been determined and
you know the critical assets that need to be protected, ask yourself what you are pro-
tected from.This is where threat analysis comes into the picture.Threat represents
possible damage and is the point of compromise for a given asset. Understanding the
likely attack points and how an attacker would compromise the asset is the Know
Thy Enemy portion of the equation.A valuable lesson on insider threat can be
learned from The Art of War by Sun Tzu.A key passage from it states:
If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the
result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not your
enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you
know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every
battle.
Translating into our terms, you need to know your critical assets and know the
risk to your critical assets in order to be properly protected against insider threat.
Deﬁning Acceptable Level of Loss
Understanding and knowing what an organization’s critical assets are is important,
but being able to deﬁne acceptable level of loss is just as important so appropriate
measures can be developed. No matter what you do, you have to be willing to
accept some level of loss. Risk is all about understanding what an acceptable level of
loss is and building defense mechanisms around it. While on paper this concept
makes sense, it is often a difﬁcult one for executives to understand.
If you ask an executive what level of loss they are willing to accept, most will
answer none. However, even if it was possible to build security measures in such a
way that there was no loss, it would be cost prohibitive to do and clearly not prac-
tical.There is always the possibility of loss and the sooner we can change our
mindset to understand that, the better off we will be.

There was once a king who lived in a castle and this king was very paranoid. He
started getting concerned that the people who worked for him were trying to steal
from him, cause him harm, and potentially kill him. (See, even kings had problems
with the trusted insider.) He decided that the potential loss was so great that he took
his faithful servant who he trusted and the king went and locked himself in a cave in
the middle of the woods. No one knew about the cave or knew that the king was
there except his servant.The king thought this would remove all risk and take away
any potential for loss.The door to the cave was locked from the outside and the
only person who had the key was the servant.The servant would come four times a
day to bring the king food and check on the king.
Many years later when people were exploring the woods they found a locked
cave with a dead king inside.After two weeks of being locked in the cave, when his
servant was coming to deliver food, the servant had a heart attack and died. Since no
one else knew where the king was, the king starved to death inside the cave. While
at the beginning of the story it seemed like the king was reducing all risk, he actu-
ally increased his risk by creating a single point of failure.The king would have been
much happier and lived a longer life, if he had just accepted some risk and, for really
high-risk items, performed proper risk mitigation.
The possibility for loss is all around us and risk management becomes a driving
factor in determining what efforts should be focused on by an organization and
what can be ignored.As difﬁcult as it may seem for all critical assets, an acceptable
level of risk needs to be deﬁned.This will help an organization focus on what
should or should not be done with regards to insider threat.
Cost-beneﬁt analysis is a typical method of determining acceptable level of risk.
The general premise behind cost-beneﬁt analysis is determining what the cost is if
the asset is lost in part or in whole versus what the cost is to prevent that loss from
occurring. While this is hard for some people to swallow, there are actually many sit-
uations where it is more cost effective to do nothing about the risk than to try to
prevent or reduce the risk from occurring.
Typically, there are two methods to deal with potential loss: prevention and
detection. Preventive measures are typically more expensive than detective measures.
With a preventive measure you stop the risk from occurring. With detective mea-
sures you allow the loss to occur, but detect it in a timely manner to reduce the time
period in which the loss occurs. Deﬁning an acceptable level of loss will enable an
organization to determine whether they should implement preventive or detective
measures.
If your acceptable level of loss is low, which means you have a very low toler-
ance for a loss to a given asset, a preventive measure would be more appropriate to

Response: Technologies That Can Be Used to Control the Insider Threat • Chapter 9
333
341_INS_THR_09.qxd  11/21/05  12:58 PM  Page 333

stop the loss.You would have to be willing to spend the extra money on appropriate
preventive measures.
If your acceptable level of loss is high, this means you have a higher tolerance
and would most likely spend less money on a solution and implement detective
measures. Now you are allowing the loss to occur but you are controlling and
bounding it.
Therefore, performing calculations on acceptable level of loss plays a critical role
in controlling the insider threat.
Controlling Access
After you determine what your critical assets are and your acceptable level of risk,
the best method for controlling the insider threat is limiting and controlling access.
In almost every situation in which an insider compromise occurs, it is usually
because someone had more access than they needed to do their job.There are usu-
ally other factors at play but the number one factor is properly controlling access.
Based on this, it should not be a surprise that one of the number one recommenda-
tions that I make in terms of securing an organization is Principle of Least Privilege.
This principle states that you give someone the least amount of access they need to
do their job. Some key parts of this principle are that you allow people to do their
jobs but take away all other access. Figure 9.1 illustrates how access is often granted
at most organizations.
Figure 9.1 Granting Access

Chapter 9 • Response: Technologies That Can Be Used to Control the Insider Threat
341_INS_THR_09.qxd  11/21/05  12:58 PM  Page 334

Usually, the access that someone has contains at least 35% more access than
what is actually needed to perform their job function. Most compromises are
caused by someone using that additional 35%, which means if we took away the
access that is not needed, we would also be limiting the number of compromises
because we would be taking away the access that is utilized to cause harm.
Ideally, an organization should roll out a new system or network and implement
least privilege from the very beginning; however, we know that is not practical.
While not ideal, performing least privilege after the fact actually has some hidden
beneﬁt. Since least privilege is taking away access someone does not need, if the
person is performing their job and doing what they are supposed to, they will not
notice. So the ﬁrst piece of good news is that least privilege can be implemented
without impacting job performance or functionality at all. Second, by implementing
a principle of least privilege across your organization, you can actually help catch or
reduce the insider threat. If you go in and implement least privilege, taking away the
extra access that someone does not need and they scream or question why that
access has been removed, you now have a suspect. If you are taking away access they
did not need to do their job and they noticed or complained, it meant they were
using that extra access. Now the question is if someone is only performing legiti-
mate functions, why were they using the extra access? The answer is, they were using
the extra access outside the realm of their job and potentially causing harm to your
organization.
Bait: Honeypots and Honeytokens
A typical way you would catch something is to set a trap. If you have a mouse in
your house, you would set a mouse trap to capture the mouse. Even a mouse is not
stupid enough to blindly go into a trap, so you have to put bait on the trap to lure
them in.The bait must be carefully selected to be something that you know the
mouse is after.A good way to ﬁgure out what the mouse is after is to ask why the
mouse is in your house in the ﬁrst place. In this case, the reason is usually for food.
So if you bait the trap with food, especially food that mice like, you have a good
chance the mouse will go after the bait, be lured into the trap, and caught.
Just like a mouse is a pest in your house, an insider threat is a pest within your
organization that needs to be caught. Most insiders are after information, so if you
set a trap where you bait them with information that seems important, you have a
good chance of catching them.These traps are often referred to as honeypots and
honeytokens. Both are traps that are set.The difference is one is set at the system
level and one is set at the ﬁle level.

A honeypot is a system that is put on your network that has no legitimate func-
tion. It is set up to look attractive to attackers and lure them in.The key thing about
a honeypot is that there is no legitimate use for it, so no one should be accessing it.
If someone accesses the honeypot in any way, they are automatically suspicious
because the only way they could have found it is if they were wandering around
your network looking for something of interest. If they were only doing what they
were supposed to, they would have never found the system.
For those familiar with honeypots this might seem like a slightly different concept
or different use. Most people think of honeypots as being deployed externally.While
that is traditionally how they have been deployed, internal honeypots also play a key
role in the defense in depth arsenal.The big advantage of internal honeypots over
external honeypots is reduced liability.The problem with an external honeypot on
your DMZ is a honeypot is meant to lure in attackers. Since there are a ton of
attackers on the Internet, in essence you are making your site more attractive to them
and pulling them into your DMZ.This is not usually a good thing to do. However,
with internal honeypots it has a different effect. On your internal network there ideally
should be no attackers and if there are there should only be a small number of them.
Therefore, putting in a system that will lure attackers when there is only supposed to
be a small number is a positive thing. In will help ﬁnd the needle in the haystack and
focus in on the most likely targets of insider threat.A great example of this is scanning.
Port scanning and vulnerability scanning is a norm on the Internet and is happening
all the time. If you deploy an external honeypot you are going to see this activity and
it should be treated as noise. However, scanning should only be done by authorized
people on your internal network and deﬁnitely should not be treated as a norm.
Therefore, if your internal honeypot sees any scanning occurring from a non-autho-
rized host, it should immediately set off an alert.Although there are other ways to per-
form insider threat beyond scanning, if you seeing someone violating the policy and
doing things they are not supposed to do, this is usually a good indicator that you have
a problem on your hands. If someone is going to violate security policies and try to
ﬁnd vulnerabilities on a network, they are more likely going to be an insider threat or
are more likely to be lured to the dark side.
Some people criticize honeypots for various reasons but most of those reasons
no longer apply when you are talking about internal honeypots. One of the biggest
issues honeypots raise is that of entrapment.Technically, it is not because entrapment
can only be done by law enforcement. If I pull up to you at a light in my sports car
and start revving my engine and when the light turns green we starting speeding
down the highway, and since I drive that road a lot I know that there is usually a
police car over the hill, so I purposely slow down and let you ﬂy by me and as you
go over the hill you get caught in a speed trap and pulled over, when you are being
www.syngress.com
336
Chapter 9 • Response: Technologies That Can Be Used to Control the Insider Threat
341_INS_THR_09.qxd  11/21/05  12:58 PM  Page 336

handed the ticket you cannot claim entrapment. Maybe stupidity, but not entrap-
ment. On the other hand, if I pull up to you at a light and we take off racing at the
light and we get to 80 mph and I slow down, pull behind you, and put on my lights
because I am in an unmarked police car, now you have a chance of claiming entrap-
ment. In the case of honeypots, especially internal honeypots, since it is being set up
by your company and law enforcement is not involved, entrapment does not even
come into play.
I always thought the big issue with honeypots was liability.You set up something
vulnerable on purpose, and someone uses your system as a client in a DDOS attack.
A honeypot is an entire system that has no legitimate value on the network but to
lure in attackers. While scanning efforts will be caught, your higher-end insider
threat usually will not be caught by a honeypot because there is nothing to lure
them in. Real data and real business process is what is attractive and in many cases
they will be able to tell that it does not contain the critical IP or anything of high
worth.Therefore, a popular variant of honeypots that have evolved are honeytokens.
Honeytokens take the concept of honeypots and scale it down.
A honeytoken works the same way as a honeypot, but instead of being an entire
system, it is done at a directory or ﬁle level.You put an attractive ﬁle on a legitimate
server and if anyone accesses it, you just caught them with their hand in the cookie
jar.This usually has a higher pay off. Insiders are really good at ﬁguring out a certain
system or even a certain directory that contains critical IP for the company. If you
add an additional ﬁle to the system or directory, there is a high chance someone
might stumble across it. Once again, since this is not a legitimate ﬁle, no one should
be accessing it.There is no speculation involved if someone accesses the honeytoken
ﬁle.They are clearly up to no good since there is no reason anyone should be
accessing it.Therefore, setting them up correctly, honeytokens can enable you to set
up a virtual mineﬁeld on your critical systems. If you are a legitimate user and know
the ﬁles you are supposed to access, you can easily navigate the mineﬁeld and not set
off any mines. However, if you are an insider trying to cause harm, there is a good
chance you will be tempted by a honeytoken, misstep, and set off a mine.
The important thing to remember with any of these techniques is that they are
not 100% foolproof. But if each method increases your security, by putting them
together you have a robust solution.
Die Pad for Data
In many situations, when you are looking for solutions to a given problem, you do
not have to reinvent the wheel. Most likely part of the problem has already been
solved in another domain and if you look carefully enough you can apply a solution

from a different domain to the current problem you are trying to solve. When
dealing with insider threat, you are trying to limit, control, stop, or detect informa-
tion from leaving your organization.
A domain that has a related problem is the banking industry.Talking at a very
abstract level, one of the problems that banks have is to prevent someone from
stealing their money and if they cannot prevent the bank robbery, being able to ﬁnd
out who stole the money is the next best thing. One solution that banks (use to)
utilize to try to detect potential banker robbers is called a die pad. It is a very basic
but effective technique. While it is an effective technique, based on the new tech-
niques of robbery, die pads are no longer common practice. However, they teach us a
valuable lesson that can be applied to insider threat.
At banks, there is a stack of money that is properly wrapped and looks like all
the other money at the bank.The idea is that if someone comes in to rob the bank
they would steal this stack of money along with the rest. Or if the robber was
holding a teller at gun point he/she would put this stack of money in the bag.
On the surface, there would be nothing about this stack of money that looked
unusual. However, when the robber went back to his hideout and unwrapped the
money, there would be a pressurized canister of ink that would explode and cover
the person in permanent ink. Now in a small town if a certain person was covered
in ink, it would be pretty obvious that he was the one who stole the money.As I
stated early, while this might no longer be scalable for banks, the general concept
applies to insider threat.
The idea is to add something that is not correct but insigniﬁcant to a document
or a piece of data and if it gets revealed you can trace back who the insider was.The
trick with a digital die pad is to add something to a document that is not correct so
there is no chance that it could have accidentally appeared, but on the other hand it
should not change the accuracy of the document or cause any potential harm to the
organization.Therefore, there is a ﬁne art of creating an insigniﬁcant inaccuracy that
could be traced back to either a group of people or a single individual.
An example of how this could be used is with a book publishing company that
publishes electronic books.A big problem today is one person buying the electronic
book and then violating the copyright and posting it to the Web for anyone to
download. In this particular case, you would know it was someone who bought the
book that was doing this, but if you sold 5,000 copies, how do you pinpoint who it?
The trick is with each version of the book that is sold, you introduce a unique inac-
curacy.After the book gets pirated and available publicly, the publisher would look
through a series of errors and when it found one that matched, they would know
which person’s version of the book violated the copyright and therefore which indi-
vidual to go after. Examples of errors that could be used include a double period

after a sentence on a given page or any extra space between sentences.These are
examples of minor changes that would not take away from the reader’s experience,
but provide tracking capability.
The big advantage of the digital die pad is that people would not know that
they are being tracked. With the traditional ink example, if you look in the mirror
and your face is blue you know there is a problem. In this case, even if the person
knew that the organization was using a digital die pad, ﬁnding it could be almost
impossible.
The problem with a digital die pad is in an ideal sense, it has to be unique for
each person; otherwise, the accountability is not present.
Mole Detection
Mole detection, while similar to the die pad idea, is slightly different. With a die pad,
in essence you are hiding something within a piece of data so you can trace it back
to the person who compromised the information. With mole detection, you are
giving a piece of data to a person and only that person and if that information
makes it out into the public domain, you know you have a mole.
If you suspect that someone is a mole you could “coincidentally” talk about some-
thing within ear shot of him and if you hear it repeated somewhere else, you know he
was the mole. Mole detection is not technically sophisticated but can be useful in
trying to ﬁgure out who is leaking information to the public or to another entity.
To show the effectiveness of this method, this was used on a recent insider threat
case that I worked on.An attempted coup was made at a medium-sized company
that failed and the people attempting the coup were ﬁred. However, information was
still leaked out to them and the people that were ﬁred put up a Web site in which
they posted information about the company.After internal-only meetings, informa-
tion from those meetings would appear on the Web site, so we knew we had a
sleeper or a mole inside the organization.As part of the process to put everyone at
ease, the company held meetings with each department. What I started doing was to
have the executive tell different stories and anecdotes in each of the meetings and
then watched the Web site of the ex-employees.After doing this we quickly knew
that someone from department x was the mole. Without their knowledge we then
slowly targeted smaller groups from that department. If we saw four of them go to
the lunch room, we would happen to have a conversation that they could overhear
and we would wait to see what happened.After doing this several times, we were
able to narrow down the three moles and terminate their employment. Not high
tech but it got the job done.

Proﬁling
An ideal way to control and detect the insider is by understanding behavioral pat-
terns.At the end of the day the behavior patterns of someone who is performing
their job legitimately versus someone who is committing insider threat is going to
be different. While they might seem very similar on the surface they have to deviate
at some point since one is causing harm and the other one is not causing harm. It is
at these deviation points that an inside attacker can be tracked and caught.The trick
is being able to understand and ﬁgure out what those patterns are.
A common way of understanding behavior and looking for deviations is pro-
ﬁling. Proﬁling is not a new area of research and has been around for a long time.
Law enforcement typically enrolls the help of criminal proﬁlers who understand
how certain types of criminals act and behave to be able to determine who is a
potential suspect or who the ultimate criminal was in a particular case. While pro-
ﬁling has value, it is not perfect and there are always potential ways around it.
With insider threat proﬁling you are creating cyber proﬁles.You are creating
time and motion parameters to be put in place to understand what legitimate
behavior is and what goes outside of the norm.To do basic, generic proﬁling, proﬁles
need to be created for a user or group of users.A simple example would be for the
call center for a major credit card company. For a credit card call center you have
people answering the phones who can access credit card numbers. Clearly this leaves
the door wide open for insider threat. What stops someone from going into the
database, extracting all the credit card numbers, and either using them for personal
gain or selling them to the highest bidder. One solution is proﬁling. Call statistics
can be gathered to determine that the average call desk employee can take 20 calls
per hour and for an average call they have to access two credit card numbers.This
means over the course of an hour a single operator would access between 30 and 40
credit card numbers.A proﬁle has been created that, spread out over the course of an
hour, 30 to 40 credit card accounts will be accessed.
If a given person accesses 30 credit cards within a three-minute period, it would
set off a ﬂag. If someone accessed 300 credit cards in a given hour, that would also
set off a ﬂag. By looking at this simple example, you can see that this is not fool-
proof. Proﬁling provides some level of protection but it is not perfect. For example,
attackers could perform a low and slow attack where they access one to two credit
cards every three to ﬁve minutes and continue this attack for eight hours a day for
40 days, thus gathering a signiﬁcant number of credit card numbers.This type of
attack would ﬁt within the proﬁle and not be ﬂagged.Additional proﬁling could be
created to help thwart this, but you can quickly see how we would get into a cat-
and-mouse game if we are not careful.

341_INS_THR_09.qxd  11/21/05  12:58 PM  Page 340

Defeating proﬁling is one concern, but catching legitimate hardworking
employees is another potential problem. What happens if an organization has a very
hard worker who spends a lot of time in the ofﬁce and they ﬁgure out a way to
handle a call every minute? This worker is accessing 60 credit cards per hour and this
would set off a ﬂag. If a company is not careful, the message this is sending to the
employee is, if you work too hard you will be ﬂagged.This, however, creates a more
serious problem, which is you are tipping your hand to what you are looking for. If
an employee has a very successful day and answers 60 calls and their boss questions
it, this immediately tells the employee that proﬁling is being performed. If they pass
the word on to other people, every employee with know that if you go above 40
accesses in an hour it will be ﬂagged.Anyone who is going to commit insider threat
will quickly know how to defeat being caught and lay low.
It becomes very tricky to create proﬁles that can still work even if people know
about them. One answer is to keep the proﬁles secret, but the longer you use them
and people get caught by them the greater the chance that people will ﬁnd them
out. Once people know that proﬁling is being performed, it will act as an immediate
deterrent. However, as they quickly learn ways around it, the usefulness of the mea-
sures will be defeated.A good example to illustrate this is Web surﬁng and moni-
toring. Many organizations have a problem with people surﬁng to inappropriate
sites. If organizations are monitoring this behavior, if the company announces that
they are now going to monitor everyone’s Web access, you will see the number of
people going to inappropriate sites drop signiﬁcantly.After a little time you will see
it starting to creep up, where people test out the bounds of the monitoring. In the
worse case, if people continue to their normal level of inappropriate surﬁng and
nothing happens, over a three-to-six-month period you will now see the level of
inappropriate surﬁng back to the original level because everyone realized it was a
false claim. However, if people start surﬁng and get caught, how they got caught will
spread, and as people ﬁgure out ways around it, this knowledge will also spread
across the organization.
Therefore, with any measure, but especially proﬁling, it is critical that you under-
stand the effectiveness of the methods you are deploying.Another method that helps
solve the above problem is to have many types of proﬁling that is performed and rotate
them on a random basis.Yesterday if someone did x they did not get caught, but today
when they did they got caught.This unpredictable type of proﬁling will usually keep
the attacker and people who are trying to bypass the system on their toes.
There are two general types of proﬁling that can be performed: individual and
group. Individual proﬁling is tied to a speciﬁc person and how they operate. Every
person is unique, so individual proﬁling will learn the pattern of normality for a
given individual and if it falls outside of that norm that person is ﬂagged.The advan-

Response: Technologies That Can Be Used to Control the Insider Threat • Chapter 9
341
341_INS_THR_09.qxd  11/21/05  12:58 PM  Page 341

tage of this method is that it more closes matches to an individual and is more cus-
tomized to how a single individual acts.The problem is that it changes with the
person so if the attacker knows that individual proﬁling is being performed and
makes slow, minor adjustments to their behavior they could slip through the system.
For example, if I logged into the network between 7:00 A.M. and 8:00 A.M.
every day and logged out at 8:00 P.M. every evening, this would create a proﬁle that
would be tracked. If a given day I logged in at 2:00 P.M., it would set off a ﬂag.This
is a very simple example so it might not seem practical, but it is meant to illustrate
the point. However, if I knew proﬁling was being performed, for a week I would log
in at 8:05 A.M., then a week later I would log in at 8:10 A.M., etc. If I slowly
changed my behavioral patterns, I would be able to bypass the proﬁling, because as I
made minor adjustments over a long period of time my proﬁle would adapt and
change to that new behavior.
Group proﬁling is tied to averages of how a group of people in a similar job 
perform.
Instead of proﬁling a single person, you would take a group of people who per-
form similar functions and create a proﬁle based on how the group performs as a
whole.The advantage of this method is that a single person cannot skew the results
and it is easy to calculate. Even if a single person tries to slowly change their
behavior, if the group maintains the norm, then that person’s behavior will have little
bearing on the overall proﬁle.The disadvantage is that it assumes everyone has sim-
ilar if not identical patterns within the group and anyone within the group who is
an outlier would be ﬂagged.
Monitoring
While proﬁling has beneﬁt, there is also a lot of required effort that needs to be put
against the problem in order to solve it. Instead of jumping directly towards pro-
ﬁling, many organizations decide to start off with a more passive method: moni-
toring. Monitoring is easy to do and provides a starting point for proﬁling. With
monitoring you are just watching behavior. In watching the behavior you could
inspect the information either manually or automatically but you are looking for a
speciﬁc signature in the information you are monitoring. In order to proﬁle a given
person and ﬂag exceptional behavior, you have to perform monitoring as the base.
Therefore, in many cases, it is better to start with monitoring to see how bad the
problem is and then move toward proﬁling if that is deemed necessary at a later
point in time.
Before an organization performs monitoring, it is critical that they do it in a
legal and ethical manner. From a legality standpoint, it is critical that an organization

342

determines whether information has an implied expectation of privacy. If something
such as e-mail or Web is determined to have an implied expectation of privacy, that
expectation must be taken away prior to monitoring. While taking away an expecta-
tion of privacy might seem like a big hurdle, it can easily be achieved with a well-
executed security policy.A security policy can take away the expectation of privacy
so that everyone knows that their activity can be monitored and acted upon. In
addition to taking away the expectation of privacy, it is important that an organiza-
tion performs monitoring in a consistent, fair manner across the organization. Ideally,
all methods and processes for performing monitoring across the organization should
be written down in procedures that everyone follows in a consistent manner. If it is
written down, there is less chance for misunderstanding than if it is verbal. If you do
not believe me that the written word has less chance of being misunderstood or
changed, then I suggest you play the telephone game with your co-workers. I can
guarantee you that if you say something about how monitoring should be per-
formed to one co-worker and they tell someone, who tells someone, who tells
someone, after ﬁve to six people, what the last person says and what you said will
always be different.
Different types of monitoring can be performed:
■
Application-speciﬁc
■
Problem-speciﬁc
■
Full monitoring
■
Trend analysis
■
Probationary
Application-speciﬁc monitoring focuses on looking at a speciﬁc application for
potential signs of abuse.The two applications that typically top the list are e-mail and
Web. Many people send inappropriate e-mail or attach content that should not be
sent out of the company. Monitoring all e-mail trafﬁc can give a good indicator of
potential problems. E-mail monitoring, just because of the wide range of informa-
tion and material, is usually done with some manual methods. Web monitoring is
focused more on people wasting time or going to inappropriate sites.Typically, these
sites can just be ﬂagged or blocked so in most cases Web-based monitoring is done
with more automated methods.
Organizations will have problems or issues that pop up from time to time.
Monitoring might be performed to reduce or get a handle on the problem. One of
my clients was having a problem with employees running hacker tools on their net-
work. It started off as one or two people just playing around and quickly turned into

competitions and was impacting network performance and job performance.To get
a handle on this problem, they started monitoring for people using and running
these tools and took disciplinary action against people who were not following the
policy.
Full monitoring is where all information or trafﬁc is monitored.This is the most
comprehensive method of monitoring but is also the most time consuming.
Typically, when full monitoring is performed, it is usually passively gathered and only
analyzed if there is a problem down the road.The general philosophy behind full
monitoring is it is better to have the information and not need it, than to need the
information and not have it. Usually if an organization is performing full moni-
toring, it is in conjunction with another method.A great combination is problem
monitoring with full monitoring.The full monitoring will gather all the data and
then where there is a problem, the full dump can be monitored to see where the
problem is and take appropriate action.This is an example where it is easier to take
too much data and whittle it down, than to take too little data and magically create
the information you need.
Trend analysis is an analytical capability that is usually tied into full monitoring.
With full monitoring, you would capture every packet on the network. With trend
analysis you would just show the high-level trends leaving out all the details.Then,
once you ﬁnd a problem, you can dig into the details.To show you the power of
trend analysis, look at the following example.

By looking at the preceding binary dump, can you tell me where the problem is
or what packet you should look at to ﬁnd additional information? You probably
can’t. Now look at Figure 9.2.

Figure 9.2 Trend Analysis
Looking at Figure 9.2, can you tell where the problem is? Clearly, doing trend
analysis makes it very easy to be able to spot the high-level trends and look for
problems and ﬁgure out where to go for further analysis.
The last type of monitoring is probationary monitoring. Probationary moni-
toring usually has to be tied with a strong security policy or monitoring procedures
to be effective. If someone does not follow the policy and is put on probation, you
want to watch their actions more carefully. In these cases, anyone who has violated a
policy or performed an action that is suspicious will be watched and monitored.
Anomaly Detection
Anything that is not normal or is out of the ordinary could potentially be a
problem. Just because something is not normal does mean it is a problem, but it usu-
ally means that further analysis should be performed. Hopefully in your organization
insider threat is not a norm.Therefore, in order to commit an insider attack,
someone will have to do something that is not normal. Hopefully, if the detection
piece is done correctly, the person is ﬂagged, follow-up work is performed, and the
insider is caught before signiﬁcant damage is caused.
While anomaly detection does work, it is not as easy as it sounds. First, in order
to be able to say something is an anomaly, you have to be able to deﬁne what nor-
mality is.This can be very difﬁcult to determine, depending on the organization and
the speciﬁc area you are talking about. Normality is constantly changing at most
organizations and what is normal today might not be normal tomorrow.The trick to

346
Chapter 9 • Response: Technologies That Can Be Used to Control the Insider Threat
341_INS_THR_09.qxd  11/21/05  12:58 PM  Page 346

doing this correctly is to be able to distinguish between static and dynamic behavior
and patterns.A static behavior is something that stays the same for a long period of
time and a dynamic behavior is constantly changing. For example, when people go
to meetings is a very dynamic process. Just because I have a meeting today at 1:00
P.M. does not mean I will have a meeting tomorrow at 1:00 P.M. If you try to do
anomaly detection on dynamic behavior you will constantly get false results.
Static behavior is more constant and usually is tied to more critical assets. For
example, the people who can issue payroll are probably pretty constant.There might
be some turnover in the department, but it does not happen that often. So if only
three people in the company should be accessing payroll data, that is static behavior
and is perfect for anomaly detection. If anyone outside of those three people try to
access payroll, it should set off a ﬂag and the chances that this is a malicious insider
are probably fairly high.
When talking about anomalies, it is important to compare and contrast anomalies
and malicious behavior. Some people use these words interchangeably, but that is a
very dangerous practice. Just because something is not normal does not mean it is
malicious.Things are constantly changing, and just because something is different than
it was yesterday does not necessarily mean the activity is malicious or will cause harm.
On the other hand, just because something is malicious does not mean it is anomalous.
File access is normal and happening all the time, but if I go in and access a ﬁle and
give it to a competitor, that is malicious, but probably won’t be ﬂagged as anomalous.
While both are important terms, be careful to use them appropriately in the
realm of insider threat.
Signature Analysis
Signature analysis is a basic but effective measure for controlling insider threat or any
malicious activity. Signature analysis is also called pattern analysis because you are
looking for a pattern that is indicative of a problem or issue. Someone walking
around your neighborhood with a ski mask on carrying a gun is a signature of mali-
cious activity and if you saw this signature you most likely would call the police
immediately. If you pick the signatures correctly, you have a high chance of catching
malicious behavior.The drawback, however, is there could be other variants or forms
of that malicious behavior that would not ﬁt that pattern. Someone wearing a ski
mask and carrying a gun is an extreme pattern of someone who is going to rob a
house.There are many other people who are going to rob a house that would not ﬁt
that pattern.Therefore, only looking for that pattern yields a high chance that attacks
would be missed.

The problem with signatures is that you must know about an attack in order to
create a signature for it.The ﬁrst time an attack occurs it will be successful because
you will not have a signature.After it is successful and you perform incident response
and damage assessment you can ﬁgure out how the attack occurred and build an
appropriate signature the next time. However, if the next time the attacker changed
the attack slightly, the signature might miss the attack again.
This brings up two important points with regards to signatures. First, they will
only catch known attacks; they will not catch zero day attacks.A zero day attack is a
brand new attack that has not been publicized and is not well known. Second, signa-
tures are very rigid. If you have a signature for an attack and it occurs the exact same
way each time, you will be able to detect it and ﬂag it. However, if it is morphed or
changed there is a good chance the signature will no longer be effective.
The last problems with signatures is that they take a default allow stance on
security.A default allow stance says we will list what is malicious and anything else
that falls through will be ﬂagged as good. By itself, signature detection says if you see
a signature that is bad behavior but there is not a signature match, then the behavior
must be good.This is illustrated in Figure 9.3.
Figure 9.3 A Default Allow Security Stance
Clearly this has limitations and highlights the point that if there is not an exact
signature for the given behavior, the attack will be missed.A better way to imple-
ment security is by using a default deny stance. Default deny states that anything that
is not explicitly allowed is denied.Anomaly detection is more robust in that it takes

a default deny stance with regards to security. It says that it will determine every-
thing that is normal and anything that does not match a normal pattern is classiﬁed
as an attack.This is illustrated in Figure 9.4.
Figure 9.4 A Default Deny Security Stance
In this case you can see that with anomaly-based protection you achieve a more
robust approach to the problem.
While signatures and anomaly detection are not perfect, they do have their value
and can be useful when combined with other methods for controlling the insider
threat.
Thin Clients
There are many factors that lead to the ease with which an attacker could commit
an insider attack across the organization, but one key factor is local storage and
portability of information.A laptop, while a very powerful tool for employees and
mobile workers, is also a very powerful tool for someone who is trying to commit
an insider attack. Why would an attacker try to send data across the network or use
advanced techniques like stego when he can just walk out the front door with his
laptop and then do whatever he likes with the information? A potential for reducing
the liability is to remove the problem.
A technology that was used in the early days of computing has proven valuable
again. In the early days, when they were connected to mainframes, they were called

dumb terminals. Now, when they are connected to servers to better control systems
and reduce the chance of insider threat, they are called thin clients.A thin client is a
system without a hard drive and in some cases without a USB drives or other
writable drive.Thin clients connect to the network and everything, including the
desktop image and all software, is automatically downloaded to their system. Since
there is no hard drive, nothing is stored locally. When you shut down the thin client
nothing is kept locally and anything that has not been saved to the server is lost. It
does not matter what happens to the client since it does not contain anything sensi-
tive. It also makes it much harder for someone to extract data from the organization.
Policy, Training, and Security Awareness
I could just see Dorothy skipping through the cyber yellow brick road singing
policy, training, awareness, oh my. While that might be a far stretch, these three items
work very closely together.
The easiest way to think about the problem is: policy tells you what to do,
training teaches you the skills for doing it, and awareness changes your behavior so
that you are willing to do what you are suppose to be doing. While each one is crit-
ical and important by itself, when you put all three together they play a key role in
controlling, reducing, and stopping insider threat.
Every organization says they have a policy but very few implement them cor-
rectly. When I think of security policies the analogy I like to use is security policies
are a lot like sex when I went to high school. When I went to school, everyone was
talking about sex, everyone was claiming they were having sex, in reality very few
were having sex and those that were having it were not doing it correctly.You get
the picture with security policies. Most companies like to claim they have policies,
but they are cumbersome and hard to read. For a policy to really help combat
insider threat, it has to be readable and understandable to the average employee; oth-
erwise, it will not do any good.
Training complements the security policy by teaching users the skills they need
to do their jobs in the most efﬁcient manner. Even with proper training, some
people will still not do the right thing.Awareness is meant to change someone’s
behavior and explain to them the importance of a given policy statement and do it
in such a way that they will change their behavior and follow the policy moving
forward.

Background Checks
People who have done bad things in the past will most likely do bad things in the
future, and people who have never done bad things in the past most likely will never
do bad things in the future.There are always exceptions to the rules, but this general
premise holds true. While there is no set indicator of someone who will commit
insider threat, one of the best indicators is if they have something in their past or
even potentially a criminal record.
There is nothing that is foolproof, but doing a quick background check of
employees and applicants to make sure nothing stands out is probably not a bad idea.
Summary
With any security problem, there is never a single solution to solving it.The only
way to solve difﬁcult security problems is with defense in depth – multiple layers of
protection.This chapter showed that there are many methods that can be used to
control insider threat. No single method is perfect, but by combining multiple
methods an organization can maintain a secure environment and properly control
insider threat.

Introduction
At the end of the day, survival is the name of the game. While you hope and pray
that no damage ever occurs to your organization and that it operates and sustains a
high level of proﬁt, when attacks hit, you want to be able to make sure your organi-
zation survives and that there is still a piece left standing that can continue to
operate after all the dust settles. While operating at 30% revenue is not as ideal as
operating at 100%, it is better than operating at 0% or going out of business.
In this last chapter of the book, we summarize everything that we have talked
about and revisit some issues. We also examine how does a company goes about sur-
viving insider threat and increasing their defenses over time to minimize the amount
of damage it will cause.
Risk
When talking about survivability, a key point to start with is risk. Risk is the possi-
bility for suffering harm or loss and survivability is making sure that an organization
never has complete loss.Therefore, balancing the two together with insider threat,
the key is to ﬁgure out the areas where an organization is suffering harm or loss and
making sure that controls are in place so the organization cannot be completely
destroyed.As we talked about in the previous chapter, critical intellectual property is
what gives an organization net worth. If that IP can be destroyed, then the company
could also be destroyed. While we understand the importance of having a prioritized
list of IP, what is the next step that needs to be performed? The next step is looking
at what potentially could happen to the IP and what are weaknesses that we have
that would allow that to happen. In doing this analysis, what we have just deﬁned is
the general formula for risk. While many different formulas for risk are available, the
one that I like to use in insider threat, because it is very comprehensive, is the fol-
lowing formula:
Risk = (threat x vulnerabilities x probability x impact)/countermeasures
Understanding and calculating risk enables you to better understand your expo-
sure points. If you are going to survive, it is critical that you are able to protect and
limit the damage an exposure point can have. If you want a good lesson in surviv-
ability and risk management, play chess, or even better, play Risk. In either of these
games you have to make risk decisions and allow your pieces to be taken. However,
the real skill is survival, it does not matter in chess whether you have one piece left
or 10 pieces, if your opponent has no pieces left, then you have won.There are not
different degrees of winning, you either win or lose.And when the stakes are high,
which they are in insider threat, losing must be avoided at all cost.

Threats
Threats represent possible danger and come in many shapes and sizes. When you are
putting together the risk formula, threat is what drives the train.Threat is the starting
point that is used to calculate all the other variables that are needed to come up
with a formula for risk.
We could make an almost inﬁnite list of different areas of possible danger, but
the key is to focus in on realistic threats. For example, a general threat that represents
possible danger would be a hurricane. If you live in Florida or Mississippi, this is a
real threat that should be analyzed closely and risk should be calculated for it.
However, if you live in Montana or Colorado, a hurricane is not a real threat. Based
on location and weather conditions it is not something that is going to happen and
therefore spending any energy on analyzing that threat is wasted effort because it is
not realistic. However, planning for heavy snow and blizzard conditions is a must.
Just like different states in the U.S. have different threats, different companies have
different threats.There is no way we could create a generic list of threats, since it has
to be tied very closely to your organization.The vertical market you perform busi-
ness in, and what your critical intellectual property is are all used to focus your
attention on the correct area.
While the identiﬁcation of threat enables us to focus our effort, in many cases
there is nothing we can do about a particular threat.The threat tells us what to
worry about in the risk formula, but to lower the overall risk, you cannot reduce the
threat; rather, one of the other variables has to be lowered. If you think in terms of
hurricanes, this will make sense.A hurricane represents possible danger and is a key
threat for certain areas in the U.S. While the possible danger that a hurricane could
cause is devastating, can you stop, prevent, or do anything about a hurricane? The
short answer is no.Trust me, if there were a way that we could control a hurricane,
we would have done so this past year. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do to
stop the threat.
Threats from insider attacks come in many shapes and sizes.The general areas of
threat for insider threat are the following:
■
Revealing sensitive data
■
False information
■
Loss of an asset
Survivability • Chapter 10
355

341_INS_THR_10.qxd  11/20/05  3:01 PM  Page 355

I want you to look at the list very closely, since another way to write the list is:
■
Disclosure of information
■
Alteration of information
■
Destruction of information
What we are really talking about with the aforementioned lists are:
■
Conﬁdentiality
■
Integrity
■
Availability
Without even realizing it, we quickly were able to map our key threats in insider
threat back to our three core areas of network security: conﬁdentiality, integrity, and
availability.
Conﬁdentiality
Conﬁdentiality deals with preventing, detecting, and deterring the unauthorized dis-
closure of sensitive information. Every company has information that gives them a
competitive advantage and needs to be kept secret to the company.This information is
usually called intellectual property at a high level and the more speciﬁc form is called a
trade secret.Whether a company formally calls it a trade secret or not is secondary, but
every company has them.A trade secret is information that provides a company a
unique market share or unique competitive advantage that if publicly revealed could
have dire impact to the organization. One of the best examples is the formula for
Coca-Cola.This is a trade secret and lots of time and energy have been put into pro-
tecting it.With insider threat, breach of conﬁdentiality is a big concern.This is prob-
ably the main means of attack for a high-end insider committing espionage against the
company. If you look at all the insider threat examples with the government and any
ones involving a commercial entity, all revolve around some trusted insider giving away
sensitive information to another government or a competitor.
Integrity
Integrity deals with preventing, detecting, and deterring the unauthorized modiﬁca-
tion of information.Anything dealing with data consistency or alteration of informa-
tion falls under integrity. If a company is writing a proposal and the cheapest
company wins, integrity becomes a key issue. If someone could either accidentally
or deliberately modify the numbers, it could impact the ability of the company to

356

341_INS_THR_10.qxd  11/20/05  3:01 PM  Page 356

win the contract. Database consistency in a distributed environment also falls under
integrity.
While integrity is usually not the main focus of high-end insider threat attacks, it
could be a secondary goal. If a competitor of mine has a key piece of information
that I want to compromise, what I could do is either increase the value to me or
decrease the value to them.To increase the value to me, I must compromise the con-
ﬁdentiality of the information. By stealing it, I can see it and use it and increase my
competitive advantage. However, there are some cases where I might not be able to
breach the conﬁdentiality. In that case, if I cannot increase the value to me, I would
want to decrease the value to my competitor.The main way of decreasing the value
is by compromising the integrity of the information. If I cannot ﬁnd out the for-
mula for Coca Cola, but I could go in and change the formula, I am still giving
myself a competitive advantage. By changing the formula, customers are going to
stop buying it. If they are not buying my competitor’s soda, they have a better
chance of buying mine. In this case I have just decreased the value of a company’s
intellectual property through an integrity attack.
Availability
Availability deals with preventing, detecting, and deterring unauthorized destruction
of information. Denial and theft of information is the primary availability threats.
The problem with attacks that destroy information is that they are very easy to do.
Destroying a server could be as simple as pouring water on top of it. Purposely
deleting backup tapes or not backing up any data and just storing blank tapes in
their places would also be a simple yet effective attack.
Availability attacks are usually done by low-end attackers with the main group
being disgruntled employees.This is considered a low-end attack because there is no
direct beneﬁt for the attacker except the satisfaction of seeing a company destroyed
or lose money.
In some cases, availability attacks can be used by the high-end attacker, but they
offer low re-use value for the attacker, so they aren’t that attractive. For example, if
we are competing against each other, one way to give myself an advantage is to
destroy your facility with a bomb or ﬁre. However, you will eventually rebuild the
facility and there will be other competitors, so this is not a huge value or return on
investment. Planting someone on the inside to slowly extract data over a long period
of time is usually a much better payoff.
From a threat perspective, all three could represent danger to a company.
Breaking it down by attacker you have the following threats from highest to lowest:

High-End Attacker (Most Damage)
■
Conﬁdentiality
■
Integrity
■
Availability
Low-End Attacker (Least Damage)
■
Availability
■
Integrity
■
Conﬁdentiality
This presents an interesting dilemma in terms of threats. If you are worried
about a high-end attack, the most likely threat is conﬁdentiality; however, if you are
worried about the low-end attacker, the most likely threat is availability. Since both
can cause damage, you have to worry about both high-end and low-end threats,
which means a company must pay attention to threats across all three areas: conﬁ-
dentiality, integrity, and availability.
Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities are weaknesses that enable a threat to manifest itself against an organi-
zation.Threats are all around us and, as we pointed out, there is little we can do to
minimize or prevent a threat. However, since vulnerabilities become the portal that
enables a threat to cause damage, reducing the vulnerability will reduce the overall
risk to a given threat.Therefore, vulnerabilities are the items that we ﬁx across an
organization to reduce risk.
What is important to remember is that threat drives the train. So once we deter-
mine a list of high threats for an organization, the next step is to identify the corre-
sponding vulnerabilities that could be exploited or compromised. If the answer is that
there is no vulnerability for a given threat, then we are not concerned.What we are
looking for are items where there is a threat and vulnerability.A threat without vulner-
ability is not a concern because there are millions of threats around and tons of items
that represent possible danger, but if we do not have a weakness then who cares?
The same holds true with vulnerabilities. If there is a weakness but not a threat,
then we also are not concerned, but we should never get to that point, because we
are starting off with threats and only looking for vulnerabilities that correspond to a
given threat.Therefore, if there is not a threat, then we are not even going to bother
looking at vulnerabilities.

358
Chapter 10 • Survivability
341_INS_THR_10.qxd  11/20/05  3:01 PM  Page 358

The most common vulnerability or weakness at an organization is access. Giving
someone more access than what they need to do their job is the most common
portal that attackers use to compromise an organization via the use of an insider.
Access can come in many shapes and sizes, but the more common weaknesses are:
■
Access to critical ﬁles or IP
■
Access to physical computers or systems
■
Access to physical buildings
■
Access to storage medium
■
Access to sensitive ﬁle in printed form
■
Access to sensitive conversation or transmission
If organizations can learn to properly control access, they will reduce their vul-
nerabilities and reduce the ways that threats can manifest themselves.
Probability
While knowing that there is a possible danger (threat) with a corresponding weak-
ness (vulnerability) is important, the next important thing to ask is what is the prob-
ability or likelihood of this occurring.You could have a devastating threat and
vulnerability, but if it is never going to happen, why worry? In determining likeli-
hood, the situational environment that a company operates in becomes critical. If I
tell you that I have a house that cannot support the weight of snow and if more than
two inches of snow falls on the roof it will collapse, is this a problem? It depends.
Clearly we have a threat and clearly we have a resulting vulnerability, but the ques-
tion is where is this house located? The environment or location will help us deter-
mine the probability of whether it will snow, which will determine whether this is a
concern or not. If this house is located in Boston, where it snows several feet each
year, this is a major risk. If the house is located in the tropics, where it never gets
below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, then it is a low risk.Therefore, probability must be
added to the equation to get an accurate risk rating.
When some people talk about risk, they use only the following formula:
Risk = threat x vulnerabilities
They plot each risk on a risk matrix where they include likelihood (probability)
and impact.Although this method is also okay, I prefer to put it together in one for-
mula to make to not lose site of the critical components.

341_INS_THR_10.qxd  11/20/05  3:01 PM  Page 359

Impact
The next piece of the puzzle we are going to look at is impact: how bad will it be if
it happens? In essence, when we add impact, we are looking at what is the monetary
loss that is going to occur with a given threat. What you are really doing in this step
is tying the threat and vulnerability to a given asset or system.
Saying that there is a new buffer overﬂow threat and our systems are not patched
is a problem, but the real question is what system we are talking about. If we are
talking about a test system in the lab that is only used to run experiments once in a
while, then the impact to the organization if that system is taken down is minimal.
However, if we are talking about the critical ﬁle server that contains all the key IP
that is accessed thousands of times a day and is used to operate the company, then
the impact for that system being down is very high.
At this point we have a clear picture of how bad the problem is really going to
be. We know what the possible danger is, we know whether we have a weakness, we
know the likelihood of this occurring, and we know against which system or piece
of data this is going to happen to. Now that we have a clear picture of the risk or
loss, we need to know what we can do to reduce it.
Countermeasures
Countermeasures focus in on the solution piece. Now that we have a clear picture
of the problem, what can we do to ﬁx the problem? When dealing with risk, there
are three general solutions:
■
Accept the risk
■
Reduce the risk
■
Transfer the risk
Accepting the risk is different from avoiding the risk. Risk avoidance is where you
do not care about the risk and just want it to go away and in essence will say anything
to make that happen.That is not an acceptable solution and is not considered part of
the risk countermeasures because it is something that you never want to do.
Risk acceptance is where you fully understand the risk and make a cost-beneﬁt
analysis in which you compare the cost of the risk with the cost of ﬁxing or
reducing the risk. If the cost to ﬁx or reduce the risk is more than the cost of the
risk, it makes sense to accept the current risk. Even if the risk occurs, it will still be
cheaper than if you had prevented it. When performing these calculations, the
biggest mistake that is made is to not calculate the full cost of both the risk and the
countermeasure. In calculating the cost of the risk, it is critical to calculate the annu-
www.syngress.com
360
Chapter 10 • Survivability
341_INS_THR_10.qxd  11/20/05  3:01 PM  Page 360

alized loss. In many cases if you have a potential worm as a risk, an organization will
only calculate the single occurrence of the worm as the cost of the risk. However, if
this worm could occur six times a year, then the number that was calculated must be
multiplied by six to get the real value. In terms of calculating the cost of a counter-
measure, it is important to calculate the TCO or total cost of ownership. In many
cases, organizations will say that they can reduce or ﬁx a risk by purchasing a new
appliance that cost $50,000 and use that to calculate the cost of the countermeasure.
The cost of $50,000 is the cost to just get the appliance delivered to your doorstep.
As soon as someone in your organization starts to unpack it, the cost is more than
$50,000.As someone conﬁgures it, troubleshoots it, and maintains it, the cost is
probably easily three to ﬁve times that of the single appliance.Therefore, it is critical
to always use accurate and complete numbers; otherwise, the cost-beneﬁt analysis
will be ﬂawed.
The next option for dealing with risk is more common: reducing the risk.
Typically, risk acceptance is done after the risk has been reduced to an acceptable
level. Some people, when they look at the ways to deal with risk, say there is one
that is missing: eliminate the risk.Actually, risk elimination is a subset of risk reduc-
tion. If you reduce the risk to zero, you have successfully eliminated the risk. In most
situations it is better to reduce many risks than to eliminate one risk. In some cases,
if the risk is very high, it might make sense to eliminate the one risk, but in most
cases if you are going to spend effort and energy, it is better to reduce many risks
than to eliminate one. Figure 10.1 illustrates this point.

From an organizational risk perspective, would you rather have the top or
bottom line? I know that I would rather have the bottom line where all my risks are
reduced than the top line where one risk is zero, and I have done nothing about the
other 19 risks. With limited resources, we have to look at the big picture. Instead of
focusing on just one risk, look holistically and ﬁx or reduce them all in a coordi-
nated fashion.
The ﬁnal countermeasure is to transfer the risk.This is often called the insurance
model because instead of assuming the risk you are transferring it over to a third
party who will assume the risk for you.
When you buy insurance for something, the way they determine the premium is
by using risk formulas. If you have never had an accident and never had a speeding
ticket, your premiums will be lower than someone who has had accidents and mul-
tiple speeding tickets. Why? Because the insurance company feels that the ﬁrst driver
is less of a risk than the second driver.The greater the chance that an insurance
company is going to have to pay out, the higher the premiums. Insurance companies
are still in business because they manage to make money.
Risk Analysis
Now that we have covered the key components of risk, we can move onto to how
we perform general risk analysis. Risk analysis deals with analyzing the risk and ﬁg-
uring out which items require more attention than others.There are two general
types of risk analysis that can be performed:
■
Qualitative
■
Quantitative
Qualitative
Qualitative risk analysis is where you categorize risk but you do not assign exact
values. Qualitative risk analysis is easier to perform and much quicker because you
are just performing a general rating.The easiest method of performing qualitative
analysis is using the scheme of high, medium, and low.Although this works okay, I
personally feel that three categories do not give enough room for discretion. I prefer
to use the scheme shown in Table 10.1.
www.syngress.com

Table 10.1 Quantitative Risk Categories
Category
Description
1
Conﬁguration issue that does not impact security
2
Non-critical security risk but should be ﬁxed
3
Low security risk 
4
Medium security risk
5
Major security risk
I feel that using a ﬁve-degree rating scheme gives a little more ﬂexible. With
qualitative you perform the analysis very quickly, rating items into one of the ﬁve
categories.
Some argue that you are going to miscategorize items, which is correct, but the
important thing to remember is that this is a self-correcting model. Since qualitative
analysis is such a quick process, you would actually perform it on a regular basis. If I
accidentally put a risk in category 4 when it should be a 5, it does not matter,
because the next time I do the analysis it will bubble up to 5.The other neat thing
about this model is you are really only concerned with level 5 items because the way
this works is you will ﬁx the level 5 items and re-perform the analysis, ﬁx the level 5
and re-analyze. With this trick in mind, it becomes even easier. For each item, you
are just determining whether it is 5 or below and if it is below it does not matter
where you put it because you are never going to focus on anything below 5.This
provides a nice trick for performing a quick analysis that is self-correcting, just in
case you make a mistake.
Quantitative
Quantitative is the more time-consuming method in which you assign an exact
number to each item. While this takes a lot longer to perform, the results are usually
more useful for overall strategic and business planning. While getting exact numbers
for each risk can be beneﬁcial in certain circumstances, in most organizations the
extra beneﬁt is not worth the extra effort.
The criticism is if I am going to spend eight months ﬁguring out exact values
for each risk item and four months ﬁxing the problems, I am not focusing my
energy in the right areas. I should be focusing as little energy as possible on ﬁguring
out what the problem is and the most energy on ﬁxing the problem. In this example
I spent two-thirds of my time ﬁguring out what the problem is and only one-third
of my time ﬁxing it.

The other criticism of quantitative analysis is that organizations are very dynamic
and always changing. Most organizations are a lot different today than they were
three to four months ago. Since quantitative analysis takes so long to perform, by the
time you calculate exact numbers for each risk, the risks have changed and the
values are no longer accurate.
Calculating Risk
Risk analysis is very helpful, and in most cases provides the information that you
need. However, in some cases it is beneﬁcial to be able to perform actual calculations
on risk. In performing actual calculations, two formulas are used:
■
SLE
■
ALE
SLE stands for single loss expectancy and calculates the cost of a single occur-
rence of the risk. SLE is calculated by taking the exposure factor multiplied by the
asset value.
While SLE provides a starting point, is does not tell you the true loss. It tells you
the loss if it occurs only once. Many risks, as with viruses and worms, occur many
times in a given year.Therefore, what you really want to know is what the cost is
over an entire year.To ﬁnd this, you calculate the ALE, or annualized loss expectancy,
which is the SLE times the ARO, or annualized rate of occurrence.
Let’s look at an example to show how these formulas can be used to make a cost
justiﬁcation for security.A key aspect and focus for insider threat is access.At your
organization, a proposal that will bring into your company $10 million in revenue is
currently being worked on. Of the last six proposals that you submitted, you lost
three because the competition outbid you. When getting the results, it almost
seemed that they had inside information and knew details of your proposal.That
brought up concern and the potential for insider threat. In this example, if we calcu-
lated the SLE it would be the asset value, which is $10 million, times the exposure
factor. In this case, based on historical data, three of the last six proposals were sus-
pect to insider threat, so we will use an exposure factor of 50%.Therefore, the SLE
in this case is $5 million. In performing a cost-beneﬁt analysis, we need to know the
true loss and not just the single occurrence.
One of the problems with cost-beneﬁt analysis is if you use too low a number
or an incorrect number for the loss you will not be able to make correct calcula-
tions. If you are going to work on six additional proposals this year, all around the
same potential revenue, then the ARO is six. So the true cost of this loss is really the
www.syngress.com
364
Chapter 10 • Survivability
341_INS_THR_10.qxd  11/20/05  3:01 PM  Page 364

SLE times the ARO, which is $5 million times six, or $30 million, for the ALE. For
calculations, the true loss over a year is represented by the ALE not the SLE.
Here is a good example that illustrates how performing the wrong calculation
can give signiﬁcantly incorrect numbers and results. In this case, if the cost to ﬁx the
problem or reduce the risk was $4 million, if you used the SLE it would be a low
return on investment, but if you used the correct value of the ALE, it make a
stronger case. Spending $4 million to ﬁx a $5 million problem is not nearly as com-
pelling as spending $4 million to ﬁx a $30 million problem.Therefore, understanding
the difference between SLE and ALE is critical to making sure the proper values are
being used.
The second half of the cost-beneﬁt analysis is the TCO or total cost of owner-
ship of the solution. Just like people would mistakenly use the SLE instead of the
ALE, organizations also mistakenly use the cost of the product instead of the total
cost of ownership of the solution.
In this situation, let’s assume that the current problem (and the reason we think
proposals have been compromised by an insider) is that proper authentication is not
being performed and everyone uses weak passwords and access permissions are not
properly set up. We cost out a solution to use token-based authentication and the
cost for the server and the hardware tokens for all users is $800,000. We also cost out
authentication software that can better control and track IP across the organization
at $200,000.Therefore, we predict that we can ﬁx this problem by spending $1 mil-
lion. However, we all can see that we did not price out the complete cost of the
solution, but only the direct hardware and software costs.The $1 million is the cost
for the delivery person to drop the boxes at the front door.As soon as employees
start unpacking boxes and conﬁguring the software, the cost is going to dramatically
increase. In both of these cases, not only are the systems time consuming to set up,
but there is a lot of maintenance and a lot of integration costs involved.This $1 mil-
lion software/hardware outlay will probably cost the company six to ten times that
over a year when you calculate in the total cost of ownership and maintenance.
It is important to remember that when you calculate risk and countermeasures
that you pay careful attention to what is being calculated. I know some people pur-
posely play games with the numbers, but there are also a lot of people who acciden-
tally miscalculate the numbers and lead the company to make bad or incorrect
decisions.
Nonetheless, quantifying certain risks and presenting them to executives go a
long way toward making a case for why the insider threat needs to be addressed and
ﬁxed as soon as possible. I have found that by performing monetary calculations that
can be validated, it is easier to sell security solutions to upper management.

Many security people complain that their management and executives won’t
spend the money that is needed to make the organization secure, and they walk
around frustrated and in some cases bitter. When I ask them what they are asking for
and what management says, they usually tell me that they ask for x but management
won’t give it to them. I then ask what the beneﬁt is to the organization and the cost
savings that will be realized by purchasing this item.They usually give me a dirty
look and ask,“Whose side are you on?” My answer is, I am on the side of the com-
pany, but I can usually clearly see that the reason most security departments are
under-staffed and under-resourced is because many people do not know how to sell
and do not know how to talk the language of business.
Security is always changing and there are always new threats and corresponding
vulnerabilities at an organization.There is no way that executives can keep up with
this changing landscape and insider threat is a perfect example. If security depart-
ments do not make the case and sell management on the importance of paying
attention and dealing with the insider threat, how are they going to know it is
important? In many cases we assume that the executives already understand and
know the importance of a problem, but if the experts do not tell them, how do we
expect them to know? As I stated earlier, part of our job is to be evangelists for the
cause. We have to be careful and make sure that we do not turn into Chicken Little
screaming that the sky is falling. But by staying up on the news, gathering facts and
data points, we will be able to make a compelling case to executives of why a
problem needs to be addressed before it gets out of hand. In terms of insider threat,
we are quickly approaching that time period. While few companies are publicizing
it, by talking with partners with whom you have executed NDAs (non-disclosure
agreements) and looking at public sources, you can make a strong case that this is
happening.The Secret Service and CERT are publishing a series of insider threat
reports, many of them covering commercial sectors. Why? Because they recognize
this is a big problem and they need to raise people’s awareness.
Awareness based on factual data is the key. If you start running around screaming
about each problem with no data and no follow-up, you are going to quickly lose
credibility. However, if you ﬁnd out the facts, perform analysis across your organiza-
tion, and present a clear business case on the dangers of insider threat, the impact it
has had to other locations, and the impact it could have at your organization, people
will start to listen. Putting together clear business cases is a good start, but you have
to make sure that you have a solution you can present. One of the biggest problems
I see is that security will present a strong case, but when an executive asks how to ﬁx
it or how much it will cost, security does not have an answer. Whenever you are
going to present a problem and raise awareness on a situation, you always want to
www.syngress.com
366
Chapter 10 • Survivability
341_INS_THR_10.qxd  11/20/05  3:01 PM  Page 366

make sure you have a solution in your back pocket.You might not always present it,
but just in case someone asks for it, you want to make sure it is available.
The second mistake that is often made is running the problem to ground or val-
idating the solution. Often when a problem comes up, we like to look at a small seg-
ment of it and sell a solution instead of a problem. I have seen cases where people
say they need an intrusion prevention system (IPS) and when asked why, explain that
it is a new security component, the company needs defense in depth, and everyone
else has one.Although the defense in depth argument has validity, you still have to
run it ground and ask what the problem is. Figure out the problem and then see
what the appropriate solution is. Insider threat is a perfect example: analyze your
company and see what your true threat and corresponding vulnerabilities are to
insider threat and then ﬁgure out different possible solutions. Perform cost-beneﬁt
analysis across the different solutions and pick the best solution and present that to
management.Also be prepared to present the reason for choosing that solution and
potentially an alternative solution.
The last issue is the need to speak the same language. If I am speaking English
and you are speaking Spanish, although audible sounds are coming out of our
mouths and we are hearing those audible sounds, they have no meaning since we
speak different languages. We are not communicating because we are speaking dif-
ferent languages.That is often what happens when security people and executives
talk. Security is speaking security and the executives are speaking business.There is
no wonder that when these meetings occur everyone leaves frustrated and nothing
gets accomplished.
If you want to be able to communicate and sell, you need to be able to speak
the language of business and the common ground is money. If you can show a vali-
dated business case talking dollars and cents, you have found a common language
and you will be more effective in your communication.
Limiting Failure Points
If the ultimate goal is survivability, a key way to accomplish this is by limiting failure
points. Once again, almost everything we do with security and insider threat revolves
around risk and therefore every decision that you make you have to ask yourself
what do I have to gain and what to I have to lose by making a given decision. Since
insider threat is focused on controlling or limiting access it is critical to make sure
that the access control measures do not fail. If other measures that are not as impor-
tant fail, they are less of a concern. In essence, we are identifying what the critical
business processes are and making sure those security controls do not fail.

When talking about failure points, it is often useful to perform an analysis
between automobiles and airplanes. If a component fails in a car, while it could
cause an accident, usually you can pull over to the side over the road. If a compo-
nent fails in an airplane at 30,000 feet, you have a much different problem.That is
one of the reasons that components between the two are designed much differently.
In addition, with airplanes the primary maintenance that is performed is called pre-
ventive maintenance. Instead of waiting for a component to fail, the component will
be ﬁxed prior to a problem.Although this tends to be more expensive, it is well
worth the extra cost. Compare this to automobiles. While some people do some
basic preventive maintenance like changing the oil, in most cases people wait for a
problem before they bring it into the shop. Since there is less at risk with a car, there
is less need to do preventive maintenance. Since there is more at risk with an air-
plane, it is more important to perform preventive maintenance.
Even with an airplane, the preventive maintenance schedule focuses on the crit-
ical failure points.There are many systems, but two that come immediately to mind
are the engine and landing gear. If either of those failed, there would be major issues
and potential loss of life. In an airplane scenario, the driving factor is to prevent loss
of life and to focus on critical failure areas to prevent them from failing.
With insider threat, the driving factor is loss of signiﬁcant revenue or proﬁt or,
to be more direct, prevent drastic loss so the company will not go out of business. In
any situation, although it is ideal to minimize loss, the key component is to make
sure the organization continues to function and stay competitive both short term
and long term.This balance between the two is critical. I have seen organizations be
so focused on short term that they never realize the long-term impact something
could have. If you cannot get past the short term, you might never make it to the
long term vision.
Taking this focus of keeping a company in business, you can quickly see that the
focus of keeping a company in business would tie back to what gives a company a
competitive advantage. In most cases, the answer would be the intellectual property
of the organization is what makes a company unique or a differentiator in the
market that enables the company to continue to be successful and thrive.Therefore,
that is going to be what is targeted. In previous chapters we have covered identifying
critical IP; now we have to look at the failure points across that IP.
Where are the areas that your IP can fail or be compromised? The three general
areas are in the disclosure, alteration, and destruction of it. Hopefully, you are starting
to see some similarities in what we are presenting, which is meant to show you the
importance of this key information. When it comes to reducing the failure points of
disclosure and alteration, access control or the lack of access control is usually a key
culprit. On the surface it seems easy to understand that if you stop someone from
www.syngress.com
368

341_INS_THR_10.qxd  11/20/05  3:01 PM  Page 368

getting to a piece of data they cannot disclose it or alter it; however, you still have to
strike that ﬁne balance between functionality and security and enable your organiza-
tion to function.Too much functionality increases your failure points and too little
functionality causes other problems. Neither is good since both could result in loss
of revenue and loss of competitiveness for the organization.
The other area to focus in on is limiting the failure points for destruction or
denial of access to information.The best way that is handled is through redundancy.
Increasing Redundancy
We started off the previous section by talking about airplanes and limiting failure
points.While preventive maintenance is a critical aspect of that, one of the best ways
to limit failure points is by implementing redundancy across a system. Preventive main-
tenance is based on the mean time between failures. If a certain component on average
fails every two years, if you replace it every year the chances of it failing are very low.
However, this is playing with averages. If I play baseball, I could have a very high bat-
ting average but there are times I strike out and go way below the average and there
are times I hit home runs and go above the average, so on a given day there could be a
huge ﬂuctuation even though at the end of the season my average is high.
The same thing holds true for mean time between failures. While there are some
components that fail in four months and other components will last for four years,
the average when you put all of these together is two years.There is no guarantee
that even with preventive maintenance that a component will not fail before the
maintenance is performed; it is just not very likely. However, defense in depth
teaches us that you never want to rely on a single measure to be secure, so an alter-
native solution is redundancy.This is prevalent in airplanes but is very prevalent in
the space shuttle.All mission-critical systems in the space shuttle have redundancy
built in so if they fail it will still function properly. Even landing sites have built-in
redundancy. Since the shuttle has strict requirements in terms of weather and other
conditions for landing, they want to make sure the shuttle is never stranded or has to
land in unsafe conditions. Landing site redundancy means that if it cannot land at
one site, there is an alternative site where it can land.
IP is the life blood of your organization and if it is destroyed your company
could potentially be destroyed in direct response to the compromise.Therefore
redundancy plays a key component with destruction or denial of access to informa-
tion.A low-grade insider such as a disgruntled employee does not want to get any
direct beneﬁt by their attack other than to cause harm to the company.These attacks
could include encrypting a hard drive on a key server and not giving the company
the key unless they pay a large amount of money, typically referred to as extortion.

Survivability • Chapter 10
369
341_INS_THR_10.qxd  11/20/05  3:01 PM  Page 369

They could also steal a hard drive or physically destroy a system or facility. With all
of these problems, redundancy plays a key role in the solution.
Even with a competitor or government who is planting or compromising an
insider, they could also resort to availability attacks if all else fails. If we are com-
peting against each other for a new product, ideally I would like to get your IP and
use it to build a better product. However, there could be situations in which I am
unable to do that.There could also be cases where even though I have the IP, you
still have too much of an advantage for me to compete. In those situations, an alter-
native would be to destroy the information.An insider would have better access to
destroy information and do it in a way that either the company does not know who
did it or that it looks like an accident. In this situation, redundancy will help protect
your data so that if a single copy is lost your company can still survive.
As with any solution, there is always a positive and a negative. While redundancy
will help prevent data loss if a single copy is lost, redundancy also increases your
exposure points. Instead of your data residing in one location, it is now in multiple
locations, and there is a good chance those other locations do not have the same
security or access control as the primary location. One of my clients had a primary
computing facility that had very tight security and access control.To plan for an
attack against the facility under their disaster recovery plans, they assumed that with
a large-scale attack, their primary facility could be destroyed.Therefore, at one of the
remote satellite ofﬁces they put a redundant server in which all the information was
backed up, including critical IP for the company.The satellite ofﬁce was never
designed for tight security since the original idea was that it would house some sales
and marketing people who all had laptops and took them home every evening, so
even if someone broke in, there would be nothing of value to take. With the backup
server located there, they never changed or upgraded the security at that facility.
Whenever they had risk assessments and penetration tests done, they always focused
on the primary site and thought everything was ﬁne.They suffered a major insider
attack and the insider compromised the remote facility because he knew it would be
much easier than the primary facility.
This is a situation where you have to make sure you always look at the plus and
minus with every solution. While redundancy can help increase your security, if it is
not done correctly and the backup site is overlooked, it could actually do more
harm than good.
Full redundancy at the server or data center is ideal, but it can be very expensive
and if not carefully thought through could actually increase your exposure points
which would decrease your security.
Other alternatives are ﬁle backups. While this is not real time, it would still
enable recovery in a shorter time period than having to re-create it from scratch.

Tape backups run into similar issues as backup servers. If you only store them locally,
you have the physical security protection of the main facility, but they are vulnerable
to the same disaster you are trying to protect against. Fireproof safes with limited
access is an alternative to this, in which the tapes are still on site and locally pro-
tected but have control to limit the number of insiders who could get access to
them and even if the facility were destroyed, the tapes and safe might be okay. Off-
site storage is another option in which the tapes are stored offsite. Now they are
remote and harder for an insider to access and in the event of a major disaster they
would still be protected.The problem is if the person who controls the tape inven-
tory at the offsite facility is an insider threat, they could still request the tapes.
A potential solution to the problem of a single ill-intentioned insider causing
harm is to utilize a security triad that I refer to as the following:
■
Least privilege
■
Separation of duties
■
Rotation of duties
Least privilege starts off the process by stating that you give someone the least
amount of access they need to do their job.You need to create a matrix identifying
the minimal subset of people that need access to the tapes while allowing your orga-
nization to still function. On the one hand, you never want the number to be one
because that creates a single point of value. On the other hand giving 200 people
access is probably too many. Essentially, you are looking for a number greater than
one so there is some redundancy but as low as possible to be able to maintain con-
trol. Whenever you have more than one person who can do something, you must
also keep accountability in mind.
Accountability enables you to determine the speciﬁc person who performed a
task and track it in a way that they are held responsible for their actions. If you have
10 people who have access to the tapes and the tapes are stored in a locked cabinet
that opens with a standard metal key, every one of the 10 people would have the
same key. If you went in one day and a tape was missing or a tape was intentionally
destroyed or corrupted, you would know one of the 10 people did it but you would
not know which one. While you could keep an eye on all ten, you want to make
sure you can isolate the one person and hold each individual responsible for the
actions they are performing.As you will see, separation of duties also helps with the
accountability piece.
Gong back to least privilege, you would give employees the least amount of
access they needed to perform their jobs. However, in some cases that access is still
too great or poses too big a security threat, especially in the arena of accountability.

Survivability • Chapter 10
371
341_INS_THR_10.qxd  11/20/05  3:01 PM  Page 371

The next step in the security process is to take a function and break it up across
multiple people or perform separation of duties. In this situation, to access a tape,
two people need to be involved. Now this adds checks and balances into the equa-
tion.The chance of one person being an insider threat is low, but the chances of two
people both being insiders are exponentially lower, so you are increasing your odds
and providing better checks and balances.
Here’s a story to drive home this point:A statistician would always pack a bomb
in his suitcase whenever he traveled. One of his friends noticed that he did this and
asked him why.The statistician explained that the chance of there being a bomb on
an airplane is .01 percent.The chance of there being two bombs on an airplane is
.00000000000000001 percent. So by carrying a bomb, he great reduced the odds
that there would be a second bomb.
Now with that story to tell at cocktail parties, how could anyone ever say that
geeks are not fun and math is not cool?
With backup tapes, a common way to perform separation of duties locally is by
utilizing two safes. Most organizations already have one large safe, so purchasing a
second smaller safe will not be a great increase in cost. Put the tape in the small safe
and give the combination to one group of people.Then take the smaller safe and put
it in a larger safe and give that combination to a second group of people.As long as
the same people are not in group one and group two, you have achieved separation
of duties. In order to access the tape, at least two people need to be involved; no
single person can gain access to the system.The reason you put multiple people in
each group as opposed to a single person is redundancy.As we stated before, you
never want to have a single point of failure and if there is only one person who
knows the combination and they are not around or on vacation, then you have just
caused a denial of service attack to occur because you cannot get access to your safe
and recover your data.
Another way to perform separation of duties is across multiple sites. If you are
performing incremental or differential backups you would need more than one tape
in order to recover the data. If your company has multiple locations, you can store
each of the tapes at different locations, each being locked and controlled by a dif-
ferent person. If there is a problem and the data needs to be recovered, two people
need to be involved.
While separation of duties works well, it has the potential to deteriorate over time.
Instead of one person performing a job, two people work together to perform the job.
In the beginning, the two people do not know each other very well.As they begin to
work together, they get to know each other and they become friendlier.The longer
they work together, the stronger the potential friendship grows, and the greater the
chances that they might work together to launch an attack against the company. So
www.syngress.com
372
Chapter 10 • Survivability
341_INS_THR_10.qxd  11/20/05  3:01 PM  Page 372

while separation of duties is powerful, the beneﬁt decreases the longer two people
work together.Therefore, you want to rotate people’s positions so the chance of them
becoming comfortable is reduced, which brings us to the next principle.
Rotation of duties is the last part in our chain.You start off by giving someone
the least amount of access they need to do their job and if that access is still too
great you then break the job up over multiple people and perform separation of
duties.The longer people work together, the greater the chance of them becoming
friends, which reduces the value of the separation of duties. Rotating positions on a
regular basis reduces the chances of this occurring. Rotation of duties is a fairly
common practice with the goal to reduce collusion among people in the workplace.
While this could require some re-training, usually there is a large base of people
trained in a given task so rotation is more feasible than it might seem on the surface.
So far in this section we have been focusing on redundancy across data. We
looked at redundant servers, databases, and tape backups for the data. While it was
not covered we could have also covered RAID, redundant array of inexpensive disk
which is meant to set up local redundancy on a system, that if a single drive stops
working the system will suffer no data loss.Although it is important to focus on the
data, we have to remember that if you cannot get to the data, then it does not matter
how protected it is.
Therefore, we will ﬁnish up this section by looking at redundancy across your
entire network and infrastructure. No matter how protected your data is, any single
point of failure in your organization could be used as a point of compromise by an
insider.Typically, the logic that many companies used was that while there are single
points of failure within their network, an external attacker does not know what they
are, cannot ﬁnd out about them, and cannot get access to them. While I was never a
big fan of security through obscurity, which says if you hide the inner workings of
your system you will be secure, the argument holds some water. However, with an
insider, that entire logic falls apart because the insider knows your network, knows
how to compromise it, and has access to perform the attack. Worse case is, even if
you have a fully redundant network, since the insider has full access there is no
reason that he cannot take down multiple points of redundancy or create a situation
where he creates his own single point of failure.
If I wanted to stop a city from functioning, I could target the people, which
would be equivalent to the data. I could go in and destroy every single car in the
city so no one could drive, which would stop the city from functioning.The
problem is that there are so many people and cars that this would not be possible.
The second option is I could take out the bridges and key highways in and out of
the city.This would be equivalent to the routers and ﬁrewalls. People’s cars would
www.syngress.com
Survivability • Chapter 10
373
341_INS_THR_10.qxd  11/20/05  3:01 PM  Page 373

still function, but I took down the infrastructure so people could not go anywhere
or do anything, which in effect stops the city from functioning.
While targeting the data is one method of causing harm to an organization, a
potentially simpler way for an attacker is to make the data inaccessible to those who
need it by taking down the routers and ﬁrewalls. If an attacker can disrupt the infras-
tructure, he can still cause harm, and the insider has the means to do this fairly easily.
On an e-commerce site, which of the following would be more damaging?
1.
Giving the customer list to a competitor
2.
Publicizing all the customer credit card numbers
3.
Making the site inaccessible for multiple days
They are all bad and trying to prioritize such a list is like choosing whether you
want to be shot in the arm or the leg.At the end of the day, though, item 3 is prob-
ably the worst because no customers, means no business, means no company. While
1 and 2 could lead to the company going out of business, item 3 will guarantee it.
Controlling and Limiting Access
One of the best ways to prevent, detect, and survive an insider attack is by properly
controlling access. On the surface this seems like an easy thing to do, but it is
extremely complicated and difﬁcult. Essentially every piece of data in most compa-
nies, which is easily in the millions, has to be controlled. Proper system design in
which directories are well thought out and built in a hierarchical manner, and
groups that are properly created make it easier to control and manage access. Most
organizations fail to realize that things that work well for functionality also work
well for security.Therefore, spending the time up front to properly design a server
and putting together a well-though-out plan for breaking up the ﬁle structure, set-
ting permissions, and creating groups can go a long way in protecting against the
insider threat.
Before looking at other areas that require access control, let’s revisit least privi-
lege. When assigning access, we talked about giving employees the least amount of
access to do their jobs. While this works well, we can make this even better. While
least privilege is a good starting point, the next level is need-to-know. Least privilege
says to give someone the access to do their job and need-to-know takes it to the
next level, saying give them the access only when they need it and as soon as they
are done, take it away. Need-to-know adds an extra level that also helps to control
insider threat.

Let’s look a brief example.An HR director needs access to the HR ﬁles across
an organization.Therefore, least privilege states that the HR director should be given
access to all HR ﬁles to perform his job function. While this is good, adding in
need-to-know is even better. While least privilege says he needs access to all HR
ﬁles, need-to-know says to give him access to the HR ﬁles only when he needs it to
perform a certain job function.The HR director cannot just walk in and access any
HR ﬁle; he must have a need. If there is a termination or a review, then the director
gets access because there is now an implied need tied to the least privilege, which
makes it even more difﬁcult for an insider to cause harm.
Once again, in the previous paragraph and this chapter we have been focusing
mainly on access to data, but we should not overlook access to physical areas of your
building. Even access to the network needs to be carefully controlled.All the princi-
ples we talked about with securing data can apply to any part of your organization.
Physical security is another part that can go a long way to protecting against
insider threat. Many organizations have fairly strong physical security around the
perimeter of the building.To put it another way, if a company has any physical secu-
rity it is always going to be around the perimeter.The doors and entry points to the
building is where the badge systems and guards sit.There might even be fences to
get onto the grounds of the facility. However, once you get inside, physical security
is usually limited. On your network you want to institute a principle of least privi-
lege where you give people access only to the ﬁles and network resources they need
to do their job.The same thing needs to be done for you building. People should be
given physical access only to the parts of the building they need to access to do their
jobs and nowhere else.
There are often disconnects in organizations between the real risks and the per-
ceived risks. For example, I know many people, executives included, who leave sensi-
tive papers on their desks and their ofﬁces unlocked when they leave for the evening.
The perception is that no one would go into their ofﬁce, but the real risk is huge. If
someone is working late and no one else is around, what stops an insider from looking
at sensitive papers on other people’s desks? Most people might not do that, but it only
takes one person to create a problem. In an organization of any reasonable size, the
chances of there being one or two people who would do that are high.
In one company I worked at, one of my employees came up to me and said,
“Did you know that x and y are occurring at the company?” I said no and asked
him how he found out. He said,“I came in late last night to work with my wife and
as I was working she just wandered around the ofﬁces and she found these papers in
the boss’ desk drawer.”As he was saying this my jaw must have hit the desk because
he asked me why I looked upset. I said,“Did you hear what you just told me?” His
response was astonishing. He said the ofﬁces were unlocked and the drawers

unlocked so there was nothing wrong with looking around. He continued to say,
“It’s not as if we broke into the ofﬁces or did something we were not supposed to.”
And the scary thing is this person was a very honest and upfront person, which can
be seen by the fact that he told me with no remorse. Different people just have a
different view of what is right and wrong and we have to make sure that we prop-
erly protect our information. I did not want to get anyone in trouble, but I went to
my boss and asked him why he left sensitive information in his drawer and left his
ofﬁce unlocked. He said,“Because no one will come into my ofﬁce.” I said,“Is your
assumption that because the door is unlocked and the desk is unlocked that someone
can go through that information?” He looked at me shocked for even asking and
said,“Of course not.” It is at this disconnect, where one person has one view of the
world and someone has a different view that we get ourselves into trouble.
To drive home the threat of insider attack and physical security, cleaning services
are another example.At many ofﬁces, people lock their doors when they leave with
their trash can inside their ofﬁce. Later that evening, the cleaning service comes by,
opens the ofﬁces, cleans the ofﬁces, empties the trash, and locks the doors. While
there is a slight risk with that, most people think the overall risk is minimal.
However, I have seen ﬁrsthand how this works and it is worse than you think.To
minimize the risk, the cleaning company does not give the master key to the actual
cleaners; they give it to a manager.A manager shows up usually around 9:00 P.M. and
walks around the ﬂoor unlocking every ofﬁce and then leaves. In the next couple of
hours, the actual cleaners show up and start cleaning the ofﬁces. When they are done
cleaning an ofﬁce, they pull the door shut and lock it. However, this creates a time
period in which all the ofﬁces are open, including managers’ and executives’.An
insider just has to work late and after the cleaning manager opens the ofﬁces, she has
free reign to do whatever she likes with no one else around. What drives me crazy is
that there is an easy solution to this that no one likes to follow. When you leave your
ofﬁce at the end of the day, put the trash can in the hallway.Trust me, if you forget
the ﬁrst time, the smell will remind you to leave it out the next day. If you want
your ofﬁce vacuumed, you would leave the ofﬁce unlocked. Now, because you are
leaving it unlocked, it is your responsibility to make sure any sensitive information is
properly secured for that day. Some people still won’t follow the rules, but the trick
is to come up with a solution that will scale and people can follow if they want to.
Going back to least privilege applied to every aspect of your organization
including physical security, a great example is the data center. In most data centers
you walk in and all the racks and systems are sitting there in one big room.Yet if you
ask who is responsible for each server, there is a different person or group respon-
sible for each set. One set is for marketing and administered by Pat; one set is for
research and administered by Sally. If that is the case, then least privilege says that
www.syngress.com
376
Chapter 10 • Survivability
341_INS_THR_10.qxd  11/20/05  3:01 PM  Page 376

Sally does not need access to the marketing systems, yet since they are all in one big
room, she can still get physical access to them. Ideally, to get defense in depth and
least privilege, there should be a door to the data center and then once inside, there
should be separate rooms for each group of servers. Now both Pat and Sally can get
into the data center but Pat can only get into the room with the marketing servers
and Sally can only get into the room with the research servers.
One last area of access to focus on is network access. If an outsider can connect
to your network, either through a port in the conference room or via a wireless
access point, that outsider has just become an insider with minimal effort.Therefore,
connectivity to a network must be carefully controlled. Before a system is allowed to
connect to a network it must be properly authenticated to make sure it is a valid
system and needs that access to do its job. While the primary function of controlling
network access is to thwart insider threat, it also helps to control virus and worm
outbreaks. If people are traveling and their systems becomes infected with a virus,
instead of them coming back, connecting, and infecting the network, when they
plug into the network not only will they be authenticated, but checks can also be
performed to make sure the system is secure before it is allowed to connect.
While there is no perfect security, through proper design and analysis most organi-
zations can do a lot more to prevent the insider threat than they are currently doing
today and a key way is to control and limit access at all points across their network.
Psychosocial Factors
No magic formula exists for ﬁnding an insider threat at your company. If the
problem were easy, then very few companies would care about it and entire books
would not have to be written about it. However, there are some basic factors to con-
sider when identifying potential problems within your organization. People are
wired a certain way and act a certain way based on their personality and psycholog-
ical factors. For example, my grandfather would never speed. It did not matter if no
one was around and there was no chance of getting caught; he just would never
break the law no matter what because that is who he was.There are other people
who, even knowing that there are police ofﬁcers around, will always speed, thus the
reason there are tickets.
The bottom line is people who have done things wrong in the past are more
likely do to things wrong in the future. People who have done things right in the
past will most likely do things right in the future. People who have been disruptive
in the past will most likely be disruptive in the future. While not always a perfect
indicator, looking at past problems and behavior can usually be a good indicator of
people who are likely to cause problems moving forward.
www.syngress.com
Survivability • Chapter 10
377
341_INS_THR_10.qxd  11/20/05  3:01 PM  Page 377

Therefore, as a starting point it is usually not a bad idea to perform screening or
background checks on key employees. Just because someone made a mistake in the
past does not mean they are going to cause harm to your organization and just
because someone has a clean past does not mean they are not going to snap and
cause problems in the future, but knowledge is power.The more information you
have the more informed a decision you can make.
Many times when people are disruptive in the workplace people are reluctant to
say anything because it is sometimes easier to ignore a problem than to have to deal
with it. However, these could be big indicators so it is critical that they are properly
reported to HR and followed up on because they can be some of the best indicators
to ﬁnd potential attackers within the walls of your organization.
When it comes to insider attack, employees are your biggest allies and your
biggest enemies. Since one or more of your employees or contractors are harming
your organization, a healthy dose of paranoia needs to be used but not so much that
no one is trusted and everyone hates working at your organization. Causing disgrun-
tled employees and dissent will only increase your chances of being attacked and
cause more problems. However, there is always a balance that needs to be achieved.
The best bet is to carefully control access, enabling people to do their jobs but
taking away any additional access. If people need additional access, carefully validate
and control the access but give the access that is needed for people to be effective at
what they were hired to do.
While there is always the chance of someone on the inside being an attacker, less
than 5% of your employees will be, which means that 95% have the company’s best
interests at heart. While you want to keep an eye out for the 5%, do not let the 5%
ruin it for the other 95%.At the end of the day, assuming someone is innocent until
proven guilty is not a bad rule of thumb.
Educating Employees
While a small percentage of your employees or trusted insiders might have ill inten-
tions, most of them would like to see the company succeed and do well.Therefore,
knowledge is power. Employees cannot help you and in some cases they can actually
hurt you if they do not know what they are supposed to do.A well-educated and
trained employee is a strategic weapon that can be enormously helpful for tracking
and ﬁnding inside attackers. On the other hand, a well-intentioned, poorly guided,
and poorly trained employee can inadvertently cause more harm than good and
result in damage to your organization.

Chapter 10 • Survivability
341_INS_THR_10.qxd  11/20/05  3:01 PM  Page 378

Therefore, keeping your employees as allies is critical and is done in three 
critical ways:
■
Policies
■
Procedures
■
Awareness
Policies and especially security policies are the organization’s high-level stance on
what needs to be done and what is expected of users to make the organization suc-
cessful.You always hear people complain that no one follows policies and users
always complain about them, but I would urge you to carefully analyze the data.
When you really go through and add up the numbers, I bet you that the people that
are complaining and causing problems are less than 10% percent of your organiza-
tion. It is always easy to focus on the small number of trouble makers, but it is crit-
ical that you do not lose site of the greater good.
Training is a critical adjunct to policies in that training teaches people the skills
they need to have in order to follow the policy. If your policy states that people have
to do a certain thing and your employees do not have the skills to do it, how can
you expect them to ever follow it? Therefore, it is critical that you empower your
employees by giving them the tools they need to properly follow and obey the 
policies.
What makes the world such a neat place to live is that everyone has a different
view of the world and different opinions. If we were all the same the world would
be pretty boring.Things that make sense to me might not make sense to you. When
things do not make sense you form bias and even though you might know that
something is the right thing to do, you still might not follow it because you honestly
do not believe it is in your best interest to do so.This is where awareness comes in.
Awareness is meant to change behavior by giving you a different perspective. If an
awareness session is effective, you will hear people say they never thought about the
problem the way you laid it out and now it makes sense why they need to do that.
Prior to that session they never understood why they had to do a certain thing.
Some people are just downright malicious, but most people do not follow the poli-
cies because they think they are a waste of time and they do not understand what
the value is.
While each of these three areas has value, to have a highly effective organization
requires all three to work in harmony. Policies tell the employees what to do,
training gives them the skills to do it, and awareness changes their behavior so they
understand the value of it and follow it.

341_INS_THR_10.qxd  11/20/05  3:01 PM  Page 379

This is all well and good, but why is it important to have well-informed, policy-
obedient employees? In terms of insider threat, the answer is simple: employees who
are in the trenches and working side by side with the insider threat provide your
best chance of detecting and ﬁnding the problem. Employees who sit in the cube
next to someone, who see how they act in meetings, who hear what they talk about
outside of the ofﬁce, provide your best chance of ﬁnding and weeding out people
with ill intentions.You do not want to turn everyone into moles, but the more
people that care about the organization and understand that others can cause
damage, the greater the chance they would do and act in the best interest of the
company.
Reacting to Insider Threat
As with any type of adverse event that occurs at your organization, the best way to
handle it is to have a plan, which is why most organizations have an incident
response plan and a disaster recovery plan that are tested and people are trained on.
This enables them to act with vigor and planning to see unforeseen problems. While
it is never easy when there is an adverse event at your company, proper planning can
minimize the bleeding.
In some sense, an insider attack ﬁts under the general category of incident
response.Therefore, some organizations will just use their incident response plan in
the case of any incident, whether it is internal or external, and hope for the best.
While this might work in some cases, it usually does not provide the best response
because an incident response plan at most organizations was built to handle external
incidents not internal. If you remember from Chapter 1, there are big differences
between an internal attack and an external attack.
Because they are so different, I usually prefer to either have two separate plans
or, to minimize confusion across an organization, break the incident-handling proce-
dures into two parts depending on whether it is an internal or external event.There
are many differences between the two, but in terms of incident response the fol-
lowing are some key differences:
■
Knowing it is an insider attack
■
Could involve key people
■
More strict control of information
■
Notiﬁcation procedures could be altered
■
Less chance of being publicized

Chapter 10 • Survivability
341_INS_THR_10.qxd  11/20/05  3:01 PM  Page 380

■
Greater chance for loss
■
Less chance of knowing or catching the attacker
■
Harder to ﬁx problem or prevent future attacks
■
Might not involve an actual breach
The ﬁrst big difference is knowing that it is an internal attack. With most
external attacks you are able to quickly identify the source of the problem being
external and you can quickly tell that you are under ﬁre. Having lived through many
incidents, I can tell you that it is never a fun feeling being under ﬁre; however, in
some sense I would rather be under heavy ﬁre and know exactly what the problem
is and where it is coming from, than have a sniper that is silently picking people off.
If your Web site is being defaced, if a denial of service attack is occurring, or if
someone exploited a buffer overﬂow attack and installed a rootkit, you know what
you are dealing with and you can address it.
However, with an insider attack, you usually have no idea what is going on; your
intellectual property seems to always wind up in the hands of a competitor but you
do not know why (is it coincidence or a real problem); you keep losing contracts by
a small margin and are not sure if it can be attributed to poor market analysis.The
list could go on and on. With insider threat you are not sure if you are in a war or
not, sometimes even at the end when the company is closing shop you still are not
sure if you are just paranoid or if there was a real problem. It is much harder to ﬁx a
problem when you do not know what the problem is or where it is coming from.
This is usually the hardest problem when dealing with an insider attack.
Let’s assume you know there is a problem or you have enough data points to
decide to take action.Who do you enlist to help you? Since you know the problem is
coming from within, you are not sure who to trust or who not to trust because the
attack involves potentially key people at your organization.With an external attack, the
boundary lines are clear: us versus them, and everyone at your company can be
enlisted to ﬁght off the external enemy.With internal threat, nothing is worse that
involving someone who is actually involved in the attack and playing both sides.While
you think they are helping you, they could be destroying evidence, covering up infor-
mation, or framing someone else at your organization. Nothing is worse than to put
your heart and soul into a football game and lose the game not because the other team
played better, but because your quarterback was paid off to throw the game.
Typically, with an external attack, you would want to utilize internal resources
because they are better trained, know your organization, and have your best interests
at heart. In addition, it is usually cheaper and more effective to use internal
resources. With an internal attack, it is usually recommended to use external
www.syngress.com
Survivability • Chapter 10
381
341_INS_THR_10.qxd  11/20/05  3:01 PM  Page 381

resources to handle the incident. While it is more costly and not as effective, in
essence they are unbiased and can be trusted. During an incident, having an honest
broker is the most important piece of the puzzle. It is also easier to keep a low pro-
ﬁle if external resources are being used because employees can still go about their
regular business and not do anything that looks suspicious. If you use internal
resources to investigate, the fact that key internal people are running around working
on an incident and not performing their normal jobs is usually fairly obvious and
can tip off your hand to an attacker.
Information involving the case must be tightly controlled. While in any type of
incident, you always want to be careful who you give information to and always
enforce a need to know, it becomes even more critical with an insider attack. Unlike
what we might think, anyone at any level in your organization could be involved in
an insider attack, from the lowest level to the highest level, which makes it extremely
challenging to keep strict control.To be completely paranoid, how does your com-
pany or executives know for sure that you, the person leading the investigation, is
not involved or behind it? How perfect would it be for the person investigating the
crime to be the person who committed the crime? Now that is paranoia.
Based on not knowing who was involved, during a high-alert insider attack,
normal notiﬁcation procedures might be altered. For that matter, many of the stan-
dard operating procedures that you would use during an external incident might
have to be suspended or altered because the attack is causing so much damage.This
is the reason it is usually easier to create a separate section or plan for insider attacks
as opposed to creating a long list of exceptions to your normal operating procedures.
Without a separate internal attack plan, your regular external incident response plan
is quickly turned into Swiss cheese based on all the changes and modiﬁcations that
have to be made to it.
One of the potential beneﬁts of an insider attack is there is usually less visible evi-
dence of attack, which, although it makes it harder to investigate and identify the
problem areas, also makes it easier to keep the details private with less chance of public
exposure and embarrassment.With an external attack in which your Web site has been
defaced or is not available because of a denial of service attack, it is pretty hard to deny
you have had an attack because there is visible evidence.With an internal attack there
is often no visible evidence and can usually be kept more contained.
The harder it is to control and identify, tied with the fact that the person com-
mitting the attack has access and is more covert, means that the bleeding is occur-
ring at an even quicker rate and there is a great chance for loss. With an external
attack, one of the key steps of incident response is containment, which is typically
accomplished by isolating the infected system or infected network segment.
However, with an insider attack it is usually a high-level attack against your intellec-
www.syngress.com
382
Chapter 10 • Survivability
341_INS_THR_10.qxd  11/20/05  3:01 PM  Page 382

tual property. How do you isolate your IP when it exists in both tangible and intan-
gible forms across your organization? If you cannot contain something, how do you
control potential loss?
Ideally, you want to be able to catch or stop the person who is attacking you.
With an external attack, even though sophisticated attackers will use relays and other
decoy measures, you still have an IP address of the next hop.Yes, IP addresses can
also be spoofed, especially in DDOS attacks, but at least you have an IP address or
something to use as a starting point. With an insider attack, you usually have few if
any facts and in most cases no information to even use as a starting point. Unless
you invest money and have trained experts, the chance of catching the insider with
only internal resources is minimal.
One of the other key steps in the incident response phase is eradication, which
means you have to ﬁx the problem before you put the system back on line.With
external attacks, you can usually trace the breach back to a missing patch or misconﬁg-
ured system and worse case you can put additional defense measures in place to stop
or minimize the attacker from coming back the next time and being successful.With
an internal attack, besides ﬁring all your employees, the problem lies in the inherent
nature of people having more access than they should.While controlling and limiting
access can be ﬁxed, it is not something that can be done in a reactive fashion and it
surely is not something that can be done in a short period of time.
Finally, with an internal attack there might not actually be a security breach. If
someone has legitimate access to a resource and uses it to perform his job and one
day he decides to give that information to a competitor, where is the breach?
Besides not hiring that person, what else could the company have done to prevent
that from occurring? Very little, if anything.
While insider threat is completely different from external attacks, you still need
to have a plan to enable the least amount of monetary loss. Based on the differences
between the two, it is highly recommended to either create a separate section in
your incident response plan to cover insider attacks or to create a separate insider
plan. Especially since different resources will be used and there is a high reliance on
external resources for an internal attack, different training and test procedures are
required.The ﬁrst time a plan is written it will never be correct.The only way to
maximize the efﬁciency of a plan is by truly understanding the problem and per-
forming detailed testing.

Summary
Insider threat is a big problem and will only increase in intensity as more and more
hostile entities start to understand and realize its value as it applies to digital assets.
Governments have long known the value of insider threats and the fundamental
principle behind spying and espionage. Now commercial entities are starting to
realize the value. More and more cyber-mercenaries and cyber-hit-men will pop up,
which for the right price will get you whatever information you need all through
the power of computers and technologies.
The ﬁrst part in dealing with any problem is acceptance. Hopefully you have
accepted that insider threat is occurring, it will continue to get worse, and measures
must be put in place immediately at your organization to solve it. Hopefully, if you
are an executive and reading this, you know you have to push this knowledge down
throughout your organization, raise awareness, and implement changes. If you are not
an executive and reading this, you have an even more important job to become an
evangelist for the problem and make people aware so that changes can be imple-
mented. Selling upper management and executives on new problems and issues that
they do not understand or see is not an easy job, but do not give up.The rewards
will be well worth the journey.
Once you accept that there is a problem and you have raised awareness so key
components and division across your organization understand the criticality of the
problem, the next step is to ﬁgure out your exposure point. Identifying and priori-
tizing assets is critical. If you do not know what is important, then how can you go
about protecting it? If you are having trouble ﬁguring out the critical assets, another
trick is to ask,“If I were an attacker, what would I go after?”Asking yourself questions
like what would have the most value to the competition or what information if it
appeared on the front page of the Washington Post would cause the most monetary loss
or embarrassment to the organization, helps to scope the problem.Wording the
problem in different ways is a helpful clue to be able to ﬁgure out the real answers.
After you identify the critical assets, you then calculate the risk exposure starting
with threat, working through vulnerabilities, and tying in likelihood and impact.
Once the full calculation has been performed, you ﬁgure out what the appropriate
countermeasures are, and you implement the solution. Remember that the ultimate
goal is survival.
Remember, this is a new area so there is no right way to solve the problem, just
many ways that do not work or are not effective.The trick is through trial and error
you will ﬁnd the solution. Work hard, be diligent, document your results, and I look
forward to reading the book that you are going to write once you ﬁgure out all the
answers.

Hacking a Terror Network:
The Silent Threat of Covert Channels
Russ Rogers, Matthew G. Devost
Written by a certified Arabic linguist from the Defense Language Institute with
extensive background in decoding encrypted communications, this cyber-thriller
uses a fictional narrative to provide a fascinating and realistic "insider's look"
into technically sophisticated covert terrorist communications over the Internet. The
accompanying CD-ROM allows readers to "hack along" with the story line, by
viewing the same Web sites described in the book containing encrypted, covert
communications.

Cyber Adversary Characterization:
Auditing the Hacker Mind
Tom Parker, Marcus Sachs, Eric Shaw, 
Ed Stroz, Matt Devost
The ever-increasing emphasis and reliance on the use of computers and the
Internet, has come in hand with the increased threat of cyber-crime. Many
systems and infrastructures are exceedingly vulnerable to attacks, as the com-
plexity of computer networks is growing faster than the ability to understand
and protect them. Heightened vigilance is not enough, but needs to be cou-
pled with active defensive measures to guarantee the best protection. This
book provides the reader with understanding of and an ability to anticipate
that “cyber adversary” silently waiting in the wings to attack.
