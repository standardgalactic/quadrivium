Quality of Service Overview
Quality of Service Overview
• Different service levels for different 
“classes” (types) of traffic
• SP QoS Goals
– Traffic admission control from CE
• Enforce a traffic rate per SLA
• Honor / override CE’s classification scheme
– DSCP / IP Precedence to MPLS EXP mappings
– Transit control
• Guarantee bandwidth between sites
• Prioritize important traffic flows
• Sell different transit SLAs

QoS Models
QoS Models
• IntServ QoS model
– Integrated Services
– Network devices request specific service for 
particular flow
• DiffServ QoS model
– Differentiated Services
– Flows get specific service based on traffic 
classification done by the network

Integrated Services QoS
Integrated Services QoS
• RSVP – Resource Reservation Protocol
• Original goal was for hosts to request service of 
the network
– Assumes transit networks will enforce admission 
control and honor reservations
– Doesn’t scale; transit network would need to maintain 
state for every single flow
• Abandoned with few exceptions
– MPLS TE for our purposes
• RSVP only makes reservation in “control plane”, 
not “data plane”
– DiffServ must enforce reservations

Differentiated Services QoS
Differentiated Services QoS
• Packet markings or attributes used to 
“differentiate” traffic classes
• IPv4 DiffServ
– DSCP – 6 bits = 64 classes
– IP Precedence – 3 bits = 8 classes
• MPLS DiffServ
– MPLS EXP bits – 3 bits = 8 classes
• Advanced DiffServ
– ACLs
– NBAR
• Locally Significant DiffServ
– QoS Group

MPLS VPN QoS Classification
MPLS VPN QoS Classification
• Marking can occur at many places
– Am I dealing with IP packet, VPN label, TE label, or transport 
label?
• IP to MPLS
– VPN label imposed on IP packet at PE-CE ingress
• MPLS to MPLS
– Push
• Transport label imposed on VPN label
• MPLS TE label imposed on transport / VPN label
– Swap
• Transport label disposed, new transport label imposed
– Pop
• Transport label disposed to reveal VPN
• MPLS TE label disposed to reveal transport / VPN label
• MPLS to IP
– VPN label disposed to reveal IP packet

Ultimate Hop Popping
Ultimate Hop Popping
• Last hop in MPLS network advertises 
implicit null label by default
– Causes “penultimate” hop to pop label
• Popping label destroys MPLS EXP policy
• Ultimate hop popping forces penultimate 
hop to send a blank label (explicit null) to 
the ultimate hop
– router(config)# mpls ldp explicit-null
• Allows end-to-end propagation of MPLS 
EXP

MPLS VPN QoS Models
MPLS VPN QoS Models
• Uniform Mode
– CE IPv4 marking is mapped to MPLS EXP at 
SP ingress
– SP MPLS EXP may be remarked in transit
– IPv4 egress marking on PE-CE link based on 
remarked MPLS EXP
– Customer marking is dependent on SP 
marking

Queueing Overview
Queueing Overview
• Most QoS methods are queueing mechanisms
• Affects how traffic is processed in the output 
queue
• Output queue is a buffer before the hardware 
queue, or transmit ring (TxR) 
• Queueing is only outbound

Queueing Mechanisms
Queueing Mechanisms
• Bandwidth guarantee
– Guarantee minimum space in the output 
queue
• Legacy custom-queue
• MQC “bandwidth”
– Congestion management
• Deal with congestion once it occurs

admitted

• Random Detection
– Drop traffic before congestion occurs
• Legacy “random-detect”
• MQC “random-detect”
– Weighted based on IP Precedence or DSCP
– Congestion avoidance

Traffic Policing
Traffic Policing
• Limit the output or input rate of the 
interface
– Legacy “rate-limit” (CAR)
– MQC “police”
• Not a queueing mechanism
– Does not buffer traffic for later transmission
• Can be used to enforce rate or remark
– Conform action vs exceed action

Interface
• AKA Class-Based Weighted Fair 
Queueing
• Allows multiple QoS methods in same 
direction on same interface

Bandwidth Reservation Example
Bandwidth Reservation Example
• The customer connected via VPN_A has a 
Service Level Agreement which specifies 
that 5Mbps of transit is guaranteed 
between their sites.  Using MPLS EXP 3 
configure the SP network to support this 
guarantee including the egress PE-CE 
links.  Do not modify the markings in any 
customer packets while implementing this 
policy.

Priority Queueing Example
Priority Queueing Example
• The customer connected via VPN_B has a 
Service Level Agreement which specifies 
that 1Mbps of VoIP transit will be 
prioritized between their sites.  The 
customer will be sending this traffic into 
the SP network with a DSCP of EF.  Using 
MPLS EXP 5 configure the SP network to 
support this prioritization.

Traffic Shaping Example
Traffic Shaping Example
• The Ethernet link between R1 and R5 is 
through a transparent VPN carrier.  This 
carrier has agreed to accept up to 
7.5Mbps on this link.  All traffic above this 
rate will be dropped.  Configure the SP 
network so that traffic is buffered locally 
instead of being dropped by the carrier.

Traffic Policing Example
Traffic Policing Example
• The SLA for VPN_A dictates that the SP 
network will drop all traffic above 5Mbps.  
Configure traffic policing on in the SP to 
reflect this agreement.

Random Detection Example
Random Detection Example
• The customer attached to VPN_B uses 
DSCP values to offer differentiated 
services throughout their network.  They 
have requested that the PE-CE links for 
their VPN connections be configured to 
avoid tail drop as packet are admitted onto 
the link, and for packets with a higher 
DSCP value to be less likely to be 
dropped.  Configure the SP network to 
reflect this request.
