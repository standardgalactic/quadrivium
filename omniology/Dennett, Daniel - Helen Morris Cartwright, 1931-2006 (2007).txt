Memorial 
Minutes 
165 
Helen Morris Cartwright, 1931-2006 
Helen Morris Cartwright, professor of philosophy em?rita at Tufts University, 
died at Massachusetts 
General 
Hospital 
in Boston on May 
14, 2006. Her 
degrees were all from the University of Michigan, with an AB with Distinction 
in 1954, and a Ph.D. 
in 1963. After holding brief teaching appointments 
at Michigan, 
Berkeley, Eastern Michigan 
University, and Wayne 
State, she 
joined the Tufts Department 
in 1968, was 
promoted 
to associate 
professor 
in 1973, and full professor 
in 1988. She retired in 1997. Her seminal work 
in 
metaphysics, 
logic, and the philosophy 
of language, and especially where 
the three fields overlap, continues 
to frame some of the central questions 
in these areas. She is best known for her pioneering analysis of mass 
terms 
and the metaphysics 
of "stuff" in such classic papers 
as "Heraclitus and 
the Bath Water" 
(1965), 
"Quantities" 
(1970), 
"Amounts and Measures 
of 
Amount" 
(1975), and "Parts and Partitives: Notes on What 
Things Are Made 
of" (1984). 
In addition 
to many 
other papers 
on these topics, she also 
published 
important work on Aristotle, personal 
identity, and plurality. 
Helen was 
a kind but demanding 
teacher, eliciting a degree 
of 
precision 
and accuracy 
from her students (and colleagues) 
that they had 
typically never aspired 
to or imagined possible. 
Her metaphysics 
course 
was 
legendarily challenging, 
but also regarded as the backbone 
of Tufts' 
Masters 
program. Veterans 
of that course 
invariably found themselves 
solidly grounded 
and finely tuned for further work when 
they continued 
their Ph.D. 
studies 
elsewhere. 
Helen 
created 
the first undergraduate 
courses 
in formal logic and philosophy 
of language at Tufts; her course 
in ancient 
philosophy 
became 
a model 
for how 
to connect 
current 
problems of analytic metaphysics 
with the issues made 
famous by the pre 
Socratics, Plato, and Aristotle. She ably served the university on its tenure 
and promotion 
committee, 
its curriculum 
committee, 
and more 
than a 
dozen other committees, 
and was 
an incisive commentator 
and raiser of 
objections 
at the Philosophy Department's 
Friday colloquia. 
In 1982 she was elected a visiting life 
member 
of Clare Hall at Cambridge 
University, where 
she often visited with her husband, 
the philosopher 
Richard Cartwright. Helen and Dick pursued a lively and informed interest 
in jazz, and constructed an enviable 
library of records to complement 
their 
joint library of philosophy books. 
Helen 
Cartwright was 
a philosopher's 
philosopher, 
who 
will 
be 
remembered 
for her metaphysical 
imagination, 
her 
intense devotion 
to philosophical 
rigor, and her good-humored 
and graceful scholarship. 
When 
she posed 
a question, 
it was 
always crystal clear, and she always 
wanted 
the answer 
to be just as clear, and as carefully defended 
as any 
claim could be. She set the highest standards and 
lived up to them, an 
ideal role model 
for her students and colleagues. We mourn 
her passing 
and miss her presence.
