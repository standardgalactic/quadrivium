Preface
When we started writing the manuscript for this book, we had three principles in
mind:
– Focus on the academic audience.
– Use simple language.
– Match the theoretical content with numerical examples.
We are glad we have been able to stick to these principles.
This book has been written for undergraduate business as well as industrial
engineering students who are taking a course on inventory management or opera-
tions management. We believe the content presented in this book is just enough and
has been organized well to keep the reader engaged. We have worked out several
numerical problems in inventory management. This would particularly come in
handy for instructors teaching a course on inventory management.
This book has been divided into four parts with the ﬁrst part dealing with basic
inventory management concepts and terms, including relevant inventory costs and
methods of computing those. Toward the end of Chap. 2, we present a case study –
Rosettas Tortilleria. This case study has been treated as a running example.
Different scenarios for the same case have been presented throughout the book to
give readers a common ground for learning. We believe the reader would be able to
relate to reality and learn the concepts faster.
The second part of the book has four chapters. In these chapters, we discuss
single-item inventory models including items with deterministic demand (without
and with shortages allowed), dynamic demand (quantity discount), time-varying
demand, and stochastic inventory models. More than 40 solved problems and 4 case
studies have been presented in this part of the book.
The third part of the book deals with inventory models involving multiple items.
This part of the book has two chapters in which we discuss inventory models
subject to constraints (budget, space, and number of orders) as well as selective
inventory control techniques. Coordinated replenishment of items is also covered in
v

this part of the book. Solved numerical problems and case studies have also been
included in this part.
The fourth and ﬁnal part of the book discusses advanced inventory models
including models for perishable and style items, maintenance and repairable inven-
tory, and two-stage, multi-echelon inventory models. This may not be part of an
undergraduate course curriculum; however, those with a keen mind on inventory
management would ﬁnd this section of the book very interesting.

Introduction to Inventory Management
1.1
What Is Inventory?
APICS1 Dictionary (2015) deﬁnes inventory as
Those stocks or items used to support production (raw materials and work-in-process
items), supporting activities (maintenance, repair and operating supplies), and customer
service (ﬁnished goods and spare parts).
Items that are used in production include the following:
•
Raw materials: These are primary ingredients that are used in making of a
product. For a ﬁrm manufacturing automobile tires, for example, natural rubber
would be the raw material. Leather (or fabric) and plastic would be primary raw
materials for a ﬁrm manufacturing shoes. Manufacturers procure raw materials
and transform those into ﬁnished goods using their production processes.
•
Work-in-process: These are the stock of materials on which the production
processes have started but have not been completed. These materials are not
yet ready for sale.
Items that are used in supporting manufacturing activities are referred to as
Maintenance, Repair and Operating (MRO) supplies. Transformation of materials
from their raw form into one that is saleable requires production equipment.
Production equipment are characterized by failures. These equipment need main-
tenance activities to be performed that maximize their availability. Performing
maintenance activities on production equipment requires resources – for example,
a mechanic may detect an oil leak while performing a simple cleaning operation on
an equipment. Fixing the oil leak may require new oil seals. These oil seals, while
not used directly in the production processes, are absolutely required by the
production processes. It is important that the manufacturing ﬁrm also stocks oil

seals in their inventory system. Note that these items are supporting the manufactur-
ing processes and are not sold by the ﬁrm stocking it. In this book, we refer to these
items as maintenance items or maintenance materials.
As per APICS Dictionary, items used in customer service include ﬁnished goods
and spare parts. From a manufacturing perspective, ﬁnished goods are items that
have been completely transformed, and are now ready for sale. Tires, shoes, etc. are
examples of ﬁnished goods. Firms also manufacture parts of equipment that are sold
separately. These are called spare parts.
Organizations treat and classify inventory differently depending on whether they
are merchandisers (i.e., ﬁrms that only trade ready-to-sell materials) or manufac-
turers (i.e., ﬁrms that transform materials). Manufacturers usually categorize their
inventory into raw materials, work-in-process, and ﬁnished goods. On the other
hand, merchandisers buy materials that are ready for sale and sell it to customers.
Merchandisers, therefore, have just one classiﬁcation for inventory.
Whether a ﬁrm is manufacturing products, providing services, or just trading, all
operations of the ﬁrm need inventory. Managers in charge of inventory are expected
to ensure the stock of items required by their ﬁrm is available at the right time and in
the required quantity. Table 1.1 illustrates the types of inventory used by different
sectors of the industry.
Notice that while cleaning liquid is a supporting material for the pizza outlet, the
same is considered to be a raw material for a ﬁrm engaged in cleaning services.

Introduction to Inventory Management

1.2
Functions of Inventory
Firms maintain inventory because of economic reasons. Carrying inventory makes
it more economical to produce their products than by not carrying it (Harding and
Harding 2001). Also, inventory carried by ﬁrms have some purpose (or function), of
which following are some important ones (see Mahadevan 2015; Hill and Hill
2012):
•
Decoupling
•
Cycle (or Cyclical)
•
Pipeline
•
Buffer
These functions are described brieﬂy in the following section.
1.2.1
Decoupling Inventory
Decoupling inventory is one that detaches a manufacturing process from another.
Manufacturing a product typically requires several workstations, usually in a
sequence. Raw material is fed to the ﬁrst workstation, and after processing it is
sent to the second workstation, and so on, until the last workstation in the sequence
ﬁnishes the product. Workstations have different processing capacities – some may
ﬁnish processing faster while others may take more time. A workstation in the
production line may also encounter a failure. If this happens, all upstream work-
stations have to wait until the failed workstation is back up online. Decoupling
inventory is an intermediary inventory maintained between two workstations. The
function of this inventory is to help smoothen the workﬂow between workstations
and minimize the impact of ﬂuctuations.
1.2.2
Cycle Inventory
An organization does not procure all input materials at one go. In most cases, they
also do not order one unit at a time. They order in batches, usually in lot sizes that
are larger than those demanded by customers (see Chopra and Meindl 2010,
pp. 246). For example, a manufacturing ﬁrm requiring 50,000 tons annually may
order 4000 tons of steel to start with. The next order would be placed when the
on-hand inventory is nearly depleted. Cycle inventory is the result of ordering
materials in batches. Batch ordering is preferred by ﬁrms because they derive
beneﬁts of economies of scale.
1.2
Functions of Inventory
5

Several economic factors go into the determination of optimal batch size which
will be dealt with in the following chapters. Mathematically, if Q is the size of the
order, then CI, the average cycle inventory, is given by
CI ¼ Q
2
ð1:1Þ
1.2.3
Pipeline Inventory
Manufacturing organizations procure input materials from their suppliers. The
ordered materials are not received instantaneously. There is a delay between
placement of orders and receipt of materials due to geographical distance between
the supplier and the manufacturer. Inventory that is in transit (in trucks, ships, etc.)
is referred to as pipeline inventory. Function of this inventory it to account for
uncertainties in supply lead time. Mathematically,
PI ¼ DL
ð1:2Þ
where PI is the pipeline inventory, D is the demand, and L is the lead time. It should
be noted that the units for demand and lead time must be the same. That is, if
demand is expressed in units per day, the lead time must also be in days.
Solved Problem 1.1
At the beginning of every month, a bicycle manufacturer, based in Monterrey,
Mexico, places an order to procure lightweight steel tubes from their suppliers
based in Leon, Mexico. Their average requirement is 1000 tons per week, and the
procurement lead time is 14 days. Determine cycle and pipeline inventory. Assume
4 weeks in a month.
Solution
Average weekly demand for steel tubes is 1000 tons. The monthly demand (assum-
ing 4 weeks in a month) is 4000 tons. The cycle inventory from Eq. 1.1 is
CI ¼ Q
2 ¼ 4000
2
¼ 2000 units
Since the procurement lead time is 14 days (or 2 weeks), using Eq. 1.2, we get
pipeline inventory. Substituting the values, we get
PI ¼ DL ¼ 1000  2 ¼ 2000 tons
1.2.4
Buffer Inventory
Buffer inventory, or safety stock, is maintained by ﬁrms to counter uncertainty in
demand. Buffer inventory reduces the probability of running out of stock.

1.3
Inventory Management: Key Issues
As discussed earlier, inventory managers are expected to ensure the stock of items
required by their ﬁrm is available at the right time, and in the required quantity.
With this perspective, management of inventory in any ﬁrm involves answering the
following three questions (Anderson et al. 2016; Gaither 1987; Silver et al. 1998):
(a) How frequently should the inventory status for an item be reviewed?
(b) When should a replenishment order be placed?
(c) What should be the order size?
While at the outset, answering these questions may look to be very simple; however,
the characteristics of items being managed make inventory management complex and
challenging. Following are some of the characteristics of inventory items.
•
Demand: This is a key characteristic of an item in any inventory system.
Demand is generated by people outside the ﬁrm, and therefore is mostly uncon-
trollable (see Naddor 1966). Nevertheless, the pattern of demand may be studied
to address the inventory management problem of the ﬁrm. Table 1.2 shows a list
of terms that may be used to describe demand.
•
Replenishment Lead Time: Lead time is the time between placement of a replen-
ishment order and the actual receipt of stock. Just like in the case of demand, lead
times for an item may be constant, varying, or may be known with a probability
distribution. Theoretically, in some cases, the lead times may be very small and
insigniﬁcant. This case may be referred to as instantaneous replenishment.
•
Inventory Level and Review Times: The inventory level of an item may be known
at all times. In some cases, it may not be possible (or may not be cost-effective)
to monitor the level of an item at all times. Instead, the level of items is reviewed
at certain predetermined times.
•
Lifetime & Reparability: An item may not always have an indeﬁnite lifetime. Its
utility value may drop to zero at some point after which it may not have any
takers (Nahmias 2005). Also, an item may fail but may be repairable.
Characteristics of an item would be different from one another, and so would be
their inventory decisions.
Table 1.2 Terms used to describe demand
Term
Meaning
Deterministic
The size of the demand for an item is known precisely, in advance
Constant
The size of the demand for an item remains the same from one period to another
Varying
The size of the demand is not constant and keeps changing between periods
Stochastic/
probabilistic
Demand is not known, but based on historical data we may be able to ﬁt it to a
probability distribution

Inventory Management: An Overview
of Mathematical Models
An inventory model must essentially address the three main issues mentioned in the
previous section, keeping in view characteristics of items being managed. In this
section, we present a classiﬁcation of mathematical models that have been devel-
oped to address these problems. Several factors have been used by researchers to
classify inventory models Vrat (2014). Some of these factors include:
•
Timing of inventory status review (continuous, periodic)
•
Nature of demand of item (deterministic, probabilistic, varying by period, etc.)
•
Nature of replenishment lead time (constant, varying, etc.)
•
Number of items under management (single, multiple)
•
Number of locations or supply sources (single, multi-echelon)
•
Possibility of repetitive orders (single period, multiple periods)
•
Lifetime of items being managed (perishable, inﬁnite lifetime)
•
Other factors (reparability of items, constraints, quantity discounts, coordinated
replenishment, etc.)
Figure 1.1 shows a classiﬁcation of inventory models. This classiﬁcation is by no
means exhaustive, but it does give the reader an idea of the breadth of inventory
management solutions. This classiﬁcation has been used to structure the contents of
this book.

Summary
In this chapter, we discussed the meaning of the term inventory and described the
different types of inventories – raw materials, work-in-process, ﬁnished goods, and
maintenance items – used by businesses. There are several reasons why businesses
hold inventories. Decoupling inventories are held to detach a process from another
while cycle and pipeline inventories are held for minimizing inventory costs. Buffer
or safety stocks are held to minimize uncertainty in demand.
We also learned in this chapter that inventory management revolves around
ﬁnding answers to three most important questions:
(a) How frequently should the inventory status for an item be reviewed?
(b) When should a replenishment order be placed? and
(c) What should be the order size?
Inventory managers need to consider the characteristics of items – such as
demand, replenishment lead time, the timing of review, and item lifetime – being
managed while answering these questions.
We also presented a classiﬁcation of inventory models that gives the reader an
idea of the breadth of inventory management solutions.

Case Study: Tequila Production Process
Julius Tequila is a world famous distillery located in the state of Guanajuato,
Mexico. The distillery makes the Julius brand of premium tequila. The distillery
procures tons of full-grown agave pi~nas2 from the farms all over Mexico. An agave
plant that has grown for about 8 years to the size of a soccer ball is considered to be
good for producing tequila. The pi~nas are ﬁrst cut into several uniform pieces and
washed with clean water. The cut pieces of pi~nas, the insides of which are white in
color, are then fed into an autoclave, a chamber that functions like a pressure
cooker. The pieces of raw pi~na are cooked for about 72 h in the autoclave. At the
end of the cooking process, the color of the pi~na turns golden brown.
The cooked golden brown pi~na pieces are then conveyed to a crusher where a
screw-crushing facility, consisting of several parallel rotating screw crushers, is
employed to continuously crush and extract the pi~na juice. The juice extracted from
the pi~na is separated from its ﬁber using a simple, sieve-based ﬁltering process. The
distilled juice is then transferred to another chamber where it is mixed with yeast.
The mixture of juice and yeast is allowed to ferment and settle. This settling down
process takes a long time, and it does so in three layers. The top (the head) and the
bottom layers (the tail) of the settled partially fermented liquid is used in making
2Fruit or the bulb found at the base of the Agave plant.

lower grades of tequila while the middle one is used in making the premium
version.
The different versions of the partially fermented liquid are then transferred to
wooden barrels that are stored in dark, cool storage chambers for several hours
(minimum 20,000).
After more than 2 years of storage, the liquid is taken out of the barrels and
transferred into blue-hued bottles (capacity of 2 liters each). These bottles with
tequila are now ready for commercial sale. These bottles are ferried to distributor
warehouses around the world.
Mild, food-quality compliant detergents are used to clean the continuous process
machines before the next load of agave pi~nas are loaded into the system.
Case Study Questions
From the above case, classify the inventory in tequila production into
(a) raw materials
(b) work-in-process, and
(c) ﬁnished goods inventory

Practice Problems
Problem 1.1
A shoe manufacturer has a daily requirement of 100 shoe soles. The manufacturer
places an order for a batch size of 1000 shoe soles from a supplier. Once an order is
placed, it takes 3 days to reach the manufacturing location. Determine cycle and
pipeline inventory.
Answer
Cycle inventory is 500 shoe soles. Pipeline inventory is 300 soles.
Problem 1.2
Review different textbooks on Inventory Management from your library. Compile a
list of deﬁnitions for the term “inventory” used by the authors of those books.
Problem 1.3
Consider a shoe manufacturing facility. Identify all types of inventory used in
manufacturing one model of a fast-moving shoe.

Chapter 2
Inventory Control Systems: Design Factors
2.1
Design Factors
One of the takeaways from the previous chapter is that the core of the inventory
management problem is to address the following issues:
(a) How frequently should the inventory status for an item be reviewed?
(b) When should a replenishment order be placed?
(c) What should be the order size?
An inventory control system is one that integrates these three factors into one
whole. Frequency, timing, and order size are the key design factors of any inventory
control system. Each of these design factors is discussed in detail in this section.
2.1.1
Review Frequency
Depending on the nature of their business, a ﬁrm may decide to review the status of
inventory either continuously or at discrete, but ﬁxed, points in time. A continuous
review inventory system is one where the inventory status of an item (or items) is
known at all times (Silver et al. 1998; Nahmias 2005). An example of this would be
a retail shop using a Point-of-Sale (POS) system to record incoming and outgoing
materials. Every time a sale is made, the POS system captures the information of
the product sold and updates the stock level of the product. This way the owner of
the retail shop has real-time information on the stock levels of products and can
make appropriate inventory decisions.
A periodic review system is one where the stock level is reviewed every T units
of time. In other words, if the ﬁrst review is made at time 0, the next review is made
at time T, the third review at time 2 T, and so on. An example of this system would
be a pharmacy that sells drugs and medicines to general public. Every Monday, a

representative of a drug distributor arrives at a pharmacy to sell drugs and medi-
cines. The pharmacist quickly reviews the stock of the drugs on hand and makes a
purchase decision. In ﬁrms that use this system, the stock levels are not known
between review points. No action is taken if an item runs out of stock between
review periods.
2.1.2
Timing of Replenishment Order
The timing of an order is another key concern for inventory managers. Ideally, the
timing must be such that the ordered items are received just as the last item on hand
gets consumed (or sold). With regard to timing of placement of an order, two
options are available:
•
Place an order the moment the current inventory level reaches a predetermined
level.
•
Place an order at predetermined review points
While the ﬁrst option seems to be feasible for continuous review systems, the
second one would ﬁt a periodic review system.
2.1.3
Size of Replenishment Order
The size of a replenishment order depends on several factors such as the ordering
cost, the holding cost, the shortage cost, etc. If we order less, then we would need to
order more frequently. This may increase ordering costs. There also exists the risk
of running out of stock and the inability to meet customer demand. A bigger order
size may result in higher carrying costs and the inability to store all received
materials due to limited space. A good inventory system would be one where the
order size is just right and takes into account all these factors. Again, two options
are most popular:
•
Determine and place an order for a ﬁxed quantity that minimizes the inventory
costs.
•
Compute an order quantity such that it takes the stock level back to predetermine
maximum level.
A continuous review inventory system can be designed considering both options.
A periodic review would be a good ﬁt for the second option.

Inventory Control Systems: Design Factors

2.2
Review of Inventory Control Systems
As discussed earlier, an inventory control system is one that integrates the three
design factors into one whole. While adopting an inventory control system,1 a ﬁrm
must keep in view the design factors discussed in the previous section and address
those appropriately. Several combinations and variants of inventory control sys-
tems are available in literature. The following are among the popular ones:
•
Continuous Review, Fixed Order Quantity (s, Q) System.
•
Continuous Review, Order-Up-to-Level (s, S) System.
•
Periodic Review, Order-Up-to-Level (T, S) System.
In this section, we discuss each of the above in detail.
2.2.1
Continuous Review, Fixed Order
Quantity (s, Q) System
In a ﬁrm that uses a continuous review system, the inventory position of an item is
monitored continuously and is known at all times. Inventory position of an item is
deﬁned as the number of items held currently in stock plus the number of items on
order. As demand arises, items are withdrawn from inventory. Simultaneously, the
inventory position is updated. This process continues until the inventory level
reaches a predetermined level, s, referred to as the reorder point. At this point, a
new replenishment order of size Q is placed, which is ﬁlled after time L, referred to
as the lead time. Receipt of the order increases the inventory position. The process
of order-point, order-quantity system is illustrated in Fig. 2.1.
This system is also known as the (s, Q) system and the two-bin system.2 Firms
that adopt a continuous review system must decide on the following with respect to
managing their inventory:
•
An optimal ﬁxed order size, Q.
•
A reorder level, s.
Chapters 3 and 6 of this book deal with computation of these decision variables
as well as the assumptions involved. Supermarkets and large retail stores are
examples of organizations that would beneﬁt from using this type of inventory
system.
1Few authors use the term Inventory Control Policy.
2In real-life implementation, an item is stored in two bins. Items are withdrawn from the ﬁrst bin as
demand arises. The moment the ﬁrst bin is empty an order is placed. The second bin acts as the
reorder point.
2.2
Review of Inventory Control Systems

2.2.2
Continuous Review, Order-Up-to-Level (s, S) System
This continuous review-based inventory control system is similar to the order-point,
order-level system with one difference – the order quantity in this system is
variable. This system is also referred to as the (s, S) system or the Min–Max
system.3 When the inventory level reaches a predetermined level, s, referred to as
the reorder point, a replenishment order of size Q is placed so as to raise the
inventory level to the maximum level, S. Please note the order size Q in this system
is variable. The decision variables in this system are as follows:
•
A reorder level, s.
•
The maximum inventory level, S.
•
A variable order size, Q, that would bring the inventory level back up to S.
The process of order-point, order-up-to-level system is illustrated in Fig. 2.2.
2.2.3
Periodic Review, Order-Up-to-Level (T, S) System
In this periodic review-based inventory control system, also called the (T, S)
system, inventory level of items is reviewed at predetermined, ﬁxed points in
time. If the ﬁrst status review happens at time T, the second review would be

carried out at time 2T, and so on. Following are the decision variables in organi-
zations that use this system:
•
An optimal ﬁxed time, T, between replenishment orders.
•
The maximum inventory level, S.
•
A variable order size, Q. The order size is computed at the time of review.
Depending on the inventory level (amount of inventory of hand and on order) at
the time of review, the order size is computed that would bring the inventory
level back up to S.
When the duration between review periods is long, there is a possibility of
inventory position falling to low levels. In some cases, stockout situations may
also be encountered (Fig. 2.3).
Table 2.1 shows a comparison of these three inventory control systems.
Other variants of inventory systems do exist in practice, but the ones described
above are among the popular ones. Chapters 3 and 6 of this book describe the
determination of the decision variables such as the reorder level, s, the order
quantity, Q, the maximum permissible inventory level S, and the optimal time
between review points, T.

Inventory Costs
An inventory control system that minimizes the total inventory costs would be the
one an organization needs to adopt (Anderson et al. 2016; Chopra and Meindl 2010;
Gaither 1987). In this section, we discuss the relevant costs involved in inventory
management and the method to compute those with a common example.

Consider a vegetable vendor that procures fresh vegetables each day from a
wholesale market and sells it to retail customers. The vegetable vendor visits the
wholesale market early in the morning to procure large quantities of fresh vegeta-
bles and fruits. He invests some money to procure the same, and hopes to sell those
to individuals and households later. Once the items are procured, the vendor trans-
ports these items to his retail outlet. On reaching the retail outlet, his assistant helps
him unload and arrange some of them neatly in pallets in the front desk where
customers can see, inspect, and purchase. Remaining items are taken to the cold
storage at the back of the outlet where they would be stored temporarily. Through-
out the day, customers arrive at the retail outlet to purchase vegetables and fruits of
their choice. As the stock of items in the front desk gets lower, the vendor’s assistant

replenishes those pallets with items stored in the cold storage. The vendor and his
assistant service customer requests in exchange for money. Toward evening, one of
the following events may happen:
•
All items that were procured in the morning have been sold, and no more
customer requests may be serviced.
•
A few items are still unsold, but since it is late evening no more customers may
be expected. These items, if good for sale may continue to remain in the cold
storage overnight and would be made available for sale the next morning. Items
that are not good for sale are discarded.
Inventory costs are generally categorized into three types – carrying costs,
ordering costs, and shortage costs. Methods of computing these types of costs
with reference to the vegetable vendor case are described in detail in the following
subsections.
2.3.1
Carrying Costs
Inventory carrying cost4 is a cost associated with temporary storage of an item
until it is sold. The carrying costs, Ch, expressed in terms of $ per unit per year, is
given by
Ch ¼ iC
ð2:1Þ
where
Ch is the carrying (or holding) cost; i is the inventory carrying rate, expressed in
% per year, and C is the unit price (cost) of the item, also expressed in $ per unit.
Assuming an inventory carrying rate of 25% per year, an item that has a cost of
$100 would have a carrying cost of Ch ¼ 0.25  100 ¼ $25 per year (or $75 if it is
held in inventory for 3 years). In this case, we assumed an inventory carrying rate.
Let us now discuss the method to arrive at the inventory carrying rate, i. With
reference to the vegetable vendor scenario, the inventory carrying rate, i, is an
aggregation of the following cost components:
•
Cost of capital: The vegetable vendor initially invests a large amount of money
in procuring items that are meant for sale in future. Instead of investing money in
procuring these items, the vendor could invest the money in an alternative
proposal and reap proﬁts. This is referred to as opportunity cost and also as the
cost of capital. This cost is usually expressed in terms of percentage.
•
Cost of storage: It would cost the vegetable vendor to provide physical space to
store the procured items. This would include components such as the rent he has
4Some researchers refer to this cost also as holding costs or storage costs. We use the term holding
cost and carrying cost interchangeably in this book.
2.3

to pay for the retail outlet and the cost of making available the cold storage
facility.
•
Cost of inventory risk: Some items may get damaged during transportation.
Some items may deteriorate during the day. These items may not be ﬁt for sale
and will have to be disposed off.
•
Cost of servicing inventory: This includes taxes that the vendor needs to pay as
well as the cost of insuring the items. It also includes the cost of people (wages)
as well as maintenance of vehicles (such as forklift trucks), if any, involved in
physical handling of materials inside the storage area/warehouse.

(c) The total annual carrying cost for 15 items that cost $20 per unit
(d) The total carrying cost for 15 items that cost $20 per unit and are held in
inventory for a period of 2 years
Solution
(a) Refer to discussions in Sect. 2.3.1. The carrying rate is an aggregation of
• Cost of capital (8.50%);
• Cost of storage (3.50%);
• Cost of inventory risk (6.50%);
• Cost of inventory servicing (0.25% þ 1.00%).
Therefore, the carrying rate is
¼ 8:50 þ 3:50 þ 6:50 þ 0:25 þ 1:00 ¼ 19:75%per year:
(b) Using Eq. 2.1, we can compute the annual carrying cost of an item that costs
$20 per unit, which is
Ch ¼ 19:75
100  20 ¼ $3:95:
The carrying cost is $3.95 per unit per year.
(c) The total annual carrying cost of 15 items that cost $20 per unit is
Ch ¼ 19:75
100  20  15 ¼ $59:25:
The total carrying cost is $59.25 per year.
(d) The total carrying cost for 15 items that cost $20 per unit held in inventory over
a 2-year period would be
Ch ¼ 19:75
100  20  15  2 ¼ $118:50:
The total carrying cost over a 2-year period is $118.50.
2.3.2
Ordering Costs
Ordering cost is the cost associated with placing an order for an item and
receiving it into the inventory system. It consists of the following components
(Mahadevan 2015):
•
Cost of Administration: This cost is equivalent to the time and effort expended in
preparing a purchase order. Consider the vegetable vendor example. The vendor
would need to spend a good amount of time determining the amount and type of
2.3
Inventory Costs
21

vegetables and fruits he would need to purchase the next day. He would need to
consider factors like the shelf life of the item as well as the amount already
available in stock, besides an estimate of the likely demand. He would also spend
some time ﬁnding the right supplier as well as negotiating a good price. All this
effort and time is part of the administrative cost.
•
Cost of Transportation: It would cost the vendor to ship the procured items from
the local wholesale market to his retail outlet. This includes cost of loading and
unloading.
•
Cost of Inspection: There is a possibility that some of the items may get damaged
in transit. On receipt of materials at his retail outlet, the vendor and his assistant
would inspect and segregate the items. This time and effort would equate to the
cost of inspection.
•
Other Costs: Certain events may require the vendor to expedite the procurement
process. The cost incurred for expediting is also part of ordering cost. Some
organizations may have computer systems to maintain inventory of items. This
cost of recordkeeping is also part of ordering process.
In this book, the ordering cost is represented by Co. Figure 2.5 shows a
sample breakup of the ordering costs, while Table 2.3 illustrates a typical
computation of ordering costs per order for an organization. As can be seen
from Table 2.3, the total expenses toward placing orders in a given period
amount to $165,245. Since the number of orders placed (i.e., generated by
the purchase department) in that period is 3406, the ordering cost is set as
$165,245/3406 ¼ $48.5 per order.

2.3.3
Shortage Costs
The cost incurred by an organization when it is unable to satisfy a demand, a
situation referred to as a stockout, is called shortage cost.5 Two scenarios may be
possible in the event of a stockout:
•
The demand may be back-ordered: Let us go back to the vegetable vendor
example. A customer arrives at the retail outlet to buy a speciﬁc vegetable.
Unfortunately, the vendor has run out of stock of that item. It is possible that the
customer may be willing to wait and ask the vendor to supply the same later in
the day. In this case, the vendor would have to either (a) place a new order and
ask his regular supplier to expedite the same, or (b) procure this item from
another supplier at a higher price in the local market and deliver it to the
customer. The additional cost incurred in these situations can be considered to
be the cost of back-ordering.
•
The sale would be lost: In this situation, the customer requesting the speciﬁc
vegetable would not be willing to wait, and instead go to a competitor. This
would result in a loss of proﬁt for the vendor.

In this book, the shortage cost is represented by Cs. Let us now look at a simple
method to compute shortage cost (Naddor 1966). Table 2.4 shows the data neces-
sary for computation of shortage costs.
Let us assume that the vegetable vendor procures exactly 12 kg of tomatoes each
day from the wholesaler. Table 2.4 shows the demand, beginning inventory and
ending inventory of tomatoes, in kg. Notice the stockout (of 1 kg) on Day 4 in the
week. Average shortage during the year is therefore 1
7  52 ¼ 7:4 kg. If the cost of
incurring shortages is $2 per kg per year, then the annual shortage cost.
Cs ¼ 7:4  2 ¼ $14:8 per year:
The solution assumes that the demand is back-ordered. What is presented here is
a very simpliﬁed solution. In reality, computation of the cost of incurring shortages
is extremely complex.

Running Example: Managing Inventory
at Rosettas Tortilleria
In this section, we present a running example (case study), parts of which would be
used in each of the following chapters.
Rosettas Tortilleria (“Rosetta’s”) is a family-run business in the southern part of
Leon, Mexico. They produce a range of food products. Established in 1985, they
have seen their market share grow rapidly. Currently, their market share is around
8%. One of the reasons they are popular in Leon is, unlike their competitors, they do
not add any preservatives. They have recently set up a large 8000 sq. ft. kitchen and
are equipped with very efﬁcient equipment. During the initial years, they did
business like anyone would – based on intuition. They have now grown to a stage
where a regime of strict control over materials and processes is the only way to
manage the business. They have, therefore, hired the right kind of people and are
keen they implement scientiﬁc inventory control at the earliest.
Tortillas is the staple food in Mexico. Rosetta’s produces different varieties of
tortillas, but their fast-moving product is the corn-ﬂavored tortilla. More than 30%

of their revenues come from just this product. Inventory managers at Rosetta’s
manage a large number of materials (“items”) that go into the production of food
products. Characteristics of a sample of 16 key items used at Rosetta’s are shown in
Table 2.5.
Inventory managers at Rosetta’s review the stock of items in the stores contin-
uously. Because of their investment in computers and technology, they have up-to-
the-minute information on stock levels of each of the items. The characteristics of
an item in the list are very different from the others in terms of demand pattern, lead
times, costs, etc. The managers know that each of these items would need to be
managed differently. An in-depth analysis of some of these items is presented in the
following sections:
2.4.1
Steady, Constant Demand Items
Rosetta’s consumes 7200 liters of vegetable oil each year in production of food
products, including tortillas. (This is roughly 20 liters each day, assuming they work
360 days a year.) The demand for vegetable oil is fairly stable and steady each
month. They buy vegetable oil from Oxxa, their prime supplier. On an average, it
costs Rosetta’s $80 to place an order. Accountants at Rosetta’s use an inventory
carrying rate of 30% per year. Oxxa has the ability to supply the entire ordered
quantity in one lot. The storage area in Rosetta’s is small. On some occasions,
managers have not been able to ﬁt in all the incoming materials in the designated
storage area. Oxxa, however, provides an option to gradually deliver up to 24 liters
of oil each day.

Given the situation, what inventory strategy should Rosetta’s adopt to man-
age this item? What quantity of vegetable oil should they order in one lot, and
when? Should they ask their Oxxa to deliver the complete order in one lot, or
should they ask them to deliver the order gradually? Answers to these
questions will be addressed in Chap. 3.
2.4.2
Taking Advantage of Supplier Discounts
Month over month, Rosetta’s uses large quantities of vegetable oil for production of
food products. Vegetable oil is one of the more expensive ingredients in the
production process. To improve proﬁtability, procurement personnel at Rosetta’s
are always looking at minimizing the costs of this item. If Rosetta’s procures
vegetable oil from the local supermarket on a need basis, it would cost them an
average of $20 per liter. Considering the fact that Rosetta’s have been a high-
demand loyal customer for several years, the local supplier – Oxxa – informs
Rosetta’s that if they place an order for 500 liters or more, Oxxa would supply
vegetable oil at $19.5 per liter.
Also, on certain occasions, Oxxa runs special campaigns to clear off their current
stock in anticipation of new, fresh stock of vegetable oil. For a ﬁxed period, they
offer a discount of 15% per liter to those buyers that can place an order for larger
than usual quantities, before end of the month.
What should Rosetta’s procurement strategy be? Should they continue pro-
curing based on their calculated EOQ, or should they take advantage of the
discount and order more? These are the questions that will be addressed in
Chap. 4.
2.4.3
Items with Time-Varying Demand
Corn ﬂour additive, a customized masala,6 is used by Rosetta’s to make corn-
ﬂavored tortillas. Rosetta’s buys this each month from their preferred vendor. The
demand for this item varies each month. It peaks during primavera and starts
dipping as summer approaches. It increases once again during the rainy season.
6A mixture of spices.

Inventory Control Systems: Design Factors

However, the demand for this item is known at least 6 months in advance, thanks to
Rosetta’s demand estimation system for this product that forecasts fairly accurately
the monthly demand. The demand (in kilograms) over the next 6 months (January
through June) is as shown below:

Considering the fact that demand varies each month, what quantity should
Rosetta’s order, and when?
In Chap. 5, we discuss solutions to manage a single item whose demand varies
with time. Popular heuristics such as Lot-for-Lot, Part-Period Balancing,
Silver-Meal, Least Unit Cost, and Wagner-Whitin will be discussed.
2.4.4
Items with Uncertain Demand
At Rosetta’s, demand for vegetable oil has been fairly steady and constant, and that
for corn ﬂour additive has been predictable. But the demand for eggs has been very
uncertain. There have been instances when less than 200 eggs have been consumed
in a week. There have also been instances when more than 900 eggs have been used
up in a week. On an average, the demand for eggs has been around 500 per week.
Because the demand for the item is not constant, the EOQ formula cannot be
applied. How, then, would managers at Rosetta’s manage inventory of items
whose demand is uncertain? This concern will be addressed as part of Chap. 6.
2.4.5
Management Under Constraints
Inventory managers at Rosetta’s manage a large number of items in stock such as
corn ﬂour, vegetable oil, cooking gas, yeast, and several others. Stocking decisions
of these items are dependent on each other. For example, the decision to stock a
certain amount of vegetable oil depends on the amount of corn ﬂour being stocked.
What this means for Rosetta’s is that stocking large quantities of vegetable oil and
small amount of corn ﬂour is not really going to help. Another problem being faced
by them is the fact that the management wants to restrict the amount of money they
lock in inventory. In these situations, what should be their replenishment policy?
2.4
Running Example: Managing Inventory at Rosettas Tortilleria
27

In Chap. 7, we introduce the concept of multi-item inventory management
and discuss simple analytical solutions to inventory problems that are subject
to constraints. Speciﬁcally, we discuss problems that are subject to budget,
space, and number of orders constraints.
Monitoring and controlling of inventory items is very expensive. In a
multiproduct inventory system, all items held in stock are not equally proﬁtable.
An item with a purchase price of $200 may be considered high-value, but may be
used sparingly. The purchase price of another item may be $0.50, which is consid-
ered relatively low-value. However, this item may be used in large quantities.
Table 2.5 shows a sample of 16 items used by Rosetta’s. Which of the items
would the inventory manager focus on more?
In a multi-item inventory management system, stocking decision of one item
impacts another item. In Chap. 8, we discuss simple analytical and graphical
methods of managing multiple items together.
2.4.6
Managing Perishable Items
Corn tortillas are sold to retail customers through their only sales outlet, managed
by Maria Fernanda. Tortillas are sold in packs of 10. Each pack of 10 costs $10, and
they sell it to customers at $25. Because they do not add any preservatives, the shelf
life of a pack of tortilla is 1 day (24 h). Maria accepts a predetermined number of
corn-ﬂavored tortilla packs each morning at 7:00 am when the sales outlet opens. At
11:00 pm when the outlet closes, she discards all the unsold packs. She also informs
the kitchen manager the number of packs she would need the next morning. One of
her key performance indicator (KPI) is to minimize the losses due to unsold
inventory, and for this she relies on historical data. Maria must know how many
packets she would need at the beginning of the day, each day. Weekly demand for
corn tortillas is as shown in Table 2.6.

Maria does not like wasting food. Nobody does. She has approached a food-
processing unit in Leo´n that reprocesses food items. The reprocessing unit has
agreed to buy unsold packets of tortilla from Rosetta’s at $5 per packet. Maria
would now have to analyze the new situation and decide on the number of packets
she would need each morning when the outlet opens for sale.
Solutions to problems involving items that have a ﬁnite life, with and
without salvage value, are discussed in Chap. 9. These are also referred to
as single-period inventory models.
2.4.7
Production Infrastructure
Rosetta’s uses large automated tortilla-making machines. Each machine includes a
dough loading section, a pressing section, a spiral heating (carousel) section, and a
packaging section. The spiral heating section is driven by a powerful three-phase,
230 V electric motor that is used 365 days a year for 16 h each day. In the event of a
motor failure, production losses incurred by Rosetta’s would be $100 per hour. The
failure rate ( p) of the motor is 2 per year, and the mean time to repair (T) is
3 months. Rosetta’s has four such identical tortilla-making machines, and currently
have one spare rotable motor in their stores.
How many spare motors must Rosetta’s maintain in their inventory? Is one
spare motor held in inventory sufﬁcient for Rosetta’s to minimize their
production losses? What would be the savings in downtime if they employ
one more spare motor? These are some of the questions that would be
addressed in Chap. 10.
2.4.8
Distribution to Retailers
To increase their market share, Rosetta’s has now decided to allow a sole franchisee
in Leo´n to sell the Rosetta’s brand of tortillas. Franchisee places an order for a
certain number of packs of tortillas. This costs them $4 per order. Rosetta’s supplies
each pack of tortilla to the franchisee at a price of $10. The franchisee can retail a
pack of tortilla at $22. Inventory carrying rate is 30% per annum, and the annual
demand for tortilla is 6000 packs. Rosetta’s “incurs” an order cost of $8 per order
when they procure the packets from their kitchen. Also, we assume the tortillas
have an indeﬁnite shelf life.
2.4

In Chap. 11, we address the inventory management problem in a simple
two-stage multi-echelon situation. We develop equations to determine order
quantities for each stage.
2.5
Summary
In this chapter, we discussed key design factors of inventory control system includ-
ing frequency of review, timing of order placement, and order size. These factors
need to be kept in mind while adopting an inventory control system for any given
business. We reviewed three popular inventory control systems in this chapter:
•
Continuous Review, Fixed Order Quantity (s, Q) System
•
Continuous Review, Order-Up-to-Level (s, S) System
•
Periodic Review, Order-Up-to-Level (T, S) System
We also discuss in detail three relevant inventory costs – carrying cost, ordering
cost, and shortage cost – as well as methods to estimate those.
Toward the end of this chapter, we presented a detailed case study – Rosetta’s
Tortilleria – that would be used as a running example across all chapters. This
would help get a common basis for learning inventory management concepts.

Introduction to Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
Model
Rosetta’s consumes 7200 liters of vegetable oil each year in the production
of food products, including tortillas. (This is roughly 20 liters each day,
assuming they work 360 days a year.) The demand for vegetable oil is fairly
stable and steady each month. They buy vegetable oil from Oxxa, their prime
supplier. On an average, it costs Rosetta’s $80 to place an order. Accountants
at Rosetta’s use an inventory carrying rate of 30% per year. Oxxa has the
ability to supply the entire ordered quantity in one lot. The storage area in
Rosetta’s is small. On some occasions, managers have not been able to ﬁt in
all the incoming materials in the designated storage area. Oxxa, however,
provides an option to gradually deliver up to 24 liters of oil each day.
Given the situation, what inventory strategy should Rosetta’s adopt to man-
age this item? What quantity of vegetable oil should they order in one lot, and
when? Should they ask their Oxxa to deliver the complete order in one lot, or
should they ask them to deliver the order gradually? Answers to these
questions will be addressed in this chapter.
The Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model is the most basic of all inventory
models that helps inventory manager answer the question “how much should I
order”?. This model is based on the philosophy of determining an order quantity
where the sum of the ordering costs and the carrying costs is minimal.

3.1.1
Assumptions
Following are some of the assumptions made in deriving an equation for an EOQ:
•
We consider a single item in the inventory system. The demand for this item is
known and is fairly constant.
•
The policy is to review the inventory system continuously. A ﬁxed-size replen-
ishment order is placed as soon as the inventory of the item reaches the reorder
level, that is, (s, Q) model is in operation.
•
The replenishment occurs instantaneously. All items ordered are received at the
same time, in full, and in good quality.
•
The ordering cost, holding cost, and the unit price remain constant. No discounts
are involved.
•
Because the replenishment occurs instantaneously, there are no shortages. Also,
there is no need for back-ordering.
Please note that some of the above assumptions will be relaxed later in this
chapter or in the subsequent chapters.
3.1.2
EOQ Derivation
Let us now derive an expression that will help us determine an economic order
quantity that answers the question of how much to order given that the assumptions
listed above are satisﬁed. We consider a planning horizon of 1 year. The total
annual inventory cost (TIC) is the sum of ordering costs, holding costs, and the
purchasing costs:
TIC ¼ Annual ordering costs þ Annual holding costs
þ Annual purchasing costs
ð3:1Þ
The relationship between these costs is shown in Fig. 3.1. Let us formulate
mathematical expressions for each of the terms (Anderson et al. 2016; Nahmias
2005). Let Q be the economic order size. If the annual demand for the item is
D units, then the number of orders to be placed, N, in a year is
¼ D
Q
ð3:2Þ
If the ordering cost is Co per order, the annual ordering cost is
¼ D
Q Co
ð3:3Þ

Deterministic Inventory Models

If we place an order for Q units and the order is ﬁlled instantaneously, then the
beginning inventory in the cycle is Q units. We place the next order only when the
inventory is completely exhausted. This is shown in Fig. 3.2. Since the maximum
inventory is Q units and the minimum inventory is 0, the average inventory in that
cycle is
¼ Q þ 0

where Q is the optimal order quantity, also referred to in this book as EOQ. Note the
following:

The term iC can also be represented by Ch. In other words, Ch ¼ iC.
•
The term for purchase cost is not part of the ﬁnal equation, since that term is
independent of Q.
Once we obtain Q, we may need to also look at the timing of placement of
successive orders. This is called the cycle time, represented by τ, and can be
determined by
τ ¼ Q

EOQ Dimensions
Let us now examine the physical dimensions involved in the EOQ equation
(Eq. 3.8):

•
The demand, D, is expressed in terms of number of units per year.
•
The ordering cost, Co, is expressed in terms of dollars
•
The interest rate, i, is given in % per year.
•
The unit price (cost), C, of the item is expressed in dollars per unit.
Using the above, we get

Simplifying the above, we see that the physical dimension for Q is (number of)
units (Monks 1987). It is important that the time units for D and Ch must be the
same. For example, if the demand is given in units per year, then the holding cost
must also be in dollars per unit per year.
3.1.4

We can use another method to determine the TIC once we have the EOQ. If we
ignore the annual purchasing cost in Eq. 3.7, we have
TIC ¼ D

Either of Eq. 3.7, Eq. 3.10, or Eq. 3.10a may be used to determine TIC. It should
be noted that Eqs. 3.10 and 3.10a do not include the cost of purchase.
Let us now apply the EOQ concept to the running example presented at the
beginning of this chapter. Rosetta’s uses a large quantity of vegetable oil for
production of food products. The demand for this item is fairly steady. The
objective is to determine the economic order quantity. We have the following
information with us:
3.1
Introduction to Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Model
39

•
Order cost Co is $80 per order.
•
The unit price (C) of vegetable oil is $20 per liter. The inventory holding rate (i)
is 30% per year.
•
The demand is fairly constant at 7200 liters per year.
The ﬁrst step is to verify that the time units for demand and holding cost are the
same. In this case, it is the same (both are expressed in years). Therefore, we can
progress to the next step. Substituting the above values in Eq. 3.8, we get

Thus, the EOQ is 438.17 liters. It should be noted that the demand for the item is
continuous. This implies that the EOQ may be a non-integer, and this is perfectly
acceptable. The TIC can be calculated using Eq. 3.10. Substituting the values in
Eq. 3.7, we get

Leon Cardiology Centre in Mexico buys 25,000 stents each year from its suppliers
in Germany. Each stent costs $1500, and carrying cost is 26% of the value of the
average inventory of stents per year. If the ordering cost is $270 per order,
determine the economic order quantity for stents. Also, determine the number of
orders and the TICs.

SleepWell Mattresses manufactures high-quality spring-based cotton mattresses. A
set of eight identical stainless steel springs are used to produce a mattress. The
inventory holding cost for springs is $2.15 per spring per year. SleepWell has

Solved Problem 3.4
Sun Corporation is a retailer of school notebooks. They buy notebooks from a
wholesaler at $0.50 and sell it to consumers at $0.85 per notebook. The demand for
notebooks is estimated at 9000 per quarter. If the ordering cost is $4 per order and
carrying cost is based on an annual interest rate of 15%, compute the economic
order size.
Solution
In this problem, the time unit for D is quarter, while the time unit for carrying cost
(rate) is year. We therefore need to convert the demand from quarter to year. This
can be done by multiplying the quarterly demand by 4. Thus, the demand
D ¼ 9000  4 ¼ 36,000.
Further,

3.2
When to Order: Incorporating Lead Time
In the previous section, we discussed a solution to the question of “how much to
order?“. This section describes the solution for “when to place an order?“. In the
basic EOQ model, we assumed the order is ﬁlled instantaneously. In other words,
the model assumed the procurement lead time1 is zero. This is not true always. In
this section, we relax the lead time assumption to make the model more realistic.
At the time of placing an order, the level of inventory on hand should be such
that it can satisfy the demand during the lead time. Clearly, this level of inventory is
a function of the consumption during lead time. This level, also referred to as
reorder level,2 s, can be mathematically expressed as
s ¼ L  d
ð3:11Þ
where L is the lead time, in days, and d is the daily demand. In Rosetta’s running
example case, if the procurement lead time for vegetable oil is 7 days, the reorder
level is
s ¼ 7  7200
360 ¼ 140 liters
Here, we assume Rosetta’s is working 360 days a year. The inventory control
policy for Rosetta’s based on a continuous review, ﬁxed order quality (s, Q) system
can be stated as follows (see also Fig. 3.3):
When the on-hand inventory level of vegetable oil goes down to 140 liters we place an
order for 438 liters.
Order Quantity, Q = 438 liters

Solved Problem 3.7
A ﬁrm sells an item that has an annual demand of 1000 units. If the procurement
lead time is a constant 5 days, ﬁnd the reorder level. Assume 365 workdays a year.
Solution
Since the annual demand is 1000 units, and the ﬁrm works 365 days a year, we can
compute the daily demand, which is
¼ 1000
365 ¼ 2:74 units per day
Substituting the values in Eq. 3.11, we get
s ¼ 5  2:74 ¼ 13:7 units
The reorder level is 13.7 (14 units if we round off to the next highest integer)
units. When the on-hand inventory level of the item goes down to 14 units, we place
a new replenishment order.
A Note on (s, S) Inventory Model
Recall from our discussions in Chap. 2 that (s, S) is one where the inventory
level of an item is reviewed continuously. An order is placed when the
inventory level drops to s. The size of the order is such that it would take
the inventory level back up to level S. A key difference between (s, Q) and
(s, S) is that the order size in the latter model is variable. However, consider
the following situation: if we assume that all demands for the item are of unit
size, then an order is placed exactly when the inventory level falls to s. In this
case, the size of all the orders would be the same, given by Q ¼ S  s. It
should be noted that this formula may be used only when all transactions
(demand) are of unit size (Silver et al. 1998).
3.3
EOQ Model with Gradual Replenishments
Another assumption made in the derivation of the classic EOQ was that the ordered
quantity arrives in full. For example, Rosetta’s places an order for 438 liters of
vegetable oil, and all of it arrives in one instance. This may not be true in some
cases as the supplier may deliver parts of the order at different times. It may also be
that Rosetta’s (the purchaser) does not want to receive the whole order in one
instance due to space constraints they may have in their warehouse. In this section,
we will learn about the case where the supplier delivers the ordered material at
some uniform rate rather than all in one lot. Figure 3.4 illustrates the concept of
gradual supply (Gaither 1987).

We can now use Eq. 3.13 to solve Rosetta’s order quantity problem (see Box at
the beginning of this chapter) if the supplies are delivered gradually at some
uniform rate and not all in one lot. Referring to the running example, we know
that Oxxa, the supplier, delivers vegetable oil at the rate of 24 liters a day. We also
know that the annual demand for vegetable oil is 7200 liters, or daily consumption
of vegetable oil is 20 liters. We now have the following information with us that we
could use to solve this problem:
•
Order cost Co is $80 per order.
•
The purchase price (cost) of vegetable oil (C)is $20 per liter. The inventory
holding rate (i) is 30% per year.
•
The demand is fairly constant at 7200 liters per year (or demand is 20 liters per
day).
•
The supplier supplies vegetable oil at the rate of 24 liters per day.
Substituting the above in Eq. 3.13, we get

carrying cost is $0.1 per item per day and the ordering cost is $250 per order,
compute the EOQ for this item.
Solution
We have the following data with us:
•
Demand: 100 per day
•
Supply rate: 300 per day
•
Order cost: $250 per order
•
Carrying cost: $0.1 per item per day
Note that all the data supplied is in days. We can use the data as is. Substituting
these values in Eq.3.13, we get

Solved Problem 3.9
You have developed the following estimates for procuring an item for your
manufacturing operations:
•
Item demand: 3600 units yearly (10 units per day)
•
Purchase price: $25 per item
•
Ordering cost: $35 per order
•
Inventory holding rate: 25% annually
The following two options are available to you:
•
Option 1: The supplier can supply all items at once.
•
Option 2: The supplier can supply 15 items per day.
Compare the following for each of the options – total ordering cost, total holding
cost, cycle time, number of orders, and the TICs.
Based on the information you have, which of the above options would you
prefer?
Solution
We solve this problem by computing the EOQ as well as the TIC for each of the
options. The option that has minimal TICs is the one that we need to use. Calcu-
lations are as shown in Table 3.2.
Since the TIC for Option 2 is cheaper, we would prefer items to be gradually
supplied at the rate of 15 items per day.

EOQ Model with Planned Shortages
In some cases, businesses allow shortages when the cost of such shortage is
manageable (Muckstadt and Sapra 2010). In cases where shortages are allowed,
another cost factor becomes important – shortage cost, represented in this section
by Cs. When demand arises and is not met, it remains back-ordered (or backlogged)
till new stock arrives. A portion of the new stock, when received, is used up to meet
the back-ordered demand while the rest builds up the inventory. This means that
during a period T1, inventory exists on hand, and during another period T2 there is a
back-order. If B is the planned back-order and S is the maximum inventory in a
cycle, then
S ¼ Q  B
ð3:14Þ
The average inventory held is, therefore,
¼ S

and the annual inventory carrying cost is
¼ S

ð3:15Þ
Since B is the planned back-order, the average shortage in the system is
¼ B

Solved Problem 3.11
MedPlus Pharmacy sells 20 strips of paracetamol tablets each day (annual demand
is 7300 strips). MedPlus buys its supplies from its preferred wholesaler at $1.85 per
strip and sells it over the counter to customers at $2.50 per strip. MedPlus incurs a
cost of $5 every time it places an order. An annual interest rate of 25% is used to
determine carrying costs. MedPlus would like to place a standing order with the
wholesaler to regularly supply strips of paracetamol tablets. What should be the size
of a standing order it should place if:
•
The wholesaler supplies all the tablet strips instantaneously in one lot with no
back-ordering allowed?
•
The wholesaler supplies tablet strips gradually at the rate of 25 strips a day?
•
Back-ordering is allowed? (Use a shortage cost of $2 per strip per year.)

Periodic Review Model: Deterministic Demand
All models discussed previously in this chapter are continuous review-based
models. In this section, we will discuss a periodic review-based (T, S) inventory
model. The decision variables in a periodic review model is the optimal time
between inventory review periods (T), and the maximum inventory level (S).
(Hillier and Lieberman 2001; Jacobs and Chase 2011). Note that all assumptions
we made for the basic EOQ model holds good for this model as well, including the
assumption that the demand during lead time is known with certainty.

Solved Problem 3.12
An organization has a single item whose annual demand is 15,000 units, unit cost is
$2.5, ordering cost is $300, and inventory holding rate is 25%. Determine
(a) The frequency between reviews if the organization follows a periodic review
system.
(b) The order size if the management does not want the inventory level to exceed
5000 units at any time and there are 1500 units currently in stock.
(c) The replenishment policy.
Solution
(a) We have the following information:
• Annual demand, D, is 15,000 units
• Ordering cost, Co, is $300 per order
• Inventory holding rate, i, is 15% per year, or 0.15
• Unit cost, C, is $2.5

Summary
In this chapter, we discussed mathematical models to manage inventory of a single
item whose demand is known and is constant. We derived an equation for comput-
ing EOQ which minimizes the TICs. We learnt that the EOQ model makes several
assumptions, and one cannot, therefore, take this model off the shelf and implement
it in one’s organization. Despite the fact that the model makes several assumptions,
the EOQ model is quite popular, possibly because of its robustness and the fact that
some of the assumptions made may actually be relaxed.

Deterministic Inventory Models

In this chapter, we brieﬂy discussed extensions of the EOQ model to other
situations where supply is not instantaneous (i.e., supply is gradual), and another
where planned backlogging (shortages) is allowed. We also discussed computation
of the reorder level when lead time is assumed to be constant and known.
As we learned from Chap. 2, there are two types of inventory models (based on
timing of review) – continuous review and periodic review. The EOQ model and its
extensions come under the continuous review category. Besides discussing the
continuous review models, we also discussed a simple periodic review model to
determine the optimal time between review intervals.

Case Study: Fixed Order Quantity System
George Thomas owns a proprietary sports goods manufacturing company – George
Sports (GS) – based in Meerut, India. One of the most popular, fast-moving
products sold by GS is the cricket bat. GS manufactures different types of cricket
bats using local timber. However, one of their products – GSEW7 – is a cricket bat
made out of English willow, a type of wood they import from a timber merchant in
England.
George has been concerned about the increase in manufacturing costs, and like
any other proprietor, he wants to minimize the costs to the extent possible. He calls
for Munshi, his trusted accountant for 30 years.
“I have an important assignment for you Munshi,” says George.
“Sure, sir. How can I help?” asks Munshi.
“I am very concerned about the excessive inventory of the GSEW7 logs that I see in the
warehouse. I know it is used for one of our fast-moving products but having it in excess
does increase the inventory costs and reduces proﬁtability of our company.”
“How frequently are we ordering the logs from England?” asks George.
“We don’t really have a scientiﬁc policy, Sir. I make a visual check of the inventory of
the logs and if I feel the stock is less then I place an order,” replies Munshi.
“Oh! I thought with a computer in place to manage the stock we could continuously
monitor the level of our inventory,” exclaims George. “And how many logs do we order
every time we place an order?” asks George.
“The order size is not ﬁxed sir. It varies between 150 and 300 logs,” replies Munshi.
“Ok. I think this is where the problem is Munshi. We need to come up with an inventory
management policy. Please look at your computer records and come back to me with
historical inventory data for GSEW7. You have 3 days to get me the data,” asserts George.
Back at his ofﬁce, Munshi starts working on his new assignment of analyzing the
demand and cost data for GSEW7. From his computer records, he observes the
following:
•
Demand for GSEW7 is fairly constant at 200 cricket bats a month.
•
Because the wood is imported from England, the ordering cost is high at $800
per order.
•
GS uses an inventory carrying and storage rate of 30% per year for accounting
purposes.
3.7
Case Study: Fixed Order Quantity System

•
The unit cost of each piece of GSEW7 works out to $350.
•
The lead time is constant at 30 days.
Case Study Questions
(a) Is the EOQ formula really applicable in this scenario? If so, why? If not, why
not?
(b) Considering the data gathered by Munshi, compute the optimal order quantity
of English willow logs, assuming one cricket bat of type GSEW7 is made out of
one log of English willow.
(c) If GS works 20 days a month, compute the reorder level for English
willow logs.
(d) Compute the annual TICs (not including the purchase costs).
(e) Determine the cycle time and the number of orders per year.
(f) The merchant in England can supply English willow logs at a uniform rate of
300 logs each month. If GS works 20 days a month, compute the order quantity
for English willow logs as well as the TICs.
(g) Because GS is the sole supplier of English willow bats in the local market,
people wanting to buy these specialized bats back-order their requirements in
case a bat is out of stock. If the shortage cost is $50, determine the back-ordered
quantity and the maximum inventory level.
Answers
(b) Economic order quantity: 191 logs.
(c) Reorder level is 300 logs.
(d) TIC is $20,080.
(e) Cycle time is 19 days, and number of orders per year is 12.5.

Problem 3.2
A warehouse stores just one type of item. The annual demand for this item is 1200.
The warehouse manager uses a ﬁxed order size of 100 units, equivalent to 1 month’s
usage, each time she places an order. The inventory carrying rate is 25% per annum,
and the cost of the item is $300. If the ordering cost per order is $35, compute the
cost savings (or losses) if the warehouse manager uses the EOQ concept to manage
the inventory of this item. Assume no back-ordering.

Dynamic Inventory Control Models
4.1
Single Price-Break Model
Month over month Rosetta’s uses large quantities of vegetable oil for pro-
duction of food products. Vegetable oil is one of the more expensive ingre-
dients in the production process. To improve proﬁtability, procurement
personnel at Rosetta’s are always looking at minimizing the costs of this
item. If Rosetta’s procures vegetable oil from the local supermarket on a need
basis, it would cost them an average of $20 per liter. Considering the fact that
Rosetta’s has been a high-demand loyal customer for several years, the local
supplier – Oxxa – informs Rosetta’s that if they place an order for 500 liters or
more, Oxxa would supply vegetable oil at $19.5 per liter.
Also, on certain occasions Oxxa runs special campaigns to clear off their
current stock in anticipation of new, fresh stock of vegetable oil. For a ﬁxed
period, they offer a discount of 15% per liter to those buyers that can place an
order for larger than usual quantities, before the end of the month.
What should Rosetta’s procurement strategy be? Should they continue pro-
curing based on their calculated EOQ, or should they take advantage of the
discount and order more? These are the questions that will be addressed in
this chapter.
Consider the ﬁrst part of the running example presented in the box above. The
question is should Rosetta’s procure 500 liters of vegetable oil because of the $0.5
per liter discount being, or should they order based on their EOQ? This is a single
(or one) price-break problem (Vohra 2007). This decision can be made by com-
paring the TIC for the two scenarios – one without discount at $20 per liter and
order size of EOQ, and another at a discounted rate of $19.5 per liter but with an
enhanced order size of at least 500 liters.

We start by computing the EOQ, using the market price of $20 per liter. We
know the annual demand for vegetable oil is 7200 liters, the ordering cost is $80 per
order, and the inventory holding rate is 30% per year. Using these values, we can
determine the EOQ,1 which is
EOQ ¼

The next step is to compute the TIC using a discounted rate of $19.5 per liter.
Since this price is available only if the minimum quantity on order is 500 liters, we
use this instead of the EOQ value we computed earlier. The TIC in this case is as
follows:
TIC ¼
7200
500  80

Þ
TIC ¼ 1152 þ 1463 þ 140400 ¼ $143; 015
Since the TIC for the discounted rate is lower than that of the regular market
price, we conclude it is beneﬁcial for Rosetta’s to procure 500 liters of vegetable oil.
Figure 4.1 illustrates the cost curves for the two scenarios. In this case, a discount of
$0.5 per liter on an order size of 500 liters turned out to be beneﬁcial to Rosetta’s.
However, this may not always be true as the savings due to purchase price discount
may not match the additional carrying costs that may be incurred, in which case it is
prudent to maintain an order size that equals EOQ.
Solved Problem 4.1
A manufacturer purchases 1200 units of an item from a supplier every year. The
ordering cost is $250 per order, inventory rate is 15% per year, and the cost of the
item is $100. Based on this information compute the following:
(a) Compute the economic order quantity assuming no shortages are allowed and
no discount is being offered by the supplier.
1From Eq. 3.8 in Chap. 3.
2We include the purchase price in calculation of the TIC for this class of problems because
discounts impact the total purchase costs.

(b) The supplier offers a discount of 2% if the manufacturer places an order of not
less than 750 units each time they order. Should the manufacturer accept the
discounted price?
(c) What would be the minimum acceptable discounted price if the manufacturer
uses an order size of 750 units?
Solution

can be determined using Eq. 3.8. Substituting the values, we get

All-Units Discount: Instantaneous Supply Model
Consider a new business deal between Rosetta’s and Oxxa shown below:
Business Deal – Oxxa and Rosetta’s
The market price of vegetable oil is $20 per liter. If Rosetta’s procures
450 liters (or more) of vegetable oil each time they place an order, Oxxa
will offer them a discount of 10% over the prevailing market rate. The
discount rate would increase to 20% if Rosetta’s procures 500 liters or
more per order. Further, Oxxa will supply the ordered quantities immediately.
Table 4.1 shows the discount and effective price offered by Oxxa for different
ranges of quantities of vegetable oil. This is referred to as multiple price-break
(discount) schedule. It should be noted that the assumptions we used in derivation
of the Basic EOQ model in Chap. 3 will continue to apply in this scenario as well.
Let us now use the information provided in Table 4.1 and determine the optimal
and feasible order quantity under discount. This can be achieved in the following
four steps:
Step 1: Compute Order Size for All Values of Purchase Price
The ﬁrst step is to compute the EOQ for each of the price-break values of $20 , $18,
and $16. We will use the following data that have been used in Chap. 3:
•
Annual demand for vegetable oil is 7200 liters.
•
Ordering cost Co is $80 per order.
•
Unit cost C is $20 per liter (market price), $18 per liter if the order size is more
than 450 liters, $16 per liter if the order size is more than 500 liters.
•
Inventory holding rate i is 30%.
Using the above data, we can compute the EOQ values for each of the price-
break points, which are as follows:
EOQ20 ¼

2  7200  80
0:3  16
r
¼ 490 liters
Step 2: Check Feasibility of Order Quantities
Next, we analyze the order quantities we computed. We see that EOQ16 is infeasible
since it does not fall in the range of 500+ liters. In other words, a discounted rate of
$16 is offered only if the order size is more than 500 liters; however, the EOQ we
computed for purchase price of $16 is less than 500 liters, and hence it is considered
infeasible. We, therefore, adjust the minimum value of EOQ16 to 500 liters (from
490 liters). Table 4.2 summarizes the feasibility of the order quantities for each
purchase price as well as the adjusted order quantity (adjusted EOQ).
The EOQs for purchase price of $20 and $18 are in the feasible range, and no
adjustment is required.
Step 3: Determine TIC
We next compute TIC for EOQ20 , EOQ18, and EOQ16 using the following
equation4:
TIC ¼ D

Notice that the TIC16 is less than both TIC20 and TIC18. The order quantity
corresponding to TIC16 is 500 liters. Thus, we conclude that it is best to order
500 liters of vegetable oil each time we place an order. Figure 4.2 illustrates the
price curves and optimal order quantity for this multiple price-break model.

•
If the EOQ value computed falls in the feasible range, compute the TIC. If the
EOQ does not fall in the feasible range, adjust the EOQ such that it falls in the
feasible range. Compute the TIC using this adjusted EOQ value.
•
Compare the TIC values for all such feasible EOQ values. The EOQ value which
corresponds to the minimum TIC is the optimal quality under all-unit discount.
The following section illustrates the application of the all-units discount theory.
Solved Problem 4.2
The annual consumption of sugar used in a bakery is 10,400 kg, the carrying cost is
20% of the average inventory valuation, and the ordering cost is $200 per order. If
the sugar supplier offers the bakery quantity discounts as shown in Table 4.4, use the
concept of optimal order quantity to determine the EOQ strategy that best suits
the needs of the bakery.
Solution:
The solution for an inventory problem with quantity discounts can be found in four
steps:
Step 1: Compute Order Size for All Values of Purchase Price
Using the EOQ formula, we ﬁrst determine the order quantities for each purchase
price option. The calculations are shown in Table 4.5.
Step 2: Check Feasibility of Order Quantities
In this step, we validate the calculated EOQs against the quantity range. If the
calculated EOQ does not fall in the range of quantity discount, we adjust the EOQ to
the minimum in the quantity range. Table 4.6 summarizes the feasibility of the
order quantities for each purchase price, as well as the adjusted order quantity.

Step 3: Determine TIC Using Adjusted EOQ
TIC can be determined by using Eq. 4.1. The TIC for the three strategies are as
shown in Table 4.7.
Step 4: Determine Best Strategy
Since the minimum TIC corresponds to the EOQ strategy of $9.9, we conclude that
the best strategy is to order 1500 kg of sugar each time an order is placed, at a
purchase price of $9.9 per kg.
Solved Problem 4.3
You own a stationery outlet in a college where you sell one type of student
notebooks. You purchase your stock of student notebooks from one of the local
wholesalers and sell it to students in the college for $0.85 per notebook. One
wholesaler – AJW – sells you notebooks at $0.65, irrespective of the quantity of
notebooks you purchase from them. Another wholesaler – BJW – sells notebooks to
you at 0.60 provided you place an order for at least 3500 notebooks. Yet another
source – CJW – sells the same notebooks at 0.55, but the minimum lot size must be
4500 or above. If the annual demand for student notebooks is 20,000 and the
ordering cost per order is $25, which wholesaler would you procure your stock
from? Assume an annual rate of interest of 15% for calculating your carrying costs.
Solution:
Step 1: Compute Order Size for All Options
Using the EOQ formula, we can determine the order quantities for each purchase
price option (in this case, the procurement source). Calculations are shown in
Table 4.8.
Step 2: Check Feasibility
Table 4.9 shows the feasibility check for each of the strategies. Since the EOQs
computed for BJW and CJW are not within the discount range, we adjust those
EOQs to the minimum quantity where discounts would be available.

Step 3: Determine TIC Using Adjusted EOQ
TIC can be determined by using Eq. 4.1. The TIC for the three strategies are as
shown in Table 4.10.
Step 4: Determine Best Strategy
From Table 4.10, we notice that the minimum TIC corresponds to CJW. The best
strategy is, therefore, to order 4500 notebooks each time an order is placed, at a
purchase price of $0.55 per notebook.

All-Units Discount: Gradual Supply Model
In the previous section, we assumed a scenario that orders would be ﬁlled instan-
taneously, in one lot. Let us now consider a different scenario – that of gradual
supply. The procedure to determine the order size is similar to that in the all-units
discount (instantaneous supply) case, with the only difference being in the formulae
we use to compute the order size and the total inventory costs (Gaither 1987). The
formulae used to compute the EOQ and TIC for the gradual supply case are as
follows5:

Step 2: Check Feasibility
The next step is to check the feasibility of the computed EOQs. Table 4.12
summarizes the feasibility check. As can be seen from the table, the EOQ strategy
for price of $9.8 is infeasible. We therefore adjust the EOQ upward to 5000 kg. The
EOQ strategy for $10 is not within the feasible range, and there is no way we can
adjust the EOQ for that price strategy.

Step 3: Determine TIC Using Adjusted EOQ
TIC can be determined by using Eq. 4.3. The TICs for the two feasible strategies are
as shown in Table 4.13.
Step 4: Determine Best Strategy
As can be seen from Table 4.13, the minimum TIC corresponds to an EOQ strategy
with a price of $9.8 per kg. The best strategy is, therefore, to order 5000 kg each
time an order is placed.

Incremental Discount Model
In the previous section, we learnt about application of theory to situations where
discount is offered on all units. Realistically, wholesalers may not offer a
discounted price on all units purchased. They may offer no discount on the ﬁrst
few units purchased, a small discount on the next few units purchased, and a larger
discount if the purchase exceeds a preset threshold of units purchased. This discount
model is called incremental discount (Srinivasan 2010). Let us now study the
solution procedure for this model. Consider a scenario where Oxxa offers discount
to Rosetta’s as follows:
Business Deal – Oxxa and Rosetta’s
Each liter of vegetable oil will cost Rosetta’s $20 per liter for quantities up to
450 liters. For an order size of 450 liters and up to 500 liters, Oxxa will offer
Rosetta’s a discount of 10% over the prevailing market rate. The discount rate
would increase to 20% if Rosetta’s procures 500 liters or more per order.
In the all-units discount case, Rosetta’s would have been offered a discount of
20% on the entire order, if the order size exceeds 500 liters. In the incremental
discounts scenario, Rosetta’s will have to pay the market price for the ﬁrst
450 liters. A discount of 10% will be offered on the 450th liter onward up to
500 liters. A discount of 20% would be offered from the 500th liter onward. This is
the key difference between all-units discount and incremental discount model. In
this case, the purchase price reduces incrementally as additional quantity is
procured.

Dynamic Inventory Control Models

Mathematically,
•
Let m be the number of price bands and q1 , q2 , q3 , . . . , qm be the price break
quantities where q1 ¼ 0;
•
Let us also assume that the unit purchasing cost is Cj;
•
Let Q represent the optimal quantity that we plan to procure, and let us further
assume that this quantity falls in the jth price band, where j 2 m.
Under these assumptions, the purchasing cost C(Q) for a quantity Q can be
given by
C Q

have the following information with us:
•
Annual demand is 7200 liters
•
Ordering cost Co is $80 per order
•
Inventory holding rate i is 30%
In addition, we also know that Oxxa offers an incremental discount, as shown in

Step 2: Check Feasibility of Order Quantities
The next step is to check if the estimated quantities Q are all in the feasible range.
Table 4.15 summarizes the feasibility check for each option.
In this case, we notice that Q18 must be in the range of 450–500 liters to obtain a
discount of 10%. However, the estimated Q18 value is outside that range. Therefore,
we consider Q18 to be infeasible. Other options are feasible.
Step 3: Compute TICs
The next step is to compute the TICs using Eq. 4.4. Using the values for Q20 and Q16
obtained earlier, we can compute the TIC as follows:

Step 4: Determine the Best Strategy
The ﬁnal step is to compare the TIC values. We see that the TIC16is less than TIC20.
Therefore, it is best to order 2437 liters of vegetable oil each time we place an order.

Summary of Incremental Discount Solutions Procedure
Following is a summary of the incremental discount solution procedure:
•
For each price band, formulate the cost function C Q
ð Þ
Q .
•
Compute EOQ for each price option (case). Compute the TIC for the EOQs that
are feasible.
•
Compare the TIC values for all such feasible EOQs. The EOQ which corre-
sponds to the minimum TIC is the optimal quality.

All-Units Discount and Incremental Discount: A
Comparison
Let us compare the solutions presented by using the all-units discount and the
incremental discount strategies. Table 4.16 shows the EOQ and the TIC values
obtained for the feasible solution using both the methods. We see that while the
minimum cost obtained using all-units discount methods occurs at the price-break
point (500 units), whereas the minima for the incremental discount does not occur at
the price-break quantity (2437 units).
Following is another solved problem that illustrates the application of the
incremental discount model.
Solved Problem 4.5
A manufacturer of mircoturbines sources plastic impellers from its trusted supplier.
Every time the manufacturer places an order for procuring impellers, it incurs a cost
of $20. The carrying cost rate is 20%. The unit purchase price is based on the size of
the order as shown in Table 4.17. If the manufacturer has an annual demand for
1000 turbines, compute the optimal order quantity if the supplier uses an incre-
mental discount schedule.
If Q is the order quantity, mathematically, the above can be written as

The ﬁnal step is to determine the best strategy by comparing the TIC values.
Table 4.19 summarizes the TIC values for all the EOQ strategies. We notice that
the minimum TIC corresponds to a price strategy of $2.9 per unit. The optimal order
quantity is therefore 415 units.

One-Off, Fixed-Period Discount (Special Discount)
In certain situations, suppliers may offer a special, one-off discount. This is usually
done by suppliers to sell off existing stock of goods before the arrival of fresh stock
(Chopra and Meindl 2010).
Consider a scenario where Oxxa has a large amount of vegetable oil on their
stock and are expecting a fresh stock next month. They would like to clear off the
existing stock of vegetable oil before the arrival of fresh stock So, they run a
campaign to offer a one-time, ﬁxed period discount of 15% per liter to those buyers,
usually retailers, that can place an order for larger than usual quantities, before the
end of the month. Retailers would normally order vegetable oil based on their
computation of EOQ which is given by

Dynamic Inventory Control Models

However, when a wholesaler offers discounts, retailers may order more than
EOQ to reduce their future cost of sales. The optimal order quantity at discounted
price, Qd, is given by
Qd ¼

C  d
ð
Þi þ
CQ
C  d
ð
Þ
ð4:5Þ
where d is the discount value. This model is valid under the following assumptions:
•
The discount is one-time, for a ﬁxed period.
•
This discount may not be offered in future.
•
The customer demand (from retailer’s point of view) remains constant.
•
The item is not perishable.
•
The period over which the demand is analyzed is an integer of the original
optimal order quantity, Q
Let us now use this concept to solve Rosetta’s order quantity problem under
one-time discount. We will use the same data that we have used earlier (reproduced
below):
•
Annual demand is 7200 liters
•
Ordering cost Co is $80 per order
•
Inventory holding rate i is 30%
Original (before discount) purchase price is $20 per liter. Using the above data,
we ﬁrst determine the optimal order quantity, Q, which is
EOQ ¼

2  7200  80

¼ 438 liters
Next, we determine the optimal order quantity under one-time discount. A 15%
discount on $20 purchase price works out to $3 per liter. Using the data available
and substituting in Eq. 4.5, we get
Qd ¼
3  7200
20  3
ð
Þ  0:3 þ 20  438

Þ ¼ 4236 þ 515 ¼ 4751 liters
Observe that a 15% discount in price increases the optimal order quantity by
approximately 11 times (or 984%) (Table 4.20).
Since the one-off discount increases the replenishment order size, the inventory
is expected to stay on shelf for a longer period of time. This concept needs to be
applied with care to items that have limited life or those that become obsolete faster.

Binifont is a retail chain that sells PuraHoney, a popular brand of honey
manufactured by PH Foods. The annual demand for PuraHoney experienced by
Binifont in the local market is 1200 jars. PH Foods charges $5 per jar, and Binifont
uses an inventory holding rate of 25% per annum.
PH Foods has just announced a one-time promotional discount of $1 on all jars
of honey procured by retailers over the next 15 days. Compute the optimal order
quantity that Binifont needs to procure during the promotional period if they incur
an ordering cost of $30 per order.

Summary
When a seller offers a discount, the buyer must decide on the size of the purchase
order that would minimize the TICs. The buyer will have to balance the reduced
purchase cost with the increase in carrying cost. In this chapter, we discussed
continuous review (EOQ) price-break models. Besides the single price model, we
discussed the following three types of multiple price-break models in this chapter:
•
All-units discount model, where the supplier offers a uniform discount on all the
units purchased. Instantaneous and gradual supply models were both discussed.
•
Incremental discount model, where additional units purchased are offered a
higher discount.

Special discount model, also known as one-off discount or promotional discount
model.
A key takeaway from this chapter is that the minimum cost obtained using
all-units discount method occurs at the price-break point, whereas the minima for
the incremental discount does not occur at the price-break quantity. Another
takeaway (one-off discount model) is that a small discount in the price increases
the size of the optimal order quantity several times. Because of this, one needs to
apply caution before the one-off discount model can be applied to items that have
limited shelf life.

Case Study: All-Units Discount
Yano is an electronic toy manufacturing company, based in Melbourne, Victoria.
Yano manufactures a variety of electronic toys that “speak” to their patrons –
children. Over the last 15 years, people at Yano have mastered the art of creating
and packaging toys.
A lot of electronics and circuitry goes into the making of a “speaking electronic”
toy. One key component of any electronic toy built by Yano is a circuit board. In the
past, Yano have sourced their circuit boards from SK Electronics, also based in
Melbourne. Yano incurs a cost of $300 each time they place an order. SK Elec-
tronics have been very reliable and have supplied the required number of circuit
boards to Yano. Circuit boards supplied are stored in Yano’s stock control room.
The inventory manager at Yano uses an annual inventory carrying rate of 35%.
Felix is a Product Manager at Yano. He has been with Yano for the last 15 years
and is one of the architects of Yano. One day, Felix receives a meeting request from
Tim, the Chief Design Engineer at SK Electronics.
Hi Felix
Hope you are doing good. Cindy is our new Head of Sales at SK Electronics.
You being our key customer, I wanted Cindy to meet up with you. Are you
OK to have a 30 min meeting at 3:00 pm with us on Wednesday, 15th April?
We will come over to your ofﬁce.
Once you conﬁrm I will schedule it in your calendar.
Regard
Tom
On Wednesday, at 3:00 pm, Tom and Robert arrive at Felix’s ofﬁce.
“Hi Felix, good to meet you again” greets Tom. Pointing toward his colleague, Tom
continues” This is Cindy. She is the new Head of Sales at SK Electronics.”
“Good to meet you Cindy, and congratulations. So, how can I help you guys today?”
asks Felix.
“Our CEO kick-started a customer relationship program earlier this year, to develop a
deeper understanding of our customer requirements. Cindy and I are here today to ﬁnd out
more about your electronics & circuitry requirements for your current and future line of
products.”
“We would also appreciate any feedback you may have on our components that have
been part of your products for the last 15 years.”
“Sure, Tom, and Cindy. I can speak for Yano. Let me start by saying we are pleased with
the quality and reliability of the electronic boards we buy from you guys. There are virtually
no customer complaints, and it seems our partnership has been mutually beneﬁcial to both
our companies. We currently source 2500 circuit boards from you each year, and I do not
see that number changing for the next 2 years,” says Felix.
“The next year we are coming up with a new line of product, but from a requirements
point of view, we will continue to use the same circuit board in the new line. There are no
anticipated changes to the design,” says Felix.

“My procurement manager tells me that the rates of electronics goods are falling the
world over, and despite being a business partner for 15 years you guys have never lowered
your rates while we continue to procure components from SK Electronics,” Felix adds.
“I can take that up with our CEO and see what best we can work for Yano. I will send
you an email in any case.,” says Cindy.
The next morning Felix has this email from Cindy in his inbox:
Hi Felix,
Thanks for your hospitality. We had an excellent meeting yesterday and we
are glad that SK Electronics have been meeting your requirements. We will
strive to continue meeting your expectations.
During our meeting, you did express displeasure on the rates we have been
offering on our circuit boards. On my return to the ofﬁce I had a meeting with
our CEO in which **decided we will offer Yano an all-units discount as per
schedule below:
Order quantity range
Effective purchase price per unit
0–600 circuit boards
$30.00
600–1500 circuit boards
$29.00
More than 1500 circuit boards
$28.00
I am genuinely hoping you will appreciate the new rates, and am sure Yano
and SK Electronics will continue collaborating in the coming years.
Regards
Cindy

Lot-Sizing Heuristics
5.1
Introduction
Corn ﬂour additive, a customized masala,1 is used by Rosetta’s to make
corn-ﬂavored tortillas. Rosetta’s buys this each month from their preferred
vendor. The demand for this item varies each month. It peaks during prima-
vera and starts dipping as summer approaches. It increases once again during
the rainy season. However, the demand for this item is known at least
6 months in advance, thanks to Rosetta’s demand estimation system for this
product that forecasts fairly accurately the monthly demand. The demand
(in kilograms) over the next 6 months (January through June) is as shown
below.

Considering the fact that demand varies each month, what quantity should
Rosettas order, and when? These are the questions that will be addressed in
this chapter.
In the running example (presented in the box), the demand for the corn ﬂour
additive varies during each period. It invalidates one of the key assumptions of
applying the classical EOQ formula for computing economic lot size – that of
1A mixture of spices.

constant demand. The EOQ formula, therefore, cannot be used. In such a situation
we can apply one of the several lot-sizing heuristics that have been developed.
Heuristics provide a practical method of arriving at a solution that is feasible but not
necessarily optimal. The following terminologies have been used in this chapter:
•
Order Horizon: This is the number of periods for which an order is expected to
meet the demand. If we place an order at the beginning of a period, and the size
of the order is big enough to meet the demand for, say, three periods, then we say
the order horizon is three periods.
•
Planning Horizon: This is the ﬁnite number of periods over which a lot-sizing
problem is to be solved. We know the demand for corn ﬂour additive for the next
6 months (January–June), and we need to determine the order size. The planning
horizon, in the case of the running example, is 6 periods (months).
•
Closeness Factor: An order cost is incurred each time an order is placed. A holding
cost, based on the number of units of items held in the inventory, is also incurred.
The closeness factor is the parameter computed as the difference of the order cost
to the total holding costs for a given iteration. While comparing closeness factors
between iterations, the one that is smaller corresponds to the optimal order.
•
Iteration: This is a repetition of a step with different parameters. In the context of
this chapter, the term iteration refers to computing the inventory costs for
different periods.
5.1.1
Assumptions
The following assumptions have been made while discussing lot-sizing heuristics in
this chapter:
•
The demand is for a single item.
•
The demand for the item under consideration is known.
•
Replenishment lead time is zero.
•
Orders are placed at the beginning of a period, i.e., the ﬁrst day of the period.
Items ordered are received in full instantaneously. There are no defective items
received.
•
The size of the order placed is such that it completely meets the demand for that
period or an integral number of periods.
•
There are no capacity constraints, i.e., storage capacity is inﬁnite.
5.2
Lot-Sizing Heuristics
While several heuristics can be found in literature (see Sreekumar et al. 1991; Silver
et al. 1998; Nahmias 2005), we will restrict our discussion to the application of the
following that are more popular in the industry:
92

Lot-Sizing Heuristics

(a) Lot-for-Lot
(b) Part-Period Balancing
(c) Silver-Meal
(d) Least Unit Cost, and
(e) Wagner-Whitin
Each of the above methods is discussed in detail in the following sections.
5.2.1
Lot-for-Lot Heuristic
Lot-for-lot is one of the simplest of heuristics to implement. As the name suggests,
this heuristic is based on the philosophy that we place an order for a quantity that is
equal to the demand for any given period (month, in this case).
Consider the demand for corn ﬂour additive as shown in Table 5.1. If we are to
use lot-for-lot method, then we would place an order for 36 units at the beginning of
January, 60 units at the beginning of February, 85 units at the beginning of March,
and so on. Let us now compute the total inventory cost using the Lot-for-Lot
method. We are given the following information:
•
Order cost Co is $80 per order
•
Holding cost Ch is $1.75 per unit per period
Iteration 12
We start the solution process by placing an order for 36 units, in January.

If we place an order for 36 units at the beginning of January, we incur the
following costs:

Description
Ordering cost
Since an order is placed, we incur an ordering cost of $80.
Holding cost
We assume that the ordered quantity will be received in full
at the beginning of January. Thus, the inventory level at the beginning
of January would be 36 units and that at the end of January would be 0.
The average inventory level in January would, therefore, be
¼ 36 þ 0

¼18 units
The holding cost for January would thus be 18  $1.75 or $31.5
Iteration 2
Next, we place an order for 60 units at the beginning of February that will
completely meet the demand for that month.

We assume that the ordered quantity will be received in full

The average inventory level in February would, therefore, be
¼ 60 þ 0
2
¼30 units
The holding cost for February would thus be 30  $1.75 or $52.5
Using the same technique, we ﬁnd the total inventory costs assuming that an
order is placed at the beginning of each month that would completely satisfy the
demand for that month. The total inventory costs would be as shown in Table 5.2.
So, if we are to use the lot-for-lot method, the total inventory cost would be
$747.75.

A note on calculation of holding cost
When calculating the holding cost, we assume that the ordered quantity will
be received in full at the beginning of a given period. Thus, the inventory
level at the beginning of a period would be D1units and that at the end of
the period would be 0. The average inventory is D1þ0
2 , and the holding cost is
D1þ0

Ch: (Srinivasan 2010). This method of calculation is consistent with the
approach taken in other chapters in this book.
5.2.2
Part-Period Balancing
Part-Period Balancing (PPB) is a heuristic that is based on the concept of balancing
the order cost with the holding cost. This method requires calculating the holding
costs as a function of the number of periods the current order spans, or the order
horizon (Nahmias 2005). An iteration is completed when the holding costs for an

order exceed the order cost. The order quantity that has a total holding cost closest
to the order cost is considered to be optimal. This can be described mathematically
as follows:
Let
•
d1 , d2 , d3 ,    , dn be the demand for an item in a period, spanning a horizon of
n periods
•
Co be the ordering cost
•
Ch be the holding cost per item per period

horizon is given by

If the Cr over an order horizon of ( j  1) periods is smaller (i.e., closer to Co)

optimal order quantity in this case would be

In the following section, we will learn the PPB heuristic by applying it to the
problem presented in the running example. We will use the same cost parameters
that we used earlier, i.e.,
•
Ordering cost Cois $80 per order
•
Holding cost Chis $1.75 per unit per period

following costs:

We assume that the ordered quantity will be received in full

The holding cost for January would thus be 18  $1.75 or $31.50
In this case, the holding cost ($31.5) is less than the order cost ($80). Therefore,
the next step would be to set the order horizon to 2 months – January and February –
and place one order, at the beginning of January, that would meet the requirements
for both January and February. We perform the next iteration using this
information.

Order horizon is 2 months. We combine the demands for

The demand for January is 36 units and that for February is 60 units. If we place
an order for 96 units at the beginning of January, the following costs would be
incurred:
Type of cost
Description
Ordering cost
Since an order is placed, we incur an ordering cost of $80.
Holding cost
Since we receive the ordered quantity of 96 units in full
at the beginning of January, the inventory level at the beginning
of January is 96 units. The inventory level at the end of January is 60 units.
So the average inventory level in January would be
¼ 96 þ 60

The inventory level at the beginning of February would be 60 units
and at the end of February would be 0.
So, the average inventory level in February would be
¼ 60 þ 0

The total holding cost for the months of January and February
would, therefore, be:
¼(78 þ 30)  $1.75 ¼ $189.00
5.2
Lot-Sizing Heuristics
97

At this point we notice that the holding cost ($189) has exceeded the cost of
placing one order ($80). We now need to check the Cr values. The calculation of Cr
can be accomplished as follows:
From Iteration 1.1, we see that the holding cost for ordering 36 units in January is
$31.5. The Cr for this option is |$80  $31.5| ¼ $48.5.
From Iteration 1.2, we see that the holding cost for ordering 96 units in January is
$189. The Cr for this option is |$80  $189| ¼ $109. It should be noted that we are
interested only in the difference between the holding costs and the ordering cost.
Therefore, we ignore the sign.
As seen from Table 5.3, Cr for the lot size of 36 units is smaller for the two order
horizons – January and January þ February (or the total holding cost is closer to the
ordering cost). We can, therefore, conclude that it is economical to place an order
for 36 units in January, which will help meet the demand for January alone.
Iteration 2.1
Since the demand for February was not included in the previous lot size, we start a
new iteration after setting the starting period to February. The demand for February
is 60 units.

Thus, the holding cost for February would be 30  $1.75 or $52.50.
The holding cost ($52.5) is less than the order cost ($80). Therefore, the next step
is to set an order horizon to 2 months – February and March – and place one order,

Description
Ordering cost
Since an order is placed, we incur an ordering cost of $80.
Holding cost
Since we receive the ordered quantity of 145 units in full at the
beginning of February, the inventory level at the beginning of February
is 145 units. The inventory level at the end of February is 85 units.
So the average inventory level in February would be
¼ 145 þ 85

The inventory level at the beginning of March would be 85 units
and at the end of March would be 0.
So the average inventory level in March would, therefore, be

The total holding cost for the months of February and March would,
therefore, be

At this stage, we notice that the total holding cost ($275.625) has exceeded the
order cost ($80). We now need to check the Cr values.
As seen from Table 5.4, the Cr for February is closer than that of the combined
February and March order horizon. We can, therefore, conclude that it is econom-
ical to place an order for 60 units in February, which will help meet the demand for
February only.

The total holding cost for month of June would, therefore, be

Since we currently do not know the demands for the month beyond June we can
stop the solution procedure. We assume that it is economical to place an order for
75 units at the beginning of June. The solution to the lot-sizing problem presented in
the running example, based on part-period balancing method, is as shown in
Table 5.7
The solution produced by the part-period balancing method suggests that we
place an order for 36 units in January, 60 units in February, 85 units in March,
50 units in April (that would cover the demand for April and May), and 75 units in
June. The total inventory cost for the planning horizon is $736.
Solved Problem 5.2
Monthly demand for an item over 6 months is 32, 19, 12, 15, 23, and 12, units
respectively. Using the Part Period Balancing method, determine the total inventory
cost if the holding cost is $1.5 per unit per month and the ordering cost is $40 per
order.

Silver-Meal Heuristic
The Silver-Meal heuristic (Silver and Meal 1973) involves computing the total
inventory costs per period. The key idea behind this heuristic is that the total
relevant costs per unit time for the duration of the replenishment quantity are
minimized (Silver et al. 1998).

We next start a new iteration after setting the starting period to June. The demand
for June is 75 units. Since we currently do not know the demands for the months

Since we do not have the demands for the subsequent months, we stop the
solution process here. The solution summary to this lot-sizing problem based on the
Silver-Meal method is shown in Table 5.8.
The solution produced by the Silver-Meal method suggests that we place an
order for 36 units in January, 60 units in February, 96 units in March (that would
cover demand for March and April), 39 units in May, and 75 units in June. The total
inventory cost for the planning horizon is $687.
Solved Problem 5.3
Monthly demand for an item over 6 months is 32, 19, 12, 15, 23, and 12, units
respectively. Using Silver-Meal method, determine the total inventory cost if the

Least Unit Cost Heuristic
In this section, we use the least unit cost method to determine the order quantity and
total inventory costs. This method is very similar to the Silver-Meal heuristic,
except that while Silver-Meal heuristic uses the number of periods to ﬁnd the per
period cost, the least unit cost method uses the number of units in an order horizon
to determine the least unit cost (Nahmias 2005).
Let
•
d1 , d2 , d3 ,    , dn be the demand for an item in the jth period over a planning
horizon of n periods
•
Co be the ordering cost

incurred:

Since an order is placed, we incur an ordering cost of $80.
Holding cost
Since we receive the ordered quantity of 96 units in full at the beginning

inventory level at the end of January is 60 units.
So, the average inventory level in January would be
¼ 96 þ 60

The inventory level at the beginning of February would be 60 units and at
the end of February would be 0.
So, the average inventory level in February would, therefore, be

continue this iteration by combining the demand for January, February, and March
in one order, placed at the beginning of January.

The inventory level at the beginning of March would be 85 units and at
the end of March would be 0.
So, the average inventory level in March would, therefore, be

The total holding cost for the months of January, February, and March

The total inventory cost is $80 þ $560.875 ¼ $640.875

The total demand for January, February, and March is 181 units; the

At this stage, we see that the PUC for order horizon January–February–March
(3.540) is greater than the PUC for two-period order horizon of January–February
(2.802) (see Fig 5.5). Therefore, the optimal order quantity is the sum of the order

As can be seen from Fig. 5.6, since PUC for March and April is greater than PUC

Wagner-Whitin Heuristic
The Wagner-Whitin (Wagner and Whitin 1958) lot-sizing method is one of the
more difﬁcult methods to solve by hand. It uses a forward recursive algorithm.
Using this algorithm, we ﬁrst solve a one-period problem. We continue to sequen-
tially solve subproblems until the solution is found for the entire planning horizon.
It adopts the following principles:
•
An order is placed at the beginning of the month.
•
The order quantity is equal to the demand over a predecided order horizon.
•
If some inventory exists at the beginning of the month, the inventory must be
sufﬁcient to meet the demand for a certain number of months.
Let us now learn the Wagner-Whitin algorithm by solving the corn ﬂour additive
inventory problem presented in the running example. We use the same cost
parameters that have been used earlier, i.e.,
•
Ordering cost Co is $80 per order
•
Holding cost Ch is $1.75 per unit per period
The demand for the problem is as shown below. The planning horizon is
6 months.

Iteration 1
Like in any of the previous methods, we start the ﬁrst iteration by placing an order
for 36 units that would entirely meet the demand for January, and January only. If
we place an order for 36 units at the beginning of January, the following costs
would be incurred:
Type of cost
Description
Ordering cost
Since an order is placed, we incur an ordering cost of $80.
Holding cost
Since we receive the ordered quantity in full at the beginning of January,
the inventory level at the beginning of January would be 36 units. The
inventory level at the end of January would be 0.
The average inventory level in January would, therefore, be
¼ 36 þ 0
2
¼18 units
Thus, the holding cost for January would be 18  $1.75 or $31.5.
Total inventory cost
The total inventory cost of placing an order for 36 units in January is
therefore $80 þ $31.5 ¼ $111.5.
Since there is no other option possible, we consider this to be the most optimal
way to achieve the objective of meeting the demand for the month of January.

Iteration 2
Next, we consider the demand for 60 units in the month of February, in addition to
the demand for 36 units in January. There are two options by which the demand for
February can be met:
•
Option 1: Place an order for combined demand for January and February (total
96 units) at the beginning of January.
•
Option 2: Use the optimal method to meeting January demand (36 units) deter-
mined using iteration 1, and place a new order to meet February demand
(60 units).
If we use Option 1, we incur the following costs:
Type of cost
Description
Ordering cost
Since an order is placed, we incur an ordering cost of $80.
Holding cost
Since we receive the ordered quantity in full at the beginning of January,
the inventory level at the beginning of January would be 96 units. The
inventory level at the end of January would be 60.
The average inventory level in January would, therefore, be
¼ 96 þ 60
2
¼78 units
The inventory level at the beginning of February would be 60 units, and
at the end of February it would be 0.
So, the average inventory level in February would, therefore, be
¼ 60 þ 0
2
¼30 units
Thus, the holding cost for Option 1 would be (78 þ 30)  $1.75 ¼ $189.
Total Inventory Cost
The total inventory cost for Option 1 would be $80 þ $189 ¼ $269
Option 2 involves performing two steps:
•
Use the best way to meet January demand. From Iteration 1, we know that the total
inventory cost of the best way to meet the January demand of 36 units is $111.5.
•
Place a new order to meet February demand of 60 units.
The following costs would be incurred if we place a new order to meet this
demand:
Type of cost
Description
Ordering cost
Since an order is placed in February for 60 units, we incur an ordering

Holding cost
Since we receive the ordered quantity in full at the beginning of February,
the inventory level at the beginning of February would be 60 units. The
inventory level at the end of February would be 0.
The average inventory level in February would, therefore, be
¼ 60 þ 0
2
¼30 units
Thus, the holding cost for February would be (30)  $1.75 or $52.5.
Total inventory cost
The total inventory cost for Option 2 is $111.5 þ $80 þ $52.5 ¼ $244

Lot-Sizing Heuristics

Comparing the total inventory costs for Option 1 and Option 2, we see that the
best way to meet the demand for January and February is to place an order
separately for each month. The inventory costs for Iteration 2 have been summa-
rized in Table 5.10.
Decision: From Table 5.10, we can see that it is optimal to use Option 2, which is
to cover the demand for January in the best possible way, and then place an order
for February in February.
Iteration 3
Next, we consider the demand of 85 units in the month of March. The demand for
March can be met in three possible ways:
•
Option 1: Place an order for combined demand for January, February, and March
(total 181 units) at the beginning of January.
•
Option 2: Use the best method to meet January demand (36 units), and place a
new order at the beginning of February to meet demand for February and March
(145 units).
•
Option 3: Use the best method to meet February demand (60 units), and place a
new order at the beginning of March to meet demand for March (85 units).
If we use Option 1, the following would be the total inventory costs:

The average inventory level in January would, therefore, be
¼ 181 þ 145

The inventory level at the beginning of February would be 145 units and
at the end of February would be 85.
So, the average inventory level in February would, therefore, be

(145 units).
The following costs would be incurred if we place a new order to meet this
demand:

and place a new order at the beginning of March to meet demand for March
(85 units).

Option 3 involves performing two steps:
•
Use the best way to meet February demand. From Iteration 2, we know that the
total inventory cost for the best way to meet the February demand is $244.

inventory level at the end of March would be 0.
The average inventory level in March would, therefore, be
¼ 85 þ 0

¼42.5 units
Thus, the holding cost for March would be (42.5)  $1.75 or $74.375.
Total inventory cost
The total inventory cost for Option 3 is $244 þ $80 þ $74.375 ¼ $398.37
Comparing the total inventory costs for all the three options, we see that the best
way to meet the demand for January through March is to place an order separately
for each month, i.e., 36 units at the beginning of January, 60 units in the beginning
of February, and 85 units in the beginning of March.
Decision: From Table 5.11, we can see that it is optimal to use Option 3, which is
to cover the demand for February in the best possible way, and then place an order
for March in March.
The inventory costs for Iteration 2 have been summarized in Table 5.11.
Iteration 4
Next, we consider the demand for 11 units in the month of April. The demand for
April can be met in four possible ways:
•
Option 1: Place an order for combined demand for January, February, March,
and April (total 192 units) at the beginning of January.

Lot-Sizing Heuristics

5.3
Summary
In this chapter, we explored the lot-sizing heuristics, methods that help ﬁnd feasible
solutions to practical lot-sizing issues when demand is known but varies by time.
Each heuristic has its own unique way of approaching the solution.
The lot-for-lot method requires very little computation. It states that we place an
order for a quantity in a period that completely meets the demand for that period.
The other heuristics require some amount of computation. The part-period
balancing method tries to ﬁnd a feasible solution by balancing the holding cost
with the ordering cost. The Silver-Meal and least unit cost methods produce a
feasible solution by using the concept of average inventory cost – by period and by
quantity (or units) – respectively.
Wagner-Whitin method possibly requires most calculations as it uses a forward
recursive algorithm to sequentially solving the lot-sizing problem. All these
methods, however, require that the holding costs and ordering costs are estimated
accurately.
There is no such thing as the best method, and depending on the situation one of
these methods can be implemented to obtain least cost inventory management
solution.

course material (training material). He uses the training calendar published by
Anita to perform his job.
Ismail gets the training material printed from Printo, a large 24 x 7 digital printing
chain. Printo takes less than 1 h to print, bind, and deliver the training material in a
ready-to-use form – therefore, the lead time may be considered negligible.
Ismail uses a Lot-for-Lot ordering policy to order training materials. One day
before the scheduled training course Ismail places an order with Printo and gets the
student training material delivered by end of the day. For example, if the training
for the month of January is scheduled to start on the January 9, 2017, he would place
an order on the morning of January 8 and get the material by 6:00 pm the same day.
This way he makes sure that the executives attending the training course have their
material at the start of the training course.
Drive to Optimize
You are an Industrial Engineering Consultant. Promantia has approached you to
advise them on optimizing their processes, and to begin with they have requested
you to focus on inventory management of training material. They have provided

Next, compute the reorder interval given by T ¼ Q∗
D . Using the values of Q∗
(24) and D (120), we get T ¼ 0.2 years. If we assume 360 days in a year we get
T ¼ 72 days. This means we place an order of 24 units every 72 days. Thus, if the
ﬁrst order is placed on 1st January, the second order would be placed on 12th
March, the third order on 24th May, the fourth order on 6th August, the ﬁfth order
on 18th October, and the last order on 31st December.

Problem 5.3
Karla, an Inventory Manager of a large retail warehouse, has done considerable
research in application of part-period balancing lot-sizing heuristic. This heuristic
tries to balance the holding cost for an order horizon with the ordering cost.
Mathematically, if the total holding cost an order horizon of ( j  1) periods is
closer to the ordering cost, then the part-period balancing heuristic sets the
optimal order horizon to ( j  1) periods. The optimal order quantity in such a
case is given by
Qj1 ¼

Di
where, D1 , D2 , D3 ,    , Dn is the demand for an item over a horizon of n periods,
and i 2 j.

However, Karla believes that the closeness of the holding cost to the ordering
cost must be determined based on the ratio rather that absolute numbers. Mathe-
matically, Karla believes that to determine the closeness one need to ﬁnd the ratio of
the ordering cost to the holding cost for an order horizon, given by
Cr ¼

If the Cr over an order horizon of ( j  1) periods is closer to 1 than that of
j periods, then we set the optimal order horizon to ( j  1) periods. Here, Co is the
ordering cost and Ch is the holding cost per item per period.
If you were to use Karla’s suggestion to solve Rosetta’s problem presented in the
running example, what would be the total inventory cost? Use the same parameters,
i.e., Order cost Cois $80 per order and Holding cost Chis $1.75 per unit per period,
and compare the results [Level: Hard].

Stochastic Inventory Models
6.1
Introduction
At Rosetta’s, demand for vegetable oil has been fairly steady and constant,
and that for corn ﬂour additive has been predictable. But the demand for eggs
has been very uncertain. There have been instances when less than 200 eggs
have been consumed in a week. There have also been instances when more
than 900 eggs have been used up in a week. On an average, the demand for
eggs has been around 500 per week.
Because the demand for the item is not constant, the EOQ formula cannot be
applied. How, then, would managers at Rosetta’s manage inventory of items
whose demand is uncertain? This concern will be addressed as part of this
chapter.
In Chap. 3, we presented mathematical models that help us determine economic
order quantity, Q, and reorder level, s, for continuous review-based systems, and the
optimal time between review periods, T, for periodic review-based systems. One
assumption we made was the demand and replenishment lead times were known
with certainty. However, in real life this is not always true and, therefore, deter-
ministic inventory models may not be suitable in all situations. Several methods
have been developed to manage inventories in situations where demand and/or
replenishment lead times are uncertain. Fig. 6.1 shows a high-level classiﬁcation of
these methods. Each of these methods is described in detail in this chapter.

6.2
Continuous Review-Based Models
It is recalled from Chap. 2 that in a continuous review-based inventory system a
replenishment order is placed when the inventory falls to s, the reorder level, which is
a function of lead time demand. When the demand is variable, a range of demands is
possible during the lead time. Because of this, there is a possibility of stockout – a
situation in which demand occurs and there is no inventory on hand to satisfy it. Every
time a stockout occurs a cost is incurred. This cost is referred to as the stockout cost.
Development of an inventory model involves balancing all types of inventory costs such
as the carrying costs, ordering costs, and, in this situation, stockout costs. Computing
stockout costs accurately1 is extremely difﬁcult (Monks 1987). Most researchers rec-
ommend maintenance of safety stock to reduce possibility of stockout.
6.3
Service Levels and Safety Stock
Safety stock (SS) is an additional amount of inventory that is carried to meet
ﬂuctuations in demand. Safety stock helps reduce the probability of stockout. A
key pre-requisite though is the establishment of a service level. A service level is a
policy measure set by inventory managers that help determine the level of safety

stock that needs to be maintained to protect themselves from stockout situations.
Silver et al. (1998) have discussed several types of service levels in inventory
management. Two types of service levels commonly used in inventory management
are (1) a measure based on the proportion of order cycles in which no stockouts occur,
called the cycle service level and (2) a measure based on the proportion of customer
demands that are satisﬁed from the inventory on hand, also referred to as the ﬁll rate
(Nahmias 2005). Table 6.1 shows sales data for an item – demand in number of units
and number of items out of stock – by order cycle.
Using the data presented, two types of service levels can be computed:
(a) The proportion of order cycles in which no stockouts occur, or cycle service
level. No stockout was experienced in 8 of the 12 order cycles. The cycle
service level, therefore, is 8
12 ¼ 0:67. In other words, there is a 67% probability
of not stocking out in a replenishment cycle.
(b) The proportion of demand that is met out of stock on hand, called the ﬁll rate, is
another service level which measures the stock performance. In the situation
presented in Table 6.1, demand for 259 units was met from inventory held on
hand, or ﬁll rate is 30041
ð
Þ
300
¼ 0:86. In other words, the ﬁll rate is 86%.
In the remainder of this chapter, we discuss various methods of calculation of
safety stock for a speciﬁed type of service level.
6.4
Determining Safety Stock Level
There are several methods that can be used to determine safety stock. These
methods require a thorough analysis of the historical demand and lead time data.
Organizations may not always have sufﬁcient data to analyze the variability of

demand during lead time. In such situations, they may use a frequency distribution
to determine the level of safety stock.
6.4.1
Using Frequency and Cumulative Distribution
Consider an example of weekly demand for eggs at Rosetta’s as shown in Table 6.2.
The frequency column in the table shows the number of times the corresponding
demand has been observed. For example, a demand of more than 100 eggs but less
than 200 eggs has been observed 7 times out of a total 124 observations. Let us
assume the procurement lead time for eggs from the local supplier is constant for
1 week.
The ﬁrst step is to generate a cumulative probability distribution (see Table 6.3).
The cumulative probability can be obtained by dividing the cumulative frequency
by the total number of observations (124 observations in this case). For example,
the probability that the demand would be up to 200 units is 9
124 or 0.07. It also means
that the probability that the demand would exceed 200 units is 0.93. The probability
of demand ﬁts in well with the concept of service level.
The next step is to plot a graph of demand (X-axis) vs service level (Y-axis). One
may use MS Excel to generate a scatterplot, a graph that illustrates the relationship
between two variables.2 This is shown in Fig. 6.2. Once the graph is plotted, we can
use the median, or the 50th percentile, to estimate the average weekly demand.
From Fig. 6.2, we can see that the demand that corresponds to the median (or the
50th percentile) is 500. The average weekly demand Da is, therefore, 500 eggs.

Stochastic Inventory Models

We can also use the graph to estimate the demand for a service level of, say, 85%,
which corresponds to the 85th percentile value of the cumulative distribution. As can
be seen from the graph, this is 720. This means that there is an 85% chance that the
demand for eggs in a given week may be up to 720. Alternatively, there is a 15%
chance that the demand for eggs in a given week may exceed 720. We can now use
this information to compute the level of safety stock. The safety stock (SSsl) is the
difference between the maximum demand established for a given service level (Dsl)
and the average demand
 d

. Mathematically, this can be expressed as follows:
SSsl ¼ Dsl  d

Determining Safety Stock Level
149

Since we know that the maximum demand for eggs for a service level of 85% is
720 and the average demand is 500, using Eq. 6.1, we have
SS0:85 ¼ 720  500 ¼ 220 eggs
Thus, the safety stock required to maintain a service level of 85% is 220 eggs.
The cost of maintaining the safety stock is a function of the inventory carrying rate
(i), the cost of the item (C), and the size of the safety stock. This can be expressed as
Css ¼ iC:SSsl
ð6:2Þ
where SSsl is the safety stock for a desired service level.
The problem of variation in lead times can also be solved in a similar fashion by
developing a cumulative probability distribution for lead times. If the service level
is established, we can then ﬁnd the safety stock, SSsl, for the speciﬁed service level.
It should be noted that in the case of variable lead time the safety stock would be
expressed in terms of usage of inventory over a given period. Safety stock can be
determined using Eq. 6.3:
SSsl ¼ LTsl  L
ð6:3Þ
In this equation, LTsl is the lead time for the speciﬁed service level and L is the
average
lead
time
(corresponding
to
50th
percentile
on
the
cumulative
probability plot).
Solved Problem 6.1
Historical data presented in Table 6.4 shows a manufacturer’s weekly demand for
an item that has a constant lead time of 1 week. The item costs $50 per unit. The
manufacturer uses an inventory carrying rate of 20% per year. Determine the safety
stock and the carrying costs if the manufacturer desires service levels of (a) 85%
and (b) 95%.
Solution
This problem can be solved in the following four steps:
Step 1: First, we generate a cumulative probability distribution. This is shown in
Table 6.5.
Step 2: We generate a plot of cumulative probability distribution, as shown in
Fig. 6.3, with quantity on the X-axis and cumulative probability on the Y-axis.

Stochastic Inventory Models

From Fig. 6.3, we see that the demand that corresponds to the 50th percentile is
250. The average weekly demand d is, therefore, 250 units. We can also use the
graph to estimate the demand for service levels of 85% and 95%, which
corresponds to the 85th and 95th percentile value of the cumulative distribution.
As can be seen from the graph, this is 390 and 450, respectively. Since the
maximum demand for a service level of 85% (D0.85) is 390 units and the average
demand is 250, using Eq. 6.1, we have
SS0:85 ¼ 390  250 ¼ 140 units

Determining Safety Stock Level

Thus, the safety stock required to maintain a service level of 85% is 140 units.
The cost of maintaining safety stock can be computed using Eq. 6.2. The cost of
maintaining this safety stock of 140 units is 0.2  50  140 ¼ $1,400 per year.
Similarly, the maximum demand for a service level of 95% is 450 units. Using
Eq. 6.1, we have
SS0:95 ¼ 450  250 ¼ 200 units
Thus, the safety stock required to maintain a service level of 95% is 200 units.
The cost of maintaining this safety stock of 200 units is 0.2  50  200 ¼
$2000 per year.
Solved Problem 6.2
A manufacturing ﬁrm procures raw materials from an international supplier. The
procurement lead time varies as seen from the 40 observations in Table 6.6. What
amount of safety stock (in days) would the manufacturer need to carry in order to
ensure that they have the raw material on hand 85% of the time to meet the
production requirements?
Solution
As seen earlier, this can be solved in the following three steps:
Step 1: Generate cumulative probability distribution as shown in Table 6.7.
Step 2: Generate a plot of cumulative probability distribution with lead time on the
X-axis and cumulative probability on the Y-axis. This is as shown in Fig. 6.4.
Step 3: As can be seen from Fig. 6.4, the average lead time (corresponding to 50th
percentile) is 4.7 days. The lead time that corresponds to 85th percentile is
7 days. Substituting the values for the average and 85th percentile lead times
in Eq. 6.3, we get
SSsl ¼ 7  4:7 ¼ 2:3 days
The safety stock that is needed to maintain a service level of 85% is equal to
2.3 days’ usage. If the daily usage of the raw material is known, the safety stock, in
terms of units, can be easily determined.

In the previous section, we discussed a method of determining the safety stock
when the amount of available historical data is not very large. However, when
sufﬁcient amount of data is available, we may be in a position to ﬁt it to a known
statistical distribution.3 When the lead time demand is variable, a range of demands
is possible as shown in Fig. 6.5. In this section, we assume that the range of demand

continuous distributions may also be used.
Figure 6.6 shows the relationship between the reorder level and safety stock for
the desired service level. In the following sections, we describe methods for

6.4.2.1
Reorder Level – Variable Demand, Constant Lead Time
Let us ﬁrst consider the case when demand is variable and the lead time is constant.
Following assumptions have been made in determining the reorder level:
•
The inventory system is reviewed continuously.
•
The inventory system involves a single item.
•
Demand is for the item is random, but the distribution governing the demand is
known or can be estimated. We assume the demand is normally distributed with
a known mean and standard deviation.
•
Lead time is known and constant.
•
A ﬁxed setup cost is incurred every time an order is placed.
The order size can be determined using Eq. 3.8 as discussed in Chap. 3,
reproduced as follows for convenience:
Q ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
2DCo
iC
r
When demand is normally distributed with a known mean and standard devia-
tion, the reorder level, s, is given by
s ¼ dL þ zσd
ð6:4Þ
where
•
d is the average demand;
•
L is the lead time;
•
z is the number of standard deviations for a speciﬁed cycle service level;
•
σd is the standard deviation of lead time demand.
The units for average demand and lead time must be consistent, i.e., if the
demand period is speciﬁed in days, then the lead time must also be in days. If the
problem speciﬁes standard deviation of daily demand, then Eq. 6.4 may also be
written as
s ¼ dL þ zσi
ﬃﬃﬃ
L
p
ð6:5Þ
where
•
d is the average daily demand;
•
L is the lead time in days;
•
z is the number of standard deviations for a speciﬁed cycle service level;
•
σi is the standard deviation of the daily demand.

Normal distribution functions in MS Excel
If the desired cycle service level is speciﬁed, the MS Excel function NORM .
S . INV(p) may be used to obtain the value of z, the standard normal variate
for the speciﬁed service level (or probability). For example, if the desired
cycle service level is 85%, the MS Excel function returns:
z ¼ NORM:S:INV 0:85
ð
Þ ¼ 1:03
Another MS Excel function NORM.DIST can be used to obtain the cycle
service level for a given replenishment policy. This function needs other
inputs such as the reorder level (s), the lead time demand
 d L

, and the
standard deviation of lead time demand (σd). The syntax for usage of the
function is as follows:
Cycle Service Level ¼ NORM:DIST

s; dL; σd; FLAG

For example, if the reorder level is 1000, lead time demand is 500 units,
and the standard deviation of lead time demand is 300 units, MS Excel
function returns:
¼ NORM:DIST 1000; 500; 300; TRUE
ð
Þ ¼ 0:95
or the cycle service level is 95%. It should be noted that the FLAG must be
always set to TRUE to obtain a cumulative value.
To determine the ﬁll rate, fr, we need to perform the following steps:
First, determine the expected shortage per order cycle, Es. This can be
estimated using the following function in MS Excel (Chopra and Meindl
2010):
Es ¼ σ  NORMDIST SS
σ ; 0; 1; 0


 SS 1  NORMDIST SS
σ ; 0; 1; 1




where
SS is the safety stock;
σ is the standard deviation of the lead time demand.
For example, if the safety stock is 75 units and the standard deviation of
lead time demand is 12 units, then the expected shortage is
Es ¼ 60  NORMDIST 75
60; 0; 1; 0

Stochastic Inventory Models

Once we have the expected shortage per order cycle, we can use the
following equation to determine the ﬁll rate:
f r ¼ Q  Es
Q
For example, if the order quantity Q is 500 units and the expected shortage
per cycle is 3 units, then the ﬁll rate is
f r ¼ 500  3
500
¼ 0:994
or the ﬁll rate is 99.4%.
Demand period and lead time – things to consider
Demand period is the time period for which demand is speciﬁed. It is very
important that the units used for all parameters in a given problem (such as demand
period, lead time, etc.) be consistent. To solve a numerical problem, we would need
the standard deviation of the lead time demand. Problems in inventory management
may specify the lead time demand and standard deviation directly, which can be
substituted in Eq. 6.4 to obtain the reorder level. However, in some cases, the
problem may specify the standard deviation of the daily demand, σi. In this case, we
may use Eq. 6.5 to solve the problem. If not, following adjustments will be required
to be made.
Case 1: If demand period is less than lead time
Consider the following example where the standard deviation of daily demand
is 4 units and the lead time is 3 days. Assuming the demand for each day is
independent, the standard deviation of lead time demand is equal to the square
root of the sum of the variances of daily demand (Jacobs and Chase 2011). In other
words,

where
σd is the standard deviation of the lead time demand, and

Substituting the values in Eq. 6.6, we get

Case 2: Demand period is greater than lead time
Consider a problem where the demand period is greater than lead time (e.g. demand
is annual and lead time is speciﬁed in days). If the standard deviation of demand
period is given and we need to determine the standard deviation of lead time
demand, we can use the following:
σd ¼ σiﬃﬃﬃn
p
ð6:7Þ
where n is the number of lead time periods that make up the demand period. For
example, if demand period is in months and lead time is in weeks, then n ¼ 4 (i.e.,
4 weeks make up a month). General rules to be followed are shown in Table 6.8
Solved Problem 6.3
The daily demand for an item is normally distributed with a mean of 100 units and a
standard deviation of 3 units. If the procurement lead time is 6 days, compute the
standard deviation of lead time demand.
Solution
In this problem, demand period is 1 day (daily) and lead time is 6 days. Since demand
period is smaller than lead time, we use Eq. 6.6 to obtain the standard deviation of
lead time demand. The standard deviation of the daily demand is 3. The standard
deviation of lead time demand, assuming demand for each day is independent, is
σd ¼

The demand for an item in a month is normally distributed with a mean of 100 units
and a standard deviation of 3 units. If the lead time is 1 week, compute the standard
deviation of the lead time demand.
Solution
In this problem, the demand period is 1 month and lead time is 1 week. Since
demand period is greater than the lead time, we use Eq. 6.7 to obtain the standard
deviation of lead time demand. We assume there are 4 weeks in a month, so n ¼ 4.
Using Eq. 6.7, and substituting the values, we get

The standard deviation of lead time demand is 1.5 units.

Solved Problem 6.5
Daily demand for a certain item is governed by a normal distribution with a mean of
100 units and a standard deviation of 8 units. The time between placing an order and
receipt of supply is fairly constant at 5 days. The ordering cost per order is $25 and
the cost per item is $50. Assume 360 working days in a year and 20% interest rate
per year. Answer the following questions (no backlogging allowed):
(a) Compute the optimal order quantity.
(b) Compute the reorder level to satisfy an 85% probability of not stocking out
during the lead time.
(c) Compute the ﬁll rate for the replenishment policy.
(d) What safety stock would need to be maintained to achieve a ﬁll rate of 0.99?
Solution
The following data are available with us:
•
Mean daily demand, d , is 100 units (Annual demand is 36,000 units per year).
•
Standard deviation of daily demand, σi, is 8 units.
•
Lead time is 5 days.
•
Ordering cost, Co, is $25 per order.
•
Cost of item, C, is $50.
•
Carrying interest rate, i, is 0.20.

The ordering policy for the given problem is as follows:

Alternatively, we can use Eq. 6.5 to obtain the reorder level when the
standard deviation of daily demand is speciﬁed. Note that we have the follow-
ing data:
• Mean daily demand, d , is 100 units

Reorder Level – Variable Lead Time, Constant Demand
In this section, we consider the case where the replenishment lead time is variable
and the demand is constant. Following assumptions have been made is determining
the reorder level for this case:
•
The inventory system is reviewed continuously, i.e., the inventory level is
known at all times.
•
The inventory system involves a single item.
•
Demand for the item is known and constant.
•
Lead time is random but the distribution governing the lead time demand is
known (normally distributed).
The order size can be determined using Eq. 3.8 as discussed in Chap. 3. When
the demand is constant and lead time is variable, the reorder level, s, is given by
s ¼ dL þ zdσL
ð6:8Þ
where
•
d is the daily demand;
•
L is the average lead time;
•
z is the standardized normal variate;
•
The term σL represents the standard deviation of lead time.
In Eq. 6.8, the term zdσL represents the safety stock.

The daily demand experienced by small home computer assembler is normally

assembler sources the RAM for the computer from a supplier in the local market.

Solved Problem 6.11
Compute the reorder level and safety stock using the following data, assuming
demand and lead times are normally distributed:
•
Average demand is 30 units per day
•
Standard deviation of demand is 5 per day
•
Average lead time is 10 days
•
Standard deviation of lead time is 3 days
•
85% probability of not stocking out during lead time is desired

Since both the demand and lead time are variable, we use Eq. 6.9 to compute the
reorder level. The value of z for a probability of 0.85 is follows:

Steren sells just one type of electric adaptors that are used in households and ofﬁces.
Demand for adaptors is normally distributed with a mean of 500 units per month
and a standard deviation of 20 units per month. The inventory carrying cost, Ch, is
$0.5 per piece per month, and ordering cost per order, Co, is $350 per order. If
backlogging is allowed and the shortage cost is $5 per adaptor per month, compute
the EOQ and the reorder level for an 85% probability of not stocking out during the

Periodic Review-based Models
Recall that in periodic review models, the inventory levels are reviewed at
predetermined, discrete times such as every Friday, the last working day of every
month, etc. A review of on-hand inventory is conducted at time, T, and an order is
placed. The order quantity is equivalent to the quantity that is needed to bring the
inventory level back up to a prespeciﬁed maximum level, S. Therefore, in periodic
review models, the order quantities generated varies each period. In this section, we
describe methods for computing the order quantity, safety stock, and/or the max-
imum inventory for the following scenarios (Sharma 2006, Venkataraman and
Pinto 2017):
•
Demand is variable, lead time is constant.
•
Lead time is variable, demand is constant.
•
Both demand and lead times are variable.

Order Quantity – Variable Demand and Constant
Lead Time
Let us consider the case when demand is variable and the lead time is constant. We
make the following assumptions:
•
The inventory system is reviewed periodically with a review period of T days.
•
The inventory system involves a single item.
•
Demand for the item is random, but the distribution governing the demand is
known or can be estimated. We assume the demand is normally distributed with
a known mean and standard deviation.
•
Lead time, L, is known and constant.
•
An order of size Q is placed on completion of the review. The size of the order is
such that it brings the inventory on hand, I, up to a maximum level, S, speciﬁed
by the management. Q will, therefore, vary from period to period.
The ﬁrst step in solving the variable demand, constant lead time review period
problem is to determine the optimal review period T. This can be computed using
Eq. 3.24 from Chap. 3, which is reproduced as follows:

Summary
In this chapter, we discussed inventory models that account for the uncertainty of
demand (and lead time). When demand for an item is uncertain, there could be
situations when demand could exceed expectations or orders may arrive late. This
situation results in a stockout that may, in turn, result in business losses. To reduce
the impact of uncertainty on demand, inventory managers carry additional inven-
tory – called the safety stock. In this chapter,we discussed how we could use the
historical data and ﬁt it into a probability distribution (discrete as well as continu-
ous) to determine the size of safety stock.
The following three cases were examined in detail, for continuous review as well
as periodic review-based systems:
•
Demand is uncertain and lead time is constant
•
Demand is constant and lead time is uncertain
•
Both demand and lead time are uncertain

Case Study – Trading
Juan Manuel is the proprietor of a 6-year-old trading ﬁrm based in Leon, Mexico.
Juan buys fractional horsepower (FHP) motors from the cheaper local market and
sells them to manufacturers of electrical switch gears at a higher rate globally. This
model has worked very well for Juan. Since he uses a local, reliable supplier, the
replenishment lead time is a constant 1 month. Juan has not been using any
scientiﬁc inventory management techniques. The size of the order is arbitrary,
and neither is the cycle time ﬁxed. This was the way he worked in the initial
years after starting the trading business.
Six years hence, Juan’s business has grown. Several global brands now source
their requirements of FHP motors from him, and they are not very tolerant to late
deliveries. Being in the business for the last 6 years has made Juan realize the
importance of scientiﬁc inventory management. He knows that a shortage of
inventory, when demand occurs, would be catastrophic. While he understands
meeting every customer demand would be impossible, he is keen, however, to
minimize such undesirable events.
Juan has, therefore, set up on a journey to improve the way he manages
inventory at his ﬁrm. He starts looking at his invoices, customer orders, and
everything he has got on his computer. After a week, Juan has been able to tabulate
the sales data for the last 36 months (3 years) for one of the fast-moving models –
FHPX3. This is shown in the folowing table:

Appendix 6A: EOQ – When Shortage Costs Are Known
Monks (1987) suggests that when the stockout costs are known accurately, they can
be included in the EOQ formula just like the ordering cost. We start by computing
the EOQ, which we know can be computed using Eq. 3.8, reproduced as follows:

Next, we compute the implied stockout cost per order, which is given by

where Cs is the stockout cost per order. We can use the implied stockout cost in the
following equation to obtain the revised EOQ with stockout costs:

A ﬁrm has an annual demand of 1200 units that costs $65 and an ordering cost of
$20 per order. If the ﬁrm uses an inventory rate of 25% per year, compute the

As described earlier, this problem will need to be solved iteratively. We start by
computing the EOQ without shortages. We have the following information with us:
•
D is 1200 units
•
Co is $20
•
i, the inventory rate, is 25% per year
•

The procedure to compute safety stock expected to satisfy the desired ﬁll rate is
complex. However, we may use the NORM.DIST and GOAL SEEK functions in
MS Excel to solve this problem. When the demand for an item is normally
distributed with a demand D, standard deviation, and safety stock SS, the expected
shortage per order cycle can be given by (See Chopra and Meindel 2010):

The GOAL SEEK function (navigate to Data tab, and then to What-if Analysis
(in the forecast group)) may be used to determine the optimal value for SS.
The formula in cell G40 is

Multi-item Inventory Models Subject
to Constraints
7.1
Introduction
Inventory managers at Rosetta’s manage a large number of items in stock
such as corn ﬂour, vegetable oil, cooking gas, yeast, and several others.
Stocking decisions of these items are dependent on each other. For example,
the decision to stock a certain amount of vegetable oil depends on the amount
of corn ﬂour being stocked. What this means for Rosetta’s is that stocking
large quantities of vegetable oil and small amount of corn ﬂour is not really
going to help. Another problem being faced by them is the fact that the
management wants to restrict the amount of money they lock in inventory.
In these situations, what should be their replenishment policy?
In this chapter we address multi-item inventory decisions that are subject to
one or more resource constraints.
Inventory managers are expected to manage a large number of items. Stocking
decisions are usually made jointly among the many items managed at a given
location (Muckstadt and Sapra 2010). Consider the situation at Rosetta’s (see box
above) where they decide to order vegetable oil and corn ﬂour, both based on the
EOQ. Table 7.1 lists the inventory data that are needed for computation of
order size.
Substituting the above values in Eq. 3.8 (from Chap. 3), we can determine the
EOQs for both these items, which are shown in Table 7.2.
Using the EOQs, we can compute the amount Rosetta’s would need to invest in
the inventory of these two items, which is

If Rosetta’s decide to use EOQ to manage their inventory system, they would
lock up $14,370 in the inventory of these two items, on an average. However, the
management of Rosetta’s may want to limit the investment to a smaller amount, say
$12,000. Because of the interdependency between vegetable oil and corn ﬂour,
Rosetta’s would need to adjust the order size downward for both the items to satisfy
the constraint of $12,000.
What we discussed above was a case of budgetary constraint. Manufacturing
organizations work under several constraints, including budgetary constraint. In
this chapter, we will review multi-item inventory models that are subject to the
following constraints:
•
Budget constraint, or the average investment in inventory
•
Space constraint, or the amount of space available to stock the items
•
Number of orders constraint, or the number of orders that may be placed each
year
To start with, we will review models with each of the constraints taken individ-
ually. Later in this chapter, we will discuss models where inventory decisions are
subject to more than one of these constraints.
7.2
Budget Constraint
Consider an inventory system with n items. Let B be the maximum amount of
money that can be invested in stock. If Qj is the optimal order size, Coj is the
ordering cost, Dj is the annual demand, i is the inventory carrying rate per year, and
Cj is the unit cost for the jth item in the system, the problem can be mathematically
formulated as follows:

constraint model with a numerical example.
Solved Problem 7.1
Inventory parameters for three products – A, B, and C – sold by a retailer are shown
in Table 7.3. The retailer uses an inventory carrying rate of 25% per annum. What
would be the economic lot size if the retailer does not want to invest more than
$10,000 in the average inventory of these three products?
Solution
Using the standard EOQ formula (Eq. 3.8) we derived in Chap. 3, we can determine
the EOQs for the three products:

It is noticed that the investment in average inventory violates the speciﬁed

With the revised EOQs, the investment in average inventory satisﬁes the spec-

Multi-item Inventory Models Subject to Constraints

Solution
The initial EOQs are 69, 65, and 82 units (see solution to Solved Problem 7.1),
respectively, and the average investment in inventory is $11,125 which violates the
budgetary constraint. If proportionality condition is assumed, then we have a simple
solution on hand. We do not need to compute the Lagrangean factor. Instead, we
would need to determine the multiplier, m, which is given by Eq. 7.9:
m ¼

and

j¼1
EOQjCj ¼ $11; 125. Therefore, we get
m ¼ 10000
11125 ¼ 0:899
Multiplying the initial EOQs with m, we get
QA ¼ 0:899  69 ¼ 62 units
QB ¼ 0:899  65 ¼ 58 units
QC ¼ 0:899  82 ¼ 74 units
It is noticed that the solution obtained for this problem is the same as what we
obtained in Solved Problem 7.1.
7.3
Space Constraint
Another common constraint ﬁrms face is that of storage space. The EOQs (or the Q)
computed for a given problem may be huge, and the ﬁrm may not have sufﬁcient
space to store all the procured items. We need to determine Q for each of the items
such that they are not only optimal but also feasible.
Consider an inventory system with n items. Let S be the maximum amount of
space that is available to stock the items. If Qj is the optimal order size, Coj is the
ordering cost, Dj is the annual demand, i is the inventory carrying rate per year, and
Cj is the unit cost for the jth item in the system, the problem can be formulated as
follows:

Solved Problem 7.3
Gaudi is a retailer for overhead water tanks that are available in three different
capacities – 2000 liters, 3000 liters, and 4000 liters. Table 7.4 shows the inventory
parameters of these water tanks. If Gaudi has a space limitation of 3500 cubic feet
in their showroom, determine the optimal order quantities for these water tank
models that will satisfy the space constraint.

To start with, we use Eq. 3.8 we derived in Chap. 3 to determine the EOQs for the
three models of water tanks:

Notice that the space required by these lot sizes violates the space constraint of

to determine the feasible order quantities. Because θ is unknown, we need to use
trial and error to compute the feasible lot sizes that satisfy the space constraint. One
method would be to compute the lower and upper bound values for θ. The lower and
upper bound values can be found by assuming proportional ratios. In other words,
we ﬁrst ﬁnd m, using Eq. 7.15, which is

The least value is 0.209 and the highest is 0.298. These are the lower and upper

the Q values that also satisfy the space constraint. Table 7.5 shows the Q values for
different values of θ.

and the average space requirement is 3496 cubic feet which satisﬁes the speciﬁed
space constraint of 3500 cubic feet.
Another method to determine θ would be to use the GOAL SEEK function
available in MS Excel. The procedure to use this function is explained in
Appendix 7A.

Determine the optimal and feasible order quantities for the following two products

to ﬁrst compute the lower and upper bound values for θ. The lower and upper bound

We use this multiplier to obtain new EOQs, which are

The next step is to use these EOQs to determine θ values using Eq. 7.13, which
are as follows:
θx ¼ 0:534
θy ¼ 0:171
These are the lower and upper bound values for θ. We can now use different
values of θ between 0.534 and 0.171 to determine the Q values that also satisfy the
space constraint. Table 7.7 shows the Q values for different values of θ.
It is noticed that for θ ¼ 0.2113, the values of Q for the two products satisfy the
space requirements. The optimal Q values are 410 and 476, respectively, and the
average space requirement is 39,996 cubic feet which satisﬁes the speciﬁed space
constraint of 40,000 cubic feet.

Let us consider an inventory system with n items. The total ordering cost would
depend on the number of orders being placed. To reduce the ordering cost, one may
want to place orders a limited number of times. Let N be the maximum number of
orders that can be placed. If Qj is the optimal order size, Coj is the ordering cost, Dj
is the annual demand, i is the inventory carrying rate per year, and Cj is the unit cost
for the jth item in the system, the problem can be formulated as follows:

The objective function measures the total inventory costs while the term in the
constraint measures the number of orders placed. If the constraint is satisﬁed by
individual optimal order quantities, we not only have the individual optimal
Q values but also those that are feasible Q values. However, when the constraint
is not satisﬁed the individual Q values obtained are infeasible, and we rewrite the
constraint by replacing the inequality as

Just like in the previous section, we introduce a Lagrangean multiplier, θ, to

This is greater than the restriction of 20 orders per year. We can use Eq. 7.19 to
compute the Lagrangean multiplier, θ, which in this case is 213.4. Substituting this,
we can determine the optimal value of lot sizes by substituting the value of θ in
Eq. 7.17, as follows:

The optimal values are 166, 227, and 339 units for products A, B, and C,

Eq. 7.17, we can determine the optimal value of lot sizes, as follows:

that satisﬁes both the constraints. It is important that the constraints in a problem are
not opposing each other. Let us consider the following scenarios for a given
inventory problem.
7.5.1
Budgetary and Number of Orders Constraint
Consider a problem which is subject to both a budgetary constraint as well as
number of orders constraint. Solution to the budgetary constraint (∑QC) will
attempt to reduce the lot sizes, while the same for number of orders constraint
D

 
will try to increase the lot sizes. Thus, it becomes difﬁcult to obtain a solution
that satisﬁes both constraints. In such situations, it is best to satisfy the most
important constraint rather than both.
7.5.2
Space and Number of Orders Constraint
Consider a case where we have both space constraint as well as number of orders
constraint. While the solution to a space constraint will try to reduce the lot sizes,
the number of orders constraint will try to increase the lot sizes. It is difﬁcult to ﬁnd
a feasible solution that satisﬁes both. Again, in this situation, we need to attempt to
obtain a solution to the most important constraint.
7.5.3
Budgetary and Space Constraint
Let us now consider a problem that is subject to budgetary as well as space
constraint. Solution to the budgetary constraint (∑QC) will attempt to reduce the
lot sizes. The solution to a space constraint will also try to reduce the lot sizes. Thus,
it is easy to obtain a solution that satisﬁes both constraints.
Solved Problem 7.7
Inventory parameters for three products are as shown in Table 7.10. Determine
the optimal lot sizes for these products that are subject to the following constraints:
•
Average value of inventory held must not exceed $8000.
•
Space occupied by the stock must not exceed 6000 cubic feet.

Let us ﬁrst solve the problem for the inventory restriction. The initial EOQ values

Notice that the investment in inventory violates the speciﬁed budget constraint

Eq. 7.5, we get θ ¼ 0.072. By substituting the value of θ in Eq. 7.2, we can now
compute the revised EOQ values. We get

Multi-item Inventory Models Subject to Constraints

We now notice that the investment in inventory satisﬁes the speciﬁed budgetary
constraint. Therefore, the economic and feasible lot sizes for products A, B, and C
are 40, 59, and 121 units, respectively. Next, we solve the problem for the space
constraint. The space requirement for the above lot sizes is.

The lot sizes we determined do not satisfy the space constraint. We therefore
need to ﬁnd the value of θ that would help us compute the optimal and feasible lot
sizes. We need to use trial and error values for θ from Eq. 7.9 to compute the
feasible lot sizes that satisfy the space constraint. Table 7.11 shows the values of lot
sizes for different values of θ.
We can see from Table 7.6 that the space constraint is met for θ ¼ 0.0131. The lot
sizes corresponding to this value are 40, 59, and 118 units for products A, B, and C,
respectively. These lot sizes meet both the budgetary as well as space constraints.
7.6
Coordinated Replenishment
Considering the fact that inventory decisions on items in a system interact with each
other, another topic of interest to inventory managers is that of coordinated replen-
ishment, also referred to as joint ordering. When many items are ordered from the
same supplier, or when items share the same mode of transportation, it makes
economic sense to coordinate their replenishment. By ordering many items jointly
in one order, managers can take advantage of economies of scale and can help
reduce the overall inventory costs (Silver et al. 1998; Vrat 2014).

Costs in Coordinated Replenishment

•
A ﬁxed cost of ordering an item. This cost is independent of the number of items
being procured. This cost is represented by Co.
•
A shared cost, that is, if two items that are ordered jointly are shipped together,
then these two items share the cost of transportation. This cost is represented by
Ct. (This can also be considered as the cost of adding a line to an order, while
raising an order.)
7.6.2
Assumptions
Following are some of the assumptions made in the treatment of this problem:
•
There are no resource constraints.
•
A ﬁxed ordering cost, Co, is incurred every time an order is placed for an item.
There is an additional cost, Ct, for every order. This could be the transportation
cost, for example. If, therefore, only one item is ordered, the total ordering cost
would be Co + Ct.
•
Demand for the items is deterministic
•
All items have the same order frequency and are received together.
•
The unit cost for each item is not dependent on the quantity ordered. In other
words, no quantity discounts are offered.
Let us consider an inventory system with n items. Co is the ordering cost per
order. If the supplier decides to ﬁll the order by sending all n items together, then
the total cost of transportation, Ct, is shared by these n items. The total cost of the
order is therefore
nCo þ Ct
ð7:20Þ
If the demand for the jth item is Dj and the order quantity is Qj, the total number
of orders to be placed, k, would be

Eq. 7.24 indicates the number of orders that needs to be placed to minimize the
total inventory costs. We will now demonstrate the application of this theory with a
numerical problem.
Solved Problem 7.8
Table 7.12 shows the inventory parameters for raw materials that a retail ﬁrm
sources from its local supplier. Until recently, the ﬁrm was ordering raw materials
separately. However, it has now decided to place a joint order so that all raw
materials arrive together. The ﬁxed cost per order is $10 for each item. If the ﬁrm
incurs a transportation cost of $500, compute the optimal number of orders that
needs to be placed to minimize the total inventory costs. Also compute the savings
if the ﬁrm was ordering separately.

joint ordering of the three raw materials. To start with, we compute the numerator,

Coordinated Replenishments: Unequal Number
of Orders
One of the assumptions made while deriving the equation for coordinated replen-
ishment was that the number of orders placed for all items is the same. This means
that all items are ordered together, a situation that may not ﬁnd many real-life
applications. This assumption can be relaxed; however, in such a case, we must ﬁnd

Summary
In this chapter, we discussed methods of managing inventory of multiple items that
are subject to one or more resource constraints. One key takeaway from this chapter
is that when the ratio of unit cost of an item (or space consumed by an item) to the
carrying cost is constant, a simple solution in the form of a multiplier can be
adopted. However, when the assumption is not met, a Lagrangean multiplier
(factor) would need to be determined, in some cases by trial and error, to obtain
an optimal and feasible economic lot size solution.
We also reviewed methods to solve problems that are subject to more than one
constraint. A feasible solution is possible only when revisions made to lot size for
both constraints move the decision variable in the same direction.

Hector is a Vice President – Procurements, with FreskoJugo, a company in Hous-

understand the inventory costs when Fernanda, his secretary walks in.
“Jerry and Tim from Fruit-o-Vision are here to see you. They have an appointment with
you,” announces Fernanda.
“Oh yes, please send them in,” says Hector.
Two people walk in to Hector’s ofﬁce.
“I am Jerry,” says Jerry, introducing himself to Hector, “and this is my colleague Tim.
We are from Fruit-o-Vision,” adds Jerry.
“We supply fresh fruits to food product manufacturers like yours. We have our own
orchards in the Silao and Queretaro in central part of Mexico, and we grow 15 different
varieties of fruits including peaches, grapes, mango, avocado, bananas, pineapple, straw-
berry, green apples, mandarins and several others,” says Jerry.
“We do not use any chemicals in our orchards. We use organic manure,” Tim inter-
venes. “We are carrying some samples of our fresh produce which you may want to see.”

Tim then shows samples of the fruits grown in their orchard.
“We know your ﬁrm is always looking at enlisting fresh fruit suppliers, and we would

“I am impressed with the samples. I am going to get our tasters let me know what they
are like,” says Hector.
Continuing the discussion, Hector says “I have heard of your orchards but our existing
suppliers have been working with us for the last 15 years, and they have been doing a good
job for us.”
“We source mangoes from Tijuana while we get our supplies of grapes from California,
and mandarins from Monterrey,” adds Hector.
“One thing I must point out you is that we supply all the fruits,” says Jerry, emphasizing
on the all bit. “This would be a great advantage for you to lower your ordering costs if your
ﬁrm can place coordinated orders,” Jerry adds.
“Hmm. that sounds interesting. I have a meeting with our President later today, and I
will discuss this with him and then let us see things pan out. I certainly will keep in touch
with you guys, and thanks for visiting FreskoJugo,” says Hector as Jerry and Tim prepare to
take leave of Hector.
Later that day, Hector is attending a high-level meeting chaired by Issac, the company
President.
Addressing the attendees of the meeting, Issac says “I want all of you to focus your
attention on this section of our balance sheet under Current Assets. Our inventory –
including raw materials, work-in-progress and ﬁnished goods – has increased more than
15% over the last year.”
“This reﬂects the amount of money locked up in inventories. Some ﬁnancial analysts
may say this is good since the inventory is an asset. But in my opinion we need to control
it.”
“While too little inventory can result in lost sales, too much inventory can impact our
cash ﬂow problems. With the price of diesel going up each month we can be sure our
inventories will deﬁnitely increase.”
Finishing his presentation, Issac adds “I want each one of you to start thinking about
how we could reduce our inventory cost, without impacting our sales, of course.”
Hector intervenes “Issac, one of our problems is with our procurement policy. We
procure fruits from different vendors – 5 vendors for 5 fruits, and the ﬁxed cost of ordering
per order is $40, and it costs us another $80 in shipment. In all $120 per order.”
“But what has that got to do with the increase in our inventory costs?”asks Issac.
“The transportation cost is huge, and if we are able to procure all our input materials
from one vendor, we would be able to save on our ordering costs using the concept of joint
replenishment,” argues Hector.
“But that would mean we put all our eggs in the same basket,” states Amy, Risk
Manager at FreskoJugo.
“Yes, I agree, Amy, there are risks, but we need to analyze if the savings in coordinated
orders outweigh those risks,” retorts Hector.
“So, Hector and Amy, why don’t you both analyze the coordinated supply scenario and
let us know next week what savings it would bring us?” asks Issac.
“Will do Issac,” says Hector as he prepares to leave the conference room.

Case Study Questions
1. Given the information, compute the cost savings if FreskoJugo places a joint
order for all the ﬁve items with one supplier, over procuring the same ﬁve fruits
separately. Assume equal number of orders.
2. Discuss the risks involved in placing orders with one vendor for all their
supplies.

Practice Problems
Problem 7.1
A retailer sells three products – A, B, and C – details of which are shown in
Table 7.13. Assume a carrying rate of 30% per year.
What would be the economic lot size if the retailer does not want to invest more
than $10,000 in these three products at one time?
What would be the lot size if you assume the ratio of unit cost of the product to
its carrying cost is constant?
Answer:
The feasible EOQs that satisfy the budget constraint are 137, 213, and 675 units.
The multiplier is 0.624, and θ is 0.468.
Problem 7.2
Table 7.14 shows the inventory parameters of three products that are sold by a retail
ﬁrm.
What would be the economic lot size if the ﬁrm has a storage constraint of
18,000 cubic feet?
Answer
The feasible EOQs that satisfy the space constraint are 216, 327, and 910 units. θ is
0.0409.

Problem 7.3
Table 7.15 shows the inventory parameters of three products that are sold by a retail
ﬁrm. The senior management of the ﬁrm is concerned about high ordering costs,
and in order to contain it has imposed a restriction on the number of orders to 12 per
year. Compute the optimal and feasible order quantities if the ordering cost is $50
per order.
Answer
The feasible EOQs that satisfy the number of orders constraint are 93, 130, and
163 units.
Problem 7.4
A fruit vendor sells three types of fruits – strawberry, mango, and pineapple,
stocking parameters of which are as shown in Table 7.16. Determine the optimal
lot sizes for these fruits that are subject to the following constraints:
•
Average value of inventory held must not exceed $1600.
•
Space occupied by the stock must not exceed 60 cubic feet.
Answer
The EOQs are 21, 24, and 33 units that meet both the budget and space constraints.
Appendix 7A: Using GOAL SEEK to Determine Lagrangean
Multiplier
An easier method to ﬁnd θ, the Lagrangean multiplier, is to use the GOAL SEEK
function in MS Excel. The procedure for (explained with reference to space
constraint, with three products) this is as follows. Set up an excel spreadsheet
with the columns as shown in Fig. 7.1.

Selective Inventory Control Models
8.1
Need for Selective Inventory Control
Monitoring and controlling of inventory items is very expensive. In a
multiproduct inventory system, all items held in stock are not equally prof-
itable. An item with a purchase price of $200 may be considered high-value,
but may be used sparingly. The purchase price of another item may be $0.50,
which is considered relatively low-value. However, this item may be used in
large quantities. Table 8.2 shows a sample of 16 items used by Rosetta’s.
Which of items would the inventory manager focus on more?
In this chapter, we address multi-item inventory situation which allows
inventory managers to focus more on high-value, high-usage items than on
all items equally.
Inventory managers managing large number of items would need a better
method of management. It is important that the inventory managers focus more
on controlling high-value, high-usage items than on all items equally. Several
techniques have been used by inventory managers, and almost all of these tech-
niques classify items held in inventory into three or more categories. This enables
inventory managers apply requisite control that is justiﬁed for each class of items.
Some of the popular techniques used in practice include:
•
ABC classiﬁcation
•
VED classiﬁcation
•
FSN classiﬁcation
Each of the above is discussed in some detail in this chapter.

8.2
ABC Classiﬁcation1
ABC classiﬁcation is a technique that helps inventory managers perform selective
inventory control by focusing on high-value, high-usage items than other items in
the inventory system. This technique is based on Pareto’s theory, which when
adapted to inventory management can be summarized as follows:
20% of the items in an inventory system account for 80% of dollar-volume
sales, the next 30% account for 15% of dollar-volume sales, while the last
50% of the items account for 5% of dollar-volume sales.
Many organizations use the ABC classiﬁcation technique to manage their
inventory – exercise tight control over a small number (usually up to 20% of
items in stock) of high-value items, moderate control over a larger number (about
30% of items in stock) of moderately expensive items, and simple control over a
very large number of items (about 50% of items in stock) of low-value items
(Table 8.1).
Table 8.2 shows items at Rosetta’s, along with unit price and annual demand. Let
us use the ABC analysis to determine the level of control the inventory manager
needs to apply for each of these items.
The ﬁrst step in ABC analysis is to compute the annual usage value for each of
the items. This can be obtained by multiplying the unit price of the item with its
annual demand. This is shown Table 8.3.
The next step is to rank-order the items based on their annual usage value, in
descending order. Table 8.4 below shows the rank-ordered items.
Figure 8.1 shows the ABC classiﬁcation chart. Note that 3 out of 16 items
(approximately 19% of items) – corn ﬂour, cooking gas, and vegetable oil –
contribute to roughly 80% of the inventory usage value. The next ﬁve items
(close to 30% of the items) – cornmeal additive, cashew nut paste, vanilla essence,
butter, and liqueur – contribute to roughly about 15% of the inventory value. The
last eight items (or 50% of the items) contribute to the remaining 5% of the
inventory usage value.

Selective Inventory Control Models

ABC classiﬁcation method is probably the simplest of the selective inventory
control methods to implement and use. A great advantage of this method is that it
allows inventory managers to manage their review time wisely – they are able to
spend more effort monitoring items that have the biggest impact on the cost and
usage, and therefore, using this method would enable managers apply closer and

stricter control over expensive and high-usage (fast-moving) items, rather than all
items equally. However, this method does have some limitations:
•
The purchase price of the item can ﬂuctuate (for e.g., gasoline), and if this
happens often the ABC analysis will be required to be updated frequently
making the system quite nervous.

Selective Inventory Control Models

•
An item held in stock may not be very expensive but may be very critical to the
functioning of the organization operations. However, the ABC analysis does not
give any importance to the criticality. It only considers the annual usage value.
Later in this chapter we discuss other methods of classiﬁcation.
Solved Problem 8.1
Table 8.5 lists 10 items sold at a retail shop. Classify each of these items into A, B,
or C categories.
Solution
Let us ﬁrst compute the annual usage value for each of the items. This can be
obtained for each item by multiplying the proﬁt per unit of the item with its annual
sales. This is shown in Table 8.6.

Next, we rank-order the items based on their annual usage value (descending
order). Table 8.7 shows the rank-ordered items. The top two items (24% of
items) can be categorized as A class, the next three items (36% of items) as B
class, and the remaining seven items as C class. Figure 8.2 shows the ABC chart for

Exchange Curves
Exchange curves can be developed by inventory managers when cost data are
unreliable or unavailable (Silver et al. 1998; Nahmias 2005). These curves can be
used for easier and efﬁcient management of multi-item inventory systems. An
exchange curve is a hyperbola that shows the relationship between the value of
items held in inventory and the number of replenishments per year. Consider a
multi-item deterministic system that has n items. If the EOQ concept is used to
manage orders for each of these items, then

If we use the ratio of the ordering cost to interest rate as a policy parameter, we
can generate an exchange curve that shows the relationship between the number of
orders and the total value of items. Table 8.8 illustrates a sample calculation for an
order cost to interest rate ratio of 266.67 (Co ¼ $80 and i ¼ 30 % ).
The total number of orders in this case works out to 148, while the total value of
items held in inventory is $39,517. Inventory managers can obtain an exchange
curve by computing the number of orders and total inventory value for different
values of Co
i , as shown in Fig. 8.3.
Let us now apply the concept of exchange curve to Rosetta’s case. We know that
Rosetta’s is currently operating with an ordering cost of $80 per order and an
inventory carrying rate of 30% per year. The ratio of ordering cost to inventory
carrying rate is 266.67. For this ratio, the number of orders is 148 and the total

Selective Inventory Control Models

inventory value is $39,517, as shown in Table 8.5. Let us suppose that Rosetta’s is
not comfortable with the total value of inventory and wants to reduce it to, say,
$25,000. Rosetta’s can accomplish this by reducing the ratio of
Co
i
to 106.67
(ordering cost is $32, and inventory carrying rate is 30%). From the exchange
curve (Fig. 8.3), we can notice that for this ratio the total value of inventory reduces
to around $25,000, while the number of orders increases to 234. In other words,
Rosetta’s is able to save 37% of the costs but will need to increase the number of
orders from 148 to 234. Rosetta’s will now have to decide if the cost savings of
$14,517 is worth the effort required to place additional 86 orders. This way
Rosetta’s would be able to use the exchange curve and decide on a ratio they are
comfortable with, as well as conﬁrm the ordering costs and the carrying rate, which
are usually difﬁcult to estimate.
8.4
VED Classiﬁcation
VED classiﬁcation method categorizes items held in inventory into three classes –
vital, essential, and desirable – on the basis of criticality of an item (Vrat 2014).
This technique requires an inventory manager to categorize an item based on its
criticality. A simple way to assign a criticality rating to an item would be to estimate
the loss of production if the said item is required but not available in stock. Higher
the production loss, the higher is the criticality rating of the item. Using this policy,
items that are categorized vital must be available on hand when a need arises.
Nonavailability of these items will result in signiﬁcant production losses that must
be avoided at any cost. Essential items are those that should be in stock when

8.4
VED Classiﬁcation

needed. Nonavailability of these items when required would result in production
losses but not as signiﬁcant as those like the vital category items. Desirable items
are those that are good to have in the inventory and those that result in not-so-
signiﬁcant production losses when not available. While originally designed to
manage maintenance inventories and spare parts, this technique of classiﬁcation
can be used to manage other types of resources as well.
Criticality of an item can be assessed on one or more factors, rather than just
unavailability. Chitale and Gupta (2014) suggest that inventory managers may use a
set of risk factors, including unavailability, that form the basis of estimating an
item’s criticality. Examples of these risk factors may include the following:
•
Procurement lead time: Items with shorter lead times would be less critical while
those with longer lead times would be more critical.
•
Supplier: Items that are supplied locally would be less critical while those
supplied by international sources would be more critical.
•
Amount of customization: An item that is highly customized would be consid-
ered more critical than one that is highly standardized.
•
Unavailability: An item that may not be available when needed may result in
loss of production, and hence loss of revenue.
Tables 8.9 and 8.10 show the risk factors and the categorization criteria that form
the basis for estimating an item’s criticality.
An organization using VED to manage its inventory would have a larger stock of
V class items and a relatively smaller stock of D class items. Let us consider a
sample of the items from Rosetta’s as shown in Table 8.11.
Let us now use the VED technique to classify these sample items into V, E, and
D using information available. Consider the ﬁrst item – vegetable oil. The lead time
for this item is 3 days, the supplier is based locally, and there is no product
customization (i.e., the product is purchased as is off the shelf). Each of these
factors would be rated low (1 point). However, if the item is unavailable, it would

cause signiﬁcant production losses and therefore we assign a high rating to
unavailability risk factor (3 points). In all, this item is assigned a rating of 6 points.
Looking up Table 8.10, we can see that items with a score of 4–6 are categorized as
desirable. Table 8.12 shows the categorization plans for the sample of items.
8.5
FSN Analysis
This technique of selective inventory control classiﬁes materials into three catego-
ries – fast-moving, slow-moving, and nonmoving – based on their consumption
pattern or rate of movement. Items that are regularly consumed are classiﬁed as
fast-moving, while those items that have never been consumed even once but are
still maintained in the inventory are classiﬁed as nonmoving. Rest of the items are
classiﬁed as slow-moving. This technique has been more popular in the manage-
ment of spare parts and maintenance resources.
8.6
Other Selective Inventory Control Techniques
Several models exist in literature that combine two or more of these selective
inventory control techniques for better classiﬁcation and management of inventory
items. Inventory managers have used, for example, a combination of ABC and VED
to have tighter control. Using these two techniques together, inventory managers
would be able to create nine groups of items including A–V class of items (items
that have high usage value and are also vital for production) and the C–D class of
items (items that have low usage value and are of type-desirable). This is shown in
Fig. 8.4. Interested readers may review works of Chitale and Gupta (2014),
Gopalakrishnan (2001), and Vrat (2014) for more information on these models.

Selective Inventory Control Models

8.7
Summary
Organizations hold several thousands of items in their inventory. If managers in
these organizations use single item models, then all items, irrespective of their
usage or criticality, would need to be treated the same way. This would not be a
very efﬁcient. In this chapter, we reviewed selective inventory control methods to
manage inventory, those that require managers to focus their effort more on items
that are key to the organization, and applying lesser control on other items. We
reviewed popular selective inventory control methods such as ABC analysis, VED
analysis, and FSN analysis. Each of these methods classiﬁes inventory items into
three groups based on item attributes. A hybrid method – combining the ABC and the
VED techniques – was also discussed. In addition to these techniques we also
reviewed an important multi-item inventory management technique that has EOQs
as its basis – the exchange curve. We discussed how the exchange curves can help
inventory managers identify an appropriate ratio of ordering cost to inventory carry-
ing rate that can achieve a management-desired level (constraint) of inventory value.

Case Study: Exchange Curves for Multi-item
Management
Fernando has a retail shop in the outskirts of Guadalajara, where he sells ﬁve
different type of grains – maize, white rice, brown rice, wheat, and horse gram.
Ten years ago he dropped out of school and started assisting his father run the
shop. He took total ownership when his father fell sick. He now makes all
inventory decisions – when to place and order, how big must the replenishment
be, etc. – exactly like his father.

One ﬁne day Fernando has a visitor to his shop. Manuel, his schoolmate, now a
ﬁnal year undergraduate student in Industrial Engineering at the local university,
visits him to enquire his well-being. During their meeting, Manuel tells Fernando
how excited he is about inventory management concepts he has learnt at the
university, and he is looking at executing a real-life project as part of his under-
graduate studies.
“You can use any data from my retail shop. What do you need to execute this project of
yours?”, asks Fernando.
“All I need is the demand data and the unit price,” says Manuel “and yes, it would help if
you can also supply me your carrying and ordering costs,” adds Manuel.
Fernando tells Manuel that he has analyzed the demand pattern for the grains he sells,
for the last 3 years, and he is convinced that the demand is steady and constant all through
the year. Maize is his fastest selling item. He sells 4500 kg of it every year. The two
different varieties of rice – white rice and brown rice – sell 1500 kg and 1000 kg annually.
Wheat and horse gram are his slower selling items – he sells 750 kg of wheat and 250 kg of
horse gram each year.
“I am sure I have been able to optimize inventory policy for each individual items,” says
Fernando. “I make the decision on how much to order and when based on what I have on
stock. I order the same amount every time I place a procurement order,” he adds.
“I will let you know exactly how much and when, when we meet tomorrow,” says
Fernando to Manuel, as they agree to meet once again the next day to decide on the way
forward.
The next day Fernando hands over a note to Manuel which has the unit price and
the order size for each of the items sold by him.

Case Study Questions
(a) Create a spreadsheet solution for Fernando that indicates the current point of
operations.
(b) Determine the optimal order quantity and number of orders.
Solution
We will use MS Excel to solve the problem. Create a matrix using data supplied by
the retailer. This is as shown in Table 8.13. It has eight columns – item name,
annual demand, item cost, and current order quantity.
Step 1: Add four new columns to the table, and name those columns as follows –
total value, number of orders, implied ratio of order to carrying rate. Compute the
total value of inventory for each of the items. This can be determined using Eq. 8.3.
For example, consider item A. The total value for this item is
224

QC
2 ¼ 150  20

¼ 1500
Also, compute the sum of the total value of the ﬁve items. As shown in
Table 8.13, the sum of the total value of items in inventory system is $11462.5
Step 2: Determine the number of orders. We may use Eq. 8.2 to obtain the number
of orders for each of the items. For example, the demand for item A is 1500 units
and its current order quantity is 150. The number of orders, therefore, is
D
Q ¼ 1500
150 ¼ 10
Step 3: Compute the implied ratio of ordering cost to the carrying interest rate. This
can be computed using the standard EOQ formula. Also, compute
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
DjCj

for
each item.
Step 4: Compute new EOQ values for each of the items using different values of
implied ratio. This computation is shown in Table 8.14 under columns EOQs.
Equation 8.6 can be used to compute N while Eq. 8.5 can be used to compute TV.
Step 5: Recalculate N for each of the items, using the new EOQ values. This is
shown under columns sufﬁxed N (last ﬁve columns).
Copy contents (including formulae) from two rows and paste it as shown in
Fig. 8.5. These two rows would be used for the GOAL SEEK function (See Strakos
2016). Use GOAL SEEK on the ﬁrst row to ﬁnd N for the current value of TV
($11,463, see Table 8.15) and by varying the implied ratio (see Fig. 8.5).
Using the second row, you can ﬁnd the value of TV by using the new value of
N and varying the value of implied ratio. Results of GOAL SEEK are shown in
Table 8.15. The exchange curve with the current operating point is shown in
Fig. 8.6.

Introduction
Corn tortillas are sold to retail customers through their only sales outlet,
managed by Maria Fernanda. Tortillas are sold in packs of 10. Each pack of
10 costs $10, and they sell it to customers at $25. Because they do not add any
preservatives, the shelf life of a pack of tortilla is 1 day (24 h). Maria accepts a
predetermined number of corn-ﬂavored tortilla packs each morning at
7:00 am when the sales outlet opens. At 11:00 pm when outlet closes, she
discards all the unsold packs. She also informs the kitchen manager the
number of packs she would need the next morning. One of her key perfor-
mance indicator (KPI) is to minimize the losses due to unsold inventory, and
for this she relies on historical data. Maria must know how many packets she
would need at the beginning of the day, each day.
Maria does not like wasting food. Nobody does. She has approached a
food processing unit in Leo´n that reprocesses food items. The reprocessing
unit has agreed to buy unsold packets of tortillas from Rosetta’s at $5 per
packet. Maria would now have to analyze the new situation and decide on the
number of packets she would need each morning when the outlet opens
for sale.
In this chapter, we determine order quantity of items that have a ﬁnite
shelf life.
Perishable items and style goods inventory are important classes of inventory
problem. In all of the models discussed earlier in this book we assumed that the item
being procured had an inﬁnite lifetime, and is sold over indeﬁnite periods of time.
However, in reality, at some point in its lifetime, the utility value of items drops to

zero (Nahmias 2005). There are no takers for those items thereafter. Examples of
this class of inventory items include fashion products, food products such as milk
and processed meat, bottles of whole blood, airline tickets for a speciﬁc ﬂight,
tickets for a speciﬁc soccer match, a daily newspaper, etc. Table 9.1 shows probable
lifetime of some of the items.
There are other models that are based on the utility value of an item (or a
group of items) during its lifetime. These include:
(a) Decaying inventory items
(b) Obsolete inventory items
The following is a brief description of the differences between the perishable
inventory items being discussed in this chapter, and others that belong to a
similar category.
Decaying Inventory Items
In this category of inventory problems, a small percentage of items held in the
inventory system is lost due to damage or decay. Decay can be at a constant
rate or at an exponential rate. An example of this would include the produce
that a local vegetable vendor procures from a wholesaler. During transporta-
tion, or in storage, a small amount of the procured items may get damaged and
would not be saleable.
Obsolete Inventory Items
An example of this would be an electronic item (such as a new version of a
tablet computer) that has just arrived in the market. The value of such items is
usually big at the beginning of the selling period but reduces rapidly once an
enhanced version of the item is about to be introduced in the market.
Depending on their lifetime, perishable items can be categorized into two – those
with ﬁxed lifetime and those with stochastic (random) lifetime (Fig. 9.1). Items
with ﬁxed lifetime have a constant utility value over a ﬁxed period of time.

Inventory Models for Perishable Items and Style Goods

Examples of this would be a daily newspaper or a unit of blood stored in a blood
bank. Items with random lifetime are those whose lifetime reduces throughout their
lifetime. Examples of this would include drugs (medicines), fruits, vegetables, etc.
The scope of this chapter is the ﬁrst category of
items where the utility value
remains constant throughout their lifetime and drops to zero at some point in time.
Mathematical complexity involved in modeling this class of problems is very
high. Therefore, we will discuss only basic inventory models in this class. Interested
readers may refer to the work by Nahmias (2011) for a complete review of models
involving items with random lifetime.

Perishable Items: Deterministic Demand
If the demand is deterministic, the EOQ formula (Chap. 3) may be used to
determine the optimal order quantity. The cycle time between the placement of
orders is
T ¼ Q
D
Nahmias (2011) has argued that if the perishable item under consideration has a
useful lifetime of t, then there are two cases that need to be analyzed:
(a) T  t, and
(b) T > t
In the ﬁrst case, all the units would be consumed by the demand in time T before
the item perishes. However, small modiﬁcation would need to be made for the

second case since at the end of the cycle time there would be a few unsold units that
would perish. The quantity to be ordered, Q, would need to be amended to
Q ¼ Dt
9.3
Single Period Inventory Model with Stochastic Demand
A single period inventory model is one where one order of an appropriate size is
placed for an item at the beginning of the period. At the end of the period, the stock
of items is either completely sold off or any remaining items would need to be
disposed off, some of which may have a salvage value. A single period inventory
model, therefore, is apt to manage perishable items and style goods (Silver et al.
1998; Anderson et al. 2016). The decision variable in single period inventory model
is the size of the order.
9.3.1
Assumptions
Following assumptions have been made to model inventory management of per-
ishable items and style goods:
•
The model is meant for a single item that has a ﬁnite lifetime.
•
The item cannot be sold after its life is complete. However, in some circum-
stances, there is possibility of salvaging some value from the expiring item.
•
Beginning inventory is zero. Toward the end of this chapter, we also discuss
solutions involving a positive beginning inventory.
•
While the demand is a random variable and is not known with certainty, the
probability distribution of the demand is known.
•
Shortages are not back-ordered.
•
No ordering cost is incurred.
9.3.2
Relevant Costs
The objective of the single period inventory model is to balance two costs – cost of
underage and cost of overage – which are deﬁned as follows (Anderson et al. 2016):
•
Cost of underage, Cu, is the cost per unit of underestimating demand. This cost
represents the opportunity loss of not ordering one additional unit and ﬁnding
that it could have been sold.
•
Cost of overage, Cv, is the cost per unit of overestimating demand. This cost
represents the loss of ordering one additional unit and ﬁnding that it cannot
be sold.

Inventory Models for Perishable Items and Style Goods

Let us assume that Q units have been purchased in a given period. If p is the
probability of selling Q units, then (1  p) is the probability of selling less than
Q units. If the demand, D, is greater than Q units, then underage cost is incurred,
that is, an additional unit (or additional units) could have been sold. The expected
value of this loss is given as
¼ Cu  p D>Q

ð9:1Þ
If the demand, D, is less than Q units, then an overage cost is incurred. The
expected value of this cost is given as
¼ Cv  p DQ

Because there are only two possibilities, either D  Q or D > Q, the sum of their
probabilities is 1. In other words,

Consider a ﬁxed life item that costs $100 and sells at $150. Every unit sold
makes a proﬁt of $50. Let us assume we underordered and there is a lost sale. Cost
of underage is the lost proﬁt, that is, the difference between the revenue and the
cost, which in this case is $150  $100 ¼ $50. Let us further assume that unsold
9.3

items can be sold in a clearance sale and we can salvage $80 for the item. The cost
of overage would be increase in proﬁt we would have enjoyed had we ordered one
unit less, which is the difference between the cost and the salvage value, in this case
$100 – $80 ¼ $20. Using Eq. 9.6a, we get (Shefﬁ2010)

or
Cr ¼

Let us now consider a slightly different situation – that of a maintenance store. A
maintenance store stocks spare parts for equipment used in production processes.
The primary objective of a maintenance store is to minimize costs, including
production losses caused due to nonavailability of a spare part. In the event of a
stockout, the store manager must order a spare from the original equipment
manufacturer (OEM). When production losses are signiﬁcant, the store manager
may have to get the spare airlifted. The cost of doing this, also referred to as cost of
resupply, would be very high. A summary of all the costs involved is as follows:
•
Cost of a spare
•
Cost of holding an unused spare in inventory
•
Cost of resupplying a required spare part
The critical ratio in this situation can be stated as
Cr ¼
Resupply Cost  Cost of spare
Resupply Cost þ Cost of holding unused spare
ð9:8Þ
Depending on the situation, either of Eq. 9.6a, Eq. 9.7a, or Eq. 9.8 may be used to
determine the critical ratio. In the following sections, we discuss application of the
critical ratio concept to a variety of problems involving known probability
distributions.
A Note on Style Goods
Style goods are also characterized by short (duration) selling period and
limited replenishment opportunities and salvage. In some sort, style goods
and fashion products may also be treated as perishable items. In this book, we
use the single period inventory model to solve style goods problem as well.

9.3.3
Case of Normally Distributed Demand
Let us go back to our running example of Rosetta’s. The front ofﬁce manager at
Rosetta’s has to place an order for a certain number of tortilla packets each day for
sale through their retail outlets spread across the city of Leon. Each packet of tortilla
costs her $10 and she retails it at $25 per packet. Weekly demand for tortilla is as
shown in Table 9.2.
How many packets of tortillaS must the front desk manager order if:
•
The unsold packets of tortilla at the end of the day’s business perishes, and has
no salvage value?
•
The unsold packets are sold to a nearby food processing ﬁrm at $5 per packet?
To start the solution process, we assume that the demand is normally distributed.
(Later in this chapter we will discuss solutions for items whose demand follows a
uniform or Poisson distribution as well.) Note that we do not have parameters of the
normal distribution. The ﬁrst step, therefore, is to compute the parameters of the
normal distribution – the mean and standard deviation. Table 9.3 illustrates com-
putation of these parameters.
The mean weekly demand, μ, is
¼
P fX
P f ¼ 99588
176 ¼ 565
Next we can calculate the standard deviation, σ, which is given by
¼

Thus, the mean demand is 565 and standard deviation is 205 packets. The next
step is to compute the critical ratio. We know that the revenue per packet is $25 and
the cost per packet is $10. Moreover, unsold tortilla packets have no salvage.
Substituting these values in Eq. 9.7a, we get

Since we have assumed the demand follows a normal distribution, we need to

H&N would like to buy the designer shirts and sell those through their retail outlets.

assuming the demand for the shirt is normally distributed with a mean of 200 and a
standard deviation of 25.
Solution
We start the solution process by computing the critical ratio. We know the cost is
$35 and the sale price is $55. The salvage value is $30. Using Eq. 9.7a, we get
Cr ¼ 55  35
55  30 ¼ 0:80
The next step is to ﬁnd the value of the standard normal variate for a probability
of 0.80. We can use MS Excel function, NORM . S . INV(p), to obtain this:
z ¼ NORM:S:INV 0:80
ð

The optimal order quantity Q can be computed using Eq. 9.9. Substituting the

The optimal order quantity is 221 shirts.

Solved Problem 9.3
SpiceJet sells tickets for their Bangalore–Mumbai ﬂight SJ516 that has a capacity of
325 seats. SpiceJet strategists have analyzed ﬂight load data and have found that
between 20 and 35 passengers cancel their tickets. SpiceJet, therefore, overbook
their ﬂights. They make a proﬁt of $125 on every paid seat. But when the ﬂight is
full, an additional passenger arriving at the check-in counter has to be awarded free
ﬂights or cash payment, which costs SpiceJet $50. Compute the number of tickets
SpiceJet may overbook for ﬂight SJ516.
Solution
In this problem,
•
The cost of underage is revenue lost due to an empty seat on the ﬂight ($125);
•
The cost of overage is the cash payment that SpiceJet needs to make to those
passengers that cannot be taken on board ($50).
Using Eq. 9.6a, we have
Cr ¼

125 þ 50 ¼ 0:71
Since a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 35 passengers cancel their tickets,
from Eq. 9.10, we have
Q ¼ 20 þ 0:71  35  20

SpiceJet may overbook 31 seats for their ﬂight SJ516, or sell tickets for

9.3.5
Case of Poisson Distributed Demand
When demand follows a Poisson distribution (Jenson and Bard 2003), the following
MS Excel function can be used to compute the individual and cumulative
probabilities:
p n
ð Þ ¼ POISSON x; μ; CF
ð
Þ
where
•
p(n) is the probability of having a demand of n items;
•
x takes different values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. . .n items;
9.3
Single Period Inventory Model with Stochastic Demand
243

•
μ is the sample mean;
•
CF is the cumulative ﬂag; it is set to TRUE for obtaining cumulative probability
of the Poisson distribution.
For example, consider an item whose demand follows a Poisson distribution
with a mean of 5 units. The probability that the demand in any period would be
exactly 2 units is
p 2
ð Þ ¼ Poisson 2; 5; FALSE
ð
Þ ¼ 0:08
In other words, there is 8% chance that the demand for the item would be exactly
2 units.
Solved Problem 9.41
A generator on board a naval ship has a critical component. In the event this
component fails, it needs to be replaced with a spare one held on board. The
commander of the ship needs to determine the number of spares of this component
he would need to hold on board at the start of their yearlong ¨at-sea¨ period. One
spare component costs $15,000. Nonavailability of the spare component on board
would necessitate the commander to request a helicopter to airlift a replacement
from the nearest onshore depot. The cost of this exercise would be $100,000. The
component takes up a large space on board the ship, and the holding costs and the
cost of nonusage is approximately $50,000. The observed failure rate of this
component is four failures per year.
Solution
Table 9.4 shows the probability values for Poisson distribution using a mean
of 4. This can be generated using the MS Excel function POISSON(n, 4, TRUE)
where n is the number of spares to be held (0, 1, 2, etc.).
We can use Eq. 9.8 to determine the critical ratio, which in this case is
Cr ¼ 100000  15000
100000 þ 50000 ¼ 0:567
The critical ratio corresponds to a value between 3 and 4 in Table 9.4. It is
therefore advisable to carry four spares on board before they leave for their
yearlong expedition.

9.3.6
Case of Discrete Distribution
In the previous section we assumed, demand followed a known distribution. In
some cases, organizations may not have sufﬁcient demand data to ﬁt it to any
known distribution. In such a case we can use a graphical method to obtain optimal
order quantity (See Monks 1987). Consider a situation where a campaign is being
run to administer polio vaccine (“polio drops”) to children under the age of 5 in
Mexico. Administration of the vaccine is done on the ﬁrst Monday of every quarter
in government-managed hospitals. Hospital Angeles in Leon is one such hospital
where the vaccine is administered. One day before the event, the hospital manage-
ment has to place an order for a certain number of vaccines, or shots, they would
likely be administering. It costs the hospital management $2 to purchase one shot,
and they charge $3 for administering it on a child. Unused vaccines are destroyed/
disposed off since they are unusable for the next quarter. The hospital management
needs to decide the quantity of vaccines that would need to be ordered. Since the
hospital has been administering these shots for the last 6 years (24 quarters), they
have been able to compile the demands for vaccines shown in Table 9.5
The ﬁrst step is to draw a histogram to see if the data can be ﬁt to any known
distribution. Fig. 9.2 shows the histogram. Notice that the histogram reveals no
pattern, and therefore it would be incorrect to apply the formulae we used in the
previous section.

The next step is to construct a probability distribution table. This is shown in
Table 9.6. The probability can be computed by dividing the demand value by the
number of times the demand has been observed. For example, a demand for
16 vaccines has been observed three times in the last 24 quarters. The probability
of demand for 16 vaccines is
3=24¼0:125. We can also compute the cumulative
probability values.
The next step is to calculate the critical ratio, Cr. We know that the revenue per
vaccine is $3, and the cost per vaccine is $2. It is noted that there is no salvage
value. Substituting these values in Eq. 9.7a, we get
Cr ¼ 3  2
3  0 ¼ 0:33
The critical ratio of 0.33 corresponds to Q ¼ 17 units (from Table 9.6). The
hospital management must place an order for 17 vaccines.
9.4
Graphical Approach
Consider Rosetta’s running example we discussed in Sect. 3.3. We can use a graph
to obtain the optimal order quantity value. A graph that represents the cumulative
distribution of the demand can be drawn as shown in Fig. 9.3. We know the critical
ratio is 0.60 (no salvage value case). It is noticed that the critical ratio (Cr ¼ 0.6)
corresponds to a value of 635 on the cumulative distribution curve. The optimal
order quantity is, therefore, 635 units (compared to 618 packets using the analytical
method).
Also, for the case where there is a salvage value of $5 (critical ratio is 0.75),
the optimal quantity is 712 packets (704 packets using analytical method; see
Sect. 3.3).

Inventory Models for Perishable Items and Style Goods

Incorporating Beginning Inventory
One of the assumptions made earlier in this chapter is that the inventory at the
beginning of the period is zero. This assumption is particularly valid for items that
perish at the end of the period. But there may be products whose life exceeds one
period. In such a case, if the beginning inventory is a positive value, then the
following decision rules may be used (Nahmias 2005):
•
If the beginning inventory is less than Q, then subtract the beginning inventory
from the order quantity.
•
If the beginning inventory is more than the Q, then do not place an order.
Solved Problem 9.5
Consider the situation in Solved Problem 9.1. The optimal order quantity is
221 shirts. If H&N already has 30 shirts on hand they received from another source,
what would be the size of the order?
Solution
In this problem, since beginning inventory is less than Q, H&N must place an order
for Q  30 ¼ 191 shirts.

Summary
Several items have limited shelf life. Their utility value reduces to zero at certain
point in time after which these items are no longer demanded by customers. These
are called perishable items. In this chapter we discussed inventory models for
perishable items, also called single period inventory models or newspaper boy

problems. We considered items whose demand follows a known discrete or con-
tinuous distribution (normal, uniform, Poisson). We also discussed the solution
process for items whose demand pattern does not ﬁt any known distribution. Due to
similarities in the characteristics, the solution approach used for managing perish-
able items may also be used to solve style goods problems as demonstrated in this
chapter.

Case Study: Managing Sales of Sports Gear
Soccer is the most popular team sport in Mexico, and La Liga MX is Mexico’s
premier soccer league. The soccer league is administered by the Mexican Soccer
Association (MSA). Each year, 18 teams participate in this soccer league. The
soccer season starts in March and ends in May. Each team plays the other 17 teams
once, and the league table topper is crowned the champion for the year.
Armando is the proprietor of S-Mart, a very popular retail chain involved in
selling sports goods all over Mexico. Armando buys sports goods directly from the
source and sells it through his 35 retail shops spread across the country.
To cash in on the soccer-frenzy public, the MSA administrators introduce new
designs of sports gear including footwear, jerseys, coffee mugs, and the like each
year. Well before the start of the season, the league administrators invite top
retailers from Mexico to a special preview session where they present new sports
gear. Their objective is to obtain a commitment from the retailers and distributors
on the quantity they would be able to sell through their retail shops. Being the owner
of a very popular sports good retail chain, Armando regularly gets called for such
special preview sessions.
This year Armando has been offered sole rights to sell jerseys that have the logos
of all the 18 participating teams. Under the deal, MSA would sell Armando all the
jerseys at $60 per piece. Armando is conﬁdent he would be able to retail it at $95
per piece this season. Unsold stock of jerseys would have to be put through a
clearance sale. He expects to sell all of this (unsold) stock at $50 per piece.
Armando has to now make a decision on the number of jerseys he would be able
to sell. He has compiled data of the sale of jerseys (in thousands) over the last
30 seasons, as shown in Table 9.7

Practice Problems
Problem 9.1
All standard rooms at Hotel Gateway, located next to the cricket stadium, are fully
booked during the cricket premier league season. Cancellation occurring during the
season is uniformly distributed between ﬁve and eight rooms. When a customer
with reservation arrives at the check-in counter and there are no rooms available,
the hotel authorities must accommodate this customer at another partner hotel, but it
costs them $50. If the tariff of a standard room is $35, determine the number of
rooms that Hotel Gateway staff may overbook.
Hint
The cost of underestimating cancellation is $35 and the cost of overestimating
cancellation is $50. Use these values to compute critical ratio.
Answer
Critical ratio is 0.41; number of rooms that may be overbooked is 6.23 (~7 rooms).
Problem 9.2
Consider the overbooking situation in Problem 9.1. If the demand is normally
distributed with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 3, determine the number
of rooms that the hotel staff may overbook.
Answer:
For a critical ratio of 0.41, the NORM . S . INV() function returns a negative value
(0.28). This means that the number of rooms that may be overbooked is less than
the mean:
¼5 + [(0.2275)  3] ¼ 4.3 (~4 rooms)
Problem 9.3
Eagle Calendars is a retail shop that buys and sells year planners. Each year in
November they receive one bulk order for planners. It costs Eagle $1.5 per planner

and they sell them for $4.5 each. In February, unsold planners are sold in bulk to a
paper and pulp mill for $0.25 each. How many calendars should Eagle order if the
demand during the peak season is uniform distribution between 12000 and 15000.
Answer
z ¼ NORM . S . INV(0.705) ¼ 0.53.
Order size ¼ 12000 + (0.53  3000) ¼ 13590
Problem 9.4
A newspaper boy purchases newspapers from an agency every morning at $0.50 per
copy. He gets a commission of $0.25 for every copy sold. Unsold newspapers can
be returned to the news agency at $0.10 per copy. If the daily demand for
newspapers is normally distributed with a mean of 15 and a standard deviation of
3, determine the number of newspapers that the newspaper boy must procure from
the agency.
Answer:
Underage cost is the commission: $0.25; overage cost is $0.50 – $0.10 ¼ $0.40;
critical ratio ¼ 0.385, NORM.S.INV returns: 0.25; therefore, the number of
papers to be bought would be less than the mean (15 – 0.76 ~ 14 papers).

Inventory Models for Maintenance
and Repairable Items
10.1
Introduction to Maintenance Inventories
Rosetta’s uses large automated tortilla-making machines. Each machine
includes a dough loading section, a pressing section, a spiral heating (carou-
sel) section, and a packaging section. The spiral heating section is driven by a
powerful three-phase, 230 V electric motor that is used 365 days a year for
16 hours each day. In the event of a motor failure, production losses incurred
by Rosetta’s would be $100 per hour. The failure rate ( p) of the motor is 2 per
year, and the mean time to repair (T) is 3 months. Rosetta’s has four such
identical tortilla-making machines, and currently has one spare rotable motor
in their stores.
How many spare motors must Rosetta’s maintain in their inventory? Is one
spare motor held in inventory sufﬁcient for Rosetta’s to minimize their
production losses? What would be the savings in downtime if they employ
one more spare motor? These are some of the questions that would be
addressed in this chapter.
Organizations use different equipment to transform raw materials into ﬁnished
products. An equipment is made up of several parts – systems, subsystems, com-
ponents, subcomponents, etc. – with each part having its own deﬁned function.
These parts may fail any time during the lifetime of the equipment. When this
happens, the failed part needs to be replaced with another (new or as good as new)
part. A replacement is also sought when a part is not functioning as expected. This
replacement part is referred to as a spare part.
An equipment needs regular maintenance to ensure it delivers expected service
performance. Routine maintenance activities also consume materials – for example,
lubricants, coolants, cleaning chemicals, etc. Sophisticated equipment have inbuilt

sensors to predict an impending failure of a part or subsystem. These sensors may
also fail, requiring them to be replaced with new ones. All these materials – spare
parts, lubricants, coolants, sensors, etc. – that support the revenue-generating
processes of an organization are referred to as maintenance items. These items
are stored in the maintenance stores, because their nonavailability may result in
signiﬁcant equipment downtime, and hence loss of business proﬁts. These items
form part of the maintenance inventories. In this book, we use the terms spare parts
and maintenance items interchangeably.
10.2
Classiﬁcation of Maintenance Inventories
Based on the usage rate, Kelly (2006) has classiﬁed spare parts as follows (we use
the same classiﬁcation for most maintenance items):
•
Fast-moving items: These are maintenance items that have a demand of 3 units
or more per year.
•
Slow-moving items: Maintenance items that have a demand of fewer than 3 units
per year are considered to be slow-moving spare parts. Mitchell (1962) has
further classiﬁed slow-moving items into specials, adequate warning, and inad-
equate warning spares, based on the amount of time that is available to react to
an impending failure.
•
Rotables: In most circumstances, failed parts are removed from an equipment
and are replaced by new ones from the stores. In some cases, it is possible to
repair failed parts. Rotables are those that are repaired, or reconditioned, and
made available for service, instead of being disposed off.
Figure 10.1 shows classiﬁcation of maintenance items. In the following sections,
we discuss inventory models and methods of managing those.

Managing Fast-Moving Items
In the previous chapters, we reviewed inventory models to compute the order
quantity and reorder levels for items, as well as the timing of the review. Fast-
moving items can be managed using any of the deterministic (Chap. 3) or stochastic
models (Chap. 6) we discussed earlier in this book. Therefore, only an outline of
this philosophy will be presented in this section.
The primary function of the maintenance stores is to minimize the total inven-
tory costs of maintenance inventories by balancing the holding costs and the
shortage costs incurred due to equipment downtime.
When the demand for a maintenance item is steady, then the EOQ formula
(Chap. 3), shown below, can be used to determine the order size:
Q ¼
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

ð10:1Þ
As discussed earlier, demand for a maintenance item is caused by
•
the need to carry out preventive and routine maintenance actions, such as those
recommended by the equipment manufacturer, and issues found during regular
cleaning of equipment;
•
the need to carry out corrective maintenance actions, such as ﬁxing a failed
equipment.
In certain situations, the demand for maintenance items can be forecast, but most
of the demand is uncertain. We, therefore, need to use our learnings from Chap. 6 to
estimate the reorder level. We know that the reorder level can be determined by

where
•
d is the average lead time demand;
•
L is the lead time;
•
z is the standardized normal variate (or the number of standard deviations for a
speciﬁed service level;
•
σi is standard deviation of the lead time demand.
It is important to ensure that the units for mean, standard deviation, and lead time
are the same. For example, the mean, standard deviation, and lead times must all be
in days (or months, or years).
Solved Problem 10.1
Sam Motors is an authorized service station for passenger cars. The demand for
engine oil seals at Sam Motors is 100 per month with a standard deviation of 5 per
month. The lead time for procuring these seals from the market is 1 month. Each
seal costs $1 and the ordering cost is $5 per order. If the inventory carrying rate used
10.3

253

is 10% per annum, compute the economic order quantity and the reorder point if a
cycle service level of 85% is desired. Assume demand during lead time to be
normally distributed.
Solution
•
Mean monthly demand, d , is 100 units (or 1200 units per year).
•
Standard deviation of demand, σi, is 5 units.
•
Lead time is 1 month.
•
Ordering cost, Co, is $5 per order.
•
Cost of item, C, is $1.
•
Desired service level, z, is 0.85.
•
Carrying interest rate, i, is 0.10.
Using Eq. 10.1, we can determine the optimal order quantity. Substituting the
values, we get

The standard deviation of the lead time demand, σd, is 5 units. The problem
states that a service level of 85% is desired. We can use the NORM . S . INV(p)
function in MS Excel to obtain the standard normal variate for a speciﬁed service
level, which in this case is 0.85. We get
z ¼ NORM:S:INV 0:85
ð
Þ ¼ 1:04
We can now use Eq. 10.2 to determine the reorder level. Substituting the values
of d , L , z, and σ in Eq. 10.2, we get
s ¼ d L þ zσd ¼ 100  1
ð
Þ þ 1:04  5

The ordering policy for the given problem is as follows:
Place an order for 346 units when the inventory level reaches 105 units.

Managing Slow-Moving Items
Mitchell (1962) has categorized slow-moving items1 into
•
special items;
•
items that provide adequate warning; and
•
true standby spares (or items that provide inadequate warning).
Management of the above categories of maintenance items is the focus of this
section.

Inventory Models for Maintenance and Repairable Items

10.4.1
Special Items
A special item, or a special spare, is one that is bought for use or required for a
planned maintenance activity on a speciﬁc date (See Kelly 2006; Mitchell 1962;
Vrat 2014). Since the date for consumption (or usage) of this part is known well in
advance, it can be ordered in such a way that it arrives just in time. No inventory of
this type of spare is required to be maintained. Since the order size is usually one
(e.g., one part or one kit or one set), inventory managers need to worry only about
the timing of order placement, taking into consideration the procurement lead time.
Procurement lead times may vary, and it is a usual practice to add a buffer time
to the procurement lead time. This is called the safety lead time. In the past,
researchers have used normal distribution to model procurement lead times.
Figure 10.2 shows a normal distribution with probability values in terms of mean
and standard deviations. Note that 68% of the area under the curve falls between 1
and +1 standard deviation, 95% of the area falls between 2 and +2 standard
deviations, and 99% of the area under the normal curve falls between 3 and +3
standard deviations. Let us now discuss how we can use this to manage the timing
of procurement orders for specials. Consider a special spare that has a standard lead
time of 45 days with a standard deviation (SD) of 5 days. The following may be
kept in mind before placing an order:
•
There is a 68% chance that the ordered special item would arrive anywhere
between the 40th day (mean – one SD) and 50th day (mean + one SD).
•
There is a 95% chance that the ordered special item would arrive anywhere
between the 35th day (mean – two times SD) and 55th day (mean + two times
SD).
•
There is a 99% chance that the ordered special item would arrive anywhere
between the 30th day (mean – three times SD) and 60th day (mean + three
times SD).
If the inventory manager wants a high level of assurance (say, 99%) of receiving
the special, she would want to use a safety lead time of three times the standard
deviation, or 15 days. She would need to place an order 60 days in advance

(45 days’ standard lead time + 15 days’ safety lead time) to assure that 99 out of
100 times the special would be received on time to perform the planned mainte-
nance activity.
10.4.2
Items that Provide Adequate Warning
Some parts provide sufﬁcient indication of an impending failure. Warnings such as
noise, excessive vibration, abnormal temperature, etc. are indications that items are
likely to fail soon. Since adequate warning is provided, the inventory policy for this
type of spare should be to not stock this item, and place an expedited order the
moment an indication of an impending failure is observed.
10.4.3
Items that Provide Inadequate Warning
In this section, we discuss analytical as well as graphical methods of managing
inventory of items that provide little or no warning of an impending failure.

The objective function Eq. 10.3 is to determine N such that CN is minimal. The
value of N is unlikely to exceed 3 units. See Vrat (2014). In some cases, the term
involving ordering cost is not included in calculation, because it is relatively very
small compared to the holding and shortage costs.
Solved Problem 10.3
Demand for a grinding ring of a coal-pulverizing mill is 1 per year. The lead time to
procure this item is 1 year. If the shortage cost is $250,000 per unit and the holding
cost is $50,000 per unit, compute the number of spare grinding rings that need to be
kept in stock. Assume lead time follows a Poisson distribution.
Solution
In this problem, we have been given the following:
•
Ch, the cost of holding a spare in inventory is $50,000 per unit.
•
Cs, the cost of stockout (or shortage) is $250,000 per unit.
•
L, the average lead time is 1 year.
•
T, the time between failures is 1 year.
•
p(n) follow a Poisson distribution; we can use the Poisson distribution function
in MS Excel.

Flag parameter can be set to False when we need just the individual Poisson
probability, and True when we need the cumulative value. Table 10.1 shows the
results of substituting the above values in Eq. 10.3 for different values of N (0, 1,
2, etc.) (Fig. 10.3).
It is noticed that the total costs corresponding to N ¼ 2 is minimal. Therefore, it
is best to maintain an initial inventory of two grinding rings.

10.4.3.2
Graphical Method
Mitchell (1962) has also developed indifference curves as shown in Fig. 10.4. An
indifference curve is one where all the points lying on the curve have the same
utility value. For example, all the points lying on the line O–H in Fig. 10.4 have the
same utility value (in this case, have the same cost, CN). Similarly, all the points
lying on C1 ¼ C2(represented by other diagonal lines in Fig. 10.4) have the same
costs. It is noticed that C1 ¼ C2 is a function of lead time, and hence there would be
one curve for each value of lead time, for C1 ¼ C2. Figure 10.4 shows indifference
curves for various values of lead times (L ¼ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 12 , and 18 months).
When the values of lead time, demand, cost of holding, and stockout are known, the
following decision rules may be used. The ratio of stockout to holding costs2, Cs=Ch,
and the demand for the spare, D, correspond to a point in the graph. Depending on
where this point lies on the graph, Table 10.2 presents decision rules that would
help determine the number of spares that need to be held initially in the inventory.
The order size is always 1.
Solved Problem 10.4
Consider the data provided in Solved Problem 10.3. Use the graphical method to
determine the initial number of spares that need to be maintained in the stores.
Solution
We have the following data with us:
•
Ch, the cost of holding a spare in inventory is $50,000 per unit.
•
Cs, the cost of stockout (or shortage) is $250,000 per unit.
•
L, the average lead time is 1 year (12 months).

•
T, the time between failures is 1 year.
•
The ratio of the stockout cost to holding cost is 5.
From Fig. 10.4, we see that the coordinates of this point (1,5) lie above C1 ¼ C2
(that corresponds to L ¼ 12 months). From decision rules presented in Table 10.2,
we see it is best to hold two spares in the inventory.
Solved Problem 10.5
Determine the initial number of spares that need to be maintained in the stores if the
failure rate is 0.2 per year, the lead time is 2 years, and stockout cost to holding cost
ratio is 0.3.
Solution
Since the demand is 0.2 per year, the time between issues is 1/0.2 ¼ 5 years.
The stockout cost to holding cost ratio is 0.3.
From Fig. 10.4, we see that the coordinates of this point (5,0.3) lie below
C0 ¼ C1. From decision rules presented in Table 10.2, it is best to hold no spares
in the inventory.
10.5
Managing Rotables
Rotables is a special category of maintenance item that is not consumed during a
maintenance operation but is reconditioned and returned to service. Items such as
this are also referred to as recoverable or repairable spare. Consider an example of a
naval ship that returns to the shore to undergo repairs. A failed part on the ship, say,
the engine, is removed and is replaced with an engine in working condition from the
stores (inventory). The failed engine is not disposed off, but is sent to the repair
shop for reconditioning. After reconditioning, the engine, which is now in a
serviceable state, is sent to the stores where it awaits deployment on ships as a
need arises.
Inventory policy, in this case, would be to determine the initial number of
rotables that would need to be maintained to satisfy the desired service level. The
most common way of treating this problem is to use the queuing model where
failures of equipment are treated as customers, and rotables are considered to be the
queuing channels. A stockout situation occurs when a customer arrives but all
rotables are busy, that is, no rotables are available in stores. Doeh (1960) has
shown that the probability of stockout, p(0), can be given by
p 0

We use the same symbols used in any standard queuing theory text. In Eq. 10.5,
ρ is the utilization factor or the trafﬁc intensity, and n is the number of rotables.

Inventory Models for Maintenance and Repairable Items

ρ can be determined using the ratio of the mean arrival rate to the mean service rate.
In other words,
ρ ¼ λ
μ
ð10:6Þ
where λ is the mean inter-arrival rate and μ is the service rate. Eq. 10.5 can be used
to determine the optimal number of rotable spares for a desired service level. The
model assumes arrivals follow a Poisson distribution.
Solve Problem 10.6
Historical data show that the oil pump of the pulverizer has failed 200 times over
5 years. It takes 15 days to repair an oil pump and return it to a serviceable state.
Determine the number of spare oil pumps that need to be stocked to obtain a service
level of 95%.
Solution
In this problem, the failure rate, λ
¼ 200
5 ¼ 40 failures per year
The mean repair rate is 15 days or

μ ¼ 15

Therefore,
ρ ¼ λ
μ ¼ 40  15

¼ 1:65
Table 10.3 shows the results for different values of n. The number of rotables
that need to be stocked is between four and ﬁve to obtain a service level of 95%.
An alternative technique that has been used for the determination of a rotable
inventory policy has been described by Hodges (as quoted by Kelly 2006). It is
assumed that a rotable has a failure rate of p per year. If there are N identical
equipment using these rotables, the combined rotable failure rate is Np. If the mean
time to repair is T years, then the savings in downtime D if one rotable is held in
inventory is

Let us now apply this to Rosetta’s case. Rosetta’s uses a large automated tortilla-
making machine that includes a dough loading section, a pressing section, a spiral
heating (carousel) section, and a packaging section. The spiral heating section is
driven by a powerful three-phase, 230 V electric motor, that is used 365 days a year
for 16 hours each day. In the event of a motor failure, production losses incurred by
Rosetta’s would be $100 per hour. The failure rate ( p) of the motor is 2 per year,
and the mean time to repair (T) is 3 months. Rosetta’s has four such identical
tortilla-making machines, and currently has one spare motor (rotable) in their
stores. In this case,

Inventory Models for Maintenance and Repairable Items

Since Rosetta’s has one spare rotable, we can use Fig. 10.5 to estimate the
average annual downtime of equipment for NpT ¼ 2 and x ¼ 1, which is 0.85. The
annual cost of downtime is
¼ 365  24  100  0:85 ¼ $744; 600
If Rosetta’s employs one more spare, then the estimated annual average down-
time would be (from Fig. 10.5) 0.63.
¼ 365  24  100  0:63 ¼ $551; 880
The savings would be $744,600  $551,880¼ $192,720 per year.
Solved Problem 10.7
Use Hodges method to compute the annual downtime cost for the following
scenario: N ¼ 2 , p ¼ 0.5 , T ¼ 1, and x ¼ 1. Assume 365  24 work hours and pro-
duction losses of $50 per hour.
Solution
In this case,
NpT ¼ 2  0:5  1 ¼ 1
From Fig. 10.5, the average annual downtime, D, for NpT ¼ 1 and x ¼ 1 is 0.63.
The total downtime cost is 365  24  50  0.63 ¼ $276,000

Summary
In this chapter, we discussed management of a different class of items – mainte-
nance items. We discussed management of fast-moving items, slow-moving items,
and rotable spares. Inventory managers can use any of the deterministic or stochas-
tic techniques presented in the earlier chapters to manage fast-moving spares.
However, the same techniques may not be applicable to manage slow-moving
spares because the consumption of spare parts is random, and reliability of histor-
ical records is low. Even though the demand is low, organizations would still need
to maintain an inventory of these parts because they may not be available a few
years later as original equipment manufacturers would no longer be producing
those parts. In our discussions in this chapter, we presented both graphical and
analytical methods that can help inventory managers determine the initial number
of slow-moving spares they would need to keep in their stores. Finally, in this
chapter, we discussed a mathematical model to manage rotables or repairable items
that are reconditioned and made available for service.

Case Study: Managing Spare Parts at a Thermal
Power Plant
A power generation unit of a thermal power plant consists of several subsystems –
the coal washing section, the desalination system, the fuel system, the steam
generation system, the economizer section, and the cooling section. Relatively,
the fuel system encounters a higher number of failures than the other subsystems
(Shenoy and Bhadury 1998).
At a very high level, the fuel system of a thermal power plant consists of a coal
crushing unit, or a pulverizer, a set of coal-carrying ducts and pipes and a set of
burners. The function of a pulverizer is to grind (crush) coal into ﬁne particles. Raw
cleansed coal is transported via open coal-carrying ducts into the pulverizer. The
pulverizer is a large processing chamber that has grinding elements consisting of
grinding balls that roll between upper and lower grinding rings. Raw coal gets
entangled between the grinding elements and is ground to ﬁne particles. Air at
high pressure is sent into the grinding chamber using Primary Air Fans. The lighter,
ground coal particles are blown through the closed coal-carrying pipes to the burner
section, while the larger, coarser coal particles remain inside the chamber till ground
further. The coal-carrying chutes are large pipes (12 in diameter) that connect the
pulverizer section to the burners. The ﬁne ground coal particles brush against the
sides of the chutes as it is transported. The abrasive wear is more prominent at the
bends of these chutes than in straights. A frequently occurring failure is leakage of
ground coal from these bends that require replacement of these bend sections.
A pulverizer is a high-maintenance equipment that needs to be overhauled once
every 18 months. Overhaul involves inspection and replacement of all worn out
parts. Table 10.4 describes the key components of the fuel system.

Inventory Models for Maintenance and Repairable Items

Case Study Questions
(a) Using concepts learned in this chapter, categorize the components into fast-
moving, slow-moving (adequate warning, inadequate warning, and specials),
and rotables.
(b) For each of the parts, state the inventory policy you would use to manage.

Practice Problems
Problem 10.1
An engine has a mean failure rate of 1 per week and a repair time of 2 weeks. Use
Doeh’s method to determine the number of spare engines that need to be stocked to
obtain a service level of 95%.
Answer
In this problem, λ ¼ 1 per week and 1
μ ¼ 2 weeks. Therefore, σ ¼ λ
μ ¼ 2. Using
Eq. 10.5, we can compute the probability of acceptable stockout shown in
Table 10.5.
The number of spare engines to be stored to obtain a 95% service level is ﬁve
engines.
Problem 10.2
What changes would you make to your stocking policy in Problem 10. 1 if the
service time were reduced to 1 week.
Answer
For σ ¼ 1, the probability of acceptable stockout computed using Eq. 10.5 is shown
in Table 10.6. The number of spares required to achieve a service level of 95%
would be four.
Problem 10.3
Demand for a high-investment slow-moving spare is 1 per year. The lead time to
procure this item is 4 months. If the shortage cost is $100,000 per unit and the

holding cost is $25,000 per unit, compute the number of spare grinding rings that
need to be kept in stock. Use Mitchell’s graphical method.
Answer
The ratio of shortage to holding cost is 4. The lead time is 6 months. Looking up
Fig. 10.4, we see the coordinate is above the diagonal line for a lead time of
6 months. So, the decision would be to stock two spares.
Problem 10.4
Demand for spares is one per year. The ratio of stockout to holding cost is 1 while
lead time is 2 months.
(a) Determine the number of spares that need to be maintained.
(b) If the lead time is reduced to 1 month, how would this impact the stocking
policy?
Answer
The ratio of shortage to holding cost is 1. The lead time is 2 months. Looking up
Fig. 10.4, we see the coordinate is above the diagonal line for a lead time of
2 months. So, the decision would be to stock two spares. If lead time is reduced
to 1 month, the number of spares to be held is one.
Problem 10.5
Use Hodges method to compute the annual downtime cost for the following
scenario: N ¼ 3 , p ¼ 1 , T ¼ 1, and x ¼ 2. Assume 365  24 work hours and produc-
tion losses of $50 per hour.
Answer
NpT ¼ 3 , x ¼ 2. Looking up Fig. 10.5, the average downtime, D, for NpT ¼ 3 and
x ¼ 2 is 0.8. The total downtime cost is 365  24  50  0.8 ¼ $350,400.

Multi-echelon Inventory Models
11.1
Multi-echelon: Deﬁnition
To increase their market share, Rosetta’s has now decided to allow a sole
franchisee in Leo´n to sell the Rosetta brand of tortillas. The franchisee places
an order for a certain number of packs of tortillas. This costs them $4 per
order. Rosetta’s supplies each pack of tortillas to the franchisee at a price of
$10. The franchisee can retail a pack of tortillas at $22. Inventory carrying
rate is 30% per annum and the annual demand for tortillas is 6000 packs. How
do we determine the ordering quantities for the franchisee as well as
Rosetta’s? Rosetta’s “incurs” an order cost of $8 per order when they procure
the packets from their kitchen. Also, we assume the tortillas have an indeﬁnite
shelf life.
In this chapter, we address a multi-echelon (simple, two-stage) inventory
decision-making problem.
Inventory models discussed in the previous chapters dealt with items stocked in
one location. In reality, most systems involve multiple locations or stages. For
example, customers arrive at a retail shop to buy items they need. The stock of items
at the retail shop gets depleted as demand arises. At some point, the retail shop
owner places a replenishment order with a warehouse, which, when received,
increases the quantity of items on hand at the retail shop. Similarly, as the inventory
level in the warehouse gets depleted the warehouse manager needs to place an order
with the manufacturer to supply fresh stock, and so on. Each of these entities

involved in the discussion – the retailer, the warehouse, and the manufacturer – are
referred to as stages or echelons. Figure 11.1 shows a schematic of a multi-echelon
inventory system.1
11.2
Two-Stage Inventory Model: Deterministic Demand
Consider a simple serial system consisting of just two stages – one warehouse and
one retail outlet – dealing with a single item. The retail outlet buys its supplies from
the warehouse to meet the demand from customers, and the warehouse sources its

inventory system.
Let us further assume that the demand for items is constant (deterministic) at
D units per year. Other notations used in this model are as follows:
•
Cow is the ordering cost per order for the warehouse.
•
Cor is the ordering cost per order for the retailer.
•
Cw is the unit price of the item at the warehouse.
•
Cr is the unit price of the item at the retailer.
•
Qw is the order quantity for the warehouse.
•
Qr is the order quantity for the retailer.
•
i is the carrying rate per annum.
The average inventory at the retail outlet is

The average inventory at the warehouse, however, cannot be determined easily
since it does not follow the sawtooth pattern. Clark and Scarf (1960) introduced the
concept of echelon inventory and proved that echelon inventory2 at any given stage

stages. In other words, echelon inventory at the warehouse, I ¸C

We know that the total inventory cost (TIC) is equal to the sum of the ordering
costs and the carrying costs. The ordering cost for the warehouse is

•
Cow is $8 per order

Multi-echelon Inventory Models

Solved Problem 11.13
Real Great Foods (RGF) is a distributor of frozen food products. They source large
quantities of manchego cheese from their local supplier at $10 per kilogram. They
incur an ordering cost of $5 per order. Fresh manchego cheese, arriving at RGF
distribution center, are cut uniformly4 into thin square slices of 3in  3 in. Each
slice of cut cheese is wrapped in a plastic wrapper. Twenty such wrapped slices are
put into a plastic pack that has the RGF logo on it. RGF sells each pack of
manchego cheese to retail shops at $44 per pack of 1 kg. The setup cost for cutting,
wrapping, and packaging operation is $7. If the inventory carrying rate is 20% per
annum, compute the ordering quantities. Annual demand is 4275.
Solution
We have the following data:
•
D ¼ 4275
•
Cow ¼ $5
•
Cor ¼ $7
•
Cw ¼ $10 per kilogram

Two-Stage Inventory Model: Probabilistic Demand
Let us consider a serial system with one warehouse and one retailer. Let us assume
that the demand occurs at the retailer and that it is normally distributed with known
mean and standard deviation. Following are the notations used in this section:
•
Cw and Cr are the unit costs of the item at the warehouse and retailer,
respectively.
•
Rw and Rr are the reorder points at the warehouse and retailer, respectively.
•
Qw and Qr are the order quantities at the warehouse and retailer, respectively.
•
Dw and Dr are the lead time demands at the warehouse and retailer, respectively.
•
σw and σr are the standard deviation of lead time demand at warehouse and
retailer, respectively.
•
Csis the stockout cost expressed in fraction of unit value charged per unit short.
•
z is the standard normal variate.
Assuming that Qw ¼ nQr, the decision rules5 used to determine the reorder points
at the retailer and warehouse are as follows:
Rr ¼ Dr þ zσr

where z satisﬁes the following:

A Note of Multi-echelon Models for Repairable Items
A lot of literature is available on the multi-echelon models for repairable
items. Initial work in this area – called METRIC – was done by Sherbrooke
(1968). This was based on the research work done by Palm (1938). An
improved algorithm on the subject has been presented by Graves (1985). A
brief research-oriented essay on the topic can be found in the work by Vrat
(2014). These models are very complex and beyond the scope of this book.
Interested readers may refer to the speciﬁed material for further study.

Summary
In this chapter, we presented mathematical models to manage inventory items that
are maintained at multiple locations. These multi-echelon models are mathemati-
cally quite complex. Therefore, only a high-level view of this topic has been
discussed in this chapter. We presented a simple two-stage (warehouse and retailer)
model with deterministic demand and derived expressions to compute order quan-
tities for both the retailer and warehouse. We also discussed a multi-echelon model
for probabilistic demand and computed order quantities assuming demand to be
normally distributed.

Case Study
Hector has been running an ice cream parlor in the Cancun region of Mexico, where
demand for ice cream is almost steady throughout the year. He has been able to sell
3500 kg of ice cream each year. For several years he has been a franchisee of
Helado Mexicano, a very popular brand of ice cream in Mexico. Hector always
used a standard procedure for ordering ice creams. When appropriate, he places an
order with the sole distributor of Helado in the region. The distributor uses
refrigerated trucks to deliver the required quantity of ice cream the very next day.
It cost him $25 to place an order.
After about 15 proﬁtable years, Hector has now decided to expand his business.
He has decided he would open another ice cream parlor in upmarket Cancun, about
11.5
Case Study

8 km from his existing parlor. He believes the new parlor would be able to sell as
additional 3500 kg of ice cream. He has asked his son Donato to manage that
business for him.
Hector and Donato are now deliberating the way inventory in the new business
has to be managed. Between them, they are keen they minimize all inventory costs.
They have ﬁnalized the following arrangement for executing daily operations:
Donato would be running the new ice cream parlor as a franchisee of Hector’s
business This means he would give his requirement to Hector who would place an
order with the local distributor that would meet requirements of both the locations.
Trucks would deliver the ice cream at Hector’s parlor, which would be broken, and
a part of it would be repackaged and sent to Donato’s parlor. Hector believes by
ordering in bulk he would be able to negotiate a good price since the total order size
is expected to be in the range of 7000 kg a year. He thinks he would be able to get
ice cream at $125 per kg for this order size. However, in this scheme of things,
Donato will also have to bear an “ordering” cost of $50 per shipment since he would
have to pick up the ice creams received from Hector’s shop. Hector and Donato are
quite conﬁdent this additional expenditure will be offset by selling an ice cream at a
slightly higher price, considering the new shop would be in an upmarket area. A
price of $400 per kg is what they think would be a good price to sell in the
upmarket area.
Case Study Questions
•
Complete the inventory analysis for this case and determine the order quantities
for the businesses of Hector and Donato.
•
Also, analyze the costs if Donato decides to run his business independently (not
as a franchisee).
