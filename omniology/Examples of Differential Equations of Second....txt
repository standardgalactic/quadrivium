Introduction
Introduction
Here follows the continuation of a collection of examples from Calculus 4c-1, Systems of diﬀerential
systems. The reader is also referred to Calculus 4b and to Complex Functions.
We focus in particular on the linear diﬀerential equations of second order of variable coeﬃcients,
although the amount of examples is far from exhausting.
It should no longer be necessary rigourously to use the ADIC-model, described in Calculus 1c and
Calculus 2c, because we now assume that the reader can do this himself.
Even if I have tried to be careful about this text, it is impossible to avoid errors, in particular in the
ﬁrst edition. It is my hope that the reader will show some understanding of my situation.

Linear diﬀerential equations of second order with variable
coeﬃcients
Example 1.1 Solve the diﬀerential equation
t(t −1)d2x
dt2 + tdx
dt −x = t
in the interval ]1, ∞[, given that the corresponding homogeneous equation has the solution x = t.
There are here several variants of solutions. We shall here produce three of them.
1) Norm the equation and apply a solution formula.
Since t(t −1) > 0 in ]1, ∞[, we get by norming, i.e. division by the coeﬃcients of the term of
second order,
d2x
dt2 +
1
t −1
dx
dt −
1
t(t −1)x =
1
t −1,
thus u(t) =
1
t −1.
Hence
Ω(t) = exp

= t −1.

3) The standard method. We ﬁrst norm the equation

t(t −1)x =
1
t −1
for t > 1.
Given that y1(t) = t is a solution of the homogeneous equation, where y1(t) ̸= 0 for t > 1, a linearly
independent solution of the homogeneous equation can be computed by means of a formula,
y2(t)
=

Then a particular solution is also given by a standard formula,

Summing up we get the complete solution

where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
Example 1.2 Find the complete solution of the following diﬀerential equation, given that ϕ1(t) =
cosh t is a solution of the corresponding homogeneous diﬀerential equation,
d2x
dt2 −tanh t · dx
dt −(1 −tanh2 t)x = et,
t ∈R.
Here again there are several variants.
1) The equation is already normed, so we can immediately apply the solution formula,
x(t) = ϕ1(t)

1
ϕ1(t)2Ω(t)

c1 +

ϕ1(t)Ω(t)u(t) dt


where ϕ1(t) = cosh t, u(t) = et and
Ω(t) = exp(−

tanh t dt) =
1
cosh t.
This gives us
x(t)

c2 cosh t + 2c1 cosh t · Arctan(et) + cosh t · ln(1 + e2t).
2) If we put x = cosh t · y, then
dx
dt = cosh t dy
dt + sinh t · y,
d2x
dt2 = cosh t d2y
dt2 + 2 sinh t · dy
dt + cosh t · y,
hence by insertion into the diﬀerential equation,
et

Then by an integration,
cosh t · dy
dt = et + c2,
thus

et
e2t + 1.
By another integration,
y =
x
cosh t = ln(1 + e2t) + 2c2 Arctan(et) + c1,
hence
x = cosh t · ln(1 + e2t) + c1 cosh t + c2 cosh t · Arctan(et).

Finally, by another integration,

Finally, we add the complete solution of the homogeneous equation to get
x = cosh t · ln(1 + e2t) + c1 cosh t + c2 cosh t · Arctan(et).
Example 1.3 Find the complete solution of the following diﬀerential equation, given that ϕ1(t) = sin t

Example 1.5 Find the complete solution of the following diﬀerential equation, given that ϕ1(t) =
t · cosh t is a solution of the corresponding homogeneous diﬀerential equation,
t2 d2x
dt2 −2t dx
dt −(t2 −2)x = t3,
t ∈R+.
Here we have at least four diﬀerent solution methods.
1) Intuition. The structure of ϕ1(t) invites one to put x = t · y. Then
dx
dt = t dy
dt + y
og
d2x
dt2 = t d2y
dtr + 2 dy
dt .
If these results are put into the diﬀerential equation, we get
t3
=
t2 d2x
dt2 −2t dx
dt −(t2 −2)x = t3 d2x
dt2 + 2t2 dy
dt −2t2 dy
dt −2ty −t3y + 2ty
=
t3 d2y
dt2 −t3y.
If we divide by t3 > 0, then
d2y
dt2 −y = 1,
which is immediately solved,
y = −1 + c1 cosh t + c2 sinh t.
Then
x = t · y = −t + c1t · cosh t + c2t · sinh t.
2) Solution formula. We ﬁrst norm the equation,

Then

W dt = t · sinh t

dt −t · cosh2 t = −t.
The complete solution is
x = −t + c2t cosh t + c2t sinh t.
4) If we put x = ϕ1(t) · y = t · cosh t · y, then
dx
dt = t · cosh t · dy
dt + (cosh t + t · sinh t)y,
d2x
dt2 = t · cosh t · d2y
dt2 + 2(cosh t + t · sinh t)dy
dt + (2 sinh t + t · cosh t)y.
Then by insertion into the equation,
t3

which is reduced to

Then by an integration,
cosh2 t dy
dt = sinh t + c2,
thus
dy
dt = sinh t
cosh2 t +

cosh2 t.
By another integration,
y = −
1
cosh t + c1 + c2 tanh t,
and hence
x = t · cosh t · y = −t + c1t cosh t + c2t · sinh t.
Example 1.6 Find the complete solution of the following diﬀerential equation, given that ϕ1(t) = t
is a solution of the corresponding homogeneous diﬀerential equation,
(1 −t2)d2x
dt2 −t dx
dt + x = t,
t ∈]−1, 1[.
We have at least four diﬀerent variants of solutions:
1) Intuition. If we add −t dx
dt + t dx
dt = 0, and then perform some small rearrangements, we get

we get

2 + c1 + c2 · e,
thus c1 + ec2 = e −1,
and
e + 1
2 = ˜y′(t) = −1
2 −c1 + c2 · e,
thus −c1 + ec2 = e + 1.
It follows immediately that c1 = −1 and c2 = 1, and the wanted solution is

Since

it follows that ˜y(t) is increasing.

Example 1.8 Solve the diﬀerential equation
(1 + t2)d2x
dt2 + 2t dx
dt −2x = 4t2 + 2,
t ∈R+,
given that is has some polynomial of second degree as a solution.
We demonstrate three variants of solutions:
1) It is easily seen that the solution of the homogeneous equation is
x = c1t + c2(1 + t · Arctan t).
According to the hint we may guess a particular solution of the form x = at2 + b, where we can
neglect the term c · t, because it is a solution of the homogeneous equation. By insertion into the
left hand side of the equation we get
2a(1 + t2) + 2 · 2at2 −2at2 −2b = 4at2 + (2a −2b).
This expression is equal to 4t2 + 2, if a = 1 and b = 0. Hence the complete solution is
x = t2 + c1t + c2(1 + t · Arctan t).
2) We apply again that the solution of the homogeneous equation is
x = c1t + c2(1 + t · Arctan t).

Example 1.9 Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
(3) t2 d2x

in each of the intervals ]−∞, 0[ and ]0, ∞[, given that the homogeneous diﬀerential equation corre-
sponding to (3) has the solution ϕ1(t) = t · sin t.
Explain why anyone of the found solutions can be extended in precisely one way by one of the other
solutions to a single solution of (3) all over R.
Then ﬁnd the complete solution of (3) in R.
Find those line elements (0, x0, p), which allow at least one solution of (3).
We give here four variants of solutions.
1) The factor t in ϕ1(t) = t · sin t invites one to put x = t · y in order to obtain a simpler equation in
y. We get by a couple of computations,
dx
dt = t dy
dt + y
and
d2x

hence by insertion into (3),

dt + (t2 + 2)x = t3 d2y
dt2 + 2t2 dy

dt −2ty + t3y + 2ty = t3 d2y

Thus, if t ̸= 0, then
d2y
dt2 + y = 1,
the complete solution of which is
y = 1 + c1 sin t + c2 cos t.
Then we obtain the complete solution of the original equation by a multiplication by t,
x = t + c1t sin t + c2t cos t,
t ̸= 0.
2) If we instead put x = ϕ1(t)y = t sin t · y, then
dx
dt = t sin t dy
dt + (t cos t + sin t)y,

Remark 1.2 It is only suﬃcient with the restriction t ̸= 0 in the ﬁrst variant. All the methods of the
other three variants require that t ̸= pπ, p ∈Z, so we have strictly speaking some extension problems
in these variants at all these points.

Investigation of the possible extensions. Depending on the choice of method we shall either
check the continuation to all points t = pπ, p ∈Z (in the second, third and fourth variant) or just
to t = 0 (in the ﬁrst variant). We shall here only check the possible extension to t = 0, as if we had
applied the ﬁrst variant. The extensions to the other points are quite similar.
Hence we assume that
x = t + c1t sin t + c2t cos t,
for t ̸= 0.
Then
dx
dt = 1 + c1(t cos t + sin t) + c2(−t sin t + cos t),
d2x
dt2 = c1(−t sin t + 2 cos t) + c2(−t cos t −2 sin t).
Clearly, this solution holds in all of R. The problem is if there are other possibilities of extensions.
We note that
(4) lim
t→0 x(t) = 0,
lim
t→0 x′(t) = 1 + c2,
lim
t→0 x′′(t) = 2c1,
no matter it the limit is taken from the left hand side or from the right hand side. Thus, any C 2
solution must have uniquely determined constants c1 and c2 by (4). We therefore conclude that the
natural extension
x = t + c1t sin t + c2t cos t,
t ∈R,
is the complete solution of (3) all over R.
Finally, it follows from (4) that the line elements (0, x0, p), through which we have a solution of (3),
are given by (0, 0, 1 + c2), hence the line element must necessarily have the form (0, 0, p), so x0 = 0
and c2 = p −1. Since there is no restriction on c1, there are inﬁnitely many solutions through every
line element of the form (0, 0, p),
x = t + c1t sin t + (p −1)t cos t,
t ∈R;
c1 ∈R.
The explanation of this phenomenon is that t sin t has a zero of second order at 0, so we cannot “catch”
this function by means of the line element, which is only of the ﬁrst order.
On the other hand, the extensions to pπ, p ∈Z\{0}, are all unique, because here t sin t has only zeros
of ﬁrst order, so the line element can “catch” t sin t.

4t3 d2x
dt2 + 3t dx

Example 1.13 Consider the diﬀerential equation
(5) t(1 + t)d2y
dt2 + (2 + 3t)dy
dt + y = 0,

2) Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
t(1 + t)d2y
dt2 + (2 + 3t)dy

t ∈R+.
First variant. This problem is immediately solved by some reformulations of the linear, inhomoge-
neous equation of (2),

.
If this is integrated, we obtain with some arbitrary constant c2 that
(1 + t) d
dt(t · y) = c2 + ln(1 + t),
for t > 0,
hence by a rearrangement
d
dt(t · y) = ln(1 + t)
1 + t
+
c2
1 + t,
for t > 0.
By another integration we obtain with another arbitrary constant c1,
t · y = 1
2{ln(1 + t)}2 + c1 + c2 ln(1 + t),
for t > 0,
and the complete solution is er
y = 1
2 · {ln(1 + t)}2
t
+ c1
t + c2 · ln(1 + t)
t
for t > 0,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
In particular, y = t−1 is a solution of the homogeneous solution, and
y = c1
t + c2 · ln(1 + t)
t
is the complete solution of the homogeneous equation.

Example 1.14 Consider the diﬀerential equation
(6) t2 d2y
dt2 + tdy
dt −y = 0,
t ∈R+.
1) Prove that (6) has the solution y = t, t ∈R+, and then ﬁnd the complete solution.
2) Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
t2 d2y
dt2 + tdy
dt −y = t,
t ∈R+.
This example can be solved in many ways.
First variant.
1) If we put y = t into the equation, we get
t2 d2y
dt2 + tdy
dt −y = t2 · 0 + t · 1 −t = 0,
proving that y = t is a solution of the homogeneous equation, so ϕ1(t) = t.
By norming, i.e. division by t2, we get for t > 0 that
d2y

t

Since



2 · 1
t .
The complete solution of the homogeneous equation is
y(t) = c1t + c2 · 1
t ,
t > 0,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
2) Since u(t) = 1
t by the norming, we get the particular solution
y0(t)

Then the complete solution is by the linearity,

t > 0,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.

Second variant.
1) If we put y = ta into the equation, then
t2 d2y
dt2 + tdy
dt −y = a(a −1)ta + ata −ta = (a2 −1)ta.
This expression is identical 0 for t > 0, if a = ±1, so the complete solution is
y(t) = c1t + c2 · 1
t ,
t > 0,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
2) Then note that the right hand side of the (non-normed) equation
t2 d2y
dt2 + tdy
dt −y = t,
is a solution of the homogeneous equation. We therefore guess a particular solution of the form
y0(t) = a · t ln t,
where
dy0
dt = a(1 + ln t)
and
d2y0
dt2 = a
t .
Then by insertion,
t2 d2y
dt2 + tdy
dy −y = a{t + t + t ln t −t ln t} = 2at,
which is equal to t for a = 1
2.
The complete solution is
y(t) = 1
2 t ln t + c1t + c2 · 1
t ,
t > 0,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
Third variant.
1) By the monotonous substitution t = eu, u = ln t, and the chain rule we get,
dy
dt = du
dt · dy
du = 1
t
dy

and thus
d2y
du2 −y = eu,
u = ln t,
t > 0.
The characteristic equation R2 −1 = 0 has the roots R = ±1, so the homogeneous equation has
the complete solution
y = c1eu + c2e−u = c1t + c2
1
t ,
t > 0,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
2) Since the right hand side is of the form eu = ϕ1(u), we guess a solution of the form y = aueu
where
dy
du = a(u + 1)eu
og
d2y
du2 = a(u + 2)eu.
Then by insertion,
d2y
du2 −y = a(u + 2)eu −aueu = 2aeu,
which is equal to eu for a = 1
2, and the complete solution is
y = 1
2 ueu + c1eu + c2e−u = 1
2 t ln t + c1t + c2
1
t ,
t > 0,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.

1) If we put y = tα, then

which is satisﬁed for t > 0, when α = −1, and y = 1

The complete solution can now be found in several ways.
a) If one knows the theory of Euler’s diﬀerential equation, then since
α2 + 2α + 1 = (α + 1)2
has α = −1 as a root of multiplicity two, one concludes that the complete solution is
y = c1 · 1
t + c2 · ln t
t ,
t ∈R+,
c1, c2 arbitrary.
b) The equation is normed,
d2y
dt2 + 3
t
dy
dt + 1
t2 y = 0,
t ∈R+.
Then a linearly independent solution is given by
y2(t) = y1(t)

t ,
t > 0.
The complete solution is
y = c1 · 1
t + c2 · ln t
t ,
t ∈R+;
c1, c2 arbitrære.
2) Here we also have several variants.
a) Guessing. It follows immediately that y = −2 is a particular solution, hence the complete
solution is
y = −2 + c1 · 1
t + c2 · ln t
t ,
t ∈R+;
c1, c2 arbitrære.
b) Simple manipulation. Rewrite the equation in the following way,
−2

Then by integration,
t d
dt(ty) = −2t + c2,
thus d
dt(ty) = −2 + 1
t c2.
And by another integration,
ty = −2t + c2 ln t + c1,
and we ﬁnally get
y = −2 + c1 · 1
t + c2 · ln t
t ,
t ∈R+;
c1, c2 arbitrary.

Example 2.2 Consider the diﬀerential equation
(8) t2 d2y
dt2 −3t dy
dt + 4y = 0,
t ∈R+.
1) Prove that (8) has a solution of the form y = tα, t ∈R+, and then ﬁnd the complete solution.
2) Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
t2 d2y
dt2 −3t dy
dt + 4y = t4,
t ∈R+.
1) If we put y = tα into (8), then
(9) α(α−1)tα−3αtα+4tα = (α2−4α+4)tα = (α−2)2tα.
This expression is identical 0, if α = 2, hence a solution is y1 = t2, t ∈R+.
Remark 2.1 Since the equation is an Euler equation and α = 2 is a root of multiplicity 2, a
linearly independent solution is given by t2 ln t. However, this can no longer be assumed to be
known. Therefore we continue with the following more diﬃcult way.

2) a) We guess the solution y = ct4 of the inhomogeneous equation, thus α = 4. When we put this

Example 2.3 Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
t3 d2x
dt2 + 3t2 dx
dt + tx = 2,
t ∈R+,
given that the corresponding homogeneous diﬀerential equation has a solution of the form x = tα for
some α ∈R.
If we put x = tα, we get for the homogeneous equation that
t3 d2x
dt2 + 3t2 dx
dt + tx = {α(α−1)+3α+1}tα+1 = (α+1)2tα+1 = 0.
It follows that x = 1

Summing up the complete solution is

t
+ c1 · 1
t + c2 · ln t

t ∈R+,
c1, c2 arbitrary.
3) The equation is an Euler equation in disguise. In fact a division by t > 0 shows that
(10) t2 d2x
dt2 + 3tdx
dt + x = 2
t ,
t > 0,
with the characteristic polynomial for the Euler equation (R +1)2. Since R = −1 is a double root,
we guess that the complete solution of the homogeneous equation is
x = c1 · 1
t + c2 · ln t
t ,
t > 0.
Check. Clearly, 1/t and (ln t)/t are linearly independent. We have already proved that 1/t is a
solutions. Then put x = (ln t)/t. We have
dx
dt = 1 −ln t
t2
and
d2x
dt2 = 2 ln t −3
t3
,
hence by insertion into the diﬀerential equation,
t3 d2x
dt2 + 3t2 dx
dt + tx = (2 ln t−3)+3(1−ln t)+ln t = 0,
and (ln t)/t also fulﬁls the homogeneous diﬀerential equation, and the claim is proved.
Then we guess a particular solution of (10). The apparently obvious choice c/t does not apply,
because it is already a solution of the homogeneous equation.
The same is true for c(ln t)/t.
Therefore, we try instead with x = c · x0, where x0 = (ln t)2/t.
Check. If x0 = (ln t)2/t, then
dx0
dt = −1
t2 (ln t)2 + 2 ln t
t2
= −(ln t)2 + 2 ln t
t2
and
d2x0
dt2 = 2
t3 {(ln t)2−2 ln t}+ 1
t3 {−2 ln t+2} = 1
t3 {2(ln t)2−6 ln t+2}.
These expressions are put into the left hand side of the original equation,
t3 d2x0
dt2 + 3t2 dx0
dt + tx0 = 2(ln t)2 −6 ln t + 2 −3(ln t)2 + 6 ln t + (ln t)2 = 2,

which is precisely the right hand side of the equation, so c = 1, and x0 is a particular solution.

hence by a reduction,
d2x

du + x = 2e−u.
This equation has constant coeﬃcients. The characteristic polynomial R2 + 2R + 1 = (R + 1)2 has
R = −1 as a double root. The complete solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation is
x = c1e−u + c2ue−u,
u ∈R;
c1, c2 arbitrary.
We can ﬁnd a particular solution in various ways:
a) Guessing. Suppose that x = u2e−u. Then
dx
du = (−u2 + 2u)e−u
and
d2x
du2 = (u2 −4u + 2)e−u.
Then by insertion,
d2x
du2 + 2dx
du + x = (u2 −4u + 2)e−u + 2(−u2 + 2u)e−u + u2e−u = 2e−u,
proving that x = u2e−u is a particular solution.
b) Alternative solution. Since Ω(u) = exp(

2 du) = e2u, a particular solution is given by
x = e−u


(e−u)2e2u (

e−ue2u · 2 · e−udu)du = e−u

{

2 du}du = e−u

2u du = u2e−u.
c) Alternative solution. If we put x1 = e−u and x2 = ue−u, then the corresponding Wro´nskian
is
W(u) =

2u du = 2u2e−u −u2e−u = u2e−u.

Example 2.4 Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
t2 d2x
dt2 −2tdx
dt + 2x = 2t2,
t ∈R+.
Type: An Euler diﬀerential equation. The equation is solved below in three diﬀerent variants.
1) The standard method. If we change variable u = ln t, t = eu, then it follows that the equation
is equivalent to the inhomogeneous diﬀerential equation
d2x
du2 −3dx
du + 2x = 2e2u

of second order and of constant coeﬃcients. The corresponding characteristic equation,
λ2 −3λ + 2 = (λ −1)(λ −2) = 0,
has the solutions λ1 = 1 and λ2 = 2, so we conclude that the homogeneous equation has the
complete solution
x = c1eu + c2e2u = c1t + c2t2,
c1, c2 ∈R;
t ∈R+.
Then we can either ﬁnd a particular solution by guessing or by using the Wro´nskian method.
a) Guessing. The right hand side 2e2u is a solution of the homogeneous equation. We therefore
guess on x = c · ue2u instead. Then
x = cue2u,
dx
du = 2cue2u+ce2u,
d2x
dt2 = 4cue2u+4ce2u,
which give by insertion
d2x
du2 −3dx
du + 2x = 4cue2u+4ce2u−6cue2u−3ce2u+2cue2u = ce2u.
This is equal to 2e2u, if c = 2. Hence a particular solution is e.g. x = 2ue2u, and then we get
by the linearity the complete solution (where u = ln t),
x = 2t2 ln t + c1t + c2t2,
c1, c2 ∈R;
t ∈R+.
b) The Wro´nskian method. If we put
ϕ1(u) = eu
and
ϕ2(u) = e2u,
then the Wro´nskian is
W(u) =

ϕ1
ϕ2
ϕ′
1
ϕ′
2
 =

eu
e2u
eu
2e2u
 = e3u.
Then a particular solution is given by
ϕ0(u)
=
ϕ2(u)
 ϕ1(u)q(u)
W(u)
du −ϕ1(u)
 ϕ2(u)q(u)

du


2 du −eu

2eu du = 2ue2u −2e2n
=
2t2 ln t −2t2.
Since −2t2 already is a solution of the homogeneous equation, the complete solution is given
by
x = 2t2 ln t + c1t + c2t2,
c1, c2 ∈R;
t ∈R+.

2) Guessing. If we put x = tn into the Euler diﬀerential equation, then
t2 d2x
dt2 −2tdx
dt + 2x = {n(n−1)−2n+2}tn = (n−1)(n−2)tn.
This expression is equal to 0 when n = 1 and n = 2. Since t1 = t and t2 are linearly independent,
it follows from the existence and uniqueness theorem for linear diﬀerential equations that the
complete solution of the homogeneous equation is
x = c1t + c2t2,
c1, c2 ∈R;
t ∈R+.
Here the right hand side is a solution of the homogeneous equation, so we guess instead a particular
solution of the form x = c · t2 ln t, t ∈R+. Then
x = ct2 ln t,
dx
dt = 2ct ln t,
d2x
dt2 = 2c ln t + 3c,
which is put into the Euler diﬀerential equation, giving
t2 d2x
dt2 −2tdx
dt + 2x = 2ct2 ln t + 3ct2 −4ct2 ln t −2ct2 + 2xt2 ln t = ct2.
This expression is equal to 2t2, when c = 2. Then it follows from the linearity that the complete
solution is

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Prove that y = t−2, t ∈R+, is a solution, and then ﬁnd the complete solution.

Example 2.6 Consider the diﬀerential equation
(12) td2y
dt2 −(t + 1)dy
dt + y = 0,
t ∈R+.
1) Prove that (12) has the solution y = et, t ∈R+, and ﬁnd then the complete solution.
2) Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
td2y
dt2 −(t + 1)dy
dt + y = t2,
t ∈R+.
1) a) If we put y = et into (12), then
tet −(t + 1)et + et = 0,
and we see that y = et satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation so y1(t) = et.
b) Then we norm the equation (note that we have assumed that t > 0),
d2y

2) a) Guessing. When we count the degrees, we see that if y is a polynomial of degree n, then the
left hand side of (12) is again a polynomial of degree n. Hence we guess on
y = at2 + bt + c,
where dy
dt = 2at + b and d2y
dt2 = 2a.
Then by insertion into the left hand side of the equation,
td2y
dt2 −(t+1)dy
dt +y
=
2at−(t+1)(2at+b)+at2+bt+c = −at2+(2a−b−2a+b)t+c−b
=
−at2 + c −b.
This expression is equal to t2, when
a = −1
and
b = c.
Now b = c corresponds to
bt + c = b(t + 1),
which is a solution of the homogeneous equation. Hence the complete solution of the inhomo-
geneous equation is
y = −t2 + c1et + c2(t + 1),
t > 0,
c1, c2 arbitrære,
because we can include b = c into the constant c2.

Remark 2.5 Warning. If we forget to norm the equation, then we get the wrong solution
˜y0(t) = · · · = −t2
2 (t + 1) + (−t2 −3t −3).
A check in the equation shows that this is not a solution.
Remark 2.6 The equation can in principle be solved by means of the power series method,
and the result looks apparently nice. We get for instance for the homogeneous equation
(12) after some computations,
∞

n=0
(n −1){(n + 1)an+1 −an}tn = 0,
hence by the identity theorem
(n −1){(n + 1)an+1 −an} = 0
for n ∈N0,
(the summation domain). There is, however, a trap here because n −1 = 0 for n = 1, thus
0 · {2a2 −a1} = 0
for n = 1.
This equation is fulﬁlled for all choices of the constants a1 and a2, so we conclude that a1 are
a2 the arbitrary constants. The trap is, that we cannot get this result if we ﬁrst divide by
n −1 to obtain
(n + 1)an+1 = an.
The error is of course that we divide by 0, when n = 1.
The correct variant is
(n + 1)an+1 = an
for n ∈N0 \ {1},
where a1 and a2 are arbitrary constants. It is possible to solve this equation, but it requires
some deftness. The trick is to multiply by n! and then deﬁne bn := n!an).

Example 2.7 Consider the diﬀerential equation
(13) td2y

dt −(t + 1)y = 0,

1) Prove that (13) has the solution y = e−t, t ∈R+, and then ﬁnd the complete solution.
2) Find the complete solution of the diﬀerential equation
td2y
dt2 −dy
dt −(t + 1)y = t2,
t ∈R+.
The equation can be solved in diﬀerent ways. We ﬁrst demonstrate the traditional one:
1) If we put y = e−t, then
te−t + e−t −(t + 1)e−t = 0,
and y = e−t is a solution of the homogeneous equation.
2) By norming the inhomogeneous equation we get

The complete solution of the homogeneous equation is
y = c1e−t + c2(2t −1)et,
c1, c2 arbitrary.
There are several ways to ﬁnd a particular solution of the inhomogeneous equation.
a) Guessing. If we put y = at + b, then
td2y
dt2 −dy
dt −(t+1) = −a−(t+1)(at+b) = −at2−(a+b)t−(a+b).
This expression is equal to t2, if a = −1 and b = 1. The complete solution is
y(t) = 1 −t + c1e−t + c2tet(2t −1).
b) Computation by a solution formula. We ﬁrst identify u(t) = t, cf. the normed equation,

Finally, it is possible also to solve the equation directly by some clever tricks.
Since y = e−t is a solution of the simpler equation dy
dt +y = 0, the idea is to rewrite the equation (13)
as a diﬀerential equation of ﬁrst order in z = dy
dt + y. When we add tdy

The exponential matrix
Example 3.1 Find exp(tA) in each of the following cases.
(1) A =

−4
0
0
5

,
(2) A =
⎛

(3) A =
 1


,
(4) A =
 1


.
1) Since A is a diagonal matrix, we immediately get
exp(tA) =

e−4t

e5t

.
2) We here ﬁnd for the same reason,
exp(tA) =
⎛
⎝
et
0

e3t

⎠.
3) The eigenvalues are the roots of the polynomial

1 −λ
−5
1
−1 −λ
 = λ2 −1 + 5 = λ2 + 4,
hence λ = ±2i. Since the roots are imaginary and complex conjugated, we ﬁrst compute

Then it follows by the deﬁnition of the exponential series that

Example 3.2 The matrix

properties of the columns in a matrix of the form exp(tA).
It follows from

and


that the matrix can be written in the form exp(tA).
Then we can ﬁnd the matrix A in various ways:
1) We ﬁnd by a diﬀerentiation,
d
dt exp(tA) = A exp(tA) =

.
By putting t = 0, we get

2) (“The hint”). The equation dx

Example 3.3 Find by means of the eigenvalue method the complete solution of
dx

x(t).
Then ﬁnd exp(tA).
Clearly, the eigenvalues are λ1 = 1 and λ2 = −2. The corresponding eigenvectors are cross vectors of
the ﬁrst row (1 −λ, 1), thus a possibility is
λ1 = 1,
v1 = (1, λ1 −1) = (1, 0),
λ2 = −2,
v2 = (1, λ2 −1) = (1, −3).
The complete solution is

There are now a couple of ways to ﬁnd the exponential matrix exp(tA).
1) First note that exp(At) = Φ(t)[Φ(0)]−1. Since
Φ(t) =
 et

,
we have
Φ(0) =

.
2) Deﬁnition by a series. Since A and I commute, we obtain by subtracting λ1I = I and then
adding it again,
exp(At) = exp((A −I)t + It) = et exp(Bt),
where
B = A −I =

Example 3.4 Find the complete solution of the given system below

The eigenvalues are the roots of the polynomial

1−λ
4
−2
−3−λ
=(λ−1)(λ+3)+8=λ2+2λ+5=(λ+1)2+4,
thus λ = −1 ± 2i. since we have complex conjugated eigenvalues, we have at least four reasonable
methods of solution.
1) The eigenvalue method. If λ = −1 + 2i, then the corresponding eigenvector is a cross vector of
(2 −2i, 4), e.g.
v =

3) It follows from λ = −1 ± 2i, that the real structure of solution necessarily must be of the form


we obtain by an identiﬁcation of the coeﬃcients that

−a1 + 2a2 = a1 + 4b1,
dvs. b1 = −1
2a1 + 1
2a2,
−b1 + 2b2 = −2a1 −3b1,
dvs. b1 + b2 = −a1.
We see that
b2 = −1
2a1 −1
2a2
and
b1 = −1
2a1 + 1
2a2.
If we put a1 = 2c1 and a2 = 2c2, then the solution is given by

4) The “fumbling method”. It follows from

thus x2 = 1

and
dx2

that

hence by a rearrangement,
d2x1
dt2 + 2dx1
dt + 5x1 = 0,
where R2 + 2R + 5 = (R + 1)2 + 22.
The complete solution is

Then compute by means of the general solution formula the particular solution (x, y) of the system,
for which

1) Direct determination of exp(At). First we note by induction that

that

.
2) Variant of the eigenvalue method. Clearly, λ = 1 has algebraic multiplicity 2 and geometrical
multiplicity 1. Therefore the complete solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation must
have the structure



=


where

=
 (a1 + b1)et + (a2 + b2)tet

.
When we identify the coeﬃcients, we get
 a1 + a2 = a1 + b1,
hence b1 = a2,
b1 + b2 = b1,
hence b2 = 0.

1) Consider the (2×2) matrix A. An eigenvector corresponding to λ is a cross vector of e.g. (1−λ, 2),
where we can choose v =


by adding the factor 1
2.
If λ = 3, then an eigenvector is v1 = (1, 1).
If λ = −3, then an eigenvector is v2 = (1, −2).

where we have given the result in two equivalent versions.
Second variant.
Direct determination of the exponential matrix. In this case it will be
convenient to interchange the two questions of the example.

2) The complete solution is obtained by taking all the possible linear combinations of the columns of
exp(At). The common factor 1
3 can be included in the arbitrary constants, so
x(t)
=


2e3t + e−3t
2e3t −2e−3t

+ c2

where t ∈R, and where c1, c2, ˜c1 and ˜c2 are arbitrary constants.
Third variant. The exponential matrix computed by a formula. Here we only show (2).
Since n = 2 and the eigenvalues are λ = 3 and μ = −3 , thus λ ̸= μ, we get
exp(At)
=
eλt −eμt
λ −μ
A + λeμt −μeλt
λ −μ

6(e3t −e−3t)A + 1
6(3e−3t + 3e3t)I

3 sinh(3t)A + cosh(3t)I,
and the example is then concluded as in one of the other variants.

Fourth variant. The fumbling method. We ﬁrst expand the system of equations,
dx1
dt = x1 + 2x2,
thus 2x2 = dx1
dt −x1,
dx2
dt = 4x1 −x2,
thus d
dt(2x2) + 2x2 = 8x1.
By eliminating x2 we get
d
dt(2x2) + 2x2 =
d2x1
dt2 −dx1
dt

+
dx1
dt −x1

= d2x1
dt2 −x1 = 8x1,
hence
d2x1
dt2 −9x1 = 0
med R2 −9 = (R + 3)(R −3) = 0.
The complete solution is
x1 = c1e3t + c2e−3t,
c1, c2 arbitrary,
so by insertion,
2x2 = dx1
dt −x1 = (3c1e3t −3c2e−3t) −(c1e3t + c2e−3t) = 2c1e3t −4c2e−3t,
thus
x2 = c1e3t −2c2e−3t,
where c1 and c2 are the same arbitrary constants as for x1.
Summing up we have
 x1
x2

=
 c1e3t + c2e−3t
c1e3t −2c2e−3t

= c1e3t
 1
1

+ c2e−3t
 1
−2

,
where c1 and c2 are arbitrary constants.
Then we continue as in the ﬁrst variant.
Fifth variant. Caley-Hamilton’s theorem. Recall that the characteristic polynomial is λ2 −9.
Then we get by Caley-Hamilton’s theorem that
A2 −9I = 0,
thus A2 = 9I.
This implies that there exist functions ϕ(t) and ψ(t), such that
exp(At) = ϕ(t)I + ψ(t)A,
ϕ(0) = 1 og ψ(0) = 0.
We then conclude from
d
dt exp(At) = A exp(At)
The exponential matrix

and
d
dt exp(At) = ϕ′(t)I + ψ′(t)A,
and
A exp(At) = ϕ(t)A + ψ(t)A2 = 9ψ(t)I + ϕ(t)A,
by identifying the coeﬃcients of I and A that
(15) ϕ′(t) = 9ψ(t)
and
ψ′(t) = ϕ(t),
where

ϕ(0) = 1,
ϕ′(0) = 9ψ(0) = 0,
ψ(0) = 0,
ψ′(t) = ϕ(0) = 1.
If we put the latter equation of (15) into the ﬁrst one, i.e. eliminating ϕ(t), then
ψ′′(t) = 9ψ(t),
ψ(0) = 0,
ψ′(0) = 1,

The complete solution is
ψ(t) = c1 sinh(3t) + c2 cosh(3t).
We conclude from ψ(0) = 0 that c2 = 0, and from ψ′(0) = 1 that c1 = 1
3, so
ψ(t) = 1
3 sinh(3t).
Finally,
ϕ(t) = ψ′(t) = cosh(3t),
so summing up,
exp(At) = ϕ(t)I + ψ(t)A = cosh(3t)I + 1
3 sinh(3t)A,
and we continue as in anyone of the previous variants.
Example 3.8 Let A =

1) Find the complete solution of the homogeneous system of diﬀerential equations,

which corresponds to the system of equations

The initial condition gives ˜c1 = ˜c2 = 0, hence the solution is

a) The eigenvalue method. The characteristic polynomial is

0−λ
−1
2
−3−λ
 = λ(λ+3)+2 = λ2+3λ+2 = (λ+1)(λ+2),
so the eigenvalues are λ = −1 and λ = −2. A corresponding eigenvector is a cross vector of
(−λ, −1), thus e.g. (1, −λ).
If λ = −1, then an eigenvector is v1 = (1, 1).
If λ = −2, then an eigenvector is v2 = (1, 2).

Example 4.3 Let

be any (2 × 2) matrix, and let
p(λ) = det(A−λI) = λ2−(a+d)λ+(ad−bc) = (λ−λ1)(λ−λ2)
be the corresponding characteristic polynomial. Prove that
p(A) := (A −λ1I)(A −λ2I) = 0.
When we identify the coeﬃcients of the characteristic polynomial we get
λ1 + λ2 = a + d
and
λ1λ2 = ad −bc.
A computation of p(A) gives

exp(At) = ϕ(t)I + ψ(t)A,
where ϕ(0) = 1 and ψ(0) = 0.
1) It follows from Example 4.3 that
p(A) = (A−λI)(A−μI) = A2−(λ+μ)A+λμI = 0.
Then by a rearrangement,
A2 = (λ + μ)A −λμI.

where the radius of convergence is ∞.
According to (1) every An, n ≥2, can be written as a linear combination of I and A, by using
the recursion formula
An = A2 An−2 = (λ + μ)An−1 −λμAn−2,
n ≥2.
The coeﬃcients only increase as a polynomial, while the denominator n! is of factorial size. There-
fore, this process cannot change the radius of convergence, so we conclude that exp(At) can also
be written as a linear combination of I and A, where the coeﬃcients ϕ(t) and ψ(t) are given by
power series in t of radius of convergence ∞,
exp(At) = ϕ(t)I + ψ(t)A.
If we here put t = 0, then
exp(A0) = I = ϕ(0)I + ψ(0)A,
and it follows that ϕ(0) = 1 and ψ(0) = 0, because we may assume that I and A are linearly
independent. (There is nothing to prove if this is not the case).

Example 4.5 Let A be a (2 × 2) matrix. We proved in Example 4.4 that
A2 = (λ + μ)A −λμI,
and
exp(At) = ϕ(t)I + ψ(t)A,
ϕ(0) = 1 and ψ(0) = 0.
Prove that ϕ and ψ are the unique solutions of the system of equations
⎧
⎨
⎩
ϕ′(t) = −λμψ(t),
ϕ′′(t) = (λ+μ)ϕ′(t)−λμϕ(t) = 0,
ϕ(0) = 1, ψ(0) = 0.
Then ﬁnd exp(At) explicitly.
Hint: Split the investigation into the to cases (1) λ ̸= μ, and (2) λ = μ.
We shall only check the diﬀerential equation for exp(At),

Since
d
dt exp(At) = ϕ′(t)I + ψ′(t)A
and
A exp(At) = ϕ(t)A + ψ(t)A2 = (λ + μ)ψ(t)A −ψ(t)λμI + ϕ(t)A,
it follows by identiﬁcation of the coeﬃcients that
ϕ′(t) = −λμψ(t),
ψ′(t) = (λ+μ)ψ(t)+ϕ(t),
ϕ′(0) = −λμψ(0) = 0,
ψ′(0) = 0 + ϕ(0) = 1.
When the latter equation is diﬀerentiated, we get
ψ′′(t) = (λ+μ)ψ′(t)+ϕ′(t) = (λ+μ)ψ′(t)−λμψ(t),
hence by a rearrangement,
d2ψ
dt2 −(λ+μ)dψ
dt +λμψ(t) = 0,
ψ(0) = 0, ψ′(0) = 1,
and of course
ϕ′(t) = −λμψ(t),
ϕ(0) = 1.
The characteristic polynomial for the diﬀerential equation of ψ is
R2 −(λ + μ)R + λμ = (R −λ)(R −μ),
with the roots λ and μ.

1) If λ ̸= μ, then
ψ(t) = c1eλt + c2eμt

hence c1 =

We have found that

where ψ(0) = c1 = 0,
and
ψ′(t) = c2eλt + c2λteλt,
where ψ′(0) = c2 = 1.
Then
ψ(t) = teλt.
Now, ϕ′(t) = −λ2ψ(t) and ψ(0) = 1, so

Example 4.6 Let A be a (2 × 2) matrix, the characteristic polynomial of which has the root λ of
multiplicity 2. Compute exp(At) by using that
exp(At) = exp(λtI+(A−λI)t) = eλt exp((A−λI)t).
When λ is a double root, then the characteristic polynomial is (R −λ)2, and it follows from either
Cayley-Hamilton’s theorem or Example 4.3 that
(A −λI)2 = 0.
Then


n=2

n!(A −λI)ntn = I + (A −λI)t + 0 = (1 −λt)I + tA,
and hence
exp(At) = eλt exp((A −λI)t) = (1 −λt)eλtI + teλtA,
cf. the result of Example 4.5 (2).
Example 4.7 Let A be a (2 × 2) matrix, the characteristic polynomial of which has the root λ of
multiplicity 2. Prove that
Φ(t) = eλtI + teλt(A −λI)
is a solution of
dΦ
dt = A Φ(t),
Φ(0) = I,
and conclude that
exp(At) = eλtI + teλt(A −λI).
Since
dΦ
dt = λeλtI + (1 + λt)eλt(A −λI) = −λ2teλtI + (1 + λt)eλtA
and
A Φ(t)
=
eλtA + teλt(A −λI)(A −λI + λI) = eλtA + λteλt(A −λI)
=
−λ2teλtI + (1 + λt)eλtA,
it follows that
dΦ
dt = A Φ(t).
Since
Φ(0) = I + 0 · e0(A −λI) = I,

the initial conditions are also fulﬁlled. Due to the uniqueness the only solution is exp(At), so
exp(At) = eλtI + teλt(A −λI).
Example 4.8 Let A be a (3 × 3) matrix, the characteristic polynomial of which p(x) = (x −λ)3 has

hence Φ(t) also satisﬁes the matrix diﬀerential equation

Φ(0) = I.
Now, the exponential matrix is the unique solution of this matrix diﬀerential equation, so we
conclude that

λ−μI = I,
it follows that Φ(t) fulﬁls the same initial conditions as exp(At). Since this solution is unique, we
conclude that
Φ(t) = exp(At).
Example 4.10 Let A be an (n × n) matrix, the characteristic polynomial p(x) has λ as an n-tuple
root.
1) Prove that p(A) := (A −λI)n = 0.
Hint: Apply a coordinate transformation S, such that A = SΛS−1, where Λ is an upper triangular

1) By using the hint we get
(A −λI)n = (SΛS−1 −λnSIS−1)n = Sn(Λ −λI)nS−n.
Now, Λ −λI is an upper triangular matrix with only zeros in the diagonal. Hence, (Λ −λI)n = 0,
and the claim is proved.
2) Since A and I commute, and
(A −λI)j = (A −λI)n(A −λI)j−n = 0

it follows that

−(λ−1)(λ−2)(λ−3).
The eigenvalues are λ = 1, 2, 3. They are all simple.
The equations of the eigenvectors are

If λ = 1, then we can choose the eigenvector (1, 1, 1).
If λ = 2, then we can choose the eigenvector (1, 2, 3).
If λ = 3, then we can choose the eigenvector (1, 3, 4).
The complete solution of the corresponding system of diﬀerential equations is
