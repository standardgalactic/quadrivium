The Author
Danny Banks ﬁrst studied electronic engineering at Leicester Polytechnic (now
DeMontfort University), U.K., graduating in 1990 with a B.Eng. (Hons). He then
joined the University of Surrey, U.K., as a Ph.D. student. His research involved
modeling and experimental investigation of micromachined microelectrodes for
recording neural signals from peripheral nerve trunks. He was awarded his Ph.D.
in 1995. Subsequently, he was employed as a postdoctoral research fellow in the
biomedical engineering group and was able to spend a further three years on this
research. From 1997 to 1999, he was employed as a postdoctoral fellow at the
European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, Germany. His work
involved the investigation of microfabricated devices for biochemical analysis of
single cells. He was also involved in the promotion of artiﬁcial microstructures
for applications in molecular biology.
Since 1999 Dr. Banks has been employed at Monisys, a small company
specializing in embedded systems, sensors, and instrumentation R&D, located in
Birmingham, U.K. He is presently technical director.
Dr. Banks is a member of the Institute of Electrical Engineers (IEE), the
Society for Experimental Biology of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (IEEE) and Euroscience.

Micromachining
I.1. INTRODUCTION
I.1.1
WHAT IS MICROENGINEERING?
Microengineering and Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) have very few
watertight deﬁnitions regarding their subjects and technologies. Microengineering
can be described as the techniques, technologies, and practices involved in the
realization of structures and devices with dimensions on the order of micrometers.
MEMS often refer to mechanical devices with dimensions on the order of
micrometers fabricated using techniques originating in the integrated circuit (IC)
industry, with emphasis on silicon-based structures and integrated microelectronic
circuitry. However, the term is now used to refer to a much wider range of
microengineered devices and technologies.
There are other terms in common use that cover the same subject with slightly
different emphasis. Microsystems technology (MST) is a term that is commonly
used in Europe. The emphasis tends towards the development of systems, and
the use of different technologies to fabricate components that are then combined
into a system or device is more of a feature of MST than MEMS, where the
emphasis tends towards silicon technologies.
In Japan, particularly, the term micromachines is employed. There is a ten-
dency toward miniaturization of machines, with less emphasis on the technologies
or materials employed. This should not be confused with micromachining, the
processes of fabricating microdevices.
The most rigorous deﬁnition available was proposed by the British govern-
ment, which deﬁned the term microengineering as working to micrometer
tolerances. An analogous deﬁnition for nanotechnology was advanced.
Although these deﬁnitions can be used effectively for policy setting, for exam-
ple, they tend to lead to some anomalies: very large precision-engineered
components that one would not normally consider to be MEMS were being
classiﬁed as such. For this reason, the deﬁnition tends to be used with qualiﬁ-
cations in technical literature.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
This volume will attempt to standardize the deﬁnitions for this technology
given in the glossary for microengineering and MEMS:
Microengineering: The techniques, technologies, and practices involved
in the realization of structures and devices with dimensions on the order
of micrometers
MEMS: Microengineered devices that convert between electrical and any
other form of energy and rely principally on their three-dimensional
mechanical structure for their operation
In this way, microengineering is a very broad term, as one may expect. It not
only covers MEMS but also IC fabrication and more conventional microelectron-
ics. As a rule of thumb, devices in which most of the features (gap or line width,
step height, etc.) are at or below 100 µm fulﬁll the “dimensions in the order of
micrometers” criteria.
The deﬁnition of MEMS as transducers means that the term can be used a
little more generally than other deﬁnitions would allow. For instance, infrared
displays that use suspended structures to thermally isolate each pixel ﬁt nicely
into this deﬁnition as their operation relies on the three-dimensional suspended
structure even though there is no moving mechanical element to the device. It
does, however, exclude devices such as Hall effect sensors or photodiodes,
which rely principally on their electrical (or chemical) structure for their oper-
ation. It also tends to exclude semiconductor lasers for similar reasons, and
components such as power MOSFET transistors that are formed by etching V
grooves into the silicon substrate are also excluded as they are purely electrical
devices.
Once one is happy with the term microengineering, one can create all the
relevant subdisciplines that one requires simply by taking the conventional dis-
cipline name and adding the preﬁx micro to it. Thus, we have microﬂuidics,
micromechanics, microlithography, micromachining, etc., and, of course, micro-
electronics. This ﬂippant comment does not mean that these disciplines are simply
the macroscale discipline with smaller numbers entered into the equations. In
many cases this can be done, but in others this can cause erroneous results. It is
intended to point out that there are relatively few surprises in the nomenclature.
At this point, it is worth highlighting the difference between science and
engineering as it is of considerable import to the microengineer. Science aims to
understand the universe and build a body of knowledge that describes how the
universe operates. Engineering is the practical application of science to the beneﬁt
of humankind. The description of the universe compiled by scientists is often so
complex that it is too unwieldy to be practically applied. Engineers, therefore,
take more convenient chunks of this knowledge that apply to the situation with
which they are concerned. Speciﬁcally, engineers employ models that are limited.
For example, when calculating the trajectory of a thrown ball, Newton’s laws
of motion would normally be used, and no one would bother to consider how
Einstein’s relativity would affect the trajectory: the ball is unlikely to be traveling

at a relativistic speed where a signiﬁcant effect may be expected (a substantial
fraction of the speed of light).
A good engineering course teaches not only the models that the student needs
to employ, and how to employ them, but also the limitations of those models.
The knowledge that models are limited is of signiﬁcance in microengineering
because the discipline is still compiling a family of models and list of pitfalls.
Despite the vast body of literature on the subject, there is still far more anecdotal
knowledge available than written information. This is evidenced by the substantial
trafﬁc that MEMS mailing lists and discussion groups receive. There is only so
much that can be achieved by reading and modeling, and even a little experience
of the practice is of great beneﬁt.
I.1.2
WHY IS MICROENGINEERING IMPORTANT?
The inspiration for nanotechnology, particularly molecular nanotechnology, is usu-
ally traced back to Richard Feynman’s presentation entitled “There’s Plenty of Room
at the Bottom” in 1959 [1]. A few people cite this presentation as the inspiration for
the ﬁeld of microengineering, but it is more likely that it was the seminal paper by
Kurt Petersen, “Silicon as a Mechanical Material,” published in 1982 [2].
The micromachining of silicon for purposes other than the creation of elec-
tronic components was certainly being carried out at least a decade before
Petersen published this work, which compiled a variety of disparate threads and
technologies into something that was starting to look like a new technology. Not
only was silicon micromachining in existence at this time, but many of the other
techniques that will be discussed in later chapters of this volume were also being
used for specialized precision engineering work. However, despite the appearance
of some early devices, it was not until the end of that decade that commercial
exploitation of microengineering, as evidenced by the number of patents issued [3],
started to take off.
At the beginning of the 1990s, microengineering was presented as a revolu-
tionary technology that would have as great an impact as the microchip. It
promised miniaturized intelligent devices that would offer unprecedented accu-
racy and resolution and negligible power consumption. Batch fabrication would
provide us with these devices at negligible costs: few dollars, or even just a few
cents, for a silicon chip. The technology would permeate all areas of life: the
more adventurous projects proposed micromachines that would enter the blood-
stream and effect repairs, or examine the interior of nuclear reactors in minute
detail for the telltale signs of impending failure. As with many emerging tech-
nologies, some of the early predictions were wildly optimistic. Although some
of the adventurous projects proposed during this period remain inspirational for
technological development, the market has tended to be dominated by a few
applications — notably IT applications such as inkjet printer heads and hard disk
drive read–write heads. Pressure measurement appears next on the list; some may
intuitively feel that these devices, rather than inkjet printer heads, are more in
tune with the spirit of microengineering.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
Nonetheless, microengineered devices have signiﬁcant advantages and poten-
tial advantages over other solutions. Although the road to mass production and
low-cost devices is long and expensive, the destination can be reached; examine,
for example, the plethora of mass-produced silicon accelerometers and pressure
sensors. Beyond the direct advantages of miniaturization, integrating more intel-
ligence into a single component brings with it improved reliability: the fewer
components that need to be assembled into a system, the less chance there is that
it can go wrong. One great advantage of microengineering is that new tools
providing solutions to problems that have never been addressed before are still
to be fully exploited. The technology is still relatively new, and innovative think-
ing can potentially bring some startling results.
There is, however, a reason for the aforementioned cautious historical pre-
amble: market surveys are often conducted by groups with a particular interest
in the technology or by those interested in showing the economy in a positive
light. Evidence is often collected from people working in the ﬁeld or companies
that have invested a lot of R&D dollars into the technology. The preamble thus
sets the following data in context.
It is undeniable that microengineering has had a substantial impact beyond
disk drives and printers. The sensors and transducers section of any commercial
electronics catalog reveals a dozen or so microengineered devices including
accelerometers, air-mass-ﬂow sensors, and pressure transducers. (Surprisingly,
however, the electronics engineer may not be aware of the technological
advances that have gone into these devices). The molecular biologist cannot
help but be aware of the plethora of DNA chip technologies, and the material
scientist cannot have missed the micromachined atomic force microscope
(AFM) probe.
In the mid 1990s a number of different organizations compiled market growth
projections for the following few years. These were conveniently collected and
summarized by Detlefs and Pisano [3]. The European NEXUS (Network of
Excellence for Multifunctional Microsystems) has been particularly active in this
respect, publishing a report in 1998 [4] with a follow-up study appearing in 2002
[5]. Also, in 2002, the U.S.-based MEMS Industry Group published its own report
[6]. The absolute numbers for the global market in such reports vary depending
on how that market is deﬁned. The NEXUS task force included all products with
a MEMS component, whereas the other groups only considered the individual
components themselves. The NEXUS 2002 report estimated the world market to

have been worth approximately $30 billions in 2000, whereas the U.S.-based
MEMS Industry Group estimated it to be in the region of $2 billions to $5 billions.
From the published summaries, it would appear that a growth of 20% per annum
would be a conservative estimate for the coming few years. It should be noted,
however, that many of these estimates are based on the highly volatile optical
communications and IT markets, where optical MEMS in particular are expected
to make a signiﬁcant impact.
Detlefs and Pisano highlight microﬂuidics and RF MEMS, apart from optical
MEMS, as having signiﬁcant potential for growth. This being in contrast to the
10 to 20% growth that they ascribe to more established microengineered sensors
(pressure, acceleration, etc.). This assessment is in concordance with the NEXUS
2002 ﬁndings, where IT peripherals and biomedical areas are identiﬁed as having
the most signiﬁcant growth potential.
I.1.3
HOW CAN I MAKE MONEY OUT OF MICROENGINEERING?
This is not a book that intends to give ﬁnancial business or other moneymaking
advice. It was inspired, in part at least, by the recognition that there is a growing
market and opportunities for microengineered products, and in order to exploit
these it is necessary to have some understanding of the technology. This book
deals with the technologies involved in microengineering, so pithy observations
about their potential exploitation are restricted to the introduction.
Firstly, nearly all the processes involved in micromachining involve a signif-
icant capital outlay in terms of clean rooms, processing equipment, and hazardous
chemicals. In the past this has restricted novel developments to those that had or
could afford the facilities or to those using lower-cost micromachining technol-
ogies. Multiproject processes, where designs from several different groups are
fabricated on the same substrate (wafer) using the same process, are now avail-
able. This cuts the cost, but limits you to a speciﬁc fabrication sequence. One
other option, if you happen to be in an area with a high density of small (R&D)
clean room facilities, is to try out your designs by shipping your batch of wafers
to as many laboratories as possible.
R&D, however, has not tended to be the bottleneck in commercial exploita-
tion. The main bottleneck has been in scaling up from prototype volumes to mass
production volumes. Much of the processing equipment is quite idiosyncratic
and needs to be characterized and monitored to ensure that the vast majority
of the devices coming off the line meet the speciﬁcations (process monitoring).
Furthermore, parameters that are required for good electrical performance may
result in undesirable mechanical characteristics. In short, it is highly likely that

a new line will have to be set up and characterized for the product, and unlike
IC foundries, it is difﬁcult to adapt the line for the production of different devices.
Additionally, if a silicon device is required with integrated electronic circuitry,
the micromachining and circuit fabrication processes must be fully compatible
and may be intertwined.
If you are really serious about getting your microengineered device into the
market, and have the money to set up a fabrication facility (fab), one of your best
options is probably to work with a company (or organization) that has its own
facility and is willing to work with others (a MEMS foundry). Usually these will
be companies that already produce a few microengineered products of their own,
rather than companies set up for the sole purpose of providing micromachining
facilities to other parties. At the time of publication, there were a few (but a
growing number of) these companies that were genuinely willing to collaborate
in product development. Even if you have your own small R&D facility and are
serious about producing marketable devices, it would probably be a good idea to
ﬁnd a few of these companies at an early stage in development and align your
R&D with their processes. Also, make use of their expertise — this will almost
certainly save you a lot of headaches.
Packaging is another area that has often been neglected during device R&D.
Most microengineered devices will need to interface with the outside world in a
way beyond the simple electrical connections of integrated circuits. This will
typically require the development of some specialized packages with appropriate
tubes, ports, or lenses. The device itself will be exposed to the environment,
which can contain all sorts of nasty surprises that are not found within a research
laboratory. These surprises include obvious problems, such as dust, bubbles, or
other contaminants in microﬂuidic systems, and the less obvious problems, such
as air (many resonant devices are ﬁrst tested in an electron microscope under
vacuum — air can damp them sufﬁciently to prevent their working and packaging
devices under vacuum can be problematical). Other unexpected problems include
mechanical or other interactions with the package. Differential coefﬁcients of
thermal expansion between device and package can put transducers under strain,
leading to erroneous results. Once again, resonant sensors are particularly sensi-
tive to the mechanical properties of the package and to the mounting of dies
within it.

Packaging and associated assembly stages are easily the most expensive of
any fabrication process. At this stage, each die must be handled individually, as
opposed to a hundred or more devices on each wafer during the earlier micro-
machining stages. Thus, the time spent handling individual dies should be kept
to a minimum and automated as much as possible.
A thing to note is that although mass production of microengineered devices
can potentially reduce their cost, the amount of R&D effort involved will probably
make it necessary to sell early versions at a premium in order to recover costs.
It pays, therefore, to be well aware of your market before investing in R&D.
The ideal thing to do is treat a microengineering technology as any other
technology: ﬁrst identify the problem and then select the most appropriate tech-
nology to solve it. Of course, identifying the most appropriate technology does
assume awareness of the technologies that are available.

1 Photolithography
1.1 INTRODUCTION
The fundamental aim of microengineering — to take a design from a computer
aided design (CAD) software package and manifest it in a physical manner — may
be achieved through one of a number of different fabrication or micromachining
technologies. Many of these technologies employ a process known generally as
photolithography, or a variation of this process, to transfer a two-dimensional
pattern from a mask into the structural material. The mask is created from the data
held by the CAD package, and the structure is built up by a series of steps that
involve the deposition (addition of material to the structure) and etching (removing
material from the structure) of patterned layers.
The term photolithography refers to a process that uses light or optical
techniques to transfer the pattern from the mask to the structural material. Typ-
ically, it will refer to a process that employs ultraviolet (UV) light, but it may
informally be employed to refer to other lithographic processes or lithography,
generally, within the context of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and
micromachining. Other processes may employ electrons or x-rays.
The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the common forms of lithography,
focusing on UV photolithography. Electron-beam (e-beam) and x-ray lithography,
as well as some key design matters and processes related to photolithography,
are introduced. This chapter is complemented by the matters discussed in Chapter
4 pertaining to mask design.
Features of Photolithography for MEMS
There are a number of features common in MEMS fabrication processes but
that are not as common in integrated circuit (IC) fabrication; these are:
•
Nonplanar substrate (i.e., relatively large three-dimensional features,
such as pits)
•
The use of thick resist layers (for structural purposes or for long
etching times)
•
Relatively high-aspect-ratio structures (in resists as well as sub-
strates)
•
Relatively large feature sizes (cf. IC processes)
•
Unusual processing steps
•
Unusual materials (particularly important in terms of adhesion)

1.2 UV PHOTOLITHOGRAPHY
UV photolithography is the workhorse of many micromachining processes and
nearly all semiconductor IC manufacturing processes. With the continual demand
for reduced transistor sizes and line widths from IC designers and manufacturers,
UV lithography is being pushed to its physical limit to achieve features (line
widths or gaps) with submicrometer dimensions. Generally, MEMS employ
relatively large structures with dimensions ranging from a few micrometers to
about 100 µm. Therefore, the techniques required to produce such small
dimensions will not be mentioned here but will be touched on in Part III of this
volume.
The basic principle of photolithography is illustrated in Figure 1.1. The aim
is to transfer a two-dimensional pattern that is formed on a mask (aka reticle,
especially when exposure systems are discussed) into a three-dimensional or two-
and-a-half-dimensional pattern in a structural material. The description “two-and-
a-half-dimensional” is used because, as you will see, although it is possible to
produce structures with complex curves in the xy plane, many micromachining
techniques only provide limited control of shapes in the vertical z dimension.
In the example in Figure 1.1, a thin ﬁlm of silicon dioxide has been deposited
on the surface of a silicon wafer. It is desired that this ﬁlm be selectively removed
FIGURE 1.1 Basic principle of photolithography (not to scale): (a) silicon substrate with

from certain areas of the wafer to expose the underlying silicon. To do this, a
mask is produced. This will typically be a chromium pattern on a glass (quartz)
plate, chromium being opaque to UV light and quartz being transparent. The
wafer is cleaned and coated with a material that is sensitive to UV light, known
as photoresist. The photoresist is exposed to UV light through the mask and then
developed, transferring the pattern from the mask into the photoresist.
There are two basic types of photoresists: positive resists and negative resists.
(These are also known, respectively, as light-ﬁeld resists and dark-ﬁeld resists,
although this terminology can cause some confusion when several different fab-
rication facilities are involved in one process.) With positive resists, the chemical
bonds within the resist are weakened when exposed to UV light, whereas they
are strengthened in negative resists. As a result, after developing, positive resists
take up a positive image of the mask (the resist remains on the mask where the
chrome was) and negative resists take up a negative image, as seen in Figure 1.1.
The next step involves the selective removal of the silicon dioxide ﬁlm, through
an etching process. A typical example would be to immerse the wafer in a bath
of hydroﬂuoric acid. This will react with the exposed silicon dioxide, but not that
protected by the photoresist, which is, as its name implies, resistant to chemical
attack by the acid. Once the thin ﬁlm of silicon dioxide has been etched through,
the unwanted photoresist is removed with a solvent, leaving the wafer with the
patterned silicon dioxide layer.
1.2.1 UV EXPOSURE SYSTEMS
The structural dimensions that can be achieved in a photolithographic process are
related to the wavelength of the light employed. When light is incident upon a
narrow aperture, it will be diffracted. As the dimensions of the aperture approach
the wavelength of the incident light, this diffraction becomes signiﬁcant.
Therefore, for smaller structures, smaller-wavelength light must be used. UV
light has therefore been one of the most convenient forms of illumination to
employ in photolithography. It conveniently interacts with chemical bonds in
various compounds, is relatively easily generated (at longer wavelengths, at
least), and has a relatively small wavelength compared to visible or infrared light
Terminology
Photoetching and photoengraving are terms that have also been used to refer
to photolithographic processes, although they are not commonly used today.
Although photolithography strictly refers to a process that involves light (pho-
tons), it is sometimes used in casual conversation to refer to the general sweep
of lithographic processes. It would be more correct to use the terms microli-
thography, nanolithography, or simply lithography (or lithographic) in such
cases. The term lithography itself refers to printing from a design onto a ﬂat
surface. In addition to UV photolithography, x-ray lithography and e-beam
lithography will also be discussed.

(from about 400 nm down to 10 nm, where it merges into the soft x-ray region of
the spectrum). Also, in the upper reaches of the UV spectrum, optics can be
relatively easily fabricated from quartz. UV wavelengths from 426 nm down to
about 248 nm are fairly common.
1.2.1.1
Mask Aligners
Microstructures are typically built up through a series of steps in which thin ﬁlms
of materials are deposited and selectively etched (patterned), each photolithographic
step, i.e., each pattern, requiring a different mask and each pattern having to be
precisely aligned to the preceding ones. Alignment marks are placed on each
layer of the design in an out-of-the-way area of the mask (i.e., somewhere where
they can easily be found and can fulﬁll their function but will not interfere with
the function of the ﬁnished device). The mask aligner is the tool used to align the
marks on the mask with those existing on the substrate in order to ensure accurate
registration of each layer of the design with the others, as well as to expose the
photoresist through the mask to UV light. Exposure may be through a contact
aligner or a step-and-repeat system.
The contact mask aligner is the system most commonly used in microma-
chining processes because they do not normally need the very small feature sizes
that can be achieved at greater expense and complexity by step-and-repeat sys-
tems. For the contact alignment system, the mask is produced at a 1:1 scale to
the ﬁnished design. This will invariably be a single large mask plate with many,
usually several hundred, individual chip designs on it.
The photoresist-coated substrate (silicon wafer, glass sheet, or whatever is
being micromachined) is placed in the aligner and adjusted so that the alignment
marks can be located within the viewer. The mask is introduced into the machine,
and the chrome-patterned face is brought into close approximation with the
photoresist-coated face of the substrate, typically only micrometers apart. The
alignment marks on the mask are located, and the position of the mask is adjusted
so that they register with the alignment marks etched into the substrate. The mask
is then brought into contact with the substrate, ﬁnal alignment is checked, and
the photoresist is then exposed to a pulse of UV light.
The main advantage of contact photolithography is that relatively inexpensive
mask aligners and optics are required. Furthermore, the entire area of the substrate
is exposed in a single exposure. One advantage of micromachining is that a
number of different devices, or different versions of one device, can be placed
on the same mask for fabrication on the same substrate. This is of considerable
assistance, as MEMS require far more trial-and-error experiments than micro-
electronic circuits. Another advantage of micromachining is that the process of
aligning both sides of the substrate (front and back) is a little easier; specialist
double-sided alignment tools are also available. Double-sided alignment, in which
micromachining is performed on both sides of a ﬂat silicon substrate, is one
feature of MEMS fabrication that is not used in conventional IC manufacture.
Contact photolithography suffers more from wear and tear of the masks than
does step-and-repeat, which uses a projection system to reduce the image of the
mask on the substrate. Additionally, any small damage or irregularities on the

mask are reproduced in the developed photoresist structure. Although the single
exposure tends to reduce the time required for photolithography, the UV intensity
across the substrate may not be uniform if the system is not set up correctly. In
this case, the developed image in the photoresist will not be different across the
wafer, and the process yield will be affected. Finally, one does not have the option
of using grayscale masks when employing contact lithographic techniques.
The wear and tear of masks can be reduced by using contact alignment’s
close relation, proximity alignment (or proximity printing). This proceeds in
almost exactly the same manner as contact alignment, except that the mask is
held at a very small distance from the photoresist. In consequence, the achievable
minimum feature size is less than that possible with contact alignment methods.
Contact photolithography is contrasted with the step-and-repeat process in
Figure 1.2. Note that the mask face bearing the chrome pattern is the one that is
brought into contact with the photoresist during contact lithography. The mask
plate itself is relatively thick, typically, a few millimeters. If the chrome were not
A Quick Way to Calibrate the Exposure Time in Your Contact Aligner
This method is especially useful when trying out an old system for experi-
mental purposes or trying out new resists, but not of much use if you hit problems
with a calibrated setup. Work out the likely minimum and maximum exposure
times. Then, subtract a bit from the one, and add a bit to the other. Apply resist
to a spare wafer. Now, take a suitable mask with a slot in it (it need not be a
quartz mask, but just something that will ﬁt in the aligner). Starting at one end
of the wafer (near a ﬂat would be a good idea), put your makeshift mask in and
expose it for your minimum exposure time. Now, move the strip up a bit and
expose for a little longer (making sure that you note down each exposure time
used and any other relevant settings). Repeat. Now, develop and examine the
results under a microscope. This is not going to get you very high quality results
but may be sufﬁcient to get you started if you are just trying things out.  
FIGURE 1.2 (a) Contact printing exposes the entire wafer at once, whereas (b) in projection
printing a single mask holds the pattern for a single device. This is reduced and projected
onto the coated wafer, which is stepped beneath it and receives a series of exposures.

directly in contact with the photoresist, the optical effects due to the passage of
UV light through the glass plate, divergence of the source, etc., would reduce the
quality of the image formed in the resist.
The step-and-repeat approach involves the use of a mask that bears a larger
image of the desired pattern — usually the design for only one chip. This is placed
in an optical system that reduces and projects an image of the mask onto the substrate.
After each exposure, the substrate is moved (stepped) to expose the next section.
Reduction will typically be a factor of about ten. In this case, note that a 1-µm
blemish in the mask pattern will be reduced to a 0.1-µm blemish in the photoresist
when using the step-and-repeat system but will remain as a 1-µm structure if a
contact system is used. The step-and-repeat system’s main strength is that it can be
used to produce devices with smaller feature sizes than in the case of the contact
approach, mainly due to the advantages provided by the projection system.
First, because the mask is made at a larger scale than that of the structure to
be produced, it does not necessarily need to be made using a very-high-resolution
technique. That is, for contact lithography with a 1-µm minimum structural
feature size, the mask would have to be made using a process capable of producing
0.1-µm, or better, features in order to get a reasonable reproduction. If the same
structure were to be created using a mask for 10:1 reduction in a projection system,
then the minimum structural feature on the mask would be of 10-µm size. A process
with better than a 1-µm minimum feature size would produce a result of the same
quality as would the contact mask made using the 0.1-µm process.
Furthermore, this gives the designer a chance to control the intensity of the UV
light to speciﬁc areas of the photoresist which are exposed by creating grayscale
masks (Figure 1.3). These essentially incorporate meshes of small apertures in the
mask design, such that when the image is reduced, the image of the aperture is
beyond the resolving capacity of the photolithographic system. Thus, instead of
producing a series of islands or gaps in the imaged photoresist, a reduction in the
average intensity of the UV light over the area in proportion to the relative opaque
area of the mask is seen. The exact implications of this and the use it can be put

to depend on the chemistry and nature of the photoresist or the lithography system.
Table 1.1 summarizes the features of contact and projection lithography systems.
1.2.1.2 UV Light Sources
For most micromachining processes involving contact lithography, the UV light
source will be a broad-spectrum mercury arc lamp with a ﬁlter placed to restrict
illumination to one of the spectral lines (i or g). Photoresist manufacturers supply
data sheets that provide information about recommended exposure times and
wavelengths. Note that whereas some resists must be exposed to light within a
fairly strict spectrum in order to function correctly, others are available that also
work outside the range of UV wavelengths commonly used.
For very small feature sizes, in particular, the submicrometer feature sizes
typical of the most advanced IC technologies in use today, the excimer laser is
used as the UV source. This is a UV laser with a torch-like beam. This means
that it has to be employed in step-and-repeat processes as it cannot be used to
illuminate the entire substrate at once. The excimer laser has its own place in
micromachining and is discussed in more detail in Chapter 3.
Photoresists and photolithography systems are commonly referenced by the
nature of the UV source: g-line, the 436-nm band of the mercury arc lamp, i line,
the 365-nm band, and deep ultraviolet (DUV) at 248-nm and 193-nm wave-
lengths, in which excimer laser sources are preferred (Table 1.2).
1.2.1.3 Optical Systems
The resolution of an optical system is generally determined by considering its
ability to distinguish between two point sources of light [1,2,3]. This work by
Rayleigh in the 19th century gave rise to the Rayleigh criterion. Roughly stated,
the minimum resolved distance between two peaks depends on the wavelength of
light and the numerical aperture of the focusing optics:

Where λ is the wavelength of the light, and NA the numerical aperture of the lens.
This equation was derived from optical considerations alone and based on a
consideration of point light sources. In photolithography, the achievable
resolution (minimum feature size) is also related to other aspects, such as the
chemistry of the photoresist. Additionally, one is generally more interested in
lines than point sources. Considerations for contact, proximity, and projection
systems are outlined in the following subsections.
Also of interest is the depth of focus, the distance along the optical axis over
which the optics produce an image of suitable quality. The Rayleigh criterion for
depth of focus gives [1,2]:
(1.2)
As with considerations of resolution, this pure equation is not directly applicable
to photolithography.
1.2.1.3.1
Contact and Proximity Printing
In contact and proximity printing, the optical limits to minimum feature sizes are
due primarily to diffraction effects. In this case, the mathematics analyzes the
image of a slit in a grating. This gives rise to a resolution related to the wavelength
of light and the separation, s, between the mask plate and the substrate [2,4]:
(1.3)
In practice, because of the dependence on process parameters, this is normally
written as:
(1.4)
where k3 is empirically derived for the process and facility. Peckerar et al. give a
practical value of k3 as 1.6, whereas Reche suggests that it can be as low as 1.5.

In the case of contact printing, the distance s will be half the thickness of the
photoresist. Note that this can be quite substantial in micromachining applications
(tens of micrometers) and that raised and indented micromachined features can
mean that the surface of the resist may be considerably more rippled or featured
than one normally ﬁnds. In the case of proximity printing, one may assume that
the distance between mask and substrate is signiﬁcantly greater than the thickness
of the resist, so s will take this value, and the thickness of the resist may be
neglected. Once again, beware of assumptions that may be invalidated by the
unusual nature of MEMS processing.
As mentioned previously, one of the advantages of contact or proximity
printing is that the entire area of the substrate can be exposed in a single-process
step. Unfortunately UV sources such as the mercury arc lamp appear somewhat
point-like. These, therefore, require special optics to expand and homogenize
(make the intensity uniform across the area of the substrate that is being exposed)
the beam. Somewhat unintuitively, the best results are not provided by collimated
light; a divergence of a few degrees will smooth out peaks that appear in the
intensity towards the edge of the pattern [3]. The optics for a contact aligner are
shown schematically in Figure 1.4.

resolution and depth of focus (Equation 1.1 and Equation 1.2, respectively; [1,2,4]):

Once again, k1 and k2 are empirically derived for the process in question. In
practice, k1 will be between 0.5 and 1, typically, about 0.7 [1,4], and k2 will be
somewhere about 0.5 ([4]; Peckerar et al. suggest that is closer to 1). Reche also

gives the economically practical value of a numerical aperture as being no more than
0.5 for one-to-one projection printing. With reduction optics, it may be increased to
0.6 [1], although economically this would amount to using a production line stepper
around the clock. The optics of a projection system are shown in outline in Figure 1.5.

exposure for a 1:1 projection system with a numerical aperture of 0.5, the
achievable resolution will be approximately 0.61 µm with a depth of ﬁeld of
1.7 µm. This would be adequate for many applications, but consider the situation
in which a 10-µm thick resist is required. A trade-off between depth of ﬁeld and
resolution can be seen by examining Equation 1.5 and Equation 1.6. For a 10-µm
depth of ﬁeld (greater, preferably, to accommodate positioning and other errors),
the resolution goes up to about 1.53 µm. Note that projection printing would
typically be used for high-resolution printing on thin ﬁlms of resist.
Using the same numbers, contact printing would give a 3.34-µm resolution
with the 10-µm resist. In this case, we have considered the entire thickness of
the resist ﬁlm as the separation distance, which will give a worst-case estimate
of resolution. For thin resists, the separation distance can be set to half the
thickness of the resist (implying that the resolution, in this case, is unlikely to be
better than 2.36 µm).
If we consider proximity printing with a 50-µm total separation, our achiev-
able resolution increases to 7.47 µm, which will be adequate for many microengi-
neering applications.
Typically, thick resists are used as structural elements in MEMS. They may
also be desirable in deep-etching applications, in which a thick resist is required
to withstand long periods spent in the etching apparatus. In the latter situation,
high resolutions can be achieved by the use of a hard mask. A thin layer of resist
can be used to pattern an underlying layer of more resilient material for the
etching of the next process stem: a metal ﬁlm, for instance. This is the hard mask;
the pattern in this would then be transferred to the underlying material during a
long etch process before the hard mask (etch mask) is stripped.

1.2.1.4 Optical Oddities
Optical systems cannot be made completely free of aberrations or distortions, and
further problems may be introduced by the nature of mask or substrate. A few of
these are discussed in the following paragraphs, and some are covered in greater
detail in Part III.
1.2.1.4.1
The Difference between Negative
and Positive Resists
Light will be scattered when it enters the resist layer. As illustrated in Figure 1.6,
when the resist is overexposed, this leads to gaps in the developed resist that are
larger than the mask features for positive resists and smaller than the mask
features for negative resists. Because many etching procedures undercut the
resist, particularly many wet etches, this has resulted in a preference to the use of
negative resists in order to more closely reproduce the features in the mask.
1.2.1.4.2
Optical Aberrations and Distortions
The results of any photolithographic process would be limited by the quality of the
optical system. Typically, these will be more severe further from the optical axis.
Astigmatism, arising from asymmetry in the optics for instance, will typically
result in slightly poorer resolution in one horizontal direction than in others. It
may also have knock-on consequences in terms of optical proximity effects, etc.,
mentioned later.
Chromatic aberrations are particularly problematic with lens-based systems,
as opposed to reﬂective focusing systems. Although lens-based optical systems
normally achieve higher numerical apertures than reﬂective systems, the refractive
index of the material employed is dependent on the wavelength of the light being
transmitted. Some photoresists are sensitive to a speciﬁc wavelength of light,
whereas other broadband resists are sensitive to a broad spectral range. In the
latter case, projection printing results, in particular, will suffer because of chro-
matic aberrations unless a ﬁlter is employed.
Distortions can sometimes be introduced because the resist is capable of
reproducing very-high-resolution features. In some forms of 1:1 projection and
contact printing, for instance, the ﬂy-eye homogenizer employed can introduce
patterns in the resist.

1.2.1.4.3 Optical Proximity Effects
Optical proximity effects are another aspect of photolithography that are felt most
acutely with modern high-resolution projection systems. They are exempliﬁed by the
situation illustrated in Figure 1.7. Diffraction effects in the gap have led to partial
exposure of the resist there and poor reproduction of the mask pattern.
Similar effects can also be seen in the rounding of corners and poor dimen-
sional reproduction illustrated in Figure 1.7b. Note that corners in particular
represent very-high-resolution objects, and thus it can be difﬁcult to achieve good
reproduction of sharp corners.
These effects can be compensated for by mask design, but with the resolutions
typically used in microengineering and MEMS, they do not normally represent
signiﬁcant problems. High-resolution nanolithography is dealt with in Part III of
this book.
1.2.1.4.4
Reﬂection from the Substrate
The classic example of an effect caused by reﬂection from the substrate is the striated
or wavy patterns that appear in otherwise vertical resist sidewalls (Figure 1.8). These
are a result of standing waves set up between incident light and that reﬂected from
the substrate below the resist.
FIGURE 1.7 Optical proximity effects (exaggerated): (a) the original mask pattern, (b)
the pattern reproduced (shaded area), the lines are foreshortened, corners rounded, and
the small gap partially ﬁlled.

21
Another problem that may be experienced is that of reﬂective proximity
effects, in which a slope in the substrate reﬂects incident light horizontally into
the resist. This can interfere with exposure of the resist in an adjacent area leading
to overexposure.
Antireﬂective coatings are available from suppliers of photolithographic
chemicals, and these are the solution of ﬁrst resort in cases in which reﬂected
light causes a problem.
1.2.2 SHADOW MASKS
An alternative to chrome on quartz masks is the use of stencils. Commonly, these
would be laser-cut stainless steel stencils that are used in printed circuit board
(PCB) manufacture. These are termed shadow masks and have two applications.
The ﬁrst is in certain thin-ﬁlm deposition processes, notably sputtering and
evaporation, in which the mask is clamped over the face of the substrate. The
deposition process covers the entire surface so that when the mask is removed,
unwanted material goes with it, leaving a stenciled pattern on the substrate. The
second use, obviously, is in photolithography.
Shadow masks cannot be used to achieve very high precision or small feature
sizes. An additional problem with the use of stainless steel, particularly in de-
position processes that develop heat, is that its dimensions change because of
thermal expansion, giving rise to blurred edges. Cutting masks from alloys such
as invar can reduce this problem. The main advantage of using shadow masks,
however, is their low cost. 
1.2.3 PHOTORESISTS AND RESIST PROCESSING
The aim of the exercise is to produce controlled and repeatable proﬁles in the
developed photoresist. The ideal proﬁle has vertical sidewalls as shown in Figure 1.9a.
For some applications, it may be desirable to employ different resist proﬁles; one
of the most useful of these is the undercut proﬁle for liftoff processing (see
Tolerance Examples for Laser-Cut Stencils
•
Stainless steel, 0.1- to 0.2-mm thick
•
Design resolution, 0.5 µm
•
Precision, ±10 µm
•
Pitch (spacing between pads), 0.3 mm
Although a very small design resolution is quoted, the ±10-µm precision
limits the design minimum feature size. The pitch will be given for component
pads on a PCB. Note that because this is a stencil, holes can be smaller than
the spacing between them, and the designer has to consider mechanical support
and stability across the design. Sub-100-µm holes may be achievable, but larger
spaces (at least 100 µm) should be left between them.

section 2.6.4), as in Figure 1.9b. The optics, resist chemistry, and resist
processing steps combine to produce the desired sidewall proﬁle.
1.2.3.1 Photoresists
A photoresist is normally supplied in liquid form. Most resists consist of two
chemical components in an organic solvent. The ﬁrst component is sensitive to
light. The chemical products resulting from exposure of this component to light
drive a polymerization in the other resist component. The developing process
then removes the unpolymerized resist in the case of negative resists. In the case
of positive resists, the result of exposure is usually that the second component in
the exposed areas becomes more soluble in the developer. Generally,
polymerization and development in negative resists are accompanied by
dimensional changes that limit the resolution of the process more than for
positive resists. However, there are now a variety of specialized chemistries
available for both positive and negative resists, providing the engineer with a
range of different options. Table 1.3 lists some photoresists that are popular for
microengineering and MEMS. Table 1.4 lists some photoresist suppliers.

off process.
Desirable Properties of Photoresists for Microengineering
1. Good resolution
2. Good adhesion to the substrate
3. Resistance to etching processes
4. Resistance to other micromachining processes (e.g., electroplating)
5. Ability to coat nonplanar topographies
6. Ability to apply and process thick coatings (5 µm to more than 100 µm)
7. Mechanically resilient
Items 1 to 3 are general for any photoresist. Items 4 to 7 are more speciﬁc to
micromachining, with items 5 and 6 being of particular interest when the resist
is to be used as a structural component of the design.

or not required for some resists. For example, SU-8 does not normally require
adhesion promoters, positive resists do not normally require a postexposure-bake,
the rinse step may be included in recommendations for developing, and the hard-
bake may be replaced by a drying step (the hard-bake would ensure completion of
polymerization in negative resists and would particularly be employed if the resist
were to be a structural component in the design). If the resist is to be a structural
component, the normal pattern substrate and strip steps would be omitted.
1.2.3.2.1
Cleaning the Substrate
Within the clean room, there are a number of common facilities and procedures
for cleaning substrates prior to and during processing. These are normally wet
processes, involving liquid solvents. An outline of these are:
•
Organic solvents
•
Acetone
•
Isopropyl alcohol (aka IPA, propanol, propan-1-ol)
•
Deionized (DI) water (ﬁltered to remove particles)
•
Corrosive cleaning processes
•
Piranha etch/clean
•
RCA clean
•
Drying processes
•
Nitrogen
•
Oven (may be supplied with vacuum)
•
Hot plate
•
Ultrasonic bath
Acetone is a very common organic solvent and can be used to clean wafers
of a variety of contaminants, including the less stubborn photoresists. The sub-
strate is easily dried off with a jet of nitrogen gas. Acetone will leave residual
marks on the wafer, which can be rinsed off in IPA, another volatile organic that
can be dried off with nitrogen. Acetone and IPA may well be adequate for the
ﬁnal cleaning, but during processing it is undesirable to have organic contami-
nation on the surface of the wafer. Therefore, cleaning steps normally end with
a rinse in deionized (DI) water. This has to be dried off on a hot plate or in an
oven. Note that intersolvent drying is not required when transferring from one
liquid solvent to the next.
The Yellow Room
Photoresist processing is normally carried out in a special clean room known
as the yellow room or yellow area because of the yellow lighting that is
employed. This is to reduce the chance that the external lighting would age or
affect the photoresist.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
One of the most convenient DI water facilities to have is a continuous ﬂow
through a tank, with water spilling from one reservoir to the next. This is normally
monitored for pH or conductivity. In this way, it is possible to determine when
acid (or alkaline) etchants have been fully rinsed from the substrate.
Another common facility is the ultrasonic cleaning bath (also referred to as
megasonic when high-frequency ultrasound, above about 800 kHz, is employed).
This provides a mechanically assisted cleaning process. The ultrasound induces
cavitation, small bubbles, in the solvent. These collapse, releasing mechanical
energy. This can facilitate the access of solvents to deep narrow holes (it is also
used to enhance etching of such structures), as well as assisting mechanically
in the removal of stubborn contaminants (e.g., burnt-on resist). Beware, how-
ever, because this is a mechanical process, it can cause damage to delicate
microstructures.
Finally, when it comes to mechanical assistance, do not forget the existence
of automatic (magnetic) stirrers or the simple expedient of tipping the petri dish
containing solvent and substrate.
There are two more extreme processes used in the preparation and cleaning
of substrates. Both of these are intended to remove organic and metallic contam-
inants. Note that the chemicals and procedures involved are very hazardous; if
you carry them out ensure that you follow the local clean room or laboratory
guidelines.
The piranha clean refers to more or less any combination of sulphuric acid
(H2SO4) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and is carried out at high temperatures,
80 to 120°C. Composition (H2SO4: H2O2) varies from 50:1 to about 3:1. At the
higher hydrogen peroxide concentrations, the mixture is self-heating. The mixture
has a short shelf life because of the hydrogen peroxide, and so needs to be used
shortly after mixing. It is an oxidizing solution, and may enhance the native oxide
ﬁlm over bare silicon. Cleaning times should be short (on the order of 10 min or
so). It is a corrosive mixture, so it may remove more than expected (metals will
be attacked, for example).
The RCA clean was named after the Radio Corporation of America (RCA),
where it was developed. It is composed of three steps, interspersed with DI
rinses and subsequent drying. The ﬁrst step is intended to remove organic
contaminants and is performed between 70°C and about 100°C with a solution
of ammonium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide, and water (NH4OH : H2O2 : DI,
1:1:5) for about 10 min. The second step is a dip etch in dilute hydroﬂuoric
acid, HF (50:1 HF:DI). This removes a thin layer of oxide in which metal ions
may have accumulated. Finally, ionic and metal contaminants are removed by
a 10-min etch in hydrochloric acid and hydrogen peroxide solution (HCl :
H2O2 : DI, 1:1:6), again at an elevated temperature. Note that this will also
have an adverse effect on non-noble metals (e.g., aluminum, which is a very
commonly used metal for conductors on ICs). Also, be aware that the same
material deposited by two different methods may be affected differently (see
Chapter 2).

1.2.3.2.2 Applying Photoresists
The goal is to achieve a ﬂat even ﬁlm of a speciﬁc, controlled thickness.
Photoresists are normally applied by spinning. The substrate is mounted
on the chuck of a spinner, a measured volume of resist is dispensed onto the
center of the substrate, and the spinner is accelerated to a predetermined speed.
The substrate is then removed and heated on a hot plate or in an oven to drive
off the solvent from the resist. The data sheet for the particular resist should
provide process details, including spin speeds, and proﬁles for speciﬁc ﬁlm
thickness.
The ﬁrst complication that may be added to this process is the requirement for
priming or application of an adhesion promoter (commonly HMDS — hexameth-
yldisilizane). Second, it may be desirable to remove the bead of resist that can form
around the edge of the substrate. This is normally performed by applying solvent
(edge bead remover) to the edge of the substrate while it is still on the spinner.
A further complication comes in applying thick ﬁlms that may be required
either to cover large features (pits, mesas, etc.) on the substrate or as structural
elements themselves. The particular problems relate to achieving an even cover-
age with high-viscosity resists and drying and developing the resist ﬁlm without
cracking or peeling and without trapped gases. A number of the resists listed in
Table 1.3 were speciﬁcally formulated for this particular problem, and information
can be obtained from the manufacturers’ data sheets.
There are several alternative methods by which photoresists may be applied
to a substrate. The ﬁrst of these is spraying (e.g., in Reference [8], one source
for the equipment required is EV Group, E Thallner GmbH, Schärding, Austria.
www.evgroup.com). This can cover quite awkward substrates with thick resist
coats.
The next alternative is to apply several coats of resist. Normally the
approach would be to apply, image, and postexposure-bake one layer, then
repeat for the next layer. Final development of different layers then takes place
Thick-Resist Processing
This has been subject to some discussion on the MEMS e-mail list [7]. The
following have been extracted as ideas to be tried out if attempting to apply
thick resist ﬁlms (over difﬁcult topographies):
•
Close down the lid of the spinner, if available, to prevent premature
evaporation of solvent.
•
Flood the substrate with thinner prior to applying the resist.
•
Use a hot plate for baking; alternatively, use a vacuum oven (but
contact the manufacturer for ideas ﬁrst — most are very helpful).
•
Use an alternative method for applying resists.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
all in one go. The process does need to be tailored to some extent; it would be
undesirable for the solvent in one layer to interfere with the previously imaged
layer.
Alternative resist technologies are also available. The PCB industry employs
dry-ﬁlm solid resists than can be used as structural materials in some MEMS
applications, and a recent development is the electrodeposited resist. These can
be electroplated onto the substrate.
1.2.3.2.3 Postexposure Processing
The postexposure-bake is normally only required for negative resists; its purpose
is to drive the cross-linking reactions that harden the resist to the developer. The
resist will be developed in an appropriate solution, either in a bath or a spray
system. Many developers contain alkali metal ions (such as potassium, K+, and
sodium, Na+). These can cause problems with subsequent processing and also
with the performance of electronic circuits, so the substrate should be cleaned of
these contaminants at the earliest possible stage.
A subsequent hard-bake step may be useful for some negative resists, partic-
ularly epoxy-based chemistries, to complete the cross-linking reactions following
development. This can make the resist very resilient to subsequent processing or
suitable as a structural material. It can also make it very difﬁcult to remove when
desired. If all else fails, plasma ashing (etching in an oxygen plasma) is normally
the last resort (see the section on dry etching in Chapter 2).
1.3
X-RAY LITHOGRAPHY
One of the goals in micromachining and MEMS microfabrication has been the
search for high-aspect-ratio microstructures, i.e., structures with a large ratio of
height (or depth) to width. With UV exposure systems, this has been limited by
the optics of the system and penetration of the UV photons into the resist (SU-8 is
a bit of an exception and has found considerable application in microengineering).
The x-ray region of the spectrum begins at wavelengths of greater than 1 nm
and extends to wavelengths beyond (less than) 0.01 nm. X-rays are produced by
electron bombardment of materials, or electron deceleration, in contrast to gamma
rays, which are produced by events within the nucleus of the atom. X-rays with
wavelengths of above about 0.1 nm are referred to as soft x-rays, whereas those
with shorter wavelengths are referred to as hard x-rays.
X-rays have two advantages when considering high-aspect-ratio structures
in thick resists. First, their exceedingly short wavelength means that they are
unlikely to be affected by diffraction effects through the mask, unless they are
being used for very ﬁne lithography. Second, high-energy x-rays can penetrate
into very thick layers of resist, with relatively little attenuation; thus, the resist
is evenly exposed through its thickness. The main limit to resolution, in terms
of micrometer feature sizes, is that several x-ray sources appear as blurred
point sources.

Photolithography 
29
Although attenuation of x-radiation of speciﬁc energy, or wavelength, can be
related to the atomic number and density of the material in question, the rela-
tionship is not simple and, in practice, discontinuities are found. In addition to
materials reference books (e.g., The CRC Handbook [9]), NIST maintains a
database of x-ray attenuation coefﬁcients for different materials [10]. The fraction
of an incident beam of unit intensity that penetrates through a layer of material
of thickness x can be estimated as:
(1.7)
where α is the mass attenuation coefﬁcient determined for the material employed
and the energy of the incident photons. X-ray exposure of resist is effected by
electrons that are liberated into the resist when x-ray photons are absorbed. Thus,
e-beam resists can commonly be employed as x-ray resists; polymethylmethacry-
late (PMMA)-based resists are the most common.
1.3.1 MASKS FOR X-RAY LITHOGRAPHY
The aim is to provide a mask with sufﬁcient contrast. To this end, patterns of
highly attenuating material are formed on thin ﬁlms of highly transmitting
material; microengineering techniques are often used to create such masks
(Figure 1.11). Gold deposited on a silicon nitride or polyimide ﬁlm is commonly
used as the attenuating material.
A problem with x-ray exposure is that the mask, subjected to very high levels
of x-radiation, heats up. Corresponding thermal expansion can then limit resolu-
tion and performance of the process, particularly with masks that incorporate
polymer membranes. Because x-ray sources are relatively small, many exposure
systems incorporate scanning of the mask and substrate across the source, which
allows a little time for cooling.

Overall, x-ray lithography is a relatively expensive process, particularly when
considering high-energy x-rays in which a synchrotron x-ray source is required.
It tends to be reserved for specialized applications.
1.4
DIRECT-WRITE (E-BEAM) LITHOGRAPHY
Throughout the previous sections of this chapter, masks have remained as rather
enigmatic objects; it has been implied that such things exist, but not how they may
be produced. A hint was provided with the discussion of projection systems:
reduction optics allow for the production of relatively large masks that do not
require high design tolerances, which can then be reduced through a projection
system to produce the ﬁnal design. This approach has been used, usually, with two
intermediate reduction steps. However, the most common practice in microengi-
neering is to write the design directly onto the mask plate. This cuts out the need
to produce expensive intermediate masks that are only going to be used once.
Both UV and e-beam direct-write systems are available, although the latter are
more commonly used; UV systems are reserved for situations in which resolution
is not critical but ﬂexibility is an important requirement (MEMS development is
one such scenario). The basic principle is the same for both, but the mechanisms
differ. This section primarily deals with e-beam systems, and the reader is invited
to make inferences regarding UV systems.
The de Broglie hypothesis gives the equivalent wavelength of a particle as:
(1.8)
where h is Planck’s constant, and p is the momentum of the particle. The momen-
tum can be derived from the voltage used to accelerate the electrons, giving a de
Broglie wavelength related to accelerating voltage:

Typical direct-write e-beam systems employ acceleration voltages of 10 kV
to 50 kV (giving corresponding electron energies of 10 keV to 50 keV). From
this it can be seen that the wavelength of the electron is much smaller (picometers)
than that of UV light (nanometers).
A direct-write e-beam system is outlined in Figure 1.12; note that the system
is under vacuum. The electron source has commonly been a heated tungsten wire
(a thermionic source), although ﬁeld emission sources (a needle, again commonly
tungsten, with an applied potential difference across it) are now popular as they
provide bright point sources; the two approaches are often combined. The emitted
electrons are accelerated and focused into a bright spot on the substrate. The
position of the spot is controlled by scanning coils, and blanking plates turn the
spot on and off by diverting the beam electrostatically. The system is very
reminiscent of a scanning electron microscope (SEM), and SEMs can easily be
turned into direct-write systems, although the source, optics, and control are not
optimized for the job. Similarly, confocal microscopes can be turned into optical
direct-write systems, although the choice of resist is limited to broadband resists
that are at least partially sensitive to the wavelength of the laser employed (if it
is a reddish laser, you will probably be out of luck).
There are two obvious problems immediately apparent to this approach. One
is the size of the spot, and the other is the scanning mechanism employed. A
third, perhaps less obvious problem, is the high energies employed.
Consider the spot size. Four-inch-diameter wafers are commonly employed
in MEMS fabrication, and 6-inch wafers will probably become increasingly
common in the near future. To write a mask design to a 4-inch mask plate with
a very small spot size will take a very long time. For this reason, it is necessary
to specify the design’s minimum feature size when mask plates are fabricated;
the largest reasonable spot size can be used, reducing the time taken and reducing
the cost of the plate. E-beam systems can be focused to spots from about 10 nm
to 1000 nm or so.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
The problem of writing to a large area is compounded by the scanning mech-
anism. The beam is only perpendicular to the photoresist at one point: along the
axis of the system. As it is scanned across, it enters the resist at a different angle,
giving rise to distortion. This limits the overall area (ﬁeld) that can be covered
before the mask plate being written has to be translated (moved) in a horizontal or
vertical direction. The ﬁeld area will depend on the system, beam diameter and
shape, and, eventually, on the design’s minimum feature size. However, it is unlikely
that it will be on the order of more than a few millimeters.
Figure 1.13 therefore illustrates the writing of a mask plate using a raster-
scan mode. A small area is written by scanning the beam back and forth, and
the mask plate is translated horizontally and vertically beneath the beam until
the entire area has been covered. The system may be modiﬁed somewhat by
directing the beam speciﬁcally to the areas to be exposed and ﬁlling these in
(vector-scan approach). This is most efﬁcacious if only a relatively small area
requires exposure.
One further problem, arising from the use of high-energy electrons, is prox-
imity effects. Electrons have a tendency to scatter at a wide variety of angles
(including 180°) when entering a solid. This makes it very important to pay
attention to proximity effects when setting up e-beam direct-write systems. This
is not a feature of x-ray systems discussed in the previous section, because the
electrons liberated by x-ray irradiation generally have energies orders of magni-
tude lower than those employed in e-beam systems.
1.5
LOW-COST PHOTOLITHOGRAPHY
Because the cost of a mask is set relatively high, particularly, when producing
only a few devices for research, several different approaches have been tried to
reduce costs. Generally speaking, these are only useful for designs that incorporate
FIGURE 1.13 Raster scanning with e-beam. The beam is scanned over a small area in a
zigzag manner and turned on and off to expose different parts of the resist. The substrate
is then translated beneath the beam to an unexposed area, and the procedure is repeated
until the entire substrate has been written.

one or two masks and have relatively large feature sizes; channels for microﬂu-
idics would be a good example. These approaches are:
•
Laser printer
•
High-resolution printer
•
Shadow mask (laser-cut stencil)
•
PCB artwork
•
Scrounged and modiﬁed SEM or confocal microscope
These are best restricted to in-house development work. If a design is to be
fabricated by a MEMS foundry, then a conventional approach should be used;
discuss your requirements with the foundry or service provider in question.
The ﬁrst two options are variations on a theme. Transparencies can be pro-
duced on a desktop laser printer and used to create masks. These tend to produce
designs with ragged edges and large features (100 µm or more). The ragged edges
are not so much of a problem if an anisotropic etchant is to be used to create the
ﬁnal structure, notably potassium hydroxide etching of silicon, which is limited
by crystal planes and will therefore produce well-deﬁned edges from ragged
masks. The preferred route at present, however, is to have the transparency printed
by a commercial print shop on a high-resolution printer. Resolutions of several
thousand dots per inch can be achieved, with good even coverage, allowing the
production of features down to a few tens of micrometers.
The resulting transparency can be taped to a glass plate for use in an aligner.
Note, however, that many polymer ﬁlms tend to be relatively opaque to UV light,
and the resulting mask will not be very robust in any case. It may well be
preferable to produce a mask plate from the ﬁlm. Again, several options present
themselves. Chromium-coated mask blanks are available from several suppliers;
these may be quartz, but given that dimensions are not going to be critical in this
case, lower-cost glass alternatives may be used. Probably the most convenient
approach is to purchase a presensitized mask blank, i.e., one already coated with
photoresist. Mask blanks with other metal ﬁlm coatings are also available,
although perhaps not so readily. These may present an advantage in that a metal
etchant may be more conveniently found, depending on the laboratory setup,
although other metals may not be as durable as chrome.
Exposure will, again, depend on the particular facilities available. The ﬁlm
will need to be clipped to the mask blank or sandwiched between the blank and
a glass plate. UV exposure will not only depend on the photoresist used but also
on the absorption of the UV light by the ﬁlm and other components of the
assembly; it may take a long time.
Following development of the resist, it will be necessary to etch the underlying
metal layer. A variety of premixed wet etches are commercially available. Alter-
natively, refer to Chapter V-1 on chemical etching in Vossen & Kern’s book Thin
Film Processes (1978) [11]. This lists several chromium etches from which an
appropriate formula can be selected.
The use of printers should enable the production of a mask plate for less than
$100, given prices at the time of writing. One of the drawbacks, as with most of

34
Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
the other approaches listed, is that conventional mask-design software packages
cannot be employed because a PostScript output ﬁle is normally required. In the
past, it has been possible to ﬁnd freeware or shareware CIF to PostScript converters.
Laser-cut stencils, used in the PCB industry, have already been touched on
as possible masks for photolithography. The Gerber ﬁle format is commonly used
for data interchange within the PCB industry, so a PCB-design software package
will probably be required to generate these. PCB design packages can be down-
loaded from the Internet, but are usually in cut-down trial versions.
A further alternative is to approach a company that produces artwork for the
PCB industry. These ﬁlms are usually fairly robust and capable of fairly high
resolution but are relatively expensive.
The last approach, which has also been touched on previously, is to beg, steal,
borrow, scrounge, or hijack an SEM or a confocal microscope! This then needs
to be adapted to control the scanning and optics from a design ﬁle. Both have
been done, despite the problems in matching the resist to the available optical
spectrum in the confocal, but the approach requires one to be technically conﬁ-
dent. Nonetheless, the learning involved in adapting these systems does bring on
a considerable understanding of the processes involved and the capabilities of
the tool, which can then be used for unusual applications. One example of this
would be performing lithography on nonplanar substrates, such as ﬁne capillaries.
1.6
PHOTOLITHOGRAPHY — KEY POINTS
A few important facts and precautions in relation to the process of photolithog-
raphy are:
1. Mask making is extremely expensive; make sure that the design is
correct before embarking on this process. Furthermore,
a. Ensure that everyone involved in fabrication has reviewed the design
ﬁles.
b. Get someone else to review them, too.
c. Spend adequate time on the process and device design; it will save
a lot of money and grief later.
2. If involved in the photolithography process, note the following:
a. Read the instructions.
b. Especially, read the instructions when dealing with corrosive or
hazardous materials.
c. The process may involve either a negative or positive resist.
d. Positive resists are generally capable of higher resolutions than the
negative.
e. Resists are usually applied in liquid form by spinning, then soft-
baked to drive off the solvent; an adhesion promoter or primer may
be required for some resists.
f. The process then proceeds with exposure (normally, with a proximity
or contact printer), development, hard-bake, etching, and resist-strip.

g. UV light is employed in the exposure step; short wavelength implies
higher resolution.
h. Thick resist ﬁlms may require special treatment.
3. Masks are normally produced by direct-write e-beam systems. Masks
are normally chrome on quartz or low-expansion glass.
4. X-ray lithography can achieve high resolution and high-aspect-ratio
structures, but it is difﬁcult to produce masks.

2 Silicon Micromachining
2.1 INTRODUCTION
The concepts of microengineering and MEMS originally grew from the integrated
circuit (IC) industry, and the seminal paper commonly referred to by Petersen,
“Silicon as a Mechanical Material” [1]. Silicon micromachining remains one of the
best developed microengineering techniques and the mainstay of the industry. It
possesses the additional advantage that signal processing circuitry can be integrated
with MEMS on the same silicon chip (substrate), giving rise to the mass production
of cheap, intelligent microsensors and actuators.
There are a large number of different micromachining techniques. Different
foundries or laboratories use different sets and combine them in different ways
to produce different devices. This chapter, and the one that follows, contrasts
with Chapter 1 in that it will only brieﬂy introduce each micromachining tech-
nique. When read in conjunction with Part II, it will become apparent how these
techniques may be combined. The task for the microengineer is, then, to determine
the desired end product and then simultaneously work out a suitable fabrication
sequence and ﬁnd an organization or organizations that can implement it. In the
case of a multiuser multiproject process provider, the available fabrication
sequence is restricted. An in-house facility may restrict the processes available,
whereas if the substrates can be shipped between different service providers, this
is not such a problem (instead, one has logistic, yield, and process compatibility
problems to overcome).
This chapter, then, introduces silicon and silicon micromachining processes.
2.2 SILICON
Silicon (Si), is an elemental semiconductor that is found in group IV of the
periodic table. In its monocrystalline form, it is lighter and harder than steel. Its
electrical properties can be altered by introducing impurities, i.e., from elements
of groups III and V of the periodic table. Silicon occurs naturally in abundance
and also forms hard insulating oxides (glass) and nitrides.
In MEMS, silicon is found in both monocrystalline and polycrystalline forms.
As these names suggest, in the former, all the atoms are aligned in the same
crystal lattice arrangement. In the latter case, the material is made up of many
smaller crystals of silicon. The silicon wafers used as a substrate for microma-
chining are all of the monocrystalline form.
Silicon has a face-centered cubic (FCC) unit cell, which is shown in Figure 2.1.
The atoms within this cell are, however, arranged in a diamond conﬁguration.

This is shown in Figure 2.2a, and Figure 2.2b shows how this arrangement ﬁts
into the FCC unit cell. Different crystal planes of the silicon lattice have different
densities of chemical bonds between silicon atoms. This is made use of in some
micromachining processes in which the etchant attacks different crystal planes
at different rates.
Crystal planes and orientations (directions) are identiﬁed using the Miller
Indices, as described in the following section.

2.2.1 MILLER INDICES
Descriptions of crystal planes and directions are based on the concept of the unit
cell; that is, the smallest repeating unit of the crystal structure. Dimensions are
normalized to the length of the edge of a unit cell — thus, a unit cell is a 1 unit
∞ 1 unit ∞ 1 unit cube.
To describe a unit plane, the intercept of the plane on each axis is determined,
the reciprocal of the each intercept is found (with the reciprocal of inﬁnity being
zero), and this is written in parentheses. Directions are perpendicular to the plane
and are written with angular brackets.
Planes:
( 1/x-intercept 1/y-intercept 1/z-intercept )
Directions: < 1/x-intercept 1/y-intercept 1/z-intercept >
Thus, the <111> direction is perpendicular to the (111) plane. Figure 2.3
shows the most commonly referred to planes, (100), (110), and (111).
Indices are determined on the unit cell, thus higher-order planes are (211) or
(411), with the x intercept one half or one quarter of the way along the axis,
respectively.
2.3
CRYSTAL GROWTH
To produce silicon of sufﬁcient purity, a process known as zone reﬁning is used
to purify polycrystalline silicon. The material is passed through a heating coil in
a manner that causes a molten zone to pass along the length of the solid bar,
taking impurities with it. Monocrystalline silicon ingots are then produced using
the Czochralski process. Puriﬁed silicon is melted in a crucible, and a seed crystal

in a rotating clamp is brought up to the surface of the melt. As the seed crystal
is slowly withdrawn from the crucible, it draws out the cooling silicon with it.
As this solidiﬁes, it takes on the same crystal structure as that of the seed crystal.
The result is a cylindrical bar or ingot (Figure 2.4) of up to 12-in. (300-mm)
diameter. (Note: wafer diameters are often speciﬁed in imperial units).
2.4 DOPING
Impurities are normally introduced into the silicon melt to dope it as either a
p-type or n-type semiconductor. In the case of p-type semiconductors, a group III
element, boron (B), is introduced. Group V elements, phosphorous (P) or arsenic
(As), are used to form n-type silicon. The introduction of a small proportion of
B impurities into the silicon reduces the number of electrons available from
carrying current, whereas n-type dopants such as P or As increase the number of
available electrons. The physical effects induced by this processing form the basis
of electronic components such as diodes and transistors.

U.K., www.compart-tech.co.uk and Forest Software, Peterborough, U.K., www.forestsoft-
ware.co.uk.)
Dopant Levels
Silicon is referred to as p-type, p+, or p++ (also n-type, n, or n) silicon, depending
on the degree of doping. Silicon wafers will be either n- or p-type. Electronic
devices will usually be constructed of n-type and p-type layers, with more
heavily doped n or p+ regions being used to connect to conductive intercon-
nects. Heavily doped n and p++ silicon is highly conductive and not normally
used in devices, except as short-conducting tracks.

In the fabrication of both electronic circuits and MEMS, it is desirable to introduce
controlled levels of impurities into the silicon substrate in speciﬁc areas. The engineer
has two basic options for achieving this: thermal diffusion and ion implantation.
2.4.1 THERMAL DIFFUSION
This is normally carried out in a furnace at temperatures in excess of 1000°C.
As such, it must be one of the earliest processes engaged in or the temperatures
will damage (melt) subsequent parts of the structure. The process is fairly straight-
forward in concept and consists of the following:
•
A layer of high-quality silicon dioxide (thermal oxide, or densiﬁed
chemical vapor deposition [CVD] oxide) is deposited and patterned to
form a mask (the photoresist being stripped).
•
The wafer is brought into contact with ceramic tiles rich in the appro-
priate impurity (a diffusion source). A doped spin-on glass can also be
used if deep diffusion of high impurity concentration is not required.
•
The wafer and diffusion source are introduced into a furnace heated
to sufﬁcient temperature for an appropriate time. (For example, at
temperatures of 1175°C an 8-h diffusion will result in > 8-µm-thick
structures released by concentration-dependent etching. It will be
necessary to use an oxide mask of at least 1-µm thickness in such
cases.)
•
Following diffusion, the mask needs to be stripped. This is normally
a difﬁcult process as the material will have been affected by the dif-
fusion; a wet etch may not sufﬁce, and dry-etching processes (discussed
later in this chapter) may have to be employed.
Note that diffusion is an anisotropic process — the impurities diffuse laterally
under the mask as well as vertically into the substrate. Diffusion proﬁles are,
therefore, somewhat rounded.
2.4.2 ION IMPLANTATION
In contrast to thermal diffusion, ion implantation is a very precise and isotropic
process. Charged ions of the chosen impurity are accelerated towards the substrate.
They will reach a depth that can be determined by the momentum that the ion gains
through acceleration. Note that ions with a stronger charge can be accelerated more
rapidly towards the target and, thus, implanted to greater depths. Nonetheless, ion
implantation normally targets only the top 1 µm of the substrate. It is possible to
implant ions to a depth of 4 µm into the surface of the substrate, but this can leave
it mildly radioactive (it will have to be subjected to a cooling period).
Ion implantation has several advantages over thermal diffusion, such as the
following:
•
It is carried out at room temperature (but the substrate will get hot
unless mounted on a cooled chuck).

42
Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
• It is isotropic.
• It can be used with far more elements than thermal diffusion (oxygen
can be implanted, for instance, to form an insulating layer beneath the
surface of the wafer).
One application of ion implantation in electronics is to create self-aligned
gates on transistors. This effectively utilizes part of the electrical structure of the
transistor as the mask (see Figure 2.7). Ion implantation is not, however, a magical
process by which the impurities simply appear in their targeted locations. When
passing through the wafer, there is a chance that ions will cause damage to the
crystal lattice on the way.
2.5 WAFER SPECIFICATIONS
The ﬁrst thing to consider when ordering the wafer is the dopant and the degree
of doping required. This will normally be done by specifying the resistivity of
the material — for example, p-type (boron), 10 to 30 Ωcm.
Silicon ingots are sawn into individual wafers. In addition to the diameter of
the resulting wafer, the thickness, crystal orientation, and ﬂats should be speciﬁed.
Wafers are supplied with diameters of 2, 4, 6, 8, or even 12 in. (50, 100, 150,
200, or 300 mm). Wafers of 2-in. diameters and the equipment required to process
them are becoming rare, except for wafers composed enpotic materials. At the time
of writing, 12-in. wafers are only available in the most advanced IC fabs, and
most MEMS work is performed on 4- and 6-in. wafers.
Wafer suppliers will normally supply wafers with what are regarded as opti-
mal thickness — around 525 µm for 4- or 6-in. wafers. Thicker wafers waste
silicon, and thinner wafers stand a greater chance of breaking during processing.
It is possible, however, to specify wafers from several millimeters thick to about
10 µm thick (Figure 2.5). Very thin wafers are ﬂexible. During processing these
will need to be bonded to a thicker supporting wafer. Very thin wafers are
produced by grinding and chemical–mechanical polishing of thicker wafers. Note
that the thickness will vary across the wafer because of the natural variations in
the mechanical machining process.
Crystal orientation is speciﬁed as the plane along which the ingot is cut, and
tolerance may also be speciﬁed. It is normal to grind ﬂats on the sides of the
wafer (see Figure 2.5a). These are speciﬁed by the purchaser (e.g., 4-in.-diameter
(100) wafer with one (110) ﬂat), although there is a loose convention that p-type
wafers have one ﬂat ground and n-type wafers have two. These ﬂats are useful
for aligning the wafer for anisotropic etching, but it should be recalled that they
are mechanically produced and will not align exactly to the crystal plane.
Finally, single- or double-sided polishing, as appropriate, should be speciﬁed.
If photolithography is to be performed on both sides of the wafer, then it is
necessary to specify double-sided polishing.
Further reﬁnements may be added to the speciﬁcation. Silicon-on-insulator
(SOI) wafers are becoming increasingly popular for MEMS applications. These

normally consist of a standard-thickness wafer with a thick (user speciﬁed —
usually about 1 µm) insulating silicon dioxide layer on the surface. A second
wafer is bonded to this and etched back to provide a sandwich structure of a few
microns of silicon on top of a 1-µm oxide layer on a standard silicon wafer. This
is referred to as a bonded and etched-back SOI (BESOI). Other methods of
producing SOI wafers include ion implantation (a very thin oxide layer being
produced within a micron or so of the surface) and silicon-on-sapphire wafers.
Most suppliers will offer to deposit various thin ﬁlms over the surface of the
wafer. The foremost of which is the growth of an epitaxial silicon layer (epi layer),
FIGURE 2.5 (a) 3-mm thick 6-in. diameter wafer, (b) 10-µm-thick 4-in.-diameter wafer.

which provides a device-quality surface for circuit fabrication. Silicon dioxide,
silicon nitride, and aluminum ﬁlms are also commonly provided on request.
Wafer suppliers are also normally able to supply glass wafers (Figure 2.6),
which are also commonly used for MEMS devices, III–V (three–ﬁve) semicon-
ductor wafers (i.e., gallium arsenide, or GaAs, which is used for RF, optical, and
high-frequency electronic circuits and, less frequently, for MEMS), sapphire
wafers, and other unusual materials. Some can also supply other shapes in silicon,
such as cylinders, etc.
One ﬁnal point to recall is that a very thin native oxide layer forms on silicon
when exposed to air. This can be stripped by dipping the wafers in a wet oxide
etch prior to processing, but for critical processes, it may be necessary to perform
a sequence of processing steps in an evacuated chamber without breaking the
vacuum, for which special equipment is required.

2.6
THIN FILMS
There are a number of different techniques that facilitate the deposition or for-
mation of very thin ﬁlms (on the order of micrometers or less) of different
materials on a silicon wafer or other suitable substrate. These ﬁlms can then be
patterned using photolithographic techniques and suitable etching techniques.
Common materials include silicon dioxide (oxide), silicon nitride (nitride), poly-
crystalline silicon (polysilicon or poly), and aluminum.
A number of other materials can be deposited as thin ﬁlms, including noble
metals such as gold. Noble metals will contaminate microelectronic circuitry, causing
it to fail, so silicon wafers with noble metals on them have to be processed using
equipment specially set aside for the purpose. Noble-metal ﬁlms are often patterned
by a method known as lift off, rather than wet or dry etching. Other thin-ﬁlm materials
that are gaining in popularity are very hardwearing such as silicon carbide, diamond-
like carbon, and diamond (deposited as a polycrystalline thin ﬁlm).
Often, a photoresist is not tough enough to withstand the etching required.
In such cases, a thin ﬁlm of a tougher material (e.g., oxide or nitride) is deposited
and patterned using photolithography. The oxide or nitride then acts as an etch
mask during etching of the underlying material. When the underlying material
has been fully etched, the masking layer is stripped away.
2.6.1 MATERIALS AND DEPOSITION
There are a variety of different methods that can be used to deposit ﬁlms of
different materials; each method has its strengths and weaknesses, and each
method is suited to different materials. It is possible to make the following general
points as an introduction:
•
Different deposition techniques produce different qualities of ﬁlms.
•
Films may contain impurities.
•
Films may contain pin holes.

•
Equipment may be contaminated if used for the deposition of different
materials.
•
Deposited ﬁlms will often be under mechanical stress.
•
Deposited ﬁlms must adhere (usually by forming strong [covalent]
chemical bonds).
•
Different materials have different melting points (i.e., high-temperature
processes cannot be carried out after depositing a material of low
melting point).
•
Different materials will have different coefﬁcients of thermal expansion
(this may cause cracking, wrinkling, or delamination during fabrication).
•
Some deposition processes may coat all exposed surfaces (i.e., be
conformal); others may not coat vertical sidewalls at all (this being
described as the degree of “step coverage”).
Because the properties of the deposited material are so dependent on the
deposition process, it is common to use both the name of the process and the name
of the material together; thus: LTO, meaning low-temperature oxide, aka LPCVD
oxide, is a ﬁlm of silicon dioxide deposited by the low-pressure chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) technique. Additional comments on thin-ﬁlm materials will,
therefore, be left until after discussion of the deposition processes. Table 2.1 intro-
duces the most common thin-ﬁlm materials that can be found in silicon fabs.

Common deposition processes are shown in Table 2.2 along with some comments.
Thermal diffusion has also been included for comparison.
In most of the processes described, the thickness of the ﬁlm is mainly deter-
mined by the time taken in depositing it (deposition time).

Thermal oxidation can only be applied to exposed silicon. The substrate is
immersed in a furnace at a temperature of above 1000°C in an oxygen-rich
atmosphere. Steam may also be introduced (wet thermal oxidation). A chemical
reaction takes place at the surface of the wafer, whereby silicon is converted to
silicon dioxide. This produces a very-high-quality conformal ﬁlm, but because
the oxygen molecules have to diffuse through a thickening layer of silicon dioxide
before they can react with the silicon, the process is very slow. The thickness of
the resulting ﬁlm can be controlled down to 10 nm or so, but ﬁlms in excess of
a few 100 nm are unusual because of the high temperatures and slow growth rate.
Notice that the ﬁlm is not deposited on the surface of the silicon; as it forms
(grows), then the underlying silicon is converted into the ﬁlm itself. Thermal
oxide ﬁlms used as sacriﬁcial layers can produce very small structures.
2.6.1.1.2
Chemical Vapor Deposition
CVD in its various forms produces a ﬁlm by reacting with precursor gases in a
chamber. The product of this reaction is deposited on the substrate as a thin ﬁlm.
There are two common derivative forms of CVD: low-pressure CVD (LPCVD)
and plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD), which achieve the results through slightly
different approaches. The kinetics, chemistry, and different reaction systems are
not dealt with here, and the reader is referred to more detailed texts [2].
All three forms are capable of depositing the basic insulators: silicon dioxide
(SiO2, or oxide) and silicon nitride (Si3N4, or nitride). Polycrystalline silicon
(polysilicon, or poly) can be deposited by CVD at medium to high temperatures,
although LPCVD processes are commonly used, and it is also possible to deposit
epitaxial silicon layers by CVD. PECVD can be used to produce a form of
polysilicon contaminated with hydrogen; this has found application in solar cells
and similar devices. Generally speaking, the higher-temperature processes pro-
duce higher-quality ﬁlms. LPCVD oxide can be enhanced by densiﬁcation —
heating to high temperatures in a furnace in an oxygen or wet oxygen atmosphere.
PECVD ﬁlms (oxide, nitride, and poly) are normally contaminated with consid-
erable amounts of hydrogen. This reduces their qualities as electrical insulators
and makes them etch faster. On the other hand, PECVD ﬁlms normally grow
faster than LPCVD, which, in turn grow faster than CVD, which is faster than
thermal oxidation. So, PECVD can normally be used to deposit relatively thick
ﬁlms (microns).
A further factor limiting ﬁlm thickness and the structures that can be created is
mechanical stress in the deposited ﬁlms. Too much stress will lead to the structure
buckling or the ﬁlms’ wrinkling or cracking. High-temperature nitride ﬁlms have a

particular problem: they exhibit high tensile stresses within the ﬁlm and cannot be
deposited directly onto silicon. A stress-relieving layer of oxide is required. It is not
advisable to attempt PECVD nitride deposition directly onto silicon, unless this
particular process has been very well characterized for MEMS applications. Note
that processes that produce the best electronic devices do not necessarily produce the
best mechanical devices. It is possible to control the stress in ﬁlms by altering the
deposition parameters or the composition of the resulting ﬁlm (using PECVD to
deposit a hydrogen-contaminated silicon oxynitride layer, for instance). The mechan-
ical, electrical, and chemical (etching) properties of the ﬁlm will all be affected by
the deposition parameters used, so it is necessary to carefully characterize and monitor
each process (a demanding and time-consuming job) or seek out a foundry that has
experience with the processes required for the device under development.
One oxide CVD process, TEOS has become quite popular. This is a LPCVD
process based on tetraethoxysilane (i.e., TEOS) and produces high-quality con-
formal oxide ﬁlms.
CVD processes are quite versatile. LPCVD is often used to deposit other
inorganic ﬁlms, such as silicon carbide, tungsten, and metal silicides. Carbon
ﬁlms that range from polycrystalline diamond (CVD processes) to diamond-like
carbon ﬁlms (PECVD) can be deposited. PECVD, in particular, is being exploited
to deposit polymeric ﬁlms (for example, parylene). A further form of CVD,
metalorganic CVD (MOCVD), is used to deposit III–V semiconductors (these
will not be dealt with here as they are not commonly used in MEMS as yet).
2.6.1.1.3 Sputter Deposition
The sputter deposition process is performed in a chamber at low pressures and
temperatures. A target consisting of the material that is to be deposited is placed
above the substrate, and a plasma of inert gas (argon) is formed in the chamber.
Oxide vs. Nitride
Oxide ﬁlms are excellent electrical insulators, easily deposited, and easily
etched (commonly wet-etched in buffered HF; see Subsection 2.6.2). Nitride
ﬁlms have higher stress but are mechanically harder and chemically more
resilient (to attach to and with respect to diffusion of ions or moisture). PECVD
nitride ﬁlms are extensively used as protective coatings.  
Signs of Stress
Stress in ﬁlms may cause one of the following several problems:
•
Cracking or wrinkling of the ﬁlm
•
Strings peeling off from sharp corners
•
Twisting or buckling of structures (particularly, cantilever beams)
•
Buckling of the silicon wafer (in extreme cases)

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
The ions of the plasma are accelerated towards the target, where they knock atoms
from its surface. Some of these displaced atoms make their way to the substrate
where they settle, forming a thin ﬁlm with a chemical composition and structure
which approximates that of the target. Deposition rates are controllable and can
be relatively high. Sputtering is commonly used to deposit metal ﬁlms and, less
commonly, to deposit simple inorganic compounds.
2.6.1.1.4 Evaporation
The substrate is placed in a chamber opposite a source (target) of the material that
is to be deposited. The chamber is evacuated, and the material is heated to form a
vapor in the chamber, which condenses on the substrate (and the walls of the
chamber, etc.). The heating is normally effected by a ﬁlament (or sometimes
inductive heating of a crucible) or an electron beam, giving rise to thermal or e-
beam evaporation processes. As a result, the materials involved are usually limited;
evaporation is commonly used to deposit elemental metals, particularly the noble
metals. It is important to select an appropriate combination of source, ﬁlament,
crucible, etc., to avoid contamination problems (facility manuals or the literature,
e.g., Vossen and Kern [2], should be referred to if in doubt). This is a line-of-sight
process, so step coverage is usually very poor, but it is at a low temperature and
(depending on the material) does not usually result in high-stress ﬁlms.
High-purity targets and sources for sputtering or evaporation are readily
available from specialist suppliers.
2.6.1.1.5 Spinning
The section on photoresist processing in Chapter 1 introduced spin-coating as a
method for applying ﬁlms of photoresist prior to processing. By varying the solvent
content and viscosity of the ﬁlm, and the spin speed and proﬁle, it is possible to
apply ﬁlms from less than 1 µm thick to 100 or 200 µm thick in a single step. It is
even possible, with some trial and error, to form a reasonable coating on fairly
rough (micromachined) substrates, although spray-coating is generally preferred.
The spin-coating process can be adapted to apply to a variety of different
materials. Of particular interest in micromachining work is the application of
solgels. These are suspensions of very ﬁne (nanometer dimension) ceramic in a
liquid. A ﬁlm is applied by spinning, and then the substrate and applied ﬁlm are
heated in an oven or furnace to drive off the liquid and to melt or fuse the ﬁlm
into a continuous ceramic layer. This approach is used, particularly, for the
application of low-melting-point glasses (these formulations may be referred to
as spin-on glass [SOG]) and piezoelectric materials (e.g., PZT). Coatings applied
in this manner will typically be a few microns thick, and uniformity and consis-
tency of coating can be a problem.

mon thin-film materials (note that not all deposition methods are listed for each

Annealing
One process often referred to is annealing. Once a ﬁlm has been deposited,
the workpiece is heated in a furnace to a particular temperature for a particular
time, usually in an inert atmosphere, and then cooled (sometimes, in a con-
trolled manner). This changes the properties of the ﬁlm; the atoms rearrange,
usually, into a more ordered structure, and some more volatile compounds
(e.g., hydrogen in PECVD ﬁlms) get driven off to some extent. The resulting
ﬁlm is usually of a better quality and may have fewer pinholes, and the stress
characteristics may have changed. Annealing may involve high temperatures,
and therefore it cannot always be employed.

2.6.2 WET ETCHING
Wet etching is a general term for the removal of material by immersing the wafer
in a liquid bath of the chemical etchant. Wet etchants fall into two broad catego-
ries: isotropic and anisotropic etchants.
Isotropic etchants attack the material being etched at the same rate in all
directions. Anisotropic etchants attack the (material) silicon wafer at different
rates in different directions, and therefore there is more control of the shapes
produced. Some etchants attack silicon at different rates depending on the con-
centration of the impurities in the silicon (concentration-dependent etching).
Isotropic etchants are available for oxide, nitride, aluminum, polysilicon,
gold, and silicon. Because isotropic etchants attack the material at the same rate
in all directions, they remove material horizontally under the etch mask (under-
cutting) at the same rate as they etch through the material. This is illustrated for
a thin ﬁlm of oxide on a silicon wafer in Figure 2.8; here, an etchant that etches
the oxide faster than the underlying silicon (e.g., hydroﬂuoric acid) is used. The
characteristics of some of the more common wet etchants are listed in Table 2.4.
The interested reader can ﬁnd a number of comprehensive reviews of the topic,
such as that by Williams and Muller [3] and Kern and Deckert [4].

Hydroﬂuoric acid (HF) is commonly used to etch oxides. The stronger
concentrations are used to rapidly strip oxides or as a dip etch, whereas when
buffered with ammonium ﬂuoride it is used to pattern oxides. The latter is
known as buffered HF (BHF) or buffered oxide etch (BOE); its etch rate is
more controlled because of the buffering, and it does not peel photoresist as
does more concentrated HF. Phosphoric acid in various combinations with other
compounds is used to etch either nitride or aluminum; oxide is commonly used
as the mask (phosphoric acid attacks photoresist). Isotropic silicon etchants are
based on hydroﬂuoric and nitric acids in combination with either methanol or
water. These can be formulated for etch rates that vary from polishing to wafer-
thinning applications.
Note that most etches will strip aluminum from a wafer, including the Piranha
etch, which was introduced in Chapter 1 for precleaning substrates. Gold is
commonly etched with an iodine-based solution, but noble metals are also etched
by aqua regia, a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids (3:1).
Most wet etches are purchased premixed directly from specialist dealers
because handling them is very dangerous. Notice also that some wet-etching
processes have to be performed at high temperatures or under reﬂux conditions
(i.e., the etching solution is boiled in an apparatus ﬁtted with a condenser so that
no vapor is lost to the environment). Concentrations are normally given in ratio
by volume of standard (as supplied) components. Percentage values are normally
given by weight. This 10:1 HF is in fact ten parts of HF to one part water, the
HF being supplied as 49% by weight HF (the remainder being water). Water in
a clean room will normally be deionized (DI) and ﬁltered.
Anisotropic etchants that etch different crystal planes in silicon at different
rates are available. The most popular anisotropic etchants are potassium hydroxide
(KOH) and tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH). Common anisotropic
etchants are compared in Table 2.5.
The simplest structures that can be formed using KOH to etch a silicon
wafer with the most common crystal orientation (100) are shown in Figure 2.9.
These are V-shaped grooves or pits with right-angled corners and sloping
sidewalls. Using wafers with different crystal orientations can produce grooves
Postetch Rinsing
Immediately upon the completion of wet etching, the wafers are rinsed in DI
water. This is normally performed in a series of three basins connected by
small waterfalls. DI water is continually supplied so that the overspill from
the ﬁrst ﬂows into the second, and the second ﬂows into the third. The output
is monitored by either a conductivity or pH meter, and ﬂows into an acid drain.
The etched wafers are placed ﬁrst in the basin nearest to the inlet and then
moved forward.

or pits with vertical walls. Both oxide and nitride etch slowly in KOH. Oxide
can be used as an etch mask for short periods (i.e., for shallow grooves and
pits). For longer periods, nitride is a better etch mask as it etches more slowly
in the KOH.
High levels of boron in silicon will reduce the rate at which it is etched in
KOH by several orders of magnitude, effectively stopping the etching of the

boron-rich silicon. This is termed concentration-dependent etching. The boron
impurities are usually introduced into the silicon by diffusion. A thick oxide mask
is formed over the silicon wafer and patterned to expose the surface of the silicon
wafer onto which the boron is to be introduced (Figure 2.10a). The wafer is then
placed in a furnace in contact with a boron-diffusion source. Over a period of
time, boron atoms migrate into the silicon wafer. Once the boron diffusion is
completed, the oxide mask is stripped off (Figure 2.10b).
A second mask may then be deposited and patterned (Figure 2.10c) before
the wafer is immersed in the KOH etch bath. The KOH etches the silicon that is
not protected by the mask and etches around the boron-doped silicon (Figure
2.10d).
Boron can be driven into the silicon as far as 20 µm over periods of 15 to
20 h; however, it is desirable to keep the time in the furnace as short as possible.
With complex designs, etching the wafer from the front in KOH may cause
problems when slow-etching crystal planes prevent it from etching beneath the
boron-doped silicon. In such cases, the wafer can be etched from the back;
however, this is not without disadvantages (longer etching times, more expen-
sive wafers, etc.). The high concentration of boron required means that the
microelectronic circuitry cannot be fabricated directly on the boron-doped
structure.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
2.6.3 DRY ETCHING
There are various etching processes that are carried out in a chamber at low
pressure, using either inert or reactive gasses. The two principle advantages for
MEMS processing are the following:
•
Higher selectivity of target material over masking material
•
No problems with surface tension causing microstructures to bend and
adhere
There are two main classes of dry etching: reactive ion etching (RIE), which
involves chemical processes, and ion beam milling, which involves purely phys-
ical processes.
2.6.3.1
Relative Ion Etching
This is the most common form of dry etching for micromachining applications
(a summary can be found in Williams and Muller [3], and the processes are
described in detail in Vossen and Kern [2]). A plasma of reactive ions is created
in a chamber, and these react chemically with the material to be etched. In its
most basic form (embodied as the barrel etcher), RIE is an isotropic etch; however,
it is more often used as an anisotropic etch. In this form, the reactive ions are
accelerated toward the material to be etched, and etching is enhanced in the
direction of the travel. Deep trenches and pits (up to several microns) of arbitrary
shape and with vertical walls can be etched in a variety of materials including
Improving Results
Ragged lines are usually a symptom of poor masking or poor mask adhesion.
Make sure the substrate is clean, check if an adhesion promoter is required
for the photoresist, check the resist manufacturer’s guidelines, check with
shorter etch times, and make sure the etch solution is not contaminated. With
isotropic silicon etchants, surface ﬁnish can usually be improved by adding to
the recipe (check the literature for this).
Cavities appearing beneath the mask are usually due to pinholes in the
mask. If using photoresist, check as stated earlier. If a thin-ﬁlm mask is being
used, try and improve the quality of the ﬁlm or perform multiple depositions.
Try an alternative ﬁlm (chrome can sometimes be used). With some anisotropic
etchants (KOH or EDP), try etching in the dark.
Uneven etching can be avoided by agitating, stirring, or bubbling air
through the etch bath to ensure that fresh solution circulates. If small holes
are not being completely etched, this may be due to poor solution access —
surfactants added to the etch (e.g., sodium lauryth sulfate) or use of ultrasound
(particularly if the process develops gas).

silicon, oxide, and nitride. Unlike anisotropic wet etching, RIE is not limited by
the crystal planes in the silicon.
There has been considerable development of deep RIE (DRIE) processes for
MEMS, aimed at creating structures with vertical sidewalls and high aspect ratios
(the height-to-width ratio). The most successful of these has been the Bosch
process [5]. This involves repeatedly changing the system over from RIE to CVD
functions. Following a period of etching, a layer of polymer is deposited to protect
the sidewalls of the structure from further etching leading to an extremely aniso-
tropic etch process capable of creating structures of several tens of microns deep
in silicon with very vertical sidewalls.
Oxygen RIE is increasingly used in MEMS fabrication. In the ﬁrst instance,
it is used as an isotropic etch to strip polymer ﬁlms — the ashing process. Polymer
ﬁlms used as sacriﬁcial layers can be readily removed by plasma ashing. Its
second application is to modify the surface of problem materials to improve
adhesion, a brief exposure to oxygen plasma can help considerably with ﬁlms
such as polytetraﬂuoro ethylene (PTFE). Note, however, that exposure to oxygen
plasma will also have the effect of oxidizing other exposed surfaces, such as
silicon. Argon plasma may also be used to roughen surfaces without chemically
changing them.
2.6.3.2
Ion-Beam Milling
This process uses inert ions accelerated from a source to physically remove
material. There are two forms, showered-ion-beam milling (SIBM) and focused-
ion-beam milling (FIBM). The former showers the entire substrate with energetic
ions, whereas in the latter ions are focused to a spot that is directed to a particular
part of the workpiece.
Incomplete Etching
As with wet etching, the gases of the RIE process need to gain access to the
material to be etched. As a result, very-narrow-diameter holes may etch more
slowly than larger holes. For this reason, it is desirable to over-etch to ensure
that all structures have been etched completely. The point at which a plasma
etcher ﬁnally etches through one layer to the one beneath can be identiﬁed as
the plasma changes color.  
Doped Oxides
Phosphosilicate glass (PSG) and borosilicate glass (BSG) have different etch-
ing characteristics to (pure) silicon dioxide when etched by reactive means
(both wet and dry). PSG tends to etch a lot more rapidly than plain oxide, and
hence can be useful as a sacriﬁcial material.

58
Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
SIBM can be used as much as RIE, although it is generally slower and more
controlled. FIBM can be used to trim structures to dimensions of approximately
10 nm.
2.6.4 LIFTOFF
Liftoff is a stenciling technique often used to pattern noble-metal ﬁlms. There
are a number of different techniques; the one outlined here is an assisted-liftoff
method.
A thin ﬁlm of the assisting material (e.g., oxide) is deposited. A layer of resist
is put over this and patterned, as for photolithography, to expose the oxide in the
pattern desired for the metal (Figure 2.11a). The oxide is then wet-etched so as
to undercut the resist (Figure 2.11b). The metal is then deposited on the wafer,
typically by evaporation (Figure 2.11c). The metal pattern is effectively stenciled
Dry Etching and Sputtering
One question that could be asked is where does all the material go that is
removed through physical processes? If the dry-etching process is not tuned,
then the material can be sputtered onto adjacent areas, resulting in the growth
of grass. As a further aside, note that the sputter-deposition process can also
be reversed to achieve a form of dry etching. Also, note that the grass in the
area being etched may be caused by dirt on the surface of the substrate acting
as a kind of etch mask.

through the gaps in the resist, which is then removed, lifting off the unwanted
metal with it (Figure 2.11d). The assisting layer is then stripped off too, leaving
the metal pattern alone (Figure 2.11e).
In the assisted-liftoff method, an intermediate layer assists in the process to
ensure a clean liftoff and well-deﬁned metal pattern. When noble metals are used,
it is desirable to deposit a thin layer of a more active metal (e.g., chrome) ﬁrst
to ensure good adhesion of the noble metal. There are liftoff techniques in which
only a (negative) photoresist is used as the stencil, and special liftoff resists are
becoming available. One further method that is used to achieve the negative
(overhanging) sidewalls required for liftoff is to use an image-reversal process.
This enables a positive photoresist (AZ5214) to be used; the exact process varies
from laboratory to laboratory. Following the initial exposure step, the acid pro-
duced as part of the resist chemistry is neutralized near the surface using ammonia
or is driven off in a second baking step, and the entire resist is then ﬂood-exposed
to UV and developed.
2.7 STRUCTURES IN SILICON
Silicon microstructures are formed by combining the aforementioned techniques
in various ways. Most structures in silicon are fabricated using either bulk or
surface micromachining processes. Bulk micromachining involves the selective
removal of material from the bulk of the silicon wafer to form the desired
structure. Surface micromachining involves the creation of microstructures by
the successive deposition and patterning of sacriﬁcial and structural layers on the
surface of the silicon wafer. This section considers some of the simpler structures
that can be created. Part II considers how these can be combined to create more
complex devices.
2.7.1 BULK SILICON MICROMACHINING
One of the simplest possible and most obvious structures is the patterning of
insulated electrical conductors. One possible application of this could be to use
electric ﬁelds to manipulate individual cells.
2.7.1.1 Pits, Mesas, Bridges, Beams, and Membranes
with KOH
Anisotropic etching with KOH can easily form V-shaped grooves or cut pits with
tapered walls into silicon (Figure 2.9 and Figure 2.12). Notice that because KOH
etching is anisotropic, arbitrary mask openings will eventually become limited
by speciﬁc planes. This is illustrated in Figure 2.13.
KOH can also be used to produce mesa structures (Figure 2.14a). When
etching mesa structures, the corners can become beveled (Figure 2.14b) rather
than right-angled. This has to be compensated for in some way. Typically,
the etch mask is designed to include additional structures on the corners.

These compensation structures are designed so that they are etched away entirely
when the mesa is formed to leave 90° corners. One problem with using compen-
sation structures to form right-angled mesa corners is that they put a limit on the
minimum spacing between the mesas.
Some examples of mask designs for corner compensation structures are
shown in Figure 2.15. These are aligned with speciﬁc crystal planes and are
designed to be etched completely away when the desired KOH etch depth has
been reached. The <110> aligned structures provide almost perfect corner com-
pensation but tend to be quite large. The exact dimensions of each structure have
to be computed, based on the etching conditions experienced in the clean room.
Details are provided in papers by Puers and Sansen [6], and Sandmaier et al. [7].
The simplest structure to implement is the square corner compensation structure
(Figure 2.15a). The dimensions of this (half of one side of the square) can be
approximated by:
(2.1)
(2.2)
where h is the etching depth (height of the mesa) and the units are all in micrometers.
Equation 2.1 was derived from Puers and Sansen’s etch rates experienced with
KOH + IPA solution (IPA is isopropyl alcohol, which some ﬁnd improves the
quality of KOH etches), and Equation 2.2 was derived from their results with KOH.

shapes, which may be multiplied (not to scale).
Alignment to Crystal Planes
Do not rely on ﬂats ground onto wafers to provide alignment to crystal planes.
These are mechanically ground on and will be aligned to within a speciﬁed
tolerance error. If more precise alignment is required, then an additional mask-
ing and KOH etch step has to be introduced to etch crystal plane alignment
marks into the wafer.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
The silicon diaphragm is the basic structure used to construct pressure sensors
and some accelerometers. Silicon diaphragms from about 50-µm and upward thick-
nesses can be made by etching through an entire wafer with KOH (Figure 2.16).
The thickness is controlled by timing the etch and, therefore, is subject to errors
induced by variability in the composition of the etching solution, other etching
conditions, and uniformity of the wafer.
Thinner diaphragms, of up to about 20-µm thickness, can be produced using
boron to stop the KOH etch (Figure 2.17) — concentration-dependent etching.
The thickness of the diaphragm is dependent on the depth to which the boron is
diffused into the silicon, which can be controlled more accurately than the simple,
timed KOH etch.
Concentration-dependent etching can also be used to produce narrow bridges
or cantilever beams. Figure 2.18a shows a bridge, deﬁned by a boron diffusion,
spanning a pit that was etched from the front of the wafer in KOH. A cantilever
beam (a bridge with one end free) produced by the same method is shown in
Figure 2.18b.
The bridge and beam in Figure 2.18 project across the diagonal of the pit to
ensure that they will be etched free by the KOH. More complex structures are
possible using this technique, but care must be taken to ensure that they will be
etched free by the KOH.
If it is desired to make beams or bridges of a different orientation, the wafer
can be etched through from the back in KOH (Figure 2.19). This will ensure that
the structure is released from the silicon. During such etching, it is necessary to
ensure that the front of the wafer is adequately protected from the long KOH
etch. Another alternative could be to produce a diaphragm, and etch the desired
bridge or beam shape using a reactive ion etcher (dry etching).

One of the applications for these beams and bridges is as resonant sensors.
The structure can be set vibrating at its fundamental frequency. Anything causing
a change in the mass, length, etc., of the structure will register as a change
frequency. Care has to be taken to ensure that only the quantity to be measured
causes a signiﬁcant change in frequency.
2.7.1.2 Fine Points through Wet and Dry Etching
A combination of dry etching and isotropic wet etching can be used to form very
sharp points. First, a column with vertical sides is etched away using an RIE
(Figure 2.20a). A wet etch is then used, which undercuts the etch mask, leaving
a very ﬁne point (Figure 2.20b). The etch mask is then removed.
Very ﬁne points such as these can be fabricated at the end of the cantilever
beams as probes for use in atomic force microscopy. The technique can also be
used to produce sharp, small blades.

2.7.1.3 RIE Pattern Transfer
RIE can be quite aggressive on the mask material used. Some practitioners have,
however, used this to good advantage when etching structures in silicon. If the
selectivity of silicon over oxide has been well characterized for a particular process
as 100:1, for example, then this provides a way by which the etch depth can be
carefully controlled. An oxide mask of 200-nm thickness, e.g., is deposited and
patterned on the surface of the wafer. The wafer is then etched until the oxide has
been completely removed, which should be apparent from the color of the plasma.
As a result, the pattern from the oxide mask will have been transferred into the silicon
wafer and will now be 20 µm deep due to the differing etch rates of the two materials.
2.7.1.4 Reﬂow
This is not, strictly speaking, a bulk micromachining technique nor is it limited
to silicon-based processes. It can be used to achieve a variety of interesting effects
such as creating smooth wavelike surfaces or spheres or for ﬁlling in around tall
structures and deep trenches. It is commonly performed with TEOS, although it
can be used with other materials including some photoresists and other polymer
ﬁlms. Solder reﬂowing is a common procedure in many electronics processes
and can be adapted to produce interesting microstructures.
The material in question is deposited and patterned. The substrate with the
patterned material is then brought up to its melting point and the material reﬂows.
By controlling the timing and temperature, as well as the patterning, it is possible
to achieve a variety of effects. Stripes can be reﬂowed to form a more rounded
corrugated surface, isolated islands can be made to form semispherical structures
(see Figure 2.21), or trenches can be (partially) ﬁlled.
2.7.2 SURFACE MICROMACHINING
In contrast to bulk micromachining, where, as discussed in the previous section,
structures are created by removing material from the bulk of the silicon wafer or
substrate, surface micromachining involves the gradual building up and patterning
of thin ﬁlms on the surface of the wafer to create the ﬁnal structure. The process
would typically employ ﬁlms of two different materials, a structural material

(commonly polysilicon) and a sacriﬁcial material (oxide). These are deposited
and dry-etched in sequence. Finally, the sacriﬁcial material is wet-etched away
to release the structure. The more layers, the more complex the structure and the
more difﬁcult it becomes to fabricate. More recently, polymers such as photore-
sists have been used as the sacriﬁcial layer, particularly in simple surface micro-
machining processes. These are removed by plasma-ashing, which, being a dry
etch, avoids the problems caused by surface tension.
A simple surface-micromachined cantilever beam is shown in Figure 2.22.
A sacriﬁcial layer of oxide is deposited on the surface of the wafer. A layer of
polysilicon is then deposited and patterned, using RIE techniques to a beam with
an anchor pad (Figure 2.22a). The wafer is then wet-etched to remove the oxide
layer under the beam, freeing it (Figure 2.22b). The anchor pad is under-etched;
however, the wafer is removed from the etch bath before all the oxide is removed
from beneath the pad, leaving the beam attached to the wafer.
This is not a very practical process. It demands that the etching rate of the
oxide be well known in advance. Also, it would probably be a good idea to etch
a number of holes through the beam itself to ensure that the wet etch has sufﬁcient
access to the underlying oxide. (In fact, almost all surface-micromachined

structures have this characteristic grid pattern.) Finally comes the problem of
surface tension. Aqueous (water-based) etches, and subsequent washing in DI,
will cause the cantilever tip to bend and come into contact with the silicon wafer.
When the structure is dried, the tip will remain stuck to the wafer.
There are a number of approaches that can be taken to alleviate this problem:
substitution of the water with volatile organic compounds before drying, use of
dry etching, or critical-point drying. The simplest approach is to rinse the wafer
ﬁrst in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and then acetone, and then dry it. This is not a
particularly reliable approach, however, and acetone leaves a residue on the wafer.
(Soaking in acetone is normally used to remove resist; in this case the process is
reversed — acetone, IPA, DI — to clean the wafer.)
The use of anisotropic reactive-ion etching to release micromachined struc-
tures has become quite popular. A couple of points to note are that the RIE etch
(release) rate will depend on the lateral diffusion of the ions, so it is not partic-
ularly suited to under-etch long distances; structures released by RIE are often
more hole than structural material (i.e. lattice-like). Secondly, if long RIE times
are required, it is best to be aware that some of the structural material may be
removed as well, because etches are not perfectly selective.
The third option mentioned was the use of critical-point-drying equipment
or carbon dioxide dryers. These can be purchased as specialist units and can dry
the substrate without causing surface tension problems.
A variety of different chambers can be fabricated on the surface of silicon
wafers, using surface micromachining techniques. In Figure 2.23, the chamber
is deﬁned by a volume of sacriﬁcial oxide (Figure 2.23a). A layer of polysilicon
is then deposited over the surface of the wafer (Figure 2.23b). A window is dry-
etched (RIE) through the polysilicon, and the wafer is then immersed in a wet
etch that removes the oxide, leaving a windowed chamber (Figure 2.23c).
Surface micromachining can produce quite complicated structures such as
microengineered tweezers and gear trains.
Wet Etching and Micromachined Structures
Even if surface tensions are addressed, surface-micromachined structures can
be delicate to the extent that the manner in which they are withdrawn from
the ﬁnal etch bath can damage them or cause sticking.

2.7.3 ELECTROCHEMICAL ETCHING OF SILICON
A variety of electrochemical silicon-etching techniques are under develop-
ment. One of these is the electrochemical passivation technique. A wafer with
a particular impurity concentration is used, and different impurities are diffused
(or implanted) into the wafer. This is done to form a diode junction at the boundary
between the differently doped areas of silicon; this will delineate the structure to
be produced. An electrical potential is then applied across the diode junction, and
the wafer is immersed in a suitable wet etch (KOH). This is done in such a way
that when the etch reaches the junction, an oxide layer (passivation layer) is
formed, which protects the silicon from further etching.
This is another bulk silicon micromachining technique and is essentially
similar to the boron-etch-stop technique (concentration-dependent etching). The
structures that can be produced are similar to those produced by the boron etch-
stop technique. The main advantage of the electrochemical method is that much
lower concentrations of impurities are required, and therefore the resulting struc-
ture is more compatible with the fabrication of microelectronic circuitry. It is
essential to ensure that the required electrical potential is distributed evenly across
the wafer to all necessary parts, and this may involve addition of a conducting
layer or other design considerations.
2.7.4 POROUS SILICON
Microporous silicon is created by an electrolytic process. The silicon wafer is
immersed in HF, and an electrical current is passed across the interface. Where
the silicon is exposed to both the HF and the current, a very complex (submicron)
porous structure is formed. The porosity can be controlled to some extent by
varying the parameters used.
In addition to providing an unusual structure for use in MEMS (and elec-
tronic) devices, porous silicon has a vast surface-to-volume ratio, and conse-
quently it is etched much more rapidly than normal silicon. By selectively anod-
izing different areas of the wafer (using a suitable insulating layer) and then
etching away the porous silicon, it is possible to form interesting structures.
2.7.5 WAFER BONDING
There are a number of different methods available for bonding micromachined
silicon wafers together, or to other substrates, to form larger, more complex devices.
A method of bonding silicon to glass that is particularly popular is anodic
bonding (electrostatic bonding). The silicon wafer and glass substrate are brought
together and heated to a high temperature (several hundred degrees Celsius). A large
electric ﬁeld is applied across the join, which causes an extremely strong bond to
form between the two materials. This bond is formed by ions in the glass that
migrate towards the join, and there are obvious limitations on the types of glass
that can be used; in particular, the coefﬁcient of thermal expansion has to be close
to that of silicon. Both Pyrex and borosilicate glass can be used.

68
Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
It is also possible to bond silicon wafers directly together using gentle pressure
under water (direct silicon bonding).
Other bonding methods include using an adhesive layer, such as a spin-on-
glass or photoresist. Whereas anodic bonding and direct silicon bonding form
very strong joins, they suffer from some disadvantages, including the requirement
that the surfaces to be joined are very ﬂat and clean. This can be overcome to
some extent by using an adhesive layer.
Figure 2.24 shows a glass plate bonded over a channel etched into a silicon
wafer (RIE), forming a pipe through which ﬂuid can ﬂow. Wafer-bonding tech-
niques can potentially be combined with some of the basic micromachined struc-
tures to form the valves, pumps, etc., of a microﬂuid-handling system.
2.8
WAFER DICING
After wire bonding and packaging, wafer dicing is one of the more expensive
processes that a device can undergo. This is because it is at this point that devices
start being handled individually, so losing some of the economy inherent in batch
production. Also, wafer dicing is often a mechanically stressful process. The three
common techniques employed to break a silicon wafer up into individual chips
or dies are as follows:
•
Dicing saw
•
Diamond scribe
•
Laser
The wafer is normally afﬁxed to an adhesive plastic membrane throughout
the dicing process.
2.8.1 THE DICING SAW
This is probably the most common approach to wafer dicing. A diamond saw blade
is used, and cuts of less than 100 µm can be made with 10-µm accuracy in position.
Thus, dies with dimensions of only 1 or 2 mm per side can be produced. One of
the caveats to be aware of is that because this is a process in which mechanical
force is applied to the wafer, it can damage delicate micromachined structures,
particularly surface-micromachined devices. Debris may also be deposited on the
surface of the wafer, particularly in the vicinity of the saw blade.
FIGURE 2.24 Forming a microchannel by bonding a glass plate over an etched silicon
wafer.

Silicon Micromachining
69
It is normal to position the saw blade in such a way that it cuts completely through
the wafer. It is possible, however, to position it so that it only cuts partway through
the wafer (several tens of micrometers). By making many such cuts, it is possible to
form trench-like or pillar-like structures, depending on the depth and spacing of the
cuts (Figure 2.25). These have been combined with wet silicon etching to produce
arrays of spikes (Figure 2.25c); the process involves repeated dipping and withdrawal
of the structure from the etch solution in order to achieve a smooth tapered point. 
2.8.2 DIAMOND AND LASER SCRIBE
An alternative to using the dicing saw to break up the wafer is to break it along one
of the major crystal planes. This assumes, of course, that the individual chips have
been laid out aligned to an appropriate cleavage plane. A diamond-tipped scribe is
then drawn over the surface of the wafer to create a scratch, and ﬂexing the wafer
causes it to break along this imperfection. Alternatively, a laser can be used to create
a series of small craters along which the wafer will be broken; this is usually
performed on the backside of the wafer to prevent ejected material and heat from
damaging the devices on the front side. Note also that silicon is transparent to infrared
light and therefore, an appropriate wavelength has to be carefully selected.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
2.8.3 RELEASING STRUCTURES BY KOH ETCHING
Particularly in the case of bulk micromachined structures, it is possible to consider
using anisotropic etching techniques to separate the individual dies. It is usually
a good idea to include some structures to hold the die into what remains of the
wafer until they are required, otherwise it will be necessary to ﬁsh them out from
the bottom of the etch container.
Figure 2.26 gives an example of how this may be achieved. The devices
are deﬁned by a deep boron diffusion, and the wafer is etched from the back
in KOH to release them. Rather than etch through the entire wafer, a nitride
mask is deposited on the back of the wafer and patterned to open up windows
beneath each device. This turns the wafer into a silicon frame, and thin bridges
are formed to hold each device into the frame so that they may be broken out
as required.
FIGURE 2.26 (a) A structure or device has been deﬁned by boron diffusion (black) into
the surface of a wafer, (b) following KOH etching of a window from the back of the wafer,
the main area of the device remains attached to a silicon frame by thin bridges that can
easily be broken.
KOH Etching through a Wafer
Depending on the thickness of the wafer, this will take some time (several
hours). Nitride is normally used as the etch mask, and only nitride and noble
metals may be exposed on the front side. Additional protection is often used.
This may take several forms such as the following:
•
“Black wax” (Apiezon) usually dissolved in toluene and painted on.
It has a high melting point but many ﬁnd it unsatisfactory when
used alone. It can also be difﬁcult to remove.
•
A dummy wafer taped (using PTFE) onto the front of the wafer to
be etched, often used with a layer of black wax in between.
•
A specially designed jig with a seal that keeps the front of the wafer
protected from the KOH solution. Note that the front will have to
withstand short periods in KOH while the etch goes to completion.

Silicon Micromachining
71
When using this technique (or just using KOH to etch through a wafer), it is
best to design the process so that the front side of the wafer does not have to be
protected throughout the long etching process (see box). This means that materials
unaffected by long periods on hot KOH (e.g., nitride, gold) are chosen; the bulk
of the wafer should be etched through before sensitive structures are formed on
the front. This can be done with SOI wafers.
Figure 2.27 illustrates this. The front of the wafer is protected by a PECVD
nitride layer while the KOH etch proceeds from the back through to the buried
oxide layer. The nitride layer is then stripped and material is deposited and
patterned on the front side of the wafer. Finally, RIE from the front releases the
individual devices or structures.
This is a very effective way to create and release microstructures. There are
two points to bear in mind, however. Firstly, the cavities in the back of the wafer
make it difﬁcult for vacuum chucks to hold it in place during various processes,
notably the spin-application. Secondly, regular cavities can form lines of mecha-
nical weakness that make the wafer move susceptible to fracture during processing.

3 Nonsilicon Processes
3.1
INTRODUCTION
There are a vast number of processes that can be used to micromachine and
microform materials other than silicon. Some of these, along with their common
applications, are introduced in this chapter. Several of them have cross over appli-
cations to silicon micromachining (electroplating, for example), and the chapter
begins with a technique that, for micromachining purposes, arose from silicon
processing and is still extensively applied in that ﬁeld.
3.2
CHEMICAL–MECHANICAL POLISHING
Chemical–mechanical polishing (CMP) is one of a range of processes that are
generally used to thin and process silicon wafers (also known as wafer lapping).
These can be applied to a wide variety of materials and can range from pure
mechanical grinding on an abrasive wheel to CMP, which usually involves an
abrasive powder suspended in a corrosive etching solution; in design, the mechan-
ical component removes the bulk of the material and the chemical process pro-
vides a highly polished ﬁnish.
The process was originally developed and used to thin and polish silicon
wafers sliced from the ingot. In recent years it has undergone considerable
development to assist in planarization, a key process in producing multiple metal
interconnection layers that the modern integrated circuit industry has come to
rely on. To create structures with small feature sizes, a very ﬂat surface is required
for photolithography and without planarization, only a few interconnection layers
(e.g., two poly and two metal) can be implemented.
The planarization process essentially involves deposition of a relatively thick
insulating layer and creation of a ﬂat planar surface using CMP while reducing
the thickness of the ﬁlm to a micron or so. The process can be used in microma-
chining, particularly where trenches or mesas cause problems with a subsequent
photolithography step. In such cases, the ﬁlm thickness and structural dimensions
involved are often greater than those involved in IC fabrication, and the material
used may well be stripped later to empty the trenches.
CMP can be applied to other materials and in other forms. It is allied to the
polishing processes used to prepare geological or metallurgical samples for elec-
tron microscopy, for instance. Alternatively, an abrasive slurry can be forced
through a structure to shape and polish it.

LIGA AND ELECTROPLATING
The acronym LIGA comes from the German words for the process (Lithographie,
Galvanoformung, Abformung). LIGA uses lithography, electroplating, and mold-
ing processes to produce microstructures. It is capable of creating very ﬁnely
deﬁned microstructures up to 1000 µm high. Micron feature sizes can theoretically
be implemented with aspect ratios as high as 1000:1, though achieving these in
practice depends on the processing steps that follow exposure and development.
In the process originally developed, a special kind of photolithography using
x-rays (x-ray lithography) is used to produce patterns in very thick layers of
photoresist — usually PMMA-based resists. The x-rays from a synchrotron source
are shone through a special mask onto a thick photoresist layer that covers a
conductive substrate (Figure 3.1a). This resist is then developed (Figure 3.1b). The
pattern formed is then electroplated with metal (Figure 3.1c). Nickel is commonly
used because nickel plating is a well-developed process, and reagents and equipment
are commercially available. The metal structures produced could be the ﬁnal prod-
uct; however, it is common to produce a metal mold (Figure 3.1d). This mold can
then be ﬁlled with a suitable material, such as plastic (Figure 3.1e), to produce the
ﬁnished product in that material (Figure 3.1f). This process is repeated to spread
the high initial cost of masks and x-ray exposure over as many units as possible.
A plastic structure can even be electroplated to form a metal structure.
As the synchrotron source makes LIGA expensive, alternatives are being
developed. These include high-voltage electron beam lithography, which can be
used to produce structures on the order of 100 µm high and excimer lasers capable
of producing structures up to several hundred microns high.

Nonsilicon Processes
75
Electroplating is not limited to use with the LIGA process but may be
combined with other processes and more conventional photolithography to pro-
duce microstructures. One aspect of the process that is very much apparent on
the microscale is its dependence on current density. The best results are obtained
if current density is constant over the entire structure, but geometrical consider-
ations mean that this is difﬁcult to achieve. The problem is often addressed by
use of pulse electroplating (rather than constant current) and overplating. Some
LIGA processes involve overplating followed by mechanical milling to provide
a ﬂat surface. Because this places mechanical stress on the structure, design rules
have to be employed to ensure that various parts of the structure will be sufﬁ-
ciently supported during milling.
3.4
PHOTOCHEMICAL MACHINING
Photochemical machining (PCM) is the equivalent of silicon photolithography
and wet etching applied to metal foils. A wide variety of metal ﬁlms can be
machined: steel, copper, molybdenum, etc., and these can be from tens of microns
to a few millimeters thick. The process is inherently isotropic and usually carried
out from both sides of the substrate (especially for thicker foils) in a spray-etching
system. That is, the etching solution is sprayed onto the substrate rather than
being immersed in a bath. The process is usually capable of feature sizes down
to 100 µm or 200 µm, although it may be pushed further.
PCM is commonly used in the mass production of the lead frames that are
used in IC packaging to provide electrical connections through the package to
the circuit board. If used within its normal commercial speciﬁcations and toler-
ances, this can be a very economical process compared to silicon micromachining.
By combining it with electroplating, it is possible to produce a variety of different
structures in metal, including closed channels.
3.5
LASER MACHINING
Compared to light from a conventional incandescent bulb, laser light is special:
it is monochromatic (i.e., light of only one wavelength), coherent in time and
space, and has a very low angle of divergence (i.e., it is collimated). The ﬁrst
two properties make it possible to focus the entire power contained in a laser
beam onto a very small diameter spot — this results in a very high power density.
In terms of micromachining, this means that structures with vertical sidewalls
can be created in resist or very high aspect ratios can be created.
There are several different types of laser, but for micromachining purposes, only
three common types will be considered. The ﬁrst two are infrared (IR) lasers,
producing IR light, and the third is the excimer laser, which produces ultraviolet
(UV) light. IR lasers are commonly used in industry and are available in laser jobbing
shops (companies that provide laser machining facilities on a sub-contract basis).
UV lasers have developed to become more speciﬁcally microengineering orientated;
one application is to produce the very-low-wavelength UV light used in DUV
photolithography.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
3.5.1 IR LASERS
There are two common IR industrial lasers — the carbon dioxide (CO2) lasers
and neodymium YAG (Nd:YAG) lasers. Table 3.1 summarizes some of their
properties (note that the average power is given for Nd:YAG lasers; industrial
Nd:YAG lasers are typically operated in a pulsed mode with much higher peak
power outputs).
The CO2 laser is the most commonly available of the two, but for microma-
chining purposes, the Nd:YAG laser is most interesting. IR lasers affect materials
by localized heating. The diameter of the spot to which a laser beam can be
focused is related to the wavelength of the light, so in theory, Nd:YAG lasers can
be focused to much smaller diameters than CO2 lasers. In practice, IR lasers are
focused to spot diameters that range from 0.03 mm to 0.3 mm.
IR lasers can be used in any of three basic applications: drilling and cutting,
welding, or heat treatment (localized hardening or annealing). Note that the
material being machined should not be too transparent or reﬂective for the wave-
length of light employed. Furthermore, note that when performing a process such
as cutting or welding, the material adjacent to the cut or weld will also be affected
by the heat involved in the process.
The Nd:YAG laser can produce holes of narrower diameter (down to 50-µm
diameter and up to 50-mm deep) and also narrower cut (kerf) widths (down to
30 µm — cutting essentially proceeds by drilling a series of holes) than CO2
lasers, which are typically operated with beam diameters of 100 to 300 µm. CO2
lasers, however, are much more efﬁcient when it comes to cutting or welding;
the Nd:YAG essentially produces very-small-diameter spot welds. IR lasers will
typically cut up to 10 mm in mild steel, less in aluminum and stainless steel, and
nonmetallic materials up to 20 mm thick.
In order to use a laser to machine a substrate, it is necessary to register the
workpiece with a reference point so that relative movement between beam and
workpiece ensures that machining occurs in the appropriate location. This is
commonly performed using a computer numerically controlled (CNC) system
(i.e., a robotic system). These are capable of considerable accuracy, and systems
developed for laser micromachining are capable of resolutions down to 2 µm over
an area of 200 × 200 mm.

3.5.2 EXCIMER LASER MICROMACHINING
Excimer lasers produce relatively wide beams of UV laser light. One interesting
application of these lasers is their use in micromachining organic materials
(plastics, polymers, etc.). This is because the excimer laser does not remove
material by burning or vaporizing, unlike IR lasers, so the material adjacent to
the area machined is not melted or distorted by heating effects. The process by
which material is removed (ablated) is generally thought to be because of
interaction between the laser light and chemical bonds within the material;
individual molecules are broken up (heating involves exciting the molecules as
a whole, thus they change state from solid to gas).
When machining organic materials, the laser is operated in the pulsed mode,
removing material with each pulse. The amount of material removed is dependent
on the material itself, the length of the pulse, and the intensity (ﬂuence) of the
laser light. Below a certain threshold ﬂuence, depending on the material, the laser
light has no effect. As the ﬂuence is increased above the threshold, the depth of
material removed per pulse is also increased. It is possible to accurately control
the depth of the cut by counting the number of pulses. Considerably deep cuts
(hundreds of microns) can be made using the excimer laser.
The shape of the structures produced is controlled by using chrome on quartz
masks, such as the masks produced for photolithography. In the simplest system
the mask is placed in contact with the material being machined, and the laser
light is shone through it (Figure 3.2a). A more sophisticated and versatile method
involves projecting the image of the mask onto the material (Figure 3.2b). Material
is selectively removed where the laser light strikes it.
Structures with vertical sides can be created. By adjusting the optics, it is
possible to produce structures with tapered sidewalls (Figure 3.3). 
FIGURE 3.2 Schematic illustration of contact printing with (a) an excimer laser, and (b)
projection system — the substrate being machined is mounted on a computer numerically
controlled (CNC) chuck, which moves it relative to the mask plate; this enables structures
such as those in Figure 3.4 to be created with only one mask.

Excimer lasers have a number of applications beyond those mentioned here.
One area of application is in machining the cornea of the eye to change its
optical properties, thus correcting for short sight. The versatility of the excimer
laser is illustrated in Figure 3.4. Notice that interesting curved and stepped
FIGURE 3.3 Different sidewall proﬁles can be created by adjusting excimer laser optics.

structures can be created by using the CNC platform to move or drag the
workpiece beneath the mask during exposure or after a set number of pulses.
Additionally, because reduction optics are commonly employed to project the
image of the mask onto the substrate, grayscale masks can be used (see Sub-
section 1.2.1, Figure 1.3) to expose different parts of the workpiece to different
intensities of laser light (the depth ablated per pulse being proportional to the
intensity).
3.6 POLYMER MICROFORMING
Polymers (plastics), in the macroworld, have the distinction of being incredibly
inexpensive to mass produce and very versatile. Many people would like to repro-
duce this success with plastic microstructures, but techniques for polymer micro-
forming lagged somewhat behind silicon and metal micromachining. The most

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
widespread form is photolithographic processing in the form of photoresists, poly-
imides, and photoformable epoxies (SU-8; the latter also being a class of photore-
sist). At the time of writing, these were closely followed by PDMS casting, but hot
embossing appears to be making its mark as a mass production technique. This
section also addresses stereolithography and microcontact printing. The latter is a
lithographic technique that is not restricted to polymers but can also pattern bio-
molecules, for instance. However it usually requires a polymer (PDMS) original.
3.6.1 POLYIMIDES
Polyimides are UV photoformable polymers that are common in the electronics
industry. These have several different trade names and different properties.
Fabrication of polyimide structures is normally performed on a polished silicon
wafer to provide a convenient ﬂat rigid substrate to which the material can be
applied and which holds it ﬂat during subsequent machining steps. Polyimides are
usually spun on and patterned using conventional UV lithography techniques,
usually to several microns thickness. Metal ﬁlms can also be deposited, patterned,
and sandwiched between layers to provide a variety of different electrode or inter-
connection structures. Polyimide structures are often used as part of the packaging
of silicon microsystems — they are ﬂexible and more robust than individually
bonded wires. The silicon die must be bonded to the ribbon cable either by con-
ventional wire-bonding processes or ﬂip-chip techniques (see Chapter 9). Unfortu-
nately many polyimides are not very resistant to ingress of water.
3.6.2 PHOTOFORMABLE EPOXIES (SU-8)
SU-8 (from Microchem Corp., U.S.) is a photoformable epoxy (negative photo-
resist) that has gained a considerable following among the MEMS community.
It is easy to see why — it is available in several different formulations and can
be applied in ﬁlms of 1 µm to 200 µm thickness in a single spin process, can be
exposed using standard UV exposure equipment, and produces high-aspect-ratio
structures (10:1 or better) with relatively straight sidewalls. It is also highly
resilient to chemical attack. As a result, microstructures can be produced in
SU-8 with a relatively low initial capital investment.
Owing to its popularity, there are several data sheets and application notes
available directly from manufacturers and distributors and other data available
on the Internet. Once the processes required to apply, expose, and develop SU-8
have been mastered, the main problem encountered appears to be its removal. As
an epoxy, it is exceedingly stubborn to remove and, at the time of writing, it
seems most appropriate to advise the users that if they need to remove the hard-
baked (cured) SU-8, they are probably not going to be able to do it very well.
Nonetheless, there are three possible options that have been suggested: plasma
ashing, laser ablation, and use of release layer.
A release layer is particularly useful if the SU-8 is to be used with electro-
plating to create metal microstructures (as in the LIGA process). The release
layer is basically a thin coat of photoresist that is applied beneath the SU-8 ﬁlm.

Nonsilicon Processes
81
When the SU-8 is to be removed, the release layer is simply stripped away, taking
the SU-8 with it (see Figure 3.5).
One additional caveat: although the cured SU-8 may be particularly stubborn,
this does not mean that it can sustain prolonged attack in KOH or EDP; it may
suffer adhesion problems.
3.6.3 PARYLENE AND PTFE
Two other polymers that can often be found in MEMS laboratories are parylene
and polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE). Parylene is usually deposited by CVD. It is
a particularly stubborn material and difﬁcult to pattern. It is also difﬁcult to
achieve a good conformal coating without pinholes or defects.
PTFE is normally available in spin-on form. Again, it is difﬁcult to pattern
and usually only used if absolutely necessary (such as encapsulating devices for
implantation in the body). It is very difﬁcult to get anything to adhere to PTFE,
and it usually requires some sort of surface treatment if additional ﬁlms are to
be deposited and patterned on it. The most common of these is treatment with
oxygen plasma to roughen and chemically activate the surface to some degree.
3.6.4 DRY FILM RESISTS
Developed for printed circuit board (PCB) processing, dry ﬁlm resists are not
commonly used for micromachining. They can, however, be used to create various
microstructures.
The resists are normally available as ﬁlms of different thicknesses ranging
from 50 to 100 µm. They are laminated onto the substrate (or a proceeding
patterned and developed resist layer) by a roller laminator at an elevated temperature.
The material can then be patterned and developed to create various microstructures,
FIGURE 3.5 LIGA using SU-8: (a) a substrate (coated with a nickel seed layer for
electroplating) is coated ﬁrst with a thin layer of photoresist and then SU-8, (b) the SU-8
and resist are patterned, (c) electroplating is used to form a nickel structure, (d) the

although there are limitations — aspect ratios and the angle of channel walls are
somewhat limited, as is the resolution achievable. By applying the resist to
conventional PCB substrate material (FR4), it is possible to make use of the
expertise and relatively low costs available for PCB production. Figure 3.6 illus-
trates construction of a simple chamber using dry ﬁlm resist. Closed channels
for microﬂuidic applications can also be produced in this manner.
3.6.5 EMBOSSING
One of the most promising methods for mass production of microstructures is the
hot-embossing process. In theory, the process is relatively simple. A mold insert is
created by one of a number of micromachining processes, usually bulk silicon
micromachining or nickel electroplating in a LIGA-related process. The mold and
target material are heated until the chosen polymer becomes plastic, and the mold
is then pressed into the plastic so that it takes up the impression of the structure.
The mold is removed and the plastic sets in the desired shape (Figure 3.7). 
In practice, the process is not quite so simple. The mold insert will probably
have a different coefﬁcient of thermal expansion than the polymer, so in the best of
circumstances the ﬁnal dimensions of the plastic structure will not be the same as
those of the mold. Furthermore, the process has to be controlled to ensure a clean
release, and parameters will have to be adjusted for each different material to be used.
Fortunately, however, there are two commercially available processes. The
ﬁrst (Figure 3.8) is based on macroscale mass production techniques and can be
run continuously. The insert has to be ﬂexible enough to be ﬁtted around a roller,
FIGURE 3.6 Creating a chamber using dry ﬁlm resist: (a) the resist is applied to the
substrate using a roller, (b) it is exposed through a mask to UV light, (c) the ﬁrst layer is

and this is impressed upon a continuously moving web. Although very well suited
to mass production, this does introduce some additional problems for the designer:
the ﬁnal structures are distorted because the original is ﬁtted onto a roller, and
they tend to be stretched slightly in the direction of travel of the web.
An alternative approach that has proven to be popular in smaller laboratories
is shown in Figure 3.7, in which the embossing tool is repeatedly pressed into a
succession of polymer blanks. Figure 3.9 shows a typical hot-embossing machine,
and Figure 3.10 shows a nickel-plated mold insert.
Different polymers can be microstructured in this way with very good results
(Figure 3.11). These include PMMA (Figure 3.11a), polycarbonate, polypropy-
lene, and others (Figure 3.11b). 
3.6.6 PDMS CASTING
Another material that has become popular for constructing microﬂuidic channels
for various applications is cast polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). This is a silicone
elastomer, and is ﬂexible and deformable, making it an interesting material for
the construction of microstructures.

PDMS can be cast or spun over a master structure created in a silicon wafer
(or other material, including SU-8) (Figure 3.12). One of the key problems to be
overcome in this case is to effectively release the cast PDMS from the master.
Effenhauser and colleagues [1] silanized the silicon with a dimethyloctadecyl-
chlorosilane solution, but others have tried alternative approaches. The next
problem is that of ensuring good adhesion between the PDMS and the silicon,
PDMS, or glass substrate that has been used to close the channel system. As with
all micromachining processes, both clean ﬂat surfaces and ensuring that the
structure has not been exposed to the environment for a long period after casing,
appear to help. Effenhauser and colleagues found that they could place the PDMS
down and peel it off again should the channels become clogged. After cleaning
the PDMS they could replace it and continue to use the device.
Others are seeking more permanent bonds for their devices or attempting to make
more complicated three-dimensional structures. Various approaches have been tried
with various degrees of success. These include treating both surfaces with PDMS
prior to bonding and use of HDMS primer. Ensuring that the substrate is very dry
(drive off water on a hot plate) also seems to be a key to achieving a good bond.

3.6.7 MICROCONTACT PRINTING
This is an interesting approach that makes use of PDMS structures to create quite
complex structures, usually in metal. A variety of related techniques have been
developed by Whitesides’ group [2,3]. The basic approach involves the use of
PDMS masters to print long-chain molecules onto an appropriate substrate.
This has been used to print biomolecules onto various substrates, but the approach
favored by Whitesides’ group involves chemistry related to self-assembled mono-
layers; long-chain molecules that spontaneously self-organize when printed onto
the appropriate substrate — in particular, alkanethiols on silver and gold sub-
strates (again, this chemistry has also be used in the creation of biosensors).
The process is shown in outline in Figure 3.13. One of the advantages of this
approach is that it is not limited to ﬂat substrates; by applying it imaginatively
to capillaries, Jackman and colleagues [2] have produced a variety of interesting
structures.
3.6.8 MICROSTEREOLITHOGRAPHY
Stereolithography is a well-developed process that is employed to produce three-
dimensional prototype structures for macroscale engineering. The overall process
is illustrated in Figure 3.14. 
A stage is immersed just under the surface in a bath of UV-curable polymer.
UV light is then focused onto the surface of the liquid, causing the polymer to
solidify where the illumination is most intense. One layer of the structure is
formed by scanning the spot over the surface of the polymer, turning the beam
on and off as required. The stage is then lowered deeper into the liquid and

another layer is built up. Eventually, a complete and complex three-dimensional
structure is produced. The main limit on the structure being produced is that it
has to be supported by the stage (this prevents the construction of, for instance,
caged balls without incorporating some sort of sacriﬁcial layer or structure into
the design).
Conventional stereolithography cannot be used to fabricate microstructures
as it stands, mainly owing to surface tension and viscosity of the polymer deform-
ing the structures and limiting the resolution of the process. Several groups are
working on optimizing conventional stereolithographic processes for MEMS
applications.
Ikuta et al. [4], however, have presented an alternative to conventional stere-
olithography that makes use of features (the viscosity of the ﬂuid) that may
otherwise be a problem on a microscale. Instead of focusing the UV light on the
surface of the liquid, it is focused into the volume of the ﬂuid and scanned in
three dimensions (Figure 3.15). Because of the high viscosity of the ﬂuid, the
small parts, and the speed with which microstructures can be created, the solid-
iﬁed polymer remains ﬂoating within the volume of the ﬂuid as the structure is
constructed. This enables the construction of various unusual microstructures
such as freely rotating cog wheels that would otherwise have to be anchored to
the platform if a more conventional approach were used. The structures created
FIGURE 3.14 In a typical stereolithography process, a movable stage is immersed in a UV
curable polymer. UV light is focused on the surface of the bath and scanned across it. The
light is turned on and off to cure the polymer. Once a layer has been formed, the stage is
moved down and the process is repeated. A three-dimensional structure is built layer by layer.

by the “Super IH” process appear a little more organic and less precise than those
created by more conventional processes, but this can probably be improved upon.
3.7
ELECTRICAL DISCHARGE MACHINING
Electrical discharge milling (EDM), also commonly known as “spark erosion,” is
another precision macroscale machining process, capable of working to micrometer
tolerances, that is being used or adapted for micromachining of metals.
EDM can only be used with conducting materials and is usually employed
in the precision machining of very hard metal alloys. As one may anticipate, the
process involves creating a series of sparks between the workpiece (substrate)
and an electrode (mandrel), which is maintained at a positive voltage with respect
to the workpiece. Each spark takes with it some small quantity of the material
being machined. A dielectric liquid is employed to control the spark discharge
process and cool the workpiece.
EDM is normally deployed in one of three modes (Figure 3.16): hole boring,
shaped working electrode, and wire EDM. The ﬁrst two rely on the fact that EDM
is a noncontact process (so no mechanical forces are applied to the working
electrode) in order to use a soft and easily shaped material to machine a much
harder material. EDM hole boring is capable of creating holes with micrometer
dimensions. Note, however, that the working electrode will degrade with use and
may even have to be reshaped (by reversing the EDM) or replaced during the
process. For this reason, wire EDM was developed (Figure 3.16c). Here, the
working electrode is a wire that is continually drawn past the workpiece. Thus,
there is always a new part of the electrode available for machining.
Micro-EDM systems have been developed for microengineering applications.
These typically employ three-axis positioning systems with micrometer XY accu-
racy and a smaller working electrode. This, by itself, poses a problem because

the smaller electrode degrades very rapidly during machining. For this reason,
different machining procedures and electrode shapes are under development to
extend the electrode life.
3.8
PHOTOSTRUCTURABLE GLASSES
Micromachined glass is a popular alternative to silicon in many applications,
especially biological, where glass is relatively inert and transparent, allow-
ing biological processes to be viewed directly under an optical microscope.
The normal process for patterning glass is to apply a photoresist, expose, and
pattern it using either BHF or RIE, the latter being used where anisotropic
etching is required. To be able to pattern and anisotropically etch glass plates
without the use of a photoresist or RIE system would considerably simplify
the process of producing glass components and result in cheaper components.
To this end, various photosensitive glasses have been developed. These are
generally based on silver compounds introduced into the glass. UV exposure
results in free silver atoms being released in the exposed areas. The glass is
then heat treated so that it crystallizes around the free atoms. The result is that
the exposed glass etches at up to 20 times faster than unexposed glass in 10:1
HF. The process is outlined in Figure 3.17. Note that the depth of the structure
produced in the glass will be dependent on the etching time and etching rate
of the exposed glass, and the sidewall quality will depend both on the quality
of the illumination (divergence, for instance) and the selectivity ratio of exposed
to unexposed areas.
There are two problems that presently limit the wider uptake of this process.
The ﬁrst is that the etch rate and ﬁnal results depend strongly on process param-
eters, and it can take some time to set up a reliable system. The second is that
heat treatment of the glass may take several hours. Although it only needs to be
held at an elevated temperature of between 500°C and 600°C for 1 to 2 h to effect
crystallization, considerable time may be required to ramp up and down to these
temperatures to ensure goodresults.

Nonetheless, the process can achieve quite remarkable results given the rel-
atively simple equipment requirements. Figure 3.18 shows the cross section of a
high-aspect-ratio channel etched in photostructurable glass.
3.9 PRECISION ENGINEERING
Various techniques developed under the banner of precision engineering have
either been adapted directly as microengineering processes (CMP and EDM, for
example, or wafer-dicing techniques from Chapter 2) or fall into the categories
of microengineering and nanotechnology by dint of the results that they are
capable of achieving. Many of the tools involved in precision engineering have
been discussed elsewhere; they include:
• 
Solid cutting or abrasive tools (e.g., diamond saw blades used in wafer
dicing Chapter 2, section 2.8.1)
• Free abrasives (in ﬁxed abrasive processes; e.g., CMP Chapter 3,
section 3.2)
• Scanning tip tools (e.g., STM and AFM Chapter 10, section 10.3)

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
• 
Energy beam tools (e.g., lasers and ion beam milling Chapter 3,
section 3.5 and Chapter 10, section 10.4.3, respectively)
• Measuring probes
One of the more widely used techniques that is capable of ultraprecision
machining of a variety of materials is single-point diamond turning. These sys-
tems are commercially available and are often used in the optics industry. They
are capable of machining glasses and ceramic in the ductile regime, so surfaces
will be free from damage due to brittle fracture of the material. Consequentially,
the surface ﬁnish is of very high quality (smooth), and the ﬁnished structure may
be usable without any subsequent grinding or polishing.
CNC (computer numerically controlled) machines for single-point diamond turning
possess a number of speciﬁc features to enable them to achieve the required precision.
They will almost certainly be operated in a very-tight-temperature-controlled
environment (to better than ±0.25°C), and the position of the tool will be con-
trolled close to nanometer accuracy through use of feedback control systems;
often laser interferometry or holography will be employed. Some of the capabil-
ities of ultraprecision turning centers, available both industrially and in research
environments, are given in Table 3.2.
Exactly what can be achieved depends on the tool, and Table 3.2 suggests
what could be expected. A typical commercial machine, for instance, may have
a programming resolution of 10 nm over 300-mm travel and achieve a straightness
of 300 nm over the full travel. The surface ﬁnish is very dependent on the
conditions and the material being machined; the 7 Å rms ﬁgure would be under
ideal conditions, whereas tens or several tens of angstroms would be more usual.
Materials can include nonferrous metals, ceramics, polymers, and crystals.

These have been given here as angstroms rms. One Angstrom (1 Å) is 1 × 1010 m,
or 0.1 nm. Here, rms stands for “root, mean, square,” and this describes how the
number was obtained. A rough surface will feature a number of peaks and troughs
(Figure 3.19) of random heights and depths. The distance between the highest peak
and deepest trough is not necessarily a good measure of the roughness, as they may
appear only once on the entire surface. A better measure would be to ﬁnd some
sort of representative average. This can be performed by measuring an area of the

surface (Figure 3.19 shows a single line; normally the surface would be scanned
in the x and y directions) and ﬁnding the line about which the average displacement
(i.e., the average of all peaks and troughs) is 0; this is where the surface would be
if it was perfectly ﬂat. The roughness is then calculated as the deviation from this
imaginary perfect surface. At all measured points, the deviation is ﬁrst squared (i.e.,
multiplied by itself; hence, negative deviations become positive), the average (mean)
of these squares is found, and then the square root of this number is taken. This
gives a reasonable estimate of the surface roughness, but note that the actual
deviation from the imaginary ideal surface will normally have a greater amplitude.
Surface roughness can be readily measured using scanning probe microscopes
(Chapter 10), particularly the AFM, and many AFMs are supplied with software
that allows the surface roughness to be readily measured.
It is also necessary to be aware that surface roughness will be different when
measured on different scales. A 100-µm-deep hemispherical pit may be atomically
smooth when measured with an AFM, but a surface covered in such pits would
appear to be quite rough to touch. Another analogy would be a road that appears
very smooth to drive over, but very rough when touched by the hand.
3.10 OTHER PROCESSES
The purpose of this chapter has been to provide a brief survey of alternative
(nonsilicon) micromachining processes, and not all of these have been presented.
It should be borne in mind that alternatives are available and that a silicon-based
process is not necessarily the best solution. The glass ﬁlters shown in Figure 3.20
were produced by drilling glass blanks and then drawing them out. A number of
other processes are commonly referred to in discussion of microengineering
problems. These include:
• Ultrasound — used for drilling (even welding) as well as to assist in
cleaning and etching.
• Sand blasting.
• Electroless plating — as with electroplating, a thin ﬁlm of metal is
deposited on the surface of an object immersed in solution containing
metal ions. However, the process by which the metal ions are reduced
(brought of solution to be deposited) is chemical and not electrical, so

level of the surface; the rough surface deviates from this perfectly ﬂat surface in both
directions. Surface roughness can be calculated as the rms deviation from this.

(plastics, glasses, etc.).

4 Mask Design
4.1 INTRODUCTION
The process of photolithography has already been introduced in Chapter 1 of this
volume, and many of the micromachining techniques introduced in Chapter 2
and Chapter 3 make use of this process. The present chapter presents the process
by which such masks are designed. In this chapter, the following assumptions
have been made:
• Designs are fabricated by a laboratory or foundry that has developed
its own processes and can supply relevant process details (required
alignment marks and design rules).
• The micromachined devices have relatively large (micrometer) mini-
mum feature sizes.
Generally speaking, the design of masks for MEMS is a fairly straightforward
process. All that is required is some suitable CAD (computer aided design)
software and a platform on which to run it.
4.2 MINIMUM FEATURE SIZE
The concept of a minimum feature size is important in mask design (readers will
note that it has already been described in Chapter 1). The minimum feature size
is the width of the smallest line or gap that appears in the design. When the mask
is produced, information on the minimum feature size will be required to set up
the equipment. A small minimum feature size will mean that the mask creation
process takes a long time and becomes increasingly expensive; with very small
features (submicron) it may be necessary to perform additional processing of the
mask for optical correction purposes. This should not happen for most microma-
chining applications: one would expect to have minimum feature sizes in the
region of a few micrometers.
4.3 LAYOUT SOFTWARE
The basic CAD software required is a layout editor, which resembles a drawing
package with additional features to facilitate the creation and editing of IC
designs. Figure 4.1 shows screen shots of two different layout editors: Tanner’s
L-Edit Pro and Static Free Software’s Electric. Electric will be used for the
examples in this chapter.

Mask Design
97
The layout editor enables the placement of different polygons onto different
layers of the design. Each layer corresponds to a different mask that will be used
in the fabrication of the devices. The polygons will be translated into opaque (or
clear) areas on the mask plate.
As will become apparent, the design can be created hierarchically. Polygons
can be grouped together into structures or cells (Electric terms them facets),
which can then be placed adjacent to each other to create a larger or more
complex design. The other essential feature of a layout editor is the facility to
import and export designs in ﬁle formats that can be used in the mask-making
process.
Many software packages will offer additional features. It is also possible to
use some drawing packages (AutoCAD, for example) provided that the ﬁles
created can be translated into an appropriate format. Anyone familiar with a CAD
or a drawing package should have few problems using a layout editor.
4.3.1 FILE FORMATS
There are two ﬁle formats that are commonly accepted by most mask makers:
CIF (CalTech Intermediate Form) and Calma GDSII. Any layout editor worth
its salt should be able to import and export designs in both of these formats
(editors usually use their own format for storing designs that are being worked
on). There are relatively few differences between the two formats that are
apparent to the user. Documentation supplied with the software should describe
how conversions between the two formats are handled and point out any
potential problems. One thing to note is that GDSII does not draw true circles;
it uses multisided polygons. The number of sides used is normally set by
default in the software, but this setting should be accessible for the user to
change.
CIF is an ASCII (text) format, whereas GDSII is a binary format. This means
that it is possible to view CIF ﬁles with a text editor if desired. This can be useful
when dealing with foreign ﬁles that have no associated technology ﬁles (see
following text), as layer names can be extracted from the design ﬁle itself (oth-
erwise it is necessary to monitor the errors occurring when the ﬁle is imported
and act accordingly).

4.3.1.1
Technology Files
In addition to the design ﬁle, which stores details of the mask designs, layout
editors also require technology ﬁles. These essentially store the “preferences” for
the design, such as:
•
Layer names used in the design
•
Layer numbers used in the design (layers may well be named and
numbered)
•
GDSII stream numbers (to or from which layer names and numbers
are translated when writing or reading a GDSII ﬁle)
•
CIF layer names (as in the preceding point, but for CIF)
•
What layers are made available for drawing
•
How to color the different layers on screen
•
The units to be used
•
How to draw wires (essentially long rectangular polygons, but made
easy to draw as interconnections between other elements of the design)
Other things that may be included in the technology ﬁle are how to scale
certain drawing objects, design rules, and physical parameters to enable the
extraction of electrical properties from the ﬁnal design. For some fabrication
processes, vias (holes in an insulating layer that enable one conducting layer to
be connected to another below) may only be allowed to be of a ﬁxed size; to
connect larger areas or allow the passage of higher currents, several vias rather
than one large one may be used. In this case, the ability to specify how certain
objects scale can be useful and make the design process a little easier. Design
rules are discussed in greater detail in the following text. But allowed overlaps
and spacings between polygons must be set.
Parameter extraction is very useful in IC design as it allows the designer to
extract the electrical parameters (e.g., resistance and capacitance of interconnects)
of the design as laid out on the chip. The design can then be simulated, with these
parameters entered, to verify its operation. For MEMS, some specialized software
exists for modeling; however, there are generally so many unknowns that it is not
possible to extract physical parameters from a given layout to enable veriﬁcation.
The closest approximation is where structures with known properties are included
in the design — the remaining electrical parameters can then be extracted and
simulated along with appropriate models of these structures.
 
Technology Files and Imported Files
Note that when importing a CIF or GDSII ﬁle, it will be necessary to tell the
layout editor which technology ﬁle it should use. It will be necessary to create
one if a suitable one does not exist.

4.3.1.1.1
Units
The thing that may come as a novelty to users of conventional drawing packages is
the concept of user units and internal units (or design units). The user units of interest
for micromachining are micrometers (microns, µm). Other options may be mils
(1/1000 in., or 25.4 µm) and lambda (λ), which is used for scalable IC designs.
The user units are the units that the design will be created in, i.e., entering
25 into the software will cause a 25-µm-wide line to appear. The internal units
are the units used by the software for its calculations. It is normal to set 1000
internal units to every user unit. Internal units are generally invisible to the user,
but because the software normally has a ﬁxed memory (i.e., internal unit alloca-
tion), the overall size of the design will be affected by the number of internal
units or user units that one speciﬁes. In other words, if the software is set for
2000 internal units or user units, the total area that can be used to create the
design will be half of that using 1000 internal units or user units.
Lambda units are used for scalable IC design, and design rules may well be
set in terms of lambda units if the fabrication process is based or partially related
to an IC process. Lambda is half the minimum feature size, i.e., for a 4-µm
minimum feature size design, λ will be set to 2 µm. Figure 4.2 shows a dialog
FIGURE 4.2 Electric dialog box to set up units.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
box for setting up display (user) units and their relationship to lambda and the
internal units (half millimicrons, i.e., one internal unit will be 0.5 nm).
It is usually possible to create a design using either micrometers or lambda
units. The latter are generally used for circuitry and not for micromachined
devices or structures. When moving to a new IC fabrication process with a
smaller feature size, the value of lambda is scaled appropriately so that the
design need not be recreated from scratch. The software may offer an option
to indicate which parts of a design can be scaled and which cannot (e.g.,
bonding pads). In such a case, it may be possible to create scalable designs
that combine microstructures with circuitry, but the process is generally
difﬁcult to implement.
4.3.1.2
Further Caveats
One additional thing to be aware of is the use of hidden or reserved layer names
that the software may use for its own purposes. This will be software dependent
and will restrict the use of names within a design created using that package. For
instance, “background” may be a reserved name allowing one to vary the back-
ground of the drawing area.
4.3.2 GRAPHICS
One difference between a layout editor and a normal drawing software is the
scale over which the design is drawn. A layout will range from features as small
as 1 µm up to a design that covers an entire wafer (100 mm) — a difference of
100,000 times. The layout editor software should provide an option that will
prevent it from trying to draw very ﬁne detail when a large area of the design is
being viewed; this may be automatic in some packages. The normal approach is
to prevent the software from attempting to draw anything that takes up less than
a speciﬁed number of pixels on the screen, otherwise it will take the machine an
unreasonable length of time to draw complex designs.
The layout editor will do its best to make everything visible on the screen.
This can lead to problems when trying to determine size or the distance between
two items because one pixel may be much larger than one user unit, depending
on the scale at which the design is being viewed. There will normally be a ruler
or cursor system in the software package to allow distances to be measured.

Mask Design
101
In order to get an accurate measurement, the design should be viewed at an
appropriate scale — normally, the highest possible magniﬁcation.
4.3.3 GRID
A grid is a useful feature of any drawing package and more or less indispensable
for mask design. Layout editors generally feature grids that can be turned on or off
(i.e., displayed or hidden) with variable mesh dimensions. Points and drawing
elements will be locked to the intersections of the gridlines (i.e., snap to grid), and
it is often useful to set the minimum spacing on the grid to the minimum feature
size being employed. The usefulness of the grid cannot be overemphasized.
Polygons can also be edited by specifying the coordinates of their vertices
(corners), as illustrated in Figure 4.3. Very complex polygons can be created in
this manner, but a lot of preplanning is required. Because MEMS normally involve
fairly complex polygons, it is worth planning the coordinates that these will
require beforehand.
4.3.4 TEXT
Most packages allow text to be typed onto one layer of the design. This will not
normally appear on the mask itself when fabricated. Most layout editors do not
allow text to be entered in such a manner that it will appear on the mask
(sometimes it is supplied as an advanced option). When placing text on a mask

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
design (layer names, mask serial number, etc.), it is normally necessary to create
it as complex polygons.
4.3.5 OTHER FEATURES
Other things that may help when creating a design include: turning different
layers on or off to make them accessible or inaccessible for modiﬁcation and
options for selecting an item to be modiﬁed. These will obviously be software
speciﬁc.
4.3.6 MANHATTAN GEOMETRY
Manhattan geometry refers to a restricted form of layout in which designs may
only be composed of horizontal and vertical lines. Complex polygons may also
be restricted. This is usually a feature of older CAD packages and is somewhat
restrictive in MEMS designs. The way around this is to put simple rectangles up
against one another to create complex shapes: any two polygons on the same
layer that touch or overlap will appear as a single contiguous area on the mask.
Diagonal bars can be approximated by an array of overlapping squares or rect-
angles. Tools for placing arrays of design features (either simple polygons or
more complex structures) are a common component of layout editors. Figure 4.4
illustrates this.

DESIGN
If the concept of creating a design by depositing and machining successive layers
is comprehended, the process of designing the required masks should be straight-
forward. It only requires the necessary mental visualization to see how the two-
dimensional mask designs relate to the ﬁnal structure.
In order to explain the basic concepts of mask design, the device outlined in
Figure 4.5 will be used as an example. It is not intended to be a real device but
is a simple design that could represent a microbiosensor. There are a set of exposed

•
Measure distances and sizes, and make sure that the display is
zoomed in as much as possible.
•
Adjacent or overlapping polygons on the same layer will become a
single contiguous shape on the mask.
•
Most packages allow text to be placed on the design but it will not
appear on the mask (check the manual or a CIF ﬁle to see if this is
true for a particular package).

metal electrodes at the center of a 5 × 5 mm silicon die (chip). The large central
electrode represents a reference (ground or 0 V) electrode. The two long thin
electrodes to either side could be some form of active sensor, possibly function-
alized by electroplating with a conductive polymer combined with a bioactive
compound. The four electrodes at the top could be used for electrical impedance
measurements (two to apply a signal and two to sense it). A small drop of the
sample could be placed in the center of the chip and bonding pads at the edge
of the chip could connect it with appropriate circuitry.
The design consists of a silicon substrate and three layers: an insulating layer
(CVD or thermal oxide) deposited on the wafer but not patterned, a metal layer
(nominally M1) to form the electrodes’ bonding pads and conducting tracks
between them, and a top insulating layer of oxide (e.g., PECVD) that would be
patterned to open vias (holes) above the electrodes and bonding pads so that
electrical connections could be made to these; this layer would nominally be V1.
This is a three-mask process — one (A1) to cut alignment marks into the
silicon substrate, M1 to pattern the metal, and V1 to pattern the vias. The mask
set will be called EX1 and will employ a 4-µm minimum feature size (although
such a simple design could be created with a larger minimum feature size).*
A number of different structures or cells will be created and stitched together
to create a wafer-sized design.
4.4.1 THE FRAME AND ALIGNMENT MARKS
Each individual chip design will be drawn within a frame. This is usually supplied
by the foundry or laboratory that will manufacture the devices and will normally
include the following:
•
Scribe lane
•
Alignment marks
•
Test structures
•
Layer identiﬁcation marks
•
Mask set number
•
Other marks required by the fabrication facility 
If the design is being created for in-house fabrication, the absolute minimum
requirements are alignment marks and a scribe lane, which may be useful, if only
to assist in layout.
4.4.1.1
Scribe Lane
The scribe lane is an area around the chip that has to be kept free of circuitry
or components. This deﬁnes the grid along which the wafer will be cut into
* The example uses Electric and the mocmosold technology ﬁle (library) that it is supplied with; an
old double-metal CMOS process that was available through MOSIS [1]. The design will not be
suitable for fabrication through MOSIS, and the library itself is no longer supported by MOSIS. It
was chosen only because it has a relatively large value of lambda. For this example, the technology
is not important.

individual dies. Options for dicing up the wafer include the use of a dicing saw,
a diamond-tipped scribe (which scores a groove across the surface of the wafer
where it will be broken), and laser cutting (which burns a series of pits along the
scribe lane). All these methods of dicing have disadvantages when dealing with
wafers that incorporate micromechanical structures. The saw and scribe induce
mechanical vibration that can damage components, and the laser induces thermal
damage and can eject material over the surface of the dies. It may be worth
considering incorporating a chemical (e.g., KOH) dicing step for some devices.
In the example (Figure 4.6), a 200-µm-wide scribe lane is created on all three
layers in use. This is done by creating four 100-µm-wide rectangles on each layer
and placing them as illustrated. The outside dimensions of this are 5000 × 5000
µm, so the area available for the design has been reduced to 4800 × 4800 µm.
This structure has been named, curiously enough, scribelane.
4.4.1.2 Alignment Marks
In order to line up one layer with a previously fabricated layer when performing
photolithography, it is necessary to incorporate appropriate marks into the mask
design. The foundry producing the devices will probably have standard marks
that should be used. Furthermore, these may need to be placed in a speciﬁc
position on the design. Use the standard alignment marks if available. It is not
unknown for process technicians and engineers to attempt to align parts of the
design itself with the alignment marks appearing in the previous layer when
dealing with unfamiliar designs.
A simple alignment-mark scheme consisting of squares and a cross is shown
in Figure 4.7. When creating alignment marks it is important to be aware of
FIGURE 4.6 “scribelane.”
Copyright © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC

106
Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
whether the mask will be dark ﬁeld or light ﬁeld. If a dark ﬁeld-mask has to be
aligned with a preceding light-ﬁeld mask, then the alignment mark has to be
larger, so that the previous mark can be viewed through the mask.
This is illustrated with the example in Figure 4.8. The structure align
consists of a set of square alignment marks surrounded by a frame so that when

four squares on another layer.

that M1 is to be produced as a light ﬁeld mask, and V1 and A1 are dark ﬁelds.

performing the alignment it is clear which mark is being aligned with which (the
frame appears on all layers). 
Masks A1 and M1 (A1 deﬁnes the alignment marks, etc., that will be
etched into the silicon) are light ﬁeld (i.e., will be opaque where a closed or
opaque polygon appears in the design). Mask V1 is dark ﬁeld (i.e., will be
transparent where a closed or opaque polygon appears in the design). M1 will
be aligned to A1, and V1 will then be aligned to M1. The alignment marks
consist of a small M1 square on the left that will be aligned to the larger A1
square and a larger V1 square that will later be aligned to the smaller M1
square on the right. The squares are 20 µm and 16 µm on a side (large and
small, respectively). This may imply a ±2-µm alignment error, but it will be
inﬂuenced by various factors, such as over- or under-etching and the ability
of the person performing the alignment to accurately place one square inside
another. Although this range of error has been taken into account in the rest
of the design (note the V1–M1 overlap elsewhere), it should be possible to
achieve a much smaller error than this.
4.4.1.3
Test Structures
The foundry may wish to incorporate a variety of test structures within the design.
For CMOS processes, these may include electronic components (transistors, ring
counters, etc.) to verify conformation to process speciﬁcations. The example only
includes a set of bars as the test structure (Figure 4.9).  
FIGURE 4.9 Example test structures.
Copyright © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC

108
Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
A 4-µm minimum feature size has been chosen. The test structure consists
of a set of 4-µm bars, spaced 4 µm and 8 µm apart, on each layer. These will
enable monitoring of the process to check for such things as:
• Correct exposure
• Under- or over-etching
• Asymmetry between x and y axes (and, thus, the vertical and horizontal
bars)
4.4.1.4 Layer and Mask Set Identiﬁcation Marks
A number of different projects are normally in progress at any one time in a
fabrication facility (fabs). For this reason, it is useful to be able to pick up a wafer
and determine how far it has progressed and to which particular project it belongs.
Therefore, each layer should have the layer name written on it, as illustrated
in Figure 4.10a, and a name or number to identify the mask set, as shown in
Figure 4.10b. Note that these have been drawn onto each layer as polygons.
4.4.1.5 Putting It All Together
These structures now need to be combined into a single structure that can be used
as the basis of any chip design. To do this, a new structure, or a frame, is created
(Figure 4.11a). The structure’s scribelane, align, test, layernames,
and maskname are then placed appropriately (Figure  4.11b). The alignment marks

and test structures have been placed in each corner of the scribe lane structure,
and the layer and mask names have been placed at the center in the bottom. The
software displays these structures as named boxes.   
It is possible to view the full design by pushing down (or expanding) on the
hierarchy (or instances; each box containing a structure being termed an instance,
although the terminology is somewhat software dependent). This has been done
in Figure 4.11c and the window has been zoomed in to show the lower-left corner
of the design.
It is clear that a design hierarchy is being built up, as illustrated in Figure 4.12.
Note that if the mask name is changed in maskname, then the change will be
reﬂected in all instances of the frame.
4.4.1.6 Another Way to Place Alignment Marks
Notice that the more structures that need to be placed in the frame, the less room
there is available for the design. In the example being pursued in this section, it
is known that the alignment will be performed by a mask aligner that will view
alignment structures that exist along the centerline of the mask. So it is only
necessary to place alignment marks in this area.
To do this, a special frame will be created. This will have an alignment mark
at the center and a number of arrows to guide the eye to its position. It is only
necessary to create one arrow structure (Figure 4.13a). This is placed with the
correct orientation into alignmentframe and duplicated using the array place-
ment command. The resulting structure is shown in Figure 4.13b and Figure 4.13c.
4.4.2 THE DEVICE
The sensor design illustrated in Figure 4.5 is shown as a layout in Figure 4.14
(design). The frame structure has not been used, as the alignmentframe
structure, discussed in the previous section, will be used instead. The area of the
device has been deﬁned by the use of scribelane, and a set of bonding pads
have been placed near the edges of the design.

The bonding pads are 200 × 200 µm squares on M1, with 180 × 180 µm V1
squares centered over them. This means that the insulating layer over the top of the
device will overlap the metal of the bonding pads by 10 µm all the way around —
which could easily accommodate the ±2-µm alignment error suggested by the
design of the alignment marks (this will be discussed further in the following
section on design rules).
The position and size of the bonding pads depends on the facilities available.
Generally speaking, it is possible to bond to pads of 70 µm and upwards that are
placed around the edge of the design. Some foundries may offer bonding to less
accessible pads. There are other alternatives to thermal or ultrasonic wire bonding —
speciﬁcally, hand assemblies with conductive paints or epoxies or the use of a
probe station.
For hand assembly, the larger the pads and the greater the spacing between them,
the easier the work; 200-µm pads with 200-µm gaps is probably the minimum
reasonable size if hand assembling with conductive paint or epoxy. This requires
considerable time and patience and is usually restricted to the testing of samples.
A probe station consists of a number of micromanipulators equipped with
tungsten needle probes. A few of these can be positioned to contact suitably sized
pads anywhere within the design, and it is a fairly common piece of test equip-
ment. Pads for probes can be placed anywhere within the area of the layout and,
as such, can be useful for breaking out signals that may be important when testing
or debugging, but they are not required once the packaged device is in use.
The sensor area is shown in Figure 4.15 with a 4-µm grid superimposed over
it. The smallest openings in the V1 layer are 4 × 4 µm (the pair of small electrodes
at the center of the top row). The next largest are 8 × 8 µm, followed by the

narrow ones on the right-hand side, which are 8 × 80 µm, then the 16 × 80 µm
ones and, lastly, the 100-µm square reference electrode at the center. Notice that
only three different sized M1 structures have been used: 20 × 20 µm, 20 × 100
µm, and 120 × 120 µm. This gives only a 2-µm V1–M1 overlap for the larger
long electrodes. The tracks were drawn using the wire tool and are 6-µm wide.
It is normal for a designer to incorporate structures of several different
dimensions into a single design during the development process. It is unlikely
that the ﬁrst process run will produce the desired results, so the more alternative
designs that can be ﬁtted into the available area, the better. It would have been
wise for the designer in this example to have included another four-electrode
impedance sensor at the bottom of the design, as it is quite possible that the
4-µm vias will not be etched properly.
Any departures from process guidelines or design rules should be tested on
some area of the wafer, not just structures that are at the minimum feature size.
A process optimized for etching 4-µm vias, for instance, may not perform as well
when etching larger areas: the excess debris may be distributed over adjacent
areas of the design, the etch may proceed more rapidly over larger areas, etc.
Similarly, in research establishments in particular, processes may perform opti-
mally for devices near the center of the wafer, so it is worthwhile laying out the
wafer with an even distribution of the different designs.
Finally, the individual designs need to be laid out for fabrication. In this case,
a 4-in. (100-mm)-diameter wafer will be used. The structure wafer is created
and, to simplify the layout, an annulus (ring) of 100-mm outside diameter and
90-mm inside diameter is created on an unused layer of the design. This will be
deleted later or simply not translated to CIF/GDSII.
Design and Layout Hints
•
Fit as many designs as possible into the area available.
•
Include several different approaches — especially if design rules
are being broken.
•
Do not break design rules unless absolutely essential, and do not
expect a good result.
•
Distribute different designs evenly across the area of the wafer.
•
Include test structures where possible to check the patterning of
various ﬁlms at the dimensions of interest.
•
Leave ample overlap between features on different layers.
•
Do not make bonding or probe pads too small (70 µm on up; 100 µm
preferred).
•
Include marks to identify different parts of the design and
orientation.
•
Keep designs away from the edge of the wafer if a deep etch is to
be employed.

An alignmentframe structure is placed in the center of the design and
repeated across the axis using the array placement option. The process is repeated
to ﬁll in the rest of the working area with the design structure. Note that,
depending on the process, designs within about 5 mm of the edge of the wafer
will probably be damaged or only partially fabricated. If a deep etch (KOH or
deep RIE, for instance) is to be employed, then this could damage the edge of
the wafer, making it difﬁcult to handle and more likely to break. The ﬁnal layout
is shown in Figure 4.16.
4.5
DESIGN RULES
Design rules are a set of rules that must be followed at the masks’ design stage
to ensure that the outcome of each stage of the fabrication sequence will be as
expected. They have to be developed for each process and depend primarily on
the accuracy of alignment and upon the processes followed. Design rules normally
specify one of several things:
•
Minimum feature size.
•
Minimum overlap (or underlap) between two layers (i.e., if a via hole
is to be aligned over a metal pad, then the pad must be larger than the
via hole by a speciﬁed amount. If they are both the same size, then a
slight misalignment will result in only part of the pad being exposed
through the etched via hole.)
•
Minimum separation between features on the same layer to ensure that
they will appear as separate features on the device. (This is usually the
minimum feature size; but for processes with considerable lateral pro-
gression, it will be larger — a deep boron diffusion will progress
laterally under the mask approximately the same distance that it
progresses into the silicon wafer, for example.)
•
Minimum separation between features on different layers to ensure
that they do not overlap. (Notes on alignment sequence in the text that
follows explain why this may be different for different layers.)
•
Allowed dimensions of speciﬁc features. (When etching via holes in
an insulating layer, for example, all of them must be opened cleanly
in a single etch step. Because small holes tend to etch a little more
slowly than larger holes, all via holes may have to be the same size in
order to ensure even etching across the device; to make a via capable
of carrying more current, several holes are used instead of one large
hole. Other process properties may also come into play to restrict the
maximum allowable dimensions.)
These are the most common design rules, but the list is by no means exhaus-
tive. There can be any number of design rules relating to process-speciﬁc aspects.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
When using a surface micromachining process, for example, it is necessary to
ensure that the sacriﬁcial material is completely etched away during the release
stage. It would be reasonable, therefore, to suggest a rule that states the largest
area of structural material that can be placed. To create a larger structure, it would
be necessary to introduce holes within the structural material layer to enable the
sacriﬁcial material to be removed; these holes would need to have a minimum
dimension and a maximum spacing.
Figure 4.17 illustrates the design rules outlined above. Figure 4.18 shows
some design rules for the MOSIS (www.mosis.org) scalable CMOS process
(SCMOS). CMOS design rules are commonly given in lambda units, whereas
design rules for MEMS may well be in microns.
FIGURE 4.17 Design rule illustrations: (a) minimum feature size: line width or gap width,
(b) minimum overlap between two layers to ensure that a via (dark gray) opens up over
a metal pad (light gray), (c) minimum distance between two features on the same layer
to ensure that they are separate when fabricated; for two parts of the same feature (e.g.,
a U shape) this may differ; it may also be different for two electrically connected features,
(d) distance between features on two different layers to ensure that they will not overlap
when fabricated.
Design Rule Checking
Most CAD packages have a built-in design rule checker (DRC). This may be
something that is run upon completion of a design to check that it complies
with speciﬁed design rules, or it may work interactively and warn the user as
soon as a structure that violates the speciﬁed design rules is drawn. Microengi-
neering often requires unusual rules that cannot be checked using conventional
DRC software or it may involve breaking speciﬁc rules (e.g., when creating
structures using an electrical layer). Despite its limitations, DRC software is
invaluable and should be learned and understood along with the layout editor.
Rules that cannot be handled by the software should be checked by at least
two people.

minimum size. (c) Metal 2 design rules for the MOSIS SCMOS 2 metal process. Courtesy

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
Note: Do not break design rules unless you are absolutely sure you know
what you are doing. They are there for a purpose.
It is usually desirable to exceed the design rules as far as possible. If a 4-µm
overlap is speciﬁed, an 8-µm overlap would be preferable. Furthermore, it is
helpful, although not essential, to work in multiples of the minimum feature size.
4.5.1 DEVELOPING DESIGN RULES
The ﬁrst principle is to comply with the minimum feature size. No structures or
gaps should have dimensions below the minimum feature size. This will set the
absolute minimum width and separation rules (Figure 4.19a).
Process characteristics contribute to separation rules. Diffusion processes
proceed laterally under the mask as well as into the silicon. The minimum
separation between diffused impurities (P-well or N-well) is likely to be larger
(Figure 4.19b).
Taking the process characteristics into account, overlap requirements are set
principally by the accuracy of alignment during photolithography. If it is possible
to align one layer with another to ±1 µm, then an overlap of at least 2 µm would

be required (Figure 4.19c). A similar argument holds for spacing between features
on different layers (Figure 4.19d).
The next thing to be considered is the alignment sequence. Not all layers will
be directly aligned to the one below; indeed, one layer may have to be registered
with respect to features on two layers. An example of this is in cases in which a
single etching step is used to open contact holes to more than one layer — the
same etch mask may be used to cut vias from metal 1 to both poly1 and the n
diffusion region (source or drain) of a transistor.
Figure 4.20 illustrates two different alignment sequences and the resulting
errors. An initial set of alignment marks is etched into the substrate. In Figure
4.20a, M1 and V1 are both aligned to within ±1 µm with the mark etched into
the substrate. As a result, V1 could be misaligned with M1 by as much as
±2 µm. In Figure 4.20b, M1 is aligned to the mark etched in the substrate and
V1 is aligned to M1 — in both cases to within ±1 µm. Now, V1 is aligned to
M1 with an accuracy of ±1 µm but could be misaligned with the substrate by as
much as ±2 µm.

feature size, (b) separation between 3-µm-deep diffusions needs to be larger, because the

this example), (d) if the via is not to open over the metal, it must be spaced from it by at

4.6 GETTING THE MASKS PRODUCED
Assuming that the masks are to be produced by an independent supplier or
brokerage, it will be necessary to provide the design ﬁles, obviously, and also
additional information regarding the physical format of the mask.
4.6.1 MASK PLATE DETAILS
The speciﬁcation of the blanks to be used to create the set of masks will either
be relatively simple for most silicon-related micromachining processes, where
the demands are not great, or quite complex for odd requirements such as x-ray
lithography masks. Normally, it would be necessary to obtain the latter from a
specialist provider; for UV lithography, the masks will normally be chrome on
low-expansion glass or quartz.
Mask plates should, clearly, be larger than the wafer being processed: a
2-in. (50-mm)-diameter wafer would require 2.5-in. (63.5-mm) square blank, and
a 4-in. (100-mm)-diameter wafer would require a 5-in. (125-mm) square blank.
Table 4.1 lists some common plate dimensions.
The chrome may either be “bright chrome” or have a low-reﬂection coating
(LRC) applied. This can help to some extent with optical aberrations during the
lithography process. Quartz (fused silica) glass is the preferred material for
stability, but low-expansion glass is a cheaper substrate that can be used; usually,
MEMS dimensions are not so critical as to require quartz. In the last instance,
FIGURE 4.20 In (a) both M1 and V1 are aligned to a mark on the substrate, with an error
of ±1 µm. This means that Xvia will be the nominal distance on the mask design, X, ±1
µm. The same is true of Xmetal, which means that Xvia can be as much as X+1 µm and
Xmetal as little as X − 1 µm. The difference between the two structures on the ﬁnal device
will then be as great as 2 µm. This is addressed in (b), where M1 is aligned to A1 and V1
to M1. While Xmetal is still X±1 µm, and the alignment error between V1 and M1 is now
±1 µm, Xvia is now X ± 2 µm.

the foundry where the micromachining is being performed will usually have a
preferred format and supplier.
For x-ray lithography (for LIGA), more exotic mask materials are required.
These are often speciﬁc to a particular organization but are generally formed
using a gold ﬁlm (to absorb the x-rays) that has been patterned on a thin membrane
(e.g., an etched silicon/nitride membrane).
4.6.2 DESIGN FILE DETAILS
Normally, the mask manufacturer will be supplied with either a GDSII or CIF
design ﬁle. The name and language of the design ﬁle should be clearly identiﬁed.
Furthermore, for GDSII ﬁles in particular, it is necessary to identify the structure
at the top of the hierarchy. In the case of the example given in earlier sections
of the chapter (see Figure 4.16a), this would be wafer.
It is common practice to submit design ﬁles via the Internet, but tapes and
ﬂoppy disks have also been used in the past.
4.6.3 MASK SET DETAILS
The result of mask manufacture will be a set of mask plates, each corresponding
to a layer of the design ﬁle. Firstly, it is necessary to identify the layer name
(CIF) or number (GDSII) that will be produced on each plate. It is advisable to
ensure that the ﬁle submitted for design does not contain data for layers that are
not to be produced as masks.
It is at this point that each mask layer should be identiﬁed as either light ﬁeld
or dark ﬁeld; this could alternatively be identiﬁed as positive or negative resist.
The minimum feature size, i.e., the smallest line or gap width, needs to be
speciﬁed, and if it is necessary to specify line width control beyond that normally
achieved by the mask manufacturer selected for the requested feature size, then
this must also be noted for each layer that requires it. Line width control refers
to the tolerance to be applied to the physical dimensions across the entire design.
If the design is particularly sensitive to variation in physical dimensions, it may
be worth revisiting this before trying to take it into production.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
4.6.4 STEP AND REPEAT
If the design is of a single chip, to be repeated across the entire mask (see Figure
1.2 in Chapter 1), then details need to be supplied. Care should be taken to ensure
that the information given matches the desired pitch (spacing) of the chip designs
and that the entire design can ﬁt onto the blank selected.
4.6.5 PLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS
It is normal practice to place all designs symmetrically about the center of the
plate. However, it is possible to specify that the design be mirrored about the
vertical axis. There are several reasons why this may be required:
• 
If the design is double sided, then masks for the back side of the wafer
will need to be mirrored (with respect to the other layers).
• 
As seen in Chapter 1, the design is written onto the chromium side of
the plate, but when performing lithography this is the side that is in
contact with the substrate. This may result in the design appearing as
a mirror image following photolithography. Some mask manufactures
will normally mirror layers so that the ﬁnal design comes out as it
appears in the design ﬁle, whereas others do not do so. It is advisable
to check beforehand and to place features (e.g., text) in an obvious
place on the design so that the orientation can be veriﬁed. This will
not normally have functional implications but can mean that bonding
pads, etc., appear on the opposite side of the design to that expected.
Note that by specifying which layers are to be mirrored at this stage, rather
than using the layout software, it is possible to verify the alignment of features
in double-sided designs before going on to mask manufacture.
4.7 GENERATING GERBER FILES
Chapter 1 introduced the reader to some cheaper alternatives to chrome masks.
These options included the use of printed circuit board (PCB) artwork and the
use of laser-cut stencils. The common design ﬁle current in the PCB industry is
the Gerber ﬁle format. Modern PCB design software can readily cope with
multiple layers and can perform design rule checks similar to those performed
by layout software. There is no confusion between internal units, lambda units,
and user units. The design is created in either millimeters or mils (thousandths
of an inch). The only thing to be aware of is that when generating the ﬁnal Gerber
ﬁles, it is normally possible to set the precision of the dimensions — the number
of places before and after the decimal point; the software will automatically round
any dimensions to the speciﬁed precision. In the author’s experience, PCB layout
tools are slightly more difﬁcult to come to grips with than simple polygon pushers.
At the time of writing, there are a number of PCB design packages that are
available in one form or another for downloading from the Internet; see Table 4.2.

a. The output will be CIF or GDSII.
b. Each layer will be numbered (GDSII) or named (CIF).
c. Each individual layer of the design will be transferred to a single
mask plate.
2. The layout editor will make use of a technology ﬁle that outlines the
design (layer names, numbers, colors for rendering, etc.):
a. Units will be design units (used by the software), microns, or lambda
units (half the minimum feature size).
b. Plan the design beforehand.
c. Use the grid for help when drawing the design.
d. Text may not appear on the design layer unless drawn as a polygon
or track.
3. The design will be hierarchical.
4. The design will normally include a number of standard features
speciﬁed by the foundry:
a. Frame
b. Alignment marks
c. Scribe lane
d. Bonding pads
e. Test structures
5. Each layer of the design should include a mask set identiﬁer and layer
identiﬁer.
6. Always work to the design rules given by the foundry, and use the
layout editor’s DRC where possible to check:
a. Minimum feature size
b. Minimum overlap
c. Minimum separation
d. Exact dimensions where required
7. Masks are normally chrome on quartz or chrome on low-expansion glass:
a. The mask plate should be about 1 in. (2.5 mm) larger than the design.
8. When the mask set is produced, it is possible to individually specify
each layer:
a. As being light or dark ﬁeld
b. As being mirrored

Part II
Microsystems
II.1 INTRODUCTION
A microsystem can be considered to be a device or unit made up of a number of
microengineered components. A convenient model of a microsystem is that of a
control system (Figure II.1); many proposed microsystems take this form.
Microsensors detect changes in the parameter to be controlled; electronic control
logic then operates microactuators based on information from the sensors to bring
the parameter to be controlled within the desired limits.
An example of such a system would be the refreshing of a medium in a small
cell culture dish. Sensors could detect changes in pH, pO2, or pCO2, and a
micropump could deliver new culture medium from a reservoir as required. Not
all devices need follow this control-system scheme. For instance, an accelerom-
eter designed to inﬂate an air bag in the event of a car crash may not only
incorporate a micromachined acceleration sensor but also electronics to condition
the signal and detect a rapid deceleration, and microactuators that put a force on
the sensor, allowing the device to be tested before the driver moves off.
Microsystems may be constructed from component parts produced using
different technologies on different substrates, which are then assembled together,
i.e., a hybrid system. For example, a silicon chip would be used to implement
control circuitry, whereas the actuators it controlled could be micromolded in
plastic or electroplated metal (using the LIGA technique, perhaps). Alternatively,
all components of a system could be constructed on a single substrate using one
technology (a monolithic system). Hybrid systems have the advantage that the
most appropriate technology for each component can be selected to optimize
system performance. This will often lead to a shorter development time because
microfabrication techniques for each component may already exist, and compro-
mises will not have to be made to ensure that each component can be fabricated
without damaging components already existing on the substrate. Monolithic
devices will typically be more compact and more reliable than hybrid devices
(fewer interconnections that can go wrong, for example). Further, once the
fabrication process has been developed, they can be manufactured more cheaply
because less assembly is required. Various microsensors and microactuators are
discussed in Chapter 5 and Chapter 6.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
A signiﬁcant problem facing microengineers is that of assembling many
microscopic components. Potential solutions include self-assembling systems and
desktop factories staffed by microrobots. At some point many microsystems will
have to interact with macroscopic systems. Often it may be that only a critical
component of a system has to be microengineered and supported by a complex
system produced using more conventional engineering techniques. It is easy to
underestimate the problems involved in mounting and packaging microdevices
and integrating them with macroscopic supporting systems. Chapter 9 deals with
some issues regarding assembly and packaging of microsystems.
Although microsensors and microactuators are given a fairly general treat-
ment within this section, there are some microsystems and related technologies
that have become so complex as to require deeper treatment. Microelectronics is
one example, and this has been left to the vast body of existing literature on the
subject. Similarly, radio frequency (RF) MEMS have not been addressed here,
nor have millimeter wave technologies (MMIC). However, some effort has been
made in Chapter 7 and Chapter 8 to introduce micro total analysis systems and
integrated optics.
It should be recalled that many of the techniques required for other technol-
ogies have been addressed in Part I of this volume. In terms of RF MEMS, for
example, one technique is to fabricate coils suspended within the wafer, on an
oxide or nitride membrane.
Physical dimensions of devices are constantly reducing because of ongoing
development. Chapter 10 introduces some aspects of nanotechnology, which, on
some scales, overlaps with microtechnology, and in other areas represents the
next step.
II.1.1 MICROSYSTEM COMPONENTS
As can be seen from Figure II.1, a microsystem typically comprises components
from one or more of three classes: microsensors to detect changes in the system’s
environment, an intelligent component that makes decisions based on changes
detected by the sensors, and microactuators by which the system changes its
environment. Obviously, a system need not be a closed loop as illustrated in
Figure II.1. Even if it is, some elements may be implemented in macroscopic
technology; for instance, microsensors may be used as cheap disposable compo-
nents to control large actuators.

The intelligent component of the system would be implemented using micro-
electronic components or a computer. Although microelectronics itself is not
addressed, Part III gives a good introduction to techniques that may be employed
to interface sensors and actuators to a computer or microcontroller.
Some of the microsensors described in Chapter 5 are micromechanical
devices that have to be driven into resonance. This is an additional role for the
microactuators described in Chapter 6.

5 Microsensors
5.1 INTRODUCTION
A transducer is a device that converts one physical quantity into another. The
change in refractive index of some crystals under an applied magnetic ﬁeld is
one example of how this occurs (magnetooptic effect). Deformation of a piezo-
electric crystal under an applied electric ﬁeld is another. Sensors and actuators
are special types of transducers. In the present context, a sensor is a device that
converts one physical or chemical quantity to an electrical one for processing by
the microsystem. Similarly, an actuator is a device that converts an electrical
quantity into a physical or chemical one.
Many of the sensors described in this chapter have been developed within
the microelectronics industry and do not involve any special micromachining
techniques. However, some of these sensors can be enhanced by the use of
micromachining techniques (e.g., for thermal isolation).
5.2 THERMAL SENSORS
There are a number of different types of thermal (temperature) sensors. Two of
the most common types are thermocouples and thermoresistors (thermistors). 
5.2.1 THERMOCOUPLES
When two dissimilar metals (e.g., copper and iron) are brought together in a
circuit and the junctions are held at different temperatures, a small voltage is
generated and an electrical current ﬂows between them.
A working thermocouple is shown in Figure 5.1. It consists of a sensing
junction at temperature Ta and a reference junction at temperature Tb. The voltage
developed by the thermocouple is measured with a high-resistance voltmeter. The
open circuit voltage (i.e., as measured by an ideal voltmeter with inﬁnite input
impedance) is related to the temperature difference (Ta − Tb), and the difference
in the Seebeck coefﬁcients of the two materials (Pa − Pb) is
(5.1)
V will typically be on the order of millivolts or tens of millivolts for metal
thermocouples with temperature differences on the order of 200°C.
Semiconductor materials often exhibit a better thermoelectric effect than
metals. It is also possible to integrate many semiconductor thermocouples in

series to make a thermopile, which has a larger output voltage than a single
thermocouple on its own. However, the high thermal conductivity of silicon makes
it difﬁcult to maintain a large temperature gradient (Ta − Tb).
Therefore, one application of silicon micromachining is to thermally isolate
the sensing element from the bulk of the silicon wafer. This may be done by
fabricating the device on bridges or beams machined from silicon.
5.2.2 THERMORESISTORS
The electrical resistivity of metals varies with temperature. Above −200°C, the
resistivity varies almost linearly with temperature. In this approximately linear
region, the variation of resistivity (r) with temperature (T) can be adequately
described by a quadratic equation:
(5.2)
where R is the resistivity of the material at a reference temperature (0°C), and a
and b are constants speciﬁc to the metal being used. Platinum is often used as
its resistance variation is particularly linear with temperature (i.e., b is particularly
small).
As metal thermoresistors generally have relatively small resistances and their
rate of change of resistance with temperature (temperature coefﬁcient of resis-
tance, or TCR) is not particularly large, they require the use of a resistance bridge
network to detect the signal (Chapter 11, Section 11.4).
Semiconducting thermoresistors (or thermistors) can be formed from metal
oxides or silicon. These are generally not as accurate or stable as platinum
thermoresistors but are cheaper to manufacture and are potentially easier to
integrate with microelectronic circuitry on the same substrate. The TCR of a
thermistor is highly nonlinear and negative and quite dependent on the power
being dissipated by the device. The nominal resistance is typically expressed
relative to the resistivity at 25°C with no power being dissipated by the device,
and can range from 500 Ω to 10 MΩ.
Owing to the negative TCR, it is possible for the resistor to go into a self-
heating loop: current ﬂowing through the resistor heats it up, the resistivity drops,
more current ﬂows, it gets hotter, etc. However, a large TCR does make it possible

to couple thermistors directly to ampliﬁer circuits without the requirement for a
bridge conﬁguration. The nonlinearity would typically be dealt with by calibrating
the device.
Microengineering techniques can be used in a variety of ways to enhance
thermal sensors. As mentioned earlier, they can be used to thermally isolate the
sensing element from the rest of the device. Also, arrays of sensors can be
produced to give signals that are larger than what one sensor on its own would
produce. If the device is small and thermally isolated, then its response time (the
time the sensor takes to heat up or cool down in response to changes in the
temperature of the environment) can be quite fast. With silicon-based devices,
there is, of course, all the potential beneﬁts that could come if electronics were
integrated onto the chip (e.g., calibration done on-chip, self-testing).
5.2.3 THERMAL FLOW-RATE SENSORS
There are a number of ways by which the ﬂow rate of gases (and liquids, although
clogging of the sensor may be more of a problem) can be monitored by the use
of thermal sensors. One can measure the temperature of a ﬂuid as it enters and
then leaves the sensor having been passed over a heating resistor; the temperature
difference will be proportional to the mass ﬂow rate. Another possibility is to
maintain the sensor at a constant temperature (using heating resistors with thermal
sensors for feedback control) and measure the amount of power required to
maintain the temperature. Again, this will be proportional to the mass ﬂow rate
of material over the sensor. This type of sensor is typiﬁed by the use of a platinum
resistor both as the sensing and heating element.
Equation 5.2 gave the relationship between temperature and resistivity for a
metal-sensing element (for platinum, a is approximately 3.9 × 10−3 and b is
approximately 0.58 × 10−6, so the response is roughly linear). If a heating current,
I, is ﬂowing through the element, then this can be related to the mass ﬂow rate by
(5.3)
where p is a constant related to the heat loss under zero-ﬂow conditions, and q
is a constant dependent on the geometry of the system and the ﬂuid. Note that
these constants will also be dependent on the temperature difference between the
ﬂuid and the heating element. In the case of a MEMS sensor, the element will
be situated on a thermally isolating structure such as a bridge, otherwise heat
will be dissipated through the silicon (or another) substrate. In order to make a
measurement, the element can be incorporated into a Wheatstone bridge (see
Chapter 11, Section 11.4) as shown in Figure 5.2.
In Figure 5.2, a bridge with two sensing arms is shown. When the bridge is
in balance (Vdif = 0), one arm has a resistance of approximately 11000 Ω, whereas
the other has a resistance of approximately 278 Ω. This implies that the 100-Ω
platinum element (100 Ω referring to its nominal resistance at 0°C) has been
I

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
heated to approximately 100°C by the current ﬂowing through the bridge. The
heating is due to current ﬂowing through the platinum element. Because this side
of the bridge has a much lower resistance than the other, much more current will
ﬂow, resulting in more power being dissipated by the element (power dissipated
being proportional to the square of the current).
The use of two sensing elements means that ambient temperature is compen-
sated for to some extent, because the 1000-Ω element will not heat up. To obtain
a signal that is related to the mass ﬂow rate past the sensor, the current ﬂowing
through the 100-Ω element is measured and controlled to keep the bridge in
balance. The system can then be calibrated to give a mass ﬂow rate based on
Equation 5.3. (Alternatively, if the ﬂuid and thermal aspects of the system can
be reasonably well simulated, then the constants p and q can be estimated or even
calculated.)
5.3
RADIATION SENSORS
There are a variety of radiation sensors for different types of radiation, including
nuclear radiation as well as visible light, infrared, and ultraviolet. Only a few of
the most common ones will be considered here: the photodiode and phototran-
sistor, charge-coupled devices (CCDs), and pyroelectric sensors.
5.3.1 PHOTODIODES
The simplest photodiode is a reverse-biased pn (diode) junction. When no light
falls on the device, only a small amount of current ﬂows (the dark current). When
light falls on the device, additional carriers are generated, and more current ﬂows.
Photodiodes typically work in the visible light — near the infrared region of
the spectrum. They are high-impedance devices, and operate at relatively low
currents (typically 10 µA dark current, rising to 100 µA when illuminated).
They have fairly linear responses to increasing illumination, and they gener-
ally have very fast response times.

It is worth remembering that, although photodiodes are carefully designed to
have speciﬁc response characteristics, light falling on any pn junction can poten-
tially induce charge carriers. This will appear as unwanted noise in a signal, and
it is, therefore, desirable to ensure that sensitive electronics are packaged so as
to prevent light from falling on them.
5.3.2 PHOTOTRANSISTORS
The phototransistor has a much higher current output than a photodiode for
comparable illumination levels. However, it does not operate as fast as photo-
diodes (about 100 kHz being the top limit) and also has higher dark current.
The phototransistor is essentially a transistor with the base current supplied
by the illumination of the base–collector junction; it can be considered to be
similar to a photodiode supplying the base current to a transistor (Figure 5.3).
Normal transistor action ampliﬁes the small base current.
5.3.3 CHARGE-COUPLED DEVICES
CCDs can be built as large linear and two-dimensional arrays; the latter are often
used in small video cameras. They consist of a large number of electrodes (gates)
on a semiconductor substrate. A thin insulating layer is situated between the metal
gates and the semiconducting substrate.
The operation of a CCD is shown schematically in Figure 5.4. The substrate
has been doped so that the main current carriers are positive (i.e., “holes” — the
term originates from semiconductor physics). When a positive voltage is applied
to every third gate (V1), the majority carriers are repelled from the region beneath
(Figure 5.4a), leaving “wells.” When light falls on the device, additional carriers
are generated (as with photodiodes). The positive carriers are repelled from the
gate, but the negative charge carriers (electrons) are attracted to the gate and ﬁll
the wells (Figure 5.4b). After the carriers accumulate, the entire array may be
read out by shifting the carriers from one well to the next, the number of carriers
being proportional to the amount of light that fell on each well. The electrical
potential on the gates to one side of those already biased (V2) is increased; thus
the charge is now shared between wells under two gates (Figure 5.4c). Then the
ﬁrst potential (V1) is then switched off. The charge is transferred to the adjacent
well (Figure 5.4d), and so on.

5.3.4 PYROELECTRIC SENSORS
These devices operate on the pyroelectric effect in polarized crystals (e.g., zinc
oxide). These crystals have a built in electrical polarization level that changes
with the amount of incident thermal energy.
These are generally high-impedance devices and so are often buffered using
ﬁeld effect transistors. They can be made to automatically bring themselves to
the ambient temperature, so they only respond to rapid ﬂuctuations. One potential
problem is that crystals that exhibit the pyroelectric effect may also exhibit
piezoelectric effects (see the discussion on mechanical sensors in the following
text), thus pyroelectric sensors need to be designed to avoid strain on the crystal.

Zinc oxide for piezoelectric or pyroelectric applications is usually applied by
spinning on a solgel and then baking. This is discussed further in the section on
piezoelectric actuators in Chapter 6.
One common application of these devices is in motion detectors for intruder
alarms. A lens cuts the sensor’s ﬁeld of view into discrete sections. As someone
moves across the ﬁeld of view, thermal radiation from their body falls on the
sensor, resulting in discrete pulses as the person moves from one part of the ﬁeld
of view to the next. It is thus possible to build relatively cheap motion detectors
that can be tuned to respond to a particular rate of motion.
5.4
MAGNETIC SENSORS
There are many ways of sensing magnetic ﬁelds. Optical sensors can be based
on crystals that exhibit a magnetooptic effect or on specially doped optical ﬁbers.
Coils can be used, although microfabricated coils are generally two dimensional,
which are often not useful for many applications. The continuing development
of high-temperature superconductors is also broadening the possibilities for sen-
sors based on superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), which
are capable of detecting the magnetic ﬁelds in the heart or brain. There are also
a variety of other devices. Many measurements can be made, however, using Hall
effect sensors. These are very common and are outlined in the following text.
A Hall effect sensor is shown diagrammatically in Figure 5.5. The sensor
consists of a conducting material, usually a semiconductor, and a current is passed
between two contacts on opposite sides of the device. Two sensing contacts are
placed on two other sides of the device opposite each other and perpendicular to
the current ﬂow. A magnetic ﬁeld perpendicular to the plane of the contacts causes
a deviation in the current ﬂow across the device. This in turn is detected as a
potential difference between the two sensing contacts.
Hall effect sensors operate typically in the range 0.1 mT to 1 T (the Earth’s
magnetic ﬁeld is about 0.05 mT). Hall effect IC packages that typically give an
output of about 10 mV per mT are available.

CHEMICAL SENSORS AND BIOSENSORS
There is a wide variety of different chemical sensors, especially if one includes
biosensors as a subclass of chemical sensors, as is done here. A large proportion
of chemical sensors are based on metal-oxide-semiconductor ﬁeld effect transistor
(MOSFET) devices. For this reason, the ion-sensitive ﬁeld effect transistor
(ISFET) will be discussed in this section. ISFET devices have been around for
some time now (since about 1970), so there is quite a bit of literature on them.
The term biosensor refers to any sensor that uses an active biological (or
sometimes biologically derived) component in the transduction process. This may
be a sensory cell taken from a living organism and mounted on an electrode.
Alternatively, antibodies may be used, which will lock onto the material of interest
and hold it in an appropriate position for sensing. Another option is to use an
enzyme that catalyzes a reaction that can be detected by suitable means. As there
is considerable interest in monitoring blood glucose levels (to provide closed-
loop control of blood glucose by means of an artiﬁcial pancreas for diabetics),
blood glucose sensors have received much attention. One of these, based on the
glucose oxidase enzyme, will be outlined.
One thing to note is that a lot of research has gone into these sensors —
biosensors and blood glucose sensors in particular. Although progress has been
made, there are still a lot of problems to be solved. One big problem in this area
is that the sensor performance drifts or degrades over time, often in unpredictable
ways. So the device has to be calibrated regularly or just before use. Clearly, a
blood glucose sensor that only gives reliable readings over a period of 100 d
cannot be used in an implanted artiﬁcial pancreas. Thus, although there are many
potential uses for chemical sensors, their use is often complicated by calibration
requirements.
5.5.1 ISFET SENSORS
ISFETs sense the concentration (activity level) of a particular ion in a solution.
These devices are generally based on the enhancement-mode MOSFET structure,
shown in Figure 5.6.

A MOSFET has a metal gate electrode, insulated from the semiconductor
(silicon) wafer by a thin layer of silicon dioxide (oxide). The bulk of the
semiconductor (i.e., the substrate) is doped with impurities to make it p-type
silicon; in this material current is carried by positive charge carriers called
holes. On either side of the gate are small areas of silicon doped with impurities
so that negatively charged electrons are the main carriers in these n-type silicon
regions: the source and the drain. Both n-type and p-type silicon are used to
form diodes; current will ﬂow from p-type to n-type, but not vice versa. Thus,
to keep the bulk of the silicon substrate from interfering with the transistor
(gate, drain, and source), this is connected to the most negative part of the
circuit (often connected inside the transistor package to the source; although
the device may appear symmetrical, it should be connected according to the
pinout on the data sheet).
When in use, a positive voltage is applied to the gate. This repels holes
from the region near the gate and attracts electrons, forming, between the drain
and source, a small channel in which the majority charge carriers are electrons.
Current can ﬂow through this channel, and the amount of current that can ﬂow
depends on how large the channel is and, thus, on the voltage applied to the
gate.
In the ISFET, the gate metal is replaced with an ion-selective membrane
(Figure 5.7), and the device is immersed in a solution. Ions in the solution interact
with the ion-selective membrane. When there is a high concentration of positive
ions in the solution, a lot of them will accumulate on the gate, widening the
channel between the source and drain. With a low concentration of positively
charged ions, the channel will be narrow.
In order to ensure that the FET channel is biased to an optimum size
about which sensing can take place, the solution is maintained at a reference
potential by an electrode placed in it. Generally, the reference potential is

adjusted to maintain a constant current ﬂowing from the drain to the source,
so the ionic concentration will be directly related to the solution reference
potential with respect to the substrate potential (in the circuit shown in
Figure 5.7).
One signiﬁcant problem in the design and fabrication of ISFETs is ensuring
that the ion-selective membrane adheres to the device. If the integrity of the
membrane is compromised, then the device is useless; this problem has consid-
erable effect on the yield (percentage of functioning devices on a wafer) of the
fabrication process. The simplest ISFET device is a pH sensor, which employs
a glass (oxide) as the “membrane.”
5.5.2 ENZYME-BASED BIOSENSORS
Enzymes are highly speciﬁc in the reactions they catalyze. If an enzyme can be
immobilized on a sensing substrate and the reaction products detected, then one
has the basis of a highly selective biosensor. The enzyme-based biosensor
described in the following text is for monitoring glucose levels; this application
has been investigated considerably because glucose is important in diabetes and
in many industrial fermentation processes.
The operation of a glucose-oxidase-based sensor is shown schematically in
Figure 5.8. The enzyme is immobilized on a platinum electrode and covered with
a thin polyurethane membrane to protect the enzyme layer and reduce the depen-
dence of the sensor on blood oxygen levels. Glucose oxidase, in its oxidized
form, oxidizes the glucose entering the sensor to gluconic acid, resulting in the
conversion of the enzyme to its reduced form. The enzyme does not remain in

this form for long. It interacts with the oxygen entering through the membrane.
The products of this interaction are the oxidized form of the enzyme, two hydro-
gen ions, and two oxygen ions. When the platinum electrode is biased to the
correct potential, it will reduce one of the oxygen ions such that the end products
are oxygen and water. The resulting electrode current can be measured and will
be proportional to the concentration of glucose in the external medium. (Note
that this is a simpliﬁed explanation; there are also many other ways to monitor
the reaction).
One thing to note is that because the various molecules have to physically
move through the materials of the sensor, such biosensors can be quite slow to
respond to changes in the external medium.
5.6 MICROELECTRODES FOR NEUROPHYSIOLOGY
Microelectrodes of ﬁne-wire or electrolyte-ﬁlled micropipettes have been
used for some time now to study the nervous system on a cellular (individual
neuron) basis. These, in particular the metal wire microelectrodes, are prime
targets for the application of microengineering techniques. The small signal
amplitudes involved (in the region of 100 µV) and high interface impedances
(1 to 10 MΩ at 1 kHz) between the metal and the tissue mean that it is advan-
tageous to place the ampliﬁer as close as possible to the recording site. In addition,
the characteristics of microfabricated devices can be more reproducible than those
of handmade metal wire microelectrodes, and their small size enables the accurate
insertion of many recording sites into small volumes of tissue to study networks
of neurons or for neural prosthesis applications.
The microelectrodes operate by detecting the electrical potential generated
in the tissue near an active nerve ﬁber because of action potential currents ﬂowing
through the ﬁber membrane. There are three common types of micromachined
microelectrode (Figure 5.9). Array-type microelectrodes (Figure 5.9a) are used
to form the ﬂoor of cell culture dishes: signals are recorded from neurons that
are placed or grown over these. Probe-type microelectrodes (Figure 5.9b) have
recording sites on a long thin shank that is inserted into the tissue under inves-
tigation. Regeneration electrodes (Figure 5.9c) are placed between the ends of a
severed peripheral nerve trunk; nerve ﬁbers then regrow (regenerate) through the
device.
These microelectrodes can be quite difﬁcult to use. For array microelectrodes,
appropriate cell culture methods have to be developed and practiced. Probe types
have to be mounted on ampliﬁer boards, and different situations require probes
of many different shapes and size. Regeneration electrodes have to be ﬁxed to
the stumps of the nerve trunk and are required to be connected to the outside
world. All devices can potentially generate huge amounts of data that have to be
collected and analyzed.

MECHANICAL SENSORS
Two different types of mechanical sensors will be discussed here. The ﬁrst uses
physical mechanisms to directly sense the parameter of interest (e.g., distance
and strain). The second uses microstructures to enable the mechanical sensors to
detect parameters of interest (e.g., acceleration) that cannot be measured directly
with the ﬁrst type of sensor.
5.7.1 PIEZORESISTORS
The change in resistance of a material with applied strain is termed the piezore-
sistive effect. Piezoresistors are relatively easy to fabricate in silicon, being just
a small volume of silicon doped with impurities to make it n type or p type.
Piezoresistors also act as thermoresistors, so to compensate for changes in
ambient temperature they are usually connected in a bridge conﬁguration of some
sort with a dummy set; this is illustrated in Figure 5.10. Figure 5.10 illustrates
part of an accelerometer mass suspended by a beam from the bulk of the silicon
FIGURE 5.10 Piezoresistor conﬁguration: (a) piezoresistors (dark rectangles) are
implanted into the beam suspending an accelerometer mass, seen from above, and a
reference pair are implanted on a dummy beam; (b) the four resistors are connected in a
bridge circuit. If all resistances match, then Vdiff will be 0 V. If the beam bends as a result
of acceleration, then R2 will change its resistance and the bridge circuit will no longer be
balanced.

wafer (compare this with Figure 5.12, which shows a similar design in cross
section). Next to the suspension beam is a second beam, which is not attached
to the mass. Resistors have been implanted into both beams and the bulk of the
silicon substrate. These have been connected to form a bridge circuit (Chapter
11, Section 11.4 explains how this operates). Should the temperature change, the
close proximity of the four resistors ensures that they all experience the same
temperature and the bridge remains balanced. The use of the dummy beam not
connected to the mass is important because the resistor on the beam is in a slightly
different thermal than those implanted in the bulk of the wafer. Thus, only changes
in resistance induced by deformation of the beam will be registered.
5.7.2 PIEZOELECTRIC SENSORS
When a force is applied to a piezoelectric material, a charge proportional to the
applied force is induced on the surface. The applied force can thus be deduced
by measuring the electrical potential that appears across the crystal. Common
piezoelectric crystals used for microengineered devices include zinc oxide and
PZT (PbZrTiO3 — lead zirconate titanate), which can be deposited on micro-
structures and patterned.
5.7.3 CAPACITIVE SENSORS
For two parallel conducting plates separated by an insulating material, the capac-
itance between the plates is given by Equation 5.4, where A is the area of the

membrane is deformed, the resonant frequency of the bridge will change.

plates, d the distance between them, and ε a constant depending on the material
between the plates (this assumes that the circumference of the plates is much
larger than the distance between them, so what happens at the edges of the plates
can be neglected).
(5.4)
(For air, ε is approximately 8.9 × 10 − 12 F/m.) From this it can be seen that
the measured capacitance is inversely proportional to the distance between the
two plates. It is possible to use this technique to measure small displacements
(microns to tens of microns) with high accuracy (subnanometer); however, the
instrumentation required to measure capacitance changes can be a little complex.
The capacitor bridge, for example, is dealt with in Chapter 11, Subsection 11.4.1.
5.7.4 OPTICAL SENSORS
Silicon is a reﬂective material, as are other materials used in semiconductor device
fabrication (e.g., aluminum). Thus, optical means may be used to sense displace-
ment or deformation of microengineered beams, membranes, etc. A laser is
directed at the surface to be monitored in such a way that interference fringes
are set up. By analyzing these fringes, displacement or deformation may be
detected and quantiﬁed. One area in which optical sensing is often employed is
atomic force microscopy — to monitor the deﬂection of the beam upon which
the sensing tip is mounted (see discussion on scanning probe microscopy in
Chapter 10).
5.7.5 RESONANT SENSORS
These are based on micromachined beams or bridges that are driven to oscillate
at their resonant frequency. Changes in the resonant frequency of the device
would typically be monitored using implanted piezoresistors, capacitive, or
optical techniques.
Figure 5.11a shows a bridge driven to resonance on a thin membrane. The
resonant frequency of the bridge is related to the force applied to it (between
anchor points), its length, thickness, width, mass, and the modulus of elasticity
of the material from which it has been fabricated. If the membrane that the bridge
is mounted on is deformed (Figure 5.11b), for instance, there is greater pressure
on one side than the other. Then the force applied to the bridge changes, and
hence the resonant frequency changes.
Alternatively, a resonant device may be used as a biosensor by coating it with
a material that binds to the substance of interest. As more of the substance binds
to the device, its mass will be increased, again altering the resonant frequency.

5.7.6 ACCELEROMETERS
Microengineered acceleration sensors, accelerometers, consist of a mass suspended
from thin beams (Figure 5.12). As the device is accelerated, a force (force = mass
× acceleration) is developed, which bends the suspending beams. Piezoresistors
situated where the beams meet the support (where strain is greatest) can be used
to detect acceleration. Another alternative is to capacitively sense the displace-
ment of the mass.
5.7.7 PRESSURE SENSORS
Microengineered pressure sensors are usually based on thin membranes. On one
side is an evacuated cavity (for absolute pressure measurement), and the other
side is exposed to the pressure to be measured. The deformation of the membrane
is usually monitored using piezoresistors or capacitive techniques.

6 Microactuators
6.1 INTRODUCTION
Microactuators are required to drive resonant sensors (see Chapter 5, Subsection
5.7.5) to oscillate at their resonant frequency. They are also required to produce
the mechanical output required of particular microsystems: this may be to move
micromirrors to scan laser beams or switch them from one ﬁber to another, to
drive cutting tools for microsurgical applications, to drive micropumps and valves
for microanalysis or microﬂuidic systems, or these may even be microelectrode
devices to stimulate nervous tissue in neural prosthesis applications.
In the following section a variety of methods for achieving microactuation
are brieﬂy outlined: electrostatic, magnetic, piezoelectric, hydraulic, and thermal.
Of these, piezoelectric and hydraulic methods seem to be most promising,
although the others have their place. Electrostatic actuation runs a close third and
is possibly the most common and well-developed method, but it does suffer a
little from wear and sticking problems. Magnetic actuators usually require rela-
tively high currents (and high power) and, on the microscopic scale, electrostatic
actuation methods usually offer better output per unit volume (the limit is some-
where in the region of 1-cm3 to few-cubic-millimeter devices depending on the
application). Thermal actuators also require relatively large amounts of electrical
energy, and the heat generated has to be dissipated.
When dealing with very smooth surfaces, typical of micromachined devices,
sticking or cold welding of one part to another can be a problem. These effects
can increase friction to such a degree that all the output power of the device is
required just to overcome it, and they can even prevent some devices from
operating. Careful design and selection of materials can be used to overcome
these problems, but they still cause trouble with many micromotor designs.
Another point to be aware of is that when removing micromachined devices from
wet-etch baths, the surface tension in the liquid can be strong enough to stick
parts together.

ELECTROSTATIC ACTUATORS
For a parallel plate capacitor, the energy stored, U, is given in Equation 6.1 (where
C is the capacitance and V is the voltage across the capacitor).

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
When the plates of the capacitor move toward each other, the work done by
the attractive force between them can be computed as the change in U with
distance x. The force can be computed using Equation 6.2:
(6.2)
Note that only attractive forces can be generated in this instance. Also, to
generate large forces (which will do the useful work of the device), a large change
of capacitance with distance is required. This has led to the development of
electrostatic comb drives (Figure 6.1).
6.2.1 COMB DRIVES
These are particularly popular with surface-micromachined devices. They consist
of many interdigitated ﬁngers (Figure 6.1a). When a voltage is applied, an attrac-
tive force is developed between the ﬁngers, which move together (Figure 6.1b).
The increase in capacitance is proportional to the number of ﬁngers; so to generate
large forces, a large number of ﬁngers are required. One problem with this
device is that if the lateral gaps between the ﬁngers are not the same on both sides

(or if the device is jogged), then it is possible for the ﬁngers to move at right angles
to the intended direction of motion and stick together until the voltage is switched
off (and in the worst-case scenario, they will remain stuck even after that).
For a comb drive with N electrodes (or rather, 2N gaps between the ﬁngers),
the capacitance is approximately:
(6.3)
where h is the depth of the structure, g the gap between two electrode ﬁngers, x
the overlap of the two combs, and ε the permitivity. Thus:
(6.4)
6.2.2 WOBBLE MOTORS
Wobble motors are so called because of the rolling action by which they operate.
Figure 6.2a and Figure 6.2b show a surface-micromachined wobble motor design.
The rotor is a circular disk. In operation the electrodes beneath it are switched on
and off one after another. The disk is attracted to each electrode in turn, the edge

of the disk contacting the insulator over the electrode. In this manner it rolls slowly
around in a circle, making one revolution to many revolutions of the stator voltage.
Problems can arise if the insulating materials on the stator electrodes wear rapidly
or stick to the rotor. Also, if the rotor and bearing are not circular (this is possible
because many CAD packages draw circles as many-sided polygons), then the rotor
can get stuck on its ﬁrst revolution.
A problem with surface-micromachined motors is that they have very small
vertical dimensions, so it is difﬁcult to achieve large changes of capacitance with
the motion of the rotor. LIGA techniques can be used to overcome this problem —
for instance, the wobble motor shown in Figure 6.2c and Figure 6.2d, where the
cylindrical rotor rolls around the stator.
6.3
MAGNETIC ACTUATORS
Microstructures are often fabricated by electroplating techniques, using nickel.
This is particularly common with LIGA. Nickel is a (weakly) ferromagnetic
material and so lends itself to use in magnetic microactuators. An example of
a magnetic microactuator is the linear motor shown in Figure 6.3. The magnet
resting in the channel is levitated and driven back and forth by switching
current into the various coils on either side of the channel at the appropriate
time.
From Figure 6.3, one common problem with magnetic actuators is clear:
the coils are two dimensional (three-dimensional coils are difﬁcult to micro-
fabricate). Also, the choice of magnetic materials is limited to those that can
be easily micromachined, so the material of the magnet is not always optimum.
This tends to lead to a rather high power consumption and heat dissipation
for magnetic actuators. In addition, with microscopic components (up to about
millimeter dimensions), electrostatic devices are typically stronger than mag-
netic devices for equivalent volumes, whereas magnetic devices excel for larger
dimensions.

6.4 PIEZOELECTRIC ACTUATORS
The piezoelectric effect mentioned previously for use in force sensors also works
in reverse. If a voltage is applied across a ﬁlm of piezoelectric material, a force
is generated. Examples of how this may be used are given in Figure 6.4. In Figure
6.4a, a layer of piezoelectric material is deposited on a beam. When a voltage is
applied, the stress generated causes the beam to bend (Figure 6.4b).
The same principle can be applied to thin silicon membranes (Figure 6.4c).
When a voltage is applied, the membrane deforms (Figure 6.4d). This, when
combined with microvalves, can be used to pump ﬂuids through a microﬂuidic
system.
When fabricating piezoelectric devices, it is necessary to ensure that the ﬁlms
are suitably thick so that high enough voltages can be applied without dielectric
breakdown (sparks or short circuits across the ﬁlm).
6.5 THERMAL ACTUATORS
Thermal microactuators are commonly either of the bimetallic type or use the
expansion of a liquid or gas.
In Figure 6.5a, a beam is machined from one material (e.g., silicon) and a
layer of material with a different coefﬁcient of thermal expansivity (e.g., alumi-
num). When the two are heated, one material expands faster than the other, and
the beam bends (Figure 6.5b). Heating may be accomplished by passing current
through the device, thus heating it electrically.
Figure 6.5c shows a cavity containing a volume of ﬂuid with a thin membrane
as one wall. The current passed through a heating resistor causes the liquid in
the cavity to expand, deforming the membrane (Figure 6.5d). The most effective
method of actuation is critical point heating. A liquid with a suitably low boiling
point is chosen and actuation is effected not merely through thermal expansion
of the liquid but by heating it to its boiling point. The large volume change that

accompanies the state change from liquid to gas can be used to create a very
powerful actuator.
Thermally actuated devices can develop relatively large forces, and the heating
elements consume fairly large amounts of power. Also, the heated material has to
cool down to return the actuator to its original position; so the heat has to be
dissipated into the surrounding structure. This will take a ﬁnite amount of time and
will affect the speed at which such actuators can be operated. There is also a trade-
off: the faster it cools, the more energy used to heat the device to actuation point.
6.6
HYDRAULIC ACTUATORS
Despite problems associated with leaky valves and seals (a problem in many
microﬂuidic systems), hydraulic actuators have considerable potential as quite a
lot of power can be delivered from an external source along very-narrow-diameter
tubes. This has potential in areas such as catheter-tip-mounted microsurgical tools.
LIGA techniques can be used to fabricate turbines (as in Figure 6.6), which
can deliver power to cutting tools.

6.7 MULTILAYER BONDED DEVICES
Surface micromachining (Chapter 2, Subsection 2.7.2) provides an obvious way
to build complex multilayered structures. The disadvantage of this approach
is that the vertical dimensions of the structures are usually quite small (on the
order of microns rather than hundreds of microns). A similar approach is available
for bulk micromachined devices, whereby bulk micromachined wafers are stacked
and bonded together. There are obvious problems with registration and alignment,
and devices constructed in this way are generally quite large. Figure 6.7 gives a
cross section through a hypothetical microﬂuidic device constructed using this
method.
6.8 MICROSTIMULATORS
One further method of actuation is illustrated by the use of microelectrode devices
to electrically stimulate activity of nerves and muscles. Common designs for these
devices have already been discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.6). The use of micro-
electrode devices facilitates highly speciﬁc stimulation of individual nerve ﬁbers
compared to other methods of stimulation; this should allow ﬁner control of the
stimulation provided enough electrode sites can be inserted into the tissue.
As relatively large stimulating currents have to be passed through the elec-
trode sites, microelectrodes for stimulation generally have geometrically larger
electrode sites than those for recording (500 µm2 and above compared to 16 µm2
and above). This is necessary, otherwise the currents involved will damage the
electrode sites.
One area in which silicon microengineering is being applied in the hope that
it will result in a considerable improvement over more conventional electrodes
is the area of visual prosthesis — providing rudimentary vision for the blind.

One project involves a “forest” of silicon needles that will be inserted in the
visual cortex.
Early visual prosthetic devices involved an array of electrodes placed on the
surface of the visual cortex (brain). When activated, blind volunteers could see
points of light (phosphenes). However, these devices required relatively high
currents to operate, and the image was distorted by afterdischarges and interac-
tions between groups of neurons. This led to the suggestion that a method for
more selective stimulation of neurons within the visual cortex was required to
provide any functional form of vision. So this is an area is which microengineering
technology is recently being applied.

7 Micro Total Analysis 
Systems
7.1 INTRODUCTION
The term micro total analysis system (µTAS) was originally coined by a group of
researchers to describe the kind of chemical processing system outlined in
Figure 7.1. This goes beyond chemical sensors or biosensors as it is modeled on
the analytical procedures often found in industry:
•
Go to the site of investigation.
•
Take samples.
•
Return the samples to the laboratory.
•
Prepare the samples: ﬁlter, centrifuge, and split up for different
processes.
•
Perform analysis — this may involve a series of chemical reactions
and may even be performed by robots.
•
Record examination results.
•
Adjust the industrial process if necessary.
•
Repeat as frequently as required.
Obviously, this is not always very convenient. For instance, water companies
want to know the results as soon as possible when there has been a pollution
incident — before the polluted water reaches the consumer and preferably before
there has been any major environmental damage. Furthermore, regular sampling
and analysis can be a very expensive process. Highly trained staff have to be
employed in an expensively equipped laboratory, and people must go regularly
to the appropriate sampling points, which may be long distances apart in the case
of large companies or for some systems. Many processes involve hazardous
chemicals that are very difﬁcult to sample, transport, and dispose of. The same
may be said of the chemical reagents used to analyze the sample, and these may
also be very expensive. In the worst situation, the entire manufacturing process
may need to be shut down to enable it to be investigated properly.
Given all these challenges, it is not surprising that microengineering tech-
niques were applied to the area of chemical analysis quite early on. In fact, one
of the ﬁrst commercial applications (developed in the 1970s) was the Stanford
gas chromatograph, developed by Terry, Jerman, and Angell. This provided a
system for separating and detecting gases in a sample on a single silicon wafer.
The main focus in this chapter will be on the core elements of µTAS — the
microﬂuidic, electrophoretic separation systems that it employs, and the detection

systems. Other aspects will, however, also be explored. These include a more general
treatment of so-called “biochips” and a very brief introduction to chemistry.
7.2 BASIC CHEMISTRY
For the purposes of this book, it is convenient to divide chemistry into three groups:
inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, and biochemistry. Inorganic chemistry deals
with the chemical reactions and properties of small and relatively simple molecules.
Organic chemistry deals essentially with carbon chemistry. Carbon is a special
element, which forms complex long-chain molecules; it is the basis of polymers
(plastics, oils, etc.) and life. Biochemistry is a subset of organic chemistry and deals
speciﬁcally with the molecules found in living organisms: proteins, lipids, carbo-
hydrates, nucleic acids, and their component parts.

Manz & Becker, “Microsystem Technology in Chemistry and Life Sciences,” Springer, 1998).
FIGURE 7.2 Part of the Periodic Table. The upper number in each cell is the atomic
number (the number of protons in each atom). The lower number is the mass number.
This represents the number of protons and neutrons in an atom; it is not twice the number
of protons in some cases because the naturally occurring substance is made up of different
isotopes (one or two extra or missing neutrons). Metals have been shaded.

7.2.1 INORGANIC CHEMISTRY
Any exploration of chemistry starts with the Periodic Table of Elements, such as
that shown in Figure 7.2. For simplicity, Figure 7.2 only shows a subsection of
the Periodic Table.
Matter is composed of atoms of the different elements, which combine (react)
according to known rules. Atoms are composed of three types of subatomic parti-
cles: protons and neutrons, which are found in the center (nucleus) of the atom,
and electrons, which form a cloud around the nucleus. The protons in the nucleus
each carry one unit of positive charge, and the electrons each carry one unit of
negative charge. The atomic number (Figure 7.2) of the element is the number of
protons in the nucleus. In a normal atom, the number of electrons in the atom is
equal to the number of protons, and the atom carries zero charge. In certain
circumstances, it is possible to add or remove electrons from the atom; the resulting
charged particle is called an ion.
The electrons crowd near the nucleus, and as the number of electrons in the
atom increases, not all of them get an equal share of the nucleus. It is convenient
to consider the electrons as existing in different energy shells — related to the
amount of energy required to remove them from the atom. For an atom with a
lot of electrons, it is relatively easy to remove the ﬁrst one (ionize the atom), but
as more and more electrons are removed, more and more energy is required.
The basic rule of chemistry is that an atom would like to ﬁll its outer shell with
electrons (this being, energetically, the most preferable state to be in). However, if
it were to simply add or shed electrons at a whim, matter would be electrically
charged. But matter (on the macroscopic scale and, in general, over time) remains
electrically neutral. It has already been noted that it takes energy to ionize an atom,
and in the absence of that energy, electrons will simply ﬂow from negatively charged
areas to positively charged ones so that both become neutral. The atom, therefore,
has two options to achieve this neutral state. Either it can borrow electrons from
another atom (or atoms), in which case the resulting ions must stay close together
to ensure their charges cancel out and give an overall appearance of neutrality, or
it can share electrons with another atom (or atoms), in which case the atoms must
stay so close together that a single electron cloud can envelop them.
Amount of Substance
Elements also have an associated mass number. This is the number of protons
plus neutrons in a sample of the element as it naturally occurs. It is not always
exactly twice the atomic number, as may be expected, because many elements
exist as different isotopes with slightly different numbers of neutrons. The
relative abundance of these isotopes gives rise to noninteger atomic masses.
The atomic mass of an element expressed in grams is one molar mass (M) of
the element and contains 6.02 × 1023 atoms (this is the Avogadro constant).
1 M dissolved in 1 l of water gives a solution of 1-mol concentration.

158
Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
This gives rise to two kinds of bonds: the ionic bond, formed between ions,
and the covalent bond, formed when electrons are shared equally between atoms.
The number of electrons that comprise a full outer shell can be determined
from the group in which the element appears in the Periodic Table (Figure 7.2);
this has been summarized in Table 7.1. The notable exception is hydrogen. It
normally loses an electron to form a positive hydrogen ion, but it can form a
negatively charged hydronium ion.
Figure 7.2 shows two divisions: metals and nonmetals; semimetals can be
found along the line on the nonmetal side. Compounds formed when metals
react with nonmetals form ionic bonds. Atoms of nonmetallic elements combine
by forming covalent bonds. The elements in group I and group VII are generally
more reactive than those in the other groups. Elements in group VIII are the
most inert, and these are the only gaseous elements that can be found in their
atomic state under normal conditions; all the others forms combine into mol-
ecules (oxygen atoms pair up, for instance, to form oxygen molecules). In the
solid state, atoms are bonded together into some sort of crystalline or amorphous
structure.
Pure elemental metals do not form either ionic or covalent bonds. Rather,
they exist in a state in which the electrons in the outer shells escape from the
inﬂuence of the particular nucleus, so the atoms in a metal can be considered
as ﬂoating in a sea of electrons; this is why metals conduct electricity so well.
In semiconductors, there is sufﬁcient energy at room temperature to enable
electrons to occasionally escape from the inﬂuence of a particular nucleus, but
they are soon captured by another; thus, they conduct electricity but not as well
as metals do.

7.2.1.1 Bond Formation
Chemical reactions between elements in group I or group II with elements in
group VII will form ionic bonds.
Common table salt, sodium chloride, is formed from one atom of sodium
combining with one atom of chlorine. As suggested from Table 7.1, the sodium
atom gives up an electron to become a sodium ion (denoted as Na+), and the
chlorine atom gains an electron, becoming a chlorine ion (Cl−); the two ions
combine to form the compound, thus:
Na + Cl → NaCl 
(7.1)
Magnesium, however, loses two electrons (becoming Mg2+), and these ions
are accepted by two chlorine atoms:
Mg + 2Cl → MgCl2
(7.2)
The movement of electrons is not normally explicitly stated in chemical equa-
tions unless they are provided from an unusual source, such as an electric current
from an electrode, or if the equation needs to be broken down for some reason.
The metals of group I burn well in air and react violently with water (H2O,
a combination of hydrogen and oxygen); for this reason, they are stored under
oil. The relevant equations for potassium are:
2K + O → K2O 
(7.3)
and
2K + 2H2O → 2KOH + H2
(7.4)
Similarities between Elements
This section has been written in a way that suggests that the chemical properties
of an element follow from its position in the Periodic Table. The historical truth
is that the table was originally developed by grouping elements that exhibited
similar chemical properties. It was only later that these were formally related
to atomic structure in the manner described.  
Combination of Sodium and Chlorine
In more detail, showing the formation of sodium and chloride ions and the
transfer of electrons, Equation 7.1 develops as follows:
Na → Na+ + e−

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
Notice that in Equation 7.4, a hydrogen molecule (H2) has been given off by
the reaction. The other product of the reaction, potassium hydroxide, is formed
from the combination of a potassium (K+) ion and a hydroxide (OH−) ion. Where
elements naturally occur in molecular form, then it is normal to show this in the
chemical equation. Equation 7.1 to Equation 7.3 thus become:
2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl 
(7.5)
Mg ++ Cl2 → MgCl2
(7.6)
4K + O2 → 2K2O 
(7.7)
Covalent-bond formation arises due to the sharing of electrons. In Equation 7.5
and Equation 7.6 it has been suggested that chlorine forms a molecule of two
chlorine atoms. Because chlorine is a nonmetal, this involves the formation of a
covalent bond. From Table 7.1 and Figure 7.2, it can been seen that chlorine has
seven electrons in its outer shell; it would like to have eight. It can achieve this
by sharing a pair of electrons with another chlorine molecule, with each atom
donating one of the pair, as shown in Figure 7.3. (Obviously, it is not possible
to tell which electron came from which atom, as illustrated.)
This sharing of a pair of electrons forms a single covalent bond, which is
graphically depicted by a single line (Figure 7.3). Two nitrogen atoms, on the other
hand, have to share three pairs, which results in a very strong triple bond; carbon
burns in air to form carbon dioxide, with two double bonds (see Figure 7.4).
Because the electrons are shared between atoms in a covalent bond, they
cannot be everywhere at once. As a result, at any one time, one part of the resulting
molecule will be slightly negative and another part will be slightly positive. This
gives rise to a very weak form of intermolecular bonding, termed van der Waals
bonding. When the atoms in the molecule are of different elements, carbon and
chlorine for example, then it may well be that one component of the molecule is
more attractive to electrons than the other. In the case of carbon tetrachloride

bond can also be drawn as a straight line.

(CCl4), there will be a dipole setup with the chlorine atoms being slightly more
negative than the carbon atoms, i.e., the bonds will be polarized.
This effect is very important in water, where the bonds between hydrogen and
oxygen are polarized. This gives rise to hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) between the
water molecules (Figure 7.5), which means that water is a liquid at room temper-
ature and pressure, whereas the much heavier carbon dioxide molecule is a gas.
7.2.1.2
pH
In an aqueous solution (i.e., when substances are dissolved in water), things are
never constant. Water molecules themselves are continually breaking up and
recombining, although most of them will remain as molecules for the majority
of the time. As with all chemical equations, however, an equilibrium is set up:
H2O ↔ H3O+ + OH−
(7.8)
The degree to which this reaction is shifted to the right-hand side of the
equation is shown by the pH, which is a logarithmic measure of the concentration
of hydrogen ions in the solution. Pure water has a pH of 7. A pH of less than 7
means that the solution is hydrogen-ion-rich and therefore acidic. A pH of more
than 7 means that it is hydrogen-ion-poor (and thus rich in hydroxide, OH−, ions)
or alkaline. Compounds that dissolve readily in water, giving up hydrogen ions,
therefore form acids. Hydrogen chloride (HCl) is one example of a gas that forms
a strong acid when dissolved in water.
Potassium hydroxide (KOH, see Equation 7.4), when dissolved in water, releases
hydroxide ions and so forms an alkaline solution (alkali-forming compounds are
called bases). Potassium hydroxide and hydrogen chloride react in solution:
KOH (s) + HCl (aq) → KCl (aq) + H2O (l)
(7.9)
(Acid plus base forms a salt plus water.) The states of the different compounds
are given in brackets. A solid powder of potassium hydroxide is dissolved in an

aqueous solution of hydrogen chloride, giving rise to an aqueous solution of
potassium chloride and water (a liquid).
7.2.2 ORGANIC CHEMISTRY
Carbon is the most versatile of all the elements and forms many complex mole-
cules. Organic chemistry is the name given to the study of carbon chemistry,
because it is this chemistry that is the basis of life on this planet. The basic form
is the long-chain saturated hydrocarbon, the alkane. Table 7.2 shows the chemical
formula, name, and bond structure of the ﬁrst few alkanes.
It is important to note that the structures shown in Table 7.2 are merely
two-dimensional representations of three-dimensional structures (Figure 7.6).

Additionally, although stick-and-ball models such as those in Figure 7.6 clearly show
the structure, other models are also used. These may show the approximate distribu-
tions of electrons about the molecules (electron orbitals) or the charge on the molecule.
A variety of different models can be generated by computer for different purposes.
The other important thing to note is that the chemical formula does not clearly
deﬁne the structure. Figure 7.7 shows two representations of C4H10. Figure 7.7a
is butane but Figure 7.7b is, in fact, 2-methylpropane. 
FIGURE 7.6 Stick-and-ball models of methane, butane, ethane, propane, and the six-
carbon benzene ring. Note that in the case of benzene, there are three double bonds; in
practice, the electrons do not know where to form these bonds, which means that there is
a cloud of delocalized electrons around the ring.
Naming Hydrocarbons
The (IUPAC) standard procedure is:
1. Name the longest carbon chain.
2. Name the substituent groups.
3. Give the positions of the substituent groups.
The groups are numbered, counting from the end that gives the lowest
number.

Unsaturated hydrocarbons are those containing a double (-ene) or triple (-yne)
bond between carbon atoms (Figure 7.8). Also, as shown in Figure 7.7, the carbon
atoms can form a variety of ring structures (cyclic molecules) as well as long chains.
Table 7.3 lists a variety of different functional groups that can add on to a
hydrocarbon molecule to change its chemistry, and Figure 7.9 illustrates some
different kinds of stereoisomers (molecules that have the same chemical and
structural formula but different arrangements of bonds in space).
7.2.2.1 Polymers
Carbon compounds can contain very long chains of carbon atoms, plastics being
one such example. The molecules of plastics are made of repeats of many smaller
identical units. The common plastic polythene (actually, polyethene) is composed
of many ethene molecules (Equation 7.10). In the presence of a strong catalyst (which
is something that assists in a reaction without being consumed itself), the double
bond between carbon atoms is opened out, enabling two molecules to join. This
leaves two more bonds at the end of the chain, encouraging more molecules to join,
and so on, until something causes the chain to stop growing (running out of ethene
molecules, for instance). One consequence of this is that the molecules in a plastic
will be of different lengths, depending on when the chains stopped growing:
nCH2 = CH2(g) → –(CH2–CH2)–n 
(7.10)
Polymers can also form through chemical reactions between two small
precursor materials. Nylon 66 is formed by a reaction between a diamine
(hexane-1,6-diamine) and a dicarboxylic acid (hexane-1,6-dioic acid):
nH2N(CH2)6NH2 + nHOOC(CH2)4COOH →
–(HN(CH2)6NHOC(CH2)4CO)–n + 2nH2O 
(7.11)
FIGURE 7.8 (a) Ethene, (b) ethyne.
Cross-Linking
The properties of a polymer can be further controlled by adding agents that
join chains together; this is known as cross-linking. The physical properties
will depend on the amount of the chemical that is added, which controls the
amount of cross-linking that occurs. Rubbers are a good example of the
application of cross-linking; many are very soft in their pure state, but increas-
ing the crosslinking makes them harder and chemically more resilient.

7.2.2.2
Silicones
As mentioned earlier, elements in the same group in the Periodic Table have
similar properties. Therefore, one may reasonably expect that silicon should be
capable of forming long-chain molecules similar to those formed by carbon.
Although silicon does not act exactly as carbon does, it can be coerced into
forming long-chain molecules with a silicon–oxygen backbone. Carbon side
chains on these molecules prevent them from forming three-dimensional struc-
tures and control their properties. These polyorganosiloxanes can be liquids (oils),
gels, or solids (rubbers). The most common polyorganosiloxane is polydimeth-
ylsiloxane (PDMS). The basic repeating unit is:
(CH3)2SiO
To control the length of the chain formed, end-blocking molecules are added
(see Figure 7.10).

Silicones are important engineering materials (not just for MEMS) because
they are chemically relatively inert and stable with changes in temperature.
Silicones are not naturally occurring polymers, unlike long-chain carbon mole-
cules, and have to be manufactured.
7.2.3 BIOCHEMISTRY
Because organic chemistry has developed from its original deﬁnition as the
chemistry of compounds found in living things to encompass the entirety of
carbon-based chemistry, biochemistry has developed to encompass this original
area: the molecules found in living organisms and how they work together.
Different molecules in the cells of living organisms perform different func-
tions. These include, among others, the following:
•
Storage of genetic information (which encodes instructions for making
different proteins — it apparently stores all the information required
to make an organism)
•
Replication of genetic information
•
Translation of genetic information into proteins
•
Formation of structural elements (membranes and skeletal components,
and also molecular machines)
•
Energy storage
•
Signaling (enabling the cell to react to different environmental condi-
tions)
•
Communication (with other cells)
•
Catalysts
This section will introduce three of the major classes of large molecules in the
cell — proteins, lipids, carbohydrates — and the nucleic acids. The two nucleic
acids, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) are the molecules
that store genetic information (DNA) and translate it into proteins (RNA).
Proteins are the workhorses in the cell: they form structures, such as the
skeleton, molecular motors, molecular machines, and signaling systems. They
also participate in or catalyze the reactions used to build (synthesize) other
molecules (anabolism) and break down molecules (catabolism).
One of the main tasks for lipids in the cell is the formation of membranes within
the cell as well as those that form the outer skins of cells. The cell is not, as it may
Silanes
The small molecules of silicon chemistry are silanes (or organosilanes if they
involve carbon atoms). The simplest molecule of them all is silane itself:

ﬁrst appear, a number of interconnected reaction chambers (analogous to an indus-
trial chemical plant, where chemicals enter at various points and are pumped through
pipes into different reaction vessels, at different temperatures and pressures, until
the desired chemical product emerges at the other end). It is much more analogous
to a manufacturing plant with robots moving various components around and assem-
bling them into larger parts. A lot of this work takes place on membranes (or by
proteins embedded in membranes). Additionally, small molecules (or ions) can be
pumped across membranes as required, larger molecules can be made to ﬂip from
one side of a membrane to the other, and membranes can even be formed into
spherical vesicles, which then detach and can carry a particular cargo to another part
of the cell. The main components of these membranes are lipids.
Probably the best known carbohydrate is sugar, which is an energy store. The
use of carbohydrate as a structural component is most obvious in plants, where
the ﬁbrous cell walls are formed from a carbohydrate (cellulose), and the exo-
skeletons of insects (chitin). Carbohydrates also combine with proteins, forming
glycoproteins, which take on various tasks. In humans, they are evident (on a
common day-to-day basis) as mucopolysaccharides, which form syrupy or gel-
like mixtures in water (mucus).
7.2.3.1 Proteins
Proteins are complex polymers composed of amino acids — small organic mol-
ecules that incorporate an amino group (–NH2) and a carboxyl group (–COOH)
(see Table 7.3). The amino group of one amino acid in the protein reacts with the
carboxyl group of the next forming a peptide bond; proteins are, therefore, also
called polypeptides. Although there are a vast number of possible amino acids, there
are only 20 that are encoded for in DNA and commonly found in proteins (they can,
however, be modiﬁed after being incorporated into the protein). These are:
•
Alanine
•
Arginine
•
Asparagine
•
Aspartic acid
•
Cystine
•
Glutamic acid
•
Glutamine
•
Glycine
•
Histadine
•
Isoleucine
•

•
Lysine
•
Methionine

•
Serine

•
Threonine
•
Tryptophan
•
Tyrosine
•
Valine
The basic form of 19 of the common amino acids is shown in Figure 7.11.
Proline is the exception to the rule. The fundamental (primary) structure of a
protein, then, is in the form of a chain of amino acids, with a backbone of peptide
bonds from which project different side chains.
It was noted in Subsection 7.2.1.1 that different molecules are polarized to
different extents. This is true of the amino acid side chains in proteins. Related
to this, it can be seen that different side chains are more or less hydrophobic (do
not mix with water); this is important because water is a very small molecule
compared to most biological molecules, and as a result, a single protein may be
surrounded by thousands of water molecules. The polarized side chains and
hydrophobic side chains cause the protein molecule to fold up on itself, the degree
of folding being restricted by the ﬂexibility of the bonds between amino acids in
the chain. This gives rise to a further level of structure within the protein molecule
itself — the secondary structure.
The features of the secondary structure can generally be classiﬁed as either
helices, sheets, loops, or turns. A helix occurs when amino acids along the
backbone of the protein coil up. A sheet occurs when several lengths of amino
acid chains run parallel to one another. Helices and sheets are normally intercon-
nected by short turns or may have longer chains (loops) between them.
It is, however, the way that these features fold in on themselves — the tertiary
structure — that gives the biggest clue to what a protein does. This determines
the shape of the protein and how charge is distributed over its surface. Proteins
may be designed to bond very speciﬁcally to particular molecules or to hold two
molecules close together in order to catalyze the reaction between them. Alter-
natively, the addition or removal of a phosphate group may radically alter the
shape of the molecule, enabling it to act as a motor, for instance.
There is a further level of structure — the quaternary structure — in which
different polypeptides come together to form very complex structures (protein
machines) and the individual protein molecules are not covalently bonded together,
although they act as one unit. A simple example of this is in the protein coats that
some viruses use for protection outside the cell. These are formed of many identical
protein subunits that come together to form a regular geometric structure.

7.2.3.2
Nucleic Acids
Nucleic acids are polymers formed of nucleotides. Nucleotides are formed of
bases joined to a sugar residue that has a phosphate group attached. The two
nucleic acids commonly found in living organisms are DNA and RNA. The
component parts of these are:
•
Bases: uracil (U), cytosine (C), thymine (T), adenine (A), and guanine
(G), Uracil is found in DNA but is replaced by thymine in RNA.
•
Sugar: ribose or deoxyribose.
The different bases are termed purines or pyramidines, depending on their
structure (see Figure 7.12); ribose and deoxyribose differ by the presence or
absence of an oxygen atom (see Figure 7.13). The assembly of the whole into a
FIGURE 7.12 The ﬁve bases: (a) uracil, (b) cytosine, (c) thymine, (d) adenine, (e) guanine.
Molecular Mass
The molecular weights of proteins and other macromolecules, such as nucleic
acids, are usually given in daltons (Da). A Dalton is 1/12 the mass of a 12C atom.
Proteins have molecular weights ranging from about 5,000 to over 1,000,000 Da.

chain via phosphate residues (PO4
3 −) is illustrated in Figure 7.14. Note that in
these ﬁgures, carbon and hydrogen atoms have been left out for clarity. If bonds
have been shown without atoms being labeled, it is assumed to be a carbon atom
with the appropriate number of hydrogen atoms. Additionally, the term “base” is
also used ambiguously when referring to the complete base–sugar structure in
the DNA or RNA molecule itself.
In the cell, information is stored in the DNA, which is chemically more stable
than RNA. The key to information storage in DNA is that each purine base forms
hydrogen bonds with a particular pyramidine base: cytosine pairs with guanine
and uracil (or thymine) pairs with adenine (see Figure 7.15). This means that two
complementary strands of DNA can bind together, which they do, forming a
double-helical structure. When the cell divides (to reproduce), one strand goes
to one daughter cell and the other strand goes to the other daughter cell. The
complementary strands are then rebuilt.
FIGURE 7.14 Nucleic acid chain (DNA).
DNA Strand Direction
Single DNA strands have two ends, the 3 end and the 5 end; the terminology
arises from the standard nomenclature for the carbon atoms in the sugar ring.
When synthesizing a long strand of DNA, the 3 (sugar) carbon atom of the
next base will attach to the 5 (sugar) carbon atom of the base at the 5 end of
the chain. In double-stranded DNA, the 5 end of one molecule pairs up with
the 5 end of the other.

Information encoded in the DNA is copied (transcribed) onto shorter strands
of RNA. Molecular machines then interpret these and assemble proteins, amino
acid by amino acid. Three bases form a codon, which is generally translated as
shown in Table 7.4. RNAs can form complex structures by hydrogen bonding
with themselves and have many other functions in the cell; notably, the machine
that assembles proteins is substantially RNA driven.
There are many other sequences in the DNA that code for different things.
The most obvious are codons that tell the assembly machinery where to start
reading the RNA code and translate it into a protein, and a second sequence is
to stop the machinery and make it release the protein. Other sequences in the
DNA are designed to allow transcription factors to bind. A stretch of DNA will
only be transcribed into RNA (and thence into protein) if another molecular
machine can bind to it and start the process of transcription. Because only small
parts of the DNA need to be transcribed at any one time, transcription factors
bind close to these to enable the transcription machinery to get started.
7.2.3.3
Lipids
Lipids are virtually insoluble in water but can be dissolved in relatively nonpolar
solvents such as chloroform. There are many forms of lipids that are of interest in
biochemistry; however, this subsection will deal only with fats, phospholipids and,
brieﬂy, with cholesterol. These are important in the formation of membranes and,

as such, are doubly relevant to this book because the formation of membranes and
artiﬁcial vesicles (liposomes) are of interest from the point of view of nanotech-
nology. Other lipids include waxes, sphingolipids, glycolipids, and lipoproteins.
7.2.3.3.1 Fats
Fats are formed by the reaction of a carboxylic acid with glycerol (Figure 7.16).
Any of the three hydroxyl groups may undergo this reaction, forming a monoglyc-
eride (only one), diglyceride (two), or triglyceride (all three). The carboxylic
acids that are found to form fats in nature are termed fatty acids.
Fats are further classiﬁed as saturated or unsaturated, depending on whether
they contain only single carbon–carbon bonds or not.
7.2.3.3.2 Phospholipids
Phospholipids are lipids that have one or more phosphate (PO4
3−) residues. The
commonest form is the phosphoglyceride (see Figure 7.17). The phospholipids are
amphipathic compounds, having a polar head (the phosphate residue) and a non-
polar tail. As a result, in water, the heads tend to dissolve and the tails to aggregate.
This gives rise to three basic structures in water (Figure 7.18). The lipid bilayer is
the basic form of lipid membrane, with the polar heads facing out toward water
and the nonpolar tails in the center. This can fold into a spherical liposome, but if
there are very few molecules involved, then a micelle will form instead.

The membranes in a cell are based on lipid bilayers. Proteins may be embed-
ded in one side of the bilayer or may form a bridge (or pore) from one side to
the other. In cells, there appears to be a tendency for proteins to congregate
together in membranes rather than to ﬂoat around freely bumping into one another.
7.2.3.3.3
Cholesterol
This chemical is particularly well known because of its association with heart
disease. Cholesterol is an example of a group of lipids known as steroids, which

hydrocarbon tails, then the fat is said to be saturated.

fulﬁll many different roles in organisms. They are characterized by the ring
system, which can clearly be seen in the cholesterol molecule (Figure 7.19).
The cholesterol molecule is much smaller than the tails of the phospholipids
that make up biological membranes, and because of the ring system it is quite
a rigid molecule. As a result, one of its functions is to stiffen biological
membranes.
7.2.3.4 Carbohydrates
Once again, there are many different chemical compounds that are termed car-
bohydrates (or saccharides). Many, but not all, follow the general formula
Cn(H2O)n. Single monosaccharide units may join together to form disaccharides,
oligosaccharides (about 2 to 11 units), or polysaccharides. Glucose is an example
of a common monosaccharide (Figure 7.20; note that it can form a ring, or cyclic,
structure), and sugar (sucrose) is an example of a disaccharide. Polysaccharides
include compounds such as glycogen, which stores energy in animals, and cel-
lulose (Figure 7.21), which is a major structural component of plants. Modiﬁed
polysaccharides, such as mucopolysaccharides, take on a variety of roles in

7.3 APPLICATIONS OF MICROENGINEERED 
DEVICES IN CHEMISTRY AND BIOCHEMISTRY
The characteristics of microengineered devices and systems, relevant to chemical
and biochemical applications, are:
•
Small size; this means small volumes (so only small quantities of
reagent are required), the ratio of surface area to volume is high,
laminar ﬂow in small capillaries may cause problems when mixing,
small distances for reagents to diffuse, and low thermal mass (rapid
heating and cooling).
•
Reproducible dimensions and mass production. This raises the possi-
bility of disposable devices.
•
Massively parallel systems are possible.
•
On-chip processing of data.
Of course, these are not necessarily advantages. A high surface-area-to-
volume ratio can be advantageous if part of the process involves molecules
becoming attached to the walls of the device but can be a disadvantage if a channel
has to be ﬂushed clean during the process.
The following subsections summarize some of the general procedures
involved in chemistry and biochemistry that may be helped by miniaturization.

7.3.1 CHEMISTRY
7.3.1.1
Synthesis
Compounds are produced by combining a number of precursor compounds in a
ﬁxed sequence under speciﬁc conditions. Microengineered devices can be of use
in a number of ways, principally through their size. When expensive reagents are
involved, they can cut down on waste. This is also an advantage when hazardous
chemicals are required as part of the process. Furthermore, instead of transporting
large volumes of hazardous chemicals between industrial sites and the sites where
they are required, it can be envisaged that miniature chemical plants could be
developed to produce, from the less hazardous precursors, only the quantity
required at the point of use. Lower thermal mass and smaller size mean that steep
temperature gradients can be developed and maintained, resulting in faster results.
Most industrial chemical processes are large-scale operations, however. One
problem in developing new compounds is scaling up from a laboratory procedure
to industrial-scale production. Microengineering may be able to help here too:
rather than scaling up, many thousands of chips could be run in parallel.
Finally, there is the opportunity to investigate some novel chemistry. Chemical
reaction rates can be controlled by moving a plug of one reagent through a
stationary volume of a second reagent, for example (see the section on electroos-
motic ﬂow). The chemist may also choose to explore the surface-to-volume ratio
or other aspects of the systems.
7.3.1.2
Process and Environmental Monitoring
In many production processes, it is necessary to monitor and control many
different parameters to ensure the consistency and quality of the ﬁnal product.
There are also requirements for environmental monitoring: identifying toxic
chemicals entering the water supply, for example. A further related application
is the identiﬁcation of biological or chemical warfare agents in the environment.
For many substances, this process is done off-line: someone visits the site on a
regular basis, takes samples, and sends them to a central laboratory where they
are analyzed. In many instances it would be preferable to have a continuous real-
time reading so that problems could be identiﬁed as they occur and as close to
the source as possible. Microengineering technologies, by offering the opportu-
nity to perform many processes (i.e., sampling, sample preparation, reaction,
separation, detection, and identiﬁcation), are small compact systems providing a
potential solution to this problem.
7.3.2 BIOCHEMISTRY
Microengineering technologies offer other beneﬁts in addition to those listed
earlier. The modern drug development process is a very long and costly process.
Once a disease-causing agent or process has been identiﬁed, compounds that will
interfere speciﬁcally with that agent or process are sought. These are normally
small molecules because they need to be able to enter cells through their protective

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
outer membranes. The sources of these compounds are diverse; they may come
from plants, animals, bacteria, or may be found in existing chemical libraries.
Once a promising agent has been identiﬁed, it is used as a basis for generating
thousands of new chemicals that differ from each other only very slightly. This
is combinatorial chemistry. Essentially the same sequence of reactions is carried
out in an array of small wells on a titer plate, but each well receives a different
reagent to all the others at a predeﬁned step in the process.
Each of the new compounds is then tested for binding with the agent of
interest (or whatever may be appropriate) and tested on cells in culture. The most
promising ones are then tested on animals to see if the organism as a whole reacts
as desired (whole kidneys tend to react differently from kidney-derived cells in
a cell culture dish, for example). Finally, there are several sets of clinical trials
with human volunteers: to see if it is safe to give to humans, what quantities can
be given and then to determine if it works.
The early stages of this process, combichem and testing with cell culture, could
be speeded up by performing the reactions in parallel on a chip. There is also a
further problem that microengineered devices may be able to assist with — the
thousands of compounds that are not particularly useful on one occasion may turn
out to be of use in other situations, and therefore one would like to store them.
Long-term storage is normally performed at –20°C in special freezer units or in
liquid nitrogen. Storing titer plates this way is very costly, and microminiaturization
would enable more compounds to be stored in the same space.
7.3.3 BIOLOGY
The processes that occur in cells are elucidated through a number of different
approaches. Essentially, it is necessary to identify what compounds are interacting,
where these interactions take place within the cell, and at what point in the growth
division cycle the interactions take place. These approaches include: microscopy,
radioactive labeling, chromatography, and electrophoresis. Mass spectrometry can
be used to determine chemical composition, and because structure plays such a
signiﬁcant part in biological processes, it is desirable to determine what tertiary or
quaternary structure a protein (or nucleic acid) takes in a particular situation. For
this, x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are used.
7.3.3.1 Microscopy
Microengineering techniques have been used for some time to provide tips for
scanning probe microscopes (see Chapter 10). These include atomic force micro-
scopes (AFMs), which operate on the principle of attraction between the atoms
at the tip of the probe and the atoms in the sample, and scanning tunneling electron
microscopes (STEMs), in which the probe tip is brought so close to the sample
that an electron is able to vanish from the orbit of an atom in the probe tip and
reappear about the nucleus of an atom in the sample. These can, under the correct
circumstances, provide atomic-scale resolution. The STEM requires considerable
sample preparation, but the AFM can be used in wet biological environments.

One use of nanotechnology in microscopy is in the use of nanospheres (10 nm
or so in diameter). These are labeled with antibodies and used in sample preparation
for STEMs; the spheres congregate in areas rich in the molecules that the antibodies
preferentially bind to, and can be easily seen under the microscope.
A third form of the scanning probe microscope (SPM) is the scanning near-
ﬁeld optical microscope (SNOM). In this the probe tip is an optical ﬁber coated
with an opaque material. The tip is sharpened and a gap that is less than the
wavelength of the light illuminating the ﬁber is formed at the very end. Although
light cannot escape from this gap, a very small portion of the electromagnetic
ﬁeld projects beyond the physical end of the waveguide, and this can interact
with the material being studied. The position of the tip with respect to the sample
is controlled in a manner similar to that for the AFM tip, so it is possible to obtain
both topographical and some additional chemical information from this tool.
Although visible light microscopy is not capable of achieving the resolution
of electron microscopy or SPM, it should not be neglected. Many techniques
have been developed for the identiﬁcation and manipulation of cells and cell
components. Combined with ﬂuorescence labeling, light microscopy and image-
processing technologies can be used for a number of processes, such as cell
sorting. Fluorescence labeling is becoming increasingly useful. Firstly, small
ﬂuorescent molecules (such as rhodamine and ﬂuorescein) can be attached chem-
ically to larger molecules to identify them, hopefully without altering their activity.
Secondly, the small jellyﬁsh protein, green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP), and its
derivatives (cyan and yellow ﬂuorescent proteins) can now be genetically engi-
neered and combined with proteins of interest in the cell. Thus, it is possible to
locate the position of that protein quite precisely (within the limits of the reso-
lution of the microscope) within the cell. For this, the laser confocal microscope
is normally used. A laser beam is employed to illuminate the sample (and excite
ﬂuorescence), and a pinhole is used to ensure that only light that passes through
the focal point of the optical system passes through to the viewer. This enables
a three-dimensional view of the sample to be built up in slices.
Related to the confocal microscope is the laser tweezer. These use a laser
beam to manipulate very small (micron-scale) objects. These can be chemically
primed to investigate surfaces; but of interest to the microengineer is the fact that
the forces developed can be quite accurately predicted and, therefore, these tools
lend themselves to many other possible uses.
7.3.3.2
Radioactive Labeling
Radioactive labeling can be used in “pulse-chase” experiments to determine how
a particular compound is used by an organism. The compound is made up using
a radioactive isotope (usually one from 32P, 131I, 35S, 14C 45Ca, 3H, the number
being the atomic mass and not the atomic number), and a sample is given to the
organism at a particular time (thereafter it is supplied in the nonradioactive form
once more). By taking regular samples it is possible to follow the radioactive
molecules through the organism.

7.3.3.3
Chromatography
Coupled with the centrifuge, chromatography is one of the major workhorses of
modern biology. The centrifuge separates material by mass: it spins liquid samples
at very high speeds for long periods of time, following which the most dense
material accumulates at the bottom of the sample tube and the least dense accu-
mulates at the top. Chromatography separates liquid samples by passing them
through a column packed with something that slows down the passage of the
molecules (Figure 7.22). In the most simple form, larger molecules pass through
FIGURE 7.22 Principle of liquid chromatography: (a) a separation column is packed with
a material designed to retard passage of the compounds of interest; a detector on the outlet
enables samples to be diverted for collection and further work as they pass out of the
column; the separation is performed under a continuous ﬂow of solvent; (b) sample is
injected in a band at the top of the column; (c) different components (compounds) of the
sample separate out; (d) collection of band of interest.

the column more slowly because the packing material slows them down more
than it does the smaller molecules. By passing a “calibration” solution through
it, one can ﬁnd out how long it takes for a particular molecule to pass through
the column and, with this knowledge, determine if that molecule was present in
the sample. When identifying active chemicals in a mixture (e.g., identifying drug
candidates from plant extracts), each different band from the column can be
analyzed to see if it has the same effect as the mixture and, if so, further work
can be carried out to discover exactly what the chemical is.
Additionally, the packing material may be treated to slow down a particular
molecule. For instance, if one wishes to ﬁnd out what proteins bind to a particular
DNA sequence, then the inside of the column may be coated with DNA, and
proteins that bind to it will be delayed more than others.
The principal advantage of miniaturization is that of speed. High-pressure liquid
chromatography (HPLC) requires considerable time to run a single cycle, whereas
microstructure separations take seconds or minutes. HPLC also consumes consid-
erable volumes of ﬂuid, which may be especially signiﬁcant in biological circum-
stances in which the compound of interest is a relatively rare one within the cell.
Table 7.5 compares HPLC, capillary, and microstructure separations (normalized
to typical values found for microstructures [3]).
7.3.3.4 Electrophoresis
Electrophoresis extends chromatography; it separates not only by size of the mol-
ecule but also by electrical charge (Figure 7.23). In solution, polar elements of
macromolecules, such as hydroxide and carboxyl groups, dissociate so that the
molecule itself is left with an overall charge. When placed in an electric ﬁeld, the
molecule will migrate toward the electrode that carries the opposite charge. This
is usually performed with a gel to slow down and separate the molecules and is,
therefore, referred to as gel electrophoresis; other methods are mentioned later in
this chapter. Although several different types of electrophoresis have been devel-
oped, there are three additional points to note: Firstly, because many proteins are
folded up into relatively small volumes, they need to be unfolded (denatured) in
order for the separation to be effective. This is usually done by using a denaturing
agent such as the detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Secondly, some molecules,
such as different lengths of DNA, have the same charge-to-mass ratio regardless of

their actual length. In such cases, gel electrophoretic separation proceeds purely on
the basis of molecular mass. Finally, two-dimensional separation can be performed.
The sample is ﬁrst placed in a pH gradient from very acidic to very alkaline, and
an electric ﬁeld is applied. Molecules will migrate until they reach the pH at which
they have no overall charge. Then an electric ﬁeld is applied in the opposite
direction, and the molecules are separated on the basis of mass.
Again, the advantages of microengineering are in improved speed, reduced
reagent and sample volumes, and greater accuracy. Reduced dimensions mean
that it is possible to apply higher electric ﬁelds (heating by electric current being
one limiting factor) with smaller absolute voltages (tens, as opposed to thousands,
of volts).
7.3.3.5
Mass Spectrometry
Different mass spectrometry (MS) techniques have been developed to identify
chemical compounds. The puriﬁed sample is introduced into the instrument, broken
up into pieces, and ionized. The ions are then accelerated through an electric ﬁeld
and through a magnetic ﬁeld, which causes their path to curve. The degree of
curvature of their path will depend on the momentum (and therefore the mass of
the fragment) and the charge. A detector is used to identify the landing sites of
different fragments, and a fragmentation pattern can be built up. Although fragmen-
tation is random, careful analysis will reveal the chemical composition and primary
structure of the compound. Obviously, portable mass spectrometers would be of
immense use in industry and in military and civil defense applications (to identify
and give warning of the use of chemical and biological weapons, for example).
7.3.3.6
X-Ray Crystallography and NMR
The arrangement of atoms in a crystal acts as a diffraction grating for x-rays.
Shining x-rays through a crystal formed by a particular protein, therefore, creates
a particular interference pattern that can be used to determine the tertiary (or even
quaternary) structure. The disadvantages of x-ray crystallography are that it is
very difﬁcult to produce protein crystals, and it is not possible to observe the
FIGURE 7.23 Principle of electrophoresis. Positively charged molecules move towards
the negative electrode (cathode). Negatively charged molecules move towards the positive
electrode (anode). Uncharged molecules are unaffected. Highly charged molecules move
more rapidly than those with lower charge. Small molecules will move faster than large
molecules (depending on the retarding medium and whether or not the molecule is dena-
tured or folded compactly).

proteins changing shape to perform speciﬁc tasks. Nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) offers an alternative approach.
In NMR, the sample is held in a very powerful magnetic ﬁeld, and radio waves
are used to ﬂip the spins of the nuclei in the sample. As they return to their rest state
they give off a characteristic signal. This signal is inﬂuenced by the bonding situation
in which the atom ﬁnds itself. The structure of the molecule can then be determined.
NMR also has some disadvantages and problems. NMR can be used in a simpler
mode as a molecular detector and, as such, could be useful in µTAS.
7.3.3.7 Other Processes and Advantages
Many of the processes involved in understanding cells incorporate the use of bio-
logical molecules (as opposed to molecules speciﬁcally designed and synthesized
by humans). In research terms, it may well be desirable to try and reproduce and
control the microenvironments in which studies take place on the same size scale.
Other processes, such as the famous polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which
copies lengths of DNA, require thermal cycling. Miniaturization decreases the
thermal mass that must be cycled and, hence, the time required for the reaction
to be completed.
7.4 MICRO TOTAL ANALYSIS SYSTEMS
At the start of this chapter, Figure 7.1 introduced the concept of an integrated
microengineered chemical analysis system. Part I of this book introduced the
fabrication techniques by which various elements — channels, valves, microme-
chanical pumps, and mixers — could be constructed. Chapter 5 and Chapter 6
showed how these elements could be combined and actuated or formed into
sensors. This section, therefore, will focus on the principal techniques used for
moving chemicals in solution around miroﬂuidic chips and performing separa-
tions — electroosmosis and electrophoresis — and the detection of results.
7.4.1 MICROFLUIDIC CHIPS
Figure 7.24 shows a simpliﬁed diagram of a microﬂuidic chip used for performing
separations. The device has at least four ports, one for the carrier ﬂuid (buffer)
that will initially be used to ﬁll all the channels on the chip, two for the sample,
and one as a waste outlet at the end of the separation channel. If the collection
of particular components (fractions) is required, following separation, there may
be more than one outlet following the separation channel so that the required
fraction can be directed to a speciﬁc outlet. The other principal elements are the
sample injector, separation channel, and detector. Each port needs to be connected
to a reservoir and an electrode that can be switched to control the ﬂuid ﬂow
through the channels for separation. 
The chips themselves have typically been fabricated by HF etching of quartz
glass to form channels. Holes are drilled in a second layer of glass to provide
inlet and outlet ports, and this is bonded on top to seal the channels. Glass has

several advantages: the machining processes are well known, it is possible to
optically observe progress (ﬂuorescence labeling has been a popular method of
detection) and to monitor ﬁlling to ensure that there are no air bubbles or obstruc-
tions in the channels, and it presents the correct conditions for the formation of
electroosmotic ﬂow. It is also chemically relatively inert.
Glass is, however, relatively expensive, and polymers, including PDMS, have
been used.
7.4.2 LAMINAR FLOW AND SURFACE TENSION
Two characteristics that have to be considered when designing microﬂuidic chips
are that ﬂow is almost exclusively laminar and that surface tension plays a more
signiﬁcant role than in larger systems.
Laminar ﬂow means that turbulent mixing does not occur. Therefore, a variety
of mixers have been devised that divide the ﬂow from a single channel into
multiple ﬂows and interleave these with a similarly divided ﬂow from a second
channel. Various approaches have been used, such as wide channels ﬁlled with
regularly spaced pillars that divide and redivide the ﬂow (Figure 7.25). Thereafter,
diffusion of molecules completes the process. 
FIGURE 7.24 Typical layout of channels on a microﬂuidic chip. A carrier solvent is used
to prime the column (separation channel, which is typically millimeters in length). The
ﬂow in the column can be halted by diverting the ﬂow of carrier to the carrier waste outlet.
To inject the sample, carrier ﬂow is directed to carrier waste and sample ﬂow is directed
between the inlet and sample waste; the intersection of sample and separation channels
form an injector, which enables a precisely deﬁned plug of sample to be injected into the
column. For separation, the sample ﬂow is stopped and ﬂow in the column is resumed.

Surface tension has caused problems, for instance, in ﬁlling microﬂuidic
channels, but it has also been used to advantage in schemes whereby the direction
of ﬂuid ﬂow is controlled by controlling surface tension. Valves have also been
formed by introducing restrictions into channels; once the leading surface of the
ﬂuid reaches the restriction, additional pressure must be applied to force it past
the restriction.
7.4.3 ELECTROOSMOTIC FLOW
Fluids can be relatively easily moved through microchannels by electroosmotic
ﬂow. Figure 7.26 illustrates a channel into which an aqueous solution has been
introduced. Negative surface charges on the walls of the channel attract small
ions from the solution. Applying an electric ﬁeld across the channel causes the
small ions to move towards the negative electrode (cathode). This motion drags
the rest of the ﬂuid in the channel toward the cathode. This is known as elec-
troosmotic ﬂow.
The sample to be analyzed is introduced into the channel at the opposite
end to the cathode. This will contain neutral particles (molecules) as well as
positively and negatively charged particles. Neutral particles will progress
through the channel at the same rate as the bulk liquid ﬂow and will only be
retarded by mechanical (i.e., ﬂuidic) effects. Positively charged particles will
be attracted towards the cathode and so will generally move faster than the bulk
buffer solution, whereas negatively charged particles will be retarded because
they are attracted toward the positive end of the channel (the anode); however,
they will still end up at the cathode as they cannot resist the bulk ﬂow of the
buffer solution.
FIGURE 7.26 Principle of electroosmotic ﬂow in a glass microchannel. A negative surface
charge on the glass attracts small positive ions in solution to the edges of the channel.
Applying a potential difference across the channel causes these to move towards the
cathode, dragging the rest of the ﬂuid in the channel with them.

7.4.4 SAMPLE INJECTION
Having ﬁlled the channels with buffer solution, a plug of sample must be intro-
duced into the separation channel. In glass chips, electroosmotic ﬂow is toward
the cathode, so ﬂow through the chip is controlled by switching the electrodes
between 0 V and a negative voltage. (If ports are left without being connected to
an electrode, there will be no electroosmotic ﬂow toward them.)
Figure 7.27 illustrates two common injection geometries: the cross and the
twin T; the latter design enables the plug size to be controlled independent of
channel width. The procedure is the same for both geometries. The buffer inlet
port and separation waste port are left unconnected, and a negative voltage is
applied between the sample inlet port (0 V) and sample waste port (−V). The
channel between the two sample ports, and the injector, ﬁll with the sample
solution. The voltage is then switched so that the buffer port is most positive (0 V)
and the other ports are negative. The sample plug will thus propagate along the
separation channel, and the buffer will ﬂow toward the sample ports to prevent
additional sample from ﬁlling the separation channel.
Controlling the sample plug size and ensuring consistent injection is crucial
to obtaining consistent and repeatable results.
7.4.5 MICROCHANNEL ELECTROPHORESIS
The force acting on a charged particle (charge q C) in an electric ﬁeld (E V/m)
is given by Equation 7.12:
(7.12)
FIGURE 7.27 Sample injector geometries: (a) cross, (b) twin T. The shaded area indicates
the shape of the sample plug.
Surface Charge Formation
This is dependant on the ionization of chemical groups on the surface of the
channel walls. In the case of quartz glass (SiO2), it is silanol (SiOH) that is
ionized at pH values above about 2. Different materials will have different
surface chemistries, and the pH or composition of the buffer solution may
have to be adjusted to enable electroosmotic ﬂow to take place.

When the frictional forces retarding the particle (i.e., coefﬁcient of friction f
multiplied by the velocity of the particle) equal the force due to the electric ﬁeld,
then the particle will move with constant velocity. This can be rearranged to give
the velocity:
(7.13)
This can be written as:
  
(7.14)
where µep is the electrophoretic mobility of that particle. Given that f for a
spherical particle (of radius r and η as the viscosity of the buffer solution) is
given by:
(7.15)
The mass of the same particle of density ρ is:
(7.16)
It can be seen that f is proportional to mass, and the electrophoretic mobility
is, therefore, proportional to the charge-to-mass ratio:
(7.17)
In the case of microchannel separations, the mobility µ of the particle is the
sum of both the electrophoretic mobility and the electroosmotic mobility (i.e.,
the motion due to electroosmotic ﬂow). The electroosmotic mobility is dependent
on the zeta potential ζ of the surface in addition to the dielectric constant and
viscosity of the buffer solution.
The principle of the separation process, then, is to separate two (or more)
compounds with different mobilities; the length of the channel needs to be chosen
such that one reaches the detector at the end of the separation channel before the
other.
The resolution of the system needs to be such that the detector can distin-
guish between concentration peaks in the compounds of interest when they
reach the end of the separation channel. As shown in Figure 7.28, a rectangular
plug of a single compound will have spread out by the time it reaches the
detector into a peak with variance σ2. The total variance is a combination of

that due to the sample injector (no plug will be a perfect rectangle), diffusion
during separation, and the detector (even if there was a perfect plug, the detector
may not be perfect).
It is common to compare the efﬁciency of sample separation using the number
of theoretical plates, N:
(7.18)
The theoretical resolution (i.e., the number of different peaks that can be
distinguished) of the system can be found:
(7.19)
Here ta and tb are retention times for the slowest and fastest moving compo-
nents of the sample, respectively. The retention time is the time spent in the
separation channel before reaching the detector, and can be calculated from the
channel length and velocity (see Equation 7.14).
Close examination of Equation 7.19 will show that the electric ﬁeld strength
E does not appear to affect the resolution. There are, however, two factors that
suggest that a high value of E would be desirable. Firstly, the longer the sample
remains in the channel, the more it will diffuse: the variance will increase and,
hence, N will decrease. Secondly, a fast separation time is required. This is given
by:
(7.20)
This implies that a high value of E is desirable. Note that decreasing L will
lead to a proportional decrease in resolution (Equation 7.18 and Equation 7.19).
The length of the column is limited by the residence time: the longer the
column, the longer it will be before the sample passes the detector, resulting in
a slower experiment and greater chance of band broadening due to diffusion

effects. This can be compensated for by increasing the electric ﬁeld strength, the
basic limitation of this being the heating caused by the ﬂow of electric current
through the buffer in the channel. This has two effects: it will cause band broad-
ening by increasing diffusion and in an extreme situation may denature or damage
the biological molecules being separated.
The column can be treated as resistive and the power associated with a resistor
(R ohms) is:

(See Chapter 11 for additional information.) If the channel has a cross-
sectional area of A and the buffer medium has a resistivity of 1/k (k being the
conductivity), then R is:
(7.22)
and the heat energy developed (power multiplied by time) is:
(7.23)
Further work reveals that the energy per unit volume is directly proportional
to the square of the electrical ﬁeld strength:
(7.24)
This is balanced by the heat dissipated along the length of the channel, which
is proportional to the surface area of the channel. Here, miniaturization shows
another advantage, i.e., as longitudinal dimensions are reduced, volume will
reduce proportionally to the cube and surface area reduces with the square of this
reduction. So, as noted before, the surface-area-to-volume ratio increases and the
channel is cooled much more efﬁciently. However, the exact nature of this cooling
depends on the geometry of the channel and the materials of construction. None-
theless, it seems that ﬁelds of 200 to 300 kV/m can be achieved in such structures.
Once again, glass is ideal for this because of its excellent dielectric properties
and good thermal conductivity. Polymers, although cheaper, have lower thermal
conductivities, whereas materials with higher thermal conductivities (such as
silicon) suffer from high electrical conductivities or dielectric breakdown of thin
insulating layers.

7.4.6 DETECTION
In order to complete the analysis of a sample, it is necessary to detect the
individual components as they leave the separation channel. This section will
introduce some of the approaches that have been tried and comment on their
advantages and disadvantages.
7.4.6.1 Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF)
This is a highly sensitive detection technique, capable of detecting levels down
to a few thousand molecules. The approach relies on the compounds of interest
ﬂuorescing when exposed to laser irradiation. Some compounds are naturally
ﬂuorescent, but the majority will need to be made ﬂuorescent by a derivatization
reaction performed either before the sample is introduced into the separation
channel (precolumn) or after separation (postcolumn).
The basic system is shown in Figure 7.29. The laser beam is placed at right
angles to the microscope objective that is used to collect the induced ﬂuorescence
and focus it onto the detector. This may be either an avalanche photodiode or a
photomultiplier tube; the latter is bulky and expensive and does not generally
lend itself for use in portable equipment, but it is more sensitive and has wider
spectral sensitivity.
7.4.6.1.1 Derivatization
In order to make compounds ﬂuoresce, it is necessary to label them with small
ﬂuorescent molecules; these are chosen to react with functional groups on the
molecules of interest. This will invariably lead to the sample becoming contam-
inated with unreacted labels; it is necessary to ensure that the peak caused by
this at the detector is well separated from those of interest or, if possible, that a
label is selected that does not ﬂuoresce in its unreacted state. Some labeling
compounds for peptides can be found in Table 7.6 [1].
7.4.6.1.2
Advantages and Disadvantages of LIF Detection
The main advantage of this approach is that it is very sensitive, and furthermore,
it can be reliably performed with readily available equipment and reagents. The
main problem one is likely to encounter with micromachined devices is back-
ground ﬂuorescence of the materials employed (quartz, for example).
If the goal is to produce portable instrumentation, however, this approach
does not readily lend itself to miniaturization of the detector. The need to label
FIGURE 7.29 LIF system. The ﬂuorescence signal is focused by a microscope objective
onto the detector; this may be an avalanche photodiode or a photomultiplier tube.

complicates the system, and it may also cause problems in some applications:
labeled proteins are chemically different from unlabeled, and this may be a
particular problem if it is necessary to collect fractions from the column and
analyze their activity or composition.
7.4.6.2
Ultraviolet (UV) Absorbance
The quantity of double-stranded DNA in a solution is typically determined by
measuring the absorption of UV light at 260-nm wavelength. An optical density
(OD) of 0.1 over a path length of 1 cm (that is commonly used in standard
equipment) corresponds to a concentration of 5 µg/ml of double-stranded DNA.
The OD can be computed from Equation 7.25:
(7.25)
where e is the extinction coefﬁcient (20 for 1-mg/ml nucleic acid solutions over
a 1-cm path length), C is the concentration of the sample (mg/ml), and l is the
optical path length (cm). Proteins also absorb UV light at 260 nm with an
extinction coefﬁcient of approximately 0.57.
7.4.6.2.1
Advantages and Disadvantages of UV Absorption
This method requires simpler equipment than LIF, and UV diodes are starting
to become available, which may well ease integration problems. It is, however,
fairly nonspeciﬁc in what it detects; single- and double-stranded nucleic acids
can be confused, and RNA and proteins absorb UV light as well as DNA —
although by measuring absorption at 280 nm as well as 260 nm, contamination
can be detected. Also, the materials used are limited to those that can transmit

UV light — speciﬁcally, quartz glass. Nonetheless, it is a well-established mac-
roscale technique.
7.4.6.3
Electrochemical Detection
An electrode positioned in an aqueous chemical solution can supply or remove
electrons from compounds in its vicinity depending on its potential relative to
that of the aqueous solution. This can be represented symbolically for an arbitrary
compound M by the following chemical equation:
(7.26)
The removal of electrons (i.e., going from the left to the right of the equation)
is termed oxidation, whereas the addition of electrons (going from right to left)
is termed reduction. Supplying or removing electrons artiﬁcially via an electrode
will push the equilibrium to the right- or left-hand side of the equation. At some
point, the equation will balance, the concentration of both the oxidized and
reduced forms being equal. The electrode potential required to achieve this is
known as the redox potential. This will be different depending on the compounds
involved and, therefore, gives a way of detecting not only the presence of a
compound but also some indication as to what it may be.
A common arrangement for making redox potential measurements is shown
in Figure 7.30. Standard redox potentials can be found tabulated in data books.
These are measured with reference to a standard hydrogen electrode (which has
been deﬁned as having a redox potential of 0). Most measurements are, however,
made with respect to a saturated calomel electrode (potential of +0.244 V). These
mercury-based electrodes are chosen because it is relatively easy to create a stable
cell on a macroscale. For micromachined devices, carbon thin-ﬁlm electrodes are
popular for making such measurements because they are relatively inert. Chlo-
FIGURE 7.30 Apparatus for measuring redox potential. The reference electrode system
will be hydrogen or saturated calomel (mercury). The test electrode material is immersed
in a solution containing a known concentration of its ions (1 M). The potassium chloride
(KCl) bridge that completes the electrical circuit can also be referred to as a salt bridge.

rided silver electrodes can be used as reference electrodes, although they will not
necessarily remain stable over long periods of time or great current ranges. Noble
metals (gold, iridium, and platinum) do not, on their own, make good electrodes
for this application. Although they are inert under most circumstances, they suffer
from a baseline drift that is very difﬁcult to control.
7.4.6.3.1
Cyclic Voltammetry
Cyclic voltammetry is a common technique for making electrochemical mea-
surements. It requires a working electrode and a reference electrode, typically
connected to the test solution by a salt bridge. Although this can be difﬁcult to
arrange formally in a microengineered device, the fact that the ﬂow is laminar
can be useful when designing a channel arrangement in which, for example, part
of the chip containing a reference solution needs to be electrically connected to
another part without the solutions mixing. In a microengineered device, the
working electrode will typically be of carbon.
The current passing across the working electrode is monitored. Initially
the electrode is held at a potential at which no current ﬂows; in other words,
no electrons are being taken from or donated to the compounds in solution.
The potential of the working electrode is then increased with a corresponding
increase in current as the compounds in solution are oxidized. As the redox
point is reached, there is a large increase in the current to a peak. At some
predetermined point, the potential is reversed and an inverted pattern can be
seen (Figure 7.31).
Only compounds near the electrode can be oxidized or reduced, and the
curve obtained depends on local concentrations of the various species involved
and how they diffuse toward or away from the electrode. This is particularly
true when microelectrodes are used, and this enables some measurements to
be made that are related to the diffusion of the species involved toward and
away from the electrode. By scanning the voltage at different rates, smaller
(slower) or larger (faster) maximum peaks will become apparent, and a set of
scan curves can be obtained (note that with the sample plug passing the

electrode quite rapidly, the implementation and calibration of such a system
requires some thought).
This assumes that the reaction is completely reversible and diffusion limited.
This may not be true if one component becomes involved in a chemical reaction
once it has been oxidized or reduced nor will it be true if gas evolves in the
system — in fact, gas bubbles are a major problem in any microﬂuidic system.
Obviously, gas will be evolved if the water is electrolyzed into its component
parts, hydrogen and oxygen. This will occur at above 0.8 V, so measurements
will have to be made below this point.
7.4.6.3.2 Advantages and Disadvantages
of Cyclic Voltammetry
Cyclic voltammetry has several advantages; it provides considerable information
regarding the composition of a band as it exits the separation column and the
procedure is well established on the macroscopic scale. It is not as sensitive as
LIF, with detection levels down to about 10−10 mol (1 mol is 6.02 × 1023 atoms
or molecules). One signiﬁcant disadvantage, however, is that it can be difﬁcult
to perform electrochemical analysis in a high electric ﬁeld, and device design
must take this into account.
7.4.6.4 Radioactive Labeling
As discussed in Subsection 7.3.3, it is possible to label biological molecules of
interest by introducing radioactive isotopes. The results can be detected by placing
a radiation detector at the outlet of the column or even by dispensing the outlet
of the column into wells on a microtiter plate coupled with radiation-sensitive
ﬁlm.
The results of such experiments can be quite illuminating, but the associated
radiation hazards usually restrict their use.
7.4.6.5 Mass Spectrometry
The basic principles of MS were introduced in Subsection 7.3.3.5 of this chapter.
The MS has four components, an ionizer, an electric ﬁeld to accelerate the ions,
a mass ﬁlter, and a (charge) detector. Electrospray ionization appears to be the
most compatible one with microﬂuidic techniques, and has been developed in
integrated form as well as for use with capillary electrophoresis systems. One of
the mass ﬁlter systems that appears to be amenable to miniaturization is the
quadrupole mass ﬁlter (Figure 7.32).
Electrospray ionization is achieved by pumping the sample through a very
narrow (sub-10-µm diameter) glass needle into the vacuum of an MS instrument.
An electrode (provided in Figure 7.32 by a stainless steel coupler) applies an
appropriate voltage (usually in the kV range) to ionize and accelerate the com-
ponents of the sample. In a microﬂuidic system, the sample could be pumped by
the electroosmotic ﬂow of the separation channel.

195
The quadrupole mass ﬁlter is arranged such that the ionized components of
the sample have to traverse a distance surrounded by four electrodes before they
arrive at the detector. An alternating voltage of variable amplitude and frequency
is applied to these electrodes such that the ions follow a spiral trajectory. In this
way, the components of the ionized sample can be separated on the basis of
charge and mass.
7.4.6.6
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
Microcoils designed to act as transceivers for NMR can be integrated onto the
microﬂuidic separation system. To date, the additional paraphernalia required for
NMR systems, the magnetic ﬁeld generators in particular, have limited its use.
It does, however, appear that there may be advantages to be gained by miniatur-
izing NMR systems [2], so further development may be expected.
7.4.6.7
Other Sensors
It should be noted that, in addition to the detection systems discussed earlier,
other sensors discussed elsewhere in this volume can be, and have been, suc-
cessfully employed in microengineered chemical, biochemical, and biological
analysis systems. These include simple electrical conductivity sensors, pH sen-
sors, and ISFET sensors. The use of hot-wire sensors or mass-ﬂow-rate sensors
in gas chromatography systems should not be neglected (a pulse of gas with
different thermal properties from that of the carrier gas will affect the sensor
reading as it passes).

7.5 DNA CHIPS
As discussed in Subsection 7.2.3.2, genetic information in the cell is encoded by
the sequence of bases in DNA. In some inherited (genetic) diseases, the disease is
caused by a single base change in a particular strand of DNA; however, it should
be noted that many genetic disorders arise from complex interactions between many
genes. Similarly, certain drugs may be more effective on some people owing to a
genetic predisposition but may be ineffective or even poisonous to others. For these,
and many other reasons, it is desirable to probe the DNA of an individual. Also
noted in Subsection 7.2.3.2 was the fact that bases pair up by forming hydrogen
bonds, giving rise to the well-known double-helical form of DNA. However,
because these hydrogen bonds are relatively weak, double-stranded DNA can be
made to break up into the single-stranded form simply by elevating the temperature
to above its so-called melting point temperature (98°C). When the DNA solution
is cooled, the single-stranded DNA molecules pair up again.
This provides the possibility of probing short strands of DNA to determine
their sequence: the DNA of interest is broken up into short fragments, using
restriction enzymes (see box). One end of each fragment is labeled with a
ﬂuorescent molecule. The DNA is then washed over a chip that has thousands
of spots on it, each with a different DNA sequence. Because the sequence of each
spot is known, the pattern of ﬂuorescence on the chip can be read off using an
automated reader to determine the sequence in the original DNA sample.
7.5.1 DNA CHIP FABRICATION
DNA chips are usually created on a quartz substrate. The surface of quartz, when
washed, is covered with OH groups. Silane linker molecules can be attached to
this, and large biomolecules (including DNA) can then be attached chemically.
Several approaches have been employed in the fabrication of DNA chips.
The simplest is “spotting,” which takes various forms. DNA sequences are syn-
thesized and applied by some mechanical means to different areas of the chip. A
more sophisticated approach is to use a ink-jet printer type of mechanism to
deliver one of the four bases to each spot across the array, and then link it
chemically to the previous base before printing on another layer.
Another approach successfully employed by one of the ﬁrst commercial ﬁrms
to sell DNA chips is based on photolithography. The linkers on the quartz substrate
and the bases used to synthesize the DNA strands are capped with a photocleavable
Restriction Enzymes
These are catalytic proteins that cut DNA strands at particular points deﬁned
by the local sequence of bases, whose number is usually no more than half a
dozen. Thus, it is possible to cut DNA up into short lengths and to also know
the sequence at the end of each length (because this will depend on the
restriction enzyme used).

protector. The entire chip is exposed to UV light through a mask, which deﬁnes
where the protective chemical cap will be removed, a base is added, and the
procedure is repeated for each of the other three bases.
7.6 THE POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR)
One of the primary functions of the cell is to copy DNA; once the copy has been
made, the cell can reproduce by dividing. Copying DNA is performed by a protein
machine called DNA polymerase. When given a long single strand of DNA with a
short primer hybridized to one end, the polymerase will ﬁnd where the primer ends
and then work its way along the single strand, building a mirror image of the strand
(C being matched by G and A by T) so that a length of double-stranded DNA results.
In order to investigate DNA, it is useful to have a large quantity of it.
Fortunately, it can be ampliﬁed by a procedure known as the PCR, which, because
of its usefulness in molecular biology, is also a popular target process for min-
iaturization. The procedure is as follows:
1. The DNA of interest is puriﬁed and broken up by restriction enzymes
so that the sequences at the 3 and 5 ends are known.
2. Short primer lengths of DNA are made for the 3 ends. (If the interest
is in a section of DNA that starts with a particular sequence, then the
primer for this sequence can be made.) These are added in excess of
the DNA solution.
3. A polymerase that can survive high temperatures without denaturing
(losing its shape and hence its functionality) is added to the solution
in excess, as are the phosphorylated forms of the four bases.
4. The double-stranded DNA is melted (heated to 98°C).
5. The sample is allowed to cool to about 60°C, at which point the primers
hybridize with the DNA (due to their being in excess), and the poly-
merase gets to work.
6. The polymerase proceeds from the 3 to 5 end, leaving twice the amount
of double-stranded DNA as was originally in the solution.
7. The sequence from item 4 onwards is repeated as often as necessary.
Speed is one of the beneﬁts of miniaturization. In large-scale systems, sample
tubes are placed in machined aluminum blocks, which are temperature cycled.
The heating and cooling cycle of such large thermal masses limits the speed with
which the procedure can be carried out.
7.7 CONDUCTING POLYMERS AND HYDROGELS
These are unusual components of MEMS; brief comments have been included
in this chapter because it is useful to present them in a context with chemistry
and wet (i.e., ﬂuidic) MEMS.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
7.7.1 CONDUCTING POLYMERS
Polypyrroles (Figure 7.33) have been known as electrically conducting poly-
mers for some years now. They are formed of long chains of pentagon-shaped
units comprised of four carbon atoms and one nitrogen atom, and are electri-
cally conducting because electrons can drift from one ring to the next along
the chain.
Electrically conducting polymers are of interest in themselves, especially
because they can be doped to make them semiconducting; plastic integrated
circuits would be even cheaper than silicon ones, and ﬂexible circuits would also
have many applications. One major application has been in organic light-emitting
diodes (OLEDs), which are used to backlight the LCD displays of modern
portable devices such as cell phones.
Electrically conducting polymers can be electroplated onto electrodes, and if
electroplated from a solution containing other organic molecules, these will
become trapped in the electrode matrix. In this way a variety of biosensors can
be produced.
They have also been used as microactuators. In ionic solutions, ions can be
attracted into the polymer matrix or ejected from it by applying an appropriate
electrical bias. This can cause the polymer to contract or expand slightly. This,
coupled with selective deposition by electroplating, makes them suitable in some
mechanical actuation applications.
7.7.2 HYDROGELS
Hydrogels are more effective as actuators than conducting polymers because they
exhibit large variations in dimensions in response to various environmental fac-
tors, including pH and electric ﬁelds. Hydrogels are polymer matrices with
functional groups attached to the component monomers such that the polymer
would normally be soluble in water. The chains are cross-linked to prevent the
matrix from dissolving when immersed in water. Techniques have been developed
to photolithographically pattern hydrogels, and a variety of applications are being
explored at the time of writing.

8 Integrated Optics
8.1 INTRODUCTION
Modern communications systems rely on ﬁber optic connections, and optical
components can be found in many consumer products (CD and DVD players,
digital cameras, etc.). There are many beneﬁts to be gained by the miniaturization
of optical components where possible, not only in terms of power reduction and
miniaturization. Switching of high-speed optical data channels is still commonly
performed by electronic circuits. This means that the signal has to be converted
from light in a ﬁber to an electronic signal, then back, and relaunched down
another ﬁber. Because electronic circuits operate at data rates lower than those
possible with optical data transmissions, this represents a communications bot-
tleneck. Similarly, many industrial computer systems and data processing systems
are composed of a number of circuit boards plugged into a backplane, a data bus
that enables different elements of the system to communicate with each other. It
is difﬁcult to maintain the integrity of electronic signals over even relatively short
distances (10 cm) as frequencies rise above about 100 MHz. Such buses, therefore,
represent a data processing bottleneck.
Movement toward all optical systems, therefore, is a subject of considerable
importance. The subject of integrated optics is, consequently, quite large. This
section, then, rather than attempting to deal with the entire topic, will be limited
to a brief exploration of some applications of MEMS in solving optical problems.
8.2 WAVEGUIDES
In optical communications systems, light is conducted by ﬁber waveguides. In
integrated optical systems, these are usually planar waveguides fabricated on a
silicon substrate. Both use the same physical processes to conﬁne and guide light,
although the overall structures are different.
8.2.1 OPTICAL FIBER WAVEGUIDES
The basic structure of an optical ﬁber is shown in Figure 8.1. These are cylindrical
structures and consist of two parts: core and cladding. The refractive indices of
the core and cladding are engineered to ensure that light entering the ﬁber at one
end undergoes total internal reﬂection so that it arrives at the far end (Figure 8.2),
rather than escaping from the ﬁber at the ﬁrst opportunity. Fibers are normally
made from quartz glass (silicon dioxide), although polymer ﬁbers are available.
The core of the ﬁber is normally between 3 µm and 200 µm in diameter, within
a ﬁber of 140 µm to 400 µm diameter.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
Fibers are normally provided with additional protective sleeving. To make a
connection between two ﬁbers (splice the ﬁbers), the outer protective sheath has
to be stripped off, the ﬁbers cleaved cleanly at right angles, and the two cores
aligned. Even slight misalignment can cause considerable loss of signal, and this
is one area in which microsystems have been deployed: micromanipulation and
alignment of optical ﬁbers for splicing.
There are two different kinds of ﬁber, single mode and multimode. Single-
mode ﬁbers have thin cores, usually less than 10 µm in diameter, and light can
propagate through them via only one direct path (Figure 8.3a). In multimode
ﬁbers, light can propagate by many paths (Figure 8.3b and Figure 8.3c); the
difference between the two ﬁber types is that multimode propagation tends to
lead to less signal attenuation (diminution with distance) but more signal broad-
ening (because different parts arrive at the end of the ﬁber at slightly different
times), which results in lower data rates. This can also be a problem if particular
properties of the signal (polarization, for instance) are important.
There are a further two classiﬁcations to be made for ﬁbers, depending on the
proﬁle of the refractive index change between the core and cladding. This can be
either a step change, or a graded change. Figure 8.3b and Figure 8.3c show how
this affects propagation in multimode ﬁbers. 
Optical ﬁbers convey signals with optimal efﬁciency in the infrared region
at wavelengths of about 850 nm, 1300 nm, and 1550 nm. 
8.2.1.1 Fabrication of Optical Fibers
The fabrication of glass optical ﬁbers is instructive, because the small dimensions
observed are achieved without micromachining. The basic setup is shown in
FIGURE 8.1 An optical ﬁber waveguide (cross section) consists of a core of 3–200 µm
and cladding that form a ﬁber of 140–400 µm diameter. The ﬁber is usually coated with
a protective plastic sheath (indicated).
FIGURE 8.2 Total internal reﬂection. The refractive indices of the core and cladding are
controlled such that light entering the core will not escape into the cladding; it will be
internally refracted (bent back into the core).

Figure 8.4. A quartz tube, a few centimeters in diameter and about 1 m long, is
mounted between two rotating chucks. Holes in the chucks allow gas to be passed
through the tube, and it is heated to an even temperature by a gas burner. 
Refractive index variation is achieved by passing a gas through the tube and
doping the inner walls. Once the desired level and depth of impurities have been
achieved, the tube is evacuated so that it collapses in on itself. It is then drawn
into a ﬁber on a tower-like structure.
FIGURE 8.3 Propagation in: (a) single-mode ﬁber, (b) multimode, step index, (c) multi-
mode, graded index. Monochromatic light can only take one path along a single-mode
ﬁber, but can take multiple paths along a multimode ﬁber. It is easier to couple signals
into a multimode ﬁber, but the multiple paths are of different lengths, so a pulse is more
spread out when it arrives at the end of the ﬁber.

8.2.2 PLANAR WAVEGUIDES
The theory behind planar waveguides is the same as that behind ﬁber waveguides:
conﬁning light between two areas of different refractive index. There are three basic
approaches that can be used to produce planar waveguides (Figure 8.5).
The ﬁrst approach (Figure 8.5a) is to duplicate the structure of the ﬁber
waveguide. In this case, the core is of nitride and the cladding of oxide, although
these are not the best materials to use, especially, if the ﬁlms have high levels of
hydrogen contamination. The second (Figure 8.5b) is a more basic rib waveguide;
again the signal travels through the nitride (or other) core.
Figure 8.5c illustrates a strained silicon waveguide. Here, the change in the
refractive index is caused by inducing mechanical strain in the silicon crystal lattice.
This is possible because silicon is transparent to infrared light.
All three approaches and variations are under investigation and, in some cases,
in use, although most of them involve materials more exotic than oxide and nitride
at present.
8.3 INTEGRATED OPTICS COMPONENTS
It is possible to combine planar waveguides with photonic crystals for several
applications and in different combinations. These include the production of the
following:
• Bends
• Splitters (Figure 8.6)
• Couplers
• Wavelength division multiplexers
• Polarizers
• Optical switches
The optical source used is commonly the laser diode. Although work is in progress

these are still generally produced using gallium–arsenide (GaAs) semiconductor
technology. For this reason, they normally have to be purchased as separate dies
and mounted onto the integrated optics structure. High-power laser diodes also
need cooling as they are only about 30% efﬁcient.
8.4
FIBER COUPLING
Because integrated optical systems are frequently intended to be interfaced with
ﬁbers, it is necessary to ensure accurate alignment between the ﬁber and the planar
waveguides on the structure. The usual approach to this is the use of V grooves or
trenches etched to accommodate the ﬁbers. These can be enhanced by the use of
ball lenses, which are readily available optical components. Figure 8.7 shows one
structure; note the additional trenches etched for glue overﬂow during bonding. 
8.5
OTHER APPLICATIONS
8.5.1 LENSES
A variety of micromachining technologies can be used to construct an array of
lenses for use in optical systems. The most straightforward approach is to deposit
and pattern a ﬁlm of material to leave a number of islands. These are then heated

to reﬂow them, and depending on the nature of the material, these will form balls
or, simply, more gently sloping lenses because of surface tension. A new devel-
opment has been the incorporation of liquids into deformable structures to create
lenses that can be focused to different distances.
8.5.2 DISPLAYS
Digital mirror displays have been developed and commercially exploited. There
are several approaches by which structures similar to that shown in Figure 8.8
(generally using surface micromachining techniques). Aluminum ﬁlms make very
efﬁcient mirrors.
The structure shown in Figure 8.8 can be deﬂected electrostatically, thus
deﬂecting the path of any light impinging upon it. By combining arrays of such
micromirrors, it is possible to create large, bright digital display projectors. The
advantage of using mirrors is that high-intensity illumination can be used; this is
a limitation for projectors that use more common LCD technology.
8.5.3 FIBER-OPTIC CROSS-POINT SWITCHES
Optical communications often require the switching of a signal from one ﬁber
to another. This can be achieved by using microengineered mirror arrays that
achieve the necessary precision. Figure 8.9 shows a simpliﬁed example of this.
There are challenges to be overcome with this approach. Although the use of
mirrors allows potentially less signal loss than the use of integrated optic switches,
mechanical considerations have to take into account thermal expansion as well as
an appropriate means of actuating the mirrors, the latter not shown in this diagram.
8.5.4 TUNABLE OPTICAL CAVITIES
In order to send more data down a single ﬁber, different wavelengths (colors)
of light can be sent down the same ﬁber, each carrying a different signal
(wavelength division multiplexers have been mentioned earlier). This requires

laser diodes of different wavelengths or laser diodes that can be tuned to one
of a number of wavelengths.
This is driving the development of a variety of solid-state lasers and associated
MEMS. Many laser structures are constructed so that the lasing action takes place
within a cavity bounded by two mirrors, one of which is only partially silvered
to allow some laser light to escape (Figure 8.10). By constructing cavities with
FIGURE 8.9 Optical cross-point switches. These are micromachined ﬁbers designed
to align a set of input ﬁbers and a set of output ﬁbers, as indicated. Mirrors are
positioned to link a particular input ﬁber with a particular output ﬁber. The simplest
structures may be LIGA based, with no active parts; mirrors are inserted into slots
when the network is set up or reconﬁgured. More complex devices involve active
mirrors that can be reconﬁgured without human interference. Note the requirement for
very precise alignment.
FIGURE 8.10 Semiconductor laser. The junction is highly doped. Holes and electrons
recombining cause excess energy to be emitted as light. Photons are reﬂected back and
forth in the cavity, stimulating further recombination, which causes photons to be emitted
coherently with the stimulating photon. Light is emitted from the less polished end of the
junction. The length of the junction must be an exact multiple (or fraction) of the wave-
length of the laser light, which is determined by the semiconductor materials used. It is
possible to achieve some degree of tuning by varying the junction length. Other designs
have been developed that can lase over relatively wide bandwidths.

dimensions that are multiples of the laser wavelength, it is possible to tune the
frequency of light that the laser emits, that is, the laser would normally produce
light over a relatively broad band of the spectrum. MEMS techniques are therefore
being employed to create cavities with variable dimensions that can be used to
create dynamically tunable laser sources.

9 Assembly and 
Packaging
9.1
INTRODUCTION
Microengineered devices have the potential to be as inexpensive as silicon chips
are today. This, however, will only be true when two conditions are met: (1) the
fabrication process has a high yield (most of the devices on a wafer function
properly and continue to do so after packaging) and (2) batch processing tech-
niques are used for as much of the process as possible (i.e., large numbers of
devices per silicon wafer, and a large number of wafers are processed at the same
time at each fabrication step).
When developing microengineered devices and complicated microsystems,
it is difﬁcult to achieve high yields. However, these must be achieved before
putting the device into production, with few exceptions. If the device does some-
thing that is very important and cannot be done any other way, then perhaps a
low yield and expensive devices can be justiﬁed.
Assembling complex devices from many microscopic parts and, in particular,
packaging these devices so they can be handled and connected to other compo-
nents or systems will generally involve handling the devices individually. This
can add signiﬁcantly to the cost of the ﬁnished part (tens to hundreds of times
the cost of the actual active part of the device depending on the complexity and
requirements of packaging). Consequently, the assembly and packaging of
devices for commercial manufacturing have to be carefully considered.
9.2
ASSEMBLY
Obviously, if microsystems consisting of many microscopic parts have to be assem-
bled by hand, this can be a costly and time-consuming process. Hand assembly may
be acceptable for device development or prototyping. Unfortunately, because the
very small parts have to be lined up very accurately (or else they will not go together
or will stick), conventional robotic assembly tools are not particularly suited to the
task. Consequently, a method for assembling the microsystem or component has to
be considered and, ideally, designed at a relatively early stage.
9.2.1 DESIGN FOR ASSEMBLY
The most obvious approach is to design a device that does not need assembling.
This is most easily seen in surface-micromachined parts in which the ﬁnal
etch step removes the sacriﬁcial material and releases all the components.

210
Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
Some microstereolithography processes (Chapter 3, Subsection 3.6.8) also lend
themselves to the formation of free structures.
In other cases, the materials required for a particular application may negate
such a simple strategy; this is especially true if one wishes to use incompatible
fabrication processes (such as bonding laser diodes to integrated optic devices).
The following should be considered:
•
Can wafers be bonded rather than individual devices?
•
Can components be constructed in such a way that they automatically
align with one another when brought together (see the next section)?
•
What tolerance can be achieved with the alignment tools being used?
•
What tolerance can be achieved with the available microactuators or
micromanipulators?
•
Can components be built into the microsystem to enable or monitor align-
ment (e.g., test-pad access to optical sensors to facilitate ﬁber alignment)?
9.2.1.1
Auto- or Self-Alignment and Self-Assembly
Various techniques can be used to automatically align different components of a
microsystem. “V” grooves are relatively easy to fabricate in silicon, and these
can be used to align optical ﬁbers to waveguides on the chip for integrated optics
applications (Figure 9.1).
Owing to the small size of the parts involved, surface tension forces (in liquids
such as water) can be used to assemble microengineered devices. For example, surface-
micromachined devices can be produced with hinges and latches so that surface tension
can be used to draw plates up and latch them into place to form vertical walls.

When parts are soldered or brazed together, careful design may enable the
use of surface tension in the molten metal to correctly align the components. This
can be readily seen in modern printed circuit boards in which the surface tension
in the molten solder aligns small surface-mounted components to their pads,
although placement machine errors may have only left them partially overlapping
the pad to which they were supposed to bond.
Another possibility that has been proposed is the use of hydrophobic and
hydrophilic areas on the surfaces of the parts. When the parts are ﬂoated on water,
they line up such that the hydrophobic surfaces come together.
9.2.1.2
Future Possibilities
Assembling microparts into microsystems is an area that is receiving more
research and development attention as the processes for producing the parts are
becoming better developed. One of the areas that received attention under a 10-
year micromachines research program sponsored by the Japanese government
was the development of a desktop micromachines factory.
9.3
PASSIVATION
Often, parts of micromachined devices have to be exposed to the environment in
which they are operating. This means that they have to be protected from mechan-
ical damage and from contamination by dust or liquids that may affect the
electronic circuitry. They must also be able to dissipate the heat generated by any
active electronic components on chip.
Generally speaking, this has led to devices being coated directly by a thin
ﬁlm of either silicon dioxide or, more commonly, silicon nitride. These are usually
deposited at relatively low temperatures using a technique known as plasma-
enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), because high temperatures may
affect components already on the device or induce unnecessary mechanical stress.
Silicon nitride is commonly used as it is wear-resistant and provides a good
barrier to sodium ions in the environment, which penetrate into oxide layers and
destroy their insulating properties. However, under some circumstances a nitride
layer alone is not suitable. For instance, in physiological saline solution, under
an applied electric ﬁeld such as may result from active components on a chip,
nitride rapidly degrades. Thus, sometimes, multiple layers of oxide and nitride
are used: the oxide insulating the nitride from current ﬂow and the nitride pro-
tecting the oxide from sodium ions.
More recently, it has become possible to deposit ﬁlms of diamond. Diamond
has excellent resistance to wear, is a good electrical insulator, and a good con-
ductor of heat. However, the deposition process for these ﬁlms requires a relatively
high temperature (around 700 to 900°C); the ﬁlms are polycrystalline (made of
many small crystals) and are relatively difﬁcult to machine.
An alternative to diamond is the so-called diamond-like carbon (DLC, some-
times referred to as amorphous carbon). DLC ﬁlms can be deposited using

212
Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
PECVD techniques, and the deposition can be controlled to produce ﬁlms with
different qualities. These, as with diamond, are also biocompatible.
Another ﬁlm being investigated for various applications is silicon carbide.
This, too, is wear- and chemical-resistant. It can also be deposited using PECVD
techniques.
9.4 PREPACKAGE TESTING
In Chapter 4, the inclusion of test structures on masks was introduced. As wire
bonding and packaging are expensive processes, it is desirable to test devices prior
to wafer dicing. Obviously, the degree to which this can be performed depends on
the design to some extent. It may be very difﬁcult to test optical or microﬂuidic
components prior to assembly with appropriate input and output ports. Nonetheless,
there are some standard techniques that can be employed to ease testing.
The principal inspection tool in any fabrication is the scanning electron
microscope (SEM), which is dealt with in Chapter 10. This is coupled with
proﬁlometers that can be used to measure step dimensions and optical techniques
can be employed to measure certain ﬁlm thicknesses. Note that these normally
only sample one very small area of the wafer.
Beyond these tools, the main test tool is the probe station. This consists of a
microscope and a set of tungsten needles mounted on micromanipulators. The wafer
is placed on the station and the needles maneuvered onto test pads using the
micromanipulators (either automatically or manually). Test signals can be injected,
and the results can be measured via other needles or observed using the microscope.
Other optical approaches can be used to make measurements. For instance,
interference fringes can be used to monitor membrane deformation.
The test procedure should be considered alongside the initial device design.
Requirements will differ considerably for different MEMS devices, but generally
include:
•
Electronic test structures on wafers incorporating electronic circuitry
(ring counters are a standard).
•
Mechanical test structures where appropriate, such as:
•
Systems for exciting or deforming structures normally excited or
deformed by external forces.
•
Structures for monitoring movement of actuators.
•
Additional test pads where possible. When diagnosing a problem, it is
desirable to have available as many signals and intervention points as
possible.
9.5
PACKAGING
The package that the microsystem or device is ﬁnally mounted on has to perform
many functions. It will enable the users of the device to handle and incorporate
it into their own design. It will allow the attachment of electrical connections,
ﬂuid ports, ﬁber optics, etc., with minimum interference from stray signals or

213
noise in the environment. It may also protect the device in harsh environments,
preventing it from mechanical damage, chemical attack, or high temperatures. In
many cases, when considering electronic devices, the package must also prevent
light falling on the device, because the generation of charge carriers by photo-
electric effects will appear as noise. In the case of light sensors, however, the
package may be designed to concentrate light at a particular spot.
Owing to the variety of microengineered devices, it is not possible to specify
a generic package. However, it is possible to make some general comments. The
package must be designed to reduce electrical (or electromagnetic) interference
with the device from outside sources, as well as to reduce interference generated
by the device itself. Connections to the package must also be capable of delivering
the power required by the device, and connections out of the package must have
minimal sources of signal disruption (e.g., stray capacitance). The package must
be able to dissipate heat generated by the active device to keep it cool. Where
necessary, it must also be able to withstand high operating temperatures. It should
also be designed to minimize problems due to different coefﬁcients of thermal
expansion of the materials used; this is often more important in microengineered
sensors and devices than for conventional integrated circuits (ICs). It should also
minimize stress on the device because of external loading of the package and be
rugged enough to withstand the environment in which the device will be used.
The package also has to have the appropriate ﬂuid feed tubes, optical ﬁbers,
etc., attached to it and aligned or attached to the device inside.
9.5.1 CONVENTIONAL IC PACKAGING
Conventional IC packages are usually ceramic (for high-reliability applications)
or plastic.
With ceramic packages, the die is bonded to a ceramic base, which includes
a metal frame and pins for making electrical connections outside the package
(Figure 9.2). Wires are bonded between bonding pads on the die and the metal frame
(these frames are often manufactured using PCM techniques — see Chapter 3,
Section 3.4). The package is usually sealed with a metal lid.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
With plastic packages, a similar attach-to-base/bond-wires/seal-with-lid pro-
cess may be used. After wire bonding, however, it is also possible to mold the
plastic package around the device. As the substrate of many ICs requires an
electrical connection to bias it, the die may be bonded to a metal connector on
the base either by thermal methods (melting a suitable metal beneath the die) or
by using a conductive epoxy resin.
Epoxy resins are quite often used to attach devices to substrates or to insulate
or package them, particularly with prototype micromachined devices. With par-
ticularly sensitive devices, however, it is necessary to be aware that some epoxy
resins get hot while curing or may shrink slightly, putting mechanical stress on
the device.
9.5.2 MULTICHIP MODULES
Multichip modules (MCMs) are another aspect of microengineering technology.
In the search for ever faster computers and electronic devices, it is desirable to
keep the connections between chips as short as possible. This leads to the devel-
opment of MCMs in which many dies are assembled together into one module.
Often thick-ﬁlm techniques, in which conductors and insulators are screen printed
onto ceramic substrates, are used. More exotic techniques include technologies
that are being developed to stack up dies one on top of the other.
9.6
WIRE BONDING
There are two conventional ways of bonding wires to chips. These are thermo-
compression bonding and ultrasonic bonding. Commonly, ﬁne (25-µm diameter)
aluminum wire is used, but gold wire is also used quite often. For high-current
applications (e.g., to drive magnetic coils or for heaters), consider larger-diameter
wires or multiple connections.
9.6.1 THERMOCOMPRESSION BONDING
In thermocompression bonding, the die and the wire are heated to a high tem-
perature (around 250°C). The tip of the wire is heated to form a ball; the tool
holding it then forces it into contact with the bonding pad on the chip. The wire
adheres to the pad because of the combination of heat and pressure. The tool is
then lifted up and moved in an arc to the appropriate position on the frame,
dispensing wire as required. The process is repeated to bond the wire to the frame,
but this time a ball is not formed.
9.6.2 ULTRASONIC BONDING
This is used when the device cannot or should not be heated. In this case, the wire
and bonding surface (pad or frame) are forced together by the tool, and ultrasonic
vibration is used to compress the surfaces together to achieve the desired bond.

Assembly and Packaging
215
This can be combined with the previous technique to achieve a temperature
lower than that of thermocompression bonding.
9.6.3
FLIP-CHIP BONDING
Flip-chip bonding is another new technique associated with microengineering.
Here, small beads of solder are formed on bonding pads on the die. The die is
then mounted facedown on the base and heated until the solder melts and forms
a contact between metal tracks on the base and the bonding pads.
There are several methods by which solder bumps can be formed on the die
or wafer. Two common commercial methods are vapor deposition or electroplat-
ing. Some companies have developed screen-printing techniques or printing
through dry ﬁlm resists as alternatives. It is possible to achieve pitches down to
200 µm, but it is of greater interest to the microengineer to note that this technique
provides some degree of self-alignment during assembly because of the surface
tension of the molten solder. Note that when using this approach, or soldering
generally, the device has to be able to withstand application of heat at least for
a short period of time. When the ﬁnal assembly incorporates structures that act
as heat sinks, soldering ovens may need to be set to relatively high temperatures.
9.7
MATERIALS FOR PROTOTYPE ASSEMBLY
AND PACKAGING
Although some of these materials may be used for production devices, they are
listed here because most of them are commonly found in MEMS laboratories in
various applications.
•
Black wax
•
Dental wax
•
Polyethylene glycol
•
Silver-loaded epoxy
•
Epoxy adhesives
•
UV-curing adhesives
•
Cyanoacrylate adhesives
•
Photoresists
•
PTFE tape
Black wax, commonly known as “apiezon” is useful for temporarily holding
parts together and is used during low-temperature wet-etching processes to protect
part of the wafer. Being opaque, it also protects electronic components from optical
interference. It can be applied in liquid form when dissolved, commonly in toluene,
but it is often difﬁcult to remove. Solvents include toluene (often used hot) and
xylene, and ultrasonic cleaning baths have also been employed to help remove the
wax. It is insoluble in the two common clean room cleaning solvents: acetone and
isopropyl alcohol.
Dental wax is also available for holding small parts temporarily. It comes
with a variety of melting temperatures. Another material, not a wax, that has

216
Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
unusual properties but is not commonly found in clean rooms is polyethylene
glycol. This is available in various molecular weights and, hence, different melting
points. It is also soluble in water.
Electrical contacts can be made using silver-loaded epoxy. This is commonly
used to ensure the electrical bonding of the back of a die to the substrate to enable
biasing, but it can also be used to attach wires to bonding pads. If this is done
by hand, it is a good idea to have relatively large bonding pads (400 µm2 with
the same distance between them) at the edge of the die.
There are a variety of epoxy glues available. These form strong bonds and
are chemical-resistant. You should be aware that some will shrink on curing, some
require heat to cure, and some take a long time to cure during which individual
parts have to be clamped together.
UV-curing adhesives are becoming very popular. One problem with epoxies
is the need to hold parts together while the adhesive is curing, which can be
problematic. UV-curing epoxies have the advantage that curing is much more
rapid and occurs only when the adhesive is exposed to UV light. This offers some
advantages to prototype MEMS assemblies. It also makes these epoxies useful
for mass production, because they can be dispensed and cured as required without
having to worry about postmixing curing time or heating.
Cyanoacrylate adhesives, commonly known as “super glues,” offer instanta-
neous adhesion of parts. They do not offer great resistance to shear forces and
cannot be used if the device is to be exposed to water or humid environments.
Photoresists provide a form of temporary adhesive or passivation layer. There
is not much more to be said about this application, except that generally they are
not very good in either role (with the exception of epoxy-based resists such as SU-8).
Polytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE) tape is commonly found for temporarily taping
wafers together. It is not, in itself, an adhesive (it is better known for its application
to nonstick cookware), but it is water- and chemical-resistant and amalgamates with
itself to some extent, so it can be used for very short-term ﬁxes. One common use
is in conjunction with black wax to protect wafers during etching (Figure 9.3).

10 Nanotechnology
10.1 INTRODUCTION
The boundary between micro- and nanotechnology is blurred in much the same
way as that between microtechnology and miniature technology. The popular per-
spective is that nanotechnology is some sort of futuristic technology that involves
building little machines out of atoms, but if we develop our deﬁnition of microengi-
neering (working with tolerances in the order of micrometers) in relation to nano-
technology (i.e., working with tolerances in the order of nanometers), then even at
the time of writing nanotechnology has already arrived on the scene. Integrated
circuits are being manufactured with 90-nm feature sizes, and many powders and
solgels (such as the spin-on ceramics referred to in Chapter 1 of this book) have
particle sizes within the nanometer range.
Photolithography and, more notably, e-beam lithography can be used to produce
nanometer structures. Micromachining techniques can be reﬁned, and additional
machining techniques implemented, to produce nanoelectromechanical systems
(NEMS). The popular image of robots built out of atoms is being developed, but
this is a small part of molecular nanotechnology, which also has to compete with
bionanotechnology, where parts are taken from nature’s nanomachines (cells, bac-
teria, and viruses) and assembled into new conﬁgurations.
This chapter is a brief review of many aspects of nanotechnology, but will
start with an exploration of scanning probe microscopes (SPMs), after touching
brieﬂy on the MEMS workhorse microscope, the scanning electron microscope
(SEM). It was the use of SPMs to write the initials of a company on the atomic
scale with a few atoms that sparked off much of the popularity that nanotechnol-
ogy now enjoys.
10.2 THE SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE
Although optical microscopes are frequently found and used in MEMS work, it is
the SEM that is the true workhorse. In Chapter 1, where e-beam and UV lithography
were compared, the much smaller wavelength and, hence, superior resolution of
the electron became apparent. The same is true in the world of microscopy, and
basic SEMs can be obtained at a relatively low cost.
The basic form of a SEM is illustrated in Figure 10.1. The sample is placed
on a stage in a sample chamber. This can normally be rotated, tilted, or moved
in x, y, or z directions. The microscope itself is housed in a column that sits atop
the sample chamber. Generally speaking, the sample chamber and column need
to be evacuated, but some of the more expensive SEMs will operate under low

218
Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
pressures, allowing live biological specimens (insects such as mites, etc., that can
survive harsh environments) to be imaged.
Electrons are produced at the top of the column from an electron gun or point
source such as a sharpened tungsten needle. The electrons are accelerated through
electrodes toward the target, and the beam is focused to a spot by electrostatic
and magnetic lenses. These are lenses produced using either concentric electrodes
or electromagnetic coils, the exact arrangement depending on the manufacturer
of the instrument.
The beam (spot) is then scanned across a tiny portion of the surface of the
object by the “deﬂection coils,” the magniﬁcation being a combination of spot
size and the area over which it is scanned. At the same time that the beam is
scanned across the target, a second beam is scanned across a cathode ray tube.
The signal from the electron beam is ampliﬁed and reproduced on the CRT to
form an image.
One thing to note about the SEM is that because the sample is being contin-
uously bombarded with electrons, it will soon get charged. A charged sample
will cause artifacts to appear in the image. One solution to this is to reduce the
intensity of the beam, but it is normally better to ensure that the sample can
conduct any charge to ground by evaporating a thin layer of gold on to it. This
does make the sample unusable from a practical point of view, but if the aim is
to measure dimensions or verify the ﬁnal result of the process, then it saves a lot
of time used for adjusting beam parameters. This is especially true if the structure
has a good cover of insulating ﬁlms.
Alternative instruments for process measurement include optical techniques
for measuring steps and ﬁlm thicknesses (assuming the ﬁlm is transparent),

usually based on interference fringes, and mechanical proﬁlers. Talysurf is a
well-known brand name of one such device, and the atomic force microscope
(AFM), which will be discussed in the following text, is another mechanical
proﬁler.
10.3
SCANNING PROBE MICROSCOPY
The principles of scanning probe microscopy are illustrated in Figure 10.2. The
sample is mounted on a moveable and brought up to a probe. The tip of the probe
is sharpened to a ﬁne point and is designed to interact with the sample in some
manner. The stage is operated to scan the specimen beneath the probe, and a
feedback control system keeps the distance between the probe tip and the sample
constant. This enables images with atomic-scale resolution to be built up. This
section will consider three different forms of SPM: the scanning tunneling elec-
tron microscope (STEM), atomic force microscope (AFM), and the scanning
near-ﬁeld optical microscope (SNOM). The principal difference between these
can be found in the means of interaction between the probe and the sample, which
is further reﬂected in the probe tip itself and the means of controlling it.
10.3.1 SCANNING TUNNELING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE
The STEM is an electron microscope that operates on the phenomenon of tun-
neling. When two atoms are brought close together, an electron in the outer orbital
of one atom can sometimes disappear and reappear in the outer orbital of the
adjacent atom. It, in effect, “tunnels” through the energy barrier that separates
the two atoms. The phenomenon is termed “tunneling” because the electron never
appears between the two atoms; it is either associated with one or the other.
FIGURE 10.2 Basic principles of scanning probe microscopy. The sample is placed on
the top of a long stack (10 cm) of piezoelectric disks. A microdrive provides coarse
movement to bring the sample close to the probe, but all ﬁne movement is achieved by
the piezo stack. A feedback control unit keeps the distance between the probe tip and the
sample constant; the amount of drive needed by the electrodes to achieve this is directly
related to the topology of the surface. Scanning is achieved by bending the piezo stack;
because it is so long and the distances scanned are very short, it looks like a horizontal
translation.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
The frequency of tunneling depends upon the distance between the probe tip
and sample and also upon the electrical potential bias applied between the probe
and sample; this has the effect of increasing or decreasing the height of the energy
barrier for a given distance. The tunneling current between the probe and sample
is monitored: as the sample is scanned beneath the probe tip, the height is adjusted
to maintain a constant tunneling current and, hence, a constant distance between
the probe and sample. Note that the sample has to be electrically conductive for
this to work. STEM is normally carried out in a vacuum. Highest resolution is
achieved with cryogenically cooled stages.
The STEM tip is traditionally an electrolytically etched tungsten needle
(Figure 10.3a). The tip is formed by repeatedly dipping and withdrawing a tungsten
wire into an etch solution. A bias current assists in the etching process.
10.3.2 ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPE
The AFM interacts with the sample via weak attractive forces that exist between
two atoms in close proximity. The scanning tip is, now, normally a sharpened
point at the end of a micromachined silicon cantilever (Figure 10.3b). A laser
beam is directed toward the back of the probe, from where it is reﬂected onto a
quadrant photodiode detector. Deﬂection of the beam registers as an asymmetric
response from the detector.
The AFM is remarkably resilient and can be used in air, in (relatively) dirty
laboratory environments, and also in liquids. It can be used to image biological
material with minimal preparation. For optimal operation, the spring constant of
the probe needs to be calibrated (rather than relying on the manufacturer’s data).
Various other modalities, such as magnetic resonance and temperature measure-
ments, are currently being combined on AFM tips to provide additional informa-
tion about the sample.
Note that at the highest resolution, the AFM affects the sample mechanically.
Just as the probe tip is attracted down toward the sample, atoms in the sample
are attracted toward the probe tip.

10.3.3 SCANNING NEAR-FIELD OPTICAL MICROSCOPE
The tip of an SNOM is shown schematically in Figure 10.3c. The probe consists
of an optical ﬁber that is etched (by dipping and withdrawing) down to a ﬁne
point. A metal ﬁlm is then evaporated on this and a small opening made at the
tip, by spark discharge.
The ﬁber is illuminated by laser light, but the opening at the tip is narrower
than the wavelength of the light employed. In optical waveguides, a small portion
of the optical wave projects outside the waveguide. This is the “evanescent” ﬁeld
and can be used to excite ﬂuorophores when sufﬁciently close. Similarly, distur-
bances to the evanescent ﬁeld in other situations (e.g., planar waveguides) can
be used in sensing applications.
The SNOM functions, in the ﬁrst place, as an AFM. Usually, the ﬁber is made
to vibrate, and changes in the frequency of oscillation indicate interaction with the
sample. AFM probe tips with appropriate optics are also being developed. The
advantage of the SNOM is that it can be made to interact optically with the sample.
This makes it particularly useful in biology, where ﬂuorescent markers can be
excited by the SNOM and used to link chemistry with mechanical structure.
10.3.4 SCANNING PROBE MICROSCOPE: CONTROL
OF THE STAGE
Large movement of the SEM stage is achieved using small geared electric motors.
However, the main control element is a piezoelectric stack. This is a cylinder
several centimeters (4–5 cm) in length and has three or four electrodes at the
outer edges of the cylinder. By activating all the electrodes simultaneously, the
stack can be made to lengthen, bringing the specimen closer to the probe, or
shorten, moving it further away. By activating the electrodes asymmetrically, it
is possible to cause the stack to bend. Because of the long radius of curvature
compared to the horizontal motion, this is used to scan the sample in the x and y
directions beneath the probe.
10.3.5 ARTIFACTS AND CALIBRATION
Despite the efforts made to sharpen probe tips, they are still relatively blunt on
the atomic scale. As a consequence, sharp steps and narrow trenches in the sample
are often smoothed over (Figure 10.4).

to interact with the corner. This leads to a curved scan path, (c) dotted line, so the step is

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
There are two other limitations of SPMs of which to be aware. The ﬁrst is
that the area examined is a tiny fraction of the surface and may not be typical.
The second is particularly applicable when using AFMs. These often come with
software that will allow the rms surface roughness to be calculated at the push
of a button. At AFM scales, this is not necessarily a very useful absolute
measurement, because the rms roughness is fractal in nature (as you increase
magniﬁcation, you are measuring a different rms roughness).
The spring constant of AFM probes needs to be calibrated. This is normally
performed by measuring the fundamental frequency at which the probe oscillates.
When working to atomic-scale resolution, it is possible to calibrate the micro-
scope using an atomically ﬂat surface with a known interatomic spacing. The
arrangement of carbon atoms in graphite sheets provides one possibility. Mica
provides another. Adhesive tape applied to the sample and pulled away reveals a
clean, atomically ﬂat surface.
10.4 NANOELECTROMECHANICAL SYSTEMS
As suggested in the introduction, micro- and nanotechnologies are converging.
One strand of this convergence is the demand placed on lithography systems by
the integrated circuit industry. Another avenue is NEMS. Lithography techniques
can be adapted to produce nanostructures, but there are also some micromachining
techniques, covered in Part I, that can be adapted to produce nanostructures.
10.4.1 NANOLITHOGRAPHY
The principal tool for nanolithography was covered in Chapter 1: direct-write
e-beam lithography. This can be used to pattern structures down to 10-nm
minimum feature size, but there are several limits to this. Highest resolutions
are achieved with thin resist ﬁlms, therefore the processes employed to form
structures have to take this into account (harsh etches, for instance, have to be
used with care).
10.4.1.1 UV Photolithography for Nanostructures
The use of UV photolithography for high-resolution printing applications was
alluded to in Chapter 1. In summary, highest resolutions are achieved with short
wavelength illumination (i-line), projection printing, and thin-resist ﬁlms. How-
ever, resolution can be pushed further.
The ﬁrst requirement for improving resolution comes with corners on mask
structures. Corners will become rounded in the processed photoresist ﬁlm because
they ultimately require perfect resolution to be reproduced exactly (Figure 10.5a).
This can be compensated for by additional structures on the mask. These will not
be reproduced in the patterned photoresist but act to bulk out the corner to improve
its reproduction (Figure 10.5b). Similarly, by artiﬁcially enlarging very small struc-
tures on the mask they can be reproduced in the resist ﬁlm (Figure 10.5c).

This approach requires quite a sophisticated analysis of the optical system,
but this can be added to industrial CAD systems. It is generally known as optical
proximity correction and may also be applied for structures that are close together
on the mask.
10.4.1.1.1
Phase-Shift Masks
Another method by which high resolutions can be achieved is to employ a phase-
shift mask. This approach employs a mask that causes the phase of the UV
illumination to shift (by 180°) around the edges of the structures on the mask.
This creates a controlled interference pattern, which enables higher resolutions
to be achieved.
Two approaches are available for this. One is the use of molybdenum silicide
instead of chrome on a quartz mask. This transmits a small percentage of the
incident UV radiation, which is phase shifted. The other approach employs a
machined chrome-on-quartz mask (Figure 10.6). Where the light enters the etched
areas of the mask, it will be phase shifted. This can be used to create an inter-
ference pattern to print lines smaller than the wavelength of the light employed;
a similar effect can be achieved by depositing and patterning rather than etching
ﬁlms on the mask, thickening it. Note that a similar effect can be created with
x-ray masks by varying the thickness of the attenuating material.
FIGURE 10.5 (a) Corners on the mask (gray) become rounded in the resist proﬁle unless
compensation is employed, (b) compensated corner, (c) small features can be produced
in the resist by designing larger features that will be reduced down by optical effects.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
Phase-shift masks are usually produced by CAD systems equipped with
appropriate software to analyze the mask design.
It is worth noting that interference patterns have been productively used to
make various nanostructures, notably nanowires.
10.4.1.2 SPM “Pens”
The tips of SPMs have been used to draw structures on the surface of an appro-
priate material. The most basic of these approaches is to use the probe tip of an
AFM to scratch a design on the surface. This can also be employed to create
nanostructures by scratching away layers that have been created by the Lang-
muir–Blodgett (LB) technique, explained in the following subsection. A series
of monolayers of different compounds can be deposited and then cut through to
reveal the interior structure.
A further approach is to dip the tip of the AFM probe into a liquid and write
on a surface, as with an ink pen. This has been reported to produce 30-nm wide
lines, writing with alkanethiols on a gold surface [1]. The use of the STEM with
electron-sensitive photoresists is also possible.
10.4.2 SILICON MICROMACHINING AND NANOSTRUCTURES
Whereas basic photolithography systems cannot be used to produce nanostruc-
tures, it is possible to adapt silicon micromachining techniques to produce struc-
tures that bridge the micro–nano division. The simplest approach is to use timed
over-etching to etch microstructures down to nanostructures. This approach has
been used to form AFM probe tips. In Figure 10.7, for example, an oxide pillar
is etched down by immersion in a slow-timed wet etch.
Oxide, nitride, and metal ﬁlms can be deposited with submicron thickness.
This means that it is possible to produce structures with submicron vertical feature
sizes, such as steps with 100-nm heights, without having to resort to special
techniques. Horizontal dimensions will, however, still be on the order of microns
if standard photolithographic techniques are used. Thin-beam structures can be
implemented in silicon using concentration-dependent etching, or electrochemical
etching, but with very shallow diffusion or implantation of the impurities.

Thermal oxidation has proved to be fertile ground when it comes to the pro-
duction of nanostructures. High-quality oxide ﬁlm can be carefully controlled
because it grows slowly, and it also grows on all exposed silicon regardless of
orientation. Figure 10.8 shows how this can be used to produce freestanding walls
of submicrometer thickness. A nitride mask is employed, and a vertical trench is
etched in the silicon wafer (Figure 10.8a). Thermal oxide is grown on the walls of
the trench (Figure 10.8b). After this, the nitride is stripped in phosphoric acid. The
wafer is then etched in a silicon etch that has a high selectivity over oxide
(e.g., TMAH), leaving the freestanding structures (Figure 10.8c).
Thermal oxidation can also be used to close up microstructures. Figure 10.9
outlines an approach that has been used to create membranes with pore dimen-
sions of less than 100 nm. In Figure 10.9, a silicon membrane has been prepared
with a pyramidal pore etched through it using KOH (Figure 10.9a). An SOI wafer
can be used for this, for example. The smallest dimensions of the pyramidal pore
will depend on many variables, such as control of the KOH etch process, thickness
and thickness variations of the membrane, tolerances of the photolithography
process, etc. However, quite large pores can be closed up by thermal oxidation,
as in Figure 10.9b.
Finally, it is worth noting that when setting up deposition equipment, one is
frequently faced with a number of artifacts or defects in the ﬁlms produced: islands,
pinholes, ears, etc. These, typically, have submicron dimensions, and if it is possible
to produce them in a controlled manner, they can be used as nanostructures. Some
quantum dots were ﬁrst produced as defects during a deposition process.
10.4.3 ION BEAM MILLING
Ion beam milling was introduced in Chapter 2. This was divided into showered-
ion-beam milling (SIBM) and focused-ion-beam milling (FIBM). The former thins
out samples simultaneously over a large area, and the latter only at a focal point.
FIGURE 10.8 Nanostructures formed using thermal oxide: (a) trench etched through
nitride mask, (b) thermal oxide, (c) nitride stripped and silicon etched (e.g., in TMAH).

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
Both operate below the melting point of the material being machined, using the
process of physical sputtering: energetic incident ions knock atoms off the sub-
strate material, no burning or other chemical reactions are involved. Ion beam
milling can be used to machine a variety of common materials, including most
of those found in semiconductor manufacturing, diamond, ceramics, etc.
SIBM is capable of machining at rates of microns per minute over areas of
tens of square centimeters. The equipment, usually, consists of an evacuated column
with an ion source at the top and the sample at the bottom. The ion source is often
a gaseous plasma, and ions are extracted from this and accelerated in a beam of
several centimeters diameter toward the target. SIBM can be used to polish or
control the proﬁle of microstructures down to features of tens of nanometers.
The rate of material removal of SIBM depends on the material being
machined, ion type, the energy of the ions, and the angle of incidence (with a
maximum in the 40 to 60° range). Ion beam milling also causes subsurface
damage, which is also dependent on the material involved and the ion energy.
FIBM normally uses a liquid-metal ion source, normally gallium, which
produces a beam of metal ions. This is focused to a spot of less than 10 nm in
a manner similar to an SEM. The beam is directed to particular parts of the
structure to be machined, and is capable of cutting trenches with sub-100-nm
width and trimming structures to the order of 10 nm. Unlike SIBM, however, it
only mills a small area at one time, making it slow for use in batch production.
FIBM can also be used to deposit materials in a localized vapor deposition
process. The vapor phase of an organic or organometallic precursor is delivered
to the chamber in the region of the incident beam (Figure 10.10), where it is
decomposed by the beam. Furthermore, FIBM systems with gallium ion
sources can implant gallium ions into titanium (this is an unwanted side effect
in many FIBM processes). However, in titanium, gallium impurities act as an
etch stop (above ∼1 × 1015 cm−3) when etching is performed with SF6 in a
plasma etcher. Structures with a width of 250 nm can be produced using this
approach.
The similarity of the FIBM and SEM has already been noted. It is also
possible to monitor the process of machining or even image the substrate by

monitoring secondary ions or electrons coming from the target, amplifying the
signal, and displaying it, or by monitoring the current from the substrate.
10.5 LANGMUIR–BLODGETT FILMS
The Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) technique allows ﬁlms of one-molecule thickness
to be built up on solid substrate materials. The materials that can be used to form
these layers are water-insoluble amphiphilic organic molecules such as fatty acids.
These consist of a hydrophilic polar head (such as a carboxyl, amine, alcohol, or
carboxylic group) that dissolves in water, and a long hydrophobic hydrocarbon
tail, that does not; Figure 10.11 shows a typical schematic depiction (Chapter 7
contains an introduction to organic chemistry). These are dissolved in a volatile
organic solvent that does not dissolve in water. A small drop of this solution is
deposited onto the surface of a tank of water, and when the solvent evaporates
the amphiphilic molecules remain with the hydrophilic head dissolved in the
surface of the water and the tail projecting from it.
The coating process takes place in a tank with a balance to measure the
surface pressure of the ﬁlm, and computer-controlled barriers conﬁne the area
over which the ﬁlm can spread. If a few molecules are scattered over a large
surface area, they will interact very rarely and form a fairly random ﬁlm. As the
surface area is reduced, they will be compressed into a highly ordered state, the
solid phase (Figure 10.12). The changes between the disorganized gaseous phase
and organized solid phase are observable by changes in the surface pressure.
LB ﬁlms are applied by dipping the substrate into the tank and withdrawing
it (Figure 10.13) using feedback control of the barriers to maintain the surface
FIGURE 10.11 Schematic ways of representing an amphiphilic molecule: (a) explicit
drawing of head, schematic drawing of hydrocarbon tail, (b) head drawn as circle,

pressure indicative of the solid phase. The orientation of the molecules in the
ﬁlm thus produced depends on the molecules themselves, the substrate, and the
precise technique employed. Generally, a hydrophilic substrate will have the
orientation illustrated in Figure 10.13, with the tails pointing away from the
substrate, whereas a hydrophobic substrate will have the opposite orientation.
Deposition can occur on dip, withdrawal, or both, and it is possible to build up
multiple layers. Additionally, it is possible to build up alternating coats of different
amphiphilic molecules.
10.6 BIONANOTECHNOLOGY
One could say that nanotechnology is now in an analogous position to the early
days of aviation. We know what is possible with bionanotechnology because it is
visible all around us in nature; we only have to work out how it is done. Rather
than trying to design our own molecular machines from scratch (molecular nano-
technology) or adapting comparatively well-understood micromachining processes
(NEMS), bionanotechnology borrows components found in nature, usually the
living cell, and puts them together in new conﬁgurations.
Another source of inspiration is from viruses. Many viruses survive outside the
cell by being enclosed in sophisticated capsules formed of proteins, which can be
considered as basic nanostructures (Chapter 7 includes a brief introduction to the
molecules mentioned in this section). One of the basic uses of such structures is
as formers for nonbiological structures; metal ﬁlms can be evaporated over these,
and some of the biological materials mentioned in the following text, for instance.
Most of the nanostructures employed in bionanotechnology will either be
manufactured by genetic engineering of bacteria (usually  Escheria coli ) or
extracted from cells by a complex separation process.
Figure 10.14 shows two different cells in outline: the animal cell (Figure
10.14a) and a bacterium cell (Figure 10.14b). The animal cell has a clear nucleus
and is therefore termed “eukaryotic.” It is enclosed in a lipid bilayer membrane
formed of amphiphilic molecules with polar heads on the inner and outer surfaces
of the membrane and tails in the center. Various proteins project through or are
FIGURE 10.13 Forming a Langmuir Blodgett ﬁlm on a hydrophilic substrate.

dissolved in this membrane. It also contains a number of small membrane-bound
structures called “organelles,” which have speciﬁc functions. The bacterial cell
is also highly organized, but does not contain membrane-bound organelles. Nor-
mally, it will have a tough protein coat, and this one has been depicted with a
ﬂagellum, which helps it to move around in a liquid environment. It should be
borne in mind that these descriptions are very general.
The basic fuel for the cell is adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is converted
(hydrolyzed) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or adenosine monophosphate
(AMP) when any work is done. ATP is generated either through photosynthesis
or by breaking down fuel molecules (to ethanol in anaerobic conditions or
carbon dioxide and water in aerobic conditions, i.e., when oxygen is available).
In the following discussion, it is worth remembering that many processes in
the cell require a number of different components to bind together, break apart, or
change shape at different stages. Similarly, most molecular machines in the cell,
even relatively simple ones, are composed of several components. These may be
identical macromolecules that join together, such as machines formed by two copies
of the same protein, or they may be composed of entirely different types of mac-
romolecules: proteins and RNAs, for example.
10.6.1 CELL MEMBRANES
Many different processes take place in the cell membrane. The cell needs to
maintain a particular chemical composition within itself in order to function. This
is achieved by pumps embedded in the cell membrane. These are complex proteins
or multiprotein structures, which, on encountering the item that they are required
to pump (e.g., a sodium ion), change shape (this usually involves the hydrolysis
of ATP) to move it from one side of the membrane to the other. In other circum-
stances, ions moving down the concentration gradient can be used to drive
processes without the involvement of ATP.
Artiﬁcial lipid bilayer membranes can be constructed in the form of closed
vesicles, and genetically engineered proteins can be embedded in them.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
10.6.2 THE CYTOSKELETON
Eukaryotic cells possess a skeleton. This is normally composed of tubulin or actin
ﬁlaments. Under the correct circumstances, tubulin will spontaneously polymer-
ize into long tubular structures, the microtubules. Actin also forms ﬁlaments that
are less rigid than those of tubulin.
Microtubules and actin ﬁlaments are characterized as having a plus end and a
minus end; the plus end is the end to which new units are added (or removed from)
when the structure grows in the cell. Microtubules and actin ﬁlaments are the
highways along which one type of molecular motor runs. Normally, these move
things about in the cell, but they can be adapted by engineers to do other tasks.
10.6.3 MOLECULAR MOTORS
The molecular motors that travel along microtubules are known as kinesins and
dyenins. Kinesins “walk” along the microtubule towards the positive end, and
dyenins are negative-end directed. A molecular motor that encounters a micro-
tubule will walk along it until it reaches the end, where it will fall off.
Several different kinds of kinesins and dyenins are encountered in the cell,
but they progress along the microtubule in a similar manner. These motors possess
two “feet” that interact with the microtubule (see Figure 10.15 for schematic
examples). It is thought that they progress along the microtubule by detaching
one foot, deforming the molecule, reattaching the foot, and then detaching the
other foot and moving it up to the ﬁrst one. In this way they remain permanently
attached to the microtubule.
Myosins walk along actin ﬁlaments. Myosin I has one foot, and myosin II
has two. The action of myosin II is different from two-footed kinesins in that
it probably acts to draw two actin ﬁlaments past each other (Figure 10.16b).

Myosins are positive-end directed. Figure 10.16 shows some roles for myosin in
the cell.
Linear molecular motors can be made to do useful work for the nanoengineer
by bonding the motor to one component and forming mictotubules on a second
one. In an aqueous environment, with sufﬁcient ATP, the motors will drive one
component over the other.
The ﬂagella motor is used by bacteria to move around in aqueous environ-
ments. The ﬂagellum itself is composed of ﬂagellin protein subunits, but the
motor that drives it is a sophisticated rotary motor. This is shown schematically
in Figure 10.17.
The smallest rotary motor so far discovered is ATPase: the molecular assembly
that synthesizes ADT from ADP and phosphorous. It is driven by a pH gradient
across a cell membrane; if there is no pH gradient, then the reaction reverses (ATP is
converted to ADP and hydrogen ions are pumped across the membrane). The assem-
bly consists of one γ subunit, which is inserted in the membrane, and three α and

assemblies that perform the roles that one may expect to ﬁnd in a rotary motor — bearings,

three β subunits, which cluster around the γ subunit alternately (Figure 10.18a).
When ATPase is operating, the α and β subunits spin around the γ subunit. This can
be turned into an ATP-fueled rotary motor by bonding the α and β subunits to a
solid substrate and allowing the γ subunit to rotate (Figure 10.18b).
10.6.4 DNA-ASSOCIATED MOLECULAR MACHINES
Many operations are carried out on the DNA double helix in cells, such as repair,
duplication, and transcription to RNA. Most of these require the protein machine
to recognize a speciﬁc site on the DNA, assemble on it, and then travel along the
DNA until the task has been completed or a stop signal is read from the DNA.
The component of the molecular machine that achieves forward motion is the
DNA helicase. A more complete treatment can be found in Reference 2.
This is not the only form of movement along DNA that can be found. For
example, some bacterial type I endonucleases bind at one site and then reel in a
large length of DNA [3].
The attraction of this area of research is that DNA strands can be designed
and synthesized with speciﬁc sequences, and biotin and streptavidin can be used
to bind the ends to speciﬁc points. Unlike kinesins and dyenins, DNA sequences
can be deﬁned so that the binding machines assemble at speciﬁc points and then
travel to other speciﬁc points where they disassemble. At the time of writing,
however, this area of research is yet to be explored in detail.

10.6.5 PROTEIN AND DNA ENGINEERING
Given that proteins with sophisticated functions are produced in nature and that
the means to manufacture these through genetic engineering exist, it would appear
to be worthwhile investigating how proteins could be designed to perform speciﬁc
tasks. There are a number of problems associated with this.
Although proteins only have two basic structural features, α helices and β
sheets, their function is dependent on how they fold into their tertiary structure
and what parts are exposed or hidden (e.g., the overall pattern of surface charge).
In the cell, folding into the correct shapes is often assisted by specialized proteins.
At present, it is impossible to use computer analysis to predict how proteins with
more than three to ﬁve amino acids will fold.
For this reason, protein engineering is limited to selecting a likely candidate,
analyzing its tertiary structure (if known), identifying likely points at which to
make changes, and trying these out. One is then faced with having to produce
the new proteins in bacteria, which is still something of a “black art.”
DNA and RNA engineering is slightly easier, because it is possible to predict
which base will pair with which. It is, for example, possible to engineer single
strands of DNA that close and open like tweezers because of base pairing or
melting, depending on the temperature.
10.7 MOLECULAR NANOTECHNOLOGY
There are several disadvantages to assembling molecular machines from biolog-
ical components found in nature, aside from the fact that they are still poorly
understood as engineering materials. One problem is that they normally have to
operate in chemically complex, and quite speciﬁc, aqueous environments, which
slightly limits their application. A further problem is that many life-forms have
evolved to look on these components as food.
Molecular nanotechnology is commonly envisioned as the diamandoid
structures popularized by K. Eric Drexler [4]. This approach proposes the
creation of nanomachines using carbon chemistry, but instead of the long-chain
approach found in nature, the bodies of these structures are composed by carbon
atoms bonded to each other in a diamond-like manner (tetrahedral bonds as
seen in silicon; Chapter 2). Surface chemistry and surface charge are still
important and have to be designed to provide sufﬁcient attraction to hold the
machines together and sufﬁcient repulsion to ﬂoat bearings apart. The overall
appearance of these designs is similar to macroscopic and MEMS machines:
bearings, gears, etc.
Although some progress has been made in this area, these designs still remain
mainly as computer models. The chemistry to create them is complex, and a variety
of approaches have been proposed. One popular suggestion has been the use of an
AFM or STEM to enhance the chemistry by holding atoms in position. These SPMs
can be used to manipulate individual atoms: a small electrical pulse applied to the
probe can detach an atom from the surface and attach it to the probe tip, and reversing

the polarity of the pulse places it back again. This approach has been used to write
slogans with atoms and may prove useful for data storage, but the nanoassembler
still seems a long way off.
10.7.1 BUCKMINSTERFULLERENE
Relatively recently, two new forms of carbon were discovered. One of these was
the C60 molecule: sixty carbon atoms bonded together in a soccer-ball-like structure.
This was followed by carbon nanotubes: carbon sheets rolled up into tubular
structures. Carbon nanotubes can be single walled or multiple walled (one inside
another). These structures are produced by arc decomposition of carbon rods under
controlled conditions.
“Bucky balls” and carbon nanotubes are still being explored in terms of elec-
trical, optical, and mechanical properties. They have been proposed for a variety
of applications. Nanotubes have been investigated as reinforcement for composite
materials, elements of quantum transistors, and even AFP probe tips, for instance.
10.7.2 DENDRIMERS
Dendrimers are a bridge between bionanotechnology and diamondoid molecular
nanotechnology. They are highly branched spherical molecules, built up from a
core molecule by successive reactions of acrylic acid (Figure 10.19a) and a
diamine (Figure 10.19b). Each layer of acrylic acid and diamine is referred to as
a “generation.” By the ﬁfth generation the molecule has developed a fairly orga-
nized spherical structure. Each generation leaves the surface of the molecule with
amine terminations and each half generation with carboxylic acid terminations
(Figure 10.20 shows how a dendrimer structure builds up). This leaves consid-
erable scope for modiﬁcation of the surface chemistry, and a wide choice of
diamines and cores provide structural ﬂexibility. 
Assemblies of different dendrimers are being explored for biological and
medical applications, as are their optical and electronic properties.

Part III
Interfacing
III.1 INTRODUCTION
Almost all MEMS devices will eventually need to be interfaced to a control
system, and this will invariably be some form of electronic control system. In
the laboratory, a PC with an appropriate interface card can be employed, but this
will still require some additional interfacing circuitry between the card and the
MEMS device. In a ﬁnished product, it is quite possible that a microcontroller
will be employed, which will also require signal-conditioning circuits.
MEMS devices are often quite unusual in terms of electronic requirements.
They are frequently on the high side of current and voltage requirements (hun-
dreds of milliamperes and tens of volts) compared to modern electronics. On the
other hand, this is still on the low side compared to what is termed “power
electronics.”
This section attempts to introduce some basic, and quite generic, electronic
designs that will help when planning how individual MEMS devices will be used
in practice, and will facilitate test circuit design and construction.
The treatment focuses mainly on analog electronics design, although the
transistor is introduced as a switch in Chapter 11. It is, therefore, worth noting
some aspects of digital control at this point.
Digital logic devices come in a number of different varieties, operated at a
number of different voltage levels. However, from the interfacing point of view,
both PC I/O cards and microcontrollers are relatively robust in digital terms. They
normally operate with 5 V logic levels and can generally source or sink 10 mA.
When CMOS logic compatibility is speciﬁed, this means that the output range
is split into three parts: the lower third from 0 V upward represents a logic 0, the
upper third a logic 1, and anything between these is undeﬁned. TTL compatible
logic levels are: 0 to 0.7 V logic 0, greater than 1.8 V is logic 1. Finally, if pressed
for a solution, it is worth remembering that 4000 series CMOS devices are
available and operate at up to 15 V, unlike most modern logic devices.
The subsequent chapters are set out as follows. Chapter 11 attempts to
provide as comprehensive an introduction to basic electronics as possible within
this format, ending up with operational ampliﬁers, the backbone device for
analog electronics, and op-amp applications and ﬁltering. Chapter 12 is entitled

“Computer Interfacing,” but focuses mainly on analog-to-digital and digital-to-
analog conversion. Many of the approaches employed in digital interfacing —
transistor switches, relays, and optoisolators — can be found in Chapter 13, which
also deals with using transistors to boost the output of operational ampliﬁers.
The material is presented in a manner that is intended to give a good basic
grounding in electronic design and show the pathways along which solutions lie.
At some point, however, it is possible that more advanced material will be
required, for which specialized electronic textbooks will be needed [1,2,3].

11 Ampliﬁers and Filtering
11.1 INTRODUCTION
Although there are many readily available data acquisition boards and units that
can be readily interfaced to a PC, providing highly ﬂexible analog and digital
inputs and outputs, it is still quite probable that it will be necessary to use
additional analog-signal-conditioning circuitry to either drive a MEMS device or
to amplify and ﬁlter the signal received from a sensor. If a self-contained unit is
to be created, then a suitable microcontroller can be selected, hopefully one with
the required analog-input/output (I/O)-interfacing capabilities. Even so, it may
still be necessary to implement ﬁlters for antialiasing and noise reduction pur-
poses. Many of these requirements can be addressed using operational ampliﬁers
(op-amps), and the concepts gleaned in studying these can also be employed
when considering other problems.
Before introducing this topic, it may be useful for the uninitiated to consider
the following very brief introduction to fundamental electronic components
(or elements).
11.1.1 QUICK INTRODUCTION TO ELECTRONICS
For the purposes of an introduction and a very brief analysis, we consider ideal-
ized electronic components. The symbols employed for these components are
shown in Figure 11.1. For brevity, the ideal component will be described along
with its time and frequency response characteristics. The frequency response
assumes an applied sinusoidal signal with frequency of ω rad/sec (1 Hz is 2π
rad/sec). Note that this is only for sinusoidal signals.
The lowercase letter j is used to represent the square root of 1. This is standard
practice in electronics, where the letter i, which is used for the same purpose in
mathematics and physics, refers instead to electric current.
11.1.1.1 Voltage and Current Conventions
In practice, voltage is measured with respect to one point (in the circuit), i.e., the
ground (GND) or 0-V line. When considering individual components, the concept
of a voltage drop is introduced. The voltage drop is the voltage (or potential, giving
rise to the more ambiguously named “potential difference”) measured at one end
of the component (usually marked with a − symbol) subtracted from the voltage
measured at the other end of the component (usually marked with a + symbol); see
Figure 11.2 for examples of both positive and negative voltage drops. The voltage
drop between two arbitrary points in a circuit (A and B) is written as VAB.
Copyright © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC

240
Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
Less commonly, the voltage drop across a particular component is written
with the name of the component as the subscript; for instance, the voltage dropped
across R1 is VR1. Note that this does not indicate the polarity of the voltage drop.
Voltage can be considered as the electrical driving force, driving current
around the circuit.
Conventional current ﬂows from the most positive part of the circuit (highest
voltage) to the most negative (lowest voltage), and is indicated by the letter I.
The direction in which current ﬂow is assumed is indicated by an arrow on the
circuit diagram. A negative value for a current, obtained from a series of calculations,

means that actual current ﬂow will be in the direction opposite to the marked
arrow. Figure 11.3 shows conventional marking for voltage drop and current ﬂow
across a resistor element. (Note that it is not absolutely necessary for the arrow
to be marked from + to −, as long as any departures are reﬂected in the equations
used to analyze the circuit. Students unfamiliar with this topic are recommended
to follow the conventions.) 
11.1.1.2 The Ideal Conductor and Insulator
Figure 11.1a and Figure11.1b show the ideal wire that is used to connect individual
circuit elements in circuit diagrams. It allows electrical current to ﬂow unimpeded,
so any amount of current can ﬂow and yet no voltage drop will be developed across
the wires at any time (this condition may also be referred to as a “short circuit”).
One may consider the converse, the ideal insulator: any value of voltage may
be placed across it and yet no current will ﬂow (this may also be termed an “open
circuit”). It is useful to visualize these conditions, as a good grasp of them can
assist in the understanding of various problems.
11.1.1.3 The Ideal Resistor
The ideal resistor element is shown in Figure 11.1c and Figure 11.d. The current
ﬂowing through it is related by Ohm’s law to the voltage dropped across it. Both
the time and frequency domain equations are identical:
time and frequency domain 
(11.1)
FIGURE 11.3 Voltage and current marking for a resistor.
DC and AC
The distinction is often made between a direct current and an alternating one.
This is a misnomer, as DC is usually used to refer to a constant voltage —
one that does not vary over time. AC is usually applied to refer to a voltage
that varies in a sinusoidal manner over time.
•
DC values are normally written using capital letters, V and I to
represent voltage and current.
•
AC values and transient signals are normally written using lower
case letters, v and i to represent voltage and current.

11.1.1.4 The Ideal Capacitor
The ideal capacitor (see Figure 11.1e for symbol) is a component that stores charge.
Its basic physical form is two parallel, overlapping, conducting plates separated by
a narrow insulating gap. It is characterized by the following equations:
time domain
(11.2)
frequency domain
(11.3)
Notice that Equation 11.3 resembles Equation 11.1, but with the R replaced
by 1/jωC. When performing frequency domain analysis, it is often convenient to
transform the entire circuit into the frequency domain by replacing C with 1/jωC
and then essentially applying Ohm’s law to derive the equations.
From Equation 11.2 it can be seen that an inﬁnite current is required to cause
an instantaneous change in voltage. This is impossible in practice, so it will always
take time to charge or discharge capacitors. (Note that this illustrates one of their
applications: smoothing out unwanted oscillations in voltage supply lines.)
From Equation 11.3 it can be seen that at high frequencies (large ω), the
capacitor appears to be a short circuit. For low frequencies (DC conditions), the
capacitor appears to be an open circuit. (Note that the frequency domain analysis
works only for sinusoidal signals.)
11.1.1.5
The Ideal Inductor
Inductors (Figures 11.1f) store energy in a magnetic ﬁeld. They are commonly wound
coils. The ideal inductor can be described by Equation 11.4 and Equation 11.5:
time domain
(11.4)
frequency domain
(11.5)
Impedance, Resistance, and Reactance
Complex numbers in the frequency domain are referred to as impedances. An
impedance (complex number) is made up of a real (or resistive) part and an
imaginary (or reactive) part. It has already been seen that the reactive compo-
nent may be a capacitance (i.e., a capacitive reactance), an inductance (see
next section), or a combination of both.

Notice that an instantaneous change in current requires an inﬁnite voltage
drop across the inductor. If an attempt is made to switch an inductive load (a
circuit that is being electrically powered and contains an inductive element) off,
the current has to go somewhere. In the absence of any provision made for this,
it will break down the insulation of the switch, causing a spark (arc).
Also note that the inductor is a short circuit to DC and an open circuit at
high frequencies.
11.1.1.6 The Ideal Voltage Source
The ideal constant-voltage source (Figure 11.1g) will maintain a constant voltage
drop across its terminals, no matter what. This means current may ﬂow into or
out of either terminal, and it can even supply the practically impossible inﬁnite
current necessary to charge a capacitor instantaneously. (This makes it somewhat
similar to an ideal wire with a constant voltage drop placed across it.)
11.1.1.7
The Ideal Current Source
The ideal constant-current source (Figure 11.1h and Figure 11.1i) will maintain
a constant current ﬂow in the direction indicated by the arrow, no matter what
voltage drop appears across it. (This makes it somewhat similar to an ideal open
circuit with a constant current ﬂowing through it.)
The previous descriptions may be a little counterintuitive (current ﬂowing
through an open circuit?), but they are useful. Deeper consideration of the con-
cepts introduced in this section will reveal other useful qualities or analogies,
some of which will become apparent later (see the book by Bogart for a complete
introduction to the subject [1]).
11.1.1.8
Controlled Sources
Often, the voltage or current in one part of a circuit is mathematically related to
a voltage or current in another. This is represented in the circuit diagram by the
More Units
•
Resistance is measured in ohms — Ω
•
Capacitance is measured in farads — F
•
Inductance is measured in henries — H 
Note on Strange-Seeming Analogies
In the case of the ideal current source, it can be found in Subsection 11.1.1.2
that no current will ﬂow through an open circuit irrespective of the voltage
dropped across it. Turning the analogy around, one could argue that the open
circuit is a special case of the ideal current source, one with a 0-A current rating.

244
Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
controlled voltage and current sources (Figure 11.1j and Figure 11.1k). In this
case, the voltage appearing across the terminals (or current ﬂowing through the
component) is mathematically related to some other parameter in the circuit —
the relationship normally being noted next to the source. Otherwise, these ideal
components exhibit the same properties as the constant sources mentioned before.
Controlled sources appear in models for amplifying components, where the output
is some multiple of the input, for example.
11.1.1.9
Power Calculations
Power can be computed by multiplying the voltage drop across a circuit element
by the current passing though it:
(11.6)
In the case of a resistor (or resistive load), this equation can be readily
employed to yield the power dissipated by the component. Ohm’s law can be
employed to transform Equation 11.6, in which case it will be seen that the power
dissipated is equal to the square of the current multiplied by the value of the
resistor; one may conclude that reducing the current ﬂowing through a resistive
element is most effective in reducing the power dissipated. In the case of reactive
loads (capacitive or inductive loads), the same equation may be employed, but
the power will depend on the waveform being applied.
If Equation 11.6 is applied to voltage or current sources, it will normally
yield a negative result — the voltage drop across the circuit element being in
opposition to current ﬂow. This indicates that the source is supplying energy
to the circuit, not dissipating it. As capacitors and inductors both store energy,
they extract energy from the circuit (positive value) during one part of the
cycle and deliver it (negative value) during another part of the cycle (the signs
noted in parentheses being correct if normal sign conventions have been
followed).
11.1.1.9.1
Switching Losses
The ideal switch acts either as a short circuit (on state) or open circuit (off state).
In either state, no power would be dissipated by the switch. The nonideal switch
(in this case the transistor can be considered when employed in a switching
capacity) would appear as a very-low-value resistor when in the on state and a
very high value resistor when in the off state. It would therefore dissipate some
power when in either (static) state. During the act of switching, however, the
current rises (or falls) as the voltage dropped across the switch falls (or rises).
At high switching frequencies, this dynamic power dissipation (power dissipated
during a change of state) is typically greater than the static power dissipation.
This is particularly true when highly capacitive loads are involved because the
time taken to charge and discharge the capacitance through the (ideal and non-
ideal) resistances in the circuit and, hence, the time taken for the switch to open
or close will be relatively long.

Components in Series and Parallel
Component elements may be placed in series (Figure 11.4a, Figure 11.4c, and
Figure 11.4e) or parallel (Figure 11.4b, Figure 11.4d, and Figure 11.4f). Consid-
eration of Equation 11.1 to Equation 11.5 and Figure 11.4 will show that several
instances of the same component connected together in such a network will have
the same combined effect as a single instance of that component of a value

11.1.1.11 Kirchoff’s Laws
The consideration alluded to in the previous section gives rise to Kirchoff’s
current and voltage laws. Simply stated, the current law states that current cannot
simply appear from or vanish into nothing. The voltage law does the same for
voltages.
Kirchoff’s current law, more formally, states that the sum of currents ﬂowing
into a node (a junction between components) must be zero. In Figure 11.5a:
(11.13)
It should be recalled that when analyzing a circuit and computing the actual
value of a current, a positive result means that the current actually ﬂows in the
direction indicated, i.e., into the node, and a negative result will indicate that the
current in fact ﬂows in the direction opposite to that indicated, i.e., out of the node.
Figure 11.5b shows the junction between just two components, two resistors,
marked up for analysis such that:
(11.14)
Clearly, at any instant that the circuit is in operation the current will ﬂow into
the node through the one resistor and the same current will ﬂow out through the
other (unless, of course, no current at all ﬂows). This is the same as saying that
the same current ﬂows through both resistors, and Kirchoff’s current law formal-
izes this for multiple currents (components).
Kirchoff’s voltage law states that the sum of voltage drops around a closed
path in a circuit must be equal to zero. This is explained in Figure 11.6. Consid-
ering Figure 11.6a, it is apparent that the voltage dropped across the circuit
enclosed by the box, VAB, must be equal to the source voltage (VSOURCE). Starting
at node A in the circuit and working clockwise, applying Kirchoff’s voltage law,
it can be seen that:
(11.15)
Notice that the source voltage appears with a negative sign in the equation.
This is because in working clockwise around the circuit the voltage dropped

across the source is being considered from node B to node A, which is in the opposite
sense to the polarity marked for the source. Rearrangement of Equation 11.15 will
show what was suspected all along, that VAB = VSOURCE.
The box in Figure 11.6a in fact contains three resistors in series (Figure 11.6b).
It now makes more sense to apply Kirchoff’s voltage law, giving:

The statement of Kirchoff’s laws within this section is not the formal deﬁ-
nition but a form that the author has found to be of most practical use in circuit
analysis.
11.2 OP-AMP
The op-amp is the most convenient circuit element to employ in many analog
circuits. The symbol for the op-amps is shown in Figure 11.7. It has three
terminals, a noninverting input (marked with a plus sign), an inverting input
(marked with a minus sign), and an output. The component itself will have two
power supply connections; these are usually to the symmetrical positive and
negative supply rails (+15 V and –15 V, for instance). Some have additional

connections to allow certain (internal) parameters of the ampliﬁer itself to be
adjusted — an offset null being common.
The difference between the voltage applied to the noninverting input (VIN+)
and the inverting input (VIN) is commonly termed the error voltage, marked as
e in Figure 11.7. The op-amp has a very high open-loop gain, AOL, and the output
voltage is related to the input error voltage by the formula:
(11.18)
Open-loop gains in the region of 200,000 or greater are not unusual.
11.2.1 THE IDEAL OP-AMP
The ideal op-amp is principally characterized as having:
•
inﬁnite open-loop gain
•
inﬁnite input impedance
•
zero output impedance
Additional points can be appended to this list. Sufﬁce it to say that the two
inputs do nothing more than sense the voltages appearing at them, and the output
acts as a perfect voltage controlled voltage source.
FIGURE 11.7 Operational ampliﬁer.
Gain, Transconductance, and Transimpedance
The gain of a circuit is the ratio of the output parameter of interest to the input
parameter of interest. Normally this will be either the voltage gain (output
voltage/input voltage) or current gain (output current/input current); as a con-
sequence it is represented by a dimensionless number. Sometimes it will be
the ratio of the output current to the input voltage or the output voltage to the
input current. In the former of these two cases, it is commonly referred to as
the transconductance and normally measured in siemens, the unit of conduc-
tance (the reciprocal of resistance). In the latter, it is normally referred to as
transimpedance and measured in ohms. Examination of Equation 11.1 will
make it apparent as to why these terms and units are relevant.

The issue of inﬁnite open-loop gain appears nonsensical, but, in practice, it
means that for a noninﬁnite VOUT:
e → 0
as
AOL → ∞
(11.19)
This enables an ampliﬁer with an arbitrary closed-loop gain to be constructed
using an op-amp and two external resistors. Figure 11.8 shows an op-amp in
inverting conﬁguration with negative feedback (resistor RF being the feedback
resistor).
If an ideal ampliﬁer is assumed, no current ﬂows into or out of the inputs
(inﬁnite input impedance). Thus, by applying Kirchoff’s current law it can be
seen that the current ﬂowing through RF also ﬂows through R1. Furthermore,
given that the ideal op-amp has inﬁnite open-loop gain, from Equation 11.19 it
can be seen that the voltages at both input terminals of the ampliﬁer are the same.
As one of these (the noninverting input) is connected to 0 V (or ground, symbol-
ized by the three diminishing lines; the symbol is not normally labeled), it follows
that the voltage at the inverting input must also be 0 V. Applying Kirchoff’s
current law then gives:
(11.20)
This can be rearranged to give the classic equation for the closed-loop voltage
gain (ACL) of an ideal op-amp in inverting conﬁguration (Figure 11.8):
(11.21)
The gain of the resulting ampliﬁer is set by the ratio of the two resistors, and
it is called an inverting ampliﬁer because of the negative gain.

A similar analysis can be applied to the noninverting conﬁguration of
Figure 11.10, yielding:
(11.22)
Because the input signal is connected directly to the very-high-impedance
noninverting input of the op-amp in the noninverting conﬁguration and the gain
will be at least unity, it is common to see it used as a unity-gain buffer ampliﬁer,
the inverting input being connected directly to the output with no resistors
involved.

The Potential Divider
Although gains of less than unity can be achieved with an inverting ampliﬁer,
a signal that is too large can be more economically attenuated (reduced in
amplitude) by a potential (or voltage) divider. This consists of two resistors
in series (Figure 11.9), characterized by the equation:

Consideration of the concepts presented in the previous sections of this
chapter will show that if the object is to measure a voltage that arises from a
source that is not an ideal voltage source (i.e., it could be modeled as an ideal
voltage source — the signal that is to be measured — within a network incorpo-
rating at least one series resistor and possibly capacitive and inductive elements
as well), then connecting this source to an input with a ﬁnite impedance will
degrade the signal; exactly what will happen will depend on the nature of the
source and the input impedance of the measuring circuit.
11.2.1.1
Nonideal Sources, Inverting, and Noninverting 
Op-Amp Conﬁgurations
Op-amps are used to condition signals from sensor elements. For the most part,
these are not going to be ideal voltage or current sources. Most nonideal voltage
sources can be modeled as an ideal voltage source, Vs, in series with a source
Decibels
Gains are often expressed in decibel units. These are formally deﬁned in terms
of power:
gain in dB
It is, however, more common to ﬁnd voltage gains expressed in dB:
gain
Filter cutoff points (Section 11.3 of this chapter) are taken to be the
frequencies at which attenuation is by a factor of 3 dB. Beyond this, attenuation
may well increase by a factor that is a multiple of –20 dB per decade (i.e.,
the signal is attenuated by an additional 20 dB, 40 dB, 60 dB, etc., for every
factor-of-ten increase in frequency, depending on the design of the ﬁlter). 
Power Transfer
In many cases, it is required to transfer maximum power from the source to
the input of the measuring circuit. In this case, the input impedance of the
measuring circuit should be the same as the output impedance of the source.

impedance, Zs, as illustrated in Figure 11.11a. The nonideal current source is
illustrated in Figure 11.11b. For simplicity, only a nonideal voltage source with
a resistive source impedance (source resistance, Rs) will be considered, as illus-
trated in Figure 11.12. This is a very common model for a signal source.
Returning to Figure 11.10, it can be seen that the input signal is connected
directly to the high-impedance input of the op-amp. When the nonideal source
of Figure 11.12 is connected to this conﬁguration (Figure 11.13a), it is apparent
that no current, ideally, ﬂows through Rs. It follows that there is no voltage drop
across Rs, and therefore VIN+ = Vs. In other words, the ideal circuit ampliﬁes the
signal of interest, Vs, according to Equation 11.22.
Turning to Figure 11.8, it is apparent in the inverting ampliﬁer conﬁguration,
the source “sees” one end of R1. It has already been noted that in this case, VIN
will be the same as VIN+, which in this case is tied to 0 V. The source sees the
resistor, R1, connected to ground. In Figure 11.13b, it can be seen that Rs and
R1 form a voltage divider (see box titled “The Potential Divider”) that attenuates
the signal of interest before it can be ampliﬁed. This has noise implications, as
will be discussed later, as well as design implications.
The overall gain of the circuit will, therefore, be dependent on Rs. As this is
beyond the designer’s control, the noninverting conﬁguration is preferred. The
noninverting conﬁguration is also used to buffer voltage dividers and ﬁlters
constructed using passive components (capacitors, inductors, and resistors) before
the signals enter the next stage of a circuit.

11.2.2 NONIDEAL OP-AMPS
Op-amps must be supplied with appropriate power rails. One obvious problem
with this is that the output voltage cannot swing beyond those of the rails. The
circuit must be designed and supplied with appropriate power rails so that under
normal (expected) operating conditions the outputs do not saturate — that is, the
output does not drive to go beyond the power rails. Common situations in which
this may occur are:
• At the input stage, when a signal is buried in noise that will be ﬁltered
out in later stages. If the gain is such that the ampliﬁed noise causes
the output to saturate, then the input signal will be lost.
• Where a small AC signal is superimposed on a large DC offset, in such
a case an AC-coupled ampliﬁer may be employed (see following text).
A further limit on the output stage of the op-amp is that it can only supply
(source or sink — source refers to currents ﬂowing out of the device and sink to
currents ﬂowing in) limited current (±10 mA, for example). This limitation will
be dealt with in Chapter 13.
Op-amps also exhibit an offset voltage, i.e., a nonzero output when the output
is expected to be 0 V. This is due to asymmetries within the circuitry itself, as it
is never possible to achieve a perfect match between two components. Some op-
amps are designed to have tolerably low offsets, others may be laser-trimmed to

minimize offsets, and still others have provision for an external potentiometer
(variable resistor) to be attached so that the offset can be adjusted once the circuit
has been built. Even without this provision, it is always possible to design an
external circuit that will accommodate offsets. (For production versions, the
design should avoid potentiometers, as the time taken to set them up adds con-
siderably to the ﬁnal costs).
11.2.2.1
Bandwidth Limitations and Slew Rate
The incredibly high gain of the op-amp leaves it susceptible to instability, unless
something is done to prevent this.
When discussing the capacitor (Subsection 11.1.1.4), it was noticed that at high
frequencies the capacitor appeared as a short circuit. In an electrical circuit there
are lots of parasitic (unwanted) capacitors where two conductors run near to one
another. There may also be inductive loops that allow one signal to couple mag-
netically to another. If the op-amp exhibited its incredibly high gain at all frequen-
cies, it is quite likely that high-frequency signals at the output would couple back
to the input through these routes and cause the whole system to oscillate.
Therefore, op-amps normally only operate at their maximum open-loop gain
up to a few hertz (1 Hz to 10 Hz is typical). Thereafter, the open-loop gain of the
ampliﬁer drops off at, usually, about 20 dB per decade. The frequency at which the
gain becomes 1 (i.e., unity) can be found from the gain–bandwidth product listed
in the ampliﬁer’s data sheet. Typically, this will be in the 1 MHz to 10 MHz range.
The op-amps chosen must have sufﬁcient open-loop gain at the frequency of
interest for it to operate. As the open-loop gain approaches the closed-loop gain,
the op-amp will cease to approximate an ideal one and the design equations
discussed previously will fail. Most modern op-amps will operate at moderate
closed-loop gains up to frequencies in the 100-kHz range or above, and ampliﬁers
with hundreds of megahertz bandwidth are available, although special care has
to be taken when designing circuits that involve such high frequencies.
It may sometimes be found that although an op-amp with sufﬁcient gain–band-
width product has been selected, the circuit still fails to function as expected, with
the output waveform being distorted in shape — particularly for square and other
non-sinusoidal waves. This is due to another limiting parameter of the nonideal op-
amp, the slew rate. This is the maximum rate at which the output of the ampliﬁer
can change and is usually expressed in volts per microsecond. It can be thought of
as the op-amp’s ability to track a fast-moving input signal.
Gain–Bandwidth Product and Slew Rate
•
The gain–bandwidth product (in Hz) gives the frequency at which
the open-loop gain of the op-amp drops to unity.
•
The slew rate (in V/µsec) is the maximum rate of change that the
op-amp output is capable of.

Ampliﬁers and Filtering
255
Slew rate problems are commonly encountered when the op-amp is being
asked to drive a rapidly changing signal over a signiﬁcant part of its output voltage
range. The following example illustrates the difference between slew rate and
gain–bandwidth product.
Consider a circuit with a closed-loop gain of 100, supplied by ±12-V power
rails. The op-amp chosen has a gain–bandwidth product (also known as ft) of
10 MHz and a slew rate of 1 V/µsec. It is intended to amplify a 100-kHz sinusoidal
signal.
Working backwards from ft at 10 MHz, assuming a 20 dB per decade change
in open-loop gain (up to the maximum rated open loop gain), it can be seen that
the open-loop gain will be 10 at 1 MHz and 100 at 100 kHz, ample for this
application. If the input signal is 0.1 V in amplitude (0.2 V peak to peak), then
the output signal will be 1 V in amplitude, and it is found that this is the case in
practice.
If, instead, a 1-V amplitude signal is applied to the circuit, then it would be
logical to expect a 10-V amplitude signal to appear on the output — the
gain–bandwidth product is sufﬁcient, as are the power rails. In practice, however,
this is not so due to the slew rate limitation.
With a 0.1-V amplitude input signal, the output swings from 0 to 1 V in one
quarter of a cycle, and it changes by 1 V every 2.5 µsec (or 0.4 V/µsec). This is
within the maximum 1 V/µsec slew rate rating. With the 1-V amplitude signal
applied to the input, however, the output is forced to swing from 0 to 10 V every
quarter cycle (i.e., 10 V every 2.5 µsec or 4 V/µsec). The output stage of the
ampliﬁer simply cannot keep up, so although there is sufﬁcient open-loop gain
available, the slew rate limits the output performance.
11.2.2.2
Input Impedance and Bias Currents
Although op-amps do have ﬁnite input impedances, these are usually incredibly
high, and circuit design can boost these further. Some op-amps have rated input
resistances that approach, or are in excess of, the resistance between the two pins
of the socket into which the chip may be inserted. Where input impedance is of
concern, it will attenuate signals in a potential divider effect. The input capaci-
tance of op-amps may be of greater concern when considering high frequencies,
or even high-impedance or high-capacitive sources. Data sheets of precision op-
amps (e.g., the OPA111) usually provide design guidelines to maximize the
performance of the integrated circuit (IC) in various circumstances.
Another factor at the input stage that may be of concern in bioMEMS and
sensing applications, but is not often dealt with in textbooks on electronics, is the
question of input bias currents. These are seen in electronics more as an annoyance,
part of the nonideal aspect of the circuit, i.e., something that has to be compensated
for but not something that could damage a system. In some biochemical situations,
the passage of unknown currents, no matter how small, could not only cause
erroneous results but could also degrade (micro)electrodes through unpredictable
electrochemical activity. They, therefore, need to be understood and dealt with.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
Input bias currents arise because the transistors in the input stage of the
ampliﬁer need small currents in order to operate correctly. There are three types
of input stages: bipolar junction transistor (BJT), junction ﬁeld effect transistor
(JFET), and metal-oxide-semiconductor ﬁeld effect transistor (MOSFET). Their
selection is summarized in Table 11.1.
The best op-amps for most sensing applications will be precision BJT ampli-
ﬁers with either JFET or MOSFET input stages, depending on the input imped-
ance and bias current requirements. Once past the initial stage, however, the
requirements can usually be relaxed and cheaper op-amps can be used (the 741
op-amp, for example, is an old workhorse and very well known, often, the
performance of other op-amps are summarized by the way they relate to the 741).
11.2.2.3
Common-Mode Rejection Ratio and Power
Supply Rejection Ratio
Two further parameters that are often quoted with respect to ampliﬁer perfor-
mance are the common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) and power supply rejection
ratio (PSRR).
Op-amps and some other forms of ampliﬁer have both inverting and nonin-
verting inputs. If the same signal were to be applied simultaneously to both inputs,
then the output expected would be zero. This is important in sensing applications
in which remote signals (radio signals or the main power supply, for example,
the latter appearing as an interfering signal at 60 Hz, or 50 Hz in Europe) couple
into the leads attaching the sensor to the ampliﬁer and interfere with the signal
of interest. If the two leads follow exactly the same path, then the same signal
should be induced in both leads and rejected by the ampliﬁer. The CMRR of the
ampliﬁer is a measure of its ability to perform this. Instrumentation ampliﬁers,
dealt with in a following section, are designed to have high CMRRs.
The power rails supplying an ampliﬁer should ideally be absolutely smooth
and without any variations from their speciﬁed voltages. This is practically impos-
sible to achieve, as the switching or drawing of large currents in one part of the
circuit will be reﬂected by glitches and variations in the power rails in other parts
of the circuit. The PSRR is a measure of the ampliﬁer’s ability to ignore such
variations.

These and many other nonideal aspects of ampliﬁers are dealt with in textbooks
on electronics in greater depth. Particularly recommended to the reader is The Art
of Electronics by Horowitz and Hill, an excellent and comprehensive textbook [2].
11.2.3 NOISE
There are many different sources of noise in electronic circuits that corrupt the
signals being measured or the accurate output of driving signals. Many noise
sources are characterized as white noise. This is essentially a random signal, and
is characterized by having equal signal power at all frequencies. Notice that this
means that a true white noise signal would have inﬁnite power, so such a thing
does not exist. Nevertheless, it is a convenient model to use.
The amplitude of a white noise source is given as its root mean square (rms)
amplitude, called the noise density.
11.2.3.1
Combining White Noise Sources
When working out the overall performance of a system, it is necessary to combine
several noise sources. Assuming that the signals are uncorrelated, that is to say
that they have no mathematical relationship to one another, and as they are
represented by rms amplitudes, they cannot be combined by simple addition. To
combine two or more noise sources, the noise densities are squared, and the
square root of the sum is taken to give the noise density of the combined source.
Consider, for example, the two voltage noise sources in Figure 11.14. Here, the
equivalent total noise density is given as:
 
(11.23)
Root Mean Square
This is the value used in power calculations for AC signals (e.g.,
). It
is calculated as the name indicates. For any signal, square the required param-
eter (multiply it by itself), compute the mean (the average level over one period
or cycle), and then calculate the square root of this value.

11.2.3.2 Thermal Noise
The white noise (or Johnson noise) exhibited across the terminals of an open
circuit resistor is given by:
(11.24)
where Vn is the noise voltage; k Boltzmann’s constant (1.38 × 1023 J K1); T, the
absolute temperature in Kelvin; R, the resistance; and B, the equivalent noise
bandwidth. The noise source will be bandwidth limited, and the noise bandwidth
is that of a perfect bandpass ﬁlter through which the noise will theoretically, be
measured (Figure 11.15 shows the response of an ideal ﬁlter). For a 1-k resistor
at room temperature (293 K), the noise voltage is given as:
 Vrms 
(11.25)
or
 nV/√Hz 
(11.26)
As the bandwidth is not known until the component is placed into a circuit,
noise performance is often quoted on data sheets and elsewhere in units of V/√Hz.
11.2.4 OP-AMP APPLICATIONS
A variety of different op-amp circuits are illustrated in Figure 11.16. Of these,
the inverting conﬁguration and noninverting conﬁgurations have been dealt with
in Subsection 11.2.1.
11.2.4.1 The Unity-Gain Buffer Ampliﬁer
From Equation 11.22, it can be seen that a noninverting ampliﬁer conﬁguration
must have a closed-loop gain of at least 1. Moreover, the input impedance is the
very high input impedance of the op-amp itself (in the case of the inverting
conﬁguration, it is equivalent to the input resistor). The circuit of Figure 11.16c

is often used to “buffer” a signal from a nonideal source, before it is fed through
further signal processing circuitry (ﬁlters, etc.) — the output stage from the op-
amp is normally expected to be much better than the source itself.
Notice from the foregoing discussion on noise, if a noninverting ampliﬁer
with any gain above unity can be used and any ﬁltering technique can be
employed, then this would be even better as the ﬁrst stage in a signal conditioning
circuit. A simple unity-gain buffer (Figure 11.16c) would only be employed if
high-amplitude noise was expected to swamp the signal prior to ﬁltering. In such
a situation, ampliﬁcation at this initial stage may cause the output of the ampliﬁer

to saturate (drive to the positive or negative power rail) because of the ampliﬁed
noise, and the desired signal would be lost each time this happened. A typical
example of such noise in sensitive measurement applications is interference from
the main electricity supply (at 60Hz, or 50Hz in Europe), which may well be
picked up by the initial stage of sensitive instruments (try waving an oscilloscope
probe around in the air sometime).
11.2.4.2 AC-Coupled Ampliﬁers
So far, all the op-amp circuits considered have been DC-coupled ampliﬁers. If a
ﬁxed voltage were to be coupled to the input of either the inverting, noninverting,
or buffer ampliﬁer conﬁgurations (Figure 11.16a to Figure 11.16c), then a ﬁxed
voltage would appear at the output. In Subsection 11.1.1.4, it was noted that the
capacitor can appear to be a short circuit at high frequencies and an open circuit
at low frequencies. This means that it can be used to block DC signals and only
pass AC signals. This is particularly useful when a small alternating signal of
interest is superimposed on a large DC offset, perhaps due to electrochemical
action, or maybe the AC signal is being used to measure a parameter that is being
controlled by a (lower-frequency) DC signal.
Figure 11.16d shows a noninverting ampliﬁer conﬁguration with capacitors
added to block DC signals. This is termed an AC-coupled ampliﬁer.
The AC-coupled ampliﬁer in Figure 11.16d has a ﬁnite input impedance at
high frequencies (the capacitor represents an inﬁnite resistance at low or DC
frequencies). The magnitude of this impedance should approximate to Rin at the
frequencies of interest, the capacitor being selected so that at these frequencies
the magnitude of the capacitive reactance is much smaller than the value of the
resistor, that is:
(11.27)
Obviously, there will be a signal frequency below which the capacitor will
represent a signiﬁcant impedance (i.e., will block the signal) and above which it
will pass the signal. This occurs at:
(11.28)
Notice that frequency is given in radians per second (conventionally symbol-
ized using ω). To obtain the frequency in hertz (i.e., cycles per second, normally
symbolized by f), divide by a factor of 2π. The component values should be
selected so that this cutoff frequency is at least an order of magnitude below the
frequencies of interest. This is, in fact, a rudimentary ﬁlter — the design of ﬁlters
is dealt with in the following sections.

261
The question arises as to why one would want to place Rin in the circuit
in any case. The op-amp in a noninverting conﬁguration has a very high input
impedance. If Rin were to be taken out of the circuit, it would be reasonable
to assume that an AC-coupled ampliﬁer with very high input impedance and
a very low cutoff frequency would result. Rin takes into account other nonideal
qualities of real op-amps, speciﬁcally, input bias currents. These are DC
currents that ﬂow through the inputs of the ampliﬁer, and are normally insig-
niﬁcantly small (BJT input ampliﬁers have the highest bias currents, JFET
next, and MOSFET the lowest). Without the presence of Rin, there would be
nowhere for these currents to ﬂow, and the input would ﬂoat to one rail or the
other, saturating the output (imagine a very small current ﬂowing through a
very high resistance, in this case, the parasitic resistance of the capacitor —
no component is perfect). Even with Rin, these currents will still ﬂow, although
they will ﬂow to 0 V via the resistor and only a very small offset voltage will
appear at the input. The ampliﬁer and Rin should be chosen so that this offset
is maintained within reasonable limits (i.e., will not cause the ampliﬁer to
saturate). An input resistor is even recommended with MOSFET input op-
amps. Although the bias currents are inﬁnitesimally small, it is better that they
ﬂow to ground through a known path rather than an uncontrolled path across
the circuit board.
The ﬁnal point to note is that the bandwidth (cutoff frequency) of the output
will be limited by the input resistance (or impedance) of the next stage.
11.2.4.3 Summing Ampliﬁers
It is possible to design op-amp circuits that perform a variety of mathematical
functions. The basic circuits, of course, perform multiplication by a constant.
Figure 11.16e shows a simple summing ampliﬁer conﬁguration. It will be recalled
from Subsection 11.2.1 that the inverting input of the op-amp must be more or
less at 0 V (this is sometimes called a virtual earth or virtual ground). Following
an analysis similar to that carried out in Subsection 11.2.1 for the inverting
ampliﬁer conﬁguration, it can be shown that
(11.29)
Clearly, if all the resistors are of the same value, then Vo will be the negative
sum of the two input voltages. Further study will show that any number of signals
can potentially be combined in this manner.
11.2.4.4
Integrators and Differentiators
Figure 11.16f shows a theoretical integrator circuit, and Figure 11.16g shows a
theoretical differentiator. These circuits are, for various reasons, not suitable for
practical implementation, but they can be readily analyzed by assuming an ideal

op-amp. In Figure 11.16f, the current that ﬂows through the feedback capacitor
must be the same as that ﬂowing through the resistor, and the inverting input will
be a virtual earth. Equation 11.2 can be rearranged to give the current ﬂowing
through a capacitor in terms of the time domain derivative of the voltage across
it. The analysis will yield:
(11.30)
Thus, the circuit effectively integrates the input (and scales it). A similar
analysis can be carried out on Figure 11.16g with the result that
(11.31)
As they stand, these circuits are not practical. Bias currents and offset voltages
in the integrator will cause the output to drift over time, as will the charge leakage
from the capacitor. Also, when performing a mathematical integration, an initial
condition must normally be met, i.e., the capacitor must be charged to some initial
value. It is common practice to use a switch to reset (discharge) the capacitor,
but for accurate work, the circuit has to be carefully designed and offsets and
biases minimized. The integrator circuit, and before that, electromechanical inte-
grators, used to be the key element in analog computers created to solve complex
differential equations. Owing to the practical problems of implementing these
solutions, however, digital computers are now almost exclusively used to solve
such problems.
The differentiator was never a popular circuit element, principally because it
tends to be unstable. Remembering that a capacitor appears to be a short circuit to
high-frequency signals and drawing an analogy between Figure 11.16g and Figure
11.16a, it is apparent that the differentiator will have very high gain at high fre-
quencies. As these are easily picked up from the environment (for example, radio
signals, other electronic equipment, electrostatic discharges, from humans), it is
normal to add components to limit the bandwidth of the differentiator.
Although these circuits are little used for signal conditioning, they are still of
interest as very rudimentary ﬁlters, as can be seen by considering the nature of the
capacitor at high and low frequencies and drawing parallels with the inverting
ampliﬁer circuit: the integrator is a low-pass ﬁlter (allowing low frequencies through
and attenuating high frequencies) and the differentiator is a high-pass ﬁlter. Simi-
larly, it can be seen that ﬁlters have some element of integration or differentiation
in their function. Filters are treated in some detail in Section 11.5.

11.2.4.5 Other Functions
It is clear from the foregoing discussion that various mathematical functions
can be implemented using op-amps, provided that a component with an
appropriate response can be placed in the feedback circuit. One additional
function that used to be fairly common was the logarithm (and antilog) circuit,
which made use of the logarithmic response of the BJT. These would facilitate
the multiplication and division of two signals. However, with the advent of
powerful digital signal processors and computing techniques, coupled with
the difﬁculty of designing stable and accurate analog circuits and their inﬂex-
ible nature, most signal processing has now migrated to the digital domain.
This is dealt with in Chapter 12.
There are times when it may be desirable to compare one signal with a
threshold level; this function is accomplished using a comparator circuit. Ded-
icated comparator ICs are usually faster or have specialized outputs with lower
open-loop gains than op-amps. These, or op-amp comparators, are usually
operated with a little positive feedback so that noisy signals do not cause rapid
repeated switching of the output as the signal approaches and passes the thresh-
old; i.e., some hysteresis is introduced. This conﬁguration is known as a Schmitt
trigger.
The op-amp is the fundamental building block of hundreds of useful circuits:
oscillators, level detectors, ﬁlters, etc. Only some of these are dealt with here,
but many ideas can be found in Horowitz and Hill [2] or the many books on
hobby electronics that are available.
11.3 INSTRUMENTATION AMPLIFIERS
The concept of CMRR was introduced in Subsection 11.2.2.3 for op-amps; it
describes how good the circuit is at removing a signal that appears simultaneously
on both inputs.
Many sensors are particularly bad signal sources; they often produce very
small signals with very high source impedances, subject to drift, and, worse
still, they are often connected to the nearest ampliﬁer by a long cable. Cables
are particularly susceptible to picking up stray signals radiated from a variety
of sources. The worst offenders are electronic equipment, especially comput-
ers, televisions, cell phones, and the main power supply. Heavy industrial
equipment and electric motors are even worse. Often these signals can be
ﬁltered out, but this assumes ﬁrst that the interfering signal is smaller than the
signal of interest (otherwise, the ﬁrst stage ampliﬁers may saturate) and second
that it is well outside the frequency range of interest. Even so, there are
situations in which a differential measurement is preferable to an absolute
measurement.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
The basic single-op-amp differential ampliﬁer circuit is shown in Figure 11.17.
Strictly speaking, this is a differential input ampliﬁer — the output is single ended
(i.e., not differential). Truly differential ampliﬁers do exist, but they are relatively
uncommon. The disadvantage of this circuit for use in sensor applications is imme-
diately apparent: it has a low input impedance. For this reason, the three-op-amp
circuit, or instrumentation ampliﬁer, is used (Figure 11.18).
FIGURE 11.17 Basic differential ampliﬁer.
Differential and Absolute Values
An absolute value is measured with respect to a speciﬁc reference point,
usually the equipment’s 0 V or ground line. Two wires will connect the sensor
to the input of the instrumentation: the signal wire and ground.
A differential value is the difference between two measured values
(e.g., voltage A minus voltage B). So if the absolute value of signal A with respect
to 0 V is 1000 V and of signal B is 1001 V, the differential value will be 1 V.
Measurements are normally made with three wires — one to carry each signal
and one reference signal (often, but not always, 0 V). Without a ﬁxed reference,
the circuit will make up its own paths for stray currents, which causes many
problems.

Notice that the common-mode voltage may be tapped from the center of R1
(by making R1 two resistors of equal value). This can then be fed back as the
reference signal through the third connection (the shield connection of the cable)
to increase the input impedance of the circuit. 
Both the simple differential ampliﬁer and instrumentation ampliﬁer can be
purchased as single ICs. The gain is normally ﬁxed or adjusted by using an
external link or resistor. The internal circuitry should be laser-trimmed to provide
a very accurate circuit and eliminate the problems that may otherwise be expe-
rienced when creating a circuit from individual op-amps, such as component
tolerances and offsets.
11.4 WHEATSTONE BRIDGE
In many cases, small variations in the parameter to be sensed cause variations
in the impedance or resistance of a sensor element. These can be detected most
sensitively by use of a bridge conﬁguration, commonly called the Wheatstone
Bridge (Figure 11.19).
In practice, the voltmeter would be replaced by an instrumentation ampliﬁer.
The bridge consists of a measurement arm and a reference arm, and is initially
Cabling
If it is not possible to mount the sensor close to the signal-conditioning
equipment and digitize the signal as soon as possible, then the wrong choice
of cabling can result in interference problems. The basic choice is:
•
Twisted pair — two wires twisted together; good for fairly strong
signals in benign environments.
•
Screened cable — one or more signal wires with one or more
braided wire or foil screens; the screen will carry 0 V (ground) or
the reference signal; better immunity in noisy environments for
multiple signals.
•
Coaxial cable — one central core separated from a screen by an
insulating layer; both screen and the core share the same longitu-
dinal axis (hence the name); used for high frequency signals (hun-
dreds of kHz up).
•
Fiber-optics — uses light and not electrical current and is therefore
almost completely immune to electrical interference; drawbacks
include cost and difﬁculty of installing the system.
Note that the coaxial cable has a characteristic impedance (usually 50 ohms)
this needs to be matched by the driving circuit (50 ohms output impedance)
and receiving circuit (50 ohms input impedance), otherwise it will suffer from
signal distortions due to reﬂections, etc.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
adjusted so that it is balanced, i.e., the meter reads 0 V. Thereafter, any changes
in the resistance of the sensing element will cause the bridge to become unbal-
anced, and the magnitude of the change can be deduced and related to the change
in the parameter being sensed.
The bridge conﬁguration has a number of advantages, the most notable is
that it can be used to reduce the magnitude of interfering signals caused by
changes in parameters other than those being sensed. One good example of this
is where implanted piezoresistors are used to sense the bending of silicon beams
(e.g., those supporting seismic masses in accelerometers). These are also sensitive
to changes in temperature, and it is common to fabricate an additional dummy
beam upon which a reference resistor is implanted (Figure 11.20).
In some cases, closed-loop control is used to effect the sensing and extend the
range over which the sensor will operate. Figure 11.21 shows how this operates for
a thermal mass-ﬂow-rate sensor. Here, a heating element is cooled by the passage
of ﬂuid or gas. The rate of cooling is related to the mass-ﬂow rate of the substance
over a heated temperature-sensing element, commonly a platinum resistor. The
bridge is supplied with sufﬁcient current to ensure that the sensing element is heated
to its working temperature and balanced under zero-ﬂow conditions. As the sensing
element is cooled, the current ﬂowing through the bridge is increased to rebalance
the bridge, the current ﬂowing through the bridge being related to the rate of cooling
of the heating element and, hence, the mass-ﬂow rate. A larger reference sensor is
also included in the bridge to adjust for changes in the ambient temperature. This
must be much larger then the platinum-sensing element as it should not be heated
by the current ﬂow through the bridge.
11.4.1 THE CAPACITOR BRIDGE
It is quite easy to microengineer sensors that transduce mechanical changes into
changes in capacitance. Although these sensors are normally relatively precise,
the circuits necessary to measure changes in capacitance are more complex than
FIGURE 11.19 Wheatstone bridge; when the ratio of Rs to R3 is the same as R2:R1,
then the voltmeter will read 0 V and the bridge is said to be balanced; normally, a small
variable resistor (trimmer) is included in the bridge to balance it initially; then, any change
in Rs will result in a nonzero reading on the voltmeter.

by mounting an electrode below the mass and using the mass as the opposite pole); then,
under acceleration, the actuator is activated to force the mass back to its original position
and zero the bridge; acceleration is then measured by the drive level to the actuator.

those required to measure changes in resistance. If the expected value of the
capacitance is known or, better still, is controlled by feedback to remain at a ﬁxed
value, then a capacitance bridge can be used (Figure 11.22).
11.5 FILTERING
As discussed in Subsection 11.2.3, there are a large number of sources of electronic
and electrical noise that can interfere and obscure a weak signal that one is trying
to measure. Some of these will be white noise sources and some will be at a ﬁxed
frequency. The main power line interference at 60 Hz (in the U.S., or 50Hz in
Europe) is one example of the latter case that often causes problems. Furthermore,
Equation 11.24 suggests that by reducing the bandwidth of the system to the
minimum necessary, interference from white noise sources can be reduced.
Finally, it may be that the signal of interest is superimposed on another much
larger signal of a different frequency. One example would be where the aim is
to use the same set of electrodes to control the position of an electrostatic actuator
— a small AC measurement signal would be imposed upon a much larger DC
actuation signal. In this case, an AC-coupled ampliﬁer of the type discussed in
Subsection 11.2.4.2 may be appropriate. The AC-coupled ampliﬁer in Figure 11.16d
incorporates one of the simplest possible ﬁlters, the RC ﬁlter.
11.5.1 RC FILTERS
These employ a single resistor and a single capacitor, hence the term RC ﬁlter.
Both forms are shown in Figure 11.23 and have the following characteristics:

The functions of the circuits in Figure 11.23 should be clear by simply
examining them and substituting the capacitor with a short circuit at high fre-
quencies and an open circuit at low frequencies. They can also be explored by
examining the equations, but ﬁrst it is helpful to convert these into real and
imaginary parts by multiplying the numerator and denominator (by 1 jωCR), and
rearranging the terms:
From Equation 11.32:
(11.34)
and from Equation 11.33:
(11.35)
And ﬁnally converting these to magnitude and angle form:
From Equation 11.34:
(11.36)
and from Equation 11.35
(11.37)
Equation 11.36 and Equation 11.37 give a handle on the functioning of the
circuit in case of sinusoidal signals (this does not work for nonsinusoidal signals).
All the following discussion applies to Equation 11.36, but a similar working can
be applied to Equation 11.37. First, note that the magnitude of the resulting signal
will be related to the input signal by the factor √(1/(1 + ω2C2R2)). For DC signals,
(ω = 0), then the output will be the same as the input signal. For high frequency
signals, (ω → ∞), then the output will approach 0.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
Similarly, the phase of the output signal relative to that of the input signal
will be shifted by tan1(ωCR). So for DC signals, there will be no phase shift, but
at high frequency (ω → ∞) the phase shift will approach 90°.
Therefore, the circuit is, as suspected, a low-pass ﬁlter, and it is possible to
say that it exhibits a phase shift. The question that follows is: What is the cutoff
frequency of the ﬁlter? In other words, at what frequency of input signal does
the output signal start to become signiﬁcantly attenuated? Referring back to the
box entitled “Decibels,” it was suggested that a reduction in amplitude by 3 dB
was a useful measure of the ﬁlter cutoff point. By referring to this box, it will
be seen that this is equivalent to a loss of half the power of the signal, or an
attenuation of the signal amplitude by a factor of 1/√2 (approximately 0.707).
From Equation 11.36, it can be seen that this occurs when:
(11.38)
Notice also that at the cutoff frequency, the phase shift is 45°. By letting the
cutoff frequency be ω0, it is possible to go on to say that at one decade below ω0
(i.e., ω0/10) the amplitude of vo is approximately equal to the amplitude of vi and
the phase shift is close to 0. Similarly, for each decade (factor of 10) increase of
frequency above ω0, the amplitude of vo drops further by 20 dB, and at 10ω0 the
phase shift stabilizes at approximately 90°. This information is conveyed by a
“Bode plot” (Figure 11.24a). The same information is plotted for the high-pass
ﬁlter (Equation 11.37) in Figure 11.24b. Note that both these Bode plots have been
normalized by setting R = C = 1, giving a 3 dB point at ω = 1. The cutoff frequency
of both ﬁlters can, therefore, be set by selecting appropriate values of R and C:
(11.39)
Again, do not forget that ω0 is in radians per second. Divide this by 2π to get
the frequency in hertz. Also, note that if the next circuit element has a noninﬁnite
input impedance (i.e., is not an op-amp in the noninverting conﬁguration), it will
load the ﬁlter circuit and the resulting response will not be as predicted. Component
tolerances will also have some effect on the cutoff frequency.
Equation 11.29, then, allows one to design a simple RC ﬁlter with an arbitrary
cutoff frequency. This may be a high-pass or low-pass ﬁlter, depending on the
circuit architecture (Figure 11.23a or Figure 11.23b), which will have unity gain
in the pass band and attenuate the signal by 20 dB per decade in the stop band.
For a low-pass ﬁlter, the phase shift will be 0° in the pass band, increasing to
45° at the 3-dB point and to 90° in the stop band. For a high-pass ﬁlter, it will
be +90° in the stop band, falling to 45° at the 3-dB point and 0° in the pass band.
Of course, a simple low- or high-pass ﬁlter may be insufﬁcient for the
application in question. There are two other ﬁlter conﬁgurations that may be of
use, the band-pass ﬁlter and band-stop ﬁlter. These can be created by cascading
RC low-pass and high-pass ﬁlters with buffer ampliﬁers (see Figure 11.25a and
Figure 11.25c). Their characteristics can be quite easily determined by using the

Bode plot: draw the Bode plot for each separate element and then add them
together to give the combined ﬁlter Bode plot (Figure 11.25b and Figure 11.25d).
Notice that RC ﬁlters do not make particularly good ﬁlters, especially if
the signal of interest is at, e.g., 1 kHz and there is interference at 100 kHz that
is 100 times larger. In such a situation, one would desire the interfering signal
to be attenuated by a factor of 1000 (60 dB) so that its effect on the signal of
interest becomes negligible. Also, if the 3-dB point is chosen to be 1 kHz in order
to get maximum attenuation at 100 kHz, then:
1. The signal of interest will be attenuated by 3 dB.
2. The signal of interest will be distorted by a 45° phase shift.
3. The signal of interest can only be a sinusoidal signal, or close it will
be even more distorted.

To design a ﬁlter, it is necessary to ensure that the frequency of the signal of
interest lies well within the pass band and that the nearest interfering frequency
is sufﬁciently attenuated. This can be done by employing more complex ﬁlter
designs, as discussed in the following section.
11.5.2 BUTTERWORTH FILTERS
The RC ﬁlters dealt with in Subsection 11.5.1 are termed passive ﬁlters because
only passive components (a resistor and a capacitor) are required to implement
them. By incorporating inductors, it is possible to build very complex passive
ﬁlters. It is easier, however, to incorporate op-amps into the circuit to form active
ﬁlters; this became apparent in Subsection 11.5.1 when the buffer ampliﬁer was
introduced so that RC ﬁlters could be joined together without the ﬁrst section
being loaded by the following section.
There are three different types of continuous-time ﬁlters (as opposed to
switched-capacitor ﬁlters or digital ﬁlters, which sample the signal at discrete
points) in common use. These are the Butterworth, Bessel, and Chebyshev ﬁlters.
Nonsinusoidal Signals
The frequency domain analysis of ﬁlters is only applicable to sinusoidal
signals. Fortunately, however, most other signals of interest can be created
by adding up a number (inﬁnite number) of sinusoidal signals of different
amplitudes and phases. Determining the effect of the ﬁlter on nonsinusoidal
signals, therefore, involves determining how it affects each of the sinusoidal
components in terms of attenuation and phase shift (changing the relative
phase of the components will change the shape of the resulting signal, thus
it is important to consider phase effects as these can extend a long way
from the 3 dB point). Working out the sinusoidal components of signals is
performed by using Fourier analysis, or Fourier transforms. These are not
dealt with in this volume. Generally speaking, given a signal with a funda-
mental frequency of ω0 [i.e., 2π/(the time before the signal starts to repeat
itself; the period, in other words)], then signals that are similar in shape to
a sinusoidal wave will not have signiﬁcant components at very high fre-
quencies, whereas a rapidly changing signal such as a square wave will
have signiﬁcant components at two, four, six, and eight times the funda-
mental frequency. To avoid distortion, then, the 3 dB point of a low-pass
ﬁlter would need to be at least two decades beyond the fundamental fre-
quency, preferably more. Also, if this is an interfering signal, then a high-
pass ﬁlter would need to be chosen that is two or three decades (preferably
more) above ω0, so that high-frequency components of this signal do not
appear in the pass band.

They have the following characteristics:
•
Butterworth: maximal gain in the pass band, reasonable cutoff.
•
Bessel: minimal phase distortion, poor cutoff.
•
Chebyshev: controllable ripple in pass-band gain; this is traded off
against a steep initial cutoff (the more ripple that can be tolerated, the
sharper the initial cutoff).
These comments assume ﬁlters of equivalent complexity. Of these ﬁlters, the
Butterworth is relatively easy to synthesize, and is therefore introduced here.
There are a number of continuous–time-ﬁlter ICs on the market that use different
approaches to implement the different ﬁlter types. Given modern computing
power, however, for many transducer applications, complex continuous-time ﬁl-
ters are not required because digital ﬁltering and digital signal processing tech-
niques have taken their place.
The transfer function of a Butterworth ﬁlter takes the form:
(11.40)
The transfer function is a formal way of writing vout/vin. Bn is the appropriate
Butterworth polynomial selected from Table 11.2. The subscript n gives the
number of poles of the ﬁlter, a technical term also referred to as the order of the
ﬁlter. Here, it is only necessary to know that for each increase in n, the cutoff
rate increases by a further 20 dB per decade. For a single-pole ﬁlter, the gain
drops off at 20 dB per decade, for a two-pole ﬁlter it is 40 dB per decade, three
poles give 60 dB per decade, and so on. The fact that the equations are given as
a function of s will also be neglected for now. Note, however, that the frequency
response can be found by replacing s with jω.
Butterworth ﬁlters are relatively easy to deal with because only a ﬁrst-order
ﬁlter circuit and a second-order ﬁlter circuit are required. Higher-order ﬁlters
are made up by cascading combinations of ﬁrst- and second-order circuits.

Examples, based on the Sallen and Key ﬁlter, are shown in Figure 11.26. These
are low-pass ﬁlters; to make high-pass ﬁlters simply switch the Rs and Cs around.
Figure 11.27 shows the typical frequency response of one- and two-pole low-
pass Butterworth ﬁlters. Straight line approximations have been drawn to show
how the analytical responses deviate from these.

Notice that the 3 dB (cutoff) point occurs at ω = 1/RC and the signal is
attenuated by 20 dB per decade thereafter for the single-pole ﬁlter, and 40 dB
per decade for the two-pole ﬁlter. This 20-dB-per decade attenuation means that
for every factor of ten increase in signal frequency, the signal amplitude at the
output is reduced by a factor of 10. This is related to the number of ﬁlter poles
— after the 3 dB point, attenuation will be 20 dB per decade per pole (i.e., a
four-pole ﬁlter will attenuate the signal by 80 dB for every decade above the
3 dB point).
Furthermore, the phase shift of the ﬁlter is 45° at the 3 dB point for the
single-pole ﬁlter and 90° at the 3 dB point for the double-pole ﬁlter. The phase
shift will distort the signal for one decade on either side of the 3 dB frequency.
11.5.2.1
Synthesizing Butterworth Active Filters
The procedure described here is for synthesizing a low-pass ﬁlter. The procedure
for synthesizing high-pass ﬁlters is the same, but discussion will focus on the
lowest frequency of interest, as opposed to the highest.
The ﬁrst step is to decide the order of the ﬁlter. The maximum frequency
of interest and the lowest interfering frequency should be determined. The
magnitude of the interfering signal (at this frequency) should also be deter-
mined. To avoid phase distortion, it is best to place the 3 dB point at least one
decade (a factor of 10) above the highest frequency of interest, and the inter-
fering signal should be attenuated to a reasonable fraction of the signal of
interest, e.g., 10%. This will enable an estimate to be made of the number of
poles required for the ﬁlter.
Example
A very slowly changing signal is to be measured with a maximum frequency
of interest of 0.6 Hz. The signal has an amplitude of 50 mV. The main
interference is at 60 Hz from main power. Even with shielding, this signal
has an amplitude of 30 mV.
To avoid phase distortion, the cutoff frequency of the ﬁlter is selected to
be 6 Hz, thus a single-pole Butterworth ﬁlter will attenuate the main inter-
ference down to 3 mV (i.e., by a factor of 20 dB). It may be desirable to use
a two-pole ﬁlter just to be on the safe side. It will then be necessary to ﬁnd a
suitable resistor–capacitor combination for the ﬁlter, given that
 (it is
necessary to convert from hertz to radians per second).
Studying an electronics catalog will reveal that the desired combination
cannot be purchased, and a compromise will be necessary. Additionally, the
components will not have the exact resistance or capacitance marked; they will
vary by a given tolerance (±1%, ±5%, etc.) about the given value.

At this point the cutoff frequency,
 (in radians per second), has been
determined. From this it is possible to ﬁnd R and C from Equation 11.41. (A
likely value for one of the components is chosen, and the equation is rearranged
to give the value of the second).
(11.41)
At this point, the gain of the circuit needs to be determined. From Table 11.2
it can be seen that all orders of Butterworth ﬁlter can be obtained by cascading
ﬁrst- and second-order ﬁlter circuits. The polynomials in Table 11.2 have been
given for normalized ﬁlters, i.e.,
 and gain = 1. It is possible to write a
general version of the ﬁrst- and second-order equations as
(11.42)
and
(11.43)
respectively, where Av is the voltage gain of the stage. For a single-pole Butter-
worth ﬁlter stage, the gain is equal to unity. For a two-pole stage, the gain of the
stage is given by:
(11.44)
The value of 2ζ can be readily extracted from Table 11.2. Thus, a four-pole
Butterworth ﬁlter (of any cutoff frequency) can be made up of a couple of two-
pole ﬁlter stages, one with a gain of 2.235 (3 − 0.765) and the other with a gain
of 1.152.
Appropriate values can then be selected for the gain-setting resistors. In the
Sallen and Key ﬁlter (Figure 11.26), these act like a noninverting ampliﬁer:

11.5.2.2 Approximating the Frequency Response
of a Butterworth Filter
The frequency response of a ﬁlter is normally drawn on a log–log plot or a Bode
plot. This requires log–linear graph paper because the vertical scale, gain, is given
in decibels, which is a logarithmic unit (see box in Subsection 11.2.1). Phase
shift in degrees is plotted against logarithmic frequency.
First, the ﬁlter is examined to determine if it is high pass or low pass. Then
the pass-band gain is determined. This is converted to decibels and marked
temporarily on the graph paper.
The cutoff frequency is found, normally in hertz, from
 (or Equation
11.41 for radians per second). This is marked as a point on the graph at the pass-
band gain level.
The order (number of poles) of the ﬁlter is determined, giving the cutoff rate
(20 dB per decade per pole). If the ﬁlter is a low-pass ﬁlter, then a line is drawn
from the 3 dB point, sloping down to the right (increasing frequency) at this rate.
For a high-pass ﬁlter, the line slopes down to the left. The pass-band gain is then
drawn in as a horizontal line.
Finally, the phase part of the Bode plot is constructed. The cutoff frequency is
located again and a point marked beneath this on the graph paper. For a high-pass
ﬁlter this will be at 45° times the number of poles and for a low-pass ﬁlter -45°
multiplied by the number of poles. The frequencies one decade above and one decade
below this point are located. For a high-pass ﬁlter, the phase shift one decade or more
above this point is 0° and 90° multiplied by the number of poles one decade or more
below this point. For a low-pass ﬁlter, the phase shift one decade or more below this
point is 0° and 90° multiplied by the number of poles one decade or more above this
point. Some example Bode plots for different ﬁlters are given in Figure 11.28. 
FIGURE 11.28 Example Bode plots for high- and low-pass Butterworth ﬁlters; gain in
dB plotted against frequency (normalized) in radians per second, low-pass ﬁlters have a
pass-band gain of 10 (20 dB) and two poles (diamonds) and six poles (circles); high-pass
ﬁlters have a gain of 100 (40 dB) and two poles (triangles) and four poles (squares).

11.5.3 SWITCHED-CAPACITOR FILTERS
Dedicated ICs are available for continuous-time active ﬁlters; however, there are
problems with these, particularly for low-frequency operation. The cutoff fre-
quency is tuned by selection of a capacitor, which gives rise to two problems.
First high-tolerance capacitors cannot be easily fabricated in ICs, and the large
capacitors required for low-frequency (audio range) ﬁlters take up a lot of area
on the silicon die. Second, the cutoff frequency of the ﬁlter cannot be easily tuned
(as may be required in some microprocessor-controlled situations).
As was hinted at in the previous section, ﬁlters can be constructed using inte-
grator circuit elements. Consider the circuit in Figure 11.29. It can be shown that
the circuit has the following characteristic:
(11.46)
This is termed a switched-capacitor ﬁlter because of the manner in which it
operates — switching between two capacitors. It also chops up the input signal
in two, thus it is not a continuous-time ﬁlter (it is a discrete-time ﬁlter).The ﬁrst
thing to notice is that this depends upon the ratio of two capacitors and not their
absolute values. Although it is difﬁcult to fabricate a capacitor of a speciﬁc value
Group Delay
Group delay is a measure of the time that a signal of a particular frequency
takes to traverse a ﬁlter or another circuit element. It has a bearing on distortion
of the signal and is subtly different from phase shift. A phase shift of 45° in
a 1-kHz signal represents a delay of 0.125 msec, whereas the same phase shift
in a 10-kHz signal represents a delay of 0.0125 msec. Filters that apply an
appropriate phase shift to correct for group delay can be designed; this is
particularly important for signals that have traveled along long communication
lines.

on an IC, it is relatively easy to match components. Thus, it is relatively easy to
fabricate two capacitors in a ﬁxed ratio with a good degree of reproducibility.
Secondly, the operation is dependent on the frequency with which the switches
are opened and closed, so it is tunable.
Switched-capacitor ﬁlter ICs are available in a variety of conﬁgurations,
including high- and low-pass. There are, however, some problems with switched-
capacitor ﬁlters.
Switched-capacitor ﬁlters suffer from clock feedthrough. Noise appears at
the output signal at the same frequency as the clock signal. Ideally, this could be
removed by a simple continuous-time ﬁlter, but this may not always be possible.
Also, the ﬁlter suffers from aliasing: signals near (above) the switching frequency
are reﬂected down, below the switching frequency, and appear in the output signal
without being attenuated. Again, this has to be solved by a simple continuous-
time ﬁlter at the input. Finally, switched-capacitor ﬁlters tend to be noisier than
continuous-time ﬁlters.

12 Computer Interfacing
12.1 INTRODUCTION
During the device development stage, it soon becomes necessary to provide
microengineered devices with relatively complex signal-conditioning circuitry to
drive them or process the signals that they produce. These will normally be
produced by a computer equipped with analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog
converters. For commercial devices, at least some of the signal processing cir-
cuitry may be provided on chip, and often you will want to interface them to a
microcontroller for integration into a larger system.
This chapter aims to provide an outline of analog-to-digital and digital-to-
analog conversion, which will form the basis of such interfaces. Practical schemes
for posting the output levels of digital-to-analog converters and other circuits are
considered separately in Chapter 13.
12.1.1 NUMBER REPRESENTATION
Most used for representing numbers is the decimal system, which has ten digits
(0…9) arranged in columns, the rightmost column being the number of units one
has, the next column to the left being the number of tens, the next the number
of hundreds, and so on. So the number 143 has three units, four tens, and one
hundred. Adding these up, one hundred plus four tens plus three units, gives the
number one hundred and forty three. This may seem obvious, but computers and
digital circuits do not use the same number system; so it helps to state the obvious
before getting into the more complex. Notice, also, as one moves a column to
the left the signiﬁcance of the digit written there is 10 times that of the previous
one, or 10n, where n is the column number (starting from 0). Figure 12.1 shows
this.
Digital computers have only two digits available, 0 (0 V, off or low), and
1 (+5 V, on or high). These are termed binary digits, or bits; the number system
is binary (base 2), compared to the familiar decimal (or base 10) system. A group
of 8 bits is termed a byte. Proceeding from right (least signiﬁcant bit) to left
(most signiﬁcant bit), the value of each digit place doubles: units, twos, fours,
eights, etc., or 20, 21, 22, 23, etc. (Figure 12.2). So the number 10001111 in binary
represents: one one hundred and twenty eight, no sixty fours, no thirty twos, no
sixteens, one eight, one four, one two, and one unit. Adding these up, one hundred
and twenty eight plus eight plus four plus two plus one (128 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1) is
one hundred and forty three (143) in the decimal system.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
Writing everything out in binary gets a bit long winded; even quite small
numbers take up a lot of room. For this reason, hexadecimal (base 16) is often
used. This requires 16 digits, so 0…9 are supplemented with A to F (A being
ten, B being 11, …, and F being ﬁfteen). The reason that hexadecimal is used
is that four binary digits can be quickly converted to one hexadecimal digit
(Figure 12.3). 
12.2 DRIVING ANALOG DEVICES FROM DIGITAL 
SOURCES
Analog devices require a voltage (or current) level that can be varied according
to a digital demand signal. Ultimately, it is impossible to obtain a continuously
variable signal level from a digital demand signal; the output will be quantized.
The key to design is to ensure that the level of quantization is negligible and
that the rate at which the signal can be varied is high enough for the desired
application.

12.2.1 PULSE-WIDTH MODULATION (PWM)
One of the easiest ways to implement digital-to-analog conversion is the PWM
approach, because this only requires that the digital system produce two voltage
levels. As such, it can be relatively easily implemented, although its use is
restricted without additional analog-signal-conditioning circuitry.
Consider the signal displayed in Figure 12.4a. This is a square wave signal,
which could quite easily be produced from a digital circuit. The period for which

the signal is high is referred to as the mark and the period for which it is low as
the space. It is possible to calculate the average signal level from this:
(12.1)
It is normal to describe such signals in terms of mark–space ratio, because
the average signal level is independent of frequency (i.e., T does not need to be
known in order to ﬁnd Vav). Equation 12.1 can be rewritten as:
(12.2)
In Equation 12.2, Tmark and Tspace can be dimensionless. In Figure 12.4a, the
mark–space ratio, 
, is 1:2, so the average signal level is 0.33Vmax. Compare
this with Figure 12.4b, in which the mark–space ratio is reversed and Vav will
be 0.66Vmax. By continuously varying the mark–space ratio, the average signal
level can be varied to represent a variety of different signal shapes (Figure 12.5).
The obvious problem is that the analog circuit that is being driven by such
a signal must be susceptible to the average signal level and not the instantaneous
signal level. This implies that it must have some integrating or ﬁltering function.
From the design point of view, it is irrelevant if this occurs as part of the electrical
design of the system (e.g., it incorporates large inductors or capacitors), the
thermal design of the system (thermal masses that take time to heat or cool), the
mechanical design of the system (inertia, damping), or some part of the function
outside the system (e.g., the eye has an integrating function; a motion picture
looks like a moving scene rather than what it really is, a sequence of still images).
The system has to be a low-pass ﬁlter or integrator.
12.2.1.1 Estimating the PWM Frequency
As with the electronic ﬁlters dealt with in Chapter 11, we need to ensure that the
system that is being driven by the PWM signal ﬁlters out the unwanted part and
leaves us with the desired component of the signal: the average signal level.
Because the system is a low-pass ﬁlter, we want to design the fundamental
frequency of our PWM signal (f in Figure 12.4) to be signiﬁcantly higher than
the cutoff point of the ﬁlter, ideally ten times. Chapter 11 has already equipped

you to deal with electronic ﬁlter design; without going into detailed system
analysis, it is possible to estimate the frequency required to make PWM successful
by estimating the time constant of the system.
Given a step input to the system, the time constant is the time taken for the
system to reach 63% of its ﬁnal output (ﬁnal position, ﬁnal temperature, etc.). If
you can determine this for your system, then a good rule of thumb is to select a
PWM frequency that is ten times higher than this.
An alternative approach is to place an electronic ﬁlter on the output of the
system. If you know what the maximum frequency of the output signal is to be,
then an electronic ﬁlter can be designed with a –3-dB point at, or above, this
frequency and suitable attenuation at the PWM frequency to bring it below noise
level. One pulse from the PWM output (0 to Vmax) should not be more than about
10% of a quantization step in the output, ideally (see the following subsections).
12.2.1.2
Digital Implementation and Quantization
Many modern microcontrollers are equipped with PWM generators implemented
in hardware, although it is equally possible to implement them in software. PWM
chips are also available for purchase. However, understanding the process eluci-
dates some of the design constraints on PWM.
Figure 12.6 outlines how PWM may be implemented in hardware. Counter
A acts to time the period of the PWM signal, which ultimately derives from a
clock signal of a ﬁxed frequency. For ﬂexibility, counter A is provided with a
preload register. When the counter reaches its maximum value, instead of starting
back from 0, it is loaded with whatever value the preload register contains. The
frequency of the PWM signal can thus be adjusted:
(12.3)
The value in counter A is continuously compared with the value in the
mark–space register. When counter A is greater than the value in the mark–space

register, the output is turned on; otherwise the output is turned off. The smallest
mark–space ratio that can thus be obtained is:
(12.4)
This gives you a quantized (stepped) output, where the minimum step size
can be computed using Equation 12.4 and Equation 12.2.
In this design, quantization of the output is dependent on the value in the preload
register, and hence on the frequency of the signal. It is obviously possible to leave
the preload register set at 0 and change the frequency of the PWM signal by altering
the clock frequency. This can be done digitally with an additional counter and preload
register. Ultimately, the upper limit on the PWM frequency depends on the maximum
frequency to which the electronic logic circuitry can be driven, which determines
the maximum count rate of the counters. It is also limited by the maximum quanti-
zation step with which you can cope. For a minimum step size of 0.01Vmax, you need
100 counts (1/0.01). The maximum PWM frequency that can be achieved is then:
(12.5)
12.2.1.3 Reproducing Complex Signals with PWM
Figure 12.6 showed how varying the mark–space ratio could be used to create
an average signal level that varies in a sinusoidal manner. The number of samples
required to accurately reproduce a particular signal is dealt with in more detail
in subsequent sections on analog-to-digital conversion. As a rule of thumb, at
least ﬁve samples are required, preferably ten.
12.2.2 R-2R LADDER DIGITAL-TO-ANALOG CONVERTER (DAC)
In Chapter 11, you came across the summing ampliﬁer. This can be adapted to
form a DAC (Figure 12.7). However, its use is limited. As the number of bits

involved increases, so the size of the resistors doubles and very soon it becomes
impractical. The R-2R ladder DAC (Figure 12.8) relies only on the relative ratios
of resistors, and it is a lot easier to match ratios than absolute values when
fabricating devices on ICs.
The R-2R ladder DAC is so called because the resistors are arranged in a
ladder-like manner. It works because of the virtual earth point at the inverting
input of the op-amp. Analysis of the circuit is left to the reader as an exercise.
12.2.3 CURRENT OUTPUT DAC
The ﬁnal form of DAC that will be considered here is the current output DAC.
This can be constructed entirely from transistors and is, therefore, ideal for IC
applications. If a voltage output is required, then some kind of current-to-voltage
converter is required (e.g., a resistor and buffer ampliﬁer).
Current output DACs can be constructed with either bipolar transistors (see
p. 617 of Reference 1) or MOSFETS (Figure 12.9). In Figure 12.9, a p-channel
MOSFET as an active load creates a reference current, and the n-channel MOSFET
below it has its gate connected to the gates of eight other MOSFETs in a current
mirror fashion. If these MOSFETs had the same dimensions as the ﬁrst, then, having
the same gate voltage applied, the current ﬂowing through them would be the same.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
The channel ratios of these MOSFETs are scaled, however, so the current ﬂowing
through the one on the far right is half that ﬂowing through the next one, and so on.
A second row of MOSFETS, above the scaled ones, can be turned on or off to
allow current to ﬂow as required. A basic treatment of this topic is given elsewhere [2].
12.2.4 REPRODUCING COMPLEX SIGNALS WITH VOLTAGE OUTPUT DACS
The voltage output DACs described earlier produce a discrete output voltage that
corresponds with the digital number presented. The simplest way to create a time-
varying signal, then, is to have a computer or microcontroller load the DAC with
a sequence of numbers. Given that these can be presented to the DAC fast enough
(and the DAC can keep up), then a waveform of arbitrary shape and frequency
can be produced (Figure 12.10).
The rate at which data are presented to the DAC is the reconstruction clock
frequency. For very high frequencies, a microprocessor may not be able to keep
up; in such cases, the signal pattern would be preloaded into memory, and dedicated
digital logic would present it to the DAC at the required reconstruction rate.
In Figure 12.10, the stepped nature of the signal is apparent. To remove these,
a ﬁlter needs to be constructed. As stated before, in order to ease ﬁlter design,
the reconstruction frequency should be selected such that ﬁve to ten samples ﬁt
into the period of the highest frequency signal that you wish to reconstruct
(i.e., the reconstruction frequency should be ﬁve to ten times higher than the
highest frequency in the signal that you wish to produce). This is a general rule
of thumb, and the following section looks in more detail at this.
12.3 ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL CONVERSION
It is not possible to convert a continuously varying analog signal into a continu-
ously varying digital representation. What is done is that the analog signal is
sampled at regular intervals, the aim being to take sufﬁcient samples so that the
signal can be reconstructed by a DAC as in Figure 12.10.
It is worth mentioning that manufacturers of analog-to-digital-converter
(ADC) ICs provide comprehensive guides to selecting ADCs for particular appli-
cations. National Semiconductor also publishes comprehensive guides to ADC
speciﬁcations [3, 4].

12.3.1 SAMPLE RATE
As Figure 12.11 shows, if the sampling frequency selected is too low, a signal
will still be seen, but it will not accurately represent the actual signal. This effect,
in which a signal above the sample rate appears at a lower frequency in the
sampled signal, is known as aliasing. When aliasing occurs, information is lost,
and there is no way to reconstruct the original signal.
The minimum sample frequency required to reproduce a signal is determined
from the Nyquest criterion. This states that the sample frequency must be at least
twice the maximum frequency of the signal to be reproduced. This is, however,
an idealized situation; Figure 12.12 shows that fs = 2fmax can work provided that
the samples are taken at the maxima and minima of the signal (Figure 12.12a).
If, however, the samples are taken at the zero-crossing points, then the samples
will give an erroneous impression of the actual signal (Figure 12.12b).
Compared to the maximum signiﬁcant frequency expected in the signal, fmax,
the sampling frequency, fs, should be (as a general guideline):
•
fs = 2fmax : Nyquist criterion
•
fs = 3fmax : absolute minimum practical
•
fs = 5fmax : a practical value
•
fs ≥ 10fmax : ideal situation
The sampling frequency will be limited by the technology employed by the ADC.
High-precision converters, working to 24 bits, will be slower than 8-bit converters.
FIGURE 12.11 Illustration of the effects of undersampling. The frequency of the signal
(continuous line) is approximately 6π times the sampling frequency. Samples (black
diamonds) make the signal appear to be of a much lower frequency than it actually is.

12.3.1.1 Antialiasing Filters
As is evident from Figure 12.11, any noise signal above the sampling frequency
will interfere with the correct sampling of the signal of interest and cannot be
extracted by subsequent signal processing (i.e., the use of digital ﬁltering tech-
niques will not help). It is worth pointing out that switched-capacitor ﬁlters, which
were introduced in Chapter 11 (Subsection 11.5.3), also sample the signal that
they are ﬁltering and so are subject to aliasing as well.
Consequently, it is necessary to employ analog antialiasing ﬁlters prior to
any converters to remove noise above the sampling frequency. These can be
simple RC ﬁlters, or more complex ﬁlters (see Chapter 11 for ﬁlter designs).
Ideally, the ﬁlter would have a 3-dB point below the sampling frequency but
above the maximum signiﬁcant frequency of the signal.
Such ﬁlters are not normally included in the input stages of ADCs. It is common
to ﬁnd the bandwidth of an ADC speciﬁed as higher than the maximum sampling
frequency. This allows them to be used more ﬂexibly; they can reconstruct square
waves quite effectively; for instance, if the bandwidth were limited, then square
waves would be somewhat rounded when reconstructed. It does mean, however, that
in such applications, care has to be taken to control sources of high frequency noise.
12.3.2 RESOLUTION
The resolution chosen for the converter will depend on the signal that you wish
to sample. The signal should be ampliﬁed so that the maximum amplitude signal
that is expected almost ﬁlls the complete input range of the ADC. For example,
if the input range of the ADC were ±1 V (this is also known as the full-scale
deﬂection, or FSD) and the maximum signal amplitude expected was less than
±0.5 V, then the signal should be ampliﬁed with a gain of 2 prior to its being
presented to the ADC.
The resolution of the ADC can then be computed based on the acceptable
measurement error. So, for instance, if 1% of FSD is an acceptable error (this
would be ±0.01 V in our original ±0.5 V signal), then this would imply that a
converter with a 7-bit resolution would be acceptable. 
Quantization Error
This error is an inherent part of the analog-to-digital conversion process. If an
analog signal is presented to the converter that is nonzero but very close to
zero, then the output of the converter will still register as zero. As the signal
is increased, then the ADC will continue to register zero until the input signal
becomes large enough to pass over the threshold and register as 1. In an 8-bit
ADC with an input range of 0–5 V, any input below 19 mV (5/255) would
register as zero. This would give rise to a maximum error of –1 LSB (least
signiﬁcant bit). Most converters are designed for an error of ± ∫ LSB, although
this can give rise to other complications.

12.3.3 SIGNAL RECONSTRUCTION: SAMPLING RATE
AND RESOLUTION EFFECTS
Figure 12.13 illustrates how the sample rate and resolution of the DAC combine
when reconstructing an analog signal. This signal consists of two sine waves
added together; the smaller of the two is eight times the frequency of the larger
and one eighth the amplitude. The converters are presented such that the full-
scale deﬂection matches the maximum amplitude of the signal.
Figure 12.13a shows the reconstructed signal sampled at eight times the
maximum frequency of the signal (i.e., eight times the frequency of the smaller
amplitude sine wave, or 64 times the amplitude of the larger), using a 4-bit
converter. The 4-bit converter is only just enough to reproduce the smaller sine
wave (the whole amplitude of this being less than 2 units of the output of the
converter). Figure 12.13b shows what happens when a 3-bit converter, with only
8 discrete levels, is employed instead — even more information is lost.
Returning to the 4-bit converter, Figure 12.13c shows what happens when
the sampling rate is reduced to the Nyquist minimum: twice the frequency of
the highest frequency in the signal. The smaller amplitude component of the
sine wave appears to have disappeared. As mentioned previously, this is not a
problem with the Nyquist criterion but with exactly where the samples are
taken. Figure 12.13d shows that the information is available if it can be contrived
to ensure that the samples are taken at the maxima and minima of the smaller
component of the waveform. Obviously, it is only possible to do this when using
computer software to generate examples, but in most practical applications it is
not possible to arrange this.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
If the sampling rate were to be reduced further, the situation illustrated in
Figure 12.11 would be encountered: aliasing due to undersampling.
12.3.4 OTHER ADC ERRORS
As mentioned, most ADCs are designed so that the quantization error is ± ∫ LSB.
This gives rise to other errors in the conversion that are important if high precision
is required. There are quite a number of aspects of ADC speciﬁcations that you
need to be aware of if designing high-precision and high-accuracy systems, but
this is beyond the scope of this introduction. Two aspects that you should be
aware of are missing codes and full-scale error.
12.3.4.1
Missing Codes
These are codes that never appear in the output of the converter, and arise from
various aspects of converter design. A converter with missing codes is no less
accurate than an equivalent resolution converter with no missing codes, but they
can be inconvenient. If this should prove the case for a particular design, then a
converter has to be selected that has “no missing codes” speciﬁed on the data sheet.
12.3.4.2
Full-Scale Error
To achieve a ±∫ LSB quantization error, the threshold at which a signal moves
from one output code to the next has to be offset by ∫ a bit. This results in an
error in the last code (full-scale input) of 1∫ LSB. This is not normally very
important, and it is the quantization error that is usually of most signiﬁcance.
12.3.5 COMPANDING
Throughout the earlier discussion, it has been assumed that changes in the output
code of the converter (from 0 → 1 → 2 → 3, …, etc.) occur at speciﬁc threshold
inputs that are linearly spaced (i.e., at ∆V, 2 ∆V, 3 ∆V, …, etc.). This leads to
larger signals being measured with less overall error than small signals.
For instance, with an 8-bit converter, ±∫ LSB in a measurement of 128, e.g.,
represents an error of approximately 0.4% (100 × 0.5/128). If the measurement
were 16, then a ± ∫ LSB error would represent an error of more than 3%.
Companding is a method that employs nonlinear translation between input
signal and output code; i.e., the change signal amplitude required to move from
one code to the next depends on the current output, being larger if the present
signal amplitude is already large. This means that the absolute error in measure-
ment is evened out over the range.
12.4 ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL CONVERTERS
A number of different ADC architectures can be implemented. This section will
consider PWM output ADCs, successive approximation ADCs, ﬂash ADCs, and
sigma-delta ADCs.

12.4.1 SAMPLE-AND-HOLD CIRCUIT
Some of the converters discussed in the following text take a long time to perform
the conversion. It may, therefore, be necessary to employ a circuit known as a
sample-and-hold circuit. This samples a signal quickly, then presents an unchang-
ing signal to the converter on which for it to work. Some converters incorporate
these circuits, whereas for others it may be necessary to obtain a separate com-
ponent. Dedicated sample and hold circuits can be readily purchased.
12.4.2 PWM OUTPUT ADCS
The simplest form of PWM output ADC is illustrated in Figure12.14. It consists
of an n-bit counter and an n-bit DAC, where n is the resolution of the converter.
Counter A presents its output to the DAC. The output of the DAC, VDAC, is
compared to the analog signal, Vin. While VDAC < Vin, the output of the converter
is maintained high (digital 1). While VDAC > Vin, the output of the converter is 0.
The result of the conversion can be determined by measuring the mark–space
ratio of the output signal; this would be performed with a second counter syn-
chronized to the ﬁrst, and the PWM signal would enable (when 1) or disable
(when 0) counting on this counter.
The advantage of this approach is that high-resolution conversions can be
performed and transmitted to a microcontroller using very few wires, which is
often a restriction on MEMS devices.
12.4.2.1 Integrating ADC
The PWM signal can be generated without resort to digital circuitry. In this case,
an integrating ADC converter would be employed.
A sample-and-hold circuit is used to present the input voltage to the converter.
The counter and DAC are replaced by a capacitor and a constant-current source,
which will charge the capacitor linearly (see Equation 11.2, Chapter 11). The
voltage on this capacitor is compared to the sampled voltage, and when it exceeds
the sampled voltage, the output of the converter is switched from 1 to 0. When
FIGURE 12.14 Schematic showing the operation of an ADC with PWM output. A digital
circuit (counter and DAC) is used to generate the ramping signal against which the input
analog signal is compared. The input will frequently need a sample and hold circuit to
hold it constant during the conversion.

the capacitor is fully charged, it is rapidly discharged, and the cycle repeats itself,
thus creating a PWM signal.
In this case, the resolution of the converter is determined by the resolution
of the counter used to decode the PWM signal.
This only presents the technique in outline. Further reﬁnements are possible.
12.4.2.2
Conversion Time
For an n-bit converter, driven by a clock frequency, fc, the time taken to perform
a conversion will be:
(12.6)
(In other words, the time t takes for the counter to count from 0 to maximum).
12.4.3 SUCCESSIVE APPROXIMATION
The successive approximation ADC uses the following algorithm to perform a
conversion (illustrated in Figure 12.15 for a 4-bit converter). It, too, uses a DAC,
the output of which is compared with the input signal:
1. Set input to DAC to 0
2. Set most signiﬁcant bit of DAC to 1
FIGURE 12.15 Illustration of the operation of a 4-bit successive approximation ADC.
The input signal is shown as a dashed line, and the test value of the DAC is shown as a
heavy line. In the ﬁrst cycle (a) the most signiﬁcant bit (MSB) of the DAC is set and the
output compared to the input signal. The input signal is greater, therefore the bit remains
set at the end of the step. Then (b) the next bit of the DAC is set. The input signal is less
than the output of the DAC so this bit is reset. This is repeated in steps (c) and (d) to give
a ﬁnal value of 1010 after 4 steps.

3. If the output of the DAC is greater than the input signal, then clear the
bit that has just been set (i.e., reset it back to 0).
4. If you have not run out of bits, set the next most signiﬁcant bit and go
back to step 3.
5. Finished; the output of the ADC is the same as the current input to the
DAC.
The algorithm basically works by dividing the input range of the ADC in two
and seeing if the signal lies in the top or bottom half. Whichever half it lies in,
this is divided in two and the test repeated until it runs out of bits to test. This
is much faster than the PWM output converter described earlier. The conversion
time for an n-bit successive approximation ADC is:
(12.7)
So the conversion time increases linearly with the resolution. The disadvantage
of this converter compared to the PWM output version is that it requires n output
lines (unless additional circuitry is included to implement a serial communications
port), and a DAC is essential.
12.4.4 FLASH ADC
The ﬂash ADC is, as its name suggests, the fastest possible converter. For an n-
bit converter, a potential divider chain is used to divide a reference (full scale)
voltage into 2n different voltages. Then, 2n comparators are used to compare the
input signal with each point on the potential divider chain. This is then converted
to an n-bit output code by digital logic circuitry.
The conversion time is limited only by the time it takes the signal to propagate
through the circuitry, but the converter has several disadvantages.
The large number of component parts means that it is the least accurate of the
available ADC architectures. Also, because the area of silicon required increases
with 2n, only relatively low-resolution converters are possible.
It is possible to achieve some compromise by combining successive approx-
imation and ADCs ﬂash ADCs to produce reasonably fast high-resolution con-
verters, but these are becoming less common with improving technology.
12.4.5 SIGMA-DELTA CONVERTER
The sigma-delta has recently become more popular because of the increasing
speed of CMOS technology. There are various approaches, and its operation is
reminiscent of that described for integrating PWM output converters (earlier text).
The sigma-delta converter consists of an integrator and a single-bit DAC
(i.e., a comparator). A number of pulses are applied to the input of the integrator

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
until its output exceeds the level of the input signal, as determined by the
comparator. The number of pulses required is counted, and this gives the output
code of the converter.
The time taken to perform a conversion is, therefore, dependent on the input
signal, but the maximum conversion time can be computed using Equation 12.6.
Sigma-delta converters offer the highest accuracy and resolutions of all con-
verter types discussed here, but they are also one of the slowest types.
12.5 CONVERTER SUMMARY
The following are the main features of the DAC and ADC:
• 
DAC:
• PWM is simple and can be used to drive integrating loads directly.
• R-2R ladder DAC is, generally speaking, most useful.
• Reconstruction frequency should be at least 5 times, preferably 10
times the highest frequency of the reconstructed signal.
• Reconstruction ﬁlters should be employed as required.
• ADC:
• Nyquist criterion: fs = 2fmax.
• Sample rate should be 5 to 10 times the maximum signiﬁcant fre-
quency in the signal to be measured, and at least 3 times.
• Antialiasing ﬁlters must be employed.
• Converter resolution should be selected to ensure an acceptable
measurement error for the expected signal.
• PWM output converters are slow, but give a serial output.
• The successive approximation ADC offers good compromise
design.
• The ﬂash ADC is fast, but less accurate.
• The sigma-delta ADC is slow but very accurate and precise.

13 Output Drivers
13.1 INTRODUCTION
The previous chapters of Part III introduced basic electronics and how this may
be used to interface microengineered sensors or generate signals to control
microengineered transducers. This chapter starts by showing how operational
ampliﬁers (op-amps) can be used to drive electrodes in biosensors, although the
same conﬁgurations can be used in other applications. However, basic op-amps
have only limited capability to drive large currents or voltages, although most
microactuators are not very demanding in this respect, it may be necessary to
employ different output stages when driving electrostatic, piezoelectric or thermal
actuators, or in µTAS applications. Power op-amps may be used in some situa-
tions, but these are limited and some alternative strategies, mainly based on the
employment of discrete power transistors, are introduced here.
13.2 CONTROLLING CURRENTS AND VOLTAGES 
WITH OP-AMPS
The common voltage feedback op-amp can be used in a variety of conﬁgurations
to control and measure both voltages and currents. For brevity and generality of
application, this section does not feature complete circuit diagrams, and readers
are referred to the material introducing op-amp and differential ampliﬁers in
Chapter 11 if they wish to develop application-speciﬁc circuit designs.
13.2.1 OP-AMP CURRENT CONTROL
In many situations it is desirable to generate a current between two electrodes
that is controlled by a voltage. This can be done quite simply by reference to the
ideal inverting ampliﬁer conﬁguration. Figure 13.1 illustrates a simple circuit by
which current ﬂowing through a measurement electrode (M) may be controlled.
Ignoring, for the moment, the reference electrode shown in Figure 13.1, the
current ﬂowing from the control electrode (C) to the measurement electrode (M)
must be equal to the current ﬂowing through the resistor, R. Thus:

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
Clearly, this is a very convenient way by which current can be controlled.
The system enables the resistance or impedance between the electrodes to be
measured by monitoring the voltage of the control electrode, vc. The reference
electrode, however, requires some explanation.
In many situations the reference electrode will not be required. If, however,
the measurement is being made in an aqueous environment (as is common with
many biosensor applications), the reference electrode should be used to stabilize
the measurement. If the measurement and control electrode are immersed in a
volume of liquid in order to effect the measurement without the presence of a
reference electrode, then errors will be introduced because the potential of the
environment will drift with respect to the measurement system. A reference of
some sort is required in all such situations.
For the reference electrode to work, it must be placed a long way away from
the control and measurement electrodes at a distance greater than that between
these two electrodes. Furthermore, the path between the reference electrode and
the control and measurement electrodes must be resistive so that the control
electrode can work (otherwise the entire measurement system would remain at
0 V because all current sourced or sunk by the control electrode would ﬂow to
Earth via the reference electrode rather than to the virtual earth of the measurement
electrode). For a referenced system to be effective, the control electrode has to be
able to raise or lower the potential in the vicinity of the measurement electrode
without the reference electrode sourcing or sinking a large amount of current.
13.2.1.1 Four-Electrode Conﬁguration
An alternative approach to measure change in impedance or resistance of a
biosensing medium is the four-electrode conﬁguration, illustrated in Figure 13.2.
Here, the functions of current generation and voltage measurement have been
separated. If it can be assumed that all the current ﬂowing between the two
outer electrodes passes through the two inner electrodes, then an absolute
measurement can be made. At the least, however, changes in impedance can
be registered.

applications, more effective circuits are dealt with later in this chapter.

The advantage of this approach is that passing even relatively small electric
currents through electrodes can introduce errors in voltage measurements in some
situations. In this situation, the only currents passing through the voltage mea-
surement electrodes will be the bias currents of the differential ampliﬁer (these
will need to ﬂow to Earth, so a reference electrode may again be necessary to
stabilize the system). The use of AC signals rather than DC, to make impedance
measurements, will also help if irreversible electrochemical activity caused by
the latter introduce errors.
13.2.2 OP-AMP VOLTAGE CONTROL
The use of an op-amp with negative feedback to control an output voltage is
shown in Figure 13.3. A small amount of the quantity being controlled is fed
back via Vsense. Assuming that Vsense has the same polarity as Vo (i.e., as Vo increases,
so does Vsense) then, because the ideal op-amp attempts to maintain its inputs at
the same potential, Vo will follow Vin. Vo may be larger or smaller than Vin,
depending on whether Vsense/Vo is less than or greater than unity.
The applications of this approach will become apparent in subsequent sec-
tions, which consider the use of transistors to boost the output of an op-amp, and
optoisolators. It should be noted that if Vsense/Vo is negative, or if Vsense lags Vo by
a signiﬁcant time delay, then the system will become unstable and oscillate.
FIGURE 13.2 Four-electrode impedance measurement. Current is applied through two
test electrodes, passing through the medium under test across two measurement electrodes.
A high-impedance differential voltage ampliﬁer is used to determine the voltage difference
between the two measurement electrodes, which are a known distance apart. In this way,
problems in applying the current are separated from measurement problems.

13.3 TRANSISTORS
Of the several kinds of transistors, only four or rather two pairs, will be considered
in this section, the npn and pnp bipolar junction transistor (BJT) and the n- and
p-channel enhancement-mode metal-oxide-semiconductor ﬁeld effect transistor
(MOSFET). These are the most useful transistors for the sort of applications
likely to be encountered by anyone developing instrumentation for MEMS.
13.3.1 THE BJT
The bipolar junction transistor is so called because it is formed by two pn
junctions. The doping used to create pn junctions for electronic devices is gen-
erally lower than that required for concentration-dependent etching. The pn junc-
tion is shown schematically in Figure 13.4a, along with the circuit symbol for a
pn junction diode (Figure 13.4b). The ideal diode acts as a one-way switch:
current will ﬂow through the device from the p-doped semiconductor to the n-
doped semiconductor (in the same direction as the “arrow” of the diode symbol),
but will not ﬂow in the other direction.
The real diode is, of course, nonideal. The most important difference is that
a small voltage must be dropped across the component before any current will
ﬂow. In the case of a silicon diode this voltage drop is about 0.7 V. In the case
of a metal semiconductor (Schottky) diode, it is 0.2 V, and in the case of a light-
emitting diode, 2 V. Figure 13.5 shows the idealized current–voltage (I–V) char-
acteristic of a silicon diode. 
FIGURE 13.4 (a) Schematic of pn junction, (b) diode symbol.
Rectifying and Ohmic Contacts
When making electrical contact to a semiconductor with a metal, diode effects
can occur; the contact is said to be rectifying rather than ohmic. The situation
can be improved by making the connection to a highly doped, and therefore
conductive, part of the device.

The BJT is a three-layer device with a very thin layer of p-doped material (the
base) sandwiched between two n-doped layers, the collector and the emitter, (npn)
or a thin n-doped base with p-doped collector and emitter (PNP). Figure 13.6
schematically shows the structure and circuit symbols of npn and pnp transistors.
The direction of the arrow on the symbol indicates the direction of the base–emitter
junction diode. Although the devices look symmetrical, they are normally fabricated
in an asymmetrical manner, so attention should be paid to the package labeling.
The BJT is a current-controlled current ampliﬁer. Figure 13.7a shows a con-
ﬁguration common for an npn transistor. The collector is the most positive part of
the circuit, and the emitter is nominally the most negative part of the circuit; if
necessary, the base can be driven to a more negative voltage than the emitter, and
both diode junctions will then be reverse biased and no current will ﬂow. The npn
transistor is used more often than the pnp, so this treatment will proceed with
reference to the npn. The currents in pnp circuits are reversed (Figure 13.7b).
For large signals, the BJT acts as if it has a current gain of β:

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
Armed with this knowledge and the tools introduced in Chapter 11, it is
possible to analyze various simple transistor circuits.
It should be noted that for a single type of commercially available transistor,
there is a wide tolerance range for values of β — over a factor of three or four
is typical (e.g., from 60 to 240). Additional circuitry is required to compensate
for this when the transistor is used as an ampliﬁer; however, in its most common
application as a switch, this is not a concern — the designer simply allows for
the lowest possible value of β.
For example, in Figure 13.7, a BJT is used to control current through a 100 Ω
load. The BJT has a β of at least 40, and is rated at 250 mA for maximum
values of Ic to. If Vi is 0 V, then no base current will ﬂow because Vb must be
greater than or equal to Ve + 0.7 in order to forward bias the base–emitter
junction. If Ib is 0, then from Equation 13.2, Ic must be 0 and no current will
ﬂow through the load. This also means that Vc must be 5 V (i.e., the transistor
is an open circuit).
To turn the load on, 10 V must be dropped across it, so at least 100 mA must
ﬂow through it (from Ohm’s Law). This implies that Ib must be at least 2.5 mA
(100 ÷ 40).
If the system is being controlled from a logic gate, for example, the output
of a microcontroller, then Vi can normally be either 0 V or 5 V. To turn the
transistor fully on so that 100 mA ﬂows through the load, then:
(13.4)
Because Vi will have a maximum of 5 V, this suggests that Rb should be 1.72 kΩ
or less. Many modern logic gates can happily source or sink up to 10 mA, so
there would be no harm in selecting a value of, e.g., 1 k for Rb to ensure that
enough current ﬂows through the load.
Here, the transistor has been used to interface a low-current system with a
limited supply voltage to drive a high-current load at double the supply voltage.

The voltage dropped across the load will not be exactly 10 V because even when
the transistor is fully turned on (saturated) some voltage is still dropped across
it (VCESAT). Additionally, should the load be capacitive, as is the case when driving
an electrostatic actuator for example, then a large amount of current will need to
be available to ensure that the capacitor charges rapidly enough.
Additional current ampliﬁcation can be achieved by employing two transistors
together, as in a Darlington conﬁguration (Figure 13.8). Darlington transistors
are available in a variety of formats and packages.
13.3.2 THE MOSFET
The name metal-oxide-semiconductor ﬁeld effect transistor (MOSFET) is derived
from its structure. It has three terminals: drain, source, and gate. Current ﬂows
between the drain and source through a semiconducting channel in a silicon
substrate. This channel is controlled by the metal gate electrode, which is sepa-
rated from the channel by a thin oxide layer. MOSFETs can be found in one of
two modes: enhancement or depletion, and may be either n-channel or p-channel.
Enhancement-mode MOSFETs are more commonly employed than the depletion-
mode, and for simplicity, these will be the focus of this section.
Figure 13.9 shows the structure and symbols for n-channel (Figure 13.9a and
Figure 13.9b) and p-channel (Figure 13.9c and Figure 13.9d) enhancement-mode
MOSFETs.
Note the substrate connections in Figure 13.9. For correct operation, this has
to be connected to the most negative voltage for n-type and to the most positive
voltage for p-type transistors. This is required to ensure that the pn junctions
between substrate and the active parts of the device (channel and source or drain
implants) are reverse biased. Although the structure of the device looks symmet-
rical, discretely packaged transistors are usually supplied with the substrate inter-
nally connected to source, which will normally be the more negative (n-channel)
or more positive (p-channel) than the drain during normal operation of the device.
(In some cases, asymmetrical doping may be employed as well).
CMOS processes employ both n-channel and p-channel MOSFETs, and so
will be referred to as either n-well or p-well processes. In the n-well process, a
p-type wafer is speciﬁed and deep n-type diffusions or implants are introduced
into this at points where p-channel MOSFETs will be fabricated, and vice versa
for the p-well process.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
The operation of an n-channel enhancement-mode MOSFET is shown sche-
matically in Figure 13.10. As the gate voltage is increased, electrons are attracted
towards it. Eventually, there will be sufﬁcient electrons beneath the gate to locally
convert the silicon to an n-type semiconductor. At this point, current will be able to

All are in the enhancement mode. It is common to abbreviate the circuit symbols by joining
the broken line and omitting the substrate connection. In many cases the substrate is
internally connected, as shown in the symbols, to the most negative part of the circuit for
the n-channel MOSFET and to the most positive part for the p-channel.
FIGURE 13.10 Operation of n-channel enhancement-mode MOSFET: (a) with no gate
bias; (b) as the potential difference between the gate and source, VGS, is increased, electrons
are attracted towards the gate; (c) at a certain threshold value, VT, sufﬁcient electrons are
beneath the gate region to make it an n-type semiconductor, and a conducting channel
opens between the drain and source. As VGS is increased, the channel opens further, and
its equivalent resistance is reduced.

ﬂow from drain to source. The voltage between gate and source (VGS) required
to open up the channel is the threshold voltage, or VT. As VGS is increased, more
current will be able to ﬂow.
The current ﬂow will be limited by the drain–source voltage if:
(13.5)
In this case, the current ﬂowing, ID, is given by:
(13.6)
The value of k depends on the channel dimensions and the process, and will
not be pursued any further in this chapter. Figure 13.11 shows the characteristics
of an n-channel MOSFET with k = 0.075 S and VT = 2.1 V. This sort of characteristic
is typical of a discrete MOSFET used for low-power switching, such as the
2N7000.
From Equation 13.6, it is apparent that, unlike the BJT, the MOSFET is a
transconductance ampliﬁer: a change in gate voltage produces a corresponding
change in drain current. So its transfer characteristics are given in terms of a
current divided by a voltage (ID/VGS) — which is a conductance.
MOSFETs make very good switches, because virtually no gate current is
required to switch large drain currents. Additionally, the channel behaves like a
resistor, and this can be made very low when the transistor is turned on fully
(data sheets will list this as RDS(ON) — the drain–source on-resistance). For low-
power applications, some MOSFETs are designed with low-threshold voltages
so that they can be driven by logic level signals. (Obviously, MOSFETs on ICs

are designed speciﬁcally for low-voltage operation, but will not be discussed as
this chapter deals with output drivers for power applications).
As a switch, the MOSFET has the following characteristics:
• Negligible steady-state gate current required.
• Gate current must be sufﬁcient to charge the gate capacitance (between
the gate and the channel) quickly when turning the transistor on (or
discharge it when turning it off).
• Gate capacitance and available current to the gate limit the switching
time.
• 
VGS must be sufﬁcient to overcome the threshold voltage and ensure a
low RDS (not always possible with a logic level drive).
An additional caveat when employing discrete MOSFETs is that they are
frequently intended to be used as switches, and to this end many incorporate
ﬂywheel diodes that will carry reverse currents that appear when inductive loads
are being switched. Normally, these can be ignored, but sometimes their incor-
poration can cause problems. Figure 13.12 shows the symbol for a 2N7000
n-channel enhancement-mode MOSFET, which incorporates such a diode.
13.4 RELAYS
The relay is an electromechanical switch. An electromagnet is used to close a
switch element. When no current is ﬂowing through the electromagnet, a spring
holds the switch in one position. When current ﬂows the electromagnet holds the
switch in a second position. Figure 13.13a shows the circuit symbol for a single-
pole double-throw (SPDT) relay, and Figure 13.13b shows how this relay can be
driven by a MOSFET.
The relay coil is inductive, so a diode is required to protect the transistor
during switching. The resistance of relay coils is normally in the range of 500 to
1000 Ω, so they cannot normally be switched directly by digital outputs. Heavy-
duty relays will require higher currents.

Relays are commonly described by their switching arrangement. The number
of poles is effectively the number of switches, and the number of throws is the
number of contacts that each switch (pole) can make (normally only one or two
in a relay: single or double throw).
13.4.1 RELAY CHARACTERISTICS
As mechanical switches, relays have several desirable characteristics:
•
Low resistance
•
High-current and high-voltage operation
•
Can carry high-frequency signals
•
Good isolation (high impedance when in the “off” state)
•
Bidirectional current ﬂow
These are counteracted by the following disadvantages:
•
Physically large, generally
•
High-power operation (electromagnets require high currents)
•
Take a long time (ms) to switch over
•
Contacts bounce: contact is partially made and broken several times
before the switch settles into its ﬁnal state (this can be eliminated by
mercury-wetted contacts, but these are being withdrawn because of
environmental concerns)
13.4.2 RELAY TYPES
There are several different types of relay available, with different characteristics
and applications.
The reed relay is the most compact conventional relay design. The switching
element is a very ﬁne leaf spring that can be magnetically actuated. These are
designed for switching small currents, and can sometimes be driven directly by
logic outputs. Reed relays are normally only SPST.

Microengineering, MEMS, and Interfacing: A Practical Guide
Most common relays are packaged in cubic or rectangular packages, a cen-
timeter or two on each side. They are designed for switching several amperes at
up to 250 V AC. These would normally require a MOSFET drive if controlled
automatically, as that in Figure 13.13b. A half-way house between these and reed
relays are relays designed for telecoms applications. Telecoms relays are compact
relays designed for low-current, low-voltage switching, but are more mechani-
cally sophisticated than reed relays. Larger relays can be obtained to switch higher
currents and voltages as required.
Solid-state relays are also available. These are implemented in silicon tech-
nology and have no moving parts, and they are generally designed using CMOS
transistors. Optically isolated versions are available (see the following text). These
generally have fast switching times and no contact bounce, but high-power
devices are at present quite costly.
Owing to the advantages of electromechanical switches, MEMS relays have
been developed, and some are commercially available. These are usually based
on cantilever structures, actuated by a variety of methods. MEMS relays have
generally been designed for communications applications: they are more compact
than any other relay design, and offer good isolation and bidirectional current
ﬂow. Power requirements for actuation depend on the strategy used, but they are
generally portable-device-friendly.
13.5 BJT OUTPUT BOOST FOR OP-AMPS
An arbitrary scheme for op-amp voltage control was indicated in Figure 13.3.
Figure 13.14 shows how this and a BJT can be combined to boost the current-
handling capacity of an op-amp. The current available to drive the load will be
magniﬁed by the current gain (β) of the transistor. Another way of looking at it
is that the load resistance will appear as a resistor of value βRL to the output of
the op-amp. This circuit cannot sink current, but it is a useful circuit for driving
resistive heaters or coils on MEMS devices.
It may be desirable to control the current ﬂowing through the load in
Figure 13.14. One scheme for this is shown in Figure 13.15, where a sense

resistor is incorporated into the circuit. Note that Rsense must be much smaller
than RL, otherwise it will dissipate power. This is why an instrumentation ampli-
ﬁer has been incorporated into the circuit.
13.6 OPTOISOLATORS
When working with high voltages, such as in some MEMS situations: electrostatic
drives or electroosmotic ﬂow generation, it is advisable to isolate the high-voltage
side of the equipment from the low-voltage control circuitry for reasons of safety
if not concern about damaging sensitive equipment. Relays, offer one mechanism
for this. A more ﬂexible approach is optical isolation (optoisolation).
Optoioslators comprise a light-emitting diode and a light-sensitive diode or
transistor in a single package. The simplest devices are designed to isolate digital
signals, and these can effectively be employed for PWM-type signals (Figure 13.16). 
FIGURE 13.15 A BJT used to boost the output of an op-amp output as in Figure 13.14,
but current, not voltage, is being controlled.

nected to a positive power rail through a resistor and the cathode to a digital line. The
transistor would be operated as a switch (collector pulled up to 5 V through a resistor,
and the emitter connected to ground).

Optical isolation of analog signals is more problematic because of nonlin-
earities in the optical components and variability from device to device. This
is overcome by employing matched receivers on either side of the isolation
(Figure 13.17). In this case, the signal on one side can be monitored, and the
duplicate circuitry on the other side duplicates the signal correctly.
FIGURE 13.17 This optoisolator incorporates two matched transistors so that analogue
signals can be reproduced accurately. The transistor on the LED side is incorporated into
a feedback loop in the circuit that drives the LED.
