Foreword
Broadband Internet Access is becoming more commonplace and ubiquitous, but no
medium known today can rival the potential of satellites for is totally global coverage
coupled with complete mobile roaming capability. This book, an outgrowth of the
first named authors' doctoral dissertation is, by far, the most comprehensive and
orderly treatment of the subject. It is the work of experts with a wealth of both
theoretical and practical experience with the subject and its connecting disciplines. It
is an integral work, not a collection of edited chapters. Concepts and notation are at
the same consistent level throughout the book. As such it is suitable as a teaching text
as well as a reference.
The first two parts of the book contains a succinct overview of satellite technology,
systems engineering, history and working examples of most of the broadband
communications satellites that have been conceived and/or launched into service. The
last three parts go in considerable detail, to the protocols and techniques that go into
making the satellite system into a network; either purely via satellite to user or by
interworking with the terrestrial network ofoptical fiber or terrestrial wireless links.
Quality of Service (QoS) is an absolutely critical part of any telecommunication
services. This work fills a gap in the literature of what possibilities there are for
satellites in providing global Internet services. The large propagation delays inherent
in GEO satellites might doom them at very large time-bandwidth products and hence,
that may mitigate against interactive services. However, streaming video broadcasts
or multicast might provide a haven for GEO's. Also, although the IETF has been
making Herculean efforts in patching up TCP/IP, the extra burden imposed by
satellite links will require an entirely new kind of protocol stack for wireless channels
that experience fading, errors, noise, Doppler shifts, nomadic behavior, etc, that were
not considered in the design of ATM or the TCP/IP networks of origin. These issues
are thoroughly addressed in the book along with quantitative methods for analysis and
performance measurement. GEO solutions are addressed and may offer an alternative
way to use broadband interactively.
The authors' broad knowledge and mastery of the international standards definitions,
processes, and agreed objectives, will make this book a reference for a long time.
Almost (but not, by any means) all the issues along the entire protocol stack are
covered. One important exception is the issue of security, a topic on everyone's mind,
especially in wireless systems. Nevertheless, the "backbone", upon which all else

resides, is here. The authors are to be congratulated for their hard work in bringing
this material together in a clear and readable way.

Preface
The convergence of computer networks and telecommunication technologies resulted
in the growth of the global information infrastructure. The Internet, a network of
networks,
is
revolutionizing
how
information
is
accessed
and
how
people
communicate. The Internet has potential to change a person's lifestyle with services
ranging
from shopping, finding
local entertainment to helping with children's
homework. Technological development in the last several years combined with new
network architectures interconnecting various heterogeneous information systems
created a truly global information infrastructure. Many future broadband applications
such as streaming video and audio, real-time distance learning , medical imaging,
movie downloads, and online gaming, targeting both residential and enterprise users,
demand high bandwidth, and guaranteed user Quality of Service (QoS) levels. An
outcome of this demand were several access technologies varying from leased line to
cable, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), wireless , and satellite. As the demand for new
applications increases, "best effort" service of the Internet will become inadequate
and will result
in lack of user satisfaction . Over the years, the
Internet has
encompassed many changes in traffic profiles and applications, in bandwidths and
utilization in the number of domains and their degree of connections. But the future
Internet infrastructure necessitates a very different architecture supporting QoS.
Internet2 is under development to provide advanced network services with increased
capacity of gigabits per second , Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), and IP over Dense
Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) backbone.
Satellite communications playa significant role in supporting access to the Internet
through
a satellite
network
infrastructure. A satellite
communication
network
distinguished by several characteristics such as global coverage, scalability, broadcast
capability, bandwidth-on-demand flexibility, multicast capability, and reliability; is an
excellent candidate to provide broadband integrated Internet access. The current
satellite systems operate in C and Ku frequency bands. Most of the proposed satellite
network
architectures
use
geostationary
orbit
(GSa), non-geostationary
orbits
(NGSO) and multi-spot beams at Ka-band frequencies.
The next generation IP based satellite multimedia networks can be divided into two
classes. The first is broadband satellite connectivity network in which full end-to-end
user connectivity is established. The proposed global satellite connectivity networks
such as Astrolink,
Spaceway, and EuroSkyWay have onboard processing and
switching capabilities. On the other hand, regional access networks like StarBand,
IPStar, and WildBlue are intended to provide Internet access. These access systems

XXVlll
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
employ non-regenerative payloads. The critical requirement is to provide high data
rate Internet access, global connectivity, and provisioning of QoS.
Alternative to IP, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) can be used to support both
real-time
and
non-real-time
services
over
a
satellite.
The
International
Telecommunications Union (lTU) and the ATM Forum have developed satellite
ATM QoS models recommendations.
The future backbones probably use IP over
DWDM
or Generalized
MultiProtocol
Label
Switching (GMPLS)
to
support
multiservices and gigabit bandwidths.
Currently, most of the Internet applications use a Transmission Control Protocol
(TCP)/Internet
Protocol
(lP)
protocol
suite. Although
the
TCP
protocol
was
developed for terrestrial
networks, a number of TCP enhancements have been
proposed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (lETF) to accommodate satellite
specific link characteristics such as propagation delay, bandwidth asymmetry, channel
impairments, and congestion.
The IP based broadband satellite network for both global connectivity and access
must support user QoS. A major effort Jed by the IETF proposes QoS architectures to
provide guaranteed service levels for different applications. These architectures
include,
Integrated
Services
(lntServ),
Differentiated
Services
(DiffServ)
and
Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) . The IETF proposed architectures mainly
address terrestrial networks. There is an urgent need to develop QoS architectures for
broadband
satellite
network.
The
ITU
and
the
European
Telecommunication
Standards Institute (ETSI) are actively developing satellite IP network architectures
and QoS model specifications.
Most existing satellite communication books deal primarily with the physical layer
and some aspects of the link layer. There is no comprehensive book on satellite
communication networks that provides a deeper understanding of the networking
issues at the network and transport layers, with special emphasis on the performance
of broadband satellite networks.
In this book, a systems
engineering methodology for satellite communication
networks is presented. This book is devoted to issues related to the implementation of
Internet applications that involve network design issues usually addressed in standard
organizations. Various protocols for IP- and ATM-based networks are examined and
a comparative performance evaluation of different alternatives is described. As such,
the methodology presented here can be applied to similar evaluations over any other
transport medium.
This book begins with a background in networking consisting of core and access
technologies as well as future trends to meet the requirements of bandwidth-rich
multimedia applications. In addition, Chapter I provides an overview of Internet
evolution,
broadband
applications,
satellite
system
evolution,
and
a
network
infrastructure consisting of core backbone technologies and access technologies.
This book is divided into four parts. Part One, principles of satellite networks, covers
chapters 2-5 with an overview of satellite network basics in Chapter 2, a systems

Preface
XXIX
engineering methodology in Chapter 3, network systems and examples in Chapter 4,
and Quality of Service framework in Chapter 5.
Part Two, consisting of chapters 6-9, addresses major technical challenges in
designing and deploying satellite IP, ATM, and future MPLS networks. The emphasis
is on the link layer and above. The physical layer details have been addressed
extensively in the literature. The first three chapters of this part deal with technical
challenges at various layers. The physical layer, link layer - media access are covered
in Chapter 6; satellite IP at network layer, satellite TCP at transport layer with
Performance Enhancing Proxies (PEPs) in Chapter 7; and satellite ATM with traffic
management and congestion control and end-to-end security in Chapter 8. Chapter 9
provides a current status of standards and regulatory issues for satellite networks.
After descr ibing an overview of the principles of satellite networks and technical
challenges for satellite network design
in Part One and Part Two, a detailed
description of satellite IP networks achieving QoS guarantees and performance is
illustrated in Part Three . The purpose of this part is to provide satellite IP networks
QoS performance models giving an understanding of the design aspects to be
addressed for realization of a satellite network. In Chapter 10, QoS in satellite IP,
QoS objectives, QoS architecture alternatives are discussed. Differentiated Services
based QoS simulation models for TCP and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) traffic for
Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) and Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) configurations
using Analysis of Variation Techniques are provided in Chapter 11. In Chapter 12,
performance of MPLS over a satellite network is described. Interactive multimedia
over satellite using Multiple Frequency-Time Division Multiple Access (MF-TDMA)
based and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) based return channel protocols
are presented in chapter 13.
Similar to the discussion on satellite IP performance models in Part Three, Part Four
addresses satellite ATM networks identifying fundamental questions about buffer
requirements, TCP/ATM, efficiency and fairness and multiple access modes in a
quantitative way. This part is dedicated to simulation analysis of TCP performance
and resulting QoS operating over satellite links. Several proposals for improvements
are compared. Chapter 14 provides QoS requirements for satellite ATM networks ,
and a simulation model for satellite ATM Unspecified Bit Rate (UBR) service.
Chapter 15 develops a simulation model for TCP over satellite ATM for GEO, MEO
and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) configurations. An analytical model for satellite ATM
based

Overview of Broadband Satellite Networks 
1.1 INTRODUCTION 
The convergence of computer networks and telecommunication 
technologies resulted in the explosive growth of the global information 
infrastructure. The independent research on distributed communications at 
RAND (1964), Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) 
sponsored by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) group 
(1967), and network research at The British National Physical Laboratory 
(1965) have resulted in the development of packet switched networks. In 
1972, the materialization of an open networking architecture [1] and the 
Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) formed the 
fundamental milestone for the successful development of the Internet. During 
early 1980s, TCP/IP included in the Berkeley UNIX operating system became 
popular for several network services. Subsequently, in 1986, National Science 
Foundation (NSF) funded a new high-speed backbone network called 
NSFNET. Another significant evolution of hypermedia software interface to 
the Internet, called World Wide Web (WWW) (1991) made the Internet 
extremely popular. In 1997, various Internet service providers (ISPs) reported 
traffic growth on Internet at the rate of 10-20% per month. Ever since, the 
Internet has evolved so fast, that it became a vital part of communication 
infrastructure across the globe. 
Telecommunication networks evolved using circuit switching 
technology and provide constant bandwidth are good for the support of voice 
calls. Also, the functional complexity in such networks is located in the 
network switching nodes, which often requires updates to the hardware and 
software in case of expansions. On the other hand, computer networks 
adopted packet switching, which facilitates statistical multiplexing of burst 
data. Packet switched networks are connection less and based on the 
processing power at the hosts or network edges as opposed to connection

oriented, circuit switched networks. Packet switched networks are mainly
suited for and mostly support data services. The Internet, which is an IP-based
network ofnetworks, is used to support both real-time voice and video along
with data over the best effort IP connectionless protocol, namely, IP version 4
(IPv4).
Due to the non-availability of large network resources such as
bandwidth and buffers, IP version 6 (IPv6) will be used as the demand for
network applications grows in the future.
To support broadband multimedia applications for data, voice, and
video in the same network, the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)-based
Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (B-ISDN) using 53 bytes cell
routes the data through the switching nodes and transmission lengths of the
network. The
power of the
ATM technology is to
provide
statistical
multiplexing gains and Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees for multimedia
services.
As the estimated bandwidth grew to 155 Gb - 2.4 Tb for metro
networks and 2.4 Tb - 10 Tb for core, from current requirement of 2.4 Gb -
10Gb [2], the Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) technologies and
the progress in packet forwarding techniques made larger transmission
bandwidth possible. Deployment of WDM transmission technology made it
possible for the overall transmission capacity fiber links to grow at a rate of
about 200% per year reaching 1.6 Tbps [3].
Multiprotocol
Label
Switching
(MPLS)
emerged
as
a
new
technology. The significant characteristic MPLS is the ability to route an IP
packet over a layer 2 protocol such as Frame Relay or ATM.
For example,
RFC 3496 provides the Protocol Extension for Support of Asynchronous
Transfer Mode (ATM) Service Class-aware Multiprotocol Label Switching
(MPLS) Traffic Engineering. [4].
MPLS enhances the services that can be provided by IP networks
offering traffic engineering and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). To adapt to
photonic switch
characteristics Generalized
MPLS
(GMPLS)
has been
developed including new link management protocols and signaling protocols.
The developing network infrastructure using protocols such as MPLS
will support applications such as IP multicast, media streaming, content
delivery distribution, broadband access for distance learning and medical
imaging,
and
other
media-rich
applications
require
a global
network
infrastructure. The hopes are this new network will offer greater bandwidth
and service level guarantees. Residential, small business and enterprise
Internet users are already demanding high data rates and high quality services.
An outcome of this demand were several access technologies varying from
leased line to cable, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), wireless, and satellite. As

Overview of Broadband Satellite Networks

the demand for new applications increases, "best effort" service of the
Internet will become inadequate and will result in lack of user satisfaction.
Over the years, the Internet has undergone many changes in traffic profiles
and applications, in bandwidth capacity and utilization, and in the number of
domains and their degree of connections. But the future Internet infrastructure
necessitates a very different architecture supporting high Quality of Service
(QoS) .
A satellite communication
network plays
a significant role
in
supporting access to the Internet through a hybrid, satellite/terrestrial, or a
two-way satellite IP network
infrastructure. A satellite communications
network is distinguished by several characteristics such as global coverage,
scalability, broadcast capability, bandwidth-on-demand flexibility, multicast
capability, and reliability. Satellite is an excellent candidate to provide
broadband integrated Internet access. The current satellite systems operate in
C and
Ku
frequency
bands.
Most
of the
proposed
satellite
network
architectures use geostationary orbit (GSa), non-geostationary orbits (NGSO)
and multi-spot beams at Ka-band frequencies.
The next generation satellite multimedia networks can be divided into
two classes. The first is a broadband satellite connectivity network in which
full end-to-end user connectivity is established. The proposed global satellite
connectivity networks such as SpaceWay, EuroSkyWay, and Astrolink have
onboard processing and switching capabilities. On the other hand, regional
access networks like StarBand, IPStar, and WildBlue are intended to provide
Internet access. These access systems employ non-regenerative payloads. The
critical requirement is to provide high data rate Internet access, global
connectivity, and provisioning of QoS within these next generation satellite
network systems. For example, a user initiates a voice-over-IP call and
expects the call to be intelligible. From a human point of view, call quality is
subjective but objective measures of packet rate, delay, jitter, and loss are
required for an intelligible call and must be supplied by the network.
The IP based broadband satellite network for both global connectivity
and access must support user demand for QoS. A major effort is underway by
the Internet Engineering Task Force (lETF) in proposing QoS architectures to
provide guaranteed service level to different applications. These architectures
include, Integrated Services (lntServ), Differentiated Services (DiffServ) and
Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS). The IETF proposed architectures
mainly address terrestrial networks. There is an urgent need for developing a
new satellite network infrastructure supporting QoS guarantees for broadband
applications and addressing the challenges for realizing Ka-band satellite
systems [5].

4
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
QoS approaches have been proposed to leverage the congestion
controls of TCP currently used by all Internet traffic. Unfortunately, not all
applications can reasonably make use of TCP with its elastic response to
congestion. These are not particularly suited for real-time applications, which
are built around User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Real-time Protocol (RTP) or
Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) . Specifically, QoS approaches
must be studied for real time applications such as streaming video and audio
over broadband satellite network.
Several technical challenges exist for a broadband satellite network to
support high quality, high-speed Internet access. Solutions for various system
architecture options range from a simple repeater to a sophisticated satellite
with on-board processing and switching, ATM or fast packet, MPLS/GMPLS
with multiple spot beams and intersatellite links. QoS architectures for those
satellite networks supporting multimedia services must be developed.
In this chapter, an overview of the Internet evolution and broadband
applications is provided. Then, a global network infrastructure is described
including terrestrial and satellite backbone and access networks with principal
networking requirements.
A brief discussion
on the
satellite' networks
evolution covering circuit oriented, packet oriented, and multimedia networks
is given followed by an overview of backbone technologies e.g., ATM, IP,
DWDM, GMPLS and access technologies, DSL, cable, hybrid fiber coax,
wireless, and satellite. Finally, for easy navigation through the book, a chapter
outline with brief descriptions is given.
1.2 BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
1.2.1 Internet Evolution
The evolution of the Internet is revolutionizing the information access
and communications capabilities by several orders of magnitude including
technological developments and even a person's lifestyle. The Internet has
received tremendous success providing services ranging from shopping,
finding local entertainment to children's homework. It was formed by global
interconnection of thousands of computers, communication systems and
information systems. Over the years, the emerging network architectures and
data structures interconnecting various heterogeneous information systems
made it a truly global information infrastructure.
In 1969, the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
(known as ARPA or DARPA), an agency within the Department of Defense,

commissioned
a
wide-area
computer
network
called
the
ARPANET
interconnecting computers at universities, research institutions in the U.S. and
selected NATO countries. This network was based on packet switching as
opposed to circuit switching. Circuit switching traditionally used by voice
oriented networks uses dedicated links and introduces wasteful resource
utilization and long setup delays. On the other hand, packet switching
provides better utilization and is efficient for bursty traffic, which is typical of
computer-to-computer communication. Table 1.1 shows a major sequence of
events ofthe Internet evolution.

The U.S. Federal government played a significant role in creating and
developing the Internet, whereas the private sector made it available on a
global scale. The steadily increased capacity of personal computers, and
significant

contributed
to
the
Internet's
growth .
Many
technical
advances,
in

UNIX

6
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
Workstations, Ethernet, digital communications, optical transmission, and
underlying semiconductor technology, contributed to the Internet evolution,
and made it possible for sophisticated applications across the globe.
In the mid 1980s, the National Science Foundation (NSF) initiated
NSFNET for the Science and Education communities. Within two years,
NSFNET backbone was operating at T1 (1.544 Mbps) augmenting the
ARPANET. NSFNET was decommissioned in 1990.
An architecture was created for interconnecting independent networks
seamlessly without changing any of the underlying networks. A global
addressing mechanism was needed to enable computers on different networks
to reference and communicate with one another. The Internet design made
computers responsible for keeping information in order and resending lost
data wile the commercial data networking services at the time made the
underlying network responsible.
Gateways (or routers) were developed
between the networks to
handle the dissimilar data rates, packet sizes, error conditions, and interfaces.
The gateways would also check the destination Internet addresses of each
packet to determine the gateway to which it should be forwarded . These
functions
combined with certain end-to-end functions produced reliable
communication from source to destination .
The TCP/IP protocol suite was developed and refined over a period of
four more years and, in 1980, it was adopted as a standard by the U.S.
Department of Defense. On January I, J983 the ARPANET converted to
TCP/IP as its standard host protocol. Gateways were used to pass packets to
and from host computers on "local area networks".
The rapid growth of the Internet has triggered the design of a new and
larger address space (i.e., IP version 6 address space); today's Internet uses IP
version 4. There is growing recognition in the Internet technical community
that expansion of the address space is needed, as is the development of
transition schemes that allow interoperation between IPv4 and IPv6 while
migrating to IPv6.
In
the
early
1970s,
ARPA
began
to explore
two
alternative
applications of packet switching technology based on the use of synchronous
satellites (SATNET) and ground-based packet radio (PRNET). Linking these
two networks and the ARPANET as separate and independent networks
resulted in the creation of the Internet program. These two systems differed in
significant ways from the ARPANET so as to take advantage of the broadcast
and wireless aspects of radio communications. Originally, SATNET software
was to be embedded into an ARPANET packet switch, and the two networks

One of the significant features of the Internet architecture is the
ability
of
decoupling
applications
from
the
underlying
networking
technologies. The Internet reference network architecture is composed of end
nodes called hosts, linked by the subnetworks. All the hosts belonging to the
same subnetwork exchange data directly, while the crossing of subnetworks

8
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
boundaries is enabled by means of intermediate network nodes called routers.
Hosts and routers exchange data by means of the Internet Protocol (IP) - the
universal protocol used by the heterogeneous network components to offer a
unified abstraction of the network service at the network layer. [8]
IP offers network service in the form of data units called packets or
datagrams. The network provides best effort service without assurance on the
delivery of the packets to the intended recipient. Intermediate nodes route a
packet addressed to a given destination
using routing tables
built by
exchanging information with other intermediate nodes by means of custom
protocols.
A subsidiary protocol, the Internet Control Message Protocol
(ICMP), supports IP by offering some basic control capabilities, such as
sending packets and asking an upstream packet source to slow down the
packet transmission rate in the event of congestion.
The basic specification of IP does not provide support to point-to-
multipoint communications. IP runs over point-to-point links such as GSTN
and ISDN dial-up connections, using either the PPP or the serial link IP
(SLIP), as well as over LANs such as Ethernet, GigE, Frame Relay, and ATM
networks. IP can also run over satellite and other wireless links, and Dense
Wavelength Division Multiplexed (DWDM) technology . The focus of this
book is to treat IP over satellite in detail.
The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) [9] offers a reliable,
sequenced delivery of streams of data. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol
and the successful delivery of packets is notified by means of explicit
acknowledgement packets,
and retransmission is triggered
whenever an
acknowledgement time-out expires. A windowing flow control scheme is
used to avoid the overrunning of slow receivers, and to allow the traffic
source to adapt to network overload . In particular, the number of outstanding
packets, that is, the number of packets a source is entitled to transmit while
waiting for an acknowledgment (window size), is tuned according to a
probing of available bandwidth.
On the other hand, User Datagram Protocol
(UDP) provides an unreliable service and adds differentiation of packet flows
within a host by means of port numbers. See Chapter 1 for a discussion of
these protocols.
According to the BCD Forum broadband household survey, more
than 40% of online households are interested in subscribing to high-speed
broadband Internet Services. Current broadband households spend 40% more
time online than those with dial- up connections, and those who are interested
in subscribing to broadband services spend 50% more time online than those
who are not. 94% of all online households report that privacy and security are
important to them, and more than 40% would pay additional monthly fees for
a guarantee. According to the current Internet business model, a user signs a

Overview of Broadband Satellite Networks
9
contract with an Internet Service Provider (lSP) and pays a charge to connect
to that ISP. ISPs connect those end users to Internet backbone networks.
Backbone providers route traffic between ISPs and interconnect with other
backbone providers. Most ISPs charge a flat, monthly fee, although some
assess a per-hour charge above a certain monthly threshold. The majority of
individual
users reach their ISPs today through the telephone network.
Corporate LANs are usually linked to the ISP by means of a permanent leased
line or equivalent Virtual Circuit (VC) solutions based, for example, on frame
relay. The phone call to reach an ISP is usually a local call, because the ISP
has established a POP in that local calling area. Dial-up access to the Internet
causes a major bottleneck for users. In answer to low-speed dial-up, xDSL,
cable and satellite access technologies are being developed. The objectives of
these infrastructures are to provide higher bandwidth and speed to optimize
the use of Internet for emerging applications such as content delivery
distribution, e-finance, telemed icine, distance learning.
Currently, the Internet provides "best effort" service; forwarding data
to the destination using intermediate routers without adequate level of Quality
of Service (QoS) guarantees. As the demand for new applications increases,
the best effort service of the Internet wi11 become inadequate and wi11 result in
lack of user satisfaction. These topics are addressed in detail in chapters 5 and
7.
1.2.2 Next Generation Internet
To provide high speed and high capacity, Internet2 has been planned
by a consortium in 1998. The consortium consists of 221 members including
universities and research labs as of April 2003 [10]. Created by the Internet2
community, Abilene connects regional network aggregation points-ealled
gigaPoPs-to provide advanced network
services to over 220 Internet2
university, corporate, and affiliate member institutions in all 50 states, the
District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. The current network is a primarily
OC-192c (10 Gbps) backbone employing optical transport technology and
advanced high-performance routers.
The goals of the Abilene network are to increase the capacity of 10
Gbps, implement IPv6 while continuing the support of IPv4, and provide
97.9% to 99.99% reliability. The network plans to change the technology
focus from SONET to dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM)
increasing the optical fiber capacity. Abilene is to provide IP over DWDM

1.2.2.1 Interplantary Internet
Recently, an interplanetary Internet encompassing both terrestrial and
interplanetary
links
has
been
proposed.
A
delay-tolerant
networking
architecture consisting of structural elements centered in a new end-to-end
overlayed network protocol called 'bundling' has been proposed. In the initial
phase,
the TCP/IP protocol suite over the Internet for communication
environment of small signal propagation latencies, high data rates up to 40
Gbps for OC-768 service, bi-directional communication, continuous end-to-
end connectivity, and on-demand network access will be studied. During the
second phase, it is proposed to study different protocol stack for very large
latencies of the order of minutes, low data rates, intermittent scheduled
connectivity etc. Many details of this delay-tolerant networking study
including Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) File
Delivery Protocol (CFDP) can be found in [11].
1.2.3 What is Broadband?
Many applications such as streaming video and audio, real-time
distance learning, medical imaging, movie downloads, and online gaming,
require broadband. These applications target both residential and enterprise
users who don't have adequate access to high bandwidth. In addition, there is
no industry agreed definition of broadband .

Overview of Broadband Satellite Networks
11
The
International
Telecommunications
Union,
ITU-T
I.113
recommends broadband to be transmission capacity that isfaster than primary
rate ISDN at 1.5 or 2.0 Mbps. In the 1980s, broadband was considered to be
up to 144 Kbps, e.g., Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN). During the
past five years, around 250 Kbps and upwards, are regarded as broadband as
supported by Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL) and cable modem . Some believe
that DSL and cable modem links supporting I Mbps are broadband while
others consider broadband to be up and around 100 Mbps. The reality is
somewhere between the two.
Technology industry leaders
cannot agree
on the
definition of
broadband. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) says broadband
services are those that support bi-directional data transmission of at least 200
Kbps. John Chambers, President and CEO of Cisco says "Broadband should
be a national imperative for this country in the 21st century, just like putting a
man on the moon was an imperative in the last century". Charles Hoffman,
Covad CEO is quoted saying, "The FCC's definition of broadband, anything
over 200 Kbps, is very realistic. 100 Mbps to the home will never happen".
Although William Esrey, Chairman and CEO of Sprint says, "The vast
majority of people would have no idea what to do with 100 Mbps". Craig
Barrett, President and CEO of Intel believes that "Three hundred or 400
kilobits is not real broadband". [12]
Today about 10 million or roughly 10% of U.S. households have high
speed Internet access, mostly through cable modem or DSL connections. That
is up sharply from under 2 million households in 1999, according to Jupiter
Media Matrix [13]. The number of U.S. households with fast Internet access
still lags the number with a slower, dial-up connection. But broadband market
share is catching up as growth in the dial-up market is flattening [13].
1.2.3.1 Broadband Applications
Figure 1.3 shows the projected growth of worldwide Internet users,
showing that
most users have demand
for broadband services. In the
consumer market the growing awareness of the Internet and activities ranging
from shopping to finding local entertainment options to children 's homework
are
driving
the
steep
demand
for
more
bandwidth .
Education
and
entertainment content delivery have become two of the prime applications of
Internet. During business globalization an increase of virtual business teams,
enterprises,
increase
in competition for highly skilled
workers, service
providers and
equipment vendors,
are driving the demand
for
higher
bandwidths or broadband.

BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
Basic statistics show us the demand for and growth of Internet usage.
For example, 75% of traffic on the Internet is web-based and there are 3.6
million websites with 300-700 million web pages. The traffic consists of 80%
data and 20% voice with a traffic growth of 100-1000% per year [14].

1.2.4 Broadband Satellite
Large data transfers into, around and out of enterprise network for
national and multinational corporations is becoming very important. High-
speed Internet access has become a necessity for corporations. Service
providers, especially network and Internet providers are faced with increasing
demands for larger capacity access for the end users using bandwidth rich
applications. Particularly, there is a great need for broadband network access
across large geographical areas where there is little infrastructure such as rural
areas. Broadband satellite will be the best option to provide for these "local
loops" or "islands".
Broadband satellite is an ideal solution for geographically dispersed
broadband access needs. Figure 1.4 shows the broadband satellite service
potential market growing from 12.2 billion to over 40 billion by the year 2010
and contributing 30% of broadband service revenues worldwide [15].

Broadband satellite service offerings are divided into four different
categories: Ku-band Fixed Satellite Service (FSS), Ka-band non-regenerative
payload, Ka-band with onboard processing payload, and L-band Mobile
Satellite Service (MSS). Table 1.3 summarizes these broadband satellite
service offerings.

The first generation services that are now in place use Ku-band FSS
for two-way connections. FSS uses a single broadcast antenna to cover a large
geographical area. The next generation Ka-band systems use spot beams that
cover a much smaller area i.e., few hundreds of miles as opposed to thousands
of miles with a global beam. Adjacent cells use different frequency ranges,
but a given
frequency
range can be reused many times over a wide
geographical area. Thus there is an increase in overall capacity due to
frequency reuse. Broadband satellite systems are further discussed in Chapter
4.

Overview of Broadband Satellite Networks
1.3 GLOBAL NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE
15
The convergence of computer and telecommunications technologies
is creating vast opportunities unprecedented in the history of the technological
evolution. Data rates supported have grown from 56 Kbps in the 1960s and
1.544 Mbps (TI) in the 1970s to Internet backbone speeds of45 Mbps (DS-3)
in 1990s and OC-192 and 100 Gbps [16] towards the beginning of 2000. Data
rates in the core of the Internet network are expected to grow to hundreds of
Gbps in the future.
Telecommunication networks and computer networks
developed
from different sets of requirements for different objectives. Traditional
telecommunication networks use circuit switching to provide a constant data
rate for clear and uninterrupted voice transmission. To insure the constant
data rate, telecommunication networks place control functions in the network.
Computer networks
adopted
packet
switching,
which
facilitates
statistical multiplexing of bursty data transmissions from different sources
[] 7]. Packet networks rely on the processing power of customer premises
equipment to control
the network . IP wide
area
networks
have
used
connectionless packet forwarding routers in the network nodes, as they have
relied on end stations to establish and maintain reliable TCP connections.
While the global telephone network was designed to support one
service, the Internet was architected to support a broad range of data
communications services. IP was designed to operate over a wide range of
network technologies. Like other network architectures, the Internet has a
layered set of protocols. IP defines an addressing plan and a packet delivery
service. There are no guarantees regarding the bandwidth or delays . Many
protocols can also run on top of JP, e.g., TCP, UDP, and STP. However,
TCP/IP does
not address real-time applications well. To support high
bandwidth applications such as video conferencing, which require 100 times
the bandwidth required for traditional non real-time applications, broadband
ISDN
(B-ISDN) and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
have been
developed to support real-time services with QoS guarantees.
Although ATM is being used in some networks as a backbone
technology, JP is becoming more popular as a backbone protocol, not just
because of the success of the Internet but also due to ease of configuration,
protocol
ubiquity across the network, easier to add new services, less
overhead, and adequate performance.
The future network architectures employing new technologies such as
MPLS,
RSVP,
traffic
management
and
QoS
will
support
multimedia

16
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
applications like media streaming and content delivery distribution for both
enterprise and residential users.
Figure 1.5 shows a global communication network scenario providing
connectivity among corporate networks, Internet, and the ISPs. One of the key
requirements for the emerging "global network" is rich connectivity among
fixed
as well
as
mobile
users. Advances
in switching and
transport
technologies have made increases in transmission bandwidth and switching
speeds possible, and still more dramatic increases are achievable via optical
switching. The future generation of communication networks promises access
to multimedia services, wireless (cellular and satellite) access to broadband
networks and seamless roaming between different systems [18, 19]. The
networking technologies can vary between ATM, Frame Relay, IP and optical
backbones. The access technology options are dial up, cable, DSL, and
satellite [20]. The future Global Information Infrastructure (GIl), covers a
wide range of technologies, open standard protocols, interfaces and standard
formats enabling heterogeneous terminal interoperability and a wide variety
of multimedia applications (e.g., audio, video, data, and animation). The
infrastructure consists of network
terminals and
servers
connected
by
communication links via network nodes. These nodes are routers or switches
implementing the information exchange through packet forwarding.
Mobile communications are supported by second generation, digital
cellular Global Service for Mobile Communications (GSM) and, data service
by Generic Packet Radio Services (GPRS). Third generation systems such as
IMT-2000
can
provide
2
Mbps
and
144 Kbps
indoor and
vehicular
environments. Even fourth and fifth generation systems are being studied to
provide data rates 2-20 Mbps and 20-100 Mbps respectively.
Several broadband satellite networks at Ka-band are planned and
being developed to provide such global connectivity for both fixed satellite
service (FSS) and mobile satellite service (MSS) using Geosynchronous
(GSO) and Non-Geosynchronous (NGSO) satellites [21]. Currently GSO
satellite networks with Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSATs) at Ku-bands
are
being
used
for credit card verifications, rental
cars, and
banking
applications.

1.3.1 Requirements
Future global network infrastructures should support the following
requirements:
â€¢
Data
rates:
Applications
such
as
videostreaming,
media
cast
distributions,
telemedicine
applications,
two-way
telephonic
education, require rates ranging from a few hundred megabits to
several gigabits. Broadband systems have approximately 11-30 Mbps
transmission speeds. The target speed for 4G cellular will be around
10-20 Mbps. Many of the advanced satellite systems are being
designed to meet high bandwidth demands.
â€¢
Delay: Real-time applications require a minimum delay of 400 ms
[22] and packet transfer delays for other classes of service are even
more stringent. Advances in queuing and packet processing will
contribute to the reduction in delays.
â€¢
Mobility: 4G cellular systems will require at least 2 Mbps for moving
vehicles.
â€¢
Wide coverage: Next-generation systems must use GSa systems to
provide wide coverage. Mobile satellite networks using NGSa cover
roaming and handover to other systems.
â€¢
Scalability: Network scalability should support large number of users,
e.g., a few millions, and resources in proportion to the number of

18
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
users, application scalability providing the necessary QoS levels
without performance degradation, i.e., 100,000 users with multimedia
service support and QoS level guarantees per systems.
â€¢
Quality of Service : Application QoS must be supported providing
guaranteed bandwidth, delay, packet loss and availability.
â€¢
Security: User authentication, privacy, encryption, and end-to-end
security must be supported.
â€¢
Multicast: In addition to unicast,
IP multicast service must
be
provided.
â€¢
Interoperability: Standard protocol interoperability must be provided
at all
levels with
interface designs
supporting homogeneity of
terminals, networks and user-to-user applications.
A recent broadband application for a global connectivity includes
interconnection of broadband wireless 802.11b and a Boeing Connexion
satellite network. Scandinavian airlines offers high speed Internet access
aboard some long-haul flights letting passengers surf the Internet or send
email.ThisbroadbandwirelessserviceisprovidedthroughConnexion.1t
requires installing two antennas on each aircraft, one to transmit data to
satellites and one to receive data. A server and a routing system inside the
plane relay signals to and from plug-in ports at the seats or wireless
networking cards in passenger's laptops. A similar service is being provided
by Lufthansa in collaboration with Boeing.
A global
communication
infrastructure
is possible with
proper
selection
of backbone
and
access
technologies. Section
1.5 discusses
backbone technologies - Frame Relay, ATM, IP, DWDM,
MPLS, and
satellite. Access solutions covering Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), cable,
hybrid fiber coax, wireless, and satellite are described in Section 1.6.
1.4SATELLITE NETWORKS EVOLUTION
Arthur C. Clark first proposed the use of Geostationary Earth Orbit
(GEO) spacecraft operating at an altitude of 22,300
miles or 35,680
kilometers [23]. John Pierce in the late 1940s wrote several articles discussing
how a satellite communication system could be realized by bouncing signals
off of passive satellites [24]. The first trans-Atlantic telephone cable (TAT-1)
was designed to carry 36 simultaneous phone calls for nearly $50 million. On
October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, marking the beginning
of
the
modern
space
age.
The
National
Aeronautical
and
Space
Administration (NASA) consequently formed in 1958. However, it was the
Army Ballistic Missile Agency that actually launched the first American
satellite, "Explorer" on January 31 1958.

Overview of Broadband Satellite Networks
19
Echo I, launched in 1960 in a medium altitude orbit, successfully
bounced signals back to earth, but required high transmission power to
overcome path losses on the order of 180 dB. Telstar I (1962) was an active
satellite, receiving and retransmitting signals, but it suffered unanticipated
radiation damage from the Van Allen radiation belt and operated for only a
few weeks. Telstar II, launched in 1963 with a capacity for one TV channel as
well as a number oftelephone channels, was more radiation resistant.
The
1962 Communications Satellite Act in the U.S. established
COMSAT
as
a
quasi-governmental
corporation.
The
advantages
of
geosynchronous orbits were realized and the first commercial satellite went
into service in 1965. Echo cancellers using digital technology were introduced
in 1979 to cope with long transmission delays. Intelsat was formed as an
international body to design, develop, and maintain the operation of a global
commercial communications satellite system, launching Intelsat I (Early Bird)
in 1965, which provided 240 circuits between the United States and Europe.
Intelsat II and III soon followed, and in the seven years following Early Bird's
deployment, Intelsat launched and deployed four generations of satellite,
reaching 6000 circuits in Intelsat IV (1970). Over the next 25 years, Intelsat
grew to over 140 member countries and expanded its fleet of satellites to
nearly
20 in-orbit spacecraft. Intelsat
became
responsible
for carrying
approximately
90% of international
telephone traffic
and
virtually
all
international television programming.
Beginning in 1972 Canada launched ANIK I, domestic satellite
operators began operating primarily to service the television entertainment
industries followed by the United States, Indonesia and Japan in the 1970s;
India, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, Israel, China, Sweden, and Luxembourg in
the
I980s; Argentina,
Pakistan,
Chile,
Thailand, Korea, Malaysia, and
Portugal in the 1990s [25]. In 1984 PanAmSat became the world 's first
private satellite operator, generating a privatization of Intelsat and Eutelsat,
the two largest satellite consortia. Today private operators offering global
coverage, represented by PanAmSat, Loral Skynet via the Loral Global
Alliance, and SES Global formed by GE Americom and SES/Astra dominate
the satellite industry.
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite systems, with call handoff from one
satellite to another, were perceived around 1990 as a solution for global
coverage. Large investments were made in several projects, particularly
Iridium in which Motorola played the leading role. The systems failed as
consumer-oriented businesses because of cost and other factors, but continue
to exist on a smaller scale for vital services such as news reporting from
remote locations.

20
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
The first and still very important satellite application
was for
distribution of broadcast radio and television programming to affiliate stations
and cable systems.
This application of satellite systems was stimulated
largely by Home Box Office (HBO) through satellite distribution of its
programming to cable operators in 1975, via RCA's Satcom I. Direct satellite
broadcasting to
residences
did
not
begin
until the
I990s, when
the
technologies of high-compression digital video (primarily MPEG) and a
combination of high-powered satellites in the higher-frequency (Ku) band and
the associated small, low-cost earth stations made it economically feasible.
Direct satellite broadcasting continues as a primary entertainment distribution
medium, and satellite broadcasting has many other critical applications such
as transmission of earth monitoring and geo-positioning data. Two-way
satellite
communications
has
also
found
many
applications,
including
telephone and video service to remote villages in undeveloped parts of the
world, and as an Internet access system.
Table 1.4 shows satellite networks evolution.
1.4.1 Circuit Oriented
Traditionally,
telecommunication
networks
have
used
circuit
switching to establish voice calls with signaling protocols. With the recent
evolution of Internet, many satellite systems are being planned and designed
to employ packet transport protocols. However, satellite systems for mobile
and personal communications continue to use circuit switching. For example,
2 G wireless networks offering less than 10 Kbps provide circuit switched
data (e.g., IS-136, GSM) . Some of the LEO satellite networks providing tens
of Kbps upstream and a few Mbps downstream could be circuit switched
networks. There are some products supporting applications for file transfer,
characterized by lengthy sequences of data between point-to-point locations.
1.4.2 Packet Oriented
The Atlantic Packet Satellite Network (SATNET) was the first packet
satellite network developed for demonstrating (a) packet satellite technology
for data, (b) interface and internetting requirements for voice satellite systems
and (c) use of satellite networks for user applications [26]. The experiment

coordination. The DARPA, the British Post Office (BPO), and the Norwegian
Telecommunications Authority (NTA), with the participation of the Defense
Communications Agency (DCA) and the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile

Experiments
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
SATNET is composed of four earth stations, which communicate
with each other over a shared channel derived from the Atlantic Intelsat IV-A
satellite. The earth stations are Intelsat Standard A with approximately 30-m
antennas and G/T values of 40.7 dB. One of the earth stations located at
COM SAT Laboratories in Clarksburg, MD, is physically smaller, with a G/T
value of approximately 29.7 dB. It is included in SATNET solely for
experimental purposes and is not involved with the passage of traffic. While
the hardware facilities of SATNET are limited to four earth stations, the
design activities assume that potential future networks might include hundreds
of earth stations.
A 38 KHz channel is shared among the earth stations via the demand-
access algorithms, which are under test. The channel is one of the 800
possible frequency division multiplexed channels in the global SPADE
transponder of the Atlantic Intelsat IV-A satellite. This full-period assigned
channel
operates at
nominal
power
levels,
supporting 64
Kbps
data
transmission with a bit error probability on the order of 10-6 to 10-
7 to an
Intelsat Standard A earth station.
The data rate for a packet can be 16, 32, or 64 Kbps or a combination
of these rates, e.g., a variable portion of the front end of a packet can be
transmitted at 16 Kbps with the remainder at 64 Kbps. These rates are
achieved with a 32-kilo symbol per second modem by using appropriate
modulation (BPSK or QPSK) and coding (no coding or rate one-half
convolutional encoded) combinations.
The interface includes a Viterbi
decoder. It also provides both a local and remote capability to control certain
system parameters, e.g., preamble length, and to support certain monitoring
(both on- and off-line) and testing functions.
The experimental activities can be grouped into four broad categories:
channel-oriented,
network-oriented,
user-oriented,
and
applications
experiments/demonstrations. The channel-oriented measurement activities
consist of measurements of channel and equipment performance in the
broadcast packet satellite environment. The network-oriented experiments
measure the performance of various demand assignment algorithms. The
initial Satellite Interface Message Processor (IMP) software implemented the
fixed-TDMA
(F-TDMA),
Spread-ALOHA (S-ALOHA), and reservation-
TDMA (R-TDMA) protocols. In the case of S-ALOHA protocol, software
was developed which allowed each physical Satellite IMP to emulate up to 10
additional Satellite IMPs, greatly increasing the accuracy of the measurement.

Overview of Broadband Satellite Networks
23
Later versions of the Satellite IMP software include the Fixed Priority
Oriented Demand Assignment (FPODA) and Contention PODA (CPODA)
protocols and
F-TDMA.
This
Satellite IMP software supports channel
protocol and network protocol experiments involving point-to-point and
broadcast datagram and stream traffic.
User-oriented measurements demonstrated the capability to support
certain
types of applications such as file transfer.
Application specific
experiments and demonstrations showed the use of SATNET for providing
service to certain
applications.
Digitized speech
produced
by a voice
compression device (linear predictive coder) at bit rates of 2.4, 3.6, or 4.8
Kbps is transmitted over SATNET using the stream traffic handling capability
ofPODA.
SATNET has been an effective tool in the development of packet
satellite technology. The experiment demonstrated the effective utilization of
a packet-switched network, i.e., the ARPANET, as a central vehicle for
effectively coordinating a large project among a geographically dispersed
group of people and for remotely controlling experiments and collecting data,
maintaining and developing software, and monitoring system performance.
These experimental results highlighted the high impact developments
for satellite Internet that included higher transmission frequencies (e.g., 14/11
and 30/20 GHz), multibeam satellites, satellite onboard processing, and
intersatellite links.
1.4.3 Multimedia
Satellite networks due to natural global coverage, can be used for
broadband multimedia services covering voice, data, and video. In particular,
broadband satellite IP networks can support both multicast and broadcast
along with point-to-point services. The services supported include high-speed
Internet access
via corporate ISPs, data distribution, videoconferencing,
streaming, caching, and TV broadcast. The two-way IP satellite systems
supporting multimedia services, technical challenges, and provisioning of
OoS forms the major emphasis of this book as described in chapters 6-9.
Examples of satellite IP OoS performance models applying the IntServ,
DiffServ and MPLS technologies developed for terrestrial environment are
described in Part Three . In addition, ATM transport used for satellite
networks with onboard switching and support of OoS is described in Part
Four. The simulation results provide design guidelines in selection of the
buffers and QoS parameters for satellite networks.

BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
1.5 BACKBONE TECHNOLOGIES
This subsection provides a brief overview of backbone technologies.
1.5.1 Frame Relay
Frame Relay is a standard communication protocol that is specified in
ITU-T (formerly CCITT) recommendations 1.122 and Q.922 which add relay
and routing functions to the data link layer of the OSI model
[27].
Subsequently, the Frame Relay Forum has developed
the Frame relay
specification for Wide Area Networks. Frame relay services were developed
by service providers for enterprise as a cost effective and a more flexible
alternative to Time Division Multiplexing (TOM) and private line services.
Enterprises needed dedicated connectivity between offices but could not
necessarily afford dedicated circuits. Meanwhile service providers required a
reliable means to subscribe their bandwidth-constrained networks.
Frame relay protocol has been particularly effective for data traffic.
Carriers generally use frame relay as access technology and ATM as a
transport. The network architecture requires carriers to maintain a completely
dedicated ATM/frame relay network in addition to their IP and voice
networks.
The rapid increase in high bandwidth communication is the main
reason for using Frame Relay technology.
There are two main factors that
influence the rapid demand for high-speed networking: (a) rapid increase in
use of LANs, and (b) use of fiber optic links.
Frame relay is a packet
switching technology, which relies on low error rate digital transmission links
and high performance processors.
Frame relay technology was designed to
cover: (a) low latency and higher throughput, (b) bandwidth on demand, (c)
dynamic sharing of bandwidth, and (d) backbone network.
For enterprises, frame relay is a well-understood technology, and by
definition, is a layer 2 technology that supports over subscription. The frame
relay technology has some design advantages as well as restrictions including:
â€¢
Unpredictable bandwidth and maximum speed capacity at DS3.
â€¢
Hierarchical
aggregation
schemes
that
use
hub
and
spoke
architectures
â€¢
Scaling complexities by having to add additional layer 2 addresses to
different sites rather than by IP's inherent self-healing and learning
capabilities.
â€¢
Used for interconnecting LANs and particularly WANs, and recently,
for voice and videoconferencing.
â€¢
Provides LAN-to-LAN connectivity at 56 Kbps to 1.5 Mbps.

Overview of Broadband Satellite Networks
â€¢
Offers congestion control and higher performance.
Frame Relay Data Unit
25
The frame structure in a frame relay network consists of two flags
indicating the beginning and the end of the frame ; an address field, an
information field and a frame check sequence. In addition to the address, the
address field contains functions that warn of overload and indicate which
frames should be discarded first. The fields and their purpose are discussed
below.
â€¢
Flag - All frames begin and end with a flag consisting of an octet
composed of a known bit pattern: a zero followed by six ones and a
zero (01111110).
â€¢
Address - In the two octets in the address field, the first six bits of the
first octet and the first four bits of the second octet are used for
addressing. These 10 bits, which form the DLCI, select the next
destination to which the frame is to be transported.
â€¢
CR - Command response is not used by the frame-relay protoco\' It is
sent transparently through the frame-relay nodes and can be made
available to users as required .
â€¢
EA - At the end of each address octet there is an extended address bit
that allows extension ofthe DLCI field to more than 10 bits. If the EA
bit is set to "0", another address octet will follow. If it is set to "I", the
octet in question is the last one in the address field.
â€¢
FECN
-
If overload
occurs
in the
network,
forward
explicit
congestion notification is indicated to alert the receiving end. The
network makes this indication, and end-users need not take any
specific action .
â€¢
BECN - Similar to FECN, backward explicit congestion notification
alerts the sending end to an overload situation in the network.
â€¢
DE - Discard Eligibility indicates that the frame is to be discarded in
case of overload. This indication can be regarded as a prioritizing
function, although frames without a DE indication can also be
discarded.
â€¢
Information field - This is where user information is found. The
network operator decides how many octets the field is allowed to
contain, but the Frame Relay Forum recommends a maximum of
1,600.
The
information passes through
the network completely
unchanged and is not interpreted by the frame-relay protocol.
â€¢
FCS - The frame check sequence checks the frame for errors. All bits
in the frame, except the flags and FCS, are checked .
The frame relay frame format is shown in figure 1.6.

Frame Relay WAN Architecture
Figure
1.7 shows a frame
relay
network with
various offices
connected via frame relay to four aggregation hubs. Depending on the size of
the organization and the speeds at which different regional offices connect,
the hub will have at least two large WAN routers.
For some organizations,
hubs may be fed by hundreds of regional locations through frame relay or
private line connections.
Although some of the traffic may terminate at its
locally connected 'hub' data center, most of the traffic 'hair pins' in and out
of the local data center on its way to a remote hub or destination. In this case,
the hub sites provide statistical multiplex gains.

ATM
is
an
International
Telecommunication

Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) Broadband-Integrated
Services
Digital
Network
(B-ISDN)
standard
for
cell
relay
wherein
information for multiple service types, such as voice, video, or data, is
conveyed in small, fixed-size cells.
ATM networks are connection oriented.
It was originally conceived as a high-speed transfer technology for voice,
video, and data over public networks. The ATM Forum extended the ITU-T's
vision ofATM for use over public and private networks.
ATM is a cell-switching and multiplexing technology that combines
the
benefits
of
circuit
switching
(guaranteed
capacity
and
constant
transmission delay) with those of packet switching (flexibility and efficiency
for burst traffic) (11). It provides scalable bandwidth from a few megabits per
second
(Mbps) to many
gigabits per second
(Gbps).
Because of its
asynchronous nature, ATM is more efficient than synchronous technologies,
such as time-division multiplexing (TOM). With TOM, each user is assigned
to a time slot, and no other station can send in that time slot. If a station has a
lot of data to send, it can send only when its time slot comes up, even if all
other time slots are empty.
If, however, a station has nothing to transmit
when its time slot comes up, the time slot is sent empty and is wasted .
Because ATM is asynchronous, time slots are available on demand with
information identifying the source of the transmission contained in the header
of each ATM cell.

ATM Cell Format
An ATM cell consists of 48 bytes of data with a 5-byte header as
shown in figure 1.9 [28].
The cell size was determined by ITU-T as a
compromise between voice and data requirements. The header fields are as
follows:
â€¢
Generic Flow Control (GFC) -
Provides local functions, such as
identifying multiple stations that share a single ATM interface.
â€¢
Virtual Path Identifier (VPI) - In conjunction with the VCI, identifies
the next destination of a cell as it passes through a series of ATM
switches on the way to its destination.
â€¢
Virtual Channel Identifier (VCI) -
In conjunction with the VPI,
identifies the next destination of a cell as it passes through a series of
ATM switches on the way to its destination.
â€¢
Payload Type (PT) - If the cell contains user data, the second bit
indicates congestion, and the third bit indicates whether the cell is the
last in a series of cells that represent a single ATM Adaptation Layer
(AAL5) frame.
â€¢
Cell Loss Priority (CLP) -
Indicates whether the cell should be
discarded if it encounters extreme congestion as it moves through the
network.
If the CLP bit equals I, the cell should be discarded in
preference to cells with the CLP bit equal to zero.
â€¢
Header Error Control (HEC) - Calculates checksum only on the
header.

Figure 1.9: ATM cell structure
There are two types of ATM services: Permanent Virtual Circuits
(PVC) and Switched Virtual Circuits (SVC).
PVC allows direct static
connectivity between sites similar to a leased line. It guarantees availability
of a connection and does not require a signaling protocol. On the other hand,
SVC allows dynamic set-up and release of connections. Dynamic call control
requires a signaling protocol between the ATM end point and the switch.
This service provides flexibility.
However, it results in a signaling overhead
in setting up the connection.
Classes ofService
The different ATM classes of service are Constant Bit Rate (CBR),
real-time Variable Bit Rate (rt-VBR), non-real-time Variable Bit Rate (nrt-
VBR),
Unspecified
Bit
Rate (UBR),
Available
Bit Rate
(ABR), and
Guaranteed Frame Rate (GFR).
Constant Bit Rate (CBR): The CBR service category is used by
connections that request a static amount of bandwidth that is continuously
available during the connection lifetime. This amount of bandwidth
is
characterized by a Peak Cell Rate (PCR) value. Once the connection is
established, the negotiated ATM layer QoS is assured to all cells when all
cells are conforming to the relevant conformance tests. In the CBR capability,
the source can emit cells at the PCR at any time and for any duration and the
QoS commitments still pertain. CBR service is intended to support real-time
applications requiring tightly constrained delay variation (e.g., voice, video),
but is not restricted to these applications.
Real-Time Variable Bit Rate (rt-VBR): rt-VBR service is intended for
real-time applications. rt-VBR connections are characterized in terms of a
Peak Cell Rate (PCR), Sustainable Cell Rate (SCR), and Maximum Burst Size
(MBS). Sources are expected to transmit at a rate, which varies with time.

30
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
Non-real-time Variable Bit Rate (nrt-VBR): nrt-VRB service is for
non-real-time applications which have bursty traffic characteristics and which
are characterized in terms of a PCR, SCR, and MBS. For cells transferred
within the traffic contract, low cell loss ratio is expected. This service has no
delay bounds.
Unspecified Bit Rate (UBR):
UBR service is for non-real-time
applications, not requiring tightly constrained delay and delay variation (e.g.,
file transfer, email). UBR does not specify traffic related service guarantees.
There are no guarantees or commitments made about loss or delay variations
experienced in the network.
Available Bit Rate (ABR): ABR is an ATM layer service for which
the limiting ATM layer transfer characteristics provided by the network may
change subsequent to connection establishment. A flow control mechanism is
specified which supports several types of feedback to control the source rate
in response to changing ATM layer transfer characteristics. This feedback is
conveyed to the source through specific control cells. End system that adapts
its traffic in accordance with the feedback will experience a low cell loss ratio
and obtain a fair share of available bandwidth according to a network specific
allocation policy. ABR service does not require bounding the delay or delay
variation experienced by a given connection. ABR is not for real-time
applications. On the establishment of an ABR connection, the end-system will
specify to the network both a maximum required bandwidth i.e., PCR and a
minimum usable bandwidth i.e., Minimum Cell Rate (MCR).
Guaranteed Frame Rate (GFR): GFR is an enhancement to the UBR
service category. GFR will provide a minimum rate guarantee to ves at the
frame level. The GFR service also allows for the fair usage of any extra
network bandwidth. GFR is likely to be used by applications that can neither
specify the traffic parameters needed for VBR VC, nor have capability for
ABR. Current internetworking applications fall into this category, and are not
designed to run over QoS-based networks . Routers separated by satellite
ATM networks can use the GFR service to establish VCs between one
another.
GFR
can

implemented
using
per-VC
queuing
or

management.

treated differently by an ATM network [29].

1.5.3IP
The
Internet consists of several
groups
of networks
-
global
backbones, regional networks, commercial networks and local area networks.
Internet protocol has become the universal network layer protocol for both
wired and wireless networks.
At the transport layer, Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) have become the most
popular ones. The TCP/IP protocol suite
builds
the
interconnection of
networks to provide global communication services over the Internet. Two
networks are interconnected through a router, which forwards the packets.
Every host on the internetwork is assigned an IP address. When a host
has multiple network adapters, each adapter has a separate IP address. The IP
address consists of two parts, network number and host number. The network
number part of the IP address is assigned by a central authority and is unique
throughout the Internet. The authority for assigning the host number part of
the IP address resides with the organization which controls the network
identified by the network number.
Figure I. I0 shows the protocol architecture for IP networks, with
advanced features including MPLS and IPSec, which are described in Chapter
7. This section briefly describes TCP, UDP and other IP protocols with
formats and examples.

TCP/IP protocol
The TCP/fP protocol suite is the mostly used Internet protocol for
global networks.
Many of the Internet applications such as file transfer,
email,
web
browsing, streaming media,
and
news groups
use TCP/IP
protocols.
Figure 1.11 shows the TCP/IP protocol stack with respect to
ISOIOSI protocol. The overhead introduced at each layer to the application
datagram is also described.
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
TCP provides reliable transmission of data in an IP environment.
TCP corresponds to the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI reference model
[30].
Among the services TCP provides are stream data transfer, reliability,
efficient flow control, full-duplex operation, and multiplexing.
TCP offers
reliability
by
providing
connection-oriented,
end-to-end
reliable
packet
delivery through an internetwork by using acknowledgments. The reliability
mechanism of TCP allows devices to deal with lost, delayed , duplicate, or
misread packets.
The lost packets are detected by a time-out mechanism.
TCP offers efficient flow control mechanism by using sliding windows to
avoid
buffer
overflow.
TCP
provides
a
full-duplex
operation
and
multiplexing of data.
Using IP Security protocol (IPSec), Internet security
can be obtained.
Figure 1.12 shows the format of a TCP segment.

User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
UDP is a connectionless transport-layer protocol that enables best
effort datagrams to be transmitted between host system applications. Unlike
TCP, UDP adds no reliability, flow-control , or error-recovery functions to IP
[30]. It uses an 8-byte header. The format of a UDP segment is shown in

Internet Protocol (IP)
IP is a connectionless protocol working at the network layer (layer 3).
IP has two primary responsibilities: providing connectionless best effort
delivery
of datagrams
across
and
between
networks;
and
providing
fragmentation and reassembly of datagrams to support data
links with
different maximum transmission unit (MTU) sizes.
IPv4 and IPv6
Major percentage of traffic carried across the Internet belongs to
commercial applications which demand guaranteed or improved Quality of
Service, security, scalability, and a range of other enhancements. The
immediate consequence is the tremendous traffic burden on the current
worldwide network, leading to a degradation of the QoS available to end
users. This motivated, the IETF to develop IP version 6 (IPv6) while
continuing to refine IPv4 and adding other QoS improvement technologies.
[31 ]
Scalability
Each
Internet
address
must uniquely
identify a particular host
interface and provide enough information to route a packet from anywhere on
the network to that interface. The IPv4 packet header includes 32-bit address
field providing approximately 4.3 billion
unique bit combinations with
useable addresses. These addresses are divided into three classifications: 126
class-A networks, each including about 16.8 million unique addresses; 16,382

Overview ofBroadband Satellite Networks
35
c1ass-B networks, each supporting 56,535 addresses; and two million class-C
networks each supporting 254 hosts. The remaining addresses are reserved for
other uses. This decreases the theoretical 3.7 billion hosts to about 100 million
practical addresses.
The IPv6 enhancement is a 128-bit addressing scheme and allows 3.4
x 1038 unique bit combinations. Out of the 2,128 bit combinations, II are
either reserved or used to identify the packets are unicast while 80 bits are
used by individual organizations for creating their own hierarchies and
identifying individual interfaces. A 12-bit Top-Level Aggregation Identifier
(TLA 10) field identifies individual core providers and limits the backbone
router tables to 8,192 entries. These segmentations reduce the theoretical 1.16
x 1038 address space to approximately 6x1032 practical addresses.
Security
The IPv4 specification does not explicitly include security. The
necessary security was applied at the upper layers, prior to transporting
packets. Increasing commercial use and a heightened awareness of electronic
transmission threats have led to the development of security mechanisms that
could be applied universally to all Internet transmissions. The IPSec, required
by the IPv6 specification, meets many basic security needs at the network
layer,
allowing
for
virtual
private
networks
and
other
applications.
Authenticated and encrypted connections are made possible by IPSec's three
principal components: Authentication Header (AH), Encapsulating Security
Payload (ESP), and Internet Key Exchange (IKE). The details on IP Security
are given in Chapter 7.
QoS
As the multimedia traffic being supported by the Internet increases,
there is a definite need to provide QoS rather than best effort service.
Sufficient buffering at congestion nodes can alleviate many of the problems
due to traffic rate differences that would otherwise interrupt video or audio
applications.
Real-time
applications cannot
handle
delays . IPv6 header
contains two fields supporting priority routing of special traffic types. A 4-bit
priority field allows applications to specify a certain priority for the traffic
they generate, thus introducing a c1ass-of-service concept to the Internet by
labeling different packets with their priority levels. Routers drop packets
bearing priorities 0-7 during periods of congestion but always try to forward
packets with priorities 8-15. Higher-priority traffic is also forwarded ahead of
lower-priority traffic, thereby decreasing network delay for time-critical
applications.

36
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
Although IP6 has priorities built into the header, IPv4 has always had
an 8-bit service type field supporting six precedence levels. QoS is provided
at sites with stringent prioritization requirements with QoS technologies e.g.,
IntServ, DiffServ, MPLS, Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) running in
concert with IP.

Figures 1.14 and 1.15 show the formats of IPv4 and IPv6 segments.
The changes from IPv4 to IPv6 fall into the following categories:
â€¢
Expanded Address Capabilities: IPv6 increases the IP address size
from 32 bits to 128 bits, to support more levels of addressing
hierarchy, and a much greater number of addressable nodes .

â€¢
Header Format Simplification: Some IPv4 header fields have been
dropped or made optional, to reduce the processing cost of packet
handling.
â€¢
Improved support for extensions and options: Changes in the way IP
header options are encoded allows for more efficient forwarding and
greater flexibility for introducing new options in the future.
â€¢

1.5.4 Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM)
Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) is the process of
multiplexing signals of different wavelengths onto a single fiber. Through this
operation, it creates many virtual fibers each capable of carrying a different
signal. At its simplest, DWDM system can be viewed as a parallel set of
optical channels, each using a slightly different light wavelength , but all
sharing a single transmission medium. This new technical solution can
increase the capacity of existing networks [32].
Internet Protocol (lP) over DWDM is the concept of sending data
packets over an optical layer using DWDM for its capacity and other
operations. Over time, the optical layer has been supplemented with more
functionality, once found only in the higher layers. Vision of an all-optical
network where all management is carried out in the- photonic layer was
created . The optical network is proposed to provide end-to-end services
completely in the optical domain, without having to convert the signal to the
electrical domain during transit.
DWDM performed on an optical fiber serves as the underlying carrier
for the
optical
network. The
narrow
channel
spacing of about
1nm
characterizes the system. Figure 1.16 depicts the general structure of the
DWDM system. The Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifier (EDFA), Multiplexer
and the Demultiplexer form the vital blocks ofthe system.

Figure 1.16: Structure ofDense Wavelength Division Multiplexing system
The concepts of optical fiber transmission, loss control,
packet
switching, network topology and synchronization play a major role in
deciding the throughput of the network. The DWDM system comprises of the
following units:
â€¢
Optical Amplifiers (OA) are used to amplify a weak, distorted signal
with the aim of generating a good signal.
â€¢
Wavelength Converters converts data on an input wavelength onto a
possibly different output wavelength within the operation bandwidth
ofthe system.
â€¢
Wavelength Add/Drop Multiplexer facilitates the evolution of the
single wavelength point-to-point optical network to the wavelength
division multiplexed networks.
â€¢
Optical Cross Connect (OXC) provides cross-connect functionality
between N input ports and N output ports, each handling a bundle of
multiplexed single-wavelength signals.
â€¢
Optical Gateway is a common transport structure that must groom
and provision traffic entering the optical layer.
A network can be physically structured in the form of a ring or a
mesh based on the connection between the various nodes. A connected
network of arbitrary topology, in which the node degree is typically more than
two, is regarded as mesh. Although the physical topology of a DWDM system
might be that of a ring, the logical traffic distribution topology can be
arbitrary.
IPoverDWDM
SONET (Synchronous Optical Network) is a standard for connecting
fiber-optic transmission systems. It defines interface standards at the physical
layer and takes care of scheduling the packets to be transported by way of
time division multiplexing. It also handles rate multiplexing, traffic grooming,
error monitoring and restoration. SONET establishes Optical Carrier (OC)

40
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
levels from 51.8 Mbps (about the same as a T-3 line) to 2.48 Gbps. The
standard protocol stack used for the SONET system is depicted in figure 1.17.
Figure 1.17: Primitive protocol stack/or SONEr over DWDM
One of the proposed solutions for transmitting IP packets reliably
over a fiber optic network is to adopt an IP over OWOM system. The
transport layer is optical and thereby maintains a high data rate. SONET does
not work very well with bursty traffic while IP over OWOM handles it better.
The IP over DWDM system increases bandwidth and reduces latency.
The system performs satisfactorily at high speeds of OC-192. The SONET
and ATM overheads are eliminated. The new architecture facilitates faster
restoration, provisioning and path determination. IP over OWOM is a strong
candidate to becoming part of the future global architecture.
The OWOM layer design has two different approaches: SONET-
centric and generic (or Closed & Open as it is widely known).
The closed architecture was designed to serve SONET systems better.
It increases the capacity in the SONET system, by utilizing the necessary
components and the technology of OWDM in the standard SONET tenninaJ.
It is dependent on higher SONET layers or any other TOM system for its
other functionalities (like Network management).
IP/OWOM systems adopted an alternative approach, which yields a
whole new transport layer, called the Open architecture. It is open in the sense
that it is not tied with SONET or other TOM systems. This case reflects
protocol transparency and exhibits all the properties of the all-optical network .
For optical networking to realize its full potential there must be a standard
interface to the optical layer. Segment B in figure 1.1 8 denotes the open
system. The customer is responsible for providing the actual interface to the
end user and for all the protection work. The IP bits enter the OWOM system
and then are transported "as is" over the high-speed connection. The details
can be found in [33].

1.5.5 Multiprotocol Label Switching
Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a solution that addresses
the issues of speed, scalability, QoS management, and traffic engineering in
the present day networks. MPLS is a solution to meet the bandwidth-
management and service requirements for next-generation IP based networks.
A key concept of MPLS is the separation of an IP router's functions into two
parts: forwarding and control. The forwarding part uses label swapping
similar to ATM switching using virtual path/virtual channel identifiers. A
label is a short fixed-length number independent of the network layer. The
label swapping technique involves a table lookup of a packet's label to
determine its route and new label value . Figure 1.19 shows the MPLS packet
forwarding concept using labels. A router capable of MPLS is a Label
Switching Router (LSR). A set of LSRs traversed by a packet is called a Label
Switched Path (LSP). A Label Edge Router (LER) at the ingress point
classifies the incoming packet and applies the right outgoing label to the
packet and forwards it. LSR forwards the packet swapping the incoming label
for outgoing label. The egress LER pops the label from the incoming packet
and forwards as regular packet. [34]

Ll\)'('1' 3 Routing
The label does not have a specific format since MPLS is intended to
work over any layer 2 protocol. Label encoding is based on mutual agreement
between two neighboring MPLS-enabled routers and has meaning only on the
particular link between them. The label can use an existing layer 2 header
field or be inserted between the layer 2 and IP headers as a small shim label.
A shim label might consist of a 20-bit label value, 3-bit class of service, I-bit
bottom of stack indication, and 8-bit time to live field.
MPLS allows hierarchical labels supported as a last in first out label
stack. A packet is always processed based on the top label regardless of other
labels that may be below it. The labels in the stack are called label I, label 2
and so on till label n from the bottom to the top of the stack. After the top
label is processed, a router may pop and/or push the label stack.
1.5.6 Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
Generalized MPLS, also known as multiprotocol lambda switching,
supports not only devices that perform packet switching, but also those that
perform switching in the time, wavelength, and space domains [35]. Work has
been done on extending MPLS as a control plane that can be used not only
with routers, but also with equipment like SONET, ADMs, and newer devices
like oxes, which offer the necessary standardized common control plane
which is essential in the evolution of open and interoperable optical networks.
A common control plane simplifies operations and management and provides
a wide range of deployment scenarios ranging from overlay to peer. Some
modifications and additions are required to the MPLS routing and signaling
protocols to adapt the photonic switches. These are:
â€¢
A new Link Management Protocol designed to address issues related
to link management in optical networks using photonic switches.
â€¢
Enhancements

signaling protocols for traffic engineering purposes that allow a label-
switched path (LS) to be explicitly specified across the optical core.
â€¢
Scalability enhancements such as hierarchical LSP formation, link
bundling, and unnumbered links.
GMPLS provides necessary bridge between the IP and photonic
layers to allow for interoperable and scalable parallel growth in the IP and
photonics providing high data rate backbones. The functionality provided by
GMPLS, its associated generalized notion of an LSP hierarchy, and bundling
creates sufficient flexibility supporting future high-bandwidth applications.
1.5.7 Generic Framing Procedure (GFP)
Generic Framing Procedure (GFP) is a recently standardized traffic
adaptation protocol
for broadband transport applications. It provides an
efficient and QoS-friendly mechanism to map either a physical layer or
logical link layer signal to a byte-synchronous channel. It also supports basic
client control functions for client management purposes. [36]
Figure 1.20 illustrates a simplified taxonomy of the transport options
for end-user applications such as voice , data, storage, and video traffic over
the public network infrastructure. Frame relay, ATM, and packet over
Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous Data Hierarchy (SONET/SDH)
Packet over SONET (POS) represent the dominant service layer technologies
for
data
delivery
to
Small
Office/Home
Office
(SOHO)
and
large
corporations. High Data Link Control (HDLe) is the traffic adaptation
mechanism in native frame relay and POS services. When handled at the
physical layer, Ethernet and Storage Area Networks (SAN) protocols such as
Fiber
Channel,
Enterprise
Systems
Connection
(ESCON),
and
Fiber
Connectivity (FICON) have traditionally been transported over the public
network infrastructure by means of proprietary solutions that either optically
extend the reach of the native signal or mimic an electrical repeater function .
There
is
a
need
for
a
common
QoS-friendly
standard-based
mechanism to transport IP, Ethernet, and SAN traffic over both TDM and
WDM
networks.
Although
ATM
and
HDLC
are
the
most
common
mechanisms employed to adapt native data traffic to the public transport
network infrastructure, both have their own limitations as the base for such a
simple common adaptation solution.

infrastructure [36J
GFP provides a flexible encapsulation framework that supports either
a fixed or variable length frame structure. GFP protocol data unit (PDU) size
can be fixed to a constant value or changed from frame to frame to allow easy
extraction of the encapsulated PDUs. GFP segregates error control between
the GFP adaptation process and the user data. Functionally, GFP consists of
both common and client-specific aspects. Common aspects apply to all GFP
adapted traffic and cover functions
such as PDU delineation, data link
synchronization
and
scrambling, client
PDU
multiplexing,
and
client-
independent performance monitoring. Client-specific aspects cover issues
such as mapping of the client PDU into the GFP payload, client-specific
performance monitoring, and operations, administration, and maintenance.
Future broadband global multimedia satellite network designs employ
these broadband backbone technologies such as GMPLS. The generic framing
procedure will be essential to global network consisting of different protocols
and transmission media. Satellite, as a backbone technology candidate, is
described in chapters 4, 7, and 10.

1.601 DSL
Digita l Subscriber Line (DSL) is a technology that uses regular
telephone lines to transmit a high volume of data at a very high speed. The
telephone uses only part of the frequency available on these copper lines;
DSL gets more from them by splitting the
line and
using the higher
frequencies for data, and the lower for voice and fax [37, 38, 39].

Overview of Broadband Satellite Networks
47
OSL offers high-speed broadband connectivity over existing copper
telephony infrastructure. Upgrading copper, LEC's can offer telephony and
data services simultaneously. Figure
1.22 shows a network architecture
example using AOSL.

Figure 1.22: ADSL network architecture (using a splitter)
The user's distance from the CO is the determining factor of the
speed of the OSL. As the distance grows the strength of the signal weakens,
hence greater distance means less bandwidth to the customer.
Key Benefits of DSL
â€¢
Compared to a 56K modem, OSL speeds range from twice as fast up
to 125x as fast.
â€¢
OSL is typically billed at a flat rate, so you can use it as much as you
want without incurring more charges.
â€¢
DSL makes the Internet available 24 x 7.
â€¢
Phone company networks are among the most reliable, with only
minutes ofdowntime each year.

48
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
â€¢
Because the connection is made over individual phone lines, each
user has a point-to-point connection to the Internet.
Types ofDSL
Table
1.8 shows the characteristics of DSL technology. DSL is
sometimes referred to as xDSL, because there are several different variations.
Asymmetric DSL (ADSL): Delivers high-speed data and voice service over the
same line. The distance from the CO determines speeds; as the distance
increases,
the
speed
available
decreases.
G.Lite is a variation on ADSL; DSL that the end user can install and
configure. It is not yet fully plug and play, and has lower speeds than full-rate
ADSL.
Symmetric DSL (SDSL): Downstream speed is the same as upstream. SDSL
does not support voice connections on the same line. The distance from the
CO determines speeds; as the distance
increases,
the speed
available
decreases.
ISDN DSL (lDSL): A hybrid of ISDN and DSL; it's an always on alternative
to dial up ISDN but it does not support voice connections on the same line.
High-bit-rate DSL (HDSL): HDSL is already widely used for Tl lines. It
requires 4 wires instead ofthe standard single pair.
Very high-bit-rate DSL (VDSL): Still in an experimental phase, this is the
fastest DSL, but deliverable over short distance from the CO.
Voice Over DSL (VoDSL): An emerging technology that allows multiple
phone lines to be transmitted over one phone wire, while still supporting data
transmission.
VoDSL can be used for small businesses that can balance a
need for several phone extensions against their Internet connectivity needs.
1.6.2 Cable
Cable
systems
were
originally
designed
to
deliver
broadcast
television signals efficiently to subscriber's homes.
The coaxial cable
systems typically operate with 330 MHz or 450 MHz of capacity, whereas
hybrid fiber/coax (HFC) systems are expanded to 750 MHz or more.
Logically, downstream video programming signals begin around 50
MHz, the equivalent of channel 2 for over-the-air television signals. The 5-42
MHz
portion
of
the
spectrum
is
usually
reserved
for
upstream
communications from subscriber's homes.
Each standard television channel
occupies 6 MHz of RF spectrum. Thus a traditional cable system with 400
MHz of downstream bandwidth can carry the equivalent of 60 analog TV
channels and a modern HFC system with 700 MHz of downstream bandwidth
has the capacity for around I10 channels.

To support data services over a cable network, a television channel in
the 50-750 MHz range is typically allocated for downstream traffic to homes
and other channels. The 5-42 MHz band is used to carry upstream signals.
A
headend
Cable
Modem
Termination
System
(CMTS)
communicates
through
these
channels with cable
modems
located
in
subscriber homes to create a virtual local area network (LAN) connection.
Most cable modems are external devices that connect to a personal computer

50
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
through a standard IOBase-T Ethernet card or Universal Serial Bus (USB)
connection, although internal PCI modem cards are also available. The cable
modem access network operates at Layer I (physical) and Layer 2 (media
access control/logical link control) of the OSI Reference Model. Thus, Layer
3 (network) protocols, such as IP traffic, can be seamlessly delivered over the
cable modem platform to end-users.
A single downstream 6 MHz television channel may support up to 27
MHz of downstream data throughput from the cable headend using 64 QAM
(quadrature amplitude modulation) transmission technology.
Speeds can be
boosted to 36 Mbps using 256 QAM .
Upstream channels may deliver 500
Kbps to 10 Mbps from homes using 16 QAM or QPSK (quadrature phase
shift key) modulation techniques, depending on the amount of spectrum
allocated for service. This upstream and downstream bandwidth is shared by
the active data subscribers connected to a given cable network segment,
typically 500 to 2,000 homes on a modern HFC network.
An individual cable modem subscriber may experience access speeds
from 500 Kbps to 1.5 Mbps or more - depending on the network architecture
and traffic load - blazing performance compared to dial-up alternatives.
However, when surfing the Web, performance can be affected by Internet
backbone congestion.
1.6.3 Hybrid Fiber Coax (HFC)
Hybrid-Fiber Coax is an emerging cable architecture for providing
residential video, voice telephony, data, and other interactive services through
subscribers' homes over hybrid-fiber coaxial cables. It is proposed by cable
TV (CATV) industries. HFC attempts to minimize initial investment by using
existing CATV coax and combining high-bandwidth, low-loss fiber optics
with low-cost coaxial cables to provide more channels with better picture
quality to the customer. A full HFC system could deliver: [40]
â€¢
Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS)
â€¢
Up to 37 analog TV channels
â€¢
Up to 188 digital TV channels
â€¢
Up to 464 digital point channels (customer-requested services)
â€¢
High-speed two-way digital data link for PCs
The HFC link is terminated by a fiber-node, which converts optical
signals to electrical signals over conventional coaxial cable network for use in
the subscribers' homes. A typical HFC Network is shown in figure I.23 where
the Network Headend connects stations using a tree-and-branch topology
transmission network . The Network Headend serves as a central location for

Overview of Broadband Satellite Networks
51
services offered over the HFC Network. Analog and Digital services like
PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network), ATM Network, and Cable TV
Programming are possible for the HFC Network. The Headend Network also
serves as the interface of the access network to external wide area networks,
like the telephone network and the Internet. The Headend Network also
includes transmission equipment such as frequency modulators and combiners
for analog distribution. For digital information distribution, high-speed ATM
switches are installed in the headend. The SONET ring then connects the
switches in the headend to distribution centers and then to the rest of the
access network.
Distribution
Center
Distribution
Center
Headenc
Figure 1.23: Hybridjiber coax network
Distribution centers are responsible for routing information from the
headend to subscribers' homes. Because distribution centers are connected to
the network
headend through fiber-optic links, multiple services (voice
telephony, digital video, and data services) are transported to subscribers'
homes by employing different modulation schemes and FDM techniques.
Each media stream received by a distribution center is assigned to a specific
frequency
band
on
the
HFC
network.
Since
distribution
centers
are
responsible for multiplexing and modulation of media streams, it also controls
the spectrum allocation. Spectrum allocation is the allocation for frequency
bands for different services for the neighborhood that it serves. Since the HFC

52
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
Downstream
frequencies
network is a point-to-multipoint transmission network, data transmitted over
this network may need to be encrypted. Encryption functions are controlled
and managed by the distribution centers.
Signals from a distribution center are transported over a fiber trunk to
fiber nodes serving clusters of 500 to 2000 homes. The primary function of
the fiber nodes is to convert optical signals receive over the fiber trunk into
electrical signals in order to transmit the signals over coaxial cable. Coaxial
cables carry signals over short distances from the fiber nodes to subscribers'
homes. Typically, amplifiers are located at appropriate places on the coax
trunks and are used to prevent attenuation of signals during delivery of
services to subscribers' homes. At the subscribers' homes, a variety of devices
may be used to access information transmitted over the HFC network.
Figure 1.24 shows a typical spectrum allocation of HFC. The service
provider determines the actual spectrum allocation . The downstream (server
to customer) frequency of 50 MHz to 550 MHz is allocated for analog TV
broadcast, 550 MHz to 750 MHz for digital interactive services and telephone
services, while the upstream (customer to server) frequency of 5 MHz to 45
MHz is allocated for return messages and upstream telephone and data
services.

Figure 1.24: A typical spectrum allocation/or a multi-service cable network
The cable TV network is designed for the broadcast of cable
programs to the customers. To support two-way asymmetric communications
for interactive digital services, there are two alternatives for the upstream
transmissions: phone
return and cable
return. With
phone return,
the
downstream transmission is by way of the regular cable plant, with the
upstream interactive control signals via twisted pair phone lines. With cable
return, the interactive signals are transmitted via the same cable used in the
downstream transmission, usually at 5-45 MHz. Since multiple users share the
spectrum, a multiple
access
protocol
is required. In addition, reverse
amplifiers are required for the upstream
communications. A limitation
imposed by the HFC system is that a station cannot directly listen to the

Overview of Broadband Satellite Networks
53
upstream transmissions from other stations. Therefore, they are unable to
detect collisions and coordinate their transmissions by themselves.
1.6.4 Wireless
New wireless technologies such as Local Multipoint Distribution
Service (LMDS), Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service (MMDS) and
38 GHz -
platforms provision very high data rates to end-users. Many
wireless networks utilize hybrids of wireless, satellite, fiber and copper to
create a complete end-to-end platform.
The traditional version of fixed wireless solution for point-to-point
uses microwave at 1.7-40 GHz.
The 38-GHz Carrier Service includes 14
pairs of 50-MHz wide channels available for last mile connections. Spectrum
is primarily licensed to Winstar and Advanced Radio Telecommunications.
The technology is mainly used to extend fiber networks .
Local Multipoint Distribution Service (LMDS) is a fixed broadband
line-of-sight, point-to-multipoint, microwave system. It is located in sections
of the 27.5 to 31.3 GHz band. LMDS can deliver at a very high capacity,
depending on the associated technologies. Cells are no larger than two miles
in radius but require many cells to cover a large area.
LMDS can serve
roughly 80,000 customers from a single node. The downstream data rates top
out at 38 Mbps . The LMDS equipment being complex, CPE cost is high.
Therefore LMDS operators target enterprises and network operators .
Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service (MMDS) allows two-
way voice, data and video streaming. MMDS frequency is located in the 2.1
to 2.7 GHz band. MMDS has lesser frequency than LMDS and therefore has a
greater range and requires a less powerful signal than LMDS. MMDS is a less
complicated, cheaper system to implement. As a consequence, the CPE is
cheaper, thus it is suitable for residential and small business markets. It is also
less vulnerable to rain fade - the interference caused by adverse weather
conditions that can undermine the quality of the microwave signal.
LMDS and MMDS share a number of common architectural features
although they vary from one manufacturer to another according to features
and
capabilities. The
core
components
are
a
base-station
transceiver
(transmitter and receiver), a customer-premise transceiver and some kind of
CPE network interface unit (NIU) or card.
For downstream traffic to the customers' premises, the base station
converts the digital bit stream containing voice, data and video information
into microwaves that are transmitted to a small antenna on the customer's

54
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
premises. The microwaves are then reconverted back into a digital bitstream
by the NIU and delivered to the end-user. The process is reversed for
upstream traffic. When the base station receives the microwave signal and has
converted it into a digital bit stream, this is routed through, or 'backhauled' to,
the wider network, through which the data or call is delivered to its
destination.
Unlike the lower frequency cellular systems, LMDS and MMDS both
require
a line-of-sight between the base station and customer premise
transceivers.
This
is
a
prerequisite
for
any
system
operating
above
approximately 2-3.5GHz. The base station is connected to the wide-area
network switch or Internet POP via either a high-capacity wireline (usually
fibre optic) or wireless. Similarly, at the customer's premises, the signal can
be delivered to the end-user terminals via either ofthese.
Wireless systems are being deployed to fulfill a number of functions .
On a network
level they are suitable
for
both access
and backbone
infrastructure. The principal benefits of LMDS/MMDS are:
â€¢
Network deployment is much faster with wireless systems enabling
rapid, early market entry.
â€¢
Entry, deployment and upgrading costs are much lower than for
wireline alternatives, for which engineering (cabling and trenching)
costs are significantly higher.
â€¢
The maintenance, management and operation expenditure is lower.
Wireless systems can be rolled out much faster, enabling an earlier
return on investment.
â€¢
Scalable architectures enable expanded coverage and services in
direct relation to the level of demand.
â€¢
Only one network architecture is required to provide a full suite of
interactive voice, video and data services that can be expanded as and
when desired.
1.6.4.1 Broadband Wireless
Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) can extend access to LANs
such as corporate intranets, as well as support broadband access to the
Internet, particularly at hot spot public venues where people tend to gather.
They can provide easy wireless connectivity to computers, machinery, or
systems in a local environment where a fixed communications infrastructure
does not exist or where access is not permitted. These hosts can be stationary,
handheld, or even mounted on a moving vehicle. [41]

Overview of Broadband Satellite Networks

As shown in table 1.9, there are a number of IEEE 802.11 standards.
802.11a and 802.11b provide overlays to wired networks, and networks where
wired or wireless access is not currently deployed. 802.11b enables mobility
within office environments and enables outdoor bridging over very long
distances (25 miles).
802.11a network can be used for high-bandwidth
applications. 802.11g serves as an upgrade to 802.11 b networks or as an
alternative to the 802.11a frequency band. Its performance is similar to
802.11 a. The spatial capacity of 802.11 b is 1 Kbps per square meter while
that of 802.11a has a capacity of 83 Kbps per square meter.

There are two possible architectures for WLAN deployment. In the
first alternative, a pure WLAN-to-Internet architecture uses multiple access
points backboned by fiber or wireless links to the Internet, without going
through cellular or Personal Communications Service (PCS) providers. If
location management is required, location accuracy is equal to one access
point coverage. In the other alternative, WLANs can support handoffs to other
wireless networks, and all networks connect to the Internet. For example,
mobile commerce (m-commerce) applications with certain QoS or real-time
requirements can switch to cellular, PCS, or third-generation networks. Local
management accuracy is higher due to Enhanced 911 and other precise
schemes deployed in other wireless networks that can be used in this
environment.
Several hot spot public venues have been identified throughout the
world . Hot Spot Operators have installed wireless fiber (Wi-Fi) access points
at hotels.
airports, restaurants, bookstores, schools, theatres, convention
centers, health clubs, and other public venues . TeleSea Wireless Services

56
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
offers a broadband link to seaborne travelers within 30 miles of select U.S.
costal access points. T-Mobile offers 802.11b-based access for more than half
of the hot spots in the U.S. A HSO, Cometa Networks, with iPass is planning
to set up 20,000 hot spots within the next two years. Many cities currently
offer or plan to offer public broadband services to promote business and
tourism . For example, Long Beach, California offers free Wi-Fi access in its
Downtown
Wireless Internet District. A number of retail vendors offer
WLAN access to increase sales and promote their products and services. For
example, Starbucks provides T-Mobile HotSpot service to its customers at
more than 1,000 of its U.S. coffee shops and so does Borders book store.
McDonalds began a trial program in New York City that offers an hour of
free "Intel-verified" WLAN access for a 60-mintue session for a nominal fee.
[41 ]
The technical challenges for WLANs are 802.II-related lack of
security, multicast, location management support which many emerging
applications require.
â€¢
Security: A security solution Wi-Fi Protected Access provided by Wi-
Fi Alliance is on the way. Another security solution uses Virtual
Private Networks (VPNs) with an IP security protocol tunnel.
â€¢
Multicast: Wireless multicast is the most efficient way to update
membership information for network traffic routing users join, leave
or move to different locations. However, ensuring reliability, privacy,
QoS, and low delay in WLANs are major technical challenges.
â€¢
Location Management support: Wireless
carriers could
get the
position of subscribers within range of a given access point and
support
location-based
billing,
information
services,
emergency
services, and tracking services.
For widespread deployment of WLANs, easier access, better QoS,
more network management tools and flexible pricing should be offered. The
bit rate per user must be increased to support higher-end applications such as
wireless streaming media and videoconferencing, in WLANs. To address this
problem, the IEEE 802 High Throughput Task Group (802.11n) is exploring
ways to increase bit rates to 108 Mbps and possibly by 2005 to 320 Mbps
[41 ].
1.6.5 Satellite
Satellite communication has several advantages. Everyone within the
satellite coverage area can be connected, regardless of proximity to terrestrial
hubs, gateways and repeaters [42].

Overview of Broadband Satellite Networks
57
Figure 1.25 shows an example of broadband satellite network using
the Digital Video Broadcasting via Satellite (DVB-S) protocol standard for
the forward channel and the Digital Video Broadcast - Return Channel via
Satellite (DVB-RCS) standard for the return channel [43, 44, 45J. The
forward channel refers to the link from the gateway that is received by the
user terminal and the return channel is the link from the user terminal to the
gateway.

The
interactive satellite Internet access network also presents a
network asymmetry environment. The DVB-S forward link is about 38-45
Mbps and return link using terrestrial dialup or cellular or satellite is with
around 10:I asymmetry. To accommodate such network path asymmetry,
several mitigation techniques have been proposed [46, 47J.
The DVB network elements consist of an Enterprise Model, Service
Level Agreements (SLA), and TCP Protocol Enhancement Proxy (PEP), the
Hub station
and
the
Satellite
Interactive
Terminal
(SIT).
The
target
applications of the DVB network could be Small and Medium Enterprises and
residential
users.
One of the major
advantages of DVB-ReS
is that
multicasting is possible at a low cost using the existing Internet standards. The
multicast data is tunneled over the Internet via a multicast streaming feeder

58
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
link from a streaming source to a centralized multicast streaming server and is
then broadcasted over the satellite medium to the intended target destination
group. The DVB-RCS system supports relativel y large streaming bandwidths
compared to existing terrestrial solutions (from 64 kbps to I Mbps).
In the DVB network, a satellite forward and return links typically use
frequency bands in Ku (12-18 GHz) and/or Ka (18-30 GHz). The return links
use spot beams and the forward link global beams are used for broadcasting
and Ku-band . Depending on the frequency bands (Tx/Rx), three popular
versions are available: (a)Ku/Ku (14/12 GHz) (b)Ka/Ku (30/12 GHz) and (c)
KalKa
(30/20
GHz).
In
business-to-business
applications,
the
SIT
is
connected to several user PCs via a LAN and a Point-of Presence (POP)
Router. The Hub station implements the forward link via a conventional
DVB-S chain (similar to Digital TV broadcasting) whereby the IP packet is
encapsulated into DVB-streams, IP over DVB. The return link is implemented
using the DVB-RCS standard "MF-TDMA Burst Demodulator bank", IP over
ATM like. The HUB station is connected to the routers of several ISP's via a
Broadband Access Server. The HUB maps the traffic of all SITs belonging to
each ISP in an efficient way over the satellite. The selection of a suitable
residential access technology depends on the type of application, site location,
required speed, and affordable cost.
1.7 STRUCTURE OF THE BOOK
This book addresses some of the technical challenges for broadband
satellite networks to support future broadband applications over Internet. Both
IP and ATM transport technologies are addressed along with some future
architectural issues using MPLS/GMPLS. Specifically, extensive simulation
examples for TCP/UDP traffic for satellite IP with differentiated services are
included.
Moreover, technical
issue
analysis, buffer
models
for ATM
networks, analytical Demand Assignment Multiple Access (DAMA) model
for bandwidth allocation are studied. This book also describes in detail
IntServ, DiffServ, and MPLS based QoS architectures for satellite based IP
networks. A new Spread ALOHA based protocol is defined and analyzed for
return channel ofthe broadband satellite Internet access network.
1.7.1 Part One: Principles of Satellite Networks
Satellite communication systems have been supporting services such
as TV broadcasting, digital messaging, enterprise Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs) and point-to-point telecommunications and data services. The recent

throughput requirements and communication demands. Service providers,
network and Internet access providers are faced with a challenge to meet the
higher capacity access to the end user and wider service offerings. Satellite
communication network systems can be optimized to meet such new service
demands.

needs a deeper understanding and development of
modified protocols of the existing terrestrial networks.
In particular, no

Quality of Service framework in Chapter 5.
Chapter 2 provides an overview of the orbits coverage, frequency
bands, network topologies, and satellite services. A satellite network systems
engineering methodology is introduced in Chapter 3 addressing a selection of
a baseline network architecture based on design options e.g., modulation

TCP/IP protocols and QoS mapping the application requirements. The outputs
of this methodology identify the operational concept, system specifications,
performance specifications and various system interfaces.
Chapter 4 describes planned global broadband satellite end-to-end
connectivity networks, IP based satellite access networks, existing mobile
satellite networks, and very small aperture terminal
(VSAT) networks.

RCS) access satellite networks e.g., StarBand, WildBlue, iPStar, and current
mobile satellite networks e.g., ICO, Globalstar, Iridium, Inmarsat are briefly
described and compared.

deploying satellite IP, ATM, and future MPLS networks. The emphasis is on
link layer and above as the physical
layer issues have been addressed
extensively in the literature. Excellent sources on satellite communications
include [48, 49, 50, 51] The first three chapters ofthis part deal with technical
challenges at various layers - physical layer, link layer media access in
Chapter 6, satellite IP at network layer, satellite TCP at transport layer with
performance enhancing proxies in Chapter 7, and satellite ATM with traffic
management and congestion control and end-to-end security in Chapter 8.
Chapter 9 provides a current status of standards and regulatory issues for
satellite networks.
Chapter 6 highlights the physical
layer aspects of higher order
modulation
and
adaptive
coding
and
power
control
to
mitigate
the
propagation effects in a satellite network design. At the link layer, media
access control protocols including dedicated, random, demand assignment
multiple access, and
bandwidth
allocation for OVB are described and
evaluated.
Chapter 7 describes the significant issues and challenges for satellite
IP networks addressing packet forwarding for JPv4 and IPv6, QoS routing,
and IntServ, DiffServ, and MPLS. Issues such as satellite IP multicast,
satellite IP security, and voice over JP, which must be fully addressed for an
operational network design, are described. At the transport layer, research
considering many
enhancements for TCP
taking
into account satellite
characteristics e.g., latency, link errors, bandwidth asymmetry, is discussed
and various options are evaluated. A discussion about Performance Enhancing
Proxies
(PEP)
mechanisms,
implications
of
using
PEPs
and
some
performance examples to enhance the throughput using PEPs are described. A

also described.
1.7.3 Part Three: Satellite IP Networks Performance
After describing an overview of the principles of satellite networks
and technical challenges for satellite network design in parts One and Two, a
detailed description of satellite IP networks achieving Quality of Service
guarantees and performance is illustrated. The purpose of this part is to
provide satellite IP networks QoS performance models illustrating the design
aspects to be addressed for realization of a satellite network.
In Chapter 10, background of Quality of Service in IP networks
describing IntServ, DiffServ, MPLS, and ITU QoS objectives mapped into

presents MPLS traffic engineering approach for satellite GEO, MEO and LEO
configurations.
Chapter 13 describes a two-way interactive satellite Internet access
network using MF-TDMA based return channel via satellite (DVB-RCS)
protocol. Use of Data over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS)
for a satellite network is also illustrated. A CDMA based Spread ALOHA
return channel protocol for satellite Internet access including Spread ALOHA
One Long Code and Spread ALOHA One Code multiple access is described
and Monte Carlo simulation performance results are given.
1.7.4 Part Four: Satellite ATM Networks Performance

operating over satellite
links. Several

Variations from ITU-R standards. Satellite ATM buffer model for TCP
transport for UBR service is described and simulation results are presented.

2.2 BASIC CHARACTERISTICS
The principal attributes of satellites include (a) broadcasting and (b)
long-haul communications. For example, Ka-band spot beams generally cover

different footprint sizes. The sizes range form coverage of the whole earth as 
viewed from space (about 1/3 of the surface) down to a spot beam that covers 

66
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
much of Europe or North America. All these coverage options are usually
available on the same satellite. Selection between coverage is made on
transparent satellites by the signal frequencies. It is spot beam coverage that is
most relevant for access since they operate to terminal equipment of least size
and cost. Future systems will have very narrow spot beams of a few hundred
miles across that have a width ofa fraction of a degree.
Bandwidth flexibility: Satellite bandwidth can be configured easily to
provide capacity to customers in virtually any combination or configuration
required. This includes simplex and duplex circuits from narrowband to
wideband and symmetric and asymmetric configurations. Future satellite
networks with narrow spot beams can deliver rates of up to 100 Mbps with 90
em antenna and the backplane speed within the satellite switch could be
typically in the gigabit per second range. The uplink rate from a 90 em user
terminal is typically 384 Kbps.
Connectivity: Satellite
networks
provide
point-to-multipoint
and
multipoint-to-multipoint communications facilitated
by the Internet and
broadcasting capability.
Disaster recovery: Satellites provides an alternative to damaged fiber-
optic
networks
for
disaster
recovery
options
and
provide
emergency
communications.
Deployment: Satellites can initiate service to an entire continent
immediately after deployment, with short installation times for customer
premise equipment. Once the network is in place, more users can be added
easily and rapidly.
Reliability and security: Satellites are among the most reliable of all
communication technologies, with the exception of SONET fault tolerant
designs. Satellite links only require the end stations to be maintained and they
are less prone to disabling though accidental or malicious damage.
Cost: The cost is independent of distance: The wide area coverage
from a satellite means that it costs the same to receive the signal from
anywhere within the coverage area.

depending on the direction and speed of the satellite when placed in orbit. For
each height of satellite orbiting around the earth, the rotation is given by:
T = 165.87 x 10.6 X a3/2
where T is orbital period (in minutes)
a is semi-major axis of ellipsis (in km)
If the orbit is circular, a is the distance from the center of the earth to
the satellite.
The higher the satellite is positioned, the larger its orbital period
around the earth. There is a height such that the satellite's orbital period
around the earth is equal to the rotation period of the earth. For an observer
situated on the earth's surface , the satellite may seem to be motionless or
stationary in space. Hence this is known as a geostationary orbit (GSO).
According to the orbital
period , satellites may be class ified as
geostationary (GSO) and non-geostationary (NGSO). Geostationary satellites
illuminate the same area of the earth's surface, which enable antennas located
on the earth's surface used in communicating with them to point toward a
specific direction, thereby reducing the overall cost of antenna systems and
allowing them to be adjusted manually.

Figure 2.I:Satellite orbital period in terms a/semi-major axis
In the case ofNGSO satellites, since they move at velocities different
from that of the earth, the illumination area moves along with them, so that
the associated antenna systems change their direction continuously, thereby
increasing the costs of these systems due to the need for automatic tracking
systems for azimuth and elevation adjustments. On the other hand, since GSO

located

NGSO
satellites, the
propagation attenuation is greater, so that GSO satellite systems require larger

68
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
antennas and transmitters and, therefore, are more expensive than those
antennas and transmitters used by NGSO satellite systems.
A satellite
communication network
system consists of a space
segment and a ground segment. The space segment consists of satellite(s)
GSO and/or NGSO satellites. The NGSO satellites are further divided into
Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) if their orbit is above 2000 km and Low Earth
Orbit (LEO) if their orbit is below 2000 km altitude . Generally altitudes
between 2000 and 5000 km are avoided because of the presence of the
VanAllen radiation belt, which is capable ofdamaging satellites.
NGSO satellites appear to be in constant motion to an observer (or
ground station) on the surface. Communications via an NGSO satellite
requires the earth station to anticipate, when and in what direction the satellite
will rise above the horizon, which is different for every pass. Once acquired,
the NGSO satellite must be continually tracked as it moves through the sky
until
it again
disappears below the horizon
(or behind a chimney,
a
neighboring building, or a tree). Most of the first generation satellite systems
used GEO whereas next generation satellite networks include MEO, LEO,
GEO or some combinations ofthese configurations.
2.3.1 Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO)
The altitude of GEO satellites is 35,786 km (22,300 miles) above the
surface of the earth. The orbit period is 24 hours, which gives the advantage
of continuous visibility and fixed geometry. This has made GEO satellites one
of the principal means of distribution of television , telephone and data
communications
throughout
the
world.
Most
of
the
commercial
telecommunications satellites currently in operation are in GEO orbit. A
satellite can see about one third of the earths surface and is visible from 70Â°
North to 70Â° South latitude. Therefore, 3 or 4 satellites can provide global
coverage, with the exception of the extreme latitudes above 70 N or below 70
S, which minimizes launch costs and the number of feeder link or gateway
stations. In addition, gateway and semi-fixed mobile earth stations have
simplified tracking, because a satellite in geostationary orbit (24 h orbital
period, plus in the equatorial plane) will appear at a stationary point in the
sky, as viewed from the earth. Figure 2.2 shows a GEO satellite constellation.

2.3.2 Medium Earth Orbit (MEO)
The altitude of MEO satellites has to be selected between the inner
and outer Van Allen Radiation belts, typically around 10,355 km above the
surface of the earth. The orbit period will be 6 hours. The world can be
covered by 10-12 satellites in 2-3 planes e.g., 5 satellites in each of the 2
planes or 4 satellites in each ofthe 3 planes. The typical propagation delay for
a MEO satellite is 110-130 ms. An example of a mobile satellite system at
MEO would be K'O, orbiting at an altitude of 10,388 km, with a 6 hours
orbital period. This MEO is designed to operate with only 12 satellites for full
global coverage . An example of a MEO satellite constellation is shown in
figure 2.3.

BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
2.3.3 Low Earth Orbit (LEO)
The altitude of LEO satellites is typically between 700 and 2000 km.
The orbit period will be somewhere between 100 to 120 minutes. Providing
continuous communications coverage to a given point on Earth using LEO
satellites requires the use of 6-8 planes with 6 satellites per plane. To avoid
interruptions at the end of each pass, data buffering must be employed at the
ground station or the next visible satellite must be acquired and tracked before
communications are handed over from the setting satellite. The lower altitude
enables LEO satellites to provide services to a rather small area at any given
time. The round trip propagation delay is about 20-25 ms. LEO satellites
operating in high inclination orbits can provide service to the near-polar
regions . Motorola's Iridium [52J and Globalstar [53J belong to this category
of Mobile Satellite Systems (MSS). Iridium, a LEO/MSS that has an orbital
altitude of 780 km and 110 minutes of orbital period, uses 66 LEO satellites
and Globalstar, another LEO/MSS that has an orbital altitude of 1400 km
comprises of 48 LEO satellites. Both these systems were designed to provide
Telephony
services.
Globalstar

used
for

communications as well. Figures 2.4 and 2.5 show examples of LEO satellite
constellations. Satellite systems for personal communications using LEOs
have been well addressed in [54, 55J.

weight

satellite
as
compared
to
GEOs,
but
require
global
constellations. For example, Teledesic, previously had a constellation of 288
LEO satellites. Recently, Teledesic initiated a new system design with 30
MEO satellites. Hughes Spaceway System uses 8 GEO satellites. Latency is a
key difference, making LEO/MEO satellites more attractive for interactive
applications like voice and video. However, demonstrations show that GEO
satellite systems are capable of high-speed Internet access. MEO systems are
proposed in a few systems to strike a balance between the complexity of a
MEO system constellation and low latency requirements in data services.

2.4.2 Ka-band - Next Generation
Several of the U.S. companies have filed proposals with the FCC to
provide
FSS at
Ka-band
(30/20
GHz).
NASA
has
launched
the
first
experimental satellite called Advanced Communication Technology Satellite
(ACTS) at this frequency band. Also, Italsat from Italy operates in the same
band. The details of Ka-band systems are further described in Chapter 4.
2.5 NETWORK TOPOLOGIES
Satellite
networks
can
be grouped
into
one
of four
network
topologies:
Point-to-Point,
Point-to-Multipoint,
Multipoint-to-Point,
and
Multipoint-to-Multipoint. Each network is characterized by the utilization of
different technologies to enable the specific topology to operate in the most
cost efficient manner. Many satellite networks employ a combination of

74
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
topologies in order to handle specific types of applications and traffic
demands.
2.5.1 Point-to-Point Networks
Point-to-point
networks
involve
the
establishment of a
single
communication
link (in either simplex or duplex
mode)
between
two
locations. The data range for point-to-point circuits varies extensively from 64
Kbps narrowband circuits up to 155 Mbps high data rate Multiple Channel per
Carrier (MCPC) circuits.
2.5.2 Point-to-Multipoint Networks
Point-to-Multipoint networks involve a single broadcast uplink and an
unlimited number of receive sites. In each instance, all receivers in such a
network are tuned to the same broadcast frequency, while routing/switching
algorithms determine whether a specific receiver is able to listen to the
broadcast. Data rates generally range from 1.5 Mbps to 45 Mbps. These
networks are used to provide broadcast, multicast and more commonly unicast
services (usually for Internet access services).
2.5.3 Multipoint-to-Point Networks
Multipoint-to-Point satellite networks are used for collecting or
aggregating information at a central location from a large number of remote
locations. Receiving incoming data from a large number of remote locations
requires careful coordination of network bandwidth, which is accomplished
through the use of Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Time
Division Multiple Access (TDMA), and Code Division Multiple Access
(CDMA). Multipoint-to-point networks are used in applications such as Point-
of-Sale terminals, remote sensoring, and specialty corporate WANs.
2.5.4 Multipoint-to-Multipoint Networks
Multipoint-to-multipoint networks are designed
to operate in a
"mesh" configuration where every location has the ability to communicate
directly with every other location on a single hop basis, which is necessary to
minimize latency between sender and receiver.

(FSS),
Mobile
Satellite
Services (MSS),
and
Broadcast Satellite Services (BSS) . These are described in the following
paragraphs. ITU-R has been involved in standardization activities of satellite
systems for these services.

These
questions
can
be
answered
by
system
engineering
methodology, which is the main focus of this section. Systems engineering is
a systematic discipline to designing, analyzing, and engineering a system to
meet agreed upon objectives and target user requirements. It is a vehicle using
analytical and simulations modeling as well as "what if' scenario analysis, to
arrive at a final realizable system candidate.
Figure
3.1
shows
a
brief broadband
satellite
network
system
engineering methodology to arrive at a baseline architecture satisfying the
requirements. The process is iterative and begins with application and traffic
requirements along with a business plan either for global or regional service.
The capacity plans and traffic analysis results provide the inputs to network
architecture options.
The network architecture consists of a space segment, a ground
segment including terminals and gateways, and a control segment. Selection
ofthe baseline architecture depends on several factors:
â€¢
Selection of orbits : Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO), Medium Earth
Orbit (MEO), Low Earth Orbit (LEO)
â€¢
Frequency of operation: Ku, Ka

Figure 3.1: Satellite network system engineering methodology
As shown in figure 3.1, the QoS requirements provide inputs to the
preferred network design. The system analysis and simulation tools will be
used to conduct trade analyses such as, throughput, delay performance,
bandwidth allocation efficiency, system utilization, delay variation, and buffer
models for various traffic models. Based on these studies and implementation
complexity, the baseline architecture will be established. The various systems
and system elements will be integrated and a testbed will be developed. The
output products of this system engineering methodology will be to (a) define
operational concept, (b) system specification, (c) performance specification,
(d) test and verification plans, and (e) risk assessment and management plans.

BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
Parts II and III provide some simulation results addressing the trade
studies for satellite IP and satellite ATM networks using standard protocols.
3.2.1 Business Model
To launch a broadband satellite network service, it is essential to
develop a business model based on several factors including: residential,
small office/home office (SOHO), enterprise, Internet service providers (ISP),
content providers, corporate virtual
private
networks,
and domestic
or
international service. The business model should also include the finance plan
to support system design, development, and deployment. Another important
issue is developing domestic or global partnership and alliances to establish a
global communication infrastructure utilizing international gateways and local
telecommunication switching centers. The success of a broadband network
service depends on a good business plan.
A realistic business model has to be developed for achieving service
revenue growth . For example, first generation systems at Ku-band with global
beams cover a large geographical area e.g., United States or North America,
using a single beam. The new Ka-band systems use more focused beams that
cover a much smaller area. A given frequency range can be reused many
times over a wide geographical area. In this way, there is a large increase in
overall capacity because of the frequency reuse. The Ka spot beams provide
30 to 60 times the system capacity of earlier systems. The increase in system
capacity to 30 Gbps plays a very significant role in helping provide a long-
term profitable business opportunity for such systems. Maturity of the
technology for both backbone and access types must also be taken into
consideration.
Broadband satellite
service depends
on the following
key factors: (a)
capabil ity of supporting a large number of subscribers with consistent and
strong performance e.g., millions of subscribers, (b) guaranteed QoS with
throughput, minimum delay, and availability, (c) application support for
multimedia,
content-rich, and streaming,
and (d)
support
of principal
functions such as service activation/reactivation, customer care, and billing.
These factors are also influenced by system design and implementation.
3.2.2 Service Requirements
The new generation of applications needs higher bandwidth. In
addition, performance requirements are changing the way satellite systems are
designed, implemented, and operated. The next generation satellite systems

Satellite System Engineering Methodology
81
that are optimized for services such as broadband Internet access and content
delivery go far beyond the traditional broadcasting services.
Direct peer-to-peer connections needed for enterprise networking
applications require mesh connectivity, and not hub-spoke. Small dish, high-
speed mesh connectivity is currently achievable using onboard satellite
processing and switching techniques in conjunction with Ka-band spot beams.
These systems are called "connectivity satellite networks" (see Section 4.1.1) .
The service requirements include:
â€¢
Topology (hub/spoke, mesh)
â€¢
Connectivity (symmetric/asymmetric)
â€¢
Quality of Service (best effort, IntServ, DiffServ, MPLS/TE)
â€¢
High data rate
â€¢
Multimedia traffic
â€¢
Frequency of operation (Ku, Ka and beyond)
Residential
users
have
different
service
requirements
than
do
corporations and Small to Medium Enterprises (SME). Diversified service
speeds, throughput and connectivity requirements exist. These are much more
demanding in an enterprise environment. The mobile broadband users add yet
another dimension - service capability, and performance expectations. Thus a
single system cannot satisfy the requirements of the residential, enterprise,
and mobile markets.
3.2.3 Satellite Internet Applications
Satellites support point-to-point and trunking services. Recent trends
in the broadband satellite market can be classified into three major service
categories: a) broadband access, b) Content Distribution and Delivery, and c)
corporate multimedia services. Table 3.1 shows an example of such services
and their applications.
The demand for broadband satellite access forms one of the major
markets for both enterprise and residential
users. Popular data transfer
applications include FTP and e-mail. These applications carry variable packet
sizes and can transfer large files efficiently. Applications such as web
browsing and distance learning generate occasional bursts of data. Real-time
applications like, instant messaging and chat rooms generate frequent bursts
of traffic and they are delay tolerant applications. However, e-commerce, and
stock exchange are delay intolerant traffic resulting in frequent bursts. The
next generation Ka-band systems are being designed to support some of these
bandwidth-rich multimedia applications.

3.2.4 Applications Profiles
83
File Transfer: FTP applications can be characterized as independent
file transfer sessions between a client and a server. Multiple sessions can be
transferred in each session. The FTP application parameters include get to put
ratio, command rate burst size, which follows Pareto distribution, and file
size, which follows lognormal distribution. [56]
Web Browsing: The web browsing application can be characterized as
independent browsing sessions. In each session, several pages are browsed
consecutively. The duration of a session is controlled by the time required to
finish browsing all these pages. When browsing a page, the client sends a
request to a server, the server sends back the page with multiple in-line
objects. The web browsing application parameters include number of pages
per session , main object size (lognormal distribution), page size (Gamma
distribution), view time (Weibull distribution), and maximum number of
connections. Common web protocols are HTTP and HTTPS (Secure HTTP).
Electronic
Mail:
Email
applications
can
be
characterized
as
independent sessions between a client and a server. An email session involves
an email being sent from the client to the server, and a confirmation sent from
the server to the client. The email application parameters are, sent rate,
receive rate (Poisson distribution), and message size (lognormal distribution).
Video Conferencing: Video conferencing can be characterized as
independent sessions with each session involving multiple parties. The video
conferencing application parameters include video conferencing rate (Poisson
distribution), videoconference duration (exponential distribution), frame rate,
scene length, video compression standard and average bit rate.
Voice: Voice applications can be characterized as independent calls
with variable duration. During a conversation between two parties, talk spurts
are followed by silences. Voice application parameters are, call rate (Poisson
distribution), call duration, average talk length and average silence length
(exponential distribution), bit rate, and accepted cell success probability.
3.2.5 Requirements

3.2.6.1 Space Segment
As an example, three satellite payload architectures are considered.
(1) Non-regenerative with global beam
(2) Non-regenerative with spot beams
(3) Onboard processing with spot beams
Candidate 1: Non-regenerative with global beam
The current satellite systems operating in C- and Ku-band use this
architecture. Bent Pipe systems simply receive and retransmit signals from the
same beam's coverage area. Due to the wide coverage, all the user terminals,
gateways and Network Control Station (NCS) are within the coverage of a
single beam and can communicate via satellite. The drawback of this
architecture is that it cannot take advantage of frequency reuse.

86
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
Candidate 2: Non-regenerative with spot beams
The spot beam bent pipe architecture uses frequency reuse at Ka-
band. Each user terminal, gateway and the NCS communicate through one of
the satellite's spot beams. Ground elements , which do not reside in the same
beam, cannot communicate via the satellite because the payload does not
support the switching necessary for interbeam connectivity. This results in
significant ground infrastructure to interconnect the terminals and gateways to
the NCS for connection control. In addition, a gateway is required for every
spot beam provided by the satellite to provide terminals access to terrestrial
networks. For networks providing interbeam terminal-to-terminal services all
the gateways must be interconnected via terrestrial
networks since the
gateways are the only access points that terminals have to terminals in other
beams. Another alternative is to operate the network using a hub-spoke
topology, where terminals are interconnected through a gateway, and the
gateways share routing information . The hub-spoke operation, however,
incurs a 50% penalty in raw capacity because all interbeam transactions
require two satellite hops.
Candidate 3: Onboardprocessing with spot beams
An
on-board
processing
and
switching
architecture
provides
interbeam connectivity allowing user terminals to access other user terminals,
gateways and the NCS in other beams. The capacity of the resulting network
is larger than the bent pipe architecture. As a result frequency reuse is
possible without a terrestrial infrastructure. This applies to both circuit and
fast packet switching depending on the target user location. If users are
geographically distributed, the analog circuit switch requires
a ground
network to get the data from the user to a centralized uplink terminal for
efficient bandwidth use. The onboard fast-packet switch architecture does not
require a centralized uplink for efficient downlink bandwidth usage because
the payload interprets the data and discards empty slots and empty packets;
increased
uplink efficiency is obtained
by a DAMA protocol for data
transfers.
The network attributes and applications dictate the optimal payload
architecture. Payload architectures must meet the evolutionary needs of
existing networks and provide new service opportunities to those not currently
using
satellite
assets. Traffic
throughput
capacity,
network
flexibility,
performance, network complexity, user applications, and economics are major
determinates in the design of satellite payloads. Traditional non-regenerative
(bent pipe) payloads used in most of today's networks perform frequency
translation and power amplification functions. Processing payloads perform
additional functions
that enhance
network flexibility,
performance, and
applications. Processing payloads augment the ground infrastructure of new
or existing terrestrial networks with full mesh interconnectivity as soon as the

Satellite System Engineering Methodology
87
satellite becomes operational. For full interbeam connectivity in a bent pipe
network, deployment of a more expensive ground infrastructure is required, or
the network can be operated using a hub-spoke topology for a loss of 50% of
raw capacity. Existing and new ground networks using processing payloads
can make extensive use of inexpensive, small, low power terminals enabled
by onboard demodulation and error control coding.
Switching
The advantage of IF circuit switching over bent pipe architecture
comes from the frequency reuse gains, and its ability to route bandwidth to
other smaller geographical regions . The bent pipe architecture is ideal for
covering large geographical areas, such as a continent, with the same
information from a centralized command uplink, as in continental TV
broadcast. The IF circuit switch also offers the ability to provide regional
broadcasting service not practical with typical bent pipe architectures. Both
architectures require a single centralized uplink per subchannel or transponder
for access to the satellite. These architectures are ideally suited for traditional
broadcast television services but do not efficiently transport multimedia
applications from a large number of geographically distributed users. Some
network architectures attempt to get around the limitation by using additional
ground networks to get the data from the user facility to the centralized uplink
terminal. The addition of an external network increases cost and delay and the
ability to guarantee QoS is compromised. Because the uplink and downlink
bands are very large, these analog IF switching architectures require a
centralized ground aggregation point for more efficient operation . Neither
bent pipe nor circuit switch are able to capitalize on statistical variations in the
traffic rate to enable new connections to use idle downlink bandwidth.
The ATM cell switch takes advantage of the statistical bandwidth
requirement fluctuations of variable rate sources. Regenerative payload digital
signal processing enables use of much smaller quanta of bandwidth for
matching uplink capacity with user application requirements. An additional
advantage of ATM cell switch is that the payload allowing the downlink to be
utilized by other users removes empty uplink TOM slots and multicast traffic
compensates for the wasted uplink bandwidth. Moreover, the ATM cell
switch architecture enables the user to directly access the satellite, thereby
minimizing response time and enabling the satellite network to guarantee end-
to-end QoS to the users.
The future Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) switching provides the
necessary bridge between the IP and photonic layers to allow for interoperable
and scalable parallel growth in the IP and photonics providing high data rate
backbones. The functionality provided by GMPLS, its associated generalized

88
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
notion of an LSP hierarchy, and bundling creates sufficient flexibility
supporting future high-bandwidth applications.
Orbits
Based on the system requirements, business model and the coverage,
GEO, MEa, or LEO constellations can be selected
depending on the
applications to be serviced and the coverage areas.
One of the great unknowns about LEO constellations is, how well
they handle delay variations or variable latency or jitter. A LEO satellite may
only spend tens of seconds over a geographical area, which means that a
given transmission may be picked up and passed on by multiple satellites. A
single transmission thus can be subjected to delay variations and results in
subsequent packet reordering. This delay variation means, TCP window
duration must be changed. Applications such as voice, video and IP multicast
are affected by jitter and packet reordering which results in these applications
favoring GEOs. On the other hand, if the TCP implementation is very robust
and jitter and reordering are not real issues, then LEOs will definitely yield
lower end-to-end latencies.
For LEOs, if large buffers are designed, the effect ofjitter might be
reduced. However, the delays might be increased. Thus, buffering will
certainly benefit voice and video conferencing but it will not help short email
and web Internet traffic. Another effect ofjitter is, if variable latency extends
the round trip timing, TCP may interpret jitter as packet loss and begin a
retransmission, which slows down the traffic data transfer. Hence, one of the
options could be to use a combination of GEO and LEO satellites. Motorola's
Celestri is an example of such a hybrid constellation. Celestri was not pursued
due to other business reasons.
Many of the proposed Ka-band systems propose to have global
coverage. The number of satellites proposed for these systems varies from
three GEOs to even 840 LEO satellites as in Teledesic's original design which
was subsequently changed to 248. Teledesic was later redesigned to have 32
MEa satellites. Astrolink was designed to have nine satellites in five orbital
locations. As few as three satellites were intended to provide initial global
service and interconnectivity and the remaining six to meet future traffic
demands.
Astrolink's network architecture is based on ATM, as there was a
need for fast switching technology capable of supporting, in an integrated
manner, data, voice, video, and multimedia [57]. Later on, it was redesigned
to support IP network users.

Satellite System Engineering Methodology

The Astrolink system uses I GHz of uplink and I GHz of downlink
spectrum at each orbit location. The upper 500 MHz of spectrum on both
uplink and downlink, which is allocated on a primary basis to GSa FSS
services, is dedicated to the subscriberterminal links. Capacity is dynamically
assigned by the Network Control Center based on diurnal and long-term
traffic demands. The links employ forward error-correction concatenated
coding to increase the link margins and improve the BER performance and
system availability with small user terminals. The user terminal downlink
employs a single TDM carrier providing an aggregate data capacity totaling
approximately 100 Mbps for all users in a beam. The user terminal uplink
employs a hybrid Frequency Division/Time Division Multiple Access
(FDMA/TDMA) access scheme. Users transmit to the satellite employing
individually assigned channel frequencies and signal frame time slots. User
terminals employ one of three basic quadrature phase shift keyed (QPSK)
symbol burst rates, 368, 2208, or 8832 Ksymbols/sec, to provide equivalent
maximum data rates of384, 2304, and 9216 Kbps.
Each satellite is equipped with up to 80 active subscriber uplink
beams and up to 52 active subscriber downlink beams. Each satellite is also
equipped with 8 active gateway uplink and downlink beams each of which
may be hopped among three gateway locations. Thus, links to up to 24
gateway Earth stations can be provided per satellite. Satellites have
intersatellite links operating in the 64-71 GHz frequency band. The baseline
spacecraft antenna on Astrolink is a multibeam antenna composed of eight
reflectors, four transmit and four receive.
An onboard digital signal processor, with a throughput capacity
exceeding 5 Gbps, provides the functions of FDM channel recovery,
demodulation, decoding, routing, buffer storage, re-assembly, encoding and
remodulation of signal packets between the uplink and downlink user beams,
uplink and downlink gateway beams and each of the two on-board bi-
directional intersatellite links. Individual signal packets are extracted from
each uplink and are routed, at the ATM cell level, to the appropriate user
downlink,gateway downlinkor inter-satellite linkto providethe user required
connectivity, while preserving the negotiated ATM QoS level for the
connection. Baseband signal cell processing permits the NCC to directly
control access to the system; to assign capacityto users basedon the available
network capacity, requested data rate, and ATM QoS; and to collect billing
information for each connection based on the call parameters and actual
numberof ATM cells delivered.
EuroSkyWay employs onboard ATM-like fast packet, switching and
processing payload operating at Ka-band [58]. To improve transmission link
margins for direct interconnection among low power/low dimension user

90
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
terminals, the implementation of onboard processing allows routing individual
data bursts transmitted by each user terminal to their destination providing full
mesh connectivity. This also employs onboard traffic resource management
allowing dynamic resource allocation. The high-gain spot beam antennas
provide multispot coverage of service areas reducing the transmission power
requirements for smallest aperture terminals. It allows frequency reuse within
the service area.
These concepts require considerable tradeoff studies in terms of
overall
system
throughput
achieving
onboard
traffic
and
resource
management control functions versus power and weight requirements, which
in tum relates to the overall system cost.
3.2.6.2 Ground Segment
The ground segment consists of various types of user terminals
depending on the system
design
with
respect
to antenna size, power
requirements, and service areas.
Astrolink and EuroSkyWay provide different types of user terminals
and gateways. The data rates, sizes, number of gateway beams, number of
gateways, and the transport protocols supported
by these systems form
significant design issues. These examples are further elaborated in Chapter 4.
User terminals
The Astrolink design consists of three basic types of terminals, sized
to provide optimum performance and price for a given class of service and
availability. The Class A, or basic terminal, provides user data rates up to 384
Kbps and employs a 90 cm diameter antenna and a 2-Watt power amplifier.
The Class B, or enterprise terminal, provides user data rates up to 2.304
Mbps, thus encompassing the popular T 1 and E1 data rates. This terminal also
employs a 90 cm diameter antenna but uses an 8-Watt power amplifier.
Finally, the Class C, or major enterprise terminal, provides user data rates up
to 9.216 Mbps and employs a 1.8 m diameter antenna and 12-Watt power
amplifier. These terminals have been sized to provide better than 99.5%
system availability to over two-thirds ofthe potential market areas.
EuroSkyWay supports three different types of terminals, Sat-A with
uplink data rate of 160 Kbps, 0.7 m dish antenna, and EIRP of 38-45 dBW .
Sat-B terminals provide uplink data rate of 512 Kbps, 0.7-0.9 m antenna with
EIRP of 43-50 dBW. Sat-C terminals support 2.048 Mbps uplink rate, with

Satellite System Engineering Methodology
91
1.2 m dish antenna and EIRP of 51-58 dBW. All three terminals are designed
to provide 32.768 Mbps downlink data rate.
Gateway Earth Stations
The connectivity between Astrolink users and terrestrial infrastructure is
provided by gateways, which will be located at significant earth points in the
terrestrial optical fiber networks. Gateways support data rates up to 155 Mbps
(OC-3). They employ antenna sizes ranging from 3.5 to 4.5 m.
EuroSkyWay provides service provider terminals (PrTs) connected to
the service provider centers. EuroSkyWay gateways interface with the public
terrestrial network (PTN) through protocol adaptation interfaces ISDN, ATM,
and PSTN. The EuroSkyWay gateways operate at 32.768 Mbps uplink data
rate with 2.7 m dish antennas and EIRP of 70.5 dBW. Provider terminal PrT-
A provides an uplink rate of6.144 Mbps with at 1.7 m dish and EIRP of63.2
dBW. Provider terminal PrT-B operates with 32.768 Mbps, 2.7 m dish and
EIRP of 70.5 dBW. All the three provider terminals operate at downlink of
32.768 Mbps.
3.2.6.3 Control Segment
The network control and management segment consists of the main
network control center and the regional control centers. The major functions
of the control and management center include: resource management, traffic
management,
resource
planning,
configuration
management,
fault
management,
performance
management,
database
distributions,
security
management, accounting and billing, and user support.
The Astrolink system employs five regional Network Control Centers
(NCC), one associated with each satellite orbital location. The regional NCC
controls all the traffic within a given satellite and assigns network resources
as required by the user community. The NCC validates users, provides call
setup and teardown functions, collects billing information and provides billing
and related system utilization information to local service providers who
distribute the service to end-users. A Master NCC, co-located with one of the
regional, NCCs performs overall network resource management, collects
usage statistics, and operates as clearing house between the regional NCCs.
Two Satellite
Operations Centers (SOCs),
primary and backup,
perform satellite housekeeping functions such as attitude control, thermal, and
power management; planning and execution of station keeping maneuvers;
monitoring and evaluation of spacecraft health; and contingency planning and

92

equipment failure. The sacs communicate with the satellites by means of
appropriately located Telemetry Tracking and Control (IT&C) Earth Stations.
These two examples provide an idea of different technical issues to be
addressed during an architectural candidate selection process.
3.2.6.4 Interfaces
Based
on the system
design, the
system
internal and external
interfaces must be defined and analyzed. Some system interface examples
include: payload to spacecraft, payload to terminal, payload to master control
station, payload to regional control center, payload-to-payload (in case of
multisatellite networks). The external interfaces include: PSTN, ATM, IP and
MPLS based public and private networks as required. The tradeoff studies in
these are adaptation of the open standard protocols versus some proprietary
designs to achieve full standards-compliance and large system throughput. In
using open industry standard technologies might result in larger number of
users, which in turn provides for financial gain ofthe system.
3.2.6.5 Tradeoff Studies
As shown in figure 3.1, once the different architectures based on the
business model, application requirements, and system-level requirements, are
identified; they are to be analyzed with the input of QoS requirements -
bandwidth, error performance and loss rates, delay bounds, delay variations
and system availability. The performance objectives provided by the standard
organizations ITU-T, ITU-R and/or ETSI/BMS, and IETF provide initial
guidelines to specify inputs to the performance analysis process. Modeling
and simulation tools at the physical, link, network, and transport layers would
be used to refine these performance values of the system. Also, modeling and
simulation can be used to answer various performance versus implementation
complexity/cost tradeoff studies and "what if' questions. The following could
be a set of system tradeoff studies.

3.2.6.6 Baseline System Architecture
As outlined in the previous section, after the frequency and orbits are
selected, various factors are identified and trade studies are completed; a
baseline system architecture can be selected.
3.2.6.7 Business and Operations Support Systems (BSS/OSS)
Traditionally, the satellite system
designers ignore the business
support system
and operation support system aspects.
These are very
important to make a broadband satellite network a successful venture along
with its peers such as DSL, cable, and wireless broadband access . The various
functionalities are shown in table 3.3.
3.2.7 Performance Evaluation
The baseline system will be exercised to study the end-to-end
performance in terms of throughput, delay, system availability, and error
performance. Fine-tuning the system parameters through an iterative process
would be performed as a part of systems engineering methodology using
modeling and simulation tools (e.g., OPNET, STK). The final output of this
exercise would be a system architecture with well-defined internal and
external interfaces. The detailed simulation examples of Part Three and Part
Four elaborate these issues further.

4.1 INTRODUCTION 
Satellite communication networks have evolved from broadcast 
systems, beam switched transponder systems, to IP packet forwarding, 
on board processing and switching systems. The broadcast architecture of 
most commercial satellites yields bandwidths of 1 to 2 GHz or less. The new 
applications demand an effective bandwidth increase by an order of 
magnitude within the next few years. The mass of satellites has been growing 
at the rate of 8% per year and communication payloads have been getting 
more efficient capacity compounded over 35 years, to well over two thousand

achieving maximum frequency reuse. Satellite systems can become the 
imbedded infrastructure in regions with less developed communication 
infrastructure and complement the Internet service over other technologies 
such as cable, DSL, fiber, and wireless. It is expected that the market for 
Content Delivery Distribution via satellite network will grow up to $4 billion 
by 2006 [59J. 
The satellite based Internet has several architectural options due to 
their design alternatives. In a broad sense these options are classified into two 
major categories: connectivity and access networks. This chapter provides an 
overview of (a) user-to-user connectivity broadband satellite systems, (b) 
satellite access network systems, (c) mobile satellite systems for personal 
communications, and (d) Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSA T) networks. 
The major characteristics and design architectures of these four types 
of satellite networks are discussed. A summary table comparing various 
systems belonging to each class of satellite network is provided. To illustrate 
the design objectives, we provide an existing or a planned system example.

BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
This chapter provides the basis for Part Two, which describes the technical
challenges to be addressed for system realizations.
4.1.1 Connectivity Network
In
connectivity
satellite
networks,
user-to-user
connectivity
is
established
via
satellite
onboard
switching and
routing.
This
type
of
broadband service can be used to provide Internet access avoiding some
degree of ground infrastructure: Bandwidth utilization efficiency can be
gained through the use of onboard processing and ATM fast packet switching
or even optical switching in the distant future. As a consequence, the
complexity and demand for satellite resources can be much higher than that
needed for an access satellite. Figure 4.1 shows a connectivity network.
Examples of broadband satellite connectivity networks such as Spaceway,
Astrolink, EuroSkyWay, Teledesic are discussed in Section 4.4.
Figure 4./: Connectivity network
4.1.2 Access Network
Access networks evolved with the new application of broadband
interactive connectivity to the Internet. The network requires a forward link
from the network gateway to the user and the return Iink from the user to the
network gateway. These two links are highly asymmetric and the links may
have
totally
different
characteristics.
The
bandwidth
allocation
must
accommodate two links per user. Frequency Reuse is employed and different
frequency bands can be used for the user and gateway links. An access
network is shown in figure 4.2. Examples of satellite access networks include
StarBand, WildBlue, iPStar, Astra-BBl, Cyberstar as discussed in Section 4.5.

The tradeoff issue for selecting a connectivity or access system is
bandwidth utilization efficiency vs. complexity. Most of the connectivity
networks are also planned to provide high-speed Internet access as well as
multimedia applications.
4.2 NEXT GENERATION KA-BAND
Many current satellite systems use C- and Ku-band frequencies as
well as bent pipe payload architectures. C band requires large antenna and
individual Federal Communications Commision (FCC) frequency coordinates
and licensing. Ku-band systems require small dish antenna and are more
attractive but these bands are generally congested. As a result, Ka-band,
employing spot beam technology, became an attractive solution for future
broadband satellite networks [60]. As shown in table 4.1, most of the global
broadband satellite networks are designed to operate at Ka-band . Intelsat
systems use C and Ku while Eutelsat systems use Ka and Ku.
Until recently, Ka-band was used for experimental satellite programs
in the
U.S., Japan,
Italy,
and
Germany.
In the
U.S, the
Advanced
Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) is being used to demonstrate
advanced technologies such as onboard processing and scanning spot beams.
A
number
of
applications
were
tested
including:
distance
learning,
telemedicine, credit card financial transactions, high data rate computer
interconnections, video conferencing and HDTV. The growing congestion of
the C and Ku bands and the success of the ACTS program increased the
interest of satellite system developers in the Ka-band satellite communications
network to increase support for multimedia applications. A rapid convergence

98
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
of technical , regulatory, and business factors has increased the interest of
system developers in Ka-band frequencies . [61]
Several factors influence the development of multimedia satellite
networks at Ka-band frequencies: [62]
â€¢
Adaptive Power Control and Adaptive Coding: Adaptive power
control and adaptive coding technologies have been developed for
improved
performance, mitigating propagation error impacts on
system performance at Ka-band.
â€¢
High Data Rata: A large bandwidth allocation to geosynchronous
fixed satellite services (GSO FSS) and non-geosynchronous fixed
satellite services (NGSO FSS) makes high data rate services feasible
over Ka-band systems.
â€¢
Advanced
Technology:
Development
of
low
noise
transistors
operating in the 20 GHz band and high power transistors operating in
the 30 GHz band have influenced the development of low cost earth
terminals. Space qualified higher efficiency Traveling-Wave Tubes
Amplifiers (TWTAs) and Application Specific Integrated Circuits
(ASICs) development have improved the processing power. Improved
satellite bus designs with efficient solar arrays and higher efficiency
electric propulsion methods resulted in cost effective launch vehicles.
â€¢
Global Connectivity: Advanced network protocols and interfaces are
being
developed
for
seamless
connectivity
with
terrestrial
infrastructure.
â€¢
Efficient Routing: Onboard
processing and fast packet
or cell
switching (e.g., ATM, IP) makes multimedia services possible.
â€¢
Resource Allocation: Demand Assignment Multiple Access (DAMA)
algorithms along with traffic management schemes provide capacity
allocation on a demand basis.
â€¢
Small Terminals: Multimedia systems will use small and high gain
antenna on the ground and on the satellites to overcome path loss and
gain fades.
â€¢
Broadband Applications: Ka-band systems, combining traditional
satellite strengths of geographic reach and high bandwidth, provide
the operators a large subscriber base with scale of economics to
develop consumer products.
A next
generation
broadband
satellite
network
for multimedia
applications is discussed in the following section.

Network Systems and Examples
4.3 BROADBAND SATELLITE NETWORK
99
Streaming audio/video, broadcast
Internet access
and
multicast
applications dictate future broadband satellite network designs. The design
parameters include traffic throughput, system delay, flexibility, performance,
OoS, and complexity. Traditional bent pipe payloads perform frequency
translation
and
power
amplification,
but
require
complex
ground
infrastructure supporting routing functions in a hub and spoke topology. In
advanced architectures with processing payloads and spot beam antenna
technology, complete mesh topologies in addition to, hub and spoke can be
supported. If these technologies happen to be economical, newer architectures
can
use
inexpensive,
small,
low
power
terminals
with
onboard
demodulation/remodulation,
encoding,
and
routing
functions
[63]. The
broadband
user OoS
levels can be well supported by onboard traffic
management and traffic monitoring, which is currently supported in the
terrestrial infrastructure. The main focus of the rest of the book is to address
the satellite network design issues supporting the user level performance, and
improved resource allocation. In particular, the QoS technologies developed
for terrestrial networks have been applied to satellite. Parts III and IV provide
several satellite IP and satellite ATM simulation results to give an insight of
the system behavior.
Figure
4.3 illustrates a broadband satellite network
architecture
represented by a ground segment, a space segment, and a network control
segment. The ground segment consists of terminals and gateways (OWs),
which may be further, connected to other legacy public and/or private
networks. The space segments consists of one (OEO) or more (OEO, MEa,
LEO) satellites. The Network Control
Station
(NCS)
performs
various
management
and
resource
allocation
functions
for
satellite
media.
Intersatellite
links
in
the
space
segment
providing
seamless
global
connectivity via the satellite constellation is optional. A hybrid network
architecture allows the transmission of packets over satellite, multiplex and
demultiplex datagram
streams for uplinks, downlinks, and interfaces to
interconnect terrestrial networks. The architectural options could vary from
ATM switching, IP transport or MPLS over satellite. Connectivity to external
public and private terrestrial and satellite networks will be provided under the
scheme of Global Information Infrastructure.
The possible architectural options as discussed in Section 3.2 are: (a)
Candidate I: Wide Area Bent Pipe Architecture, (b) Candidate 2: Spot Beam
Bent Pipe (non-regenerative) Architecture, and (c) Candidate 3: On-Board
Processing and Switching. The wide area bent pipe architecture cannot take
advantage of frequency reuse while the architectures with spot beams can do
so. Candidate 2 with bent pipe spot beams are currently used in regional

100
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
satellite systems discussed
in Section 4.5. The next generation Ka-band
satellite networks employ Candidate 3 with onboard processing and switching
to provide end-to-end connectivity. Section 4.4 gives some Ka-band system
examples.

routing individual data bursts to their destinations.

even layer 2 switching.
â€¢

4.3.3 Onboard Processing
Many of the next generation broadband satellite systems use on-board
processing and fast packet/cell switching. Onboard
processing involves
demodulation and demultiplexing the received signal. The payload performs
decoding and encoding, processing the header information, and routing the
data, pointing the antennas, buffering, multiplexing, and retransmitting the
data on downlink or inter-satellite link. The major reasons for onboard
processing include separation of the uplink from the downlink, a gain of
approximately 3 dB in performance, and provision of resources on demand

102
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
using uplink Demand Assignment Multiple Access (DAMA). The advantages
of onboard processing over bent pipe architecture include:
â€¢
Improved error rates by using effective encoding techniques
â€¢
Separation of uplink and downlink
â€¢
System efficiency improvements
â€¢
Better delay performance
â€¢
Routing decisions onboard or via intersatelIite links
â€¢
No end-to-end retransmissions
â€¢
Capacity improvements
The first generation services that are now in place use existing Ku-
band Fixed SatelIite Service (FSS) for two-way connections. Using FSS, a
large geographical area is covered by a single broadcast beam. The new Ka-
band systems use spot beams that cover a much smalIer area e.g., hundreds of
miles across. Adjacent celIs can use different frequency range but a given
frequency range can be reused many times over a wide geographical area. The
frequency reuse in the spot beam technology increases the capacity. In
general, Ka spot beams can provide 30-60 times the system capacity of the
first generation networks.
In a non-regenerative architecture, the satellite receives the uplink and
retransmits it on the downlink without on-board demodulation or processing.
In a processing architecture with cell-switching or layer-3 package, the
satelIite receives the uplink, demodulates, decodes, switches and buffers the
data to the appropriate beam after encoding and remodulating the data, on the
downlink. In a processing architecture, switching and buffering are performed
on the satelIite and in a non-processing architecture, switching/routing and
buffering are performed within a gateway. The selection of the satellite
network architecture is strictly dependent on the target customer applications
and performance/cost tradeoffs.
As discussed in Section 3.2.6.5 the system engineering methodology
wilI be used to conduct tradeoff study for the selection of onboard processing.
4.3.4 On-board Switching
On-board processing satell ites with high-gain multiple spot-beams
and on-board switching capabilities have been considered as key elements of
next-generation satellite communications systems [64]. On-board processsing
satellites support smalI, cost effective terminals and provide the required
flexibility and increased utilization of resources in a bursty multimedia traffic
environment.

Network Systems and Examples
103
Although employing an on-board switch function results in more complexity
on-board the satellite, the following are the advantages of on-board switches.
â€¢
Lowering the ground station costs.
â€¢
Providing bandwidth on demand with half the delay.
â€¢
Improving interconnectivity.
â€¢
Offering
added
flexibility
and
improvement
in
ground
link
performance, i.e., this allows terminals in any uplink beam to
communicate with terminals in any downlink beam while transmitting
and receiving only a single carrier.
â€¢
In-band signalling for combined traffic and Tracking Telemetry and
Commanding (TT & C) operation
One of the most critical design issues for on-board processing satellites is the
selection of an on-board baseband switching architecture. Four types of on-
board switches are proposed:
â€¢
Circuit switch
â€¢
ATM Switch
â€¢
Hybrid Switch
â€¢
Fast Packet Switch
Figure 4.5 shows an example of fast packet switch and the input
output processing functions.

Figure 4.5: Functional architecture of thefast packet switch
The key requirements ofsuch a fast packet switch include:
â€¢
Handling multiple services e.g., JP, ATM, MPEG
â€¢
Supporting QoS with different application levels

104
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
â€¢
Supporting multicast applications
â€¢
Implementing efficient research allocation and DAMA algorithms
â€¢
Implementing packet routing, label switching and cell switching
â€¢
Handling asymmetry and
â€¢
Providing throughputs up to several gigabits per second
In the future, satellite backbones may even employ Generalized
MPLS (GMPLS) switching interconnecting satellite and terrestrial network
segments and users.
4.3.5 InterSatellite Links (ISLs)
The use of ISL for traffic routing is considered as an option in the
selection
of
network
architecture
(see
Section
3.2.5).
ISLs
provide
autonomous
space
segment benefits
at the cost of processing system
complexity. In addition, on-board switching architecture selection must be
made in terms of throughput, delay, and simplicity of system operation. The
other issues for deciding the use of ISLs include:
â€¢
Networking considerations (coverage, delay, handover)
â€¢
The feasibility of the physical link (inter-satellite dynamics)
â€¢
The mass, power & cost restrictions (link budget)
The mass and power consumption of ISL payloads are factors in the
choice of whether to include them in the system, in addition to the possible
benefits and drawbacks. Also the choice between Radio Frequency (RF) and
optical payloads is now possible as optical payloads have become more
realizable and offer higher link capacity. The tracking capability of the
payloads must also be considered, especially if the inter-satellite dynamics are
high. This may be an advantage for RF ISL payloads.
Advantage of ISLs
â€¢
Less ground-based control may be achieved with on-board baseband
switching reducing delay (autonomous operation).
â€¢
Increased global coverage due to oceans and areas without ground
stations.
â€¢
Single network control centre.
Disadvantages of ISLs
â€¢
Complexity and cost ofthe satellites will be increased.
â€¢
Power available for the satellite/user link may be reduced.
â€¢
Handover between satellites due to inter-satellite dynamics will have
to be incorporated.
â€¢
Replenishment strategy.

Network Systemsand Examples
â€¢
Frequency co-ordination.
105
The tradeoff study in terms of system performance and complexity
between ISLs and the use of ISL ground based gateways will be performed to
arrive at a decision of usage of ISLs.
4.3.6 Spot Beam Technology
Traditional satellite technology utilized broad single beams covering
entire continents and regions. Newer Ku- and Ka-band spot beams provide
coverage
over
a
much
smaller region
than
global
beams,
which
is
advantageous in providing more bandwidth. By shaping the antenna on the
spacecraft into a tighter focus, the size of the footprint on the ground is
reduced. Two benefits are created by this modification: the signal strength as
seen from ground terminals increases allowing for smaller ground antennas,
and the same frequency range can be utilized multiple times in different
beams yielding greater total bandwidth. Using frequency reuse through
multiple spot beams, Ku- and Ka-band satellites can be configured in a similar
fashion to terrestrial cellular networks. Particularly with Ka-band, the limiting
factor no longer becomes available spectrum, but the amount of transponder
power available and the weight of the entire payload to be launched. Most
broadband satellites plan to employ tighter spot beams than predecessors.
Specific applications well suited for spot beam technology include local
television broadcasting and high-speed Internet access.
4.4 GLOBAL BROADBAND SATELLITE SYSTEMS
The delivery of multimedia services up to the final user between
office buildings and the nearest access to high-speed networks i.e., ' last-
mile' is a challenging problem. When bandwidth is not available, shared
or cost-prohibitive, launching multimedia services in the residential sector
becomes even more challenging. Wireless broadband technology can fill
the gap in high-speed network access and offers a cost-effective way to
provide high capacity and high-speed data, voice, video and Internet
access if the satellite is included as an essential system component [65,
66].
Table 4.1 compares the new generation Ka/Ku band satellite systems
[67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72]. These systems provide global coverage and high
bandwidth . The proposed Ka-band systems feature user data rates ranging.
from 16 Kbps to as high as 1 Gbps, support for ATM and IP protocols, and
global coverage through a large number of spot beams. All the systems use

106
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
onboard baseband processing/switching for beam interconnecti vity. Except
for Teledesic, which is MEO based, the rest are GEO satellite systems. The
number of satellites vary from 5 GEOs to 32 MEOs. The performance
objective of most of these systems is a link availability of 99.5 to 99.9 per
cent at a Bit Error Rate (BER) of 10-10â€¢ The performance is projected to be
achieved through a combination of high satellite Effective Isotropic Radiated
Power (EIRP), adaptive coding and power control. A typical user terminal
employs anywhere from OJ to 4.5 m antennas supporting data rates of
approximately 16 Kbps to 2 Mbps on uplink and 16 Kbps to 155 Mbps on
downlink.

4.4.1 EuroSkyWay Example
The
EuroSkyWay (ESW) satellite
system has been designed to supply
broadband communications in a cost-effective way for both business and
consumer users with fixed and portable terminals [73] . The network relies on
geostationary satellites to cover Europe, Africa and Middle East with the
possibility of integration with the Global Information Infrastructure (GIl)

platform as well as with other satellite or terrestrial wide area networks.
The system goals are to offer connectivity services to the supported networks,
offering a flexible platform for the provision of capacity on demand , and to
support end user applications with the appropriate grade of service.
System Architecture
Figure 4.6 illustrates the EuroSkyWay network architecture with a
flexible platform for the provision of interactive multimedia services, and
mobility
management.
The
system is
desgined
to
meet
throughput
requirements for broadband services. It provides interfaces with external
public and private terrestrial/satellite networks allowing for interconnection to
the GIL To support any combination of services, protocols and data rates, an
'ATM type' device resource allocation scheme has been chosen. The switch
rate has been selected to be 16 kbit/s to cope with the minimum user need and
a minimum packet size, 53 bytes, and to match the non-isochronous traffic
granularity requirements.

Figure 4,6: EuroSkyWay network architecture
The GEO system architecture adopts the following concepts:
â€¢
Regenerative payloads: Provide improved transmission link margins
for direct interconnection among low power/low dimension user
terminals.

108
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
â€¢
Onboard
processing:
Allows
routing
individual
data
bursts
transmitted by each user terminal to their destination, providing full
mesh connectivity.
â€¢
Ka-band (30/20 GHz): Supports high data rates to a wide range of
services, with different data rates.
â€¢
GEO satellite: Service start-up is achievable with a minimum system
configuration consisting of only one satellite.
â€¢
Modular
configuration:
Based on
clusters ofco-located
GEO
satellites, connected through ISLs.
â€¢
On-board traffic resource management:
Allows
faster
resource
allocation, and dynamic traffic management.
â€¢
Spot beam antenna: Use of a high-gain antenna allows multi-spot
coverage of service areas (the extended Europe for the first satellite)
to reduce the transmission power demand, especially for linking the
smallest aperture terminals, and to allow frequency reuse within the
service area.
Each EuroSkyWay satellite and the terminals connected to it identify with one
ESW Regional System (ESW-RS). Each regional system acts as a subnetwork
to transfer signaling and traffic data transparently at terminal level. To allow
for interconnection with the existing Public Terrestrial Networks (PTNs),
large fixed earth stations (Gateways) have been conceived to distribute the
traffic originated from the PTN towards the large population of users directly
connected to the 'satellite network' and vice-versa. Two other fixed satellite
earth station classes (Service Provider Stations, InterSystem Stations) have
also been identified; the former to access to/from external service providers
aiming at direct diffusion of locally generated data or information ; the latter
for interconnection with different satellite systems covering other parts of the
globe (e.g., USA, Asia, etc.) and providing the same kind of multimedia
services.
The basic ESW-RS architecture includes the following elements:
â€¢
Satellites linked through ISL.

4.5 BROADBAND SATELLITE ACCESS NETWORK
The ETSI/Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB-S) standard (for forward
channel) for digital satellite broadcasting, and a specification for Satellite
Return Channel DVB-RCS have recently been approved [43]. This enables
Internet access completely via satellite, without any terrestrial modems.
Figure 4.7 shows a DVB-S and DVB-RCS based satellite access
network. In the DVB-RCS system, at the broadcast station in the forward link
sub-system, user data from the terrestrial networks are multiplexed with the
digital television channels and broadcast over satellite in MPEG packets. The
end-users's DVB-RCS Terminal (Return Channel Satellite Terminal (RCST))
can receive both the broadcast and data, and filter out the user data that is
addressed to that specific terminal. User requests for information retrieval or
for communication towards the terrestrial network are sent via the satellite to
the DVB-RCS gateway. The DVB-RCS system is based on an asymmetry in
bandwidth for the broadcasting and return channel. In the forward direction
the data rate is typically 40 Mbps in TDM format, assuming a mix of data and
approximately 6 Mbps broadcast channels. The return channel data rate may
vary between 144 Kbps and 2 Mbps. The gateway and terminal architecture is
currently being implemented in DVB-RCS system and IP over satellite [44].
Performance Enhancement Proxies (PEPs) will be used to improve TCP
throughput over satellite for Internet access. The details are discussed in
Chapter 7.

4.5.1 Gateway
A gateway needs
to
be cost-effective and
easily
adaptable to
individual needs
depending upon where
it will be used and for what
functionality. Modules like billing, for instance, mayor may not be part of a
satellite gateway. Some of the gateway functions include:
â€¢
Connection to terrestrial networks
â€¢
Terminal power control
â€¢
Coding and modulation
â€¢
Protocol conversions or spoofing
â€¢
Mobility management and handover
â€¢
Roaming management
â€¢
Accounting and authentication
â€¢
Network management, QoS management
â€¢
Virtual home environment
â€¢
Radio resource management
A generic gateway
handles different air interfaces.
Usually the
modulation will
be Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK), but other
schemes must be prepared for. The gateway uplink is commonly Time
Division Multiplexing (TOM), but with a bandwidth and bit rate varying from
some 30-40 Mbps up to more than 200 Mbps. With onboard processing
satellites the gateway can receive a TOM carrier, but with a transparent

Network Systems and Examples
III
satellite the gateway receiver will usually require a bank of burst Fixed-
TDMA (F-TDMA) receivers. There are also protocols using COMA in the
return link (Chapter 13). Terminal return rates range from a few hundred
Kbps (256-384) to a few Mbps (2-8).
Often the Ka-band is planned for terminal return links allowing more
bandwidth. Due to the possible Ka-band attenuation, some form of space
diversity is commonly required . The support of both antenna and gateway
diversity are beneficial. A gateway diversity scheme, taking advantage of
other gateways in the system, will save expensive RF equipment. For a bent
pipe system, the gateways communicate directly with terminals and many
terminal management functions may be allocated in the gateway.
4.5.2 Terminal
The terminal consists of an outdoor and indoor unit.
Outdoor Unit (ODU): The ODU is the critical part of a terminal and consists
of two main modules, the antenna and the transceiver. The transceiver
consists of one mechanical unit attached directly to the antenna.
Indoor Unit (IDU): The subsystems in the IOU are the Local Network
Interface (LNI), CPU, receiver (demodulator), transmitter (modulator), ODU
Interface and Power Supply & Clock generation. The CPU extracts IP packets
from the MPEG stream received at the satellite interface and transfers those
destined to the local network to the LNI. It receives IP packets from the LNI
and embeds them into ATM or MPEG packages before transferring them to
the modulator. The CPU also handles all signaling with the local network and
the satellite gateway, as well as internal signaling with the other devices in the
IOU and the ODU .
4.5.3 Regional Satellite Access Systems
The
access
systems
provide
regional
coverage
and
are
less
complicated than their global or connectivity counterparts. They are more
cost-effective, have less associated technical risk and have less regulatory
issues. Table 4.2 provides a partial list of access satellite systems for regional
coverage [74, 75, 76, 77, 78].

4.5.4 StarBand Example
Figure 4.8 shows an example of StarBand Internet access system [74].
The StarBand system consists of a 24" x 36" satellite dish, which is 1.2 meters
in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Two standard
coaxial cables connect the satellite dish antenna to a StarBand satellite
modem. The antenna both sends requests to the Internet and receives Internet
content via the GEO satellite. The satellite communicates with the StarBand
hub facility, which has a direct connection to the Internet. In addition to the
two-way satellite Internet service, the StarBand system can also be configured
to receive satellite television service from EchoStar's DISH network. In the
user's home, the StarBand system consists of a satellite modem that attaches
to the home PC through an Ethernet or Universal Serial Bus (USB) port.

4.6 MOBILE SATELLITE NETWORK
Mobile satellite communications for commercial users is evolving
rapidly toward personal communications services (peS) systems capable of
providing basic telephone, fax, and data services anywhere on the globe [79].
4.6.1 Inmarsat
Inmarsat [80] has provided satellite communications services to
mobile users since 1981. It provides data and voice services to maritime, land,
and aeronautical users. Inmarsat has 9 successful satellite launches all of
which are still operational. In 1991, Inmarsat deployed four Inmarsat-2
satellites constructed to its own specifications. In 1996, the first two of five
Inmarsat-3 satellites were launched . A key advantage of the Inmarsat-3s over
their predecessors is their ability to generate a number of spot-beams as well
as single large global beams. The authorized frequency is reused in up to five
spot beams. Spot beams provide higher EIRP in areas of high demand as well
as making it possible to supply standard services to smaller, simpler terminals.
The
terminals
in Inmarsat system
are
Standard-A, Standard-B,
Standard-M, and Standard-C. Standard-A terminal used originally employed
analog (FM) modulation of L-band signals and 50 KHz channels spacing.
About 20,000 such terminals are currently installed on vessels around the

114
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
globe
in
addition
to
about
5,000
products
repackaged
by
terminal
manufacturers for land usage. These are used in remote locations, disaster
situations, or peacekeeping operations but their purchase price and operating
costs are high. Standard-B terminal can replace Standard-A terminal though it
only uses a 20 KHz wide channel. Voice is carried using adaptive predictive
coding at ]6 Kbps and most terminals can operate at 64 Kbps for data.
Standard-M terminals use a voice codec to provide synthesized speech at 4.8
Kbps, which, with error protection, is transmitted at 6.4 Kbps in a 10 KHz
wide channel. Standard-C terminal provides data only at 300 bps and is useful
for functions such as low-rate messaging and position reporting.
Independent
service
providers
offering
voice
and
data
communications use Inmarsat. The combination of 16-QAM and turbo coding
is well suited to Inmarsat's emerging multimedia services. The Inmarsat
mobile ISDN service supports high-speed data services at 64 Kbps, voice
service using 4.8 Kbps advanced multiband excitation coding algorithm,
analogue voice-band "modem services (fax, data, encryption, using pulse code
modulation encoding), and subscriber interface module card compatibility
with Inmarsat-phone readers and cards. Inmarsat is currently serving the
aeronautical, maritime, and land mobile community with nine geostationary
satellites. Services range from traditional voice to high-speed multimedia
applications.
Inmarsat provides
a communication
system
know
as
Regional
Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN), which offers users high-speed
Internet access with coverage in up to 99 countries within the satellite
footprint. This is delivered through a portable satellite IP modem the size of a
notebook PC. BGAN runs at twice the speed of current terrestrial Generic
Packet Radio Services (GPRS) mobile phone networks . It has a benefit of not
needing a fixed line network. The following services are provided by BGAN:
â€¢
Regular, PSTN, ISDN, and IP services

BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
The Iridium design employs 66 satellites placed in circular polar
orbits at 780 km altitude. Users employ small handsets operating in frequency
division multiplexed/time-division multiple access (FDMITDMA) fashion to
access the satellite at L-band. Iridium uses onboard processing to demodulate
each arriving TDMA burst, determine its route and then retransmit it to its
next destination. The use of intersatellite links complicates the system design
but allows global service to be provided with a small number (11) gateway
earth stations. To properly route traffic, each satellite must carry a set of
stored routing tables from which new routing instructions are called every 2.5
minutes. Iridium is now owned by Iridium Satellite Inc. They have a multi-
year US Department of Defense (000) contract to provide services.
Unlike the Iridium system, which
offers a true global
service,
Globalstar's
business
plan
involves
launching the
space
segment and
franchising
its
use to
partners
in different
countries. Over 90
such
relationships have been established. Like the Iridium satellites, Globalstar
spacecraft are three-axis-stabilized, with a mission life of a minimum of 7.5
years . Globalstar does not employ intersatellite links. Hence a subscriber can
gain access to the system only when a satellite in view can also be seen by a
gateway earth station. This means, service areas are typically within 1000
miles of each gateway earth station. In contrast to Iridium, each Globalstar
satellite covers a comparable area of the earth 's surface with only 16 spot
beams. This, together with the sharing of the receive channels on board the
satellite by many more users, reduces the available link margins to about 3-6
dB, although for a small number of users, this can be increased to 11 dB.
Access to and from the satellite is at L- and S-band respectively, utilizing
code division multiple access (COMA) in channels that are 1.25 MHz in
bandwidth. Globalstar has had multiple restructuring approaches considered.
They have bought back gateways and have changed the billing plans.
ICO-Global is a spinoff from Inmarsat, which owns 15% of the
corporation. ICO system has 10 satellites in two inclined circular orbits (5 per
orbit). The inclination of orbits is 45Â° making it is the lowest among the
systems described here. ICO differs from both Iridium and Globalstar in that a
true TDMA scheme has been adopted for the service links, with six
subscribers multiplexed into channels 25.2 KHz in width at a bit rate of 36
Kbps. The first ICO satellite was launched in 2001.

Satellite Control Facility (SCF), a Network Control Center (NCC), gateways
that interconnect with terrestrial telecommunications networks worldwide,
and the ACeS subscriber's handset. The ACeS satellite built by Lockheed
Martin of the
USA, features two
12-meter antennas, on board digital
processing and up to 140 spot beams covering all of Asia. It is also capable of
supporting I 1,000 simultaneous telephone channels and up to two million
subscribers. The satellite reaches the stretch of Papua New Guinea to
Pakistan, around Japan and China, down to Indonesia.
The Satellite Control Facility monitors and controls the satellite while
the Network Control Center consists of the hardware, software and facilities
required in the management and control of the ACeS telecommunication
system resources. The SCF and NCC, located at the ACeS facility in Batam
Island, Indonesia, share a IS-meter parabolic Â·antenna. The ACeS gateways
provide the primary interface between the ACeS system and other terrestrial
communication networks. The dual-mode ACeS handset allows users to
switch from GSM networks when available, or to directly link up to the
satellite when outside cellular coverage.

4.7 VSAT NETWORKS
Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSAT) networks are characterized
by small interactive stations with small antennas (0.6 to 3.8 m in diameter)
operating at Ku- and C-band frequencies [84, 85].
With approximately
500,000 interactive sites operating world wide, VSAT networks have become
an accepted and growing means for meeting corporate communications needs.
Key advantages driving this growth are:
â€¢
VSAT services are easily available
â€¢
Rapid deployment.
â€¢
Sites can be easily added or removed from a VSAT network .
â€¢
Costs are often much lower than terrestrial alternatives for equivalent
data rates and geographical distribution of sites.
â€¢
Connection costs are distance-insensitive.
â€¢
Highest
level of service
availability among
all communication
alternatives (typically > 99.9%).
4.7.1 VSAT Applications
Interactive VSAT networks have penetrated a wide cross-section of
business, government, and scientific applications. Initially, corporate users
found VSAT networks to be financially attractive relative to leased lines from
the telephone companies. Large VSAT networks are now employed by
corporations to provide better data collection and information dissemination
to geographically dispersed facilities.
Table 4.4 lists several
important
industries that use VSAT networks and the services they provide. In general,
these
applications
involve
many
geographically
distributed
terminals.
Although
some
networks
provide
voice
communications, most
VSAT
networks provide
data services, which
are somewhat less sensitive to
transmission delay.
4.7.2 VSAT Network Types
Three. key elements that define VSAT network architecture are the
network topology, data rates, and multi-user access scheme. The two basic
network topologies for VSAT networks are star and mesh which are shown in
figure 4.10. In a mesh topology, VSAT terminals communicate with each
other using direct paths through the satellite, and thus VSAT-to-VSAT
transmissions require only one satellite hop. In a star topology, all VSAT
communications go through a hub. VSAT A transmits to VSAT B via an
inbound link to the hub; where it is retransmitted on an outbound link to

Network Systems and Examples
119
YSAT B. YSAT-to-YSAT communications thus involve two satellite hops in
the star configuration.

If there is little YSAT-to-YSAT communication, the star topology is
particularly effective; for example, if a hub is co-located with a corporate
headquarters and nearly all YSAT communications are to and from the
headquarters.
Transmit and receive data rates for YSAT sites are limited by the
antenna size and the capability of the transmit amplifier. In transponder-based
star networks, the hub antenna size and transmit amplifier power can usually
be made large enough that the link between the YSAT and the satellite
dominates performance. Consequently, higher transmit and receive data rates
are generally available in star networks than in mesh networks where both the
uplink and downlink are limited by YSAT performance. Data rates vary with

120

terminal size, but typical VSATs have transmitted information rates between
64 to 512 Kbps and receive information rates between 64 to 6000 Kbps.

VSAT systems employ Demand Assignment Multiple Access (DAMA) to
improve system utilization, which is further discussed in Chapter 6.
4.7.4 VSAT Example - LINKWAY
LINKWAY is a hubless VSAT system that enables users to integrate
a variety of applications into one network - in mesh, star, or multistar hybrid
topologies. LINKWAY uses MF-TDMA architecture and handles circuit- and
packet-switched traffic dynamically. Figure 4.11 shows LINKWAY network
configuration [86].

for users such as ISPs. An integrated burst modem features fast frequency
hopping for both transmit and receive .
The terminal includes a console interface port for unit installation and
maintenance, but LINKWAY is designed for stand-alone operation, requiring
no local operator control. To configure and monitor remote sites, either the
over-the-air satellite connection or dial-in using an external modem and
analog line can be used. The VSAT terminal includes a radio frequency
transceiver (RFT) consisting of C- or Ku-band radio equipment along with an
antenna and mounting hardware. Typical radio transmit powers are 5, ]0, and
20 watt in C-band, and 2, 4, 8, and ]6 watt in Ku-band, with uplink power
control for added availability.
Typical antenna sizes are] .2, 1.8, 2.4 meter in Ku-band, and 1.8, 2.4
and 3.8 meter in C-band. LINKWA Y can be used in a maritime or ground
mobile
environment using customer-supplied stabilized platforms. Using
GPS, system acquisition and timing is automatic, allowing for tum-key
mobile networking. LINKWAY terminals are controlled dynamically by a
full-featured
Network
Control
Center
(NCC)
that
runs
the
Network
Management System (NMS) server, and performs bandwidth management.
The NCC, which can be collocated with any LINKWAY terminal, manages
all the sites in the network via satellite. Local or remote NCC redundancy can
also be provided to ensure reliable network operation, providing automatic
network recovery.
In all the systems described in this chapter, one of the principal
requirements
is to
provide
user
service satisfaction. The
performance
framework forms the focus of the next chapter.

5.1 INTRODUCTION 
The rapid growth and ubiquity of the Internet is a major force driving 
the convergence of data, voice, and video applications. However, applications 
like audio/video streaming, distance learning etc., demand significant 
bandwidth and have strict timing requirements. This necessitates the

5.2.1 Why QoS

systems and transmission media. It is being used for email exchange and web

BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
browsing as a part of everyday life to many around the world. These new
networks bring in new applications some of which are multimedia and require
guaranteed bandwidth and delay bounds. These require network services
beyond the simple best-effort service that IP currently delivers .
Internet
has
also
evolved
through
many
changes
in
traffic
characteristics and applications and in link bandwidths and utilizations, as
opposed to a simple telephone
system.
Even though
the transmission
bandwidths increased from speeds of kilobits to several hundreds of megabits
and even gigabits, still some of the residential users receive speeds less than
56 Kbps. A proliferation of new bandwidth hungry applications is expected in
future. Periods of congestion on Internet will increase more than what is
experienced today. A given Iink or router of the Internet will carry thousands
and millions of sessions from a wide variety of applications whose service
levels of (satisfaction) requirements are different. Increase in bandwidth will
not fully alleviate the problem of congestion. Methods of traffic management,
congestion control and Quality of Service approaches become an important
issue in future. [87]
IP's best-effort service can satisfy any application requirement is true
assuming the network's bandwidth capacity is sufficient to avoid any delays
or dropped datagrams. Internet traffic increases in proportion to available
bandwidth as fast as it is added, so delays are inescapable. When Internet
traffic is very high, congestion occurs thus disabling sections of the Internet.
Delays can vary enough to adversely affect applications that have real-time
constraints. To provide service guarantees, IP services must be supplemented
with some added features to the nature that can differentiate traffic and enable
different service levels for different users and applications.
5.2.2 What is QoS
Quality of Service is the ability of a network element (e.g. an
application, host or router) to have some level of assurance that its traffic and
service requirements can be satisfied . It requires the cooperation of all
network layers from top-to-bottom, as well as every network element from
end-to-end. QoS manages bandwidth according to application demands and
network management settings. The bandwidth allocated to an application in a
resource reservation is no longer available for use by best-effort applications.
QoS-enabled high-priority applications must not disable the low-priority
Internet applications.
According to
ISO
8402,
QoS
is
defined
as
"the
totality of
characteristics of an entity that bear on its ability to satisfy stated and implied
needs." ISO 9000 defines quality as the degree to which a set of inherent

Quality of Service in Layered Architecture
125
characteristics fulfills requirements. ITU-T Recommendation E.800 defines
QoS as "the collective effect of service performance which determine the
degree of satisfaction of a user of the service" [88]. The end-to-end network
performance
includes
access
network
performance
and
core
network
performance. Other ITU-T Recommendations, such as ITU-T 1.350 [89] and
ITU-T Y.] 540 have developed network performance and network interface-
network interface QoS. Recently ITU-T Y.1541 has developed 6 classes of
applications [22] and provides application QoS objectives as discussed in
Chapter] O.
The term QoS is used in many meanings, ranging from the user's
perception of the service to a set of connection parameters necessary to
achieve particular service quality. Figure 5.1 represents a general QoS model,
and the approaches ofITU, ETSI, and IETF [4].
According to the ITU/ETSI approach, the different viewpoints of QoS
are customer's QoS requirements, QoS offered by service provider, QoS
achieved by service provider, and QoS perceived by customer. Based on the
customer's QoS requirements, QoS offered and achieved by the service
provider will be different from the QoS perceived by the customer. A
customer's QoS parameters are focused on user perceived effect, and do not
depend on the network design. The parameters might be assured to the user by
the service providers through contracts.

QoS offered by the service providers is a statement of the level of
quality expected to be offered to the customer by the service provider for
planning and Service Level Agreements (SLA). Each service would have its
own set of QoS parameters. For example, service providers may state that the

126
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
availability of basic telephony service is planned to be 99.995% in a year with
not more than 1 minute break at anyone occasion and not more than 3 breaks
over the year.
QoS achieved or delivered by the service provider is a statement of
the level of quality actually achieved and delivered to the customer. For
example, in the previous quarter, availability was 99.97% with 5 breaks of
service of which one lasted 55 minutes. QoS perceived by the customer is
expressed usually in terms of degrees of satisfaction, through customer
surveys. For example, rating of 3 on a 5-point scale indicating excellent
service. The service provider may not be in a position to offer customers the
level of the required QoS. Ideally all these viewpoints are to be converged for
a given service.
In a telephone network, for a telephone call, a reserved path and a
grade of service are used to specify QoS. In a packet switched network such
as Internet, it is not that simple because there is no requirement for a reserved
path from source to destination . Every packet follows its own path to reach
the destination. The packets traffic is bursty and follows random arrival
process. Periods of congestion are commonplace in the Internet, resulting in
both packet loss and jitter. Thus, QoS models have to be developed for the
Internet to meet new application requirements.
The Internet Engineering Task Force (lETF) has proposed QoS
mechanisms for handling IP traffic in the Internet supported by terrestrial
networks. For satellite based Internet, models such as Integrated Services
(lntServ), Differentiated Services (DiffServ), and MPLS traffic engineering
have to be extended to meet the satellite link characteristics. European
Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) has been developing the QoS
architecture for satellite
IP networks for multimedia applications. The
ETSIIBSM architecture is given in Section 5.2.6.
5.2.3 End-to-End QoS Layer Model
Figure 5.2 shows an end-to-end Quality of Service model concept for
a satellite IP network. QoS requires the cooperation of all network layers from
top-to-bottom, as well as every network element from end-to-end. As shown
in the figure, at each layer, the user performance requirements are achieved by
using
efficient
technologies
and
counteracting
any
factors
causing
degradation.
For example, at the physical layer, bandwidth efficient modulation
and encoding schemes have to be used to improve the BER and power level
performance under weather conditions such as rain. Similarly, a superior QoS

Quality of Service in Layered Architecture
127
is achieved providing the guaranteed bandwidth at the link layer by using
efficient bandwidth on demand multiple access schemes and studying the
interaction of bandwidth allocation mechanisms in the presence of congestion
and fading. The provision of a specific bandwidth to be offered by the
physical layers to the upper layers implies the existence of a bandwidth
allocation scheme that shares the bandwidth available among the different
user terminals with different traffic classes. To satisfy the different OoS
service
level
guarantees,
service
classification, marking,
queuing,
and
scheduling functions provide the services according to the SLAs in the case of
DiffServ at the network layer. Currently, most of the Internet applications use
the TCP protocol which needs to be optimized for guaranteed throughputs,
delay, and minimum delay variations over a satellite environment mitigating
the link impairments details of which are given in Section 7.3. Eventually,
these OoS parameters have to be mapped to the application OoS as required
by the system design and target applications.

the various interfaces at each subsequent lower to the upper layers. This

128
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
model is explained through ETSIIBroadband Satellite Multimedia (BSM)
architecture in Section 5.2.6.
5.2.4 QoS Parameters
There is more than one level of criteria to satisfy the different types of
traffic, (e.g., time sensitive financial, still images, large data, video). For
example, the time delay in transferring large files and high-resolution images
may not be adequate for the voice communication. Quality of service has
become an extremely important issue to be addressed [90, 91]. The QoS
parameters are discussed in the following paragraphs.
Delay is the time for a packet to be transported from the sender to the
receiver.
For the TCP protocol, higher orders of delay result in greater amounts
of data held "in transit" in the network. This affects in tum the counters and
timers associated with the protocol. TCP is a "self-clocking" protocol, where
the sender's transmission rate is dynamically adjusted to the flow of signal
information
coming
back
from the
receiver,
via the reverse direction
acknowledgments. Larger delays between sender and receiver make the
feedback
loop
insensitive,
and
therefore
the
protocol
becomes
more
insensitive to short-term dynamic changes in network load. For interactive
voice and video applications, larger delays are not acceptable .
Jitter is the variation in end-to-end transit delay.
High
levels
of jitter cause
the
TCP
protocol
to
make
very
conservative estimates of round trip time (RTT), causing the protocol to
operate inefficiently when it reverts to timeouts to reestablish a data flow.
High levels ofjitter in UDP-based applications are unacceptable for real-time
applications, such as audio or video. Jitter causes the signal to be distorted,
which in turn can only be rectified by increasing the receiver's reassembly
playback queue. This increases the delay which is unattractive for interactive
applications.
Bandwidth is the maximal data transfer rate that can be sustained
between two end points.
This is limited not only by the physical infrastructure of the traffic
path within the transit networks, which provides an upper bound to available
bandwidth, but is also limited by the number of other flows which share
common components ofthis selected end-to-end path.
Packet loss is defined as the ratio of the number of undelivered
packets to the total number of sent packets.

Quality of Service in Layered Architecture
129
It can occur due to a poorly configured or poorly performing
switching system which delivers packets out-of-order or even drop packets
through transient routing loops. Unreliable or error-prone network transit
paths can also cause retransmission of the lost packets. For example, TCP
cannot distinguish between loss due to the packet corruption and loss due to
congestion. Packet loss invokes the same congestion avoidance behavior
response from the sender, which reduces the sender's transmit rate.
Reliability is the percentage of network availability depending upon
the various environmental parameters such as rain. In satellite-based network,
the availability depends on the frequency band of operation, power levels,
antenna size and the traffic for the service provided. Advanced error control
techniques are used to provide good link availability .

5.2.5 QoS Building Blocks
Central to the OoS architectural framework is a set of generic
building blocks for controlling and delivering the network service response to
a service request, especially where there is network resource contention . As
shown in figure 5.4, the building blocks are organized according to three
logical planes: control plane, data plane, and management plane [4]].

Figure 5.4: QoS building blocks[41J
Control plane
Control
plane contains
mechanisms dealing with the pathways
through which user data traffic travels. These mechanisms include admission
control, QoS routing, and resource reservation .
Admission control controls the traffic to be admitted into the network
in such a way that newly admitted traffic does not result in network overload
or service degradation to existing traffic.
QoS routing concerns the selection of a path satisfying the QoS
requirements of a flow.
Resource reservation sets aside
required
network
resources on
demand for delivering desired network performance.
Data plane
Data plane contains mechanisms dealing with the user data traffic
directly, which include buffer management, congestion avoidance, packet
marking, queuing and scheduling, traffic classification, traffic policing, and
traffic shaping.
Buffer
management
decides
which
of
the
packets
awaiting
transmission are to be stored or which dropped . An important goal of queue
management
is
to
minimize
the
steady-state
queue
size
while
not
underutilizing links, as well as preventing a single flow from monopolizing
the queue space.

Quality of Service in LayeredArchitecture
131
Congestion avoidance deals with means for keeping the load of the
network under its capacity so that it can operate at an acceptable performance
level.
Packet marking: Packets can be marked according to specific service
classes they will receive in the network or on a per-packet basis. Packet
marking involves assigning a value to a designated header field of a packet in
a standard way. If done by a host, the mark has to be checked and could be
changed by an edge node according to Service Level Agreements (SLAs) or
local policies.
Queuing and scheduling is concerned with selection of packets for
transmission on an outgoing link. The various queuing disciplines are
discussed in Section 10.4.2.
Traffic classification can be done at the flow or packet level. At the
edge of the network, various fields of a packet are examined and the
aggregate to which the packet belongs is determined.
Traffic shaping deals with controlling the rate and volume of traffic
entering the network. The entity in charge of traffic shaping buffers non-
conformant packets until it brings the respective aggregate in compliance with
the traffic. The resulting traffic is less bursty than original traffic. Leaky
bucket and token bucket are the two important traffic shaping methods. The
leaky bucket method regulates the rate of the traffic leaving a node. The
outflow is maintained at a constant rate irrespective of the inflow rate.
Excessive packets overflowing the bucket are discarded. In the token bucket
method, tokens are generated at a certain rate and deposited in the token
bucket till it is full. Every time a certain volume of traffic is allowed to leave
the node, a token is used. Packets can be transmitted as long as there are
tokens in the bucket. This method puts no limit on the rate of the traffic
leaving the node (provided the token bucket is not empty).
Management plane
Management plane contains mechanisms dealing with the operation,
administration, and management aspects of the user data traffic. These
mechanisms are
metering, policy, service
level
agreement, and
traffic
restoration.
Metering concerns monitoring the temporal properties, e.g., rate, of a
traffic stream against the agreed traffic profile. It can invoke necessary
treatment like dropping or shaping, for the packet stream.
A Service level agreement (SLA) represents the agreement between a
customer and a provider of a service that specifies the level of availability,
serviceability, performance, operation or other attributes of the service.
Service level service (SLS), the technical part of SLA, includes a set of
parameters and their values that together define the service offered to a
customer's traffic by a network.

132
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
Traffic restoration is defined as the mitigating response from a
network under conditions of failure. Types of network failures are (a) failure
of an element in a network node, and (b) failure of a link connecting two
network nodes. Methods for failure recovery include automatic protection
switching for line or path protection, and shared mesh restoration.
5.2.6 Protocol Architecture - ETSI
Figure 5.5 shows protocol architecture for a broadband satellite
multimedia (BSM) proposed by ETSI [93]. This figure shows the satellite
dependent and independent functionality at the different layers shown. A
Satellite Independent Service Access Point (SI-SAP) is defined for the air
interface to separate the satellite independent upper layers from the satellite
dependent lower layers. It allows transport layer protocols alternative to TCP
and UDP and
introduces an access point independent of the satellite
technology. As shown in end-to-end QoS in Section 5.2.3, the services offered
by the lower layers provide the necessary QoS mapping at the higher layers.
The architecture is not restricted to the current used protocols only. However,
a complete end-to-end QoS realization of a broadband network depends upon
the specific resource allocation algorithms,
link impairments mitigation
techniques, congestion control and classification of service mechanisms.
These issues are addressed in later sections.

control above the Satellite Independent-Service Access Point (SI-SAP) and
the related bearer service manager below the SI-SAP (b) User plane functions
that operate on the individual packets which includes packet classification and
packet conditioning functions above the SI-SAP and admission control
functions below the SI-SAP. The subscription control function provides the
authorization for all users transactions, both C-plane and U-plane.
The OoS functions of satellite network elements, which are managed
through control actions at different elements of the system discussed in [94].
A proper satellite network design and the applications to be serviced dictate
the OoS parameter values. The objectives for a satellite IP network for six
classes of service are described in Chapter 10. These need to be reviewed with
a specific satellite system, application, simulation, and measurements to
validate.
The OoS functions and parameters discussed in Section 5.2.4 are
elaborated further in the rest of the book following the end-to-end OoS layer
concepts, surveying the issues, research results, and the future work needed
through examples.
Quality of Service in the Access Network
The evolution of the core network architecture tends to a very high-
rate optical backbone, where very few operations must be done on the nodes
in order to reduce the switching delay. Accordingly, more Qo'S-related
operations need to be done at the ingress nodes, in the access (or edge)
network. These operations are:
â€¢
Classification: Packets must be classified according .to the type of
traffic they carry, to the port, IP or layer 2 address.
â€¢
Traffic marking: Packets are marked in order for the network to treat
them as required by the specific class of service.
â€¢
Traffic policing: According to the class of service, packets are treated
in a different way depending on the required OoS.
â€¢
Traffic shaping: Ongoing packets are given a specific traffic profile in
terms of bandwidth, depending on the policy decided above.

134
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
â€¢
Authentication, Authorization and Accounting - AAA: According to
the user profile, end user's packets are accepted or denied, and a
specific access to network resources is assigned.
â€¢
Traffic scheduling: The proper forwarding strategy
for packets
coming from the core network and going to the end user network will
be selected, depending on the type of service the packet is carrying
on.
Traffic classification can be done depending on the packet IP address,
Port numbers, and MAC addresses. Once the end user has been authenticated,
according to the Service Level Agreement (SLA) that the end user has
negotiated with the Internet Service Provider, the access node will reserve to
each specific traffic flow originated from that user the corresponding network
resources, in order to satisfy the required service level specifications.
The AAA phase is critical to the final end user satisfaction, because
its output can be the final report given to the end user (particularly for
business users), which resumes all the offered service level characteristics. As
a matter of fact, one of the most criticized aspects in the OoS management is
the lack of information on the offered service level. Usually, customers are
not endowed with tools for monitoring the received OoS, and therefore they
have to take whatever is given by the service provider in the performance
report. Moreover, another critical aspect for the end-to-end OoS deployment
is the proper agreement between different service providers on the definition
ofthe service level specifications.
Quality of Service in the Core Network
As mentioned above, the core-network node will have to forward
packets as soon as possible, and therefore the operations that will be required
to this node should be kept at the minimum. The main functions required at
the backbone nodes are:
â€¢
Classification: Packets need to be classified also at the core node, in
order to decide the suitable forwarding strategy.
â€¢
Congestion avoidance: Packets are dropped randomly in order to
avoid congestion in the network node.
â€¢
Congestion management: Specific algorithms are implemented into
the network node in order to reduce the node congestion once it has
happened.
â€¢
Traffic scheduling: the output port of the network node will get
packets from the internal queues with specific strategies, according to
the chosen congestion management algorithm, with the aim of
satisfying each service requirements.

Quality of Service in Layered Architecture
135
These functions are done either at the IP layer or even at lower layers,
such as ATM or Frame Relay. In many next-generation backbone networks,
the IP layer is treated only at the edge nodes, while the backbone will operate
at layers I or 2 at the maximum, thus requiring as little software processing as
possible at the core nodes.
5.2.8 Mobile QoS
Mobile communication exists between mobile host-to-fi xed host and
mobile host-to-mobile host. This communication could arise either in a purely
wireless satellite or a hybrid satellite with a terrestrial network. In the
terrestrial case the definition of QoS and its parameters are still valid .
Whereas, in a mobile satellite environment, the mobile QoS is related to
bandwidth variation due to mobile host roaming, link delay, and nodal
congestion. An essential aspect of QoS for mobile systems in LEO or MEa
satellite networks is the handover QoS [95] As the mobile host migrates from
one satellite coverage to another; a connection can be forced due to the failure
of mobile handover. These failures are characterized by handover blocking
probability. This results due to (a) inability to provide the desired OoS in the
new satellite (b) failure of a gateway (c) inability to handover in time and (d)
failure of satellite. In a mobile satellite IP network architecture these handover
QoS
parameters
include:
handover,
urgency,
probability
of handover
blocking, probability of new packet blocking, traffic disruption period during
handovers, packet loss during handovers, and speed of handover operation.
The IETF is currently working on defining the mobile IP for terrestrial
networks. However, for a global hybrid satellite/terrestrial networks, not
much research is reported and OoS architectures and performance models are
yet to be developed.
5.2.9 QoS Challenges
In summary, some of the challenges for Quality of Service support are as
below :
â€¢
Network flexibility is becoming central to enterprise strategy .
â€¢
Traffic is fractal and bursty.
â€¢
Interactive applications such
as voice
and video
have stringent
bandwidth and latency demands.
â€¢
Multiple application networks are being combined into consolidated
corporate utility networks. Web browsing, email, file transfers, or
other
low-priority or bulk traffic leave
little space
for critical
transaction traffic
leading
to bandwidth contention
and
latency
problems.

136
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
â€¢
Decisions have to be made as to who controls and how they control
competing demands for network service and backboneconnectivity.
Several mechanisms to provide ATM QoS and IP QoS were
recommended by the ATM Forum, IETF, ETSI, and ITU. Applicability of
these
QoS technologies for
broadband
satellite network design and
performance, which forms one of the major objectives of this book, is
described in Chapter7, Part Three, and Part Four.
5.2.10 System Availability
In addition to
the QoS parameters described above, system
availability is an important performance parameter to be specified. Two types
of availability parameters as defined in ITU-T Recommendation 1.357 [96]
are Availability Ratio (AR) (known as satellite availability), and Mean Time
Between Outages (MTBO) defined as the average duration of a continuous
time interval during which the ATM network portion is available [97]. An
example of ATM transport over satellite is considered by the ITU-R[98].
Satellites exhibit performance characteristics determined by changing
atmospheric conditions that affect the signal propagation, the various sources
of interference, and the type of equipment used. Considering these aspects,
the expression to define satellite system availability is:
ASatellitc Path = ALink* AEarth Station * ASpacccrall
where
ALink represents the availability component due to uplink and
downlink rain attenuation and interferenceeffects.
AEarth Station represents the availability (equipment reliability) of all
transmit and receive earth station equipment up to the terrestrial interface. It
also includes sun interferenceeffects. The availability of any ATM equipment
that may be used specifically in a satellite connection is to be further studied.
ASpacecraft represents the total availability (equipment reliability) of the
spacecraft, including eclipse outages. The available of any onboard ATM
processing and/or switching equipment is to be studied further.
ASatcllitc Path represents the product of all available components on a
satellite link.
In addition to the above, another availability component due to traffic
congestion (ACongcstion) is being considered. This parameter, as applied to
satellite system, may include the availability due to traffic congestion or
queuing from onboard ATM equipment and/or any satellite specific ATM
equipment used at the earth stations.

Quality of Service in Layered Architecture
137
At present, not enough is known about the MTBO exhibited by Ka-
band satellite systems supporting both ATM and IP networks as they are
under development.

6.2 PHYSICAL LAYER 
Due to the new applications for IP satellite services, there is a great 
interest among satellite network designers to apply advanced technologies to 
increase the data handling capacity of the existing and planned satellite 
transponders. The advanced technologies are essentially characterized by the 
way they improve either power performance (EblNo) or bandwidth efficiency 
(bps/Hz) or both. Another important criteria to achieve guaranteed QoS is rain 
attenuation and fade mitigation techniques. In this section a brief overview of 

142
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
such mitigation techniques are given for completeness. Further details can be
obtained from [99,100,101 , 102].
An account of modulation and encoding techniques, adaptive coding,
power control, and diversity is given in the following paragraphs.
6.2.1 Higher Order Modulation
In a satellite system , data rate, modulation and coding choices drive
link
availability,
required
transmitter
power,
and
required
bandwidth.
Modulation choices must also consider transponder linearity and adjacent
channel interference. Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) is the existing
modulation scheme. Higher order modulation is being studied to increase the
achievable bps/Hz compared to the more common QPSK .
The two most common higher-order waveforms available in off the
shelf products are 8-PSK (Phase Shift Keying) and 16-QAM (Quadrature
Amplitude Modulation). 8-QPSK is spectrally more efficient. Depending on
the implementation, it may be operated with a non-linear (saturated) power
amplifier at the earth station and/or satellite transponder. Turbo coding
compensates for power increase requirements with use of 8-PSK. However,
the 16-QAM signal must be used [103] with linear channels - which can
significantly reduce the link CfNo compared to a saturated transponder. It
generally is not applicable for small terminal satellite applications. Further
details on advanced modulation techniques can be found in [102].
6.2.2 Encoding Techniques - Turbo and Concatenated
Coding choices must consider packet sizes and flush bit overhead.
Concatenated convolutional and block coding generally has an acceptable
overhead and has flush
bits for small IP packets. With turbo coding,
significant performance enhancements are possible [104]. Convolutional
latency and flush bits must be evaluated for small IP packets. Product codes
could be useful for small IP packets. The main advantage of turbo coding is
that it reduces the EtlNo needed to close a link at a given code rate. Known
turbo codes at reasonable block size and the complexity can come quite close
to the Shannon channel capacity limit (within about I to 2 dB) [105]. For
instance, an R=I/3 turbo code can achieve a BER of about 10,7at an EtlNo= I
dB with a block size of less than 2000 bits. Reducing the code rate to R=I/4
would reduce the Eg/N; required to about 0.7 dB. The turbo codes are being
standardized for DVB-RCS systems.
.

Physical and Link Layers
6.2.3 Propagation Effects
143
Future Ka-band satellite communications networks are subject to
degradation produced by the troposphere, which is much more, sever than
those found at lower frequency bands. These impairments include signal
absorption by rain, clouds and gases, and amplitude scintillations arising from
refractive index irregularities. Propagation factors that affect Ka-band satellite
links include:
â€¢
rain attenuation
â€¢
antenna wetting
â€¢
depolarization due to rain and ice
â€¢
gaseous absorption
â€¢
cloud attenuation
â€¢
melting layer attenuation
â€¢
troposphere scintillation
For example, rain attenuation at 20 GHz is almost three times that at
II GHz . Although some of these impairments can be overcome by oversizing
the ground station antennas and high power amplifiers, the current trend is
using small, low-cost ground stations that can be easily deployed at user
premises. As a consequence, most Ka-band systems are expected to employ
different forms of fade mitigation that can be implemented relativel y easily
and at modest cost. The rain fade mitigation approaches are defined by three
types of Ka-band communications systems - a low service rate Â« 1.5 Mbps),
a moderate service rate ( 1.5 to 6 Mbps) system and a high service rate (> 43
Mbps) system [101, 106, 107].
Typically the control signal for the compensation system is derived
from direct measurements on the downlink signal (20 GHz) that will allow
estimation of the uplink fade (30 GHz) . Rain fade compensation approaches
must consider at least three characteristics of the above propagation factors:
range of signal fading, rate of signal fluctuations, and frequency dependence
(scaling). Propagation measurements conducted with the ACTS beacons can
provide most of the required information.
6.2.4 Adaptive Coding Techniques
The use of adaptive coding allows a satellite system to be throughput
efficient while at the same time conserving its most valuable resource -
satellite electrical power. The principle relies on the fact that powerful
modern coding techniques allow constant user data throughput by employing
heavy code on a link-by-link basis depending on the link conditions at any

144
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
point in time. Algorithms can be used which allow automated sensing of
degrading and improving link conditions. One way of adapting throughput is
to control the coding rate (always less than I), which is defined as the ratio of
the number of input bits to the encoder to the number of output bits. The
channel
symbol can be a QPSK symbol or a generalized time and/or
frequency slice of a waveform.
Adaptation schemes involve direct adaptation of the bandwidth and
effective changes
in coding rate [108]. Systems which only vary the
throughput by adapting the coding rate are discussed. Thus, in particular, the
duration of a channel symbol is assumed constant, or stated another way; the
bandwidth ofthe transmission is constant.
Adaptation of Coding Rates
The coding rate can usually be expressed as the product of two rates
r.r. This applies, for instance, in the case of concatenated coding systems. If
the effect of the rate adaptation is to vary only one of these rates, say r, then
the net effect, given that the bandwidth is constant, is that the time required to
transmit a given number of bits changes with r . Without loss of generality, it
may be assumed that r is I when the throughput is at a maximum, and this is
referred to below as the lightly coded case. A case of particular interest to
system designers is when 1/ r is an integer in all adapted cases. Then it takes
2, 3, 4, ... , etc. times as long to transmit a given set of data in adapted, or
heavily-coded, cases relative to the lightly-coded case where r = I.
The simplest case, and the one that is focused on, is that in which
there is only one adapted case, and r = ~ when adapted. It can be said that
the heavy code is of rate Y2 relative to the light code in this case. Of course,
the light code could be no code at all, in which case r, = I.
Adaptive Coding Protocols
In this section, centrally controlled adaptive coding systems are
addressed.
The central control entity for the adaptive coding system is
assumed to reside either in the satellite payload or in a ground facility. In the
latter case, communication between all ground terminals and the control entity
is assumed to go through the satellite which forms the analysis.
The central
ground control entity is called the network control center.
The delay before the implementation of a different down link coding
rate by a ground terminal is defined as the time interval between a change in

Physical and Link Layers
145
fading state up until the time that a new code rate is actually implemented.
Note that this time allowance includes the time required for the terminal to
discover a change in link conditions. The target delay for control by a central
network control center is 1.0 second. This defines the level of rain activity for
which the system offers service, as discussed next.
Now consider the rate at which rain attenuation changes, referred to
below as the fade slope. This is a key determining factor in the design of an
adaptive coding protocol.
As shown in figure 6.1, the dynamics of rain are
correlated with the availability goals of a system.
As shown, the rain
attenuation design goal and availability can be related to the fade slope. The
data for these experimental results were collected by COMSAT Laboratories
at Clarksburg, Maryland from an ACTS Satellite down link beacon signal in
1995. They show that the higher the design goal is, in terms ofthe fade depth,
with consequently higher terminal availability, the faster the received power
decreases, for approaching rain, or the faster the received power increases, for
receding rain.

Fade Slope (dB/s)
Figure 6.1: Experimental complementary distribution function offade slopes at 20.2 GHz.
Efficient adaptive coding systems allocate as little system capacity as
possible to link margin. Typically, the most critical link margin is calculated
at the edge-of-beam where, for a fixed size receive earth station, it is at a
minimum.
Under the assumption that the GSO satellite Effective Isotropic
Radiated Power (EIRP) is backed off at higher terminal elevation angles, it
may be assumed that the worst-case, edge-of-beam link margin is constant for
all beams in the GSO system.
Assuming a 6-8 dB rain attenuation design goal, figure 6.1 shows that
a 0.9 dBls fade slope can be accommodated 99.9% of the time. Given this
fade slope, a prudent system design with adaptive coding control at a network

146
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
control center requires 1 dB of clear-sky margin so that the system bit-error
rate design goal can be maintained. [108]
Heavy Code Capacity Resource in an Adaptively-Coded Down Link
Beam
The previous two sections indicate how an adaptively coded system
can adapt
its link robustness' to match the particular link propagation
characteristics that exist on a link-by-link and second-by-second basis. The
scheme that is focused here allows an end-to-end service to maintain a
constant data rate within the availability envelope regardless of the conditions
of the downlink. In this scheme the bandwidth of a transmission remains
constant. All that really changes in response to a code rate change is the
length of time a terminal must receive symbols over each down link frame in
order to maintain a given data rate. To maintain a data rate in the heavy
coding state, in each frame a terminal must receive data over twice the
duration of time required to receive the same data rate in the light coding
state. The concept of heavy code capacity (i.e., "spare capacity") in this
context therefore reduces to allocating twice the time for a given transmission
data rate to a user employing heavy coding than to one employing light
coding. If a down link frame is made up of equal duration time slots, then
links operating with heavy code use a minimum of two time slots.
The Role of Link Margin in an Adaptively-Coded Down Link Beam
Link margin in an adaptively coded system is required for one
purpose only:
to allow enough time to enact a coding
state change.
Theoretically, if the distributed control system allowed instantaneous code
rate changes with a minimum of detection time, then very little margin would
be required. Practical implementations employing a central control authority
clearly require margin to allow enough time for detection, the coding state
change protocol between terminals and the network control center, and also
for processing and state transitions within the satellite transmitter, terminal
receivers and resource allocation maps.
In order to protect service availability from rain events, excess down
link margin in an adaptive coding system allows each terminal enough time
to: (I) determine that a rain event is going to cause, with high probability,
performance incompatible with the present coding state, (2) request a new
coding state via a centralized protocol, and (3) respond to a command from
the regional network control center to change the coding state, given that the
terminal's request is granted.

Physical and Link Layers
6.2.5 Adaptive Power Control
147
This section provides an important issue of compensation of rain
attenuation - the power control for uplink and downlink. [109]
Uplink Power Control- Bent Pipe Satellite
The
uplink
power
control
approach
for dynamic
allocation
of
additional power to the transmit carrier(s) at an earth station is used in order
to compensate for rain attenuation. Three types of power control techniques
can be considered:
Open-loop: One station receives its own transmit carrier and must
rely on its measurement of beacon fading in the downlink in order to perform
uplink power control.
Closed-loop: Two earth stations are in the same beam coverage and
an earth station can receive its own transmit carrier. Uplink power control
based on this carrier is erroneous due to changes in input and output back offs
under uplink and downlinks fading. It needs to be on the reception of a
distinct carrier transmitted from another station .
Feedback loop: A central control station monitors the levels of all
carriers it receives, and commands the affected earth stations to adjust their
uplink powers accordingly. This technique has inherent control delays, and
requires more earth segment and space segment resources.
Downlink Power Control - Bent Pipe Satellite
This technique allocates additional power to the transmit carrieres) at
the satellite in order to compensate for rain attenuation. As the downlink
fading occurs, downlink carrier power degrades and sky noise temperature
seen by the earth station increases. Power control correction of approximately
1.5 times fade is required to maintain carrier to noise ratio. If correction is
applied at the satellite, the effective isotropic radiated power for the entire
beam is increased, raising the signal level at both faded and non-faded earth
stations. For quasi-linear transponder operation, correction can be applied at
the transmitting earth station. The Traveling Wave Tube Amplifiers (TWTAs)
with variable output power levels can be commanded into high-power modes
to counteract downlink fades. For beam diameters greater than rain cell
diameter, correction should be applied only when a certain percentage of
terminals within the beam exceed an attenuation threshold. This technique
must ensure that power flux density limits are not exceeded at non-faded
terminals. The system design must ensure that the communications channel is
not interrupted during power level changes.

148
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
Uplink Power Control- Onboard Processing Satellite
With an onboard processing satellite, for a link transmitting from
point A and receiving at point B, the received information bit error rate at
point B is given by:
= uplink information bit error rate = FU(BERuplillk)
= uplink information bit error rate = FU(BERDownlillk)
= function describing relationship between uplink (or
BER and uplink (or downlink) channel BER.
BERB == BERuplink + BERDownlink

Site Diversity - Bent Pipe or Onboard Processing Satellite
This technique involves tandem operation of two earth stations, and
exploits the finite size of rain cells (5 km to 10 km). Fading at sites separated
by distances exceeding the average rain cell size are expected to be correlated.
Diversity gain or the reduction in link margin depends on site separation,
frequency, elevation angle, and baseline orientation angle. Diversity gain
calculation assumes ideal switching in which the least affected size is always
selected. Site diversity is very effective in combating rain fades. On the other
hand, the cost of the second site, dedicated terrestrial interconnection, service
interruptions, required data buffering and site synchronization are considered
significant system overload or major disadvantages. In general this technique
is best suitable for network control centers and major gateways, and not
applicable for low-cost earth stations unless applied with public switched
networks to interconnect the terminals.
6.3 LINK LAYER: MEDIA ACCESS CONTROL
A wide range of Media Access Control protocols have been proposed
for different network operating environments and applications. Most of the
higher layer protocols such as TCP/IP, FTP, and HTTP use one ofthese MAC
protocols. For satellite communications, many Demand Assignment Multiple
Access (DAMA) schemes have been developed and implemented for both
commercial and military environments to increase the system utilization and
flexibility [110]. Single channel per carrier PCM Multiple Access Demand
Assignment Equipment (SPADE) was one of the early DAMA systems used
over IntelSat IV satellite employing circuit switching. Over the years, due to
the fast growth of packet switching and packet networks for data applications,
many MAC protocols have been developed. Many bandwidths on demand

[111]. Research
and standardization efforts
for broadband
satellite for multimedia services is in progress. More information about
standardization can be found in Chapter 9.
The propagation delay of the satellite channel limits the applicability
of some of the access protocols developed for LANs and WANs e.g., Carrier
Sense Multiple Access (CSMA), and CSMA based Mini Slotted Alternating
Priority (MSAP) [112]. On the other hand, both implicit and explicit
reservation protocols have proved to be better useful to satellite environment.
For example, Priority Oriented Demand Assignment (PODA) and its variants
were used on packet satellite experiments on SATNET [26, 113]. This section
briefly surveys MAC protocols for satellite networks. A class of bandwidth
allocation schemes for Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) based interactive IP
platforms is discussed. The technical challenges at this layer are identified.
Multiple access schemes can be classified according to (a) accessing
technique - fixed or demand, (b) switching technique - circuit, packet, or cell,
and (c) control-central and distributed.
Factors such as the technology available, the reliability or flexibility
desired, and system elements already in use influence the choice of protocols.
Access
control
procedures for allocating satellite capacity resources to
network users most commonly are based on dedicated channel assignments.
As a result,
channel
utilization may be low and networks
cannot be
dynamically adapted to fluctuations in source statistics and priorities. Demand
assignment techniques can provide users with timely access to the satellite.
Some combination of fixed and demand assignment channels is usually
appropriate. For example, high priority, high duty factor circuits could be
permanently assigned while the low priority, low duty factor traffic would
compete for demand
assigned
channels,
requiring very limited control
complexity.
6.3.1 Fixed Assignment Multiple Access (FAMA)
The FAMA protocols are the most efficient techniques for satellite
networks composed of a small number of Â«
10) terminals with stable and
predictable traffic patterns. A FAMA protocol may be implemented on a
frequency, time, or code basis. Major techniques include frequency-division
multiple access (FDMA), time-division multiple access (TDMA), and code-
division multiple access (CDMA). [114]

150
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
6.3.1.1 Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)
In FDMA, the entire available frequenc y is divided into bands, each
of which is assigned to a terminal. FDMA was the first FAMA method used
in satellite systems. It is characterized by continuous access to the satellite in
a given frequency band. No coordination or synchronization is required
among terminals. Each terminal can use its own band without interference.
However, in FDMA when a terminal is idle, its share of the bandwidth cannot
be used by other terminals. It is simple to implement but not flexible.
6.3.1.2 Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)
In TDMA, the time is divided into time slots and each slot is
preassigned to a terminal. During the assigned slot, each terminal is allowed
to transmit, and the entire system resources are devoted to the terminal. The
slot assignments are periodic, and each period is called a cycle or aframe. A
terminal could be assigned to one or more time slots during a cycle. TDMA is
popular mainly because of its compatibility with the nonlinear nature of
transponders and is used in the majority of current satellite systems. The
major disadvantage ofTDMA is the requirement that each terminal must have
a fixed allocation of channel time whether or not it has data to transmit. For
bursty traffic, a fixed allocation is wasteful of resources. It has the advantage
of providing good throughput for large number ofterminals. The disadvantage
is that the terminals must be synchronized so that each terminal knows exactly
when to transmit. Both FDMA and TDMA are contention-free and can
provide QoS guarantees at the cost of efficient utilization of resources.
For representing the throughput delay performance of FDMA and
TDMA, let R be the channel bandwidth in bits/sec which is shared among N
terminals, and let P be the packet length. It is shown [I 15] that for M ~ 2 and
an M/G/) queuing system, the expected delay characteristics of FDMA is
higher than the expected delay characteristics ofTDMA.
DF/JMA = DW MA + ~ (~ -1) ~ DW MA
where D is the expected delay.
6.3.1.3 Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
(6.2)
Neither FDMA nor TDMA allow any time overlap of the terminal
transmission. A conflict-free protocol that overlaps transmission, both in

Physical and LinkLayers
151
FOMA and COMA techniques is COMA. The conflict-free property of
COMA is achieved by using quasi-orthogonal signals in conjunction with
matching filters at the receiving terminals. Using multiple orthogonal signals
increases the bandwidth required for transmission. In a COMA system, each
user is assigned a unique code sequence, which is used to spread the data
signal over a wider bandwidth than that required to transmit the data.
TOMA-based and COMA-based return channel protocols for OVB-
RCS system are given in Chapter 13.
6.3.2 Random Access
Due to technological advances, small and inexpensive terminals with
lower data rates are now widely available, thus stimulating home or personal
use of satellite access service. The number of terminals within a satellite
footprint increases from a few to several hundreds or thousands. In addition,
traffic generated is very bursty. For such applications random access protocols
are used.
Random access protocols, unlike contention-free protocols where
every scheduled transmission is guaranteed to succeed, do not guarantee
successful transmission in advance . Each terminal makes its own decision
regarding when to access the channel and there is no coordination to avoid
collision entirely . Since random access involves no control, it is easy to
implement and is adaptive to varying demand although in some situations it
can be wasteful of capacity due to collision .
The random access schemes include Pure ALOHA, Slotted ALOHA,
Selective-Reject ALOHA, and Capture ALOHA. Pure ALOHA and slotted
ALOHA, which provide throughputs of 18% and 37% respectively, were used
for packet satellite systems. Improvements such as Contention Resolution
Algorithm were reported in the literature to improve the efficiency to 43%.
Random access protocols suffer from relatively limited capacity and are used
for control channels. In addition, the round trip propagation delay aggravates
the problem since each packet collision adds at least one round trip delay to
packet transmission time.
6.3.2.1 Pure ALOHA
The Pure ALOHA system allows several users to share a single
communications
channel
without
central
control
and
network
synchronization. The channel access is achieved on a contention basis.
Whenever a user transmits a packet, the transmission is successful only when

152
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
no other user transmits during the packet transmission time. If however, two
or more user packets arrive at the satellite at the same time, none of the
packets succeed and each must be retransmitted at a future time. Ifthe packet
transmission period isp seconds, then the packet is vulnerable during a period
of 2p seconds. Any other packet received in the vulnerable period will collide
with and destroy the packet.
6.3.2.2 Slotted ALOHA
To make more effective use of the channel, it is divided into time
slots such that the duration of the packet is exactly equal to the transmission
time of a single packet. In the Slotted ALOHA protocol , if a packet is to be
transmitted, the start must be synchronized with the beginning of the next
possible channel slot. As a result, the vulnerable period is only p seconds.
Conflicts occur only when more than one user packet arrives at the same slot
period. The conflict is a complete overlap rather than a partial one as in Pure
ALOHA. The capacity of a slotted ALOHA channel is twice that of a Pure
ALOHA channel.
6.3.2.3 Selective-Reject ALOHA
In asynchronous random transmission, most often collision between
packets is partial. In Pure ALOHA the packet is totally destroyed by a
collision. The Selective-Reject ALOHA protocol has been designed to avoid a
total destruction of the packet. The transmission packet is divided into
subpackets, each having its own header. When a collision occurs, only
collided subpackets will be retransmitted. This scheme is well suited for
variable length packets.
6.3.2.4 Capture ALOHA
For a given geographic distribution of equal-power earth terminals,
some terminals will be closer to the satellite than others and will get a radio
frequency (RF) "capture" effect [I 16]. This occurs whenever one signal is
about 6 dB or more stronger than another. The stronger signal packet survives
the collision with low error probability and the weaker signal packet is lost.
The capture effect increases throughput since collisions are not all destructive.

Physical and Link Layers
6.3.2.5 Contention Resolution Algorithm (CRA)
153
As mentioned above, the maximum channel utilization efficiency for
Slotted ALOHA is about 37%. IfeRA [117] is postulated, channel efficiency
of 43% can be obtained for Slotted ALOHA . This algorithm follows a divide
and conquer method: a variable duration epoch consists of slots where
contending user transmissions are continuously subdivided until they are
isolated, so that no packet collisions occur.
6.3.3 Demand Assignment Multiple Access
In situations where the traffic pattern is random and unpredictable,
FAMA leads to inefficient use of transponder capacity. Although random
access may better accommodate a large number of terminals with bursty
traffic, it provides no QoS guarantees. Demand Assignment Multiple Access
(DAMA) protocols attempt to solve this problem by dynamically allocating
system bandwidth in response to user requests . A resource request must be
granted before actual data transmission. The transmission of requests is itself,
a multiple access problem. After a successful reservation, bandwidth is
allocated on an overall FDMA or TDMA architecture, and data transmission
is guaranteed to be collision-free.
DAMA can be divided into reservation and token passing protocols.
Resource reservation can be made either explicitly or implicitly.
â€¢
Implicit Reservation: Reservation is made by occupation; an occupied
slot by the packet from a given terminal remains assigned to the
terminal
for the frames that follow. Reservation ALOHA is an
example of implicit reservation. The absence of extra time needed for
explicit reservation
is an advantage in implicit reservation . The
disadvantage is that a terminal is in a position to capture all the time
slots for itself.
â€¢
Explicit Reservation: A terminal sends a request to occupy certain
time slots. It is on per-transmission basis and usually a dedicated
reservation channel is shared among all terminals [118, 119]. Priority-
Oriented Demand Assignment (PODA) protocol is an example in this
case. The disadvantage of these protocols is the extra time required
for explicit reservation.
The two approaches to implement a global queue of requests for
distributed users are central control and distributed control.

154
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
Central control: Terminals send request messages to the central
terminal, which determines the resources assignment and informs the ready
terminals when to access the channel. An additional subchannel for controller-
to-user traffic is typically required. Since the channel is the only means of
communication among terminals, the main problem is how the request is to be
communicated to the central controller. To prevent collisions of the request
and data packets, the available bandwidth is divided in FDMA or TDMA
between the two types of data. The central controller manages the global
queue, accepts reservation, and informs terminals when to access the channel.
Central control has the advantages of having low equipment cost and the
lesser of amount of signaling since the whole network does not have to be
informed. It has the disadvantages of reduced reliability as correct operation
of network depends on proper functioning of the central terminal, and extra
delay introduced due to a double hop (enquiry/response) establishment time.
Distributed control: Each terminal maintains information on the
status of the global queue and makes its own decision as to when its turn to
access the channel is. It improves reliability since entire network operation is
not dependent on a single central terminal. Performance is also better,
especially when the propagation delay is long (e.g., satellite channels). The
minimum packet delay would be three times the round-trip delay in case of
central control with a terminal acting as the controller and two times the
round-trip delay in the case ofdistributed control.
6.3.3.1 Reservation ALOHA
In Reservation ALOHA [] 20], slots are arranged into a frame and,
unlike TDMA, no slot is permanently assigned to a user. The protocol is
dependent on the broadcast nature the channel, which permits all users to
monitor channel activity. If a user successfully transmits a packet into a slot
of the previous frame without collision with another user's transmission, the
user owns the slot for as long as the user has packets to transmit. The slot is
lost if there is no ready packet. Once a user owns a particular slot in a frame,
no other user can transmit in the corresponding slot in subsequent frames until
the owner releases the slot. Figure 6.2 describes the Reservation-ALOHA
system. The empty slots, including those involved in collisions in the previous
frame, are available to all users on a random access basis.

Figure 6.2: Reservation-ALOHA: reserved state
The algorithm employed in this system can be described as follows.
Each of the slots in the current frame is classified as OTHER, MINE, or
EMPTY. For example, in figure 6.2, slot I contents are received by user K,
who classifies the slot as EMPTY and transmits a packet in it. User K owns
the slot. After one round trip delay, user K learns about his successful
transmission of the packet. Then, if user K has a new packet to transmit, he
does so in slot I, otherwise slot I is automatically released. The user may
always transmit in a slot that he owns but is prohibited from transmitting in a
slot owned by another user.
Empty slots are available to all users on a contention basis. To
prevent excessive collisions in the empty slots, a user may transmit in a given
time slot with probability p proportional to the length of its queue. Such a
dynamic procedure controls the transmission rate of new packets in the empty
slots and provides
a randomization of the retransmission delay for an
unsuccessful packet. Some of the advantages of this protocol are: (a) change
in slot ownership with no permanent assignment, (b) easy accommodation of
new users, (c) a simple algorithm for implementation, and (d) applicability to
multiple packet messages.
6.3.3.2 Round-Robin Reservation
The
Round-Robin
reservation
scheme
combines Time
Division
Multiplexing (TOM) with dynamic allocation of the unused slots [121, 122].
Specifically, each user in the network is assigned one slot per frame, which is
called the owned slot. All unused assigned and unassigned slots per frame are
then dynamically available to the network as a pool on a first-come first-serve
basis. Each user maintains a channel queue table whose entries are moved by
each user. Thus, the dynamically assignable slots are allocated one at a time
among the active users. After all terminals have a dedicated slot each, any
extra slots available are used by all terminals using Slotted-ALOHA.
When a user has a ready packet, he transmits in his own slot,
deliberately generating a possible conflict. One round trip later, the conflict is

156
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
detected by all the users. The protocol for the dynamic assignment is as
follows. A user may send in a dynamically assigned slot unless a conflict was
received during that slot's last occurrence. This guarantees channel access
after one frame time to a previously inactive user even though another user
may be currently using that slot. Figure 6.3 shows round-robin reservation
scheme.

6.3.3.3 Priority-Oriented Demand Assignment (PODA)
PODA combines implicit and explicit requests. Each PODA TDMA
frame consists of a control part and a data part with an adjustable boundary.
The boundary is adapted to the current load. Access to the control part can be
deterministic or by ALOHA contention. All terminals track the control part
and maintain a queue to determine their proper access instances. For stream
traffic such as voice and video, a reservation is made only once, and is
retained by every terminal in a separate queue. PODA scheme is shown in
figure 6.4.

6.3.3.4 Fixed Priority Oriented Demand Assignment (FPODA)
A variation of PODA, which is Fixed Priority Oriented Demand
Assignment (FPODA), used in Universe network [114], which ties together
six local network scattered around the UK with a data rate of 1 Mbps and
frame length of 130 ms is described in this section. Each frame begins with
six minislots (100 bytes each), one per terminal (figure 6.5).
Minislots are
used by their terminals to transmit data or a reservation. Data is in the form of
HDLC frames and expanded to include source and destination address fields.
A terminal that receives a slot allocation in a particular frame may use it to
send one or more modified HDLC frames, which allow transmission to one or
more destination terminals . If a reservation is sent, it is a request for a
particular service.
One of the six terminals acts as a master and allocates time on the
channel based on reservation requests (including its own). The master splits
the remainder of the frame (after six minislots) into 1-6 variable length slots,
with each slot assigned to a particular terminal. The master maintains a queue
of requests and allocates time in the following order - (1) priority requests,
(2) remaining time divided among normal requests proportional to the
throughput estimates provided by the terminals (3) remaining time divided
equally among all terminals with bulk requests. FPODA is an effective
protocol when there is a small, fixed number ofterminals sharing the channel.

Several proprietary solutions for MAC exist. A standard for MAC
protocols is yet to be developed for broadband satellite either global or
regional networks providing differentiated services resulting in guaranteed
Quality of Service to high bandwidth applications.
6.3.5 ATM and Satellite MAC Protocols
Two types of services are proposed by ITU-T SG 13 [125] are
Continuous Bit Stream Oriented (CBO) services and Packet Oriented (PO)
services.
The following MAC
protocol
is a distributed reservation-based
protocol proposed for ATM traffic. An earth station uses Reservation Request
(RR) dedicated cells to reserve the bandwidth needed by its ATM traffic.
Figure 6.6 illustrates the adopted frame structure for the uplink channel.

GT: Guard Time
Figure 6.6: ArM embedding frame structure
Each satellite frame consists of control and information segments
containing control and information slots. A control slot is used by the earth
stations for reservation request and identifies a MAC channel. An information
slot is used to identify the minimum bandwidth that can be assigned to a
requesting earth station. The information slot is subdivided into a fixed
number of ATM cells. The protocol supports two kinds of slot assignment
policies: static and dynamic. In static assignment, an information slot is
assigned on a per-call basis to the requesting earth station. It is suitable for
CBO services. In dynamic assignment the bandwidth is assigned on a per-call
basis to different earth stations according to the current request pattern. The
slots are dynamically shared among earth stations on a frame-by-frame basis.
It is suitable for PO services.
This is a distributed multi-access protocol in which a fraction of the
uplink bandwidth can be shared for PO cells access. For PO traffic, the MAC
protocol consists ofthree phases :
â€¢
Reservation phase: By using the control slot, each earth station
transmits its own Reservation Requests (RRs). Each RR indicates the
number of slots needed by the queued PO cells. TDMA is used to
access the control slots.
â€¢
Collection phase: The satellite receives the RRs and repeats them on
the downlink. Each earth station receives all the RRs and processes
them according to the bandwidth assignment algorithm.
â€¢
Submission phase: During this phase, the cells whose RRs have been
accepted are transmitted.
A TDMA based bandwidth allocation scheme has been analyzed in
Chapter 16 to support CBR and VBR traffic over satellite network .

160
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
6.3.6 Interactive Multimedia over Satellite
DYB-RCS
standard
provides
various
bandwidth
allocation
approaches, which are discussed below. However, these approaches need
dynamic allocation algorithms and scheduling mechanisms to provide the user
QoS.
Continuous Rate Assignment (CRA) - Rate capacity (in slots/frame),
is provided to the Satellite Interactive Terminal (SIT) in full when needed and
reserved for the duration of connection. The bandwidth is negotiated at call
set-up between the SIT and the call processing function of the Network
Management System (NMS) and configured in the scheduler.
CRA is
typically used for real-time applications e.g., voice, video streaming - (CBR,
rt-YBR). The
features
of CRA
include
fixed guaranteed bit rate,
no
scheduling latency, and minimum delay jitter.
Rate-Based Dynamic Capacity (RBDC) - In RBOC, requests are
made in slots/frame up to a maximum booked value (maxRBOC), and
configured into the scheduler by the NMS at connection set-up. The capacity
is guaranteed for a number of successive frames, until a new request is made
or until a time-out expires. RBOC is used for nrt-YBR, ABR applications. It
is tolerant to scheduling delay and suitable for jitter tolerant applications.
Volume-Based Dynamic Capacity (VBDC) - Requests are made for
absolute volume, in number of slots, with no time constraint by the SIT.
Bandwidth in VBOC is assigned for a specific period only if both the
conditions are met: (a) all CRA capacity has been assigned the SIT population
for that frame period (b) the SIT population guaranteed assignment has not
been reached or there is unused capacity available. VBDC typically is used
for ABR and UBR services which are tolerant for scheduling latency, and
delay jitter.
Free Capacity Assignment (FCA) - Free capacity represents the
capacity left after all requests have been satisfied and there are no signaling
requests from SITs. FCA is assigned for a specific period after all CRA and
YBOC capacity has been assigned for that frame period and if there is unused
capacity available. If available, FCA is assigned at a throughput of 16 Kbps
for a single frame period. FCA can be used for Best Effort users.
These capacity allocations methods should be mapped into different
DiffServ per hop behaviors to provide end-to-end application QoS for
different applications. These problems have been addressed by [126, 127].
These include bandwidth allocation, interaction between BoD and transport

Physical and LinkLayers
161
layer protocols, interaction of BoD and network congestion, and bandwidth
allocation with fading.
Bandwidth on Demand (BoD) or Dynamic bandwidth allocation
algorithms: Bandwidth on Demand (BoD) should be developed to handle
different classes of service over a satellite JP network similar to QoS
definitions developed by traffic management in satellite ATM networks [128,
129]. An example of this using Differentiated Services over a satellite JP
network is described
in Chapter II. The
interface
offered
should
be
independent of the technology, so that JP, acting at the upper layer, may use
the services. The MAC protocols providing guaranteed bandwidth could be
addressed either for bent pipe or onboard processing satellite network. [130]
Interaction between BoD and Transport layer protocols: To provide
system flexibility in terms of bandwidth allocation at the MAC layer and
supported by the upper layers using TCP protocol should be addressed . Very
little research is reported on achieving sufficient TCP throughputs for BoD
systems over satellite links. [131] provides performance of BoD in terms of
the TCP enhancements for a satellite network.
Interaction of BoD and network congestion: Even though traditional
TCP treats all errors as being due to congestion, several improvements have
been performed to take into account link impairments for satellite links. There
is a considerable capacity incompatibility in a backbone network and access
network. The network infrastructure which results in congestion points at the
access portion resulting in performance degradation. This issue needs to be
addressed for a proper selection and performance of BoD or bandwidth
allocation schemes.
Bandwidth
allocation
with fading:
In
multiservice
broadband
networks, to provide the desired level of performance under varying traffic
conditions, proper control mechanisms should be devised. In particular, for
satellite systems, dynamically varying fading conditions, caused by adverse
atmospheric
events
(e.g.,
rain, hail
or
snow)
can
heavily
affect
the
transmission quality, especially at Ka band. [132] has addressed the problem
of resource allocation with fading at the link layer.
6.3.6.1 Combined Free Demand Assignment Multiple Access (CFDAMA)
Bursty multimedia services contain real-time and non-real-time traffic
with diverse QoS requirements, peak-to-average ratios, and transfer durations.
Capacity needs to vary constantly during a call or connection. A dynamic
capacity allocation
scheme
which
can
handle
traffic
variations
while
providing good QoS and high channel utilization is needed for such traffic.

162
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
Combined Free DAMA (CFDAMA) scheme is suitable to support multimedia
traffic [133]. In CFDAMA, the scheduler can perform dynamic capacity
allocation every MF-TDMA frame. It first allocates capacity to user terminals
according to their demands and certain predefined priorities, similar to
DAMA. However, if unallocated resources remain available, CFDAMA will
freely allocate the remaining capacity to terminals according to a given
strategy. Since the free-assigned capacity can be available to terminals as the
traffic arrives, traffic can be instantaneously transmitted without making a
reservation. Hence, the setup phase is bypassed in this case and traffic is
transferred at a minimum of one hop, similar to random access but without the
reduced throughput caused by collisions.
Figure 6.7 illustrates the delay vs. utilization curves for a satellite
packet communications system
with 300 homogeneous equal-load user
terminals. The channel utilization represents the ratio of the average number
of successfully transmitted packets to the total number of time-frequency slots
available. At low and medium channel utilization, the free-assigned capacity
in CFDAMA allows
a majority
of packets to be transmitted without
reservation for short transfer times on the order of one round-trip delay. When
the traffic load increases, more packets are transmitted over demand-assigned
time-frequency slots with longer transfer times. This means, CFDAMA
provides both short transfer time equivalent to random access schemes at low
channel utilization, and high throughput equivalent to DAMA.

Thus CFDAMA can support different QoS requirements of bursty
multimedia traffic. For example, real-time stream-type traffic requiring no
delay-jitter can be supported by demand assigned capacity, while non-real-
time short messages can use free-assigned time-frequency slots for fast
transfer. Non-real-time jitter-tolerant traffic requiring no loss can be queued
and transmitted as fast as possible when allocation capacity is available.

7.2 SATELLITE IP
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
Satellite networks with onboard processing and switching capabilities
allow direct interconnection between satellite terminals located in any satellite
beam. Within a designated service coverage region, network management,
onboard switch control, service access, packet routing and forwarding and/or
label switching functions are accomplished by a distributed onboard resource
manager and ground based Network Control Center (NCC). There are many
issues for IP based networks and services, in particular, lack of proven robust
and scalable standard mechanisms for satellite networks [134]. These include :
â€¢
Dynamic allocation of resource optimized for packet loss and delay .
â€¢
Assuring that the required end-to-end network performance objectives
are achieved.
â€¢
Seamless signaling of the desired end-to-end QoS across both the
network and interfaces.
â€¢
Performance monitoring of IP based networks and services consistent
with planning method.
â€¢
Rapid and complete restoration of connectivity following severe
outages or heavy congestion levels.
This section describes traffic management, QoS mechanisms, issues
related with voice over JP, JP multicast, and security.
7.2.1 Satellite IP Traffic Management
Traffic management is required to deliver a negotiated QoS to
applications and to control congestion. Thus, critical or real-time application
traffic may be given better service at network nodes than less critical traffic.
In addition, congestion must be controlled to avoid performance degradation
and congestion collapse that occur when network buffers overflow and
packets are lost. The network load should not increase beyond a certain
optimal operating point, commonly
known
as the
knee of the
delay
throughput curves. Beyond this point, increasing the load level on the network
results in a remarkable increase in end-to-end delay caused by network
congestion and retransmissions. The following are the objectives of traffic
management.
â€¢
Fairness: Traffic sources should be treated according to some fairness
criteria like max-min fairness (with or without minimum guarantees)
or proportional fairness. Max-min fairness gives equal (or weighted
incase of weighted max-min fairness) shares to sources sharing a
common bottleneck. This means that the share of the constrained

Satellite TCP/IP: Technical Challenges
167
(min) sources is maximized, and excess resources are distributed
equally among unconstrained sources.
â€¢
Efficient Resource Utilization: The available resources e.g., network
buffers, network links bandwidths, processing capabilities, proxy
servers, should be efficiently utilized.
â€¢
Bounded Queuing Delay: Queuing delay should be small to guarantee
low end-to-end delay according to application QoS requirements, and
to ensure buffers do no overflow and cause excessive packet loss.
â€¢
Stability : Transmission rates of the sources should not fluctuate in
steady state.
â€¢
Fast Transient Response: Traffic sources should react rapidly to
changing network conditions like sudden congestion.
â€¢
Scalability: The traffic management algorithms must be scalable to
large numbers of users. Few million users are typical in satellite IP
networks.
7.2.1.1 Functions
The
various
traffic
management
functions
for
satellite
IP are
constrained routing (LEO and MEa constellations), connection admission
control,
policy control, and resource reservation
[135]. Once these are
accomplished,
traffic
shaping
and
policing,
scheduling,
and
buffer
management are required to control resource usage and provide QoS. Table
7.1 summarizes traffic management functions and the possible locating where
they will be performed e.g., gateway, terminal , payload and NCS.
Policy routing: Policy-based routing chooses paths conformant to
administrative rules and service agreements. With policy-based routing
schemes, administrators can base routing decisions not only on the destination
location but also on factors such as the applications, protocols used, size of
packets, or identity of end systems . Policy-based routing can provide cost
savings, load balancing, and basic QoS. Policy constraints are applied before
the application ofthe required QoS constraints.
QoS routing can be defined as a routing mechanism under which
paths for flows are determined based on some knowledge of resource
availability in the network as well as the QoS requirement of flows. It extends
the best-effort paradigm by finding alternate routes for forwarding flows that
cannot be admitted on the shortest existing path.
For time critical applications under heavy loads, buffer overflows and
queuing delays occur. Admission control determines whether the application

requirements are
met without degrading the existing connection
performance.

Policy control: Policy control dictates which users are allowed and
how many resources are reserved. Network managers and service providers
can monitor, control, and enforce network use based on policies.
Resource Reservation: Resource reservation protocols interact with
the admission control process and determine whether sufficient resources are
available to make the reservation. The protocols interact with the policy
control process to determine whether the user has permission to make the
reservation. If the reservation process gets acceptance indications from both
of them, it sends the appropriate parameter values to the packet classifier and
packet scheduler. The packet classifier determines the QoS class of packets
according to the requirements. The packet scheduler and buffer manager
manage various queues to guarantee the required QoS. Along with these,
other QoS mechanisms like InrServ, DiffServ, and MPLS-traffic engineering
provide QoS for different applications.

In a processing satellite network, functions like resource allocation
and policy routing can be accomplished in the onboard router. However, the
decision requires a trade off study depending on network
architecture
candidate.
7.2.2 QoS Mechanisms
QoS mechanisms provide service differentiation and performance
measures for Internet applications. Service differentiation provides different
services to different applications according to their requirements. Performance
assurance addresses bandwidth, loss, delay, and delay variation . Bandwidth is
a fundamental resource for satellite communication and its proper allocation
determines the system throughput. End-to-end delay is also important for
several applications. There are a variety of choices to provide the Internet
QoS. These are Integrated Services (IntServ) [136, 137], Differentiated
Services (DiffServ) [138, 139], and Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
[140,141]. However, the research of application of these QoS framework to
broadband satellite network is required. Research must also be done to
support IP QoS in a dynamic demand assignment capacity environment.
For QoS in a pure IP environment two mechanisms exist:
â€¢
Absolute QoS: Resources in the network elements are reserved and
allocated to provide hard, end-to-end, absolute QoS guarantees.
Typically this requires call admission, policing and shaping, which
can be done for aggregate flows, but in most cases, implies a per flow
resource allocation. A "flow" is equivalent to the five-tuple that
identifies
it
(transport
protocol,
source
address,
source
port,
destination address, destination port).
â€¢
Relative QoS: The network elements provide higher or lower priority
to certain traffic. Because of scalability issues, relative QoS typically
is not done on a per flow basis, but on a per aggregate basis. Different
flows that require the same QoS are aggregated in a limited number
of classes of service (CoS). A field inside the packet indicates to
which CoS the packet belongs, forcing the network element to give
the packet the QoS it deserves,
In this framework, for pure IP networks, two primary QoS models
exist: Integrated Services (IntServ) and Differentiated Services (DiffServ).
Integrated Services (IntServ) uses the Resource Reservation Protocol
(RSVP), a signaling protocol that can operate in native mode or encapsulated

170
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
mode within a UDP header. RSVP operates in tandem with either a TCP or
UDP flow to reserve resources among RSVP-enabled network elements.
Differentiated Services (DiffServ) provides a simple and coarse
method of categorizing traffic into CoS with assigned priorities. It uses a
value in the Type of Service (ToS) field in an IP header, now redefined as the
DiffServ byte, to identify how the packet will be forwarded, that is, its per hop
behavior (PHB).
Apart from the above Layer 3 techniques for pure IP networks, Layer
2 QoS mechanisms can be used. Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) is a
Layer 2 forwarding technique that allows traffic to circumvent the paths
calculated by Internet Gateway Protocols (IGPs), such as Open Shortest Path
First (OSPF) or Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS). The
MPLS framework can be used for QoS purposes in both IP and ATM
networks. ATM service classes are a common and a proven Layer 2 QoS
technique.
7.2.2.1 Best Effort
Best Effort is a single service model in which the delay requirements
are as soon as possible and the bandwidth requirements are as much as
possible. However, performance parameters are not guaranteed. Data is sent
in any quantity without first requesting permission or informing the network.
Figure 7.1 shows best effort service provided by First In First Out
(FIFO) queuing and tail-first dropping at the output port. Per output port, all
incoming flows are mapped into the same FIFO queue. The first packet to
enter the queue will be transmitted first. There is no mechanism to grant
certain packets a higher priority than others. When queue runs out of buffer
space, packets get dropped from certain flows. It is of no use to indicate the
requested performance for a subset of the total traffic (per flow, per
aggregated flow, per traffic type, etc.). The nodes can handle only equal
performance parameters for all traffic and cannot offer a distinct behavior to
different traffic subsets.

7.2.2.2 lutServ
171
IntServ is a multiple service model in which, before sending data, a
service with a well-defined traffic profile is requested from the network. The
IntServ architecture adds two service classes to the existing best-effort model
- guaranteed service and controlled load service. Guaranteed Service (GS)
[142] provides an upper bound on end-to-end queuing delay and is aimed to
support applications with hard real-time requirements. Controlled-Load (CL)
service [143] provides a QoS similar to best-effort service in an underutilized
network, with almost no loss and delay and is aimed to share the aggregate
bandwidth among multiple traffic streams in a controlled way under overload
conditions.
Data can be sent only after a confirmation is received. To indicate the
performance requirements and to reserve resources to guarantee QoS, the
signaling protocol Resource ReSerVation Protocol (RSVP) was designed.
IntServ uses RSVP to signal the QoS per flow and to reserve resources in the
nodes along the route between source and destination. In addition, traffic
control mechanisms are configured on the network elements to ensure that
each admitted flow is properly shaped. Users who ignore congestion signals
and try to utilize too much bandwidth cannot do so in CL or GS traffic classes
because nonconforming datagrams are treated as best effort traffic .

Figure 7.2: IntServ router
The topology of an IntServ node is depicted in figure 7.2. The nodes
are designed for making performance guarantees possible by implementing
multiple queues per output port in combination with scheduling and active
buffer (queue) management (i.e., packet discard mechanisms).
RSVP: In RSVP, the flow source sends a PATH message to the
intended flow receiver(s), specifying the characteristic of the traffic. Each
network router along the way records path characteristics such as available
bandwidth, as the PATH message propagates towards the receiver(s). Upon
receiving a PATH message, the receiver responds with a RESV message to
request resources along the path recorded in the PATH message in reverse
order from the sender to the receiver. If the request is accepted by all
intermediate routers, link bandwidth and buffer space are allocated for the
flow. The flow-specific state information is stored in the routers. Reservation
can be shared along branches of the multicast delivery trees. Figure 7.3 shows
the RSVP signaling mechanism between sender and receiver application
hosts.
Guaranteed Service
Guaranteed service [142] provides an assured level of bandwidth, a
firm end-to-end delay bound, and no queuing loss for conforming packets of a
data flow. It is intended for applications with stringent real-time delivery
requirements such as certain audio and video applications. Guaranteed service
really addresses the support of legacy applications that expect a delivery
model similar to traditional telecommunications circuits.
Each router characterizes the guaranteed service for a specific flow by
allocating a bandwidth R and buffer space B that the flow may consume
[144].

This is done by approximating the "fluid model" of service, so that
the flow effectively sees a dedicated wire of bandwidth R between the source
and receiver. In a perfect fluid model, a flow conforming to a token bucket of
rate r and depth b will have its delay bounded by b/R. provided R ~ r . To
allow
for
deviations
from
its
perfect
fluid
model
in
the
router's
approximation, two error terms, C and D, are introduced. These errors arise
from the finite packet sizes that are being dealt with. For example, any packet
may experience an excess delay as it is forwarded due to the size of the
packets in the same queue and due to inaccuracies in scheduling from packets
(of a possibly different size) in other queues bound for the output link. These
terms are derived for weighted fair queuing schedulers [144]. Consequently,
the delay bound now becomes b/R + C/R + D. With guaranteed service,
however, a limit is imposed on the peak rate p of the flow, which results in a
reduction of the delay bound. In addition, the packetization effect of the flow
needs to be taken into account by considering the maximum packet size M .
These additional factors result in a more precise bound on the end-to-end
queuing delay, Qde/a,l'as follows:

174
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
The terms CIIiI and DIIII
in equations 7.1 and 7.2 represent the
summation of the C and D error terms, respectively, for each router along the
end-to-end data path. In eq. 7.1, there are three delay terms, made from the
contributions of the burst of packets b (the bucket depth) sent at the peak rate
p and serviced at the output link rate R, plus the sum over all hops of errors
introduced at each hop due to a packet size worth of fluid flow approximation,
plus
a third
term
made
up of cross-traffic
scheduling approximation
contributions. In eq. 7.2, the first term is absent, since the link rate is greater
than the peak, so there are no packets queued from this flow itself.
For a router to invoke guaranteed service for a specific data flow, it
needs to be informed of the traffic characteristics of the flow (tspec) along
with the reservation characteristics (rspec). Furthermore, to enable the router
to calculate sufficient local resources to guarantee a lossless service requires
the terms CSUIII and
D'lIIII' which represent the summation of the C and D
error terms, respectively, for each router along the path since the last
reshaping point.
The tspec parameters include:
p
peak rate offlow (bytes/second);
b
bucket depth (bytes);
r
token bucket rate (bytes/second);
m
minimum policed unit (bytes);
M
maximum datagram size (bytes).
The rspec parameters include:
R
bandwidth, i.e., service rate (bytes/second);
S
slack term (ms).
Guaranteed service traffic must be policed at the network access
points to ensure conformance to tspec so that traffic does not interfere with
other flows and cause them to miss their contract.
Controlled Load Service
Controlled load service [143] provides approximately the same QoS
under heavy loads as under light loads. The important difference from the
traditional best effort service is that the controlled
load flow does not
noticeably deteriorate as the network load increases. This service is intended
for those classes of applications that can tolerate a certain amount of loss or
delay, provided it is kept to a reasonable level. Examples of applications in
this category include adaptive real-time applications. It can adapt to modest

175
end-to-end delay variations and jitter. It is not suited for applications that
require very low latency.

Using IntServ/RSVP can provide absolute service guarantees, but
several
weaknesses
prevent
the

of RSVP.
A
substantial amount of per-flow processing must take place in each node. This
includes end-to-end signaling, and information to identify the flow, track and
bill the resource consumption, police traffic beyond the reservation, and
schedule the traffic according to the requested performance. Especially, in the
core, where millions of flows exist and are simultaneously being set up or
taken down, the overhead is unacceptable.
Up to 50 percent of Internet traffic consists of flows with holding
times of only a few seconds. IntServ is highly inefficient regarding these
short-lived flows, where the overhead of reservation is higher than the
processing ofthe packets in the flow.
7.2.2.3 DiffServ
DiffServ, unlike IntServ, does not require the network to explicitly
signal per flow before data is sent. In contrast to the per-flow behavior of
IntServ, DiffServ delivers a particular service on a per-packet basis. DiffServ
packets are classified into a small number (maximum 64) of aggregate flows
or classes, called Behavior Aggregates (BA). [145]

176
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
The manner in which a router forwards a BA packet is called a Per-
Hop Behavior (PHB). Currently, three PHBs are standardized: Expedited
Forwarding (EF), Assured Forwarding (AF), and Best Effort (BE). EF offers
low loss, low latency, and low jitter for an aggregated flow. It is particularly
useful
for Internet telephony, video conferencing or virtual
leased
line
services. AF is intended for customers who need predictable services, even in
times of congestion (The extent of predictability is defined by the operator).
Within each AF class, three levels of drop precedence can be assigned. No
distinction is.made between packets in a best effort queue; all packets have
the same probability of being dropped.
Membership in a class is indicated by the DiffServ codepoint (DSCP)
in the packet's IP header. At each router, packets are subjected to a PHB
according to the class to which they belong. It is the ISP's responsibility to
decide what services to support and to assign the corresponding DSCP.
Different ISPs can implement different DSCPs, therefore, a mapping of
DSCPs must take place at their borders.
The building blocks as shown in figure 7.2 is valid for DiffServ,
except that the granularity is per aggregate instead of per flow as it is for
IntServ. Logically represented, each class can be depicted by a queue as
shown in figure 7.5. The PHB at each node is implemented according to the
same mechanisms used in IntServ nodes (Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ),
Weighted Random Early Detection (WRED), etc.).

Figure 7.5: DifJServ node offers scalable differentiation through aggregation in a limited

DiffServ pushes complexity to the network boundary and separates
policy and supporting mechanisms [146]. By pushing complexity to the
network boundary i.e., the application hosts, leaf routers and edge routers,
packet classification and traffic conditioning can be performed at fine
granularity at the network boundary as it has relatively small number of flows.

SatelliteTCP/IP: Technical Challenges
177
Network core routers have larger number of flows and so should perform fast
and simple operations. This improves scalability.
DiffServ provides two service models besides best effort model -
Premium service and Assured service. Premium service is a guaranteed peak
rate service, which is optimized for very regular traffic patterns and offers
small or no queuing delay. It provides absolute QoS assurance. Assured
service is based on statistical provisioning. It tags packets as In or Out
according to their service profiles. If packets are needed to be dropped, those
marked Out are dropped first. This service provides relative QoS assurance
and can be used to build "Olympic Service" which as gold, silver, and bronze
service levels.

Figure 7.6: Functions ofDifJServ
Figure 7.6 shows some of the DiffServ functions to be performed at
the routers - marking, classifying, policing, queuing, and shaping.
Service Profiles: A service profile indicates which traffic is to be
treated differently and what type of service is requested. The former may be
indicated by setting a packet filter based on packet header fields such as IP
addresses. The latter can be specified using a token bucket filter (a rate and a
burst size), along with some delay requirements. The service profile is likely
to be set up administratively, although it is technically possible to use RSVP
messages to set up profiles as well.

178
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
Packet Classification: The ingress router must check all received
packets against the service profiles it has to check if the packets should
receive differential treatment. It may use packet filters to match packet
headers and token filters to check conformance to the profile. Packets that do
not meet profiles can either be discarded or sent into the network with higher
drop precedence, depending on the nature of service to be provided.
Packet Marking: The ingress router must also mark the packets as
they enter the network with appropriate values so interior routers can handle
the packets differentially. The marking can use header fields. For example, for
IPv4 packets, the TOS octet can be used. This has 3 bits for IP Precedence
and 4 bits for Type of Service.

Figure 7.7: DifJServ fi eld fo rmat
Figure 7.7 shows DiffServ (OS) field format. OSCP selects the
service the packet will receive at every OiffServ capable intermediate node. It
reuses the IPv4 ToS field. OSCP has 6 bits resulting in 64 possible code
points. 2 bits in the OS field are yet to be defined .
The primary benefit of OiffServ it its scalability, since it eliminates
the need for per flow state and processing. Service is allocated at the
granularity of a class, so the amount of state information is proportional to the
number of classes. Incremental deployment is possible. DiffServ-incapable
routers simply ignore the OSCP of the packets and give them best effort
service.
Chapter 11 presents OiffServ based TCP and UOP simulations for

7.2.2.4 MPLS
As discussed
in Chapter 1, MPLS is believed to combine the
characteristics of both
ATM
and
IP technologies
and
address
many
architectural e.g., signaling and QoS provisioning methods. This could be
considered as a suitable candidate providing high-bandwidths for future
satellite network backbones.

Satellite TCP/IP: Technical Challenges
179
Normal IP datagram forwarding decisions are based on the longest
prefix match in the unicast table of the destination address found in the
header. MPLS is a packet forwarding scheme, where forwarding decisions are
based on a fixed match in the MPLS table of a short label, which is generally
part of the MPLS header. The route taken through the network by all packets
with the same MPLS label is called a Label Switched Path (LSP). This route
is set up by the RSVP and/or LOP or Constraint Based Routing Label-
Distributed Protocol (CR-LDP) signaling protocol. A Label Switch Router
(LSR) is a router that is capable of transmitting traffic along an LSP, i.e., an
MPLS-capable router . [147]
The LSP ingress node (the node where the LSP starts) uses filters to
select the packets that are to be sent on a particular LSP, and the filter action
puts the correct MPLS header in front of the packet. At the egress LSP node
(the node where the LSP ends), the MPLS header is removed and the packet is
again
forwarded
using
longest
prefix
match.
A
label
has only
local
significance. Therefore, at a transit node on an LSP, each forwarding table
entry specifies how to progress the packet as well as the outgoing label. This
concept is called label swapping, and is similar to the forwarding used in
ATM. An LSP is very similar to an ATM virtual circuit.
Figure 7.8 shows an MPLS label and an example of a basic MPLS
forwarding table .

7.2.3 Voice over IP
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
Starting in 1995, Voice over IP (VoIP) has seen tremendous growth
in the past few years in terms of technology and commercial applications.
Two key factors have contributed to the growth of VoIP. The first is the
explosive growth of the Internet and other IP-based networks; the second is
the trend to merge voice networks with data networks. With the emergence of
new multimedia applications, it is a logical step to use one single network to
carry voice, data, and multimedia applications. [148]
Satellite links, as an integral part of the global communications
infrastructure, are already used to provide IP-based data services, especially to
remote regions in developing countries where terrestrial communications
infrastructure is scarce or even nonexistent, and as backups for terrestrial links
in more developed areas. Hence, as in the case of terrestrial networks,
integration of voice and data services is inevitable in satellite links as well. In
fact, several Internet Telephony Service Providers (lTSPs) have already
announced the inclusion of satellite links in their networks. Furthermore, a
number of new satellite systems are being developed to provide high-speed
Internet access to businesses and home users. These systems are expected to
include VoIP as one of their service offerings.
Earlier work on VoIP has focused on development of network
architectures
and
protocols
for
VoIP,
interworking
with
PSTN
and
mobile/cellular networks, service management, and quality of service (QoS)
provisioning based on the evolving Internet QoS architecture. In this section,
the performance of VoIP over satellite under various link and loading
conditions is described .
Satellite link characteristics were simulated by a channel simulator. A
central office switch simulator was used to establish up to 24 telephone
connections and transmit prerecorded voice files over the IP link. Tests were
conducted with link delay, link errors, and various link loading levels to
evaluate the performance of VoIP over satellite. Test results show that
satellite links provide a reliable medium for VoIP transport. [148, 149]
Protocol Standards
Data transmission and voice transmission over packet-based networks
have a major difference in requirements: data are loss-sensitive and delay-
tolerant, while voice is loss-tolerant and delay-sensitive. For this reason, the
transport layer in the VoIP protocol stack uses the User Datagram Protocol
(UDP) to carry voice instead of the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

SatelliteTCP/IP: Technical Challenges
181
TCP is used to carry signaling messages such as call setup and teardown. In
addition, since most VoIP applications are real-time, the Real-Time Transport
Protocol (RTP) is run on top of UDP to provide end-to-end delivery services
for data with real-time characteristics. These services include payload type
identification, sequence numbering, timestamping, and delivery monitoring.
[150]
The main VoIP standard is ITU-T Recommendation H.323 [151],
which
was
designed
for
multimedia
communications
systems
and
is
considered bulky for simpler voice applications. As a result, the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) was developed within the IETF as an alternative
protocol offering less complexity and more flexibility. Both H.323 and SIP
are peer-to-peer protocols. Taking another approach to controlling telephony
gateways, the Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) assumes a call
control architecture where the call control intelligence is outside the gateways
and handled by external call control elements, and hence is a master/slave
protocol. The MGCP is a combination of two earlier protocols, the Simple
Gateway Control Protocol (SGCP) and the Internet Protocol Device Control
(IPDC), which were introduced by Telcordia and Level 3, respectively.
All
next-generation
VoIP
gateways
(also
known
as
mediation
devices) support at least one of the newer protocols (SIP, SGCP, IPDC, or
MGCP). However, H.323 is by far the most widely supported protocol suite in
VoIP platforms since it was the first VoIP standard that became available.
H.323
specifies
the
technical
requirements
for
multimedia
communications systems
in packet-based
networks
such
as
local area
networks, enterprise area networks, metropolitan area networks, intranets, and
Internet. It supports G.711, G.722, G.723.1, G.728, and G.729 for audio
codecs; H.261 and H.263 for optional video codecs; and H.245 and H.225.0
for control and signaling functions. [150]
Issues
VoIP issues are interoperability and QoS. The existence of several
standards creates the problem of interoperability. Gateways from different
vendors may not be able to communicate with each other not only because
they support different standards,
but also because many vendors have
proprietary solutions that may yield better performance than standardized
techniques. Another important issue in VoIP is QoS. The best effort service
available in IP networks today is not sufficient to provide VoIP service
comparable to the traditional PSTN service in reliability and voice quality.
Hence, certain service-level guarantees are needed. So far, IETF standards
such as RSVP and DiffServ are promising in IP QoS support, and a number of

182
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
VoIP gateway vendors have implemented them in their products. However, a
significant amount ofwork still remains to be done in this area.
Applications
VoIP applications include:
â€¢
Toll bypass: Routing long-distance calls through IP-based networks
can reduce the cost significantly, especially for international calls.
â€¢
Call center integration: Call centers usually use one voice link to talk
to customers and one data link to retrieve information from databases.
Using VoIP, these two links can be combined into a single cost-
saving link. Furthermore, customers can go to the Web to find
information and make calls to the call center from the Web page
(click-to-talk).
â€¢
Unified messaging: This application allows users to receive/retrieve
various forms of messaging (voice, e-mail, fax, etc.) at a single access
point.
â€¢
IP videoconferencing: This application can help businesses reduce the
costs of conferencing.
â€¢
Corporate intranets: Many compan ies today
have two separate
networks, one for voice and one for data. These two networks can be
integrated into one using IP telephony, reducing infrastructure and
administration costs.
Performance
For VoIP over satellite, several issues need to be addressed . These
consist of transmission and QoS issues, service-related issues such as service
creation and customization, support of IN and supplementary services, and
seamless integration with PSTN. In [150], performance results of laboratory
experiments for evaluating VoIP over satellite under different link and traffic
conditions are presented. The observations made in the experiment are:
â€¢
Voice frame loss is higher than IP packet loss because it occurs not
only when IP packets are dropped in the routers, but also when an IP
packet gets discarded for arriving at the destination too late to be used
by the voice decoder.
â€¢
Measured link loading is less at higher BERs since background TCP
traffic slows down while VoIP traffic remains constant.
â€¢
At lower BERs, more voice frame loss is caused by delay variation
(i.e., late packets) than by errors (i.e., packets dropped in the routers).
The reverse holds true at higher BERs.
â€¢
Background TCP connections break down at BER around 10-5â€¢

Satellite TCP/IP: Technical Challenges
â€¢
Both VoIP and TCP connections fail at BER around 10-4â€¢
183
The standard deviation in the packet delay statistics of the experiment
is larger at lower link errors. This is because at lower link errors, background
traffic throughput is higher, resulting in a higher link loading level and more
competition for the link bandwidth.
It is concluded from the experimental results that satellite links
provide a robust medium for transporting VoIP traffic . Under errored link
conditions, VoIP operation can tolerate BERs up to 10-5â€¢
7.2.4 Satellite IP Security
The challenge of security in GEO satellite environments is one of the
main
issues to be addressed for widespread deployment of satellite IP
multicast
and
multimedia
applications.
The
main
problem
is
that
eavesdropping and active intrusion is much easier than in terrestrial fixed or
mobile networks because of the broadcast nature of satellites. In addition,
satellite channels experience long delays and high bit error rates, which may
cause the loss of security synchronization. This demands a careful evaluation
of encryption systems to prevent QoS degradation because of security
processing. The following paragraphs briefly describe IP Security for satellite
network.
The IETF provided security standards for the Internet known as IP
Security (IPSec) [152]. The basic concepts involved are:
â€¢
Authentication: Two communicating parties know that the data at the
destination is the same as when it was initially sent (data integrity)
and that the sender is not impersonated by third party (data origin
authentication).
â€¢
Integrity: Data
is not allowed
to be unmatched at source and
destination for two parties.
â€¢
Confidentiality: Data
is protected during transmission from the
content being known to third party.
â€¢
Security
Agreement
(SA):
An
agreement
between
two
communication parties on knowing and using certain combination of
security mechanisms for data transmission between them. It is based
on the destination address and Security Parameters Index (SPI).
There are two specific headers that can be attached to IP packet to
achieve security. They are the IP Authentication Header (AH) and IP
Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) header.

184
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
A Security Association (SA) is needed for both the implementation of
the ESP header and AH. An SA consists of the destination address and
Security Parameter Index (SPI). The SPI at least contains the algorithm,
algorithm mode and the keys used with the algorithm. In the ESP header case,
certain
sizes
for determining
synchronization
and
initialization of the
encryption/decryption algorithm are also needed for the SPI. The SPI also
contains sensitivity level of data for systems meant to provide multi-level
security. The sending host uses the sending userid and destination address to
select a SA. The receiving host uses SPI value and destination address to
distinguish the association.
Authentication Header (AH)
AH can provide security (connectionless data integrity and data origin
authentication) to IP datagram. The implementation can be host-host, host-
gateway or gateway-gateway. Host-host implementation is preferred because
if security ends at gateway, there is a possibility that security attacks arise at
untrusted hosts. Confidentiality protection is not provided by the AH header.
AH header holds authentication information for its IP datagram. It
achieves this by computing a cryptographic authentication function over the
IP datagram and using a secret authentication key in the computation. The
sender computes the authentication data, i.e., the Integrity Check Value,
before it sends the authenticated IP packets. Fragmentation occurs after the
appending of AH header to outgoing packets and before the stripping of AH
header for incoming packets. The receiver rematches the authentication data
upon reception. Fields which change along the path (e.g., TTL (time to live)
field which is decremented on each hop) are omitted from the authentication
calculation.

Figure 7.9 shows the AH header in an IP datagram. A value of 51 for
the protocol field in IP header indicates, AH header is included in the
datagram.
AH header can be used in transport mode or tunnel mode. In transport
mode, AH header is appended before the IP header of an IP datagram and is
only used for end-to-end implementation. Only higher-layer protocols and

Satellite TCP/IP: Technical Challenges
185
selected IP header fields are protected . In tunnel mode, AH header is inserted
after IP header and before a higher-layer protocol. In this mode, the entire IP
header and IP packet are protected. For gateway security implementation,
tunnel mode is required.
Encapsulation Security Protocol (ESP) Header
ESP header provides integrity, authentication, and confidentiality to
IP datagrams. It does this by encapsulating either an entire datagram or only
the higher layer protocol data inside the ESP, encrypting most of the ESP
content, and then appending a new IP header to the now encrypted ESP
payload.
This
new
IP header
carries
the
protected
data
through
the
internetwork.
The ESP header can be implemented in tunnel mode (entire IP
datagram is encapsulated within the ESP header) or transport mode (a higher-
layer protocol is encapsulated inside ESP and a new IP header appended). The
encapsulating security used by ESP can impact network performance in
systems establishing SA but does not impact routers or other intermediate
systems that are not in ESP security association. Protocol processing in
participating
systems
is
more
complex.

Figure 7.10: ESP header
The ESP header may be used in combination with AH header for
requested security. The AH header provides connectionless integrity and data
origin authentication. ESP header provides integrity and confidentiality.
Adding AH header to IP datagram and then encapsulating that datagram using
the
ESP
header
can
provide
strong
integrity,
authentication,
and
confidentiality as. shown in figure 7.10. When the two mechanisms are
combined, the positioning of the IP AH header ensures which part of the data
is being authenticated.

186
Key Management
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
The key management protocol is related to AH header and ESP
header only by the SPI. Key distribution can manual or automated. Currently,
most security systems are manually configured with their own keys and also
with the keys of other communicating systems. Automated Key Distribution
requires an Internet-standardscalable key managementprotocol.
Keying approaches for IP include host-oriented keying and user-
oriented keying. For host-oriented keying, users on one host share the same
key on outgoing traffic destined for all users on another host. Integrity and
confidentiality can be provided when dynamic key management techniques
and certain algorithms are in use. In user-oriented keying, one user has one or
more keys (not shared with other users on the same host) for its outbound
traffic destined for another host with the SA associated.
Constraints on use of IPSec
â€¢
Originally configured for unicast. Multicast integrated for IPSec over
IPv6.
â€¢
H'Sec ESPtolerates no modification of the Layer4 headers.
â€¢
ESP has different levels of encryption, which can change from a
country to another. For security level to be same irrespective of
location of users or gateways, agreement on the usage of ESP
between standardization bodiesneeded.
â€¢
Intunnel mode, IPSecconfiguration is assumed to be static.
Possible Solutions
Option 1: Multi layer IPSec
Figure 7.11 shows the structure of multilayer IPSec. IP datagram is
divided into TCP header and TCP data. TCP data part uses an end-to-end
protection with keys shared only between source and destination either end
hosts or IPSec gateways. TCP header part uses separate protection scheme
with keys shared among source, destination, and certain trusted intermediate
node (that performs TCPPEP). Limited access to IP datagram contents to
network operators and service providers must be granted in a secure and
controllableway. [153]

This is a good solution for the security using different zones and
combination of keys for every zone. IPSec protects layers above IP layer. But
most useful information is kept in the TCP layer or higher for optimization of
Internet traffic . For normal router in Internet, all parties must exchange keys,
which is a problem.
â€¢
By changing spontaneously the route way, which is normal for
Internet, keys must be exchanged with the new gateways. This will
decrease Quality of Service.
â€¢
A large database space is needed for keys since through one gateway
flow many connections for many users and every connection or user
must exchange a key.
â€¢
In heterogeneous network such as Internet,
software should be
installed on every proxy/gateway server. Software is needed for
different platforms.
â€¢
The gateway must decrypt every packet.
â€¢
Networking
monitoring:

â€¢

Option 2: Clear rcp Header
Another approach could be use of clear TCP header. If high speed is
required,
TCP
header
can
be
authenticated
but
not
encrypted.
If
confidentiality is required, for example, TCP session splitting proxy services
must not be used; this reduces performance. Inserting another field in IPSec
header
â€¢
Can be used to specify the number bytes after the header the
encryption should begin.
â€¢
Can be set to 0 for high confidentiality; will function as standard
IPSec
â€¢
Can be set to appropriate values to make TCP or higher layer headers
visible for better performance.

7.2.5 Satellite IP Multicast
In addition to the traditional large data transfers with best effort
services over the Internet, future multimedia including real-time applications
require QoS
support and security as discussed . in Section
7.2.4.
The
asymmetric nature of satellite communication has been exploited to provide
satellite IP multicast support over high speed Internet. [154]
Multicast allows a source node to send data simultaneously to all the
members interested in receiving the data. To successfully distribute content
via IP multicast, the following
elements must be addressed
within the
network: (a) define group address format, (b) allocate group addresses, (c)
dynamically define group memberships, (d) Determine the routes, and (e)
forward the packet. The Internet Group Membership Protocol (IGMP) version
2 (RFC 2236) allows a host to join/leave a multicast group by signaling a
local router on its subnet.

Satellite TCP/IP: Technical Challenges
7.2.5.1 Multicast Routing Protocols
189
Similar to
unicast
routing
protocols e.g.,
Routing
Information
Protocol (RIP) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol, multicast
routing protocols within
multicast
routers
determine where to forward
multicast messages. Multicast routing protocols are Distance Vector Multicast
Routing
Protocol
(DVMRP),
Multicast
Extensions to OSPF
(MOSPF)
protocol, and Protocol Independent Multicast -
Dense Mode (PIM-DM)
protocol which are more
efficient in situations where
multicast group
members are densely distributed over the network, and Protocol Independent
Multicast - Spare Mode (PIM-SM) protocol which performs better when
group members are sparsely distributed.
Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP): DVMRP
[155] is based on RIP. The difference is that RIP forwards unicast packets
based on the information about the next-hop towards a destination while
DVMRP constructs delivery trees based on the information on the previous-
hop back to the source. DVMRP constructed delivery trees based on Reverse
Path Multicasting (RPM). The first packet of multicast messages sent from a
particular source to a particular multicast group
is flooded
across the
internetwork. Then, prune messages are used to truncate the branches, which
do not lead to a group member. Furthermore, a new type of message is used to
quickly graft back a previously pruned branch of a delivery tree in case a new
host on that branch joins the multicast group. Similar to prune messages,
which are forwarded hop by hob, graft messages are sent back one hop at a
time until they reach a node, which is on a multicast delivery tree. Similar to
RPM, DVMRP still implements the flooding of packet periodically.
Multicast Extensions to OSPF (MOSPF): MOSPF [156] are built on
top of OSPF version 2. MOSPF uses the group membership information
obtained through IGMP and with the help of OSPF database builds multicast
delivery trees. These trees are shortest-path trees constructed (on demand) for
each (source, group) pair. Although MOSPF does not support tunnels, it can
coexist
and
interoperate
with
non-MOSPF
routers .
MOSPF
supports
hierarchical routing. All hosts in the Internet are partitioned into some
Autonomous System (AS) . Each AS is further divided into subgroups called
'areas' .
Protocol-Independent Multicast (PIM): PIM routing protocols require
the existence of a unicast routing protocol. The major proposed and used
multicast protocols perform well if group members are densely packed .
However, DVMRP and MOSPF are inefficient in regions where group
members are sparsely distributed and bandwidth is not abundant because
DVMRP
periodically
floods
the
network
and
MOSPF
sends
group

190
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
membership information over the links. PIM has two protocols to address
these issues -
PIM-Oense Mode (PIM-OM) for densely distributed group
members and PIM-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM), which is more efficient when
group members are sparsely distributed. Though these algorithms belong to
PIM and share similar control messages, they are two different protocols
essentially.
PIM-OM is similar to OVMRP and uses RPM algorithm for forming
delivery trees. Although PIM-OM requires the presence of a unicast routing
protocol for finding routes back to the source node, it is independent of the
mechanisms employed by any specific unicast routing protocol. This is not
the case with
OVMRP and MOSPF
protocols.
OVMRP uses RIP-like
exchange messages to build its unicast routing table, and MOSPF relies on
OSPF link state database.
PIM-SM [157] has two key differences with the above mentioned
dense-mode
protocols. In PIM-SM
protocol
routers
need to explicitly
announce their will for receiving multicast messages of multicast groups,
while dense-mode protocols assume that all routers need to receive multicast
messages unless they explicitly send a prune message. The other difference is
that PIM-SM uses the concept of "core" or "rendezvous point" (RP).
7.2.5.2 Satellite IP Multicast
The key advantages of IP multicast are reduced transmission from the
source benefiting the content provider and reduced load within the transport
network benefiting the service provider. Satellite networks can perform
multicast better than any other medium due to its fundamental characteristics
of broadcasting/multicasting. This advantage will be further enhanced with
onboard switching systems providing an optimal use of the resources.
Figure 7.14 shows IP multicasting over satellite. The requirements for
multicast over satellite include efficient bandwidth
utilization, dynamic
joining and leaving of a network node, minimal control overhead, high return
channel bandwidth , and security. Multicast over satellite has the following
design issues:
â€¢
Multicast gateway/multicast hybrid
gateway
can
implement
the
multicast protocols.
â€¢
Switching nodes can implement modified reliable multicast protocols
or multicast over satellite protocols.
â€¢
Adaptive routing protocols are to be designed.
â€¢
Satellite motion must be taken into account

were:

algorithms, (b) interaction between BoD and transport layer protocols, (c)
interaction of BoD and network congestion, and (d) bandw idth allocation with
fading. These issues are discussed in Section 6.3.6. A study of the CRA,
RBDC, VBDC, and FCA allocation schemes in terms of application and QoS
parameters mapping is essential.

7.2.6.2 Mapping between PHB and Bandwidth Allocation Schemes
One of the functions ofthe user terminal's MAC management module
is to calculate the capacity requests. In order to do this, a mapping is required
between the DiffServ PHS's and the DVS-RCS capacity categories.
The
characteristics of these categories must be considered in order to devise a
mapping that satisfies the requirements of the DiffServ PHS's.
The Expedited Forwarding (EF) PHS requires a bandwidth guarantee
and is typically used to provide a low-loss, low-latency and low-jitter service.
EF traffic
tends to be smooth and CRA is a good match for these
requirements. RSDC may be used to supplement the CRA but should not be
used
alone
because
the
scheduling lag required
to
obtain
an
RBDC
assignment conflicts with the low-latency requirement. The reason for using
RBDC to supplement CRA is that RBDC capacity costs less; users may
accept the delay and delay variation involved in obtaining RBDC capacity in
exchange for lower-cost service.
The Assured Forwarding (AF) PHS group also requires a bandwidth
guarantee but there are no delay and jitter constraints.
AF traffic may be
bursty. RBDC is a good match for these requirements: it offers a bandwidth
guarantee and can efficiently handle bursty traffic because RBOC is assigned
dynamically in response to explicit requests from the UT.
VBOC may be

194
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
used to supplement RBDC;
since VBDC
does
not offer a bandwidth
guarantee, there is once again a tradeoff between service quality and cost.
The Default (DE) PHB has no requirements of any kind. It should
not be mapped exclusively to FCA, however, to avoid starving the DE traffic
in situations when network load precludes FCA.
Due to this possibility of
starvation, the DVB-RCS standard specifies that no traffic class should be
mapped to FCA.
Consequently, DE traffic should be mapped to VBDC,
possibly with an FCA component. Table 7.2 summarizes the mappings of
DiffServ PHB to DVB-RCS capacity allocation schemes . As already noted, a
DiffServ PHB may be mapped to multiple capacity categories, in which case a
distribution between categories must be specified (e.g., EF may be mapped to
80% CRA and 20% RBDC).
Table 7.2: Possible mappings ofDiffServ PHBs to DVB-RCS capacity categories
7.2.6.3 Security
In Digital Video Broadcast (DVB), two levels of security can be
applied: (1) DVB common scrambling, (2) Individual user scrambling in the
forward and return link. Security can also be applied in the application,
transport and network layers. Link level security is desirable by satellite
access network operators to secure satellite links and provide their clients with
data confidentiality. For DVB, the satellite interactive network forward link is
based on DVB/MPEG-(Transport Stream) TS standard . The security concept
shown in figure 7.17 can be found in [43].

7.3 SATELLITE TCP
Most of the global and regional satellite network architectures address
supporting Internet applications. TCP/IP is the most widely used protocol
suite accessing the Internet. The main characteristics of the end-to-end path
that affects transport protocols are latency, bandwidth, packet loss due to
congestion, and losses due to transmission error links. Recently, anumber of
researchers have addressed this issue of TCP enhancements for satellite or
large
bandwidth
delay
environment
[158].
Excellent
surveys
on
TCP
enhancements and their applicability for wireless and satellite networks can
be found in [47,159,160,161,162,163,164,165,166,167,168,169,170].
In this
section, an overview of the
link characteristics affecting TCP
performance under satellite environment is provided. The TCP protocols for
satellite networks recommended by the IETF and the recent research on the
alternative transport protocols are discussed. The principle of the Performance
Enhancement Proxies (PEPs) and the implementation issues are described.
Some test results using PEPs over satellite links are provided.
7.3.1 Satellite Link Characteristics Affecting TCP
An overview of the characteristics affecting TCP is given below.
Latency: Among the three components of latency, propagation delay,
transmission delay and queuing delay, propagation delay is the dominant part
in broadband satellite links. In case of LEO satellites the propagation delay

196
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
will vary, the connection path may change, and the queuing delay may be
significant. Large variations of round trip time (RTT) may lead to false
timeouts and transmissions. A long RTT, in excess of 500 ms for GEO
satellite networks, does not allow for quick feedback to the sender. This can
reduce the rate of increase of the transmission rate, as well as the maximum
transmission
rate at the
sender since
TCP
is self-clocking, based
on
acknowledgements. Furthermore, the sender's retransmission timeout value
must reflect the long RTT. As a result, retransmission delays can be longer
and
reduces
throughput.
In addition,
the
variable
delays
in
a
LEO
configuration from a few to about 80 ms could affect the accuracy of TCP
RTT and timeout estimations, which in turn impacts the TCP performance.
Link
Impairments:
Satellite
systems
are
subject
to
various
impairments including multipath, interference, fading, rain attenuation and
shadowing.
Even
though
advanced
modulation
and
adaptive
coding
techniques help to improve the normal BER of the order of 10.10, normal
satellite networks experience higher bit-error rate than terrestrial networks.
TCP cannot distinguish between a segment loss due to congestion and a loss
due to bit errors. Consequently, the sender wiII reduce itstransm ission rate
even when segments are lost because of bit errors. This is an erroneous course
of action since congestion may not exist in the network. Satellite networks can
at times have a higher BER than terrestrial networks and so the assumptions
of the congestion control algorithm can further reduce the throughput over
satellites. [171]
Bandwidth Asymmetry:
In broadband
satellite
access
networks
bandwidth asymmetry in terms of forward to the return channels exist
anywhere in the order of 10:I or more. Network asymmetry affects the
performance of TCP because the protocol relies on feedback in the form of
cumulative acknowledgments from the receiver to ensure reliability. TCP uses
the arrival rate of ACKs on the reverse time to control the flow of packets in
the forward direction. For example a low bandwidth acknowledgment path
can significantly slow the growth of the TCP sender window during slow start
independent of forward link bandwidth. Thus bottlenecks or congestion in the
reverse direction can lead to poor channel utilization in the forward direction.
Bi-directional traffic flow may also exaggerate the problems of asymmetric
channel bandwidth since ACKs must compete for bandwidth with traffic
flows in the return direction.
Multiple Segment Loss: The bandwidth*delay product defines the
maximum
amount
of
data
that
can
be
in-flight
(transmitted
but
unacknowledged). In connections with a large bandwidth*delay product, such
as geostationary satellite networks, TCf' senders and receivers with limited
congestion/receive windows will not be able to take advantage of the
bandwidth that is available. Those that can take advantage also increase their

Satellite TCP/IP: Technical Challenges
197
probability of a multiple segment loss within a single window . A multiple
segment loss is a fundamental issue with TCP performance.
RTT Fairness: Because the TCP algorithm is self-clocking, based on
received ACKs, several connections sharing the same bottleneck may see
their clocks running at different speeds. A long RTT connection will not be
able to increase its congestion window as quickly as a short RTT connection.
The short RTT connection will unfairly capture a larger portion of the
network bandwidth as a result. This is particularly true in the presence of
congestion and subsequent loss, where the congestion window is opened
linearly based on the RTT of the connection. Moreover, the congestion
window of long RTT connections has "farther to go" before the optimal value
is reached due to the large bandwidth*delay product. This further limits the
throughput of long RTT connections through the bottleneck, as compared to
shorter RTT connections.
The RTT for GEO satellite is more than 500 ms which is the time it
takes for a TCP sender to determine whether or not a packet has been
successfully received at the destination . This delay hurts some of TCP
congestion control algorithms as described in the following .

Over the years, a number of TCP flavors have been proposed and/or
implemented. The baseline TCP protocol (TCP Reno) specifies Slow Start,
Congestion Avoidance, Fast Retransmit and Fast Recovery for congestion
control. The TCP protocol cannot distinguish the performance degradation
caused by link errors and congestion . It assumes that any loss in the network
is due to congestion only and the sender responds by reducing its packet
transfer rate.
The TCP protocol uses window flow control mechanism in which, the
transmission window allows the receiving TCP to control the amount of data
is being sent to it at any given time. The receiver advertises a window size to
the sender. The window measures, in bytes, the amount of unacknowledged
data that the sender can have in transit to the receiver.
7.3.2.1 Bandwidth-Delay Product
The bandwidth-delay product (BOP) defines the amount of data a
TCP connection should have "in flight" (data that has been transmitted, but
not yet acknowledged) at any time to fully utilize the channel available
capacity. The delay used in this case is the RTT and the bandwidth is the

198
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
capacity of the bottleneck link in the path. Because the RTT for GEO
satellites is large and higher bandwidth links are required, TCP will need to
keep a large number of packets sent but not yet acknowledged. [47]
In connections with a large BOP, such as GEO satellite networks,
TCP senders and receivers with limited congestion/receive windows will not
be able to take advantage of the available bandwidth. The standard maximum
TCP
window of 65,535 bytes is not adequate to allow a single TCP
connection to
utilize the
entire
bandwidth available on some
satellite
channels. In a loss-free network the TCP throughput is limited by the
following formula:
Max throughput = window size/RTT
(7.3)
Therefore, when using the maximum TCP window size of 65,535
bytes and a GEO satellite link with RTT of 560 ms the maximum throughput
is limited to:
Max throughput = 65,535 bytes/560 ms = 117,027 bytes/second
So, a single standard TCP connection cannot fully utilize, for example
a TI rate GEO channel. Table 7.3 shows the maximum RTT in order to be
able to use a given bandwidth with a single TCP connection using the
maximum window size 64KB.

In general, TCP flows share the satellite bandwidth and even if a
single flow is not able to utilize the channel capacity, the other flows might be
able to do so. Another problem related to the high BOP is the stability ofTCP
congestion control schemes. As BOP increases, active queue management
schemes including Random Early Detection (RED), Random Early Marking
(REM), and Virtual Queue, eventually become prone to instability, which
leads to lower performance.

7.3.2.2 Slow Start and Congestion Avoidance
The sender TCP maintains a variable called congestion window
(cwnd) to measure the network capacity. The number of unacknowledged
packets in the network is limited to cwnd or rcvwnd whichever is lower.
Initially, cwnd is set to one segment and it increases by one segment on the
receipt of each new ACK until it reaches a maximum (typically 65536 bytes).
It can be shown that in this way, cwnd doubles every RTT. This indicates that
every RTT, cwnd increases exponentially. [172]
The
sender
maintains
a
retransmission
timeout
for
the
last
unacknowledged packet. Congestion is indicated by the expiration of the
retransmission timeout. When the timer expires, the sender saves half the
cwnd in a variable called ssthresh, and sets cwnd to I segment. The sender
then retransmits segments starting from the lost segment. cwnd is increased
by one segment on the receipt of each new ACK until it reaches ssthresh. This
is called the slow start phase. After that, cwnd increases by one segment every
RTT. This results in a linear increase of cwnd every RTT, and is called the
congestion avoidance phase. Figure 7.18 shows the slow start and congestion
avoidance phases for a typical TCP connection.

TCP uses the Slow Start mechanism to probe the network at the start
of connection. The time required by the Slow Start to reach a bit rate B is
given by the following formula:
.
B*RTT
Slow Start Duration = RTT(l +log2)
(7.4)
I
where I is the average packet length expressed in bits.

BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
In table 7.4 are shown the duration of Slow Start phase for different
types of satellites, LEO, MEa and GEO, and for different values of B, when I
= I KB, which is a common value for segment size. It is clear that for long
delay satell ites, such as GEOs, TCP stays longer on Slow Start. [173]

If delayed ACK mechanism is implemented then the time required by
Slow Start to reach the bit rate B is given by the following formula:
.
B*RTT
Slow Start Duration = RTT(l + log..
I
)
(7.5)
That means the
Slow
Start
Duration
becomes even
longer the
previous one. Thus, delayed ACKs are another source of wasted capacity
during the Slow Start phase.
In congestion avoidance the growth of data rate is a function of the
delay-bandwidth product. In fact, during each RTT, the data rate is increased
by I/(B * RTT) . So if a TCP connection is in congestion avoidance and some
bandwidth becomes available, this connection will not use the bandwidth for a
long time. This time will be longer in the presence of transmission losses.
Therefore the congestion avoidance in satellite networks with high RTT
performs lower than in a terrestrial.
7.3.2.3 Fast Retransmit and Fast Recovery
Currently TCP implementations use a coarse granularity (typically
500 ms) timer for the retransmission timeout. As a result, during congestion,
the TCP connection can lose much time waiting for the timeout. In figure
7.18, the horizontal cwnd line shows the time lost in waiting for a timeout to
occur. During this time, TCP neither sends new packets nor retransmits lost
packets. Moreover, once the timeout occurs, the cwnd is set to I segment, and
the connection takes several round trips to efficiently utilize the network. TCP
Reno implements the fast retransmit and recovery algorithms that enable the
connection to quickly recover from isolated segment losses. [172]

Satellite TCP/IP: Technical Challenges
201
If a segment is dropped by the network, the subsequent segments that
arrive at the receiver are out-of-order segments for each of which, the TCP
receiver immediately sends an ACK to the sender indicating the sequence
number of the missing segment. This ACK is called a duplicate ACK. When
the sender receives three duplicate ACKs, it concludes that the segment
indicated by the ACKs has been lost, and immediately retransmits the lost
segment. The sender then reduces cwnd to half (plus 3 segments) and also
saves half the original cwnd value in ssthresh. For each subsequent duplicate
ACK, the sender inflates cwnd by one and tries to send a new segment.
Effectively, the sender waits for half a round trip before sending one segment
for each subsequent duplicate ACK it receives. As a result, the sender
maintains the network pipe at half its capacity at the time of fast retransmit.
Approximately
one
round
trip
after
the
missing
segment
is
retransmitted; its ACK is received (assuming the retransmitted segment was
not lost). At this time, instead of setting cwnd to one segment and proceeding
to do slow start until cwnd reaches ssthresh, the TCP sets cwnd to ssthresh,
and then does congestion avoidance . This
is called the fast recovery
algorithm .
Fast retransmit and recovery is also affected by long RTTs, typical for
satellite connections. These connections are able to inject enough new
segments
into
the : network
during
recovery
to
trigger
multiple
fast
retransmissions per window of data, which may hurt TCP performance.
Effect ofBit Errors on TCP Throughput
The effect of BER on TCP throughput is another significant factor.
As shown in the figure 7.19 [173] TCP can perform poorly in the presence of
errors and is more sensitive to errors for larger window size. In order to reach
a larger congestion window, TCP should not experience losses, that means
should have lower BER.

The following section describes the TCP protocol enhancements to
take into account the link errors, latency, and bandwidth asymmetry.
7.3.3 TCP Enhancements for Satellite Networks
The IETF Te l' over Satellite working group has recently made a number of recommendations
to enhance the performance ofTCP over satellite links in its RFCs.
7.3.3.1 Large Initial Window
The initial phase of a TCP connection begins with a value of cwnd
equal to 1 at the sender's side. As the slow start phase progresses, cwnd is
increased based on the incoming ACKs. The Large Initial Window [174, 175]
proposes to begin with a larger value of cwnd, allowing more segments to be
transmitted during the first RTT of the connection. This in turn speeds up the
number of ACKs received at the sender, allowing the congestion window to
increase at a faster rate. The initial value of cwnd is defined as follows:
cwnd =min{4*SMSS, max{2*MSS, 4380 bytes}}
(7.6)
where SMSS defines the sender's maximum segment size. This
formula allows the sender to transmit up to 4 segments initially, which can be
particularly beneficial for short-lived connections such as those used for
HTTP transactions. For cwnd of more than four segments, Quick-Start
mechanism has been proposed. TCP Quick-Start is discussed in Section
7.3.8.1.

Satellite TCP/IP: Technical Challenges
7.3.3.2 Delayed ACKs after Slow Start
203
Receivers do not typically ACK every incoming segment, but rather
ACK every other segment. While this can be advantageous on asymmetric
links with low bandwidth in the return direction, this strategy slows the
growth of the congestion window and can limit throughput, since new
transmissions are clocked out based on received acknowledgements. Delayed
ACKs after slow start is designed to counter the effects of delayed ACKs on
long delay paths [176]. The receiver acknowledges every incoming segment
during the slow start phase, and returns to the delayed ACK algorithm during
congestion avoidance. Thus, the slow start phase is shortened since the
sender's congestion window reaches its maximum value more quickly. While
throughput generally improves, a moderate increase in loss may occur since
the
sender
is more
aggressively
injecting segments
into the
network.
Furthermore, an implementation may be difficult to achieve since it is not
clear how the receiver will know when the sender has terminated the slow
start phase.
7.3.3.3 Byte Counting
Byte counting proposes to increase the congestion window based on
the number of transmitted bytes acknowledged by incoming ACKs , rather
than on the number of ACKs received [174].
For long delay paths in
particular, this scheme has been shown to reduce the amount of time it takes
to reach the optimal congestion window size. Table 7.5 shows the throughput
improvement when cwnd is increased based on byte counting instead of ACK
counting. The improvement for short transfers is better than for long ones.

7.3.3.4 TCP Vegas
TCP Vegas reduces the time to retransmit a segment when waiting for
three duplicate ACKs [177]. It also provides a mechanism for retransmission

204
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
that avoids a long timeout when duplicate ACKs are not forthcoming (due to a
lack of transmissions in-flight after the loss).
For each segment, Vegas
computes the RTT based on the recorded system time at transmission and the
ACK time of arrival.
When a duplicate ACK is received because a segment
was lost, the computed RTT of the lost segment is checked to see if a timeout
should have occurred. If so, the segment is retransmitted without waiting for
more duplicate ACKs. Recall that the purpose of waiting for three duplicate
ACKs in Reno is to avoid a retransmission simply because segments were
reordered in the network.
Because of the RTT calculation, Vegas does not
violate this policy.
After a retransmission, a second
check
based on
calculated RTTs is used to retransmit any additional lost segments that may
have occurred. This check is used only on the first or second non-duplicate
acknowledgement received after a retransmission.
7.3.3.5 TCP NewReno
The TCP Reno algorithm does not generally recover well in the
presence of multiple segment losses within one window's worth ofdata. Only
the first lost segment is recovered via the fast retransmit algorithm, while the
rest normally must wait for a retransmission timeout before recovery (the fast
recovery phase is terminated after the first retransmission is acknowledged).
The
TCP
NewReno
proposal
modifies
the
fast
retransmit/fast
recovery algorithms of TCP Reno to allow recovery from multiple segment
losses.
An ACK for a retransmitted segment will normally acknowledge all
segments transmitted prior to entering fast retransmit (loss detection from
duplicate ACKs).
However, if there were multiple segments lost, then the
ACK will only acknowledge some of the segments that were in-flight.
This
type of acknowledgement for a retransmitted segment is known as a partial
acknowledgement.
TCP NewReno [178] is a .modification to the fast
retransmit/fast recovery algorithms in response to partial acknowledgements.
When a partial
ACK is received, the first unacknowledged segment is
retransmitted and the fast recovery algorithm continues (duplicate ACKs
cause an increase in cwnd by I and a transmission of a new segment if
allowed by cwnd and rwnd).
This is an aggressive policy since the first
unacknowledged segment is retransmitted without waiting for three duplicate
acknowledgements or a retransmission timeout.
It represents an important
consideration since such duplicates may never arrive at the sender because
new segments were not sent to the receiver.
Without this modification, the
sender would likely have to wait for a retransmission timeout, which impacts
throughput severely.
TCP Newkeno is limited to the retransmission of at
most one dropped segment per RTT, since the second loss is not discovered
until the first retransmission is acknowledged.

7.3.3.6 TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK)
TCP with Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) has been proposed to
efficiently recover from multiple segment losses [179, 180]. In SACK TCP,
acknowledgments contain additional
information about the segments that
have been received by the destination. When the destination receives out-of-
order segments, it sends duplicate ACKs (SACKs) acknowledging the out-of-
order segments it has received. From these SACKs, the sending TCP can
reconstruct information about the segments not received at the destination.
When the sender receives three duplicate ACKs, it retransmits the first lost
segment, and inflates its cwnd by one for each duplicate ACK it receives. This
behavior is same as TCP Reno. However, when the sender is allowed to send
a segment, it uses the SACK information to retransmit lost segments before
sending new segments. As a result, the sender can recover from multiple
dropped segments in about one round trip. Figure 7.21 shows the congestion
window graph of a SACK TCP recovering from segment losses. During the
time when the congestion window is inflating (after fast retransmit has
incurred), the TCP is sending missing packets before any new packets.

Figure 7.21: repSACK recovery f rom packet loss
I'C]' SACKExamplefor Multiple rcp Sessions
An example [181] for studying the effect of multiple TCP sessions is
discussed below. Multiple sessions imply smaller operating window sizes per
session, burst losses are less likely to only affect a given flow. Thus the burst
losses are spread over multiple TCP connections, which
improves the
effectiveness of TCP Reno's fast retransmit and recovery algorithm. A
simulation for a MEO link varying BER is shown in figure 7.22. The
parameters for the simulation are: one-way forward propagation delay is 120
ms, and the reverse channel from TCP destination to source via terrestrial
channel is restricted to 200 Kbps. The satellite link rate is fixed at 10 Mbps
ignoring FEC overheads and no Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) link
protocols are used. Multiple TCP sessions are used along with a single TCP
SACK connection. The window scaling/PAWS options are enabled and the
TCP segment size is fixed at 9140 bytes. Most ofthe buffering is placed at the
access
devices and
is about
300
Kbytes. The performance shows an
improvement with increasing multiple sessions for BER values of 1x 10.7,
which confirms that more sessions are required for higher BER values.
7.3.3.7 Forward Error Correction (FEC)
TCP interprets all losses are due to congestion. In case of losses due
to transmission errors, TCP does not need to reduce its congestion window.
For TCP to operate efficiently, nearly all transmission losses should be
eliminated. Several forward error correction (FEC) techniques have been

Satellite TCP/IP: Technical Challenges
207
proposed and implemented to improve the BER performance on satellite
links. [48, 162, 182].

7.3.3.8 Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)
Explicit Congestion Notification
allows
routers to inform
TCP
senders about imminent congestion without dropping segments [183]. In case
of congestion, routers mark IP packets with a special Congestion Experienced
(CE) codepoint and the TCP receiver echoes the congestion information back
to the sender in an ACK packet. ECN improves the performance of TCP
connections and avoids unnecessary packet drops and retransmits timeouts for
short or delay-sensitive TCP connections. ECN mechanism can be used as
part of a mechanism to differentiate between congestion losses and error
losses in satellite networks. The
implementation of ECN requires the
deployment of Active Queue Management such as RED in routers. [184]
describes congestion control using Multilevel ECN for satellite networks.
7.3.3.9 TCP/IP Header Compression
A significant amount of overhead exists in TCP segment i.e., with
TCP/IPv4 headers of at least 40 bytes and TCP/IPv6 headers of at least 60
bytes. Some ofthis information like the source and destination addresses, port
numbers, is constant or slowly changing during a connection and need not be
repeated with each transmitted segment. Header compression [185] typically
reduces TCP/IPv4 headers from 40 to 3 - 5 bytes. It involves the process of

208
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
intermittently transmitting a full header, with subsequent compressed headers
referencing the contents of the previous full header. A sender may send a full
header when one or more of the header fields must be updated. Since
compression happens at the link layer, routing is not affected since the header
is expanded before being passed to the IP layer. In addition to improving
throughput of user data, compression can reduce segment loss due to bit errors
since the probability of a header error is reduced
7.3.3.10 Window Scaling
For a long delay connection, the standard maximum TCP window
size is 216 = 65 KBytes, which presents a severe limitation on the achievable
throughput. The throughput is limited to the ratio of the window size to the
RTT, which defines the maximum amount of in-flight data allowed. For a
connection traversing a satellite hop, the throughput will be limited to
approximately 900 kbps using this window size. Notice that a larger window
size is also needed to realize the potential of high bandwidth links traversing
low delay paths (e.g. fiber optic). With RFC 1323 [186], the window size can
achieve an effective size of 230 = 1.1 GB through the use of scaling the
existing 16 bit field. A satellite connection can now theoretically achieve a
throughput upwards of 15 Gbps.
7.3.3.11 TCP for Transactions
TCP for Transactions (TITCP) attempts to reduce the connection
handshaking latency for most connections from two to one RTT for small
transactions [187]. After the first connection between a pair of hosts is
established, TITCP is able to bypass the three-way handshake, allowing the
sender to transmit data in the first segment sent. This reduction in latency can
be significant for short web traffic over satellite links. Table 7.6 shows the
HTTP delay experienced with TCP and TITCP for GEO and LEO links, for
maximum segment sizes of 1500 and 500 bytes [47]. The lowest delays are
obtained combining TITCP with 4MSS i.e., Slow Start with an initial window
of four.

7.3.3.12 Pacing TCP Segments
209
Rate-based-pacing (RBP) is a technique used in absence of incoming
ACKs, where TCP sender temporarily paces TCP segments at a given rate
until the ACK clock can be restarted. As soon as the first acknowledgement is
received RBP ceases and TCP ACK resumes. The pacing rate may either be
derived from recent traffic estimates or may be known through external
means. Pacing data during the first RTT of transfer may allow TCP to make
effective use of high bandwidth-delay pipes, such as satellite ones, even for
short transfer.
Simulation studies [47] ofRPB for HTTP-like traffic show substantial
throughput improvement compared to Slow Start after idle periods and slight
improvement compared to burst-full-cwnd after idle period. RPB requires
some extra mechanisms such as a sender timer for pacing. The overhead of
timer-driven data transfer is often considered too high for practical use.
TCP Pacing Example
Delaying returning ACK packets (ACK pacing), and those modifying
the receiver window field in returning ACK packets (receiver window
modification) are two schemes of pacing. ACK control has the benefit of
requiring no changes for TCP protocol stacks and introducing only sender-
side complexity. Returning ACK packets can be controlled at the ground
terminal.
A simulation performance example [181] for enhanced ACK pacing
for a MEO link assuming forward channel with 50 Mbps and 120 ms delay;
reverse channel at 1.5 Mbps and 100 ms delay; link BER varied between 10-9
and
10-10 showed significant savings in buffer capacity in addition to
improved utilization of over 20% on an average.

Unit
(MTU)
Discovery
[188]
determines the maximum IP datagram size along a given network path that
can be used without incurring IP fragmentation. The sending IP layer
transmits IP datagrams to the destination with the incurring IP fragmentation.
The sending IP layer transmits IP datagrams to the destination with the "don't
fragment"
(OF)
bit set. If any gateway along the path detects that
fragmentation is necessary, an IeMP message is returned to the sender
indicating the problem and providing the largest datagram size that is allowed

210
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
by the gateway on the offending link. The sender may then reduce the size of
the test IP datagram and try again. This is repeated until the destination is
reached (no ICMP message received at sender). The MTU size must be
passed to the TCP layer so that it can set the maximum segment size (MSS)
appropriateIy.
7.3.3.14 TCP Enhancements Summary
Table 7.7 provides a summary of the TCP protocol enhancements for
large bandwidth delay product environment such as satellite links. The IETF
recommended RFCs addressing the issues of latency, large BOP, and link
error impairments are shown below. Many testbeds and implementations
reported in the literature favor TCP SACK and NewReno for satellite links
[159].

7.3.4 Performance Enhancing Proxies (PEP)
211
Performance Enhancing Proxies (PEPs) are used to improve the
performance of the Internet protocols on networks paths where native
performance suffers due to characteristics of the links or subnetworks on the
path [189, 190, 191]. PEPs represent the "de facto" solution on field for TCP
problems over satellite links. Even though PEPs have several drawbacks, they
are practically being implemented to mitigate the problems of TCP over
satellite links. Most of the proposed TCP enhancements can safely be used in
PEP solutions. In this scenario, the end users can use their standard TCP
stacks implemented in their operations systems, the Internet is safe of more
aggressive protocols, which now are applied only inside PEP subnetworks and
the complexity of implementation and tuning is taken care from satellite
service providers, who own and operate the PEP subnetworks. Therefore,
PEPs represent a good trade-off between technical model and business model
of satellite Internet.
There are many types of PEPs and they can be implemented at any
protocol layer. But PEPs typically are implemented at transport or application
layer. There are also PEPs, which operate at the data link layer, but such
implementations
are
out
of the
scope
of this
chapter.

implementations operate across several layers by utilizing the information of
these layers. Most of transport layer PEPs are designed to interact with TCP
and to mitigate the problems TCP encounters running over satellite links.
Such PEPs are transparent for application protocols, which operate end-to-
end. Examples
of transport
layer
PEPs are
TCP
spoofing and
TCP
connection-split proxies discussed later in this section. Example of application
layer
PEPs
are
Web
caches
and
relay
Mail
Transfer
Agents. PEPs
implementations could be symmetric or asymmetric. Symmetric PEPs have
identical behavior in both directions. That means the action taken by the PEP
is independent from which interface a packet is received. Asymmetric PEPs
operate differently in different directions. The direction could be defined in
terms of link or in terms of protocol, for example the direction of TCP data
flow or TCP ACK flow. An asymmetric PEP is usually used at the point
where the characteristics of the links or protocols in each side of the PEP
differ.
PEPs
can
be
classified
also
depending
on
their
degree
of
transparency.
PEP implementations could be totally transparent to end
systems, transport end points and/or applications. In this case the use of PEPs
requires no modifications to end systems. PEPs could require modifications to
only one or both the end users. In this instance the PEP is non-transparent.

7.3.4.1 TCP Spoofing
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
There are two main strategies in PEPs design: TCP Spoofing and TCP
Splitting. In both cases the goal is to shield high-latency or lossy satellite
network segments from the rest of the network, in a transparent way to the
applications. The goal is for the end users to be unaware of the intermediate
gateway, other than improved performance.
The term TCP spoofing is sometimes used for TCP PEP functionality.
In TCP Spoofing a router (gateway) near the source send back ACKs for TCP
segments in order to give the source the illusion of a short delay path and
therefore to speed up the sender's data transmission. It then suppresses the
true acknowledgement stream from the satellite host and takes responsibility
for sending any missing data. However, unlike a TCP proxy (see next
paragraph), spoofing is transparent to both the sender and receiver.
7.3.4.2 TCP Splitting
Split TCP or cascading TCP is a scheme where a TCP connection is
divided into multiple TCP connections, with a special connection running
over the satellite link. The idea is that the TCP running over the satellite link
can be modified, with knowledge of the satellite 's properties, to run faster.
Because each TCP connection is terminated, cascading TCP is not vulnerable
to asymmetric paths. It works well in cases where applications actively
participate in TCP connection management e.g., Web caching. In other cases,
split TCP has the same problems as TCP spoofing.
Two segment splitting scheme
The two segment splitting technique is to divide end-to-end TCP
connections into two segments by inserting a gateway at a sender side as
shown in figure 7.23. This technique is of great use under the following
scenarios:
â€¢
Networks with star topology consisting of a hub (central) station and
many remote stations are widely used for distributing contents data
from the hub station;
â€¢
TCP enhancement is usually needed in the outbound direction (hub to
remotes) only;
â€¢
It may not be economically feasible either to introduce the gateway
into every earth station or to install new TCP software that supports
window scaling option etc. into all PC terminals.

Satellite TCP/IP: Technical Challenges
213
In this scheme, transmit data speed from the TCP sender is enhanced
by separating a satellite segment from the original TCP connection. It also
appears for the sender that RTT is reduced compared with the standard TCP .
In the split-TCP 2, the gateway can send data packets regardless of
the TCP window size advertised from the receiver. It also employs the
optimized congestion control for this segment to improve TCP performance.

where one end system TCP at the terminal can be configured for satellite
operation. Between the end user and the gateway the TCP connection benefits
from throughput ramp-up during slow start transmission phase due to early
local acknowledgements during data transfers. TCP enhancements such as
large initial window sizes and window scaling improves performance over the
long propagation delay TCP connection (Split-TCP 2).

BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
Three segment splitting scheme
The three segment splitting scheme is to divide end-to-end TCP
connections into three segments by two gateways. The concept is to separate
the satellite segment from the terrestrial segments and use an optimized TCP
protocol over the satellite link between gateways.
As illustrated in figure 7.25, gateways are located at each earth station
and an end-to-end TCP connection is divided into three segments . In the
terrestrial segments, a standard TCP is used for communicating between TCP
sender/receiver and gateway. The gateway converts TCP to a protocol
optimized for satellite links. The main advantage of this method is that TCP
enhancement is achieved without any modification to the PCs located at the
sender and receiver side while other techniques require installing new TCP
software. This scheme is especially suitable for point-to-point networks where
enhancement for both-way is needed such as ISP backbone.
Since the gateway analyses a TCP header, it should be noted that the
enhancement becomes unavailable when an encryption is made over TCP
segment. This problem also occurs in two segment splitting technique.

The "segment splitting techniques" improve TCP performance over
satellite links. In particular, two segment splitting technique results show that
this method can improve TCP throughput to a great extent. Another advantage
is found when using satellite networks with star topology by only having to
install a gateway at the hub earth station. This enables improvement of all
TCP throughputs for downloading files from hub to remote stations.

7.3.4.3 PEP Mechanisms
PEP mechanisms include ACK spacing, ACK regeneration (not in the
draft yet), local acknowledgements, local transmissions, tunnels to control
routing of packets, header compression, payload compression, and priority
based multiplexing. Some of the environments where PEPs are used include
Satellite VSAT networks, (Mobile) Wireless WAN (W-WAN) networks,
Wireless LAN (W-LAN) networks, Wireles s Application Protocol (WAP)
networks etc.
The key characteristics of a PEP implementation are the mechanisms
used to improve the TCP performance over satellite links. Some examples of
PEP mechanisms are described below. Many TCP PEPs use TCP ACK
manipulation. Some other PEPs acknowledge TCP segments locally in order
to mitigate the effect of long RTT and it speeds up the Slow Start which is the
main mechanism used in TCP Spoofing. Local negative acknowledgements
are also used to trigger local and fast error recovery. Local ACKs are used in
PEPs with split connections. When local ACKs are used, and the data is
dropped after being acknowledged by the PEP, it is PEPs responsibility to
recover the data. In this case the PEP has to use local TCP retransmission to
the receivers.
Some PEPs perform local retransmissions even when they do not use
local acknowledgements. For example, Snoop [192] cashes the received TCP
segments and monitors the system for duplicate ACKs from the receiver.
When duplicate ACKs are received, Snoop locally transmits the lost TCP
segments from its cache. To mitigate highly asymmetric bandwidth, some
PEPs implement TCP ACKs filtering and reconstruction. ACKs are being

216
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
filtered in order not to congest the low- speed direction and are reconstructed
on the other side ofthe links.
7.3.4.4 Implications of Using PEP
PEP implications are listed below.
End-to-end security: Since PEPs need to see inside IP packets and, in
some implementations, generate IP. packets on behalf of an end system, PEPs
cannot be used with end-to-end IP Sec. Tunneled IPSec should be used with
PEPs as the tunnel end points. This requires the PEPs to be trusted by the
user. In general, security mechanisms at or above the transport layer (e.g. TLS
or SSL) can be used with PEPs.
End-to-end fate sharing: Most PEP implementations keep state. A
failure of a PEP implementation, which keeps "soft" state, may support fail
over to alternate paths. A failure of a PEP implementation which keeps "hard"
state (e.g. state required to support split connections) will generally cause a
connection to fail even though an alternate end-to-end path exists for the
connection.
End-to-end reliability: PEP Implementations may affect the end-to-
end
reliability of a connection, especially
if the
PEP
interferes with
application layer acknowledgements. Applications should not rely on lower
level (e.g. TCP) acknowledgements to guarantee end-to-end delivery. TCP
PEPs generally do not interfere with application layer acknowledgements.
End-to-end failure
diagnostics: Using PEPs can replace
certain
constraints on the routing topology. Suboptimal routing might be required to
force traffic to go through a PEP. Tunnels might be required to force traffic to
go through a PEP, especially in an asymmetric routing environment. Using
PEPs with mobile hosts might require PEP state to be handed off as the hosts
move. PEP potentially interferes with the use of end-to-end failure diagnostics
tools.
7.3.4.5 Performance Examples
TCP PEP Example: SkyX
SkyX is a TCP-PEP product of MENTAT [193]. SkyX Protocol is
optimized to provide maximum throughput over satellite networks and to
respond efficiently to satellite latency, bit error, and asymmetric bandwidth

Satellite TCP/IP: Technical Challenges
217
conditions. SkyX runs over IP and can be used in a gateway to enhance the
performance of backbone satellite links, corporate networks, VSAT networks
and satellite links to local area networks supporting IOMbps or 45Mbps.
SkyX gateway shown in figure 7.27 intercepts the TCP connection
from the client and converts the data into the SkyX Protocol for transmission
over the satellite. The SkyX gateway on the opposite site of the satellite link
translates the data back to TCP for communication with the server. The SkyX
gateway provides performance enhancement for a variety of satellite networks
including point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and full mesh architectures.
SkyX uses an efficient selective retransmission algorithm for the
acknowledgement of data and a large window to remove the dependency of
TCP on the BOP, allowing high throughput. It uses a rate control algorithm to
set the transmission rate explicitly based on the bandwidth of the link
maximizing the throughput. SkyX uses data compression ratios up to 5:]
increasing the amount of data transfers over the link.

TCP Performance over Satellite Link with PEP Gateway
[194] illustrates the performance of a TCP protocol gateway under
various loading conditions. In addition to simulating satellite conditions, the

218
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
effect of Internet congestion on end-to-end throughput with protocol gateway
is also studied . The tests conducted include:
â€¢
Single TCP connection throughput for various link bandwidths: High-
speed LAN and Internet-2 applications for large data files were
simulated comparing the performance with protocol gateway.
â€¢
Multiple TCP connections with fixed per-connection bandwidth:
Performance benefit of the protocol gateway for ISP links supporting
large numbers of small TCP connections was examined. Tests were
run for round trip delay of 700 ms to simulate the combination of a
500 ms satellite hop from the user to the Internet backbone and 200
ms delay to reach the server.
Figure 7.28 shows the network test configuration. The network
contains two link simulators to simulate the effects of both the satellite link
conditions and the terrestrial
Internet
backbone. The client and server
machines were both Sun Enterprise 450 (2 x UltraSPARC-II 296 MHz)
with 2 048 MB memory running Solaris 7. A client-server application was

round trip delay is 700 ms. With this delay, even without errors, TCP is
limited to only 31 Mbps for 350 connections. At higher error rates, TCP

network. In the satellite environment with a round trip delay of 700 ms, the
protocol gateway allows the connection to utilizethe full bandwidth available.
The performance is essentially identical to the theoretical limit for up to 280
connections. For the satellite-based network, the protocol gateway provides a
substantial increase in aggregate bandwidth at low bit error rates. At a packet
loss rate of 10%, the aggregate throughput for 350 connections with the
gateway is 33 Mbps comparedto only 10 Mbps for enhancedTCP.

7.3.4.6 Security over PEP
The
potential
end-to-end
security
implications
in
PEP
implementations are discussed below. In most cases, security applied above
the transport layer can be used with PEPs, especially transport layer PEPs but
today only a limited number of applications include support for the use of
transport (or higher) layer security. On the other hand, IPSec can be used by
any application, transparently to the application.
A user or network administrator must choose between using PEPs and
using IPSec. If IPSec is employed end-to-end, PEPs that are implemented on
intermediate nodes in the network cannot examine the transport or application
headers of IP packets because encryption of IP packets via IPSec's ESP
header (in either transport or tunnel mode) renders the TCP header and
payload unintelligible to the PEPs.
If a PEP implementation is non-transparent to the users and they trust
the PEP in the middle, IPSec can be used separately between each end system
and PEP. This is not an acceptable alternative because, end systems cannot
trust PEPs in general, this is less secure than end-to-end security, and it can
lead to potentially misleading security level assumptions by the end systems.

Satellite TCP/IP: Technical Challenges
221
To prevent this, PEP could force the same level of security to each end
system, which again increases the complexity .
With a transparent PEP implementation, it is difficult for the end
systems to trust the PEP because they may not be aware of its existence. Even
if the user is aware of the PEP, setting up acceptable security associations
with the PEP while maintaining the PEP's transparent nature is problematic.
Even when a PEP implementation does not break the end-to-end semantics of
a connection, the PEP implementation may not be able to function in the
presence of IPSec.
[189] has reported security implication mitigation methods such as
end user using IPSec for some traffic and not for other, and implementing
IPSec between two PEPs of a distributed PEP implementation. In both the
cases significant complexity being added to the end system implementation
has been reported. A further research has to be undertaken for developing
alternative approaches for achieving end-to-end secured satellite networks.
7.3.5 Wireless IP Suite Enhancer (WISE)
The Wireless IP Suite Enhancer (WISE) [195], which was developed
at Lincoln Laboratory, improves the performance of TCP/IP protocol suite in
a wireless environment, increasing the wireless link utilization. The WISE
approach consists of software that is added to gateways at the periphery of the
wireless segment of the network. It operates by transparently splitting the
TCP connection into three segments, client to gateway, gateway to gateway
via the wireless
link, and gateway
to server. The gateway-to-gateway
connection uses a special Wireless Link Protocol (WLP) developed according
to the physical characteristics of the wireless link at hand. The WISE software
converts TCP to WLP upon entering the wireless subnetwork and back to
TCP upon exiting.
This implementation has many advantages. Since TCP is not used on
the satellite link, the ill effects of latency and errors due to high delay links on
TCP, and TCP fairness problem are avoided. TCP/IP headers are replaced by
much shorter WLP header and compression of the TCP/IP data may be
performed so that fewer bytes need to be sent over the wireless segment. Data
can also be encrypted to protect it from eavesdropping. The system can be
implemented without changes to the TCP/IP code on the gateway.

222
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
7.3.6 Network Path Asymmetry
Asymmetric channel capabilities are exhibited by several network
technologies, including:
â€¢
Direct broadcast satellite (e.g. an IP service using digital video
broadcast (DVB) with an interactive return channel)
â€¢
Very small aperture satellite terminals (VSAT)
â€¢
Cable networks (e.g. DOCSIS cable TV networks)
â€¢
Asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL)
â€¢
Several packet radio networks
These
networks
are increasingly being
deployed
as
high-speed
Internet access networks, and it is therefore highly desirable to achieve good
TCP performance over them. However, the asymmetry of the network paths
often makes this challenging.
Several mitigations have been proposed and some evaluated in
practice, to improve the efficiency of data transfer over connections with
asymmetrical capability in each direction . These solutions use a combination
of mechanisms, consisting of:
â€¢
Header compression ofvarious kinds
â€¢
Reducing the frequency of TCP ACKs
â€¢
Techniques to handle this reduced ACK frequency to retain the TCP
sender' s acknowledgment-triggered self-clocking
â€¢
Scheduling data and ACK packets in the reverse direction to improve
performance, in this presence oftwo-way traffic.
Tables 7.8 and 7.9 show the IETF recommendations for possible
mitigation measures concerning host and transparent modifications [46, 196].
7.3.7 Other Transport Protocols
Another way to resolve the problems of TCP over satellite links is to
design new transport layer protocols optimized for such links. This section
provides two
examples of new
proposed
transport protocols
designed
specifically for satellite environments. Deploying such satellite specific
transport layer protocols would require changes in most applications and the
Internet
infrastructure.
On
the
other
hand
for
large,
complex
and
heterogeneous systems such as Internet, only evolutionary changes seem
realistic. Two transport protocols STP and SCPS-TP, designed for satellite
links are presented below.

7.3.7.1 Satellite Transport Protocol (STP)
STP [160, 161] is a transport protocol that was designed to perform
well over satellite links. The STP sender and receiver use buffer sizes that are
of the order of the bandwidth-delay product of the links. Like TCP, STP
provides a reliable, byte-oriented streaming data service to applications. The
transmitter sends variable-length packets to the receiver, storing the packets
for potential retransmission until the receiver has acknowledged them. STP's

224
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
automatic
repeat
request
(ARQ)
mechanism
uses
selective
negative
acknowledgements, rather than the positive acknowledgement. Packets are
numbered instead of bytes and the STP transmitter retransmits only those
specific packets that have been explicitly requested by the receiver. Unlike
TCP, there are no retransmission timers associated with packets. One of the
main differences between STP and TCP, which offers an advantage for
symmetric networks, is the way in which the two protocols acknowledge data.
TCP acknowledgements are data-driven; TCP receiver typically sends an
ACK for every other packet received. While this is beneficial for accelerating
window growth upon connection startup, it results in a large amount of
acknowledgement traffic when for large windows. In STP, the transmitter
periodically requests the receiver to acknowledge the data that it has
successfully
received.
Losses
detected
by
the
receiver
are
explicitly
negatively acknowledged. The combination of these two strategies leads to
low reverse channel bandwidth usage when losses are rare and speedy
recovery in the event of loss. Positive acknowledgements are sent in response
to periodic polls sent by the transmitter.
In table 7.10 [160] the performances of TCP, TITCP and STP are
compared in terms of the average latency and average number of packets,
driven by a traffic generator based on HTTP over an emulated GEO system
(RTT=600ms). Each table entry is the average of 1000 independent runs with
the given protocol. It can be observed that the STP's performance is better
than TCP's but slightly worse than TITCP. The reason why STP's latency is a
little bit higher than TITCP's is due to the traffic smoothing mechanism used
in STP, where packets eligible for transmission are not sent immediately but
rather paced out over the estimated RTT.
These data show another trade-off in protocol design, this time
between smoothing bursty traffic (STP) and reducing latency (TITCP). [160]
shows the advantage of using STP in the satellite segment of a splitting
connection. The main advantage of STP is shown to be the low use of reverse
bandwidth .

7.3.7.2 Space Communications Protocol Specifications - Transport
Protocol (SCPS-TP)
225
Space Communications Protocol Specifications - Transport Protocol
was developed by the MITRE corporation and later was standardized by
Consultative Committee of Space Data Systems (CCSDS) to account for the
"stressed environment" i.e., space environment with delay, and multiple
sources of data loss [197]. SCPS-TP uses a congestion control algorithm that
does not depend on packet loss as a way to signal congestion in the network.
SCPS-TP can react to explicit signals of the two sources of packet loss
(congestion, and the satellite disappearing over the horizon). The ability for
SCPS-TP to tailor its response to the nature of the loss allows for better
network utilization and better end-to-end performance without harming the
overall network stability. In [197] laboratory and actual satellites tests are
presented, which show that SCPS-TP yield significant improvement over
standard TCP on error-prone links.
Among several experiments conducted to measure and verify the
performance of SCPS-TP, were two "bent-pipe" tests and one on-board test in
which the spacecraft hosted the SCPS software . Results proved that SCPS-TP
is well suited to the long-delay, potentially high bit-error rate environment of
satellites. Using options such as Header Compression, Selective Negative
Acknowledgement (SNACK), and TCP Timestamps produces varying effects
under different conditions.
7.3.7.3 Stream Controlled Transmission protocol (SCTP)
The new transport protocol called Stream Controlled Transmission
Protocol (SCTP) [198] was developed between the IETF and ITU-T SG-Il
for the transport of PSTN signaling traffic over IP networks. The applicability
and adaptation to satellite IP networks, is to be further investigated .
7.3.8 Recent TCP Enhancements
The recent research on TCP enhancements is summarized
In this
section.
7.3.8.1 Quick Start TCP
Quick-Start TCP [199] introduces a new mechanism for transport
protocols to determine an optional allowed initial congestion window at the
start of data transmission. The source indicates its initial desired rate in packet

226
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
per second by sending a Quick Start Request option in the IP header of the
initial TCP SYN or SYN/ACK packet. Each router along the path could either
approve the specified initial rate, reduce it, or indicate that nothing above the
default initial rate for that protocol will be allowed. The TCP receiver
communicates the final rate to TCP sender in a transport level Quick-Start
Response in answering SYN/ACK or ACK packet. Quick-Start allows TCP
connections to use high initial windows when there is unused bandwidth
along the path. Quick-Start is based on the ability of routers to determine
whether or not the output link is underutilized. As discussed in Section
7.3.3.1, [174] permits an initial congestion window of up to four segments.
Quick-Start would be required for connections using initial window higher
than four segments. Quick-Start could be especially beneficial for moderate-
sized connections in well-provisioned environments including high bandwidth
satellite links. The main problem with this proposal is that it requires all
routers to support Quick Start protocol and to implement some mechanism for
estimating the current link underutilization.
7.3.8.2 TCP Peach
TCP Peach is a new TCP congestion control scheme designed for
satellite networks [200, 201]. TCP Peach is composed of two new algorithms:
Sudden
Start
and
Rapid
Recovery,
besides
the
two
traditional
TCP
algorithms, Congestion Avoidance and Fast Retransmit. The new algorithms
are based on the uses of dummy segments to probe the availability of network
sources. Dummy segments are treated as low priority segments. In Sudden
Start the dummy packets are used to estimate the bandwidth of the path,
which will be used during Congestion Avoidance. In Rapid Recovery dummy
packets help to distinguish between transmission losses and congestion losses.
This scheme is shown to outperform standard TCP over satellite links [200]. It
requires coordination between sender and receiver and most importantly
requires all routers in the connection path to apply some sort of priority
mechanism. TCP Peach is further enhanced with TCP Peach+ [20 I].
7.3.8.3 Explicit Transport Error Notification (ETEN)
ETEN [202] was proposed for error-prone wireless and satellite
environments. In ETEN the TCP sender is notified when packets get lost due
to errors, so the sender can react differently. ETEN assumes that sufficient
information about the corrupted packet, such as IP addresses, port numbers
and TCP sequence numbers is available to intermediate routers or receivers.
Another
variation
of the
scheme,
Cumulative
ETEN
(CETEN)
uses
cumulative error rates detected by intermediate nodes for each link. In [202,

improvements achieved using ETEN.
ETEN
and its variations require
changes to intermediate routers, which is the main problem with this solution.
7.3.8.4 TCP Westwood
The key innovation of TCP Westwood (TCPW) [204] IS the use of
bandwidth estimate to directly drive cwnd and ssthresh. The TCP sender
continuously monitors ACKs from the receiver and computes its current
Eligible Rate Estimate (ERE). ERE is based on the rate of ACKs and their
payload. Upon a packet loss indication (3DUPACKs or a timeout) the sender
sets the cwnd and ssthresh based on ERE. TCPW was enhanced to TCPW
Bulk Rate (BK) [205], which differentiates between congestion loss and
transmission loss using combination of RTT measurements and the gap
between expected and achieved rate. When it is determined that the losses are
due to errors, TCP BK uses three new mechanisms: Bulk Repeat, Fixed
Retransmission Timeout and Intelligent Window Adjustment. In Bulk Repeat,
upon receiving a new partial ACK, the TCP sender retransmits all outstanding
packets in the current congestion window instead of sending only one lost
packet as in TCP NewReno.
7.3.9 TCP-Friendly Congestion Control
As streaming audio, video applications e.g., Internet audio players, IP
telephony, video conferencing and other real-time applications grow in future,
protocols like UDP, RTP, which support the applications, behave in a TCP-
friendly manner because, during congestion, TCP flows reduce data rates to
release the congestion, while the non-TCP flows continue to send at the
original rate. This leads to starvation of TCP traffic or even to a congestion
collapse. To avoid such a situation, TCP rate adaptation rules are being
defined to make non-TCP applications TCP friendly
leading to a fair
distribution of bandwidth.
The throughput equation recommended for TCP friendly rate control
is [206]:
(7.7)
where
X is the transmit rate in bytes/second

228
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
s is the packet size in bytes
R is the round trip time in seconds
p is loss event rate, between 0 and 1.0, of the number of loss events as a
fraction ofthe number of packets transmitted
tRTO is the TCP retransmission timeout value in seconds
b is the number of packets acknowledged by a single TCP acknowledgment.
Further investigation of TCP-friendly congestion control mechanism for
satell ite network is needed [207].

Satellite A TM: Technical Challenges 
8.1 INTRODUCTION 
As we described in Chapter 1, A TM provides the backbone 
technology for satellite networks due to its major advantages of providing 
traffic management and Quality of Service provisioning for real-time and 
non-real-time services. This chapter describes satellite A TM architecures for 
fixed and mobile users including bent pipe and on board processing satellites. 
Various traffic management functions and virtual source/virtual destination 
for ABR service and its performance, and satellite ATM security issues are 
described. 
8.2 SATELLITE ATM ARCHITECTURES 
The interconnection of satellites with ATM technology has several advantages 
such as:

There are two principal architectural options [208J. One is to use 
ATM switching and processing with the onboard payload as in EuroSkyWay 
and Astrolink. Secondly, A TM switching can be used in the gateway on the 
ground, using non-processing or bent pipe payloads. The different advantages 
and disadvantages are discussed in the following sections. 

230
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
8.2.1 Satellite ATM: Bent Pipe
The current GEO satellite networks at C- and Ku-band use bent pipe
architecture.
The
bent
pipe
payloads serve
as
repeaters
between
two
communication points on the ground, by receiving and retransmitting the
signals. Because of the wide coverage of the beam, all the earth terminals,
gateways and network control stations are within the coverage of a single
beam.
On the other hand, satellite network with bent pipe architecture but
with spot beams, takes advantage of frequency reuse. Also, each ground
element can communicate with all other within the same beam via the
satellite. Ground elements, which are not located within the same beam,
cannot communicate via the satel1ite because the payload does not support
ATM
switching necessary for interbeam connectivity. This
architecture
requires
a
sophisticated
terrestrial
network
infrastructure
to
provide
interterminal communication. Alternatively, hub-spoke architecture can be
designed with terminals being connected through a gateway and the gateways
share routing information. This architecture requires two satellite hops as
opposed to onboard ATM switching as discussed in the next section.
Bent pipe satellite ATM architectures include [209]:
(a) Fixed ATM network access: Provides fixed network access via
satel1ite and has ATM
UNI at user terminals and ATM User-Network
Interface (UNI)/ (Network-Network Interface) NNI at the gateway. There is
no support for mobility. Figure 8.1 shows such a satellite ATM architecture.
(b) Mobile ATM network access: Provides ATM network access by
mobile terminals. It has mobility-enhanced UNI at user terminals and NNI
between gateways and ATM network.
(c)

Provides

support mobility.

Provides

between

8.2.2 Satellite ATM: On-Board Processing and Switching
A satellite
ATM
network
with
onboard
processing
and
ATM
switching allows terminals to communicate with other terminals, gateways
and network control station in other beams . The capacity of the resulting
network is larger than the bent pipe architecture as a resu It of frequency reuse.
The onboard ATM switch does not require a centralized uplink for efficient
downlink bandwidth utilization. An uplink Demand Assignment Multiple
Access (DAMA) algorithm provides a flexible operation of the network. The
traffic management functions [210] if performed on board the switching
payloads, increases the complexity and weight and power requirements.
Alternatively,
the
congestion
control
function
and
monitoring can
be
accomplished at the ground.
User applications, throughput, flexibility, performance, and QoS
implementation complexity are some of the factors, which determine the
selection of onboard processing and switching versus bent pipe architectures.
The selection is mainly driven by the driving application and the economics
ofthe system and the comparative study is the subject of ongoing research.
aspsatellite ATM architectures include [209J:
(a) Fixed ATM network access : Media access is required. It has UNI
signaling between the user terminal and the satellite. It does not support
mobility.

(b) Mobile ATM network access: Mobility support is provided by the
mobility-enabled switch at the ground
ATM network and onboard the
satellite.
(c) Fixed ATM network interconnect: ATM switch onboard the
satellite acts as an intermediate node. It has to support NNI signaling, cell
switching, and multiplexing functions. There is no mobility support if GEO
satellite is used.

8.2.3 Satellite ATM Protocols
ATM-Based Satellite Access Interface
In a highly integrated satellite and ATM network scenario, the
protocol stack inside the satellite network boundaries is very similar to
standard ATM. However, the satellite components use the Satellite-ATM (S-
ATM) layer, which replaces the standard ATM layer in addition to the MAC
and radio physical layers [211]. The protocol architecture for both the control
and user planes are shown in figure 8.2(a) and 8.2(b). Signaling for call
control could be based on the Q.293 I protocol standard and is terminated at
the NCS. In the case of mobile or portable terminals, future versions of B-
ISON signaling (referenced as UNI* signaling) and IN standards can be
supported in a highly integrated network environment. Since S-ATM offers
the same service access point as the ATM layer, native ATM, TCP/IP or
UDP/IP applications are supported over the S-ATM protocol layer in a similar
fashion.
S-ATM Layer
A modified ATM cell header is proposed for use in the satellite air
interface [211]. The S-ATM packet, equivalent to an ATM cell is shown in
figure 8.2(c). It combines the functions of both the MAC and ATM headers.
The 4 bits for a Generic Flow Control (GFC) field that are present in the
standard ATM cell header can be removed, since their usage is not specified.
However, the placement of the GFC bits in the S-ATM header might prove to
be essential for the operation of future satellite ATM components. One reason
for this is compatibility to future standards, and a second reason is that these
bits could be used internally by the satellite access network to operate a
dedicated resource request signaling protocol. The standard ATM Virtual Path
Identifier (VPI) and Virtual Circuit Identifier (VCI) fields are replaced by the

SatelliteATM: Technical Challenges
233
satellite VPINCI (SVPI/SVCI) fields, which are used by the onboard satellite
switch. The Payload Type (PT) (3 bits) and the Cell Loss Priority (CLP) (1
bit) fields, need to be present in the S-ATM cell header, because they both
carry essential information related to the particular cell. Finally, extra coding
is required to protect the S-ATM header bits, in order to ensure the correct
cell routing and keep the Cell Misinsertion Ratio (CMR) low.

8.3 SATELLITE ATM TECHNICAL CHALLENGES
Satellite-A'TM systems can be used to achieve global connectivity by
interconnecting geographically dispersed ATM networks. These systems will
be able to achieve statistical multiplexing gains while maintaining Quality of
Service (QoS) requirements. The ATM paradigm is aimed at supporting the
diverse requirements of a variety of traffic sources, and providing flexible
transport and switching services in an efficient manner. Hence, there is a
growing
interest
in satellite-ATM
networks
[212,
213]
and
proposed
broadband satellite systems use onboard ATM or fast packet switching.
However, certain design challenges must be addressed before these systems
can be deployed. [214]
Table 8.1 provides some of these technical challenges, which have to
be addressed. For example, ATM has been developed for fiber networks that
have low error rate with random packet loss. However, satellite links are
characterized by much higher error rates with packet loss occurring in a burst.
Given the limited error correction capability of ATM cell headers, for satellite
ATM links, effective encoding techniques are required to reduce link error
rate and randomize the packet loss. Similarly, limited bandwidth available on
satellite links make it necessary to use DAMA techniques in order to support
multimedia applications. [215]

TRAFFIC
MANAGEMENT
AND
CONGESTION
CONTROL
Traffic management tries to maxmu ze traffic revenue subject to
constraints of traffic contracts, QoS, and "fairness." The traffic management
problem is especially difficult during periods of heavy load particularly if
traffic demands cannot be predicted in advance . For this reason, congestion
control is an essential part of traffic management. [216, 217, 218]
Congestion control is critical to both ATM and non-ATM networks.
Several congestion control scheme s provide feedback to the hosts to adjust
their input rates to match the available link capacity. One way to classify
congestion control schemes is by the layer of the ISO/OSI reference model at
which the scheme operates. For example, there are datalink, network, and
transport layer congestion control schemes. Typically, a combin ation of such
schemes is used both by networks and end systems. The effectiveness of a
scheme depends heavily upon factors like the severity, duration, and location
of the congestion.

236
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
8.4.1 Functional Allocation
The satellite ATM network has to implement the Traffic Management
4.0 [210] with necessary modifications to suit the satellite links [219, 220].
Table 8.2 provides the major functions of traffic management. The real
challenge to the satellite ATM system designer is to decide where to
implement the traffic management functions, e.g., power hungry functions
like Usage Parameter Control (UPC) or Network Parameter Control (NPC)
and resource management, whether in payload or at the Network Control
Center (NCC). The satellite weight and power budgets dictate the functional
allocations to the payload versus the NCe. An example of traffic management
for ABR service using Virtual Source/Virtual Destination (VS/VD) is shown
in figure 8.3. VS/VD is further described in Section 8.6.

8.4.2 Traffic Parameters and QoS
One of the significant advantages of ATM technology is providing
OoS guarantees as described in the ATM Forum's Traffic Management
Specification [210]. The framework supports five service categories, namely
constant bit rate (CBR), real-time variable bit rate (rt-VBR), non-real-time
VBR (nrt-VBR), unspecified bit rate (UBR), and available bit rate (ABR),
with an additional one, guaranteed frame rate (GFR). These have been
discussed in Section
1.5. With the exception of UBR, all ATM service
categories require incoming traffic regulation to control network congestion
and ensure OoS guarantees. This function is done by access policing devices
to determine whether the traffic conforms to certain traffic characterizations.
The conformant cells are allowed to enter the ATM network and receive OoS
guarantees, where as the non-conformant cells will be either dropped or
tagged. Tagged cells may be allowed into the network but will not receive any
OoS guarantees. The other traffic management functions include Connection
Admission Control (CAC), traffic shaping, Usage Parameter Control (UPC),
resource management, priority control, cell discarding, and feedback controls.
Table 8.3 provides the various traffic parameters and the OoS parameters.

8.5 EXPLICIT RATE CONGESTION CONTROL FOR ABR
The explicit rate congestion control
for ABR service has been
reported widely in the literature and in Traffic Management specification 4.0
[22 1]. However, this scheme needs to be analyzed in terms of the end-to-end
delay requirements for satellite-ATM networks [222, 223]. The ABR service
periodically
advises
sources about
the
rate
at which
they should
be
transmitting. The switches compute the available bandwidth and divide it
fairly among active YCs. The feedback from the switches to the sources is
indicated in Resource Management (RM) cells. The RM cells are periodically
sent by the sources and turned around by the destinati ons.
The RM cells contain the Current Cell Rate (CCR) of the source, in
addition to several fields that can be used by the switches to provide feedback
to the sources. One of those fields, the Explicit Rate (ER) field, indicates the
rate that the network can support at that time. Each switch on the path of the
YC reduces the ER field to the maximum rate it can support. The sources
examine the returning RM cells and adjust their transmission rates. The
Explicit Rate Indicator Algorithm (ERICA) and ERICAÂ· algorithms have
been proposed and well documented for terrestrial ATM switches [224, 2I0].

SatelliteATM: Technical Challenges
239
This feedback mechanism implementation for satellite ATM involves delay
performance impacts.
8.6
VIRTUAL
SOURCE/VIRTUAL
(VS/VD) ALGORITHM FOR ABR
DESTINATION
In the long propagation delay satellite configurations, the feedback
delay is the dominant factor (over round trip time) in determining the
maximum queue length. A feedback delay of 10 ms corresponds to about
3670 cells of queue for TCP over ERICA, while a feedback delay of 550 ms
corresponds to 20 I,850 cells. This indicates that satellite switches need to
provide at least one feedback delay worth of buffering to avoid loss on these
high delay paths. Satellite switches can isolate downstream switches from
such
large queues
by
implementing Virtual
Source/Virtual
Destination
(VS/VD) options. [225].
VS/VD option allows a switch to divide an ABR connection into
separately controlled ABR segments. On one segment, the switch behaves as
a destination end system, i.e., it receives data and turns around resource
management (RM) cells (which carry rate feedback) to the source end system.
On the other segment the switch behaves as a source end system, i.e., it
controls the transmission rate of every Virtual Circuit (VC) and schedules the
sending of data and RM cells. Such a switch is called "VS/VD switch". In
effect, the end-to-end control is replaced by segment-by-segment control as
shown in figure 8.4.

One advantage of the segment-by-segment control is that it isolates
different networks from each other. An example is the interface point between
a satellite network and a LAN. The gateway switches at the edge of a satellite

240
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
network can implement VSIVD to isolate downstream workgroup switches
from the effects ofthe long delay satellite paths (like long queues).
A second
advantage of segment-by-segment control
is that the
segments have
shorter feedback
loops, which
can potentially improve
performance because feedback is given faster to the sources whenever new
traffic bursts are seen. The VSIVD option requires the implementation of per-
VC queuing and scheduling at the switch. But if per-VC queuing and
scheduling are already in place, the incremental cost to implement VSIVD is
small.

VSIVD can effectively isolate nodes in different VSIVD loops. As a
result, the buffer requirements of a node are bound by the feedback delay-
bandwidth product of the upstream VSIVD loop. VSIVD helps to reduce the
buffer requirements of terrestrial switches connected to satellite gateways.
Figure 8.5 illustrates the results of a simulation experiment showing the effect

SatelliteATM: Technical Challenges
241
of VSND on the buffer requirements of terrestrial switch S. In the figure, the
link between S and the end host is the bottleneck link. The feedback delay-
bandwidth product of the satellite hop is about 160,000 cells, and dominates
the feedback delay-bandwidth product of the terrestrial hop (about 3000
cells). Without VSND, terrestrial switch S, a bottleneck, must buffer cells of
up to the feedback delay-bandwidth product of the entire control
loop
(including the satellite hop). With a VSND loop between the satellite and the
terrestrial switch, the queue accumulation due to the satellite feedback delay
is confined to the satellite switch. The terrestrial switch only buffers cells that
are accumulated due to the feedback delay of the terrestrial link to the satellite
switch.
Part Four provides buffer requirements for handling TCP over
satellite network supporting UBR. Several TCP mechanisms e.g., .Vanilla,
Reno, and SACK and cell discard policies e.g., EPD, SD are used to study the
parameter impact and parameter interactions to achieve rate utilization and
fairness in the satellite network . The results are discussed in Part Four.
8.7 SATELLITE ATM SECURITY
For satellite ATM transport ATM Forum has defined four security
services. [226]
User plane security: The user plane security defines the mechanisms
to allow for secure communication between nodes in an ATM network, which
can
be
subdivided
into
entity
authentication,
key
exchange,
data
confidentiality, data integrity, and access control. Either the two-way or three-
way Security Message Exchange (SME) protocols may be used to establish
these services. These SMEs can be signaling or inband based. Security
negotiation parameters can only be exchanged using the three-way SME. For
unicast connections, either the three-way SME or two-way SME can be used
to set up security associations. For the first leaf of multicast connection, either
two-way or three-way SME can be used but for subsequent leaves only two-
way SME can be used. For data confidentiality service the ATM cell-level
approach is used to encrypt the payload, and the header is left in the clear. The
data integrity service is provided at the ATM Adaptation Layer (AAL) level.
Once the connection is established, keys for integrity and confidentiality
services are negotiated using the three-way or two-way SME. However, when
a key
is used
to provide
confidentiality and
integrity protection, the
probability of successfully cracking the key increases with time. To prevent
such an attack from being successful, keys must be changed periodically. To
this end, a 'session key update' procedure has been defined to support
periodic key changeover. This procedure uses a master key, which is used to

242
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
encrypt short-lived session keys; these in turn are used for a period oftime for
integrity and confidentiality services. The master key and first session key are
exchanged during initial security negotiation. However, subsequent session
keys must be transferred in the data channel so that the receiver may load and
start using them at the appropriate time.
Control plane security: The control plane defines the call control
signaling needed to establish, maintain and close a certain Virtual Connection
(VC). Thus, authentic signaling has been defined as the main target of control
plane security for any endpoint-to-endpoint, switch-to-switch, or endpoint-to-
switch signaling communication.
Support
services : The
support
services define
the
certification
infrastructures, the key exchange mechanisms, and the basic negotiation of
security requirements and capabilities.
Management plane security: The management plane is responsible for
both performing management functions for the system as a whole (plane
management), and for performing network and system management functions
such as resource management (layer management).
ATM Forum specifications address the security issues in terrestrial
fixed network only. Considerable research has to be done addressing ATM
security in a satellite environment, which has high bursty error rates. It is
important to investigate the encryption algorithms for high link data rates.
8.8 TECHNICAL CHALLENGES SUMMARY
Future satellite communication networks are intended to provide
global connectivity and regional access . One of the main applications driving
the system designs is high speed Internet access for bandwidth rich streaming
applications. Many planned connectivity (end-to-end) systems using Ka-band
employ onboard processing and fast packet switching or packet forwarding.
These
new
system
architectures
enhance
flexibility
and
efficiency of
operation but increase the implementation complexity. Several regional
broadband Internet access systems use bent pipe satellites. Interactive IP
satellite networks propose to use MF-TDMA based DVB-RCS return channel
protocols. Both, broadband global and regional systems propose to service
multimedia applications, which dictates the provisioning of QoS. In addition,
these future systems must also develop Business and Operation Support
Sytems (BSS/OSS) to provide the necessary customer care, performance
management, and congestion control as described in Chapter 3. A system
engineering methodology described in Chapter 3 is to be developed for
selecting

satellite network, a number of technical challenges described in Chapter 6-8
must be addressed. The various issues discussed include:

Quality of Service in IP Networks
10.1 INTRODUCTION
Quality of Service
(QoS) describes the guaranteed
delivery of
applications based on the low delay and packet loss requirements. A set of
Service Level Agreements (SLAs) normally specify the QoS requirements as
described in Chapter 5. QoS is delivered by restricting the total amount of
traffic competing for the same amount of resources if the ingress traffic
exceeds the minimum capacity of the network. The network capacity is
effectively proportioned by the packet prioritization, so that higher priority
traffic is unaffected by the lower-priority traffic. QoS guarantees can be made
either over an aggregate of communication associations or individual flows.
QoS is assured by reserving resources such as bandwidth and buffer space
[238].
Applications
differ
in
their
QoS
requirements.
Most
of the
applications are loss sensitive, while data applications can recover from
packet loss through retransmissions. Packet losses of about 5% generally lead
to very poor effective throughput. Data applications such as file transfer are
not generally delay sensitive. Applications such as streaming audio and video
require fixed bandwidth.
Recently,
QoS
over
satellite
IP networks
has
attracted
many
researchers [239, 240, 212, 241]. Currently, the proposed QoS mechanisms
include IntServ [142, 143] with RSVP [136], DiffServ, and MPLS [140] as
discussed in Chapter 7. It is crucial to assess whether the QoS mechanisms
addressed for terrestrial networks can be applied to satellite networks and
what are the QoS architctures for satellite networks [242]. In this chapter, we
address the issue of satellite IP QoS architectures.

10.2 IP QOS CLASSES
A workable QoS architecture must provide a means for specifying
performance objectives for different types of packets as well as a means of
delivering on those performance objectives.
To
give
different
packets
different
treatment,
the
network
infrastructure must be capable of distinguishing between packets by means of
classification, queuing packets separately as a result of the classification,
scheduling packet queues to implement the differential treatment, providing
means for measuring, monitoring, and conditioning packet streams to meet
requirements of different QoS levels. These can be realized through the
implementation of mechanisms in the packet forwarding path. The number of
ways in which a packet can be treated in the forwarding path is limited.
Aggregating individual flows according to their common packet forwarding
treatment leads to a reduction of state and complexity. The mechanisms of the
forwarding path must be amenable to high-speed implementations and easily
composable.
ITU-T
Study Group
13 developed an
ITU-T Recommendation
Y.1541 for developing the IP end-to-end performance objectives within a
defined set of six QoS classes for IP-based networks. The QoS classes are
specifically intended for data and for real-time applications including voice.

10.3 IP QOS PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES
257
The six QoS classes defined by ITU-T [22] are intended to be basis of
agreement between end users and network service providers and between
service providers. These QoS objectives are applicable when access link
speeds are at TI or E I rate or higher. Table 10.2 provides the provisional IP
QoS class definitions and network performance objectives. These require to
be evaluated for satellite transport. The network performance parameters
include:
â€¢
IP Packet Transfer Delay (IPTD): End-to-end delay (mean one-way)
between the measurement points (MPs) at the source and destination.
â€¢
IP Packet Delay Variation (lPDV)
IPDV = IPTDmax - IPTDmin
where
IPTDmax
is
the
maximum
IPTO
recorded
during
a
measurement interval and IPTOmin is the minimum IPTO recorded
during a measurement interval.
â€¢
IP Packet Loss Ratio (IPLRj: Ratio oftotal lost IP packet outcomes to
total transmitted IP packets in a population of interest. A lost packet
outcome occurs when a packet is never delivered or delivered to an
unpermitted (not allowed) egress MP, and IPOV is not compensated
by the dejitter buffer.
â€¢
IP Packet Error Ratio (IPERj : Ratio of total errored IP packets to
total transmitted IP packets in a population of interest.
10.3.1 Satellite IP QoS Objectives
The use of geostationary satellites was considered during the study of
the Hypothetical Reference Paths (HRPs). A single geostationary satellite can
be used within the HRPs and still achieve end-to-end objectives on the
assumption that it replaces significant terrestrial distance, multiple IP nodes,
and/or transit network sections. The use of low- and medium-Earth orbit
satellites was not considered in connection with these HRPs.
When a path contains a satellite hop, this portion will require an IPTO
of 320 ms, to account for low earth station viewing angle, low rate TOMA
systems, or both. In the case of a satellite possessing onboard processing
capabilities, 330 ms of IPTD is needed, to account for onboard processing and
packet queuing delays.

It is expected that most HRPs, which include a geostationary satellite,
will achieve IPTD below 400 ms. however, in some cases the value of400 ms
may be exceeded. For very long paths to remote areas, network providers may
need to make additional bilateral agreements to improve the probability of
achieving the 400 ms objective.
10.4 IP QOSMECHANISMS REVISITED
The current Internet infrastructure treats all IP packets equally on a
best effort basis. There is also no possibility of controlling packet delays,
neither between packets nor end-to-end. Forwarding decisions are made hop
by hop. There is no guarantee that packets belonging to the same application
get routed across the same path.
This approach has worked well, so far, for most data applications.
The performance of delay and delay variation (jitter) sensitive applications
such as voice and video over the Internet has been poor. However, the
performance of the same applications in a controlled environment such as test
beds or Internet has been acceptable. This indicates the ability of IP to support
multimedia applications, provided
that sufficient network resources are
available. The use of ATM as the transport network infrastructure allows for

Quality of Service in IP Networks
259
the control of end-to-end jitter and delay variation [243]. Standards have been
in place to transport IP using ATM. However supporting different application
segments
will
involve
more
than just mapping
IP services
to
UBR
connections [244].
10.4.1 Integrated Services (IntServ)
IntServ is a per-flow based QoS framework with dynamic resource
reservation. In this, routers need to reserve resources in order to provide
quantifiable QoS for specific traffic flows. Resource Reservation Protocol
(RSVP) is the signaling protocol for application to reserve network resources.
It adopts a receiver-initiated reservation style, which is designed for a
multicast environment and accommodates heterogeneous receiver service
needs.
The IntServ architecture adds two service classes to the existing best-
effort model - guaranteed service and controlled load service. Guaranteed
service [142] provides an upper bound on end-to-end queuing delay and is
aimed to support applications with hard real-time requirements. Controlled-
load service [143] provides a quality of service similar to best-effort service in
an underutilized network, with almost no loss and delay and is aimed to share
the aggregate bandwidth among multiple traffic streams in a controlled way
under overload conditions.
IntServ can deliver fine-grained QoS guarantees by using per-flow
resource reservation. Introducing flow-specific states to routers means a
fundamental change to the current Internet architecture, especially in the
Internet backbone where it will be difficult for the router to maintain a
separate queue for each ofthe hundred thousand flows, which may be present.
RSVP transmits request information for a QoS-enabled connection
with RSVP PATH and RESV messages as described in Section 7.2. Within
such PATH and RESV messages, certain values are used to represent traffic
and requested QOS parameters that enable a sender and receiver to establish
service quality parameters for a given flow.
The
sender Tspec (T
representing traffic)
specifies
parameters
available for the flow. Both senders and receivers use Tspec (SenderTspec
and ReceiverTspec, respectively). The FLOWSPEC specifies requested QOS
parameters, and is used by the receiver in RESV messages . The Adspec (ad
for advertisement) enables QOS-enabled network devices in the path between
sender
and
receiver
to
advertise
their
service
capabilities,
resource
availability, and transmission characteristics.

260
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
10.4.2 Differentiated Services (DiffServ)
Diff'Serv [138, 139] has been proposed by IETF with scalability as the
main goal. It is a per-aggregate-c1ass based service discrimination framework
using packet tagging. Packet tagging uses bits in the packet header to mark a
packet for preferential treatment. The type-of-service (ToS) byte is used to
mark packets in IPv4. The ToS byte consists of a 3-bit precedence field, 4-bit
field indicating requests for minimum delay, maximum throughput, maximum
reliability, and minimum cost, and one unused bit. DiffServ redefines this
byte as the DS field. Six bits of the DS fields form the DiffServ Code Point
(DSCP) and the remaining two bits are unused.
DiffServ uses DSCP to select per-hop behavior (PHB) a packet
experiences at each node. A PHB is packet forwarding treatment specified in
a relative format compared to other PHBs, such as relative weight for sharing
bandwidth or relative priority for dropping. Before a packet enters a DiffServ
domain, its DSCP field is marked by the end-host or the first-hop router
according to the service quality the packet requires. Within the IntServ
domain, each router only looks at DSCP and decides, without needing
complex classification or per-flow state, how the packet is to be treated .
Table 10.3 provides a comparison of the IntServ and DiffServ
mechanisms.

10.4.2.1 Queue Management
261
A buffer is a physical block of memory, while a queue is a collection
of packets waiting in buffers for processing. Queuing algorithms determine
how queues are processed.
Packets may arrive at queues in bursts for multiple devices, and a
device may temporarily receive more packets than it can process. Buffers hold
packets until a device can catch up, and if the device cannot do so, buffers fill
up and new incoming packets are dropped . This is called 'tail drop'.
Queue
management
schemes
alleviate
congestion.
Packets
are
dropped when .necessary or appropriate. Scheduling algorithms determine
which packet to send next in order to manage and prioritize the allocation of
bandwidth among the flows.
Queue management is a part of packet classification and QoS
schemes, in which flows are identified and classified, and then placed in
queues that provide appropriate service levels. Packet scheduler, an important
part of queue management, uses queues to forward different packet streams.
Other components include the classifier, which identifies and maps packets
into queues. Packets of the same class are put into the same queues, where
they receive the same treatment by the packet scheduler.
Multiple access networks such as intranets and the Internet are
referred to as 'network of queues'. In a point-to-point link, the receiver
monitors its own queues and signals the sender when it is sending too fast. In
packet-switched networks with many senders transmitting at any time, it is
impossible to predict traffic levels. Some parts of the network may become
more congested than others. The solution is to place queues throughout the
network to absorb bursts from one or more senders.
Queuing Disciplines
Basic
queuing techniques
are
described
below. The
following
questions are normally addressed :
â€¢
How are incoming packets placed into queues?
â€¢
What is the order/or method in which the networking device services
its queues?
â€¢
What are the strategies for dealing with bursts of traffic and queues
that overflow?
There
are several queuing methods,
including First-in, first-out
(FIFO), priority queuing, and fair queuing [245]. FIFO is common in all the

262
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
queuing schemes, as it describes the basic method in which packets flow
through queues.
FIFO queuing: This is the basic first-in, first-out queuing technique in
which the first packet in the queue is the first packet that is processed. When
queues become full, congestion occurs and incoming packets are dropped .
FIFO relies on end systems to control congestion via congestion control
mechanisms.
Priority queuing: This technique uses multiple queues, but queues are
serviced with different levels of priority, with the highest priority queues
being serviced first. When congestion occurs, packets are dropped from
lower-priority queues. The only problem with this method is that lower-
priority queues may not get serviced at all if high-priority traffic is excessive.
Packets are classified and placed into queues according to information in the
packets. For example, routers can be programmed to prioritize traffic for a
particular port into high-, medium-, or low-priority queues. Priority schemes
may be abused by users or applications that mark packets with priorities that
are not allowed. Admission control functions can monitor this.
Fair queuing: This method helps solve the problem where some
queues may not get serviced because high-priority queues are being serviced.
A round-robin approach is used to service all queues in a fair way. This
prevents anyone source from overusing its share of network capacity.
Problems can occur when packets are variable in length and each queue is
allowed to release one packet at a time. Some queues will take more time. A
byte-oriented scheme may be used to equalize the queues. In addition, some
queues may be more full than others and hence need more service, but a strict,
fair queuing scheme will service each queue equally.
Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQJ: This can be seen as a combination of
priority queuing and fair queuing. All queues are serviced so that none are
starved, but some queues are serviced more than others. A weight is applied to
queues to give some queues higher priority. For example, one queue may get
half the available bandwidth and other queues will get an allocation of the
remaining bandwidth. Traffic
may
be prioritized
according to
packet
markings,
source and destination
IP address
fields, port numbers, and
information in the TOS field. WFQ weights traffic so that low-bandwidth
traffic gets a fair level of priority. If high-priority queues are not in use,
lower-priority traffic uses its queues . This prevents high-bandwidth traffic
from grabbing an unfair share ofresources.
Class-Based Queuing (CBQ): CBQ is a class-based algorithm that
schedules packets in queues and guarantees a certain transmission rate. If a
queue is not in use, the bandwidth is made available to other queues . A CBQ-

Quality of Service in IP Networks
263
compliant device looks deep in packets to classify packets according to
addresses, application type, protocol, URL, or other information. CBQ is
more than a queuing scheme. It is also a QoS scheme that identifies different
types of traffic and queues the traffic accordingto predefinedparameters.
Generally, delay-sensitive traffic will be serviced sooner, and loss-
sensitive traffic will be given larger buffers. The loss behavior can also be
controlled using various forms of Random Early Detection (RED). These
disciplines using probabilistic methods to start dropping packets when certain
queue thresholds are crossed, in order to increase the probability that higher-
quality packets can be buffereda the expense of moredispensablepackets.
RED is a congestion avoidance algorithm that detects congestion and
keeps the average queue length in a region of low delay and high throughput.
During congestion, when routers drop packets, it is very likely that the
dropped packets belong to many different connections. By detecting
congestion and notifying only a randomly selected fraction of users, RED
avoids congestion and the global synchronization problem. It also avoids bias
against burstyconnections. [246]
RED utilizes two thresholds, T10w and Thigh If the average queue
length is below the lower threshold, the algorithm is in the normal operation
zone and all packets are accepted. If it is above the higher threshold, RED is
in the congestion control region and all incoming packets are dropped. If it is
between both thresholds, RED is in the congestion avoidance region and the
packets are discarded within a certain probability P, which is increased by two
factors - by the counter which maintains number of packets in queue and as
the average queue length approaches the higher threshold. The algorithm
computes an intermediate probability Pb, whose maximal value Pmax is
reached when the average queue length is equal to Thigh. For a constant
average queue length, all incoming packets have the same probability to get
dropped. As a result, RED drops packets in proportion to the connection's
share of the bandwidth.

10.4.3 Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
The third architecture proposed by the .IETF for provisioning QoS is
Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS). MPLS attempts to set up paths in a
network along which packets that carry appropriate labels can be forwarded
very efficiently (i.e., the forwarding engine would not look at the entire packet
header, rather only at the label and use that to forward the packet). Not only
does this allow packets to be forwarded more quickly, it allows the paths to be
set up in a variety of ways: the path could represent the normal destination-
based routing path, it could represent a policy-based explicit route, or it could
represent a reservation-based flow path. Ingress routers classify incoming
packets and wrap them in an MPLS header that carries the appropriate label
for forwarding by the interior routers.
In the MPLS model, the labels are distributed by a dynamic Label
Distribution Protocol (LOP), which effectively sets up a Label Switched Path
(LSP) along the Label Switched Routers (LSR). The LOP could be driven off
destination-based routing (e.g., OSPF) or from reservation requests (e.g.,
RSVP) or some other policy-based explicit route. In some sense, LOP is
creating label state in the network, but this is not so different from the normal
forwarding tables created by routing protocols. It is important to note that this
label state is not per packet or per flow, but usually represents some aggregate
(e.g., between some source-destination pair). Therefore, the state produced by
MPLS is manageable and scalable. [140, 141]
The MPLS model is compatible with the DiffServ model. The ingress
routers can use service profiles to assign labels to packets. The LSPs could
represent provisioned paths inside the networks, and the labels carried in
MPLS headers can be used to differentiate packets. The drop precedence of
the packet can also be indicated in the MPLS header. It has also been
proposed to use RSVP as the LOP so that a single protocol can be used for
setting up various types of LSPs, including destination-based, policy-based,

265
and reservation-based paths. MPLS traffic engineering applied to satellite
network is described in Chapter 12.
10.5 ARCHITECTURAL ALTERNATIVES
The current Internet treats all IP packets equally on a best effort basis.
The
data
applications,
which
are
not
delay
sensitive,
might
receive
satisfactory performance. But the performance for delay sensitive applications
such as voice and video over satellite Internet has been poor. To improve the
QoS performance for multimedia applications over the terrestrial Internet,
three different approaches have been proposed [247]. As discussed in Chapter
4, many satellite systems are currently supporting Internet applications and
more satellite networks are being planned and developed to support Internet in
the future. However, there are no current QoS provisioning architecture
standards for the support of multimedia services over satellite [248].
This
section
proposes
three
QoS
architectures
for
satellite
IP
networks. These architectures are:
â€¢
Architecture 1: Integrated Services (lntServ) based model.
â€¢
Architecture 2: Differentiated Services (DiffServ) based model.
â€¢
Architecture 3: IntServ/DiffServ/Aggregate RSVP based model.

The terminal TI and the hosts connected to it are RSVP capable. An
application sends a PATH message requesting Guaranteed Services (GS) for
example, from the Network I. The terminal TI
upon receiving PATH
message indicating a GS service request, registers RSVP flow and modifies
Adspec. The terminal performs the Call Admission Control and determines
whether the call can be accepted as specified. If the call is accepted, the
PATH message reaches the destination terminal T2. Terminal T2 participates
in RSVP, registers the flow, modifies Adspec and forwards PATH.
The edge router ER2 forwards the PATH message to the destination
host. The edge routers have to perform multifield flow classification, and
maintain flow state. PATH message is created and sent back to the sender in
the reverse path.
In a terrestrial network, RSVP has to be implemented in all routers
along the path to achieve end-to-end QOS, which
is difficult from an
implementation point of view. In a satellite IP network, end-to-end IntServ
QoS architecture is feasible because the packets flow through a router in a
bent pipe or regenerative satellite network bypassing several routers in a
terrestrial backbone.

10.7 SATELLITE IP QOS ARCHITECTURE 2: DIFFSERV
A DiffServ enabled host in the DiffServ domain labels the traffic
according to the service needed. Each type of service has an associated
Service Level Agreement (SLA) between two entities. In DiffServ the ingress
and egress nodes have the function of making sure that the traffic is compliant
with SLA .

Figure 10.3 shows an end-to-end QoS architecture for satellite IP
network. This architecture assumes that the terminals TI and T2 are DiffServ
capable. There is a SLA between Network I and Network 2. The SLA allows
the user to have its traffic labeled as highest priority within the Assured
Forwarding class.
As an example, if the Network 2 is the Internet Service Provider (ISP)
and T2 is the gateway, then a SLA exists between Network I and the gateway
(SLA I) and another SLA exists between the gateway and the ISP (SLA2).
Non-compliant traffic can be treated in many ways. It can be dropped,

The terminals Tl and T2 are DiffServ capable and also Aggregate
RSVP capable. IETF proposed the Aggregate RSVP. [249].
Aggregate RSVP is an extension to RSVP developed to enable
reservation to be made for an aggregation of flows between edges of a
network region, rather than for individual flows as supported by the version of
RSVP. Aggregate RSVP
is a protocol
proposed to the aggregation of
individual RSVP reservations that cross an "aggregation region" and share
common ingress and egress routers with one RSVP reservation from ingress
to egress.
The end-to-end RSVP messaging is performed between Network I
and Network 2. The ingress and egress routers ER1 and ER2 dynamically
create the aggregate reservations and classify the traffic to which the
aggregate reservation applies. They also determine how much bandwidth is
needed to achieve the requirement and recover the bandwidth when the
individual
reservations
are no
longer
required.
The
end-to-end
RSVP
messages indicate what DSCP should be used for each flow.
When an end-to-end RSVP request cannot be met by the existing
aggregate allocations between ERl and ER2, aggregate RSVP is used to
request new aggregation allocation or to modify the existing allocations.

Terminals Tl and T2 process the aggregate RSVP messages and perform the

10.8.1 Access Network Example
In figure 10.4, T2 is replaced by a gateway and Network 2 by an ISP. There
exists a DiffServ SLA I between TI and gateway, and a different DiffServ
SLA2 between gateway and Network 2. DiffServ flows arriving at the
gateway from multiple networks are further aggregated to DiffServ service
classes between the gateway and the ISP. Aggregate RSVP messaging
between network I and the gateway controls bandwidth between T I and the
gateway (GW) . A separate aggregate flow between GW and the ISP controls
bandwidth between the GW and ISP. SLA between Network I and the GW
can be changed dynamically based on RSVP signaling.
10.9 ARCHITECTURES COMPARISON
Architectures I and 2 based on IntServ and DiffServ respectively are
the simplest to implement at the terminals and gateways (for satellite access
network). They provide end-to-end QoS.
Architecture 3 is a scalable architecture. It provides an end-to-end
QoS with dynamic aggregate RSVP reservations. However, this aggregate
RSVP has not been widely deployed in terrestrial environment. Considering
the advantages of the aggregate RSVP as opposed to individual flow RSVP,
this architecture 3 could be a compromise between architecture 1 which is
entirely IntServ based and architecture 2, which is entirely DiffServ, based.

Performance results can be seen in [250] using the aggregate RSVP and
DiffServ in a satellite network.

11.1 INTRODUCTION
Satellite based Internet service is receiving great interest by the users
and service providers. Dynamic bandwidth allocation to provide application

This
differentiation may either be quantitative or relative. DiffServ is scalable as
traffic classification and conditioning is performed only at network boundary
nodes. The service to be received by a particular traffic is marked as a code
point in the DS field in the IPv4 and IPv6 header. The DiffServ Code Point
(DSCP) in the header of an IP packet is used to determine the Per-Hop
Behavior (PHB), i.e. the forwarding treatment it will receive at a network
node. Currently, formal specification is available for two PHBs - Assured

used for data applications and TCP performance has been extensively studied.

precedences required (one, two or three), (b) percentage of reserved (highest

Drop with different parameters), and (d) traffic types (TCP aggregates, UDP

(audio/video) performance using UDP.
11.2 DIFFSERV QOS
The Differentiated Services approach is selected for satellite IP QoS
because satellite systems are designed to support aggregate traffic; scalable
solutions are preferred . It is simpler to implement DiffServ in an integrated
satellite and terrestrial environment. DiffServ pushes the complexity to the
edge, hence, satellite networks with limited onboard processing and switching
favor DiffServ approach .
In Expedited Forwarding (EF) [255], a transit node uses policing and
shaping mechanisms to ensure that the maximum arrival rate of a traffic
aggregate is less than its minimum departure rate. At each transit node, the
minimum departure rate of a traffic aggregate should be configurable and
independent of other traffic at the node. Such a per-hop behavior results in
minimum delay and jitter and can be used to provide an end-to-end 'Virtual
Leased Line' type of service.
In Assured Forwarding (AF) [256], IP packets are classified as
belonging to one of four traffic classes. IP packets assigned to different traffic
classes are forwarded independent of one other. Each traffic class is assigned
a minimum configurable amount of resources (link bandwidth and buffer
space). Resources not being currently used by another PHS or an AF traffic
class can optionally be used by remaining classes. Within a traffic class, a
packet is assigned one of three levels of drop precedence (green, yellow, red).
In case of congestion, an AF compliant DiffServ node drops low precedence
(red) packets in preference to higher precedence (green, yellow) packets.
Multiple levels of drop precedence can be used to mitigate the effect of round
trip time on TCP flows and to achieve fair allocation of excess network
bandwidth among congestion-sensitive TCP and insensitive UDP flows.

Performance of DiffServ Based Satellite IP
275
The key factors that affect the satellite network performance are those
relating to bandwidth management, buffer management, traffic types and their
treatment, and network configuration.
Bandwidth Management: Bandwidth management relates to the
algorithms and parameters that affect service (PHB) given to a particular
aggregate. In particular, the number of drop precedence (one, two, or three)
and the level of reserved traffic were identified as the key factors in this
analysis.
Buffer Management: Buffer management relates to the method of
selecting packets to be dropped when the buffers are full. Two commonly
used methods are tail drop and random early drop (RED). Several variations
of RED are possible in case ofmultiple drop precedence.
Traffic Types: Two traffic types that are considered here are TCP and
UDP aggregates. TCP and UDP were separated out because of their different
response to packet losses. In particular, it was a concern that if excess TCP
and excess UDP were both given the same treatment, TCP flows will reduce
their rates on packet drops while UDP flows will not change and get the entire
excess bandwidth. The analysis shows that this is in fact the case and that it is
important to give a better treatment to excess TCP than excess UDP.
Network Configuration: A simple configuration of GEO and MEO
satellite network configuration is assumed for the simulation study.
The following QoS issues are addressed in the simulation study:
â€¢
Three
drop
precedence
(green, yellow,
and
red)
help
clearly
distinguish between congestion sensitive and insensitive flows.
â€¢
The reserved bandwidth should not be overbooked, this it, the sum
should be less than the bottleneck link capacity. If the network
operates close to its capacity, three levels of drop precedence are
redundant as there is not much excess bandwidth to be shared.
â€¢
The excess congestion sensitive (TCP) packets should be marked as
yellow while the excess congestion insensitive (UDP) packets should
be marked red.
â€¢
The RED parameters have significant effect on the performance, The
optimal setting of RED parameters is an area for further research.

276
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
11.3 BUFFER MANAGEMENT CLASSIFICATIONS
Buffer management techniques help identify which packets should be
dropped when the queues exceed a certain threshold. It is possible to place
packets in one queue or multiple queues depending upon their color or flow
type. For the threshold, it is possible to keep a single threshold on packets in
all queues or to keep multiple thresholds. Thus, the accounting (queues) could
be single or multiple and the threshold could be single or multiple. These
choices lead to four classes of buffer management techniques:
â€¢
Single Accounting, Single Threshold (SAST)
â€¢
Single Accounting, Multiple Threshold (SAMT)
â€¢
Multiple Accounting, Single Threshold (MAST)
â€¢
Multiple Accounting, Multiple Threshold (MAMT)
Random Early Discard (RED) is a well known and now commonly
implemented packet drop policy. It has been shown that RED performs better
and provides better fairness than the tail drop policy. In RED, the drop
probability of a packet depends on the average queue length, which is an
exponential average of instantaneous queue length at the time of the packet's
arrival [257]. The drop probability increases linearly from 0 to max_p as
average queue length increases from min_th to maxth. With packets of
multiple colors, one can calculate average queue length in many ways and
have multiple sets of drop thresholds for packets of different colors . In
general , with multiple colors, RED policy can be implemented as a variant of
one of four general categories: SAST, SAMT, MAST, and MAMT.
Single Average Single Threshold RED has a single average queue
length and same min_th and max_th thresholds for packets of all colors . Such
a policy does not distinguish between packets of different colors and can also
be called color blind RED. In Single Average Multiple Thresholds RED,
average queue length is based on total number of packets in the queue
irrespective of their color. However, packets of different colors have different
drop thresholds. For example, if maximum queue size is 60 packets, the drop
thresholds for green, yellow and red packets can be {40/60, 20/40, O/IO} . In
these simulations, Single Average Multiple Thresholds RED is used.
In Multiple Average Single/Multiple Threshold RED, average queue
length for packets of different colors is calculated differently. For example,
average queue length for a color can be calculated using number of packets in
the queue with same or better color [139]. In such a scheme, average queue
length for green, yellow and red packets will be calculated using number of
green, yellow + green, red + yellow + green packets in the queue respectively.
Another possible scheme is where average queue length for a color is
calculated using number of packets of that color in the queue. In such a case,

Performance of DiffServ Based Satellite IP
277
average queue length for green, yellow and red packets will be calculated
using number of green, yellow and red packets in the queue respectively.
Multiple Average Single Threshold RED will have same drop thresholds for
packets of all colors whereas Multiple Average Multiple Threshold RED will
have different drop thresholds for packets of different colors.
11.4 SIMULATION CONFIGURATION AND PARAMETERS
Figure 11.1 shows the network configuration for simulations. The
configuration consists of customers I through 10 sending data over the link
between Routers 1, 2 and using the same AF traffic class. Router 1 is located
in a satellite ground station. Router 2 is located in a GEO, MEa or LEO
satellite and Router 3 is located in destination ground station. Traffic is one-
dimensional with only ACKs coming back from the other side. Customers 1
through 9 carry an aggregated traffic coming from 5 Reno TCP sources each.
Customer 10 gets its traffic from a single UDP source sending data at a rate of
1.28 Mbps. Common configuration parameters are detailed in tables 11.1,
11.2 and 11.3. All TCP and UDP packets are marked green at the source
before being 'recolored' by a traffic conditioner at the customer site. The
traffic conditioner consists of two 'leaky' buckets (green and yellow) that
mark packets according to their token generation rates (called reserved/green
and yellow rate). In two-color simulations, yellow rate of all customers is set
to zero. Thus, in two-color simulations, both UDP and TCP packets will be
colored either green or red. In three-color simulations, customer 10 (the UDP
customer) always has a yellow rate of O. Thus, in three-color simulations,
TCP packets coming from customers
I through 9 can be colored green,
yellow or red and UDP packets coming from customer 10 will be colored
green or red. All the traffic coming to Router I passes through a Random
Early Drop (RED) queue. The RED policy implemented at Router I can be
classified as Single Average Multiple Threshold RED as explained in the
following paragraphs.
NS simulator version 2.1 has been used for these simulations. The
code has been modified to implement the traffic conditioner and multi-color
RED (RED_n). [258]
11.4.1 GEO Simulation Configuration
In this study, full factorial simulations involving many factors are
performed:
Green Traffic Rates: Green traffic rate is the token generation rate of
green bucket in the traffic conditioner. Green rates of 12.8, 25.6, 38.4 and

278
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
76.8 kbps per customer have been experimented with. These rates correspond
to a total of 8.5%, 17.1%, 25.6%'and 51.2% of network capacity (1.5 Mbps).
In order to understand the effect of green traffic rate, simulations with green
rates of 102.4, 128, 153.6 and 179.2 kbps for two color cases have been
conducted. These rates correspond to 68.3%, 85.3%, 102.4% and 119.5% of
network capacity respectively. In the last two cases, the available network
bandwidth is oversubscribed.

with. These rates correspond to 7.7% and 77% of total capacity (1.5 Mbps)
respectively. A high yellow rate of 128 kbps has been used so that all excess
(out of green rate) TCP packets are colored
yellow and thus can be
distinguished from excess UDP packets that are colored red.

Drop Thresholds for red colored packets: The network resources
allocated to red colored packets and hence the fairness results depend on the
drop thresholds for red packets. Different values of drop thresholds have been
experimented with for red colored packets so as to achieve close to best
fairness possible. Drop thresholds for green packets have been fixed at
{40,60} for both two and three color simulations. For three-color simulations,
yellow packet drop thresholds are {20,40}.
In these simulations, size of all queues is 60 packets of 576 bytes
each. The queue weight used to calculate RED average queue length is 0.002.
For easy reference, an identification number has been
given to each

11.4.2 Performance Metrics
Simulation results
have been evaluated
based on utilization of
reserved rates by the customers and the fairness achieved in allocation of
excess bandwidth among different customers.
Utilization of reserved rate by a customer is measured as the ratio of
green throughput of the customer and the reserved rate. Green throughput of a

Performance of DiffServ Based Satellite IP
281
customer is determined by the number of green colored packets received at
the traffic destination(s). Since in these simulations, the drop thresholds for
green packets are kept very high in the RED queue at Router 1, chances of a
green packet getting dropped are minimal and ideally green throughput of a
customer should equal its reservedrate.
The fairness in allocation of excess bandwidth among n customers sharing a
link can be computed using the followingformula [259]:
(I Y

where
Xi is the excess throughput of the ith customer. Excess
throughput of a customer is determined by the number of yellow and red

RESULTS
Simulation results of two and three color simulations are shown in
figure 11.2. In this figure, each simulation is identified by its simulation ID
listed in tables 11 .2 and 11.3. Figure 11.2 shows the fairness achieved in
allocation of excess bandwidth among ten customers for two-colors in GEO
architecture [260, 261]. Figure 11.3 shows simulation results of fairness
achieved for GEO networks for three colors with different reserved rates. It is
clear from Figures 11.2 and I 1.3 that fairness is not good in two-color
simulations. With three colors, there is a wide variation in fairness results
with best results being close to I. Note that fairness is zero in some of the two
color simulations. In these simulations, total reserved traffic uses all the
bandwidth and there is no excess bandwidth available to share. As shown,
there is a wide variation in reserved rate utilization by customers in two and
three color simulations.

11.~.2 Reserved Rate - Two-Color Vs Three-Color
Figure 11.4 shows reserved rate utilization by TCP customers in two
colors for GEO networks. Figure 11 .6 shows reserved rate utilization for TCP
customers in three colors, for GEO. For TCP customers, the average reserved
rate utilization in each simulation has been plotted. Note that in some cases,
reserved rate utilization is slightly more than one. This is because token
buckets are initially full which results in all packets getting green color in the
beginning. Figures 11.5 and 11.7 show that UDP customers have good
reserved rate utilization in almost all cases. In contrast, TCP customers show
a wide variation in reserved rate utilization.
In order to determine the influence of different simulation factors on
the reserved rate utilization and fairness achieved in excess bandwidth
distribution, simulation results are analyzed statistically using Analysis of
Variation (ANOVA) technique. A brief introduction to ANOVA technique
used in the analysis is provided in Section II .6. In later paragraphs, the results
of statistical analysis oftwo- and three-color simulations are presented.

Figure 11.7: CEO: reserved rate utilization by UDP customers in three-color simulations
11.6 ANALYSIS OF VARIATION (ANOVA) TECHNIQUE
The results of a simulation are affected by the values (or levels) of
simulation factors (e.g. green rate) and the interactions between levels of
different factors (e.g. green rate and green bucket size). The simulation factors
and their levels used in this simulation study are listed in tables 11.2 and 11 .3.
Analysis of Variation of simulation results is a statistical technique used to
quantify these effects . In this section, a brief account of Analysis of Variation
technique is presented. More details can be found in [259].
Analysis of Variation involves calculating the Total Variation in
simulation results around the Overall Mean and doing Allocation of Variation
to contributing factors and their interactions. Following steps describe the
calculations:
1.
Calculate the Overall Mean of all the values.
2.
Calculate the individual effect of each level a of factor A, called the Main
Effect of a:

Performance of DiffServ Based Satellite IP
287
Main Effect, = Mean, - Overall Mean
where, Main Effect, is the main effect of level a of factor A, Mean, is the
mean of all results with a as the value for factor A.
The main effects are calculated for each level of each factor.
3.
Calculate the First Order Interaction between levels a and b of two
factors A and B respectively for all such pairs:
Interaction.j, = Mean.], - (Overall Mean + Main Effect, + Main Effects)
where, Interaction.j, is the interaction between levels a and b of factors A
and B respectively, Mean.j, is mean of all results with a and b as values
for factors A and B, Main Effect, and Main Effect, are main effects of
levels a and b respectively.
4.
Calculate the Total Variation as shown below:
Total Variation = I(result2) - (Num_Sims) x (Overall Mean')
where, I(result2) is the sum of squares of all individual results and
Num Sims is total number of simulations.
5.
The next step is the Allocation of Variation to individual main effects and
first order interactions. To calculate the variation caused by a factor A, the
sum of squares of the main effects of all levels of A is taken and
multiplied with the number of experiments conducted with each level of
A. To calculate the variation caused by first order interaction between two
factors A and B, the sum of squares of all the first-order interactions
between levels of A and B is taken and multiplied with the number of
experiments conducted with each combination of levels of A and B. The
allocation of variation for each factor and first order interaction between
every pair of factors are calculated.
11.6.1 ANOVA Analysis for Reserved Rate Utilization
Table 11.5 shows the Allocation of Variation to contributing factors
for reserved rate utilization. As shown in figures 11.5 and 11.7, reserved rate
utilization of UDP customers is almost always good for both two and three
color simulations. However, in spite of very low probability of a green packet
getting dropped in the network, TCP customers are not able to fully utilize
their reserved rate in all cases. The little variation in reserved rate utilization
for UDP customers is explained largely by bucket size. Large bucket size
means that more packets will get green color in the beginning of the
simulation when green bucket is full. Green rate and interaction between
green rate and bucket size explain a substantial part of the variation. This is
because the
definition
of rate
utilization
metric has
reserved
rate
in
denominator. Thus, the part ofthe utilization coming from initially full bucket
gets more weight for low reserved rate than for high reserved rates. Also, in
two color simulations for reserved rates 153.6 kbps and 179.2 kbps, the
network is oversubscribed and hence in some cases UDP customer has a

288
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
reserved rate utilization lower than one. For TCP customers, green bucket size
is the main factor in determining reserved rate utilization. TCP traffic because
of its bursty nature is not able to fully utilize its reserved rate unless bucket
size is sufficiently high. In the current simulations, UDP customer sends data
at a uniform rate of 1.28 Mbps and hence is able to fully utilize its reserved
rate even when bucket size is low. However, TCP customers can have very
poor utilization of reserved rate if bucket size is not sufficient. The minimum
size of the leaky bucket required to fully utilize the token generation rate
depends on the burstiness of the traffic.
11.6.2 ANOVA Analysis for Fairness
Fairness results
shown
in figure
11.2 indicate that
fairness
in
allocation of excess network bandwidth is very poor in two-color simulations.
With two colors, excess traffic of TCP as well as UDP customers is marked
red and hence is given same treatment in the network. Congestion sensitive
TCP flows reduce their data rate in response to congestion created by UDP
flow. However, UDP flow keeps on sending data at the same rate as before.
Thus, UDP flow gets most of the excess bandwidth and the fairness is poor. In
three-color simulations, fairness results vary widely with fairness being good
in many cases. Table 11.4 shows the important factors influencing fairness in
three-color simulations as determined by ANOYA analysis. Yellow rate is the
most important factor in determining fairness in three-color simulations. With
three colors, excess TCP traffic can be colored yellow and thus distinguished
from excess
UDP traffic, which
is colored
red. Network can
protect
congestion sensitive TCP traffic from congestion insensitive UDP traffic by
giving better treatment to yellow packets than to red packets. Treatment given
to yellow and red packets in the RED queues depends on RED parameters
(drop thresholds and max drop probability values) for yellow and red packets.
Fairness can be achieved by coloring excess TCP packets as yellow and
setting the RED parameter values for packets of different colors correctly. In
these simulations, yellow rates of 12.8 kbps and 128 kbps are experimented
with. With a yellow rate of 12.8 kbps, only a fraction of excess TCP packets
can be colored yellow at the traffic conditioner and thus resulting fairness in
excess bandwidth distribution is not good. However with a yellow rate of 128
kbps, all excess TCP packets are colored yellow and good fairness is achieved
with correct setting of RED parameters. Yellow bucket size also explains a
substantial portion of variation in fairness results for three-color simulations.
This is because bursty TCP traffic can fully utilize its yellow rate only if
yellow bucket size is sufficiently high. The interaction between yellow rate
and yellow bucket size for three-color fairness results is because of the fact
that minimum size of the yellow bucket required for fully utilizing the yellow
rate increases with yellow rate.

Performance of DiffServBased SatelliteIP
289
It is evident that three colors are required to enable TCP flows get a
fairshare of excess network resources. Excess TCP and UDP packets should
be colored differently and network should treat them in such a manner so as to
achieve fairness. Also, size of token buckets should be sufficiently high so
that bursty TCP traffic can fully utilize the token generation rates.

11.7.4 MEO Simulation Results Discussion
295
It is clear from figures 11.9 and 11.10 that fairness is not good in two-
color simulations. With three colors there is a wide variation in fairness
results with the best being close to I. It can be noted that fairness is 0 in some
of the two-color simulations as the total reserved traffic uses all the bandwidth
and there is no excess bandwidth available to share.
Figures 11.11 and 11.13 show the reserved rate utilization for TCP
traffic and it is obvious that three-color simulations is better than two colors.
Figures 11.12 and 11 .14 show the reserved rate utilization for two-color UDP
and three-color UDP. As discussed in Section 11.4, in three-color simulation,
the UDP customer always has a yellow rate of O. However, TCP packets
coming from customers
1-9 are colored
green,
yellow
or
red (three
precedence levels) and UDP packets are colored green or red (two precedence
levels). It can be noted that in some cases reserved rate utilization is slightly
more than I. This is because token buckets are initially full which results in
all packets getting green color in the beginning.
Clearly, three levels of drop precedence (colors) are required for high
reserved rate utilizations. The fair allocation of excess network bandwidth can
be achieved only by giving different treatment to congestion-sensitive TCP
and congestion-insensitive UDP packets.
11.8 UDP-BASED AUDIO-VIDEO EXAMPLE
In this section, performance of the telelearning and videoconferencing
system over a satellite link are discussed [262]. In the network testbed, two
LANs located in Genova and Firenze are connected through a ITALSAT II
Ka-band satellite link at 2 Mbps. Another LAN located at Pisa does not have a
satellite station but is connected to the network in Genova through 512 Kbps
ISDN link. The LANs are composed of PCs equipped with video capture
device (H.26 voice encoder card). The PCs are the source of the services
under test (TCP/IP videoconferencing tools, TCP/IP file transfer and Web
browsing).
The system was evaluated by varying both the video bit rate and
the scheduling strategy. Audio bit/rate is fixed at 64 Kbps. Four different
values, 128, 256, 384, 512 Kbps, were used for video. The configurations
chosen for queue management were no fair queuing FIFO, Fair Queuing (FQ),
and RSVP-based schemes (WFQ with RSVP). The work sessions were tested
both without any disturbance and with two types of background traffic: TCP-
based traffic
(FTP
session), and UDP-based traffic
where audio/video
application of interest is jammed into a non-guaranteed 256 Kbps video

296
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
transmission. The aim is to investigate system behavior and tuning the various
parameters to obtain good user perceived QoS (P-QoS).
Many measures have been performed by utilizing a Mean Opinion
Score (MaS) method to evaluate real user perception. All the measures were
averaged to get an evaluation
of the overall system. Three cases are
considered - with no background traffic, with TCP transfer, and with UDP
transfer.
Figure 11.15 shows the MaS values for the whole work session
(videoconference) if the video bit rate is varied and the scheduling mechanism
changed. Here, an UDP-based transfer is completed.
When no background traffic is added, the effect of RSVP guarantees
is remarkable. While the quality of the no fair queuing session drastically
deteriorates, the RSVP session always maintains high quality. In this case, the
FQ scheme also allows good quality because, due to the FQ algorithm, low-
bit-rate flows (voice), are privileged .
When background traffic is added in the form of a TCP-based FTP
transfer, the jamming traffic, which is individuated by neither the no fair
queuing nor the FQ algorithm, deteriorates the performance. Only the results
obtains with RSVP maintain a certain level of QoS. FQ allows guaranteeing
bandwidth for the voice flow but fails to serve the video, which provides low
enough quality to affect the global evaluation.
When UDP-based traffic such as video flow is added as background
traffic, the performance is similar to the previous TCP case, but the reduction
of quality for the no fair queuing scheduling discipline is even more evident
due to the fact that UDP does not adapt its rate to the network load. As in the
TCP case, RSVP reserves bandwidth for the important flows, the disturbance
video flow, which may also be considered non-guaranteed video flow over the
same network, uses only the residual bandwidth.

12.2 MPLS OVERVIEW
Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) [140] is a layer 3 switching
technology aimed at greatly improving the packet forwarding performance of
the backbone routers in the Internet or other large networks. The basic idea is
to forward the packets based on a short, fixed length identifier termed as a
'label', instead of the network-layer address with variable length match. The
labels are assigned to the packets at the ingress node of an MPLS domain .
Inside the MPLS domain, the labels attached to packets are used to make
forward ing decisions. Thus, MPLS uses indexing instead of a longest address
match as in conventional IP routing. The labels are finally popped out from
the packets when they leave the MPLS domain at the egress nodes. By doing
this, the efficiency of packet forwarding is greatly improved. Routers, which
support MPLS, are known as Label Switching Routers (LSRs).

this, the efficiency of packet forwarding is greatly improved. Routers, which 
support MPLS, are known as Label Switching Routers (LSRs).

BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
Although the original idea behind the development of MPLS was to
facilitate fast packet switching, currently its main goal is to support traffic
engineering and provide quality of service. The goal of traffic engineering is
to facilitate efficient and reliable network operations, and at the same time
optimize the utilization of network resources. Most current network routing
protocols are based on the shortest path algorithm, which implies that there is
only one path between a given source and destination end system.
In contrast, MPLS supports explicit routing, which can be used to
optimize the utilization of network resources and enhance traffic oriented
performance characteristics. For example, multiple
paths
can
be used
simultaneously to improve performance from a given source to a destination.
MPLS provides explicit routing without requiring each IP packet to carry the
explicit route, which makes traffic engineering easier. Another advantage is
that
using
label switching,
packets
of different flows
can be labeled
differently and thus received different forwarding (and hence different quality
of service).
A Label Switched Path (LSP) is referred to as a path from the ingress
node to the egress node of an MPLS domain followed by packets with the
same label. A traffic trunk is an aggregation of traffic flows of the same class,
which are placed inside an LSP [141, 263]. Therefore, all packets on a traffic
trunk have the same label and the same 3-bit class of service (currently
experimental) field in the MPLS header.
Traffic trunks are routable objects like virtual circuits in ATM and
Frame Relay networks. These trunks can be established either statically or
dynamically (on demand) between any two nodes in an MPLS domain.
A trunk can carry any aggregate of micro-flows, where each micro-
flow consists of packets belonging to a single TCP or UDP flow. In general,
trunks are expected to carry several such micro-flows of different transport
types. However, as shown in this analysis, mixing different transport types
can cause performance problems such as starvation and unfairness for certain
traffic.

MPLS and Traffic Engineering
MPLS can be used for providing traffic engineering and allows
routing control capabilities to be introduced into IP networks. Once an
explicit route is determined, a signaling protocol is used to install the LSP.
Through explicit LSP, a quasi circuit switching capability is superimposed on
the IP routing model. When deployed over IP over SONET or DWDM, layer
2 and layer 3 functions are virtualized in the LSR thus reducing the number of
network elements needed with overlay alternatives e.g., IP over ATM. This
results in increased reliability, and reduced operating costs and queuing
delays. [264]
The traffic trunk concept in traffic engineering in IP networks is an
aggregation of traffic belonging to the same class. In MPLS networks, traffic
trunks are mapped onto the network topology through the selection of routers
for explicit LSPs.
An MPLS traffic engineering model consists of the following basic
functional components:
â€¢
Path management - concerns all aspects related to the selection of
explicit routes and the instantiation and maintenance of LSP tunnels.
â€¢
Traffic assignment - concerns all aspects related to the allocation of
traffic to established LSP tunnels
â€¢
Network state information dissemination - concerns the distribution
ofrelevant topology state information throughout the MPLS domain .
â€¢
Network management - includes a set of configuration management
functions, performance and accounting management functions, and
fault management functions.

if a bent pipe architecture is selected, these functions will be done at the

In the following sections, performance impact of mixing TCP and
UDP traffic is analyzed. The two transports have a very different congestion
response. Specifically, TCP has congestion control and reduces its traffic in
response to packet loss whereas ; UDP has no congestion control and does not
respond to losses. While it is possible to design UDP applications that are
sensitive to congestion losses, very few such applications exist.

Performance of MPLS
12.3 NETWORK TOPOLOGY
303
The initial simulation and analysis with label switching and CBQ
(Class-based Queuing) for trunk
service is described
in the following
paragraphs.
In the simulations, the network topology shown in figure 12.3 was
used. It consists of fix routers and six end-systems. The routers are MPLS
capable. The routers R2, R4, R5 are gateways in a broadband satellite
network. There are 3 flows. Source SI sends UDP traffic to destination D I.
Sources S2 and S3 send TCP traffic to destination D2 and D3, respectively
(here n=3). The UDP source sends traffic at a given rate. The TCP sources are
"infinite ftp" sources and send packets whenever its congestion window
allows . The actual throughputs are monitored at the destination nodes.
The two TCP flows are different only in their packet sizes. The first
TCP flow (TCP I) between S2 and D2 uses a MSS of 512 bytes. The second
flow (TCP2) between S3 and D3 uses an MSS of 1024 bytes. Thus, the two
flows are almost identical except for the packet sizes.
As seen in figure 12.3, there exist two parallel paths between routers
R2 and R5, one (R2-R3-R5) of a high bandwidth (45 Mbps) and the other
(R2-R4-R5) of comparatively low bandwidth (15Mpbs). The link delay of all
the links in the network is 5ms. Routers R2, R3, R4, R5 belong to satellite
networks.

12.4.1 LEO Performance Results
12.4.1.1 Throughput analysis
The first case we analyzed is the overall throughput performance of
the network with and without MPLS. We generate VoIP and two TCP sources
for this purpose.
Case 1: No trunks, No MPLS
According to the current satellite routing strategy implemented in the
ns-2 simulator, which basically routes through the shortest path available. All
three flows use the same route. The TCP flows being inherently congestion
responsive are cut down by the VoIP flow. Figure 12.4 shows the throughput
performance for VoIP rates for three different flows.

We can conclude from the graph above that as the VoIP rate increases
the throughput ofthe TCP flows suffer. The overall throughput ofthe network
is almost 4.8 Mbps. Also we can see unfairness among the TCP flows
themselves.

Case 2: Two Separate Trunks Using Label Switched Paths

Next we analyze the same traffic but in this case with MPLS we
explicitly route TCP2 on a separate LSP, while the VoIP and TCPI share
another LSP. Figure 12.5 shows the throughput performance for VolP rates.

Figure 12.5: Throughput perf ormance for Vol]' with two separate trunks
Since the TCP2 flow is routed explicitly on a 5Mbps link, increase in
the VolP rate has no effect on TCP2 throughput. TCPI though which shares
the same LSP with VolP traffic suffers as the VolP rate is increased. Also we
note that the overall throughput of the network has gone above 9 Mbps.
12.4.1.2 Jitter and Packet Loss Analysis
Jitter is a major concern for real-time traffic. To maintain necessary
QoS it is to be kept as low as possible. To analyze jitter we used the same
simulation scenario as for the throughput analysis.

BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
Since the main purpose of our analysis is to ascertain the need for
traffic engineering in satellite networks and not to determine the exact values
of jitter, the simulation time is for a very small period, hence the values of
jitter may increase for larger periods e.g. one whole day. Table 12.1 shows
jitter values of 13.8 ms and 9.8 ms for 400 and 520 VolP sources respectively.
Typical jitter values range anywhere from 23 ms to 60 ms or even more than
100 ms for distances more than 15000 Km [265].
Jitter analysis showed that with an increase in the number of VolP
sources the mean latency increased but jitter kept reducing as shown in the
results below . The explanation for this is that with higher bandwidth of VolP
traffic the TCP flow was reduced because of its congestion responsive nature
thus having less effect on the queue keeping jitter low but when VolP traffic
was less because increased TCP traffic the jitter value increases.
Case 2: Voice over IP QoS Performance: With MPLS
The VolP traffic is explicitly routed along a path different from that
of the two TCP flows. One of the drawbacks of this is that there is a
possibility that the mean delay of this path might be more than the shortest
path.

The results in table 12.2 show that with the VolP traffic separated

acceptable values for VolP traffic.

12.5 DISCUSSION
MPLS traffic engineering was applied to study TCP and UDP
throughput improvements over a satellite network. Simulation results show
that the total network throughput improves significantly with proper traffic
engineering. Congestion-insensitive (UDP) flows affect the throughput of
congestion-sensitive (TCP) flows. Therefore, different types of flows should
be isolated in different trunks in order to guarantee quality of service. For the
scheme discussed in this chapter to be effective the trunks need to be end-to-
end, otherwise the advantages of isolation in other parts of the network are
eliminated or reduced significantly.

Figure 13.1 shows an example of broadband satellite network using
the Digital Video Broadcasting via Satellite (DVB-S) protocol standard for
the forward channel and the Digital Video Broadcast - Return Channel via
Satellite (DVB-RCS) standard for the return channel . The forward channel
refers to the link from the gateway that is received by the user terminal and
the return channel is the link from the user terminal to the gateway .

The 2-way interactive satellite Internet access network also presents a
network asymmetry environment. The DVB-S forward link is about 38-45
Mbps and return link using terrestrial dialup or cellular or satellite is with
around 10:1 asymmetry. To accommodate such network path asymmetry,
several mitigation techniques have been proposed [46,47].

In the DVB network, a satellite forward and return links typically use
frequency bands in Ku (12-18 GHz) andlor Ka (18-30 GHz). The return links
use spot beams and the forward link global beams are used for broadcasting
and Ku-band. Depending on the frequency bands (Tx/Rx), three popular
versions are available: (a) Ku/Ku (14/12 GHz) (b) KaiKu (30/12 GHz) and (c)
Ka/Ka (30/20 GHz). In business-to-business applications,
the SIT is
connected to several user PCs via a LAN and a Point-of Presence (POP)
Router. The Hub station implements the forward link via a conventional
DVB-S chain (similar to Digital TV broadcasting) whereby the IP packet is
encapsulated into DVB-streams, IP over DVB. The return link is implemented
using the DVB-RCS standard "MF-TDMA Burst Demodulator bank", IP over
ATM like. The HUB station is connected to the routers of several ISP's via a
Broadband Access Server. The HUB maps the traffic of all SITs belongingto
each ISP in an efficient way over the satellite. The selection of a suitable
residential access technology depends on the type of application, site location,
required speed, and affordablecost.
13.2.1 Digital Video Broadcasting - Return Channel via
Satellite (DVB-RCS) Protocol
The DVB Return Channel System via Satellite (DVB-RCS) was
specitied by an ad-hoc ETSI technical group founded in 1999. The DV13-RCS
system specification in ETSI EN 30I 790, v1.2.2 (2000-12) specifies a
satellite terminal (sometimes known as a Satellite Interactive Terminal (SIT)
or Return Channel Satellite Terminal (RCST) supporting a two-way DVB
satellite system [43,44]. This section describes DVB-RCS protocol. The use
of standard system components providesa simple approach and should reduce
time to market.
Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) receives a standard DVB-S
transmission generated by a satellite gateway. Packet data may be sent over
this forward link in the usual way (e.g. MPE, data streaming, etc.) DVB-RCS
provides transmit capability from the user site via the same antenna. The
transmit capability uses a Multi-Frequency Time Division Multiple Access
(MF-TDMA) access scheme to share the capacity available for transmission
by the user terminal. Return channel is coded using rate Y2 convolution FEC
and Reed Solomon coding. The standard is designed to be frequency
independent and it does not specify the frequency band(s) to be used
-
thereby allowing a wide variety of systems to be constructed. Data to be
transported may be encapsulated in ATM cells, using ATM Adaptation Layer
5 (AAL-5), or use a native IP encapsulation over MPEG-2 transport. It also
includesa number of security mechanisms.

BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
13.2.1.1 MultiFrequency Time Division Multiple Access (MF-TDMA)
The return channel air interface specifies how the traffic and signaling
data should be transmitted. The air interface is based on the DYB/MPEG-2
forward channel and defines a specific return channel based on an MF-TDMA
scheme.
The return channel air interface
uses QPSK and concatenated
convolutional and Reed Solomon codes. Digital transmissions via satellite can
be affected
by power limitations.
Hence, resistance against
noise
and
interference has been one of the design objectives of the return channel air
interface.
The MF-TDMA return channel satellite access scheme allows the
modification of transmission parameters like carrier frequency on a time slot
by time slot basis. Coding and bit rate can also be varied. This scheme has the
advantage of more efficient adaptation to widely varying
transmission
requirements, typical of multimedia, at the expense of slightly more complex
Return Channel Satellite Terminal (RCST). RCSTs have a specific frequency
range for the frequency hopping from time slot to time slot. This frequency
range is communicated from an RCST to the hub in a Common Signaling
Channel (CSC) burst (initial slotted ALOHA) during the logon procedure.
The hub can then allocate appropriate slots/frequencies to the terminal.
For ATM traffic time slots, four peak information bit rates are
available, 144, 384, 1024, 2048 Kbps. Each RCST is assigned to a specific bit
rate depending on its capabilities and local conditions. Traffic bursts are
transmitted in traffic time slots containing one ATM cell.
A frame consists of a number of time slots on a number of carriers.
Each frame has a duration of 26.5 ms. The number and composition of time
slots per frame is determined by the information bit rate to be supported by
the frame. Traffic capacity is assigned on a frame basis. The repetition rate of
the Terminal Burst Time Plane (TBTP) is distributed every 26.5 ms, which
allows multiples of 16 Kbps bit rates. The frame consisting of overhead slots
i.e., Common Signaling Channel (CSC) slots, Acquisition (ACQ) slots, and
Synchronization (SYNC) slots are aligned
across
the carriers
and
the
beginning of the frame as shown in figure 13.2. CSC and ACQ slots have the
same duration as traffic slots. The duration of SYNC slots is half the duration
of traffic slots. The bandwidth of a frame is less or equal to the frequency
hopping range of RCST. The number of carriers in this bandwidth can be
derived from the symbol rate, which depends on the error correction, coding
and the preamble configuration the details of which can be found in [43].

13.2.2 Data over Cable Service Interface Specification
(DOCSIS)
The DOCSIS was developed by the North American Cable Industry
under the auspices of Cable Labs to create a competitive market for cable
modem equipment. It was developed as a cheap web-serv ing platform. The
main specification work for DOCSIS 1.0 was completed in March 1997.
A cable data system consists of multiple Cable Modems (CM), in
subscriber locations. and a Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS), all
connected by a Community Antenna Television (CATV) plant. The CMTS
can reside in a headend or a distribution hub. The DOCSIS products have
been available since
1999. The DOCSIS
1.1 version has enhanced the
specification in terms of QoS, IP multicast and security [266]. The DOCSIS
2.0 version has been released in 2002 downstream. The DOCSIS supports an
upstream of 320 Kbps - 10.24 Mbps and downstream rates of36 Mbps.

316
13.2.3 Comparison
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
At the Physical layer DYB-RCS and DOCSIS have a very similar
structure, burst mode TDMA upstream and TDM downstream. In particular,
the choice of FEC for the downstream is similar in both DYB-RCS and
DOCSIS but for upstream it is different. Heavily concatenated coding or turbo
coding is used in DYB-RCS while DOCSIS has narrow filtering with Reed-
Salmon coding. DYB-RCS supports ATM, lp and MPEG formats thus
supporting consumer and business markets. DOCSIS supports only IP and so
only the consumer market.
At the MAC layer, the basic features such as, capacity allocation
based on demand and free assignments, capacity request by piggy-back,
request
slot
(except
random-access
request
allowed
in
DOCSIS),
synchronization/ranging functions, and registration, are similar in both DYB-
RCS and DOCSIS.
The specific MAC formats are different in both of them. In DOCSIS,
the
head-end
station
handles
the
capacity
management,
ranging,
and
registration of the terminals.
DYB-RCS, on the other hand, has three
elements, NCC , terminal and head-end station, with each element handling
each function . The head-end station takes care of registration. Capacity
management involves both head-end station and NCC since in satellite, man)'
service providers share resources. The service providers pay for a grand total
capacity. The actual dynamic capacity allocation is controlled by NCC
according to a contract. Synchronization and ranging is under the control of
NCe.
Table 13.1 provides a comparison of the two return channel protocols.
In summary, DOCSIS as is cannot be used for broadband satellite
communication network. Considerable modifications at the Physical and
MAC layers have to be developed, for DOCSIS to be used for satellite access
return channel. In the next section a CDMA based Spread ALOHA protocol
has been developed and analysis and simulation results are presented.

13.3 CDMA ACCESS PROTOCOL
In this section a COMA based Spread ALOHA Multiple Access is
described [5]. This channel is actually the first resource all users must share to
access the multimedia information to be delivered by the forward channel on
a per-user basis. The efficient use of this channel impacts the overall
efficiency and latency along with the forward channel dynamic resource
assignment on bent pipe and partial or full
processor satellites.

13.3.1.1 Multiple Access Architectures for Return Channel
The
interactive communication channel in the forward
direction
(HUR-Sat-terminals)
is one-to-many,
i.e. a
broadcast
channel
and
its
dimensioning is a relatively simple problem. This channel is generally time-
division multiplexed (TOM) like OYB-S
[43, 44]. The communication
channel in the return direction (terminals-Sat-HUB) is many-to-one, i.e. a
multiple-access channel to be shared by all the users within the satellite beam.
Its optimum architecture depends on several interdependent variables making
it a challenging design problem especially in GEO networks scenario.
The key design parameters to be taken into account are the latency
and overhead introduced by the multiple access candidates. This point is
especially critical in a GEO constellation that inherently introduces a round-
trip-delay (RTT) of about half a second. A LEO constellation introduces
smaller delays albeit time variant. Terrestrial networks have potential faster
setup connectivity but in turn are subjected to be degraded by congestion that
eventually the satellite network is able to bypass. Another characteristic of
broadband satellite is the asymmetry between the forward and the return
channel. Even with this asymmetry the return multiple access channel should
serve as many terminals as the forward channel does. An optimum satellite
multiple access channel should also be flexible enough to offer the wide range
of transmission rates needed for multimedia data transmission (dependent OT)
the particular global system architecture) and scalable for future changes in
traffic demand and service requirements. Finally, interactive terminals should

InteractiveMultimediaover Satellite
319
be low power and low-cost to be competitive with or to complement
terrestrial access terminals.
Multiple access architectures can be categorized as connection-
oriented architectures or contention-oriented architectures.
13.3.1.2 Connection-Oriented Architecture
In this architecture the system assigns part of the return channel to
each user after a setup process. This assignment avoids contention but
introduces overhead and setup latency. The figure of merit of a connection-
oriented multiple access architecture is the efficiency, which is the ratio
between the multiple access channel transmission rate and a continuous
transmission rate. Examples are the well-known Frequency-Division Multiple
Access (FDMA) also called Single Channel per Carrier (SCPC) and Time
Division Multiple Access (TDMA). The assignment can be fixed or on
demand (Demand-Assigned Multiple Access, DAMA).
The main disadvantage of FDMA is its lack of flexibility for variable
transm ission rates. Instead, TDMA gives
sufficient flexibility
to allow
transmission rate variability down to a frame-by-frame basis. The main
disadvantage ofTDMA however is the required high peak transmit power in a
packet transmission due to the high burst rates. In addition, TDMA setup
connection time may be high since it requires significant overhead for burst
synchronization along with a setup connection time to assign the channel. In
order to limit the peak transmission power of the terminals MF-TDMA is
used. The MF-TDMA consists of a TDMA scheme over more than one
carrier. Figure 13.4 shows an example ofa MF-TDMA frame.

BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
Also Code Division Multiple Access (COMA) can be considered as a
connection multiple access scheme when the assignment of the available set
of codes is made on a per-user basis after an initial setup process. For voice
applications or continuous flow of information this strategy can be efficient.
However, it may lack flexibility when dealing with bursty traffic. In this case
contention policies also based on COMA become more suitable.
13.3.1.3 Contention-Oriented Architecture
In contention architecture the terminals access the channel without
any
previous assignment and therefore there will be packet collisions.
Normalized offered load, G, is defined as the total traffic expressed as a
fract ion of the maximum data rate, i.e. G=A,TI' where A, is the packet arrival
rate and TI' is the packet duration. It is normally assumed that throughput is
the figure of merit of a contention architecture. The normalized multiple
access throughput, S, can be defined as the same fraction but referring to
successful traffic, S=G.P" where P, is the probability of success. Packet
arrival is considered to be Poisson-distributed.
The basic contention or random access scheme is pure ALOHA
proposed by Abramson in 1970 [267]. In pure ALOHA each user transmits
without any synchronization with other users. After sending the packet, the
user waits the round-trip delay for an acknowledgement (ACK) from the
receiver, if no ACK is received, the packet is assumed to be lost in a collision
and it is re-transmitted after a random delay. The relationship between Sand
G in this case is: [267]
S
G -2G
ALOHA = e
(13 .1 )
It can be observed that the maximum normalized throughput is 1/2e
occurring at G*=O.5. Note that error correction techniques (channel coding)
are not used in ALOHA since it does not have multiple-access capability in a
common channel.
If terminals are only allowed to transmit within a certain time pattern,
the scheme is called slotted ALOHA and the throughput increases to
S
G -c
slotted AU )HA = e
(13.2)
Now the maximum normalized throughput is lie occurring at G*=l.
If instead of one single narrow band channel of pure ALOHA there are N

321

Multiple Access (MAMA). In this case the throughput is given by
-2~
-~
SMAMA =Ge
N;
Ssloted MAMA =Ge

(13.3)
This means that N ALOHA channels have N times the throughput of
one single channel when serving N times the offered load. Note that for an
arbitrary number of channels N, the maximum normalized throughput is Nile
occurring at G*=N/2. Figure 13.5 shows a comparison of pure ALOHA,
slotted ALOHA and MAMA throughputs.

If the bandwidth of a narrow band ALOHA channel is increased by a
factor F, there is a High Bandwidth ALOHA multiple access scheme, where
the packets will be shorter thus decreasing the number of collisions. There is
however a practical problem that excludes ALOHA for high bit user data
rates. Bit energy, Ei: must keep unchanged since digital quality does not
depend on power but on bit energy. This means that power during the packet
burst must be increased by F since the packet has shorter length now" due to
the larger data rate. For values ofF in the order of 100 and above the power to
be transmitted can be extremely high. This fact limits pure ALOHA (either
unslotted or slotted) to narrowband operation (up to few tens of kilobits per
second). For broadband systems, different solutions can be applied . Spread
spectrum technology on top of ALOHA can be used to provide a high
bandwidth

13.3.1.4 CDMA based Contention Multiple Access Schemes
Fundamentally,
there
are
two
spread
ALOHA
multiple
access
schemes. These are distinguished by the code assignment as follows
â€¢
A different code is assigned to each user
â€¢
All users use the same code
In the first case, the receiver distinguishes a user for its code.
ALOHA is applied by selecting randomly a code sequence. Note that this
approach is different from the connection oriented COMA where the code is
assigned on a per-user basis during a setup procedure. To make this solution
efficient, in [268] the inhibit sense multiple access (ISMA-COMA) protocol is
introduced, where the HUB broadcasts the status (free or busy) of the various
available code sequences. In [268] a performance comparison between Slotted
ALOHA COMA and MAMA is presented. Authors conclude that by using
error control coding the COMA packet radio exhibits higher peak throughput,
less delay (for low offered load) and much better stability than MAMA.
In the second case, the receiver distinguishes between the received
packets if there are sufficient time offsets between them. Figure ]3.6 shows
how symbols from two different packets can be distinguished even when
different users employ the same code.

The use of a unique code implies that the channel is still a contention
one, similar in nature to ALOHA. They differ however in two essential
factors :
The probability of having contention collisions is drastically reduced .
There can be several users simultaneously on the channel as long as
the multiuser interference keeps below a given level. Channel coding can be

Interactive Multimedia over Satellite
323
used to mitigate error due to the interference of the multiple packets on-the-
aIr.
Spread spectrum ALOHA with one single code can be implemented
in two ways: Spread Aloha Multiple Access (SAMATM) and Code Reuse
Multiple Access (CRMATM). SAMAâ„¢repeats the code or spread sequence
every symbol. Conversely, CRMAâ„¢uses one single code as long as the
packet. For convenience, henceforth the following notationwill be used:
â€¢
SAOC (Spread ALOHA One Code) will be SAMAâ„¢
SAOLC(Spread ALOHA One LongCode) will be CRMAâ„¢
13.3.1.5 Performance of SAOC and SAOLC
The throughput performance analysis addressesthe following issues:
â€¢
Is throughput limited by collision or by multiple access interference?
â€¢
What is the maximum number of simultaneous packets that the
channel can admit?
â€¢
How are transmitted power and probability of correct packet related
to the maximum number of simultaneouspackets that the channel can
admit?
The performance is analyzed through Monte Carlo simulations. A single-
hop spread spectrum return channel is considered with the following
assumptions:
â€¢
An infinite number of independent
ISTs (Interactive Satellite
Terminals) transmitting asynchronously (unslotted ALOHA), a hub
and one GEO satellite
â€¢
A common spreading sequence which either repeats every symbol
(SAOC) or is as long as the packet (SAOLC)
â€¢
Data rate is R=128kb/s and spreading factor, F can be 12, 30, 36, 60,
100, 200 or 300
â€¢
Packets are Poisson distributed with an arrival rate of A. Packets are
of fixed length of L bits
â€¢
Everytransmitted packet is received with equal power
The bit error of asynchronous spread spectrum multiple access is due
to both interference and additive Gaussian noise (AWGN). The bit error
probability is given by [269]

324
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
(13.4)
where QO is the error function, E, is the bit Energy, No the spectral
noise density, F is the spreading gain and k is the number of simultaneous
users. If Gaussian noise is neglected Eq.13.4 reduces to
(13.5)
The probability of correct packet given that there are k simultaneous
users on-the-air is:
P(correct packet / k simultaneous users)=
[1 - Ph(kÂ»)"
(13.6)
If the packet includes block error control capability that can correct t
or fewer errors, the probability of packet success is
P(correct packet/ k simultaneous users) = ~ ( ~)1-Pb(k))'-iPb(k)'
(13 .7)
Monte Carlo simulations are carried out by stepping through a vector
of arrival times (Poisson-distributed). For each new arrival, one index tracks
the packets still on-the-air while other index checks whether the new arrival
incurs in either a multiple access collision or multiuser interference.
Let us note that the unslotted ALOHA case is an interesting scheme
for a satellite scenario since
synchronization would introduce a significant
additional delay in a GEO scenario. However, since the power fluctuates
during
packet
transmission
the
throughput
and
maximum
number of
simultaneous users is especially difficult to calculate as shown in figure 13.8.
Actually, the time evolution ofthe number of packets on-the-air is a stochastic
process. In [270] and [27 I] this process is modeled as a birth-death process
and a statistical treatment of the problem is given. The authors however
disregard collision probability, which may not be totally neglected in SAOC
while it is in SAOLe (see figure 13.7).

Figure 13.8 represents equations 13.8 and 13.9 with F=30 and packet
lengths of 512 bits up to 512 x 5 bits. Note that these probabilities do not
depend on the data rate.
There is a need to find out what the collision windows are. In SAOC a
collision occurs when one terminal starts transmitting during the first chip of
any symbol of the packets on-the-air. In SAOLC a collision occurs when one
terminal starts transmitting during the first chip of the first symbol of the
packets on-the-air. Collision windows are plotted in figure 13.9.
Therefore, applying Eqs. 13.8 and 13.9:

13.3.1.6 Simulation Results
In this section SAOC and SAOLC multiple access performance are
accessed. The following algorithm has been considered:

Interactive Multimedia over Satellite
327
â€¢
When a collision is detected all the packets involved are considered
lost (note that collisions only happen in SAOC)
â€¢
When the new arriving packet exceeds the maximum permitted
number of packets on-the-air, all the packets are considered lost,
including the new arriving one (channel coding was not taken into
account)
Figures
13.10
and
13.11
show
the
performance
for
different
maximum number of simultaneous users without considering interference
effects. Note that throughput and offered traffic are normalized to that number
of users for comparison. The following conclusions can be drawn : [272]
â€¢
SAOLC
throughput
increases
above
SAOC
throughput
as
the
maximum number of simultaneous users increases . This demonstrates
that SAOLC is limited by interference while SAOC is limited by
collisions
â€¢
SAOLC follows the curve Y=X from low loads up to about 0.5 for 12
users and almost 0.85 for 60 users up to 200 users. These regions
present virtually no packet lost
â€¢
SAOLC degrades rapidly as the load approaches Nmax since the
interference increases significantly. Thus SAGC behaves better for
higher normalized offered traffic .

By comparing figure 13.12 with figures 13.10 and 13.11, it can be
observed that for SAOLC, up to an 85% throughput could be achieved for a
channel with about 60 simultaneous users. However, bit error due to multiuser
interference reduces the throughput because the maximum permitted number
of simultaneous users is actually restricted by the En/N". In addition, as it was
concluded before, SAOLC throughput increases above SAOC initially but
then decreases more rapidly than SAOLe.
13.4 DISCUSSION
Currently, for interactive satellite IP access networks OVB-RCS
protocol for return channel is the preferred choice , but DOCSIS needs
modifications to suit satellite access. There is a need for performance analysis
of the two protocols from a reliability point of view.
A COMA based spread ALOHA single long code multiple access
protocol proposed in this chapter, provides better throughput than spread
ALOHA
single code multiple access but is subjected to multiple user
interference. This result is demonstrated through Monte Carlo simulations.
The throughput performance results show that: Spread ALOHA One
Long Code (SAOLe) throughput increases above Spread ALOHA One Code

330
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
(SAOe) throughput as the maximum number of simultaneous users increases .
This demonstrates that SAOLC is limited by interference while SAOC is
limited by collisions. SAOLC follows the curve Y == X from low loads up to
about 0.5, and up to 12 users. The throughput increases almost to 0.85 for 60
users up to 200 users. These regions present virtually no packet loss. SAOLC
degrades rapidly as the load approaches Nmax while the interference increases
significantly. Thus SAOC behaves better for higher normalized offered
traffic .
Future
satellite broadband
systems
could
consider these
return
channel protocols for high bandwidth return interactive channel since they
present good normal ized throughput characteristics. Issues such as channel
coding, delay distribution, power efficiency or economical aspects compared
to other return channel protocols need to be assessed.

14.1 INTRODUCTION
Some of the proposed Ka-band satellite systems will use ATM
technology to seamlessly support
Internet traffic. ATM
was originally
designed for fiber-based terrestrial networks that exhibit low latencies and
error rates. With the increasing demand for electronic connectivity across the
world, satellite networks play an indispensable role in the deployment of
global networks. Ka-band satellites using the GHz frequency spectrum can
reach user terminals across most of the populated world. ATM-based satellite
networks
can
effectively
provide
real-time
as
well
as
non-real-time
communications services to remote areas. [273,274,275]
As we described in Part Two, the large delays in GEO systems and
delay variations in LEO systems affect both real-time and non-real-time
applications. In an acknowledgment- and time-out-based congestion control
mechanism (like TCP), performance is inherently related to the delay-
bandwidth product of the connection. Moreover, TCP round-trip time (RTT)
measurements are sensitive to delay variations that may cause false timeouts
and retransmissions. As a result, the congestion control issues for broadband
satellite networks are somewhat different from those of low-latency terrestrial
networks.
In this chapter, we describe a OoS model for TCP transport over
satellite ATM for UBR service. TCP SACK protocol and discard policies
such as Early Packet Discard (EPD) and Selective Discard (SO) are used to
study

14.2 ATM QUALITY OF SERVICE MODEL
ATM networks carry traffic from multiple categories, and support
OoS requirements for each service category. [210] defines five service
categories for ATM networks. Each service category is defined using a traffic
contract and a set of OoS parameters. The traffic contract is a set of
parameters that specify the characteristics of the source traffic. This defines
the requirements for compliant cells ofthe connection.
The traffic contract consists of the source traffic descriptors. These
are used to specify the characteristics of the traffic from a source end system .
The Peak Cell Rate (PCR) specifies the maximum rate at which a source can
send at any time. The Sustained Cell Rate (SCR) specifies the average rate
maintained by the source. The Maximum Burst Size (MBS) specifies the
maximum number of back-to-back cells at PCR that can be sent by the source
without violation of the SCR. The Cell Delay Variation Tolerance (CDVT)
and Burst Tolerance (BT) parameters are used to specify a tolerance for PCR
and SCR respectively. The Generic Cell Rate Algorithm (GCRA) specified in
(a version of the leaky bucket
algorithm) uses the PCRlSCR and the
respective
tolerance
parameters to
ensure that
the
incoming cells
are
compliant with the traffic contract.
BT = (MBS - 1)(1/SCR - I/PCR)
(14.1)
Figure
14.1 shows the traffic
parameters measured at the User
Network Interface (UNI) . The OoS parameters are negotiated by the source
with the network, and are used to define the expected OoS provided by the
network.

Quality of Service in Satellite ATM Networks

CTO is defined as the elapsed time between a cell exit at the
measuring point MPI e.g., source UNI, and the corresponding cell entry event
at
measurement point
MP2 e.g., the
destination
UNI, for a particular
connection. This delay consists of both a cell processing delay and a variable
queuing delay at the switch.
Cell Delay Variation (CDV)
Two performance parameters associated with COY are the One-Point
COY and the Two-Point COY which are defined below:
I-point CDV at a Measurement Point: The I-point COY (Yk) for cell
k at an MP is the difference between the cell's reference arrival time (Ck) and
actual arrival time (a.) at the MP:
Yk = Ck - ak
The reference arrival time pattern (cd is defined as follows:
Co == ao = 0
{
Ck + T when Ck ~ ak or when cell
k does not arrive
(14.2)
Ck + I =
a, + T otherwise.
Positive values of I-point COY (early cell arrivals) correspond to cell
clumping; negative values of I-point COY (late cell arrivals) correspond to
gaps in the cell stream.
Cell Delay Variation between two MPs (2-point CDV): The 2-point
COY (vd for cell k between Measurement Points MPI and MP2 is the
difference between the absolute cell transfer delay (Xk) of cell k between the
two MPs and a defined reference cell transfer delay (du) between the same
two MPs:
(14.3)
The absolute cell transfer delay (Xk) of cell k between MP I and MP2
is the difference between the cell's actual arrival time at MP2 (a2k) and the
cell's actual arrival time at MPI (alk) as in figure 14.2:
(14.4)
The reference cell transfer delay (d l,2) between MPI and MP2 is the
absolute cell transfer delay experienced by cell 0 between the two MPs.

Figure 14.3 illustrates the quality specification for the width of the
COV distribution. The delay time contains the fixed part composed of the
propagation delay and the processing delay as well as the varying part due to
the fluctuations in various delays (such as waiting time). The width of the
COV distribution is specified using the pair (n, /).d) where Sd is the width of
the value between the point where tail of the varying part is lO". The 2-point
COV is defined [276] as the upper bound on the difference between upper and
lower 10,8 quantiles of CTO. Hence n should be taken as 8 and Sd for real-
time services has been recommended as 3ms [276]. For non-real-time services
this value is expected to be between 600ms and several seconds. The
magnitude of the delay variation produced in the satellite link is larger than
that of the terrestrial network hence COY in the satellite link is a serious
problem. The most widely used method to compensate for COY is the use of a
shaper buffer at the receiver terminal.

Cell Loss Ratio (CLR)
The CLR is the ratio of the total lost cells to total transmitted cells in
a population of interest. There are three different CLR definitions depending
on the priority of the traffic . These are CLRo, CLRo+J, CLR 1â€¢ The requested
CLR will be an upper bound on the cell loss probability.
CLRo is the ratio oftotal lost cell with high priority and the number of
corresponding tagged cells to the number of Cell Loss Priority (CLP)=O
transmitted cells.
CLRo+1 is the ratio of lost cells to the total number of generated cells.
CLR J is the ratio of lost cells with CLP=]
to the number of
transmitted cells with CLP=l .
Cell Error Ratio (CER)
The CER is defined as the ratio of the errored cells to the successfully
transferred cells plus the errored cells.
Severely Errored Cell Block Ratio (SECBR)
The SECBR is defined as the ratio of the severely errored cell blocks
to the total transmitted cell blocks.
Cell Misinsertion Rate (CMR)
The CMR is defined for a connection as the ratio of misinserted cells
to the time interval.
Chapter 8 describes the classes of service and traffic parameters.
The Constant Bit Rate (CBR) class defined for traffic that requires a
constant amount of bandwidth, specified by PCR, to be continuously
available. The network guarantees that all cells emitted by the source that
conform to this PCR will be transferred by the network at PCR.
The real-time Variable Bit Rate (rt-VBR) class is characterized by
PCR, SCR and MBS that controls the bursty nature of VBR traffic. The
network attempts to deliver cells of these classes within fixed bounds of cell
delay (max-CTO) and delay variation (peak-to-peak COY) . Non-real-time
Variable Bit Rate (nrt-VBR) sources are also specified by PCR, SCR and
MBS, but are less sensitive to delay and delay variation than the real time
sources. The network does not guarantee the CTO and COV parameters for
nrt-VBR.
The Available Bit Rate (ABR) service category is specified by a PCR
as well as an MCR, which is guaranteed by the network. The bandwidth
allocated by the network at an ABR connection may vary during the life of a
connection, but may not be less than MCR. ABR connections use a rate-based

338
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
closed-look feedback-control mechanism for congestion control. The network
tries to maintain a low CLR by changing the allowed cell rates (ACR) at
which a source can send.
The Unspecified Bit Rate (UBR) class is intended for best effort
applications, and this category does not support any service guarantees. UBR
has no built in congestion control mechanisms. The UBR service manages
congestion by efficient buffer management policies in the switch.
14.3 SATELLITE ATM QOS REQUIREMENTS
This section identifies the QoS requirements that will be impacted by
the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) frame structures and time slot
allocations. The objectives for the satellite ATM network are also described.
14.3.1 ATM QoS objectives
Table ]4.] summarizes the QoS class definition and the network
performance objectives established for end-to-end ATM connections [276].
ITU-T G.114 specifies 400 ms as the delay limit for voice. This is an end-to-
end application delay (which can include coder delay, packetization delay,
and ATM Adaptation Layer (AAL) delay). This recommendation implies that
if the 400 ms delay value is exceeded, the network planners should be aware
that a degradation in quality can occur. It is the difficult to meet the CDV
objectives on low-rate ATM links.
To accommodate the characteristics and the requirements of various
traffic types, the following classes of service have been defined. Class I
(stringent class) is a delay-sensitive class and it is intended to support constant
bit rate (CBR) and real-time variable bit rate (VBR) services such as
telephony and videoconference. Class 2 (tolerant class) is a delay-tolerant
class and supports available bit rate (ABR) and non-real-time VBR services
such as video and data. Class 3 (bi-Ievel class) supports VBR and ABR
services such as high-speed data. Class 4 (unspecified class) supports
unspecified bit rate (UBR) services such as file transfers and email.

14.3.2 Performance Objectives for Satellites (Class 1 Service)
The QoS class required by each application is part of the contract
negotiation procedure between the user and the network. If the network can
provide the requested service level, the connection will be established. If there
is any performance objective that cannot be met, the connection will be
denied. Once a connection is established, the network must ensure that the
performance objectives of the QoS class are met during the connection. The
performance objectives for satellite ATM are given in table 14.2. [243]

14.3.3 CTD and CDV Contributions
The sources of CTD and CDV in a broadband satellite network
consist ofthe following items:
â€¢
Transmit Terminal Queuing Delay
â€¢
Transmission Delay
â€¢
Propagation Delay
â€¢
MAC Layer Delays
â€¢
Onboard Processing Delays
â€¢
Receive Terminal Smoothing Buffer
â€¢
Timing Synchronization
â€¢
The impact of each of these sources is addressed below.
14.3.3.1 Transmit Terminal Queuing Delay
Transmit terminal queuing delay is associated with variations in the
cell arrival rate which would cause the arrival at a particular queue to exceed
the queue
service rate. This
delay is variable
in nature
and therefore
contributes to the CDV QoS performance. For the CBR and rt-VBR services,
it is expected that the allocated ATM bandwidths for such connections will
correspond to the connection PCRs so as to minimize the queuing delay.
14.3.3.2 Transmission Delay
The transmission delay is a fixed component of the overall CTD
budget for a connection. It corresponds to the time required to transmit cells at
a given carrier rate. In general, the transmission delay is small compared to
the propagation delay.
14.3.3.3 Propagation Delay
The propagation delay from a transmit terminal to a receive terminal
(i.e., round trip delay) has a fixed and time-varying components. The fixed
component of the delay budget for a geostationary satellite is about 264 ms
for links among terminals with minimum elevation angles of 20Â°. The variable
component is due to satellite station keeping. The selection of satellite
network architecture depends on the choice of the satellite orbit, which is
dependent up on the application
it is intended
for. For example, the
propagation delay is larger in GEO as compared to MEO or LEO satellites.
However, the delay variation due to routing has to be addressed in the case of

Quality of Service in Satellite ATM Networks
341
LEO and MEa networks. The buffering delay analysi s forms the main focus
of Sections 14.4 onwards in this chapter and of Chapter 15.
14.3.3.4 MAC Layer Delays
MAC delays are introduced at the ATM layer by the underlying MAC
layer. In the broadband satellite network, the time slot allocation within a
frame can cause cells arriving during a TOMA frame to wait for an available
time slot to be transmitted. This could introduce cell delay variations, which
may be as large as one TOMA frame duration. In addition, some delay
variations may be introduced when cells from different Virtual Connections
(VCs) arriving on a high-speed ATM interface are transmitted on lower speed
links, which causes cell-clumping. The COV due to cell clumping is not
expected to be a major contributor to the COV budget.
14.3.3.5 Onboard Processing Delays
The onboard switch contributes to CTO of about 20 ms in addition to
the transfer delays in the priority queues. It also yields a COV of up to 2.5 ms
in addition to the delay variation in the priority queue buffer, where the COV
is defined as the standard deviation of CTO. Both the CTO and COV are
variable and depend on the traffic loading of the switch. The 2-point COV is
defined as the upper bound on the difference between upper and lower 10.8
quantiles ofCTO. The onboard buffer sizing is critical for the QoS.
14.3.3.6 Receive Terminal Smoothing Buffer
The traffic shaping buffer is typically at least one TOMA frame long
and could introduce an additional delay and delay variation. Proper buffer
design is critical to minimize the impact on the QoS performance.
14.3.3.7 Timing Synchronization
At the transmit terminal, the receive
clock from the terrestrial
equipment may be slightly different from the TOMA transmit frame clock.
This will cause either the cell arrival rate to exceed the transmit rate or the cell
transmit rate to exceed the arrival rate. In the former case extra cells may be
delayed for one frame or may be discarded. The latter case may require either
transmission of a lesser number of cells in a frame or an insertion of unwanted
cells. The
timing accuracies (earth
terminal
clock, onboard clock
and
terrestrial
clock), and
the
interface timing techniques impact
the QoS
performance.

14.4 BUFFER SIMULATION MODEL
Traffic management tries to minimize traffic revenue subject to
constraints of traffic contracts, QoS and fairness . The traffic management
problem is especially difficult during periods of heavy load particularly if
traffic demands cannot be predicted in advance. For this reason, congestion
control [277,278] is an essential part of traffic management.
For the congestion control schemes to function properly, the onboard
payload buffer requirements have to be developed. This section develops a
buffering model and simulation results are provided in the folIowing sections
for TCP traffic over SatelIite ATM providing UBR service .
14.4.1 Buffering Requirements
In order to assess the minimum buffering requirements, the behavior
of the selected data transmission protocol under the various impairments of
the space communications path must be analyzed and/or simulated. Since all
Internet traffic
is carried using the TCP/IP protocol suite, considerable
resources in both industry and standard organizations have been dedicated to
enhance the performance of the TCP protocol over satellite networks . Many
approaches incorporate special protocols only within the space segment of the
network and provide gateways at the interface to make the satellite network
appear more or less "transparent" to the terrestrial network. In order to
determine the minimum buffering requirements, the following parameters
must be considered.
Propagation delay: In any network, the functions of flow control,
error detection and recovery must be performed at some protocol layer. For
Internet traffic, this function is performed by the TCP protocol. TCP performs
its control functions by the return transmission of acknowledgment messages
denoting the receipt of specific message segments. When a segment has not
been acknowledged within certain limits, the segment is assumed lost and is
retransmitted by the source. If several segments in sequence are lost, TCP
assumes congestion in the network and reduces the rate of data transmission.
The round trip propagation time through the network will affect the time for
recovery of lost data segments and regaining optimum transmission speed and
therefore directly affects the overall transmission efficiency.

Quality of Service in Satellite ATM Networks
343
Delay variation: As discussed
earlier, delay vananon, including
discontinuities due to handovers, particularly in LEO satellite networks, must
be taken into account in the determination of buffer sizes.
Link error characteristics: In space
communications,
bit-errors
caused by noise are not uncommon . To some degree, forward error correction
can compensate for such errors, but the space link is rarely as clean as those
of modern terrestrial networks. The effects of transmission efficiency of the
loss of packets due to noise and the consequent retransmission of data
segments must be considered when determining buffer sizes.
Transmission protocol characteristics:
ATM
provides
different
quality of services to applications such as real-time voice traffic and e-mail
transfers, which requires assigning different priorities. Generally, different
priority traffic is queued in separate buffers. The Quality of Service categories
to be provided by the network and the prioritization policies of the network
will also affect the number and size of buffers that must be provided. Network
design must be provided for scalability as the number of independent data
flows is increased and fairness in the assignment of resources among data
flows.
Data buffering is required for following reasons:
â€¢
To temporarily store cells at the payload until resources are available
to process and forward them to the downlink
â€¢
To allocate the available capacity of the communications link among
various flows in a "fair" manner, in accordance with the transmission
policies
â€¢
To temporarily store cells until their recipient is acknowledged by the
destination
â€¢
To allow retransmission of any cells which are not received by the
destination (if needed)
The buffering delay at any buffer is a function of the buffer size
divided by the rate at which cells are serviced from the buffer. To minimize
buffering delay, buffer size must be kept as small as possible. Buffer size,
however, must be large enough to avoid frequent loss of cells due to buffer
overflow,
which
would
require
retransmission
of the
lost
cells
with
consequently increased transmission delay
for cell transfer and loss of
network efficiency.
Buffers are necessary at any network congestion point and at any
node where several data flows are aggregated into a single data stream. In a
satellite network, buffers are usually placed at the input to the satellite
network (the source earth station) and, if the satellites aggregate multiple data
streams, also at the input of each satellite with onboard ATM switch. Clearly,

344
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
since a typical transmission via a LEO network involves relaying by a greater
number of satellites, transmission via a LEO network will generally involve a
much larger number of buffers than transmissions via an equivalent GEO
network.
14.5 TCP TRANSPORT OVER SATELLITE ATM - UBR
Satellite ATM networks can be used to provide broadband access to
remote locations, as well as to serve as an alternative to fiber-based backbone
networks. In either case, a single satellite is designed to support thousands of
Earth terminals. The Earth terminals set up virtual channels (YCs) through the
onboard satellite switches to transfer ATM cells among one another. Because
of the limited capacity of a satellite switch, each Earth terminal has a limited
number of YCs it can use for TCP/IP data transport. In backbone networks,
these
Earth
terminals
are
IP-ATM
edge
devices that
terminate
ATM
connections, and router IP traffic in and out of the ATM network . These high-
capacity backbone routers must handle thousands of simultaneous IP flows.
As a result, the routers must be able to aggregate multiple IP flows onto
individual YCs. Flow classification may be done by means of a QoS manager
that can use IP source-destination address pairs, as well as transport layer port
numbers. The QoS manager can further classify IP packets into flows based
on the DiffServ code points in the TOS byte ofthe IP header.
In addition to flow and YC management, Earth terminals also provide
a means of congestion control between the IP and ATM networks. The
onboard ATM switches must perform traffic management at the cell and YC
levels. In addition, TCP hosts implement various TCP flow and congestion
control mechanisms for effective network bandwidth utilization . Figure 14.4
illustrates a framework for the various design options available to networks
and TCP hosts for congestion control. The techniques in the figure can be
used to implement various ATM services in the network. Enhancements that
perform
intelligent buffer management policies at the switches can be
developed for Unspecified Bit Rate (UBR) to improve transport layer
throughput and fairness. A policy for selective cell drop based on per-YC
accounting can be used to improve fairness.

Providing a minimum Guaranteed Rate (GR) to UBR traffic has been
discussed as a possible candidate to improve TCP performance over UBR.
The goal of providing GR is to protect the UBR service category from total
bandwidth
starvation,
and
provide
a
continuous
minimum
bandwidth
guarantee. It has been shown that in the presence of high load of higher
priority CBR, VBR, and ABR traffic, TCP congestion control mechanisms
benefit from a minimum GR.
In addition to network-based drop policies, end-to-end flow control
and
congestion
control
policies
can
be
effective
in
improving
TCP
performance over UBR. The fast retransmit and recovery mechanism can be
used in addition to slow start and congestion avoidance to quickly recover
from isolated segment losses. The selective acknowledgment option has been
proposed to recover quickly from multiple segment losses. The following
sections discuss the design and performance issues for TCP over UBR and
ABR services for satellite network.
In its simplest form, an ATM switch implements a tail drop policy for
the UBR service category. If cells are dropped, the TCP source loses time
waiting
for
the
retransmission
timeout.
Even
though
TCP
congestion
mechanisms effectively recover from loss, the link efficiency can be very low,
especially for large delay-bandwidth networks. In general , link efficiency can
be very
low, especially for large delay-bandwidth networks. The
link
efficiency typically increases with increasing buffer size. Performance of TCP
over UBR can be improved using buffer management policies. In addition,
TCP performance is also affected by TCP congestion control mechanisms and

346
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
TCP parameters such as segment size, timer granularity, receiver window
size, slow start threshold, and initial window size.
TCP Reno implements the fast retransmit and recovery algorithms
that enable the connection to quickly recover from isolated segment losses.
However, fast
retransmit and
recovery cannot efficiently recover from
multiple packet losses within the same window.
TCP with selective acknowledgments (TCP SACK) is designed to
efficiently recover from multiple segment losses. With SACK, the sender can
recover from multiple dropped segments in about one round-trip. Studies on
the comparison of TCP and drop policies for persistent traffic over satellite
ATM show that in low-delay networks, the effect of network based buffer
management policies is very important and can dominate the effect of SACK.
The throughput improvement provided by SACK is very significant for long-
latency connections. When the propagation delay is large, timeout results in
the loss of a significant amount of time during slow start from a window of
one segment. Reno TCP results in the worst performance because timeout
occurs at a much lower window than in Vanilla TCP. With TCP SACK, a
timeout is avoided most of the time, and recover is completed within a small
number of round-trips. For lower-delay satellite network, both NewReno and
TCP SACK provide high throughput, but as the latency increases, SACK
significantly outperforms NewReno, Reno, and Vanilla.
UBR+: Enhancements to UBR
In the proposals for fair buffer management for best effort network
traffic, packets are dropped when the buffer occupancy exceeds a certain
threshold. Most buffer management schemes improve the efficiency of TCP
over UBR. However, only some of the schemes affect the fairness properties
of TCP over UBR. The proposals for buffer management can be classified
into four groups based on whether they maintain multiple buffer occupancies
(multiple accounting, MA) or a single global
buffer occupancy (single
accounting, SA), and whether they use multiple discard thresholds (multiple
thresholds, MT) or a single global discard threshold (single threshold, ST).
Table 14.3 lists the four classes of buffer management schemes and examples
of schemes for these classes. The schemes are briefly described below [225].
The SA schemes maintain a single account of the number of cells
currently in the buffer. The MA schemes classify the traffic into several
classes and maintain a separate count for the number of cells in the buffer for
each class. Typically, each class corresponds to a single connection, and these
schemes maintain per-connection occupancies. In cases where the number of
connections far exceeds the buffer size, the added overhead of per-connection
accounting may be very expensive. In this case, a set of active connections

Quality of Service in Satellite ATM Networks
347
can be defined as those connections with at least one cell in the buffer, and
only the buffer occupancies ofactive connections need to be maintained.

packet tags are the CLP bit in ATM cells or the TOS octet in the IP header of
the DiffServ architecture.
The SA-ST schemes include Early Packet Discard (EPD), Partial
Packet Discard (PPD), and Random Early Detection (RED). EPD and PPD
improve network efficiency because they minimize the transmission of partial
packets by the network. Since they do not discriminate between connections
in dropping packets, these schemes are unfair in allocating bandwidth to
competing connections. RED maintains a global threshold for the average

348
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
queue. When the average queue exceeds this threshold, RED drops packets
probabilistically.
Flow RED (FRED) maintains per-connection buffer occupancies and
drops packets probabilistically if the per-connection occupancy exceeds the
average queue length. In addition, FRED ensures that each connection has at
least a minimum number of packets in the queue . FRED can be classified as
one that maintains per-connection queue lengths, but has global threshold
(MA-ST).
The Selective Drop and Fair Buffer Allocation (FBA) schemes are
MA-ST schemes proposed for the ATM UBR service category.
These
schemes use
per-connection accounting to
maintain
the current buffer
utilization of each UBR Vc. A fair allocation is calculated for each VC, and
during congestion (indicated when the total buffer occupancy exceeds a
threshold), if the VC's buffer occupancy exceeds its fair allocation, its
subsequent incoming packet is dropped . Both SD and FBA improve both the
fairness and efficiency of TCP over UBR. This is because cells from
overloading connections are dropped in preference to underloading ones.
The Virtual Queuing (VQ) scheme achieves equal buffer allocation
by emulating on a single FIFO queue, a per-VC queue round-robin server. At
each cell transmit time, a per-VC variable (y,) is decremented in a round-
robin manner, and is incremented whenever a cell of that VC is admitted in
the buffer. When y, exceeds a fixed threshold, incoming packets of the ith
VC are dropped. An enhancement called dynamic EPD changes the above
drop threshold to include only those sessions that are sending less than their
fair shares.
Since the above MA-ST schemes compare the per-connection queue
lengths (or virtual variables with equal weights) with global threshold, they
can only guarantee equal buffer occupancy (and thus throughput) to the
competing connections. These
schemes
do not allow
for specifying a
guaranteed rate for connections or groups of connections. Moreover, in their
present forms, they cannot support packet discard levels based on tagging.
Another enhancement to VQ, called MCR scheduling, proposes the
emulation of a weighted scheduler to provide MCR guarantees to ATM
connections. In this scheme, a per-VC weighted variable (W,) is updated in
proportion to the VC's MCR, and compared with a global threshold.
PME+ERED, a combination of a Packet Marking Engine (PME) and an
enhanced RED scheme based on per-connection accounting and multiple
thresholds (MA-MT), is designed for IP networks and can provide loose rate
guarantees to connections. The PME measures per-connection bandwidths

Quality of Service in Satellite ATM Networks
349
and probabilistically marks packets if the measured bandwidths are lower than
the target bandwidths (MT). High-priority packets are marked, and low-
priority packets unmarked. The ERED mechanism is similar to RED except
that the probability of discarding marked packets is lower than that of
discarding unmarked packets.
The Dynamic FBA (DFBA) scheme proposed for the ATM GFR
service
provides
MCR
guarantees
for
VCs
carrying
multiple
TCP
connections. DFBA maintains high and low target buffer occupancy levels for
each VC, and performs probabilistic drop based on a VC's buffer occupancy
and its target thresholds. The scheme gives priority to CLP = 0 cells over CLP
= 1 cells.
A simple SA-MT scheme can be designed that implements multiple
thresholds based on packet discard levels. When the global queue length (SA)
exceeds the first threshold, packets with the lowest and the next discard level
are dropped. This process continues until EPD/PPD is performed on all
packets.
For satellite ATM networks TCP congestion control mechanisms
have more effect on TCP throughput than ATM buffer management policies.
However, these drop policies are necessary to provide fair akocation of link
capacity, to provide differentiated services based on discard levels, and to
provide MCR guarantees to low-priority VCs.
The Early Packet Discard (EPD) policy [279] maintains a threshold R
in the switch buffer. When the buffer occupancy exceeds R, all new incoming
packets are dropped. Partially received packets are accepted if possible. In
terrestrial networks, EPD improves the efficiency of TCP over UBR but does
not improve fairness. The effect of EPD on satellite latencies has not been
exhaustively studied.
The Selective Drop (SD) policy [280] uses per-VC accounting to
keep track of current buffer utilization of each UBR Vc. A fair allocation is
calculated for each VC and if the VC's buffer occupancy exceeds its fair
allocation, its subsequent incoming packet is dropped. The scheme maintains
a threshold R, as a fraction of the buffer capacity K. When the total buffer
occupancy (X) exceeds R x K, new packets are dropped depending on the
VC;'s buffer occupancy (Y.). In SD, a VC's entire packet is dropped if
(X > R x K) AND rv,X Na/X > Z)

where N; is the number of active YCs (YCs with at least one cell in
the buffer) and Z is another threshold parameter (0 < Z < = 1) used to scale

350

the effective drop threshold. In terrestrial networks, SO has been shown to
improve the fairness TCP connections running over UBR.
UBR with Guaranteed Rate Allocation
A multiserver satellite network will transport higher priority variable
bit rate traffic along with UBR traffic. The effect of higher priority traffic on
TCP over UBR has not been studied before.
14.5.1 Simulation Model
Figure 14.5 shows the basic network simulation configuration [281J.
In the figure, the switches represent the earth stations that connect to the
satellite constellation. The entire satellite network is assumed to be of 155
Mbps ATM link without any onboard processing or queuing. All processing
and queuing are performed at the earth stations. All sources are identical,
infinite and unidirectional TCP sources. Two different configurations are
simulated that represent multiple LEO hops and a single GEO hop. The link
delays
between
the
switches
and
the
end
systems
are
5
ms
in all
configurations. The inter-switch (earth station to earth station) propagation
delays are 100 ms, and 275 ms for LEO and GEO configurations respectively.
The maximum value of the TCP receiver window is 2,500,000 bytes and
8,704,000 bytes for LEO and GEO. These window sizes are sufficient to fill
the155.52 Mbps links. The TCP maximum segment size is 9180 bytes. The
duration of simulation is 100 seconds. All link bandwidths are 155.52 Mbps,
and peak cell rate at the ATM layer is 149.7 Mbps after the SONET overhead.
The buffer sizes (in cells) used in the switch are:
LEO: 780, 1500, 3125, 6250, 12.5K, 50K (= I RTT), and lOOK.
GEO: 3375, 6750, 12500, 25K, 50K, lOOK, 200K (=1 RTT), and
400K.

14.5.2 Performance Metrics
351
When ATM networks carry TCP data, the end-to-end performance is
measured at the TCP layer in the form of TCP throughput. To measure
network performance, the throughputs of all TCPs passing through the
bottleneck link are added and expressed as a fraction of the total capacity of
the bottleneck link. This is called the efficiency of the network.
Let N TCP source-destination pairs send data over a network with
bottleneck link capacity R bits/soLet Xi be the observed throughput of the ith
TCP source (0 < i < N). Let C be the maximum TCP throughput achievable
on the link.
Definition 1 (Efficiency, E)
The efficiency of the network is the ratio of the sum of the actual TCP
throughputs to the maximum possible throughput achievable at the TCP layer:
I
,=N x
E(xl"" 'x N ,C) =
'c~'
(14.6)
The TCP throughputs Xi' S are measured at the destination TCP layers.
Throughput is defined as the total number of bytes delivered to the destination
application
(excluding
retransmission
and
losses)
divided
by the
total
connection time.
The
maximum
possible
TCP
throughput
C
is
the
throughput
attainable by the TCP layer running over an ATM network with link capacity
R. For example, consider TCP over UBR on a 155.52 Mbps link with a 9180
byte TCP MSS. For 9180 bytes of data, the ATM layer receives 9180 bytes of
data with 20 bytes of TCP header, 20 bytes of IP header, 8 bytes of Logical
Link Control (LLC) header and 8 bytes of AALS trailer. These are padded to
produce 193 ATM cells. Thus, each TCP segment results in 10229 bytes at
the
ATM
layer.
From
this,
the
maximum
possible
throughput
~ 9180/1 0299 ~ 89.7 per cent ~ 135 Mbps. It should be noted that ATM layer
throughput does not necessarily correspond to TCP level throughput, because
some bandwidth may be wasted during TCP retransmissions.
In addition to providing high overall throughput, the network must
also allocate throughput fairly among competing connections. The definitions

352
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
of fairness is determined by the particular service guarantees. For example,
although UBR makes no service guarantees, fairness for TCP over UBR can
be defined as the ability for UBR to provide equal throughput to all greedy
TCP connections. Fairness for TCP over a best effort service is measured
using the fairness index F.
Definition 2 (Fairness Index, F)
The fairness index is a function of the variability of the throughput
across the TCP connections defined as
.
",= N
/
?
(LJ'=I x, e,)-
FÂ«xl'el),Â·Â·Â·,(xlI,eN Â» =

(x/e) -
LJ,=I
'
,
(14.7)
where Xi is the observed throughput ofthe ith TCP connection (0 < i <
N), and ei the expected throughput or fair share for the ith TCP connection.
For a symmetrical configuration using TCP over UBR, ei can be
defined as an equal share of the bottleneck link capacity (ei = CIN). Thus, the
fairness index metric applies well to N-source symmetrical configurations. In
this case, it is to be noted that when XI = X2 = ... = x, then fairness index = I.
Also, low values of fairness
index represent poor
fairness
among the
connections. The desired values of the fairness index must be close to I. A
fairness index of 0.99 is considered to be near perfect. A fairness index of 0.9
may not be acceptable depending on the application and the number of
sources involved. Also jt should be noted that the fairness index might not be
a good metric for a small number of connections. Details on the fairness
metric can be found in [259]. In general, for a more complex configuration,
the value of e, can be derived from a rigorous formulation of a fairness
definition that provides max-min fairness to the connections.
14.5.3 Simulation Parameters
The effects ofthe following parameters is studied:
Latency: The primary aim is to study the performance of large latency
connections. The typical one-way latency from earth station to earth station
for a single LEO 9700 km altitude, 60 degrees elevation angle) hop is about 5
ms. The one-way latencies for multiple LEO hops can easily be up to 50 ms
from earth station to earth station . GEO one-way latencies are typically 275
ms from earth station to earth station. These three latencies (5 ms, 50 ms, and
275 ms) with various number of sources and buffer sizes are studied.

Quality of Service in Satellite ATM Networks
353
Number ofsources: To ensure that the recommendations are scalable
and general with respect to the number of connections, configurations are
used with 5, IS and 50 TCP connections on a single bottleneck link. For
single hop LEO configurations, IS, 50 and 100sourcesare used.
Buffersize: This is the most importantparameter of this study. The set
of values chosen are 2-k x Round Trip Time (RTT), k = -1 ..6, (i.e., 2, I, 0.5,
0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.031 , 0.016 multiples of the round trip delay-bandwidth
product of the TCP connections.) The buffer size is plotted against the
achieved TCP throughput for different delay-bandwidth products and number
of sources.
Switchdroppolicy: SelectiveDrop Policy is used.
End systempolicies: An enhanced version of TCP called SACK TCP
has been used for this study. SACK TCP improves performance by using
selectiveacknowledgments for retransmission [179].

Figure 14.7: Single hop GEO
For very small buffer sizes, (0.031 x RTT, 0.0625 x RTT), the
resulting TCP throughput is very low. In fact, for a large number of sources
(N=50), the throughput is sometimes close to zero. For moderate buffer sizes
(less than
I round trip delay-bandwidth), TCP throughput increases with
increasing buffer sizes. TCP
throughput asymptotically approaches the
maximal value with further increase in buffer sizes. TCP performance over
UBR for sufficiently large buffer sizes is scalable with respect to the number
of TCP sources. The throughput is never 100%, but for buffers greater than
0.5 x RTT, the average TCP throughput is over 98% irrespective of the
number of sources. Fairness is high for a large number of sources. This shows
that TCP sources with a good per-VC buffer allocation policy like selective
drop, can effectively share the link bandwidth [281].
Example: Consider a GEO satellite ATM network in the real world,
with 64 downlink beams,
8 gateway beams
and 2 InterSatellite Links
supporting ATM classes of service. Assume downlink data rate of 100Mbps
per downlink beam, data rates of 155 Mbps per gateway beam, and 340 Mbps
per InterSatellite Link. Normally CBR, rt-VBR, and nrt-VBR may not require
buffering if peak rate is reserved. Whereas, the buffering required can be
calculated for UBR or ABR service to be approximately about 6500 KCells.
The buffer size required is way within the optimal size as shown in figure
14.7.

15.1 INTRODUCTION 
We described the satellite link impairments and the necessary TCP 
enhancements for satellite networks in Chapter 7. Several design options exist 
for transporting TCP over satellite with on board A TM switch. These design 
options include: (a) end system policies - Vanilla TCP, Selective ACK, Fast 
Retransmit, and Recovery (b) buffer management - Early Packet Discard 
(EPD), Tail Drop, per-VC accounting (c) feedback control - explicit rate, 
end-to-end, hop-by-hop and (d) queue management - per-class queuing, per-
VC queuing. In the previous chapter, we described simulation results for 
buffer requirements using satellite A TM UBR service. 
In this chapter simulation results on the performance of TCP 
enhancements over ATM-UBR+ for satellite latencies with limited switch 
buffer for WWW traffic are presented. Analysis results of the impact of TCP 
flavors such as Fast Retransmit and Recovery, New Reno, SACK and drop 
policies such as EPD and Selective Drop (SO) on LEO, MEO, GEO satellite 
configurations for several buffer sizes are discussed. [129] These results 
provide design guidelines for buffer sizing in A TM based satellite networks.

15.3 WWW TRAFFIC MODEL
The WWW uses Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP uses
TCP/IP for communication between WWW client and WWW servers [284].
Modeling of the WWW traffic is difficult because of the changing nature of
web traffic. In this section, the model used here and the inherent assumptions
are outlined.
15.3.1 Implications of the HTTP/I.l standard
The main difference between version 1.1 of the Hypertext Transfer
Protocol, HTTP/I .I [285], and earlier versions is the use of persistent TCP
connections as the default behavior for all HTTP connections. In other words,
a new TCP connection is not set up for each HTTP/I .I request. The HTTP
client and the HTTP server assume that the TCP connection is persistent until
a Close request is sent in the HTTP Connection header field. Another
important difference between HTTP/I .I and earlier versions is that the HTTP
client can make multiple requests without waiting for responses from the
server (called pipeliningy. The earlier models were closed-loop in the sense
that each request needed a response before the next request could be sent.
15.3.2 WWW Server Model
The WWW servers are modeled as infinitely fast servers getting file
requests from WWW clients. The model is an extension of that specified in
SPECweb96 benchmark [286]. In this model, a WWW server, on receiving a
request from a WWW client sends some data back. The amount of data to be
sent (the requested file size) is determined by classifying the client request
into one of five classes (Class 0 through Class 4), shown in table 15.1. As
shown in the table, 20% of the requests are classified as Class 0 requests, i.e.,
less than I KB of data is sent in response. Similarly 28% of the file requests
are classified as Class I requests and so on. The file size range of each class
and the percentage ofclient requests falling in that class are also shown.
There are nine discrete sizes in each class (e.g. Class I has I KB, 2
KB, up to 9 KB and Class 2 has 10 KB, 20 KB, through 90 KB and so on.).
Within a class, one of these nine file sizes is selected according to a Poisson
distribution with mean 5. The model of discrete sizes in each class is based on
the SPECweb96 benchmark [286]. There are three key differences from the
SPEC model. First, an infinite server is assumed, i.e. no processing time taken
by server for a client request. Secondly, a new class of file sizes (I MB - 10

Performance Analysis ofTCl' over Satellite ATM
357
MB), which allows to model file sizes larger than those in the SPEC
benchmark is created. Finally, the percentage distribution of client requests
had to be changed into server file size classes to accommodate the new class.
The reason for a new class of file sizes is to model the downloading
of large software and offline browsing of search results. The percentages of
requests falling into each of file size classes have been changed so that
average requested file size is around
120 KB, as opposed to 15 KB in
SPECweb96 model. The new figure better represents the current WWW
traffic scenario. The reason for having 20% of the requests classified as Class
orequests is explained in next sub-section.

15.3.3 WWW Client Model
The HTTP-model in [286] describes an empirical model of WWW
clients based on observations in a LAN environment. Specifically, a typical
client is observed to make, on the average, four HTTP GET requests for a
single document. Multiple requests are needed to fetch inline images, if any.
With the introduction of JAVA scripts in web pages, additional accesses
maybe required to fetch the scripts. Therefore, five is used as the average
number of HTTP GET requests. In the model, a WWW client makes I to 9
requests for a single document, Poisson distributed around a mean of 5. These
requests are separated by a random time interval between 100 ms to 500 ms.
Caching effects at the clients are ignored.
Typically, the first request from an HTTP client accesses the index
page (plain text), which is of size I KB or less. Since every fifth request is
expected to be an index page access, WWW server classifies 20% (= 1/5) of
the client requests as Class 0 requests and sends I KB or less data in response.
A time lag between batches of requests (presumably for the same
document) that corresponds to the time taken by the user to request a new
document, as a constant, 10 seconds is also modeled. While this may be too

358
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
short a time for a human user to make decisions, it also weights the possibility
of offline browsing where the inter-batch time is much shorter.
The user behavior is not modeled across different servers. The main
purpose of using this simplistic model is to approximate the small loads
offered by individual web connections, and to study the effects of aggregation
of such small loads on the network.

SIMULATION
EXPERIMENTS
CONFIGURATION
AND
The configuration shown in Figure 15.1 consists of 100 WWW clients
being served by 100 WWW servers, one server for each client. Both WWW
clients and servers use underlying TCP connections for data transfer. The
switches implement the UBR+ service with optional drop policies described
before. The following subsections describe various configuration, TCP and
switch parameters used in the simulations. A client makes I to 9 requests
(Poisson distributed around a mean of 5) every 10 seconds. Server classifies
each client request in one of 5 classes. Frequency of Access of a class
indicates how often a client request is classified as belonging to that class.
File Size Range associated with each class consists of 9 equally spaced
discreet sizes. A file size among 9 in the range is chosen according to a
Poisson distribution with mean 5. Finally, server sends the file as and when
allowed by underlying TCP connection.

Figure 15.1: Simulation configuration
15.4.1 Configuration Parameters
The configuration consists of 100 WWW client-server connections
using TCP for data transfer. Links connecting server/client TCPs to switches
have a bandwidth of 155.52 Mbps (149.76 Mbps after SONET overhead), and
a one-way delay of 5 microseconds. The link connecting the two switches
simulates the desired (WAN/LEO/MEO/GEO) link respectively and has a
bandwidth of 45Mbps (T3). The corresponding one-way link delays are 5ms

(WAN),
lOOms (multi
hop
LEO/single hop MEa) and 275ms (GEO)
respectively. Since the propagation delay on the links connecting client/server
Tops to switches is negligible compared to the delay on the inter-switch link,
the round trip times (RTTs) due to propagation delay are 10ms, 200ms and
550ms respectively. All simulations run for 100 seconds. Since every client
makes a new set of requests every 10 seconds, the simulations run for 10
cycles of client requests .
15.4.2 TCP Parameters
Underlying
TCP
connections
send
data
as
specified
by
the
client/server applications. A WWW client asks its TCP to send a 128 byte
packet as a request to the WWW server TCP. TCP maximum segment size
(MSS) is set to 1024 bytes for LEO simulations and 9180 bytes otherwise.
TCP timer granularity is set to 100 ms. TCP maximum receiver window size
is chosen so that it is always greater than RTT-bandwidth product of the path.
Such a value of receiver window ensures that receiver window does not
prevent sending TCPs from filling up the network pipe. For LEO links (10 ms
RTT due to propagation delay), the default receiver window size of 64K is
sufficient. For MEa links (200 ms RTT), RTT-bandwidth product in bytes is
1,125,000 bytes. By using the TCP window scaling option and having a
window scale factor of 5, a maximum window size of 2,097, I20 bytes is
achieved. Similarly, for GEO links (550 ms RTT), the RTT-bandwidth
product in bytes is 3,093 ,750 bytes. A window scale factor of 6 is used to
achieve maximum window size of 4, I94,240 bytes. TCP "Silly Window
Syndrome Avoidance" is disabled because in WWW traffic many small
segments (due to small request sizes, small file sizes or last segment of a file)
have to be sent immediately. Instead of having a fixed initial SSTHRESH of
64 KB, the RTT-bandwidth product of the path should be used as initial
SSTHRESH. In these
simulations, the
round
trip
propagation
delay
-
bandwidth product has been used as the initial SSTHRESH value. Hence the
initial SSTHRESH values for LEO, MEa and GEO
links are 56,250,
I, I25,000 and 3,093,750 bytes respectively. The TCP delay ACK timer is
NOT set. Segments are ACKed as soon as they are received.
15.4.3 Switch Parameters
The drop threshold R is 0.8 for both drop policies - Early Packet
Discard (EPO) and Selective Drop (SO) For SO simulations, threshold Z also
has a value 0.8. Three different values of buffer sizes are used in these
experiments. These buffer sizes approximately correspond to 0.5 RTT, 1 RTT
and 2 RTT - bandwidth products of the end-to-end TCP connections for each

360
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
of the three propagation delays respectively. For LEO delays, the largest
buffer size is 2300 cells. This is a little more than the 2 RTT - bandwidth
product. The reason for selecting 2300 is that this is the smallest buffer size
that can hold one complete packet (MSS= I024 bytes) for each of the 100 TCP
connections. For LEO, 0.5 RTT and I RTT buffers are not sufficient to hold a
single packet from all TCPs. This problem will also occur in MEO and GEO
TCPs if the number of flows is increased. Some preliminary analysis has
shown that the buffer size required for good performance may be related to
the number of active TCP connections as well as the RTT-bandwidth product.
Further research needs to be performed to provide conclusive results of this
effect. Table 15.2 shows the switch buffer sizes used in the simulations.

15.5 PERFORMANCE METRICS
The performance of TCP is measured by the efficiency and fairness
index, which are defined as follows . Let Xi be the throughput of the ith WWW
server (I
~ i ~ 100). Let C be the maximum TCP throughput achievable on
the link. Let E be the efficiency of the network, E is defined as in Section 14.8
as
I= NLX,
E = ...!.=!..-
(15.1)
C
where N = 100 and LXi is sum of all 100 server throughputs.
The server TCP throughput values are measured at the client 'I'C]'
layers. Throughput is defined as the highest sequence number in bytes
received at the client from the server divided by the total simulation time. The
results are reported in Mbps.
Due to overheads imposed by TCP, JP, LLC and AAL5 layers, the
maximum possible TCP over UBR throughput over a 45Mbps link is much
less and depends on the TCP maximum segment size (MSS). For MSS = 1024
bytes (on LEO links), the ATM layer receives 1024 bytes of data + 20 bytes
of TCP header + 20 bytes of IP header + 8 bytes of LLC header + 8 bytes of

AAL5 trailer. These are padded to produce 23 ATM cells. Thus each TCP
segment of 1024 bytes results in 1219 bytes at the ATM layer. Thus, the
maximum possible TCP throughput e is 102411219 := 84%
:= 37.80Mbps
approximately on a 45Mbps link. Similarly, for MSS
= 9180 bytes (on
MEO,GEO links), e is 40.39Mbps approximately. Since, the "Silly Window
Syndrome Avoidance" is disabled (because of WWW traffic), some of the
packets have less than I MSS of data. This decreases the value of e a little.
However, the resulting decrease in the value of e has an insignificant effect
on the overall efficiency metric .
In all simulations, the 45Mbps(T3) link between the two switches is
the bottleneck. The maximum possible throughput e on this link is 37.80
Mbps (for WAN) and 40.39 Mbps (for MEOIGEO). The average total load
generated by 100 WWW servers is 48 MbpSI.
Fairness is measured by calculating the Fairness Index F defined as in
Section 14.8 by:
F=
(~xJe,)'
I= N
Nx:L(xl /e,Y
1=1
(15.2)
where N := 100 and ej is the expected throughput for connection i. In
the simulations, ej is the max-min fair share that should be allocated to server
i. On a link with maximum possible throughput e, the fair share of each ofthe
100 servers is ell 00. Let S, be the maximum possible throughput that a server
can achieve, calculated as the total data scheduled by the server for the client
divided by simulation time.
For all i for which S, < CII 00, ej := Sj, i.e., servers that schedule less
than their fair share are allocated their scheduled rates. This determines the
first iteration of the max-min fairness calculation. These ej's are subtracted
from C, and the remaining capacity is again divided in a max-min manner
among the
remaining connections. This
process
is continued
until all
remaining servers schedule more than the fair share in that iteration, in this
case ej := the fairshare.
9
I A WWW server gets on average 5 client requests every lOs and sends on average 120
KB ofdata for each request. This means that on average a WWW server schedules
60KBps i.e. 480Kbps of data. Hence average total load generated by 100 WWW servers
is 48Mbps.

15.6 SIMULATION ANALYSIS
In this section, a statistical analysis of simulation results for LEO,
MEO and GEO links and draw conclusions about optimal choices for TCP
flavor, switch buffer sizes and drop policy for these links is presented. The
analysis technique used here is described in detail in [259]. A brief description
of these techniques is given in this section. The following subsections present
simulation results for LEO, MEO and GEO links respectively [128].
15.6.1 Analysis Technique
The purpose of analyzing results of a number of experiments is to
calculate the individual effects of contributing factors and their interaction.
These effects can also help us in drawing meaningful conclusions about the
optimum values for different factors. In the present case, the effects of the
TCP flavor, buffer size and drop policy in determining the efficiency and
fairness for LEO, MEO and GEO links have to be analyzed. Thus, TCP
flavor, switch buffer size and drop policy are the 3 factors . The values a factor
can take are called 'levels' of the factor. For example, EPD and SO are two
levels of the factor 'Drop Policy'. Table 15.3 lists the factors and their levels
used in simulations.

The analysis is done separately for efficiency and fairness,
and
consists ofthe calculating the following terms:
Overall Mean: This consists of the calculation of the overall mean 'Y'
of the result (efficiency or fairness) .
Total Variation: This represents the variation in the result values
(efficiency or fairness) around the overall mean 'Y'. The goal of the analysis
to calculate, how much of this variation can be explained by each factor and
the interactions between factors .
Main Effects: These are the individual contributions of a level of a
factor to the overall result. A particular main effect is associated with a level
of a factor, and indicates how much variation around the overall mean is

Performance Analysis of TCP over Satellite ATM
363
caused by the level. The main effects of 4 TCP flavors, 3 buffer sizes, and 2
drop policies are calculated.
First Order Interactions: These are the interaction between levels of
two factors. In the experiments, there are first order interactions between each
TCP flavor and buffer size, between each drop policy and 'I'C]' flavor, and
between each buffer size and drop policy.
Allocation of Variation: This is used to explain how much each factor
contributes to the total variation.
Overall Standard Error: This represents the experimental error
associated with each result value. The overall standard error is also used in the
calculation of the confidence intervals for each main effect.
Confidence Intervals for Main Effects: The 90% confidence intervals
for each main effect are calculated. If a confidence interval contains 0, then
the corresponding level of the factor has no significant effect (with 90%
confidence) towards the result value (efficiency or fairness). If confidence
intervals of two levels overlap, then the effects of both levels are assumed to
be similar.
The first step of the analysis is the calculation of the overall mean 'V'
of all the values. The
next step
is the calculation of the individual
contributions of each level 'a' of factor 'A', called the 'Main Effect' . The
' Main Effect' of 'a' is calculated by subtracting the overall mean 'V' from the
mean of all results with 'a' as the value for factor 'A' . The 'Main Effects' are
calculated in this way for all the levels of each factor.
The interactions between levels of two factors is then calculated. The
interaction between levels of two factors is called ' First-order interaction'. For
calculating the interaction between level 'a' of factor 'A' and level 'b' of
factor 'B', an estimate is calculated for all results with 'a' and 'b' as values
for factors ' A' and 'B'. This estimate is the sum of the overall mean 'V' and
the 'Main Effects' of levels 'a' and 'b'. This estimate is subtracted from the
mean of all results with 'a' and 'b' as values for factors 'A' and ' B' to get the
' Interaction' between levels 'a' and 'b'. In the present analysis, only up to
'First-order interactions' are calculated. Generally, to get an accurate model
of simulation
results,
'Main
Effects'
and
'First-order interactions'
are
sufficient.
The calculation of the 'Total Variation' and 'Allocation of Variation '
are then performed. First, the value of the square of the overall mean 'V' is
multiplied by the total number of results. This value is subtracted from the
sum of squares of individual results to get the 'Total Variation' among the
results. The next step is the 'Allocation of Total Variation ' to individual
'Main Effects' and 'First-order interactions'. To calculate the variation caused
by a factor' A', the sum of squares of the main effects of all levels of 'A' is
taken and multiplied with the number of experiments conducted with each

364
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
level of'A'. For example, to calculate the variation caused by TCP flavor, the
sum of squares of the main effects of all its levels (Vanilla, Reno, NewReno
and SACK) is taken and multiplied by 6 (with each TCP flavor 6 different
simulations involving 3 buffer sizes and 2 drop 'policies are conducted). In this
way, the variation caused by all factors
is calculated. To calculate the
variation caused by first-order interaction between two factors ' A' and 'B',
the sum of squares of all the first-order interactions between levels of ' A' and
'B' is taken and multiplied with the number of experiments conducted with
each combination of levels of'A' and'B' .
The next step of the analysis is to calculate the overall standard error
for the results. This value requires calculation of individual errors in results
and the degrees of freedom for the errors. For each result value, an estimate is
calculated by summing up the overall mean 'Y', main effects of the parameter
levels for the result and their interactions. This estimate is subtracted from the
actual result to get the error 'ej' for the result.
If a factor' A' has 'N A' levels, then the total number of degrees of
freedom is n(NA) . Thus, for the analysis, the total number of degrees of
freedom is 4 x 2 x 3 = 24. The degrees of freedom associated with the overall
mean 'Y' is I. The degrees of freedom associated with 'main effects' of a
factor' A' are 'NA -
I'. Thus, degrees of freedom associated with all 'main
effects' are I(N A - I). Similarly, the degrees of freedom associated with first-
order interaction between 2 factors ' A' and 'B' are (NA - l) x(NB - I). Thus,
degrees of freedom associated with all first-order interactions are I(NA
-
I)x(N B - I), with the summation extending over all factors . In the analysis, the
degrees of freedom associated with all 'main effects' are 3 + I + 2 = 6 and the
degrees of freedom associated with all first-order interactions are (3 x I) + (3
x 2) + (I x 2) = II.
Since the overall mean 'Y', the main effects of individual levels and
their first-order interactions to calculate the estimate are used, the value of the
degrees of freedom for errors 'de' is calculated as follows:
d.Â» OW,)-I-IW,-I)-IW,-I)xWu-l)
(15.3)
In the present case, de= 24 - I - 6 - II = 6.
To calculate the overall standard error 's,', the sum of squares of all
individual errors 'ej' is divided by the number of degrees offreedom for errors
'de' (6 in the present case). The square root ofthe resulting value is the overall
standard error.
s, = ~rr-(f---'e,''''''''')/d-,
(15.4)
Finally, based on the overall standard error, the 90% confidence
intervals for all 'main effects' of each factor are calculated. For this purpose,

Performance Analysis ofTCP over Satellite ATM
365
the standard deviation 'SA' associated with each factor 'A' is calculated as
follows:
SI =s/~(N,-I)/n(NJ
(15.5)
Here, 'NA' is the number of levels for factor 'A' and D(NA) is the
total number of degrees of freedom.
The variation around the 'main effect' of all levels of a factor' A' to
get a 90% confidence level is given by the standard deviation 'SA' multiplied
by t[O.95.dJ, where t[O.95.dJ values are quantiles of the t distribution.
Hence, if 'MEa' is the value of the main effect of level 'a' of factor' A', then
the 90% confidence interval for 'MEa' is {MEaÂ± SA X t[O.95.dJ}. The main
effect value is significant only ifthe confidence interval does not include O.
15.7 SIMULATION RESULTS FOR LEO LINKS

LEO links. Table 15.5 shows the calculation of 'Total Variation' in LEO
results

main
effects
and
first-order
interactions. Table 15.6 shows the 90% confidence intervals for the main
effects. A negative value of main effect implies that the corresponding level
of the factor decreases the overall efficiency and vice versa. If a confidence
interval encloses 0, the corresponding level of the factor is assumed to be not
significant in determining performance.

Performance Analysis ofTCP over Satellite ATM
367
15.7.1 Analysis of Efficiency Values: Results and Observations
The following conclusions can be made from the above tables.
TCP type explains 57.5% of the variation and hence is the major
factor in determining efficiency.
It can be established from confidence
intervals of effects of different TCP types that NewReno and SACK have
better efficiency performance than Vanilla and Reno. Since the confidence
intervals of effects of SACK and NewReno overlap, it cannot be said that one
performs better than the other. Confidence intervals for the effects of Vanilla
and Reno suggest that Reno performs better than Vanilla.
Buffer size explains 30.24% of the variation and hence is the next
major determinant of efficiency. Confidence intervals for effects of different
buffer sizes clearly indicate that efficiency increases substantially as buffer
size is increased. However, on looking at the individual efficiency values, it
can be noticed that only Vanilla and Reno get substantial
increase in
efficiency as buffer size is increased from I RTT to 2 RTT.
The interaction between buffer size and TCP type explains 8.99% of
the variation. The large interaction is because of the fact that only Vanilla and
Reno show substantial gains in efficiency as the buffer size is increased from
I RTT to 2 RTT. For SACK and NewReno, increasing buffer sizes from 1
RTT to 2 RTT does not bring much increase in efficiency. This indicates that
SACK and NewReno can tolerate the level of packet loss caused by a buffer
size of] RTT.
Though the variation explained by drop policy is negligible, it can be
seen that for Vanilla and Reno, SO results in better efficiency than EPO for
the same buffer size. This is because for EPO, after crossing the threshold R,
all new packets are dropped and buffer occupancy does not increase much
beyond R. However for SO, packets of VCs with low buffer occupancy are
still accepted. This allows the buffer to be utilized more efficiently and fairly
and to better efficiency as well as fairness.
However, for NewReno and SACK, the efficiency values are similar
for EPO and SO for same buffer size. This is because NewReno and SACK
are much more tolerant of packet loss than Vanilla and Reno. Thus the small
decrease in number of packets dropped due to increased buffer utilization
does not cause a significant increase in efficiency.
It can be noticed from individual efficiency values that SACK
generally performs a little better than NewReno except when buffer size is

368
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
very low (0.5 RTT). Better performance ofNewReno for very low buffer size
can be explained as follows. Low buffer size means that a large number of
packets are dropped. When in fast retransmit phase, NewReno retransmits a
packet for every partial ACK received. However, SACK does not retransmit
any packet till pipe goes below CWND value. A large number of dropped
packets mean that not many duplicate or partial ACKs are forthcoming .
Hence pipe may not reduce sufficiently to allow SACK to retransmit all the
lost packets quickly. Thus, SACK's performance may perform worse than
NewReno under extreme congestion.
It can be concluded that SACK and NewReno give best performance
in terms of efficiency for LEO links. For NewReno and SACK, a buffer size
of 1 RTT seems to be sufficient for getting close to best efficiency with either
EPO or SO as the switch
drop policy. As discussed
before, buffer
requirements need to be verified for situations where number of flows is much
larger.
15.7.2 Analysis of Fairness values: Results and Observations
Buffer size largely determines fairness as 53.55 % of the variation is
explained by the buffer size. Confidence intervals for effects of buffer sizes
suggest that fairness increases substantially as buffer size is increased from
0.5 RTT to 1 RTT. Since confidence intervals for buffers of 1 RTT and 2
RTTs overlap, it cannot be concluded that 2 RTT buffers result in better
performance than 1 RTT buffers.
TCP type is the next major factor in determining fairness as it
explains 21.49 % of the variation. Confidence intervals for effects of TCP
type on fairness, clearly suggest that NewReno results in best fairness and
SACK results in the worst fairness.
SO only increases fairness for low buffer sizes. Overall, both the
allocation of variation to drop policy, and confidence intervals for effects of
SO and EPO suggest that SO does not result in higher fairness when
compared to EPO for bursty traffic in LEO links unless buffer sizes are small.
This result is interesting and means that per-jlow accounting to improve
fairness will be successful only in the presence of sufficiently large buffers.

15.8.1 Analysis of Efficiency values: Results and Observations
TCP flavor explains 56.75% of the variation and hence is the major
factor in deciding efficiency value. Non-overlapping confidence intervals for
effects of TCP flavors clearly indicate that SACK results in best efficiency
followed by NewReno, Reno and Vanilla. However, it should be noticed that
difference in performance for different TCP flavors is not very large.
Buffer size explains 21.73% of the variation and hence is the next
major determinant of efficiency. Confidence intervals for effects of different
buffer sizes indicate that efficiency does increase but only slightly as buffer
size is increased. However, Vanilla's efficiency increases by about 5% with
increase in buffer size from 0.5 RTT to 2 RTT. The corresponding increase in
efficiency for other TCP flavors is around 2% or less. This also explains the
large interaction between buffer sizes and TCP flavors (explaining 13.42% of
the total variation).
Drop policy does not cause any significant difference in efficiency
values.

performance for SACK and other TCP flavors is not substantial. For SACK,
NewReno and Fast Retransmit and Recovery (FRR), the increase in efficiency
with increasing buffer size is very small. For MEO links, 0.5 RTT seems to be
the optimal buffer size for all non-Vanilla TCP flavors with either EPD or SD
as drop policy' .
15.8.2 Analysis of Fairness values: Results and Observations
As can be seen from individual fairness values, there is not much
difference between fairness values for different TCP types, buffer sizes or
drop policies. This claim is also supported by the fact that all 9 main effects
have very small values, and for 8 of them, their confidence interval encloses
O. Thus, these simulations do not give us any information regarding fairness
performance of different options.

15.9.1 Analysis of Efficiency values: Results and Observations
TCP flavor explains 69.16% of the variation and hence is the major
factor in deciding efficiency value. Confidence intervals for effects of TCP
flavors clearly indicate that SACK results in substantially better efficiency
than other TCP flavors. Since confidence intervals overlap for NewReno,
Reno and Vanilla, one cannot be said to be better than other in terms of
efficiency.
Buffer size explains 13.65% of the variation and interaction between
buffer size and TCP flavors explains 7.54% of the variation . Confidence
intervals for 0.5 RTT and 1 RTT buffer overlap, thus indicating similar
performance. There is a marginal improvement in performance as buffer size
is increased to 2 RTT. Vanilla and Reno show substantial efficiency gains as
buffer size is increased from
I RTT to 2 RTT. There
is not much
improvement for Vanilla and FRR when buffer is increased from 0.5 RTT to
1 RTT. Hence, in this case, I RTT buffer does not sufficiently reduce number
of packets dropped to cause an increase in efficiency. However, for a buffer of
2 RTT, the reduction in number of dropped packets is enough to improve
Vanilla and Reno's performance.
Drop policy does not have an impact in terms of efficiency as
indicated by negligible allocation of variation to drop policy.
From the observations above, it can be concluded that SACK with 0.5
RTT buffer is the optimal choice for GEO links with either of EPD and SD as
switch drop policy.
15.9.2 Analysis of Fairness values: Results and Observations
The conclusion here is similar to MEO delays. As can be seen from
individual fairness values, there is not much difference between fairness
values for different TCP types, buffer sizes or drop policies. All 9 main
effects have very small values, and for 8 of them, their confidence intervals
enclose O. Thus, these simulations do not give us any information regarding
relative fairness performance of different options.
15.10 DISCUSSION
It is interesting to notice how the relative behavior of different TC}'
types change as link delay increases. As link delay increases, SACK clearly

374
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
comes out to be superior than NewReno in terms of efficiency. For LEO
delays, SACK and NewReno have similar efficiency values. For MEO delays,
SACK performs a little better than NewReno and for GEO delays, SACK
clearly outperforms NewReno. The reason for this behavior is that NewReno
needs N RTTs to recover from N packet losses in a window whereas SACK
can recover much faster and start increasing CWNO again. This effect
becomes more and more pronounced as RTT increases.
Per-flow accounting scheme SO does not always lead to increase in
fairness when compared to EPO. This result can partly be attributed to nature
of WWW traffic. SO accepts packets of only under-represented YCs after
crossing the threshold R. For sufficient buffer size, many of these YCs are
under represented in switch buffer because they do not have a lot of data to
send. Thus, SD fails to cause significant increase in fairness. Also, it seems
that per-flow accounting is useful only in presence of sufficiently large
buffers. It is intuition that required buffer size for a link is mainly determined
by its bandwidth-delay product as well as number of flows. Finding optimal
buffer size for given link and traffic conditions remains a research problem.
In summary, this simulation study indicates that as delay increases,
the marginal gains of end system policies become more important compared
to the marginal gains of drop policies and larger buffers.

16.1 INTRODUCTION
In Chapter 6, we described a number of TDMA based multiple
accesss schemes proposed and developed over the years. [119, 289]. These
schemes span from fully random access schemes such as ALOHA to hybrid

are not adequate enough to support the future broadband applications over
satellite ATM networks.
Many different traffic types, such as data, voice and video, need to be
supported simultaneously over the satelIite system. Each traffic type has
specific Quality of Service (QoS) performance parameters. TraditionalIy, slot
based uplink systems, such as TDMA, have to dynamicalIy allocate fixed
bandwidth resources, such as voice or trunk traffic, or dealt with traffic of a
single type. The uplink channel resources of a network capable, multimedia
satellite needs to be managed such that all of these traffic types can be
effectively and efficiently transported together in the same uplink beams that
are eventualIy aggregated in the input port of a typical on-board processing
satellite and switched to the appropriate downlink beam. If TDMA or MF-

Two key design chalIenges for a multimedia DAMA are: 1) how

today's legacy TDM networks, such as voice and video. CBR data has severe

that can be

16.1 INTRODUCTION 
In Chapter 6, we described a number of TDMA based mUltiple 
accesss schemes proposed and developed over the years. [119,289]. These 
schemes span from fully random access schemes such as ALOHA to hybrid 
reservation DAMA schemes at the other end of the spectrum. However, they 
are not adequate enough to support the future broadband applications over 
satellite A TM networks. 
Many different traffic types, such as data, voice and video, need to be 
supported simultaneously over the satellite system. Each traffic type has 
specific Quality of Service (QoS) performance parameters. Traditionally, slot 
based uplink systems, such as TDMA, have to dynamically allocate fixed 
bandwidth resources, such as voice or trunk traffic, or dealt with traffic of a 
single type. The uplink channel resources of a network capable, multimedia 
satellite needs to be managed such that all of these traffic types can be 
effectively and efficiently transported together in the same uplink beams that 
are eventually aggregated in the input port of a typical on-board processing 
satellite and switched to the appropriate downlink beam. If TDMA or MF-
TDMA were utilized, then a multimedia capable Demand Assignment 
Multiple Access (DAMA) approach would have to be developed to respect 
the diverse QoS needs. 
Two key design challenges for a multimedia DAMA are: I) how 
efficiently can the system handle multiple channels of CBR and packet types 
of traffic and 2) how to allocate the slots efficiently. Isochronous, or constant 
bit rate (CBR), traffic covers most all circuit switched traffic one can find on 
today's legacy TOM networks, such as voice and video. CBR data has severe 
constraints placed on the time delay and delay variation that can be 
experienced before degradation can occur such as loss of synchronization. 
Normal data transfers do not very stringent timing issues and so there always 
is an inherent priority given to CBR type of traffic.

In this chapter, the bandwidth allocation scheme analytical model by
Baskett, Chandy, Munt, and Palacios [290] has been adapted for satellite
ATM network. The simulation results for blocking probability vs. offered
load for CBR contiguous and non-contiguous allocations are presented.
16.2 TDMA/DAMA ANALYTICAL MODEL
Normally, user transmit rates can typically be in the range of a few
hundred kilobits per second (kbps) to well in the low Mbps. The terminal
uplink uses multiple access techniques that can be TOMA or multi-frequency
TOMA. The terminal downlink can be either multiple access or shared time
division multiplexing that is usually in excess of the uplink rates. The gateway
provides higher rate access links that are typically in the tens or to even
hundreds of Mbps in both the uplink and downlink.
The satellite spot beam antenna systems that support frequency and
spatial diversity to re-use the spectrum many times. Onboard channelization
and switching functions support multiple access on each uplink and downlink
coverage beam. Most
initial onboard
processing satellites will
deploy
switching systems with bandwidth in Gbps range. The uplink will support a
OAMA technique that can dynamically assign and re-assign bandwidth to
support terminal connectivity needs on an on-demand basis. In general the
terminal frequency space is assigned and reconfigured only when needed.
However, bandwidth is assigned to each terminal as it requests the time slots
either by an onboard controller or alternatively by a ground based controller.
The
terminals are capable of transmitting and
receiving many
different types of traffic to support a multitude of missions. There is an
increasing
need
to
simultaneously
transport
a
number of single
and
multimedia applications across wide areas.
A TOMA frame structure consisting of a number of slots is assumed .
Each user terminal requests time slots on the uplink channel to utilize
bandwidth through the payload OAMA basis. It is proposed that slots
assigned to a user need not be contiguous since a contiguous slot requirement
means that some requests could be denied even though sufficient bandwidth
exists (just not in a contiguous segment). An analytical model is proposed to
quantify the gain in uplink utilization due to the non- contiguous allocation
[291]. It is assumed that when the requested number of slots is not available,
the entire request is rejected . This assumption will hold for Constant Bit Rate
(CBR) requests and for Variable Bit Rate (VBR) requests of one slot.
The methodologies used are an exact analytic model of the system
without a contiguous slot requirement and a simulation for the contiguous

case. One advantage of using two approaches is that each model can be used
to validatethe other.
16.2.1 Frame Structure
Consider a superframe structure of N frames per superframe with
each frame consisting of n slots as illustrated in figure 16.1 . For the results in
this section, it is assumed that n=24; The value of N is irrelevant since the
model assumes relatively long holding times. A 16 Kbps call would require
one slot per frame as shown by the "x's" in the figure.

16.2.2 Non-Contiguous Slot Analytical Model
The following resource sharing model and its analysis is due to J. S.
Kaufman [282] and is shown in figure 16.2. Applying this to the current
system,the resource being shared is the collectionof DAMA slots in a frame.

Requestsfor resourcesarrive at a mean rate 'A and have two requirements:

The slots assigned to a request neednot be contiguous.
A. GeneralAssumptions

requirements. k is finite but arbitrary.
A2.
A request whose spatial requirement cannot be satisfied is

BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
B. Stochastic Assumptions
BI.
The slot requests arrive according to a stationary Poisson
process (with mean rate A).
B2.
The spatial requirement b IS an arbitrary discrete random
variable with probability density given by
P{b = bJ= q"i = 1,...,k ;
(16.1)
B3.
A customer with spatial requirement b, has residency time
t
whose distribution has a rational Laplace transform and whose mean is
denoted by 1/ u, .
Assumptions Bland B2 imply that requests requiring b, slots arrive
according to a Poisson process with mean rate
A., =A.q,
(16.2)
The offered load to the system is
p = I~=I A.q, / J-i,
(16.3)
Although some of the results in [282] also apply to the case of finite
sources, only the case of Poisson arrivals is considered. The Poisson arrival
assumption will be accurate for a large number of user terminals sharing the
same uplink channel.
C. Sharing Policy
It is assumed that the slots in a frame are completely shared by
competing requests. It is possible to extend the results to other sharing
policies (e.g., reserving some slots for particular types of sources).
The slots in the frame can be completely shared, or certain customers
may have exclusive use of the portions of the resource (slots) while the excess
commonly shared. The resource sharing policy has a strong effect on the
blocking experienced by different customers. In a complete sharing policy, a
customer requiring b units of the resource is blocked if and only if fewer than
b units ofthe total resource is available.
State Description
Assume that the residency times are exponentially distributed. The
state description is given by

Bandwidth Allocation - An Example
n = (n. ,...nd
where n, = number of slots occupied by source type i
379
otherwise
if n,- E Q
If each of the C slots of a type i source simultaneously require b, slots,
unlike blocking models with batched Poisson arrivals, all b, slots must be
simultaneously relinquished when the services is done. The notation is as
follows:
n,+ =(nl , â€¢â€¢â€¢n.; .n, + 1,n,+),
nk )
n,- = (n) ,..., n,_), n, - 1, n,+) ,
nk )
Q = set of allowable slot assignment states
{
I
if n,+ En
0,+(n) =
o
otherwise
o,-(n) = {
o
Because each resource sharing policy, gives rise to a set of Q of
allowable states, any set Q can be viewed as a resource sharing policy
provides that,
n e Cs rs n, ~O
i= I,...,k and n eb s C
(16.4)
State distribution for any resource sharing policy is described in the
following:
a. Partial Sharing Policy
Coordinate convex policies, for which the state distribution holds is
given by
n E n ~ n, ~ 0
i = I,..,k
and n E Q
and
n, > 0 ~ n, E n
{Q~
n:O~n,b, ~ C, +C,,, i~l ,....k; }

380
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
(16.5)
Type i source has C, units of slots dedicated and all sources contend
and share the remaining Co units. If C = 0, i=I,....k, we have complete
sharing policy and if Cj = Â°we have, in effect, k non shared slots, with
capabilities C" ....Ck.
b. Complete Sharing Policy with an Ordering Constraint
Although the resource is completely shared, the policy insists that
type i slots do not occupied more of the resource than type i+I slots. In the
coordinate convex policy, departures are never blocked. The details are found
in [290].
16.2.3 Solution to the Analytic Model

The performancemeasure is the blockingprobability.

where B,+ is defined by Eq. 16.6a.
It is interesting to observe that the resource sharing policy Q enters
the state distribution P(.) only via the normalization constant G( Q).
The normalization constant G( Q) is viewed as a set function G(.),
completely determines the blocking probabilities. In the special case of
complete sharing, the normalization constant is denotd by G(C,K) and Eq.

(16.10)
This is a familiar result from BCMP queuing networks [290] and
much applied work has been done in deriving efficient numerical methods for
computing the normalization constant above. The "BCMP" queuing networks
derive their name from the well-known four-author paper [290]. In the present
case, a real contribution of [282] was in developing a simple one-dimensional
recursion for computing the blocking probabilities.
16.2.4 The One-Dimensional Recursion
As discussed in previous section,
Q ={n :0 ~ n. b ~ c}
and
from
Eq.16.10 G(C,k)
is computed
recursively by using

382
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET

[1<]

G(j,I) = I5-
j==O,l ,...,C

and [x] == largestinteger ::; x
(16.11)
Let the random variable j = b â€¢ n
be the total number of slots
occupied. Then the distribution ofj is given by
k
II ,
q(j)= I
Il~Â· G-
1(C,k).
(16.12)
{n:nob=t} 1=1 n,.
The key result from a computational viewpoint (proved in [282]) is
that the distribution satisfies
kL a,b,q(j - b,) = jq(j)
,=1
for j =o,...C, where q(x)= 0 for x < 0 and
r:
LqU) = 1.
/ =0
(16.13)
(16.14)
The previous equation defines a one-dimensional recursion (for
arbitrary k), which trivially generates {q(j),j = I,...C}, starting with
q(O) = 1. The above equation is then used to normalizethe elements. Finally,
the desired blocking probabilities are given by
h - I
~, =Iq(C-i)
1=0
(16.15)
for i = I,...k. The carried load(or utilization of the uplinks) is given by
k
carried load =L A(I - Ph,,k.

16.3 CONTIGUOUS SLOT SIMULATION
383
In order to quantify the advantage (if any) of allowing totally flexible
assignments there is need to compute the blocking and carried load achievable
when requests for slots are only allowed if the required slots can be assigned
contiguously within a frame. Deriving a general analytical model for the non-
contiguous case is possible in principle but the explosion in the state space
required to keep track ofthe lengths of available runs of slots (and which calls
occupy which slots) is prohibitive and therefore is not practical. Therefore a
discrete event simulation for the contiguous case is considered.
16.4 PERFORMANCE RESULTS
Example1
A case with heterogeneous requests is considered. In particular, it is
assumed that 30% of requests are for 16Kbps CBR, 50% are for 64Kbps
CBR, and 20% are for 128Kbps CBR. The results are given in figures 16.3
and 16.4. Note that calls requiring more slots see significantly higher blocking
than smaller bandwidth calls. It can be noted that the contiguous requirement
increases blocking for some calls and decreases it for others. In particular, the
calls requiring 128Kbps worth of bandwidth see higher blocking as would be
expected since to be accepted, there always needs to be 8 available slots in a
row. Since less of these large bandwidth calls are carried, there is more
capacity available for the low bandwidth calls which explains their decreased
blocking probability. In this case, the 64Kbps calls see about the same
blocking. Although there is a disparate behavior in blocking for different
streams, the total carried load is less for the contiguous case as is seen in
figure 16.4. Note that allowing totally flexible slot assignment results in an
8% increase in uplink channel utilization at an offered load of 80%.

Example 2
In this example, mixture of two source types is considered. An
assumption is made that 95% of requests are for an average of 16Kbps
bandwidth (I slot) and 5% require an average of 192Kbps (12 slots). The
results shown in figures 16.5 and 16.6 show that, once again, the non-
contiguous case affords a roughly 10% gain in uplink utilization [291]. Figure
16.5 exhibits an interesting behavior, which becomes intuitive with a little
thought. As the load increases from zero the blocking for both types of calls
increases although there is a good chance that one large call is occupying slots

BandwidthAllocation - An Example
385
so that the small calls must contend for the remaining slots. As the load
increases, however, the blocking of the large calls reaches a point where it is
likely that new large bandwidth requests will be blocked and there is a
significant chance that no large calls are in the system. Now the small calls
have a better chance of contending for all 24 slots so the blocking probability
decreases. It continues to decrease as the blocking for large calls increases
until the small calls themselves cause congestion at which point the blocking
probability increases again. This example serves as another case for which the
analytic and simulation models are mutually validated .

16.5 DISCUSSION
BROADBAND SATELLITE INTERNET
To improve system responsiveness and flexibility, many DAMA
schemes have been proposed for satellite communications systems. In this
section, a DAMA model for CBR and VBR services was discussed. Two
possible resource (slot) allocations, contiguous and non-contiguous, are
presented. Analytical and simulation results for blocking probability vs.
offered load show that non-contiguous allocation results in up to a 10%
increase in channel utilization .
