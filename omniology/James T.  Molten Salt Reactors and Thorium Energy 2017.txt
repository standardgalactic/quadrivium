Preface
There is growing awareness that nuclear energy is needed to complement intermit-
tent energy sources and to avoid pollution from fossil fuels. Light-water reactors
are complex, expensive, and vulnerable to core melt, steam explosions, and hydro-
gen explosions, so better technology is needed. Thorium energy and molten salt
reactors could make nuclear energy safer and less expensive, so this book describes
the current state of the art. It has the following sections:
G
Motivation—why are we interested?
G
Technical issues—reactor physics, thermal hydraulics, materials, environment, etc.
G
Generic designs—thermal, fast, solid fuel, liquid fuel, etc.
G
Specific designs—aimed at electrical power, actinide incineration, thorium utilization, etc.
G
Worldwide activities in 23 countries.
G
Conclusions.
This book is a collaboration of many authors from around the world. It can serve
as a reference for engineers and scientists, and it can be used as a textbook for grad-
uate students and advanced undergrads. We hope that leaders of governments and
industry will recognize the great potential benefits and provide appropriate research

1.1
Need for MSR
Most nuclear power plants today use light water reactors (LWRs), which have the
following disadvantages:
G
New fuel must be added every 13 years, due to low fissile breeding by 238U;
G
239Pu in used fuel is a proliferation concern, whether it is reprocessed or disposed of as
waste. (In this book we designate isotopes either as Pu-239 or as 239Pu);
G
Temperature usually limits thermal efficiency to ,35%;
G
High-pressure coolant ! danger of pressure vessel failure;
G
Danger of steam explosion (Chernobyl accident);
G
High core radioactivity ! large source term in accidents;
G
High-level waste disposal problems;
G
High core afterheat during accidents ! danger of fuel melting (Three Mile Island,
Fukkushima);
G
Radiation damage limits to fuel and clad life;
G
Potential hydrogen generation during accidents (Fukushima accident);

G
135Xenon poisoning requires high excess core reactivity and careful power control;
G
Present once-through fuel cycles utilize ,2% of potential uranium energy and produce
large volumes of high-level radioactive waste.
If successful, the molten salt reactor (MSR) could alleviate all of these problems.
Water coolants and gaseous coolants must operate at high pressures, creating high
stresses and failure risk. Liquid metal coolants can operate at low pressures, but can
react chemically with water or air. Molten salt coolants can operate at low pressure
with less chemical reactivity than liquid metals. Their operating temperatures are
limited by compatibility with the structural material.
1.2
MSR origin and research curtailment
Eugene Wigner and Alvin Weinberg proposed a liquid fuel reactor in 1945,
where aqueous water would be circulating with 233U-Th fuel. After Wigner left
ORNL, Weinberg realized this concept as the Homogeneous Reactor Experiment
(HRE) by using light water, and it generated 150 KW electricity in 1953. In
parallel with the HRE development, ORNL investigated a nuclear application to
aircraft jet engines. Since they needed 870C temperature, solid fuel and water
could not be adopted. They soon reached a design concept of liquid fuel reactor
using molten salt instead of water, and they proposed molten fluoride, owing to
the suggestion by Ray Briant. The Aircraft Reactor Experiment operated success-
fully for 100 hours in 1954, until it was shutdown. However, aerial refueling and
ICBMs became available, and a nuclear-powered plane crash would have serious
consequences.
Uranium-235 was thought to be in too short a supply for the anticipated nuclear
build, and fissile fuel breeding was judged necessary. Alvin Weinberg, H.G.
MacPherson, and their colleagues recognized that MSRs could be used to breed U-
233 from thorium, greatly extending the nuclear fuel supply. A Molten Salt Reactor
Experiment (MSRE) using Hastelloy N structure (Table 1.1) with LiF-BeF2
(“FLiBe”) salt and UF4 fuel (U-235) operated successfully at ORNL from
19651969 (MacPherson, 1985; Weinberg, 1994).
It was also operated using U-233 fuel (derived from thorium elsewhere) in 1969.
The MSRE operated 87% of the time during 15 months’ operation, paving the way
for a Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) proposal. In spite of the MSRE success,
two other concepts had more political support in 1972:
G
Admiral Hyman Rickover led the US program to develop LWRs for nuclear submarines.
After the Nautilus nuclear submarine operated successfully in 1955, a commercial nuclear
power plant of similar design was demonstrated at Shippingport, PA, in 1957. Then
LWRs became popular for both civilian nuclear power and military applications.
G
President Nixon, Republicans, and Democrats all supported development of the U238-
Pu239 Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor concept, rather than the Th232-U233 MSBR advo-
cated by ORNL. The Clinch River Breeder Reactor project was begun.
2
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

The Government terminated the MSRE program, in spite of advice from
Weinberg. “It was a triumph of Rickover’s worldview of unrelenting competition
between implacable nuclear-armed enemies over Weinberg’s vision of a peaceful
and prosperous age fueled by beneficial, broadly shared nuclear technology, specifi-
cally using thorium.” (Martin, 2012).
Chapter 11, Liquid fuel, thermal neutron spectrum reactors provides more details
of the ORNL research. Nowadays several organizations are helping to promote
MSRs thorium energy.
1.3
MSR activities
The International Thorium Energy Organization was established “to make Thorium
Energy a reality through a thriving community fostering innovation, cooperation
and competition.” It is a nonprofit, independent international organization, which
holds Thorium Energy Conferences (London 2010; Washington 2012; Shanghai
2012; Geneva 2013; Mumbai 2015) (http://www.itheo.org/).
Ritsuo Yoshioka organized the International Thorium Molten Salt Forum, which
provides information and advice about thorium research (http://msr21.fc2web.com/
english.html).
The Thorium Energy Alliance, organized by John Kutsch in the USA, also promotes
MSR research and holds annual conferences (www.thoriumenergyalliance.com/).
The Generation-IV International Forum started with over 100 reactor concepts and
chose 6 for further detailed study, including a molten salt-cooled reactor. Currently there
are two types, one with molten salt fuel, and the other, with solid fuel (Serp, 2014).
The Alvin Weinberg Foundation in London promotes research, organizes activities,
and provides information about MSR (http://www.the-weinberg-foundation.org/).
Many groups are studying MSR reactor designs and prospects, including Terrestrial
Energy, LFTR Energy, SAMOFAR, Transatomic Power, Copenhagen Atomics,
Seaborg, ThorCon, Moltex Energy, Martingale, Dual Fluid Reactor, and universities.

Introduction

India has large thorium resources, which motivates their MSR research. India
developed both nuclear weapons and civilian nuclear power. The three-stage plan is
(Martin, 2012):
1. Production of Pu-239 in pressurized heavy water reactors;
2. Using the Pu-239 to fuel thorium ! U-233 breeders;
3. Advanced heavy water reactors operating on the thorium/U-233 fuel cycle.
The Bhabha Atomic Research Center in Mumbai hosted the 15th Thorium
Energy Conference in October, 2015.
China has 500 people working on MSR. They are building a 2 MWth MSR solid
fuel reactor cooled with molten salt (2017) and a 2 MWth liquid fuel MSR (2020)
(Chinese Academy of Sciences, 2012).
Current progress in many countries is described in Chapter 25, Worldwide
activities.
1.4
Fissile fuels
The term “fissile” refers to materials that can sustain chain reactions initiated by
low-energy neutrons. The main fissile isotopes are 233U, 235U, and 239Pu. Natural
uranium contains 0.72% U-235 and the rest is U-238, which is nonfissile. Isotopic
separation processes are used to “enrich” the U-235 fraction to 35% for LWR
power plant fuels, and research reactors may use up to 20% enrichment, limited by
the nonproliferation treaty. Pu-239 is produced by neutron absorption in U-238 via
the following reaction chain (Moir and Manheimer, 2014):
n1 238U ! 239U 2
β2
24min 2 . 239Np2 β2
2:4d 2 . 239Pu
238Uðn;γ12β2Þ239Pu


where the symbols (n, γ) mean that a neutron is absorbed and a gamma ray is emitted;
β indicates beta decay (electron emission), and the 24 minutes and 2.4 days are the half-
lives of the two beta decays. The brackets show the condensed notation for this reaction.
Similarly, fertile 232Th can breed fissile 233U by the reactions
n1 232Th!233Th2
β2
24min 2 . 233Pa2 β2
2:4d 2 .233U
232Thðn;γ12β2Þ233U


238U and 232Th are called “fertile,” meaning that they can be transmuted into fissile
fuels by neutron absorption followed by two beta decays. In some cases the 233Pa
may undergo the following reaction before it decays by beta emission:
233Pa 1 fast n ! 232Pa 1 n 1 n ½233Paðn; 2nÞ232Pa
Then the 232P decays to 232U. The decay chain of 232U emits a 2.6 MeV gamma
ray, which makes it difficult to handle. For a breeder reactor the 233Pa may be
removed from the blanket salt to prevent the (n,2n) reaction. On the other hand, for
4
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

nonproliferation reasons it may be desirable to promote the (n,2n) reaction and gen-
eration of 232U to “spike” the uranium fuel, making it less suitable for weapons use.
The simplest reactor could have a core containing both fissile and fertile materi-
als dissolved in a molten salt. Excess neutrons from fission would be used to sustain
the chain reaction and to breed more fissile fuel.
1.5
Thorium fuel advantages
Approaches to a thorium reactor include:
G
Molten thorium salt fuel, such as ThF4 or ThCl4;
G
A driven subcritical molten salt system using fusion or accelerator-generated neutrons;
G
Use of a graphite moderated, He cooled pebble bed reactor;
G
The use of a seed and blanket solid fuel with an LWR cycle.
This book discusses the first two, because they involve molten salt.
The Th232U233 breeder fuel cycle has the following advantages over the
U238Pu239 breeder fuel cycle:
G
Th232 is about four times as abundant as U238 in the earth’s crust (Chapter 9:
Environment, waste, and resources).
G
Almost all the thorium can be converted to fissile U-233, but it is more difficult to convert
U-238 to Pu-239 with high efficiency. (See also Hargraves and Moir 2010).
G
Breeding is possible in thorium with both slow and fast neutrons. The regeneration factor
η is the number of fission neutrons emitted per neutron absorbed in the fuel. Values of
η $ 2.2 are needed for good breeding. In 233U of ηB2.24 (thermal neutrons) and 2.30
(typical fast neutron spectrum) (Fig. 1.1). In 239Pu these values are 2.01 (thermal, unsatis-
factory) and 2.45 (fast), which requires a fast neutron spectrum.
G
The delayed neutron fraction β is 0.0026 in 233U, compared to 0.0020 in 239Pu. The larger
value of 233U makes it easier to control the 233U core.
Figure 1.1 Variation of η with neutron energy for 233U, where η is the number of fission
neutrons emitted per neutron absorbed in fuel.

Introduction

1.6
Liquid fuel MSR
A single-fluid liquid fuel MSR is illustrated in Fig. 1.2.
A two-fluid reactor may have a core with fissile fuel (U-233, U-235, or Pu-239)
sustaining the chain reaction surrounded by a blanket, where neutrons leaking out
of the core would be captured by fertile material (Th-232 or U-238) to breed more
fissile fuel.
Consider an example case with FLiBe salt containing 233UF4 fuel. The reactor
could have a core surrounded by a breeder blanket containing ThF4 in FLiBe, as
illustrated in Fig. 1.3. The core liquid circulates to a heat exchanger. A secondary
coolant flows to an energy conversion system that generates electricity, such as a
Rankine cycle or Brayton cycle.
The ionization states of the fertile breeder salt are controlled using F2 gas. The
intermediate 233Pa could also be removed by the blanket processing system to pre-
vent neutron absorption in 233Pa, which generates nonfissile 232U.
ThF4 is gradually added to the blanket salt to compensate for losses. The fuel
processing system could (optionally) remove fission products to keep the core
radioactivity low and to reduce nonfissile neutron captures. Other fluoride or chlo-
ride salts could be used instead of 7LiF-BeF2.
In a thermal neutron spectrum reactor, graphite blocks could be used to moderate
the core neutrons for better neutron economy (Chapter 11: Liquid fuel, thermal neu-
tron spectrum reactors). Other reactors could operate with fast neutrons and no
graphite (Chapter 12: Fast spectrum liquid fueled reactors). Tritium bred by neutron
absorption in lithium and other elements must be managed carefully to prevent
Figure 1.2 Simplified view of a single-fluid liquid fuel MSR power plant. HX 5 heat
exchangers. The fuel salt (yellow) could be FLiBe containing UF4 and ThF4. The fissile
materials in the fuel salt would sustain the chain reaction, and the extra neutrons emitted
could breed 233U from the 232Th. The fuel processing plant (lavender) could separate U, Pu,
Th, and Pa; adjust fuel salt composition to maintain reactivity; and remove fission products
to reduce core radioactivity. The intermediate loop (red) could be a molten salt without U or
Pu. Pumps, reheaters, and condensers are not shown. The energy conversion system (blue)
could be either Rankine (steam), Brayton (gas), or supercritical fluid.

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

escape to the environment, because tritium is a radioactive gas that can pose a
health hazard if ingested or inhaled at too great a concentration.
Liquid fuels offer many potential advantages over solid fuels (Hargraves, 2012).
1.7
Advantages of liquid fuel MSR
Liquid fuel MSRs would have the following advantages over LWRs.
1.7.1
Safety advantages
G
Can operate at low pressure, avoiding the safety issues of high-pressure reactor vessels
and huge containment domes.
G
No concern about clad leaking fission products. There is no need for cladding.
(Zirconium clad plus water at high temperatures generated hydrogen and explosions at
Fukushima.)
G
No danger of fuel melting. The fuel is already molten. (Solid fuel melting occurred at
Three Mile Island and Fukushima, releasing radioactivity.)
G
Continuous online refueling and reactivity adjustment.
G
Lower core excess reactivity can be maintained. This makes control easier and safer.
G
Continuous removal of fission products (optional) could keep core radioactivity low.
Radioisotopes like Cs-137 could be removed and stored safely, or used for commercial
processes. Low core radioactivity means that less radioactivity could be released during a
severe accident. (The worst contaminant released at Chernobyl and Fukushima was
Cs-137.)
G
Easy removal of noble gases (xenon and krypton) avoids control problems of xenon
poisoning. (Xenon poisoning contributed to the control problem at Chernobyl.)
Figure 1.3 A two-fluid liquid fuel reactor. The fission reactions occur mainly in the central
core (orange) containing 7LiF-BeF2-233UF4 molten salt. Hot fuel salt flows to a heat
exchanger HX, where intermediate coolant salt (red) carries the heat to the energy
conversion system (green), which generates electricity. The blanket region (blue) contains
7LiF-BeF2-ThF4 molten salt, where neutrons leaking from the core breed 233U. It becomes
233UF4, which is extracted from the blanket salt and inserted into the fuel salt at a rate that
helps control core reactivity. An additional heat exchanger (not shown) extracts heat from
the blanket salt.
7
Introduction

G
Core overheating could melt the drain plugs; the liquid core would drain into passively
air-cooled tanks and slowly solidify, trapping radioactivity.
G
Lower core heat emission after shutdown. Emergency core cooling would be easier,
perhaps unnecessary. (Inadequate cooling was a major issue at Three Mile Island and
Fukushima.)
G
No steam explosions from core, since no water is there. (A major problem at Chernobyl.)
G
The self-regulating core can follow demand loads with minimal or no use of control rods.
G
Fluorine salts are stable in high radiation fields, with boiling temperatures B1400C, so
boiling will not occur.
1.7.2
Economic advantages
G
Low pressure and high heat capacity facilitate compact, less expensive reactor cores.
G
Huge containment buildings might not be required.
G
Compact reactors could be mass produced, shipped to the reactor sites, and installed
underground. (This advantage will also be available in some future LWRs.)
G
Core could operate at high temperature (B700C), improving electrical generation effi-
ciency (over 44%, compared with B33% for current LWRs.)
G
High temperature facilitates compact Brayton cycle systems.
G
Air-cooled energy conversion systems could be used in arid or cold regions, because MSR
can provide higher-temperature coolants (Chapter 2: Electricity production).
G
Peak wind energy could be stored as compressed air, which could be heated by a thorium
MSR to drive an open cycle air turbine, increasing the Brayton cycle efficiency without
requiring cooling water. Rankine cycles would not couple as well as high-temperature
compressed air Brayton (Chapter 2: Electricity production).
G
No need for manufacture of fuel pellets, rods, and precise core structure.
G
No need to continually test the core for leaking fuel pins.
G
No need to shut down for refueling.
G
Could be started up using fissile materials from used LWR fuel.
G
After thorium reactors were breeding sufficient U-233, U-235 enrichment plants would
not be required.
G
Fuel lifetime is not limited by radiation damage.
G
Liquid fuel reactors could be produce electricity cheaper than coal (Hargraves, 2012).
G
U-233 bred from thorium can be removed from the molten salt by fluorine gas bubbles,
which convert the salt UF4 to gaseous UF6, which bubbles out of the molten salt. The
purified uranium can be converted back to UF4 by exposure to H2 and returned to the
core. (The HF can be electrolytically separated into H2 and F2, which are recycled.)
Chemical processing of liquid fuel is discussed in Chapter 8, Chemical processing of liq-
uid fuel (See also Langworth 2015.)
1.7.3
Environmental advantages
G
Thorium is four times as abundant as uranium, so thorium utilization would expand the
world supply of nuclear fuel.
G
Recycling of actinides (elements 89103) into liquid fuel would reduce waste production,
compared with once-through LWRs where they are not recycled.
G
Fast spectrum MSRs, or even thermal spectrum MSRs could incinerate actinides from
LWR used fuel, reducing their waste disposal requirements.
8
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

G
Higher efficiency of electrical power generation (due to high coolant temperature) means
less waste heat rejected to the environment.
G
Liquid fuel reactors would generate less than 1% of LWR long-lived high-level radioac-
tive wastes. After 500 years the radioactivity of thorium reactor wastes would be even
lower than the radioactivity of the thorium ore from which the fuel was derived
(Hargraves, 2012).
G
Waste would contain such low concentrations of fissile isotopes that accidental criticality
would not be a concern.
G
Thorium is available from rare-earth mining streams and is less radioactive than uranium.
1.7.4
Nonproliferation advantages
G
Bred Pu-239 could be recycled and burned in the core without leaving the site. The Pu
inventory on site could be kept low.
G
U-232 generated by (n,2n) reactions in Pa mixes with U-233 and, in sufficient quantity,
could make it undesirable for weapons use (called spiked). Bred U-233 could also be
diluted with U-238 to produce low-enriched fuel not suitable for weapons, called dena-
tured fuel.
G
Fissile materials stay at the secure reactor site. It would be very difficult to steal the
securely stored, highly radioactive molten salt without interference from security forces.
G
Could be used to consume Pu-239 from dismantled nuclear weapons without the problems
of MOX fuel manufacture and control in LWRs.
Nonproliferation issues are discussed further in Chapter 10, Non-proliferation
and safeguards aspects of the MSR fuel cycle.
These potential safety, economic, environmental, and nonproliferation advan-
tages have inspired renewed interest in liquid fuel research and development in

many countries. We also need to consider the goals that must be met for successful
deployment of new power plants (Table 1.2).
1.8
MSR development issues
Several issues could limit MSR performance:
G
Fuel flowing out of the reactor continues to emit delayed neutrons in the surrounding
pipes and valves. The neutron emission rate is a reactor dynamics issue (Chapter 5:
Kinetics, dynamics, and neutron noise in stationary MSRs).
G
These neutrons make the plumbing radioactive, so remote maintenance is required.
G
Fission product tellurium caused cracking in MSRE, which could be reduced by control-
ling the UF3/UF4 ratio.
G
Neutron irradiation produces helium accumulation. An increase of ultimate tensile stress
produced by irradiation, called radiation hardening, is accompanied by a reduction of duc-
tility. This could be alleviated by adjustment of the carbon content and by shielding the
vessel wall, such as with a thorium blanket.
G
Corrosion of structure, pipes, valves, and pumps. (Hastelloy N has corrosion resistance up
to about 760C in FLiBe.)

10
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

The MSRE developed control systems, drain tanks, salt heaters, Hastelloy, and
instrumentation. For MSR power plants the following developments are needed:
G
Better corrosion-resistant, high-temperature materials for reactor vessel and piping, and
redox potential control techniques (Chapter 7: Materials, Chapter 8: Chemical processing
of liquid fuel);
G
Pumps and valves;
G
Remote handling equipment, such as hot cells and robotics, are developed, but may need
further modification;
G
Heat exchangers for high-temperature molten salt, such as steam generators and molten
salt to air heaters;
G
Energy conversion systems (Brayton, Rankine, supercritical, or combined cycle) are in
use for present power plants, but need further development to achieve higher efficiency
and reliability at very high temperatures (Chapter 2: Electricity production);
G
Chemical systems to separate uranium, plutonium, thorium, molten salts, fission products,
and tritium, in a highly radioactive environment. This is a major issue requiring extensive,
long-term development (Chapter 8: Chemical processing of liquid fuel);
G
Lithium isotope separation methods. (It is desirable to remove 6Li, in order to minimize
tritium generation.)
1.9
Tritium issues
Natural lithium is 7.42% Li-6 and 92.58% Li-7. Tritium (3H) is produced by neu-
tron absorption via the reactions:
6Li 1 nðthermalÞ ! 4Heð1:05 MeVÞ 1 3Hð2:73 MeVÞ
7Li 1 nðfastÞ ! 3H14He 1 n
The Li-7 reaction is endothermic, requiring a neutron energy .2.47 MeV, so
most of the tritium production occurs in Li-6. Li-6 is a strong neutron absorber,
which affects the reactor neutron economy, requiring extra fissile material in reac-
tors using FLiBe. The reactor would function more efficiently if most of the Li-6
were removed by isotope separation, which is expensive (Chapter 7: Materials).
Tritium is a weak beta emitter (average energy 6 keV). These electrons cannot
penetrate the skin, but tritium can form tritiated water inside the body if tritium is
ingested or inhaled. This radioactive water can damage cells, posing a health haz-
ard if tritium gas escapes into the environment. In the USA the Annual Limit for
Intake (ALI) is 80 mCi (3 GBq) and the Committed Effective Dose Equivalent in
soft tissue is 64 mrem per mCi (1.7 3 10211 Sv/Bq) ingested. Thus, the ALI corre-
sponds to a dose of about 0.05 Sv (Idaho State University, 2015).
The tritium hazard could be alleviated by
G
removing some tritium from FLiBe by bubbling He gas through the FLiBe (sparging);
G
removing some tritium from FLiBe in a vacuum disengager (spray into vacuum);
11
Introduction

G
tritium removal from an intermediate molten salt coolant loop;
G
using tritium impermeable barriers on heat exchanger tubes;
G
removing most of the Li-6 from the lithium (isotope separation);
G
using molten salts that do not contain lithium, such as NaF;
G
after tritium ingestion, drinking fluids that decrease the biological half-life of tritium in
the body from 9.6 days to a few days, or by using dialysis for severe cases.
Although tritium is a concern, much technology has been developed to ensure its
safe handling, especially in Canada, where the CANDU reactors produce large
amounts if tritium.

Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generators, thermoelectric convertors, and therm-
ionic convertors have low efficiencies, so they are not considered here.
2.1
Heat engines
The efficiency of a heat engine, which converts thermal energy into electrical
energy, is always less than the Carnot efficiency
ηc 5 1  Tc=Th
where Th and Tc are the coolant temperatures entering and leaving the engine, in
degrees Kelvin. Sterling cycles are being developed for small-scale applications,
but are not competitive with Rankine and Brayton cycles. Calculation of heat
engine efficiencies is described by El-Wakil (1978).
Carnot cycle efficiency represents the maximum possible efficiency of any heat
engine system between specified temperature limits. The efficiency of power
conversion systems used in the real world is always inferior to the Carnot cycle

efficiency. However, increasing the high-temperature within the cycle or decreasing
in the low-temperature in the cycle generally increases the overall cycle efficiency
or provides an opportunity to do so.
Some desirable features of heat engines are shown in Table 2.1.
As part of the flexibility characteristic a heat engine should also be able to vary
its output to meet changing demand, which in some jurisdictions is affected by solar
power plant output. For example, solar output is high in the midday, so less power
is then needed from other sources to the grid. The “Cal ISO Duck” shown in
Fig. 2.1 is an extreme case of grid demand for peaking power versus time.
Usually natural gas turbines are used to achieve fast peaking power ramp rates.
Molten salt reactors (MSRs) can also be used, because some of the thermal energy

stored in the molten salt can be converted by a heat engine for rapid power
increases. An MSR with thermal storage designed to deliver electricity to the grid
in accordance with the 2020 curve in Fig. 2.1 would be designed to have a load fac-
tor of B50% and a fast ramping rate of B10% per minute. In a theoretical exam-
ple; for an average 1000 MWe, a plant following the 2020 curve would deliver a
minimum of 278 MWe and a maximum of 1859 MWe over a 24-hour cycle.
Table 2.2 lists some heat engines for consideration, to be discussed in the follow-
ing sections.
2.2
Rankine cycles
Steam cycles are well developed, widely used, and available in sizes from 5 kW to
1750 MW. The efficiencies are typically B64% of Carnot, but can be higher in
large, multicomponent systems. Fossil fuelled Rankine cycle power stations without
CO2 capture have efficiencies in the range of 3646% on a lower heating value
(LHV) basis, but the underlying efficiency of the Rankine cycle power island is
higher, typically in the range of 4049%. The lower figure for overall station effi-
ciency is due to thermal losses in the boiler and the additional auxiliary load
required to operate the boiler, including fuel and ash handling, forced draft and
induced draft fans, and flue gas cleanup systems. Commercially available Rankine
cycle turbines at the time of writing can be specified for steam conditions as high
as 300 bar 600C with steam reheat to 620C. Advanced Rankine cycle turbine
designs contemplate steam conditions as high at 350 bar 700C with steam reheat
to 720C, but are not commercially available today.
Modern Rankine cycle turbines are very reliable and durable if operated and
maintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations. A service life
of 300,000 hours (38 years at 90% service factor) or more is achievable for modern
turbines. They are available from multiple vendors, so a competitive procurement
process works well. The turbine island comprises the steam turbine, the generator,
the condenser, the moisture separator, reheaters, and auxiliary equipment needed to
convert steam produced at the nuclear reactor into electrical energy. The Flamanville
EPR turbine island was contracted at about 200 Euro per kW (Alstom Company,
2006). Steam turbines perform best with a low-temperature heat sink.

Electricity production

The cooling requirements for Rankine cycles can consume a lot of cooling water,
and many countries are restricting the use of once-through cooling, the least costly
and most efficient cooling arrangement. The molten salt temperature would be
limited to about 700C, and 8 stages of feedwater heating would be needed to
achieve highest efficiency. The biggest challenge would be development of a
reliable steam generator that is resistant to freezing of the molten salt and that can
recover from a salt freeze.
2.3
Helium Brayton cycles
Helium Brayton closed loop cycles can use high-temperature primary coolants and
can achieve up to 54% efficiency at 900C with triple pressure-recuperation and
intercooling. (Assuming TcB100C the Carnot efficiency would be 68%.) The tur-
bines have more stages (blade rows) than normal gas turbines. They are not widely
used, and the largest commercial plant is 50 MWe at Oberhausen II. They may
have multiple expansion steps, as illustrated in Fig. 2.2.
Fig. 2.3 shows the thermodynamic cycle of a multistage Brayton cycle system.
This particular system was designed for a fusion reactor blanket, but it could
also be used with a MSR heat source. The hot, high-pressure helium at p 5 18 MPa
and temperature T1B650C (point 1) spins the turbine and draft shaft, which turns
the three compressors and the electrical power generator (not shown). After expan-
sion through the turbine, part of the heat remaining in the gas is removed in the
recuperator (points 2 to 3 on the T-S diagram) to preheat the gas entering the inter-
mediate heat exchanger (IHX). The gas is further cooled in the heat rejection heat
exchanger (HX) (points 3 to 4). This is the minimum temperature and pressure
point of the cycle. It is compressed in three stages, with cooling between each stage
to facilitate further compression (points 4 to 9). The preheating of the gas by the
Figure 2.2 Schematic flow diagram for a three-expansion-stage cycle, using high-pressure
(HP), medium-pressure (MP), and low-pressure (LP) stages. Each stage has a generator (G),
turbine (T), compressor (C), and heater and cooler heat exchangers, with a recuperator (R)
located in a fourth vessel (Zhao and Peterson, 2004).

recuperator (points 9 to 10) greatly boosts the starting temperature of the coolant
going through the IHX, where the molten salt heats it up to T1. If T1 5 650C,
pressure 5 18 MPa, and the recuperator efficiency
ηx 5 ðT10  T9Þ=ðT2  T9Þ
were B96%, then the conversion efficiency of thermal energy into electricity could
be B46%, which is comparable to that of a corresponding Rankine cycle. (Malang,
1998) (If TcB100C, then the Carnot efficiency would be 60%).
Helium Brayton cycles are reasonably compact and efficient. They can be used
with dry cooling and for desalination where water is scarce. High heat rejection
temperatures Tc would reduce cooling tower costs, and the absence of a steam cycle
would remove a major pathway of tritium leakage.
There is not much industrial experience with high-power helium turbines.
Helium Brayton cycles need high-pressure (B10 MPa), which makes it diffi-
cult to prevent leaks. The turbine operates at high speed, often .60 Hz.
Impurities in helium attack some metals at high temperatures, so the helium
must be kept pure.
In a combined cycle system the heat rejected by the Brayton cycle could drive a
Rankine cycle. The efficiency would be improved, but the additional complexity
might not be cost-effective.
Deficiencies of energy conversion systems using He, He 1 N, and CO2 gases are
discussed by Oh (2006).

2.4
Supercritical CO2 Brayton cycles
At pressures above the triple point a fluid is a “supercritical” fluid, no longer a liq-
uid or gas. A simple supercritical cycle at 550C could achieve a net efficiency
B37%, so additional features are desirable to improve the efficiency. After consid-
ering several options (precompression, recompresion, partial cooling, recuperation)
a recompression system with recuperation was found to be best (Dostal, 2004).
Such a system is illustrated in Fig. 2.4.
Fig. 2.5 shows the thermodynamic cycle. Supercritical CO2 drives the turbine
(points 5 to 6) which drives the electrical power generator and the compressor shaft.
The fluid is compressed (1 to 2) and (8 to 3) up to 1220 MPa. The precooler and

recuperators improve the thermodynamic efficiency of the cycle. Then the highly
compressed fluid is heated by the molten salt heat source (4 to 5) and recycled
to the turbine. The cycle requires a good recuperator and a low-temperature heat
sink (B10C).
Fig. 2.6 shows the calculated efficiencies for supercritical CO2 systems as func-
tions of temperature and pressure.
The supercritical CO2 cycle can operate at lower temperature than the Brayton
cycle (550C vs 850C), but higher pressure (20 MPa vs 8 MPa), while achieving
comparable efficiency of 45%. Higher temperatures could raise the efficiency above
50%. The turbomachinery is high speed and very compact. A 246-MWe turbine
would be only 1.2 m diameter and 0.55 m long, compared with about 5 m long for
a helium Brayton turbine and much larger for steam turbines.
The compact size makes turbine material strength and blade tip clearances
significant issues. The high turbine speed requires high-speed reduction gear-
boxes or large-scale sophisticated frequency conversion. The high-pressure
requires HXmaterials with good strength, and the turbine inlet temperatures will
be limited by materials issues. The supercritical CO2 cycle is potentially promis-
ing, but is still in a developmental stage. Sandia National Laboratory has suc-
cessfully operated a supercritical CO2 turbine/compressor loop with equipment
rated around 100 kW. Supercritical cycles with other fluids, such as ammonia,
are also possible.
In a comparison with the helium Brayton cycle, the supercritical steam cycle,
and superheated steam cycle, “the supercritical CO2 cycle dominates in the range
of medium temperatures (500700C) over all three other considered cycles. Its
high efficiency, simplicity, compactness and low capital cost is very attractive.”

Metal vapor combined cycles
2.5.1
Mercury/water binary cycle
A high-temperature mercury vapor would drive a turbine, and the exhaust mercury
vapor would condense on a steam generator. The steam cycle would be driven by
the waste heat of the mercury vapor cycle to achieve higher efficiency. The Schiller
mercury-vapor/steam plant at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, produced about 40 MW
(15 from mercury and 25 from steam) in the 1950s. Mercury is highly toxic, so its
large-scale use is no longer acceptable.
2.5.2
Potassium/steam binary cycle
Chambers, Fraas, and Ozisik did a preliminary design study of a potassium/steam
binary cycle coupled to a MSR with fuel outlet temperature 982C (1100F).
The fuel salt flows through an IHX, heating an inert salt to 926C. A temperature
drop of 56C is assumed in both salt circuits. The intermediate salt loop heats a
potassium boiler, sending potassium vapor to a turbine at 838C (1540F). The vapor
condenses on a steam generator at 593C, generating steam at 566C (1050F) and
28 MPa, with reheats to 566C (parameters of the Philadelphia Electric Company
Eddystone Plant). Fig. 2.7 illustrates the T-s diagram for the high-temperature binary
cycle. The combined system could achieve an efficiency of 54% (Chambers, 1964).
The required potassium vapor turbines and heat exchangers, which must with-
stand corrosion from hot metal vapor and molten salts, have not yet been developed
and tested. Potassium is not toxic, but it is highly reactive with air and water.
Cesium and rubidium would also be suitable for vapor turbines, but they are rare
and expensive. Estimates of the required materials and components for the binary
cycle indicated that it could be cost-competitive (Chambers, 1964).
2.6
Nuclear air Brayton power cycles
In the 1950s the United States initiated the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion program to
couple a nuclear reactor to a jet engine to create a nuclear-powered bomber with
unlimited range. The program resulted in the initial development of the MSR at
Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The salt coolants were designed to deliver high-
temperature nuclear heat to jet engines. The program was canceled with the devel-
opment of intercontinental ballistic missiles. The MSR development continued for
another decade to create a nuclear power plant coupled to a steam power cycle
because at that time gas turbine technology was not sufficiently developed to be a
practical power system for utility applications.
In the last 50 years there have been extraordinary developments in utility gas tur-
bines burning natural gas. F Class gas turbines were introduced in the 1990’s, that
technology had advanced sufficiently to enable coupling a salt-cooled reactor to a
nuclear air-Brayton combined cycle (NACC) power conversion system. Because of
20
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

advances in gas turbine technology, this power cycle enables nuclear base-load elec-
tricity with additional peak electricity produced by using auxiliary natural gas or
stored heat with incremental heat-to-electricity efficiencies of 6670%. This capabil-
ity enables a salt-cooled reactor with NACC to be the enabling technology for a low-
carbon nuclear-renewable grid and increases revenue in deregulated electricity mar-
kets by 50100% after subtracting the cost of natural gas relative to a base-load
nuclear plant.
In a modern utility combined-cycle gas turbine the exit temperature of the com-
pressed air from the front-end compressor is between 400 and 500C; thus, the reac-
tor coupled to NACC must deliver heat in the 600700C range. Salt coolants are
the only coolants designed to deliver heat in this temperature range.

Electricity production

2.6.1
Nuclear Air-Brayton combined cycle
Advances in gas turbine technology now enable coupling a high-temperature reactor
to a NACC (Andreades, June 2014, July 2014, 2015; Zohuri, 2015). Such a power
system can operate in two modes: base-load and peak electricity (Fig. 2.8). Nuclear
heat is used for base-load electricity production. Additional heat for peak electricity
production can be provided by natural gas (near-term), stored heat, or ultimately
hydrogen. During base-load operation of an NACC, atmospheric air is filtered, the
air is compressed, heat is added from the reactor through a coiled-tube heat
exchanger, the hot compressed air goes through turbine to produce electricity, the
air is reheated and goes through a second turbine to produce electricity, the warm
air exiting the gas turbine goes through a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) to
generate steam that is used to produce added electricity, and the air is exhausted to
the stack. This power cycle is similar to that used in natural gas combined-cycle
plants. If coupled to a salt-cooled reactor delivering heat between 600 and 700C,
heat-to-electricity efficiency is 42%.
The base-load NACC temperatures, determined by heat-exchanger material con-
straints, are far below allowable peak gas turbine temperatures. Thus, there is the
option of adding heat after the nuclear heating to further raise compressed gas tem-
peratures before entering a power turbine—a topping cycle. The incremental heat-
to-electricity efficiency depends upon the design, ranging from 6670%. This is
the most efficient system known to convert incremental heat to electricity based on
existing technology.
A commercial fluoride-salt-cooled high-temperature reactor (FHR) point design
(Andreades, September 2014, Summer 2015) with NACC has been developed
with a base-load output of 100 MWe to match the capabilities of the GE 7FB gas
turbine—the largest rail-transportable gas turbine made by General Electric. The
FHR uses solid fuel with clean salt coolant and delivers heat to the power cycle
between 600 and 700C. The power cycle can be coupled to an MSR delivering
heat over the same temperature range. Utility combined-cycle gas turbines are
growing rapidly in size and the new H-Class gas turbines have more than twice the
output of the F-Class gas turbines and much larger gas turbines are expected to be
available by the time any salt-cooled reactor is commercialized. The option exists
to couple multiple turbines to a single reactor.
Figure 2.8 Nuclear Air-Brayton combined cycle (NACC).
22
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

Fig. 2.9 shows in more detail FHR NACC point design with auxiliary heat
provided by natural gas, hydrogen, or a Firebrick Resistance Heated Energy
Storage (FIRES) system. In the power cycle, external air is filtered, compressed,
heated by hot salt from the FHR while going through a coiled tube air heater
(CTAH) to 670C, sent through a turbine producing electricity, reheated in a second
CTAH to the same gas temperature, and sent through a second turbine producing
added electricity. Warm low-pressure air flow from the gas turbine system exhaust
drives a HRSG, which provides steam to either an industrial steam distribution sys-
tem for process heat sales or a Rankine cycle for additional electricity production.
The air from the HRSG is exhausted up the stack to the atmosphere.
Added electricity (Fig. 2.10) can be produced by injecting fuel (natural gas,
hydrogen, etc.) or adding stored heat after nuclear heating by the second CTAH.
This boosts temperature to 1065C in the compressed gas stream going to the sec-
ond turbine that is exhausted to the HRSG. The specific design was optimized for
Figure 2.9 Nuclear Air-Brayton combined cycle (NACC) with FIRES.
Figure 2.10 Heat and electricity balance for NACC and FIRES.

Electricity production

base-load electricity production. The incremental natural gas, hydrogen, or stored
heat-to-electricity efficiency is 66.4%—far above the best standalone natural gas
plants because the added heat is a topping cycle. For comparison, the same GE 7FB
combined cycle plant running on natural gas has a rated efficiency of 56.9%.
Higher peaking efficiencies can be achieved by optimizing the design for peak elec-
tricity production and/or increasing peak turbine temperatures using active cooling
blades with peak turbine temperatures above 1300C.
The reason for these high incremental natural gas or stored heat-to-electricity
efficiencies is that this high-temperature heat is added on top of “low-temperature”
670C nuclear heat. For a modular 100 MWe FHR coupled to a GE 7FB modified
gas turbine that added natural gas or stored heat produces an additional 142 MWe
of peak electricity. The concept of a topping cycle for efficient conversion of fossil
fuels to electricity is not new. The Indian Point I nuclear power plant built in the
1970s was a pressurized water reactor where the steam was sent to an oil-fired
superheater to increase peak temperatures. It was at the time the most efficient oil
to electricity plant in the world but was shut down after the oil embargo that made
burning oil uneconomic.
The adoption of NACC as a power cycle has other major implications. The
water-cooling requirements for combined cycle plants are B40% of a light-water
reactor because much of the heat rejection is by warm air versus cooling towers
from other power cycles.
2.6.2
Heat storage
The heat storage system consists of high-temperature firebrick heated to high tem-
peratures with electricity at times of low or negative electric prices (Stack,
2016,2017). The hot firebrick is an alternative to heating with natural gas. The fire-
brick, insulation systems, and most other storage system components are similar to
high-temperature industrial recuperators. The round-trip storage efficiency from
electricity to heat to electricity is B66% based on B100% efficiency in resistance
electric conversion of electricity to heat and 66% efficiency in conversion of heat
to electricity. That efficiency could be above 70% by 2030 with improving gas
turbines.
Much of the technology to integrate FIRES into a gas turbine is being developed
by Project Adele, a joint project of General Electric and RWE (a German utility).
The goal is to develop an adiabatic compressed air storage system for deployment
in Germany that is a lower cost alternative to battery and pumped storage of elec-
tricity. When electricity prices are low, air is (1) compressed 70 bar with the adia-
batic compression raising the compressed air temperature to 600C, (2) cooled to
40C by flowing through a brick recuperator, and (3) stored as compressed air in
salt domes deep underground. The compressed air must be cooled to avoid over-
heating the salt and causing structural failures of the underground works. When
electricity prices are high, the compressed air flows back through the firebrick, is
reheated and enters a turbine where it produces electricity before being exhausted
to the atmosphere. The first demonstration project is to be completed in several
24
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

years. As a result of this project, a firebrick recuperator is being incorporated into a
modern large gas turbine. There are differences. For NACC with FIRES the gas
temperatures are higher, the peak pressures are lower, and the firebrick is heated
electrically. However, much of the technology is being developed, including how to
integrate a gas turbine with a firebrick recuperator.
2.6.3
Economics
An economic analysis (Forsberg, 2014, 2016) was done of the performance of an
FHR with NACC in California and Texas using natural gas to produce peak elec-
tricity. These states have deregulated electricity markets. The peaking capability
increased the plant yearly revenue by about 50% after subtracting the cost of the
natural gas compared to a base-load nuclear plant. Because NACC is more efficient
than a standalone natural-gas combined cycle plant in converting natural gas to
electricity (uses less natural gas), its electricity production costs for peak electricity
are less than a standalone natural gas plant; thus, it earns large profits when elec-
tricity prices are set by natural gas plants.
Concerns about climate change from emissions of greenhouse gases have
resulted in various policies to replace fossil fuel generation of electricity with
nuclear and renewables. If the goal is a low-carbon electrical grid, the economics of
salt-cooled reactors with NACC substantially improve and salt-cooled reactors with
NACC may become the enabling technology for large-scale use of renewables.
Renewables are nondispatchable. The addition of wind and solar results in sig-
nificant hours per year with very low electricity prices—near zero at times of high
wind or solar input (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2015; Forsberg, 2015;
Mills and Wiser, 2012). Fig. 2.11 shows an electricity price curve for fossil
generation sources (existing; blue bars) and zero-carbon electricity grids in a
deregulated market, where the horizontal axis has the wholesale price of electricity

be bought at a particular price. This specific example (blue bars) uses wholesale
electricity price data from the Texas market in 2012. The price curve for an elec-
trical grid primarily based on generating electricity from fossil fuels is approxi-
mately a bell-shaped curve. At times of low demand the power plants with the
lowest operating costs are producing electricity and thus the market price of elec-
tricity is low. At times of high electricity demand, old inefficient units or units
that burn more expensive fossil fuels are brought on line at high cost and set the
wholesale price of electricity—resulting in high electricity prices at those times.
There is an apparent minimum price of electricity. This is set by the cost of fossil
fuels used to produce electricity. Sales of electricity below this price occur at
times of very low demand when hydroelectric, nuclear, or wind plants set the price
of electricity.
The red curve is a notational curve that shows what happens if one adds large
quantities of renewables or nuclear and removes electricity generation by fossil fuel
sources with no other changes. For example, if significant solar is added, the price of
electricity will drop to zero in the middle of the day when there is high solar input
and some solar output is curtailed due to the lack of markets. The incremental cost of
solar production is near zero and solar producers will bid down hourly electricity
prices to continue sales. The same happens for large wind input on windy days. To
use an analogy, it’s like selling tomatoes in August when everyone’s tomatoes turn
red at the same time—there is a glut on the market that results in price collapse.
Electricity price collapse limits the large-scale use of these resources—even if there
are large decreases in the costs of these technologies because all such plants provide
output to the grid at the same time, independent of electricity demand.
When the wind stops or the sun does not shine, other power generators must be
used to provide electricity. If these plants are used only half the time when the sun
is down or the wind is not blowing, replacement plants will not be built unless the
price of electricity doubles when they sell electricity to the grid to cover their costs.
The long-term electricity price curve becomes bimodal—a fundamentally different
price curve for electricity. This price collapse without storage technologies becomes
economically significant when solar contributes B10% of all electricity produced
in a solarfossil system, wind contributes B20% of all electricity produced in a
windfossil system, or nuclear contributes B70% in a nuclearfossil system.
Revenue collapse discourages further investment in capacity of the very-low-carbon
generating technologies in a free market. Subsidies can increase solar, wind, and
nuclear capacities, but added capacity decreases revenue from the sale of electricity
so subsidies have to increase as low-carbon technologies are added. Regulators can
modify market rules so price collapse does not appear—but that does not change
the costs to society—it just hides them as subsidies that increase the total cost of
energy to society.
Constraints on the use of fossil fuels will dramatically improve the economics of
NACC and create large incentives to add FIRES for heat storage to buy electricity
when prices are low and produce added electricity when prices are high. In such an
environment NACC becomes an enabling technology for renewables by providing

(1) a large market for electricity at times of low prices to charge FIRES and
(2) peak power when required.

Observations
The concept of coupling a nuclear reactor to a jet engine (Brayton cycle) is from
the 1950s; however, only in the last 15 years have the improvements in natural gas
combined-cycle power plants made this a credible option. The advances in gas tur-
bines are rapidly improving this power cycle option with time. If there are serious
constraints on the burning of fossil fuels and significant use of renewables, the tra-
ditional base-load market for electricity will shrink with a corresponding growth in
the demand for variable dispatchable electricity. Salt-cooled reactors with NACC
can meet that market requirement.

Introduction
This book and this chapter focus on the many aspects of (mostly fluoride) molten-salt
reactors (MSRs). This particular chapter serves as a general overview of the physico-
chemical properties of molten salts and describes some of the high-value applications
that their unique properties enable. Topics discussed include the issues of contain-
ment materials, fluid mechanics, advanced Lewis-salt “pH” considerations, and the
chemical properties of the salts themselves. Binary and ternary molten salts of many
chemical classes (nitrates, chlorides, fluorides, etc.) have been studied for decades
due to their unique, thermoelectrolytic and thermodynamic properties including
density, viscosity, heat capacity, and thermal conductivity (Bloom et al., 1965), and
each could form the subject matter of a chapter all on their own. These properties
directly bear on applications of MSRs, including the production of electricity and the
many high-temperature chemosynthetic applications that MSRs can facilitate.
An ideal working fluid should possess the following properties, as summarized
by Saltarella et al. (2004):
G
High boiling point;
G
Low vapor pressure;
G
High specific heat;
G
High thermal conductivity;
G
High density at low pressures.
In the first section that follows, the physical and chemical properties of molten
salts will be introduced along with the theories that can be used to model or describe
their behavior. In the subsequent sections various high-value applications for molten
salts will be described across a broad range of industries, from the refining of
hydrocarbons through to nuclear water processing and desalination.
3.2
Fundamental physicochemical properties
of molten salts
3.2.1
Molten salts as working fluids in thermochemical processes
Despite myriad advances in both inorganic and organic chemical catalysis, many
chemical processes still require high temperatures to drive endothermic1 reactions,
such as ammonia production, as described later in this chapter.
1 Endothermic: A part of a chemical reaction pathway that requires energy input to proceed. Conversely,
an exotherm or an exothermic reaction is one that yields energy.
30
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

The high operating temperatures of MSR designs are in the 650C800C range.
Modern designs proffered by several start-up companies around the world exploit
the high energy density of the salt to achieve MSR modularity, with the capacity
for mobility and remote operation, focused mainly on electrical production.
A molten-salt fuel may contain isotopes of Th, U, Pa, Np, Pu, and the resultant
fission products, which emit radioactive decay heat. Modern materials selection and
corrosion retardation are required for molten-salt loops (Srinagar et al., 2008).
Here, we will describe the properties of fluoride molten salts, their use in primary
and secondary loops, and their potential applications for cost-effective, high-
temperature chemical processes. (Chloride salts are also considered in some
designs.)
Some clarification may be helpful to the reader at this point. Salts that character-
istically melt at high temperatures are classically considered “molten salts.” These
systems have ionic bonds, often point charges, where much energy is needed to
break those ionic bonds, hence the high melting points. Ionic liquids are a different
type of salt that are liquids at room temperature (Marsh et al., 2004). Like molten
salts, they have formal charges (11, 1, etc.), but the charges are distributed
among a group of other atoms that make up some substituent (a ring, a whole mole-
cule, or what have you). Deep eutectics are a third class of compounds, where for-
mal charges are assigned to two (or more) species, yet the interaction between them
yields a system with an extremely lower melting point than the two compounds.
3.2.2
Chemistry, bonding, and electronic structure
of molten salts
Molten salts have a unique electron landscape. In the solid state, most crystalline
materials are held together ionically, with only some covalent bonding, depending
on the system. Covalent character does exist in the solid state; however, two
counter-examples are diamond (completely covalent) and silicon carbide (SiC),
whose ionic character is only approximately 13% (Boyd et al., 2013). Their ionic
(Coulombic) intermolecular bonding properties in the molten state interplay with
the covalent bonding that emerges as a result of the phase change (from solid to
liquid) in complex ways. This covalent/ionic ratio changes as one goes down and to
the right in the periodic table; moving to the right increases the valence electrons’
effective nuclear charge or Zeff
2, which decreases the ionic radius. The shift in
electron density is due to distribution higher orbital involvement (4d, 5s, etc., as a
function of higher atomic number), similar energies and symmetries, and decreasing
cationic radius. These properties often permit more covalence (Nb, W, Ta, etc.),
multiple oxidation states, and similar structure in the solid state and sometimes,

nucleus, denoted Zeff. Because core electrons shield valence electrons from the full positive charge of
the nucleus, Zeff5Z 2 S, where Z is the number of protons in the nucleus, and S is the number of
shielding electrons between the nucleus and the outermost electrons.

similar chemical behavior in either state, e.g., TaBr5, NbBr5, again depending on
molecular symmetry.
Thus, a combination of ionic and covalent interactions occurs in the molten-salt
bath. These interactions shift, depending on Lewis pH3 and temperature. Coupled
with molecularorbital hybridization, covalently and loosely, ionically bound oli-
gomers can and do occur in the molten state, depending on the species. This has
been studied extensively computationally, and with good predictive results in
several systems, but in pure form, namely, systems without all species contained
within a working MSR model (Thoma, 1962; Thoma et al., 1963, 1968; Cantor,
1973; Madden et al., 2016). Lanthanide contraction4 also substantively assists in
ionic network calculations because of its predictability and stability under a wide
range of molten-salt systems (Thoma, 1962). Scientists working on MSRs quickly
discovered the role that eutectics, their deviations, and changes in Lewis pH played
on thermal conductivity and melting points.
These larger species (salts with higher molecular weight metal centers,namely,
in the lower row of the periodic table) form ionic networks in molten-salt systems
(Salanne et al., 2008; Madden et al., 2016). Complications arise due to the fluctuat-
ing degree of both covalency and ionicity in the bath, however; shifting Lewis pH
resulting from increasing fission-product production, necessary addition of fluorine,
offgassing, and multispecies oligo/polymerization5 all contribute to the complexity
of the primary and secondary loops. The original MSRE experiments were managed
by daily maintenance of the optimal, noninteger U41/U31 ratio, an extensive property
of the system. This control is more difficult in MSRs larger than the original MSRE,
such as those being proposed by several companies in this book (Discussions with
Richard Engel, 2013).
3.2.3
Phase transformations in molten salts
Fig. 3.1 demonstrates the substantial eutectic and peritectic changes observed with
even small changes in mol% concentrations and small temperature windows
(Cantor, 1973; Madden et al., 2016). It does not, however, reflect the changes in
3 Lewis acidsbases: A classification system where the Lewis acid is a recipient of electron pairs and the
Lewis base is an electron pair donor. This system is more pragmatic in inorganic systems than the
Brønsted system, since Brønsted acids and bases deal solely with hydrogen and hydroxyl (OH)
exchanges.
4 Lanthanide contraction: The filling of electron orbitals distinguishes the lanthanides and actinides from
other blocks of elements. An atom’s radius is determined by its outermost electrons, i.e., those with the
highest principal quantum number. The radii of lanthanides and actinides are determined by their 6s
and 7s electrons, respectively. Because f electrons do not effectively shield outer electrons from the
nuclear charge, an increasing atomic number substantially increases outer electrons’ attraction to the
nucleus, whose increasing positive charge is only minimally shielded by the addition of an intermediate
4f or 5f electron. The result is an increasing Zeff and a contracting atomic radius when moving left-to-
right across an f-block period.

a result of ionocovalent bonding where (typically) halogens serve as the shared bridge between ionic

density and viscosity that occur (Cantor, 1973). While intrasystem changes in
density largely correlate negative-linearly in molten-salt fluoride mixtures as could
be predicted, intersystem comparisons are not feasible, unless the eutectic salt com-
positions are the same and merely the mole percentages have changed. For exam-
ple, addition of UF4 in LiF-BeF2-ZrF4 mixtures studied by Cantor decreased the
density, in comparison to the ternary LiF-BeF2-ZrF4 system (Cantor, 1973). The
slight change shifted proportionally in mole percentage of the ternary group to
accommodate the slight addition of UF4. This negative-linear trend for density
spans almost all salt mixtures, regardless of the anion as a function of temperature.
Some substantive progress has been made regarding computationally derived
density calculations (Herrmann et al., 2004; Quoining et al., 2011). Computed
predictions of density, viscosity, and eutectic/peritectic points as a function of
temperature and/or composition for different MSR and heat-exchanger component
ratios are challenging, and computer modeling does not shed light on the dynamics
that occur during MSR operation (to be discussed later). These critical parameters
govern many aspects of heat-exchanger and core material construction. Geometry,
effective thermal conductivity, and stresses should be incorporated into the heat
exchanger design because of these changes to the candidate salt.
Poorly understood changes in viscosity, thermal capacity, and density are three
disadvantages of the liquidus phase change. Fig. 3.1 is a clear example of the
complexities associated with ternary eutectics due to Thoma’s, as well as, Janz’
early work in the late 1960s (Thoma et al., 1963, 1968; Janz et al., 1974). The fol-
lowing subsections explain some fundamental tools of crystal and molten-salt
investigations.
Fluoride systems are the most extensively studied (Janz et al., 1974; Bale et al.,
2002; Khosrow et al., 2009). Comparisons between different halogen salts that might
emerge because of space-group symmetries or Lewis acidsbase similarities are not

diagram (Left) are well-represented in the ternary phase detail (Right) (Thoma, 1962;
Thoma et al., 1963, 1968).

available. The ORNL-MSR programs yielded a plethora of useful information, but no
other systems were as extensively studied. NaCl-KCl (NaKCl2), a strong candidate
for fast reactors, is a good example of this incomparability. Fig. 3.1 exemplifies both
the complexity and the extensive research conducted on binary, ternary, and n-ary
fluoride salts throughout the decades of solid-state investigations. Janz et al., how-
ever, have amassed a substantive collection of empirical molten-salt data, predomi-
nantly on fluoride salts. Their work covers many salts, but of interest here are the
fluorides and their thermodynamic properties (Janz et al., 1974).
Advances in solar thermal molten-salt systems have been aggressively explored,
typically using the KNO3/NaNO3 pair as the working fluid (Born and Goeppert-
Mayer, 1933; Edwards, 1970; Williams, 2006). The Rankine cycle is often
employed, to varying degrees of success, depending mainly on the working fluid
and the design architecture (Williams, 2006).
3.2.4
Crystallographic relations between the solid phase
and persistent short-range order in molten salts
To understand the properties and behavior of a molten salt, one needs to first under-
stand the solid state and then the solid/liquid transition. For MSRs these perspec-
tives are important to understand eutectic and peritectic points. The rigidity and
(quasi)periodicity of the crystal lattice is reduced in the ionocovalent, fluid molten
phase during the transition, but quasilattice order is not lost.
The solid-state properties are partially reflected in the molten state. Sometimes,
the crystallographic space groups6 are of very low symmetry; molten states are of
inherently low symmetry. The LnF3 series are nine-coordinate in the solid state, for
example. They reflect this in a six-ligand species in the molten state, with a formal
charge of 3 (LnF32
6 ), implying a nine-coordinate system.
The lanthanide (Ln), lower transition, chalcogen7 and actinide fluorides exemplify
these complex symmetries. The solid state for many heterogeneous crystallographic
systems adopts dimers, trimers, tetramers, and other examples of longer-range order,
despite monomers occupying a single, crystallographic space group (Edwards, 1970).
These n-mers can be seen in the ionocovalent networks of Madden’s computer simula-
tions (Madden, 2016). This is particularly true of the metalloid, lower-transition, lan-
thanide and actinide fluoride and halogen salts in the molten state (Edwards, 1969;
6 Space group: A classification method for different atomic or molecular arrangements in crystals. The
tallying of the atoms that represent the stoichiometry of the compound (e.g., Al2O3, BaTiO3, NaCl), at
various points in the most compact form possible. A finite number of motifs exist for the arrangement
of atoms or molecules within the unit cell, such that dissimilar compounds can nevertheless be com-
pared (see Fig. 3.6): different atoms or molecules in two different compounds can occupy the same spa-
tial positions. High and low symmetry refer to the ease with which one atomic position can be
translated to another. These are mathematical operations and are inversely related: the higher the
number of operators, the lower the symmetry and, hence, the more complicated the unit cell.

of their unique valence electron orbitals.
34
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

Edwards and Jones, 1977; Feigl, 1948; Wells, 1948). Well-known examples are the
solid solutions of quartz, olivine, feldspar, and other silicates found in nature. One
can also observe these phenomena in the quasihomogeneous mineralogic coexis-
tence of tantalite and columbite in geologic deposits, which also contain lanthanides
and actinides. The relative similarity in ionic radius and coordination number
permits a seamless, often nonstoichiometric cationic substitution from one crystal-
line compound to the next, the hallmark of a solid solution (Graham and Thornber,
1974). The work done by Graham and Thornber (1974) demonstrates this well.
For a good survey of foundational crystallographic principles, mathematics,
and conventions that will help explain these phenomena, the reader can refer to
West (1984).
Heat exchanger loop salts are based on simple salts, but with complex heat
differentials, which present challenges to understanding liquid salt in the bulk and on
intermolecular levels. The complexity of the ionic systems carries over to the molten
state; covalence plays a substantial role and this is particularly true of core salts.
Crystallography plays a central role in understanding how the molecules interact
in both their covalent and ionic states, and it serves as a vital tool to deduce the
space group of the resultant eutectic(s) of any system. Central to the stabilization of
any solid material is the concept of the crystal lattice energy. Crystal lattice energy
or more commonly lattice energy, often abbreviated to Upot, is defined as the
amount of energy required to separate the ions of a crystal to an infinite distance.
The more modern convention is preferred: the energy required to form the bonds.
The lattice energy is always negative, as is the usual convention for enthalpy, and
represented using SI units (kJ  mol21). Since lattice energy cannot be derived
empirically, extensive work has been done to develop different methods to calculate
it, dating back to 1884 (Appell, 1884). Lattice energies are related to the Madelung
constant (described below) due to the energy required to break those bonds. Lattice
energies are a subset of the larger space of so-called lattice sums, which have many
applications in charge-related fields of physics and chemistry where (quasi)periodic
systems are investigated. Lattice sums are mathematical methods for calculation of
lattice energies, and are beyond the scope of this chapter. Several authors have
charted the development of the calculation of lattice sums (Borwein et al., 1985;
Glasser and Zucker, 1980). Some standard calculations are shown in Fig. 3.2.
The Madelung constant (M, dimensionless) is a measure of the electrostatic
potential of the ions within a crystallographic unit cell (Madelung, 1919;
Osychenko et al., 2012; Hardin et al., 2014). It is usually a geometrically derived,
dimensionless scalar. Often, however, the value must incorporate other potentials
further away, whose electron densities are not spherically distributed (Streever and
Caplan, 1973; Burns, 1993). The lattice energy is the amount of energy required to
break the bonds between two atoms. Some simple M values are tabulated in
Fig. 3.2. The calculation of M typically considers the Coulombic interactions
between anions and cations as spherical, point charges within the crystal lattice. For
highly symmetric crystals (e.g., cuboidal: rocksalt, rutile, fluorite, pyrochlore, KCl,
LiF, NaCl, etc.), M for each varies only by sign, because the positions of the ions
in the cell are the same and vary only by charge.
35
Chemical fundamentals and applications of molten salts

Indirectly, M is a measure of the complexity of a crystallographic unit cell, which
often reveals useful information about the crystal. Each interatomic position within a
low-symmetry unit cell has its own M, reflecting its local environment. This is due to
the geometry, coordination number of the ions, molecular size, and the symmetry of
the unit cell, and the distribution of the electronic charge on the ions themselves.
Calculations of M diverge in lower symmetry crystals for several reasons, so more
advanced mathematical tools must be used (Madelung, 1919; Streever and Caplan,
1973; Glasser and Zucker, 1980; Borwein et al., 1985; Burns, 1993).
In complex, inorganic crystals (such as TaCl5) the bonds between the ions are
not purely ionic, due to the large Zeff on the valence electrons. Some covalent bond-
ing is therefore present, which prohibits simple constants.
The electron density distributions of lower-transition metals often do not adopt
spherical symmetry, which is assumed in calculating M in high-symmetry crystals,
such as those listed in Fig. 3.2 (Streever and Caplan, 1973; Burns, 1993).
Researchers often use the “next-nearest neighbor” (NNN) protocol, because
lower symmetry unit cells, which often contain high Z elements and/or complex
ligands, have electronic effects beyond their immediate surroundings (Hoover et al.,
1970; Brawer, 1980).
Trends are readily apparent in the data in Fig. 3.2. The more ionic a system is,
the more negative the lattice energy. This is often partially estimated by the electro-
negativity of the element. Additionally, “ionicity" is influenced by the so-called Zeff
or the effective charge imposed on the ith electron in the valence orbital. Pure
ionicity exists in some of the systems below.
In systems with modest ionicity and proximal, opposite charges in low-
symmetry crystals, Coulombics and covalence are “felt” further away than merely
NNN, thereby altering Upot. Finally, low-symmetry crystals often have high coordi-
nate numbers for the metal center. The metal centers of the ligands attached have a
range of interatomic distances, and often some of the total number of ligands are
“shared” between nearby metal centers. To break these bonds, i.e., to change the
phase of the system, multiple M values complicate the determination of the system

lattice energy. The valence orbital electron densities “searching” for the lowest
energy configurations compound this view. This situation is described by ligand field
theory8. Calculations are made as to the hybridized electron orbital occupancy, which
affects the geometry of the unit cell, namely, structural changes in atomic positioning
due to valence electron ordering to achieve the lowest energy. Though beyond the
scope of this work, the reader can review the broad subject of crystal-field splitting
theory and the derivations to understand ionic deviations from spherical symmetry
(Streever and Caplan, 1973; Burns, 1993).
The crystallographic unit cell is a method of determining the most economic,
formulaic representation of compounds like MgF2, BaTiO3, etc. The space group
categorizes the complexity of a particular unit cell. Each crystalline compound may
be classified into one of 230 space groups. Essentially, classification is determined
by the way(s) one travels from one crystallographic point occupied by one atom or
molecule within the unit cell to another by vector or geometric/algebraic operators
such as rotations, translations, screw rotations, etc. In simple structures such as
halite (table salt; cubic) or more complex ones (TaCl5; monoclinic), these symme-
tries within the unit cell dictate the space group in which they fall. Several histori-
cal conventions have been adopted; both Schoenflies and Hermann-Mauguin
conventions are used in Fig. 3.3 (Chase, 1998; Mighell et al., 1977; Henry and
Lonsdale, 1965).

Chemical fundamentals and applications of molten salts

In ionic systems, near-complete, formal, opposite charges are exerted on one
another. The fewer electrons, the higher the Zeff and, therefore, the more negative
the lattice energy. For less ionic or covalent crystals such as sugars or the classic
compound adamantane, where van der Waals forces dominate, the lattice energies
are much less negative.
3.2.5
Soft-sphere equations of state for the molten phase:
The Helmholtz equation and proposed modifications
resulting from molten-salt chemistry
Equations of state (EOS) are used to describe the thermodynamic properties of
states of matter in the form of state functions. The EOS bears directly on the den-
sity and viscosity of the MSR system because the (dynamic) chemical components
of the system dictate how the fluid(s) perform at temperature, pressure, internal
energy, work, etc.
Solid state 6 enthalpy of fusion ! Liquid state
The enthalpy of fusion refers to the amount of the heat added to the system to
promote the transition from solid to liquid (kJ  mol21).
The chemical potentials for the entire set of species PμjdNj (emergent and con-
stant, so this is a simplistic, incomplete representation) should be considered. This
term represents the chemical potential (μj) or the interacting potential energy
among the number of particles, N, and the different species j within the system.
This is particularly applicable to the MSR and the thermal behavior of both the pri-
mary and secondary loops, because the chemistries are dynamic, irreversible due to
fission and offgassing (in the case of fuel salt), and not purely isochoric. Good data
have been collated by Beneˇs and Konings on candidate eutectic mixtures in a
review of previous work (Noh et al., 2014; Beneˇs and Konings, 2009).
The so-called soft sphere equation of state (SSEOS) for the liquidus transition was
first explored in the 1970s. Hoover et al. used virial expansion to the 12th iteration
(Hoover et al., 1970). This method proved reasonably accurate experimentally and
roughly coincided with Monte Carlo simulations (Dai et al., 2016). Those Monte Carlo
calculations, although state of the art for that era, proved to be only rough estimates.
This was based mostly on the discontinuities found in the density curves as a result of
changes to the system, namely, composition, Boltzmann temperature, etc., given that
the density of the equations relied on viscosity of the system.
The best approach remains the Helmholtz version of the SSEOS (Hoover et al.,
1970; Griffard et al., 2013a,b; Dai et al., 2016). The simplicity of space groups for
binary salts in the solid state proved to be a critical tool for calculations of SSEOS
in the liquid phase. Chen et al. described the EOS for 2LiF  BeF2 or Li2BeF4
(“FLiBe”) as a function of Boltzmann temperature (Chen et al., 1992). Their work
demonstrated that any heat exchanger or MSR would encounter substantial changes
in internal compression and, therefore, thermohydraulic performance with a closed
system as a function of temperature (Dai et al., 2016). Their study of these basic
38
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

compounds could be reasonably applied to secondary loops as well, since more sub-
stantial changes in temperature will be realized in heat exchangers on secondary
loops. This bears directly on heat-exchanger performance (pumps, impellers, perfor-
mance life) for so-called downstream hydrocarbon chemistry or any chemistry
affected by secondary loops, and the MSR core itself.
As covalency begins to play a larger role in the molten phase, the geometry of
rocksalt structures, typically with the cubic space groups or high-symmetry crystals,
the unit cell begins to adopt a noncuboidal geometry, “bowing” out the otherwise
ionic, linear bonds toward the molecularorbital hybridization characteristic of
covalent species.
Griffard et al. investigated the thermodynamic properties of some binary and
ternary mixtures of fluoride salts, relying heavily on the high space-group symmetry
of the fluoride salts (see Fig. 3.3) (Griffard et al., 2013a,b). While their conclusions
produced accurate results, they were based on both computational and empirical
data, but had four adjustable parameters (n, Q m, d) (see Fig. 3.4).
Griffard et al. also incorporated BeF2, KF, NaF, and LiF into their molten-salt
SSEOS (Griffard et al., 2013a,b; Dai et al., 2016). The effective modeling of BeF2
is possibly due to its different thermodynamic properties, relative to metal fluorides
adjacent to beryllium fluoride in the periodic table. It occupies an unusual niche
spanning a low-temperature gap between LiF, NaF, and MgF2.
Griffard’s modifications to the modified Helmholz equation are the most
advanced in the literature of molten salt thermodynamics (Griffard et al., 2013a,b;
Dai et al., 2016). The Helmholtz EOS has historically been a useful tool for scien-
tists, given its inherent flexibility and ability to incorporate other terms or deriva-
tions, such as the virial equation or the partition function. The weakness of this
Figure 3.4 The Griffard equations and the parameters used therein.
39
Chemical fundamentals and applications of molten salts

approach is that a number of parameters, usually taking the exponential positions,
as in the third, fourth, and fifth terms below, can be manipulated. The terms that
they modify, however, carry little physical significance.
The Griffard equation could benefit from the incorporation of chemical modifi-
cations of Helmholtz parameters specific to solid-state chemistry, namely: N, Cn, E,
ρ, bcc, and Ecoh. This would require extensive, computationally driven, molecular
dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) assistance to be applicable to
an MSR, as cited elsewhere (Noh et al., 2014; Dai et al., 2016).
The quantity Ni of molecules of each molten salt constituent is constantly chang-
ing, due to the production of fission products and offgassing, excluding in situ or ex
situ removal of waste products. This number, however, is calculable. The total num-
ber and mass of the fission products being produced and/or removed is known.
Considering that a steady-state equilibrium is the goal of any nuclear system, a multi-
component tracking of offgassing could prove to be a reasonably accurate indicator
of dNi/dt, where Ni represents the moles of each isotope being produced.
Given a known initial salt load, the neutron flux (location dependent), the core and
ancillary geometries and the number of neutrons (in moles), and the statistical proba-
bility of a neutron uptake by a nuclide, these mathematics can be solved analytically.
The Madelung constant (Cn, Ecoh; third and external bracketed terms) for most crys-
tals more complex than fcc (face-centered cubic) or bcc (body-centered cubic), will
require heterogeneous, interatomic-specific Madelung values. For more complex spe-
cies found in an MSR such as monomers or oligomers (as would normally be found for
many of these species within an MSR), the complexity is challenging and yet feasible;
eutectic and peritectic points are well-known for different salt compositions and those
can be determined via scientific modalities that have been utilized for years.
In the solid state, these crystals are also of low symmetry, thereby expanding the
Madelung component of NbF5, TeF4/6, LnF3, etc., crystals, space groups, E, fcc, ρ,
and Ecoh, as found in the Griffard equation.
For the more complex Madelung values, in contrast to the single constants found
in the fcc and bcc space groups, the accompanying lattice energies will be affected
as well. Empirical data may be useful, since M values for lower symmetry crystals
either diverge or conditionally diverge, often because the “NNN” have a complex
effect on the M value of interest (Henry and Lonsdale, 1965; Borwein et al., 1985;
Salanne et al., 2008). It may be more prudent to learn from the ab-initio work done
by Dai et al. and Noh et al., using density functional theory (DFT). Their work
incorporating the relative amounts of covalent bonding and phase change in the
molten state with MD simulations, demonstrated that trimers and covalently bound
clusters can form within the melt (Noh et al., 2014; Dai et al., 2016).
The density term, ρ, is specific to fcc in the Griffard case and relies on the high
symmetry of the space groups to which these crystals belong. Packing in the solid
and liquid states is calculable, since they follow the patterns of cubic close packing
(CCP) or hexagonal close packing (HCP) motifs. This simplicity is lost for any
molecules of lower symmetry, so both densities and viscosities will vary substan-
tially while passing through a primary or secondary heat-exchanger loop.
40
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

Intermolecular potential energy (IPE) or E according to Griffard could be more
explicitly defined (Epsilon 5 intermolecular potential energy [induced ion dipole
moment]). This challenging range of forces (dipoledipole interactions; induced
dipole, dispersion forces, etc.) combines in different, dynamic ways to permit F
exchange. Ecoh depends on lattice energy. Energetically below ionic and covalent
bonding, primary IPE forces in either a primary or secondary MSR loop would pre-
dominantly be dipoledipole and dipoleinduced dipole interactions, particularly
with tetravalent coordinated salts, UFx (x 5 3.x4.x) and the degrees of freedom
these weak forces permit. Noninteger stoichiometries denote a flexibility in the sys-
tem, often due to fluctuating Lewis pH, as in this case. In the liquid state, these
forces apply and ionic forces play at least a moderate role. In contrast to UFx, ThF4
participates as a solvent, due to its strong ionic bonds, even in the molten state;
very little fluorine loss or change in electronic distribution occurs.
The cohesive energy term (Ecoh) returns to the Madelung values with Ecoh
defined as:
Ecoh 5 Ulatt 2 ðh298 2 h0Þ 2 ðhTm 2 h298Þ 1 vRTm
As can be seen in the definition of Ecoh, an expansion of the Madelung values to
a Riemannian sum would be required, using the different melting points (Tm) of
each component.
The complexities that accompany the phase change from the solid to the molten
are the most vexing. Crystallographic properties affect the liquid phase, a largely
ionic state, but with clear covalent influences affecting the mixture. These proper-
ties affect the interactive geometries observed in model systems, as shown in past
studies of molten nitratechloride mixtures (Thoma, 1962).
Molecular ratios and cationic size play roles in the solid and molten states. LnF3
(where lanthanides Ln 5 Y and the elements of the sixth row of the Periodic Table)
are more complex in the solid state, but stand out as an important feature in MSR
chemistry. A majority of the fission products are lanthanides, which can be well
described by MD modeling (Salanne, et al., 2008; Madden et al., 2016; Dai et al.,
2016). These models have strong theoretical origins, resting on the quasilinear rela-
tionships of lanthanides regarding cationic size and accommodation in the solid
state (e.g., LnF32
6
octahedra) (Dai et al., 2016).
The definitions of eutectic and peritectic can point in specific directions, and
some parallels can be made: eutectics are two crystallographic lattices being fused,
where each sublattice that comprises the superlattice retains its respective space
group. The space group of the two “fused” sublattices results in a new space group
of lower symmetry. A peritectic solution involves a liquid and a solid that, when
mixed, result in a new solid, again of lower symmetry. In a majority of historical
cases, typified in the recent work of Capelli et al., solid solutions occur when the
stoichiometries are noninteger, as in their investigations of the LiFCaF2ThF4
system (Capelli et al., 2015). The in-situ stoichiometries that occur in the molten
salt eutectics/peritectics loosely reflect back on the two separate Hermann-Mauguin
classifications depicted in Fig. 3.5 (Chen et al., 1992; Griffard et al., 2013a,b).
41
Chemical fundamentals and applications of molten salts

Consistent with cationic size, the species LiNa(BeF3)2 (not listed in Fig. 3.5) with the
extremely small packing (a05 1.09A˚ ) are isostructural with NaBeF3 and Na2BeF2.
Despite being ternary, its small size is nonintuitive and accommodates two BeF3 units.
Thus, BeFy2
n
n-mers mentioned previously can be reconciled with the information here.
As depicted, an SSEOS remains a static, isochoric system with no chemistry occur-
ring. Further, terms three through five (see Fig. 3.3) all contain adjustable parameters
that are chemical properties. Although complex, they are calculable, particularly when
E, ν, n, m, and Ecoh are included in the calculations. As with all chemical or physical
systems, a steady-state equilibrium is the goal. With systems so massive and such
wide-ranging (yet tractable) chemistries, like those found in primary and secondary
loops, perhaps a more chemically dynamic perspective could be considered.
In MSR cases, the species are constantly changing radii, oligomerizing and
exchanging anions (in the case of fluoride and chloride salts) with one another in the
bath. The chloride salt system is somewhat different, in that the bath is Lewis acidic,
because no Lewis base system appears to have been identified. BeCl2, although studied
and geometrically identical to BeF2, does not appear to have been considered as a
eutectic. The Lewis pH of these systems can be explored, but only systematically and
with a combination of both empirical and quantum-chemical, computational assistance.
Lewis pH changes initiate complex shifts in ionic bonding, n-meric geometries, and
the like. It is computationally challenging to accommodate for these shifts in the
Lanthanide (Ln) and actinide (An) rows, since relativistic effects on the valence
electrons play an increasing role in their chemistries.
Despite careful investigation, Griffard et al., demonstrate the difficulties in
predicting changes in density and viscosity, even for high-symmetry space-group sys-
tems (Griffard et al., 2013a,b). Their smallest calculated deviations from empirical
data result from their thorough examinations of pure salts. Their temperatures were
also fixed in their experiments, but substantial increases and decreases are expected
in both the primary and secondary loops, due to fission products and temperature
Figure 3.5 (A) The Salem-Klopman perturbation equation, (B) variable definitions for (A).
42
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

gradients in the heat exchangers. Their additional simplification regarding an isocho-
ric state is impractical for real-world application.
Adding calculable (albeit very challenging at this level of complexity) dynamics
and reactivity may diminish the variability in the Griffard equation, particularly as
it pertains to terms three through five in the SSEOS (Fig. 3.4). It may even modify
and/or restructure it. This could, in turn, be improved upon by inclusion of a modi-
fied Salem-Klopman equation Klopman (1968) (Fig. 3.5).
The Salem-Klopman equation (see Fig. 3.5), first proffered by the eponymous
chemists in the 1960s, defined the chemical dynamics. The three terms in the Salem-
Klopman equation have been satisfactory for use in density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. With advances in computing power, DFT substantially accelerates
understanding of complex molecular systems that involve both ionic and covalent
interactions. To date, very few DFT calculations have been applied to MSR
chemistry.
Solving these complex interactions could rely on DFT, as it is based on mean
field theory (MFT). In this case, time-dependent MFT (TMFT) may be more appro-
priate, since an operating schedule and the nuclear fission rate are known, given
predetermined parameters.
Crystallography again plays a role in shedding some light on optimal eutectic
and peritectic points, and their accompanying stoichiometries. Direct comparisons
between the solid and liquid phases can be drawn to some extent.
As the SSEOS name implies, the soft sphere is a sphere where the total spherical
fluctuations of electron densities integrate to zero. These fluctuations are necessar-
ily quasicovalent in the molten state, even with binary crystals that are highly ionic
in the solid state, like NaF. The approach toward spherical geometry requires a
“bowing” due to increasing, heat-driven, molecular hybridization, before lattice
energy is broken. The most likely reason for the additional success with BeF2 was
the quasispherical shape of the total 2M1  [BeF4]22 species in the molten state
(Noh et al., 2014; Dai et al., 2016).
In the solid state, BeF2 is four-coordinate, isostructural with β-cristoballite, and
hence resides in the cubic Fd3(bar)m space group (Parthe´, 1964). It adopts sp3 hybrid-
ization, but with substantially covalent bonding, called dative bonding, or “coordinate,
covalent” bonding, where two electrons stem from the same element or species. The
ionic character is, therefore, significantly lower. Two fluorines bridge between neigh-
boring Be atoms. Beryllium’s high electronegativity causes deviation away from true,
four-coordinate, “pure” (θ 5 109.5 degrees) sp3 hybridization and geometry in BeF2
(Dove et al., 1997; Swainson and Dove, 1993). This lends itself to a mean of 109.5
degrees, meaning bond angles and lengths are changing (Dove et al., 1997; Swainson
and Dove, 1993). Dative bonding and nonrigid FaBeaF geometries and bond lengths
promote the propensity for BeF2 to form polymeric systems in the solid state, like the
isostructural β-cristobalite and the many polymorphs of SiO2 (Rakitin et al., 2015).
Therefore, it appears highly likely that the n-mers seen in the molten state are at least
partially due to these unusual characteristics for such a small molecule.
The [BeF4]22 tetrahedron carries the formal 2 charge in the molten state. In
the molten state, the two fluorines are donated to the BeF2 from the two LiF

Chemical fundamentals and applications of molten salts

molecules, making it a covalent, [BeF4]22 tetrahedral anion, now sp3 purely hybrid-
ized. With 2e2 density now distributed tetrahedrally among the four fluorines, the
two lithium cations dynamically charge-compensate the negatively charged fluoride
ligands, where the electron density is greatest. Critically, however, electron
electron repulsion will cause the electron density that forms the 2 charge to remain
distributed among the four fluorines for a statistical majority of time within the
anionic tetrahedron. The dynamics of these high-temperature, high-entropy systems
will cause these tetrahedrally opposed densities (e/2) to fluctuate quickly about the
tetrahedron. Consistently, the loosely bound Li1 also charge stabilizes in calculated
DFT simulations for the dimers, trimers, and tetramers of [BeF4]22:[Be2F7]32 and
[Be3F10]42, respectively (Salanne et al., 2008; Noh et al., 2014; Dai et al., 2016).
The flexibility of the [BenFn1y(y51,3,5. . .)]n112 to form oligomers and to be sensitive
to Lewis pH have an effect on the Lewis acid/base pair. This changes the viscosity
and density of the fluid, because the networks of interacting [BenFn1y(y51,3,5. . .)]n112
clusters increases. Given the increased presence of covalency in the molten state,
these species (and larger clusters) of the parent Li2BeF4 are reasonable, so long as
“global” charge compensation and MO hybridization are satisfied.
The argument remains the same for MF (M . Li5Na, K, etc.). However, the masses
of the M . Li cations are approximately 3.3 times (and greater) the mass of the lithium
cations, which is why 2M . LiF  BeF2 fosters a good discussion regarding optimal
eutectic salts. One could consider calling this charge compensation a “hopping” or
stabilizing frequency for the sodium or potassium cation around the [BeF4]22. This
frequency is lower, in comparison to lithium, diminished by its mass. This is the
rate at which the two M $ Li cations per unit can charge-compensate the [BeF4]22
tetrahedral anion in the liquid state.
All species in the first term of the S-K equation are known, given the initial salt
load and at thermal/neutronic equilibrium. The resonance and overlap integrals can
be estimated, since the total number of moles for every species can be calculated.
In the molten state, these distances are either estimable or are already known.
Furthermore, the chemical reaction rates of all species can also be calculated,
because all reactions are predictable (it is a closed system).
The chemical potential (μ) is the intermolecular potential energy, which is also a
calculable term in the Griffard equation because in the S-K equation, Coulombic
repulsion as a function of mean distance in the bath for all of the ions present can
also be quantified.
As can be seen in the third term, below, the quadratic components (P
rs) refer to
“occupied” and “unoccupied” and denote the HOMO and LUMO molecular
orbitals. These terms include the Legendre polynomials or the geometry that the
molecules adopt as a result of their covalent and ionic interactions.
The adjustable parameters modify terms 35 in the Griffard equation and the
enthalpy terms found in Ecoh, but they are modified, based on iterative estimates,
predominantly modifying the density terms exponentially. So, even with simple
fcc and/or bcc systems, changes in density affect the multiplicative terms
substantially.

Summary of physicochemical properties
of molten salts and theoretical considerations
Having a good understanding of the crystallographic basis for molten systems is
essential to understand the solid-to-molten transition and the molten state.
Historically, the density of the solid state has been done pycnometrically (Viana
et al., 2002).9 The density of the liquid (molten) state has been done using more
advanced equipment: thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC). However, considering the challenges of these caustic systems,
dedicated and long-term analysis with specialized systems is needed.
One needs a thorough understanding of the solid state in order to understand the
molten state because:
G
The complexity of the solid-state unit cell bears directly on the complexity of the resultant
molecule in the molten state.
G
The more geometrically complex the unit cell is, the greater the probable number of oligo-
meric, ionocovalent bonds will occur in the molten state.
G
The Lewis acidity/basicity of simple, binary salts increase ΔS as a function of pseudo-
spherical geometry, and their interference with salts that have differing Lewis pH.
G
The lower the salt components are in the periodic table (e.g., involving tetrahedral and/or
octahedral coordination of higher electronic orbitals) in the solid state necessarily
increases the complexity of the resultant intermolecular, ionocovalent interactions in the
molten state.
G
Fermi-Dirac statistics (Boltzmann) add additional complexity to determining viscosity
and/or equations of state, because the electronic populations of each molecular orbital
change in number as f(T).
G
The relative interactions of the higher orbitals’ changes within the d orbitals. Each d
orbital will take prominence regarding the interactions of the surrounding molecules.
MSRs and their rich chemistries have been studied extensively since the 1950s.
Their thermodynamic and thermochemical properties have been thoroughly investi-
gated. Glassner, for example, covered a range of thermodynamic properties of the
chlorides, oxides, and fluorides (Glassner, 1957). In addition to central station elec-
tric power, MSRs can have many other beneficial applications.
3.3
Remote power sources

Historical context
Policy makers have indicated interest in the prospect of remote power sources (RPS)
since the 1970s (Carter, 1977; Martinez, 2002; Wiedemann et al., 2005; El-Genk,
2009). Many very radioactive isotopes could be harvested from MSRs for RPS
applications.

Radioisotope thermoelectric generators and betavoltaic
cells as RPSs: Extracting electrical work from MSR waste
Both Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs) and Betavoltaic Cells (BCs)
have served as remote power sources for decades, from the well-known 238Pu
(RTG, α emitter), to 90Sr, 90Y, 137Cs 147Pm, and 3H for BCs (Corliss and Harvey,
1964; Karam and Stein, 2009; Yakubov, 2010). Ex-situ billets of purified fission
products can produce exceptional thermal output. The Soviets, e.g., used 90Sr to
power their distant lighthouses positioned along the Arctic and White Seas. With an
approximate half-life of 28.8 years and a theoretical power/mass ratio of 916
mW  g21, this strong β2 emitter served the Soviets well during the Cold War.
Fig. 3.6 demonstrates NASA’s substantial use of BCs and RTGs as power sources
for a wide range of previous missions.
Although more difficult to work with due to its violent reactions with ambient
water, 137Cs is also a strong β2 emitter with a half-life of approximately 30.2 years.
A theoretical yield of approximately 427 mW  g21 makes it suitable as a source
material for BCs. Fig. 3.7 depicts a partial list of RTG and BC materials.
Fig. 3.7 also depicts 1xXe (x5 33,35,37,40) 85, 87-91Kr and 13zI (z 5 14) as candi-

with the application of fluorine chemistry (KrFn; n 5 2, 4, 6, 8), it is impractical to do
so because the betas produced will engender radiolysis and decomposition (Zˆ emva
et al., 1975; Lutar et al., 1985; Sun et al., 2005; Anderson and Wong, 2005; Surapudi,
2011). KrFn is also unstable at STP. Gaseous source materials also present their own
engineering difficulties. Nevertheless, it may be possible to use 1xyXe and 13zI2 in
novel BC, ion-drive and MPDT thruster configurations for space applications.
Additional research into materials and geometries would be required to accommo-
date such unusual BC systems (Sun et al., 2005; King et al., 2007). Some interesting
configurations for the BC using the Xe/I combination could be imagined, however, tak-
ing advantage of the dramatic differences in melting/boiling points, the molar heat
capacity differences and extremely high beta output. The fission gases Xe and Cs vapor
were expelled into space with the TOPAZ design (Nguyen et al., 2001; Al-Shammari
et al., 2014). Modern designs could more readily exploit waste gases through both BC
and thermionic emission. A low but constant stream of high-energy offgases from an
MSR on-board a space vehicle could serve as a strong BC source material. NASA
investigated the Stirling RTG and BC (Nguyen et al., 2001; Wolverton, 2008;
Yabukov, 2010), where a thermal gradient cools and heats an inert gas, such as helium.
The differential induces mechanical motion of a cantilever, thereby converting a ther-
mal differential into mechanical energy. Prototypes reached 23% efficiency and could
theoretically reach 30% (Stine and Diver, 1999; Nguyen et al., 2001).

Space-based nuclear reactors as remote power sources
China and Russia have investigated space-based nuclear systems for more than a
half century and the United States has done so intermittently (Wiedemann et al.,
2005; El-Genk, 2009). The Soviet Union’s RORSAT and COMOS lines of satellites
employed nuclear reactors from 1970 to 1988, especially in the BUK MOX reactor
model. (See Figs. 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10 for additional historical and technical detail for
international deployment of space-based nuclear reactors.)

distance: 2.25 3 108 km) a central question that has pervaded “Mars enthusiasts” is
the issue of fuel. It is not feasible to bring large volumes of chemical fuel. The
greater eccentricity of Mars’ orbit, its perigee, relative to Earth’s orbit, yields a
minimum distance of 5.46 3 107 km.
Neither additional tanks, nor low-Earth orbit coupling (the so-called “sling-shot”
effect) would suffice unless this were a one-way trip and the mission could refuel
upon landing on the Martian surface—an option that an MSR RPS would offer.
Note Figs. 3.9 and 3.10, where fission reactors feature prominently as high-energy,
long-duration power sources (Van Dyke et al., 2001).
All BUK models used NaK alloy as the coolant. The BUK model, with the BUK
3 being the most often used, was deployed with all of the RORSAT launch vehicles
bearing the COSMOS satellites, totaling 31 successful launches (Wiedemann et al.,
2005; El-Genk, 2009). The satellites were boosted into high (800100 km) orbit,

however, sometimes with negative, unintended consequences. Most notably, the
deactivation of these units resulted in solid NaK debris on the order of microns to
centimeters in size. Sixteen COSMOS, Soviet-era nuclear satellites were discharged
in such a way, from 1981 to 1988, thus complicating many space-based missions
from then on (Wiedemann et al., 2005; El-Genk, 2009) (Fig. 3.11).
3.3.4
Materials considerations for a space-based MSR
A near complete absence of maintenance is one of the NASA requirements for
space-based vehicles. This same goal holds true for Russian efforts for the better
part of the last two decades. In particular, the Russians have investigated the use of
magnetoplasma dynamic thrusters (MPDT) as a simple, but effective means of pro-
pulsion. (Ostrovsky et al., ДУҚ; Gorshkov et al., 2007). These parameters are per-
haps also reflected in the short duration of the Soviet nuclear-powered RORSAT
series of satellites, as the longest mission was only 135 days. Although not found in
the literature, the extreme physical, neutronic, thermodynamic, and structural consid-
erations likely played a central role in Soviet designs. NASA’s intermittent attempts at
designing nuclear-powered satellites are documented in the literature (see Figs. 3.8
and 3.10; Yvon and Carre´, 2009; http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/
non-power-nuclear-applications/transport/nuclear-reactors-for-space.aspx).
Austenitic and martensitic steels have been used successfully in Soviet missions
for the reactor designs, including offgassing ports directly exposed to space.
Fig. 3.12 depicts the choice of reactor materials as a function of temperature
(Busby and Leonard, 2007; Yvon and Carre´, 2009). The high chromium content of
both materials would retard their use in MSRs due to the four available oxidation
states of Cr with respect to fluorine; the enthalpy of formation for each (ΔHf) of
each (CrF25) to form is feasible, but with varying ΔGs. Similar incompatibilities

are seen for Mo and Fe in both alloys as well as in their facility for fluoride forma-
tion (Compere et al., 1975).
It is unlikely that refractory materials could be used extensively in a space-based
MSR design with high-temperature gradients. Internal subsystems where such gra-
dients do not exist and in which little or no salt bath exposure would occur could
be feasible locations. Maintenance of their properties at high temperatures is a dis-
tinct advantage. Further research is needed on carboncarbon composites or
carbonSiC composites, if prolonged heat and neutronic bombardment do not
impact the SiC.
A one-way trip to Mars (called Mars One©) basic exploration and colonization
is slated for 2026. A small scientific team with the appropriate instrumentation
could produce large quantities of information on all levels, including isotopic dat-
ing, areology, areophysics, and areochemistry. Seven candidates have been prelim-
inarily chosen from a pool of over 78,000, but a minority are scientists.
MSRs as RPSs would satisfy both strict NASA/JPL requirements and offer the
distinct option of round-trip missions to and from Mars for several reasons (see
Fig. 3.13). Although logistically difficult, the transport of a small (50 MWe) MSR
is feasible, particularly if the MSR is used as the long-term propulsion needed for
the space vehicle, and is then subsequently used as the power source for extended
colonization. One field of engaging research is the prospect of using magnetoplas-
madynamic thrusters (MPDT). This class of ion drive uses the Lorentz force, gener-
ating substantial thrust (Uribarri and Choueiri, 2009). The prospect of using an
MPDT as primary, in-flight propulsion and possible landing suggests two possible
advantages of using an MSR as an RPS. The first is that the high electricity require-
ment for this powerful class of drive (as high as 10 MW) can be met with an on-
board MSR. Secondly, xenon has already been studied as an ion source, and iodine
is an acceptable candidate as well (Uribarri and Choueiri, 2009; Ostrovsky et al.,
ДУҚ; Gorshkov et al., 2007). Xenon and iodine offgases (and to a lesser extent, Kr)
from an MSR would serve as a continuously produced fuel source, and the

Chemical fundamentals and applications of molten salts

corrosion of the thoriated tungsten cathode observed in the MPDT prototypes is
moderated with higher mass ions (Uribarri and Choueiri, 2009).
MSR component shipments could be staggered to stay within the rocket load
capacity, with some low-earth-orbit assembly required. Habitation, oxygen produc-
tion, food production, machine mobility, and structural material construction could
all be facilitated by a functional MSR with adequate fuel for sustained use.
3.3.5
Fueling the MSR on Mars and its employment
as elemental production platform
During the increasingly advanced investigations conducted in the last decade, the
presence of the elements that may be needed (U, F, Th, Cl) to produce fuel on Mars
have all been detected. Candidate eutectic materials (Na, Zr, Ba, Li) were also
found and in nontrivial quantities (Gooding, 1978; Griffith and Shock, 1995;
Romulus, 2012; Moser, 2015). Although not directly observed, feldspar, olivine,
Fayalite, Albite, and plagioclase have likely been found, based on collected geo-
chemical data over the span of increasingly sophisticated Mars missions. This pro-
vides confidence that Cl, Be, B, P, Ni, Si, and other elements relevant to off-world

concentrations
were

(Bandfield, 2002; Williams, 1997; McSween et al., 2001; Haynes, 2011; Ma et al.,

U, Th, and F, respectively.

Chemical fundamentals and applications of molten salts

In Fig. 3.15, the Epworth-5 line may be revealing. The data analysis that Forni
et al. performed strongly suggests the presence of not only fluorite (CaF2), but also
the likely presence of fluorapatite (Ca5(PO4)3F) and strontium fluoride (SrF2)
(Moser, 2015; Forni et al., 2015). Reduction of fluorine from the fluorapatite would
also produce phosphate. As on Earth, the apatite-derived phosphate is then charge
balanced with ammonium cation to produce fertilizer.
The logistical need for reduction of CO2 to accommodate humans and plant
growth is obviously met by the heavily CO2-laden Martian atmosphere. Recent
Mars missions have since confirmed the chemistry found within the Chassigny
Nakhla Shergotty (CNS) meteorite, including phosphates, carbonates, and other spe-
cies (Williams, 1997; McSween et al., 2001). MSRs could serve as the thermal and
electrical power source for reduction of minerals into their constituent elements,
including P, Si, K, Ca, Al, and others.
One critical issue for prospective travelers will be oxygen production for
humans, plants, and likely animals. At an enthalpy of 532 kJ  mol21, the sp2
hybridized oxygen bonds on the central carbon of CO2 prove particularly robust
(Haynes, 2011). Many attempts throughout the previous decades at low-energy
reduction of the carbon to liberate the oxygen have failed, whether electrolytically,
electrochemically, or thermoelectrochemically (Ren et al., 2015).
One group of researchers, however, recently published a molten-salt electrolytic
method of carbon reduction with the added feature of generating carbon nanotubes
at the cathode and pure oxygen at the anode (Yin and Moss, 1999; Ren et al.,
2015). The operating temperature for this molten lithium carbonate (Li2CO3)-driven
electrolytic process is 750C. The researchers note that eutectics can bring the tem-
perature lower, and addition of other metals (as catalysts) can tune the properties of
the nanotubes. The Li2CO3 exists in equilibrium with the CO2, thereby rendering
the carbon available to reduction at the cathode (Yin and Moss, 1999).
As one of the main needs for prospective colonists, secondary MSR loops could
provide a thermal platform to effect this oxygen production chemistry. Ample sup-
plies of CO2 exist in a 97 1 % CO2 Martian atmosphere. The CO2 could be used in
supercritical Rankine systems.
Despite the difficulty of Mars retaining atmospheric species, due to the absence
of a magnetosphere, the relative atmospheric loss is slower than oxygen production
would be, provided the rate of production exceeds 100 g  s21 (Dong et al., 2015;
Neal-Jones et al., 2015).
Structural materials such as iron, titanium, and aluminum can also be produced
at the temperatures at which an MSR operates on Mars. A 700C minimum is
needed for small-scale, electrolytic aluminum production, and 500C for titanium
using alternate processes (Jacobs, 1974; Kamali et al., 2008; Cuadros and
Michalski, 2013). An appreciable current must also be available from the MSR for
these high-temperature, electrolytic methods. To facilitate this aluminum production
at lower temperatures, kaolinite must be used. This mineral has also been found on
the Martian surface, and so have chlorine-containing minerals (Jacobs, 1974;
Kamali et al., 2008; Hecht et al., 2009; Cuadros and Michalski, 2013). Aluminum
chloride (AlCl3) is synthesized, then used as a strongly Lewis-acidic, molten salt to
54
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

dissolve the kaolinite and permit electrolytic reduction of aluminum. The use of
kaolinite as the source mineral for aluminum (replacing bauxite), combined with
the use of AlCl3 permits the lower-temperature electrolytic method of aluminum
reduction (Jacobs, 1974; Cuadros and Michalski, 2013).
To gauge exactly how much of a substantial remedy the presence of CO2 and its
interaction with plants, however, a unique experiment was undertaken in the
Netherlands. Royal Dutch Shell participated in a trial, whereby CO2 being emitted
from one of their stacks was shuttled through an unused, underground pipe to a
nexus of greenhouses approximately 85 km away (http://www.dw.com/en/dutch-
farmers-boost-production-with-co2-waste/a-2214482;
http://www.the-linde-group.
com/en/clean_technology/clean_technology_portfolio/co2_applications/greenhou-
se_supply/index.html). The experiment proved a partial success, in that 400 green-
houses consumed 170 metric tons of CO2. Another 100 greenhouses were added in
2006, but some CO2 is released during plant decomposition. As of 2011, 350 metric
tons have been used as a growth accelerant, with 25% faster growth for all species.
CO2 consumption is cyclic, tethered to the growth cycles of the plants. A more
concerted effort toward staggered growth could be employed using atmospheric
CO2 on Mars as a nearly inexhaustible resource.
Figs. 3.10 and 3.13 clearly demonstrate a requisite need for a diverse energy
landscape regarding space travel. As is well known, photon intensity varies as
the inverse square of the distance. Accordingly, extended NASA missions
beyond 4 AU (AU 5 Astronomical Unit 5 149.6 M km 5 mean distance from the
center of the Sun to the center of the Earth) are not practical using solar arrays as
the primary power source. This, despite the superior efficiency of solar arrays
(30%40%) being produced in the new and growing field of multijunction cells
(Sun et al., 2005; King et al., 2007). As with any energy production modality,
solar arrays have an optimal usage window. Over time, solar arrays will likely
succumb to the fine regolith dust that makes up the Martian landscape or, as
noted in Fig. 3.12, exceed their practical usage window for prolonged and deeper
space missions.
3.4
Heat exchangers and materials
embrittlement challenges
Materials science, chemistry, neutronics, and heat transfer problems must all be solved
for MSR heat exchanger design. Tube shapes, wall thickness, hoop stress, thermal
stress, creep, swelling, embrittlement, and corrosion must be considered. A simple
tube-within-a-tube design is trusted, minimizes surface area and is a natural choice,
because larger bore sizes can stave off possible crystalline precipitation of less soluble
species such as Pu, Np, and Ln. The concomitant drawback is that surface area is
small, thereby leaving much heat remaining within the inner radial laminae (rmax
rmax2n). Since it is well known that the materials undergo slow changes over time,
this means that the chemical potential of the materials themselves also changes. Early
55
Chemical fundamentals and applications of molten salts

work on the examination of postexperimental materials demonstrated that all radionu-
clides exhibit some damage to the walls of the heat exchangers and, therefore, the
core
(http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/non-power-nuclear-applica-
tions/transport/nuclear-reactors-for-space.aspx). Some of the most aggressive nuclides
are listed below.
3.4.1
Tellurium embrittlement
Chalcogens all exhibit a high electron affinity, being members of Group 16, and Te
is third highest in the column at 190 kJ  mol21 (1.96 eV). The ground-state
electronic configurations10 for oxygen and tellurium (O 5 1s2 2s2 2p4; Te 5 [Kr]
4d10 5s2 5p4) both exhibit incomplete p orbitals (np4); a filled p orbital has six elec-
trons. These incomplete p orbitals make chalcogens aggressive oxidizing agents, so
as to close that deficit, namely, achieve a closed np6 (O, n 5 2; Te, n 5 5) orbital.
For technical reasons beyond the scope of this discussion, sulfur, selenium, and tel-
lurium can adopt higher oxidation states. In the case of tellurium in the MSR
experiments conducted at ORNL, Te was found as TeF6, a highly soluble form of a
tellurium fluoride with a formal charge of 1 6. Early MSRE studies demonstrated
the damage that Te inflicted on the inner surfaces of containment materials. In
some cases fissures up to 300 μm deep were produced (Houtzeel and Dyer, 1972;
McCoy, 1978). In a series of investigations, ORNL researchers examined the effects
of TeF6 and TeF6 1 F2 exposure to a number of alloys, the most promising of
which for use in an MSR (at the time) were Nickel 200 (99 1 % pure Ni) and
Monel K-500 (67%Ni, 32.x%Cu, balance other metals); Hastelloy was not included
in these experiments. Both alloys were tested at approximately 500C and for vary-
ing lengths of time. Both were found to have substantial Te-derived corrosion, both
at the surface and intergranularly, although the Monel K-500 less so. One possibil-
ity is that, despite the presence of highly oxidizable Ti and Al in the Monel K-500
in a fluorinating environment such as in the molten-salt bath, the intermetallic,
gamma prime precipitate (Ni3Al/Ti, FCC crystal structure) may assist in corrosion
resistance. When these alloys were exposed to TeF6 and F2, corrosion rates were
reduced. It is possible that this reduction is attributable to F2 being such a strong
oxidizer, thereby maintaining TeF6 in a fully oxidized, 1 6 state.TeF6, the solubi-
lized Te species, was readily reduced when exposed to these and other alloys. In
fact, some metallic Te was detected on the Monel coupons, as well as CuTe. When
investigated under x-ray crystallography, NiTe2, NiTe and NiF2 were all found in
varying amounts on each coupon, supporting typical chalcogenic behavior where a
Ch prefers a formal charge of 2 2. Cu2-xTe was also found on the Monel K-500, as
would potentially have been predicted, given the percent balance that Cu makes as
the Monel alloy. Cu2-x may also have been a logical prediction as a mixed system,
given Cu’s two oxidation states. This was, in part, because Te, like O, Se, S, all pre-
fer a Ch22 (Ch 5 chalcogen) state, to close that p orbital. With this in mind, Te22

then becomes stable and a much less aggressive oxidizer, given the high electron
affinity11 of 190 kJ  mol21 (1.96 eV), but at a cost of taking those two electrons
from a Lewis base—among other species in the bath, the metal containment wall of
the MSR. While the basicity explains the reactivity towards metals, the tellurium
also has an affinity for grain boundaries in the alloy materials, and the mechanism
of embrittlement has been shown to involve a decohesion effect, similar to the phe-
nomenon of liquid metal embrittlement (Hemsworth et al., 1990; Vˇsianska and ˇSob,
2011; Lu et al., 2016). Given that tellurium has a melting point B450C, it is
highly likely that the tellurium embrittlement mechanism involves the formation of
2-D phases along grain boundaries with weak resistance to mechanical separation,
potentially related to the NiTex phases observed crystallographically (Jia et al.,
2013).
Two solutions that ORNL researchers discovered were to (1) maintain a 95%/
5% ratio of UF4/UF3, which engendered an overall reducing environment for the
bath and (2) add small amounts of Nb to the containment materials. Addition of Nb
suppressed the oxidizing behavior of Te by reducing the species to Te22 because
Nb can stably oxidize to a 15 state, thereby affording a sacrificial electron sink
without substantial materials changes in the bulk. The second was to maintain a
reducing environment in the bath, which will be discussed in more detail further
(Houtzeel and Dyer, 1972; McCoy, 1972; McCoy, 1978; Discussions with Richard
Engel, 2nd time, 2013). Interestingly, niobium has also been shown to assist in the
protection of zirconium-based alloys used in nuclear fuel element cladding with
regards to embrittlement attack by iodine (produced radiolytically in the nuclear
fuel element itself) (Edsinger and Murty, 2001).
With U being the most prevalent element, it is very reasonable that this rather
precise measure of control can be effected. Because of this fortunate fact, one possi-
ble scenario behind the electronic reduction of Te (of which several can be con-
strued) is offered below. It focuses on the redox interplay between neutral UFx
species (x 5 24), and their anions. This scenario has been compiled from informa-
tion found in Thoma (1962), Houtzeel and Dyer (1972), and McCoy (1972).
ORNL investigators maintained a 5% level of UF3 in the bath with UF4 making
up the balance, thereby oxidizing the Te22. ORNL found that this reduces the Te
fission product with two additional electrons to Te22, the more stable anion in com-
parison to either Te0 or Te2.
Since the electrons are coming from the neutral UFx species or its anion
(x 5 24) to afford the electrons necessary, one needs to look at the possible mech-
anism(s) by which the electrons are ceded to Te. Li et al. (2013) proposed that the
stability of the anions UF2
x
(x 5 24) lies along the following spectrum (see
below), with UF2
2 being the most stable. This series is an estimate, based on com-
putationally driven valence shell electron analysis and photoelectron spectroscopy
of the gaseous species, since no other data are available on the molten state
(Mamantov and Manning, 1966; Batista et al., 2004; Hamel et al., 2007; Li et al.,
2013): This is also consistent with ligand field theory. As more molecular orbitals

are involved, the bonds tend to become weaker, because additional electron density
is needed to maintain the covalent bonds.

The ability of an anion to release an electron to achieve a neutral species is
known as the adiabatic detachment energy (ADE) follows a different pattern:
The negative values listed in Fig. 3.16 indicate that the UF2
4 ! UF4 is an exo-
thermic process. Redox reactions are clearly occurring in the absence of an applied
voltage, yet the precise source of the initial electron from some sink is not
completely understood (Mamantov and Manning, 1966; Hamel et al., 2007).
Electrons would be obtained from other ions in the material, ions that have a lower
reduction potential, thus facilitating a redox reaction. Therefore, the electron source
may be a combination species: bridging fluorines (as will very often be the case),
the presence of noble fission products, namely, metals (meaning less fluorine
needed), or spontaneously from a less electronegative species that is soluble and
prefers being a cation (Madden, 2016). Ba Sr, etc., were found, e.g., given the ther-
modynamics of the reaction at these temperatures (Hamel et al., 2007). Some evi-
dence had been detected of Ba and Sr in the graphite and in the sparging gases, due
to their gaseous precursors, but whether they were in the metallic or cationic state
was not discussed, though it is entirely possible that Coulombics from the contain-
ment materials could stabilize cations. Nevertheless, the UF2
4 species ceding the
electron is an exothermic process under reducing conditions such as those
produced.
The 95% UF4 concentration that ORNL researchers maintained could likely be
thought of as a LeChaˆtelier’s principle push to the right. The low concentration of

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

UFx (x 5 2,3), despite the lower exothermicity, may be made up for by the abun-
dance of UF4 in the bath, pushing UF3 toward the anion. Li et al. (2013) had also
reported that the electronic interaction of UF3 and UF2 species is complicated,
highly dynamic and includes two-electron transfers in the transition from UF3 to
UF2 and back (Mamantov and Manning, 1966; Hamel et al., 2007). In this possible
scenario, the reduction of Te appears feasible.
3.4.2
Tritium embrittlement
As is well known, tritium (3H or T) was a continual problem with the MSRE.
Under these extreme conditions, T can exist in a spectrum between cation, a neutral
atom with one electron or the anion, the distinction of which cannot always be
determined. The tritium anion’s precise radius is difficult to quantify. The electron
density of the anion is highly compressible, making quantification of the degree of
covalency difficult to assess.
At MSR temperatures, T is easily formed, is a highly reactive species, and can
attack metals prone to oxidation, forming tritides of the form MTx, where M is the
metal and T is behaving as the anion for the tritide to form. Migration into the walls
ended up either contaminating the heat exchanger loop fluid or, due to the relatively
short half-life (12.3 years), 3He would be formed within the material bulk. Already
described as an “electron sea,” metals take on the electrons, thereby permitting the
newly formed cations to flow freely within the bulk. An obvious, deleterious conse-
quence of this would be internal structural flaws being formed. Internal and external
assault would substantively shorten material lifetime. Tritium embrittlement—an
extension of the well-known concept of hydrogen embrittlement—will also involve
the two mechanisms of embrittlement described in the hydrogen stress-corrosion
cracking literature: these are HEDE (hydrogen enhanced decohesion embrittlement)
and HELP (hydrogen enhanced localized plasticity). In HEDE, hydrogen lowers
the energy required to form a stable crack in the material through surface adsorp-
tion. In HELP, hydrogen interacts with the plastic dislocation fields in the material
to modify the response of the deformation zone in the material to stress (Djukic
et al., 2014).
A wide range of transition metals, including actinides and lanthanides, can all
form tritides of varying Lewis strengths at these temperatures. Subsequent versions
of Hastelloy, for example, contained less Ti, because of its greater capacity to
form TiTx 5 (x $ 3,4) over other metals in the alloy. These same liabilities hold
true for other MSR materials that were considered at the time, particularly those
with attractive neutronic or chemical characteristics such as Zr, Hf, Sc, and V at
high temperatures and bath conditions. The chalcogens all form tritides under these
conditions, ChT2 (Ch 5 S, O, Se, Te), being satisfied in a 2 state with the closed
p-orbital.
Tritium formation was due almost completely to the use of 7LiF-containing
eutectics, with FLiBe being the most popular. The four 9s purity of 7LiF-containing
eutectics still produced an appreciable amount of T (1170Ci/d) via 7Li neutron cap-
ture, almost as much as the errant 6Li (1210Ci/d) that remained in the purified
59
Chemical fundamentals and applications of molten salts

FLiBe (Houtzeel and Dyer, 1972; McCoy, 1978). According to ORNL documents,
only about 19% of the total tritium produced would be removed via helium sparg-
ing (effusing as TF), with the bulk of the remainder unfortunately remaining, diffus-
ing through the containment materials and, most predominantly, through the heat
exchanger walls (Houtzeel and Dyer, 1972; McCoy, 1978; Discussions with
Richard Engel, 2nd time, 2013). One slight advantage of having a reducing UF3
environment in the bath is the production of T2, thereby promoting some removal,
along with Xe, Kr, and other gaseous fission compounds (McCoy, 1972).
Several mechanisms have been proposed to combat tritium migration:
1. UF3 introduction serves dual roles of both Te and T reduction. It should therefore be mon-
itored extremely carefully, and at its maximum level permissible in the bath.
2. Use sodium tetrafluoroborate (NaBF4) in the heat-exchanger loop. This highly water-
soluble salt, which could be introduced into the steam circuit, can irreversibly react with T2
with a high affinity. Operators would have to take every safety measure possible, however,
so as to contain any of the tritiated steam that may emerge as a result of a possible leak.
3. A cooled sink in a coffer tube could electrolytically remove T from the liquid state (T2O
or HTO), offgassing the oxygen.
4. Offload tritiated steam into a sink, cool it to 0C and take advantage of the higher freezing
points of T2O at 4.5C and D2O at 3.8C, with temperature differences of THO, TDO,
and TTO still appreciably different from H2O.
5. If heat exchangers with thinner walls are used, a fourth option may be the installation of sac-
rificial exchangers, whereby parallel heat-exchanger systems are singly operated, permitting
the shutdown of one exchanger loop to replace the other, with de minimus downtime.
Tritium control represents a complex engineering problem, but one that would
certainly prolong the life and profitability of a commercial MSR as a high-
temperature, chemistry production platform.
Many more designs and materials have been investigated over the decades.
Forsberg et al. (2005) listed a few older promising candidates. A more thorough mate-
rials examination of heat exchangers was undertaken by Sridharan et al. in 2008
(Forsberg et al., 2005; Sridharan et al., 2008). The field is changing very rapidly as
the commercial drive for improvement continues. The central question has always
been whether the materials can stand up to prolonged exposure under these extreme
conditions and to minimize corrosion, since it can never be eliminated. Avoiding
embrittlement is also a problem, since the materials choice is so restricted by the oper-
ational environment. Given the small size and odd charge that tritium has, it probably
poses a more vexing challenge than the other forms of systems deterioration.

Ammonia production
In 1910, Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch developed an efficient, high-temperature,
industrial-scale process for ammonia production by reacting hydrogen with nitrogen

under certain conditions. (Haber and Bosch were awarded the Nobel Prize for
Chemistry in 1918 and 1931, respectively.) At 450 million metric tons per year,
ammonia production accounts for 2% of the world’s energy demand, due to its
increasing importance as a raw material for dye stuffs, nylon, nitric acid, and fertilizer
(Nielsen, 1995) (see Fig. 3.17).
The Haber-Bosch process (Figs. 3.17 and 3.18) initially involves a steam reform-
ing stage with methane to produce the hydrogen needed for the primary reaction:

et al., 2004).

With methane (CH4) being the typical commercial feedstock, this equation consti-
tutes the endothermic, first phase of the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process. The product is
called syngas (CO2 1 H2), in reference to the first requisite product produced during
the FT process. Air, composed of 80% N2 and 20% O2, is reacted with hydrogen to
remove the oxygen, producing water and N2 (Eq. 3.2b). Oxygen cannot be present at
more than picoliter levels, as unwanted side reactions occur with it present. After sep-
arating the product gases, a pure stream of H2 and N2 is fed into the primary reactor.
The reactor is heated to approximately 450500C at B20 MPa while in the pres-
ence of a catalyst (often Fe2O3—iron III oxide) and often promoters12, such as alumi-
num III oxide (Al2O3) or “alumina” and potassium oxide (K2O).

The ammonia is then cooled and liquefied for storage and transport. Due to the
exothermicity of reaction 2b (ΔH 5 92 kJ  mol1), some industrial iterations
transport the heat back to earlier stages of the process together with unreacted
hydrogen and nitrogen. The constituent reagents (H2, N2) are reintroduced to the
reaction column for recycling.
Fig. 3.19 depicts the poor yield given the pressure and temperatures involved,
and this same trend is seen in Fig. 3.12: green curves are at B20 MPa and purple
curves are at B400 KPa; the increase in yield is evident (Nielsen, 1995). It appears
from the graph that higher yield is obtainable with lower pressure and higher tem-
perature. This is not the case, however. Fig. 3.18 depicts the mol% yield as a func-
tion of the thermodynamics (Averill and Eldridge, 2014). Eqs. 3.2a and 3.2b both
reflect the fact that these reactions are actually in equilibrium (note the double
arrows) and do not go to completion as is typically thought of in chemistry.
Reagents and products, therefore, have to be managed to produce an optimum yield,
where pressure and temperature are the primary physics tools at hand. This entails
“pushing the reaction to the right,” by employing LeChaˆtelier’s principles to effect
changes in concentration, temperature, or pressure (in this case, volume is fixed).
The boiling point of ammonia (33C) is higher than that of hydrogen (252C)
or nitrogen (196C). Ammonia can then be continuously removed in liquid form.
This is LeChaˆtelier’s principle in practice (lowering concentration of a product)
making additional production possible.
12 Promoter: A compound that, in itself, is not a catalyst. It assists the catalyst on a molecular level,
facilitating (and accelerating) catalytic activity. The electronic interactions and precise mechanism(s)
that occur between the catalyst and promoter vary, depending on the promoter. All catalysts and
promoters are polycrystalline materials, usually prepared in a fashion to maximize surface area.

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

From Figs. 3.16, 3.17,and 3.18, several heating stages exist as opportunities for
an MSR thermal platform to support their operation. On industrial scales, an MSR
would also simultaneously serve as an electrical source needed for such extensive
transport, at pressure, of the reagents and products involved. Heat exchangers can
transport the residual salt temperature of between 400C and 600C and could
either assist in the steam reforming process or supply the entire heat energy
required for the primary reaction in the “heater” stage. Excess heat to bring second-
ary loops from the heat exchangers can be shuttled to several places where needed:
Fig. 3.17A, B, C, E, respectively: FT-driven syngas production, namely, steam ref-
ormation (A, B), separator (C), and heater (E). It is significant to note that MSRs
can be scaled to fit the needs of the industrial process. This feature would be attrac-
tive to any industrial effort. Capital expenditure (CAPEX) can be amortized over
long periods and operational expenditure (OPEX) would most likely be under con-
tract with the company that owns the MSR. In this fashion, corporate liability is
minimized between both parties.
Nielsen provides a more thorough treatment of the thermodynamics, interactions
of crystalline catalytic materials, and the equilibrium management techniques
involved in industrial-scale ammonia production (Averill and Eldridge, 2014).
3.5.2
Hydrogen production
3.5.2.1
Hydrogen derived from fossil fuels
Hydrogen has long been suggested as a suitable alternative energy carrier in the
proposed “hydrogen economy” (Turner and 1999, 2004; US Department of Energy
Figure 3.19 Pressuretemperatureyield graph for products and reagents in the Haber
process (Averill and Eldridge, 2014).
63
Chemical fundamentals and applications of molten salts

and Office of Basic Energy Sciences, 2004; The Hydrogen Economy, 2004).
Although the most plentiful element in the universe, hydrogen on planets is seques-
tered within crystals, organic matter, and water and never found in elemental form.
Currently, 96% of the world’s hydrogen is commercially produced via steam
reforming from natural gas (Olah et al., 2009). As mentioned above, this is, again,
the FT method for production of syngas. The process typically employs a nickel-
based catalyst, which converts methane into the desired products at approximately
500C (the top process seen in Fig. 3.18). As with FT, the product stream is then
recirculated to produce additional hydrogen and carbon dioxide.
While steam reforming is an established process reaching efficiencies of 80%,
fuel combustion and cement manufacture alone produced slightly more than nine
billion tons of CO2 in 2010 (Peters et al., 2012). Emissions of CO2 in 2007
amounted to 29.7 Gt  year21, with FT-derived CO2 making up a significant fraction
of that (Maitlis and de Klerk, 2013).
3.5.2.2
Hydrogen derived from electrolysis
Water electrolysis presents a clean alternative to steam reforming, producing zero
greenhouse gases and supplying 4% of the world’s hydrogen (Fig. 3.20). Currently,
water electrolysis is tasked with supplying high-purity hydrogen for high-end appli-
cations such as rocket fuel. Although the process is efficient, it is expensive and
traditionally involves a platinum catalyst.
As can be seen in Fig. 3.20, electrolytic reduction of water demands a substantial
energy commitment as can be seen in the reduction potentials13. One advantage of
this method, however, lies in the extremely high purity of the hydrogen produced
(99.999%). Rocket fuels and the entire petroleum refinement industry both require
high-purity hydrogen. The petroleum industry dominates the total annual consump-
tion of hydrogen at 351 million m3  year21 (Maitlis and de Klerk, 2013; Hydrogen
for Refineries, 2016). As an electrical platform, an MSR is well suited to the high-
energy demands of electrolytic reduction of hydrogen, given the purportedly low
cost of energy production (B0.02 b  kwh21; this number is highly debated). This
number is based on several cost estimates found in modern, nonacademic works.

3.5.2.3
Thermochemically derived hydrogen
Several means of liberating hydrogen have been discovered and modified through-
out the decades. As the name implies, however, they all require a heat source. This
process often involves redox. The thermochemical production of hydrogen is seen
to have the advantages of high efficiency, zero greenhouse gas emissions, and rela-
tively pure hydrogen output.
Several proposed cycles are summarized in Fig. 3.21 and generally operate between
500C and 800C (Kodama and Gokon, 2007). Nuclear heat sources are attractive for
high, continuous, emissions-free heat with available, continuous voltage and current
(Yalcuu¨cin et al., 1989). See Fig. 3.22 for a good example of heat demand to effect
hydrogen liberation. Research began in earnest for the HTGR (high-temperature gas
reactor) as an effective heat source for thermochemical reactions. The HTGR preceded
the restart of MSR research (Yalcu¨cin, 1989; Nelson et al., 2007).
Hundreds of investigations on these materials and many others, and variations
therein have been conducted over the decades. As noted in Fig. 3.21, almost all pro-
cesses involve an initial thermochemical step, followed by or included with one or
more redox reactions14, namely, many are also electrochemically driven (Maitlis
and de Klerk, 2013). Examples of reduction potentials are found in Fig. 3.20.
3.5.3
Catalytic cracking
Catalytic cracking is arguably the most important, high-temperature hydrocarbon
chemistry performed (http://www.digitalrefining.com/article/1000787,Naphtha_catalytic_
Figure 3.21 General description of some select thermochemical systems.
14 Redox reaction: A method of representing the simultaneous oxidation and reduction of compounds,
such that the target species is reduced to elemental form. In the cases illustrated here, as well as in
classic examples, redox reactions involve electron transfer according to the following mnemonic: OIL
RIG: oxidation is loss; reduction is gain. Since hydrogen almost always exists as a cation (H 1 ), the
goal is to reduce hydrogen to its diatomic, elemental form (H2), thereby requiring two electrons to
complete the single valence shell.

and

The consumer, commercial and industrial significance of this process is the pro-
duction of carbon 5 carbon double bonds, marked “a” and “b” in Fig. 3.23 and can-
not be understated. These double bonds are formed during the cracking process.
The compounds serve as the precursors to the well-known polymers polypropylene
and polyethylene and the scores of variants thereafter, and the polymerization
stems from the presence of the double bonds. Fig. 3.21 shows the top 10 ethylene
producers, amounting to 1.4 3 107 ton year21 (Fig. 3.24).
The chemical reduction of the carboncarbon single bond to double bonds
(recall that reduction is a gain of electrons) requires a high endotherm (400C) to
effect this chemistry. Cracking requires catalysis and, like thermochemical means
of hydrogen production, hundreds of catalytic candidate variants have been investi-
gated over the decades. Some representative catalysts are zeolite-HZSM-5, zeolite-
Y, and mordenite. Most used on an industrial scale are the zeolite class of catalytic
compounds and other types of naturally occurring minerals, which all share similar
crystallographic elements. Appearing cage-like on the crystallographic level, zeolite
chemistry occurs on the inside and edges of the cage. Intense spectroscopic methods
are used to identify the many changes that occur to the complex crystallographic
unit cell as a result of researchers’ efforts to improve catalytic efficiency, but these
changes present new characterization challenges. Changing the ratio of key
elements, for example, Si-Al, slightly alters the Madelung and lattice energy

parameters, and the Lewis acidity of the system. Slight changes are then seen by
primary investigative tools such as x-ray crystallography, but the low symmetry of
the space group (hence, a complicated spectrum) makes interpretation difficult. So,
too, does particle size; much research has been carried out on nanoscale zeolite
crystals.

Chemical fundamentals and applications of molten salts

Thus, MSRs can be used to facilitate high-temperature production of ammonia,
hydrogen, ethylene, and other valuable chemical products. They can also help
destroy long-lived nuclear waste products, such as actinides and lanthanides, Ac
through Lr.
3.6
Actinide burning
3.6.1
Historical context
The destruction of actinides left over from used fission reactor fuel elements (or, var-
iations thereof, such as the MAGNOX assemblies), has been practiced for decades.
Initial burning, followed by recycling of remaining isotopes for reuse constitutes a
“closed cycle,” whereas single use, followed by storage is called “open cycle.”
Historically, closed-cycle practice initially meant the harvesting of 239Pu and other
actinides for the purposes of nuclear weapons production during the Cold War. The
“123-Agreement” signatories now reprocess fuel for the costbenefit value of
enriched-fuel recovery and reuse of 235U and 239Pu (see Fig. 3.23) (Werner, 2012).
Besides fuel, valuable isotopes are also harvested and used for nonmilitary purposes.
Over the last 1520 years, the United States has produced a large, in-depth data-
base of topics regarding spent nuclear fuel (SNF) for its 102 light-water reactors
(LWRs) (http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/nuregs/public-pass-nuregs.
html; Rosenthal et al., 1971; Croff et al., 2008; OECD and NEA, 2007; Werner,
2012; Martinez-Guridi et al., 2013). This is mostly to address the 67,000 tons of
SNF in the United States, having been amassed since the imposition of the Single-
Use Rule (Thoma, 1971; Carter, 1977; Martinez, 2002; Mah et al., 2004). Notably
absent, however, are any decisive conclusions, explicit policy recommendations or
Congressional action for SNF reprocessing, due to de facto Congressional adher-
ence of the Single Use Rule (Thoma, 1971; Carter, 1977).
Single Use Rule: Synopsis
One of President Jimmy Carter’s first actions in office was to conduct a
thorough review of American nuclear policy. His stance on the prohibition of
reprocessing as one means of eliminating nuclear proliferation took the form of a
seven-point plan where he outlined the cessation of the practice (Carter, 1977). As
a result, President Carter vetoed S. 1811, The Energy Research and Development
Authorization Act (Martinez, 2002). The review paper, combined with the veto of S.
1811, came to be known as the Single Use Rule.
3.6.2
Fluoride preprocessing and SNF fission for an MSR
Actinide fission of weapons-grade materials has already been demonstrated in the
early 1970s (Trevorrow et al., 1968). MSRs as actinide burners can accommodate
many types of fuels, due to the liquid core. The amount of SNF that could be
68
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

introduced into the fuel depends on nuclear chemistry, with neutronic cross-sections
limiting the rates. MOX ceramic fuels must be processed to remove the oxygen,
since it would contaminate the fluoride chemistry. The predominant transuranic
metal oxides often found in MOX fuels, NpO2 (a minor actinide produced), UO2,
PuO2 (and ThO2 if used), all being in the 14 oxidation state, would remain insolu-
ble and form a solid solution within the bulk core (Trevorrow et al., 1968; Thoma,
1971).
The most common oxidizing agent is anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (HF) in gas-
eous form for the actinide oxides (Katz and Rabinowitch, 1951; Kim and Campbell,
1985; Asprey et al., 1986). The comparatively aggressive fluorine peroxide (F2O2)
in a BrF3/BrF5 bath at ambient temperatures is also attractive, but challenging to
handle (Katz and Rabinowitch, 1951). These methods, however, are relatively non-
selective. Moderate-temperature fluorination of NpO2, UO2, and PuO2 ($400C)
with hazardous materials such as fluorine gas (F2), or anhydrous HF had been regu-
larly practiced for MOX conversion to hexafluorides in preparation for subsequent
oxidation and deposition of the solid tetrafluoride salts. Methods employing KrF2 in
an argon bath also present desirable properties, in that they fluorinate the target
actinides far below room temperature (Katz and Rabinowitch, 1951; Asprey et al.,
1986). The difficulty arises in the precise control needed to fluorinate and segregate
at such low temperatures (76C). However, practical dangers associated with the
handling of F2, anhydrous HF, and KrF2 make their use suboptimal (Katz and
Rabinowitch, 1951; Kim and Campbell, 1985; Asprey et al., 1986). Furthermore,
the nonselectivity is due to the similarity of volatilization temperatures of the three
tetrafluorides to their hexafluoride forms.
Perhaps the most desirable oxidizing agent studied is nitrogen trifluoride (NF3)
(Kim and Campbell, 1985; McNamara et al., 2011). Broad, thermal oxidation
conditions are obviously the most practical methods for large-scale, simultaneous
oxidation and segregation of the actinide oxides into their fluoride salts. This obvi-
ously holds true for the major transuranics, given their extensive and lucrative utility
after harvesting. Thermal differences between oxidation of NpO2, UO2, and both the
α and ß forms of U3O8 may be substantial enough to selectively segregate the resul-
tant compounds, having driven them to their 16 oxidation states (their gaseous
forms). Notably, Pu conversion does not occur with this method (Kim and Campbell,
1985; McNamara et al., 2011). This same process using NF3 holds true for TeO2,
MoO2, RuO2, and TcO2 to the exclusion of lanthanides and RhO2, but only partially
toward Nb2O3, which forms oxyfluorides, meaning that it subsequently has to be fur-
ther processed to yield the NbF5 (Kim and Campbell, 1985; McNamara et al., 2011).
Decades of research have resulted in a number of fundamental extraction meth-
ods, followed by scores of variations and improvements to target specific transura-
nics. Efficiency has increased steadily throughout the years, although the processes
are usually multistage, often require large volumes of chemicals that are difficult to
synthesize, and require high-concentration nitric acid to break down the MOX oxi-
des. Asprey et al. and other groups went on to develop more direct methods using
fluoride-based actinide extraction (Katz and Rabinowitch, 1951; Trevorrow et al.,
1968; Thoma, 1971; Kim and Campbell, 1985; Asprey et al., 1986; McNamara
69
Chemical fundamentals and applications of molten salts

et al., 2011). Following dissolution with concentrated nitric acid, tributyl phosphate
(TBP) in an aqueous medium is usually used for segregation of transuranics from
other fission products. Almost all extraction methods rely on organometallic chem-
istry. One of the first extraction methods developed, dubbed PUREX (Plutonium
Uranium Redox EXtraction), involves aqueous forms of Pu and U prepared in
the 16 oxidation state: UO21
2
and PuO21
2 . To achieve neutrality, the 16 oxidation
state has to be satisfied with some sort of molecular configuration that offsets
the 6 requirement. This is achieved by a combination of nitrate (NO2
3 ), water
(H2O), and TBP (C12H27O4P), often with several other complementary compounds
that selectively target specific cations based on charge and size in the extract. The
raffinate is often further processed to selectively sequester and isolate various
cations. The preferred solvent for the PUREX process, and many other extraction
methods (though not all), is the nonpolar liquid kerosene. See Fig. 3.25 for a gen-
eral overview of some techniques. In a challenging series of chemical steps, the
compounds above ultimately form a hydrophobic complex with the transuranic spe-
cies at its center, ending up in a relatively large and unusual molecular geometry.
The now hydrophobic complexes then drop out of aqueous solution and are solubi-
lized in the nonpolar kerosene solvent. Depending on the method, molecular bonds
formed around species are stronger than bonds formed by other species, but only
weakly so (lanthanides vs. actinides, or vice versa, depending on reagents). As with
all the methods listed, both raffinates and extracts, are put through multiple cycles
to increase concentration, selectivity, and purity.

and/or lanthanide extraction. †, y 5 respective processes run sequentially.

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

Notably, much time and effort has been devoted to the extraction of Am. As can
be seen in Fig. 3.26, Am is a long-lived isotope with a high activity. Recent
advances in room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs), have demonstrated higher
selectivity for Am (Ouadi et al., 2006).
Pyroprocessing is the electrochemical deposition of reduced metals on electrodes
in a molten-salt bath. It has been studied for decades in many countries as a near
ideal choice for the separation of actinides from other fission products, but it has
only recently been implemented commercially. In the United States, it was success-
fully used for the experimental breeder reactor (EBR II) operated at “Argonne
West,” now called Idaho National Laboratories (INL) (Westfall, 2004; IAEA-
TECDOC-1531, 2006).
Actinides as a group are all simultaneously reduced to their respective metals at
the cathode in the molten-salt bath, such as for use in an integral fast reactor (IFR).
If desired, the actinides can subsequently be isolated, purified, and recycled to
achieve near complete burn up in the IFR. This process is called “partitioning and
transmutation (P&T).” The cladding and other fission products with significant dif-
ferences in reduction potentials, such as Cs and Sr, and most lanthanides remain
solubilized in the bath. Despite its proliferation resistance (all actinides are simulta-
neously reduced) and “once through” methodology, this particular method is the
only one to have been licensed for large-scale use in the United States.
It was used successfully to process 21 metric tons of SNF during the 30-year life-
span of the EBR II, yet has never been used elsewhere in the United States (Westfall,
2004; IAEA-TECDOC-1531, 2006). In the IFR method, a molten-chloride bath
LiKCl2 (LiCl 1 KCl) is prepared and the raw, cladded SNF is deposited into the
bath, where the electrometallurgic process takes place. Although historically the
LiKCl2 combination has been used, FLiCa [LiCaF3 (LiF 1 CaF2)] can be substituted.

products (Aneheim, 2012).

Chemical fundamentals and applications of molten salts

Many countries have had pyroelectrochemical research programs. See Fig. 3.27
for a list of some facilities around the world. All groups employ a sequential,
electrochemical-bath process (IAEA-TECDOC-1531, 2006). Russia has had a con-
tinuous program since the 1970s called the RIAR, where they have also made sub-
stantial strides in pyrochemical methods (Demjanowich, 1982; Bychkov and Skiba,
2005). They run their molten-chloride salt temperature at 630C, similar to other
groups, but they use a blend of different salts (Demjanowich, 1982; Bychkov and
Skiba, 2005). The National Research Institute (NRI) in Rez, Czech Republic, had
worked previously with the Soviet Union to begin development of pyroprocesing of
SNF (Uhlı´ˇr et al., 2007; Souˇcek et al., 2011). Dr. Uhlı´ˇr and his team continued
toward closing MOX fuel cycles with pyroprocessing in largely fluoride-based
baths, FLiNaK, FLiBe, and FLiCa (Uhlı´ˇr et al., 2007; Souˇcek et al., 2011; Actinide
and Fission Product Partitioning and Transmutation, 2013). The actinides are
intended for later use in an MSR. The Institute for Transuranium Elements (ITU) is
a consortium of EU countries located in Karlsruhe, Germany. Russia, South Korea,
and Japan are now using NPPs with integrated pyrometallurgic techniques. All three
countries rely on some variant of the LiCl 1 KCl or LiCl 1 Li2O molten-salt bath
Figure 3.27 A current list of countries that reprocess spent nuclear fuel (SNF).

components. Pyroprocessing is being integrated into the GE-Hitachi Power Reactor
Innovative Small Module (PRISM), for example, a MOX SMR with the on-board
Advanced Recycling Centre (ARC) (U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 1994;
Triplett et al., 2012). South Korea has spent considerable time perfecting their
Korean Advanced Processing Facility (KAPF), in conjunction with the US-led,
International Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (Sheen, 2011; Yang, 2012). Their
research has paid off, having reached a 95%99% actinide group recovery effi-
ciency in their once-through cycle (Yang, 2012; Lee et al., 2013). The proliferation
resistance, therefore, lies in the extremely high temperatures and radiological condi-
tions of the reduced actinide metals on the cathode, which are nonsegregated, hence
retarding weaponization.
Thus, actinides that are considered waste products from LWRs can be repro-
cessed and burned in MSRs, providing a good source of fissile materials for MSR
startup. MSRs can also be used as neutron sources to produce medical isotopes.
3.7
Medical isotopes
The overwhelming majority (about 80%) of medical radioisotopic testing uses
technitium
(99mTc),
the
metastable
isomer
(also
called
a
shape
isomer,
m 5 metastable) decay product of 99Mo (Hore-Lacy, 2012). The utility of 99mTc
to emit a low-energy (B140 KeV) gamma can be detected from the patient via an
ex situ gamma camera. A second metastable isomer, 95mTc, is also used as a yield
tracer in tandem with the
99mTc, but is produced by bombardment of 93Nb.
Although most often used as a method for cardiac perfusion efficiency, techne-
tium studies can be used to investigate bone, distal vasculature, and cerebral per-
fusion. Fig. 3.28 depicts the isotopes that can be directly harvested from an MSR
(Houtzeel and Dyer, 1972; Carrigan et al., 2015). Several isotopes can be

those that naturally absorb neutrons, such as 125Xe into 125I. The list is long, so
only a restricted set is presented here.

Desalination
3.8.1
Context
The greatest need for all animal and plant species is freshwater. Eighty percent of
human body mass is water, with typical urine production being prolific at the rate
of 500 μL  m21. A human can, on average, survive for 30 days without food, but
only 3 days without water. It is therefore essential for all life to have easy access to
water for survival, sanitary reasons, and crop production. Water scarcity has proven
very difficult to quantify, because of the myriad factors that go into determining
whether or not a person, people, nation, or region are actually water-deprived
(Falkenmark et al., 1989). Water scarcity is sometimes quantified by the availability
of water for crop growth, but this does not accurately define the adequacy of water
supply for human consumption (Frenken and Gillet, 2012).
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has focused on water scarcity
for a number of years now, highlighting the substantial cost advantages of nuclear
energy over fossil fuels and renewable energy resources. Two software platforms
regarding variable identification and quantification were introduced by the IAEA in
the Desalination Economic Evaluation Program (DEEP), current release, v.5.1 and
Desalination Thermodynamic Optimization Program (DE-TOP), in beta release,
v.2.0 (International Atomic Energy Agency, 2000; IAEA-TECDOC-1524, 2007;
IAEA-TECDOC-1753, 2015). The IAEA also helps member states use nuclear tech-
nology to monitor water flows in the environment (isotope hydrology).
Capital-cost calculations, and not peoples’ demands, drive desalination (Zhou
and Tol, 2006; http://idadesal.org/desalination-101/desalination-by-the-numbers/).
Construction, maintenance, improvement, and capacity increase must all add up to
demonstrable and continued revenues. Governments in some countries provide
financial support, without which commercially funded construction would be unfea-
sible (International Atomic Energy Agency, 2000; Zhou and Tol, 2006; IAEA-
TECDOC-1524, 2007; Lattemann and Ho¨pner, 2008; IAEA-TECDOC-1753, 2015;

Desalination plant types
Four different types of desalination plants may be used:
1. Multistage flash (MSF);
2. Multieffect distillation (MED);
3. Reverse osmosis (RO);
4. Electrodialysis (ED).
74
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

Both MSF and MED rely on thermal energy to boil off the water, leaving total
dissolved solids/salts (TDS) behind. RO is driven by electricity used for pumping
water at ambient or slightly elevated temperature, but at high pressure, through
semipermeable membranes. The ED method is based on a combination of ionic
conductivity and semipermeable membranes that can actively segregate cations and
anions, so long as charge neutrality is maintained. Heat production is much less
expensive than electricity production. Historically, MED and MSF have been used
because of high and fluctuating fuel costs making electricity production for many
nations prohibitively expensive. Over the past decades, however, technology
advances in both electricity production and semipermeable membranes, have made
RO plants much more efficient than MED or MSF.
3.8.3
Global reliance on desalinated water and the nuclear role
As of 2015, approximately 86 million m3  day21 of desalinated water was pro-
duced, where approximately 150 countries now employ some desalination (http://
idadesal.org/desalination-101/desalination-by-the-numbers/; Lattemann and Ho¨pner,
2008). These are surreal numbers. As depicted in Fig. 3.29, as of 2007, three

regions rely heavily on desalination and make up the majority (76%) of world
capacity (Lattemann and Ho¨pner, 2008). Most notably, these (semi)developed
regions have access to ample capital, which can be raised via typical investment
instruments or internally funded by stable, well-capitalized, governments.
As predicted by Avrin et al. (2015), the production rate will climb by 2030, as
China alone is predicted to bring another 23.1 million m3 of fresh water capacity
online, with results generated by the DEEP and DE-TOP software suites (International
Atomic Energy Agency, 2000; Zhou and Tol, 2006; IAEA-TECDOC-1524, 2007;
Lattemann and Ho¨pner, 2008; IAEA-TECDOC-1753, 2015; http://idadesal.org/desali-
nation-101/desalination-by-the-numbers/). Most of that desalinated water capacity will
probably be driven by nuclear energy, as forecast by this IAEA-sponsored techno-
economic study (Lattemann and Ho¨pner, 2008; Avrin et al., 2015).
To date, several nuclear facilities with specific design for desalination have been
planned. Fig. 3.29 depicts the reactor type, country, and status of the effort
(Lattemann and Ho¨pner, 2008).
As concisely stated by the IAEA in TECDOC-1524, reproduced in the bullet
points shown below, small modular reactors (SMRs) are highlighted as a viable
alternative to the NPPs that have been used as desalination plant energy sources for
the following reasons (Glasser and Zucker, 1980; IAEA-TECDOC-1524, 2007):
G
SMRs have lower investment costs;
G
Almost all SMR concepts appear to show increased availability ($90%);
G
Because of inherent safety features, most SMRs have good potential for location near pop-
ulation centers, hence lowering the transport costs.
In addition to Figs. 3.29 and 3.30, Argentina, Egypt, Israel, Korea, Morocco,
Tunisia, and the United States have completed IAEA-supported techno-economic fea-
sibility studies, including the United States inclusion of Gen IV SMRs in their techno-
economic study (IAEA-TECDOC-1524, 2007). As of 2012, the Kalpakkam NPP, also
called MAPS (Madras Atomic Power Station) has been desalinating 4500 m3 day21 of
water in a small, hybrid (MSF/RO) demonstration plant (IAEA-TECDOC-1524, 2007;
Figure 3.30 Breakdown of desalination production by contiguous region (Lattemann and

3.8.4
Comparison of nuclear versus renewables for desalination
One study employing the DEEP software package found that nuclear was cost-
competitive in comparison to fossil fuels if costs centered on the lower end of the
$0.401.90 m23 range. As an electrical generation platform, nuclear-driven RO
desalination was superior to fossil fuel-driven systems. In version 5.1, the DEEP
software package has also been used to quantify the purported costs associated
with desalination using nuclear versus either solar thermal (thermal distillation)
and
PV-driven
desalination
(International
Atomic
Energy
Agency,
2000).
Nuclear-driven electrical methods (RO) and overall cost  kWhe
21 are more cost-
competitive than PV, being only a fraction per m3, as depicted in Fig. 3.32A and
C (International Atomic Energy Agency, 2000). High CAPEX/OPEX and

decommissioning costs may partially explain a smaller difference between nuclear
and thermal in Fig. 3.32B.
If conditions are nearly ideal throughout the year, renewables can succeed in
large-scale desalination plants. Although not representative of a sample size,
Australia has had a successful track record with wind- or solar-supported desalina-
tion plants.
Of all desalination plants, the six largest in Australia are the following: Kurnell
(Sydney), Wonthaggi (Victoria), Tugun (Gold Coast), Port Stanvac (Adelaide),
Kwinana, (Perth), and Binningup (Southern). Five of the six (Tugun, Kurnell,
Wonthaggi, Kwinana, and Binningup) claim wind as the offset. Kwinana claims
solar, wind, and wave as the power sources and successfully powers their plant on
100% renewables (Bennet, 2011; Crisp, 2012). Kwinana has received accolades and
some international recognition for its successes. The high costs associated with
these renewable projects, however (all six went over budget) stemmed from the
unique designs and accommodating the different geographies that each plant
demanded in order to fully exploit the renewable energy resources.
3.8.5
Nuclear versus renewables financial perspective
What appears to be the most in-depth, comprehensive, comparative analysis to-date
is contained within Appendix II of IAEA TECDOC-1753 (IAEA-TECDOC-1753,
2015). This document provides an insight into the complex financial analysis on
whether to undertake large, nuclear-driven desalination projects.
Financial analysts use the term maximum possible production (MPP) or the
“supply side” of electricity production for a parameterized MOX NPP (red lines in
Fig. 3.30). For the “demand side” they define “net present value (NPV)” as the
value at the present time of a sum of money, in contrast to some future value that
same sum will have when invested at compound interest. This definition implies
the confluence of Riemannian sums, because many factors (obsolescence, lifespan,
individual OPEX, etc.) must be included. Additional abstract economic terms are
also included, such as capital depreciation cost per unit time, CAPEX resources and
the forms therein (governmental grants, equity apportionment; partial versus nondi-
lutive funding, publicprivate partnerships, other debt instruments, etc.). The thor-
ough development of financial factors that impact the nuclear industry is helpful:
operational life of the plant, decommissioning costs, fuel costs for both open- and
closed-cycle runs, and the net-profit, loss, and break-even points, as adjusted for
electricity production costs.
As can be seen in Fig. 3.33, only when MPP exceeds NPV (region B) does the
project become profitable. Efficiencies are realized in the slightly sloping MPP curve
as output increases, dropping off to zero when the total capacity for the plant has
been reached—approximately 630,000 m3  day21 in this model. The change in slope
for NPV would be based on a number of factors. For example, changes in fixed
costs, excess (and vendible) electricity and/or power, positive changes in supply
costs would all affect the NPV curve in different ways.

Chemical fundamentals and applications of molten salts

3.9
Optical applications
The transparency of some salts, such as NaCl, KBr, LiF, and BeF2, suggests that
some of the fission fragment energy and beta decay energy might be used to gener-
ate light (infrared, visible, or ultraviolet) emission from the liquid MSR, provided
adequate, purpose-specific intensity were achieved. The light waves could stimulate
laser beam emission from an appropriate solid, liquid, or gas in a separate chamber
or within the molten salt. A high-power, steady-state laser beam could have many
potential uses, including:
G
Mining, tunneling, and excavating through rock;
G
Cutting and welding large items, such as ships;
G
Power beaming to satellites and space craft;
G
Space debris removal;
G
Propelling 1-kg payloads into orbit;
G
Additive manufacturing large items;
and others. A new book on nuclear pumped lasers (NPLs) discusses “nuclear optical
convertors,” but does not mention molten salt reactors as an energy source
(Melnikov et al., 2015).
3.10
Summary and conclusions
The chemical and physical properties of salts are well known and suited to indus-
trial applications: nearly isochoric, effective heat capacity and heat-transfer coeffi-
cients; and satisfactory viscosity. For industrial-scale chemical applications a
high-temperature heat source with very small CO2 emissions is desirable. The
MSR high-temperature secondary coolant salt can be transported to several uses

simultaneously, such as electrical power, chemical synthesis, and desalination.
MSRs are scalable to meet a broad range of industrial and governmental goals,
while avoiding the high pressures and chemical reactivities associated with other
reactors.
Crystalline properties directly impact the change from the solid to the liquid
phase. Dynamic management of the primary loop chemistry, therefore, affects the
thermodynamics of both the primary and secondary loops. Phenomena such as crys-
talline polymers and bridging halogens connecting metal centers exist in both the
solid and liquid phases, so knowledge of the solid state will benefit those working
on heat exchanger design.
Covalent bonding may play a less substantial role in the solid state, especially at
high Z. Solid state lanthanide salts belong to similar space groups as a result of
their electronic valence and are predominantly ionic. Pure lanthanide salts modeled
in the liquid state display higher variability in their bonding, due to more influence
of covalent forces. The bonding between the halogen and the metal center(s) that
constitute the anions (e.g., LnF632, BeF422, etc.) are almost completely covalent.
Modeling of working MSR fluids is lacking, so more complex interactions, such as
heterogeneous n-mers based on both ionic and covalent interactions are possible,
which could yield more complex and loosely bound ionic species. Changes that
occur as a result of the nuclear events within the primary loop can impact the sec-
ondary loop.
MSRs can serve as compact, reliable remote power sources for terrestrial and
space applications, such as water supply, mining, navigation, communications,
space propulsion, on-board power, colonies, and manufacturing on the moon and on
Mars, using materials available there, such as CO2.
New molten salt heat exchangers are needed, but design is difficult. Engineers
need to account for molten salt chemistry, phase change(s), density changes, viscosity
changes, corrosion, radiation damage, fission product effects, precipitation, recrystalli-
zation, tritium transport, thermal stress, creep, radioactivity hazard, and other issues.
Molten salt reactors can reduce fossil fuel use by providing economical energy
to high-temperature (600800C) industrial applications in metallurgy, cement,
and chemical manufacturers, such as hydrogen production, ammonia, and polymers.
Advances in chemistry can facilitate a broader range of applications: ionic
liquids, deep eutectics, self-assembly materials, carbon fiber and composites, carbon
nanotubes, metallic foams and glasses, and many others.
Liquid fuel MSRs can burn many fuels, including long-lived actinides present in
used LWR fuels. The “radioactive waste” could become a fuel, instead of being a
hazard requiring expensive geological disposal for millennia. Methods for proces-
sing fuels are well developed, including PUREX and pyroprocessing. MOX ceramic
fuels must be processed to remove the oxygen, since it would contaminate the
halide salt and affect the neutronics.
Several countries are harvesting the minor actinides, many of which are high-
value materials (both commercially and for research use) using nonnuclear, molten-
salt techniques. MSRs can provide medical isotopes from fission products, from
their irradiation by neutrons, and from irradiation of target materials. Molten salts
81
Chemical fundamentals and applications of molten salts

can be used to break down spent MOX fuel into harvestable elements or isotopic
compounds, based on decades of research.
The high thermal density of MSRs can facilitate both thermal and reverse-
osmotic methods of desalination. MSRs can act as both electrical and thermal
sources to produce water via both methods. MSRs could provide large quantities of
fresh water reliably, regardless of the weather. Software packages have been devel-
oped to calculate desalination costs, with inputs of salinity, raw materials, regional
need, crop production, and other factors.
Regardless of type, nuclear reactors demand long-term planning, called “cradle-
to-grave” planning. Construction of CAPEX and OPEX for MSRs have been esti-
mated by several independent sources to be less expensive than their LWR counter-
parts. Factors contributing to these lowered costs are:
G
Inherent simplicity of design;
G
Passive safety;
G
Lack of fuel rod manufacture and radiation damage limits;
G
Low-pressure, high-temperature, nonexplosive coolant;
G
The ability to burn “radwaste” actinides from LWRs;
G
Molten salt extraction of isotopes for medical and commercial uses.
Thus, MSRs have a wealth of applications in which they are superior to other
energy sources.

4.1
Introduction
Reactor physics provides important information, such as power distribution, effec-
tive multiplication, and fuel composition changes with burnup. This chapter covers
interaction of neutrons with matter, nuclear fission, multiplication factor, neutron
spectrum, reaction rates, transport and diffusion equations of neutrons, criticality
equation, and kinetic equations.
4.2
Interaction of neutrons with matter
Reactions of neutrons with nuclei are broadly classified into two classes, scattering
and capture. In scattering reactions, the final result is merely an exchange
of energy between the two colliding particles, and a neutron remains free after
interaction. On the other hand, in capture reactions, the neutron is retained by the
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-08-101126-3.00004-X

nucleus, forming a different isotope. There are four main kinds of neutron capture
reactions:
1. The emission of gamma radiation ðn; γÞ;
2. The ejection of an alpha particle n; α
ð
Þ;
3. The ejection of a proton ðn; pÞ; or
4. Fission ðn; fÞ.
The radiative capture reaction is the most common, and it occurs with a wide
variety of elements.
When a neutron is absorbed into a nucleus, the kinetic energy and the binding
energy of the neutron are transferred to the compound nucleus, which will be left in
an excited energy state. Part of the energy may be transferred to a neutron, which
may be emitted from the nucleus, leaving the nucleus in a less excited energy state.
This process is called “inelastic scattering” since part of the energy is left as inter-
nal energy of the nucleus.
Another possibility is that a neutron is scattered by a nucleus without changing
nuclear internal energy, which is called “elastic scattering.” The energy of the incom-
ing neutron is distributed between the scattered neutron and the recoil nucleus. It is a
classic hard-sphere collision with conservation of kinetic energy and momentum.
Inelastic scattering can only occur for high-energy neutrons, while elastic scattering
can occur for all neutron energies. The neutron collisions are summarized below:
4.2.1
Several processes can produce neutrons
1. Neutrons are easily obtained by reaction of alpha particles with some light elements, e.g.,
beryllium, boron, or lithium. The alpha-particle emitters may be polomium-210, radium-
226, plutonium-239, or americium-241. These emitters emit alpha-particles according to
their own decay constants. The energy of neutrons released in the (alpha, n) reaction
ranges from about 1 to 10 MeV.
2. The reaction of gamma rays of energy about 2 MeV on the nuclei of deuterium or beryl-
lium yields essentially mono energetic neutrons.
3. Some artificially produced heavy nuclides undergo spontaneous fission, emitting neutrons
at an appreciable rate. Californium-252 decays with a half-life of 2.63 years and 3.1% of
decays are spontaneous fissions.
4. Accelerated ion beams, such as protons or deuterons, bombarding targets such as tritiated
titanium, lithium, or beryllium can yield (p,n) and (d,n) reactions. For example, the
International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility will use 40 MeV deuteron beams with a
flowing lithium target.
5. High-energy accelerators (B1 GeV) striking a heavy metal target, such as Pb, can pro-
duce copious neutrons.
6. Fission reactions usually emit several neutrons.

4.3
Multiplication factor of chain reactions
When fissile nuclei, such as U 233, U-235, and Pu-239, absorb a neutron, the
excited compound nucleus breaks up into two fission products and releases several
high-energy (B1 MeV) neutrons. When one of these neutrons is absorbed in
another fissile nucleus, a chain reaction may begin.
In a hypothetical system of infinite size, neutrons do not leak out of the system.
They are produced by fission and are removed only by absorption in the materials.
The infinite multiplication factor is defined as
kN 5
Neutrons produced in one generation
Neutrons absorbed in the preceding generation 5 Rate of neutron production
Rate of neutron absorption
(4.1)
The condition of criticality for stable self-sustaining fission chain reaction is that
kN 5 1, in an infinite system without external neutron source.
In a system of finite size, some neutrons leak out of the system. The criticality
condition must take into account the neutron leakage. The effective multiplication
factor is given by
keff 5
Rate of neutron production
Rate of neutron absorption 1 neutron leakage
(4.2)
The requirement for criticality in a finite system without external neutron source
is that keff 5 1.
If keff , 1 then the system is subcritical. In such a case the population of neu-
trons will steadily decrease. In the presence of an external neutron source, however,
a steady state can be maintained by the source. When keff . 1, the system is super-
critical. In such a case the neutron production is larger than neutron loss, thus the
population of neutrons will tend to increase exponentially with time. This increase
could cause a nuclear explosion, or it could be limited by use of materials that
absorb neutrons more strongly as they heat up, such as zirconium (or uranium-238).
4.4
Cross-sections
The microscopic cross-section, σ, for a particular reaction applies to a single
nucleus. If the target material contains N nuclei per a unit volume, the quantity
Nσ is called the “macroscopic cross-section Σ” of the material:
Σ 5 Nσ?ðm21Þ,
For a mixture of elements or compounds containing several species the macro-
scopic cross-section is
Σ 5 N1σ1 1 N2σ2 1 . . . 1 Niσi 1 . . .
where the values of N1, N2, etc., are dependent upon the composition of the
mixture, the atomic weights, and densities of the constituents.

Reactor physics of MSR

4.5
Reaction rate
Consider a mono-energetic neutron beam in which n is the neutron density, i.e.,
the number of neutrons/m3. If v is the neutron speed, then nv is the number of neutrons
falling on 1 m2 of target material per second. The product Σnv gives the number of
interactions (between neutrons and nuclei) per m3 of target material per second; thus,
Reaction rate 5 Σnv
interactions m23s21
This expression gives the number of neutron interactions per second in 1 m3 of
material. The neutron flux is defined as the product of the neutron density and velocity:
φ 5 nv
neutrons m22s21
and
Reaction rate 5 Σφ
interactions m23s21
The microscopic and macroscopic cross-sections are distinguished by adding a
subscript for each reaction. For example, σa for absorption, σf for fission, σs for
scattering, and σt for total cross-section.
4.6
Neutron energy distribution and maxwellbolzmann
distribution
The fission neutron energy distribution is shown in Fig. 4.1.
The average neutron energy is about 2 MeV, corresponding to a neutron speed
of about 20,000 km/s. The fission probability increases at lower neutron energy, as
shown in Fig. 4.2.

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

Since the fission cross-section increases at low energies, most nuclear reactors
use a moderator material to slow down the fission neutrons. The best moderators
are light elements like hydrogen and carbon, because the recoil nucleus can absorb
a large fraction of the neutron energy with each elastic collision. When the neutron
energy is comparable to energies of the surrounding atoms, the neutron is called
“thermalized.” Reactors using mainly fission by thermal neutrons are called
“thermal reactors.” Nuclear reactors which use mainly fissions induced by fast
neutrons are called “fast reactors.” The difference is the energy distribution of
neutrons in the reactor, as shown in Fig. 4.3.

Reactor physics of MSR

If neutrons are introduced into an infinite, nonabsorbing scattering medium,
from which neutrons are neither lost by escape nor by absorption, a state of thermal
equilibrium will be attained. In this state, the probabilities are equal that a neutron
will gain or lose energy in a collision with a scattering nucleus. The kinetic energies
of the neutrons would then be represented by a “Maxwellian” distribution, charac-
terized by the medium temperature.
4.7
Transport and diffusion of neutrons
Fission reactions generate heat, which must be removed by a coolant. The fission
reaction rate depends on the neutron flux distribution, which can be calculated from
the neutron transport equation (Boltzmann equation):

It is a differential/integral equation of neutron flux with seven independent vari-
ables (three spatial, two angular, energy, and time). It cannot be solved analytically
except for very simplified cases. It is helpful to use discrete values of neutron flux,
position, energy, angles, and time. Then the time-dependent problem reduces to a
steady-state problem within each time step.
4.7.1
Energy discretization
The neutrons in a reactor have energy range from about 10 MeV down to less than
0.01 eV. The energy variable is handled by the multigroup method. The energy
range of interest is divided in to G “groups” as shown in Fig. 4.4, where cross-
sections are averaged in each energy group.
Group fluxes, group sources, and group fission spectra are also averaged in each
energy group. We assume that the neutron flux may be represented by a product of
angular flux and a function of energy f(E).

where fðEÞ is neutron energy spectrum f(E).
Group cross-sections are defined as the average values for each energy group.
Using these discretizations and averages, a multigroup transport equation is
obtained.
Multigroup transport equations are accurate under the following conditions:
1. Angular flux is separable with known spectrum fðEÞ
2. Cross-sections are constant within each energy interval.
3. Small intervals of energy, angle, space, and time are used
The unknowns in the multigroup transport equation are the group fluxes. Here,
for simplicity, we consider a steady-state case (the time derivative term is omitted):

This equation still has variables of position and angle. The angular flux may be
expanded by spherical harmonics (PN method) or segmented in fixed angles
(discrete-ordinate method or SN method).

and solids. The neutrons diffuse from high to low concentrations, and the diffiusion
rate is proportional to the concentration gradient.

Calculation of nuclear group constants
Reactor physics calculations require nuclear group constants of both microscopic
and macroscopic cross-sections. They are calculated thorough numerical programs
using evaluated nuclear cross-section data libraries such as ENDF/B by USA,
JEFF by NEA, or JENDL by Japan. Normally the calculations are done in
two steps. In the first step, it is the cell or lattice calculation which provides a
few-group constants library. These few-group constants include few-group micro-
and macroscopic cross-sections and other information required for core calcula-
tions. Secondly, coupled neutron diffusion and thermal-hydraulics are usually
carried out for a single- or quarter-assembly homogenized configuration for
specially homogenized and energy group condensed few-group constants for whole
core calculations.
4.7.4
Fuel burnup calculations
Fuel burnup calculations can be done to estimate composition changes with fuel
burnup. In this calculation many reactions are taken into account, including radia-
tion decay chains of all fuel components and fission products. These data are used
to evaluate inventories of fuel and fission products with burnup.

but it is infinitely large in the y and z directions. The number of neutrons lost
per unit volume per second is balanced by the production by nuclear fission
as follows.

The solution of this equation is well known as

(4.16)
As the original diffusion equation is a second-order differential equation,
we need two boundary conditions to determine the constants, A and C. We set the
origin of the coordinate at the center of the slab reactor. The neutron flux must be
real and positive in the reactor. One boundary condition is that the flux must be
zero at the outer boundary. The other is that the flux distribution must be symmetric
around the center plane of the reactor. Because of the second boundary condition
the constant A must be zero. Then the first boundary condition requires that
φ 6 a

We assume the thickness of the reactor is a. Therefore,

The sizes include extrapolation distance, which is as a correction to the diffusion
approximation. In this section, such detailed discussion is neglected. Also neglected
is the discussion of multiregion reactor, in which the boundary conditions are conti-
nuity of neutron flux and current at the boundary.
These analytical solutions can be obtained only for simple geometry and
homogeneous media. In the actual situations, a reactor has three dimensions and
the compositions are not homogeneous. In such cases, the solutions can be
obtained only by numerical analysis. The solution methods are outside the scope
of this chapter.
MSRs are operated on circulating liquid fuel. Thus, the fuel compositions are
homogeneous in the reactor. The power distribution can be approximately expressed
as Cosine and Bessel function for axial and radial distributions, respectively.
4.9
Kinetic equations
When a reactor is critical the reactor power stays constant. However, in order to
change reactor power it is required to change effective multiplication of the reactor.
When the effective multiplication factor is changed, how will the reactor power
104
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

change? In order to answer this question, we need to know or solve reactor kinetic
equations. Thus, in this section, a brief explanation of the derivation of the reactor
kinetic equations is given, based on the diffusion equation of one energy group
approximation model. Note that the following discussion assumes no fuel flow.
Reactors with fuel flow are discussed in Chapter 5 of MSR kinetics and dynamics.
A subcritical reactor is not in a steady state without a neutron source in the sys-
tem. In the diffusion approximation, Eq. (4.3) may reduced to the form
Dr2φ 2
X
aφ 1 S 5 dh
dt
(4.30)
In this equation, S indicates neutron source, which is expressed as
S 5 kNΣaφð1 2 βÞ 1 λC
(4.31)
The first term indicates the prompt-neutron contribution and the second
term indicates delayed neutron contribution. In the nuclear fission process,
some neutrons are produced from fission products with some time delay.
Usually they are classified into six groups but in our simplified discussion, they
are treated as one group. Let β present the fraction of fission neutrons which
are delayed; then ð1 2 βÞ is the prompt-neutron fraction. The delayed neutrons
are produced by radioactive decay of the precursors and expressed as λC,
where λ is effective decay constant and C represents the atomic density of the
precursors.
Substituting the neutron source term into the Eq. (4.30),
Dr2φ 2 Σaφ 1 kNΣaφð1 2 βÞ 1 λC 5 dn

(4.32)
In this expression, neutron flux and precursor are both functions of time and
space in a finite reactor. It will be assumed that the variables are separable, so the
spatial distribution r2φ can be replaced by B2φ, where B2 is the geometrical
buckling. This separation of variables leads to what is called the “point-reactor”
model. Recalling that φ 5 nv and D=Σa 5 L2,

The discrete ordinates transport theory can be accurate for simple geometries,
such as slabs and cylinders, but it is not practical to use it for complex geometrical
shapes. For complicated geometries it is better to use the Monte Carlo method.
4.10
Monte Carlo method
The Monte Carlo method simulates a large number of individual particle trajecto-
ries, and then averages the results to determine the desired quantities, such as
energy deposition. We will consider neutrons, keeping in mind that the technique
applies also to gamma rays. To simulate a given neutron’s history, a series of
questions are posed, and the answer to each question is decided statistically. For
example, if only two choices were available, and if they had equal probability, we
could flip a coin to decide. In practice many choices are available, and they have
probabilities determined by factors such as nuclear scattering cross-sections. Instead
of flipping a coin, a random number generator is used. The random number genera-
tor is a computer algorithm (procedure) to generate decimal fractions randomly and
uniformly between 0 and 1.
The random number is compared with the probability of an event to decide
whether or not it occurs. For example, if the probability of an event were 0.300,
we could decide that the event will occur if the random number is less than 0.300,
and that it will not occur if the random number is greater than 0.300. A flow chart
for Monte Carlo neutron simulations is shown in Fig. 4.5.
The neutron interactions are tallied (recorded) until it is absorbed or lost.
Tracking thousands of neutron histories and averaging the results can provide
accurate estimates of fission power, shielding, transmutations, and other phenom-
ena. If the goal is to evaluate a result that has low probability, such as penetrating a
thick shield, then large numbers of histories ( . 105) may be required to achieve
high accuracy, but “variance reduction techniques” may be used to reduce the

Introduction
This chapter discusses the statics, kinetics, and dynamics of molten salt reactors.
Naturally, MSRs differ from the traditional solid fuel reactors also with regards to
their dynamic response to operational changes or disturbances, including start-up
and shutdown. For instance, as will be shown in this chapter, the movement of the
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-08-101126-3.00005-1

delayed neutron precursors in the core changes (enhances) the spatial neutronic cou-
pling within the core, which naturally influences the spacetime behavior of the
reactor. Further, the time duration which the delayed precursors spend in the core
and in the outer loop, respectively, influences the neutron balance in the core, and
hence the dynamic response. Changes in the fuel velocity affect the criticality, and
even small fluctuations of the velocity, including turbulence, might induce small
neutron fluctuations. Further, similarly to how the propagation of temperature and
density fluctuations in the coolant of a PWR, and two-phase flow in a BWR induce
measurable neutron noise, similar perturbations (temperature fluctuations, void), as
well as propagation of small inhomogeneities in the spatial distribution of the fuel
concentration, the fission products and the delayed neutron precursors, will all lead
to measurable neutron noise in an MSR. It is expected that similarly to traditional
reactors, this neutron noise can be used for diagnostics and surveillance of the reac-
tor status.
Although core physics and thermal hydraulics are tightly coupled even in solid
fuel reactors, such as light-water reactors, it is obvious that the physics of MSRs is
even more characterized by the strong interplay between the neutronic and the fluid
fuel movement. Hence, methods aiming at a high-fidelity modeling of the space
time behavior of such systems must be based on a coupled core-physics—fluid
flow model, and preferably on multiphysics modeling. A substantial volume of
research has been performed along these lines (for an excellent summary see
Krepel, 2006; Dulla, 2005; and Cammi et al., 2011), leading to the development of
code systems such as Cinsf1D (Lecarpentier and Carpentier, 2003), DYN1D-MSR
(Krepel, 2005, 2006), DYN3D-MSR (Krepel et al., 2007, 2008, 2014), and
SIMMER-III (Wang et al., 2006). Much of this work was also performed with inter-
national cooperation, such as the European research projects MOST (Delpech et al.,
2003) and EVOL (Merle-Lucotte et al.). A benchmark exercise was also performed
for an intercomparison of the various computational tools (Delpech et al., 2003).
Apart from the full spacetime diffusion and fluid flow approaches, kinetic
approximations were also used, such as the adiabatic approximation (Wang and
Cao, 2016b) and the quasistatic approximation (Dulla et al., 2004). The use of the
point kinetic approximation was also attempted, but its application turned out to be
much more problematic, as will be discussed in more detail later.
In this chapter the kinetics, dynamics, and neutron noise in an MSR will be trea-
ted in an utterly simple model of an MSR: a one-dimensional homogeneous bare
system in one-group theory. The advantage of studying such a model is that it
allows analytical solutions and hence good insight into the physics and neutronic
behavior of such systems, while still retaining the key ingredients of the physics.
Therefore, such studies were started at an early stage (Dulla, 2005), and pursued by
several groups (Wang and Cao, 2015, 2016b). In addition, for enhanced insight, in
such models some further simplifications can also be made, further enhancing the
possibilities for insight and mathematical simplicity, such as the infinite fuel veloc-
ity assumption. As will be seen, such a simple model, and the considerations it
allows, will be beneficial even for the solution and interpretation of the static case.
The extension of the model to two-group theory is straightforward, such that all
112
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

advantages with obtaining analytical results are preserved. Such results are found in
the literature (Jonsson and Pa´zsit, 2011; Dykin and Pa´zsit, 2016); however, due to
space limitations, these will not be described here.
A note is in order regarding the term “dynamics.” The usual distinction between
reactor kinetics and dynamics is that the latter refers to the case when power feedback
is included. In the model used in this chapter, no feedback effects such as temperature
feedback, graphite expansion effect, etc. are accounted for. Accounting for power
feedback makes it necessary to resort to numerical tools, as was done in the majority
of the above-mentioned references (see also Wang et al.; Wang and Cao, 2016a).
Hence, strictly speaking, only “kinetic” problems are considered here. However, in
reactor noise terminology, it has become customary to refer to kinetics when the
response of the system for a reactivity perturbation is calculated, without specifying
the origin of the reactivity change, whereas when the neutronic response is due to a
physical perturbation, modeled by a noise source, such a response is termed dynamic.
In the dynamic cases (according to the above terminology), both time and fre-
quency behavior will be investigated, the emphasis being on the latter. The transient
behavior during start-up will be investigated through the space and time dependence
of the flux, whereas the kinetic and dynamic response of the reactor will be charac-
terized by the spacefrequency response to small stationary perturbations (fluctua-
tions around the critical state). The emphasis will be on the dynamic properties that
are specific to MSR and which therefore differ from those in solid fuel systems.
5.2
The MSR model
We assume a homogeneous unreflected slab reactor with one axial dimension along
the z axis. The flow of the fuel is also assumed to take place along this direction.
The extrapolated system boundaries will lie at z 5 0 and z 5 H, where thus the flux
will vanish. We use one-group diffusion theory, and one average group of delayed
neutron precursors will be assumed. The fuel, flowing axially with a velocity u,
will be led back from the core outlet at z 5 H to the core inlet at z 5 0 through loop
of length L. The total length T of the recirculation will thus be T 5 H 1 L. The cor-
responding transit times will be denoted as τc 5 H/u for the passage through the
core, τL 5 L/u in the external loop, and τ 5 τc 1 τL for the total recirculation time.
Actually, in a real MSR, the fuel velocities within the core and in the outer loop
are unlikely to be equal. However, for convenience, a real MSR with a fuel velocity
u0 different from the core velocity in the core, in an outer loop T0 can be rescaled
such that one artificially chooses the loop length L to be L 5 u/u0  T0, such that the
real outer recirculation time τL 5 L0/u0 5 L/u will be maintained.
It may be worth mentioning now that sometimes, and in particular in the cases
when one has symmetry (e.g., with u 5 0 and u 5 N, the latter will be discussed
soon), it is practical to choose another coordinate system with spatial coordinate x,
whose origin is in the middle of the reactor. In this case the core boundaries will lie
at x 56a, and obviously one has H 5 2a.

Regarding the boundary conditions, the flux is assumed to disappear at the
extrapolated boundaries:
φð0; tÞ 5 φðH; tÞ 5 0:
(5.3)
However, unlike for traditional systems, where one does not need to specify any
boundary conditions for the nonmoving precursors, it is necessary to specify bound-
ary conditions for an MSR due to the streaming of the fuel and hence that of
the precursors. In a traditional system the precursor density would also vanish at
the extrapolated boundary; however, the same condition cannot be prescribed in the
MSR. Due to the flow, precursors generated in the whole volume of the core will
leave on the exit, and will return to the inlet (diminished by the decay during the
travel time). Hence the precursor density will not be zero at the boundaries. The
only condition one can set is that the number density of delayed neutron precursors
at the inlet is the same as that at the outlet with a time τL 5 L/u earlier, but
decreased by the decay during this time:
Cð0; tÞ 5 CðH; t 2 τLÞe2λτL:
(5.4)
Even if the notion of the extrapolated boundary is a conceptual one, and one does
not assume the flux physically to vanish at the extrapolation point, one might still dis-
cuss whether it is physically sound to treat equations even formally where the flux is
zero and the precursor density is different from zero. However, it is easy to confirm
that these boundary conditions lead to physically sound results. One way of doing
this is to replace the zero boundary condition at the extrapolated boundary with loga-
rithmic boundary conditions at the physical boundary. Such an investigation was per-
formed by Pa´zsit et al. (2012) and the results showed a negligible quantitative
difference. Hence in the continuation the above boundary conditions will be used.

with the boundary conditions corresponding to the stationary form of (5.4) which
read
C0ð0Þ 5 C0ðHÞe2λτL:
(5.7)
Here, in addition to the streaming term for the precursors in Eq. (5.6), there is
another crucial difference as compared to traditional static fuel reactors. Namely, in
the latter, the delayed neutron precursors do not appear in the critical equations.
This is always the case in one-group theory, whether one considers the transport
equation or the diffusion approximation; and in energy-dependent cases it is still
the case as long as the energy spectrum of the delayed neutrons is assumed to be
equal to that of the prompt neutrons. As was noted already in Mattioda et al.
(2000), in the case of an MSR, the delayed neutron precursors appear explicitly
even in one-group diffusion theory, and cannot be eliminated from the static
equations.
5.3.1
The adjoint property
Before continuing with the solution of this equation, it is worth taking a small devi-
ation regarding an interesting property of the MSR equations. It is known that the
transport equation, or the multigroup diffusion equations are not self-adjoint, but
the one-group diffusion equations are self-adjoint. Not surprisingly, it turns out that
in the case of an MSR, not even the one-group diffusion equations are self-adjoint
(at finite fuel velocities). Similarly to the neutron streaming term of the diffusion
equation, the reason for the nonadjoint property here is the streaming term of the
precursors, i.e., the left-hand side of Eq. (5.6). Put a different way, the reason is the
directed flow of the fuel in the core, which is not invariant for time-reversal.
To show the nonadjoint property and to show how the adjoint equation can be
constructed, it is practical to write Eqs. (5.5) and (5.6) in matrix form

Kinetics, dynamics, and neutron noise in stationary MSRs

Except the convection term for the precursors, all other terms give equal contribu-
tions on the two sides of Eq. (5.9).
Similarly to the case of the transport equation, in order to construct the adjoint
equation and the adjoint flux, it is not sufficient to construct an adjoint operator;
one also needs to specify boundary conditions for the adjoint flux (in the pre-
sent case for the precursor densities). Hence we seek a matrix

It is easy to prove that with this construction, Eq. (5.11) holds. It is seen that the
terms resulting from the off-diagonal and constants elements are equal, only the
convection terms need to be checked. Taking the difference between the terms from
the two sides of Eq. (5.11), one has

(5.14)
This proves that the adjoint property is fulfilled by the operator (5.12) and the
boundary conditions for the adjoint precursor density (5.13).
It is also interesting to notice one major difference between the construction of
the adjoint for the MSR as compared to the transport equation of traditional reac-
tors, because it will have a bearing on the derivation of the point kinetic equations.
In the transport equation, the construction of the adjoint incurs reversing the neu-
tron velocity vectors, and specify different boundary conditions (in angle) at the
same place and at the same time. As is seen from Eqs. (5.7) and (5.13), the direct
and adjoint boundary conditions are relating the precursor densities at different
place and different time (here, expressed by the decay terms). In the static case, this
does not cause a problem since both the static and the adjoint precursor density are
116
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

time-independent. However, as is seen from Eq. (5.4), in the time-dependent case
the boundary conditions relate precursor densities at one place to another one at a
different time and place, which will destroy the possibility of constructing a proper
adjoint equation in the dynamic case. This point will be revisited later when dis-
cussing the point kinetic approximation.
5.3.2
Interpretation of the equation and some limiting cases
Similarly to the traditional systems, the equation for the precursor density can be
solved to express C0(z) with φ0(z), and one can derive an integro-differential equa-
tion for solely the flux. By integrating (5.6) one finds that

where it is worth noting that only the full recirculation time τ appears. Hence one
has a single integro-differential equation for the static flux in the form

(5.16)
As can be seen, due to the indefinite integral in the last term, the characteristic
equation is of third-order, making fully analytical solutions possible. However,
before setting out to solve Eq. (5.16), it is worth analyzing Eq. (5.15) in some
detail. By expanding the fraction multiplying the first integral on the r.h.s. as
1
eλτ 2 1 5
e2λτ

:
(5.18)
This equation is suitable for an insight-giving interpretation. The second integral
on the r.h.s. expresses the fact that all precursors generated at a rate βνΣf φ0(z0),
between the core inlet and the observation point z, that is in all points 0 # z0 # z,
will give a contribution to the total density at z, the exponential factor taking care
of the decay due to the time (z 2 z0)/u it takes to get from z0 to z. The factor 1/u
only corresponds to dt 5 dz/u. These precursors were hence generated in the last
(“just actual”) recirculation cycle. The infinite sum of the integrals in the first term
117
Kinetics, dynamics, and neutron noise in stationary MSRs

on the r.h.s stands for a similar expression, but it is due to the precursors which
were generated anywhere in the core with one, two, etc. full recirculation cycles
earlier.
Hence it is seen that in Eq. (5.16), the first integral corresponds to the multiply
recirculated precursors, whereas the second corresponds to the precursors which are
“freshly” generated, and have not recirculated yet. This form also lends the possibil-
ity of introducing two different further simplifications which can be interpreted on
physical terms, out of which one leads to exceptionally simple formulae that are
also useful in the dynamic case.
5.3.3
The case of no recirculation
This case is only conceptionally interesting, because it does not lead to much sim-
plification in mathematical terms. Assuming that the outer loop is infinitely long,
so that all precursors decay before returning to the core, such that τ 5 N, the first
integral vanishes, and the equation simplifies to

λðz2z0Þ
u
φ0ðz0Þdz0 5 0:
(5.19)
This equation could also have been obtained directly by simply setting C(0) 5 0.
Although in some practical cases it might prove a good approximation, from the
calculational point of view, it does not bring much improvement. Despite the sim-
plification in the form of the equation, its characteristic equation is still of third-
order. The properties of such solutions were compared in Pa´zsit et al. (2012) with
those where recirculation is significant, just in order to quantify the difference for
various magnitude of recirculated precursors, depending on the recirculation time.
This simplification will not be considered in the continuation.
5.3.4
The case of infinite fuel velocity
A much more interesting conceptual case is to consider high fuel velocities, in the
limit of u !N, which entails then τ 5 0 and u τ 5 T with T being the total recircu-
lation length L 1 H. Performing the limit, from (5.16) one obtains

T
ðH
0
φ0ðz0Þdz0 5 0:
(5.20)
Formally, the limiting procedure means that as the velocity increases, less and
less precursors decay before returning to the core, and this leads to the dominance
of the contribution from the multiply recirculated precursors [the first integral in
(5.16)] over the precursors generated in the current cycle (the second integral). This
happens when λτ{1, i.e., the precursor decay during one recirculation cycle is
negligible. This is not a completely unrealistic assumption. The results obtained by
118
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

this approximation are therefore useful because they correspond to realistic cases
reasonably well, whereas their solution is much simpler and transparent than that of
the finite velocity case. Also, along with the case of zero fuel velocity (i.e., tradi-
tional reactors), it represents the other extreme of the scale of different fuel veloci-
ties (and similarly to the static fuel case, the equation is self-adjoint).
It has also to be added that when u !N, the traditionally used MSR equations
break down, in principle. This is since the flow of the fuel should require the pres-
ence of a streaming term also in Eq. (5.5) in the form (Zhang et al., 2009)
1
v r  ðuφÞ
where v stands for the neutron velocity. Since in practical cases u{v, this term is
usually neglected. However, it is easy to confirm by quantitative calculations that
the static and kinetic behavior of an MSR is practically the same at rather moderate
velocities, such as u 5 300400 cm/s as what one obtains from the equations with
u 5 N, which justifies the use of this approximation for conceptual studies.
Eq. (5.20) has an extremely simple solution. Since in this case both the static flux
and the precursors are symmetric around H/2, it is practical to change the space vari-
able to, x 5 z 2 H

, which, as mentioned earlier, means that the system boundaries
will lie at x 5 6a instead of 0 and H. In this coordinate system the solution reads as

Since the static equation is homogeneous, the factor A will remain arbitrary, but
(5.21) with its argument (5.22) must fulfill the criticality condition to be a true solu-
tion. This condition can be obtained by putting (5.21) into (5.20). This shows that

Kinetics, dynamics, and neutron noise in stationary MSRs

Also, as is easily obtained from (5.15), one finds that the distribution of delayed
neutron precursors is constant in space:

(5.26)
which is expected from physical intuition. Here in the second equality the form of
the flux from Eq. (5.21) and the criticality Eq. (5.25) were utilized. It is thus seen
that, similarly to a core with a static fuel, i.e., for u 5 0, both the static flux and the
delayed precursor density are symmetric around the origin, although the distribution
of the precursors with moving fuel is very different from the case with a static fuel.
Some further interesting insight can be gained by considering the case of the
infinite external loop, i.e., when T!N, by keeping the core size H 5 2a constant.
Physically, since in this case H/T!0, the fraction of the precursors that decay in
the core, and indeed the precursor density itself everywhere in the loop tends to
zero, one must have C0 5 0, which is confirmed by (5.26). This also means that
core must be critical only based on the prompt neutrons. This is indeed seen from
Eq. (5.25), which shows that one must have cos(B0a) 5 0, i.e., in this case the MSR
with moving fuel must have the same buckling as a traditional reactor of the same
size. If the absorption cross-sections of the two reactors are the same, this means
that, by virtue of (5.22), the MSR must have a higher fission cross-section. For
finite T values, some of the precursors will decay in the core, hence a lower fission
cross-section is sufficient to keep the MSR critical, hence the buckling will be
smaller than in the equivalent traditional core. This is generally valid also for finite
fuel velocities.

The full Eq. (5.16) can be solved by seeking the solution in form of expansion into
the eigenfunctions of a traditional reactor with stationary fuel, i.e., in the eigenfunc-
tions of a simple Helmholtz equation. This method converges fast, and is practical
in quantitative work, hence it was used in several publications (Dulla, 2005; Pa´zsit
and Jonsson, 2011). However, the equation can also be solved in a compact analyti-
cal form, as first suggested in Lapenta and Ravetto (2000). The same method can
also be used in the time- and frequency-dependent calculations described in the
forthcoming. Hence the principle of the calculations is briefly described here.
The closed analytical solution of (5.16) is obtained as follows (for the details we
refer to Pa´zsit et al., 2012). By differentiating once with respect to z and rearran-
ging, one obtains a simple linear differential equation with constant coefficients in
the form

(5.32)
Hence the characteristic equation has three roots. One can show that one root is
real, and the other two are complex conjugates. In view of this, the solution can be
written in the form
φ0ðzÞ 5 A1eαz sinðβzÞ 1 A2eαz cosðβzÞ 1 A3eγz:
(5.33)
Of the three unknown coefficients, two can be eliminated by using the boundary
conditions of vanishing flux at z 5 0 and z 5 H, whereas substituting the resulting
form, containing only one undetermined coefficient, will supply the criticality con-
dition. Once the flux is found in an analytical form, the precursor density can easily
be derived through Eq. (5.15).
5.3.6
Alternative solution of the MSR equations
An equivalent, alternative way of solving the MSR equations is to solve the coupled
differential equations for the flux and the precursor density, without eliminating the
delayed neutron precursors. This solution method, similar to the treatment of the
two-group diffusion equations of a traditional system, brings out the different spa-
tial behavior of the flux and the delayed neutron precursors in an MSR in a more
transparent way than the method used above.

Even without possession of a concrete solution, Eq. (5.35) shows that, since for
u 6¼ 0 the cn are all different, the space dependence of the delayed neutron precur-
sors is different from that of the static flux. This form is also suitable for deriving

Quantitative results
Quantitative results are shown here for one core size with H 5 300 cm, and extrapo-
lation distance of 10 cm, corresponding to a power reactor. Following Dulla (2005),
the numerical values used in this chapter correspond to a traditional U-fueled ther-
mal system (the numerical data are shown in Table 5.1). The value of the neutron
velocity v was artificially chosen to have β/Λ 5 100, where Λ 5 1/(v νΣf), which is
the customary value of the break frequency of the zero power reactor transfer func-
tion G0(ω) in LWRs (more on that in Sections 5.55.7).
Calculations were made with different fuel velocities. Fig. 5.1 shows the neutron
flux (Fig. 5.1A) and the delayed neutron precursors (Fig. 5.1B) in a large reactor,
with different fuel velocities. Results are shown only for the physical reactor size,
but not for the extrapolated boundary region. It is seen that the originally symmet-
ric, cosine-shaped flux, which is symmetrical around the origin, gets distorted with
increasing fuel velocities, the maximum being shifted towards the exit. At high
velocities, when τUλ{1, the flux shape becomes symmetric again.

The spatial distribution of the precursors changes much more significantly. For
zero and low-fuel velocity, the distribution is similar to that of the static flux, with
a maximum at or close the core center. With increasing liquid fuel velocities the
maximum gets shifted towards the core exit, and at high velocities the maximum
shifts all the way up to the core exit, such that the spatial dependence becomes
monotonically increasing, before at ultrahigh fuel velocities it flattens out to
approach the spatially constant distribution in the limit of u !N.
The character of these results depends though partly on the effective delayed
neutron fraction, which in the present calculations corresponds to a thermal system
using U-235. By extrapolating the results of Dulla (2005), in an MSR containing
thorium of minor actinides with a smaller value of β, the effect of the velocity on
the static flux shape will be smaller.
The above-shown nonmonotonic change of the shape of the static flux, and the
corresponding change in the dynamic transfer function, can be interpreted in simple
terms. Starting with an MSR with static fuel and turning to static MSRs in equilib-
rium but with increasing fuel velocities, at low-fuel velocities all delayed neutron
precursors which leave the core will decay in the external loop. This leads to a loss
of reactivity and a spatial asymmetry in the flux and the precursor distributions.
This tendency is monotonic up to a certain fuel velocity, when the return of the pre-
cursors to the core via recirculation starts to become significant. This will counter-
act the asymmetry in the flux, hence the nonmonotonic shape change. As was
discussed in Wang and Cao (2015), this will also lead to a nonmonotonic behavior
in the fraction α of the precursors that will decay in the core as compared to the
total number of decays in the core and the external loop together.
However, as discussed in Mattioda et al. (2000), the dependence of the reactivity
loss due to the recirculation on the fuel velocity is more involved. In addition to the
fraction of the precursors which decay in the core, another contributing factor is the
change of the importance function. As is seen in Fig. 5.1, the difference between
the space dependence of the neutron flux and that of the precursors increases mono-
tonically with increasing velocity. This indicates that with increasing velocity, most
neutrons will decay at a place with a different importance than the place they were
born. In practical cases this means that the dependence of the reactivity loss
increases monotonically with increasing fuel velocity, as seen in the quantitative
results in Dulla (2005) and Mattioda et al. (2000).
5.4
Spacetime-dependent transient during start-up
In this section an outline is given, together with some asymptotic analysis, of how
the formalism developed for the treatment of the space- and frequency-dependent
response of the system, can also be used for calculating transients in systems with
spatially homogeneous cross-sections. A typical case is considering a critical MSR,
in which, however, initially the flux and/or the delayed neutron precursor distribu-
tion does not correspond to that in the stationary critical system. The starting
125
Kinetics, dynamics, and neutron noise in stationary MSRs

example will consist of the following setting. We assume a critical homogeneous
MSR, initially with stationary (nonmoving) fuel. Hence the equations will be the
same as for a traditional reactor. Then, a hypothetical transient is created such that
at time t 5 0, the fluid fuel velocity jumps instantaneously to a value u . 0. Since
an MSR core which is critical with a stationary fuel becomes subcritical when the
fuel starts moving, some of the cross-sections need to be adjusted to a new value
(e.g., the fission cross-section has to be changed to a higher value), to make the
MSR critical with moving fluid fuel in the stationary case (which will be attained
asymptotically). Hence, after an initial transient, the spatial distribution of the flux
and the precursor density will tend to the shape corresponding to a critical MSR
with the specified velocity. However, straight after t 5 0, there may be a mismatch,
e.g., a deficit of neutrons from the decay of the delayed neutron precursors, which
will cause a transient, whose duration is comparable with the mean life of the pre-
cursors. The amplitude of the final, asymptotic value of the flux will be not only
different in shape, but also different in magnitude than that of the original critical
flux. If no precursors were in the system initially, the final flux amplitude will be
lower than the initial one.
5.4.1
The spacetime-dependent equations for the transient
We shall first treat the case of starting with a critical traditional reactor, although
the formalism is more general. Let us denote the material parameters of the initial
core with static fuel with a zero index, and the static critical flux and precursor den-
sity as ϕs(z) and Cs(z). As will be seen soon, the static flux and precursor distribu-
tions will serve as starting values, or “source” terms, for the time-dependent
calculations, which explain the choice of the subscript s. In principle, any nonnega-
tive values can be chosen, not only those of a traditional critical system. We assume
the same homogeneous one-dimensional system as in the foregoing, with extrapo-
lated boundaries at z 5 0 and z 5 H with assuming a vanishing flux at the extrapo-
lated boundaries. With these notations, the static equations in this system read as
D0r2φsðzÞ 1 ½νΣ0
f 2 ΣaφsðzÞ 5 0
(5.43)
and
βνΣ0
f φsðzÞ 5 λCsðzÞ
(5.44)
with the boundary conditions φs(0) 5 φs(H) 5 0. The zero superscript of the fission
cross-section indicates that this is the initial value at t 5 20, which will be changed
to a new one when the fuel starts moving at t 5 10. The parameters of the system
with a moving fuel will be denoted without an index, as before. This system is also
homogeneous (cross-sections constant in space and time), and differ from the sys-
tem with a static fuel only in the fission cross-section.
126
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

The static equations for such a slab reactor with fuel velocity u in one-group dif-
fusion theory with one-group of delayed neutrons, to which the reactor will asymp-
totically converge, are the same as in the previous section:

with the boundary conditions

(5.47)
and
C0ð0Þ 5 C0ðHÞe2λτL;
(5.48)
where τL is the recirculation time in the outer loop. Here the subscript 0 was used,
as before, to denote the static flux and precursor distributions, which will naturally
be different from the φs(z) and Cs(z) of the initial system with static fuel.
We assume now that at time t 5 0 the fuel instantaneously will get moving with
a constant velocity u, and the fission cross-section is raised instantaneously from
that of the static system, Σ0
f , to that of the system with moving fuel, Σf with which
it is asymptotically critical. We also assume, however, that when the jump in the
velocity and the cross-sections happens, the flux and the delayed neutron distribu-
tions belong to those of the static system:
φðz; t 5 0Þ 5 φsðzÞ;
and
Cðz; t 5 0Þ 5 CsðzÞ:
(5.49)
Clearly, other choices are also possible (which will be considered later). Since
these initial flux and precursor distributions do not correspond to the MSR with mov-
ing fuel, there will be a transient period, during which the flux and precursor distribu-
tions will be space- and time-dependent, but asymptotically will tend to a time-
independent shape again. The goal is to calculate the transient. This can be achieved
by analytical Laplace transform and numerical inverse Laplace transform methods.

The boundary conditions for the flux are given for all times t $ 0 as

whereas for the precursors they will read
Cð0; tÞ 5 CðH; t 2 τLÞe2λτL:

which is also obvious on physical grounds. In the static MSR, there are no precur-
sors in the external loop, hence after the start of the flow, it takes time τL before
the precursors leaving the core exit will reach the core inlet, and during this time
the precursor density at the inlet remains zero.

The solution goes as for the static equations, by solving the precursor equations
(5.56), using the boundary conditions (5.58), and substituting the solution back to
the Laplace transformed equations for the flux, Eq. (5.55). The only difference is
that, unlike in the static equations which refer to a critical system and hence are
homogeneous, we have the additional inhomogeneous terms φs(z) and Cs(z). Thus
the solution of the precursor equations reads as

Kinetics, dynamics, and neutron noise in stationary MSRs

The strategy is to solve Eq. (5.64) analytically in the Laplace domain and then
integrate it with F(z, s) according to (5.65). The equation for the Green’s function
has exactly the same form as the one used in the neutron noise equations, which
has already been determined in previous work (Pa´zsit and Jonsson, 2011), and
which will be derived in detail in Section 5.5. One just has to replace iω with s.
Since the Green’s function can be determined analytically, it can be integrated ana-
lytically with the F(z, s) of Eq. (5.14).
The last remaining step to obtain the spacetime dependence of the flux is to
perform an inverse Laplace transform:

(5.66)
In the general case of finite fuel velocities u, the inverse transform cannot be
obtained analytically. However, based on the analytical expression of φ(z, s), a
numerical inverse Laplace transform method can be used. Such methods were used
in the past for calculating the spacetime behavior of neutron pulses injected to
critical systems (Yoshioka et al., 1998). Here we will confine the treatment to the
model case of infinite fuel velocity, and derive some asymptotic results analytically,
which do not require an inverse transform.
5.4.2
Solution for u !N
By assuming infinite fuel velocity after t 5 0, the corresponding equations will be
very much simplified and suitable to give insight. At the same time, as will be
seen, the case is somewhat pathological, and has to be taken with some cautious-
ness. Namely, at time t 5 20, the distribution of the delayed neutron precursors in
the core will be a cosine-shaped function, whereas in the outer loop there will be no
precursors. Just after t 5 10, at any given point in the core, the precursor density
will oscillate with infinite speed between zero and the maximal value one had at
t 5 20 at the center of the reactor. However, formally, these oscillations are
smoothed out to a constant value averaged over the whole loop. This constant
amplitude will then change its magnitude when tending to the asymptotic value.

Asymptotic values
With these preliminaries, one can calculate the initial values limt!0 φ(x, t) and
limt!0 C(x, t) from the Tauberian theorems. In an ordinary case one should just get
back the initial conditions, hence this should be a mere check of the correctness of
the formulae. However, due to the pathological character of this model (switching
from zero to infinite fuel velocity during zero time), understandably, for the precur-
sor distributions we will not obtain limt!0 C(x, t) 5 Cs(x). Nevertheless, as will be
seen, the result is completely consistent with the model.

and calculate lims!N F (x, s) and lims!N s G(x, x0, s) separately. One can then
see that in this limit the second term of the F(x, s) of Eq. (5.68) can be neglected,

because the sin and cos terms appear with equal powers in the numerator and the

ator and B2(s)Bs in the denominator. Regarding the remaining term, when expand-

where Cs,0 was already defined in Eq. (5.69) as the constant distribution of the
delayed neutron precursors at t 510. This is not equal to Cs(x), but it is what one
actually expects on physical terms, based on the considerations at the beginning of
this subsection. When the fuel flow recirculation starts at t 510, the previously
cosine-shaped distribution of the precursors gets “smeared out” over a spatial
domain whose length equals to T, and in any given point in the core, the same aver-
age value Cs,0 of the precursor distribution, given by (5.92) prevails.

were chosen in order for an easy comparison with the initial flux shape ϕs(x),
which, similarly to the shape function ϕ0(x), is normalized to unity at x 5 0.
A comparison between φs(x) and ϕ0(x) is shown in Fig. 5.2. It is seen that with
normalizing the two fluxes to the same value at x 5 0 leads to a somewhat wider
shape for φs(x), corresponding to the smaller buckling of the MSR case.
All quantities appearing in Eq. (5.101) are known analytically, hence not only
the normalized shape of φN(x) can be obtained, but also its absolute value.
From (5.21) and (5.98) it is seen that the asymptotic flux shape is identical with
the shape of the static flux of the MSR with u 5 N, and its amplitude is given con-
cretely in terms of the initial values of the flux and the precursor density, φs(x) and

Cs(x), respectively. This gives the possibility to calculate the change of the ampli-
tude of the flux from the initial to the final state, without performing the numerical
inverse Laplace transform. The ratio between the initial and final states will of
course also depend on some parameters of the system, such as the ratio between
the core height and the external loop (this will determine how large a fraction of
the delayed neutrons is lost). A quantitative analysis and discussion are given in the
next subsection.
In a similar manner, from (5.91) it is seen that for the asymptotic form of the
precursor distribution, only the first term gives a contribution, and one obtains

The fission cross-section νΣ0

formula given in the table, leading to a critical traditional core. Thereafter a new,
larger fission cross-section νΣf was calculated from the criticality Eq. (5.23) to
make the core critical with a moving fuel of infinite velocity.

Kinetics, dynamics, and neutron noise in stationary MSRs

First, the initial values φs(x) and Cs(x) were chosen to correspond to the cosine-
shape critical flux and precursor distribution of the static traditional core. With the
material and geometrical data given, the constant value Cs,0 of the initial precursor
distribution at t 510 can be calculated from (5.92), and one obtains the value
Cs;0 5 1:7874 3 1024
(5.104)
The amplitude of the final (asymptotic) flux A of Eq. (5.101), as well as the
asymptotic value of the precursor distribution CN can also be calculated. With the
numerical data one obtains
A 5 0:97
and
CN 5 1:78745 3 1024
(5.105)
The initial and final distribution of the fluxes and the precursors are shown in
Fig. 5.3(A, B), which illustrate the above. Fig. 5.3(B) shows the original cosine-
shaped precursor distribution Cs(x), as well as its the loop-averaged value Cs,0,
existing at t 510, and the asymptotic value CN (this latter cannot be distinguished
from Cs,0 in the plot).
As is seen from both (5.104) and (5.105), as well as from the figures, the initial
and final amplitudes of the flux and the precursor density differ extremely little.
This may seem surprising at first, since after starting the fuel movement,
the amount of delayed neutron precursors will be much less in the core than
before. According to Eq. (5.92), the total amount in the core will be equal to
H/T 5 300/700, ,1/2 times its value in the state of the core with static fuel [clearly
demonstrated in Fig. 5.3(B)]; moreover, the worth of these precursors will also be
less than in the original system, due to a less disadvantageous spatial distribution.
Roughly, the worth of the delayed neutron precursors at t 5 10 will be about one-
third of that at t 520. Hence, one would expect a significant decrease in the flux
amplitude due to the deficit in the delayed neutron precursors.
The explanation for this apparent contradiction lies in the fact that an MSR with
moving fuel is critical with a much lower amount (and worth) of precursors than a
traditional system, and the difference is also about the same factor one-third (with
the geometrical data used here). This is also seen from (5.72), which shows that
since the shapes of the initial and asymptotic fluxes are very similar (c.f., Fig. 5.2),
the level of the precursors needed if the initial flux φs(x) is replaced with the
asymptotic flux in the critical MSR is also about the same as their initial value. Put
it in a different way, the raising of the fission cross-section at t 5 0 brings the MSR
with a moving fuel to very close to the asymptotic (critical) state with the already-
existing precursors. The decrease of the maximum of the flux amplitude from the
initial to final value will be about 3%, whereas the precursor distribution changes
only in the sixth digit, due to the equality of the flux integrals.
These results indicate that if an MSR is started up such that it is first made criti-
cal with stationary fuel, then the fuel starts circulating and at the same time the
reactivity of the system is increased by adding more fuel in the salt approximately
at a proper pace, the arising transient should be expected to be mild.
138
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

A much more significant change in the flux and the precursor distributions can
be seen if one assumes an initial nonzero flux, but no precursors being present in
the core. Such a case was considered for a traditional reactor in Yoshioka et al.
(1998), where the time evolution, and in particular the asymptotic value of the flux
was calculated by injecting neutrons at t 5 0 in form of a spatial Dirac-delta func-
tion into a critical, bare homogeneous system in which neither neutrons nor precur-
sors were found for t # 0. It was shown that asymptotically, the initial flux will
decrease approximately with a factor
β
Λλ  1000
(5.106)
The same value can be derived with a back-of-an-envelope calculation from the
point kinetic equations in one-group theory with one-group of precursors, which
correspond to the case when the starting pulse had the same space dependence as
the critical flux.
A similar scenario in our case is obtained by assuming Cs(x) 5 Cs,0 5 0, which
simply means that the second term on the right hand side of (5.91) as well as (5.95)
will be 0. Eq. (5.100) can be used without changes other than a modified inhomoge-
neous term F(x). Since in the previous case F(x) was dominated by this term, in its
absence the asymptotic value of the flux will be significantly lower, whereas the
precursor distribution will grow from originally zero to its nonzero equilibrium
value. Indeed, calculation of the asymptotic amplitude factor for this case will yield
A 5 0:00275767
(5.107)
This value is completely in line with the traditional results above, with the
exception that the decrease of the original flux is not a factor of 1000, but only
about 360. The reason for the difference is in line with the discussion above: the
MSR considered here needs about one-third of the precursors compared to the tradi-
tional system, hence the deficit of precursors in the initial state of the MSR, as com-
pared to what is needed to make the system critical, is also about three times less
significant than in the traditional core. Hence the milder decrease of the flux ampli-
tude from the initial to the final state.
Since, due to the large amplitude change, such a case is not amenable for illus-
tration, we have selected a case with the starting flux being the same as in the pre-
vious example, whereas the initial value of the precursors was chosen as one-tenth
of the value given in (5.104), i.e., the value Cs,0 5 1.7874 3 1025 was chosen. With
this value, one obtains
A 5 0:0994818
and
CN 5 1:83318 3 1025
(5.108)
That is, the initial flux amplitude decreases by about a factor 10 in the final state,
whereas the precursor distribution increases slightly. This case is shown in
Fig. 5.3C, D.
139
Kinetics, dynamics, and neutron noise in stationary MSRs

The time dependence of the flux and the precursors was calculated by numerical
inverse Laplace transform methods. For illustration, Fig. 5.4 shows the time depen-
dence of the flux and of the delayed neutron precursors from the start of the tran-
sient to the asymptotic, stationary value at the spatial point x 5 0 (i.e., the core
center). Here again, a low, but nonzero initial value of the precursors was chosen. It
is seen that the neutron flux monotonically decreases, whereas the amplitude of the
delayed neutron precursors monotonically increases until both reach the asymptotic
value. Since, due to the infinite fuel velocity, there is no periodicity involved in the
recirculation, there are no oscillations in either the flux or the precursor density.
Similar calculations can be performed also for finite fuel velocities, both for the
asymptotic values and for the time dependence. For space limitations, these are not
given here. Despite the possibility of analytical calculations in the Laplace domain,
the complexity of these calculations leads to a loss of the main advantage of the
analytical methods, i.e., transparency. For such cases the full numerical methods
are more suitable, and many such scenarios were investigated and reported in the
literature.
5.5
Dynamic equations in the frequency domain:
neutron noise
From this section on, the dynamic response of the reactor will be investigated to
small stationary perturbations. In particular, the properties of the neutron noise
induced by small perturbations in the core will be calculated. [For a general overview
of neutron noise theory in traditional systems, see Pa´zsit and Demazie`re (2010)].
As usual in noise theory, the perturbations are represented by the fluctuations of
the cross-sections. In the overwhelming majority of the work performed in tradi-
tional systems in one-group theory, the noise source was assumed to be the fluctua-
tions of the absorption cross-sections. For several important perturbations, such as
density and temperature fluctuations of the coolant, vibration of control rods, this is
naturally the case. Besides, modeling a physical perturbation (such as a vibrating
control or fuel rod), leads to a very similar mathematical representation of the noise
source due to the fluctuation of either of the cross-sections. As a consequence, apart
from some minor trivial differences, the space- and frequency-dependence of the
induced neutron noise will be very similar for both cases.
Due to the above, and also for simplicity of the description and compatibility
with earlier work in traditional systems, the neutron noise due to the fluctuations of
the absorption cross-sections will be elaborated and discussed also in the rest of this
chapter. The justification of this choice is though not self-evident, and deserves
some discussion. Not the least since spacetime fluctuations of the fission cross-
sections, due to the flow of the liquid fuel, will play a much more dominant role in
an MSR than in traditional systems.
The justification is based on a recent work on this question, where the properties
of neutron noise in an MSR, induced by the fluctuations of the fission
140
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

cross-sections, were investigated (Dykin et al., 2016). It was shown that, although
the mathematical representation of the noise source due to fission cross-section
fluctuations in an MSR is indeed much more involved than, and rather different
from, that due to the fluctuations of the absorption cross-sections, the neutron noise
induced by propagating fission and cross-section fluctuations was very similar to
each other both qualitatively and quantitatively. Given this fact and that the mathe-
matical treatment of the neutron noise induced by fission cross-section fluctuations
is much more complicated and less transparent, the choice of only considering
fluctuations of the absorption cross-sections feels justified.
It is assumed that without the fluctuations of the cross-sections, the system is
critical, with time-independent flux and precursor densities. The perturbation is
represented by the space- and time-dependent stationary fluctuations of the cross-
sections around their equilibrium (space- and time-independent, critical) values,
hence the neutron flux and the precursor density will also exhibit small space- and
time-dependent fluctuations. It is assumed that all fluctuating quantities are small,
and in the linear theory which is customary to use in neutron noise theory, the prod-
uct of any two fluctuating quantities can be neglected. This also means that no pro-
ducts of time-dependent quantities will occur, and hence a temporal Fourier-
transform technique can be used for the solution.

This equation is a complete analog of Eq. (5.60), except that the source term is
different (and that iω replaces s). Eq. (5.60) corresponds to a transient in the time
domain, whose source term is represented by the initial conditions. Eq. (5.119), on
the other hand, gives a frequency domain representation of small, stationary fluctua-
tions of the neutron flux, given rise by small, stationary fluctuations of the cross-
section, which thus represents the “noise source.”
5.5.1
The Green’s function
Before turning to any particular case of the perturbation δΣa(z, ω), we will investi-
gate the Green’s function G(z, z0, ω) of the problem, because it only reflects the
properties of the system and not that of the particular perturbation. Often it is sim-
pler to solve the corresponding equations for the Green’s function than for the full
noise equation.
142
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

Similarly to the case of the transient calculations, in order to get insight, it is
interesting to consider the case of infinite fuel velocity first which allows closed
form analytical solutions. Unlike for the transient case, the application of the
infinite fuel velocity model is much less pathological. Since it is assumed that all
perturbations started at t 5 2N, any possible transients have already decayed,
and there is no physical contradiction in the application of infinite fuel velocity.
The closed form analytical solutions will help in getting insight to the dynamics of
reactors with circulating fuel, at least in a limiting case.

adjoint is reflected in the Green’s function.
The second term in the Green’s function is formally identical with the Green’s
function in traditional systems, where the first term is not present. The point
kinetic behavior for traditional systems can be derived from the properties of this
second term as ω tends to zero, because the term sin 2Ba tends to zero. In the
present case, sin 2Ba does not tend to zero when ω tends to zero, and correspond-
ingly, the point kinetic behavior will not be related to the second term, rather it
will derive from the first one. Namely, taking the limit ω!0, the second term of
(5.124) will remain finite, whereas the first will diverge since K(ω)!0, as men-
tioned above. Hence one has
Gðx; x0; ωÞB
η0ϕðxÞϕðx0Þ
TKðωÞB2
0 cos B0a ;
(5.127)
when ω!0. Since the Green’s function is now factorized with regards to frequency
and space dependence, and the space dependence is further factorized into a product
of the static flux at x and x0, respectively, it is shown that an MSR with infinite fuel
velocity also shows point kinetic behavior at low frequencies. The analysis can be
made similarly with considering systems of decreasing size instead of frequency,
with a similar conclusion. However, the case of finite fuel velocity, which is not
self-adjoint, will be considerably more complicated.

Quantitative analysis: comparison with traditional systems
The Green’s function for infinite velocities was calculated in two different systems,
for various frequencies, and compared to the case of a traditional reactor of the
same size. The Greens’s function of a traditional reactor is given as

0 5 π=H. We note that the basic formula for the MSR Green’s function is the
same as that for the traditional reactor, with an extra term added. Another differ-
ence is that to have both systems critical, they need to have slightly different mate-
rial properties. The data used in the calculations are shown in Table 5.1.
The space dependence of the amplitude of the Green’s functions of an MSR and
a traditional system of power reactor size, for x0 5 0 and for various frequencies,
can be seen in Fig. 5.5.
At extremely low and high frequencies, the spatial form of the two Green’s func-
tions is the same, so they have the same asymptotic properties. At low frequencies,
the noise has the same form as the static flux, indicating point kinetic behavior.
However, the amplitude of the Green’s function of the MSR is much larger than
that in the traditional system. This can be related to the fact that the effective
delayed neutron fraction is much smaller in the MSR than in a corresponding tradi-
tional reactor with the same nuclear constant β, due to the fact that a large portion
of precursors decays outside the core in the MSR. It is easy to show for a traditional
system that at plateau frequencies and below, the amplitude of the transfer system
is proportional to 1/β. For the MSR, a rough estimate is that the amplitude is pro-
portional with 1/βeff, where βeff takes account the losses of the decays outside the
core, and one can estimate it as
βeff Bβ
H
L 1 H :
With the present data, H 5 300 cm and L 5 400 cm, one obtains that the amplitude
of the Green’s function of an MSR is approximately 2.33 times larger than that of the
corresponding traditional system. Fig 5.5A, B confirm this estimate quite well.
It has to be noted that in the present analysis an MSR with the parameters of a
traditional thermal reactor fueled with U-235 was taken. A further difference is that
an MSR will presumably run on fuel with a smaller fraction of delayed neutrons
per fission, hence the difference will be even larger. Thus, the above observation
has some relevance even outside the MSR systems and it is interesting in general
for all fast reactor systems or for cores with MOX fuel, due to the smaller fraction
of delayed neutrons. With some simplification it can be claimed that the amplitude
of the neutron noise for the same perturbation can be expected to be larger in
145

Gen-IV systems than in traditional reactors, hence noise diagnostics of such systems
will be effective.
One can also observe in Fig. 5.5AD how the point kinetic behavior, expressed
by the similarity of the space dependence of the Green’s function with that of the
static flux, gradually disappears and the system response to localized perturbations
becomes localized. It is also seen that the MSR retains a point-kinetic behavior for
larger frequencies than a traditional reactor. This can be attributed to the fact that
the MSR is a more tightly coupled system than a traditional reactor, due to the
movement of the fuel which, by transporting delayed neutron precursors from the
place of their generation to their decay, establishes a neutronic coupling between
different regions.

Pa´zsit et al. (2012) and showed only predictable simple quantitative differences
compared to the full recirculation treatment.
As mentioned in connection with the static and transient cases, the equation for
the Green’s function can either be solved by expansion into an orthogonal set of
eigenfunctions of the static problem, as was done in Dulla et al. (2005), Dulla
(2005), and Pa´zsit and Jonsson (2011), or by the analytical solution used earlier in
this chapter both for the static case and for the transient problem. The latter way is
preferred because such a solution can be convoluted with the noise source to arrive
at analytical expressions for the induced neutron noise. The main task is again to
determine the roots of the characteristic equation, with the only difference to the
previous cases being that now not only some of the roots, but the equation itself
becomes complex. The details are described in Pa´zsit et al. (2012), here we shall
only restrict ourselves to present some quantitative results.
These are shown in Figs. 5.6 and 5.7. Fig. 5.6 shows the frequency dependence
of the amplitude of the Green’s function in the smaller system for various fuel
velocities. At the lowest velocity, the frequency dependence is the same as that of
the amplitude of the zero power transfer function G0(ω): a plateau at medium fre-
quencies, and an 1/ω behavior at low and high frequencies. At higher frequencies,
some multiple ripples appear. The frequencies where these appear correspond to the
inverse of the recirculation time of the fuel. With higher velocities, these appear at
higher frequencies. As will be shown shortly, it is these ripples which cannot be
reproduced by a solution of the point kinetic equations.
Fig. 5.7 shows the space dependence of the amplitude of the Green’s function in
the large system, for z0 5 H/2 and a frequency of ω 5 10 rad/s, which is in the mid-
dle of the plateau region, for a few different velocities. For u 5 0, that is a tradi-
tional reactor, the Green’s function is relatively localized and indicates substantial
deviation from the point kinetic behavior. For increasing fuel velocities, partly the

amplitude of the Green’s function increases, and partly its shape is changed towards
a more point-kinetic type behavior. The reasons for these effects were already
touched upon; the increase of the amplitude is due to the loss of neutrons decaying
from precursors outside the core, and the point kinetic behavior is due to the
increased neutronic coupling between various parts of the core, due to the fuel flow
and the movement of the precursors.
5.6
The point kinetic approximation and the point
kinetic component
In this section the point kinetic approximation of the spacetime-dependent MSR
equations and derivation of the point kinetic component of the neutron noise will
be discussed. This is yet another example where obvious, conceptual differences
between the physics of traditional solid fuel reactors and the MSR will be revealed.
5.6.1
Introduction
The point kinetic approximation is the simplest in the hierarchy of the various reactor
kinetic approximations (Bell and Glasstone, 1970). Historically, the interest in the
kinetic approximations arose because there was insufficient computer power to solve
full spacetime-dependent transient problems, especially to model large power
excursions. Moreover, many of the available measurements were made in small,
tightly coupled cores, where point-kinetic theory was expected to work fairly well.
In the late 1970s, the focus in reactor analysis was gradually shifting toward
large commercial power reactor systems, where space-dependent effects were to
play a much more significant role. Simultaneously, with the increase of computer

power, more and more involved spacetime-dependent calculations could be per-
formed. As a result, the point-kinetic approximation has lost its original value and
importance. Interestingly, however, the result of this approximation, i.e., the point
kinetic component of the dynamic response, and in particular the point kinetic com-
ponent of the neutron noise, kept its significance.
This is because with growing operational experience, the need for diagnostics of
spatially dependent perturbations, such as unfolding the noise source properties
(e.g., the position of a vibrating control rod or a channel blockage) arose. As it turns
out, to design an effective unfolding procedure for locating a noise source, as well
as to select optimum detector positions, it is useful to know the point-kinetic and
pure space-dependent components of the neutron noise separately. Hence, the
point-kinetic component of the induced neutron noise regained its significance in
reactor calculations. The main emphasis of the discussion here is, therefore, to
investigate the possibility of calculating the point-kinetic component in an MSR
separately from the space-dependent component.
The point kinetic equations are usually derived from the spacetime(energy)-
dependent diffusion or transport equations, with an assumption of factorizing the
spacetime-dependent flux into an amplitude factor P(t) which is only dependent
on time, and a normalized shape function ψ(r, t). This procedure is often referred to
as the “Henry factorization” (Pa´zsit and Demazie`re, 2010). The goal of the point
kinetic approximation is to derive the amplitude factor P(t) from a set of simplified
equations, which are obtained from the original spacetime-dependent equations
by a projection technique, i.e., integrating them with a weight function. In this pro-
cess the coefficients of the arising point kinetic equation for P(t) will depend on the
unknown shape function. However, this dependence can either be neglected by
replacing the shape function with the static flux or the static adjoint, or recalculat-
ing the shape function with time too, but with a substantially larger time-step.
As is described in Pa´zsit and Demazie`re (2010), the application of the point
kinetic approximation is particularly useful in reactor noise theory, because, due to
the use of linear (“first order”) theory, allowing the neglection products of fluctuat-
ing quantities, the coefficients of the point kinetic equation will no longer contain
the unknown shape function. In other words, the calculation of the amplitude and
the shape function decouples, and the coefficients of the point kinetic equation
become known constants.
Solution methods of the time-dependent equations of an MSR by way of the
reactor kinetic approximations of traditional reactors, have been extensively dis-
cussed in the literature (MacPhee, 1958; Lapenta et al., 2001; Dulla et al., 2004,
2005; Dulla, 2005; Zhang et al., 2009). As is described in these publications, due to
the different structure of the delayed neutron precursor equations for the MSR, the
mathematical procedure of deriving the point kinetic equations is different from that
of the traditional reactors. A modified, more involved form of the Henry factoriza-
tion procedure has to be used, in which both the flux and the delayed neutron pre-
cursors need to be factorized. In accordance with this, the projection of the flux and
the precursor equations requires two different weight functions, the static adjoints of
both the flux and the precursors, each used with the corresponding equation.
149
Kinetics, dynamics, and neutron noise in stationary MSRs

Nevertheless, the above only represents a technical complication which can be
handled. The more substantial problem, which became clear from the above investi-
gations, is that in an MSR, even in the case of small stationary fluctuations of the
neutron flux, the advantage of decoupling of the equations for the amplitude and
the shape function disappears. It turns out that neglecting second-order terms, the
point-kinetic parameters appearing in the point kinetic equations remain dependent
in first order of the fluctuations of the unknown shape functions. This means that
the correct solution (in first order) of the point kinetic equations requires simulta-
neous solutions for the shape functions, which will not be easier than the original
full equations; in fact, due to the factorization procedure, it will even be more com-
plicated. One can use various fixes to bring the point kinetic equations to a form
which is independent from the shape function, but these result in solutions which,
although not completely incorrect, do not reproduce some important features of the
correct point kinetic component.
The underlying reason for this difference between traditional systems and the
MSR is the contradiction between the propagating character included in the equation
(for the transport of the precursors) and the very concept of point-kinetic behavior.
The propagation incurs a nonseparable relationship between the spatial and temporal
coordinates. This is in conflict with point kinetics, which assumes that the space and
time dependence of the occurring functions can be factorized into a purely time- and
a purely space-dependent function. As a partial consequence, in an MSR, the fulfil-
ment of the adjoint property is possible only for the static quantities but cannot be
achieved for the time-dependent quantities, such as the dynamic adjoint.
Hence, the easiest way to obtain the point kinetic component of the neutron noise
is to first obtain the solution of the full spacetime (or rather, spacefrequency)-
dependent equations, and extract the point kinetic component with the same projec-
tion techniques as one uses for the derivation of the point kinetic equations.
Comparing the correct solution obtained that way with the solution of the “fixed”
point kinetic approximation will reveal the deficiencies of the latter.
In the rest of this section an outline of the derivations, with proofs of the above
statements will be given. For the details of the calculations the reader is referred to
Pa´zsit et al. (2014).
5.6.2
Derivation of the linearized point kinetic equations
The kinetic approximations are defined through factorizing the spacetime-depen-
dent flux into an amplitude function P(t) and a shape function ψ(x, t) as

Condition (5.132) makes the factorization unambiguous, but leaves a freedom in
selecting different forms for the weight function W(x). The choice of W(x) will
affect the actual form of the amplitude and the shape functions, as well as the struc-
ture of the equations for the amplitude function (the point kinetic equations) and for
the shape function. In traditional systems with stationary fuel, the usual choice is to
use the static adjoint as the weight function, i.e.,
@

φy
0ðxÞψðx; tÞdx 5 0:
(5.133)
This choice yields the traditional point kinetic equations, where the time evolu-
tion of the amplitude function P(t) is driven by the reactivity perturbations. Once
P(t) is found, the point kinetic component of the spacetime-dependent flux is
obtained by replacing the shape function with the static flux, i.e.,
φp:k:ðx; tÞ 5 PðtÞφ0ðxÞ:
(5.134)
Eq. (5.133) amounts to saying that the integral of the shape function and the
weight function is constant, and one is free to choose this constant to be

dent flux as

The objective of this section is to show that for an MSR, the fluctuations of the
amplitude factor can be obtained analytically by the above procedure, but there are
no point kinetic equations available which would yield the same solution.
The derivation of the point kinetic equation starts with the spacetime-depen-
dent diffusion equations used in the foregoing, which are rewritten here for

Since for the derivation of the point kinetic equations, both the flux and the
delayed neutron precursor density has to be factorized into an amplitude factor and
a shape function, the following factorization will be used:
φðx; tÞ 5 PðtÞψðx; tÞ;
(5.150)
and
Cðx; tÞ 5 CðtÞϕðx; tÞ:
(5.151)
Accordingly, for both shape functions one has to specify a normalization condi-
tion, for which the static adjoints will be used as weight functions:

(5.153)
With the above, the (nonlinearized) point kinetic equations can be derived by
substituting Eqs. (5.150) and (5.151) into Eqs. (5.137) and (5.138), multiplying the
resulting equations by the adjoint steady-state quantities φy
0ðxÞ and Cy
0ðxÞ, respec-
tively, integrating for the whole reactor and subtracting the adjoint Eqs. (5.145) and
(5.146) multiplied by ψ(x, t) and ϕ(x, t), correspondingly.
Then, define the fluctuations of the cross-sections as:
νΣf ðx; tÞ 5 νΣ0

However, our goal is to derive equations for the point kinetic component of the
neutron noise, which is obtained as the fluctuation of the amplitude function. Hence
we introduce the following linearization:

Then, using Eqs. (5.156)(5.159) in the time-dependent and the static equations,
neglecting the second-order terms and subtracting the static equations, the following
point kinetic equations can be obtained:

with A0 and E0 being constants (Pa´zsit et al., 2014).
The above equations clearly show the difficulties described in the introduction.
Although Eqs. (5.160) and (5.161) constitute a linear differential equation system
for δP(t) and δC(t) from which, after a Fourier transform, δP(ω) can easily be
expressed, this constitutes only a formal solution. As is seen, all functions in
Eqs. (5.162)(5.165) contain the fluctuations of the shape function in first order,
which hence cannot be neglected, and which are unknowns. Thus, the solution can-
not be calculated without making some assumptions about the unknown parameters.
One such approximation is discussed in the next subsection.
It can also be shown (for the details, see Pa´zsit et al., 2014), that the reason for the
presence of the first-order fluctuations of the shape function in the equations can be
traced back to the nondisappearance of one term in the derivation, which arises due
to the fact that the static adjoint does not fulfill the adjoint property with the time-
dependent flux. Expressed with the shape function, this arises from the equality

One can easily show from the boundary conditions for the precursors,
Eq. (5.140), reformulated to the shape function ϕ(x, t) that Q(t) is not zero, but it is

In other words the static adjoint operator does not have the adjoint property
against the time-dependent precursor distribution. It is also clear that if one replaces
the spacetime-dependent precursor distribution with the static one in (5.168),
Eq. (5.169) becomes identically zero. In the time-dependent case, for the shape
function, one obtains

Point kinetic equation with static fluxes
A straightforward way of deriving the point kinetic equations is to use the point
kinetic approximation to the shape functions, that is to replace ψ(x, t) and ϕ(x, t)
with the corresponding static fluxes φ0(x) and C0(x), that is to assume (Lapenta
et al., 2001)
φðx; tÞ 5 PðtÞφ0ðxÞ;
(5.171)
and
Cðx; tÞ 5 CðtÞC0ðxÞ:
(5.172)
In this case, the term Q(t) in (5.167) becomes zero, but this is at the price that
the boundary condition (5.140) cannot be fulfilled, since it would lead to
CðtÞC0ð2aÞ 5 Cðt 2 τLÞC0ðaÞe2λτL:

Kinetics, dynamics, and neutron noise in stationary MSRs

It is easy to show that in general this condition cannot be fulfilled and it cannot
be imposed on the resulting point kinetic equations. The absence of the boundary
conditions will be the reason for the absence of the characteristic structure of the
amplitude function in the frequency domain, which will be seen in the exact solu-
tion. The fact that the boundary condition cannot be fulfilled is the result of the pre-
viously mentioned fact that the propagation property and the factorization of the
space and time dependence are not compatible.
Turning now to the fluctuations of the amplitude functions, we split up the time-
dependent quantities into expectation and fluctuating parts as
PðtÞ 5 P0 1 δPðtÞ;
(5.174)
CðtÞ 5 C0 1 δCðtÞ:
(5.175)
In view of Eqs. (5.171) and (5.172) one can assume P0 5 1. The linearized point

It is seen that this solution contains a zero power transfer function whose fre-
quency dependence is exactly the same as that of the traditional systems. The only
difference is the appearance of an extra term in the expression of the reactivity.
This solution will not be able to reproduce the periodic peaks of the true solution,
which accounts for the return of the delayed neutron precursors to the core, and
which were already seen in Fig. 5.6.

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

However, this solution is the only one which can be concretely calculated, hence
it is the one which we will compare with the exact solution, derived from the full
spacetime (frequency)-dependent solution. It also has to be added that some
empirical modifications of the point kinetic equations were introduced to account
for this effect. For instance, in Lapenta et al. (2001) a term, similar in form to the
neglected term in our Eq. (5.169) but expressed only with the amplitude function,
was added. These do not supply a solution which is correct to the first order of the
perturbation (Pa´zsit et al., 2009).
5.6.4
Derivation of the point kinetic component
from the full solution
The fluctuations of the amplitude function can be determined from the full
spacefrequency-dependent solution by the Green’s function technique. Actually,
assuming
a
localized
perturbation
(in
the
form
of
a
spatial
Dirac-delta
function) the induced noise will be proportional to the Green’s function. Splitting
the spacetime-dependent quantities into a pure space-dependent mean value and
a spacetime-dependent fluctuating part, i.e.,
Σaðx; tÞ 5 Σa 1 δΣaðx; tÞ 5 Σa 1 δðx 2 x0Þ;

(5.184)
Following the usual steps of substituting Eqs. (5.181)(5.184) into (5.137) and
(5.138), subtracting the static equations, neglecting second-order terms such as δΣa
(x, t)δφ(x, t), and eliminating the equation for the precursor density by a temporal
Fourier transform, one arrives at the following matrix noise equations:

The solution to Eq. (5.187) can be obtained analytically, as described in the
previous subsection with the usual techniques. Now, using the factorization
(5.150)(5.151) with the linearization (5.156)(5.159), neglecting second-order
terms, one obtains for the neutron noise
δφðx; ωÞ 5 δPðωÞφ0ðxÞ 1 δψðx; ωÞ;
(5.188)
δCðx; ωÞ 5 δCðωÞC0ðxÞ 1 δϕðx; ωÞ:
(5.189)
Here the first term is the point kinetic component, and the second the space-
dependent one. In order to obtain the point kinetic components, both sides of
Eqs. (5.188)(5.189) are multiplied by the adjoint fluxes φy
0ðxÞ and Cy
0ðxÞ, respec-
tively. Then, integrating over the whole reactor and taking into account the normali-
zation conditions (5.152)(5.153), the following explicit expressions for δP(ω) and
δC(ω) can be obtained:

These can be calculated with the usual techniques.
The above expressions can be evaluated quantitatively, since they only contain
known quantities. The result can be compared with the solution (5.178) of the point
kinetic equations.
Such a comparison is shown in Fig. 5.8, which displays the two zero power reac-
tor transfer functions, i.e., the one calculated from the full spacefrequency solu-
tion (for simplicity we call it GExact
0
) and the one calculated from the point kinetic
equations (see Eq. (5.178), for simplicity we call it GApprox
0
). The function GExact
0
shows the characteristic peaks at frequencies equal to the inverse of the total recir-
culation time τL, as one can expect from the physics of the process. The solution
GApprox
0
is completely smooth and does not show any peaks. It can be mentioned that
to compensate for this deficiency of the simplified point kinetic equations, an
158
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

empirical form of the point kinetic equation was suggested in several publications
(Dulla, 2005; Zhang et al., 2009). These equations indeed lead to a transfer function
that has some minor peaks at certain frequencies. However, as was discussed in
Pa´zsit et al. (2009), neither the position, nor the amplitude of those peaks corre-
spond to the correct ones, given by the exact solution.
Another difference between the two transfer functions is that they differ by about
a factor of 2 at low frequencies, and are equal to each other only at higher frequen-
cies, from the upper part of the plateau region. This fact is due to the neglection of
first-order terms when calculating the coefficients of the point kinetic equation.
It is thus seen that for the molten salt reactor equations, the derivation of the
point kinetic equations for the neutron noise which supply results that are accurate
in first order, faces some difficulties. A linearization of the equations obtained by
the factorization technique leads to an equation in which certain terms contain the
fluctuations of the shape functions, which are not known. If these terms are
neglected, including the one which guarantees the fulfilment of the boundary condi-
tions for the delayed neutron precursors, the solution becomes inaccurate. This lat-
ter was shown by calculating the point kinetic component from the full
spacefrequency-dependent solution by projecting it to the static adjoint flux. This
shows that the molten salt reactor equations are not suitable to derive point kinetic
equations which yield the correct point kinetic component.

The neutron noise in an MSR, induced
by propagating perturbations
In traditional light-water reactors, the propagation of the coolant, through its non-
completely homogeneous structure, represents a perturbation which has the property
of propagating through the core. In pressurized water reactors (PWRs), the small

Kinetics, dynamics, and neutron noise in stationary MSRs

fluctuations of the inlet temperature, affecting, e.g., the absorption cross-sections,
represents a propagating perturbation whose effect on the neutron flux can be mea-
sured. Such propagating perturbations and their effect on the neutron noise were
studied before (Kosa´ly and Williams, 1971; Kosa´ly and Mesko´, 1972; Wach and
Kosa´ly, 1974). In these earlier works, the neutron noise was only calculated in the
point kinetic approximation. The space dependence was calculated only very
recently (Pa´zsit and Dykin, 2010). This interest was clearly triggered by the
renewed interest in molten salt reactors, in which such perturbations will be present
in a stronger form than in a PWR, since it will be the properties of the propagating
fuel that will have some random variations in contrast to those of the coolant in a
PWR. However, the neutronic response of the MSR will also be different, as we
have already seen at the level of the Green’s function. So the space-dependent neu-
tron noise due to propagating perturbations is interesting both in traditional reactors
and in the MSR.
The propagating perturbation can be represented as
δΣaðz; tÞ 5 δΣað0; t 2 z=uÞ;
(5.192)
and thus in the frequency domain one has
δΣaðz; ωÞ 5 e2iωz
u δΣað0; ωÞ:
(5.193)
Here the process δΣa(z 5 0, t), i.e., the perturbation at the inlet of the core, is
usually considered as a white noise process, so the frequency dependence of its
autospectrum is constant. This is often represented such that δΣa(0, ω) is taken as a
constant, although strictly speaking it is only valid for its autospectrum. This latter
is, however, calculated by the WienerKhinchin theorem as its own absolute value
squared, so the assumption of δΣa(0, ω) being constant does not lead to any contra-
dictions. Hence in the continuation we set δΣa(0, ω) 5 1.

where τc is the transit time of the fuel (coolant) through the core. This sink struc-
ture of the reactivity, which immediately affects the frequency dependence of the
induced neutron noise, especially in the case of point kinetic behavior, will be used
to interpret the results from the space-dependent calculations.

A few characteristic results will be shown for illustration. The frequency depen-
dence of the noise in a small system is shown in Fig. 5.9 as measured in the center
of the system. Such a small system is assumed to behave in a point kinetic manner
up to high frequencies (especially in the MSR which, as it was noticed, behaves
more point kinetically than a corresponding traditional system). Hence the resulting
noise shows the sink structure of the reactivity, modulated by the frequency depen-
dence of the transfer function, which is seen in Fig. 5.6. Also the ripples at low fre-
quency can be seen, although less visibly, due to the linear plot in the x-axis in this
figure. For the large system (Fig. 5.10), the situation is rather different. At low fre-
quencies, the ripples due to the fuel recirculation are still visible. However, the sink
structure at higher frequencies is rather different and less marked. Moreover, the
frequency dependence is different in different parts of the reactor, as is seen in the
figure which shows the noise in two different points of the reactor.
The diminishing of the sink structure is largely due to the less dominant contri-
bution from the point kinetic components, since it is only this component which has
the sink structure. The further deviations below the plateau frequencies can be
partly understood from the interference between the point kinetic and space-
dependent components of the induced noise, as was discussed in a companion
paper, dealing with the space-dependent effect of propagating perturbations in tradi-
tional reactors (Pa´zsit and Dykin, 2010). This interference arises from the fact that

the point kinetic component has a uniform phase across the whole core, whereas
the phase of the space-dependent term follows that of the perturbation. As seen
from (5.193), the phase of the latter is
ϕ 5 ω
u z;
i.e., it changes linearly with the position in the core. Hence the two components are
at certain points in-phase, and at some other points out-of-phase, leading to con-
structive and destructive interference, respectively. The result is the somewhat com-
plicated frequency behavior seen in Fig. 5.10.
Further insight can be gained by investigating the space dependence of the noise
for different frequencies. We show this space dependence in the large system at
four different frequencies. In Fig. 5.11A the space dependence is shown for a low
frequency. At this frequency the system behaves in a point kinetic manner, hence
the amplitude of the noise follows the shape of the static flux.
At the higher frequency of ω 5 10 rad/s (Fig. 5.11D), which is in the middle of
the plateau region, the space dependence suddenly shows local maxima and min-
ima, although the space dependence of both the point kinetic and the space-
dependent parts is smooth and similar to the static flux. As was mentioned before
and is discussed in detail in Pa´zsit and Dykin (2010), the maxima correspond to the
core positions where the point kinetic and space-dependent terms are in-phase, and
the local minima to the points where they are out-of-phase. The reason that no such
nonmonotonic behavior is seen at low frequency is partly that at lower frequency
the spatial oscillations of the phase of the space-dependent term are much slower,
and more importantly, the point kinetic component dominates and hence the inter-
ference has no effect. At the plateau frequency, shown in Figs. 5.11C,D, the point

kinetic component has decreased such that the two components are comparable in
amplitude. This is why the spatially oscillatory behavior of the noise is so marked.
At even higher frequencies, the point kinetic term decreases further, and the spatial
behavior becomes smooth again, because it is dominated by the space-dependent
component alone.
It is also interesting to make a comparison with traditional systems. As is shown
in Pa´zsit and Dykin (2010), in a traditional system of the same size, at the plateau
frequency, the noise is dominated by the space-dependent component, hence the
interference and the spatially oscillatory behavior of the noise is largely absent. It
can only be observed at much lower frequencies in the large system. The fact that
this interference of the two components exists at plateau frequencies in an MSR is
a further indication of the fact that an MSR behaves in a more point kinetic manner
than a corresponding traditional system.

Kinetics, dynamics, and neutron noise in stationary MSRs

5.8
Conclusions
As was seen, the physics and the dynamic behavior of an MSR comprises a number
of interesting new questions and results. The spatial redistribution of the precursors
and their partial decay outside the core has the effect that the noise level increases
in the system, and the spatial coupling becomes tighter, leading to an increase in
the contribution from the point kinetic component of the noise. While in a tradi-
tional power reactor the reactivity term is relatively insignificant at plateau frequen-
cies, in an MSR of comparable size the point kinetic term is still comparable with
the space-dependent one. This fact will influence the possibilities of the diagnostic
methods, such as localizing noise sources, etc. The observation on increased noise
amplitudes in an MSR has, by extrapolation, a relevance to all cores containing
minor actinides with smaller fractions of delayed neutrons, in that higher noise
amplitudes can be expected in all such systems.
It has to be emphasized that all deviations between a traditional system and an
MSR in this study are solely due to the movement of the fuel, and not to the differ-
ing material composition of an MSR. In this simple study the two systems were
compared by using similar material properties, to concentrate on the differences
that are only attributed to the movement of the fuel. Further differences may be
expected if the proper material properties of an MSR are taken into account, such
as a smaller delayed neutron fraction. In a core with a fast spectrum, the present
one-group treatment has to be replaced with a two-group approximation.

Introduction
Liquid-fueled molten salt reactors (MSRs) are usually considered nonclassical reactor
types because of the specific nature of the fuel, which is typically constituted by a mol-
ten fluoride salt mixture circulating in the primary circuit. The fission material (ura-
nium and/or transuranium elements) is dissolved in the molten salt carrier, which also
acts as coolant. Thanks to the potentialities of this liquid fuel, several MSR concepts
were investigated at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the past (see www.energy-
fromthorium.com/pdf/), and in recent years MSRs have been the subject of renewed
interest in the framework of Generation IV nuclear reactors (GIF, 2002, 2014; Serp
et al., 2014; IRSN, 2015). These concepts differ mainly by neutron balance (critical or
subcritical), neutron spectra (thermal, epithermal, or fast), the presence/absence of the
graphite matrix as moderator, and the fuel salt chemical composition.
The physics of circulating nuclear fuels involves a strong coupling between neu-
tronics and thermo-hydrodynamics, which would require in general the adoption of a

multiphysics modeling approach (e.g., see, Luzzi et al., 2012b, and also
Chapter 25, Research activities of this book). However, in this chapter, analyses
are performed assuming that the neutronic term is decoupled from fluid dynamics,
and appears like a heat source within the fuel/coolant molten salt. The aim is to
investigate only the thermo-hydrodynamic behavior. Reference is made to a
simple axial-symmetric cylindrical geometry representative of a typical graphite-
moderated MSR power channel, taking into account the thermodynamic and
transport properties of the molten salt as well as its local flow conditions and heat
transfer. Even if this assumption simplifies the equations to be solved, the thermo-
hydrodynamic behavior of the molten salt remains complex. In this context, a
preliminary analytic approach (Di Marcello et al., 2008) to evaluate the tempera-
ture radial profile in both fuel and graphite is reported in Sections 6.2 and 6.3,
which are intended to offer the reader a useful validation framework for testing
more sophisticated computer codes, in view of their adoption for more realistic
and complex 3-D geometry analyses.
The circulating valready moltenv fuel offers positive peculiarities to be
exploited in the safety approach as well as in the fuel cycle of liquid-fueled MSRs
(LeBlanc, 2010; Luzzi et al., 2012a; Kˇrepel et al., 2014). For instance, the fluid
nature of the fuel means that the reactor core meltdown is an irrelevant instance.
Moreover, the reactor has almost no excess of nuclear reactivity, which reduces
the risk of accidental reactivity insertion. On the contrary, the decay heat pro-
duced by the liquid fuel dissolved into the molten salt and distributed along a
closed loop may impair the natural circulation features, leading to an undesired
behavior of the reactor. Actually, natural circulation in the presence of internal
heat generation (IHG) is characterized by a particular dynamics that needs to be
carefully studied. In this context, Section 6.4 presents a preliminary investigation
of IHG effects on natural circulation, with reference to the stability maps of
single-phase rectangular loops.
6.2
Preliminary approach to thermo-hydraulics
of internally heated molten salts
This section presents a preliminary approach to the thermo-hydraulics of internally
heated molten salts useful to assess and compare the numerical solutions achievable
by different computer codes. Below, we have chosen for the computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) analyses a finite element software (COMSOL Multiphysics) and a
finite volume software (FLUENT). The validation framework adopts the well-
established analytic solution of flow in long smooth pipes, both in laminar and tur-
bulent regimes, and has been set up in analogy with other works performed for
innovative reactors, like the supercritical water reactor (Yang et al., 2007) and the
accelerator-driven system (Cheng and Tak, 2006). It can be also an “excellent
building-block case for testing turbulence models” (Wilcox, 2006), but such investi-
gation is outside the scope of the present section.

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

6.2.1
Analytic Framework for Validation Purposes
We refer to the analytic solution of the radial temperature profile, in the presence
of a volume-heat source within the fluid, for a circular-pipe system in cylindrical
coordinates (r, θ, z) in the case of both laminar and turbulent flow. The solution
was found by Poppendiek (1954) under the following assumptions:
G
Axial-symmetric conditions are taken into account.
G
Thermal and hydrodynamic patterns are established (long pipes).
G
Fluid axial conduction is neglected.
G
Steady state exists.
G
Uniform volume-heat source exists within the fluid.
G
Physical properties are not a function of temperature.
G
Heat is transferred uniformly to or from the fluid at the pipe wall.
G
In the case of turbulent flow, an analogy exists between heat and momentum transfer.
Under the above assumptions, the differential Eq. (6.1) and the boundary condi-
tions in Eqs. (6.2) and (6.3) describing the heat transfer in the pipe system for lami-
nar or turbulent flow can be written according to the following 1-D formulation:

q00


(6.2)
Tðr ¼ rDÞ ¼ TD
(6.3)
where T is the fluid temperature, function of the radial coordinate r; α, λ, ρ, and cP
are the thermal diffusivity, the thermal conductivity, the density and the specific heat
capacity of the fluid, respectively; ε is the fluid eddy diffusivity, function of both the
radial coordinate and the axial component of the fluid velocity u(r); um is the mean
fluid velocity; r0 is the pipe radius; qw and qvW are the volume-heat source and the
uniform wall-heat flux, respectively. The second boundary condition, expressed by
Eq. (6.3), is some reference temperature TD such as wall, center-line, or mixed-mean
fluid temperature (rD being the radial coordinate at which TD is evaluated).
As far as CFD simulations are concerned, steady-state conditions are considered
with reference to a 2-D axial-symmetric (r,z) computational domain. It is assumed
that the fluid is incompressible, homogeneous, and its physical properties are not a
function of temperature. Moreover, the action of gravity is neglected. For the analy-
ses in turbulent regime, the standard kε model has been selected, which is the
two-equation model most widely used as reference among the several turbulence
models available in the literature (Wilcox, 2006).
As for the modeling of the near-wall region, in the COMSOL simulations we
have adopted the logarithmic wall-functions, assuming that the computational
domain begins at a certain distance, which depends on the mesh size, from the real
wall. Instead, for FLUENT calculations, the enhanced wall treatment approach has
been chosen.
169
Thermal hydraulics of liquid-fueled MSRs

Great effort was spent in setting up the mesh elements/cells size, particularly at
walls and interfaces, by means of a mesh sensitivity analysis that is not reported
here for brevity. It must be noted that, even for the simple circular-pipe geometry
herein adopted as validation framework, the accuracy of numerical results depends
on the fluid properties, on the meshing strategy and on the turbulence model, as
clearly demonstrated by analogous studies performed for other fluids in the same
geometry (Cheng and Tak, 2006; Yang et al., 2007).
Concerning the numerical strategy, the segregated algorithm has been used in
both codes. A complete description of the fluid flow modeling and of the different
available options is given in the FLUENT and COMSOL user’s guides (COMSOL,
2007; FLUENT, 2005).
6.2.2
Laminar flow
The solution of the boundary-value problem defined by Eqs. (6.1), (6.2), and (6.3)
was achieved by Poppendiek (1954) in the case of laminar flow, considering that
the eddy diffusivity is null in laminar regime and the fluid velocity attains a para-
bolic profile along the pipe radius once the hydrodynamic pattern is established.
The solution is given by Eq. (6.4):

where TC is the center-line temperature and F ¼ 1 2 ð2q00
W=qwr0Þ, namely {1  fraction
of heat generated within moving fluid that is transferred at wall} (El-Wakil, 1978).
The dimensionless radial temperature profile given by Eq. (6.4) is plotted in
Fig. 6.1 for several values of the function F, and is compared with the CFD simula-
tion results obtained by means of COMSOL and FLUENT. As can be noticed, both
numerical solutions are practically superimposed on the analytic one.
6.2.3
Turbulent flow
For the case of turbulent flow, the boundary-value problem defined by Eqs. (6.1),
(6.2), and (6.3) can be separated into the following two simpler boundary-value pro-
blems, whose solutions can be superimposed to yield the solution of the “original
problem”:
1. A problem representing a flow-system with a volume-heat source, but with no wall-heat
flux.
2. A problem representing a flow-system without a volume-heat source, but with a uniform
wall-heat flux.
The solution for the first problem (1) was found by Poppendiek (1954) with the
following procedure. At first, the radial heat flux profile is calculated assuming that
the velocity profile may be satisfactorily represented by two regions (a laminar
170
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

layer and a turbulent core with the so-called “venerable” one-seventh power law for
the velocity; see Nikuradse, 1950; De Chant, 2005). Therefore, the radial heat flux
is replaced with simple monomials and polynomials, and is integrated layer by layer
(laminar sublayer, buffer layer, outer turbulent layer, and inner turbulent layer) to
find the radial temperature profile. The dimensionless radial temperature profile
turns out to be a function of both Reynolds (Re) and Prandtl (Pr) numbers
(Martinelli, 1947; Poppendiek, 1954).
The solution for the second problem (2) was originally found by Martinelli
(1947) assuming three layers (laminar sublayer, buffer layer, turbulent layer) for the
calculation of both the velocity and the temperature profiles. It is worth mentioning
that in the buffer and turbulent layer Martinelli preferred a logarithmic law for the
velocity based on experimental data (i.e., the so-called generalized velocity profile).
In the present work, we follow an alternative analytic solution based on the same
approach of Poppendiek, briefly described above for the problem (1), adopting the
one-seventh power law for the velocity and the same four layers of Poppendiek for
the radial temperature. The comparison between the Martinelli and the present
work approaches is shown in Fig. 6.2 in terms of the temperature difference with
respect to the center-line pipe temperature as a function of the dimensionless dis-
tance n from the pipe wall (n  1r/r0). The two approaches substantially agree
with little differences at lower Reynolds numbers and in the center of the pipe.
The temperature profile of the “original problem” can be easily achieved by
superimposing the temperature profiles of the problems (1) and (2). In Fig. 6.3,
results of the CFD analyses for the “original problem” are compared with the

analytical ones achievable following the Martinelli and the present work approaches
for the problem (2).
The numerical results in terms of velocity (Fig. 6.3A) and temperature
(Fig. 6.3B) profiles follow very well those provided by both analytic approaches,
which are very close to each other.
As for the velocity, numerical results provided by both codes are in good agree-
ment, whereas the analytical profiles show some little differences due to the model-
ing assumptions (i.e., logarithmic and one-seventh laws).
As far as the temperature is concerned, it must be pointed out that a more accu-
rate agreement can be found by means of FLUENT in the near-wall region thanks
to the enhanced wall treatment approach of the boundary layer.
6.3
Heat transfer and pressure losses
It is specific to graphite-moderated MSRs that, even if the energy from nuclear fis-
sions is predominantly released directly in the fuel, the graphite channels are
heated-up by the gamma and neutron radiation and the presence of this heat source
causes that in most cases the direction of radial temperature gradient is from the
fuel to the graphite. In other words, the liquid fuel practically cools down the graph-
ite in steady-state operation (Kˇrepel et al., 2005).
The investigation of the heat exchange properties between molten salt and graph-
ite is performed with reference to an axial-symmetric geometry representing a typi-
cal MSR core channel, idealized as a circular-pipe with circulating molten salt that
is surrounded by a hollow cylinder of graphite.
By coupling the analytic approach described in Section 6.2 for modeling the
fully developed flow of molten salt inside the pipe with the heat conduction prob-
lem for the graphite, it is possible to find the radial temperature profile in the chan-
nel (graphite + molten salt). The previous solutions (1) and (2) can be used for the
molten salt, while for the graphite the following radial profile is obtained solving
the 1-D heat conduction equation between the inner (Ri) and the outer (Ro) radii of
graphite:

where qwg and λg are the volume-heat source and the thermal conductivity of the
graphite, and Tw is the interface molten salt-graphite temperature. The heat flux at
the interface, qvW, is given by Eq. (6.6):

Thermal hydraulics of liquid-fueled MSRs

given by Eq. (6.6) and imposing the value of the volume-heat source in the molten
salt (qws) as well as in the graphite (qwg). In the next analyses, a ratio qwg/qws of
about of 3% is adopted (Mandin et al., 2005).
Once the radial temperature profile is known, it is possible to calculate analyti-
cally the Nusselt number as Nu = (Dh/λ)  qvW/(TW 2 Tb), and consequently the
heat transfer coefficient between the molten salt and the graphite as h = Nu  λ/Dh,
where Tb and Dh are the bulk (or mixed-mean) temperature of the molten salt and
the channel hydraulic diameter, respectively.
It must be pointed out that in the case of heat source within the fluid, the Nusselt
number is not only a function of Reynolds and Prandtl numbers, but also of the
ratio between the heat source and the wall heat flux (Poppendiek, 1954; Fiorina
et al., 2014).
Two different cases are considered for the CFD analyses: (I) no volume-heat
source within the molten salt; and (II) molten salt with volume-heat source. The
first case (whose results are shown for both the laminar and the turbulent flow) is
important not only for the above statement about the Nusselt number but also
because heat transfer properties of molten salt are of interest for its usage in the
intermediate-heat exchanger (Mandin et al., 2005). The second case is more repre-
sentative of a MSR core channel, and the respective results are shown for brevity
only in turbulent flow, which is expected to occur during reactor operating condi-
tions. For what concerns molten salt and graphite properties, MSR design specifica-
tions and the volume-heat sources, we refer to Mandin et al. (2005), while the most
important data are summarized in Table 6.1.

which are in very good agreement with the correlation given by Bird et al. as well
as with the analytical evaluation of the local Nusselt number (see also Table 6.2).
The friction pressure losses are numerically evaluated considering a parabolic pro-
file of the inlet velocity, and are compared in Table 6.2 with the classical Darcy
formula for the friction coefficient f in the Hagen-Poiseuille flow (i.e., f = 64/Re).
As can be noticed, a very good agreement exists.

results are compared to the analytic solution and those obtained with the standard

tions are given in Tables 6.3 and 6.4, respectively.

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

As a result, there is good agreement of the numerical evaluations of both the
Nusselt number and the temperature profiles with those obtained analytically. The
well-known Dittus-Boelter correlation can be used for molten salt (El-Wakil,
1978; Mandin et al., 2005) giving a reasonable result in the case of no heat source
with a discrepancy of 4% in comparison with the analytic solution, but it should
be used carefully in the presence of a heat source within the fluid because it does
not take into account the dependence of heat transfer on the ratio between wall
heat flux and volume-heat source. As a consequence, the heat transfer coefficient
could be excessively overestimated (see Table 6.3). This last issue has been the
subject of several works (e.g., Di Marcello et al., 2010; Luzzi et al., 2010, 2012a;
Fiorina et al., 2014), to which the reader is referred. Here, we just retrieve
from Fiorina et al. (2014) an example concerning the core channels of the Molten
Salt Breeder Reactor (Robertson, 1971). As can be noticed in Fig. 6.6, traditional
correlations (Dittus and Boelter, 1930; Sieder and Tate, 1936; Gnielinski, 1976; Bin
et al., 2009; Yu-ting et al., 2009) predict a higher Nusselt number compared to the
correlation proposed by Di Marcello et al. (2010) that takes into account the volume-
heat source in the molten salt. This leads to an underestimation of the graphite temper-
ature, whose importance depends also on the channel diameter and the strength of heat
source in the fuel.
A good agreement can be found between the numerical evaluations of the pres-
sure losses and the well-known McAdams correlation (see Table 6.4).

Thermal hydraulics of liquid-fueled MSRs

As a general comment on the analyses presented in this section, we can observe
that the numerical results provided by COMSOL and FLUENT codes are close to
each other in terms of temperature profiles, Nusselt number, and pressure losses.
Some differences have been found, which are related to the choice of different tur-
bulence models, but it is not the aim of this chapter to enter into such details.
Moreover, the influence of the volume-heat source on the heat transfer properties
may be relevant at low Reynolds numbers, and needs to be carefully taken into
account.

Analytical, numerical, and experimental studies on the stability and transient behav-
ior of single-phase natural circulation loops (NCLs) have been performed in recent
years by several authors. An overview can be found in Misale (2014). However, all
these works performed the analysis of NCLs with localized hot and cold heat sinks,
mainly focusing on the influence of the loop geometry on natural circulation
instabilities, while the instance of an internal and distributed power source inside
the system has been little investigated. In this regard, the first studies have been
conducted by Pini et al. (2014), Ruiz et al. (2015), Pini et al. (2016), and Cammi
et al. (2016b). Referring the reader to these two studies for a detailed description of
the methods developed for the stability analysis, as well as of the main modeling
assumptions adopted, hereafter the main results are summarized. They are
expressed in terms of dimensionless stability maps, which are a compact way to
describe the dynamic behavior of a given system.
Reference is made to the two vertical loop configurations with constant diameter
D shown in Fig. 6.7 that can be characterized by large instability regions, namely
the HHHC (horizontal heaterhorizontal cooler) and the VHHC (vertical heater
horizontal cooler) loops.
Their geometrical features (Vijayan et al., 2007) are given in Table 6.5. A single
cooling section (called cooler) is considered, and is modeled as a constant wall tem-
perature heat exchanger, while two heat sources can be taken into account. The first
is a localized external heater (called heater), and is treated as a localized heat flux
(LHF) source, qv. The second represents the heat generation inside the fluid (e.g.,
the circulating fuel in MSRs), and is modeled as a homogeneous distributed volu-
metric source, qw. The fluid flow is considered one-dimensional along the curvilin-
ear coordinate s (adopted to describe the position inside the loop), and it is assumed
that the same flow regime (laminar, laminar turbulent transition, or fully turbulent)
exists in the whole loop.
For comprehension of the stability maps, which are obtained by perturbing
the system equilibrium, the following steady-state quantities are to be defined: the

temperature variation due to the external heat flux in the heater section (ΔTqv), and
the temperature variation of the fluid induced by the internal generation outside

entrance), P and A are the perimeter and the cross-section area of the pipes, respec-
tively, Lh is the heater length, Lc is the cooler length, and Lt is the total length of
the loop. At this point, it is also possible to define the total temperature variation
outside the cooler (ΔTtot), the ratio α between ΔTqv and ΔTtot, and the modified

where St0 is the Stanton number, Nu0 the Nusselt number, Re0 the Reynolds num-
ber, Pr0 the Prandtl number, h0 is the convective heat transfer coefficient, and the
subscript 0 indicates steady-state values. The α ratio can assume all values between
0 and 1. For α = 1, there is only the localized external heat source (conventional
natural circulation). For α = 0, only a homogeneously distributed IHG is present in
the system. An example of steady-state distribution, both for α = 1 and α = 0, is
shown in Fig. 6.8. This parameter has a great influence on the NCL dynamic behav-
ior, because a variation of α directly implies a change in the ratio between the heat
produced by the LHF in the heater and the distributed IHG. When α is changed, the
same system can experience stable or unstable natural circulation flow regimes.
Actually, as will be shown, the stability maps strongly depend on α.

and α = 1 (conventional natural circulation).

Another important parameter, generally not considered in the literature, but
affecting the dynamic behavior of the system as well, is herein denoted B. It reads:
B ¼ G0

(6.13)
The parameter B has been evaluated in Pini et al. (2016), to which we refer for
details, and has the trend shown in Fig. 6.9 for different values of the Prandtl num-
ber. It represents the variation of convective heat transfer coefficient due to mass
flux perturbations. If B is equal to zero, this relation is not taken into account, and
the heat transfer coefficient h is treated as a fixed parameter at the steady state
value (h0), by neglecting its dependence on the mass flow rate (and hence on the
Reynolds number).
Given the above definitions of the α and B parameters, we can now summarize
some significant results in terms of stability maps for the two considered loop con-
figurations. Natural circulation may occur at different flow regimes, from the lami-
nar to the turbulent, depending on the thermal power given to the system. The
steady-state condition is reached when a dynamic equilibrium is established
between the buoyancy and the frictional effects. This equilibrium can be stable or
unstable. In the last case, the instabilities can lead to large pulsations in the fluid

flow rate and to unwanted behavior of the system. For a given loop configuration
and a given value of α, in a Re versus Stm diagram, the geometrical locus of the
points for which the mass flux remains constant (after the perturbation of the steady
state) sets a boundary separating the couples (Re0, Stm0) for which the equilibrium
is asymptotically stable from those for which the equilibrium is unstable. This is
the definition of the stability map.
As already mentioned, IHG can significantly modify the dynamic behavior of
natural convection loops. Fig. 6.10 shows the stability maps of the HHHC and
VHHC systems for B = 0 (fixed heat transfer coefficient), from α = 1 (only local-
ized external heating) to α = 0 (only IHG). As can be noticed, the unstable regime
increases when IHG is present.
The HHHC loop configuration represents a very critical situation since, for any
value of α, it always remains a symmetric system (see Fig. 6.7A), and therefore the
fluid does not have any preferable flowing direction. When B 6¼ 0 (see Fig. 6.11A),
the heat exchange varies with the mass flux perturbation and induces a strong stabili-
zation. This effect is larger in the range of Reynolds numbers for which the value of
B is higher (see Fig. 6.9). Moreover, the stabilization becomes stronger as the fraction
of the power given by the internal generation increases (from α = 1 to α = 0). Since
the influence of the volumetric heat generation is small, the effect of B is able to
reverse the stability behavior of the system for laminar-turbulent transition and fully
turbulent zones (where B is bigger compared to the laminar zone, as Fig. 6.9 shows).
Hence, the system is more stable for α = 0 than for α = 1 when Re . 2500.
The behavior of the VHHC configuration is completely different with respect to
the previous case. As a matter of fact, when the power is given by the localized
heater (α = 1), the flow has a preferred direction for its motion, that is the clock-
wise one (see Fig. 6.7B). On the contrary, as α becomes zero, the loop progres-
sively acquires a symmetric configuration and hence the system becomes more
unstable. The destabilization induced by the IHG is so marked (see Fig. 6.10B) that
Figure 6.10 Stability maps of HHHC (A) and VHHC (B) loops for various IHG levels. The
effect of heat exchange is neglected (B = 0). Stable and unstable regions are on the right and
on the left of the curves, respectively.
182

the case of α = 0 remains the most unstable also considering the heat exchange
effect (see Fig. 6.11B).
Fig. 6.11 clearly shows that the overall effect of the B parameter is that of stabi-
lizing the system dynamics. This can be explained as follows. If the mass flux oscil-
lations increase, the convective heat transfer in the cooler is enhanced. Since the
power given to the system is constant, when the heat exchange increases, the mean
temperature difference between hot and cold legs of the loop becomes smaller. The
final consequence of this mechanism is the weakening of the buoyancy force, which
is induced by the density variation caused by the nonuniform temperature field.
To summarize, it has been found that IHG combined with heat exchange effect
can induce a stabilization or a destabilization of the system dynamics depending on
its action on the loop symmetry. For the HHHC loop, which presents a perfect axial
symmetry for every value of α, IHG together with the heat transfer phenomena
induces a stabilization. On the other hand, for the VHHC loop, which does not have
any symmetry for α = 1, IHG combined with the heat exchange effect causes a
destabilization because it increases the symmetry of the loop. By considering the
two effects in a separate way, the heat exchange (B 6¼ 0) acts on the system oscilla-
tions with a negative feedback, whose influence increases as the fluid IHG becomes
larger. On the contrary, the volumetric power source destabilizes the system.
We believe that it is fundamental to validate the predictions of the presented sta-
bility maps with experimental data. To this purpose, the DYNASTY testing facility
(currently under construction at the Politecnico di Milano) can give a fundamental
support (Cammi et al., 2016a), also providing useful information on some effects
that were not discussed in this work, such as nonuniform power generation, cross-
stream temperature gradients effects, and nonuniformity of the fluid parameters.
The acquired knowledge will constitute the background necessary for understanding
how the decay heat distributed along the primary circuit of an MSR can modify the
dynamics of natural circulation, potentially leading to dangerous behavior of the

reactor. Such an occurrence needs to be carefully avoided through an appropriate
design based on the outcomes of the planned investigations. In other words, the
study of the dynamic behavior of natural circulation with IHG is important in order
to achieve high levels of intrinsic safety, which is one of the pillars of the
Generation IV International Forum.
6.5
Conclusions
In this chapter, a preliminary approach to thermo-hydraulics of a typical (graphite-
moderated) MSR channel has been presented, by assuming that the neutronic prob-
lem is decoupled from fluid dynamics and referring to a simple axial-symmetric
geometry. Some relevant aspects of this system, featured by a heat source within
the fuel/coolant molten salt, have been analyzed. In particular, a validation frame-
work has been proposed in order to test different computer codes. In the presented
analyses, we have adopted COMSOL and FLUENT, whose numerical results in
terms of temperature profiles and pressure losses turned out to be very close to each
other, and substantially in good agreement with the analytical solutions and data
given by empirical correlations. However, more detailed analyses are required in
the case of more complex and design-oriented geometries, taking into account the
effects concerning the geometry itself, the influence of the volume-heat source on
the heat transfer, and the choice of both the mesh structure and the turbulence
model. For this purpose, the strong coupling between neutronics and thermo-
hydraulics, which is a specific and intrinsic feature of liquid-fueled MSRs, needs to
be considered as well.
The presented results on the natural circulation stability, although preliminary,
have clearly shown that the behavior in the presence of IHG is characterized by a
particular dynamics. Actually, system equilibria that are asymptotically stable for
NCLs with conventional LHF can become unstable when IHG is present. The sta-
bility maps have proved that IHG, when it dominates the localized external heat
source, can modify the shape and area of the stability regions. These findings con-
tribute to the development of the natural circulation modeling, introducing physical
phenomena previously neglected, and suggest that IHG effects should be taken into
account when designing convective loops with internally heated fluids. As far as
future developments are concerned, the influence of the thermal properties of the
pipe walls are currently under investigation at Politecnico di Milano, and loop con-
figurations featured by significant 3-D effects and with different positions of the
localized heater and of the cooling section will be considered as well.

Molten salt
Molten salt is a liquid, which is in general a melted chemical compound of acid and
alkali at high temperature. As is shown in Fig. 7.1, it is transparent and looks like
water, but it does not contain water. There are thousands of molten salts, because
they are combinations of acid and alkali, and besides that, some acid/alkali/oxides
can be molten salts. For more basic understanding on molten salt thermodynamics in
a molten salt reactor (MSR), Benes and Konings (2013) is recommended.
As is explained in Chapter 11.1, Development of molten salt reactor at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), they selected molten salt fuel, because it is
chemically stable and inert; it can be used at very low pressure owing to its very
high boiling temperature and very low vapor pressure; and it can dissolve most
nuclear materials such as uranium (U) and thorium (Th). Since most molten salts
have high melting temperature, if leakage of molten salt occurs, it will freeze and
not release radioactive materials (Briant and Weinberg, 1957).
Among many molten salts, ORNL finally proposed an eutectic mixture of lith-
ium fluoride and beryllium fluoride called “FLiBe” (LiF-BeF2), with fertile Th and
fissile U or plutonium (Pu) dissolved as molten fluoride salts (ThF4, UF4, PuF3).

This liquid serves as a fuel element, as a heat transfer medium, and as a fuel proces-
sing medium. Each of these functions is described below.
1. Molten salt as a liquid fuel element
In MSR fissionable isotopes, fertile isotopes, most fission products (FPs), and
heavy elements reside as ionic elements dissolved in molten salt. When fission
reactions occur in the core, molten salt is heated and it circulates through pumps,
heat exchangers, and then returns back to the core. Fission reactions occur mainly
in the core for thermal neutron spectrum MSR, because the reactor can keep criti-
cality only when a neutron moderator, such as graphite, is present.
For solid fuel reactors, there is a mechanical limitation due to radiation damage
on fuel pellets and cladding tubes, internal pressure due to accumulated gaseous
FPs, fuel pellet swelling, oxidation of cladding tube, and so on. Also, there is
another limitation due to depletion of fissile material. Due to these effects, periodic
replacement of fuels is required for solid fuel reactors.
In molten salt fuel, however, there is no radiation damage, because it is an ionic
liquid and not significantly affected by neutron or gamma irradiation. It is easy to
adjust molten salt composition by adding molten salt containing fissile U/Pu or fer-
tile Th in order to maintain an optimum fuel composition.
An important advantage of liquid fuel is that radioactive gases produced as FP
can be removed from liquid fuel. In solid fuels, radioactive gases such as xenon
(133Xe/135Xe/137Xe/138Xe) and krypton (85Kr/87Kr/88Kr/89Kr) are accumulated
within cladding tubes, and they are released in severe accident conditions, such as
the Fukushima accident.
Among these nuclides, 135Xe has a very large neutron absorption cross-section,
and it deteriorates neutron economy during normal operation. For this reason, addi-
tional shutdown reactivity is required to override xenon reactivity change in a light

water reactor (LWR), because 135Xe decays with a half-life of 9 hours. Also, the
xenon oscillation issue must be considered for pressurized water reactors (PWR)
(Iodine Pit Issue, 2015).
But, in liquid fuels, these gases are insoluble in molten salt. Therefore, they can
be removed from molten salt, and captured by a charcoal filter system, then stored
for enough decay periods. Removal of 135Xe makes load-following capability eas-
ier, and also removes the above xenon oscillation issue. In order to accelerate
removal of radioactive gases, a helium (He) gas bubble injection system was pro-
posed in the Molten salt breeder reactor (MSBR) design, and this system collects
radioactive gases efficiently (Gabbard, 1972).
Molten salt can dissolve fissile and fertile materials. It is chemically stable and
inert, and especially it can be used at very low pressure owing to its very high boil-
ing temperature and very low vapor pressure. Normal operating pressure for an
MSR is 0.5 MPascal (5 atm.), which is very low compared with 15 MPa (about
150 atm.) for a PWR. In addition, this low pressure returns back to 0.1 MPa
(1 atm.) atmosphere pressure, when the molten salt pump stops. This low pressure
reduces the danger of reactor vessel breakage or pipe breakage due to high pressure,
such as in the LWR case. Higher temperature brings higher thermal efficiency of
the plant. Outlet temperature of MSR is typically as high as 700C, compared with
330C in the PWR case. Liquid fuel design does not need fuel manufacturing such
as a solid fuel case. These features make reactor design simple and economical.
ORNL chose a fuel salt based on 7LiF-BeF2 (FLiBe), and NaBF4-NaF as a sec-
ondary coolant. The properties of these molten salts are summarized in an ORNL
report (Cantor, 1968). Some of them, compared with other molten salts and liquid
Na (sodium), are shown in Table 7.1.
Molten fluoride salts are intrinsically noncorrosive to constituent elements in
containment alloys, primarily because of greater thermodynamic stability of molten
fluoride salt constituents as compared with fluorides of transition metals (Sohal
et al., 2010). Compatibility to structure materials is discussed later.
As is shown in this table, FLiBe has an appropriate melting temperature, good
viscosity, and a very high boiling temperature of 1430C (Ingersoll et al., 2005).
FLiBe has a low neutron absorption cross-section, but natural Li will probably
be enriched to .99.9% 7Li, because natural Li includes 7.42% of 6Li, which has a
large neutron absorption cross-section and generates tritium. The 6Li is desired for
fusion reactor blankets.
The Be in FLiBe is chemically toxic. In reactors, the fuel salt is radioactive and
is enclosed within the primary loop. If there were a leak, it would freeze (solidify)
to glassy material below its melting temperature. Therefore, there would be almost
no release of Be or radioactive materials in an accidental situation.
2. Molten salt as heat transfer medium
Thermo-physical properties of molten FLiBe in Table 7.1 indicate that FLiBe
has superior characteristics as a heat transfer medium. Such excellent characteristics
are based on
191
Materials

1. Low pressure;
2. High boiling temperature;
3. High heat capacity (due to small ions);
4. Appropriate viscosity;
5. Suitable Prandtl number.
The Prandtl number of FLiBe is 1020 in temperature range of 700500C,
which is much higher than that of liquid Na (Pr = 0.004), and it means that FLiBe
is a relatively adiabatic liquid. This fact mitigates a thermal shock during quick,
inadvertent temperature changes. Also, the heat-transfer per unit pumping power
has the highest value for FLiBe of all the materials in Table 7.1.
3. Molten salt as fuel reprocessing medium
Today, most spent fuel reprocessing is a hydrometallurgical process called
PUREX (Plutonium and Uranium Recovery by EXtraction). This process uses
organic solvent extraction from aqueous solutions, which result from dissolution of
spent fuel. On the other hand, recent reprocessing, which does not use water or
organic liquids, is called pyro-reprocessing or dry-reprocessing. In this process, sol-
vents are molten salts such as LiCl-KCl, and molten metals such as cadmium or bis-
muth are used. Since this process does not use water or organic liquids, there is less
danger of a criticality accident. In aqueous systems, concentration of fissile materials

must be diluted in order to avoid a criticality accident, because they contain hydrogen
or carbon, which is a good neutron moderator and could cause criticality. Therefore,
a dry-reprocessing plant can be more compact than a PUREX plant.
For MSRs there are two cases.
G
On-line reprocessing as for the MSBR;
G
Off-site reprocessing like the Denatured Molten Salt Reactor (DMSR) or MSR-FUJI
concept.
In any case the reprocessing medium is FLiBe, which is the same as MSR fuel
salt.
Dry-reprocessing technology for molten salt fuel was proposed and developed
during the MSBR development in the 1970 s at ORNL. They proposed on-line fuel
reprocessing of fuel salt. This system consists of two parts:
G
Removal of uranium (U) and protactinium (Pa) from fuel salt and reintroduction of U to
fuel salt;
G
Removal of rare-earth FPs from fuel salt (Alexander et al., 1959).
For off-site reprocessing, the above concept can also be applied. The FREGAT
technology, which was developed by Czech and in Russia, is applying a fluoride vol-
atility process based on separation of U and Pu in the form of volatile fluoride from
FPs, the majority of which are nonvolatile fluorides. This process was originally
developed to reprocess fast breeder reactor (FBR) spent fuels, but it can also be
applied to LWR fuels (Uhlir et al., 2002; Uhlir and Marecek, 2009). A recent study
was compiled with other technologies in an IAEA report (IAEA, 2010). Reprocessing
of MSR fuels is described in detail in Chapter 8, Chemical processing of liquid fuel.
In summary, molten salts, especially FLiBe, have many excellent features, such
as a low neutron absorption cross-section (if 6Li is removed), no radiation damage,
large heat capacity, low vapor pressure, single-phase liquid, appropriate melting
temperature, high boiling temperature, chemical inertness, good compatibility with
structural material, compatibility with graphite, high solubility for U, Pu, and Th
fluorides and FPs, no solubility for gaseous FPs such as Xe and Kr, and very lim-
ited radioactivity release in accidents.
7.2
Solid fuels with molten salt coolants
In a solid fuel reactor the allowable fuel burnup and lifetime are limited by:
G
Fuel pellet swelling;
G
Internal pressure from gaseous FPs;
G
Clad thermal stress, creep, and corrosion;
G
Clad radiation damage;
G
Depletion of fissile material.
Therefore, periodic replacement of fuels is required.
Solid fuels used with molten salt coolants are similar to those used with
water-cooled reactors, but the clad must be compatible with molten salts at high
193
Materials

temperatures. This type of fuel is described in Chapter 13, Solid fuel, salt-cooled
reactors.
7.3
Thorium fuel cycle
The thorium fuel cycle has unique features compared with the current uranium-
plutonium fuel cycle:
1. More abundant resources;
2. Small production of plutonium and minor actinides;
3. Possibly better proliferation resistance (see Chapter 10, Non-proliferation and safeguards
aspects of the MSR fuel cycle);
4. Can be a breeder with thermal neutrons.
MSRs are the most appropriate reactors for the thorium fuel cycle, because
breeding (self-sustaining fuel supply) is possible even in thermal neutron spectrum
MSRs with thorium fuel. The combination of MSRs and the thorium fuel cycle was
developed at ORNL in the 1960s.
Thorium is a fuel source material (fertile material), from which 233U fuel is
made by neutron absorption, so we speak of a “thorium fuel cycle,” rather than
“thorium fuel.” Advantages of thorium fuel and of liquid fuels are discussed in
Chapter 1, Introduction.
The properties of thorium, its minerals, abundance, and estimated resources are
described in Chapter 9, Environment, waste, and resources.
Since thorium is not fissile, we need an initial MSR fuel load containing fissile
material (233U produced elsewhere, 235U, or 239Pu). The initial fissile material may
be from low enriched uranium (LEU), from LWR spent fuel, from an accelerator-
driven system (see Chapter 15: Accelerator driven systems), or from a fusionfis-
sion hybrid (see Chapter 16: Fusion-fission hybrids). Proliferation resistance issues
of the thorium fuel cycle are discussed in Chapter 10, Non-proliferation and safe-
guards aspects of the MSR fuel cycle.
7.4
Moderators
Fission reaction cross-sections are highest at low energies, and neutrons emitted by
fission must undergo many collisions with materials to slow down from MeV ener-
gies to thermal energies (B 0.025 eV). For example, the average number of colli-
sions required to slow down in various media is shown in Table 7.2.
Besides the neutron slowing down, neutron absorption must be considered. For
example, deuterium (2H, or D) absorbs neutrons much less than ordinary hydrogen
(1H), so that the moderating efficiency of D2O is better than that of H2O.
Therefore, as a figure of merit of moderator, a moderating ratio (MR) is defined,
which is slowing down power divided by absorption cross-section
194
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

MR ¼ ξΣs=Σa
(7.1)
where ξ is the average change of the logarithm of the neutron energy per collision.
As a potential moderator for MSR, ORNL investigated about 150 materials that
could be used at high temperature (Lundy et al., 1960). They concluded that beryl-
lium and carbon (graphite) have the highest MR among 150 candidates. Some are
shown in Table 7.2, along with that of water and heavy water. Water was not con-
sidered as moderator in the above ORNL study, because it requires very high pres-
sures at high temperatures, as in water-cooled reactors (see Section 11.1).
7.4.1
Graphite
Graphite is an important component in a thermal neutron spectrum MSR core, serv-
ing as a neutron moderator and reflector. Since graphite is irradiated and is in con-
tact with the fuel salt, there are several requirements.
1. Prevention of fuelgraphite interactions
If fuel salt penetrates into graphite, fission reactions cause additional radiation damage
to graphite. But, since molten salt does not wet graphite, this can be easily prevented by
manufacturing a pore-diameter of graphite less than 1 3 1026 m, owing to the surface ten-
sion of molten salt.
2. Prevention of Xe and Kr absorption by graphite
FP 135Xe has a large neutron absorption cross-section, which hurts the neutron econ-
omy of the core. It should be allowed to bubble out of the molten salt, instead of being
trapped in the graphite. We could seal the graphite surface with cladding of pyro-carbon,
SiC, or metal. This could be augmented by using an He-bubble injection system to extract
the Xe and Kr efficiently from the molten salt.

3. Irradiation stability
When graphite is irradiated, it shows shrinkage at first, and then volume expansion
(swelling) begins. E . 50 keV was proposed as 3 3 1022 neutrons/cm2, where the volume
returns back to an initial value, as shown in Fig. 7.2 (Rosenthal, 1972). This value can be
applied to a thermal neutron spectrum MSR. (Fast-spectrum MSRs would use very little
or no graphite.) This radiation limit may require periodic replacement of graphite compo-
nents, which could be in various removable shapes, such as plates, rods, or balls.
4. Heat removal from the graphite
Since graphite is heated by gamma energy and by the neutron slowing down, its heat
must be evaluated. Although its heat is several percent of the heat in fuel salt, its heat would
affect the thermal-hydraulic design of the MSR and the irradiation stability of graphite.
When graphite is irradiated, it shows shrinkage at first, and then volume expan-
sion (swelling) begins. In the MSBR design, a fluence limit of fast neutrons
(E . 50 keV) was proposed as 3 3 1022 neutrons/cm2, where the AXF (Industrial
grade graphite from Poco Graphite Inc.) volume returns back to an initial value, as
shown in Fig. 7.2 (Rosenthal, 1972). This value can be applied to a thermal neutron
spectrum MSR. (Fast spectrum MSRs would use very little or no graphite.) This
radiation limit may require periodic replacement of graphite components, which
could be in various removable shapes, such as plates, rods, or balls.
7.4.2
Beryllium
Beryllium (Be) is an excellent neutron moderator and reflector. It can serve as
“neutron multipliers” through (n,2n) reactions by incident fast neutrons. Fig. 7.3
shows the cross-section for (n,2n) reactions in Be.
On the other hand, Be is toxic, generates helium through (n,α) reactions by fast
neutrons, and has resource limitations. As a moderator or reflector of reactors, Be-

oxide (BeO) is used. Ceramic BeO can be handled safely, and was used in the
Aircraft Reactor Experiment (ARE) at ORNL (see Section 11.1). Be12Ti and Be12V
are being studied for fusion reactor blankets.
7.4.3
Lithium
Natural lithium (Li) is composed of two isotopes; 7.42% 6Li and 92.6% 7Li. Since
6Li has a large absorption cross-section (about 940 barns for thermal neutrons) and
generates tritium and helium, natural lithium is not appropriate as a moderator.
Also, metallic Li has a low melting temperature, and 7Li2O or other compounds
were candidates as solid moderators (Lundy et al., 1960).
As described below, 7LiF is used as a typical component of fuel salt in MSR.
But, 7Li has a small capture cross-section for fast neutrons and it also produces
some tritium.
Tritium is a beta-emitter with a half-life of 12.4 years, average energy 6 keV,
maximum energy 18 keV. For safety reasons the tritium inventory in MSRs should
be minimized. Fig. 7.4 shows the tritium production cross-sections of 6Li and 7Li
vs. neutron energy. Additional cross-section data are available in BNL-325 (Garber
and Kinsey, 1976).
In order to avoid thermal neutron capture in 6Li, MSRs could enrich 7Li by
removal of 6Li. (In fusion reactor designs the opposite is true: It is desirable to max-
imize tritium breeding by using more 6Li and less 7Li.)
Lithium may be enriched by several processes:
G
Column exchange (Colex)—LiH counter-flows through an amalgam of Li/Hg. Li-6 tends
to stay in the Hg and migrate towards the bottom of the column, and the Li-7 tends to go
with the LiH towards at the top. The bottom part is electrolyzed to separate the slightly
enriched Li-6 and the top part is electrolyzed to separate the Li-7 fraction, in multiple

Materials

stages. Western countries do not use this method, in order to avoid toxic Hg
contamination.
G
Vacuum distillation—Lithium is heated to about 550C in a vacuum. Lithium vapor is
collected on a cold surface. Li-6 atoms have greater mobility and are collected preferen-
tially. A multistage process would be used.
G
Atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS)—A laser can be tuned to selectively ionize
Li-6 or Li-7, which can then be separated by an electric field.
G
Crown ether method—A water-insoluble solvent containing crown ethers is added to an
aqueous mixture of LiCl. After the crown ethers distribute in the two solvent layers and
form complexes, the Li-6 can be found preferentially in the solvent phase, with a separa-
tion factor per stage about 1.042 for Benzo15-crown5 (Ault et al., 2012).
“A predicted cost for 90% enriched Li-6 is about $2500/kg (2013 $), and
the JASON report (2011) cited $1500/kg. In 2010, the estimated price for
Chinese enriched Li-7 was $15,000/kg for 99.99% enrichment level. Since prices
for 99.92% enriched lithium were not found, the price was estimated to be
roughly in the $10,000/kg range (taken from the higher enrichment prices)” (Ault
et al., 2012).

Structural materials
7.5.1
Requirements for good structural materials
Some requirements for good structural materials are:
G
High-temperature operation for long durations;
G
Adequate strength at elevated temperature;
G
Corrosion resistance;
G
Weldability;
G
Low activation for waste disposal;
G
Creep resistance;
G
Good ductility after irradiation;
G
Fatigue resistance;
G
Minimal tritium retention;
G
Established.
Most of these requirements apply to any nuclear use of metal alloys, however
the requirement which is especially challenging for MSRs is corrosion.
This is because corrosion in molten salts is a fundamentally different process
from that in conventional applications, and most of the methods to control corrosion
developed over previous centuries are of limited value.
Corrosion of steel is an oxidative process, accelerated by contact with water.
Corrosion-resistant steels (stainless steels) achieve their resistance by the formation
of a stable oxide layer, often chromium oxide, on the surface of the steel. This layer
acts as a barrier preventing the underlying alloy making contact with the oxygen
and water in the environment. This is kinetic stabilization. The corrosion reaction
still proceeds, but much more slowly. Stainless steel, exposed to oxygen for long
enough or at a high enough temperature will still corrode.
Unfortunately, in molten salts this mechanism fails. Molten salts readily dissolve
oxide layers from stainless steel, leaving the metal fully exposed to the molten salt.
If the molten salt has the innate tendency to react with the metals in the alloy (chro-
mium usually being the most reactive metal) then a rapid oxidation of the chro-
mium to chromium chloride or fluoride will take place at the surface. This is
evidenced as a rapid initial corrosion, which often progresses more rapidly along
the grain boundaries of the alloy causing pitting and microcracking.
As the chromium is extracted, it leaves behind a chromium-depleted alloy which
corrodes less easily so that over time corrosion slows down. Eventually, continued
corrosion is limited by the diffusion of chromium through the alloy to the
chromium-depleted surface layers. While normally a slow process, at high tempera-
tures diffusion of metal atoms becomes more rapid. Of particular concern in nuclear
applications is that intense radiation, gamma and neutron, will accelerate this metal
diffusion process.
This last fact is a most challenging one for development of alloys for use in
MSRs as it means that corrosion testing outside of the reactor environment can be
quite misleading, giving erroneous measures of corrosion rates. Development of
new alloys, or testing of existing alloys, can therefore by very slow and expensive.
199
Materials

There are in principle two approaches to prevent corrosion in MSRs. These are
to change the alloy used, or to change the molten salt itself. These approaches are
summarized in the following sections.
7.5.2
Development of corrosion resistant alloys
Two approaches are used in the development of corrosion-resistant alloys.
The first is to minimize the content of chromium or other reactive metals in the
alloy. This usually involves the use of high nickel content “superalloys.” The arche-
typal superalloy was Hastelloy N which is discussed in some depth below. The low
chromium content is advantageous in two ways, it means that extraction of the
chromium causes less physical damage to the alloy and it reduces the rate of disso-
lution of the chromium because the chromium has a lower thermodynamic activity,
being present at a lower concentration in solid solution in the alloy.
The second approach is to change the properties of the alloy so that diffusion of
chromium atoms is slowed. Typically this involves addition of refractory metals
such as molybdenum to the alloy, giving it a higher softening temperature.
Hastelloy N also incorporated this approach.
While substantial progress has been made in development of superior alloys, this
approach can only slow down corrosion. Demonstration of long life under reactor
conditions is very challenging indeed and would add years or decades to the devel-
opment time for any MSR using such materials.
7.5.3
Reduction of the corrosive potential of molten salts
The lack of “passivating” oxide layers with molten salts makes the chemistry of the
corrosion reaction rather simple. For any salt composition in contact with a
chromium-containing alloy, there will be an equilibrium concentration of oxidized
chromium (chloride or fluoride) in the salt such that no more chromium is extracted
from the alloy. If it were that simple, then preventing corrosion would simply
require the addition of enough chromium salt to the molten salt. Unfortunately, the
equilibrium concentration of the chromium salt is temperature-dependent, so that
chromium will be continually extracted from hot alloy surfaces and deposited at
cooler ones.
To prevent corrosion therefore, the chemistry of the molten salt must be adjusted
so that it has very little potential to dissolve chromium at any temperature. It is gen-
erally considered that an equilibrium chromium content of the molten salt of less
than 1 ppm will result in corrosion being substantially absent.
The relevant chemical adjustment is of the redox potential of the salt. If the salt
is made sufficiently reducing then chromium metal will be more stable than chro-
mium chloride or fluoride and corrosion will not take place. This simple procedure
was in fact tested as part of the ORNL Molten Salt Reactor Experiment in the
1960s where the introduction of a highly reactive sacrificial metal (beryllium) into
the molten salt prevented corrosion of standard stainless steel.
200
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

This would suggest that corrosion control in MSRs should be very easily
achieved. Unfortunately, it is not as simple as that.
Making the salt reducing by contacting it with a reactive metal does stop reac-
tion of the chromium in the alloy. However, that reaction is replaced by corrosion
of the reactive metal. That is a problem, because the same phenomenon of oxida-
tion of the reactive metal at high temperatures but reduction back to metal at low
temperatures takes place. The result is that the sacrificial metal migrates around the
reactor, depositing in cooler regions such as heat exchangers. If the sacrificial metal
is in electrical contact with other metals then this process is even more serious. One
approach to mitigate this effect is to create a special low-temperature region of the
molten salt system where the sacrificial metal is allowed to contact the salt. This
approach has been adopted in the FHR reactor where it is hoped it will permit use
of standard stainless steel in the reactor construction (Andreades et al., 2014). The
use of sacrificial metals to stabilize molten salts which are in static, unpumped, sys-
tems where migration of the sacrificial metal is of no consequence is discussed in
Chapter 21, Stable salt fast reactor.
An alternative way to make the salt strongly reducing is to add a reducing mate-
rial to the salt which is itself soluble. In uranium fluoride-fueled reactors this mate-
rial can be uranium trifluoride added together with uranium tetrafluoride but the
approach is limited in value due to the higher melting point of uranium trifluoride
and its lower solubility in most molten salts.
Another potentially generally useful approach is to take advantage of the fact
that zirconium has two stable fluorides, ZrF2 and ZrF4. The addition of small
amounts of ZrF2 to molten salts, particularly those containing ZrF4, is an effective
inhibitor of corrosion, permitting standard stainless steels to be used. Details of this
approach are also given in Chapter 21, Stable salt fast reactor. Other reducing salt
couples, such as the divalent and trivalent halides of transition metals (Y, Sm, V),
have also been proposed (Sridharan and Allen, 2013).
Making the molten salt strongly reducing is not, however, a panacea. It does
have other, sometimes undesirable, effects.
Graphite is generally seen as unreactive to molten salts. This is however not true
when the salt is strongly reducing. The formation of carbides is unavoidable in such
systems. Where graphite moderator is used in the reactor and is directly exposed to
the molten salt it is necessary to find a potentially very narrow window of molten salt
chemistry where the salt is not too corrosive to the metal and not too reactive with
the graphite. Validation that this balance has been achieved is a challenging experi-
mental prospect as experiments under reactor radiation conditions will be necessary.
A similar problem occurs where uranium fluoride is used in the salt. If the salt is
made strongly reducing, the uranium can be reduced to the metallic form. Again, a
balance of not reducing the uranium too much while still reducing corrosion suffi-
ciently must be found. This latter problem can be overcome by using chloride salts of
uranium, which are more stable to reduction, but this approach is generally only appli-
cable to fast neutron reactors due to the strong thermal neutron absorption of chlorine.
The discussion of molten salt chemistry and corrosion given above is necessarily
brief. Much more detailed discussion is available in Sridharan and Allen (2013).

7.5.4
Hastelloy N and other Nickel-based superalloys
One of the most important achievements in the MSR development is the invention
of INOR-8 by Inouye et al. (1958). The INOR-8 is an abbreviation of the eighth
candidate of the superalloy by the International Nickel company for Oak Ridge
(Roche, 2015), and its development story is described in McCoy (1969). This
nickel-based superalloy was later tradenamed as Hastelloy N by the Haynes
International Inc. The nominal composition of Hastelloy N is Ni-Mo-Cr-Fe-others
(71-16-7-5-1 wt%), as is shown in Table 7.3.
Hastelloy N was used in the MSRE reactor vessel, pipes, pumps, heat exchan-
gers, and all metal components facing its fluoride salt, and it showed a good perfor-
mance. Current information on Hastelloy N is shown in the supplier’s website
(Haynes International Inc, 2002). Fig. 7.5 shows a photo of a sample plate.
Hastelloy N shows excellent compatibility with fluoride salts, containing LiF,
BeF2, ThF4, and UF4, because these fluorides are thermodynamically stable toward
Hastelloy N. That is, these fluorides are much more stable than the structural metal
fluorides (NiF2, BeF2, and CrF2) (Rosenthal, 1972).
Among the above alloy constituents, chromium (Cr) is less noble and most reac-
tive. Therefore, a Cr-depleted zone was observed on the surface exposed to MSRE
fuel salt for 22,000 hours at 650C, but the depth of degraded zone did not propa-
gate any more than 0.2 mil (5 μm) (Rosenthal, 1972).
After the operation of the MSRE was ended, its Hastelloy N was investigated,
and the standard Hastelloy N showed an intergranular attack, where grain bound-
aries were degraded due to the existence of FP tellurium (Te), although not deeply
penetrating. Based on the parametric study on niobium (Nb) addition to the original
Hastelloy N, modified Hastelloy N was developed in order to solve this issue,
where Mo, Fe, and Si are reduced, and Nb (1%2%) is added. Fig. 7.6 shows the

performed in thermal and forced convection test loops. The weight change of stan-
dard and modified Hastelloy N was measured for over 22,000 hours exposure to
MSBR fuel salt at a maximum 704C, with temperature difference of 170C. The
corrosion specimens in the hot legs resulted in weight loss and weight gain in the
cold legs. The estimated corrosion rate of Hastelloy N was 0.5 μm/y, and modified
Hastelloy N exhibited better corrosion resistance. Fig. 7.7 shows these results for
both Hastelloy N and modified Hastelloy N specimens (Rosenthal, 1973).
Besides the proposal of modified Hastelloy N, another solution was developed to
control the reductionoxidation (redox) potential by controlling the U4+/U3+ ratio.
The MSRE experience suggests that Te is possibly converted to innocuous telluride
(CrTe) by the reaction:
CrF2 þ Te þ 2UF3 ! 2UF4 þ CrTe:
An equilibrium of this reaction can be controlled by varying the U4+/U3+ ratio,
that is, the redox potential can be controlled by adding metallic Be for reduction or
NiF2 for oxidization. It was observed that this Te attack becomes very small at a U4
+/U3+ ratio less than 60, as is shown in Fig. 7.8 (Keiser, 1977). Therefore, this redox
potential should be kept within the region of stable Te compound (U4+/U3+ , 60)
and above that of U-carbide deposition on graphite (U4+/U3+ . 6).
After longtime irradiation, radiation damage such as embrittlement by helium
(alpha particle), is caused by the following two-step reaction in nickel and by (n,α)
reaction in boron contaminants.

In the MSBR design, an anticipated service lifetime was 30 years, and the most
highly irradiated portion of the reactor vessel would be exposed to a fast-neutron
(E . 0.1 MeV) fluence of less than 1 3 1021 neutrons/cm2 and a thermal neutron
fluence of about 5 3 1022 neutrons/cm2. Since the irradiation effect on Hastelloy N
is small below these values (Keiser, 1977), these values can be considered as a con-
servative design limit for thermal neutron spectrum MSR.
In the 1970s, another modified Hastelloy N was proposed, where titanium (Ti)
was added instead of niobium (Nb). At that time, it was found that the carbide pre-
cipitate that normally occurs in Hastelloy N could be modified to obtain resistance
to the embrittlement by helium. Then, it was confirmed that 2% Ti contributed to
the formation of a fine carbide precipitate and the alloy showed good resistance to
embrittlement by helium. However, adding Ti did not show resistance against Te
attack, and this alloy was abandoned (Engel et al., 1979).
The ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code must be followed in order to use
modified Hastelloy N in commercial reactors, and many property data, such as ten-
sile data, ductility data, creep data, and so on, must be provided.
Besides the Hastelloy N development, Russia is developing alternative alloys for
MSR. Under similar test conditions their new alloy showed a maximum corrosion
rate of 6 3 1026 m/y, and no trace of Te attack. One alloy is named HN80MTY,
which includes 1% aluminum (Al) and 1% Ti, instead of Nb in modified Hastelloy
N (Ignatiev et al., 2012, 2013).
For more basic understanding of metal corrosion in molten salt, Sridharan and
Allen (2013) is recommended.

Conclusions
This chapter first describes molten salt, which is most specific to MSR. Molten salt
serves as a fuel element, as a heat transfer medium, and a as fuel processing
medium. The thermo-physical properties of molten fluoride salts, such as LiF-BeF2
(FLiBe), LiF-NaF-KF (FLiNaK), and others, are illustrated.
As for solid fuels with molten salt coolants, details of these are given in
Chapter 13, Solid fuel, salt-cooled reactors.
Also, the thorium fuel cycle is briefly described, and details are given primarily
in Chapter 9, Environment, waste, and resources, where the properties of thorium,
its minerals, abundance, and estimated resources are detailed.
Possible moderators for thermal neutron spectrum MSR have been investigated
in ORNL, and graphite was selected as the most appropriate moderator. Its compati-
bility with molten salts, irradiation stability, and other topics are described here.
Some other moderators such as beryllium (Be) and lithium (Li) are also briefly
introduced, because these elements are included, if LiF or BeF2 is used in the MSR.
The enrichment issue of natural Li to 7Li is also discussed.
The final topic on materials is the structural metal for MSR. Since its integrity in
high-temperature molten salt under neutron irradiation circumstances is of the highest
concern, a nickel-based superalloy, Hastelloy N, has been investigated, and is believed
to be a feasible material. Some other candidates are also under investigation.

Introduction
The molten salt reactor (MSR) is classified as a nonclassical reactor system due to a
specific character of its fuel, which is liquid—constituted by a molten fluoride salt
mixture circulating between the reactor core and a heat exchanger. The fissile and
fertile material are dissolved in a carrier molten salt, which concurrently plays the
role of a heat-transferring agent (www.gen-4.org/gif/jcms/c_9359/msr). The liquid
character of the MSR fuel exhibits several specific characteristics to this reactor type,
which can be assessed both as advantages and also as complicated technical pro-
blems. Because the typical MSR features only a small reserve of reactivity, the MSR
system needs a frequent supply of nuclear fuel which can be realized via its connec-
tion with the fuel processing/reprocessing unit. The “on-line” reprocessing of circulat-
ing fuel is necessary within a long run not only to keep the reactor in operation by
clearing away some neutron poisoning elements, but this principle also allows very
effective extraction of freshly constituted fissile material or its precursors. This tech-
nology is unique among the nuclear reactor systems and enables to operate MSR
within the thoriumuranium fuel cycle in so economic and effective conditions,
which are unattainable by any other reactor type with solid nuclear fuels.
The technology of chemical processing of liquid fuel for MSR can be divided
into the processing of fresh liquid fuel and the reprocessing of the used fuel just cir-
culated inside the fuel circuit of the reactor system. The final part of fuel processing
technology should be also placed in the reactor site and tightly attached to the
“on-line” reprocessing, because the refilling of the fresh fuel into the reactor has to

be carried out in connection with the removal of the burned-out fuel and fission
products from the primary fuel circuit. (Grimes, 1970; Uhlir, 2007).
There are some top-rated principles applicable in chemistry and chemical
technology that should be also implemented in the decision-making, including
what technologies should be chosen as preferable ones. Some of these principles
applicable for the MSR chemical technology are the following:
G
It will be most advisable to keep one chemical form (fluorides) of fuel for the entire fuel
stream system in developing a compact fuel cycle of the liquid fuel reactor system.
G
This principle results in a fundamental requirement on the choice of separation (partition-
ing) methods, which could be applied in the reactor fuel processing and especially in the
“on-line” fuel reprocessing.
Based on these principles predominantly fluoride pyrochemical and/or
pyrometallurgical procedures appear in the foreground of interest (Uhlir, 2007).
8.2
Processing of fresh liquid fuel for MSR
As mentioned above, typical MSR, as originally developed in ORNL or proposed
by the Generation Four International Forum, uses molten salt fuel based on the
carrier molten fluoride salt (usually the eutectic mixture of 7LiFBeF2) in which
the uranium tetrafluoride UF4 and thorium tetrafluoride ThF4 are dissolved
(Benedict et al., 1981). The design of the MSR core implicates the basic constitution
of the fuel salt. When in the case of single-fluid (one-fluid) core design of MSR,
the fuel salt contains both uranium and thorium fluorides together dissolved in the
carrier salt, the double-fluid (two-fluid) core design of MSR requires the processing
of two salts: the fuel salt, which contains dissolved fissile material only (e.g., uranium
U-233 or U-235 in the form of UF4) and the fertile salt in which the fertile material
—thorium (ThF4)—is dissolved.
Processing of uranium tetrafluoride and thorium tetrafluoride are widely known
processes in the nuclear industry (Benedict et al., 1981). Processing of uranium tet-
rafluoride was mastered on a huge engineering scale for the uranium enrichment
process, where the uranium tetrafluoride is an intermediate product in the uranium
hexafluoride production. The similar technology can be used for the production of
uranium tetrafluoride for MSR fuel. The technology is based on the hydrofluorination
reaction which converts uranium dioxide UO2 to UF4.
UO2 1 4HF 5 UF4 1 2H2O
The reaction is exothermically realized at about 500C. The hydrofluorinating
agent is anhydrous hydrogen fluoride (HF). In laboratory- or small-scale conditions,
the reaction can be realized on the chemical boat in a heated reactor, but in indus-
trial conditions, the series of fluidized-bed reactor is used.
Processing of thorium tetrafluoride was also well mastered in nuclear technology
as it is the intermediate product in the production of thorium metal. The oxygen-free
210
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

thorium tetrafluoride can be prepared by the hydrofluorination of thorium dioxide by
anhydrous HF.
ThO2 1 4HF 5 ThF4 1 2H2O
The reaction is exothermic and is usually realized at temperatures between
500600C. In this way, thorium dioxide can be completely converted to thorium
tetrafluoride with practically no traces of residual oxygen.
Both chemical processes and chemical techniques described above can be used
for the production of UF4 and ThF4 for the final preparation of liquid fuel for MSR.
The final step in the production of fresh liquid MSR fuel is an individual or joint
dissolution of UF4 and ThF4 in the carrier salt (typically 7LiFBeF2 eutectics). LiF
and BeF2 are common chemical products, but the lithium fluoride for use in MSR
has to be prepared from pure isotope Li-7 to minimize tritium generation from Li-6.
There are known enrichment technologies for the separation of lithium isotopes (Li-
6 and Li-7) based either on LiOH/Li-Hg amalgam extraction technology (industri-
ally used COLEX process) or atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS), which
is still under development (Report UCBTH-12-005, 2012). Beryllium bifluoride
BeF2 is industrially available as an intermediate product of the beryllium metal
production.
8.3
Reprocessing technology of MSR fuel
As mentioned above, the long run of MSR is possible only if the chemical composi-
tion of the MSR fuel is kept in an acceptable range in which the chain reaction can
be safely controlled by control rods and the content of neutron poisons does not
spoil the neutron economy. This requirement can be met only by the connection of
the fuel circuit of the MSR system with the fuel reprocessing unit, where the fuel is
cleaned up—fission products (neutron poisons) and bred materials are removed
from the fuel circuit and new fuel and fertile material are supplied. On-line repro-
cessing containing the chemical separation processes is the method to meet these
requirements. The general spirit of MSR on-line reprocessing is to keep the reactor
in steady-state conditions by continuously cleaning-up the primary (fuel) circuit
salt. It means that some part of the salt circulating in the primary circuit is piped to
the reprocessing unit, where the fission products are extracted and then moved to
waste, whereas the separated actinides are dissolved again in the carrier salt and
returned back into the primary circuit. As there is always the same concentration of
fission products in the primary circuit, the removal of these elements in the repro-
cessing unit need not be absolute, however no actinides may be moved into the
waste stream. The scheme of a reprocessing principle is shown in Fig. 8.1.
The only exception is the removal of gaseous fission product elements, such as
xenon and krypton. Xenon is the most important neutron poison among the fission
products and its poisoning effect represents about 98 fission product capture rate
211
Chemical processing of liquid fuel

(ˇStika, 2012). Therefore, the removal of gaseous fission products has to be realized
permanently, completely, and immediately, directly inside the fuel circuit.
If the MSR system is designed as a thorium-breeder, the separation of protactin-
ium can play a significant role. Protactinium Pa-233 is a precursor of desirable
U-233 and it originates by β-decay from Th-233. The problem is that Pa-233 has a
big cross-section for thermal neutrons and a relatively long half-life (about 27 days).
Therefore the prompt extraction of protactinium from the fuel circuit is important
for the maximized breeding of U-233, because it minimizes the undesirable formation
of Pa-234.
A simplified scheme of the MSR operating in the thoriumuranium fuel cycle is
shown in Fig. 8.2.
Chemical separation processes applicable within the MSR fuel cycle technology
have to be in good accordance with the chemical nature of the molten fluoride fuel
and with the requirement for virtually immediate fuel processing after leaving the
reactor core. The separation processes must often work at the high temperatures,
often over 500C, and must be highly radiation-resistant. There are only few pyro-
chemical separation methods that meet these requirements (Grimes, 1970; Uhlir,
2007). Most were developed in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, often for the MSR
program investigated in Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The objective of the inves-
tigation at the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s was the develop-
ment of a fuel processing technology devoted to the concept of the 1000 MWe
molten salt breeder reactor (MSBR) working in the thoriumuranium fuel cycle.
After the Generation Four International Forum was chartered in 2001, the investiga-
tion of selected pyrochemical methods suitable for MSR fuel cycle was restored.
Existing and proposed technological development of the MSR fuel cycle comes
extensively from the original investigations.

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

The main chemical separation processes applicable within the reprocessing tech-
nology of the liquid molten salt fuel are:
G
Gas extraction process also known as “helium bubbling;”
G
Fused salt volatilization;
G
Molten salt/liquid metal reductive extraction;
G
Electrochemical separation techniques from molten fluoride salt;
G
Vacuum distillation of molten salt.
The processes mentioned above can serve both the removal of the actinides from
the liquid molten salt fuel and the carrier salt clean-up from fission products (neu-
tron poisons). Whereas the original MSR design was based on the thermal spectrum
reactor working in the thoriumuranium fuel cycle (MSBR program developed by
Oak Ridge National Laboratory), present MSR design considers also the fast spec-
trum MSR (Molten Salt Fast Reactor [MSFR] proposed mainly by French Centre
National de la Recherche Scientifique [CNRS]) and Russian National Research
Centre “Kurchatov Institute” (Rosenthal et al., 1970, 1971; Ignatiev et al., 2014).
Although this difference partially affects the amount, constitution, and reprocessing
rate of circulating MSR fuel, the main technological separation processes are simi-
lar for both—thermal and fast MSR concepts.
8.4
Gas extraction process
The principle of the gas extraction process—sparging the molten salt with inert gas
(He)—is based on the application of a scientific principle of Henry’s Law. The
Figure 8.2 Scheme of fuel cycle of MSR Th-breeder.
213
Chemical processing of liquid fuel

solubility of dissolved gas (Xe, Kr) in a molten salt is proportional to the partial
pressure of that gas in the atmosphere. If a new inert gas (He) is introduced in the
molten salt, the difference in partial pressure causes the dissolved gas (Xe, Kr) to
leave the molten salt. The efficiency of sparging is influenced by many factors such
as bubble size, temperature, gas pressure, etc.
The gas extraction process, also known as the “helium bubbling method,” was
successfully used and verified during the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE)
19651969. As the MSRE was operated only as an experimental reactor, the com-
plete reprocessing of its fuel was not necessary, except for removal of the main
neutron poisons—xenon (Xe)-135 and Kr-85. The gas extraction process (helium
bubbling) emerged to be a suitable and effective method (Rosenthal et al., 1971).
Noble gases have very low solubility in the fuel salt (LiFBeF2UF4), which
makes it possible to strip them from the salt and reduce the poisoning effect of Xe-
135. The removal was provided by sparging the salt with helium, which was then
passed through charcoal traps in an off-gas clean-up system. The contact for noble
gases (xenon and krypton) removal was produced by spraying of salt through the
cover gas (helium) and into the pool of salt in the fuel pump bowl. The schematic
view of the pump with helium sparging system is shown in Fig. 8.3.
At the end of the MSRE program, helium was temporarily replaced by argon,
which has a much lower solubility in the fuel salt. Experiments at lower power
showed substantial differences in the amounts of gas in the core with argon and with
helium. At low pump speeds, the small amount of helium drawn into the pump suc-
tion could almost completely dissolve in the salt before reaching the core. A similar
amount of argon at the pump suction meant more bubbles in the salt going through

the core because less was dissolved. When the reactor was operated at the power
with argon cover gas, the xenon poisoning at high void fractions was about the same
as it was with helium, but the xenon poisoning was higher with argon when only
small amounts of gas circulated with the salt. The difference between argon and
helium is due almost entirely to the difference in solubility of these gases.
Xenon and krypton stayed with the purge stream (helium or argon) to the charcoal
beds, where adsorption delayed their passage long enough for practically all the
radionuclides, except krypton-85, to decay. The daughters of Xe and Kr deposited on
surfaces contacting the gas stream, in quantities readily detectable by gamma-
spectrometry and heat production. Through the end of the MSRE operation, however,
temperatures in charcoal showed no evidence of any decrease in adsorptive capacity
due to accumulation of these daughters (Rosenthal et al., 1971; Scott and Eatherly,
1970). The flowsheet of the MSRE fuel off-gas system is shown in Fig. 8.4.
Present investigation of the gas extraction process is carried out mainly in
France by CNRS Grenoble. The effort is a part of the existing CNRS program
devoted to the MSFR technology development (Merle-Lucotte, 2013).
Verification of the gas extraction process during MSRE projects was generally
fully successful. Xenon gas—the main neutron poisoning element—was continu-
ously removed from the fuel salt circuit during the reactor run. The extraction
capacity was designed to enable an average xenon processing time of about 20 sec-
onds. A similar xenon processing time was designed for MSBR system.
However xenon and krypton are not the only fission products that can be
removed by gas extraction from the MSR fuel salt. As the MSR working tempera-
tures are in the range of 650750C, there are some other elements, which tend to
leave the salt. The group of noble metals like niobium, molybdenum, ruthenium,
antimony, and tellurium did not form stable fluorides in the normal environment in
the MSRE. The bulk of the fission product elements (lanthanides) form stable and
soluble fluorides and remained with the fuel salt.
Noble metals were partially removed in the noble gases stripping system and
accompanied xenon and krypton in the purge stream. They settled as radioactive
dust everywhere on the surface of pipes, filters, and other parts of the off-gas sys-
tem. Other portions of the noble metals that did not leave the primary circuit depos-
ited on the surface of the primary circuit structural materials—Hastelloy N and
graphite. The typical noble metals processing time designed for MSBR was similar
to that of xenon, at about 2050 seconds (Rosenthal et al., 1971).
8.5
Fused salt volatilization
The method called fused salt volatilization is based on the chemical reaction of
fluorine gas with elements dissolved in fluoride molten carrier. Some elements orig-
inally dissolved in the salt form volatile fluorides, which tend to leave the salt.
Fused salt volatilization was successfully applied during the MSRE program, when
this process was used for uranium removal from the fuel circuit (LiFBeF2 was the
215

carrier salt). Uranium was recovered from the fuel salt as uranium hexafluorides
(UF6) by sparging the salt with fluorine gas. Oak Ridge National Laboratory real-
ized this technology in the US in 1968. The goal of the extraction of uranium was
the change of original U-235 for U-233. Carrier molten fluoride salt, in which ura-
nium was dissolved, was LiFBeF2 melt. Uranium was recovered from the carrier
salt as uranium hexafluoride by sparging the salt with fluorine gas. This fluorine
gas bubbling through the salt containing uranium in the form of dissolved UF4 pro-
duces a formation of UF6 on the gasliquid phase interface. The rate of fluorination
reaction is high enough at the temperature range of 500600C. That’s why it
would lead one to expect the mass transfer of uranium compounds in the liquid
phase to be the limiting stage of the process.
Special equipment for continual fluorination of the salt was designed by ORNL
in 1960s (ORNL report No. 3936, 1966). The crucial part of the equipment was the
continuous fluorination reactor with frozen wall for corrosion protection (Fig. 8.5).
The main structural material of the fluorinator was pure nickel.
The carrier molten salt containing dissolved UF4 flowed into the top of the
fluorination reactor and was contacted by a countercurrent stream of fluorine gas,
which stripped out the uranium in the form of volatile UF6 according to the follow-
ing reaction
UF4 1 F2 ! UF6
The working temperatures were in the range of 500550C; the reactor walls
coolant was NaK. The off-gas containing uranium hexafluoride, fluorine gas, and vol-
atile fluorides of some fission products (here mainly CrF4 and CrF5) passed through
sorption column with NaF pellets heated to 400C for removal of chromium fluor-
ides. UF6 was then trapped at the same sorbent at 100C. Similar technology was
under development in ORNL during ensuing MSBR program at the beginning of the
1970s aimed mainly to design an on-line reprocessing scheme for molten salt reactors
working under a 232Th233U fuel cycle (ORNL report No. 5018, 1974).
A fused salt volatilization process was under development in ORNL also during
the first period of preparation of the MSBR project. A close-coupled facility for
processing (reprocessing) the fuel and fertile streams of the MSBR was understood
to be an integral part of the reactor system. (Initially, the MSBR was designed with
two separate circuits: fuel-stream and fertile-stream.) The preliminary design of the
MSBR fuel and fertile stream processing is shown in Fig. 8.6.
Fig. 8.6 shows that only four major operations were proposed to accomplish the
fuel stream processing: fluorination, sorption of UF6, vacuum distillation, and salt
reconstitution. After 36 hours of cooling time, the fuel processing should have
begun by molten salt fluorination. Some fission products like Ru, Tc, Nb, Cs, Mo,
and Te form also volatile fluorides and accompany the UF6. Therefore the gas
stream leaving the fluorinator passes through a sorption system composed of
temperature-controlled beds of NaF and MgF2 pellets. The first section of the NaF
bed is held at about 400C and sorbs most of the fission products, the second sec-
tion of the bed is held at about 100C and sorbs technetium, part of the molybde-
num, and allows the remaining fission products to pass. Upon heating from 100C

to 400C, the second section of the sorber releases molybdenum, technetium, and
UF6, this passes through MgF2 for retention of technetium while allowing UF6 to
pass. Uranium hexafluorides are then frozen in cold traps and retained for recycling
to the reactor (Rosenthal et al., 1971).
At present, there is no running experimental development program of the fused
salt volatilization technique, but nearly all of the MSR fuel cycle flowsheets proposed
by several institutions under the frame of the Generation IV program include this
method. Here, the fused salt volatilization is often proposed to be used, not only for
uranium removal, but also for extraction of plutonium (in the form of PuF6) and nep-
tunium (in the form of NpF6) (Delpech et al., 2009). However, it is necessary to take
into account that whereas the formation of volatile UF6 goes relatively easy and
quantitatively, because the stable form of uranium is hexavalent, the preferable form
of plutonium is tetravalent and therefore the formation of PuF6 is more difficult and
plutonium hexafluoride tends to decompose to PuF4 and F2 (Fischer et al., 1962).
8.6
Molten salt/liquid metal extraction
Molten salt/liquid metal reductive extraction is proposed as a separation method
widely used for the MSR fuel salt clean-up. The technique was investigated by
ORNL both for protactinium removal from the fuel salt and for the extraction of
lanthanides (rare-earth elements) which represents the main group of fission pro-
ducts. The main principles of the technology were based on selective molten-salt/
liquid metal reductive extraction into liquid bismuth in multistage countercurrent
extraction system (Rosenthal et al., 1971).
The principle of the extraction into bismuth is based on the property of bismuth,
which is a low-melting (271C) metal that is essentially immiscible with molten
halide mixtures, which include fluorides, chlorides, and bromides. Bismuth has a
negligible vapor pressure in the temperature of interest, 500700C and the solubi-
lities of metals such as lithium, thorium, uranium, protactinium, and the rare earths
are adequate for processing application.
Reductive extraction reactions between materials in molten salt and liquid metal
phases can be represented by the general reaction
MXn 1 nLiðBiÞ2MðBiÞ 1 nLiX;in which a metal halide MXn in the salt reacts
with lithium from the bismuth phase to produce M in the bismuth phase and the
respective lithium halide in the salt phase. The oxidation state of M in the salt is n1,
and X represents fluorine, chlorine, or bromine.
Distribution data were obtained in ORNL for a number of materials between bis-
muth and fuel MSBR salt (72% LiF, 16% BeF2, 12% ThF4) at 640C (Ferris et al.,
1969). The data indicate that protactinium, as well as uranium and zirconium, can
be easily extracted from the salt stream containing ThF4. However, the separation
factors of rare earth elements/thorium are close to unity (from 1.2 to 3.5), which
indicates that selective extraction of the rare earth elements (lanthanides) from a
molten fluoride salt containing thorium tetrafluoride is either difficult or nearly
impossible. Therefore, another extraction system between the liquid bismuth and
220
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

the molten lithium chloride was chosen as the most promising. Here, the separation
of both divalent rare-earth elements and trivalent rare-earth elements from thorium
is possible. The distribution coefficients for these materials are strongly affected by
the concentration of lithium in the bismuth phase, and the best method for removing
these materials from the LiCl appears to be extraction into bismuth containing lith-
ium at a concentration of 0.05 to 0.5 mole fraction. A simplified flowsheet for the
rare-earth removal system is shown in Fig. 8.7.
As mentioned above, the molten salt/liquid metal reductive extraction was pro-
posed by ORNL also for the protactinium separation (Rosenthal et al., 1971).
Protactinium, which exists in the fuel salt as PaF4, can be relatively easily reduced
by lithium and extracted into liquid bismuth. In order to avoid the use of large
quantities of reductant, removal of uranium from the salt by fluoride volatilization
was situated before the protactinium separation.
After removal of uranium by conversion of UF4 to volatile UF6, protactinium is
extracted in the first instance into liquid bismuth and consequently converted by
hydrofluorination to fluoride salt, wherefrom the 233UF6 is extracted by fluorination
after the protactinium decay. (The radioactive half-life of 232Pa is about 27 days.) A
schematic flowsheet of protactinium isolation is shown in Fig. 8.8.

At present, with the exception of limited French and Russian activities (Delpech,
2013; Zagnitko and Ignatiev, 2013), there is no intensive experimental development
program on molten salt/liquid metal reductive extraction for the uranium, protactinium,
thorium, and fission products separation into liquid bismuth from fission products in an
LiFBeF2 fluoride molten salt.
8.7
Electrochemical separation processes
The effort to use the electrochemical separation processes for reprocessing of MSR
fuel containing thorium is relatively new, connected with the MSR development
under the Generation Four International Forum. The main arguments for this effort
were facts that the development of electro-separation processes made remarkable
progress from the 1960s, when MSR reprocessing was under study in ORNL; and
that the molten salt/liquid metal reductive extraction studied in the MSBR project
showed some difficulties in the separation of thorium from rare earth elements.
The theoretical as well as experimental investigation of the electrochemical sepa-
ration processes applicable within the MSR thorium fuel reprocessing have been
studied mainly by the Nuclear Research Institute ˇReˇz (UJV) in the Czech Republic
and at the Universite´ Paul Sabatier in Toulouse in France (Uhlı´ˇr et al., 2012;
Chamelot et al., 2010). The main objective of electrochemical separation research
has been to determine the separation possibilities of the selected actinides (uranium,
thorium) and fission products (lanthanides) in selected fluoride melt carriers.
Although the typical reference MSR fuel composition (7LiFBeF2ThF4UF4)
was already done by reactor physicists, it was clear that the melts based on
LiFBeF2 will not be applicable for all electrochemical separation steps, because
of the limited electrochemical stability of BeF2. Therefore the first step was the
choice of fluoride melts suitable for electrochemical separations. The chosen
melt should meet some basic characteristics—low melting point, high solubility
of studied compounds, high electrochemical stability, and appropriate physical
properties (electrical conductivity, viscosity, etc.). Unfortunately no melt fulfilling
all the requirements was found. Therefore three candidate melts were selected
for further electrochemical separation studies: eutectic mixture of LiF-NaF-KF
(acronym FLINAK, m.p. 454C, however limited electrochemical stability),
mixture of LiF-BeF2 (acronym FLIBE, m.p. of chosen composition 456C, however
limited electrochemical stability), and eutectic mixture of LiF-CaF2 (m.p. 766C,
good electrochemical stability). Electrochemical stability of the carrier melt is
defined by the electrochemical window. It is a voltage range in which the carrier
melt is neither oxidized nor reduced.
The cyclic voltammetry method was used for studying the basic electrochemical
properties of actinides and fission products dissolved in selected fluoride melt
media. A special reference electrode based on the Ni/Ni21 red-ox couple was devel-
oped to provide reproducible electrochemical measurements in molten fluoride salts
(Bronstein and Manning, 1972; Straka et al., 2010).
223
Chemical processing of liquid fuel

The selected red-ox potentials evaluated by UJV for uranium, thorium, and
selected fission products in individual carrier molten salts are listed in Table 8.1
(Uhlı´ˇr et al., 2012).
Results obtained from the measurements can be interpreted in the following
way:
G
In FLIBE melt, there is a good possibility for electrochemical separation of uranium,
and the electrochemical removal of uranium can eventually replace the fused salt volatili-
zation. Although the electrochemical studies of protactinium have not been realized
yet, based on the thermodynamical properties of PaF4, there is a presumption that also
protactinium could be separated from this melt.
G
In FLINAK melt, only uranium can be directly separated.
G
In LiF-CaF2 melt, uranium, thorium, and most fission products (lanthanides) can be
electrochemically separated.
8.8
Vacuum distillation
The technology of vacuum distillation was also judged by ORNL for clean-up of the
MSR fuel carrier salt (LiFBeF2) fission products. Originally this process, led at

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

1200C, was proposed also for rare earth elements, and later on for the separation of
those elements, which cannot be extracted from salt by reductive extraction due to
their high thermodynamical stability. It is typical for alkaline fluorides and alkaline
earth fluorides like CsF, RbF, SrF2, BaF2. However the cost of the technology, the
length of time required, and the need to process total volume of the fuel salt caused
this technology to almost be abandoned (Carter et al., 1968; Bauman et al., 1977).
8.9
MSR reprocessing flowsheets
The separation techniques discussed above have allowed the design of several
schemes of MSR on-line reprocessing. The original conceptual flowsheets were
proposed by ORNL for MSBR system with LiFBeF2ThF4UF4 composition.
The flowsheet intended for single-fluid MSR design is shown in Fig. 8.9 (Rosenthal
et al., 1971).
The present flowsheets of the Gen IV activities originate from this MSBR
scheme, but they include some changes in MSR fuel composition and progress in
electrochemical separation techniques. A conceptual flowsheet of MSFR iso-
breeder reprocessing proposed by CNRS is shown in Fig. 8.10 (Laplace et al.,
2011; NEA Report on Thorium, 2015) and the MSR on-line reprocessing flow-
sheet based on the broader use of electrochemical separation processes proposed
by the Nuclear Research Institute ˇReˇz (UJV) is drafted in Fig. 8.11 (Uhlı´ˇr et al.,
2012).
As is evident, the MSR core is now often proposed to be designed as a double-
fluid (two-fluid) system with separated channels of fissile and fertile salt. This
design is often motivated by the wish to maximize the breeding factor of the MSR
system. Concerning the corresponding fuel cycle, the main difference between the
one-fluid and two-fluid systems comes from the fact, that in the case of the two-
fluid system the requirements for reprocessing of fissile-fluid and fertile-fluid cir-
cuits are quite different. As the speed of fissile-fluid reprocessing is determined
mainly by the requirement to keep the concentration of fission products at the
acceptable level allowing the operation of the reactor, the extraction of 233Pa from
the fertile-fluid circuit has to be as fast as possible, because the speed of protactin-
ium separation has a direct impact on the breeding factor of the system. The reason
for the prompt separation of protactinium is to eliminate the nuclear reaction of
233Pa(n, γ) ! 234Pa, which leads to the undesirable 234U production.
As the partitioning technology used for the reprocessing of the fissile-fluid cir-
cuit could be similar to those proposed for the one-fluid system (evidently without
the protactinium and thorium separation), the partitioning technology of the fertile-
fluid circuit could be significantly simplified. The supposed conceptual on-line
reprocessing flowsheets of fissile-fluid and fertile-fluid MSR circuits proposed by
the Nuclear Research Institute ˇReˇz (UJV) are shown in Figs. 8.12 and 8.13.
Chemical processing techniques are also discussed in Chapter 11, Liquid fuel,
thermal neutron spectrum reactors.

Conclusions
On-line reprocessing of MSR fuel means that the MSR fuel cycle technology is
strongly linked with the MSR physics, with the design of the reactor core, and with
the chemistry of the reactor core. The fission reaction in the MSR core is not chem-
ically neutral. It is a chemically oxidative process, which must then be chemically
compensated in the fuel circuit to maintain slightly reductive conditions (red-ox
potential) to protect the main structural material (nickel alloys) against corrosion
(see Chapter 7: Materials). A direct link between MSR physics and on-line repro-
cessing chemistry is also extremely strong for MSRs operating as thorium-breeders.
The fission power level affects the on-line reprocessing capacity; and the reproces-
sing rate affects the fissile material concentration. The rate of protactinium removal
affects the reactor system breeding factor, and the rate of fission product extraction
affects the neutron economy and the required fissile material concentration. To
achieve
good
neutron
economy,
satisfactory
breeding
performance,
and
acceptable operational economy, reprocessing technology must be optimized.
Chemical processing of liquid fuel includes technologies with various technol-
ogy readiness levels. Whereas some of them, like processing of fresh liquid fuel,
are well mastered and adequately verified, some other technologies still represent a
scientific and engineering challenge. The biggest is a full verification of on-line
reprocessing technology as a whole. Although the problem was studied intensively
at ORNL and significant progress was achieved, the termination of the MSBR proj-
ect in the 1970s prevented the ORNL team from completing the development and
verification. Nowadays interest in MSR systems and recent progress in new parti-
tioning techniques (such as electroseparation), which were not studied during the
MSBR project, inspire optimism that the on-line reprocessing technology can be
also mastered in the foreseeable future. Additional chemical processes are discussed
in Chapter 12, Fast spectrum, liquid fueled reactors.

Decay heat in the thorium cycle
9.1.1
Introduction
Decay heat is an important safety parameter of the nuclear fuel, especially shortly
after reactor shutdown in a molten salt reactor (MSR). The MSR fuel salt flows by
gravity to a drain tank in some accidental conditions, and its decay heat must be
evaluated. Decay heat is also important for a long-term storage of spent fuels.

Decay heat, caused by the decay of actinides and fission products (FPs), mainly
depends on the fuel, which may contain isotopes of Th, U, and Pu as oxides, fluor-
ides, chlorides, or metal.
The decay heat calculation is well-established for UO2 and mixed oxide (MOX)
fuel, but reliable papers on decay heat for thorium cores are limited. Therefore, this
section provides the necessary information on decay heat evaluation for thorium
fuel, compared with UO2 fuel.
Heating from fissions caused by delayed neutrons disappears in several minutes,
and this heating process is handled in the kinetic equations for accident analysis, so
it is ignored here.
After unique features of MSR decay heat are first discussed, decay heat from
thorium pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel is compared with decay heat from
conventional UO2 PWR fuel.
9.1.2
Unique features of MSR decay heat
One of the most unique features in MSR on decay heat is that the gaseous FPs such as
krypton (Kr) and xenon (Xe) are removed from the fuel salt, because these FPs are inert
gases and can be removed from a liquid molten fuel salt by a gas removal system. Then,
some of the fuel salt decay heat can be reduced. On the other hand, these removed FPs
will cause additional heat generation at a radioactive gas treatment system.
Typical decay heat generation by FP gas is as follows. The fission yield of 233U
(number of generated FP atoms per 100 233U fissions) for 88Kr is 3.8, that is 3.8%
fission yield. Since the half-life of 88Kr is 2.8 hours with 2.9 MeV energy emission,
its decay causes significant decay heat. Some Kr nuclides have a very short half-
life, and they cannot be removed by an FP gas removal system. Meanwhile, some
of Kr nuclides have a very long half-life or even are stable, and their contribution
to decay heat is small or nothing. Here, fission yield data are based on England
(1993), and decay data such as half-life and energy are based on Korea Atomic
Energy Research Institute (2015).
The fission yield of 135Xe is only 1.2%, but its parent nuclide 135I (iodine) has a
fission yield of 3.3% and a half-life of 6.6 hours. This 135I, which is circulating
within fuel salt, decays to gaseous 135Xe. 135Xe is transmuted both by neutron cap-
ture to stable 136Xe and by beta decay to 135Cs with a half-life of 9.1 hours and
1.2 MeV energy emission. However, most 135Xe is removed from molten salt by an
FP gas removal system before being transmuted.
Thus some of Kr and Xe can be removed by an FP gas removal system, but
some of Kr and Xe cannot be removed. Also, the efficiency of an FP gas removal
system affects the result. The decay heat from Kr and Xe is about 10% of the total
decay heat by all nuclides. In a conservative safety analysis, the effect of FP gas
removal may be disregarded, which gives a larger decay heat estimate.
The second concern on MSR decay heat may be the generation of gaseous tri-
tium. Neutron absorption in 6Li and 7Li, which are components of some fuel salts,
such as LiF-BeF2 (“FLiBe”) generate tritium (T, or 3H). Since tritium is a beta-
emitter (average energy only 6 keV) with a half-life of 12.3 years, its decay heat is
negligible, but it is hazardous if ingested into the body. The generation rate of
232
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

tritium in a 1000 MWe Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) with 99.995%
enriched 7Li in one day is shown in Table 9.1. Here, 1 curie equals to 3.7 3 1010
becquerel. ORNL proposed several countermeasures, which would reduce the
release rate of tritium to the environment down to 1/1001/1000th of the genera-
tion rate (Robertson, 1971).
In this table, the initial 6Li decreases with years by neutron absorption, but 6Li
is newly generated by fast neutron absorption to 9Be, that is 9Be(n,α)6He reaction
and further beta-decay to 6Li. The last feature on MSR decay heat is the behavior
of so-called “noble metals” (elements 4152, insoluble in the fuel salt) in the
MSBR design (Robertson, 1971). They are Nb (niobium), Mo (molybdenum), Tc
(technetium), Ru (ruthenium), Rh (rhodium), Pd (palladium), Ag (silver), Cd (cad-
mium), In (indium), Sn (tin), Sb (antimony), and Te (tellurium). These FPs would
deposit on metal and graphite surfaces or move to a gas removal system, where
some decay heat is generated even after fuel salt is drained to a drain tank.
In this section online reprocessing is not assumed, but if it is adopted, decay
heat within the fuel salt must be evaluated for the online reprocessing facility.
Decay heat issues and design for the MSBR are provided in an ORNL report
(Robertson, 1971).
9.1.3
Calculation method
In this section, decay heat for PWR thorium fuel is compared with conventional
PWR UO2 fuel, and ORIGEN2 code is used to calculate decay heat (Croff, 1980).
There are several cross-section libraries for different fuels in ORIGEN2, and
their effects were studied in Yoshioka et al. (2014) and IAEA (to be published).
The following two cores were assumed, with a rated power density of 39.2 MW/T.
1. U-PWR-core: 4%235U+96%238U.
2. Th-PWR-core: 4%233U+96%232Th
Since the output of decay heat in ORIGEN2 is “Watt/ton-HeavyMetal”(in gen-
eral, “ton-HeavyMetal” is defined as a total weight of U/Pu/Th in fresh fuel), decay
heat was divided by a rated power density in order to derive “% fraction.”
Therefore, if “Watt/ton” value is required for discharged fuel, it can be derived
by multiplying a rated power density (=39.2) to the following figures.
Also, if “Watt/ton” value is required for 1 GW (GWe or GWt) operation in a
year, its conversion process is described at 9.2.4.

Fuel was burned up to 45 GWd/t, and then decay was calculated from 1 second
to 1 million years.
9.1.4
Components of decay heat
First of all, the same UO2 library was used for the above two cores. This compari-
son may show the basic difference between uranium (or 235U) and thorium (or
233U) on FP and actinide generation. One unique feature for Th-core is that there is
a peak at 0.1 million years, which is explained later.
Components of decay heat are shown in Fig. 9.1 for the U-core, and Fig. 9.2 for the
Th-core. Both figures show that decay heat by FP is dominant up to 100 years, but it
fades out after 100 years. After that, decay heat by actinides becomes dominant.
There is some difference on decay heat between U-core and Th-core at a short
time range. Of course, there is some difference on fission yield between 233U and
235U, and this may cause the decay heat difference. In order to investigate the cause
of this difference, the top 10 contributions, when the reactor is shut down, are
shown in Table 9.2. It is not clear what nuclide is dominant for each core.
The cause of the unique feature of a peak at 0.1 million years for Th-core is
studied below. The decay heat contribution from each actinide is shown in Fig. 9.3.
Here, these nuclides are generated from the decay of 233U, which has a half-life of
159,200 years. The daughter nuclides generated from the decay of 233U are:
233U (Half-life: 159,200 years) . 229Th (7340 y) . 225Ra (14.9 d) . 225Ac (10.0 d) . 221Fr
(14.9 m) . 217At (32.3 ms) . 213Bi (45.59 m) . 213Po (4.2 μs) . 209Pb (3.253 h) . 209Bi
(stable).

234
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

Then, radioactivity shows a peak, which is known as “transient equilibrium” in
the theory of radiation chemistry (“Transient equilibrium”, 2015).
As for MSR, 233U in spent fuel is recovered by online reprocessing or by off-site
reprocessing, because it is a fissile material and can be used as new fuel (see
Section 9.2.4). Under this scenario, this peak does not appear.
9.1.5
Other influences on decay heat calculation
Since there are several libraries in ORIGEN2, its effect was studied. ORIGEN2
provides a Th-core library (213-library), which was verified as reasonable by the
Figure 9.2 Component of decay heat (Th-core).
Table 9.2 Decay heat of top 10 FPs (% rated)
235
Environment, waste, and resources

authors (Yoshioka et al., 2014; IAEA (to be published)). The differences between
different libraries are less than 10%30%.
In general, higher burnup requires higher fissile content in the initial fuel.
Therefore, influence by 233U content was studied. The initial 233U content was
assumed as 2% artificially, and compared with a referenced 4% case. The result
shows that the influence is negligible, because 232Th is converted to 233U, and its
fission is dominant (Yoshioka et al., 2014; IAEA, to be published).
The effect of different burnups was also studied. In general, more actinides are
accumulated at higher burnup, and it causes larger decay heat. This effect was studied
for different burnups for the corresponding enriched U-core and Th-core (Yoshioka
et al., 2014; IAEA, to be published). Since most FPs are short-lived, decay heat does
not depend on burnup at short time range. But, for the timespan between 1 year to
1 million years, decay heat is almost proportional to discharge burnup.
9.1.6
Verification of decay heat calculation
As for verification of ORIGEN2, there is only one experimental measurement on
decay heat, which provides the decay heat data up to 105 s (about 1 day) after
2 3 104 s irradiation of pure 233U and 235U (Yarnell et al., 1978). That is, only FP
contribution can be verified. It is verified that ORIGEN2 agrees very well to the
measurement for 233U and 235U (Yoshioka et al., 2014; IAEA, to be published).
In order to verify the above results by a different approach, the most recent cal-
culations are referred to, where recent nuclear cross-section libraries are used
(Fleming et al., 2015). The ORIGEN2 result shows good agreement with recent
nuclear cross-section libraries in the above short time range.
There are few papers for decay heat of Th-cycle by governmental organizations.
Only one paper by Brookhaven National Laboratory was found, where burnup and
decay are calculated by a unit-cell code for PWR fuel (Todosow et al., 2010).

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

Based on this paper, its general tendency is similar to the above ORIGEN2 result
(IAEA, to be published).
9.1.7
Final results
The result for the U-core was obtained using ORIGEN2-U219-library for 50 GWd/t
PWR fuel, which is close to the U204-library for 33 GWd/t PWR. For the Th-core,
the Th-213 library was used.
The decay heat of the Th-core is 10% larger than that of U-core up to 100 days.
One unique behavior is a peak at 0.1 million years for Th-core, as is shown in
Fig. 9.4. The Th-core decay heat is 10% larger than that of U-core up to one day,
which is important for accident analysis, as is shown in Fig. 9.5.
9.1.8
Summary
1. Decay heat is evaluated for U-core and Th-core of PWR, using the ORIGEN2 code.
2. Decay heat of Th-core is 10% larger than U-core after shutdown to one day, which is
important for accident analysis.
3. After 100 years, decay heat of Th-core is smaller.
4. Between 10,000100,000 years, there is a peak on Th-core, which is caused by 233U and
its daughters.
5. As for MSR, if 233U in spent fuel is recovered by online reprocessing or by off-site repro-
cessing, the above peak does not appear.

Radiotoxicity in the thorium cycle
9.2.1
Introduction
Radiotoxicity is an important parameter in fuel cycle consideration, wherever spent
fuel is stored. Since radiotoxicity is caused by the decay of actinides and FPs, it
mainly depends on the fuel type, which is expected to be thorium (Th) in a MSR.
Of course, either MOX fuel (PuO2-UO2) or LEU (low enriched uranium) fuel can
be used in MSRs, as in light water reactors (LWRs).
A radiotoxicity calculation is established for UO2 and MOX fuel, but reliable
papers on radiotoxicity for thorium core are very limited. Therefore, this section
provides the necessary information on radiotoxicity evaluation for mainly thorium
fuel, compared with that of UO2 fuel. Radiotoxicity for MOX fuel is also shown
just as information.
9.2.2
Calculation method
In this section, radiotoxicity for PWR thorium fuel is compared with conventional
PWR UO2 fuel, and ORIGEN2 code is used to calculate radiotoxicity (Croff,
1980). The following core and libraries were selected, with a rated power density of
39.2 MW/T. Fuel was burnt up to 45 GWd/t, and then radiotoxicity was calculated
from 1 year to 1 million years.
1. U-PWR-core: 4%235U 1 96%238U. U219-library;
2. Th-PWR-core: 4%233U 1 96%232Th. Th213-library.

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

ORIGEN2 provides radioactivity in “Ci/tHM (Curie/ton-HeavyMetal)” (in gen-
eral, “ton-HeavyMetal” is defined as a total weight of U/Pu/Th in fresh fuel), which
must be converted to “Becquerel (Bq)/tHM” (1 Ci53.7 3 1010 Bq). Radioactivity
was calculated by ORIGEN2, and then converted to radiotoxicity in Sieverts (Sv).
Normally, the unit of radiotoxicity is Sv/tHM, but it can be defined as Sv/gram-HM
or Sv/assembly. If radiotoxicity for spent fuel per 1 GW (GWe or GWt) operation
in a year is required, its conversion process is described in Section 9.2.4. In most of
this section, Sv/tHM is used.
Radiotoxicity considers the type of radiation, its energy, and influence on human
body as a DCF (dose conversion factor). Since DCF is not included in ORIGEN2,
it must be found from appropriate references. Thus, radiotoxicity of spent fuel is
calculated by the following formula:
Radiotoxicity [Sv/tHM] = Radioactivity [Bq/tHM] 3 DCF [Sv/Bq]
Most DCF data are shown in ICRP (1995) and Nishihara (2010), and DCF of
some nuclides, which are not provided in these references, are supplemented in
Clement (2012) and Kawai et al. (2002).
Since alpha particles cannot penetrate the skin, those emitted by actinides cause
significant damage only after ingestion by eating/drinking or after inhalation by
breathing. The ICRP (International Commission on Radiological Protection) pro-
vides different DCFs for these two cases (ICRP, 1995). For example, DCF for
ingestion of 239Pu is 2.5 3 1027 Sv/Bq, but DCF for inhalation of small particles
(B5 μm) of 239Pu is 3.2 3 1025 Sv/Bq, about two orders of magnitude higher. But,
in general, radiotoxicity is discussed based on an ingestion scenario, because inhala-
tion is incredible for spent fuel. Of course, if radiotoxicity is discussed on reactor
accident situations, then an inhalation scenario must be also considered.
The “ingestion hazard,” which is computed by ORIGEN2, is the amount of water
(m3) needed to dilute the 1 ton of spent fuel in order to reduce potential intake of
ingestion below the threshold for the general public. However there is no description
for this calculation process in the ORIGEN2 manual, so this method is not used here.
9.2.3
Radiotoxicity comparison between U-core and Th-core
in PWR
A radiotoxicity comparison between U-core and Th-core in PWR is shown in
Fig. 9.6. Radiotoxicity of Th-core is 10%90% lower than that of U-core up to
1000 years, but after 10,000 years it becomes higher, and there is a peak around 0.1
million years (IAEA, to be published; Yoshioka et al., 2015). These curves are sim-
ilar to those of decay heat.
For

U-core
the
major
contributor
of
long-term
radiotoxicity
(10,000100,000 years) is 239Pu, and its contribution is almost half of the total
radiotoxicity. The U-core generates much plutonium, while the Th-core does not.
But, there is another contribution from 229Th in the Th-core. That is, the major
long-term contributor (10,000100,000 years) for the Th-core is 229Th, which is a
daughter of 233U (half-life of 159,200 years). The 229Th portion is almost half of
the total radiotoxicity.
239
Environment, waste, and resources

There are few preceding papers for radiotoxicity of the Th-cycle by governmen-
tal organizations. Only one paper by BNFL (UK) was found (Hesketh, 2005), which
provides similar results to the above ORIGEN2 result.
The components of radioactivity are shown in Fig. 9.7 for the U-core, and in Fig. 9.8
for the Th-core. Radioactivity by FPs is dominant up to 100 years, but it decreases rap-
idly after 100 years. After that, radioactivity by actinides becomes dominant.
If partitioning (separation of spent fuel actinides and FPs) is performed and all
actinides are recycled and transmuted in MSRs, in other reactors, or in accelerator-
driven systems (ADS), then total radiotoxicity decreases to that of FPs, which is
nearly that of natural 238U or 232Th.

240
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

The cause of the peak at 0.1 million years for Th-core is mainly from the contri-
butions by 233U and its daughters. In addition to 233U and its daughters, 234U and
its daughters also contribute to this peak. 234U is generated from the neutron
absorption of 233U, and it has a very long half-life of 245,500 years. These chains
cause the peak, which is known as “transient equilibrium” in the theory of radiation
chemistry (“Transient equilibrium”, 2015).
Fig. 9.9 shows four different curves. The top curve is the total radiotoxicity, and the
difference between top curve and the second curve shows the contribution from 233U
and its daughters. The difference between the second curve and the third curve shows
the contribution from 234U and its daughters. However, there is still a small peak around
10,000 years for the third curve. This small peak is caused by the decay of 231Pa, which
has a relatively long half-life of 32,760 years. 231Pa and its daughters cause a small
peak, which is known as “transient equilibrium.” In the reactor using thorium fuel,
232Th absorbs a high-energy neutron or gamma, and generates 231Th by (n,2n) or (γ,n)
reaction. And the following long decay chain starts as 231Th (Half-life: 25.52 h). 231Pa

min). 207Pb (stable).
The above results suggest that if the uranium in spent thorium fuel is removed,
for example, by fluorination technology, then the radiotoxicity can be greatly
reduced. If Th and its daughters are also separated and recycled, then radiotoxicity
can be further reduced.
Based on radiolysis results from MSRE, removal of uranium is a mandatory step
for safe and long-term disposal of spent MSR fuel (US-DOE, 1997). Fluorination is
a well-established technology used at an industrial scale as part of the conversion
process from uranium ore to fuel.

9.2.4
Effect of online reprocessing for MSR
ORNL proposed an online reprocessing system in order to improve the breeding
ratio, where most actinides could be recycled and transmuted in the MSR, and
radiotoxicity could be decreased. Since the actual simulation of online reprocessing
is difficult, the authors performed an alternative evaluation.
First of all, radiotoxicity by actinides is compared between UO2 spent fuel and
thorium fuel for PWR, and the result is shown in Fig. 9.10, where reprocessing is
not adopted for either case. As is shown in this figure, actinide radiotoxicity for tho-
rium fuel is lower than UO2 fuel up to 10,000 years, and after that, thorium fuel
radiotoxicity becomes higher.
MSR with Th-fuel is claimed to have lower radiotoxicity than conventional
UO2-PWR (David, 2007). Fig. 9.11 compares actinide radiotoxicity of spent U-fuel
without reprocessing and Th-core assuming recycling with 100% transmutation effi-
ciency, based on the above assumptions.
In order to compare the preceding paper, the data are shown in units of Sv/GWt/
year, that is this figure shows the actinide radiotoxicity of 1-year operation for
1 GW(thermal) plant.
The conversion procedure is as follows.
Using the above RT (radiotoxicity in units of Sv/ton-HM) for 45,000 MWd/t
fuel, and assuming 3000 MWt and 1000 MWe plant for 365 days operation with
100% load factor, annually discharged fuel weight (WT) is calculated by the
following formula.

plied by 24.3, that is:

And, if radiotoxicity per 1 GW(thermal)-year is required, the above RT must be
multiplied by 24.3/3(GWe) = 8.1. That is;

Radiotoxicity per 1 GWðthermalÞ-year ¼ WT=3:0 3 RT ¼ 8:1 3 RT
is used for conversion in Fig. 9.11.
Radiotoxicity by FPs is dominant up to 100 years, and the above effect appears after
several hundred years. The result is shown in Fig. 9.12, assuming 100% separation and
recycling for Th-core. In actual reprocessing, separation efficiency is not 100%, and
also recycled U and Th will generate new daughter nuclides in other MSR or in ADS,
and, as a result, reduction of radiotoxicity is less effective than shown here.
9.2.5
Radiotoxicity for PWR MOX fuel
Radiotoxicity for PWR MOX fuel is evaluated based on an ORIGEN2 calculation.
Here, 7.50% Pu-total content is assumed for MOX fuel corresponding to 45 GWd/t
discharge burnup. For simplicity, Pu is mixed with 100% 238U. Each Pu nuclide
fraction (Pu vector) before burnup is based on the ORIGEN2 calculation for the
4.0% enriched PWR UO2 fuel at 45 GWd/t, after 7 years decay by cooling and
reprocessing.
Radiotoxicity of MOX fuel is shown in Fig. 9.13 with the UO2 fuel result. The
radiotoxicity of MOX fuel is almost 45 times higher than that of UO2 fuel from
10 years to 1 million years. This is mainly because MOX fuel contains four times
more Pu than UO2 fuel at 45 GWd/t, and therefore, Pu and its daughter nuclides
contribute largely to radiotoxicity at a long time range. Another factor is contribu-
tion from 242Cm and 244Cm. For example, although the amount of 242Cm is small,
its half-life is very short at 162.8 days, and its radiotoxicity is large at 110 years.
The component of radiotoxicity for MOX fuel is shown in Fig. 9.14. General
trends of FPs and actinides are similar to UO2 fuel case, but, as is described above,
actinide contribution is large from 1 year to 1 million years range.

ORIGEN2 and DCF.
2. Radiotoxicity of Th-core is 1090% lower than that of U-core up to 1000 years, but after
10,000 years Th-core becomes higher, and there is a peak around 0.1 million years. These
curves are similar to those of decay heat.

3. Radiotoxicity of MOX fuel is 45 times higher than that of UO2 fuel from 10 to 1 million
years.
4. If reprocessing is applied for MSR and most actinides such as U, Th, and their daughters
are separated and recycled, then radiotoxicity after several hundred years can be greatly
reduced.
9.3
Nuclear waste from ThorCon type reactors
ThorCon reactors are described in Chapter 19, ThorCon reactor. After a few hun-
dred years, almost all the penetrating gamma radiation will be gone. The remaining
radiotoxicity is almost all alpha emission, which must be ingested or inhaled in
order to do harm. Most of the alpha emitters are chemically bound, such as in
oxides and fluoride salts, so they are not easily dispersed into the environment.
A 1 GWe ThorCon will return 20 tons/year of used fuel salt to the recycling facility.
The first step is to separate the uranium from the fuel salt via fluoride volatility, as in
the enrichment step. That will remove about 1.5 tons of 9% LEU from the waste
stream. This uranium can be used as part of the initial fuel charge for other ThorCons,
or it could be re-enriched. Either way it will be returned to the plants. (See also
Chapter 8: Chemical processing of liquid fuel, on chemical processing.)
In the re-enrichment case, we will have about 1000 kg (52 L) of depleted uranium.
The depleted uranium will contain some residual 232U, 233U, and 234U (25 ppm, 4%,
and 0.7% respectively prior to enrichment) that will impact the radiotoxicity profile
and needs to be considered when planning disposal. The next step will be vacuum dis-
tillation to recover the salt and thorium, which removes over 80% of the volume. The
recovered salt will be returned to the reactors, leaving about 7 tons of ash. Thorium has
little economic value and is not a significant waste issue to the impetus for thoroughly
removing thorium from the waste stream. This ash will be mostly residual ThF4 but
will contain 103 kg of transuranics and 789 kg of FPs. The volume of this ash will be
about 1.1 m3 per GWe-year of power, which will be stored in dry casks.
(Technological progress may later make it economic or socially required to separate
out the transuranics for recycle back to the reactors.) The transuranics and thorium can
be completely recycled to the limits of extraction efficiencies.
The remaining FPs can be stored in dry casks for 500 years, when they will have
decayed to near background levels. (A coal plant produces about 100,000 times
more solid waste per GWe-y than a ThorCon power plant.) There will also be some
ancillary waste streams:

Resource utilization
This section discusses thorium and helium resource issues relative to MSRs.
9.4.1
Thorium
9.4.1.1
Properties and resources
Thorium can be the basis of a valuable 232Th-233U nuclear fuel cycle, possessing
more attractive characteristics compared with the present 238U-239Pu fuel cycle (see
Chapters 1: Introduction and 7: Materials).
Thorium (Th), named after Thor, the Scandinavian god of thunder, occurs in nature
in a single isotope: 232Th. Its large abundance can make it valuable for future electrical
energy generation with supplies exceeding both coal and uranium combined.
Since natural thorium does not contain fissile materials, such as 233U, some fis-
sile material (233U, 235U, 239Pu) must be added to start up a thorium MSR. This
could come from several sources, including an (ADS; Chapter 15: Accelerator
driven systems), dismantled weapons Pu, spent LWR fuel, and fusionfission
hybrids (Chapter 13: Solid fuel, salt-cooled reactors).
In a thorium-fueled reactor, fertile material 232Th is converted to fissile material
233U by the following neutron absorption reaction:
232Th (n,γ) 233Th (β2: 22.3 m half-life) 233Pa (β2: 27 d half-life) 233U.
Fig. 9.15 shows simplified burnup chains in the thorium cycle.
Repeating successive neutron absorptions, 233U is converted to 234U, 235U, 236U,
237Np, 238Pu, and finally to 239Pu. Since this is a long process, production of Pu is

very small compared with the U fuel cycle. This small production of Pu makes the
Th-fueled reactor a nuclear weapon proliferation-resistant technology. Also, produc-
tion of long-lived minor actinides (MA) such as curium (Cm) and americium (Am)
are very small, because these isotopes are mostly produced by neutron absorption
of Pu isotopes.
As for other long-lived MA in U fuel, neptunium (237Np) is produced mainly by
the decay of 237U, which comes mainly from two times neutron absorption to 235U.
As for Th+233U fuel, a small amount of 237Np is produced, because 237U is pro-
duced by four times neutron absorption in 233U.
The thorium radioactive decay chain leads to stable lead isotopes with a half-life
of 1.4 3 1010 years for 232Th. Its decay contributes to the internal heat generation
in the Earth.
Radon (Rn) is one of the causes of lung cancer, because of its radioactivity.
Radon is gaseous at room temperature. The most well-known nuclide is 222Rn,
which is the sixth decay product of 238U, and another isotope is 220Rn (sometimes
called as thoron), which is the fifth decay product of 232Th. Both nuclides are emit-
ted from the earth and from some house construction materials. So, they may be
inhaled by humans, mostly in homes.
Metallic thorium can be produced by:
1. Reduction of ThO2 using calcium or magnesium;
2. Electrolysis of anhydrous thorium chloride in a fused mixture of Na and K chlorides;
3. Calcium reduction of ThCl4 mixed with anhydrous zinc chloride;
4. Reduction of ThCl4 by an alkali metal.
Thorium is the second member of the actinides series in the periodic table of the
elements. When pure, it is soft and ductile, can be cold-rolled and drawn. It is a sil-
very white metal retaining its luster in air for several months. If contaminated by
the oxide, it tarnishes in air into a gray then black color.
Thorium oxide has the highest melting temperature of all the oxides at 3300C.
Just a few other elements and compounds have a higher melting point, such as tung-
sten and tantalum carbide. Water attacks it slowly, and acids do not attack it, except
for hydrochloric acid.
Thorium in powder form is pyrophoric and can burn in air with a bright white
light. In portable gas lights the Welsbach mantle is prepared with ThO2 with 1%
cerium oxide and other ingredients (Fig. 9.16).
As an alloying element in magnesium, it gives high strength and creep resis-
tance at high temperatures. Tungsten wire and electrodes used in electrical and
electronic equipment such as electron guns in X-ray tubes or video screens are
coated with Th due to its low work function and associated high electron emis-
sion. Its oxide is used to control the grain size of tungsten used in light bulbs
and in high-temperature laboratory crucibles. Glasses for lenses in cameras and
scientific instruments are doped with Th to give them a high refractive index and
low dispersion of light. In the petroleum industry it is used as a catalyst in the
conversion of ammonia to nitric acid, in oil cracking, and in the production of
sulfuric acid.

Thorium minerals
Thorium occurs in several minerals (Hedrick, 2009; Van Gosen et al., 2009).
Table 9.3 shows compositions of some Th ores.
Monazite (Ce,La,Y,Th)PO4, is a rare earth-thorium phosphate with 55.5 hard-
ness. Its Th content is 3%22% with 14% rare earth elements and yttrium. It
occurs as a yellowish, reddish-brown to brown, with shades of green, nearly white,
yellowish brown, and yellow ore (Fig. 9.17). This is the primary source of the
world’s thorium production. Until World War II, thorium was extracted from mona-
zite as a primary product for use in products such as camping lamp mantles. Since
World War II, monazite has been primarily mined for its rare earth elements con-
tent. Thorium was extracted in small amounts and mainly discarded as waste.
Thorite (Th,U)SiO4 is a thorium-uranium silicate with a 4.5 hardness with yel-
low, yellow-brown, red-brown, green, and orange to black colors. It shares a 22%

thorite variety.
The joint occurrence of Th and the rare earth elements in some ores such as
monazite and thorogummite (Th(SiO4)1-x (OH)4x), a variant of thorite containing
hydroxyl, is shown in Table 9.4.
It occurs as nodules 0.51.0 in. in diameter in residual soil and weathered bed-
rock and appears associated with hematite, an iron oxide (Kennedy, 2009). Many

rare earth ores contain Th (Table 9.5). In mining circles, Th and U are considered
as “contaminants” favoring the mining of ores with low Th and U content.
Concentrated deposits occur as vein deposits, and disseminated deposits occur as
massive carbonatite stocks, alkaline intrusions, and black sand placer or alluvial
stream and beach deposits. Carbonatites are rare carbonate igneous rocks formed by
magmatic or metasomatic processes. Most of these are composed of 50% or higher
carbonate minerals such as calcite, dolomite, and ankerite. They occur near alkaline
igneous rocks.

The alkaline igneous rocks, also referred to as alkali rocks, have formed from
magmas and fluids so enriched in alkali elements that Na- and K-bearing minerals
form components of the rocks in larger proportion than usual igneous rocks. They
are characterized by feldspathoid minerals and/or alkali pyroxenes and amphiboles
(Gosen et al., 2009).

9.4.1.3
Thorium abundance
Thorium is about four times more abundant than uranium in the Earth’s crust and
presents a more abundant long-term fuel resource (Table 9.6).
The thorium mass in the Earth’s crust is estimated at 120 trillion tons. It can be
extracted from granite rocks and from phosphate rock deposits, rare earths, tin ores,
coal, and uranium mine tailings. Its occurrence is associated with the rare earth ele-
ments as well as yttrium and scandium, which are acquiring heightened interest in
their use in renewable energy technologies. The tantalite [(Fe, Mn) Ta2O6], colum-
bite (niobite) [(Fe, Mn) Nb2O6], and columbite-tantalite (coltan) ores, used to man-
ufacture tantalum capacitors in consumer electronics, also contain thorium.
It has even been suggested that thorium could be extracted from the ash of coal
power plants. A 1000 MWe coal power plant generates about 13 tons of thorium
per year in its ash. Each ton of thorium can in turn generate 1 000 MWe of power
in a well optimized thorium reactor. Thus, the ash from a coal power plant could
conceptually fuel 13 thorium plants of its own power.
The calcium sulfate or phospho-gypsum resulting as a waste from phosphorites
or phosphate rock processing into phosphate fertilizer contains substantial amounts
of unextracted thorium and uranium.
Uranium mines with brannerite ores generated millions of tons of surface tailings
containing thoria and rare earths.

Thorium resources
Many countries have substantial thorium resources (Table 9.7).
There are also Th resources on the moon (Fig. 9.21).
Table 9.8 and Fig. 9.22 show the distribution of thorium reserves in the United
States.
A large part is located on properties held by Thorium Energy Inc. at Lemhi Pass
in Montana and Idaho (Fig. 9.23).
9.4.2
Helium resource
Helium (He) is relevant to MSR, because it may be used in a closed Brayton cycle.
Small amounts are used in the He bubbling system to remove gaseous FPs (several
m3 for 1 GWe-MSBR).
Soon after He mining was developed at the turn of the 20th century, the USA
established a National Helium Reserve in 1925. During the Second World War,
helium was strategically important because of its use in military airships.

When the Cold War came along, helium became even more important because of
its uses in the purging of rocket fuel in intercontinental ballistic missiles. The national
reserve was established in the porous rock of a disused natural gas field 30 miles
north of Amarillo, which soon became known as the helium capital of the world.
A billion m3, or about half of the world’s reserves are stored in this cluster of
mines, pipes, and vats that extend underground for more than 200 miles from
Amarillo to Kansas.

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

In 1996, the United States passed the Helium Privatization Act which directed
that this reserve should be sold by 2015 at a price that would substantially pay off
the federal government’s original investment in building up the reserve.
At the current rate of consumption, US stock at the Cliffside site will be empty
within several years, and the Earth may be helium-free by the end of the 21st cen-
tury. Based on this speculation, the price of helium has more than doubled over the
20032013 period (Fig. 9.24).
As is described above, a discount sale by the US stock is ending, but it does not
mean to exhaust the He resource on the Earth. Production of He is continuing at
natural gas plants, and its recent trend is shown in Fig. 9.25. In a short time range,
production will be slightly decreasing, meanwhile demand may increase, and then a
shortage may occur. In order to see what will happen in the long-term, reserves on
the Earth must be known.

Environment, waste, and resources

Both cheap reserves of He and technically possible reserves of He are shown in
Fig. 9.26. It suggests that cheap He will be exhausted within 50 years, but the Earth
has 300 years of He resources, if current production and demand continue.

Summary
In this chapter, decay heat and radiotoxicity for PWR thorium fuel cycle are com-
pared with the conventional PWR uranium fuel cycle, using ORIGEN2 code. Both
decay heat and radiotoxicity have some difference, but, in general, the difference is
not large except around 0.1 million years.
If reprocessing is applied for MSR and most actinides such as U, Th, and their
daughters are separated and recycled, then both decay heat and radiotoxicity after
several hundred years can be greatly reduced.
A rough estimate for a ThorCon type molten salt reactor was shown. Thorium is
abundant and is a byproduct of rare earth mining, but its radioactivity restricts its
handling in the United States. The United States no longer conserves helium, in
spite of the growing need for superconducting wires, motors, and magnets.

In this chapter we introduce the reader to the concepts of nonproliferation: safe-
guards and security. We briefly discuss identified threats to the peaceful nuclear
fuel cycle as well as possible targets, and describe the existing nuclear safeguards
system. We also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the molten salt reactor
(MSR) fuel cycle in terms of nonproliferation and compare it to that of the light-
water reactor fuel cycle, which is widely implemented today.

Introduction to nonproliferation
and nuclear safeguards
An important nonproliferation treaty is the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons (NPT), signed by a vast majority of the world’s states. Its success
stems from the fact that a very large fraction of the world’s states have signed it,
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-08-101126-3.00010-5

and that it has been an efficient way to slow down the nuclear arms race. This
treaty specifies the duties and responsibilities associated with the peaceful use of
nuclear power technology in an effort to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. In
order to assure that states honor their international obligations, and in order to
detect any misuse of nuclear material or technology, a set of technical measures
referred to as safeguards are applied. As defined by the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA),
. . . the objective of safeguards is the timely detection of diversion of significant
quantities of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities to the manufacture
of nuclear weapons or of other nuclear explosive devices or for purposes unknown,
and deterrence of such diversion by the risk of early detection (IAEA, 1972, p. 9)
The timely detection in practice means that detection times for possible diversion
should be shorter than the time required to transform the diverted material to a
form in which it may be used in a nuclear explosive devices (NEDs). The signifi-
cant quantity is the approximate amount of nuclear material for which the possibil-
ity of manufacturing a NED cannot be excluded. The safeguards aim to verify the
completeness and correctness of declarations on nuclear material and activities.
Hence, the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons is strongly connected to the existing
nuclear activities and the nuclear safeguards applied to them.
In this part of the book we will elaborate on nonproliferation aspects of the MSR
with respect to nuclear weapons technology, the nonproliferation threat, and nuclear
safeguards, before discussing the advantages and disadvantages of MSRs.
10.2
The proliferation threat
We consider in this chapter the target for a possible nuclear proliferator to be
nuclear material for the manufacture of one or several NEDs. However, we point
out that in addition to the nuclear material itself, the actors must also be able to
manufacture the weapon in order to acquire the NED. Depending on the type
and amount of nuclear material, a different set of knowledge, financial resources,
facilities, etc. may be required.
There are a number of actors who may be considered to pose a threat. We have
chosen to mention two types of threats: that of a state and that of an independent
actor, such as a terrorist group.
A state could, openly or covertly, decide to proceed on the path of acquiring
material for nuclear weapons in noncompliance with the NPT. In the open scenario,
a state could declare that it will withdraw from the NPT, as the Democratic
People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) did in 2003. Alternatively, states could decide
not to sign the NPT and develop and test NEDs on their own, as India did in 1974
and Pakistan in 1998. In the covert scenario, a state could construct clandestine
facilities or have covert nuclear weapons programs, as was discovered in Iraq in the
262
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

1990s (UN, 1997; IAEA, 2003) and in Iran in 2002 (The IAEA Board of
Governors, 2011). Finally, an independent actor would rather try to attack or
manipulate parts of the fuel cycle, or covertly introduce new activities without the
knowledge of the host state.
Depending on who the proliferator is, the threat looks different. One often distin-
guishes between state and nonstate actors (NSA) and the line between the two is
not always clear. Examples of NSA could be different types of national or interna-
tional groups such as corporations, private sector entities, terrorist groups, nongov-
ernmental bodies, etc. Different proliferators have different resources and different
concerns.
10.3
Attractiveness of nuclear materials
The basic principle of a nuclear explosive is rather simple. The starting configura-
tion is a subcritical assembly of one or several pieces of a nuclear material that can
sustain a fast neutron chain reaction. The nuclear material is quickly assembled to
an overcritical configuration. A precisely timed neutron source initiates a supercriti-
cal chain reaction, which stops when the assembly becomes subcritical again. There
are a number of different nuclear materials that can be used in a NED.
For example, in International Atomic Energy Agency(2011) the two uranium
isotopes U-233 and U-235 as well as plutonium are listed. Uranium enriched to
more than 20% U-235 (Bathke et al., 2012) is graded as high-enriched uranium
(HEU). This limit corresponds roughly to the lowest enrichment of U-235 that is
capable of sustaining a fast neutron chain reaction, which is a prerequisite for a
NED. However, higher enrichments will result in a considerably lower critical
mass, which is beneficial for nuclear weapons design. In Bathke (2010), an enrich-
ment above 80% U-235 is mentioned as a generic definition of weapons-grade ura-
nium. In principle, any composition of plutonium can sustain a fast neutron chain
reaction and is therefore weapons usable. But as will be explained later, the isotope
Pu-239 is the most suitable for weapons design, and a plutonium mix containing at
least 93% of Pu-239 is considered weapons-grade plutonium (WGPu). Some basic
properties of U-233, HEU, as well as WGPu of relevance to nonproliferation are
given in Table 10.1.

Nonproliferation and safeguards aspects of the MSR fuel cycle

To understand what makes a nuclear material attractive or unattractive, we con-
sider three properties that complicate the design of a nuclear explosive: the dose
rate a person would receive when handling the material, the heat generation of the
material, and its spontaneous neutron generation.
When the attractiveness is discussed, it should be pointed out that even if some
materials are less attractive than others, there are no “safe” materials that meet the
above-mentioned criterion on sustaining a fast neutron chain reaction. Any isotopic
composition that can sustain a fast neutron chain reaction can in principle be used
as raw material for a nuclear explosive; in this regard, there is no proliferation-
proof fuel cycle. On the other hand, it is generally considered that a fuel cycle that
minimizes the attractiveness of the materials as much as possible is more
proliferation-resistant than others and should be encouraged (Bathke et al., 2012).
10.3.1
Heat generation
The heat generation originates from the fact that all weapons-usable isotopes are
unstable and produce heat in connection to radioactive decay. The heat generation
is determined from the half-life of the isotopes in the material as well as their decay
types. Typically, an alpha decay releases more energy, and hence more heat, than
beta decays. The exact isotopic composition of the material is therefore important.
For example, HEU has a negligible heat generation while a critical mass of
WGPu has a heat generation of about 14 W (Table 10.1). The heat from WGPu
mainly originates from the beta decay of Pu-239 and Pu-240 and is enough to make
it feel hot upon touching. It is however not enough to considerably complicate the
design of a weapon. On the other hand, reactor-grade plutonium (RGPu) typically
found in spent light-water reactor (LWR) fuel will have a few percent of Pu-238,
which has a relatively strong heat production due to its alpha decay (half-life 88
years). This can result in a heat production of around 100200 W for a critical
mass. Even if it is still usable as a weapons material, the heat generation introduces
some complications in the design of a weapon. Plutonium from high-burnup LWR
fuel can therefore be considered more proliferation-resistant than HEU and WGPu.
For U-233, the heat generation is about one-tenth of that for WGPu (Table 10.1),
which makes heat a nonissue in nuclear weapons design.
10.3.2
Spontaneous neutron generation
Neutrons are released from spontaneous fission events in the weapons material. If
such a neutron is generated during the implosion phase of an NED, but before it
has reached optimum reactivity, a chain reaction can be initiated prematurely.
Some nuclear weapon designs are sensitive to preinitiation, and the use of materials
with a comparatively strong neutron generation, such as reactor-grade plutonium,
can substantially degrade the yield of such designs (DOE, 1997). Therefore, for an
unadvanced proliferator, preinitiation is an issue if a high and reliable yield is
desired. However, it should be mentioned in this context that even if preinitiation
occurs at the worst possible moment, when the material first reaches prompt
264
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

criticality, the explosive yield of a relatively simple first-generation device will still
be of the order of one or a few thousand tons of TNT equivalent. This is still a sig-
nificant yield and far greater than any conventional weapon ever manufactured.
10.3.3
Radiation
The radiation from a nuclear material will also impose a proliferation barrier. If the
material is strongly radioactive, the weapon would need to be manufactured in
remotely controlled hot-cells. For an unskilled proliferator, like a terrorist group,
such facilities are less likely to be available. For this reason, the IAEA has consid-
ered materials that would give a dose rate of 100 rem/h to a person handling them
as self-protecting (Doyle, 2008). After receiving a dose of 300 rem, or 100 rem/h
for 3 hours, there is a 50% probability of survival.
However, a terrorist organization or a totalitarian state might be less concerned
about the health of the weapons manufacturers. In the example considered above,
the time to death is about 1 month (ORNL, 2005), which means that the dose rate is
not high enough to prevent a dedicated proliferator from acquiring a working NED.
The dose rate must be significantly higher than 100 rem/h to consider the material as
self-protecting. In Bathke et al. (2012) a level of 1000 rem/h is considered enough to
achieve a significant increase in the proliferation resistance of the material.
None of the fissile materials discussed above (U-233, HEU, and WGPu) has any
significant radiation, and they can all be handled with minimal radiation protection.
However, when U-233 is produced via neutron capture in Th-232, a small amount
of U-232 is also produced. U-232 is an isotope that first decays to Th-228 and even-
tually to Tl-208, which in 36% of the decays emits a very energetic gamma ray
at 2.6 MeV. This gamma emission makes handling of material contaminated with
U-232 very difficult. The high-energy of the gamma ray also makes shielding more
difficult compared with materials that emit gamma rays with lower energies. Due to
the relatively long half-life of Th-228 (1.91 years), the dose from U-232 initially
increases with time. The strong radiation from the decay of U-232 is positive from
a nonproliferation point of view, but unwanted by operators of MSRs, since the
consequence is that the material needs to be handled remotely in hot-cells. To reach
a significant level of self-protection, several percent of U-232 is needed (Moir,
2010). The amount of U-232 in the fuel depends strongly on the exact type of reac-
tor, but in a simulation of a thorium-fueled molten salt breeder reactor (MSBR)
(Vanderhaegen and Janssens-Maenhout, 2010), a level of about 60 ppm U-232 was
reached after 2.5 years of full-power operation. This is several orders of magnitude
lower than what is required for the material to be considered as self-protecting.
10.4
Nuclear safeguards
In order to address the nuclear threat and prevent the spread of nuclear weapons,
the nuclear safeguards system was created. It was founded in the late 1950s as a
265
Nonproliferation and safeguards aspects of the MSR fuel cycle

response to the manufacture and testing of nuclear weapons by several states, with
the establishment of the IAEA and Euratom. The safeguards system comprises all
parts of the nuclear fuel cycle, i.e., all activities and facilities ranging from mining
the ore to the reprocessing or storage of spent nuclear fuel. In order to ensure the
full compliance of states to treaties regulating the nonproliferation of nuclear weap-
ons technologies, the IAEA together with other inspecting authorities take a number
of measures. For example, they verify documentation provided by operators, inspect
facilities, measure material samples, conduct surveillance, and perform export con-
trol. The materials of interest are mainly special nuclear material (SNM), which
means plutonium, uranium-233, or uranium enriched in the isotopes uranium-233
or uranium-235.
The basis for all nuclear safeguards activities is the NPT, with 191 state parties.
In this treaty, a distinction is made between nonnuclear weapons states (NNWS)
and nuclear weapons states (NWS)—originally corresponding to the UK, France,
the US, the Soviet Union, and China—concerning their obligations. This distinction
remains today, with a consequence being that NWS are not expected to provide the
same transparency to inspecting authorities as NNWS. In addition to the NPT, the
Additional Protocol (AP), which further strengthens international safeguards, has
entered into force in many states. Also, the focus has, since the late 1990s, been to
the implement Integrated Safeguards, which describes efforts to reach an optimal
combination of all safeguards measures available to the IAEA, in order to achieve
maximum effectiveness and efficiency within the available resources.
With an increasing number of nuclear facilities and the foreseen introduction of
innovative fuel cycles, the IAEA has taken a step in the direction of more effective
and efficient implementation of IAEA safeguards (Nackaerts, 2010; IAEA, 2015).
The IAEA is, among other things, promoting Safeguards-By-Design (or SBD)
(IAEA, 2013), which should be seen as an approach whereby international safe-
guards are fully integrated into the design process of a nuclear facility—from initial
planning through design, construction, operation, and decommissioning (IAEA,
2009). The IAEA has actively supported efforts relating to nuclear safeguards appli-
cations to innovative fuel cycles via the INPRO project (INPRO, 2015) and the
Generation IV International Forum (GIF, 2015) with the development of, for exam-
ple, assessment methodologies for proliferation resistance. In parallel, the IAEA is
working together with member states to define both an SBD framework and a pro-
cess that provides sufficient guidance for operators of nuclear fuel cycle facilities to
implement SBD. This should include, e.g., the development of basic principles and
design features, definition of roles and responsibilities, and guidance documents
(IAEA, 2013).
Since no commercial MSR has ever been operated, there is no answer to what a
safeguards system for such a reactor type would look like. However, we can expect
that it will have to be at least as effective as that of today’s nuclear energy sys-
tems. In this chapter, we will therefore compare the fundamentals of the MSR fuel
cycle with that of the LWR and identify the most sensitive parts in the two. The
way the sensitive parts of the LWR fuel cycle are handled today can provide a
guideline to what the safeguards implementation of an MSR fuel cycle would look
266
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

like. The following three subsections are devoted to describing the LWR and MSR
fuel cycles from a safeguards perspective: we briefly describe the respective fuel
cycles and identify the parts which are most sensitive from a nonproliferation
point-of-view.
10.4.1
Safeguarding the LWR fuel cycle
Nuclear safeguards are applied to the complete fuel cycle and not only to the reac-
tors. A simplified description of the standard LWR fuel cycle is shown in Fig. 10.1.
The natural uranium that is mined is a rather weak proliferation threat. It is not pos-
sible to design a nuclear weapon from its isotopic composition, and it cannot be
used as fuel in a light-water reactor. In the enrichment process, the concentration of
the fissile isotope U235 is raised to about 4%. Although this material is also not
usable in a weapon, the enrichment process can easily be modified to produce
HEU with more than 80% U235. In fact about 80% of the work needed to raise
the enrichment to 80% is already done when LEU is produced. The enrichment
facilities are therefore highly sensitive from a nonproliferation perspective and need
to be meticulously safeguarded. A further complication here is that the material is
not handled in discrete units, like fuel assemblies, but rather as continuous material
flows. This makes it easier to continuously divert a small stream of sensitive
material.
During the remainder of the standard LWR fuel cycle, i.e., without reprocessing,
the nonproliferation risks are less pronounced. The low-enriched uranium that
leaves the enrichment plant can be used as fuel in an LWR, but the U-235 concen-
tration is too low to be used in an NED. When the fuel is taken out of the core, it
typically contains about 1% of reactor-grade plutonium. As was discussed above,
this is not the preferred material for an NED, but is nevertheless usable. It will how-
ever need an additional reprocessing step where the plutonium is separated from the
other actinides as well as the fission products.

Nonproliferation and safeguards aspects of the MSR fuel cycle

Further, the material is contained in well-defined fuel assemblies, typically about
4 m high, which makes the safeguards process simpler since remotely handled cam-
eras can be used to guarantee the continuity of knowledge. For this reason, divert-
ing small quantities of sensitive material is very difficult.
Also, when the spent fuel is taken out of the reactor it is highly radioactive and
cannot be handled directly, even if health concerns are not an issue. Typically, the
spent fuel assemblies are handled submerged in storage pools, and transportation of
one or more assemblies from the reactor sites is done in large and heavy transport
casks. This is a slow process, which significantly simplifies the safeguarding of the
operations. Safeguards personnel are typically only needed on-site when the reactor
is refueled or when fuel is moved.
In the case of CANada Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) reactors with online
refueling, a number of solutions have been identified and deemed sufficient for
nuclear safeguards purposes. These include frequent (and costly) inspections
(Leaver, 2009), the use of extrinsic as well as intrinsic proliferation barriers
(Whitlock and Lee, 2009), and continuous cooperation with the IAEA to ensure
satisfactory solutions in the development of new reactor concepts (Ellacott
et al., 2010).
Some countries operate light-water reactors with a semiclosed fuel cycle in
which plutonium is separated from the fuel and reused in the reactors in the form of
Mixed oxide fuel (MOX) fuel. The flow is illustrated in Fig. 10.1 as dashed lines.
The reprocessing of spent fuel may be a controversial activity from a nuclear safe-
guards point of view since sensitive nuclear materials in the form of uranium and
plutonium are separated from other actinides as well as the fission products. Not
only is weapons-usable material separated, the self-protecting radiation barrier that
the fission products provided is also lost, and the well-defined fuel assemblies are
replaced with a more continuous material flow where a slow diversion of small
quantities is made easier. This opens up for a gradual accumulation of significant
quantities of weapons material.
Partly for these reasons, civilian reprocessing has mainly been carried out in
NWS. One exception is Japan, which has a reprocessing plant (Rokkasho) with a
capacity of 800 tons of uranium per year (Japan Nuclear Fuel Limited, 2015). The
safeguarding of the Rokkasho plant is extensive and includes, among other things,
an IAEA-operated on-site laboratory that samples every step of the process
(Duhamel et al., 2004). The onsite laboratory is permanently staffed with IAEA per-
sonnel. Further, the Plutonium Uranium Redox EXtraction (PUREX) process itself
is also a modified variant in which pure plutonium is not separated, but a mixture
of uranium and plutonium. This reduces the attractiveness of the separated material
somewhat.
10.4.2
Safeguarding the MSR fuel cycle
When comparing the safeguards of the MSR fuel cycle with that of today’s conven-
tional reactors we have chosen the traditional MSBR fuel cycle as a reference.
It should be stressed that a number of alternative MSR fuel cycles have been
268
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

suggested. Some of these do not include any reprocessing of spent fuel. This makes
them less problematic from a safeguards point of view compared to fuel cycles with
extensive reprocessing. One such example is the Integral Molten Salt Reactor
(IMSR) presented in Chapter 18, Integral molten salt reactor.
However, the MSBR fuel cycle is the only one with, at least partial, operational
experience. In the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) the graphite-moderated
core was tested (Rosenthal et al.,1972; Haubenreich and Engel, 1970), but the
breeding of fissile material was made in other reactors. Even if the analysis pre-
sented here is focused on the MSBR fuel cycle, many of the conclusions are still
valid for the other proposed fuel cycles. From a safeguards perspective, it can be
noted that recent research activities have focused to a larger extent on the transura-
nic waste-burning capabilities of the MSRs; for example the MOSART design in
Russia (Ignatiev et al., 2007) as well as the thorium molten salt reactor, which com-
bines a high fissile concentration with a partial blanket (Merle-Lucotte et al., 2007).
A simplification of the MSBR fuel cycle is schematically shown in Fig. 10.2.
Excluded from this figure is the start-up fissile material for the fuel cycle. This is
typically proposed to be uranium enriched to 20%, or plutonium from LWR
spent nuclear fuel. It can be noted that both of these materials are also of significant
safeguards interest, as discussed in Section 10.4.1.
The natural resource in the MSR fuel cycle, here thorium, is not considered to
be a significant proliferation threat by itself. This is in common with the LWR fuel
cycle. In fact, natural thorium contains no fissile isotopes at all. A reprocessing step
is perceived in which fission products are separated, and the bred fissile fuel is
returned to the reactor. In the MSBR fuel cycle, a conversion ratio of 1 is envis-
aged, and for this reason, no enrichment is needed. Also, in contrast to the LWR
fuel cycle, refueling and reprocessing of an MSR are performed on-line with the

fuel in liquid form. There are therefore no well-defined fuel assemblies as in the
LWR fuel cycle.
In the case of the MSBR (McNeese et al., 1974), the reprocessing takes place in
three steps in areas outside the reactor. In the first step, uranium is separated from
the salt via a fluorination process. In the second step, protactinium, fission products,
and rare-earth metals are removed. The protactinium stream is then directed to a
decay tank where it decays to uranium. In the third step, UF6 is reduced to UF4.
This keeps the Pa-231 concentration in the fuel salt low, and hence reduces also the
U-232 levels. The decay tank outside the reactor is needed to enhance the breeding
capability of the reactor. If the protactinium were allowed to circulate in the reactor
core, parasitic neutron absorption in Pa-233 would result in the production of fertile
U-234 instead of the fissile U-233.
The uranium that is obtained in the decay tank is mainly composed of U-233,
which is a weapons material as discussed above. However, since both Pa-233
(which decays to U-233) and Pa-232 (which decays to U-232) are separated
together, the resulting uranium stream will always contain a fraction of highly
gamma-radiating U-232. This is beneficial from a nonproliferation point of view as
the resulting uranium stream will build up a radioactive proliferation barrier.
The high-energy gamma radiation will also be difficult to shield, and the signature
in the gamma emission makes any diversion possible to detect by gamma monitors.
Nevertheless, it is possible to modify the MSR fuel cycle to produce almost pure
U-233. This is illustrated in Fig. 10.2 as dashed lines in the bottom of the figure.
Pa-232 has a half-life of only 1.3 days, in contrast to 27 days for Pa-233. If the Pa
stream from the reprocessing stage is first allowed to decay in a short intermediate
decay step, most of the Pa-232 will have decayed to U-232, while only a small frac-
tion of Pa-233 has decayed to U-233. For example, after 2 weeks more than 99.9%
of the Pa-232 has decayed to U-232 while only 30% of the Pa-233 has decayed to
U-233. If the resulting Pa/U mix is separated in a clandestine facility, almost pure
Pa-233 can be obtained which will then decay to almost pure U-233 in a second
decay step. For safeguards purposes, this points to the importance of accurate salt
composition and materials flow monitoring.
Although we are here mainly considering the reprocessing for the MSBR, it can
be pointed out that other MSR concepts foresee varying degrees of reprocessing
and that different reprocessing options have been (and are) considered. For exam-
ple, in the proposed reprocessing for the future MSR (GIF, 2011), uranium, minor
actinides (neptunium, plutonium, americium, and curium), and protactinium are
removed from the fuel salt and sent back to the core using a fluorination process
and an extraction loop.
In the present Non-Proliferation Treaty, there are no formal barriers for any
country to deploy reprocessing technologies. However, the safeguards requirements
for such facilities will probably be extensive. The Rokkasho reprocessing plant dis-
cussed above could likely serve as a guideline to what would be required in a non-
nuclear weapons country (Johnson and Lockwood, 2011). The material streams in
an MSR reprocessing stage must be strictly safeguarded to guarantee that no illicit
activities take place covertly, and depending on the implementation of the reproces-
sing, the degree of proliferation resistance of the fuel cycle varies.

10.5
Nonproliferation advantages and
disadvantages with MSRs
In order to summarize the nonproliferation advantages and disadvantages with
MSRs, we first clarify objective differences to LWRs and then proceed with details
on their interpretation and nonproliferation implications.
10.5.1
Fundamental differences between MSRs and LWRs
The operational experience of MSRs is today very limited, which makes it difficult
to draw conclusions on the full range of implementations that are possible. The
Aircraft Reactor Experiment operated in 1954, and the MSRE was in operation
between 1965 and 1969.
10.5.1.1
The fuel cycle
Starting with a comparison of the steps involved in the LWR and MSR fuel cycles,
a number of substantial differences can be identified. The largest difference is that
the LWR fuel cycle is an open cycle (or partly closed, considering reprocessing and
MOX fuel fabrication), while the MSR fuel cycle is typically fully closed and relies
on complete fuel reprocessing. There are also substantial differences between the
materials in the fuel cycles. In the LWR cycle, enrichment and reprocessing activi-
ties handle bulk material while the part from fuel fabrication and onwards handles
items (fuel elements). In the MSR cycle, all materials are in bulk form at all times.
Also, the extent and types of reprocessing differ between the fuel cycles.
Typically, the MSR fuel cycle relies to a much higher degree on reprocessing than
the LWR fuel cycle. Furthermore, MSRs foresee online reprocessing, which is cur-
rently not done in any nonnuclear weapons state. It should also be noted that the
LWR fuel cycle employs an aqueous reprocessing technique (such as PUREX),
while the MSR fuel cycle is likely to employ fluoride volatilization (removal of
uranium from the fuel salt before further processing for fission products), molten
salt/liquid metal extraction techniques, and pyroprocessing. There are fundamental
differences between these types of reprocessing technologies, which in turn have
implications for the design of the safeguards system (Uhlir et al., 2007; Durst et al.,
2007; Li et al., 2011).
10.5.1.2
The reactor
A difference that is not clearly seen from the comparison of the fuel cycles con-
cerns the reactors themselves. The majority of today’s commercial reactors—except
CANDU reactors currently used in Canada, India, and the Republic of Korea—are
shut down for revision and refueling. It is physically not possible to access the fuel
inside the reactor while it is in operation. This simplifies the verification of the
nuclear material to periods when the fuel is accessible. On the other hand, MSRs
rely on online refueling, which makes it possible to access fuel also during reactor
271
Nonproliferation and safeguards aspects of the MSR fuel cycle

operations. Further, while CANDU reactors are refueled online with natural ura-
nium, MSRs are refueled with reprocessed fissile material.
10.5.1.3
The fuel
MSR fuels have characteristics that differ from fuels that are used in the LWR fuel
cycle and are based on the use of mainly U-235 as fuel material. One aspect of this
is the liquid fuel, which is very different from the fuel assemblies that are part of a
conventional LWR core. For fuel assemblies residing in the storage pool outside
the reactor, a remotely controlled surveillance camera is typically used to guarantee
that no tampering of the fuel has occurred. No sensitive materials can be diverted
as long as no movements of the fuel assemblies are detected. With liquid fuels,
more advanced monitoring systems are required to ensure that no sensitive materi-
als have been diverted.
Another aspect is the material itself, which is primarily not based on the use of
U-235, but rather on U-233/Th-232 of very high quality, or alternatively plutonium.
Depending on the choice of reprocessing technique, the fuel salt is treated in differ-
ent ways and goes through a number of separation steps (online and offline) with
the remaining fuel being sent back to the core (although the thorium recycling tech-
nology is currently only under development). Some, but not all, MSR designs also
include a fertile blanket where new fuel is bred, and occasionally fractions of the
fertile salt may also be reprocessed and then sent back to the core.
In the one-fluid design MSRE campaign, uranium-235 tetrafluoride (UF4)
enriched to 33% was dissolved in molten lithium, beryllium, and zirconium fluor-
ides (LiF-BeF2-ZrF4-UF4). Later campaigns used also U-233 in the fuel salt. The
graphite 5 moderated MSBR was also a single-fluid design, employing (in the ref-
erence case) LiF-BeF2-ThF4-UF4 as fuel salt with U-233 or U-235 enriched to
around 72% (Engel et al., 1978). Chloride fuel salts have also been proposed, but
lack operational experience to draw upon.
10.5.2
Nonproliferation aspects of MSRs
There are several nonproliferation aspects that are often brought forward in the dis-
cussions of MSR concepts. This section will discuss some of these advantages and
disadvantages.
A selection of advantages of the MSR concept with respect to nonproliferation are:
G
No need for enrichment facilities during routine operation (in the case of the breeder fuel
cycle);
G
A smaller fissile inventory in the core;
G
A strong gamma radiation, which makes the fuel material more unattractive for prolifera-
tors; and
G
A collocated reprocessing, which reduces the transportation of SNM offsite.
MSRs utilizing the thorium fuel cycle are designed to make use of actinide
recycling and a closed Th/U fuel cycle, thereby removing the need for uranium
272
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

enrichment facilities, which are sensitive from a nonproliferation point of view.
Note that this is true for the equilibrium fuel cycle only. During the start-up phase
of a MSR fuel cycle, fissile material must be added externally.
The fissile inventory in an MSR core can be smaller than that of an LWR.
Because the fissile isotopes in an MSR are not contained in conventional fuel rods
with limitations on the total power density, the power density can be increased,
which in turn implies a smaller fissile amount per unit power produced.
In addition, the online removal of xenon eliminates the need for reactivity excess
early in the fuel cycle in order to compensate for the reactivity decrease with
increased burnup. Furthermore, the continuous removal of neutron-absorbing fission
products has the consequence that the loading of fissile material is lower in an
MSR than an LWR. Given the strong gamma radiation, the MSR fuel needs to be
handled in a hot cell, which facilitates the application of C/S (containment and sur-
veillance). (GIF, 2011).
Operational efficiency would require the collocation of the reactor(s) with the
reprocessing facilities, unlike in the LWR fuel cycle where standalone reprocessing
facilities can receive used fuel shipped from multiple states. Transportation
of nuclear materials is typically considered a vulnerability and of great interest to
safeguards and security.
Finally, it can be pointed out that thorium-fueled MSRs produce small amounts
of plutonium compared to uranium-fueled reactors, but on the other hand they pro-
duce large amounts of U-233, which is an excellent weapons material, as discussed
in Section 10.3. Fast (nonmoderated) MSRs also allow for improved burning of plu-
tonium and other transuranic wastes. This is an advantage for all fast reactor fuel
cycles when compared with the LWR fuel cycle, which typically generates a net
production of plutonium. The burning of transuranic waste, such as plutonium,
could reduce the future risks with so-called plutonium mines associated with
geological repositories (Grape et al., 2014). However, a quantitative comparison
between the plutonium-burning capabilities of different fast reactor concepts is
beyond the scope of this chapter.
Identified disadvantages of the MSR with regards to nonproliferation are:
G
A fuel inventory residing outside the core, which increases the total fissile inventory;
G
The use of liquid fuel, as opposed to fuel assemblies, which makes it more difficult to
account for all material;
G
An online reprocessing, which makes the fuel material more accessible and hence easier
to manipulate;
G
An online reprocessing with fission product removal, which lowers the proliferation
barrier;
G
The produced U-233 is of weapons quality and equivalent to plutonium.
Due to the smaller fissile inventory inside the core, some fuel needs to reside
outside the MSR core. This increases the fissile inventory, thus compensating for
the lower fissile inventory inside the core (GIF, 2011). The use of liquid fuel
instead of fuel rods in fuel assemblies also removes the possibility for item counting
and ID-verification. With liquid fuels, the concepts of burnup and irradiation cycles
273
Nonproliferation and safeguards aspects of the MSR fuel cycle

are meaningless, which in practice means that it is not possible to track or verify a
“specific fuel item,” as is done today for LWRs. This makes inventory taking and
material accountancy more difficult since materials change form and composition
and are distributed over several locations (pipes, tanks, etc.). Furthermore, the liq-
uid fuel allows for a high accessibility of the nuclear material in the salt because of
the
online
reprocessing/refueling
mechanism
(Vanderhaegen
and
Janssens-
Maenhout, 2010). This could mean that it becomes challenging to detect low-
quantity diversions, which in total amount to one or several significant quantities.
Also, in liquid fuels, gaseous fission products come off continuously with a puri-
fication process such as liquid extraction, which is much easier for an MSR than
for solid fuel, since the dissolution and fuel refabrication steps are avoided
(MacPherson, 1985). However, the process of removing fission products further
lowers the radiation barrier of the fuel and hence makes it less difficult to handle.
The removal of fission products from the fuel also makes these more easily accessi-
ble for the construction of a radiological dispersive device (“dirty bomb”).
10.6
Means of improving MSR fuel cycle
proliferation resistance
Nonproliferation aspects of the MSR often concern U-232 contamination and the
presence of weapons-quality U-233. To increase the proliferation resistance, it is
often advantageous to have materials that are difficult to handle. At the same time,
such materials are also difficult to handle for civil operators and will likely increase
the costs of the electricity production.
In this section we elaborate on these isotopes and also on the reprocessing
associated with the operation of MSRs.
10.6.1
Denaturation
In the case that U-232 and its intense gamma radiation is not considered sufficient
to deter proliferators, it has been suggested that the uranium could be denatured
with U-238 (Engel et al., 1980; Gat and Engel, 2000). This does however not solve
all problems. Primarily, the issues with protactinium separation and subsequent
U-233 production still remain. In addition, denaturing with U-238 also introduces
plutonium to the used fuel.
Denaturing MSR fuel with fertile U-238, leaving the uranium unfit for weapons
use, was early on concluded inferior to the pure thorium fuel cycle. The use of
U-238 leads to a poorer performance, increased plutonium production, as well as
production of other transuranic elements that need to be recovered during proces-
sing for fission products (Rosenthal et al.,1969). The proposed denatured molten
salt reactor (DMSR) has a lower concentration of fissile uranium, but as a conse-
quence it is also associated with larger long-lived transuranic inventory and lower
breeding ratio (Engel et al., 1980). This in turn lowers the economic interest to
274
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

employ this type of reactor. In order to maximize the breeding ratio, protactinium
must be removed quickly, which in turn results in a pure Pa-233 stream which decays
to a pure U-233 stream unless this stream is denatured by other uranium isotopes.
In order to avoid the U-233 problem altogether, MSRs can also be operated with
uranium fuel enriched to just below 20% (Gat and Engel, 2000). There have also
been proposals for nonbreeding MSRs without any fuel reprocessing (Alexander
et al., 1965). The molten salt converter reactor (MSCR) converts, but does not
breed, fuel unless chemical processing equipment is added. A study at ORNL has
shown that such a reactor, using thorium and 20% enriched uranium, could be oper-
ated for 30 years with only a gas purge system removing gases that naturally come
off and with no fuel reprocessing. However, there is a need to periodically add
more 20% enriched uranium (MacPherson, 1985).
In Chapter 18, Integral molten salt reactor, a nonbreeding MSR design, the
IMSR, operating with low-enriched uranium is also described. This reactor design
does not include any type of reprocessing and the nonproliferation weaknesses
related to reprocessing are therefore greatly reduced. However, all such options
involving enriched uranium imply the continued use of uranium enrichment
facilities, which are one of the most sensitive parts of the LWR fuel cycle from a
nonproliferation perspective.
10.6.2
Physical protection
It has been suggested that a way to remedy the shortcoming of the MSR with
respect to nonproliferation could be to integrate physical protection with nuclear
safeguards. According to the IAEA Convention on physical protection of nuclear
material, this includes measures to protect the nuclear material (or the containers
and facilities in which they are stored) against unlawful taking and use (IAEA,
1979). This could be part of a solution to a problem where the nonproliferation
threat is a nonstate actor (Uhlir, 2014).
10.6.3
Options for MSR fuel salt reprocessing
The MSR concept with online refueling relies on (continuous) separation of waste
products and fuel material. The actual details of the reprocessing are difficult to
specify once and for all because different MSR concepts foresee a varying degree
of reprocessing. Depending on the implementation of the reprocessing, the degree
of proliferation resistance varies. Suggested fuel reprocessing for MSRs vary from:
1. Removal of only gases and volatiles (as foreseen for the MSRE), to
2. A 10-day reprocessing cycle for the MSBR, and
3. Even shorter processing periods for complete online reprocessing.
1. Reprocessing in MSRE (Haubenreich and Engel, 1970): Reprocessing for the purpose of
removing oxide contamination from the salt, and to recover the uranium from the salt at
the end of the experiment. Reprocessing after shutdown for the MSRE was foreseen to
275
Nonproliferation and safeguards aspects of the MSR fuel cycle

consist of on-site separation of uranium from the fuel salt via a fluoride volatility process,
with subsequent substitution of U-233.
2. Reprocessing in MSBR (McNeese et al., 1974): The reprocessing of MSBR builds on
three steps where direct online reprocessing takes place with separation of U and Pa in
areas outside the reactor. There are three main steps: the first is the separation of ura-
nium from the salt via a fluorination process, the second is the removal of protactin-
ium, fission products and rare-earth metals, and lastly the hydro-reduction of UF6 to
UF4. This keeps the Pa-231 concentration in the fuel salt low, and hence reduces also
the U-232 levels.
3. Simplified schematic molten salt processing (Gat and Dodds, 1993): In the first step noble
gases, other gases, and volatiles are removed (this step is the same for all MSRs in order
to avoid unstable operation). In the second step, the fluoride volatility process, uranium
hexafluoride is quantitatively removed, reduced to tetrafluoride, and then returned to the
reactor with the entire inventory being processed in 3 days. The salt containing the fission
products, the U-233 precursor protactinium and possibly other fissile isotopes, then con-
tinues to the third stage where they are separated and the salt (free of fission products) is
returned to the reactor. Protactinium and any plutonium that may be present due to either
breeding or because it was used as initial fissile material, is removed first. Plutonium will
then be returned to the core while protactinium may be held up to convert to uranium
prior to return to the core. If actinides are present or other long-lived elements are present,
they may be separated out and fed back to the reactor for transmutation. Note: As the
MSRE switched from uranium-235 fuel to uranium-233 fuel, the entire inventory (218 kg
uranium) was processed in 4 days by the fluoride volatility process (MacPherson, 1985).
4. Reprocessing in MSFR (GIF, 2011): The purpose of the reprocessing unit is to separate
lanthanides (elements with atomic numbers between 57 and 71). First, however, uranium,
minor actinides (neptunium, plutonium, americium, and curium) and protactinium are
removed from the fuel salt and sent back to the core using a fluorination process and an
extraction loop. A modification of the extraction loop could lead to Pa-233 recovery,
which decays into U-233. However, this uranium would still contain other uranium iso-
topes, and it would be mixed with minor actinides. This points to the importance of accu-
rate salt composition monitoring, which is necessary for both operational and safeguards
purposes.
Frequent reprocessing may be argued to enhance safety, but it leads at the same
time to more manipulations and accessibility of the fuel. Since the reprocessing for
future commercial MSRs is not well determined at this stage, neither are the future
waste streams that need to be handled.
10.7
Summary and conclusion
From a nonproliferation point of view, there are advantages and disadvantages with
the MSR concept. Any new reactor concept and fuel cycle always poses a challenge
for nuclear safeguards to develop and implement an effective and efficient
approach. It is not only the reactor that is subject to nuclear safeguards, but its
entire associated fuel cycle. For this reason it is crucial to assess strengths as well
as weaknesses early on in the process, preferably at the design stage, in order to
facilitate the licensing procedure.
276
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

The MSR concept poses challenges to the existing nuclear safeguards system, as
it contains many features that are not present in the standard light-water reactor fuel
cycle, for which most of the currently implemented nuclear safeguards activities
were designed. The use of liquid fuels instead of fuel assemblies, online refueling
of fissile material instead of well-specified irradiation cycles, and fuel reprocessing
will pose challenges to the safeguards system. The level of reprocessing for future
commercial MSRs is not determined at this stage, and neither are the anticipated
waste streams that need to be handled. How a safeguards system for a future MSR
would be designed can therefore not be answered today. One can however, at a
minimum, expect the safeguards to monitor in detail the material balance of U, Pu,
and other actinides (Johnson and Lockwood, 2011).
In conclusion, comparing the MSR fuel cycle with that of today’s commercial
reactors, sensitive parts can be identified. Even if the MSR fuel cycle differs con-
siderably from today’s fuel cycles, many steps in the MSR fuel cycle have similar
counterparts, e.g., the reprocessing of spent LWR fuel as well as the operation of
CANDU reactors. For these systems, satisfactory safeguards implementations have
been arranged.
The level of proliferation resistance that can be achieved depends on what prolif-
eration threat one considers and what the implemented fuel cycle looks like. If the
threat is a nonstate organization, such as a terrorist group, the MSR fuel cycle can
potentially be designed to be very unattractive for theft and diversion. However, if
one considers the threat to be the host state, it could be rather straightforward to
modify the fuel cycle to produce materials with very high weapons quality. To pre-
vent a host state from covertly diverting such material, options are for inspecting
authorities to have a permanent presence at the reactor site, to use remote and
unattended monitoring, or to have a very high inspection frequency.

Development of molten salt reactor at ORNL
In this section, the development history of the molten salt reactor (MSR) at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is described. The starting point of MSR at
ORNL and their various designs including the final one are explained sequentially.
11.1.1
Liquid fuel reactor, from water to molten salt
At the end of World War II, after ORNL had provided atomic bomb technology,
they started the discussion on future nuclear plants. Its history is described in the
autobiography of Alvin Weinberg, who was a director of ORNL for 18 years from
1955 until 1973 and a development leader of MSR (Weinberg, 1994).
They discussed many ideas at “the New Pile Committee,” which was composed of
Enrico Fermi, Eugene Wigner (both Novel prize winners), Leo Szilard (coinventor
of the reactor with Fermi), and many other scientists, such as Alvin Weinberg. One
of the ideas was a fast breeder reactor (FBR) utilizing plutonium generation from
238U by Fermi and Szilard, and another was a thermal breeder reactor utilizing 233U
generation from thorium by Wigner. Especially, Wigner provided a prospect that the
reactor should be a “chemical engineering device” using liquid fuel because of its
simplicity, and not a “mechanical engineering device” using solid fuel (Weinberg,
1997). Wigner and Weinberg had proposed a liquid fuel reactor in 1945, where aque-
ous heavy water is circulating with 233U-Th fuel (Wigner et al., 1945).
282
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

It is not well known that Alvin Weinberg was an inventor of the light-water
reactor (LWR), but actually he submitted a paper on the LWR concept in 1946
(Weinberg, 1946), and later he issued several patent applications. Soon after, this
concept was applied to nuclear submarines, and later to power-generating plants
worldwide as pressurized water reactors (PWR).
Although Weinberg was an inventor of the LWR, he recognized the dangers of
the LWR. Actually, he wrote a huge textbook on reactor theory in 1958 (Weinberg
and Wigner, 1958), and he commented as follows: “When a fuel element is over-
heated (due to loss of cooling), it fails and the entire system is contaminated by
radioactivity, and then repair becomes extremely difficult.” This is exactly what
happened at the Fukushima accident in 2011, where we were forced to see his
prophecy become real 50 years later.
After Wigner left ORNL, Weinberg realized this concept as the Homogeneous
Reactor Experiment (HRE) by using light water instead of heavy water, and it gen-
erated 150 KW electricity in 1953 (Rosenthal, 2009; Lane, 1958). As is described
later, the most unique feature of the MSR is the circulating liquid fuel concept, and
in this HRE development stage, ORNL established this concept, although it utilized
water and not molten salt. The concept of the HRE and its core are shown in
Figs. 11.1 and 11.2.
The principal advantages of aqueous fuel systems were considered as: (1) high
power density; (2) high burnup fuel; (3) continuous fissile recovery; (4) simple fuel
preparation and reprocessing; (5) continuous addition/removal of fuel; (6) high neu-
tron economy; (7) simple control system; and (8) wide range of core size.
On the other hand, disadvantages of the aqueous fuel system would be:
(1) corrosion/erosion of equipment; (2) radiation-induced corrosion; (3) external
circulation of fuel solution; (4) nuclear safety; (5) limited uranium concentration;
(6) limited operating temperature; and (7) explosive decomposition product (Lane,
1958).
In parallel with the HRE development, ORNL was investigating a nuclear appli-
cation to aircraft jet engines, which was also a request by the US Air Force in
1948. At that time, an Intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) was not developed,
and a long-time flying bomber aircraft was considered as necessary. Since they
needed as high as 870C temperature for jet engines, water could not be adopted as
the coolant.
At first, R. Briant and his team studied a reactor concept using liquid sodium as
coolant with solid fuel rods and moderator made of beryllium oxide, which had
been proposed by General Electric for nuclear submarines. However, they consid-
ered that solid fuel rods would not retain their integrity at such severe heat condi-
tion, and abandoned this concept (Weinberg, 1994).
They soon reached a design concept of liquid fuel reactor using molten salt
instead of water and solid fuel, because molten salt is chemically stable and inert,
and especially it can be used at very low pressure owing to its very high boiling
temperature. Since salt is a chemical compound of acid and alkali, there are thou-
sands of molten salts. (In chemistry, molten salt is defined as an ionic liquid nor-
mally at high-temperature. Therefore, any compounds, which become positive ion
283
Liquid fuel, thermal neutron spectrum reactors

and negative ion at melted condition, can be defined as molten salt. Actually,
ORNL investigated sodium hydroxide (NaOH), which is a strong alkali, as a candi-
date for fuel salt (Weinberg, 1994). (One more remark in chemistry is melting and
dissolving is different. For example, table salt (NaCl) becomes molten salt by heat-
ing without water. Dissolving NaCl is just putting it in water. That is, molten salt
does not contain water, and it brings unique features.) They soon chose molten fluo-
ride, owing to the suggestion by R. Briant and other chemists (Weinberg, 1994;
Briant and Weinberg, 1957). After that, they found a nickel-based alloy that is
corrosion-resistant in molten fluoride, which was later named Hastelloy N.
The MSR development history is well described in the summary paper by
M. Rosenthal, who was a deputy director of ORNL in the 1970s (Rosenthal et al.,
1970), besides Weinberg’s biography (Weinberg, 1994), and H. MacPherson’s
paper (MacPherson, 1985).

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

The first MSR for aircraft engines, which was named the Aircraft Reactor
Experiment (ARE), achieved criticality in 1954. Here, “criticality” means that the
ARE attained continuous fission reactions. The ARE applied molten fuel salt of
NaF-ZrF4-UF4 (53-41-6 in mol%), which was circulating within fuel tubes, as is
shown in Fig. 11.3, and adopted a BeO (beryllium oxide) moderator as is shown in
Fig. 11.4. The ARE achieved maximum temperature of 880C and 2.5 MW thermal
output during its 9 days’ operation. Although the ARE never flew on an aircraft, it
showed the MSR’s capability to provide high heat to aircraft jet engines (Bettis
et al., 1957; MacPherson, 1958).
As is shown in Fig. 11.3, the heat of fuel salt is cooled by helium gas at the heat
exchangers (HXs). Meanwhile, the heat at BeO moderator is cooled by the molten
sodium, and all systems including fuel tubes are made of Inconel. A somewhat
strange design of fuel tubes has an interesting background. (The fuel tube of the
ARE looks strange, like a crawling snake. Bettis explains its background in his
paper (Bettis et al., 1957). The BeO moderator blocks have been already manufac-
tured for the solid fuel (UO2 in a tube) using molten sodium (Na) as a coolant. That
is, a solid-fuel-pin, BeO-moderated, sodium-cooled reactor had been considered at
first. But, this reactor concept was abandoned, and an alternative design of fuel
tubes containing stagnant molten salt was considered. But again, this concept was
abandoned, and finally, a circulating molten salt fuel tube design was adopted.)

Besides its high heat capability, the ARE provided two other important achieve-
ments for the MSR. One was that it showed a sufficiently negative reactivity coeffi-
cient with temperature, and another was that most of the xenon (Xe) gas was
removed from the molten salt. Since Xe is a neutron-absorbing material generated
by nuclear fissions, this result showed an important advantage of the MSR.
In parallel with the ARE development, another MSR for aircraft engines was
developed, which was named the Pratt and Whitney Aircraft Reactor (PWAR-1)
(Scott et al., 1958). The PWAR-1 was a reflector-moderated reactor, and its core
was composed of fuel salt within a Hastelloy X core shell surrounded by a
Figure 11.3 Flow diagram of ARE (Bettis et al., 1957).

cylindrical beryllium reflector as the moderator, as is shown in Figs. 11.5 and 11.6.
Fuel salt is a ternary salt of NaF-ZrF4-235UF 4. The PWAR-1 was essentially a
zero-power reactor, and its operating temperature was maintained at 677C by
external heaters. Therefore, its purpose was to acquire reactor physics data for the
MSR concept, and a criticality experiment was performed in 1957.

287
Liquid fuel, thermal neutron spectrum reactors

Since this book is focusing on MSRs, nonMSRs for jet engines, such as Heat
Transfer Reactor Experiments (HTRE) in the 1950s designed by General Electric,
are not described here. The history of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion (ANP) pro-
gram can be found elsewhere.
At the same time as the PWAR-1 construction, a successive program called the
Aircraft Reactor Test (ART) was started in 1955 at ORNL (Cottrell et al., 1955;
Fraas et al., 1956). The ART was designed to provide 60 MWt heat, which would be
Figure 11.6 PWAR-1 core shell (Scott et al., 1958).
288
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

enough for actual aircraft engines. The ART applies the BeO reflector-moderated
design similar to the PWAR-1, in order to protect the aircraft crew from its radiation,
as shown in Fig. 11.7. One more innovative point is that it adopts in-vessel molten
salt pumps and HXs, and HX is cooled by the molten NaK. Although almost all other
MSR designs in ORNL adopted out-vessel pumps and HX, the ART could accommo-
date pumps and HX owing to its small reactor size. The ART was principally design

work, and was not actually constructed. However, some mockups and components
were manufactured, as shown in Fig. 11.8. And some building modifications were
made which were later adopted and remodified for the MSRE.
After the success of the ARE, the PWAR-1, and the ART, design of an experi-
mental MSR for land-based power plants was started in 1960, and it was constructed
as the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE), as is shown in Figs. 11.9 and 11.10.
The MSRE showed extremely successful operation from 196569 at ORNL. Its suc-
cess is summarized in a 1970 paper (Haubenreich and Engel, 1970). The MSRE had
a single region core with a graphite moderator as shown in Fig. 11.8, and an
Hastelloy N vessel and pipes. They achieved 8 MW thermal output with molten fuel
salt of 7LiF-BeF2-ZrF4-UF4 or 7LiF-BeF2-ZrF4-PuF3 at 650C. Here, natural lithium
(Li) was enriched to 7Li, in order to reduce neutron absorption by 6Li.
The reason why the MSRE did not contain thorium fluoride (ThF4) is explained
as follows (Haubenreich and Engel, 1970). Since a commercial-type MSR was
expected to be a two-fluid breeder design, that is a fuel region containing fissile
material and a surrounding or interlaced blanket region containing thorium, they
designed the MSRE in order to simulate this fissile fuel salt region. The history or
reason for selecting a two-fluid design is described in Section 11.1.4.
As is shown in Fig. 11.11, fuel salt is circulated by the molten salt pump, and its
heat is removed to the secondary salt through the HX. And finally, its heat is
released to the air, using radiators.
Figure 11.8 ART mockup (Fraas et al., 1956).
290

The purpose of the MSRE was to demonstrate key features of a molten salt
power reactor, although a steam-generator (SG) and a turbine/generator were not
provided. They achieved many unique features, such as stability of fuel salt, integ-
rity for Hastelloy N and graphite, and removing capability of gaseous radioactive
fission product (FP) such as xenon and krypton from fuel salt. One more unique

achievement was operation by 233U. Fig. 11.12 shows a snapshot of the day of its
first operation by 233U at the MSRE control room.
11.1.2
Selection of thermal neutron spectrum
From the very beginning of reactor development, it was known that a fission reac-
tion is easier to achieve with thermal neutrons than fast neutrons. As is shown in
Fig. 11.13, fission cross-sections of 233U/235U/239Pu are almost 100 times higher for
thermal neutrons. This fact means that a thermal spectrum reactor requires less fis-
sile material, which was not abundant at that time.
Since fission neutrons are fast neutrons, the moderator is required in order to
slow down these fast neutrons. Fortunately, there are good moderator materials,
such as water (either light water or heavy water), graphite, and beryllium, which
are naturally abundant, except heavy water.

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

Therefore, it was natural that they adopted a thermal spectrum reactor as a faster
and easier one in order to start the nuclear power plant age.
As is described at first, the development of nuclear power plants was based on
the assumption in the late 1940s that uranium was scarce on the globe and breeding
was one of the highest-priority targets. Actually, this was one of the strong
Figure 11.12 MSRE began operation with 233U in 1968. (Left to right: A. Weinberg

prize winner who discovered 233U], and J. Engel.) (Weinberg, 1994; Rosenthal, 2009).

incentives to propose the thorium cycle, because thorium is 34 times more abun-
dant than uranium.
Here, a certain reactor physics parameter is explained, which is called the repro-
duction factor “η.” This parameter η is defined as the number of neutrons produced
per neutron absorbed in the fissile nuclide. Then, breeding is possible only if η is
larger than 2.0. As is shown in Fig. 11.14, when 233U causes a fission, it produces
two or more neutrons. One neutron is required for the continuous chain reaction.
Another neutron can be absorbed by the fertile nuclide such as 232Th, which decays
to 233U. (Actual decay chains for both Th cycle and U/Pu cycle are shown in
Section 11.1.4.) Therefore, if η is larger than 2.0, then more 233U is produced than
consumed 233U, that is, breeding becomes possible. But, exactly speaking, some
neutrons are absorbed by core internal materials, and also lost to the outside of the
reactor. Therefore, η must be a little bit larger than 2.0 for actual breeding.
Energy dependence of η for 233U/235U/239Pu is shown in Fig. 11.15. It is shown
that in general η is higher at a fast neutron energy, and especially η of 239Pu is the
highest of all. One more finding in this figure is that η of 233U is as high for thermal
neutrons as fast neutrons. And this suggests that breeding is possible for 233U-Th
MSR with thermal neutron spectrum.
11.1.3
Molten salt fast-spectrum reactor (MSFR)
The molten salt fast-spectrum reactor (MSFR) is described in Chapter 12, Fast spec-
trum, liquid fueled reactors but a brief summary of the MSFR study in ORNL is
given here (Bulmer et al., 1956; Alexander, 1963).
In the mid-1950s, a fast-spectrum breeding MSR producing 700 MW of heat was
designed, utilizing plutonium as the fissile fuel in a mixture of chloride salt, that is
MgCl2-NaCl-[239PuCl3-238UCl3] (33-50-17 in mol%) circulating the core region. The
reason for selection of chloride is because it has considerably less moderating power
than fluoride, and then a higher breeding performance would be achieved.
One more feature in this MSFR is that chlorine (Cl) is enriched to nearly pure
37Cl. There are two nuclides in natural chlorine, that is 35Cl (76%) and 37Cl (24%).
Figure 11.14 Breeding scheme for 233U/Th cycle.
294
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

Since 35Cl has a 10 times larger absorption cross-section than 37Cl, if natural chlo-
rine is used, breeding performance becomes worse. Of course, if breeding perfor-
mance for Pu-fueled MSFR is high enough, this might be acceptable. But, besides
this issue, ORNL people had a concern that the generated 36Cl has a very long half-
life of 0.3 million years with a high-energy beta-ray emission. In order to avoid a
future radioactive waste issue, they proposed to use enriched 37Cl, instead of natural
chlorine. Regardless of chlorine enrichment, a small amount of residual 35Cl and a
very small cross-section for (n,2n) reaction in 37Cl would generate 36Cl (Okumura,
2013). (The (n,γ) cross-section of 35Cl is 10.4 mb (milli-barn), and 5.9 mb for (n,p)
reaction in a typical FBR core. On the other hand, (n,γ) cross-section of 37Cl is
1.7 mb, and thus, chlorine enrichment to
37Cl improves neutron economy. Of
course, 100% enrichment is impossible, and residual 35Cl generates radioactive 36Cl
by neutron capture reaction. Meanwhile, 37Cl has a very small cross-section of
0.01 mb for (n,2n) reaction, and some radioactive 36Cl would be generated, based
on ORIGEN2 FBR library. But, recent nuclear libraries (http://www.oecd-nea.org/
janis/) do not provide cross-section of (n,2n) reaction in 37Cl, and this path must be
confirmed in the future.)
In this MSFR concept, the fertile material in a blanket is UO2 powder in sodium
paste, as is shown in Fig. 11.16. That is, this concept was intended to apply a U-Pu
cycle, the same as FBR. After this study, there were some other studies on MSFR,
Figure 11.15 Reproduction factor (η) for 233U/235U/239Pu (Duderstadt and Hamilton, 1967).
Reproduction factor (η) is defined as follows; η 5 (νσf)/σa. Therefore, η can be calculated
using open data of cross-sections, for example; http://www.oecd-nea.org/janis/.
295
Liquid fuel, thermal neutron spectrum reactors

but ORNL’s main focus was thermal-spectrum MSR. More recently, several fast-
spectrum MSR concepts are being proposed for actinide burners using fluoride salt
as a part of the Generation-IV program (Serp et al., 2014), and they are described
in Chapter 12, Fast spectrum, liquid fueled reactors.
11.1.4
Two-fluid MSR
As was explained at first, breeding was one of the highest-priority goals for the
MSR, and they proposed a two-fluid design at the end of the 1950s (Alexander
et al., 1959). Although MSFR could achieve higher breeding performance, ORNL’s
main focus was thermal-spectrum MSR, which could be realized earlier.
As is shown in Fig. 11.17, its core region contains fissile material such as 233U
for power generation. Meanwhile, a surrounding blanket region contains thorium,
which is converted to fissile 233U by neutron absorption. This concept is similar to
an FBR concept, but the MSR is a liquid fuel reactor, and core region salt and blan-
ket region salt are each circulated by molten salt pumps.
There were two other reasons to adopt a two-fluid concept for the MSR:
1. The online reprocessing was also proposed in order to increase breeding capability for the
MSR. But, at that time, it was considered that removing FP from thorium-containing salt
would be difficult. Therefore, it was convenient that a core region did not contain
thorium.
2. Thorium is converted to 233U through protactinium (Pa) by the following neutron absorp-
tion reaction:
232Th(n,γ) !233Th(decay with 22.3 minutes half-life) !233Pa(decay with 27.0 day
half-life) !233U.
Figure 11.16 Molten salt fast reactor (MSFR) concept (Bulmer et al., 1956).
296
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

Since the decay of 233Th is rapid, the number Npa of 233Pa atoms varies approxi-
mately as:
dNpa=dt  Nth σth φ  Npa σpa φ  λpa Npa
where σth and σpa are the neutron absorption cross-sections in thorium and protac-
tinium, resectively, φ is the neutron flux, and λpa is the protactinium decay con-
stant. If 233Pa absorbs a neutron before it decays to 233U, breeding performance
becomes worse.
In a two-fluid design as shown in Fig. 11.17, its blanket is large and the neutron
flux there is low. Thus, neutron absorption to 233Pa can be minimized, and rapid
processing to remove Pa and allow it to decay to 233U is not required (LeBlanc,
2010).
If we breed 239Pu from 238U, the reaction chain is:
238U(n,γ)!239U(decay with 23.4 minutes half-life) !239Np(decay with 2.36 day half-
life) !239Pu.
Since the half-life of 239Np is short, it can be assumed that 238U goes to 239Pu
directly, in contrast to the slow decay of 233Pa to 233U.
The breeding ratio (BR) is the number of fissile atoms generated per fissile atom
consumed.
The doubling time, t2, is the time required to produce enough new fissile mate-
rial to start another reactor, given by
t2 5 NoW=PðBR 2 1Þ
Figure 11.17 Two-fluid MSR concept (Alexander et al., 1959).
297

where No is the initial numer of fissile atoms, W is the energy released per fission
(3.2 3 10211 J), and P is the reactor thermal power (Watts). For example, if No 5
2.6 3 1027 atoms (1000 kg fissile material), BR51.2, and P 5 1 GWth, then t2 5
4.2 3 108 seconds 5 13 years.
For one case the BR was evaluated as 1.07 with Pa removal (online processing),
and BR without Pa removal was 1.05 (Briggs, 1967). For this case the doubling
time was 17 years with Pa removal and 26 years without Pa removal. This differ-
ence was important for the designers at that time, because their target was to
achieve better performance than that of the FBR.
As is explained in Fig. 11.14, at least 50% of the neutrons must be leaked from
the core region and absorbed in the blanket region, in order to achieve breeding for
a two-fluid MSR.
In the FBR a mean free path (average flight length) of a fast neutron is long,
because it has a high speed, and the absorption cross-section is small. The concen-
tration of fissile material is high in the core region, and neutrons cannot be fully
absorbed by the fertile material there, so a fertile blanket is desirable.
In contrast to the FBR, the MSR core neutrons have shorter mean free paths,
because it is a thermal neutron spectrum reactor with high absorption cross-
sections. Therefore, in order to achieve high leakage ($50%) of neutrons from the
core, its size must be small enough. For example, in a graphite-moderated MSR,
50% leakage will be expected only if the radius of the core sphere is smaller than
60 cm. (Based on the one-group reactor theory, leakage fraction (LF) is defined as
1/(1 1 M2B2). Here, migration length (M, which is an index similar to a mean free
path) is assumed as 20 cm in a graphite-moderated core, and B2 is defined as (π/R)2
for sphere geometry. If R 5 60 cm, then LF 5 0.5, that is, 50% leakage will be
expected from core region to blanket region.) This size is too small for a large
power reactor, and therefore, a spherical design concept shown in Fig. 11.17 is
impractical for a large power reactor with a thermal spectrum.
Based on this consideration, ORNL proposed an alternative two-fluid MSR in
the late 1960s, which applied an interlaced blanket concept. This is a very unique
concept, as is shown in Fig. 11.18 (Robertson, 1970). Since the mean free path of
neutrons in thermal spectrum MSR is small, it is necessary to design the blanket
region as close as possible to the core region. This interlaced blanket concept would
use graphite tubes, which are used to circulate fuel salt, within the blanket salt tank.
The reason why they selected graphite tubes is explained as follows. At that
time, the most promising metal for high-temperature use in molten salt was a
nickel-based alloy, and then Hastelloy N was developed in ORNL and used in the
MSRE. But, nickel causes helium embrittlement due to (n, α) reactions at high neu-
tron fluence. That is, Hastelloy N could not be used as fuel tubes, which would suf-
fer high neutron irradiation. Also, nuclides in nickel-based alloy absorb neutrons,
and breeding performance becomes worse. Because of these facts, graphite was
selected for the fuel tubes.
This interlaced design was possible on a drawing, but actual manufacturing,
maintenance, and irradiation integrity of hundreds of graphite tubes were consid-
ered impractical, so this interlaced design was abandoned.

11.1.5
MSBR, large-sized single-fluid molten salt breeder reactor
Based on the above 20 years’ study, ORNL finally switched from two-fluid MSR to
single-fluid MSR, and proposed a single-fluid design for a large-sized power plant
as the molten salt breeder reactor (MSBR), and issued a conceptual design report in
1971 (Robertson, 1971), although the MSBR was not constructed.
As was explained above, there were two assumptions leading to a two-fluid
MSR, especially for a graphite-moderated MSR. (1) Online reprocessing is imprac-
tical with thorium fluoride, so a core region should not contain thorium.
(2) Neutron leakage from a core region must be collected by blanket. But, these
assumptions were changed as follows:
1. Chemical processing technology was greatly improved, which is a liquidliquid reductive
extraction process for removing Pa and U from molten fluoride salts. This technique is to
exchange Th and Li dissolved in molten bismuth for the constituents to be removed from
the salt. Thus, a single-fluid MSR becomes feasible with thorium-containing salt; 7LiF-
BeF2-UF4-ThF4. The base binary salt (LiF-BeF2) is called FLiBe.
Online chemical processing recovers U and Pa from the fuel salt and removes FPs, as
is shown in Fig. 11.19 (Rosenthal et al., 1970; Grimes, 1967).
Figure 11.18 Two-fluid MSR with interlaced blanket (LeBlanc, 2010; Robertson, 1970).
299
Liquid fuel, thermal neutron spectrum reactors

2. The core design was greatly improved by allocating a kind of blanket region at the outer
part of the core, both using the same fuel salt, as is shown in Fig. 11.20. In this concept, the
inner core region has a smaller volume fraction (13%) of fuel salt and a larger volume frac-
tion (87%) of graphite moderator, which enhances neutron moderation and increases the
reactivity. Meanwhile the outer region has a larger volume fraction (37%) of fuel salt, and a
smaller volume fraction (63%) of graphite, which enhances more conversion from Th to
233U. Although lower neutron moderation decreases reactivity in the periphery, it reduces
neutron leakage from the core and improves breeding performance (Rosenthal et al., 1970).
Then, this concept is called a single-fluid two-region MSBR, or just the MSBR hereafter.
The effect of changing fuel salt volume fraction is as follows. Using the same
nuclear design code as explained in the next Section 11.2, and assuming the unit
cell model, K-infinity is calculated for different radii of fuel salt path, by the pres-
ent authors. The core 13% fuel salt volume fraction corresponds to 3.5 cm radius,
and 37% fraction to 6.0 cm radius. Fig. 11.21 shows that higher fuel salt volume
fraction decreases K-infinity or reactivity.
The effect of changing fuel salt volume fraction on neutron spectrum is shown
in Fig. 11.22. The inner core of the MSBR has a high peak at thermal neutron
energy, and the outer core has a small peak there. As is explained in Section 11.2,
MSR-FUJI has a 36% fuel salt volume fraction in average, and its neutron spectrum
is close to the outer core of the MSBR.
The MSBR was designed to produce a large electric output of 1000 MWe, and
its major design parameters are shown in Table 11.1.
The MSBR flow diagram is shown in Fig. 11.23, although a freeze valve and a
drain tank are not shown. The reactor vessel, pipes, and pumps are made of Hastelloy

N. There is a graphite moderator within a reactor vessel. Fuel salt flows upwards
from a primary pump and then goes to HXs to transfer the heat to secondary coolant
salt. The heat of secondary salt is transferred to the steam through a supercritical
steam generator. Although this figure shows only one loop, the actual MSBR design
had four loops. Then, its steam goes to a turbine/generator to produce electricity. Due
to a limitation of irradiation growth, the graphite moderator is replaced every 4 years.
Fuel salt is 7LiF-BeF2-ThF4-UF4, and secondary salt is NaBF4-NaF.
The sectional elevation of the reactor vessel is shown in Fig. 11.24. Its core is
composed of graphite moderator rods and surrounding graphite reflectors. The MSBR
applies a single-fluid design, but its core has two regions as described before.

Liquid fuel, thermal neutron spectrum reactors

Fuel salt enters from the bottom and flows upward within the flow path in graph-
ite rods. The original design of a graphite rod by ORNL is square-shaped, as is
shown in Fig. 11.25. In order to calculate the accurate temperature coefficient, this
unique shape has to be considered. (As is shown in Fig. 11.19, fuel salt flows both
in the center round path and the peripheral rectangular path, which is a groove of
the graphite rod. In order to calculate an accurate Doppler coefficient and a temper-
ature coefficient, this layout has to be considered, because these coefficients depend
strongly on resonance absorption, which occurs mostly at the surface of the fuel
path. This is called a surface effect as Weinberg described in his textbook (p. 683
of Weinberg and Wigner, 1958)).
Radial power distribution is shown in Fig. 11.26, which is a result of the two-
region design.

After the conceptual design for the MSBR at ORNL, another study was headed
by Ebasco Services, Inc. with utilities, and they issued a long report in 1972
(EBASCO Services Inc., 1972). They adopted a hexagonal graphite assembly as a
moderator. Each assembly is composed of multiple graphite slabs, and its horizontal
core layout is shown in Fig. 11.27.
11.1.6
Denatured molten salt reactor (DMSR)
After ORNL issued the MSBR design report, all essential works were terminated,
except the study on denatured molten salt reactor (DMSR) in the late 1970s (Engel
et al., 1980).
In 1977, when President Jimmy Carter started his administration, he issued a
National Energy Program, which deferred the commercial reprocessing of spent
fuels indefinitely, and deferred the Clinch River FBR project indefinitely. This pol-
icy change was based on the nuclear explosion test by India in 1974, where repro-
cessed plutonium from spent fuels was used.
The Program also said that the breeder program would redirect efforts toward
evaluation of alternate breeders, fuels, and advanced converter reactors with an
emphasis on nonproliferation and safety concerns. Since the MSBR was considered
to have proliferation resistance, ORNL investigated the possibility to enhance it
more. Thus, the DMSR study was started.
The DMSR is based on the plant design of the MSBR, but there are several mod-
ifications as follows, in order to achieve a “30 Year Once Through” reactor.
One big difference from MSBR is to start from low-enriched uranium (LEU)
with thorium. Here, LEU means less than 20% 235U enriched uranium. (LEU is
Figure 11.27 Horizontal layout of Ebasco-MSBR (EBASCO Services Inc., 1972).
305
Liquid fuel, thermal neutron spectrum reactors

defined as uranium which contains less than 20% 235U. As for uranium containing
233U (LEU-233), it is proposed to be defined as uranium less than the weighted
average of 20% 235U and/or 12% 233U. See the details in Forsberg (1998).) And,
233U which is generated from thorium is diluted with 238U, that is denatured.
A second difference is to reduce the function of online reprocessing, that is, to
limit its function only to remove gaseous FP and noble metals.
A third difference is to confine all fuel salt within the reactor containment for
the 30-year operation period to allow the accumulation of all other FPs.
Each of these design changes decreases breeding performance, and annual addi-
tion of LEU is required. Thus, DMSR is not a breeder reactor, but a converter
reactor.
A fourth improvement is to allow 30-year usage of a graphite moderator, while
the MSBR was designed to replace the graphite moderator every 4 years. This
improvement is owing to the lower power density and the flattened neutron flux
distribution, as is shown in Fig. 11.28.
Of course, this lower power density needs a larger reactor vessel, which is
almost four times larger volume than the MSBR, and then, the reactor containment
and reactor building (RB) would become larger.
The fuel salt is 7LiF-BeF2-AcF4 (74.0-16.5-9.5 in mol%, Ac 5 U 1 Th), and
1000 MWe DMSR would start from 17 tons of LEU (20% 235U, that is 3.5 tons of
235U) along with 110 tons of thorium. Annual makeup fissile material is LEU, and
uranium always remains in the denatured state.
Its chemical processing system is very much simplified for removal only of
gaseous FPs and noble metals. Therefore, most other FPs stay in fuel salt for the
Figure 11.28 DMSR radial/axial power distribution (Engel et al., 1980).
306

30-year operation period. Also, no fuel reprocessing means no removal and hold up
of 233Pa, which was proposed for the MSBR design. But its penalty is small enough
to achieve satisfactory converter performance, because of its lower neutron flux.
One concern may be the production of plutonium (Pu) from 238U. The total
amount of Pu at the end of operation is 0.7 tons, but its fissile fraction is 45%, and
the rest (55%) is 238Pu, 240Pu, and 242Pu, any of which emits many neutrons by
spontaneous fissions. This result would contribute to proliferation resistance,
because of difficult manufacturing and easy detection of nuclear weapons.
11.1.7
Termination of MSR development at ORNL
Regardless of the above significant achievements, the development plan of the
MSR was canceled in the 1970s. As for the reasons, Alvin Weinberg later described
in his biography (Weinberg, 1994), and also his deputy director H. MacPherson
explained (MacPherson, 1985).
1. The LWR and U-Pu cycle had already started, and the Na-FBR program acquired large
funding and participants.
2. Compared with this trend, the MSR with Th cycle was too late, and participants were lim-
ited to ORNL.
3. Since the MSR was a different concept from a solid fuel reactor, supporting voices were
weak.
4. Besides these points, Weinberg stated that the U-Pu cycle was preferred, because it was
closer to a nuclear weapon.
Regardless of these historic results, Weinberg predicted in his biography that his
proposal would be revived in the future.
11.1.8
Summary
As is described above, the MSR development has been initiated by the prospect of
genius scientists, and has been performed by innovative scientists and engineers at
ORNL. They constructed three experimental MSRs, and one of them (the MSRE)
provided excellent operation experience. After a wide variety of investigations on
different concepts, they finally proposed the 1000 MWe MSBR design as future
power plants.
It is clear that this development was led strongly by Alvin Weinberg. As is
shown in his books, he recognized the danger of LWRs and of the U-Pu cycle.
Therefore, as is explained in the next section, he visited many countries as an evan-
gelist of the MSR. For example, in 1991, he visited Japan to meet E. Nishibori and
K. Furukawa (Fig. 11.29). He also visited Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Meanwhile, he
contributed to building a bell for peace and international friendship at the city park
of Oak Ridge in 1996, as is shown in Fig. 11.30.
We would like to express our respects and appreciation to them, especially to
Weinberg.

Introduction
After MSR development had been terminated at ORNL in the 1970s, several coun-
tries were inspired by their achievement and continued their work. Since the details

for current activities will be described in a separate section of this book, major
activities just after ORNL work are shortly introduced at first.
France investigated the feasibility of a graphite-moderated MSR within CEA
(French Atomic Energy Commission) and an electric utility, starting from the mid-
1970s until 2000 (Vergnes et al., 2000) (As for the early stage, it is based on private
communication with A. Lecocq (ex-CEA scientist)).
In the 1980s, the former Czechoslovakia and Soviet Union jointly developed a
reprocessing technology, which applied molten salt and was named “FREGAT” by
Russian Scientists (Uhlir, 1998; Furukawa et al., 2010). This technology is based
on a fluorination flame reactor technology used in France to produce UF6 gas for
uranium enrichment from uranium oxide.
The United Kingdom investigated MSFR instead of graphite-moderated MSR within
the UK Atomic Energy Authority in the 1970s (UK Atomic Energy Authority, 1974).
China disclosed very recently that it constructed a zero-powered experimental
reactor using unmelted fuel salt at Shanghai as early as 1971 (Xu, 2012).
Kazuo Furukawa and his group in Japan have been investigating graphite-
moderated MSR “FUJI” and related accelerator technology since the 1980s
(Furukawa et al., 2008, 2010; Yoshioka, 2013). FUJI is mostly based on MSBR
designs with some improvements. This section shows their design results, such as
detailed design result of FUJI-U3, brief summary of FUJI-Pu, transmutation capa-
bility of minor actinides (MA), super-FUJI of 1000 MWe, a pilot plant mini-FUJI.
Another achievement on accelerator molten-salt breeder (AMSB) is described in
Chapter 15 (Accelerator Driven Systems).
11.2.2
Concept of FUJI-U3 (using 233U as fissile)
The conceptual design of FUJI was started in the 1980s (Furukawa et al., 1986)
based on the ORNL’s MSBR studies, and its latest design is shown in Mitachi et al.
(2007, 2008).
FUJI is size-flexible from 100 MWe to 1000 MWe. However, a typical value is
100200 MWe, in order to deploy widely around the world. The latest design,
FUJI-U3, is 200 MWe with a thermal output of 450 MWt. This means a thermal
efficiency of about 44% owing to its high exit temperature, compared with the
LWR case of 33%.
A schematic diagram of the MSR-FUJI is shown in Fig. 11.31. A reactor vessel
and pipes are made of Hastelloy N. There is a graphite moderator within a reactor
vessel. Fuel salt flows upwards by primary pumps, and then goes to HXs to transfer
the heat to secondary coolant salt. The heat of secondary salt is transferred to the
steam through a supercritical steam generator, and then to a turbine/generator to
produce electricity. Based on an optimized core design, the graphite moderator does
not require replacement during a reactors’ lifetime of 30 years.
The fuel salt for FUJI-U3 is 7LiF-BeF2-ThF4-UF4 (71.76-16.0-12.0-0.24 mol%).
Although fuel salt is based on 7LiF-BeF2 (FLiBe), secondary salt is selected as
NaBF4-NaF (92-8 mol%), the same as the MSBR design, because of cost perfor-
mance. Properties of FLiBe and NaBF4-NaF are shown in Chapter 7, Materials.
Both salts have good compatibility with Hastelloy N.
309
Liquid fuel, thermal neutron spectrum reactors

A vertical cross-section of the primary system of FUJI is shown in Fig. 11.32. If fuel
salt is overheated, fuel salt goes down to a drain tank, which is located below the reac-
tor, through a freeze valve. Since there is no graphite moderator in a drain tank, there is
no danger of a recriticality accident. Also, in the case of a pipe break, leaked fuel salt is
collected in an emergency drain tank, which is also located below the reactor.
Continuous chemical processing of fuel salt is not performed in FUJI, but radio-
active Xe, Kr, and T (tritium) are continuously removed from the reactor not only
to improve the conversion ratio (CR; ratio of discharged fissile amount to loaded
fissile amount), but also to prevent their release in a pipe break accident.
A bird’s-eye view of FUJI is shown in Fig. 11.33. This reactor design has a three-
level containment safety, as was proposed in the MSBR design (Robertson, 1971). The
first level is a reactor vessel and pipes made of Hastelloy N. The second level is a high-
temperature containment (HTC) composed of three layers, which contains a reactor ves-
sel, pipes, and HXs. The third level is a reactor building (RB) composed of two layers.
11.2.3
Design conditions
The electric power of FUJI-U3 is 200 MWe, and the thermal power is 450 MW(th),
which implies a thermal efficiency of 44.4%. The fuel salt is initially composed of
mixed fluoride of ThF4 (12 mol%), BeF2 (16 mol%), and LiF 1 233UF4 (72 mol%).
Here, Li is enriched lithium corresponding to 7Li (99.995 mol%), and the relative
proportion between LiF and 233UF4 is a variable in this design.
The graphite moderator is used without being replaced for the 30 years of the
reactor lifetime. Since FUJI-U3 is a small reactor, load-following operation is
assumed according to the electric power demand. Assuming 100% power during
Figure 11.31 Schematic diagram of the MSR-FUJI (one loop is shown).
310
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

14 hours of operation in the daytime, 50% power during 8 hours of operation in the
nighttime, and a linear change in between, the average load factor is 81%. Further,
assuming 12 months of operation and 1 month of downtime, the average load factor
amounts to 75%. Therefore, the average load factor in this study is assumed to be
75%. The above-mentioned 30 years operation period is based on the assumption
that the core internals are enclosed in the reactor vessel that is not opened during
the period. If a longer operation period is required, this vessel may be replaced
along with the core internals such as the graphite moderator.
Assuming 30 years operation with a 75% load factor, the irradiation limit of the
graphite moderator equals 4.2 3 1013 cm22 s21 for the fast neutron flux of energy
higher than 52 keV. Furthermore, the irradiation limit of the vessel, which is
made of Hastelloy N (Ni-based alloy with Mo/Cr/Nb/Si), is 1.4 3 1011 cm22 s21
for the fast neutron flux of energy higher than 0.8 MeV, and 7.1 3 1012 cm22 s21
for the thermal neutron flux of energy lower than 1.0 eV. These limits are based on
the MSBR design (Robertson, 1971). These limits are slightly old, and may be
revised due to recent improvements in the manufacturing technology.

Liquid fuel, thermal neutron spectrum reactors

When 232Th captures a neutron, 232Th is transmuted to 233Pa (protactinium-233),
which decays to 233U with 27 days half-life. In the actual burnup calculation, full-
power operation is assumed, but, in the actual FUJI operation, there is an above-
mentioned 1-month shutdown time, and almost half of 233Pa in the core decays to
233U in this down time. Since the reactivity-loss due to Pa is about 0.5% delta-K, it
means that about 0.25% delta-K higher reactivity is added due to this effect, and
this will improve neutron economy a little. However, after the reactor is started
again, the core soon reaches equilibrium condition, and the Pa content reaches the
previous equilibrium value. Therefore, this Pa effect is neglected in the calculation.
11.2.4
Calculation procedure for criticality
The criticality of FUJI-U3 is calculated using the nuclear analysis code SRAC95
(Okumura et al., 1996). At first, a collision probability routine PIJ (Tsuchihashi
et al., 1979) is applied with 107 energy groups for the unit fuel cell model, which is
shown in Fig. 11.34. Nuclear cross-sections of the 107 groups are compressed into
30 groups, which are composed of 24 fast neutron groups and six thermal neutron
groups. Finally, a diffusion calculation by the CITATION (Fowler et al., 1971) rou-
tine is performed using the cross-sections of the above-mentioned 30 groups. In the
two-dimensional RZ (Radial direction and Z-axis)diffusion calculation, the core is
divided into 65 radial regions and 32 axial zones. In these calculations, JENDL-3.2
(Nakagawa et al., 1995) is used as a nuclear data library.

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

In the fuel cell calculation, the temperature of the fuel cell, composed of the fuel
salt and a graphite moderator, is assumed to be 900 K, which is the mean value
between the core inlet and outlet temperatures. With regard to the RZ calculation
for the core, the temperature of the entire core is also assumed to be 900 K. The
effect of the axial temperature distribution has been evaluated in a separate report
(Yamamoto et al., 2004). According to this report, the actual temperature is higher
in the upper part of the core than in the lower part, and this causes a slightly lower
neutron flux at the upper part of the core due to a decrease in reactivity. However,
the influence of the assumption of a constant temperature on the neutron flux is
small, that is, approximately 2%3% difference. Therefore, a constant temperature
is assumed for the entire core in this calculation.
As shown in Fig. 11.34, the FUJI core is composed of graphite moderator and fuel
salt. In this study, hexagonal graphite (p 5 0.19 m) is modeled as a cylindrical ele-
ment (D 5 0.20 m), and the flow hole in the graphite is designed to be cylindrical
(d 5 variable), where this flow hole acts as a passage for the flow of the fuel salt.
The lower part of this figure shows the fuel cell model considered in this calculation.
For the calculation of criticality, the size of the reactor core and the graphite
reflector are varied. The volume fraction of the fuel salt in each region (Fr) is var-
ied by changing the flow hole diameter (5 d) of graphite. With regard to the fuel

salt, the total percentage concentration of (LiF 1 233UF4) is fixed as 72 mol%, while
the 233UF4 concentration is varied in order to achieve criticality.
The eigenvalue calculation is performed using SRAC95, and in this calculation,
the neutron effective multiplication factor (Keff), fuel conversion ratio (CR), tem-
perature coefficient of the reactivity, and neutron flux distribution (φ) are calcu-
lated. The obtained value of the neutron flux distribution is compared with the
irradiation limit, and if it does not meet the design criteria, the above core para-
meters are varied until all design conditions are met.
The calculation procedure discussed above is shown in Fig. 11.35, where both
the criticality calculation (discussed in this section) and the burnup calculation (dis-
cussed in the next section) are described.

11.2.5
Criticality property and main results
Fig. 11.36 shows the quarter portion of the RZ cylindrical core configuration with
dimensions and the volume fractions (Fr) of the fuel salt in each region.
As described in the discussion on design conditions, the fast neutron fluence is
limited in the graphite of the core; hence, it is important to reduce the fast neutron
flux at the center of the core. In this study, the core is designed to have three
regions. This three-region concept is explained as follows.
First of all, let us consider the two-region core. In order to reduce the peak neu-
tron flux, it is necessary to reduce K-infinity (Kinf) in the center region of the core,
and to increase the Kinf at the outer region. But, increasing Kinf at the outer region
causes more neutron leakage, and then, the CR becomes worse. Since our targets
are both to flatten the neutron flux and to achieve high CR, the above two-region
core cannot satisfy these conflicting targets.
Therefore, the third region is introduced at the peripheral of the core, where Kinf
is lowest among the whole core, in order to reduce the neutron leakage from the
peripheral of the core.
In the above concept, changing Kinf is achieved by changing the fuel volume
fraction in the graphite. Fig. 11.37 shows the relation between Kinf and the
graphite/233U (G/U) atom density ratio. In this fuel cell calculation, the concentra-
tion of 233UF4 is fixed at 0.24 mol%, which corresponds to that at the beginning of
the cycle condition. The hatched region corresponds to the range for the core design
of FUJI-U3, which is designed at the undermoderated region (left side of the curve).
Since the center region of the core in FUJI-U3 has a higher fuel fraction and a
lower graphite fraction, which means it has a lower G/U ratio, Kinf in this region
becomes lower than that in the outer region. This effect causes the flattening of the
neutron flux.
Based on the above concept, 2 million cases were investigated using the nuclear
analysis code SRAC95, and the final case was proposed as the optimized three-
region core, as is shown in Fig. 11.36.

The region located closest to the center is Core 1, and it has a fuel fraction of
39 vol%. Core 2 and Core 3 have fuel fractions of 27 vol% and 45 vol%, respec-
tively. The core diameter is 4.72 m, and its height is 4.66 m, then the power density
in the core region is 5.5 MW/m3; on the other hand, the MSBR was designed with
a power density of 22 MW/m3 (Robertson, 1971). There is a fuel path between
Core 3 and the graphite reflector; further, there are fuel ducts at the bottom and top
of the core. The width of fuel path or duct is 0.04 m. The thicknesses of the radial
and axial graphite reflectors are both 0.30 m. The entire core is enclosed in a reac-
tor vessel made of Hastelloy N, which has a thickness of 0.05 m with an inner
diameter of 5.40 m and a height of 5.34 m.
Table 11.2 shows the design parameters of FUJI-U3 for a capacity of 200 MWe.
In the criticality calculation, the effective multiplication factor (Keff) is maintained
close to unity, actually about 1.01.
Since SRAC95 is a static nuclear code, delayed neutron behavior is not consid-
ered. The delayed neutron fraction of FUJI-U3 is as small as 0.21%, because of a
smaller value of 233U than 235U. Since about 15% of fuel inventory exists out of
core, 15% of delayed neutron is lost out of core. Therefore, 0.03% delta-K
(5 0.21% 3 0.15) must be subtracted from the above-calculated Keff by SRAC95.
But this value is very small, and it does not affect design results.
The mean CR is 1.01, and the temperature coefficient of reactivity is 22.7 3
1025 1/K in average.
Figs. 11.38 and 11.39 show the FUJI-U3 radial and axial distribution of the fast
neutron flux with energy higher than 52 keV at the center of the core, compared
with the previous designs of FUJI-II (Furukawa et al., 1986) and FUJI-12 (Mitachi
et al., 2000). These are the flux distributions at the beginning of operation. In these

figures, the x-axis is normalized to 1.0 for each vessel outer radius (RV) or each
vessel half-height (HV) of the different designs.
Since the three-region core design is applied to FUJI-U3, the maximum value of
the fast neutron flux is fairly reduced compared with the previous FUJI-II and
FUJI-12 design results. Since the fast neutron flux of FUJI-U3 is below the irradia-
tion limit, which is specified to be 4.2 3 1013 cm22 s21 in the design condition
section, FUJI-U3 can be operated for 30 years without replacing the graphite
moderator.
Figs. 11.40 and 11.41 show the radial and axial distribution of the thermal neu-
tron flux with energy lower than 1.0 eV at the center of the core. The thermal neu-
tron flux is also flattened due to the three-region core design of FUJI-U3.
Compared with FUJI-II, FUJI-U3 has a lower graphite fraction at the center of the
core, and then, thermal neutron flux becomes lower there and is flattened. This
brings flatter heat generation throughout the core.

ORIGEN2 (Croff et al., 1980). Since ORIGEN2 requires one-group cross-sections,
it is necessary to reduce the number of energy groups for the cross-sections of
SRAC95. Using 107-group cross-sections and neutron flux of SRAC95 for each
region of FUJI-U3, one-group cross-sections are obtained for 211 nuclides (70 acti-
nides and 141 FPs). These 211 nuclides are selected because they have larger total
cross-sections and more importance among the 1297 nuclides in the core. For the
other 1086 nuclides having smaller total cross-sections, the ORIGEN2 cross-section
library for PWR is used. A total of 1297 nuclides are considered in this burnup
calculation.
In the burnup calculation, the continuous removal of FP gas from the fuel salt is
assumed through the gas removal system, as was proposed for the MSBR. These
gaseous FPs are Kr, Xe, H, T, Ne, Ar, and Rn. The removal speed in the system is
estimated to be 1.4% per minute of gaseous FPs in the fuel salt. And, in the actual
calculation, it is assumed that 99.9% of gaseous FP is removed and the residual
0.1% remains in the core at the Keff calculation point of every 40-day interval.
Since Xe reactivity loss is about 1.6% delta-K, which is dominant among gaseous
FPs, the above 0.1% residual effect is negligibly small.
Keff is calculated every 40 days, and it is maintained at approximately 1.01 by
feeding the new fuel salt. This makeup fuel for replenishment is composed of the
mixture of LiF (73 mol%) and 233UF4 (27 mol%), according to a proposal for the
Figure 11.41 Axial distribution of thermal neutron flux (Mitachi et al., 2008).

MSBR. LiF is added to the mixture to achieve a low melting point. In this makeup
fuel, the recovered U is used at first, and this U is obtained from the chemical pro-
cessing of the fuel salt, which is described later. If the amount of this recovered U
is not enough, then new 233U is used as an additional makeup fuel.
The fuel salt composition in the core changes with the burnup. The composition
is examined every 40200 days, and Li, Be, Th, and F are then added, if necessary.
As a result, the chemical composition of the fuel salt is maintained close to that of
the initial core. At this makeup time when Li/Be/Th/F are added, the one-group
cross-sections are also updated to those of the chemical composition of the new fuel
salt. In the makeup fuel, Li is supplied in the form of LiF, Be in the form of BeF2 or
metallic Be, and F as F2 in the gaseous form. Furthermore, Th is supplied in a mix-
ture of LiF (71 mol%) and ThF4 (29 mol%), according to a proposal for the MSBR.
11.2.7
Chemical processing of fuel salt
The FPs are accumulated in the fuel salt during the operation of the FUJI, and their
precipitation or extraction occurs when the concentration of the FPs is too high after
a long-time operation. Therefore, it is necessary to process the fuel salt chemically
before such a situation occurs. In this study, it is assumed that the chemical proces-
sing of the fuel salt is performed every 2000 EFPD (effective full-power days),
which corresponds to a 7.5-year interval with a 75% load factor. The details of the
chemical processing are described in the MSBR report (Robertson, 1971).
In this study, it is assumed that 100% of the actinides and FPs are removed from
the discharged fuel salt. The reactivity loss due to all FPs is about 5% delta-K, and
if a 95% removal is assumed, it will result in a small penalty of 0.25% delta-K in
the above calculation.
In the chemical processing, LiF, BeF2, ThF4, and UF4 are recovered and purified
from the discharged salt and are reused as fresh fuel salt. Moreover, the remainder
is used as a makeup fuel. Since Th decreases with burnup, it is added. On the other
hand, a small amount of U is removed in order to decrease Keff, because the
removal of FPs increases Keff just after the chemical processing. Since 233Pa decays
to 233U with a half-life of 27 days, all the PaF4 is recovered after the chemical pro-
cessing and reused as a potential fissile material of fuel salts.
11.2.8
Power control options for FUJI
There are several options for the power control of the MSR-FUJI. These options
can be also used for a small change of burnup behavior. Although the reactivity
decrease by fuel burnup is small in the MSR-FUJI, compensation for fuel burnup
can be performed by the fuel salt concentration adjustment system.
1. Control rod made of neutron-absorbing material
Current LWR licensing requires control rods in order to shutdown the reactor, which
are made of neutron-absorbing material, such as Ag-In-Cd for PWR, and B4C or hafnium
(Hf) for Boiling water reactor (BWR). The MSBR report does not show the design of this
320
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

type, but these control rods can be used not only to shutdown the MSR, but also to control
the power of the reactor.
2. Graphite control rod
A graphite control rod concept has been proposed for the MSBR (Robertson, 1971).
When the graphite rod is inserted into the core, it enhances neutron moderation, and
causes a small positive reactivity. Although the addition of reactivity is small (about 0.2%
delta-K/rod), it is enough for power control.
3. Flow control technology
When the core flow is increased, it causes a small positive reactivity, because of nega-
tive temperature coefficient. Then, this method is applicable to FUJI as shown by the col-
leagues of the authors (Ishihara et al., 2007a). This technology is the same as the power
control system in current BWRs, where the core flow is changed by a pump speed. Some
of the results are shown in Section 11.5. The advantage of this option is that there is no
depletion of control rods by the neutron irradiation in the core.
4. Temperature control technology
Recently, colleagues of the authors proposed another control method for the MSR,
which is to change the temperature of fuel salt by changing the turbine/generator output
(Yamamoto et al., 2006b). Its principle is the same as the power control system in current
PWRs, and feasible for the MSR too.
11.2.9
Burnup behavior of reactor characteristics
Fig. 11.42 shows the time behavior of Keff and CR. The x-axis shows EFPD, and
8213 EFPD corresponds to 30 years of operation with a load factor of 75%.
FUJI-U3 is designed to maintain criticality mainly by the makeup of 233UF4 fuel
salt every 40 days (30 EFPD) for the 30-year operation.
Since the decrease in reactivity within 40 days is about 0.2% delta-K, this small
change can be regulated either by the movement of the graphite rod, or by the
adjustment of the core flow, or by the change of the temperature of fuel salt by
changing the turbine/generator output.
The mean value of the CR throughout the lifetime for the above-mentioned case
is 1.01. Meanwhile the CR of old FUJI-12 value was 0.92, showing the effective-
ness of FUJI-U3’s three-region concept.
Figure 11.42 Time behavior of Keff and conversion ratio (Mitachi et al., 2008).
321
Liquid fuel, thermal neutron spectrum reactors

Table 11.3 shows the change in the reactor characteristic parameters when FUJI-
U3 is operated for 30 years. In this table, it is assumed that chemical processing is
performed between the dates of 2000 and 2001, and so on. Keff is kept about 1.01,
except at the starting point. The maximum neutron flux (φG) of energy higher than
52 keV in the graphite moderator is 4.1 3 1013 cm22 s21, which is restricted by
neutron radiation damage. The maximum neutron flux φV on the inner wall of the
vessel is 1.4 3 1011 cm22 s21 for the fast neutron flux with energy higher than
0.8 MeV, and 2.5 3 1012 cm22 s21 for the thermal neutron flux with energy lower
than 1.0 eV. Both values are below the irradiation limit of this study, and the
FUJI-U3 design satisfies the design condition for the neutron irradiation of 30 years
operation. As a future study, borated graphite can be used to reduce the neutron
flux at the vessel.
The temperature coefficient of reactivity (αT) is 22.7 3 1025 1/K on average,
and this temperature coefficient is sufficient for stable control.
11.2.10
Material balance of actinides
Table 11.4 shows the material balance of actinides such as U/Th/Pu and MA in
FUJI-U3. This table shows the calculated results for the initial inventory, reload
fuel, and total feed for 30 years’ operation. The final remaining amount of actinides
and their net production are the values after 30 years’ operation. In this table,
“Initial inventory” is the weight of Th and U-fissile at the beginning of the FUJI-U3
operation, and “Net feed” is the weight of charged Th and U-fissile after startup and
up to the closing of the reactor, which is 30 years later. “Total demand” is the sum
of “Initial inventory” and “Net feed.” “Final remaining amount” is the weight of the
actinides at the closing of the reactor. Finally, “Net production” is the difference

between “Final remaining amount” and “Total demand.” The negative value for the
net production implies consumption. In the column of “Final remaining amount” of
this table, 233Pa is added to U-fissile, because 233Pa decays to 233U with a half-life
of 27 days.
As shown in this table, the net production of Pu is 0.70 kg and that of MA
(mostly Np) is 4.55 kg. Therefore, it is confirmed that there is very little production
of Pu and MA, and it shows the benefits of the Th cycle.
11.2.11
Fission products
Table 11.5 shows the amount of FP, which is accumulated in FUJI-U3 at the point
of 30 years. These FPs are classified into gaseous FP, liquid FP, and solid FP.
Since the gas solubility of the fuel salt is sufficiently low, the FP gas is easily
and continuously removed from the fuel salt by the He gas bubbling system. As
shown in this table, the residual gaseous FP mass is only 178 g.
The concentration of the third valence FP must be less than 1 mol%, considering
the solubility of the FP in the fuel salt, as is evaluated in the MSBR report
(Robertson, 1971). As is shown in this table, the maximum concentration of the
third valence FP is 0.11 mol%. Therefore, precipitation does not occur for the third
valence liquid FP.

The concentration of other metals, except third valence FP, is 0.16 mol%. Since
this concentration is less than 1 mol%, it is considered that there is no chemical
influence on the graphite and the vessel, as is evaluated in the MSBR report
(Robertson, 1971).
As for the solid FP, the total amount is 158 kg, and they are Mo/Ru/Tc and so
on. Most of them are removed by the filter system, which is equipped in the pri-
mary loop; subsequently, there will be little precipitation of the solid FP on the wall
of the primary loop. However, this should be confirmed in the future.
Based on the above consideration, the operation of FUJI-U3 will not face serious
problems for FP accumulation.
11.2.12
Fuel requirement and actinides for a 1 GWe plant
In order to compare the MSR performance with a 1 GWe BWR (Hida and
Yoshioka, 1992), the above-mentioned FUJI-U3 results are multiplied by 5
(1000 MWe/200 MWe 5 5). The fuel requirement and the amount of Pu/MA are
shown in Table 11.6. In this comparison, it is assumed that the BWR uses uranium
oxide as the fuel and has an operation period of 25.9 years with an 87% load factor.
This means that the operation period is 22.5 EFPY (effective full-power years) for
both reactors.
The initial fissile (233U) amount for FUJI-U3 is extrapolated to be 5.7 t for a
capacity of 1-Gwe, and that (235U) for the BWR is 3.9 t.
The amount of fissile material fed as a reload fuel is 2.1 t of 233U. This value is
10% of the BWR amount of 20.7 t of 235U.
The total requirement of fissile material for the entire operation period is 7.8 t of
233U. This value is 32% of the BWR amount of 24.6 t of 235U. One of the big

benefits of FUJI-U3 is that since CR is almost 1.0, the same amount of fissile is dis-
charged at the end of FUJI operation, and this fissile (7.9 t) can be used to the next
FUJI.
FUJI-U3 produces 3.5 kg of Pu for a 30-year operation period, whereas BWR
produces 5080 kg for the same period. This implies that Pu production in FUJI-U3
is only 0.1% of that in BWR.
The production of MA, which are long-lived nuclear wastes, is 23 kg, whereas
BWR produces 543 kg for the same period. This implies that MA production in
FUJI-U3 is 4% of that in BWR.
11.2.13
FUJI-Pu (using Pu as initial fissile)
At the initial stage of the Th cycle, MSR needs fissile material for initial start-up,
because natural Th does not contain 233U. One proposal is to utilize plutonium (Pu)
from LWR spent fuel, Therefore, Pu burner version: FUJI-Pu was studied (Mitachi
and Furukawa, 1995). FUJI-Pu can be applied to incinerate recovered Pu from
LWR spent fuels and convert Th to 233U.
In this study, 100 MW (electric) and 250 MW (thermal) output are assumed, and
the initial fuel composition is 7LiF-BeF2-ThF4-PuF3 (71.8-16.0-12.0-0.25 mol%).
As is shown in Fig. 11.43 and Table 11.7, FUJI-Pu can consume 244 kg of Pu-
fissile, and produce 112 kg of U-fissile for 900 days full-power operation.
If these values can be extrapolated to 1 GWe plant in 365 EFPD with 100%
power operation, these values can be multiplied by 4.06 (5 1000 MWe/100 MWe
3 365 days/900 days). Then, FUJI-Pu of 1 GWe can consume fissile Pu of 991 kg
for each 365 EFPD, and can generate fissile U of 455 kg for that period.
11.2.14
Transmutation of minor actinides by the MSR-FUJI
As is shown above, production of MA in the MSR-FUJI is very small. Since these
MAs have certain absorption cross-sections for thermal neutrons, MAs from LWR
Figure 11.43 Fissile inventory of FUJI-Pu for 900 EFPD (Mitachi and Furukawa, 1995).
325
Liquid fuel, thermal neutron spectrum reactors

spent fuel can be efficiently transmuted to stable or shorter lifetime elements. A
preliminary study was performed on 1000 MWe (2250 MWt) FUJI case. Assuming
totally loaded MA of 5940 kg, it is calculated that 85% of MA is transmuted for
30 years’ operation. This means 170 kg MA is consumed yearly (Osaka et al., 1995).
11.2.15
super-FUJI (large-sized plant)
FUJI was originally designed as a relatively small-sized plant, because it is aimed
to deploy widely in the world. But, large-sized plant, such as 1000 MWe are also
possible, such as the 1000 MWe MSBR by ORNL. Since the MSR does not need a
high-pressure vessel, it will be easier to design a large-sized plant, of course, large-
sized equipment, such as molten salt pump or graphite, have to be developed.
A preliminary design was performed as “super-FUJI,” assuming 1000 MW (elec-
tric) and 2272 MW (thermal) output (Mitachi et al., 1994). As is shown in
Fig. 11.44, the core is composed of graphite rods of hexagonal shape, and the fuel
salt passes through center holes of each graphite rods. Each graphite fraction can be

optimized by changing a fuel path diameter, and the average graphite fraction is
0.87, the same as MSBR. An initial fuel composition is 7LiF-BeF2-ThF4-233UF4
(71.8-16.0-12.0-0.2 mol%), and an initial 233UF4 inventory is 1.5 ton. This is a
somewhat old design, but fissile inventory is minimized owing to a higher graphite
fraction and softer neutron spectrum. An initial CR is 0.98, and lifetime average
CR will be lower than this value. In general, a large-sized plant has better neutron
economy, and CR can be improved. But, an initial fissile inventory and CR are in a
trade-off relationship in most cases.
11.2.16
mini-FUJI (pilot plant)
Almost all reactor engineering was established at ORNL for the MSRE and the
MSBR design. But, it was 4050 years ago, and the technology has to be rebuilt
by a pilot plant “mini-FUJI” (Furukawa et al., 2010). Two major items were not
demonstrated in the MSRE.
1. Use of Th in fuel salt;
2. Development of a SG, because the heat in secondary salt of the MSRE was released to
the open air. SG development experience for the FBR can be applied.
Table 11.8 shows basic design parameters for FUJI-U3 in the previous section,
mini-FUJI, and the MSRE (Robertson, 1965). Fig. 11.45 shows a horizontal cross-
section and vertical cross-section of mini-FUJI.

Summary of FUJI design results
A small MSR FUJI-U3 with a three-region core design achieved the optimum combi-
nation among flattening and leakage of neutron flux. The core performance of the
reactor is obtained by calculations performed using the reactor analysis code SRAC95
and the burnup analysis code ORIGEN2. The main results obtained are as follows.
1. It is possible to operate the reactor with an electric power of 200 MWe (thermal power
output of 450 MW(th), 44.4% thermal efficiency) together with a load factor of 75% for
30 years without replacing the graphite moderator.
2. With regard to the average CR, a high value of 1.01 is achieved without online reproces-
sing, and it is almost self-sustaining. Also, the residual fissile at the end of the reactor life
can be used to the next FUJI.
For comparison with a 1-GWe BWR, the results of FUJI-U3 for a 30-year opera-
tion period are scaled to those of a 1-GWe capacity.
3. The 233U requirement for FUJI-U3 is 7.8 t, and this value is 32% of the BWR. At the end of
FUJI-U3 operation, 7.9 t of fissile is discharged, and this fissile can be used to the next FUJI.
4. FUJI-U3 produces 3.5 kg of Pu for a 30-year operation period, whereas BWR produces
5080 kg for the same period. This implies that Pu production in FUJI-U3 is only 0.1% of
that in BWR.
5. The production of MA, which are long-lived nuclear wastes, is 23 kg, whereas BWR pro-
duces 543 kg for the same period. This implies that MA production in FUJI-U3 is 4% of
that in BWR.

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

Besides FUJI-U3 design, a brief summary of FUJI-Pu is shown, which can con-
sume fissile Pu of 991 kg for each 365 EFPD, and can generate fissile U of 455 kg
for that period, if FUJI-Pu can be extrapolated to 1 GWe plant. Also, transmutation
capability of MA in 1000 MWe FUJI is investigated, and it is shown that 170 kg
MA is consumed yearly. As for the flexibility of plant size, a conceptual design of
super-FUJI of 1000 MWe is shown. Finally, a concept of pilot plant mini-FUJI is
described.
11.3
Safety concepts of the MSR
11.3.1
Introduction
The MSR has very high safety, because of the following unique features, including
practically no possibility of a severe accident (Furukawa et al., 2007).
1. Its primary loop and a secondary loop are operated at a very low pressure (about 0.5 MPa),
which essentially eliminates accidents such as system rupture due to high pressure.
2. The molten salt is chemically inert, that is, it does not react violently with air or water,
and is not flammable. The corrosion of Hastelloy N can be minimized by the appropriate
chemical control and maintenance of the molten salt.
3. Pressure increase in a primary loop is incredible, because boiling temperature of the fuel
salt is very high (about 1400C) compared with the operating temperature (about
700C).
4. Since there is no water within a containment, there is no possibility of high pressure by
steam generation, and no possibility of hydrogen explosion, at any accidental conditions.
5. The fuel salt is drained to a drain tank through a freeze valve, if required. In case of a
rupture in the primary loop, the spilled fuel salt is drained to an emergency drain tank
without passing a freeze valve.
6. The fuel salt can keep criticality only where graphite exists in an appropriate fraction. In
an accident, the fuel salt, which is drained to a drain tank, cannot cause a recriticality
accident.
(As for the MSR without graphite moderator, this drain tank is appropriately designed
to prevent recriticality.)
7. The MSR has a large negative reactivity coefficient of a fuel salt temperature that can
suppress an abnormal change of the reactor power. Although a temperature coefficient
of graphite is positive, it does not affect the safety, because the heat capacity of graphite
is large enough.
8. Since gaseous FPs can be removed by separating from the fuel salt, the danger due to
the release of radioactivity from the core at accidental conditions can be minimized.
9. Since fuel composition can be adjusted when necessary, an excess reactivity and a reac-
tivity margin to be compensated by control rods are small. Therefore, reactivity require-
ments for control rods are also small.
10. The delayed neutron fraction of 233U is lower than that of 235U and some delayed neu-
trons are generated outside the core. However, safe control of the reactor is possible
because of a large negative reactivity coefficient with fuel salt temperature, and small
reactivity insertion.
11. Since there is no airflow and no heat source within a core when fuel salt is drained at an
accidental condition, graphite fire does not occur.

Safety concepts of the MSR
In the current LWR licensing, there are two major guidelines for safety. One is
used as a guide for safety design of the reactor at a conceptual design stage, which
is called “General Design Criteria (GDC).” And another is used for accident analy-
sis, which defines the events to be studied in licensing and provides the criteria of
the analyzed results. Both guidelines have not been issued for the MSR. As for the
former one, GDC for FHR (fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactor) is now
being established in the framework of the American Nuclear Society (Flanagan,
2012; ANS 20.1 working group, 2014). Based on its results, the GDC for the MSR
is being proposed by the authors, and is described in Section 11.6. As for the latter
one on accident analysis, it is proposed by the authors, and is described in
Section 11.4 (Yoshioka et al., 2014; Yoshioka and Kinoshita, 2014).
The following safety concept of the MSR should be reinvestigated after these
two guidelines are issued. Also, PRA/PSA (Probabilistic Risk Assessment/
Probabilistic Safety Assessment) is required at a detailed design stage, when numer-
ical data for risk evaluation become available.
The safety concept of the MSR in this section is based on the 150 MWe Fuji
design shown in Fig. 11.46, which is a typical thermal neutron spectrum MSR with-
out online reprocessing, as was explained in Section 11.2. If online reprocessing is
applied, or if other designs are applied, then its safety must be redefined and
described.

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

The safety functions, which the MSR must be equipped with, are essentially the
same as those for LWR. In any nuclear facilities, it is most important to prevent or
to minimize the release of radioactive materials into the environment. In order to
achieve this objective, the following three safety functions are required, the same as
LWR, which are shutdown function, cooling function, and containment function.
1. Shutdown function
This function is to stop (shutdown) nuclear fission and to terminate the fission energy
generation at any time so as not to damage the core. As for the shutdown function of the
MSR, there are three different diverse systems. The first is a high-speed shutdown system
(scram system) by a small number of control rods, and the second shutdown system is a
fuel salt passive drain system. The above two systems satisfy current licensing criteria.
But in the MSR, the third shutdown system by fuel salt concentration adjustment would
be applicable as a backup system, for example, adding thorium as neutron-absorbing
material, although its effect is slow.
2. Cooling function
This function is to remove the decay heat continuously even after the accident, and to
keep the integrity of the fuel or the primary loop by providing enough cooling. As for the
emergency core cooling system (ECCS), which is required in order to make-up the cool-
ing water for LWR, it is not required for the MSR. In case of loss of all cooling functions
such as station blackout (SBO), the fuel salt is drained to the drain tank. This drain tank is
passively cooled without electricity by the decay heat removal system.
3. Containment function
This function is to control or minimize the influence on the environment by the radio-
active materials in case of a large accident. The MSR has three levels for containment
safety, as was proposed in MSBR design at ORNL. The first level is a reactor vessel and
pipes made of Hastelloy N. The second level is a HTC composed of three layers, which
contains a reactor vessel, pipes, and HXs. The third level is a RB composed of two layers.
Therefore, in total six layers are designed for the MSR.
As was explained in previous sections, gaseous FPs are continuously removed
from the fuel salt, and the release of radioactivity is minimized before an accidental
situation. Also, danger by steam generation or hydrogen gas generation is excluded
in the MSR. These features would strengthen the containment function.
Besides the above three safety functions, the concept of the “defense in depth”
principle is adopted to assure the higher safety of the facility. High safety is
achieved by taking this concept at five different levels to the design. Each level,
objective, and essential means are summarized in Table 11.9, based on the IAEA’s
definition (IAEA, 1996).
The concept of the “defense in depth” principle in the MSR should be the same
as for LWRs, and it is not described further here.
11.3.3
Safety analysis of the MSR
In the current LWR licensing, all abnormal events are categorized into three types,
which are abnormal operating transients (AOT), design basis accidents (DBA), and
severe accidents (SA) which are beyond DBA.
331
Liquid fuel, thermal neutron spectrum reactors

In order to investigate a wide range of safety on the MSR, all possible accidental
scenarios must be considered. Their details are described in Section 11.4, but its
conclusion is briefly described below.
At first, the following two types of accidental scenarios are considered. The first
is the external cause accident, which is initiated by external events, such as earth-
quake, tsunami, flood, wind, fire, turbine missiles, terrorism, and so on. Another is
the internal cause accident, which is caused by internal events, such as overpres-
sure, overheating, and other mechanical failures of the primary loop boundary. The
external cause accidents are generic to any reactors, and are not described here. The
internal cause accidents are subcategorized as below.
1. Power increase accident or RIA (reactivity initiated accident), for example, control rod
ejection accident.
2. Flow decrease accident, for example, fuel salt pump stopping accident.
3. Fuel salt leak accident, for example, rupture of primary loop pipes.
4. Other accidents, mostly MSR-specific, such as molten salt freeze accident.
Preliminary evaluations for the MSR major accidents (AOT and DBA) are
shown in Section 11.4, and it is shown that there will be no release of radioactive
materials into the environment even in DBAs, except the failure accident of an off-
gas system.
As for the following three accidents, which were previously considered “beyond
DBA,” they are now included in the DBA. This is because these accidents are con-
sidered more probable than before, and some of them have actually occurred.
1. SBO is caused by a loss of external electric sources and failures of emergency diesel gen-
erators, and its occurrence has been believed incredible. However, SBO has occurred in
several nuclear plants, and SBO provision was issued by the US-NRC (2010) (Also, check
the latest information at US-NRC web-site, such as “10CFR50.63: Loss of All Alternating
Current Power”.), to be included in DBA.

2. Anticipated transients without scram (ATWS) is a transient event at a reactor without
insertion of control rods for shutdown. This provision was issued and applied as ATWS
rules by the US-NRC (2014b).
3. Aircraft impact assessment is now required by the US-NRC (2014a), for newly licensed
nuclear plants in USA, after the 9/11 aircraft attack in 2001.
As for the consideration on SA in the MSR, there will be no release of radioac-
tive materials into the environment in DBAs. And as a result, SA such as simulta-
neous loss of cooling function and containment function is incredible, except the
external cause accident by terrorism or missiles. Of course, since SA assumes any
possible accidental situation of the reactor, its possibility and source term issue at
the release of radioactive material into the environment should be re-evaluated in a
detailed design stage. The source term issue is described again in Section 11.4.
11.3.4
MSR safety against fukushima-type accidents
It was studied whether the MSR is still safe against a Fukushima-type accident,
which was a SA that occurred on March 11 2011, and the study conclusion is
referred as follows (Yoshioka, 2013).
1. The MSR is safe in case of loss of all electricity and/or loss of all core cooling, because natu-
ral circulation cooling is possible. In addition, fuel salt is drained to a drain tank if required.
2. The drain tank is equipped with a cooling system that does not need electricity.
3. There is no fuel damage or fuel melt-down, owing to its intrinsic feature of molten salt.
4. There is no danger of high pressure in the reactor vessel or containment, because there is
no overpressure possibility due to vaporization of molten salt or water.
5. There is no danger of hydrogen explosion, because there is no water or zirconium within
the containment.
6. Spent fuel salt is drained to a spent fuel tank, which is cooled the same as a drain tank.
7. Seismic design and countermeasures for tsunami are required, as for an LWR.
8. Even in a worst-case scenario, gaseous FPs are not released, because they are already
removed in normal operation. Other FPs stay within fuel salt, and solidify to glassy mate-
rial below melting temperature.
11.3.5
Summary
The basic safety concept of the MSR and a summary of the analysis are described
here. Based on the preliminary evaluations for the MSR major accidents (AOT and
DBA), as is shown in Section 11.4, there will be no release of radioactive materials
into the environment, except for failure of the off-gas system. Therefore, the MSR
can be designed to have superior safety.
11.4
Safety criteria of the MSR
11.4.1
Introduction
Possible accidents for MSR have been investigated, and several calculations were
made for the experimental reactor MSRE (Haubenreich and Engel, 1962; Beall
333
Liquid fuel, thermal neutron spectrum reactors

et al., 1964). However, those studies were 50 years ago, and they may not be appli-
cable from the standpoint of the recent licensing approach for LWRs. Since then,
safety criteria or guidelines have not been defined for MSR accident analysis.
In the current LWR licensing, there are two major guidelines. One is used as a
guide for safety design of the reactor at a conceptual stage (Nuclear Safety
Commission of Japan, 1990a), which is called GDC. And another is used for acci-
dent analysis (Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan, 1990b), which defines the
events to be studied in licensing and provides the criteria for analyzing the results.
In this section, the authors describe several candidates for MSR safety criteria,
and show one proposal, which is based on temperature limitations of the component
material: Hastelloy N.
11.4.2
Definition of “accident”
In the current LWR licensing, all abnormal events are categorized into three types,
which are AOT, DBA, and SA which are beyond DBA, as is shown in Fig. 11.47
and Table 11.10. In this section, the authors include all three types as “accidents,”
because their definitions for LWR may not be applicable to the MSR, and also may
be changed depending on different safety designs. Therefore, each accident shown
in Section 11.5.3 (Accident to be considered) must be categorized to AOT or DBA
or SA at a later stage, depending on its severity, probability, and safety design.
11.4.3
Safety criteria for the MSR
Since there are no safety criteria for the MSR, the authors started from safety crite-
ria for LWR, and propose the possible criteria for AOT. Safety criteria for DBA,
SA, and normal operation are future discussions.
Safety criteria for abnormal operating transients (AOT)
As for LWR, the objective of safety criteria for AOT is to keep re-startup capability
of the reactor after AOT occurs. Therefore, in order to keep fuel integrity, heat flux
index such as DNBR (departure from nucleate boiling) or MCPR (minimum critical

power ratio) shall not violate the limit, fuel cladding tube shall not mechanically
fail, and fuel enthalpy shall be less than the limit. Also, in order to keep primary
system integrity, reactor system pressure shall be less than the limit.
Since the fuel of MSR is molten salt, mechanical fuel failure is impossible.
Then, the above criteria for fuel integrity cannot be applied directly. Also, since
molten salt has high boiling temperature and low vapor pressure, a boiling accident
would be incredible. Therefore, pressure criteria for primary system integrity are
not appropriate to apply.
Therefore, appropriate criteria for primary loop boundary should be considered.
Of course, the reactor vessel of MSR must satisfy the provision of the ASME code
(ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code) such as ductility, brittleness, fatigue fail-
ure, or stress corrosion cracking, and so on, but these are mostly for steady state
and for long-term design conditions.
There are two candidates for safety criteria as follows. The first is the maximum
allowable design stress. In the MSBR design report, they defined the maximum
allowable design stress as 250 kg/cm2 at 704C for Hastelloy N (Robertson, 1971).
This value is generally derived from the (ultimate) tensile strength of the material
by dividing a safety factor, for example 10 or more, but the above source document
does not show the deriving process.
The maximum allowable design stress of Hastelloy N is shown in Fig. 11.48, but
there is no information beyond 704C (Robertson, 1971). The author’s aim is not to
apply this value directly, but to estimate the temperature limitation. If this curve is
extrapolated beyond that point, limiting temperature may be somewhere between
900 and 1000C. However, these limiting temperatures are applicable for long-term
operation. Therefore, these criteria may be conservative for a short-time event such
as AOT.
One more possible candidate is the (ultimate) tensile strength of Hastelloy N.
Since a reactor vessel for MSR is not a “pressure vessel” and pressurization tran-
sient is incredible, loss of strength of the material could be limiting. In general, the
tensile strength is used as the ultimate strength of metals. Based on the existing
data for the tensile strength as is shown in Fig. 11.49, if it is extrapolated, the maxi-
mum allowable temperature could be somewhere between 900 and 1000C (Haynes
International Inc., 2002). For other Hastelloys such as Hastelloy B/Hastelloy

C/Hastelloy X, the maximum allowable temperatures are similar (Taihei Techno
Service, 2015).
As is described above, the author’s aim is not to apply the tensile strength
directly, but to estimate the temperature limitation. Apart from this attempt, the ten-
sile strength is about 5300 kg/cm2 at 704C based on this figure, and this means
that the safety factor for maximum allowable design stress for MSBR is about 21
(55300/250).
Based on the above consideration, the limiting temperature may be somewhere
between 900 and 1000C. In order to decide the limiting point, the author’s group
proposes to apply the same concept of safety criteria for LWR fuel cladding tube to
reactor vessel and piping of MSR. That is, current LWR licensing requires that the
plastic strain of fuel cladding tube shall be less than 1% to prevent mechanical fail-
ure of the fuel cladding tube. Assuming MSR’s vessel temperature is identical to
fuel salt, the allowable fuel salt temperature should be less than the temperature
that causes a plastic strain of 1% during 1 hour for primary loop boundary under
the design load. Here, the maximum duration is conservatively chosen to be 1 hour,
which is long enough to shutdown the reactor and take corrective actions. This is

similar to the fuel rod cladding tube criteria of LWRs, although time endurance is
not defined in LWR.
Using a Larson-Miller plot of Hastelloy N (Haubenreich and Engel, 1962;
Haynes International Inc., 2002), the limiting temperatures can be estimated. For
example, 930C for outlet and 790C for inlet fuel salt in the MSBR reactor vessel
(Shimazu, 1978b). Violating this fuel temperature criteria, fuel salt must be drained
to a drain tank quickly. The drain tank of MSR can confine radioactivity, thus no
radiation release will occur.
Of course, LWR fuels are discharged after 45 years even if AOT occurs, and
they do not experience second AOT. On the other hand, reactor vessel and piping
of MSR are used for several decades. This issue must be discussed in the future.
Another possible candidate may be oxidation criteria. The ASME pressure vessel
standard requires the allowable oxidation, if it occurs. The report of the Hastelloy N
manufacturer says that about 1000C may be the limit, as is shown in Fig. 11.50
(Haynes International Inc., 2002). But, since the primary loop of MSR is enclosed
with an inert gas such as nitrogen gas within the containment, oxidation will be
very minor. Therefore, the oxidation criterion is not applicable.
Safety criteria for design basis accidents (DBAs) and other events
As for LWR, the objective of safety criteria for DBAs is to prevent the occurrence
of a large release of radioactivity from the reactor, even if fuel failure occurs and
radioactivity is released outside the fuel cladding tube. In order to prevent this situ-
ation, it is required that the reactor is not damaged severely, the reactor maintains
coolable geometry, fuel enthalpy is lower than the limit, pressure of primary loop
boundary is lower than the limit, pressure of containment boundary is lower than
the limit, and radiation risk to the public is not severe.
Based on the possible scenarios for MSR accidents, it is incredible that any
DBAs will cause large radioactivity release. Therefore, safety criteria for DBAs
should be investigated in the future.

International Inc., 2002).
337
Liquid fuel, thermal neutron spectrum reactors

Regarding the safety criteria for SA, which are beyond DBA, there is no global
standard at this time. Also, SA is more incredible for the MSR than DBA.
Therefore, this issue should be also discussed in the future.
As for the limit for normal operation, criteria are defined for LWR, in order to
prevent the violation of AOT criteria even if AOT occurs. The MSR may also need
similar criteria, for example, criteria for maximum outlet temperature of fuel salt at
normal operation in order to satisfy the AOT criteria even if AOT occurs. This issue
should be also discussed in the future.
11.4.4
Summary
Regarding the safety criteria for MSR accident analysis, based on the allowable
stress and tensile strength of Hastelloy N, temperatures between 900 and 1000C
will be applicable for long-time limitation of the fuel salt. But, for short-time events
such as AOT, the author’s group proposes to limit the fuel salt temperature based on
the plastic strain of 1% during 1 hour for primary loop boundary under design load.
Safety criteria against DBA, SA beyond DBA, and normal operation should be
discussed in the future.
11.5
MSR accident analysis
11.5.1
Introduction
In order to perform MSR accident analyses and to establish guidelines for them, we
have to investigate all possible accidents. This study is also required to prepare a
preliminary safety analysis report (PSAR). In this section, the authors describe the
philosophy for MSR accident analysis, and show 40 possible accidents based on the
philosophy with some numerical results.
11.5.2
Classification of accidents
The objective of accident analysis is to prevent or mitigate radioactivity release in
case of accidents, which may affect human health. In the MSR, this is caused by
rupture or break of the primary loop boundary, which is composed of a reactor ves-
sel, pipes, pumps, HXs, and so on. Either external or internal accidents may cause
such a break.
External cause accidents
External cause accidents are initiated by external events, such as earthquake, tsu-
nami, flood, wind, fire, turbine missiles, terrorism, and so on. In addition to these
accidents, there are other standard accidents such as turbine trip accident, generator
trip accident (load rejection accident), loss of external electric source accident,
338
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

which are caused by initiating events outside the RB but affect the reactor. These
ten types accidents are generic ones, and not discussed here.
Internal cause accidents
Internal cause accidents are caused by internal events, such as overpressure, over-
heat, and other mechanical failures of the primary loop boundary. These are dis-
cussed in Section 11.5.3.
Of course, even if the above accidents occur, it does not mean release of radioac-
tivity to outside the reactor. Based on the defense-in-depth principle, there are addi-
tional containments and the RB, which prevent or mitigate radioactivity release,
and therefore, these systems are sometimes called “mitigation system” (MS) in cur-
rent LWR licensing. MS includes containment, RB, control-rod scram system,
ECCS, and so on. Meanwhile, a primary loop boundary such as a reactor vessel is
called a “prevention system” (PS), whose failure initiates the accident.
11.5.3
Accident to be considered
The above internal cause accidents are categorized into the following four types
(Table 11.11), which must be evaluated or analyzed in the framework of safety
guidelines.
Regarding accidental causes such as overpressure or overheating, they are caused
by power increase accident (Section 11.5.3.1) or flow decrease accident (Section
11.5.3.2), because temperature rise or enthalpy rise is proportional to power and
inversely proportional to flow. In the MSR, vapor pressure is very low, and overpres-
sure accidents are incredible with one exception, which is a SG break accident
described in Section 11.5.3.4. Besides these two accidents, fuel salt leak accident
(Section 11.5.3.3) may be caused by other mechanical failures of the primary loop
boundary. Therefore, the above three types of accidents must be considered. Of course,
some of the second and the third types ofaccidents may cause a reactivity increase as a

result. Meanwhile, the first accident type is usually called a reactivity initiated accident
(RIA), because it is initiated by the insertion of positive reactivity at first.
Besides these three categories, the fourth category, named “other accidents”
(Section 11.5.3.4) is considered. These accidents are mostly specific to the MSR. In
some cases, this category is just a cause of the above three accidents, and then these
accidents may be recategorized in the future.
In this section, the following typical MSR concept is assumed as is shown in
Fig. 11.51, which was originally proposed by ORNL for MSBR design (Robertson,
1971), applying graphite moderator, single-fluid design, with gaseous FP removal
system. One big improvement from the original design by the authors is removal of
online reprocessing equipment, in order to simplify the reactor (Furukawa et al.,
2008; Yoshioka, 2013).
11.5.3.1
Power increase accident or RIA (Reactivity Initiated
Accident)
11.5.3.1.1
Control rod withdrawal/ejection accident
This is a most typical RIA. If we adopt a control rod made of neutron-absorbing
material, and when this control rod is inserted in operation and is withdrawn or
ejected by some equipment failure or operator error, then an RIA occurs. If we
adopt a control rod made of graphite, which was proposed for the MSBR
(Robertson, 1971), insertion of graphite control rod increases more neutron modera-
tion and it may cause an RIA. Owing to a large negative reactivity coefficient of
fuel salt temperature, power excursion terminates, even if control rod scram

from Fig. 11.31).

function fails. Meanwhile, a reactivity coefficient of graphite temperature is slightly
positive, but this does not cause any problem, because heat transfer to graphite is
slow. RIA was analyzed for the MSBR as shown in Fig. 11.52 (Shimazu, 1978b),
and for small-sized MSR: FUJI case (Suzuki and Shimazu, 2008).
Although delayed neutron fraction (β) of 233U is smaller than 235U, this does not
affect dynamic behavior of the MSR. In order to confirm this, the authors show
one-point kinetic equations using an adiabatic model without core cooling
(Ishimori, 1973).

It is clear that delayed neutron fraction does not affect the maximum neutron flux
nor maximum fuel salt temperature. On the other hand, the MSR has a longer prompt
neutron lifetime than LWR, and this fact mitigates the maximum neutron flux.
11.5.3.1.2
Cold-loop startup accident
Since the reactivity coefficient of fuel salt temperature is negative, if fuel salt pump
is inadvertently restarted from stand-by condition, and cold fuel salt is injected into
the core, then positive reactivity is inserted. However, the lowest possible tempera-
ture of fuel salt is the melting temperature, and the consequence is limited.
11.5.3.1.3
Secondary salt flow increase accident
If secondary salt flow increases, then fuel salt is more cooled than before and
positive reactivity is inserted.
11.5.3.1.4
Secondary salt temperature decrease accident
If secondary salt flow decreases, then fuel salt is more cooled than before and posi-
tive reactivity is inserted.
If secondary salt temperature decreases, same situation as above occurs.
11.5.3.1.5
Fuel salt flow increase accident
If fuel salt flow is increased, then a core temperature is decreased, and then the
reactor power is increased due to negative temperature coefficient. However, the
reactor power is stabilized to a certain value, which is called a “consistent power
level,” as is shown in Fig. 11.54 (Ishihara et al., 2007b).

11.5.3.1.6
Fuel salt filling accident
When fuel salt is filled from a drain tank to the core without any safety protection
systems, a criticality accident may occur. Since an accident consequence depends
on safety design, therefore its design must be described.
11.5.3.1.7
Excessive fissile addition or fertile removal accident
MSR is equipped with a system that can adjust fuel salt composition. If excessive
fissile material is injected into fuel salt, positive reactivity is inserted. Removal of
thorium salt, which is a neutron absorber, causes the same result. Therefore, the
safety design must be described.
11.5.3.1.8
Depressurization accident
MSR has a slightly positive void reactivity coefficient of fuel salt, and a small
amount of He bubbles circulate within the primary loops in order to remove gas-
eous FPs (Xe/Kr/T) from fuel salt. Therefore, if depressurization occurs, bubbles
become larger and positive reactivity is inserted, as is shown in Fig. 11.55 (Suzuki
and Shimazu, 2006). Depressurization may be caused by break of primary loop
boundary, stopping of pumps, and so on, because in normal operation, fuel salt

Malfunction in a He-bubble injection system may cause a similar result.
11.5.3.1.9
Fissile precipitation accident
Fissile material such as uranium (U) has high solubility in fuel salt. However, if U
precipitates and this U deposit is suddenly injected into the core, then positive reac-
tivity is inserted. The cause of this accident may be invasion of moisture or oxygen
in fuel salt.
11.5.3.1.10
Graphite loss accident
If graphite breaks and flows out from the core, increased volume of fuel salt may
causes positive reactivity insertion. However, as is explained above, graphite con-
trol rod insertion causes positive reactivity by increasing neutron moderation.
Therefore, loss of graphite will insert negative reactivity.

11.5.3.1.11
Fissile penetration to graphite accident
If uranium (U) penetrates to the surface of graphite, and if this U is suddenly
released into fuel salt, then positive reactivity may be inserted.
11.5.3.2
Flow decrease accident
11.5.3.2.1
Pump trip accident
If all fuel salt pumps trip (stop), heat removal function is lost. (In LWR licensing,
one pump trip is categorized to AOT, and if all pumps trip it is categorized to DBA.)
Then, fuel salt temperature increases. Also, delayed neutrons increase in the core
Figure 11.55 Depressurization accident (Suzuki and Shimazu, 2006).
344
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

when salt circulation stops, and it causes the same effect as positive reactivity inser-
tion. This is because normally some of the delayed neutrons are lost out of the core;
for example, about 10% for FUJI-U3 case, and about 40% for MSBR design case.
However, owing to the negative reactivity coefficient, its consequence is not as
severe as pump seizure accident as is described below. In this pump trip accident
case, control rods are inserted and nuclear fissions stop. In this situation, since pump
has a free rotation, natural circulation is expected, as is shown in Fig. 11.56 (Mitachi
et al., 1998). Installing a small motor (pony motor driven by battery, if possible) to
the fuel salt pump is effective, as is demonstrated in the Japanese FBR “Monju.”
11.5.3.2.2
Pump seizure accident
If the pump shaft is stuck, a more severe situation than the above pump trip accident
occurs. Because fuel salt flow becomes almost zero in a short time, and core-cooling
function is lost, the fuel salt temperature increases. Therefore, numerical evaluation is
required. Based on the preliminary evaluation for all fuel salt pumps seizure accident,
even if control rods are not scrammed, maximum fuel salt temperature reaches about
900C after 300 seconds, as is shown in Fig. 11.57 (Shimazu, 1978a). In the actual
case that control rods are scrammed, the consequence will be milder than this result. If
this happens in all fuel salt pumps, the fuel salt must be drained to a drain tank.
11.5.3.2.3
Flow blockage accident
If blockage occurs anywhere in the primary loops, fuel salt flow stops. The conse-
quence is similar to a pump trip/seizure accident. Total mechanical blockage is
incredible, and in the case that 20 flow channels are blocked among totally 100
flow channels, the result is shown in Fig. 11.58 (Yamamoto et al., 2005). Another
possible cause may be fuel salt freeze accident, which is discussed later.
11.5.3.2.4
Loss of secondary salt cooling accident
If a secondary salt pump trips or pump seizure occurs, the fuel salt is not cooled,
and then the fuel salt temperature increases. In some severe cases, the fuel salt must

be drained to a drain tank. Loss of secondary salt cooling will occur in other scenar-
ios, such as rupture or break of the secondary salt loop, or SG loop failure, and then
the same situation will occur.
11.5.3.2.5
Loss of decay heat cooling accident (in core)
After the reactor is shut down, the fuel salt must be cooled, because it has decay
heat. This function is required in any cases, as long as the fuel salt stays in the
core. Therefore, an appropriate decay heat cooling system must be equipped, unless
fuel salt is not drained. As is shown in Fig. 11.56, the natural circulation can be uti-
lized for this purpose.

11.5.3.2.6
Loss of decay heat cooling accident (in drain tank)
If fuel salt is drained to a drain tank, the fuel salt must be cooled there. Therefore,
cooling function must be provided for a drain tank. The MSBR proposed a passive
cooling system for the drain tank (Robertson, 1971).
11.5.3.3
Fuel salt leak accident
11.5.3.3.1
Primary loop break accident
If rupture or break of primary loop boundary such as vessel, pipes, pumps, HXs
occurs for some reason, then the integrity of the primary loop boundary is lost, and
the fuel salt will leak out. Of course, leaked salt is caught by a catch-pan, and col-
lected in a drain tank or an emergency drain tank without passing a freeze valve, as
is shown in Fig. 11.59 (Robertson, 1971). Regarding the rupture of the HX, mixing
of the fuel salt and secondary salt must be evaluated. The causes of these accidents
may be a manufacturing flaw, excessive increase of boundary temperature, pressure
increase by sudden boiling, corrosion, thermal stress cycling, and so on.
11.5.3.4
Other accidents
11.5.3.4.1
Steam-generator break accident
As is described at first, the vapor pressure of the molten salt is very low, and an
overpressure accident is incredible. The only one exception is a SG break accident.
The MSR uses a supercritical SG, and its pressure is about 25 MPa, and higher than
Figure 11.59 Freeze valve and drain tank in MSBR (Robertson, 1971).
347
Liquid fuel, thermal neutron spectrum reactors

the LWR case of about 7 MPa. If the SG breaks, this high-pressure steam is injected
into the secondary loop. In order to avoid the propagation to the primary loop,
appropriate protection systems must be equipped, such as an isolation valve or rup-
ture disc.
11.5.3.4.2
Recriticality accident in drain tank
Since there is no graphite as a neutron moderator in a drain tank, a recriticality acci-
dent is incredible. A possible cause may be isolation or precipitation of fissile
material.
11.5.3.4.3
Fuel salt freeze accident
The volume of frozen fuel salt (at 20C) is about 15% lower than that of molten
fuel salt (at 600C), mostly due to the thermal expansion property of fuel salt. For
example, the formula for the density of typical fuel salt is [3.628 g/cc 2 0.00066 3
Temp (C)] (Cantor, 1968). Therefore, even if freezing occurs, it does not cause
pipe break. Also, since the primary loop is within the HTC (see Figs. 11.59 and
11.62), which is heated higher than freezing temperature of fuel salt, fuel salt freez-
ing is incredible to occur. Of course, malfunction of the heating system at HTC is
to be considered, although this event will be gradual.
The most probable scenario is fuel salt freezing at the HX, because the inlet tem-
perature of secondary salt (c. 450C) is lower than the freezing temperature of the
fuel salt (c. 500C). If one of the fuel salt pumps stops but the secondary salt pump
does not stop, then fuel salt is overcooled, and starts freezing at the HX (a kind of
“overcool” accident). This situation is similar to the above flow blockage accident.
In some cases, the fuel salt must be drained to a drain tank. However, opening
the freeze valve may take 510 minutes, if there is no heater to hasten melting of
fuel salt at the freeze valve. Therefore, faster mechanical valve or rupture disc may
be required. Salt freezing may occur at the drain tank, as is shown in Fig. 11.60
(Williams, 1999).
Figure 11.60 Frozen salt (FLiBe in the MSRE tank) (Williams, 1999).
348
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

11.5.3.4.4
Secondary salt freeze accident
An accident similar to the fuel salt freeze accident (see above) may occur in the
secondary loop. If the reactor is shut down and its power decreases, but the SG
does not stop, then secondary salt is overcooled and will freeze (a kind of “over-
cool” accident). The actual consequence must be evaluated, and in some severe
cases fuel salt must be drained to a drain tank.
11.5.3.4.5
Remelt accident
The volume of molten fuel salt (at 600C) is about 15% higher than that of a solid
one (at 20C), mostly due to thermal expansion of fuel salt (Cantor, 1968).
Therefore, careful remelting is required to avoid unexpected pressure/stress increase
in pipes or in tanks. This may happen on secondary salt loops too. Therefore, safety
design must be described in the safety report for licensing.
11.5.3.4.6
Freeze valve failure accident
Opening the freeze valve is just to switch off a valve cooling system. Therefore, the
failure probability of the freeze valve is very low, but it is not zero. Since the freeze
valve is the last countermeasure to keep the integrity of primary loop boundary,
some verification is required, and/or faster mechanical valve or rupture disc may be
required.
11.5.3.4.7
Graphite fire accident
It is incredible that graphite fire occurs in the MSR. Because reactor-grade graphite
has a high density it does not burn without continuous external heat. In the MSR,
there is no heat source near the graphite, after the fuel salt is transferred to a drain/
emergency tank. Also, there is no oxygen within the reactor vessel and contain-
ment, because it is filled with inert gas.
11.5.3.4.8
Wigner effect accident
Another cause of graphite fire is known as the Wigner effect, which was discovered
by Eugene P. Wigner (the first research director of ORNL), and the Windscale fire
accident occurred in 1957 (Windscale fire, 2015). However, the Wigner effect
occurs only at low-temperature operation (, 200C), and the MSR operates at
higher temperature ( . 500C) than this effect. Therefore, there is no possibility of
a Windscale-type fire.
11.5.3.4.9
Off-gas system failure accident
Gaseous fission products (FP) such as xenon/krypton/tritium, as shown in
Table 11.12 (Robertson, 1971), are removed from fuel salt and collected in normal
operation of the MSR. Therefore, it must be confirmed which FPs will be collected
by the FP gas removal system, and these FPs must be confined in secure tanks for
sufficient decay periods.
11.5.3.4.10
Reactor oscillation accident
Safety guidelines require that the reactor can be operated with enough stability,
because reactor oscillation may occur even if the reactivity coefficient is negative.
349
Liquid fuel, thermal neutron spectrum reactors

One example is xenon oscillations in a PWR (Iodine Pit Issue, 2015), and another
is flow instability in a BWR (US-NRC, 1988).
Gaseous FPs such as Xe/Kr are always removed from the core in the MSR, and
xenon oscillations do not occur.
A preliminary study on MSR controllability, which is shown in Fig. 11.61, sug-
gests that the core can be stabilized within several minutes, when reactor power is
changed by core flow from 100% to 50/75/125/150% (Yamamoto et al., 2006a).
However, wider analysis must be performed based on reactor control design.
11.5.3.4.11
Fuel salt or beryllium release accident
Any radioactive isotopes in fuel salt are toxic to human health, and also beryllium
(Be) in fuel salt has chemical toxicity. As was explained above (primary loop break
accident), if there is a leak of fuel salt, it is collected in a drain tank, and finally it
freezes (solidifies) to a glassy material. In any case, the fuel salt will be confined
within the containment. Therefore, release of radioactive elements of fuel salt or Be
to outside of the RB is incredible, but it must be confirmed.

11.5.3.4.12
Rupture of containment accident
MSR has three-level containment safety, as proposed in the MSBR design and
shown in Fig. 11.62 (Furukawa et al., 2008; Yoshioka, 2013).
1. The first level is a reactor vessel and pipes made of Hastelloy N.
2. The second level is a HTC composed of three layers, which contains a reactor vessel,
pipes, and HXs.
3. The third level is a RB composed of two layers.
In any of the above accidents, HTC and RB prevent or mitigate radioactivity
release. Based on the above scenarios, loss of HTC/RB integrity is incredible, but
possible damages on HTC/RB must be evaluated in each accident analysis. As is
explained in Section 11.5.2, HTC and RB are identified as a part of the MS, whose
failure does not initiate an accident, but its mitigation capability must be evaluated.
11.5.3.4.13
Source term issue
The source term issue is considered to be not required in the MSR at this moment
because of the following reason.
Based on the NRC definition, “source term” is “Types and amounts of radioac-
tive or hazardous material released to the environment following an accident.” In
order to evaluate the source term, it is necessary to assume in the accident scenarios
how the radioactive materials in nuclear fuel are discharged to outside of the reac-
tor. For example, types of radioactive materials if they are gas or solid, or liquid,
initiating events of accidents, effectiveness of defense barriers, MSs, and so on,
must be assumed. In LWRs, some amount of radioactive material is discharged to
the environment in DBAs, and large amounts of radioactive materials are dis-
charged in SA (Soffer et al., 1995).
In the MSR, there will be no release of radioactive materials to the environment
in DBAs, except the failure accident of an off-gas system. Based on the above
Figure 11.62 Containment function of the MSR (part of Fig. 11.32).
351
Liquid fuel, thermal neutron spectrum reactors

preliminary evaluations for internal cause accidents such as a pipe break accident,
rupture of containment is incredible to occur, and hence there will be no release of
radioactive material to the environment in DBAs.
As for the “station blackout” (loss of all AC electric power), passive cooling sys-
tem, which does not need electricity, is proposed for drain tank cooling (Robertson,
1971; Ishiguro et al., 2014).
As a result, simultaneous loss of cooling function and containment function will
not occur in the MSR, except by severe external causes. In current LWR licensing,
these external cause accidents by terrorism or missiles are categorized as SA, and
the only requirement as DBA is the aircraft attack consideration (see Item 92 of
Section 11.6). Since this section describes only AOT and DBA and does not refer
SA, it is not required to include the source term issue in DBA for the MSR.
Although the source term issue is not required at this moment, a preliminary
prospect on simultaneous loss of both the cooling function and the containment
function is discussed in this section, because unfortunately this happened at the
Fukushima accident in 2011.
In the MSR, since gaseous FPs such as Xe and Kr are always removed from the
fuel salt, instantaneous release of radioactive materials will not occur even with
simultaneous failure of reactor vessels/pipes and containment. In this scenario, the
fuel salt is liquid, and most of the radioactive materials will stay within the fuel salt
in ionic form, but their behavior must be confirmed. Some of them, such as iodine
and cesium, which were dominant source terms at the Fukushima accident, are
described in the ORNL report (Haubenreich and Engel, 1962). After decay heat
decreases, fuel salt solidifies and all radioactive materials will be confined.
In this section, online reprocessing is not adopted, but if it is included in the
design, the above discussion must include its safety, as is discussed in Gat et al.
(1993).
11.5.4
Summary
In order to perform the MSR accident analysis and to establish guidelines for this
analysis, the authors showed 40 possible accidents for the MSR. They were classi-
fied as external cause accidents and internal cause accidents. We investigated the
internal ones and categorized them into four types: power excursion accident, flow
decrease accident, fuel salt leak accident, and other accidents mostly specific to the
MSR. Each accident was described briefly with some numerical results. In several
accidental scenarios, fuel salt must be transferred to a drain tank, and this system
assures high safety of the MSR. However, its consequence depends on the freeze
valve function, because its operation is slow, and this means that some verification
is required. Also, some other accidents need quantitative evaluation. As for the
source term issue, it is not required to be included at the moment, but a preliminary
prospect for future study was discussed.
These results may be varied for different designs, and should be improved
depending on the progress of design. Also, PRA is required at the detail design
stage (US-NRC, 2014c).
352
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

After completion of these evaluations it can be concluded that the MSR has
superior safety, and that the MSR has an intrinsic safety (Yoshioka et al., 2014).
11.6
General design criteria for MSR design
This GDC document is a draft of safety guidelines for MSR design, and it is not
authorized yet. This GDC is based on the current GDC draft for FHR, which is
modified from the GDC for LWR. The GDC for FHR is now being established in
the framework of the American Nuclear Society (Flanagan, 2012; ANS 20.1 work-
ing group, 2014). We are proposing the following GDC for MSR, but these provi-
sions will be revised in the future. Especially the italic part of the following
provisions are modified or added by the authors for the MSR or for recent licensing
requirements/movements. MSR safety shall be designed based on the following pro-
visions, where “shall” means mandatory requirement by the licensing authority, and
“should” means recommendations and voluntary for licensing applicants.
11.6.1
Overall requirements
1. Quality standards and records
Structures, systems, and components (SSCs) important to safety shall be designed,
fabricated, erected, and tested to quality standards commensurate with the impor-
tance of the safety functions to be performed. Where generally recognized codes
and standards are used, they shall be identified and evaluated to determine their
applicability, adequacy, and sufficiency and shall be supplemented or modified as
necessary to assure a quality product in keeping with the required safety function.
A quality assurance program shall be established and implemented in order to pro-
vide adequate assurance that these SSCs will satisfactorily perform their safety
functions. Appropriate records of the design, fabrication, erection, and testing of
SSCs important to safety shall be maintained by or under the control of the nuclear
power unit licensee throughout the life of the unit.
2. Design bases for protection against natural phenomena
SSCs important to safety shall be designed to withstand the effects of natural phe-
nomena such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, fires, floods, tsunami, and
seiches without loss of capability to perform their safety functions. The design
bases for these SSCs shall reflect: (1) Appropriate consideration of the most severe
of the natural phenomena that have been historically reported for the site and sur-
rounding area, with sufficient margin for the limited accuracy, quantity, and period
of time in which the historical data have been accumulated, (2) appropriate combi-
nations of the effects of normal and accident conditions with the effects of the natu-
ral phenomena and (3) the importance of the safety functions to be performed.
353
Liquid fuel, thermal neutron spectrum reactors

As for the earthquake, the maximum earthquake shall be estimated not only by
historic data but also by possible future prediction. Tsunami shall be evaluated
based on these evaluations.
3. Fire protection
SSCs important to safety shall be designed and located to minimize, consistent with
other safety requirements, the probability and effect of fires and explosions.
Noncombustible and heat-resistant materials shall be used wherever practical
throughout the unit, particularly in locations such as the containment and control
room. Fire detection and fighting systems of appropriate capacity and capability shall
be provided and designed to minimize the adverse effects of fires on SSCs important
to safety. Firefighting systems shall be designed to assure that their rupture or inad-
vertent operation does not significantly impair the safety capability of these SSCs.
If graphite is used in the reactor, protection against graphite fire shall be
considered.
4. Environmental and dynamic effects design bases
SSCs important to safety shall be designed to accommodate the effects of and to be
compatible with the environmental conditions associated with normal operation,
maintenance, testing, and postulated accidents. These SSCs shall be appropriately
protected against dynamic effects, including the effects of missiles, pipe whipping,
and discharging fluids, that may result from equipment failures and from events
and conditions outside the nuclear power unit. However, dynamic effects associated
with postulated pipe ruptures in nuclear power units may be excluded from the
design basis when analyses reviewed and approved by the NRC demonstrate that
the probability of fluid system piping rupture is extremely low under conditions
consistent with the design basis for the piping.
5. Sharing of structures, systems, and components
SSCs important to safety shall not be shared among nuclear power units unless it
can be shown that such sharing will not significantly impair their ability to perform
their safety functions, including, in the event of an accident in one unit, an orderly
shutdown and cooldown of the remaining units.
11.6.2
Protection by multiple fission product barriers
10. Reactor design
The reactor core and associated coolant, control, and protection systems shall be
designed with appropriate margin to assure that specified acceptable fuel design
limits are not exceeded during any condition of normal operation, and in anticipated
operational occurrences (AOOs).
354
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

The above acceptable fuel design limits shall be determined as the limits, below
which fuel failure does not occur. In this process, statistical evaluation can be used.
The reactor core shall maintain both shutdown capability and coolable geome-
try, during normal operation, AOOs, and DBAs.
11. Reactor inherent protection
The reactor core and associated systems that contribute to reactivity feedback shall
be designed so that in any operating range the net effect of the prompt inherent
nuclear feedback characteristics tends to compensate for a rapid increase in
reactivity.
12. Suppression of reactor power oscillations
The reactor core and associated coolant, control, and protection systems shall be
designed to assure that power oscillations which can result in conditions exceeding
specified acceptable fuel design limits are not possible or can be reliably and read-
ily detected and suppressed.
13. Instrumentation and control
Instrumentation shall be provided to monitor variables and systems over their antici-
pated ranges for normal operation, for AOOs, and for accident conditions as appropri-
ate to assure adequate safety, including those variables and systems that can affect the
fission process, the integrity of the reactor core, the reactor coolant pressure bound-
ary, and the containment and its associated systems. Appropriate controls shall be
provided to maintain these variables and systems within prescribed operating ranges.
14. Reactor primary coolant boundary
The reactor primary coolant boundary shall be designed, fabricated, erected, and
tested so as to have an extremely low probability of abnormal leakage, of rapidly
propagating failure, and of gross rupture.
In addition, if the reactor is equipped with a drain tank connecting to reactor
coolant, then the drain tank and connecting pipes shall be regarded as reactor
coolant boundary.
15. Reactor primary coolant system design
The reactor primary coolant system and associated auxiliary, control, and protection
systems shall be designed with sufficient margin to assure that the design conditions
of the reactor primary coolant boundary are not exceeded during any condition of
normal operation, including AOOs.
16. Containment design
No. 16 is not used, because containment design is described at No. 5055 in detail.
355
Liquid fuel, thermal neutron spectrum reactors

17. Electric power systems
An onsite electric power system and an offsite electric power system shall be pro-
vided, if required, to permit functioning of safety-related SSCs. The nuclear safety
function for each system (assuming the other system is not functioning) shall be to
provide sufficient capacity and capability to assure that (1) specified acceptable fuel
design limits and design conditions of the reactor coolant boundary are not exceeded
as a result of AOOs and (2) the core is cooled and containment integrity and other
safety-related vital functions are maintained in the event of postulated accidents.
If onsite electric power supplies, including the batteries, and the onsite electric
distribution system, are required to permit functioning of safety-related SSCs, they
shall have sufficient independence, redundancy, and testability to perform their
nuclear safety functions assuming a single failure.
If electric power from the transmission network to the onsite electric distribution
system is required to permit functioning of safety-related SSCs, it shall be supplied
by two physically independent circuits (not necessarily on separate rights of way)
designed and located so as to minimize to the extent practical the likelihood of their
simultaneous failure under operating and postulated accident and environmental
conditions. A switchyard common to both circuits is acceptable. Each of these cir-
cuits shall be designed to be available in sufficient time following a loss of all
onsite alternating current power supplies and the other offsite electric power circuit,
to assure that specified acceptable fuel design limits and design conditions of the
reactor coolant boundary are not exceeded, and that other safety-related functions
are maintained.
Provisions shall be included to minimize the probability of losing electric power
from any of the remaining supplies as a result of, or coincident with, the loss of
power generated by the nuclear power unit, the loss of power from the transmission
network, or the loss of power from the onsite electric power supplies.
18. Inspection and testing of electric power systems
Electric power systems important to safety shall be designed to permit appropriate
periodic inspection and testing of important areas and features, such as wiring, insu-
lation, connections, and switchboards, to assess the continuity of the systems and
the condition of their components. The systems shall be designed with a capability
to test periodically (1) the operability and functional performance of the compo-
nents of the systems, such as onsite power sources, relays, switches, and buses, and
(2) the operability of the systems as a whole and, under conditions as close to
design as practical, the full operation sequence that brings the systems into opera-
tion, including operation of applicable portions of the protection system, and the
transfer of power among systems.
19. Control room
A control room shall be provided from which actions can be taken to operate the
nuclear power unit safely under normal conditions and to maintain it in a safe
356
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

condition under accident conditions. Adequate radiation protection shall be pro-
vided to permit access and occupancy of the control room under accident conditions
without personnel receiving radiation exposures in excess of 5 rem total effective
dose equivalent (TEDE), for the duration of the accident.
Adequate habitability measures shall be provided to permit access and occu-
pancy of the control room during normal operations and under accident conditions.

of appropriate systems including the reactivity control systems, to assure that speci-
fied acceptable fuel design limits are not exceeded as a result of AOOs and (2) to
sense accident conditions and to initiate the operation of systems and components
important to safety.
21. Protection system reliability and testability
The protection system shall be designed for high functional reliability and inservice
testability commensurate with the safety functions to be performed. Redundancy
and independence designed into the protection system shall be sufficient to assure
that (1) no single failure results in loss of the protection function and (2) removal
from service of any component or channel does not result in loss of the required
minimum redundancy unless the acceptable reliability of operation of the protection
system can be otherwise demonstrated. The protection system shall be designed to

nomena, and of normal operating, maintenance, testing, and postulated accident
conditions on redundant channels do not result in loss of the protection function, or
shall be demonstrated to be acceptable on some other defined basis. Design techni-
ques, such as functional diversity or diversity in component design and principles
of operation, shall be used to the extent practical to prevent loss of the protection
function.

The protection system shall be designed to fail into a safe state or into a state dem-
onstrated to be acceptable on some other defined basis if conditions such as discon-
nection of the system, loss of energy (e.g., electric power, instrument air), or

water, and radiation) are experienced.
24. Separation of protection and control systems
The protection system shall be separated from control systems to the extent that
failure of any single control system component or channel, or failure or removal
from service of any single protection system component or channel which is com-
mon to the control and protection systems leaves intact a system satisfying all reli-
ability, redundancy, and independence requirements of the protection system.

failure or of single operator error, such as accidental withdrawal (not ejection or
dropout) of control rods.

burnout) to assure acceptable fuel design limits are not exceeded. One of the sys-
tems shall be capable of holding the reactor core subcritical under cold conditions.

The reactivity control systems shall be designed with appropriate limits on the
potential amount and rate of reactivity increase to assure that the effects of postu-
lated reactivity accidents can neither (1) result in damage to the reactor primary
coolant boundary greater than limited local yielding nor (2) sufficiently disturb the
core, its support structures, or other reactor vessel internals to impair significantly
the capability to cool the core. These postulated reactivity accidents shall include
consideration of control rod ejection (unless prevented by positive means), changes
in reactor coolant temperature, and changes in power/flow rates.

tal data available for defining accident phenomena and containment responses, and
(3) the conservatism of the calculational model and input parameters.

The boundary of the reactor containment structure shall be designed with sufficient
margin to assure that under operating, maintenance, testing, and postulated accident

or flow-induced vibration) to ensure that the integrity of structures and equipment
performance remains consistent with the assumptions in the safety analysis.
81. Human factors
A Human Factors Engineering (HFE) program shall be developed and implemented
for the duration of the plant life. To ensure adequate quality of the HFE products,
the program should plan the HFE effort, develop HFE requirements, and integrate
key expertise, accepted state-of-the-art HFE principles, lessons learned from practi-
cal experience, and accepted validation and verification procedures and testing. The
HFE program should ensure that (1) the role of personnel and automation is well
defined and supports plant reliability and safety performance requirements; (2) the
requirements for human task performance are clearly specified; (3) the numbers of
staff, their functions, and qualifications are adequate to fulfill the role of personnel;
(4) the working environments (i.e., control rooms and local workstations), user
interfaces (i.e., alarms, displays, controls, procedures, and other task aids), and per-
sonnel training meet task performance requirements and are designed to be consis-
tent with human cognitive and physiological characteristics, and (5) the safety of
the facility is not adversely affected by human interaction with key design features.

tical, with safety and security being considered in an integrated fashion such that
design and operational decisions are made in consideration of the impact each has
on the other.
Design considerations shall include:
G
Use of designs and layouts with proper attention to defense-in-depth principles to mini-
mize the likelihood and consequences of malicious acts;
G
Designing the layout of safety-related buildings and equipment to facilitate controlling
access;
G
Providing multiple layers of protection such that physical protection is not dependent
upon a single design, operational, or physical security measure;

status for this event.
For station blackout, either (1) a means to maintain containment pressure and tem-
perature shall be provided or (2) measures to mitigate loss of the system safety func-
tion shall be provided. An acceptable means to prevent loss of the containment safety
function is to assure that containment design leakage rate is not exceeded in the event

93. Severe accidents
Severe accident is becoming a mandatory requirement.
Diverse and redundant active systems and/or passive design features should be
provided to prevent accidents from escalating into SA with extensive core damage
and/or significant FP release into the environment.
Countermeasures or features should be incorporated in the plant design to miti-
gate the accident severity in the event of the disability or failure of the plant safety
368
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

systems. Consideration shall be given in the containment design for the provision
of features to mitigate the consequences of SA in order to limit the release of radio-
active material to the environment.
The reactor should also be designed to prevent large early release of radioactive
material into the environment as a result of earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes,
floods, fires, tsunami, and seiches, whose severity and occurrence frequencies are
technically and historically nonnegligible but beyond the design basis.
11.6.10
Several definitions
Anticipated Operational Occurrences (AOOs):
The events, which are initiated by single active component failure or single operator
error, and are expected to occur at least once in the plant lifecycle.
Anticipated Transient Without Scram (ATWS):
ATWS is one of the “worst case” accidents, consideration of which frequently moti-
vates the NRC to take regulatory action. Such an accident could happen if the scram sys-
tem fails to work during an anticipated transient.
Beyond Design-Basis Accidents (B-DBA):
B-DBA is used as a technical way to discuss accident sequences that are possible but
were not fully considered in the design process because they were judged to be too
unlikely.
Design Basis Accidents (DBA):
Postulated accidents that a nuclear facility must be designed and built to withstand
without loss of the SSCs necessary to assure public health and safety. DBAs are used to
establish performance requirements of safety-related SSCs.
Station Blackout (SBO):
SBO means the complete loss of alternating current (AC) electric power to the essen-
tial and nonessential switchgear buses in a nuclear power plant.
Severe Accident:
A type of accident that may challenge safety systems at a level much higher than
expected.
11.6.11
Conclusion
MSR safety shall be designed based on the above GDC. This GDC is based on
the current GDC draft for a FHR, which is modified from the GDC for LWR. The
above GDC is a draft of safety guidelines for the MSR design proposed by the
authors, and will be revised in the future.

Four concepts of the fast molten salt reactor are known today. Two of them use
ThU fuel and carrier salts LiFBeF2 and LiFNaFBeF2 (over 10 years’ develop-
ment); the others use UPu fuel and carrier salts LiFNaFKF (3 years’ develop-
ment) and NaFKF (1 year). The fast neutron spectrum MSR has definite advantages
in comparison with thermal MSR, especially for long-lived nuclear waste incineration
and nuclear breeding. To realize these advantages extended research programs are
needed, including neutronics and thermo-hydraulic calculations, physics and chemistry
of molten salts, development of a closed nuclear fuel cycle, new construction materials

resistant to corrosion, and fast neutron radiation, etc. The advantages of the fast MSRs
are so important that these efforts are worthwhile.
12.1
Carrier salt for the fast molten-salt reactor
12.1.1
Introduction
The choice of the carrier salt for MSR was the subject of the many research studies
since the MSRE experience (the last one is the program ALISIA, Benes et al., 2009).
The molten fluorides of the alkaline and the alkaline-earth elements (Li, Be, Na, K,
etc.) are usually used as the carrier salts. They should meet the numerous requirements:
G
Low melting temperature;
G
Low neutron absorption;
G
Low corrosive activity;
G
High heat capacity and conductivity;
G
Low viscosity;
G
Low cost and toxicity;
G
High solubility of the actinide and lanthanide fluorides.
The last property is necessary for MSRs with fast neutron spectrum
12.1.2
Physical properties of the fluoride carrier salts
The properties of the most commonly known fluoride salts are presented in
Table 12.1. All these properties are important, because the fuel compositions are used
not only as nuclear fuel, but also as the heat transfer agent at the same time. Because
the MSR operating temperature range is limited to 550700C, the salts with melting
temperature Tm,550C only are included in Table 12.1. The characteristics of the
usual heat transfer agents (H2O, Na, Pb, Pb-Bi) are presented for the comparison.
12.1.3
The solubility of the actinide and lanthanide fluorides
in the fluoride molten salts
The solubility of the actinide and lanthanide fluorides in the fluoride salts is the key
point in the carrier salt choice for the fast molten salt reactor. The MSR fuel com-
position (FC) consists of the carrier salt, the fissile and raw actinide fluorides, the
minor actinide and fission product fluorides, etc. To provide the fast neutron spec-
trum, the FC should contain B20 at.% of the heavy elements (Merle-Lucotte,
2013). Several fluoride carrier salts have high solubility of ThF4 and UF4
(LiFBeF2, LiFNaFBeF2, etc.) and they can be used not only both in thermal
reactors with ThU fuel cycle like MSRE/MSBR (Haubenrich Engel, 1970; Merk
and Konheiser, 2014) and fast/intermediate neutron spectrum (Holcomb et al.,
2011, Merle-Lucotte et al., 2013, Ignatiev et al., 2012b). However, until recently
the PuF3 solubility in all the known salts did not exceed 6 mol% (Table 12.2).

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

Recently it was found that in the eutectic 46.5LiF11.5NaF42.0KF (FLiNaK)
the solubility of UF4, PuF3, and AmF3 reaches B45, B30, and B40 mol% respec-
tively at 700C (Lizin et al., 2013a,b; Volozhin et al., 2013). This observation opens
the way for the development of the fast molten salt reactor with UPu fuel cycle
(Degtyarev and Ponomarev, 2012; Degtyarev et al., 2015) as well as the effective
Am incinerator (Degtyarev et al., 2013).
12.1.3.1
Molten salts based on LiF and NaF
According to the fusion diagram of LiFPuF3 the PuF3 solubility in LiF may be
estimated as 2040 mol% within the temperature range of 7501000C. In
NaFPuF3 melts similar estimations give the solubility value of 2540 mol% in
the temperature range 730850C (Barton et al., 1960). The addition of BeF2 into
LiF suppress the PuF3 solubility almost by an order of magnitude: in LiFBeF2 the
PuF3 solubility in the temperature range of 500700C varies from 0.1 to 1.0 mol
% (Barton, 1960). The addition of ZrF4 into NaF produces the effect similar in
magnitude (Ponomarev et al., 2013).
The addition of ThF4 into LiF also decreases the PuF3 solubility (in comparison
with pure LiF) but less than the addition of BeF2. For example, in the molten salt
80LiF20ThF4 the PuF3 solubility varies from 4 to 10 mol% within the tempera-
ture range of 600800C. The addition of UF4 has much the same effect on the
PuF3 solubility as in case of ThF4 addition (Barton et al., 1960).
12.1.3.2
Salt system LiFBeF2
The PuF3 solubility in the most studied system, LiFBeF2 varies from 0.2 to
1.4 mol% within the temperature range of 500700C depending on the salt com-
position (Barton et al., 1958a).
The compositions in which LiF is partially replaced with NaF are similar to the
LiFBeF2 physical and chemical properties, but in this case the tritium generation
in (n,α)-reaction on the 6Li is suppressed and the PuF3 solubility increases about
threefold. The important advantage of LiFBeF2 melts with different content of
LiF and BeF2 components is the high solubility of UF4 and ThF4 which are the
main fissile (233U) and raw (232Th) materials in the ThU fuel cycle. The early
measurements (Thoma, 1959) and later theoretical estimations (Van der Meer et al.,
2006; Benes and Konings, 2009) based on the fusion diagrams of LiFBeF2AnF4
confirm that the solubility of UF4 and ThF4 is 2030 mol% at the fuel composition
temperature 500700C and the pressure of saturated vapors does not exceed 10 Pa
(Rosenthal et al., 1972). The high solubility of UF4 and ThF4 creates the good pre-
conditions for using LiFBeF2 salt in the thermal reactors with ThU fuel and in
the fast breeder reactors (Merle-Lucotte, 2013).
It has been shown (Barton and Strehlow, 1958; Barton et al., 1958b) that the
addition of CeF3 into eutectic 67LiF33BeF2 decreases significantly the solubility
of PuF3: the larger the fraction of CeF3 entered into the system, the more PuF3 solu-
bility is decreased. The addition of ThF4 increases the PuF3 solubility up to
379
Fast-spectrum, liquid-fueled reactors

described by liner function log S 5 A 1 B/T (Ignatiev et al., 2003).
The CeF3 solubility as the chemical analog of PuF3 solubility S is described by
many authors (Barton et al., 1970; Iyer et al., 1973a; Naumov et al., 1996). It has
been established that the solubilities of CeF3 and PuF3, are very similar and differ

of the CeF3 solubility are presented. The total or partial replacement of BeF2 with
ThF4 increases the CeF3 solubility by 30%90%.
The temperature dependencies of the molar solubility S (Fig. 12.3) within the
range of 600800C are well described by linear functions log S 5 A 1 B/T. Later
work (Iyer et al., 1973a) demonstrates a good correlation with these results.

Salt System LiFBeF2ZrF4
The CeF3 solubility in 65LiF30BeF25ZrF4 at 550625700C is equal 1.01,
1.98, and 3.04 mol%, respectively (Naumov et al., 1996).
The solubility of the other lanthanide fluorides (Table 12.4) is also studied in the
salt 65LiF30BeF25ZrF4 which was proposed as the solvent for ADTT plant
(Naumov et al., 1996).
The solubility data for LnF3, (Ln 5 Y, Sm, Ce, La) in the salts 62.8LiF
36.4BeF20.8UF4 and 50NaF46ZrF44UF4 (Barton et al., 1960) are presented in
Table 12.5.
The influence of the lanthanide atomic number on the lanthanide fluoride sol-
ubility has been demonstrated with the salt 62.8LiF36.4BeF20.8UF4 (Barton
and
Strehlow,
1958)
where
the

is
increased
by
a

decreasing ionic radius.

The salt 52NaF48ZrF4 is comparable or slightly higher in the fluoride solubil-
ity as LiFBeF2 but less toxic and corrosive, but its disadvantage is a high volatil-
ity of ZrF4 vapors that results in formation of zirconium tetrafluoride deposit in
MSR communications (Souˇcek et al., 2005).

special requirements imposed to fuel salt of MSR launch load with cavity-type reac-
tor core (Ignatiev et al., 2014) where the fraction of heavy metal tetrafluorides is
essential (22 and 27.5 mol%, respectively).
The joint solubility of CeF3 and PuF3 increases with temperature and decreases
with increasing UF4 and ThF4. Similar behavior is observed at the PuF3 solubility
in LiFThF4 with the same fraction (2227 mol%) of thorium tetrafluoride
(Ignatiev et al., 2014).

Salt system 46.5 LiF11.5 NaF42.0 KF (FLiNaK)
The fusion diagram of LiFNaFKF system was obtained first by Bergmann and
Dergunov (1941). This system has the single eutectic 0.465LiF0.115 NaF0.420KF
(FLiNaK) with the melting temperature Tm 5 454C (Janz et al., 1974). The later
experimental works confirmed these results (Williams et al., 2006).
The eutectic salt composition 46.5LiF11.5NaF42.0KF mol% (FLiNaK) was
considered earlier as perspective coolant for the fast nuclear reactors (Williams
et al., 2006) and the hybrid fusionfission systems. The theoretical estimations
(Benes and Konings, 2008) and experiments (Lizin et al., 2013a,b; Volozhin et al.,
2013) have demonstrated also the extremely high solubility of PuF3, UF4, ThF4,
and AmF3 as well as the lanthanide fluorides (Ponomarev et al., 2013). These mea-
surements attracted the special attention to this salt.
The data on the solubility of UF4, ThF4, and AmF3 in FLiNaK are presented in
Table 12.10.
PuF3 and AmF3 solubility have been studied using the isothermal saturation
(Lizin et al., 2013a,b) and local γ-spectrometry (Volozhin et al., 2013) methods
(Tables 12.11 and 12.12). The AmF3 solubility is even higher than the PuF3
solubility.
The PuF3 solubility is presented in Table 12.11. The values measured by two
groups coincided in the range 600700C within the experiment errors (B10%)
and close to the theoretical estimates (Benes and Konings, 2008).
It is well known (Barton et al., 1970) that CeF3 solubility in various salts is simi-
lar to PuF3 solubility. The measurements of CeF3 solubility in FLiNaK confirm this
survey (Table 12.12).

Joint solubility of PuF3 and UF4 in FLiNaK, important for the fast MSR opera-
tion, was measured by Lizin et al. (2015b).
It is evident from Table 12.13 that the joint presence of UF4 and PuF3 in
FLiNaK results in essential decreasing of their individual solubility: at 600C the
individual solubility of PuF3 and UF4 is 11.1 and 24.6 mol%, respectively, but their
joint solubility is only 2.9 and 3.5 mol%. The total solubility of PuF3 and UF4 in
the mixture is comparable with the individual PuF3 and UF4 solubility and this dif-
ference decreases with increasing temperature.
The measured solubility of LaF3, NdF3, CeF3, and PrF3 in FLiNaK are presented
in Table 12.14. These results are important for the organization of the MSR closed
fuel cycle and the MSR fuel composition feeding and cleaning.
Particularly, such a high solubility of the lanthanide fluorides in the fuel compo-
sition facilitates can increase in the intervals between the fuel cleaning operations
from the neutron poisons.
The high PuF3 and UF4 solubility in FLiNaK open at first the way for the devel-
opment of the fast MSR and UPu fuel cycle (Ponomarev et al., 2013; Degtyarev
et al., 2015).

The other essential fluoride molten-salt properties
The main physical, chemical, and nuclear characteristics of the most commonly
known fluoride molten salts are presented in Table 12.1. The fluoride molten salts
have satisfactory heat capacity and conductivity as well as viscosity to effectively
remove the heat at operating temperatures (500800C) in a wide range of salt
compositions (McNeese et al., 1974, Khokhlov et al., 2009). The thermal properties
of these melts provide the high efficiency of the heat removal even in the case of

the natural circulation: the factor of the “salt-wall” heat transfer is close to that of
water, although the coefficient of the salt heat conductivity is B100 times less than
that of sodium. The molten fluorides differ in high radiation resistance and rela-
tively low corrosion activity in relation to graphite and some metal alloys.
The most studied MSR fuel composition is the salt 67LiF33BeF2 (99.995%
7Li) with the fissile (233U) and raw (232Th) isotope fluorides dissolved. The very
important advantage of LiFBeF2 melt is the high solubility of UF4 and ThF4
(B20 mol% at B600C) and the saturated vapor pressure B 10 Pa at 700C
(Rosenthal et al., 1972).
The accumulation of fission products in MSR fuel compositions up to con-
centration of 12 mol% does not change significantly their physical and chemi-
cal
properties
and
does
not
result
in
their
sedimentation.
These
fuel
compositions are acceptable as the base for MSR with ThU cycle, including
fast MSR.
The fast MSR with UPu cycle needs the high UF4 and PuF3 solubility but they
also meet a series of other requirements imposed on its physical and chemical prop-
erties: density, heat capacity and heat conductivity, corrosive activity, etc.

12.1.4.1
Viscosity
The viscosity of the molten mixtures of lithium, sodium, potassium, beryllium, alu-
minum, thorium, and uranium fluorides was studied experimentally in many works
(Cantor, 1968; Haubenreich and Engel, 1970; Janz et al., 1974; Desyatnik et al.,
1979; Smirnov et al., 1974; Desyatnik et al., 1981; Ignatiev et al., 2012a,b;
Merzlyakov et al., 2014). The method of the torsion vibration damping of the cylin-
drical crucible filled with the studied melt was used (Haubenrich and Engel, 1970;
Ignatiev et al., 2012a,b). The comparison of the experimental and estimated data at
different temperatures is given in Table 12.15.
Data on the FLiNaK dynamic viscosity are given in Table 12.15. The recent vis-
cosity data (Merzlyakov et al., 2014) are within the values published earlier by other
authors (Janz et al., 1974; Hoffman and Jones 1955; Vriesema 1979). Fig. 12.4 pre-
sents temperature dependence of dynamic viscosity for 46.5LiF11.5NaF42 KF
salt system. The addition of 5 and 10 mol% of CeF3 decreases the FLiNaK viscosity
with the temperature descent (Merzlyakov et al., 2011, Merzlyakov et al. 2014).
12.1.4.2
Corrosion of the construction materials
Since the time of the MSRE project several alloys have been tested for corrosive
properties in contact with molten fluoride salts and fission products (Rosenthal
et al., 1972; McNeese et al., 1974; Olson et al., 2009; Ignatiev et al., 2012a,b,
2014). These data demonstrate that the corrosion rate of the constructional materials
depends on the salt composition, impurities (especially Te, NiF2, FeF2, H2O, the
metal oxides, and sulfates), operation temperature, and melt flow rate, and espe-
cially Red-Ox potential of the fuel composition.
Recently it has been proposed (Olson et al., 2009; Ignatiev et al., 2012a,b, 2014)
that the nickel alloys with high heat resistance and high-temperature strength for
the MSR fuel composition at temperature up to 800C. The nickelmolybdenum
alloys niobium-doped XH80M-BЛ, aluminum-doped XH80MTЮ, tungsten-doped
XH80MTB (Ignatiev et al., 2012a,b,2014), and the special nickeltungsten alloy
EM-721 (Olson et al., 2009) have been studied.
FLiNaK corrosive activity have been studied by Olson et al. (2009). It was estab-
lished that Hastelloy-N and the alloys with high content of nickel and low content
of chromium, in particular Ni-203, are the most appropriate construction materials
within the temperature range up to 700C.
12.1.5
Conclusion
The salt compositions based on the alkaline element (Li, Na, K) fluorides have all
the necessary properties for the reliable molten salt reactor operation. Currently
available information on the molten salt properties allows us to make some recom-
mendations for the choice of the carrier salt for the fast MSR of different types.
The high solubility of the actinide and lanthanide fluorides in FLiNaK combined
with its other physical and chemical characteristics allows us to consider it as

the prospective one for the fast MSR with UPu fuel cycle (Degtyarev and
Ponomarev, 2012; Degtyarev et al., 2015). It can be used as well for MSR-burner
of minor actinides with a fast neutron spectrum (Degtyarev et al., 2013).
One more candidate carrier salt 50.4NaF21.6KF28.0UF4 was pointed out by
Hirose et al. (2015). The big advantage of this salt is the absence of Li and Be in its
composition, but it is not yet known if the PuF3 solubility in this salt is high enough
to meet the requirements necessary for the equilibrium mode reactor operation.
It is important to study this salt as a possible carrier salt for the fast molten salt
reactor with UPu fuel cycle.

Introduction
The first molten salt rector (MSR) was created in Los Alamos in 1944 and has been
used as the neutron source (Segre, 1970). However, the first successful experience
with MSR was achieved in Oak Ridge, USA, with the experimental reactor MSRE
(Haubenrich and Engel, 1970) which used the eutectics 2LiFBeF2 (FLiBe) as the
carrier salt and was in operation during almost 5 years (196569) (MacPherson,
1985).
In this experiment “the theorem of existence” has been proved: MSR can work
and be maintained. This is a very important conclusion because MSR has many
well-known preferences in comparison with the solid fuel reactors (negative void

(Klimenkov).

and temperature coefficients, low reactivity excess, no burning limits, no fuel ele-
ments, simpler closed fuel cycle, etc.).
From the early beginning MSR was oriented for ThU fuel cycle with thermal
neutron spectrum and 232Th and 233U as the row and fission isotopes, respectively. But
in the following years the nuclear community came to the conclusion that it was
impossible to solve the key problems of the nuclear power with thermal reactors only:
the resource problem, problem of the nuclear waste incineration, of the nuclear fuel
cycle closing, etc. In the last decade the MSR concept was revived (Le Blanc, 2010),
particularly there have appeared projects of the molten salt fast reactors (MSFR)
(Holcomb et al., 2011), especially on the base of the carrier salts LiFUF4 (Merle-
Lucotte, 2011, 2013), chloride salts (Mourogov et al., 2006) and reactors with interme-
diate neutron spectrum based on LiFNaFBeF2 (Ignatiev et al., 2007a,b).
The European programs (ALISIA, 2009) and (EVOL, 2012, 2013, 2015) were
developed for the choice of the appropriate carrier salts, development of the MSFR
design and its nuclear fuel cycle (Delpech et al., 2009). Particularly it was shown
that the fuel cycle of MSFR can be essentially simplified: due to the small nɣ-
cross-sections of lanthanides irradiated by fast neutrons. Because of that the fuel
composition cleaning can be performed only once in 30 years or even at the end of
the total period of MSFR operation (Matheu et al., 2009).
The main goals of these projects are minor actinide incineration and 233U produc-
tion in thorium blanket, but these attempts do not look promising due to the pure
neutron balance of ThU cycle of MSFR in comparison with UPu (Table 12.16).
The thorium MSFR can provide the fuel breeding but with a very long doubling
time (B40 years) due to the small neutron excess at the 233U fission. The neutron
excess in the UPu fuel cycle is much higher but the solubility of PuF3 in almost
all fluoride salts is very low even at 700C: B1 mol% in 2LiFBeF2 (Barton,
1960), B3 mol% in LiFNaFBeF2 (Ignatiev et al., 2006)). Such a small concen-
tration of heavy elements in the carrier salt prevents the opportunity to create the
fast reactor with UPu fuel cycle.

The situation was changed in the last 3 years when it was experimentally estab-
lished that in the eutectic 46.5LiF11.5NaF42.0KF (FLiNaK) the solubility of
PuF3 is equal B30 mol% (Lizin et al., 2013a; Volozhin et al., 2013). This observa-
tion opens the way for the development of fast MSR with UPu fuel (UPu
FMSR) (Degtyarev and Ponomarev, 2012; Degtyarev et al., 2015).
12.2.2
Carrier salt for UPu FMSR
The eutectic 46.5LiF11.5NaF42.0KF mol%(FLiNaK) is well known and it was
considered several times as the coolant for high-temperature reactors (Forsberg,
2006; Williams et al., 2006, 2016) and hybrid fusionfission systems (LIFE, 2008).
Its fusion diagram is presented in Fig. 12.5 (Bergman and Dergunov, 1941) with
the melting temperature Tm 5 454C. The comparison of the FLiBe and FLiNaK
properties is presented in Table 12.17.

It is evident that all the thermophysical properties of both salts are very similar
in contrary to nuclear ones and the actinide solubility (Table 12.18, Fig. 12.6).
The individual solubilities of PuF3 and UF4 at their joint presence in the fuel
composition FLiNaKUF4PuF3 are presented in Fig. 12.7. It is evident that at the
joint presence of UF4 and PuF3 the individual solubilities are suppressed but the
total concentration of PuF3 and UF4 (B25 mol% at 650C) is high enough to keep
the fast neutron spectrum.
The high lanthanide fluoride solubility is also important because it allows us to
lengthen the intervals between the fuel composition adjustment (Fig. 12.8).

in-feeding by fissile nuclei 235U and 239Pu. If the reactor starts with 235U as a fuel
the equilibrium mode is achieved in B20 years (Fig. 12.10).
The neutron spectrum of UPu FMSR is presented in Fig. 12.11, in comparison
with the neutron spectrum of the fast reactor BN-1200. The deep gap in the UPu
FMSR spectrum is explained by the resonance in the elastic cross-section of the
neutron scattering on the F nuclei.
In Table 12.20 the comparison of the UPu FMSR and fast lead-cooled reactor
parameters is presented. It is interesting that the principal characteristics of both reac-
tors are quite similar: the specific power, reactor volume, and average fuel density.

12.2.4
UPu FMSR nuclear fuel cycle
In the framework of the MSRE project the studies of the fuel salt composition pro-
cessing have been initiated. The first processing diagram (ORNL, 1966) was based
on the volatility of UF6 and vacuum distillation, as well as on the extraction recov-
ery process (ORNL, 1969) of the molten fluorides mixture on the liquid metal (for
instance, Bi). These works are ongoing. Currently, a new technology is being con-
sidered combining three main processes: volatility of fluorides (U, Pu, and Np),
recovery extraction of minor actinides from molten salt into liquid metal, and the
anodic oxidation with precipitation of lanthanide oxides (Uhlir and Marecek, 2005;
Delpech et al., 2009). The technology developed is based on two processes: salt/
metal extraction and electric separation (Uhlir et al., 2007). The simplified proces-
sing of FLiNaK salt composition, i.e., removal of the rare earth elements directly
from the electrochemical cell based on the liquid metal extraction is also under
study (Long et al., 2013).
All these nonaqueous technologies have not been used in industrial nuclear
power for various reasons, and only one spent nuclear fuel (SNF) reprocessing tech-
nology based on the Purex process has been implemented on an industrial scale and
is still being developed. The prototype of the third generation plant, which com-
bines both nonaqueous and hydrometallurgy extraction processes is under develop-
ment (Gavrilov et al., 2015). This approach has proven to be extremely effective
and can help to solve one of the principal problems of the SNF radiochemical pro-
cessing: to avoid the liquid radioactive waste releases.

Fast-spectrum, liquid-fueled reactors

The first and the last operations have been thoroughly studied, however the prob-
lem of the minor actinides disposal remains pending. This section is mainly focused
on the recovery and recycling of the fissile isotopes (including Am), as well as their
separation from fission products. To process the irradiated FLiNaK-based fuel com-
position it is reasonable to consider the combined technology consisting of the non-
aqueous part (separation of actinides and rare earth elements) and Purex process of
the fissile element eliminations.
Usually, in order to use the Purex process in the fuel cycle the spent fuel must
be first stored for about 35 years, which is sufficient to reduce the background
radiation by approximately 103 times and to lower the temperature allowing use of
the water extraction methods. The equilibrium concentration of elements in the
spent FMSR fuel to be processed is similar to the elements concentration in the
spent MOX fuel of fast reactors, excluding the primary salt elements (Table 12.21).
During the MSRE project the experiment was performed to eliminate U, Th, and
Ce from the hot spent fuel based on LiF-NaF salt at a temperature of 750C, by the
precipitation with CaO (ORNL, 1959). In this case, actinides and Ce precipitate in
the form of oxides, and CaF2 remains in the melted salt (Fig. 12.12).
However, the primary composition salt in this case is changed from LiF-NaF to
LiFNaFCaF2, and cannot be reused.
For LiNaFKF carrier salt it is suggested to use sodium oxide for the actinide
and rare earth element precipitation from the fuel composition. The scheme and
results of the preliminary experiments of the U and Nd precipitation from the fluo-
ride mixture using Na2O at 650C are presented in Fig. 12.13 and Table 12.22

(Ponomarev et al., 2015, 2016). The precipitation allegedly takes place in accor-
dance with the following chemical reactions:

2 NdF3 1 3 Na2O ! Nd2O3 1 6 NaF:

399
Fast-spectrum, liquid-fueled reactors

The oxides are separated from the carrier salt by filtration, dissolution in the 3 mol/l
nitric acid and uranium extraction using 30% TBF in dodecane. After scrubbing, U is
re-extracted using a weak solution of nitric acid and, upon denitration, it changes into
UF4 that comes back to the fuel composition with the predefined concentration.
In the case of the U and Nd coprecipitation with stoichiometric Na2O stress, Nd
precipitation is approximately twice as efficient as that of U (Table 12.22). In this
case a new diagram can be developed for FLiNaK-based FMSR fuel cycle closing.
It consists of the periodic removal of the significant part of the lanthanide elements
and returning most of the uranium into the reactor.
The behavior of Pu under such conditions requires a special study, but the level
of its precipitation is expected to reside between the indices of uranium and lantha-
nide elements. The fuel composition essentially cleared out of the lanthanides is
returned into the reactor after its adjustment (Fig. 12.13); and the nonprecipitated
lanthanides with the part of U and Pu are directed to storage and after cooling the
rest of U and Pu are separated and returned into the reactor.
This diagram provides for Pu amount minimization outside the reactor, as well
as for the use of the well-known water extraction technology of the fuel composi-
tion processing.
One more improvement of the fuel cycle closing diagram is the possibility to
avoid the fission products, removing them from the fuel composition throughout the
total reactor service life (Matieu et al., 2009). This is possible due to the small lan-
thanide cross-sections of fast neutron capture. The combination of this diagram
with the capabilities of the fractional precipitation of the lanthanide oxides may
provide additional benefits.
The fuel cycle closing diagram of the spent fuel (Fig. 12.14) has certain benefits
in comparison with VVER and fast reactors ones:
G
No need for the fuel rods production from the high active spent fuel;
G
Lack of transportation, breakdown of the spent fuel assemblies and other mechanical
procedures;
G
Reduction by about threefold of the waste disposal mass due to the lack of the fuel assem-
bly metal parts.

assembly parts, the cost of the FMSR spent fuel handling is essentially reduced.
The economic evaluations based on the IAEA methods (OECD, 2013) indicate that
the cost of FMSR spent fuel handling operations is approximately fourfold lower
than the cost of the fuel cycle of solid fuel reactors.
The high-level radioactive waste disposal is determined as follows: 1 part of
Class 1 RW 1 3 parts of Class 2 RW. The cost of Class 1 RW disposal is twice as
high as that of Class 2 RW. Accordingly, the cost of Class 1 RW disposal is USD
600, and that of Class 2 RW is USD 400.
According to OECD (2013) the cost (USD/1 tonne SNF) of SNF handling for
fast neutron reactors of BN-1000 type is equal 1000 1 2000 1 1000 5 4000 USD
(processing 1 manufacture 1 disposal, Class 1 1 2 RW).
For FMSR: 500 1 600 5 1100 USD (processing 1 disposal Class 1 RW).
Therefore, the SNF handling cost for FMSR should be several times lower than
that of the fast BN and VVER (PWR) reactors, which is equal to 1500 to 2000 USD,
respectively, depending on the nuclear fuel cycle type (open or closed; OECD, 2013).

Conclusion
In the last 3 years it has been demonstrated that it is possible to create the fast mol-
ten salt reactor with UPu fuel cycle based on FLiNaK. This reactor can operate in
the equilibrium mode using 238U only. Its fuel cycle is simpler and cheaper than the
fast reactor with solid fuel elements. For the realization of these advantages it is
necessary to provide a complex scientific and technological study of the UPu
FMSR concept, similar to the MSRE and MSBR. It is also essential to study other
candidates for the FMSR carrier salts, e.g., NaFKFUF4 (Hirose et al., 2015).

Feasibility of the UPu fast-spectrum molten-salt
reactors using (Li, Na, K)FUF4TRUF3 fuel salts
12.3.1
Introduction
The author has proposed a concept of a UPu fast molten salt reactor using the
NaFKFUF4 solvent to dissolve an indefinite amount of TRUF3. This reactor sys-
tem including an on-line chemical processing was designated as the molten-salt fast
breeder reactor (MSFBR) (Hirose et al., 2015). There was also innovative intention
to confirm the feasibility of the fuel salt free from any issues associated with 7Li,
such as tritium control, chemical process complexity, and economic pressure. The
engineering feasibility of the MSFBR is studied by evaluating the amounts of fissile
material to be fed and to be discharged, which depend upon the initial U charge and
the fuel salt clean-up interval (Hirose et al., 2016; Hirose Y., 2017).
The viability of the concept requires a high solubility of actinide fluorides in
common alkali fluoride liquid eutectic mixtures and a good understanding of phase
stability during cooling until complete solidification.
The author is optimistic that fuel salts could be formulated by neutral com-
pounds of alkaliactinide fluoride without concerning uncertain solubility issues.
This goal is supported by the fact that alkali fluoride components such as LiF, NaF,
and KF modify their acidic counterparts such as UF4 and PuF3 to form neutral com-
pounds with lower melting points.
The present work intends to clarify the possibility if the UPu fast-spectrum
molten-salt reactors with predictable freezing behavior can be feasible by using
selected mixtures of alkali fluorideUF4 eutectic and alkali fluorideTRUF3 eutec-
tic to make reasonable breeding, relying on the phase relationships provided experi-
mentally or theoretically.

Preliminary survey and study
12.3.2.1
Alkali fluorides eutectic mixtures
Extensive phase-diagram studies, in which the relationship illustrating the variation
of compositions along with the liquidus temperature of mixtures have been defined,
for alkali fluorides (LiF, NaF, and KF) eutectic systems containing UF4 have done
by ORNL (Tohma, 1959; Barton et al., 1958a,b, 1961a,b) as listed in Table 12.23
and those containing PuF3 have been done thermodynamically (Benes et al., 2008,
2009) as listed in Table 12.24.
The binary and ternary phase diagrams of alkali fluoride mixtures containing
UF4 and those containing PuF3 are shown in Figs. 12.15 and 12.16.
12.3.2.2
Physical properties of alkali fluoride salt mixtures
as fuel matrices
Since most molten salt reactors considered during the early stages of the MSR proj-
ect in ORNL were thermal or epithermal, the fluorides of lithium, sodium,

beryllium, and zirconium have been given the most serious attention for reactor
use. However, some alkali fluoride mixtures including potassium with UF4 were
also investigated.
The originally acquired data (Grimes et al., 1960, Hill et all., 1967, Hara and
Ogino, 1989) of physical properties such as melting point, density, viscosity, and
heat capacity of alkali fluorides containing UF4 were compiled (Janz, 1967) and are
shown in Table 12.25.
Of all the properties, the density of fuel salt is immediately required information
to perform reactor physics calculations. The density of a molten salt mixture is cus-
tomarily obtained from a weighted average of molecular volume of components;
however it has been recognized that the results might be significantly erroneous

without pertinent information about the respective components. There were not so
many available density data of alkali fluorides containing UF4 as listed in
Table 12.25. However, it seems that all listed mixtures are approximately expressed
by an identical second-order function for a very wide concentration range of UF4,
i.e., 045 mol% as shown in Fig. 12.17. The averaged temperature coefficients
were reported as 0.0008/C in the range of 04 mol% of UF4, however as 0.0011/C
in the range higher than 22 mol%.
Based upon the density data for pure UF4, UF3, PuF4, and PuF3, i.e., 6.72, 8.97,
7.0, and 9.32 g/cm3, respectively (Benedict et al., 1981a), it is observed that the
densities of uranium trifluoride and plutonium trifluoride are four and three times
higher than those of tetrafluorides, respectively, and plutonium fluorides are 1.04

times higher than those of uranium fluorides. Thus it is hypothetically assumed that
PuF3 can be substituted by 1.389 molecules of UF4 in the sense of density effect
and UF3 by 1.335 molecules of UF4.
This procedure can give the density of 4.23 g/cm3 for FLiNaKUF4PuF3
(74235 mol%), that of 4.61 g/cm3 for NaFKFUF4PuF3 (4223.527.57.0
mol%), and that of 4.65 g/cm3 for NaFKFUF4UF3PuF3 (4223.5252.57.0
mol%) all at 627C. This procedure was a breakthrough in the study; however, it should
be experimentally verified later.
12.3.2.3
Chemical implication of Pu fissioning
It had been traditionally understood by ORNL (Thoma, 1968) that during UF4 fis-
sioning, the net oxidation state of fission products was less than four and yet four
fluorine atoms were released, leaving a somewhat oxidizing event per fission,
meanwhile, in the case of PuF3, it was expected to produce a slightly reducing
event per fission.
Meanwhile, it was suggested that the fission of PuF3 should produce some free
fluorine per fission in the proposed TRU burning MSR concept based on the fission
product yield data of 239Pu in thermal neutron spectrum and adapted the same
assumption of chemical behavior made during the MSBR conceptual design
(Hirose et al., 2001).
The author is more confident in giving free fluorine production by fast neutron
239PuF3 fission based upon relevant data obtained in an LMFBR (Benedict et al.,
1981b) and compared with the data for the MSBR (Baes, 1974) shown in
Table 12.26.
It takes a different approach (Shimazu et al., 2015) to certify the new Red-Ox
potential control paradigm by computation based on the ENDF/B-VII 238 groups
nuclear data, TRITON evaluation module, ORIGEN-S, and compiled by OPUS
module of the SCALE6.1 (ORNL, 2011), and elucidated that the free fluorine yield

there were no traces of tellurium intergranular cracking on specimens in the fuel

be Lewis neutral (Toth et al., 1994), however it would be reasonable to take the [U

Chemical implication of fission product lanthanides

Molar yield of fission product lanthanides
The molar yield of fission product lanthanides was elucidated from the same calcu-
lation (Shimazu et al., 2015) for the free fluorine yield of 239PuF3 per unit power
output under fast neutron fission based on the ENDF/B-VII 238 group as shown in
Table 12.28.
12.3.2.5
Operational characteristics of the MSFBR
The engineering feasibility of the MSFBR feeding with TRU by evaluating control
characteristics is mainly associated with the amount of fissile material to be fed and
to be discharged which depend on the initial U charge and the fuel salt clean-up
interval (Hirose et al., 2016).
12.3.2.5.1
Reactor physical properties
Physical calculations were made taking originally proposed configurations of the
reactor (core height/radius ratio: 1.85, core volume: 21.2 m3, primary circuit vol-
ume: 31.8 m3) and the definition of the terms, such as the power output (3.2 GWth)
and the effective density of fuel salt (3.1 g/cm3) were the same as the reference
(Ponomarev, 2013), but other factors, such as the actinides isotopic composition
(Ando et al., 1999), neutron leakage (with 30-cm steel reflector), the fuel tempera-
ture (627C), the fuel salt density, and the salt clean-up and make-up condition,
etc., were discretely specified to give a verified number of heavy element masses
and concentrations in the fuel salt to give designated criticality from the start-up to
the final state (40 years), using the SRAC2006 standard nuclear analytical code
with PIJ-BURN routine (Okumura et al., 2007) based upon JENDLE3.3 (Shibata
et al., 2002), which has been a traditional practice applied on the thermal neutron
molten salt reactors such as the FUJI series (Mitachi et al., 2008).
The pertinent results of physical calculation using recovered uranium instead of
238U are shown in Tables 12.29 and 12.30. The experimental data are classified
according to the mass of initial U charge, the TRU source, and the interval of chem-
ical cleaning (300 efpd or 1500 efpd).

Initial U charge
The initial uranium inventory dominates linearly the initial critical fissile mass, the
breeding gain, and inversely the total supplement charge as shown in Fig. 12.20
(Hirose et al., 2016). The effect of initial U charge on feed/breed balance is evalu-
ated in three cases in which fuel salt cleaning started after 300 effective full power
days (efpd) with an interval of 300 efpd. The larger initial charge of U represents a
larger amount of initial fissile inventory but a smaller amount of supplement; how-
ever, the peak annual supplement is less dependent on the initial U charge. A total
61.4 tons of initial charge of U is the lowest threshold limit to make breeding

breakeven possible, while 71.5 tons of U can provide as much as 100 kg TRU of
annual breeding; however, it has the highest threshold limit by U content
acceptable by the fuel salt.
12.3.2.5.3
Fuel salt cleaning interval
Three hundred efpd and 1500 efpd fuel salt cleaning intervals are evaluated with
the same charge of the fuel salt composition, as shown in Fig. 12.21 (Hirose et al.,

2016). No chemical cleaning but only making up of actinides was made during the
designated initial interval. This guarantees sufficient build-up of fission products in
the fuel salt all the way from the start-up to equilibrium.
The longer interval represents a larger amount of fissile material initial supple-
ment (0.73t to 3.53t), but the peak annual supplement is nearly irrespective to the
cleaning interval (0.59t to 0.66t). From the standpoint of reactor operation control,
the peak make-up value (not the total fissile supplement) determines the cost rela-
tive to throughput of the chemical process.
The operation of an MSFBR with 300 efpd of fuel salt cleaning interval can pro-
vide good breeding (100 kg-TRU/year), while that with 1500 efpd barely provides a
sustaining operation with appreciable breeding (10 kg-TRU/year) at equilibrium.
Intervals longer than 1500 efpd should not be acceptable, due to build-up of
neutron-absorbing fission products.
12.3.2.6
Chemical processing in the MSFBR
12.3.2.6.1
Oxide selective precipitation process
The chemical processing in the MSFBR should efficiently remove fuel materials
from the fission products, but not necessarily efficiently remove fission products
that become neutron poisons, if it were operated with thermal neutrons.
To perform this perpetual mission, a processing interval of 1500 efpd is suffi-
ciently long, and provides a small throughput. The on-line chemical processing
facility with remote handling of radioactive isotopes would be the most expensive
part of the plant. The cost would depend upon the process complexity, material
compatibility, process wastes, and capacity.
In the very early stage of the MSR Program at ORNL, experimental studies on
selective precipitation of oxides were carried out, because it might be a
suitable scheme for the reprocessing of molten salt reactor fuels. It was abandoned
after discovery of the reductive extraction and metal-transfer process associated
with the UF6 volatile process, which, though complex and material-incompatible,
involved handling only liquids and gases. The fluoride volatile process of UF6 had
been perceived as the most practical since successful operation in MSRE. However,
the fact that metallic Zr scrap addition should be followed, a prolonged H2 sparge
to remove metallic corrosion products (Ni, Fe, Cr) caused by F2 treatment was
sometimes overlooked.
The initial selective oxide precipitation experiment chose LiFKF (5050 mol%)
as a matrix, and estimated the concentration of the particular metal ion remaining
in solution in the presence of some 25% excess precipitating agents (usually CaO) and
it
was
concluded
that
UO2
would
precipitate
almost
completely
(liquid
phase , 0.0008 wt%) before any Ce2O3 precipitates as shown in Table 12.31 and
Fig. 12.22 (Shaffer, 1958).
It was envisioned to apply the oxidation process to the DMSR fuel. They could
treat the melt with a strong oxidant to convert UF3 to UF4, PaF4 to PaF5, and PuF3
to PuF4. Precipitating the insoluble oxides was achieved using water vapor diluted in
helium. The oxides UO2, Pa2O5, PuO2, CeO2, probably NpO2, and possibly AmO2
and CmO2 should be obtained. The oxides are recovered by decantation and
413

filtration. The oxides are hydrofluorinated into the purified melt of LiFBeF2ThF4
and the melt reduced with H2 and fuel reconstituted with the desired UF3/UF4 ratio
(Engel et al., 1980).
It was also suggested (Ignatiev et al., 2007a,b) that the oxide precipitation
process could be a possible option compared to the reductive extraction process
or
electrochemical
process,
because
of

simplicity
and

acceptable corrosion of material (pure Ni), referring to a successful attempt by a
Russian scientist (Gorbunov et al., 1976), which was made to precipitate mixed ura-
nium, plutonium, minor actinides, and rare earths from LiFNaF molten salt solu-
tion by fluor-oxide exchange with other oxides (for example, CaO, Al2O3) at
temperatures of 700800C. The following order of precipitation was found in the
system: UPuAmLnCa. Essentially all U and TRU were recovered from the
Figure 12.22 Reaction of UF4 and CeF3 with CaO in LiFKF.

molten salt till to a residual concentration 5 3 1024%, when 510 mol% of rare
earths was still concentrated in solution.
12.3.2.6.2
Fuel salt clean-up process
Basing upon the survey, it is concluded that the application of the selective oxide
precipitation process with alkali or alkali-earth metal oxides (K2O2; melt at 490C
and CaO; solid) as the oxidizer can be feasible under special selectivity cautions to
the MSFBR technology relying on NaF and KF as major components of the fuel
matrix, as shown in Fig. 12.23 (Hirose et al., 2016).
If it can reduce TRU concentration to 5 3 1024 mol% in liquid phase from 8 mol
%, the available loss rate will be 6.25 3 1025. This loss rate is substantially lower
than 1023 of the target to be achieved by the pyro-processes currently under
development.
It should be taken into account that melting temperature increases during actinide
removal treatment. Using K2O2 as a precipitator can modify the Na/K ratio to give a
eutectic mixture of 710C. Fluorine freed from UO2 precipitation would react with
TRUF3 to oxidize them into TRUF4 which can be eventually precipitated as TRUO2.
Succeeding use of CaO as a precipitator up to ca. 20 mol% may give stable ternary
eutectic at ca. 700C of the waste salt after the eutectic has been achieved.
The on-line chemical processing flowsheet applicable to the cleaning interval of
1500 efpd is shown in Fig. 12.24 (Hirose et al., 2016), in which He sparge process to
purge gaseous fission products as well as noble and seminoble metal fission products,
electro reductive removing zirconium developed for the MSRE remediation (Peretz,
1996) are incorporated. It is noteworthy that the process is facilitated to eliminate solid
handling but performed by liquid phase handling only. Up to 10% of fission product
lanthanides would be allowed to leak into the fuel salt stream after processing.

12.3.2.6.3
Actinide make-up
Flexibility of the fuel chargedischarge for the molten salt reactor has been often
perceived as the prominent advantageous feature associated with the operation.
However, the only way used to charge the MSR with fuel during MSRE operation
was to use an initial charge of 0.73LiF0.27UF4 eutectic (490C) solution, and to
use make-up of UF4 solid in a 1.5 kg-U batch. Meanwhile Pu make-up was done as
PuF3 powder in 30 g-Pu batch dissolved into the fuel salt at 654C within 3 hours
(Grimes, 1970). Introducing a 0.805LiF0.195PuF3 eutectic mixture (743C) into
the fuel salt circuit might be possible (Thoma, 1968), however it will be question-
able because of high eutectic temperature compared with the reactor operating
temperature.
The oxide precipitation process incorporated with the hydrofluorination process
makes feasible the use of mixed solid compounds as make-up materials. A typical
3.2 GWt MSFBR requires 21.2% UTRU mixed compound of 90 tons for the ini-
tial charge and 3.41 kg-U/efpd (1245 kg-U/efpy) of make-up in the equilibrium
Figure 12.24 On-line chemical processing in the MSFBR.
416
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

state, compared with the 47.8 kg-U/efpd of projected throughput of the chemical
processing.
The MSFBR requires several tons of TRU supplement until reaching equilib-
rium. This system is capable to make-up 0.92 kg-TRU/efpd (336 kg-TRU/efpy), if
the same UTRU mixed compound as the initial charge is applied.
However, the peak TRU supplement during the initial stage of operation, for
example, is 661 kg-TRU/efpy, while U make-up is 1.088t. This means that up to
37.8% UTRU mixed compound should be temporally required in these occasions.
Excess actinides should be removed from the system not as the separated compo-
nents, but simply as the fuel salt. The annual loss of TRU due to fuel salt chemical
cleaning is 6 kg basing upon 1500 efpd of interval and 0.1% of nominal loss rate
for 22.6 tons-TRU inventory. This can be accounted for in the equilibrium phase
indefinitely because the accumulated TRU surplus is typically 266 kg for 20 years.
12.3.2.6.4
Red-Ox potential control
The nuclear reaction in the MSFBR does not transform LiF into HF, but does trans-
form UF4 into TRUF3, and fission of TRUF3 into fission products. The annual free
fluorine production of 3.2 GWt MSFBR at the equilibrium is 1308 moles from the
transmutation of UF4 and 3258 moles from the fission of TRUF3 according to the
chemical processing scheme shown in Fig. 12.24. The annual consumption of UF3
is 4566 moles (1087 kg-U). This can be compensated by dissolution of 1522 moles-
uranium metal (362 kg) in the fuel salt containing UF4 as a part of annual U make-
up (1245 kg-U), though hydrofluorination is also available in a side stream.
12.3.3
UPu fast-spectrum molten-salt reactors
The possibility of fluoride molten salt fuel for a U/Pu breeder reactor is investigated
not by dissolving actinide fluorides in a solvent, but by producing a well-
established alkali fluoride eutectic mixture containing UF4 and a theoretically
assessed alkali fluoride eutectic mixture containing PuF3. The alkali fluorides, such
as LiF, NaF, and KF, modify their acidic counterparts such as UF4 and PuF3 to
form neutral compounds with certainly lower melting points. The candidates are
specific combinations of fertile salt and fissile salt with a higher heavy metal con-
centration and a lower eutectic temperature.
12.3.3.1
Feasibility of the UPu fast-spectrum
molten-salt reactors
12.3.3.1.1
Alkali fluorideactinide fluoride mixtures
According to the classic design principle of molten salt reactors, the fuel salt should
compose a eutectic mixture and all components of the fuel salt should congruously
solidify at the eutectic point.
The fast neutron fluoride molten salt reactor fuel is feasible if the liquidus tem-
perature (i.e., nothing but liquid is stable higher than that) is kept at least 50C
lower than the reactor core inlet temperature. A fuel salt should be qualified by the
417
Fast-spectrum, liquid-fueled reactors

highest freezing temperature, at which any deposition of solid phase starts, as the
phase change is incongruous in nature in this case. However, freezing behavior
should be observed until the final solidification in order to perform any engineering
as well as safety evaluations. Candidates of combination by fissile salt and fertile
salt are selected from eutectic compounds based upon higher heavy element con-
centration and lower melting point as listed in Table 12.32.
12.3.3.1.2
Fuel salt constitution procedure
A fuel salt is constituted by use of a smaller portion of the fissile salt containing
PuF3 to satisfy neutronic requirements and by use of the balance of the fertile salt
appropriately enriched with UF4 to satisfy neutronic requirements, taking into
account dilution by mixing with the fissile salt.
The fundamental scheme of the procedure to constitute a fuel salt and to identify
freezing points is illustrated in Fig. 12.25 (Hirose, 2017). In this case, the fuel salt
of 0.349NaF0.289KF0.281UF40.081PuF3 (liquidus at 605C) is constituted by
adding 23.8 mol% of 0.053NaF0.607KF0.340PuF3 (eutectic at 605C) to
76.2 mol% of 0.442NaF0.189KF0.369UF4 (liquidus at 590C). In this fuel salt,
the fissile salt completely freezes at 605C, meanwhile the fertile salt starts to
freeze at 590C and completely solidifies at 490C during cooling.
Any supplement or make-up of heavy elements is principally carried out using
UPu mixed compounds; however adjustment of alkali fluoride composition might
be done, if required.
12.3.3.1.3
Neutronic behavior of fuel salts
The reactor physics calculations are made using the same process as described in
Section 12.3.2.5.1. The results of calculation are summarized in Tables 12.33,
12.34, and Fig. 12.26.
It was revealed from the overall results that an appreciable breeding gain could
be realized after a certain number of years from the start-up in the use of alkali

15.116.4 tons
(5.16.4 mol%),

that
2.13.1 tons of Pu were supplemented in certain patterns after the start-up. At equi-
librium U does not increase from start-up but TRU increases to 20.621.8 tons
(7.18.3 mol%).
Absence of potassium in the alkali fluoride salts such as LiF and LiFNaF is
evidently favorable to the neutronic performance, and consequently to the feed and
breed performance, evaluated by smaller need of fissile supplement, shorter period
of zero-breeding, and larger breeding gain than the potassium-containing salt. The
breeding performance appeared to be quantitatively suppressed according to the
level of potassium content.
The calculation for NaFKFUF4TRUF3 instead of NaFKFUF4PuF3
revealed the highest breeding with the lowest supplementary feeding backed up by
higher initial feed so far in cases investigated as shown in Fig. 12.27. This, plus the
fact that the Pu/MA molar ratio of TRU in the equilibrium inventory is almost the
same as in the initial charge, mean that the UPu fast-spectrum reactor can accept
and favorably manage all trans-uranium elements without elaborate partitioning.
12.3.3.1.4
Freezing behavior of fuel salt
The freezing temperature of the fuel salts principally depends upon the highest
eutectic temperature of all the systems. The higher eutectic concentration of fissile
salts is the principal factor to be concerned with the fissile salt, if there are options
(Benes et al., 2008). The freezing temperature of the fertile salt depends upon
mainly UF4 concentration at the fixed molar ratios of alkali fluorides in the experi-
mentally derived classic ternary phase diagrams.

(Hirose, 2017).

Fast-spectrum, liquid-fueled reactors

The constituents of fuel salts, freezing temperatures of individual fertile salts and
fissile salts, and the highest solid-depositing temperatures of the fuel salts at the
start-up and at equilibrium are shown in Table 12.35.
The eutectic temperature of fissile salts is always higher than that of fertile salts
as shown in Table 12.32. However, in principle the eutectic temperature of the fis-
sile salt dominates the highest liquidus temperature (i.e., solid-depositing) tempera-
ture in a fuel salt, there is a possibility to initiate UF4 deposition above that
temperature when the PuF3 concentration is not high enough and a higher UF4 con-
centration required, as in the case of LiFKFPuF3, for example.
It is noteworthy that the LiFNaFKFUF4PuF3 system can provide the low-
est freezing temperature at 513C among studied cases if the concentration of UF4
is kept lower than 25 mol% by decreasing the initial U inventory and that of PuF3
is lower than 6 mol%.
The freezing of NaFKFUF4PuF3 fuel salt is dictated by the eutectic point
of fissile salt (605C) to give eutectic freezing of NaFKFPuF3 almost irrespec-
tive to the concentration of UF4. This temperature is substantially higher than that
of the classic fuel salts for thermal neutron molten salt reactors (500C) based upon
the Hastelloy-N, however it is not so different from that of the revised MSFR
(594C) (EVOL, 2015) or a chloride molten-salt reactor (REBUS-3700) (600C)
(Mourogov et al., 2006).

Effect of UF3 and lanthanide trifluorides on freezing behavior
Burnup of a solid fuel is in proportion to the core replacement interval, however
that of a molten salt fuel depends on the on-line chemical processing interval. In an

liq.: The highest liquidus temperature (Tohma, 1959; Benes et al., 2008).

MSFBR with 3.2 GWt output, the chemical processing interval of 1500 efpd repre-
sents 52,000 MWd/t-HM. This burnup is the upper limit due to neutron absorption
by building up of fission products.
Meanwhile, it has been thermodynamically suggested that trifluorides of fission
product lanthanides behave like PuF3 and minor actinide fluorides in the phase rela-
tionship, and that they would interfere with the freezing behavior. A system of
3.2 GWt output produces 6000 moles of fission product lanthanide trifluorides
within 1500 efpy (Table 12.28). This corresponds to 6.9% of TRUF3 assuming that
the inventory is 20.9 tons-TRU (87,100 moles).
It was also perceived that UF3 substitutes dissolved PuF3 as it forms a solid solu-
tion with PuF3 during freezing (Ward et al., 1959). The phase diagram of the alkali
fluorideUF3 system might be assumed to be the same as the PuF3 system, though
experimental verification should be required.
If the U(IV)/U(III) ratio in the system is fixed at 20 as a Red-Ox buffer medium,
71.4
tons-U
(300,000 moles)
of
the
total
U
inventory
should
consist
of
285,700 moles of UF4 and 14,300 moles of UF3. The concentration of UF3 is
1.33 mol% when that of PuF3 is 8.10 mol%. The total inventory of trifluoride,
including UF3, is kept to a burnup level 1.164 times that of PuF3. Meanwhile, the
UF4 inventory is reduced to 0.952 by chemical reduction to UF3.
Calculations are based upon appropriate phase diagrams to evaluate the effect of
reduction of UF4 to UF3 and build-up of fission product lanthanide trifluorides in the
case of NaFKF0.281UF40.081PuF3 fuel salt according to the chemical processing
interval for two cases of fissile salt arrangement; (1) 0.053NaF0.607KF0.340PuF3
(eutectic at 605C), (2) 0.052NaF0.599KF0.349PuF3 (liquidus at 610C) as shown
in Table 12.36 (Hirose, 2017).
It is found that the UF4 reduction to UF3 does not have significant effects, irre-
spective of the fissile salt, while the build-up of lanthanide trifluorides can be over-
come by using the fissile salt with a liquidus temperature of 610C, instead of the
salt with a eutectic temperature of 605C.
Even if all UF3 were produced intentionally at the start-up or oxidized inciden-
tally to UF4 at 1500 efpd of the chemical processing interval, the highest fuel salt
liquidus temperature does not exceed 610C by using the fissile salt.
12.3.3.2.2
Validity of criteria
Although it is conservatively assumed in this study that the phase relationship of
fertile salt and that of fissile salt would be independent in a mixture, some addi-
tional amount of PuF3 may dissolve in alkali fluorideUF4 fertile salts at the eutec-
tic temperature. It has been thermodynamically suggested that 0.74LiF0.26UF4
could dissolve PuF3 as high as 1.0 mol% at the eutectic point of 484C (Capelli
et al., 2015), nevertheless further experimental verification is required.
The feasibility and characteristics of the fast neutron UPu molten salt reactor
are evaluated, based upon concentrations of actinide fluorides derived from the
phase diagrams. The molar concentration of actinide fluorides in a fuel salt are cal-
culated, based upon the molar composition and estimated density of a fuel salt at
designated actinide inventories. The calculated molar concentration value of

actinide fluorides is inversely proportional to the density of fuel salt. The algorism
to obtain the density of fuel salt should be standardized, if physical calculations are
to be compared between respective organizations.
12.3.3.2.3
Reiterate calculations
The alkali fluoride compositions in fuel salts presented in Table 12.36 represented
the specific NaF/KF molar ratio to give the highest liquidus temperature, but they
have not been generalized for reactor physical calculations. Reiterated calculations
of reactor physical assessments by applying chemically elucidated NaF/KF molar
ratios are required in the next step.
The system under investigation has not yet been optimized in various factors
such as power output, system size, power density, operating temperature, etc. Any
reiterated calculations would be appreciated.
12.3.4
Conclusions
The
MSFBR
concept
that
excludes
lithium,
provides
us
with
not
only
acceptable performances in nuclear physics, but also a simplified process in chemi-
cal engineering, with enormous potential benefit for nuclear fission energy, not
relying on existing fuel cycle infrastructure, with ultimate safety, cleanliness, and
simplicity, even though complete optimization has not yet been made.
The viability of the proposed concept is not due to any sophisticated theories or
mechanisms, but to a high concentration of heavy metal fluorides in common alkali
fluoride eutectic mixtures as liquid phases.
The present study confirms the feasibility to eliminate uncertainties about solu-
bility, using a discreet compound of the fertile salt and the fissile salt, for which
phase relationships have been elucidated experimentally or thermodynamically. The
favorable features of the MSFBR should not be almost tarnished by the new fuel
constitution paradigm. Freezing behaviors of fuel salts are analyzed as a collateral
outcome. The disadvantage of the required hotter core inlet temperature might be
outweighed by the advantage of a lithium-free operation.

Introduction: definition of the FHR concept
Solid-fuel salt-cooled reactors are a class of thermal-spectrum nuclear reactors that
use fuel-free fluoride-salts as the primary coolant, solid fuel elements, graphite

moderator, stainless steel (SS) alloys for the structural components, and operating
at nearly atmospheric pressures. In the United States, where the concept initiated,
these reactors are termed fluoride-salt cooled high-temperature reactors (FHRs). In
China, they are called thorium molten salt reactors—solid fuel (TMSR-SF;
Chapter 17: Thorium molten salt reactor nuclear energy system (TMSR)).
FHRs combine technologies and system architectures originally developed for
MSRs, gas-cooled reactors, and liquid-metal-cooled reactors. Since the 1970s, high-
temperature, gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) technology has been studied because of
the potential advantages of delivering heat at substantially higher temperatures than
are achievable with light-water reactors (LWRs). The advantages of higher tem-
peratures include increased efficiency for power conversion; reduced waste heat
generation, reduced cooling water, and thus increased siting flexibility; and the
capability to provide cogeneration and process heat services. It has proven challeng-
ing, however, to develop helium-cooled reactor designs with passive decay heat
removal capability that can compete economically with conventional LWRs.
Research on salt-cooled, high-temperature reactors was initiated in 2002 with
studies of a liquid salt very high-temperature reactor (LS-VHTR) aimed at achiev-
ing high core outlet temperatures (9501000C), derived from the work at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in the 1960s and 1970s (Forsberg et al., 2003).
The LS-VHTR was essentially a modified helium-cooled VHTR, using liquid salt
as the primary coolant, which operated at near atmospheric pressure and substan-
tially greater power density (two to six times higher) than helium-cooled reactors
(Ingersoll and Clarno, 2005; Clarno and Gehin, 2006; Casino, 2006). FHR core
power densities are in the range of 1030 MW/m3; gas-cooled reactor core power
densities are 4.8 MW/m3 for the 400 MWth pebble bed modular helium reactor
(PBMR), and 6.6 MW/m3 for the 600 MWth gas turbine (GT) modular helium reac-
tor (Gas Turbine-Modular Helium Reactor, 1996; Matzer and Wallace, 2005).
While substantially higher than these HTGRs, FHR core power densities are lower
than for PWRs (105 MW/m3) and SFRs (321 MW/m3). Based upon the metric of
primary system volume, given by the specific reactor vessel power (MWe/m3),
FHR reactor vessels are much more compact than PBMRs and Super-Power
Reactor Innovative Small Module (S-PRISM), and less compact than PWR reactor
vessels.
As comparisons like these were made, researchers also quickly recognized that
liquid salt coolants could achieve the same average primary coolant temperature
with a significantly lower maximum outlet coolant temperature compared to
helium-cooled reactors. Because thermal efficiency depends primarily on average
coolant temperature, rather than peak temperature, the LS-VHTR concept evolved
into the advanced high-temperature reactor (AHTR), and then the FHR.
The goal of FHRs is to provide an energy technology with a short commercializa-
tion timeline, with significant safety advantages compared to advanced light-water
nuclear reactors currently under construction, and at costs that are competitive with
natural gas. The current development efforts are exclusively for reactors with inlet
core temperatures of 600C, and an outlet core temperature of 700C. The upper
temperature limit imposed on the core outlet temperature stems from the use of
436
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

American Society of Mechanical Engineers code-certified structural materials, i.e.,
ferritic steels, for the primary pressure boundary (Ingersoll et al., 2004; Forsberg
et al., 2012; Forsberg et al., 2013; Sabharwall et al., 2013; Peterson and Zhao, 2006;
Fei et al., 2008), whose modulus of elasticity sees a rapid decrease past 704C. On
the opposing end, the 600C inlet core temperature is selected based on the power
conversion efficiency. More specifically, the compressor exit temperatures of mod-
ern industrial-scale GT compressor with pressure ratios of 15.523 range between
350 and 580C as depicted in Fig. 13.1 (Andreades, 2015; Andreades et al., 2014a).
Future designs may use better materials, yielding higher operational tempera-
tures, and thus more efficient power conversion cycles, or a broader market for
high-temperature process heat applications. The current development efforts are
focused on a short deployment timeline, and thus aim at taking advantage as much
as possible of off-the-shelf equipment, and already demonstrated technology.
The nominal salt is FLiBe, which has the most favorable neutronic, heat transfer,
and physicochemical properties among all fluoride salt mixtures studied to date.
However, other fluoride-salt mixtures continue to be explored. The two main dri-
vers for considering alternatives to FLiBe are:
1. To avoid beryllium-containing melts, because beryllium has high respiratory toxicity, its
inhaled particulates leading to lung disease similar to that from asbestos;
2. To avoid lithium and beryllium, both of which transmute to tritium under neutron irradiation.
Neither of these issues lead to a scientific roadblock, but they present engineer-
ing challenges, with consequences on economics and public opinion.
As part of the effort to commercialize HTGRs, a wide experience base with
manufacturing and performance of coated-particle fuel has been established in the
United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, China, Russia, Japan, South Africa,
and the Republic of Korea (Greene et al., 2010). The FHR also uses coated-particle

studied thus far is TRISO fuel (tri-isotopic ceramic-encapsulated particle fuel). TRISO
fuel particles are triple-coated spherical particles of uranium fuel, less than one milli-
meter in diameter. A uranium center is coated by a layer of carbon, which is then
coated by silicon carbide, with an outer shell of carbon. In effect, this gives each tiny
particle its own primary containment system. The particles are then fabricated into
fuel pebbles. This pebble design enables a substantial increase in power density while
maintaining relatively low peak fuel particle temperature. The higher power density of
the fuel pebbles will imply a higher inventory of short-lived fission products; however,
irradiation experiments at two US national laboratories (Idaho National and Oak Ridge
National Laboratories) found that TRISO particles retain fission products even at tem-
peratures of 1800C, several hundred degrees above design operating temperatures
and 200C above postulated design basis accident conditions (Petti, 2014). This
margin provides a strong case for safe performance of the fuel.
The FHR can be coupled to a number of different power conversion systems,
among them Nuclear Air-Brayton Combined Cycle (NACC), Supercitical Carbon
Dioxide (S-CO2) Brayton cycle, Helium Brayton cycle, or conventional Rankine
steam cycle (Chapter 2: Electricity production). Steam cycles are the most mature and
commercially available technology, and offer the nearest path solution; however
steam cycles are limited in terms of operational flexibility and restrict FHR to be base-
load power plants. NACCs are of a medium-term development timescale due to the
widespread availability of heavy industrial GTs, and modifications to the machines
can be made to accommodate external heating of air (Andreades, 2015; Andreades et
al., 2014a,b). The novel aspect of NACCs is their ability to simultaneously burn natu-
ral gas or other combustible fuels at very high efficiency and high ramp rates, thus
providing flexible capacity to the integrated electric grid. This is particularly impor-
tant and pertinent to electric grids with high renewable penetration and intermittency
issues. Finally, the S-CO2 Brayton cycle is the most compact configuration thus pro-
viding a reduced footprint for the FHR. Additionally, the S-CO2 cycle can have an
efficiency ranging from 40 to 50%, depending on configuration. S-CO2 cycles how-
ever are the least mature technology and have the longest development roadmap.
We will now delve into specific designs being investigated at various universities
and research institutions, followed by their inherent and passive safety features, unique
phenomenology to FHRs, and finally their safety analysis and licensing approaches.

13.2.1
PB-FHR—UC Berkeley
The University of California, Berkeley, released a preconceptual design for a small
modular 236 MWth randomly packed pebble-bed FHR in 2014 (Andreades et al.,
2016). The Mk1 FHR, as it was named, uses a NACC based upon a modified General
Electric 7FB GT, designed to produce 100 MWe of base-load electricity when oper-
ated with only nuclear heat, and to increase this power output to 242 MWe using gas
cofiring for peak electricity generation. Due to the high thermal efficiency of the
NACC system, the steam-bottoming condenser of the Mk1 PB-FHR requires only
40% of the cooling water supply that is required for a conventional LWR, for each
MWh of base-load generation. As with conventional natural-gas combined cycles
(NGCC), this makes the efficiency penalty of using dry cooling with air-cooled con-
densers much smaller, enabling economic operation in regions where water is scarce.
A new value proposition for NACC arises from additional revenues earned by pro-
viding flexible grid support services to handle the ever-increasing demand for dis-
patchable peak power, in addition to traditional base-load electrical power generation.
Under base-load operation NACC power conversion has lower fuel costs than NGCC,
and under peaking operation it has higher efficiency in converting natural gas to elec-
tricity than NGCC, so NACC plants will always be dispatched before conventional
NGCC plants (Andreades, 2015; Andreades and Per, 2016; Andreades et al., 2014a,b).
The reference configuration for the Mk1 site uses 12 Mk1 units, as shown in
Fig. 13.2, capable of producing 1200 MWe of base load electricity, and ramping to
a peak power output of 2900 MWe.
PB-FHR fuel pebbles are 3.0 cm in dimeter. The annular core design has a
removable graphite central reflector and an outer graphite reflector pebble layer to
protect the outer fixed reflector. The Mk1 is also capable of online refueling. The
Mk1 reactor vessel is depicted in Fig. 13.3. Four Mk1 pebbles can provide electric-
ity for a full year for an average US household, which in 2011 consumed
11.3 MWe-h. These four small pebbles are far less than the 8.1 tons of anthracite
coal, or 17 tons of lignite coal, needed to produce the same amount of electricity
using a coal power plant.
The Mk1 does not use an intermediate coolant loop and instead directly heats
the power conversion fluid. It eliminates the conventional reactor guard vessel used
in sodium fast reactors and instead uses a refractory reactor cavity liner system.
Full passive decay heat removal is utilized. All components for the Mk1 design are
rail-transportable.
13.2.2
SmAHTR—ORNL
SmAHTR is a 125-MWth cartridge-core, integral-primary-system FHR that uses
fixed plate-type fuel. The ORNL 2012 AHTR is a large 3400-MWth fixed plate
440
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

fuel variant of the FHR. This 2012 AHTR design implements novel designs for fuel
and refueling, and demonstrates a practical application of supercritical steam for
power conversion based upon extensive experience in fossil power plants. Other
potential power conversion systems that could be coupled to the SmAHTR include
S-CO2 or multi-reheat Helium Brayton cycles. The SmAHTR reactor vessel is
3.5 m in diameter, and as such is transportable by tractor-trailor to its deployment
location. Fig. 13.4 depicts the SmAHTR being transported on a tractor-trailer.
The SmAHTR design takes advantage of the existing safety philosophy of sev-
eral small modular reactors (SMRs). The reactor employs passive decay-heat

removal systems relying on natural convection, and the core is designed with large
negative reactivity feedback coefficients. The core and all primary components are
contained in the reactor vessel (integral design). This design eliminates the large
break loss-of-coolant accident scenario. Only intermediate-loop piping carrying
nonradioactive coolant penetrates the vessel. The passive decay-heat removal
design eliminates the reliance on off-site power (which is needed in remote loca-
tions) and the need for safety-related emergency on-site AC power. The reactor can
be seen as having several barriers to fission product release in the case of an
accident: coated particle fuel, the graphite moderator, the reactor vessel/guard
vessel, and the containment.
The SmAHTR concept has been developed with three potential operating modes
and applications in mind: (1) process heat production; (2) electricity production;
and (3) a combined cogeneration mode in which both electricity and process heat
are produced.
13.2.3
AHTR—ORNL
The AHTR is a design concept for a central station type (1500 MWe/3400 MWth)
FHR that was as of 2016 under development by ORNL for the US Department of
Energy, Office of Nuclear Energy’s Advanced Reactor Concepts program. FHRs,
by definition, feature low-pressure liquid fluoride salt cooling, coated-particle fuel,
a high-temperature power cycle, and fully passive decay heat rejection.
The reactor vessel has an exterior diameter of 10.48 m, a height of 17.7 m, and a
core height of 5.5 m, with 25 cm of reflector above and below with plate-type fuel.
A row of replaceable graphite reflector prismatic blocks surrounds the core radially.
The reactor confinement is not required to withstand high pressures since there is
Figure 13.4 SmAHTR reactor vessel can be transported via tractor-trailer (Greene et al.,
2010).
442
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

no source of stored energy in the reactor, in contrast to LWRs. A three-loop inter-
mediate coolant system separates the primary coolant from the power conversion
working fluid, while also reducing the inventory of primary coolant. The AHTR
uses an advanced supercritical steam Rankine cycle, due to its high efficiency and
technological maturity relative to other power cycles. It uses a dual powertrain to
reduce the steam generator sizing and the possibility of losing 100% of the primary
heatsink. Decay heat is removed by three direct reactor auxiliary cooling systems
(DRACS) modular decay heat removal loops. Fig. 13.5 depicts the current AHTR
core, reactor vessel, and nearby structures. In orange are the fuel elements; in teal
are the control rods and associated drive mechanisms; in violet are the DRACS; in
light violet are the primary coolant pump, primary-to-intermediate heat exchanger,
and primary coolant loop piping.
The AHTR is a combination of a pool and loop-type reactor design, avoiding an
integral setup to improve maintainability and servicing and reduce complication of
reactor internal design. Plate-type fuel in a hexagonal lattice is used to reduce pri-
mary coolant pressure losses flowing the core, especially during loss of forced cool-
ant accidents. The fuel is UCO-coated particles enriched to 19.75% U-235, with a
refueling interval of 2 years. All components of the overall thermal feedback are
negative or very near zero for all design variants considered, providing a large
overall negative thermal reactivity feedback.
The intermediate salt KF-ZrF4 was chosen in part because it does not contain
lithium or beryllium. It is relatively nontoxic, and any leaks into the primary cool-
ant will not dilute the enrichment of the lithium, which would make such leaks pro-
hibitively expensive to rectify. The salt has a melting temperature near 400C, so
the intermediate system, like the primary system, must be heated.

2011).

of the overall AHTR design and economics (Holcomb et al., 2011a, b; 2012).
13.2.4
FHTR—MIT
The fluoride-salt-cooled high-temperature test reactor (FHTR) is a test reactor
design that will enable development and demonstration of a commercial FHR, cur-
rently being studied at MIT, and details for its goals, requirements, ownership,
design, and licensing are laid out in a full report (Forsberg et al., 2014). A test reac-
tor is required to demonstrate technical viability, provide data required for design
and licensing of a precommercial demonstration plant, provide operational and
maintenance experience, and provide a test bed for alternative fuels, fluoride salt
coolants, and other systems.
An FHTR would be a government owned Class I-A reactor to allow for opera-
tional and design flexibility, and to provide a demonstration, since development is
beyond the timeframe of private investment.
Most likely funding options come from a joint partnership with China to jointly
develop a small FHTR in China, or from a US-led international consortium to
reduce the financial risks for each partner, and also to widen the support from inter-
national partners.
Some of the main design features of an FHTR are:
G
Core design. The reactor core has driver fuel and a flux trap in the center experimental
hole to enable high thermal fluxes for fuel tests. The fuel blocks can be assembled in a
variety of configurations to meet experimental needs.
G
Fuel assembly. The fuel assembly is a prismatic block similar to that used in the Ft. St.
Vrain HTGR. This is a proven HTGR fuel that allows three-dimensional variations in enrich-
ment and particle packing fractions to meet neutron flux design goals. The assembly design,
termed fFuel inside radial moderator, places fuel compacts and cooling channels inside a
region of solid graphite moderator. The solid graphite regions introduce spatial self-shielding
of the fuel resonances, increasing the resonance escape probability of the neutrons born in
fission, which in turn increases core reactivity. It also implies that the smaller test positions
inside a single assembly have a relatively hard neutron flux for accelerated materials testing.
G
Coolant salt. The FHTR is designed to operate with four different coolant salts from
7Li2BeF4 (FLiBe) to NaF-ZrF4 coolant salt. The NaF-ZrF4 has the lowest cost but poor-
est neutronic and thermal hydraulic behavior. FLiBe has the best neutronic and thermal
hydraulic behavior but is more costly because of the need to enrich 7Li. The expectation
is that the FHTR over its operational lifetime would operate on four different salts as part
of its test program.
Fig. 13.6 shows a top-down view of an FHTR core and inner/outer radial reflec-
tors, alongside a standard fuel assembly.
13.2.5
TMSR-SF—CAS
The SF-TMSR is the solid fuel variant of the molten salt reactor program at
SINAP. A 2-MWth test reactor, with capability for expansion to 10 MWth, is
444
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

currently under development and will be built in Da Feng city, 250 km from
Shanghai. The test reactor has fixed ordered lattice pebble fuel (Chapter 17:
Thorium molten salt reactor nuclear energy system (TMSR)).
13.3
Plant-level features
Generation IV reactors all have a combination of novel features, such as modular
construction, rail transportability, and seismic isolation techniques, that are not
present in current Generation II reactor designs and started to first appear on some
Generation III and III 1 reactor designs.
The trend to modularization was adopted by the Westinghouse AP1000, in which
factory prefabricated modules, consisting of steel plates and additional structural
elements such as tie rods and stiffening elements, which are delivered to the site,
assembled into larger, crane-liftable modules, which are then installed and filled
with concrete. This type of construction technique is different to the traditional
stick-build, in which all construction work is performed on-site from the ground up.
The purpose of modular construction is to cut down on construction time and cost
by transferring part of the construction process to a factory setting in which highly
repetitive tasks can be automated or performed in a controlled environment. By the
time the order book reaches “nth-of-a-kind,” where tooling and supply chains are in
place, quality issues are ironed out, and vendors and contractors are far along the
assembly and construction learning curve. Modular construction thus lends itself
better to SMRs, similar to the Mk1 PB-FHR and SmAHTR described above, rather
than larger gigawatt-class reactors simply because there are more identical modules
to produce per unit of power output.
Figure 13.6 Top-down view of FHTR core and inner/outer radial reflectors, and a standard
fuel assembly (Forsberg et al., 2014).
445
Solid fuel, salt-cooled reactors

This then leads to the next novel feature of SMRs—rail transportability. The
Mk1 PB-FHR is designed so that all components—including the reactor vessel, GT,
and building structural submodules—can be transported by rail, enabling modular
construction. The design constraint of rail transport limits the width of components
(laid down to be horizontal) to 3.6 m; this result constrains the Mk1 reactor vessel
size and thermal power to a value that matches well to the largest rail-shippable
GTs now commercially available. Similarly, both the SmAHTR and AHTR are
designed for modular construction, with large components being shipped in smaller
rail-shippable modules and welded on-site or at a local workshop. Rail transport-
ability has less of a siting restriction than with barge shipment.
Finally, seismic base isolation is being explored for all FHR variants. Seismic
base isolation uses specialized structural elements to substantially decouple the sub-
structure from the superstructure of the building and the severity of seismic ground
motions. Bellows in the intermediate loop of the AHTR and the air ducts of the
Mk1 PB-FHR will also accommodate some lateral ground motion and thermal
expansion.
13.3.1
Less developed designs, and longer-term features
Alternative fuel types and coolant selections have been proposed, but much less
design work has been done to date with these alternative choices. Clad fuel can be
an alternative to ceramic encapsulated fuel. The current LWR program on accident-
tolerant fuel could yield cladding concepts that are compatible with molten fluoride
salts—such as SiC cladding, or stainless-steel alloys that are sufficiently stable in
fluoride salts. The interest in exploring other fuel types is to increase the power
density by using a fuel form that allows for higher heavy-metal loading.
Alternative coolant choices have been explored that do not breed tritium, and
that eliminate beryllium. The downside of moving away from beryllium and lithium
salts is a fuel utilization penalty, and a design challenge to ensure that the core has
a negative temperature reactivity coefficient. There might also be a slight penalty
on the thermal-hydraulic performance of fluoride-salt mixtures other than FLiBe,
an increase in vapor pressure, and a change in the corrosion behavior of metal
alloys and ceramics.
Lastly, the current upper temperature limit of operation is bounded by currently
available structural materials that are compatible with fluoride salts: SS 316 and
Hastelloy N. Should the code case for these materials be extended to allow opera-
tion above 700C, and transients above 800C, then FHRs could operate at higher
power conversion efficiency. Composite and ceramic structural materials are also
under development, and under testing for compatibility with molten fluoride salts.
These could extend the temperature limit to over 800C.
Very small reactor concepts, in the range of 10 MWe, for deployment to remote
mining sites or military operations may opt to use one of these alternative features,
accepting higher fuel and capital costs for a reactor that is easier to transport and
operate.

13.3.2
Inherent safety features and passive safety systems
The nuclear industry’s strong safety record can be further enhanced by inherent
safety features of FHR design and by passive safety features in Generation IV
reactors.
The coolant should prevent fuel overheating and transport heat to the energy
conversion system. FHRs use FLiBe coolant because it has attractive properties
compared to water, helium, sodium, and other coolants. FLiBe operates at nearly
atmospheric pressure. It has a high volumetric heat capacity (the product of density
and specific heat capacity)—higher than that of water—and can transfer more heat
with a smaller coolant inventory than water. Thermal transients are very slow,
allowing the operators hours or days to respond to transients that may otherwise
take minutes or hours to unfold in a water-cooled reactor. The large graphite inven-
tory in FHRs also has large thermal inertia, thus behaving as temporary heat sinks
during thermal transients, and leading to very slowly evolving transients.
FLiBe is also highly chemically nonreactive with most fission products of con-
cern and has a high boiling point, making it a good radioisotope barrier. Most fis-
sion products are soluble in the salt over a broad temperature range, which includes
normal operating temperature and accident temperatures. Only a few fission pro-
ducts, once in contact with the fluoride salt, remain in a chemical form that is gas-
eous, namely xenon, krypton, and possibly tritium (depending on the chemical state
of the salt, tritium can convert to tritium fluoride, which would have a higher solu-
bility in the salt than molecular tritium).
In gas-cooled reactors that use the same fuel type as FHRs, air ingress at high
temperatures can lead to graphite oxidation by air, which is an exothermic reaction.
Molten fluoride salt covering the graphitic fuel and the graphite blocks, topped by
an inert cover gas, serves as a barrier for air ingress.
Coolant inventory is ensured through inherent features in the mechanical design
of the primary circuit. The reactor vessel is designed with penetrations only at the
top of the core. All instrumentation and control rods feed through the upper lid of
the core. The lowest elevation penetrations on the reactor vessel are for the cold leg
and the hot leg feeding the external heat exchangers. In the event of a break in the
primary coolant circuit outside the core, the coolant surface remains above the in-
core decay heat removal heat exchangers, and above all graphite blocks. In the event
of a break in the reactor vessel, salt will leak in the narrow space between the reac-
tor vessel, and a steel-lined reactor cavity. The volume of this space is designed to
be small enough such that the fault level of the coolant in the core will still be suffi-
cient to ensure coverage of the graphitic fuel spheres, and of the graphite blocks.
The coolant in FHRs is not pressurized, so there is no source of stored (explo-
sive) energy. Lacking coolant volatility, high pressure, and any source of chemical
stored energy, FHRs cannot generate significant pressure inside their containment,
except by the small pressure changes due to cooling gases in the reactor cavity. The
pressure is controlled by a cover gas handling system inside the low-leakage con-
tainment boundary, which has a much larger total volume than the volume of gas
inside the reactor cavity.
447
Solid fuel, salt-cooled reactors

The FHR fuel has a high temperature margin to failure, and the TRISO fuel par-
ticles have multiple barriers for radioisotope retention: the fuel kernel retains acti-
nides, the silicon carbide layer retains fission products, and the inner pyrocarbon
layer retains gaseous fission products. The subsequent barrier to release of radionu-
clides is the coolant.
FLiBe is transparent in its liquid phase, which allows for easy visual inspection,
as opposed to liquid metals, which are opaque at operating temperatures.
The Mk1 FHR uses eight cylindrical buoyancy-driven control rods to maintain
constant power during normal operation. The rods are weighted to be neutrally buoy-
ant in FLiBe at 615C and contain natural boron carbide and are clad with either
316SS or CFRC. Any transient that raises the temperature of the coolant in the chan-
nel above the 615C neutral buoyancy value causes the rod to insert passively and
thus provide thermal negative reactivity to reduce or maintain stable power. This is
in addition to the strong negative reactivity feedback of the coolant and fuel. Under
off-nominal or accident conditions crucifix reserve shutdown blades are gravity-
driven directly into the pebble core to shut down the reactor.
Fluoride-salt coolants have very effective natural circulation heat transfer. Salt
density differences due to temperature differences between a heat source (the core),
and an elevated heat sink (heat exchanger at higher elevation) induce a natural cir-
culation flow, which is used to remove decay heat from the core without the need
of active pumping or external power. Several natural circulation loops are designed
within the FHR system to provide redundant means of decay heat removal. The nat-
ural circulation decay heat removal system activates itself passively, if a loss of
forced circulation (LOFC) occurs. The Mk1 FHR is also equipped with a forced
circulation loop for decay heat removal.
Fluoride salts also have the inherent feature of establishing buoyancy-driven
natural convection paths, driven by local temperature gradients. This makes salt-
cooled systems resilient to the formation of local hotspots or coldspots. For
example, this feature in a pebble bed core drives self-mixing. In a decay heat-
scenario, coolant gradients that would be B 50C without buoyant mixing drop to
a few degrees Celsius. This protects the fuel from high peak temperatures, and it
also protects the outlet mixing plenum from thermal gradients due to nonisothermal
flow. If the coolant leaked into the space between the reactor vessel and the reactor
cavity, natural convection paths will self-establish to transport heat from the core to
the walls of the reactor cavity. The steel-lined reactor cavity is passively and
actively cooled.
Initial scoping studies showed that under severe transients average fuel tempera-
tures remain below 800C. Anticipated transients without SCRAM, which rely on
temperature reactivity feedback to shutdown and on natural circulation for decay
heat removal, will not reach temperatures sufficient to cause fuel failure or damage
to metallic structures in the PB-FHR primary system (Andreades). It is a unique
characteristic of FHRs that there are no postulated severe accident transients that
can lead to core damage or fuel failure. This characteristic of FHRs is enabled by
inherent features of the solid-fuel coolant combination, and the design passive
safety systems that rely on the advantageous physical properties of the coolant.

13.4
Phenomenology unique to FHRs
FHRs exhibit different thermal hydraulic, neutronic, and structural mechanics phe-
nomena compared to conventional reactors, and to more extensively studied
advanced nuclear reactor concepts. They use a novel combination of fuel, coolant,
and materials: graphite-matrix, coated-particle fuel; fluoride salt coolant; graphite
moderator materials; and high-temperature metallic structural materials. A detailed
discussion of key thermal hydraulic, neutronic, material phenomenology unique to
FHRs can be found in Zweibaum et al. (2014).
13.5
Thermal-hydraulics
Thermal hydraulic phenomenology unique to FHRs include the use of a high
Prandtl number coolant, potential for freezing during overcooling transients, bypass
flow due to swelling or contraction of graphite blocks in the core, radiative heat
transfer due to high operating temperatures, and establishment of effective natural
circulation for passive decay heat removal.
A major part of modeling efforts for FHRs so far has been scaled experiments
using the principles of similitude, maintaining certain nondimensional parameters
of interest between the scaled and prototypical systems. Water and heat transfer oils
can be used as liquid salt simulant fluids and they provide the tremendous advan-
tage of low-distortion thermal-hydraulic experiments at significantly lower tempera-
tures, reduced size, and reduced thermal power input. The cost is also reduced
compared to constructing facilities at prototypical operating conditions. The pri-
mary experimental facilities devoted to this effort are currently at the University of
California Berkeley, the University of New Mexico, Ohio State University (OSU),
and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Other experimental facilities are found

at ORNL and the SINAP, the two major research institutions developing molten
salt reactor technology for FHRs.
13.5.1
University of California, Berkeley (UCB) facilities
UCB has constructed experiments to research key thermal hydraulic phenomenol-
ogy of FHRs using separate and integral effects test facilities. For safety and
licensing purposes for PB-FHRs, it is important to accurately model the heat
transfer coefficient between fuel pebbles and the FLiBe coolant in order to better
estimate temperatures in a PB-FHR core. UCB has been performing scaled
pebble-bed heat transfer experiments using simulant oils that match key nondi-
mensional parameters for FLiBe. Using temperatures throughout a scaled pebble-
bed test section along with other experimental parameters, the interfacial heat
transfer coefficient can be extracted as a function of position within the bed and
time. The scaled pebble-bed test section is shown in Fig. 13.7. Experimental heat
transfer coefficients for this scenario have also been derived using experimental
data outside the Mk1 PB-FHR’s characteristic conditions. There is significant dis-
agreement between the established correlations and the experimental ones, prov-
ing that it is important to perform tests and develop new correlations in the
appropriate Re and Pr range.
UCB designed the first iteration of the compact integral effects test (CIET)
facility (CIET 1.0) to reproduce the response of FHRs under forced and natural
circulation operation. CIET 1.0 provides validation data to confirm the predicted

(Andreades).

performance of the DRACS in FHRs. The facility has two coupled flow circuits:
the primary coolant flow circuit, which replicates the main and bypass flow paths
shown in Fig. 13.8, and the DRACS circuit. The two flow circuits exchange heat
through the DRACS heat exchanger (DHX). The facility uses Dowtherm A as a
simulant fluid for FLiBe, at reduced geometric and power scales. Test loops for
CIET 1.0 were fabricated from thin-walled (schedule 10) 304 SS pipe and butt-
welded fittings to minimize the mass and thermal inertia. The favorable power
scaling with oil (10 kW into oil being equivalent to 625 kW into FLiBe), along
with the simplicity of the construction for low-temperature operation, compared
to the complexity and safety requirements for tests with the prototypical salts and
other prototypical reactor coolants, were a key element enabling the CIET 1.0
facility to be constructed at lower cost than previous IETs for other reactor
classes.
Because the designs of FHR commercial prototype reactors will evolve, inherent
distortions will exist between the CIET 1.0 facility and future FHR commercial pro-
totype reactors. For a transient response, such distortions may arise from unmatched
coolant residence times between future FHRs and CIET 1.0 subsystems, as well as
the use of reduced flow area SS piping with unscaled thermal inertia in CIET 1.0.
CIET 1.0 was based on the earlier design of a 900-MWth channel-type pebble-bed
advanced high-temperature reactor (PB-AHTR), and the preconceptual design of a
236-MWth Mk1 PB-FHR was completed after scaling and design of CIET 1.0 were
already finalized; but elevations of the main heat sources and sinks in CIET 1.0 and
the Mk1 PB-FHR design reveal a reasonable agreement between the scaled model
and prototype. Therefore, CIET 1.0 will provide useful validation data for integral
transient behavior of a generic set of FHRs. Given the low cost of the CIET facility,
final code validation for a future commercial prototype plant would likely include
construction of a new CIET-type loop scaled to closely match the prototypical
design. All instrumentation, as well as the computer-controlled power supply and
VFDs are integrated through the LabVIEW software and manually or automatically
controlled from a central computer station. Fig. 13.9 shows the computer-aided
design rendering of the CIET 1.0 loop and the actual facility.
Figure 13.8 FHR primary coolant flow paths for forced and natural circulation operation.
451
Solid fuel, salt-cooled reactors

Between 2011 and 2014, CIET 1.0 was designed, fabricated, filled with
Dowtherm A oil, and operated. Isothermal pressure drop tests were completed,
with extensive pressure data collection to determine friction losses in the system.
CIET-specific friction loss correlations were compared with handbook values, and
empirically measured values were implemented in the system codes that are to be
validated by CIET data. The project then entered a phase of heated tests, from para-
sitic heat loss tests to more complex feedback control tests and natural circulation
experiments. In parallel, UCB has been developing thermal hydraulic models to
predict FHR steady-state characteristics and transient response for a set of reference
licensing basis events (LBEs). The general strategy is to rely on existing general-
purpose thermal hydraulic codes with a significant V&V basis for design and
licensing by the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), such as RELAP5.
Validation data will include steady-state forced and coupled natural circulation data
in the primary loop and the DRACS loop, and thermal transients data (e.g., startup,
shutdown, LOFC with scram, and loss of heat sink (LOHS) with scram) (Zweibaum
et al., 2015).
13.5.2
University of New Mexico (UNM) facilities
Due to the high volumetric heat capacity of fluoride salts, FHR heat exchangers
commonly operate in the transition and laminar flow regimes where heat transfer

coefficients can depend strongly on Reynolds number (Re) and potentially on
Grashof
number
(Gr).
Several
reduced-scale
experiments
investigating
heat
exchanger phenomenology for FHRs are currently underway at UNM. A multiflow
regime heat transfer loop, shown in Fig. 13.10, has been constructed for use with
Dowtherm A to collect data and validate current heat transfer correlations (or
develop new, when necessary) for several promising heat exchanger concepts. In
parallel, a simple water loop investigating hydrodynamics was constructed and has
been testing directional heat exchanger concepts for the DHX, which have the
potential to help minimize parasitic heat losses during normal operation of the plant
and enhance heat extraction during accidents.
The heat transfer loop was initially designed to test bayonet-style heat exchan-
gers, which are inserted into the FHR coolant pool from the top and feature both
the secondary (tube-side) feeder and outlet tubes attached to the top of the heat
exchanger. Validation data will be collected for two conventional bayonet-style

configurations: plain tubes and twisted tubes. Twisted tubes are a particularly prom-
ising technology to the development of the FHR due to their enhanced heat transfer
and their self-supporting design, which eliminates the need for baffles and reduces
hotspots and tube vibration.
The loop will be able to match shell-side Re and Pr for the primary-to-DHX,
and have the capability to test a range of Gr, and by extension, Rayleigh (Ra) and
Richardson (Ri) numbers, owing to the flexibility of the temperature conditions.
The same plain and twisted tube bayonet heat exchangers will also be tested in a
novel directionally enhanced shell concept. Because the DRACS is passive and
always operating, heat is perpetually being removed from the primary coolant
through the DHX. These parasitic heat losses lower the effective reactor outlet
temperature during normal operation, reducing the efficiency of the FHR. The
hydrodynamics of a directional DHX have been empirically investigated using a
simple water loop with promising initial results. The design will be further opti-
mized with computational fluid dynamics, and the resulting shell design will be
implemented in the heat transfer loop and tested with the plain and twisted tube
bundles.
Finally, the loop will be configured to test a double-wall twisted-tube heat
exchanger. Due to the relatively large quantity of tritium generated in FHRs and the
high operating temperature (which accelerates tritium transport), the use of double-
wall heat exchangers with an intermediate fluid, such as lithium, to capture the tri-
tium is under consideration. By using a twisted outer tube, it is possible to take
advantage of the higher shell-side heat transfer coefficients and more uniform shell-
side flow while also enhancing heat transfer to the intermediate fluid flowing in the
annulus. Two configurations will be tested at UNM: a double-wall exchanger with
inner plain tube/outer plain tube and a double-wall exchanger with inner plain tube/
outer twisted tube to determine the heat transfer enhancement possible with the
twisted-tube version (Zweibaum et al., 2015).
13.5.3
Ohio state facilities
A high-temperature DRACS test facility (HTDF) that is being constructed at The
OSU is shown in Fig. 13.11 (in red), along with the low-temperature DRACS test
facility (LTDF) that is currently in operation (Fig. 13.11 in gray). Both the HTDF
and LTDF are scaled down from a 200-kW prototypic DRACS design for a pebble
bed reactor design by following a rigorous scaling analysis. The HTDF employs
FLiNaK and KF-ZrF4 as the primary and secondary coolants, respectively. With
the HTDF, the DRACS capability of removing decay heat under prototypic reactor
conditions can be evaluated.
The HTDF will be fully instrumented with gauge pressure transmitters to moni-
tor the cover gas pressure in all the salt tanks, capacitance level sensors to monitor
the tank salt levels, and thermocouples (N-type) to measure/monitor the salt tem-
peratures along the loop, and in the tanks. High-temperature clamp-on ultrasonic
flow meters from Flexim will measure the flow rates. ORNL will use the same
454

type flow meters at temperatures up to 700C. For the differential pressure mea-
surement, in-house designs utilize commercial differential pressure transmitters,
which will require accurate control of the saltAr interface in the pressure-sensing
lines.
The LTDF uses water as both the primary and secondary coolants. The LTDF is
intended to examine the couplings among the natural circulation/convection
loops, to provide OSU experience before building the HTDF. A vertical inline recir-
culation pump in the loop simulates the intermediate heat transfer loop, enabling
experimental study of the pump trip process.

Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)
The Liquid salt test loop facility at ORNL supports the development of the
fluoride-salt-cooled high-temperature reactor concept. It can operate at up to
700C and incorporates a centrifugal pump to circulate FliNaK salt through a
removable test section. Inductive heating heats the test section, facilitating
heat transfer testing. An air-cooled heat exchanger removes the added heat.
Loop infrastructure includes a pressure control system, a trace heating system,
and instrumentation to measure salt flow, temperatures, and pressures around
the loop.
The goals of this facility (shown in Fig. 13.12) include providing operational
knowledge and equipment to test high-temperature salt systems, developing a non-
intrusive inductive heating technique for thermal/fluid experimentation, measuring
heat transfer characteristics in a molten salt-cooled pebble bed, and demonstrating
the use of silicon carbide as a structural material for molten salt systems (Lv et al.,
2015).

ORNL, the location of the MSRE project, can provide legacy data for verifica-
tion of experimental data and validation of computer models.
13.5.5
Shanghai institute of applied physics (SINAP)
The TMSR-SF1 is an experimental test reactor designed to enable the development
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Thorium Molten Salt Reactor (TMSR) solid
fuel molten salt reactor (also referred to as an FHR). The purpose of this test reactor
is to verify the feasibility and safety of the solid fuel molten salt reactor concept,
and to enable the subsequent design and licensing of a demonstration commercial
reactor design by providing a comprehensive experimental platform. The TMSR-
SF1 adopts a conservative design approach, where reactor safety is the primary con-
sideration in the design, taking into account the basic research capabilities.
SINAP has designed and built several test loops to support their development
process. The three principal loops at SINAP are the HTS Test Loop, FLiNaK Test
Loop, and FLiBe Test Loop. The purpose of these loops includes experience with
the experimental method, design, and construction of molten salt loops; thermal
hydraulics of molten salt; the development of equipment to operate and measure
the salt loop properties; and the exploration of chemistry issues for molten salts that
include fluoride and beryllium.
The TMSR-SF0 is an electrically heated simulator for solid fuel molten salt reac-
tors. Its primary functions are:
G
To provide data and experience to support TMSR-SF1 licensing;
G
To provide practical experience for TMSR-SF1 design, start up, operation, and
maintenance;
G
To verify TMSR-SF1 thermal-hydraulic design, safety programs, and other technical prob-
lem solutions;
G
To test SF1 equipment;
G
To simulate SF1 start up, operation, accident conditions, and maintenance.
TMSR-SF0 will also provide experimental evidence for verification and valida-
tion for solid fuel molten salt reactor thermal hydraulics and safety analysis codes.
Based on the above considerations, the TMSR-SF0 is designed as a full-scale, 1:1
geometrically scaled simulator for the TMSR-SF1. The key materials, technologies, and
equipment used in the SF0 have the same design with SF1, and the plant layout is also
basically the same. The main differences between the SF0 and SF1 are that SF0 graphite
fuel pebbles are not loaded with nuclear fuel, the coolant is heated by electrical heating
elements with a total power greater than 1 MW. The electrical heating is currently
expected to use heating rods installed in channels in the graphite reflector. In addition,
FLiNaK is used as the primary salt instead of FLiBe to avoid the safety issues of beryl-
lium. Taking into account the needs of thermal-hydraulic experiments and the low radia-
tion levels, the SF0 core and loop have more instrumentation. In addition, the loop has a
flow control valve and shut-off valves to facilitate experiments. For long-term develop-
ment considerations, SF0 will include pebble fuel recirculation test equipment.

13.5.6
Pebble dynamics and fuel handling
One FHR option is annular graphite pebbles with embedded TRISO fuel, as in the
UCB Mk1 FHR preconceptual design. The X-Ray Pebble Recirculation Experiment
(X-PREX) at UCB seeks to demonstrate the viability of pebble fuel handling and
reactivity control for FHRs. The research results should clarify understanding of
pebble motion in helium-cooled reactors and of low-velocity granular flows. Pebble
fuels enable on-line refueling, operation with low excess reactivity, simpler reactiv-
ity control, and improved fuel utilization. If fixed fuel designs are used, the power
density of salt-cooled reactors is limited to 10 MW/m3 to obtain adequate duration
between refuelings, but pebble fuels allow power densities in the range of
2030 MW/m3, much higher than the typical modular helium reactor 5 MW/m3.
Pebble fuels also permit radial zoning in annular cores, use of thorium or graphite
pebble blankets to reduce neutron fluences to outer radial reflectors, and increase of
total power.
The X-PREX facility uses novel digital X-ray tomography methods to track
both the translational and rotational motion of spherical pebbles, which
provides unique experimental results that can be used to validate discrete
element method (DEM) simulations of pebble motion. The validation effort
supported by the X-PREX facility provides a means to build confidence in
analysis of pebble bed configuration and residence time distributions that
impact the neutronics, thermal hydraulics, and safety analysis of pebble bed
reactor cores.
Fig. 13.13 provides a view of the facility. Further information can be obtained
from Laufer and Buster (2015).

13.6
Chemistry and corrosion control
Compatibility and chemical control of nonuranium-bearing salts with structural materi-
als is a key issue. There have been some primary corrosion experiments under static
and dynamic conditions, but standardization of data sharing is needed for accurate
comparison of materials and salts. Metallic structural materials, such as Hastelloy-N,
are not yet code-qualified under the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. High-
temperature phenomenology, such as long-term creep deformation, is important.
Compatibility of carbon and ceramic composite materials with fluoride salts also needs
investigation (Chapter 7, Materials and Chapter 8, Chemical processing of liquid fuel).
13.7
Neutronics
In FHRs, the fuel is lumped in tiny TRISO particles that are dispersed in a graphite
matrix of fuel pebbles or plates. A spherical fuel element is shown in Fig. 13.14.
FHR cores present unique challenges for both deterministic and Monte Carlo
approaches, due to the double heterogeneity (fuel elements in coolant, and TRISO
particles within a fuel element).
Double heterogeneity makes it difficult to model and requires methods different
from those used for a typical LWR fuel. Monte Carlo codes, such as MCNP and
Serpent, can model the particles and pebbles explicitly without distortion introduced
by any homogenization processes. Combined with DEMs, fuel kernel locations can
be modeled as randomly distributed as they are manufactured. But various studies

459
Solid fuel, salt-cooled reactors

show that models with ordered structure such as simple cubic, body-centered cubic,
or face-centered cubic, give accurate results as long as the moderator to fuel ratio is
preserved. The stochastic nature of Monte Carlo neutron transport method provides
great flexibility in modeling complex geometries. However, an explicit full-core
simulation can be computationally challenging and sometimes prohibitive to
achieve accurate statistics. Deterministic codes need the effective homogenized
cross-sections because a simple volume-weighted homogenization would underesti-
mate the resonance self-shielding effect. In order to treat this effect correctly, vari-
ous cross-section homogenization methods have been developed for media
containing randomly and uniformly dispersed particles.
13.8
Tritium management
Tritium (3 H or T) is produced as a neutron activation product of the FLiBe primary
coolant. Neutron reactions with 6Li and 7Li produce tritium, and neutron reactions
with 9Be produce 6Li. The dominant source of tritium production is 6Li, with only
small contributions from 7Li. The natural isotopic abundance of 6Li is 7.5%, and
for FHR operation, it is reduced to hundreds or tens of ppm, by isotopic enrichment.
Lithium isotopic enrichment reduces tritium production, and also improves the neu-
tronic performance of the coolant, and hence fuel utilization. Therefore, the FHR
coolant is most correctly denoted as 2 7LiF-BeF2. 9Be is the only stable isotope of
Be, and the beryllium natural isotopic composition is 100% 9Be.
Tritium production rates in the FHR primary coolant, and production rates in pri-
mary coolants of other types of reactors are:
FHR ! 2,000,000 Ci/year/GWe 5 5500 Ci/day/GWe 5 200 g T/year/GWe ! from 6Li,
7Li, and 9Be in the coolant (at steady state 4 ppm 6Li, and 60% power conversion effi-
ciency) (Cao, Gerczak, Kelleher, & Zheng, 2013; Fratoni & Greenspan, 2011; Young,
Wu, & Scarlat, 2015);
PWR ! 20,000 Ci/year/GWe 5 50 Ci/day/GWe 5 2 g T/year/GWe ! from 6Li, 7Li, 10B,
and 11B in the primary coolant water, used form chemistry control and chemical shim
(Weaver, Harward, & Peterson, 1969);
BWR ! 0.1 Ci/year/GWe 5 0.3 mCi/day/GWe 5 0.01 mg T/year/GWe ! from 2H in
the primary coolant (Weaver et al., 1969);
CANDU ! 1,400,000 Ci/year/GWe 5 3,800 Ci/day/GWe 5 150 g T/year/GWe ! from
2H in the heavy water moderator (Management of Waste Containing Tritium and Carbon-
14, 2004);
HTGR ! HTGR ! 5000 Ci/year/GWe 5 14 Ci/day/GWe 5 0.5 g T/year/GWe ! from
3He in the coolant, and 6Li and 7Li in the graphite moderators (Management of Waste
Containing Tritium and Carbon-14, 2004)
Another interesting point of reference for the tritium production rate of FHRs is
to consider that tritium could be used as fuel for a D-T fusion reaction. Given that
the energy yield is 17.6 MeV for the D-T fusion reaction, and assuming a 50% power
conversion efficiency, the tritium production rate from 1 GWe of FHR-produced
electricity would supply the fuel for about 10 MWe to be produced by a D-T fusion
reactor. Finally, it is worthwhile to note that natural sources of tritium production on
460
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

Earth are estimated at 48 MCi/year, so 1 GWe from FHR plants would produce
one half to one quarter of the natural global tritium production rate (Jacobs, 1968).
NRC and EPA established regulatory limits for tritium concentration in air and water
effluents (0.1 pCi/L for air, 1 μCi/L for water), but they do not specify cumulative
tritium emission limits (Forsberg et al., 2003; Sabharwall et al., 2013). In the absence of
regulatory guidance on cumulative tritium emissions from power plants, the design goal
of the FHR is to limit the tritium emissions to the emission rates of a PWR. In the
United States the PWR emissions rates are reported by the NRC to be 700 Ci/year/GWe
as liquid effluents (equivalent to 0.024 mol T/yr/GWe) (Forsberg et al., 2003), so
the design goal is to recover 99.9% of the tritium produced in an FHR (Casino, 2006).
In the first few years of operation with fresh salt, the tritium production will be
higher due to a higher fraction of 6Li. How much higher will depend on the initial
isotopic enrichments of Li in FLiBe, which is an expensive process, and therefore a
question of economic optimization, depending on the effectiveness and availability
of the tritium management systems that will be implemented in the FHR. At startup,
an initial 6Li percentage of 0.005% corresponds to a tritium production rate of
0.11 mol/EFPD (Peterson and Zhao, 2006). As the initial 6Li is consumed, its con-
sumption rate eventually equilibrates with its production rate from 9Be to a 6Li iso-
topic composition of 4 ppm (Fei et al., 2008), and the tritium production rate
reaches a steady-state value at 0.023 mol T/EFPD (Casino, 2006). The time to reach
steady-state tritium production is a function of the total inventory, in-core and out
of core, of primary coolant, and for Mark 1 FHR, it is on the order of 2 years of
full-power operation. The tritium production rate against time for the Mk1 design is
shown in Fig. 13.15. This figure was modified from a figure in FHR (2013) to
account for the power density and salt inventory differences between the 236 MWth
Mk1 design and the 900 MWth PB-FHR design; the Mk1 design has an active core
power density of 23 MW/m3, and primary salt inventory of 47 m3 (Casino, 2006).

Solid fuel, salt-cooled reactors

The initial chemical form of tritium in FLiBe is TF, as it is produced by trans-
mutation of Li, which is present in the FLiBe in the chemical form of LiF. TF can-
not permeate metal barriers easily, but at high temperature T2 and HT easily
permeate metallic heat exchangers, escaping from the primary coolant circuit to the
power conversion cycle (Krumwiede et al., 2013). The redox control system in the
salt prevents corrosion of structural steels by TF and leads to the formation of T2
(Scarlat and Peterson, 2014), but, at FHR temperatures, T2 is highly permeable
through metal heat exchangers (Scarlat and Peterson, 2014). The chemical equilib-
rium ratio between T2 and TF will be set by the redox potential of the salt, which is
maintained by the chemical control system at a value that prevents the metallic
alloys and the graphite from corrosion; most of the tritium is expected to be in the
form of T2, with a nonzero concentration of TF also present. The chemical form of
tritium also depends on the amount of H2 in the FHR system. With H2 in the sys-
tem, HT will be selectively produced, instead of T2. However, based on the current
status of the FHR design, it is not expected that appreciable quantities of H2 will be
in an FHR system.
13.8.1
Tritium sinks
The sources and sinks for tritium in the primary coolant loop of an FHR are shown
in Fig. 13.16. Under FHR operating temperatures, the hydrogen isotopes have low
solubility in fluoride salt and high permeability through metallic alloys. Therefore,
the tritium concentration in the salt needs to be kept low to limit tritium release
through the salt-to-air metallic heat exchangers to the power conversion cycle and
eventual tritium release to the atmosphere. Tritium has low solubility in FLiBe salt
and it can rapidly diffuse through metals at high temperature (Greene et al., 2010;
Malinauskas and Richardson, 1974). Tritium permeation barriers are being consid-
ered to reduce tritium permeation through coiled-tube air heater (CTAH) tubes
(Casino, 2006). Without permeation barriers, tritium transport through the CTAH is
a mass-convection limited process (Krumwiede et al., 2013; Holcomb et al., 2011).
Figure 13.16 Tritium sources and sinks in the FHR primary coolant loop.
462
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

Effective tritium permeation barriers will increase the tolerable concentration of tri-
tium in the salt, while still meeting the target air emission rates of tritium through
the CTAH. A high target concentration of tritium in the salt makes it easier to
design tritium sinks and separation systems to clean up the salt upstream of the heat
exchangers.
Several types of tritium sinks have been proposed for the primary system: solid
getters, permeators, gas spargers, and vacuum disengagers. Solid getters are high
surface-area solid materials that have high affinity and trapping capability for tri-
tium at high temperatures. Graphite is one such material that is under investigation
because it is known to chemically trap tritium, at small concentrations, at high tem-
peratures. The fuel elements of FHR consist of a graphite matrix, which is being
evaluated for its effectiveness to absorb tritium from the salt; other graphite types
are being evaluated for ex-core absorption of tritium from the salt. Permeators are
high surface area systems that extract the tritium from the salt by permeation
through a metal; they would need to be designed to compete in mass transport
effectiveness with CTAH. They can be standalone systems, or integrated with
CTAH, in double-walled heat exchangers with an intermediate sweep gas. Gas spar-
gers rely on generating a high mass-exchange surface area between a sweep gas
and the salt; there is ongoing research on the optimization of bubble generation in
the salt, and on ultrasonically enhanced mass transfer in gasliquid tritium separa-
tors. Vacuum disengagers spray small droplets of molten salt into a vacuum
chamber, where the tritium desorbs and is pumped away (Dolan et al., 1992).
13.8.2
Tritium mass transport in the primary coolant circuit
Without permeation barriers, tritium transport through the CTAH is a mass-
convection limited process (Krumwiede et al., 2013; Holcomb et al., 2011).
Because heat generation in FHRs occurs in solid fuel, rather than in the primary
salt, FHRs have much larger graphite surface areas than the MSRE and MSRs in
general. To achieve the FHR tritium recovery goal of 99.9%, the permeation bar-
rier system in the primary heat exchangers must reduce tritium releases through
the primary heat exchanger tubes by a factor of 200, or a factor of 100 consider-
ing additional graphite surface area provided in the primary heat exchanger hot
manifold pipe annular cartridges. Experimental studies and additional analysis to
determine whether the necessary mass transfer resistance can be achieved are
needed, to select a specific coating method and to determine whether the Mk1
PB-FHR tritium control system is capable of achieving its tritium control target.
Further work to study this question will be important to perform as the FHR
design is refined.
13.8.3
Tritium absorption in the fuel elements
Upstream of the metallic heat exchangers, a large surface area of removable graph-
ite components is in contact with the primary coolant: fuel pebbles, graphite peb-
bles, and inner reflectors. Because heat generation in FHRs occurs in solid fuel,
463
Solid fuel, salt-cooled reactors

rather than in the primary salt, FHRs have much larger graphite surface areas than
MSRs in general. For comparison, the surface area of salt-to-air heat exchangers is
B10,000 m2, and that of the removable graphite components is B2000 m2
(Andreades et al., 2016). If graphite exhibits appropriate tritium retention character-
istics, tritium can be recovered by taking advantage of the removable graphite
components that are part of the reactor core. Therefore it is important to character-
ize the diffusion and chemical trapping kinetics of hydrogen on graphite material at
high temperatures (600800C), low tritium partial pressures at the graphite
surface (a few to tens of Pa), and low tritium loading in the graphite materials
(a few ppm).
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the fuel elements as a tritium sink, we
need to know the maximum hydrogen absorption capacity of the graphite fuel ele-
ments, and the mass transport rate from the salt into the graphite. Neither of them is
well characterized. Posing the question backwards, we can calculate a desired T/C
loading at the end of the fuel life.
Assuming a tritium absorption rate in the fuel elements and graphite reflector
pebbles equals the tritium generation rate and the residence time of a fuel element
in the core, and the parameters given in Table 13.2, we calculate the tritium concen-
tration in the fuel element to be 2 μg T/g C. If the fuel elements and graphite reflec-
tor pebbles are recirculated through the core several times before discharge at 1.4
effective full-power years, and there is a tritium removal step before reintroduction
to the core, then this estimated tritium per carbon loading could be lower by a
factor of a few.
Saturation conditions of tritium in graphite vary greatly by experimental condi-
tion, but a reasonable estimate is on the order of tens of wppm T/C. Data on tritium
saturation in nuclear graphite are available from MSRE (Forsberg et al., 2014;
Zweibaum et al., 2014), fusion reactors (Zweibaum et al., 2015; Lv et al., 2015;
Laufer and Buster, 2015; Malinauskas and Richardson, 1974), gas-cooled reactors
in the UK (Adams, 1994; UC Berkeley Thermal Hydraulics Laboratory, 2013), and
the very high-temperature reactor (VHTR) (Nie et al., 2013) research activities. A
review of this literature is presented here and experimental values are summarized
in Table 13.3. It should be noted that experimental results vary greatly for the type
of graphite and appear to be strongly dependent on porosity (Forsberg et al., 2014).
This data do indicate that the 2 wppm tritium loading at fuel discharge might be
achievable, and the graphite fuel elements remain a candidate for the primary
tritium sink in the FHR system.
We cannot quantify the mass transport resistance due to diffusion within the fuel
element because fundamental work for the characterization of tritium diffusion and
trapping within the graphite matrix is lacking. However we can estimate the mass
transfer resistance due to convection from the bulk of the coolant to the surface of
the fuel elements. We perform here calculations for a pebble bed. Using the same
assumptions as above, we calculate the bulk concentration of tritium in the salt that
would be necessary to drive mass convection to the surface of the pebbles to be (2)
1026 mol/m3; using a Henry’s law solubility coefficient of (5)1025 mol/L-atm, this
concentration corresponds to 4 Pa T2 in the cover gas. This is the minimum bulk
464

concentration of tritium in the salt that will drive tritium to the surface of the peb-
bles at a rate that balances generation in the coolant. To this, the additional mass
transport resistance due to diffusion of tritium into the graphite will need to be
added; we do not know yet which one of these transport resistances is dominant.
Even though the hydrogen isotope transport mechanism in nuclear graphite has
not been fully understood, and the graphite matrix has not been investigated yet,

there are some experimental results for nuclear-grade graphite. The main tritium
transport mechanism in graphite is expected to be Knudsen diffusion in open pores,
which is characterized by molecular diffusion through the interconnected pores in
graphite (Forsberg et al., 2003). Intragranular bulk diffusion within the graphite
grains is also possible. Lastly, interstitial diffusion within the graphite crystallites is
possible, but unlikely to dominate (Petti, 2014). Table 13.4 summarizes the avail-
able data for overall bulk diffusion of hydrogen in nuclear graphite at high
temperature.
Most of the data summarized above are for unirradiated graphite material. There
are two neutron irradiation effects that are expected to affect tritium transport in
graphite. (1) The intragranular diffusion coefficient initially decreases with small
damage levels, and then increases past approximately 0.2 dpa in isotropic graphites
(IG-110U, IG-430U) (Lv et al., 2015). This behavior is attributed to the saturation
of trapping sites and either a decrease in crystallite size or newly introduced path-
ways from microcracks (Lv et al., 2015). (2) Tritium retention in trapping sites
increases (Lv et al., 2015; Laufer and Buster, 2015). Kanashenko et al. (1996)
reported that irradiation above 1 dpa causes an increase in Trap 1 and 2 sites to
1500 and 5000 appm (Laufer and Buster, 2015). Atsumi found that the amount of
hydrogen retained increases by a factor of about 100, where the intragranular diffu-
sion and retention in Trap 1 sites significantly increases with irradiation as shown
in Figs. 13.17 and 13.18 (Lv et al., 2015).
Further studies of the ability of the graphite matrix fuel elements to serve as an
effective in situ tritium sink need to investigate (1) limits on the tritium retention
capability of the graphite matrix, (2) transport and trapping mechanisms into the
graphite matrix, (3) better characterization of mass convection in the salt at the pro-
totypical conditions in the core, (4) the role of the saltgraphite interface and the

Safety analysis and licensing strategy
Performing a safety analysis and developing a licensing strategy for the FHR is a
key step in the commercialization path. A primary focus is identifying high-level
functional requirements of major FHR systems, structures, and components (SSCs);
and how to identify a range of LBEs that should be considered in design and in the
developments of modeling tools and supporting experiments, including a discussion
of lessons from the Fukushima Daiichi accident for severe external beyond design
basis events (BDBEs).
13.9.1
Safety design criteria, strategies, subordinate goals
Four white papers issued after the four FHR expert workshops held in 2012 outline
the novel aspects of FHR technology and propose a technology development path.
The initial drafts of the white papers were prepared before the respective workshops
by graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, and the comments of the experts
attending the workshops were subsequently integrated. The experts who attended
the workshops represent industry, academia, and national laboratories.
For FHR design and safety analysis, six high-level safety design criteria (SDC)
based on earlier work by the NGNP and PBMR projects provide an appropriate
framework to guide the design of safety-relevant FHR SSCs: SDC 1—Maintain
control of radionuclides; SDC 2—Control heat generation (reactivity); SDC 3—
Figure 13.18 Hydrogen retention with graphite damage (Zweibaum et al., 2015).
468
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

Control heat removal and addition; SDC 4—Control primary coolant inventory;
SDC 5—Maintain core and reactor vessel geometry; SDC 6—Maintain reactor
building structural integrity.
The NRC has extensive experience reviewing liquid metal reactor (LMR) tech-
nology. Publications such as the NRC preliminary safety evaluation report of the S-
PRISM design are highly useful in identifying technical gaps in key FHR technolo-
gies that are shared with the LMR (Adams, 1994). Additionally, the American
Nuclear Society (ANS) has created a safety standard for FHRs, ANS 20.1, which
will provide the basis to develop consensus-based FHR-specific general design
criteria, to be used in licensing reviews.
13.9.2
Licensing experience from liquid metal
and gas-cooled reactors
One of the key elements on the development and deployment path of any advanced
reactor, and thus also the FHR, is the licensing by the host country’s nuclear regula-
tor. The nuclear regulator focuses on the safety of the plant personnel, the general
public, and the environment. There have been advanced reactor designs that have
undergone review by the US NRC, such as LMRs and PBMRs that have significant
overlaps with the FHR and can provide guidance in the licensing approach and
process, but also demonstrate gaps that need addressing.
For the FHR, a system decomposition scheme, presenting key constituents and
material selection options, and identifying functional requirements for key subsys-
tems, fits within an overall framework to guide the design and licensing efforts. A
set of six design criteria are proposed as the top level safety requirements for
FHRs, and defense-in-depth strategies for meeting each of the requirements are sug-
gested. Likewise, the white paper proposes an initial set of LBEs and system oper-
ating states to be used in developing safety systems designs and models for FHRs.
This information can be found in extensive detail in a UCB white paper discussing
the topic (UC Berkeley Thermal Hydraulics Laboratory, 2013).
FHR fuel is similar in nature to the one used by the NGNP. An NGNP fuel qual-
ification white paper provides a detailed review of the current regulatory basis for
licensing coated-particle fuels in cladding USNRC regulatory, policy statements,
guidance documents, and licensing precedents from earlier US HTGRs; summarizes
existing understanding, date and analysis methods regarding coated-particle fuel
performance; reviews fuel designs and resulting fuel service conditions and perfor-
mance requirements; and recommends an approach for qualification of NGNP fuel.
These existing NGNP capabilities are important to the development of similar
coated-particle fuels for FHR. A major benefit of the high particle powers used in
FHRs, and of continuous fuel circulation, for pebble fuel, is that the fuel reaches
full discharge burnup rapidly, typically in around 1 year for FHR pebble fuels.
Therefore, the time to develop, test, and qualify new fuels for FHRs has the poten-
tial to be much shorter that for typical reactors, whose fuel reaches full discharge
burnup in 46 years.

Solid fuel, salt-cooled reactors

In terms of structural materials, there are three categories: metallic structure and
components, ceramic structures and components, and building structures. For chem-
istry and corrosion control simplicity, a single metallic alloy should be selected for
all metallic materials contacting the coolant salt. Building structures will be made
of steel-plate/concrete composites, similar to the AP-1000 LWR, several of which
are currently under construction (Nie et al., 2013; Varma et al., 2014).
13.9.3
Severe accidents source term
Existing risk-informed approaches for identifying anticipated operational occur-
rences and design basis events can be readily informed event categories, the LBE
selection process must develop a set of plausible initiating events based on a combi-
nation of informed judgment and a hierarchical system decomposition to develop
failure modes for major reactor systems. Subsequently, the conceptual design-phase
probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) suggested for FHRs would categorize events
based on the anticipated frequency using assigned, rather than observed, system
reliability requirements. The assigned frequencies translate to functional require-
ments for the subsystem performance; functional requirements are instrumental in
guiding future design development, and documenting the assumptions on which the
current analysis is based.
The approach to identifying BDBEs and assessing the ability of an FHR to
respond to and mitigate consequences of BDBEs requires further development, par-
ticularly because the high thermal margins of FHR fuel suggest that these reactors
can be designed to have a very robust and effective response to BDBEs even when
they result in extensive plant damage. The possible elimination of offsite conse-
quences appears to be unique to the combination of fuel and coolant in FHRs and
merits consideration. A set of bounding event categories that should be evaluated
for specific FHR designs is listed below:
1. Unprotected overpower events;
2. Station blackout;
3. Protected LOHS with additional failure of safety-related heat removal system;
4. Unprotected LOHS;
5. Protected LOFC with additional failure of safety-related heat removal system;
6. Unprotected LOFC;
7. Large loss of primary coolant (e.g., vessel rupture);
8. Severe overcooling transient;
9. Flow blockage (fixed fuel design only);
10. Failure of hold-down structures;
11. Severe external events.

Summary
FHRs are a Generation IV fluoride salt-cooled, solid-fueled, high-temperature reac-
tor class currently under development in the United States and China, by both

research institutions and universities. The concept of an FHR was generated by try-
ing to integrate advantages of other reactor classes (low pressure, high temperature,
high efficiency) while eliminating some of their drawbacks (huge containment
domes, low efficiencies). Fixed fuel and pebble fuel, SMRs, and gigawatt reactors
are being studied.
FHRs feature both inherent and engineered safety features. The primary coolant
brings inherent features. FLiBe has a high volumetric heat capacity, leading to high
thermal inertia and slowly evolving thermal transients. FLiBe is at near atmospheric
pressure, and thus has no stored chemical energy (no exothermic reactions) and no
mechanical energy (no high pressure, and large margin to coolant-boiling). FLiBe
is transparent and allows for optical inspection (unlike liquid metal coolants).
FHRs are designed using defense in depth. FHRs are designed to have both neg-
ative temperature and coolant voiding reactivity coefficients. TRISO fuel has two
barriers against fission product release. FLiBe serves as a barrier to radioisotope
release, having high solubility for fission products and very low vapor pressure
(,20 Pa at 700C). Natural circulation cooling to air as the ultimate heat sink
provides a means for passive decay heat removal. Finally, buoyancy-driven control-
down rods are employed to moderate power.
Several experimental facilities have been constructed and are under fabrication to
study phenomenology unique to FHRs. Natural circulation loops using simulant
fluids, natural circulation loops at prototypical conditions, salt purification techni-
ques, in core irradiation experiments of salts and structural components are all taking
place at several research institutions to study phenomenology applicable to FHRs.
Performing a safety analysis and developing a licensing strategy for the FHR is
a key step in the commercialization path. A primary focus is identifying high-level
functional requirements of major FHR SSCs; and identifying a range of LBEs that
should be considered in design and in the developments of modeling tools and sup-
porting experiments, including a discussion of lessons from the Fukushima Daiichi
accident for severe external BDBE.
FHRs are a promising reactor technology for the needs of a future electrical grid
with highly fluctuating solar and wind power. FHRs might also serve as a stepping
stone to liquid fuel molten salt reactors, helping to understand phenomenology and
engineering issues prior to having fuel and associated fission products present in
the primary coolant.

14.1
Pumped versus static fuel molten salt reactor
Molten salt-fueled nuclear reactors were first conceived of in the United States in
the aftermath of the Manhattan project as part of a program to develop a nuclear-
powered strategic bomber. The first design concept considered was a simple one.
Instead of putting solid uranium metal or oxide fuel into metal tubes to form fuel
pins, as in conventional reactors, the project team proposed putting molten salt fuel
into the tubes (Briant, 1950).
This concept survived less than a year. It was known that molten salts had low
thermal conductivity and simple calculations showed that conduction alone could
only transfer sufficient heat out of the molten salt fuel if the tube diameters were
kept below 2 mm. This was seen as quite impractical, leading to the concept being
abandoned.
Although it was well known, even in 1950, that conduction was far less impor-
tant to heat transfer in fluids than convection, the impact of convective heat flow

on heat transfer out of the molten fuel was never considered. Two factors were
probably behind this omission.
Firstly, the techniques of computational fluid dynamics had not been invented.
That happened in the 1970s. There was no way short of building physical models to
work out how much of an impact convective heat transfer might have. Secondly,
and perhaps decisively, the project was aimed at producing an aircraft engine which
would inevitably be subject to strongly varying “g” forces which would make con-
vection very unreliable.
The project team accordingly adopted a different strategy whereby the molten
fuel salt was rapidly pumped around a circuit between a reaction chamber, where it
achieved criticality, and a heat exchanger where the heat produced was removed.
The rapid flow of the fuel salt resulted in turbulent mixing which provided effective
heat transfer independent of gravity and convection. This design was the basis for
both the Aircraft Reactor Experiment and Molten Salt Reactor Experiment
(MSRE), which were both successfully operated, as described in Chapters 1,
Introduction and 11, Liquid fuel, thermal neutron spectrum reactors.
That same design principle has been embedded in every conceptual design for
molten salt reactors devised in the last half century. The original decision to ignore
convection as a heat transfer mechanism, which was entirely valid for an aircraft
engine, was never reconsidered in the context of ground-based nuclear reactors,
where convection would be a highly reliable process.
In 2013 we re-examined the contribution of convective heat transfer in molten
salt nuclear fuel using computational fluid dynamics codes and established that fuel
rods containing molten salt fuel could operate at similar power densities as conven-
tional solid fuel rods. This chapter summarizes those findings and explores the
potential that the discovery unlocks for new, much simpler, safer, and cheaper mol-
ten salt-fueled reactors.
14.2
Potential advantages of static fueled reactors
“Conventional” pumped fuel salt reactors require relatively complex engineering
which can be eliminated in static fueled reactors. This is summarized below.
14.2.1
Pumps and valves
Pumps and valves capable of handling hot molten salts are practical, though chal-
lenging from a materials point of view. The major challenge for pumps however is
reliability and maintenance. The fuel salt passing through the pump is extremely
radioactive. The decay heat level is about 7% of the full power level so for a reactor
operating at a typical power level of 200 kW/L of fuel salt, there is about 14 kW of
decay heat per liter, of which a substantial fraction is in the form of gamma radia-
tion. No human entry into the reactor area containing the pipework carrying the
fuel salt will be possible. The fuel salt is also a relatively intense neutron emitter.
Approximately 0.4% of neutrons produced during fission are “delayed” and a
476
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

significant portion of those neutrons will be emitted in the piping system outside
the reactor core and will activate the metals forming that pipework. Therefore, even
if residual fuel salt is flushed from the pipework with “clean” molten salt, human
handling of the pipework will probably not be permitted—and an entire extra
plumbing and clean up system for the “clean” salt would be required.
The upshot is that regulators would be likely to require an entirely remotely
operated system to remove and replace any component of the fuel salt circuit. That
system itself would be required to have an extremely high level of reliability since
it would not be possible to carry out maintenance on those parts of the system
within the reactor radiation field.
Static fuel salt systems entirely eliminate these challenges as set out in detail below.
14.2.2
Fuel salt leaks
Regulators would assume that any fluid circulation system could at some point
leak. Leakage of fuel salt would be an extremely hazardous event due to its very
high radioactivity. The oft-repeated claim that leaks would simple freeze does not
stand up to even a cursory examination. A fluid generating heat at about 14 kW per
liter will not freeze. Even after 24 hours the decay heat will still be 1 kW per liter.
There is instead a high probability that leaked fuel salt forming a layer more than
about 1 mm thick on concrete would actually evaporate, spreading the radioactive
products to condense on every surface they reach.
Accordingly, designers would need to provide a data-supported safety case
showing that the frequency of leaks over the entire life of the reactor would be
essentially zero. Producing data to support such a safety case would be challenging,
given the lack of experience in pumped molten salt systems.
Static fuel systems are inherently much less prone to leaks since the fuel salt is
held under no pressure in simple tubes. In the extremely unlikely event of a leak,
the leaked fuel salt would mix with the coolant salt outside the tube, contaminating
it but safely containing and diluting the leaked fuel salt while retaining it within the
reactor vessel.
14.2.3
Heat exchangers
High-efficiency heat exchangers are essential in pumped molten salt reactors to
minimize the fuel salt volume outside the core and hence the delayed neutron frac-
tion lost to the core. That requires thin-walled heat exchangers and the materials
challenges of achieving such thin walls are considerable, given the known corrosion
potential of molten salts. Heat exchanger failure could result in serious contamina-
tion of the secondary coolant circuit and systems to prevent this would be required.
The heat exchangers would become radioactive due to contamination by the fuel
salt and due to neutron activation of their structural materials. Replacement or
maintenance of the heat exchangers would be subject to the same challenges as for
the pumps and valves.
The primary heat exchanger in a static fueled system is the fuel tube. It experi-
ences low flow rates on both sides and no pressure differences. Tube walls do not
477
Static liquid fuel reactors

have to be extremely thin since heat transfer is not limited by heat conduction
through the wall (see Section 14.3). Most importantly, the fuel tubes are consum-
able items in such a reactor and therefore do not have to be certified for lifetimes in
excess of the refueling frequency.
14.2.4
Drain systems
Pumped fuel salt reactors have, at any one time, about half of their fuel in the core.
With a heat production in the core of about 200 kW/L of fuel the rate of fuel circu-
lation to the heat exchangers has to be very rapid. The EVOL reactor, for example,
circulates its entire 18 m3 fuel volume every 4 seconds (Heuer et al., 2014). In the
event of pump failure, the core is rapidly rendered subcritical either by control rods
or by thermal expansion of the fuel salt. Decay heat is still being produced however
at an initial rate of 7% which corresponds to a temperature rise of about 12C per
second. Very rapid and completely reliable systems to drain the fuel salt into a con-
figuration where it is both subcritical and effectively cooled are therefore essential.
It is commonly said that passive “freeze valves” permit this but a robust case to
prove the speed and reliability of any such system would be required—the 1030
minute thaw time achieved for freeze valves in the MSRE (Briggs, 1965) would be
unlikely to be adequate for a full-scale reactor. Failure of the drain system would
be a major incident, resulting in rapid overheating of the fuel salt to the point where
its containment would fail. Systems to ensure safe drainage of fuel salt released
from any point in the fuel salt circuit into a cooled passively safe and subcritical
location would be essential.
The system furthermore must allow the drained fuel salt to be pumped back into
the reactor, a further level of plumbing complexity.
In a static fuel salt system, no drain system is required. Fuel salt in the fuel tubes
is continuously cooled by the reactor coolant which can continue circulating by nat-
ural convection in the event of pump failure and reactor Safety Control Rods
Activation Method (SCRAM).
14.2.5
Noble metal filtration system
A substantial fraction of fission products are noble or seminoble metals which are
insoluble in the salt. These metals precipitate on surfaces with which they are in
contact. In a pumped system it is essential that such metals are removed before they
can deposit in vulnerable locations within the fuel circuit—pumps, valves, and nar-
row channels in heat exchangers would be particularly dangerous places for the
metals to accumulate.
Two systems have been proposed to do this in conventional pumped molten salt
reactors.
First is sparging of the fuel salt with helium which causes much of the noble
metals to accumulate at the surfaces as foams. These foams then have to be
removed, separated into solid, liquid, and gas components and the gas and solid
components removed from the reactor for disposal while the liquid is returned to
the reactor.
478
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

Second is continuous filtration of the fuel salt through metal filters where the
noble metals deposit. The highly radioactive filters must be replaced periodically,
using remote operation as their location will not be accessible to humans.
In a static fuel salt system, the noble metals can be simply allowed to deposit on
the inner walls of the tubes where they will cause no problems.
14.2.6
Gas handling system
Fission produces relatively large amounts of radioactive gases, primarily the noble
gases xenon and krypton but also volatile zirconium salts and iodine compounds.
These gases must be removed from the fuel as it circulates. Many reactor designs
remove the gases by sparging the fuel with a continuous stream of helium. This is
highly effective at removing volatile species but requires both a system to defoam
the resulting gas stream and a system to manage the radioactive gas stream and
radioactive solids stream. In the MSRE a large fraction of the very hazardous fis-
sion product iodine was never accounted for and may have been vented with the
off-gas stream (Compere et al., 1975).
Static fueled reactors can simply permit fission gases to vent from the fuel tubes
into the coolant salt. If the fuel salt chemistry and redox state is properly controlled,
these vented gases are radiologically benign and require no special collection or
treatment (see Section 14.5).
14.2.7
Chemistry control and refueling
The chemical composition of fuel salt evolves during use. Production of gases and
noble metals has been covered above. The other major changes are the production
of neutron-absorbing fission products, the depletion of fissile isotopes. and the net
release of halogen from fission of actinide halides. The first two result in reductions
in core reactivity, the last results in extreme corrosion of metals.
Most molten salt reactor designs incorporate a relatively complex chemical engi-
neering system to continually process the fuel, adjusting the redox potential, remov-
ing fission products, and adding additional fissile materials. None of these chemical
engineering systems has been developed to the functioning prototype stage.
In a static fueled reactor such a processing system is impractical, but the chal-
lenges of the evolution of the fuel must still be met. This is achieved as follows.
Loss of reactivity is countered exactly as in conventional solid-fueled reactors
by replacement of spent fuel assemblies with fresh ones.
Net halogen release is countered by including a sacrificial metal inside the fuel
tube which scavenges any excess halogen and maintains the fuel salt in a strongly
reducing state. Details of this are given in Section 14.4.
14.2.8
Summary
It is clear from the analyses above that static fueled molten salt reactors have the
potential to be intrinsically safer, simpler, and therefore cheaper and easier to
achieve regulatory approval than pumped fuel salt systems.
479
Static liquid fuel reactors

The remainder of this chapter analyses whether these theoretical advantages are
in fact achievable and then suggests reactor designs leveraging these advantages.
We start with the fundamental question of whether effective heat transfer from
static fuel in tubes does in fact take place.
14.3
Convective heat transfer in molten fuel salt
The majority of molten salt reactor designs use salt mixtures based on LiF in order
to achieve low melting points. This carries a substantial penalty. Lithium has to be
isotopically purified to be substantially free of the 6Li isotope because that isotope
has a very high neutron capture cross-section and will poison the reactor. There is
no commercial source of pure 7Li and the process used in the United States to sepa-
rate lithium isotopes for the H bomb project left the site so badly contaminated
with 100200 tonnes of mercury that it is today a “superfund” site.
Even more critical is that, even after isotopic purification, lithium salts generate
substantial tritium on neutron irradiation. Tritium in molten salts readily diffuses
through metals (Mays et al., 1977) making an effective tritium removal system
essential in any reactor utilizing lithium salts. This adds cost and complexity and
creates a volatile radiological hazard in the reactor complex.
Accordingly, the fuel salt selected for computation fluid dynamics calculations
was a chloride salt mixture of 40% UCl3/60% NaCl. The physical properties of this
fuel salt mixture are given in Table 14.1, which also summarizes the other system
properties. The vertical variation in heat production in the tube was derived from
MonteCarl N Particle (MCNP) calculations on a model reactor core comprising an

Prof. Tim Abram, both of Manchester University (UK).
The analysis was undertaken using ANSYS CFD tools (V15.0): Design Modeler
for geometry preparation; ANSYS Meshing; and ANSYS Fluent for preprocessing
and solving. Some quantitative results were obtained directly from Fluent; others
from expressions calculated in ANSYS CFD-Post (the postprocessing tool), which
was also employed to generate all contour and streamline plots. This work was car-
ried out by Simon Leefe and Peter Jackson-Laver of Wilde Analysis Ltd, a profes-
sional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) consultancy.
Fig. 14.1 shows the relationship between the maximum temperature reached in
the hottest part of the fuel salt at different average power levels and with different
diameters of fuel tube. Fig. 14.2 shows the relationship between maximum fuel salt
temperature, maximum fuel tube wall temperature, and maximum coolant salt tem-
perature for 10 mm diameter tubes at varying power levels.
Two key conclusions can be drawn from these simulations.

Firstly, that it is possible to achieve power densities over 200 kW/L, higher than
those in a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) core (B100 kW/L) while keeping the
fuel salt comfortably below its boiling point.
Secondly, that even with peak fuel salt temperatures approaching boiling point, the
fuel tube wall experiences temperatures only marginally higher than those of the cool-
ant salt. The reason for this is that the heat transfer process from the fuel salt to the
tube wall is many times less effective than that from the fuel tube wall to the more rap-
idly moving coolant salt. This latter finding has a substantial impact on the range of
materials that can be considered for the fuel tubes, as is considered in the next section.
14.4
Fuel tube materials
Conventional wisdom in molten salt reactor designs is that special, corrosion-
resistant, alloys such as Hastelloy N are required to contain the fuel salt. In the
static fuel salt system this challenge had the potential to be compounded by the
high peak temperatures in the fuel salt, which are higher than temperatures gener-
ally considered for molten salt reactors.
As set out in the previous section, the high peak temperature of the fuel salt is
no more relevant than is the high temperature at the center of conventional solid
uranium oxide fuel pellets. That high temperature does not lead to high tempera-
tures for the tube containing the fuel. Accordingly, from a temperature perspective
it is not necessary to use refractory materials such as molybdenum or ceramics for
the tubes. Standard steels would be quite adequate.
Corrosion of the tube material by the molten fuel salt is a more difficult chal-
lenge. Experience from the MSRE showed that the major corrosion mechanism was
leaching of chromium from the alloy (Williams et al., 2006). Hastelloy N, a rela-
tively low-chromium alloy, was developed to minimize this effect—though corro-
sion still occurred leading to questions over long-term use.
Corrosion by molten salt fuel is driven by a number of factors. Probably the
most critical is that the mechanism by which metals typically become resistant to
corrosion (formation of passivating oxide or other layers) does not operate in mol-
ten salts because they effectively dissolve such layers. Corrosion is thus essentially
thermodynamically driven. If the thermodynamics of the system permit a compo-
nent of the alloy to dissolve in the molten salt then it will do so. Corrosion rates
then become controlled by how fast the susceptible metal can migrate to the
exposed surface of the alloy. Formation of cracks and pits greatly facilitates this
process with particularly rapid corrosion occurring at alloy grain boundaries.
There are multiple potential sources of corrosion in the molten salt:
G
The intrinsic corrosion due to the pure salt;
G
Additional complexity due to fission products, especially tellurium, which will react with
metals in the alloy causing embrittlement;
G
Net release of halogen from the actinide halide salt due to fission products having a lower
average valency than the actinide;
482
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

G
Contamination of the fuel salt with oxygen from oxides or traces of air or water;
G
For chloride fuel salt, formation of sulfur as a chlorine neutron activation product.
Fortunately, all of these factors can be simultaneously analyzed using modern
thermodynamic software which, via Gibbs free energy minimization, calculates the
equilibrium composition of any mixture of elements or compounds. Outotek HSC
Chemistry v7 was used in the current studies. Such thermodynamic analysis pro-
vides a “worst-case” corrosion picture representing the state when sufficient time
has elapsed for the system to reach equilibrium. A result showing that corrosion
can happen thermodynamically does not necessarily mean that corrosion will actu-
ally happen fast enough to be a problem. However, a result showing that corrosion
cannot happen thermodynamically can be relied on.
Fig. 14.3 shows the thermodynamic equilibrium level of CrCl2 in a simulated
fuel salt consisting of 60 mol% NaCl and 40 mol% UCl3 in which 5 mol% of the
uranium has fissioned releasing 10 mol% fission products and 15 mol% chlorine.
This salt is in contact with a metal phase containing elements (treated as an ideal
solid solution) in the proportions of Hastelloy N or stainless steel Nimonic PE16,
which is a widely used structural steel in nuclear reactor cores. PE16 has an excep-
tionally low swelling behavior in high neutron fluxes, which makes it ideal for use
in the fuel tube (Special Metals, 2004).
There is clearly potential for substantial dissolution of chromium, even from
Hastelloy N. This is primarily a consequence of the net release of chlorine during
fission which renders the fuel salt strongly oxidizing. In conventional, pumped,
molten salt reactors there has to be provision for continuous online monitoring of
the redox state of the fuel salt with frequent chemical adjustments to maintain a
constant redox state. That is clearly not possible with the thousands of fuel tubes
that would be in a full-scale static molten salt reactor.
Fig. 14.3 also shows, however, the equilibrium level of CrCl2 in a Hastelloy N
or stainless steel fuel tube that contains a source of zirconium metal, as a coating
on the inside or as an inserted component. The presence of the zirconium drives the
redox potential to a strongly reducing state and reduces the chromium dissolution
from both alloys to less than 10 ppb—a level at which corrosion would be

undetectable. Addition of 0.1% oxygen to this system makes no difference whatso-
ever to the concentration of CrCl2—the oxygen is quantitatively converted to ZrO2.
Thus an entirely passive redox control system is easily incorporated into the fuel
tube. Note that a continuous film of zirconium is not required. This is not zirconium
shielding the surface from attack, it is zirconium controlling the fuel salt chemical
state.
The sacrificial zirconium has other significant benefits. Fig. 14.4 shows the fate
of tellurium fission product and sulfur from neutron activation of 35Cl in the pres-
ence of zirconium. Tellurium is quantitatively trapped as zirconium telluride. Thus
tellurium embrittlement of the steel alloys is prevented. Sulfur reacts primarily with
actinide and lanthanides forming sulfides. Notably, reaction of sulfur with the
metals of the alloy tubes is essentially prevented, avoiding the danger of sulfur-
driven corrosion of the tubes.
Control of fuel salt redox state by use of sacrificial reactive metals is by no
means a new idea. In common life, galvanizing steel with zinc is a similar process.
Protecting alloys from corrosion by contacting Lithium Beryllium Fluoride salt
(FLIBE) salt with beryllium metal was tested successfully in the MSRE (Keiser,
1977).
Use of this very simple technique in conventional pumped, fluoride-based mol-
ten salt reactors is however probably not practical. Similar thermodynamic calcula-
tions have been carried out for such fuel salts. Graphite has a strong potential to
react to form zirconium carbide, while uranium fluorides are reduced to uranium
metal. Even if a different, less reducing, sacrificial metal was used to avoid this
problem, migration of the sacrificial metal from hot to cool regions of the pumped
circuit, or, worse, galvanic transfer of the sacrificial metal, would risk fouling
pumps, valves, and narrow passages in heat exchangers. It must be emphasized that
a thermodynamic driver for a reaction taking place does not prove that it will hap-
pen rapidly enough to be a problem—however substantial experimental data under

the precise conditions of the reactor would be required to prove that kinetic stabili-
zation effects were sufficient to prevent the reaction. Producing these data would be
arduous and costly, especially since it is predicted theoretically and demonstrated
practically that ionizing radiation affects the reaction rates. Where the reaction can
be shown to be thermodynamically nonfavored, then concerns over corrosion or
other reactions are easily allayed.
The use of static molten salt fuel, in conjunction with sacrificial metals, thus
eliminates the need for active management of fuel salt chemistry, which is essential
in pumped molten salt reactors and which adds significant complexity to their
design, regulatory approval, and operation. It also permits the use of standard stain-
less steels such as PE16 with their extensive databases of function under reactor
conditions, thereby avoiding the need for complex, expensive, and time-consuming
nuclear certification for alloys which are not currently used in nuclear applications
(which include Hastelloy N).
Fuel salt is, of course, not the only molten salt for which resistant materials are
required. The coolant salt also contacts the outer surfaces of the fuel tubes as well
as many other reactor components. Permanently contacting the coolant salt with a
sacrificial metal would have similarly beneficial corrosion benefits as for the fuel
salt. However, migration and deposition of the sacrificial metal would be a signifi-
cant problem and would be expected to lead to deposition on the coolest surfaces
which would be in the heat exchanger. While that problem is probably not insupera-
ble and ideas to overcome it are proposed for the Fluoride-salt-cooled High-
temperature Reactor (FHR) concept, (Andreades et al., 2014), use of a ZrF4-based
coolant allows it to be side-stepped.
Zirconium forms two principal stable fluorides, difluoride and tetrafluoride.
Addition of small amounts of ZrF2 to the salt reduces its corrosion potential dramat-
ically, as shown in Fig. 14.5, which shows the equilibrium chromium fluoride con-
centration for pure coolant salt (42% ZrF4/10% NaF/48% KF), the same salt
contaminated with 0.1% oxygen and the contaminated salt containing 2% ZrF2.
Dissolved chromium concentration of less than 1 ppm guarantees virtually
undetectable corrosion. This would allow standard stainless steels to be used
throughout the reactor vessel.
14.5
Fission products and gases
Perhaps the defining advantage of molten salt fuel over solid fuels is the form that fis-
sion products take. Fission products are inevitable products in nuclear reactors but the
chemical form they take matters a great deal to the risks associated with such reactors.
This was dramatically shown at Chernobyl where a large fraction of the core iodine,
cesium, and tellurium was released, largely in airborne form, which spread for thou-
sands of miles, while a far smaller fraction of other nonvolatile fission products and
actinides were released mostly as larger particles concentrated around the reactor area
(NEA Committee in Radiation Protection and Health, 1995).

Static liquid fuel reactors

In any molten salt fuel, cesium is present not as the element (as it predominantly
is in solid fuels) but as cesium chloride or fluoride. Cesium metal has a boiling
point of just 670C and is highly reactive with air, forming oxide fumes. Cesium
halides are chemically stable and have boiling points above 1250C and are diluted
in the bulk molten salt where their vapor pressure is greatly reduced until tempera-
tures are even higher than this. From the perspective of cesium, any molten salt
fuel is thus far safer than a solid fuel under core damage conditions.
The form of iodine and tellurium in molten salt reactors can be less favorable.
While sodium iodide has a high boiling point, like the cesium salts, iodine can form
volatile species in molten salts of which the most important are the tellurium
iodides. Molten salt reactors where the fuel salt is constantly sparged with helium
pass much of the iodine and tellurium out in the waste helium stream where it must
be trapped and disposed of. This creates a hazard during normal operation greater
than the hazard in sealed solid fuel rods, though in an accident scenario the fact
that much of the iodine and tellurium have been removed from the reactor core
could be an advantage.
In static molten salt fuel tubes there are three options for managing gaseous fis-
sion products. Sparging each tube with helium is not practical, therefore the noble
gas fission products will simply bubble out of the fuel salt when they reach saturat-
ing concentrations, which takes about 20 minutes at typical fission rates. This gas
stream could be:
G
Allowed to accumulate in the sealed tube, though high pressures would then be created,
increasing the risk of tube rupture and fuel salt leakage;
G
Vented through a tubing system to a central collection and treatment facility, though such
a system would be complex and cumbersome;

G
Allowed to vent from the fuel tube directly into the coolant salt and hence to the gas space
in the reactor.
The last option has major attractions in terms of simplicity. It is not an original
idea for nuclear fuel rods, fuel rods used in the early days of the Dounreay
Experimental Fast Reactor used such vented tubes (Keilholst and Battle, 1969) but
the solid fuel pellets released volatile cesium and iodine into the coolant (molten
sodium) creating a safety and disposal hazard.
To establish whether such a vented tube system would be safe and practical in
static molten salt-fueled reactors, thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were car-
ried out on a model partly burned molten salt fuel similar to that described in
Section 14.3, with a focus on the composition of the gas phase present in the sys-
tem. An illustration of the fuel tube and gas venting apparatus is shown in
Fig. 14.6. The top of the tube is closed with a “diving bell” assembly which allows
gas to escape but prevents coolant entering the fuel tube. There is a gas space in the

tube above the hot fuel salt where the tube walls are cooled to the temperature of
the coolant, about 600C. Calculating the gas phase composition is therefore a two-
stage process.
First the composition of the gas actually released from the hot fuel salt is calcu-
lated. This gas rises in the form of bubbles formed in the fuel salt, primarily from
the noble gases, xenon and krypton. The temperature selected to define the compo-
sition of this gas was 1020C. This is a pessimistic (high) temperature estimate
since the noble gases have lower solubility at lower temperatures in molten salts
(Grimes and McDuffie, 1960) and will therefore form bubbles in the cooler regions
of the fuel salt. The high temperature and the assumption that the volatile fission
products in the molten salt fully equilibrate with the gas bubbles both represent
very conservative assumptions that will overestimate the amount of volatile fission
products in the gas.
The second stage is to allow this hot gas to condense on the cooler walls of the
fuel tube. The mean residence time of the gas in this space is many days (see
below) so full equilibration of the gas with the cooler tube wall is expected. This
final gas phase is what is vented from the “diving bell” gas venting system.
Fig. 14.7 shows the composition of the gas evolved from the fuel salt and its
composition after condensing at 600C. The fuel salt was in contact with sacrificial
zirconium in this simulation. Without the sacrificial zirconium there were high
levels of tellurium iodide and uranium tetrachloride in the gas phase, showing that
the sacrificial zirconium has very positive effects on the vapor produced from the
fuel salt in addition to its other benefits.
The gas stream from the fuel salt thus contains principally the noble gases with
substantial amounts of ZrCl4 and only traces of other compounds. Of particular
importance is the very low level of iodine compounds, representing just 0.001% of
the total produced.
The substantial amounts of ZrCl4 in the gas stream will contain radioactive iso-
topes of zirconium since, although much of the zirconium comes from the

sacrificial metal, some is formed as fission products. The preferred molten coolant
salt contains ZrF4 and KF (see below) which undergo neutron activation while pass-
ing through the reactor core. The ZrCl4 will readily dissolve in this coolant and the
additional radioactivity created in the coolant salt makes minimal difference to the
safety or disposal route for used coolant salt, given that it already contains radioac-
tive zirconium and chlorine (from activation of K) isotopes.
This leaves just the fate of the xenon and krypton to be considered. Both contain
radioactive isotopes and will not dissolve significantly in the coolant salt, instead
accumulating in the gas space within the reactor. Noble gases have rather low
radiological hazard levels since they readily disperse and are rapidly eliminated
from the human body even if inhaled. Indeed, 85Kr, which is the main radioactive
gas remaining in spent conventional nuclear fuel, is routinely discharged to the
atmosphere during fuel reprocessing operations. However, xenon isotopes can
decay to far more hazardous cesium isotopes and it is therefore a legitimate concern
that such cesium isotopes should not escape from the fuel tube indirectly via the
xenon precursor.
The fuel tube (see Fig. 14.6) can be considered to contain three separate reser-
voirs of gas—that dissolved in the fuel salt, that in the gas space above the fuel
salt, and that in the diving bell apparatus. Flow between these reservoirs is essen-
tially unidirectional, even allowing for diffusion in gases, due to the very small sur-
face area of the fuel salt in contact with the first gas space and the narrow long
tube separating the first gas space from the diving bell gas space. These gas spaces
can individually be considered to be well mixed since the mean time spent by gas
in each space before passing on is relatively long.
Flow of radioactive xenon and krypton through this series of gas spaces can
therefore be calculated based on the gas flow rate, the volume of the three gas
spaces, and the half-life of the isotope. The results are shown in Table 14.2.
Significant amounts of 133Xe, decaying to nonradioactive 133Cs, just 0.2% of 135Xe,
decaying to the very mildly radioactive 135Cs, and virtually none of the 137Xe
decaying to the dangerous isotope 137Cs are released from the fuel tube. The only
significant volatile hazard associated with the gases is therefore that of the noble
gases themselves. It is likely that it will be acceptable to allow those gasses to be
accumulated and decay within the reactor containment.

Static liquid fuel reactors

14.6
Static molten salt-fueled reactor options
Many reactor designs can be created utilizing the concept of static molten salt fuel.
Simple core designs with fuel tube assemblies immersed in coolant salt provide a fast-
spectrum reactor. Incorporation of moderating materials such as graphite or zirconium
hydride into the fuel assemblies or into the reactor core would allow thermal or
epithermal reactors to be designed. Use of a coolant salt based on thorium salts would
allow efficient breeding of fissile material from fast or thermal versions of the reactor.
Small modular versions of the reactor are also feasible, with the possibility of
entirely eliminating moving parts from the reactor tank by using a tall geometry
allowing natural convection of the coolant salt and/or achieving entirely passive
decay heat removal by natural air convection, greatly facilitated by the high operat-
ing temperatures of molten salt reactors.
Operation at lower power densities (B150 kW/L) where the average fuel salt tem-
perature during operation is within the acceptable range of coolant salt temperatures
(,850C) would allow control of reactivity of the core to be achieved merely by the
temperature of the coolant with maximum coolant design temperature corresponding to
a core being safely subcritical. That would permit passive load following operation of a
small modular reactor without any active intervention with reactivity control devices.
The ability of such a reactor core to tolerate substantial power density differ-
ences across the core would also open up the possibility of a long-life reactor core
requiring no refueling and relying solely on the consumption of burnable poisons to
maintain its reactivity as fuel was consumed.
Static molten salt-fueled reactors should therefore be seen as an entirely new class
of reactors. All of the reactor types described in Chapters 11, Liquid fuel, thermal neu-
tron spectrum reactors and 12, Fast spectrum, liquid fueled reactors have equivalents
based on static fuel salt, as indeed do most reactors designed for solid fuels. The fam-
ily of static salt-fueled reactors currently under development by Moltex Energy have
been named the Stable Salt Reactors, with the term “stable” reflecting both the stabil-
ity of the reactor core and the stability of the nonvolatile fission products.
Fast spectrum, thermal spectrum and thorium breeding Stable Salt Reactors are
now under development but the most advanced of these designs is a fast-spectrum
plutonium/higher actinide burning reactor, the Stable Salt Fast Reactor, which is
described in greater detail in Chapter 21, Stable salt fast reactor. This utilizes a
chloride-based fuel salt and a zirconium fluoride-based coolant salt and is the basis
for much of the quantitative analysis in this chapter.
Thermal spectrum versions of the Stable Salt Reactor do however bring their
own unique set of challenges which are summarized in the following section.
14.7
Thermal spectrum static molten salt reactors
Thermal neutron spectrum reactors could in principle use a similar fuel and coolant
salt system as that for the fast reactor. However, to avoid neutron poisoning by
490
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

chlorine-35 the chloride salts would have to be produced using isotopically purified
chlorine-37, which is not currently commercially available. The alternative is to use
fluoride salt fuel as well as coolant.
Use of fluoride salts instead of chloride salts as fuel brings two challenges.
First is their higher melting point. Eutectic mixtures of UF3/UF4/NaF have melt-
ing points in the range 623660C depending on the redox state of the uranium
fluoride. This would require a coolant with a minimum temperature of about
620C, which is comfortably within the range for ZrF4/NaF mixtures. Core output
temperatures of 700750C would then be required, which is just within the long-
term operating temperatures of stainless steels. Temperatures could, however, be
reduced by addition of RbF to the fuel salt which forms eutectics in the region of
535C, providing a substantial temperature margin.
The second challenge relates to the thermodynamic instability of UF3, which
undergoes disproportionation to uranium metal at higher temperatures. Pure UF3
cannot therefore be used as fuel and a redox state maintaining the UF3/UF4 ratio in
the salt at less than 1:1 is essential to avoid this. That makes use of sacrificial zirco-
nium metal not possible and a less reactive sacrificial metal must be used.
Chromium is in many ways the optimum choice, at equilibrium it maintains a UF3
fraction below 0.25 as net fluorine release during fission takes place.
Sacrificial chromium is, inevitably, less effective at preventing alloyed chro-
mium leaching from the structural metal than is zirconium. The thermodynamics
can nonetheless be made unfavorable for corrosion by two approaches. First is use
of pure chromium as sacrificial metal. Chromium in this state has a thermodynamic
activity roughly four times greater than alloyed chromium and will therefore be
preferentially attacked. Second is to place the sacrificial chromium as an insert in
the fuel tube rather than as a coating on the tube. Because temperatures in the fuel
salt are very much higher than the tube wall temperatures (see Fig. 14.2), the sacri-
ficial chromium will be at a much higher temperature than the wall and will accord-
ingly be substantially more reactive.
The consequence of these two factors is that there will be a net transfer of chro-
mium from the sacrificial chromium to all areas of the inner wall of the fuel tube,
thus effectively preventing corrosion.
There are also unique challenges for the coolant salt from operating in a thermal
spectrum. In the fast-spectrum reactor, the coolant salt contains ZrF4 from which
hafnium has not been removed. This has only a marginal effect on the core reactiv-
ity but makes the coolant a highly effective neutron shield. This allows a small
reactor size without exposing critical components, such as heat exchangers and the
tank wall, to high neutron flux.
In order to avoid using very large coolant pools (as are used for sodium-cooled
reactors) the coolant must be made neutron-absorbing. This can be achieved by
allowing tightly controlled levels of hafnium to remain in the zirconium salt.
Alternatively, the coolant can be based on ThF4 which provides both an excellent
neutron shield and a uranium-233 breeding blanket—though at the expense of con-
taminating the coolant salt with low levels of fission products produced by rela-
tively rare fast-neutron fissions of the thorium.

Static liquid fuel reactors

14.8
Fuel cycle for stable salt reactors
General discussions of the fuel cycles for molten salt reactors are covered elsewhere
in this book. There are however certain specific and very positive aspects of the fuel
cycle as required for Stable Salt Reactors and related static fueled reactor concepts.
The key to these positive aspects is that static molten salt fuel can tolerate quite
high concentrations of contaminating materials, in particular the lanthanides. This is
due to the similarity of melting point and hence miscibility of the lanthanide and
actinide trihalides.
This fuel salt formulation flexibility would thus allow, for example, a fuel salt
containing 60% NaCl and 40% of a mixture of PuCl3, UCl3, and mixed lanthanide
trichlorides in the approximate ratio of 2:1:1. Pyroprocessing of spent nuclear fuel
achieving such modest separations has already been demonstrated (Lee et al.,
2011). It is indeed plausible that a separation of spent nuclear fuel achieving
purities of that level with virtually complete retention of higher actinides, like
americium and curium, in the fuel could be achieved. This would result in an
actinide-free fission product waste stream, which would decay to a lower
radioactivity than the original uranium ore after just 300 years.
The main barriers to use of reprocessed fuel on a large scale in the nuclear indus-
try are the high costs of reprocessing to produce fuel of a purity compatible with the
use in ceramic or metal fuel forms, the high cost of precision manufacture of solid
fuels like Mixed Oxide fuel (MOX), and the reluctance to utilize a reprocessing
method that inevitably produces weapons-usable fissile material at some point in the
process. A simple pyro-processing system would avoid all three of those concerns
and could therefore be at the heart of a massive expansion of nuclear energy use.
14.9
Global mix of static fueled molten salt reactors
The various Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports strongly sug-
gest that unless the world substantially decarbonizes its energy economy by mid-
century there is real potential for very adverse climate consequences. China and India
will represent the largest new carbon emitters. While Europe and to a lesser extent the
United States can economically tolerate higher energy prices to achieve carbon reduc-
tion, poor nations would measure the consequence of higher energy prices in human
lives. A technological breakthrough making nuclear energy cheaper than fossil fuels is
the only realistic prospect of derailing the burgeoning fossil fuel burning bandwagon.
Many cost estimates for novel nuclear reactors exist in the literature, promising
lower capital cost. They are of highly variable credibility and often ignore the
unavoidable fact that engineering work in the nuclear industry inevitably costs
more than in other industries. The Stable Salt Fast Reactor has been developed to a
sufficiently detailed design stage that a credible, initial, rough order of magnitude
cost estimate could be produced. This project was carried out independently of the
reactor designers by a well-established nuclear engineering consultancy, Atkins
Ltd. This estimate was for an “nth of a kind” reactor but was for a single 1 GWe
492
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

power plant. No attempt was made to estimate the economies of scale available
from an increase to 23 GWe which is the planned size for other UK power sta-
tions. Even at those large scales, overnight costs for those generation III reactors
are stated as Bd5000 per kWe.
The estimated “most likely” overnight capital cost for the nuclear island of a
Stable Salt Reactor (comprising reactor building, emergency diesel generator build-
ings, control building, interim fuel storage building, and interim waste storage build-
ing) was d718 per kWe. The costs are expressed in UK pounds because the cost basis
was for UK construction—arguably the most expensive nuclear construction costs in
the world. The conventional island cost was d696 per kWe. Monte Carlo probability
analysis indicated a 90% probability of the combined cost being less than d1756 per
kWe. While some other site-specific costs must be added to this figure for a full plant
overnight capital cost, the Stable Salt Reactor is credibly substantially cheaper than
conventional nuclear and has clear potential to be able to generate power more
cheaply than coal since it has a similar capital cost and lower fuel cost.
This economic advantage could drive a massive increase in deployment of nuclear
energy. Moving from a world where 10% of electricity comes from nuclear to one
where most electricity is nuclear and nuclear is expanding in process heat applica-
tions carries significant challenges. Three factors in particular must be considered:
G
Sustainability of the fuel supply;
G
Increased weapons proliferation risk;
G
Management of hazardous waste.
A family of two designs of static fueled molten salt reactors might provide a
promising solution to these challenges. The first design is a global workhorse reac-
tor which would be a thermal spectrum thorium breeder. This design is less
advanced than the Stable Salt Fast Reactor, but the basic principles have been
established. It is a high-temperature reactor (coolant output at 750C), using as
coolant a eutectic mixture of 78:22 NaF/ThF4 melting at 618C, though addition of
RbF or KF to reduce the melting point may be desirable. Moderation is by steel-
clad graphite constructed as the inner core of rectangular fuel assemblies.
The fuel salt is a mixture of UF3/UF4/RbF/NaF with a melting point in the region
of 600C. It is maintained in a suitable redox state using sacrificial chromium metal
inserts in each fuel tube.
233U is bred from thorium in the coolant salt which also acts as the breeding
blanket. There is a layer of molten bismuth alloyed with depleted uranium and tho-
rium in the bottom of the tank which removes bred uranium (and protactinium)
from the coolant salt by reductive extraction, as demonstrated at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory (Shaffer, 1971). The presence of depleted uranium in this layer
ensures that isotopically pure 233U is never produced. This eliminates a serious pro-
liferation risk, since (contrary to many claims) 233U is quite capable of being used
for weapons purposes (Forsberg et al., 1998). The location of the bismuth layer,
protected from the core neutron flux by the coolant layer, ensures that fission of the
bred uranium and parasitic neutron capture by 233Pa are avoided. The bismuth layer
is periodically removed for processing and replaced with fresh alloy when the
“enrichment” of the 233U has reached the desired level of B5%.
493
Static liquid fuel reactors

This reactor design produces a spent fuel stream containing plutonium and high-
er actinides, due to the presence of 238U in the fuel. This is where the second reac-
tor is required. It is the Stable Salt Fast Reactor described in Chapter 21, Stable salt
fast reactor, which will consume the plutonium and higher actinides, removing
them as proliferation risks and reducing the hazardous life of the resulting waste
from tens of thousands of years to mere hundreds of years. Perhaps one of these
fast reactors would be required for every 10 thermal spectrum reactors.
Together these two static molten salt-fueled reactors can provide essentially
unlimited power, at low cost, with minimum proliferation risk, and with actinide-
free spent fuel waste.

Introduction to accelerator-driven systems (ADS)
Usually ADS (accelerator-driven systems or accelerator-driven subcritical reactors)
are not categorized as a fission reactor, because ADS are operated under subcritical
conditions, and a self-sustaining chain reaction does not occur in ADS. However, in
order to deploy molten salt reactor (MSR) widely around the world, a large amount
of fissile material is required, and ADS would be a solution to meet this require-
ment. Also, ADS are widely studied for various applications besides fissile produc-
tion. Therefore, ADS are introduced briefly here.
ADS utilize a high-intensity proton accelerator with an energy of about 1 GeV,
directed to a spallation target. Usually, this target is made of solid metals such as
Pb/W/U/Th. The injected protons cause a spallation reaction, which emits a few
tens of neutrons per incident proton to the surrounding blanket region. Then, these
neutrons can be used for fissile production or minor actinide (MA) incineration.
Since produced fissile materials cause fission reactions, the heat can be recovered
to generate electricity. Fig. 15.1 shows a concept of ADS. In some cases, there may

be excess electricity, but it depends on the design. Development activity in each
country is described in IAEA (2015).
Its basic concept was originally proposed by a Canadian scientist, W. B., Lewis
in 1952 (Lewis, 1952), and an integrated concept can be found in A. Harms’ book
in 1982 (Harms and Heindler, 1982). If the above target and blanket are a molten
salt of thorium (Th), then the above two-region concept can be simplified. 232Th in
the core can be converted by spallation neutrons to fissile 233U, which will be uti-
lized for other reactors. K. Furukawa provided a numerical study and proposed this
concept as accelerator molten salt breeder (AMSB) in 1981 (Furukawa et al.,
1981).
15.2
Accelerator Molten Salt Breeder (AMSB)
AMSB is composed of the following three parts:
1. 1 GeV 3 200300 mA proton accelerator;
2. Single-fluid molten fluoride target system; and
3. Heat transfer and electric power recovery system.
A diagram of this system is shown in Fig. 15.2. The size of the target salt bath is
4.5 m in diameter and 7 m in depth. A Hastelloy N vessel is protected by a graphite
reflector. The salt flows into the top of the bath, forming a vortex of about 1 m in
depth. The proton beam is injected in an off-centered position, hitting near the bot-
tom of the vortex to minimize neutron leakage and to improve generated heat dis-
persion. This target molten salt system is subcritical and is not affected by
radiation, unlike solid targets. This makes heat removal easier, and does not need
target shuffling. The beam injection port will be designed by an improved gas-
curtain technology. A high-energy proton accelerator will utilize multibeam funnel-
ing. Spallation neutrons transmute Th to 233U, and also cause fissions in the target.
Target salt is 7LiF-BeF2-ThF4-233UF4 in equilibrium condition. Since there is no
fissile 233U in this salt at the start-up stage, one idea is to add PuF3 as an initial

fissile in the same way as FUJI-Pu, that is AMSB-Pu (Furukawa et al., 2008;
Yoshioka, 2013).
Assuming 32% efficiency of proton accelerator, 940 MWe is required to operate
the accelerator of proton beam of 1 GeV 3 300 mA. This electricity is recovered by
fission energy in the target salt. Assuming Keff 5 0.67 (effective multiplication fac-
tor) of the target salt, and 36 neutrons for each spallation reaction by a proton,
2140 MWt is generated, that is 940 MWe is generated based on 44% thermal effi-
ciency of the power recovery system. Here, Keff 5 0.67 means that multiplication
by fission is 2 (5Keff/(1  Keff)), and one neutron is used to convert Th to 233U
and another neutron is used for fission reaction. Also, since the conversion ratio
(CR) of target salt is high and close to 1.0, consumption of 233U by fission is almost
compensated for by the chain reaction.
In this AMSB design, a relatively large accelerator with a current of 300 mA
beam is assumed. As far as the energy balance, this size can be smaller. But, at the
initial start-up stage of AMSB, there is no fissile, and fissile material (233U) is
mainly generated by spallation reaction. If the accelerator is small, for example
30 mA with Keff 5 0.90, then it will take a long time to build-up the fissile material
to achieve this high Keff. Therefore, a large accelerator with a current of 300 mA
beam is required to achieve an equilibrium condition as soon as possible.

Once the equilibrium condition is achieved, an annual net production of 233U is
about 800 kg/year, assuming 80% load factor of this AMSB. As is shown in
Section 11.2, one 1000 MWe super-FUJI requires 1.5 tons of initial 233U, and this
fissile amount will be supplied by 1 year operation of two AMSBs. The energy bal-
ance of AMSB is shown in Fig. 15.3 (Furukawa et al., 1981).
As a future integrated system, K. Furukawa proposed the Thorium Molten Salt
Nuclear Energy Synergetic System (THORIMS-NES), which is a combination of
MSR fission power reactors and AMSB for production of fissile 233U. In between
these two facilities, a fuel chemical processing facility is placed, as shown in
Fig. 15.4 (Furukawa et al., 2008; Yoshioka, 2013).
THORIMS-NES has the following three unique features:
1. Using Th instead of U as fertile element, that is Th cycle instead of U-Pu cycle;
2. Using liquid fuel (molten fluoride salt fuel) instead of solid fuel;
3. Separation of electric power station (MSR-FUJI) and fissile breeding facility (AMSB).
The total system is simply integrated by a single phase of molten fluorides based
on LiF-BeF2 solvent, after doing some make-up in each component facility. Each
regional center for chemical processing and fissile production will accommodate
440 AMSBs, two chemical processing plants, and one radio-waste processing
plant. It is planned that several tens of centers will be built in different locations
around the world.

Fast subcritical MSR for MA incineration
The essential problem of the closing nuclear fuel cycle (CNFC) is the high radioac-
tivity of the spent fuel (SF), particularly the long-lived radioactive waste and espe-
cially the MA, which are represented mainly by Am and in relatively less quantity
by higher actinides (Cm and others).
According to basic conceptions of MA utilization they have to be safely buried
or according to a more decisive approach they have to be transmuted, i.e., converted

to relatively short-lived fission products and thus eliminated from the Earth’s eco-
system. The main stream of the MA transmutation is to burn them out together with
recycled fuel of Pu, Np, and U probably due to the lack of effective technology for
the MA elimination from SF.
Another promising way, which is known as the double-strata approach (OMEGA
project) (Takizuka, 1997), consists of CNFC separation into two subcycles: the first
(basic) is for the fast reactor fresh fuel fabrication free of MA and the second (sup-
porting) is MA incineration in specialized reactors. The principal important advan-
tage of such a strategy is the possibility of relatively independent optimization of
each cycle, including choice of a reactor and its operating mode.
The 1-year MA production from a 1 GWe nuclear power plant (Pressurized
Water Reactor (PWR) or Russian pressurized water reactor (VVER)) is B3.5 kg of
Am and B0.9 kg of Cm. After 30 years of storing this amount grows up to B30 kg
of Am and B0.2 kg of Cm due to 241Pu !241Am decay, i.e., every year the amount
of Am increases by B2% and the amount of Cm is reduced by B5%.
The nuclear power of 500 GWe planned for the middle of the 21st century will
result in annual production of about B1.7 t of Am and B0.5 t of Cm. In addition,
Am and Cm isotopes produced by existing nuclear power should be eliminated
from the SF storages and transmuted (today’s amount are B2.5 3 105 t) (IAEA-
TECDOC, 2008). Both MA inventories should be transmuted with a reasonable
rate, i.e., at least faster than the rate of their production.

Presently the total amount of Am and Cm in the world SF storages can be esti-
mated as B250 t of Am and B2 t of Cm and every year it increases by B5 t Am
and reduces by B0.1 t Cm. To eliminate this amount of MA in B50 years it is nec-
essary to burn them out at a rate of B10 t/year.
The conception of the specialized reactor for MA burning is a subject of current
discussion (Bultman, 1995; NEA Nuclear Science Committee, 2000). The MSR is
considered highly as a proposal for this purpose. It has some advantages over solid
fuel reactors. The first is the absence of the need for fuel element fabrication with
subsequent recycling of extremely toxic wastes. The second is the lack of limita-
tions on the fuel burn-up that, in the case of solid fuel, leads to fuel element
swelling.
One of the most common advantages of this reactor type is the principal impos-
sibility of severe accidents with reactor power run-up since the void and tempera-
ture coefficients are negative and the reactor is operated with minimum reactivity
margin.
There is an operational experience of the experimental MSR of 7.6 MW power
(MSRE, ORNL, USA; 196469) (McPherson, 1985; Haubenrich and Engel, 1970).
Furthermore, MSR is also included in the Generation IV program (Serp et al.,
2013) and national programs in Japan, China, Korea, and India. These circum-
stances indicate that the prospects of MSR, considered from the standpoint of tech-
nical implementation, are a possibility in the foreseeable future possessing
competitiveness with traditional solid-fuel reactors. Note that most of these listed
projects, as well as MSRE, are based on Th-U fuel cycle with fuel salt (FS) 2LiF-
BeF2 and thermal neutron spectrum.
By now it is clearly recognized that the fast-neutron spectrum is preferred for
the reactor-burner (IAEA-TECDOC, 2008). In this case the fission process in the
neutron absorption reaction contributes to the direct transmutation of MA into fis-
sion fragments, and at the same time allows to minimize the involvement of the
ignition material in the form of Pu or odd uranium isotopes 233U or 235U.
Attempts to achieve a fast neutron spectrum by the use of chloride salts have
been unsuccessful due to their high corrosiveness. Fluoride salts, unlike chloride
salts, have a satisfactory compatibility with construction materials. But to achieve a
fast neutron spectrum, concentration of actinides in fluoride salts should be at least
about 10 at.% (B10 mol.% of PuF3 and UF4 or B50 wt.% of fissile elements)
(Merle-Lucotte et al., 2004, 2006). Such solubility values are many times higher
than solubility limits of PuF3 which have become recently known (Ponomarev
et al., 2013). The situation has radically changed in recent years due to conducted
experiments with eutectic 46.5% LiF-11.5% NaF-42% KF (FLiNaK), as is shown
in Fig. 15.5. In accordance with some theoretical estimations (Benes and Konings,
2008) the solubility of actinides 10 mol% was experimentally confirmed (Lizin
et al., 2013a,b; Volozhin et al., 2013), which provides a reasonably fast neutron
spectrum. An extremely high solubility of AmF3 should be especially noted.
These new findings open the prospect for development of the molten salt
reactor-burner with a fast neutron spectrum (MSR-B) based on FLiNaK for actinide
transmutation.
500
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

MA and actinides formed from them during the burning process are character-
ized by a low yield of delayed neutrons β: 241Am—0.14%, 245Cm—0.18% 239Pu—
0.22%, 238Pu—0.14%. In this regard, from the point of view of reactor operating
and behavior in accidents related to the introduction of positive reactivity, MSR-B
is inferior to reactors on U-Pu fuel. This is especially important for high-
performance reactor-burners operated only on MA or with a minimum feeding of
fissile isotopes (235U and 239Pu). Besides that, FS circulation leads to reduction of
effective delayed neutron fraction β (Weinberg and Wigner, 1959). The known
method to compensate reduction of β is to convert reactor to subcritical mode with
an external neutron source (Vasil’kov et al., 1970; Carminati et al., 1993). Such an
approach is used in considered conceptions for reactor stabilization. A reactor with
subcritical reactivity Δk, under otherwise equal conditions, is not inferior to the
critical reactor with β  Δk with respect to reactor power inertia.

Primary neutrons are generated in the target, and afterwards they are multiplied in the
blanket;

Blanket is a molten salt homogeneous reactor with carrier salt FLiNaK, which provides a
fast neutron spectrum.
The integration of these properties in one reactor system defines a new concept.
The conceptual scheme of subcritical MSR-B and its general layout are presented
in Figs. 15.6 and 15.7.
The target node consists of the proton beam tube and the neutron production tar-
get. According to the traditional approach for such systems, the target is located in
the center of the reactor. It is surrounded by a subcritical molten salt blanket where
neutrons that escape from the target produce additional fission neutrons and the
incineration of the transplutonium elements takes place. Outside of the transmuta-
tion zone there is the first circulation circuit that includes pumps and heat

exchangers. The LiF-NaF-KF salt is used in the first and second circulation circuits.
The whole system is surrounded by a steel reflector. Not shown in the figures is
reactor equipment including cleanup and fuel feeding systems.
With regard to this reactor scheme, neutron and thermal calculations have been
carried out with the aim to substantiate the principal structural parameters of the
reactor and its physical properties. The initial data on the following parameters
have been taken:
1. Subcriticality Δk 5 0.01 and 0.03. At higher subcriticality Δk 5 0.03, the reactor is com-
parable to the storages of the SF with regard to nuclear safety. At Δk 5 0.01 the reactor is
equivalent to a critical reactor with βB1% with regard to inertness of transition pro-
cesses. This can be simply demonstrated on the one-point reactor model (Bell and
Glasstone, 1970). In this approximation the neutron kinetic equation with one group of
delay neutron is written as:
Λ dPðtÞ
dt
5 ðρ 2 βÞPðtÞ 1
ð
N
0
dτβλ expð2λτÞPðt 2 τÞ 5 ðρ 2 βÞPðtÞ 1 qdðtÞ;
where the standard notations are used and P(t) is reactor power.
As the utmost case of the subcritical reactor on prompt neutrons (β 5 0) with reactivity
ρs  ρ0 1 ρp, where ρ0  Δk (reactivity in the operation reactor mode) and ρp (reactiv-
ity perturbation), the kinetic equation is written as:
Λ dPðtÞ
dt
 ðρp  ΔkÞPðtÞ 1 qout;
where qout defines the outer neutron source that is assumed to be constant.
In the steady state P(t) 5 P0, qd(t) 5 qd0 5 βP0, qout  ΔkP0 and if both reactors have
equal power and Δk  β, then qout  qd0. Thus, the equations differ mainly in the fact that
in the transient mode term qd(t) in a critical reactor with delay follows the change of its
power, and in the subcritical reactor a similar term qout remains constant. It is clear that
when disturbed reactivity ρp is inserted in a subcritical reactor with Δk  β, reactor power
varies more inertially than in a critical reactor with the same reactivity ρ 5 ρp. It should
be noted that the small subcriticality additionally requires its reliable online monitoring,
which can be implemented, for example, using reactor noise (Degtyarev et al., 2013a,b).
2. At the proton energy Ea 5 1 GeV and proton accelerator current Ia 5 3 or 10 mA, the
power of the accelerator is Wa 5 3 or 10 MW, respectively. Such accelerator parameters
are assumed to be achieved in the foreseeable future. Three MSR-B conceptions were
examined: one for power Wb 5 1650 MWth, and two for the power Wb 5 495 MWth.
As a target material the liquid lead-bismuth eutectic is used. Several high-energy
particle transport codes, such as Fluctuating Kascade Monte Carlo Code (FLUKA),
Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport Code (MCNP/MCNPX), Multipurpose Hadron
Transport Code (SHIELD), Calculation Code for the Transport of Charged Particles
and Neutrons (CASCADE/INPE), etc. might be used for calculation of the thermal
and neutron characteristics of the target neutron production and molten salt blanket.
The description of the spallation interaction of protons with the target nuclei and
the transport of secondary particles in the target of the MSR-B was done with the
503
Accelerator-driven systems

CASCADE/INPE code (Barashenkov et al., 1999). According to the research result,
the target height was determined as 60 cm, and the diameter as 1426 cm (depend-
ing on the power of the proton accelerator). The input temperature of the Pb-Bi
eutectics in the target is 320C, its maximal flow speed is 2.5 m/s, the maximum
target temperature is 620C, the maximum energy release is B270 kW/L. The neu-
tron spectrum produced by the Pb-Bi target is presented in Fig. 15.8, its total inten-
sity at the 10 MW proton beam power is B1.3 3 1018 n/s. The neutron multiplicity
per one proton with energy Ea 5 1 GeV was found to be at the level of 20 n/p,
which is in accordance with the experimental results (Yurevich et al., 2006).
Neutron calculations to evaluate MSR transmutation zone parameters were car-
ried out using the MCNP-4B (MCNP, 1997) and ORIGEN2.1 (1996) codes in a
full-scale model. MCNP calculations are performed with a neutron cross-section
library based on ENDF/B-VI (Cross Section Evaluation Working Group, 1991).
In the MSR-B blanket, molten salt of 0.465% LiF 2 0.115% NaF 2 0.42% KF is
used with 14 mol% of heavy metal (HM) contamination. Such concentrations are
significantly below the solubility limits (B30 mol% for PuF3 and B40 mol.% for
AmF3) in the operating temperature range B 650700C (Fig. 15.5).
The size of transmutation zone and feeding composition is determined in order to
provide the target value of reactor subcriticality Δk in a steady state mode, when the
fuel composition (FC) is stabilized. The ratio H/R (height/radius) is assumed to be equal
to 1.85, which is optimal for the reactor without a reflector. The internal cavity volume
of the transmutation zone is varied in agreement with the size of the target node.
The composition of the loading fuel is formed on the basis of transuranium com-
ponents of PWR SF cooled for 30 years, that is given in Table 15.1.
Pu is assumed as an ignition material for the starting FC and, if necessary, for
reactor feeding. A possible alternative can be enriched uranium. However, taking
into account the value of U for conventional nuclear power reactors, the purpose of
a reactor incinerator to work with a highly radioactive fuel, and the peculiarity of
transmutation processes in a reactor, the choice in favor of Pu looks more natural.

Initial FS composition is a solution of PuF3 (7 mol%) and AmF3 (7 mol%) in
FLiNaK. Nuclide composition of each element of the fuel fraction is given in
Table 15.2. The density of the FS at 700C is 3.18 g/cm3, and the content of acti-
nides is 1.28 g/cm3 (Table 15.2).
Fuel burn-up calculations were carried out in relation to the irradiation condi-
tions in the transmutation zone. Primary neutron generation power in the target was
obtained from calculation results of the spallation interaction of protons in the tar-
get. The feeding rate ensures constant mass of actinides in the reactor. MA and Pu
feeding fractions are formed on the base of the irradiated FS. FS cleanup systems
are also taken into account in the calculation.
The main geometric parameters of reactors are presented in Table 15.3.

The main physical and operation parameters of MSR-B in the equilibrium state
are shown in Table 15.4. This shows the equilibrium state with constant FC. As a
consequence, the rate of fuel injection into the reactor equals the rate of fuel burnup
(i.e., its transmutation to the fission products).
According to the results obtained MAs can be burned in a reactor with
1650 MWth power without plutonium feeding (except for the initial loading). For
reactors with less power, plutonium feeding is needed to compensate for neutron
leakage that is higher in a smaller reactor (Table 15.5).
The possibility to burn MA alone or with a relatively moderate Pu feeding is
determined crucially by the high concentration of nuclides. At higher heavy nuclear
concentrations the neutron spectrum is close to the spectrum of fast reactors that
intensifies fission of actinides (see Figs. 15.9 and 15.10).
The dip in the neutron spectrum of MSR-B in the 30200 keV energy range is
due to elastic neutron scattering resonances of 19F and describes their impact in the
smoothed form. Secondary neutron yields for the most important actinides in

sion. The majority of such nuclei in the reactor considered produce neutrons in
excess quantity, in contrast to the reactor with an intermediate neutron spectrum.
Note that burning of MA without involvement of the fissile material also can be
realized in a reactor with a fast neutron spectrum on the basis of the LiF-BeF2 salt.

However, to provide the fast neutron spectrum the feeding of such reactors must
include 232Th, which thereby dilutes MA as a fuel (Ignatiev et al., 2012a,b, 2014).
As already mentioned above, two reactor models with power 495 MWth do not
have significant differences in physical parameters, including the composition of
the feeding, despite the significant difference in subcriticality and neutron balance.
This is explained by increased neutron leakage in the model with subcriticality 0.03
caused by the increase of the size of the target node.
FC in a steady state significantly differs from the initial loading. In particular,
the proportion of curium increases 1020 times and achieves about 1/10th of the
total mass of actinides (Table 15.7).
The share of 239Pu is reduced in plutonium fraction and 238Pu becomes predomi-
nant, which even in the absence of plutonium in the fuel feeding is formed from
241Am decay chain with two relatively short-lived intermediate nuclides

238Pu:
The essential fraction (B30%) of 241Am transmutations takes place via this
chain with fission of 238Pu. Note that in a thermal neutron spectrum the burning of
241Am nucleus in the same scheme would require an additional neutron to convert
238Pu to 239Pu due to the low probability of 238Pu fission.
Table 15.7 shows a large reduction of 237Np, and this suggests that 237Np captures
a neutron to 238Np, and decays to 238Pu with half-life of 2.1 days. But, 237Np may
have little significance in terms of radioactivity, and this path is not described here.
Neutron balance in the reactor is characterized by a relatively small share of
absorption in the structural elements ,2% and the neutron leakage ,2% in
1650 MWth reactor and ,5% in a reactor of 495 MWth power. Nonproductive neu-
tron losses in the FC, which includes the absorption on the elements of the carrier
salt, fission products, as well as on uranium and neptunium, do not exceed 8%. The
largest contribution to the neutron absorption belongs to 241Am and to the generation
of secondary fission neutrons—238Pu (in the 1650 MWth reactor) and 239Pu (in the
495 MWth reactor). Some characteristics of MSR-B are presented in Table 15.8.)

Accelerator-driven systems

Slow changes of criticality due to fuel burnup in MSR are compensated mainly by
feeding that facilitates the control and protection system (CPS). However, in the case
of MSR-B 1650 MWth with MA feeding such a control is unstable, leading to an
increase in the imbalance of material compositions and criticality even for small
deviations (Degtyarev et al., 2012). It is explained by sign-changing reactivity intro-
duced by MA during their transmutation. Immediately on entering the reactor MA,
whose composition is dominated by 241Am, introduce negative reactivity. But later
the impact of MA changes sign due to their partial transition in plutonium fraction
(mainly 238Pu). Therefore, for example, if excess criticality is suppressed by introduc-
ing an additional amount of MA, then over time it leads to an increase in the initial
criticality perturbation. Reactivity control based on using plutonium fraction is devoid
of this shortcoming. In this case the plutonium portion is drawn from or returned to
the core, depending on the criticality imbalance. This regulation does not mean, of
course, attraction of additional plutonium, because plutonium produced in the reactor
core is used. In the steady state of reactor operation stable makeup can also be orga-
nized on the basis of monitoring of the actual imbalance of nuclide concentration.
The inlet temperature of the FS in the blanket is equal to 650C and outlet tem-
perature is about 700C. The speed of the FS flow is 3.1 m/s and 2.1 m/s for the
reactor of power 1650 MWth and 495 MWth, respectively. The average energy
release is B350 kW/L in both cases. The molten salt flow speed in the heat exchan-
gers is 5 m/s (Gulevich et al., 2008, 2009).
High power density (B 300 W/cm3), a high-energy neutron spectrum, the pres-
ence of the target node in the central region of the reactor, and the integrated layout
of the reactor are favorable for efficient burnup of transplutonium elements. On the
other hand, the same features lead to high levels of radiation damage of the reactor
main structural elements, and thus it severely limits its life, which can be estimated
from 15 years.

Low-energy linear accelerator-driven
subcritical assembly
15.5.1
Introduction and scope
Several radiotherapy linear accelerators have been installed in Venezuela, and as they
get older they are replaced by new ones. Several replaced equipments are available
for new physics research applications, since LINAC devices are reliable machines
(Barrera et al., 2015). One such application is the employment of accelerators as dri-
vers for subcritical thorium-uranium fuel assemblies as proposed by Rubbia et al.
(1993), Sajo-Bohus et al. (2015b), and Bermudez et al. (2016). Here we suggest tak-
ing advantage of bremsstrahlung produced energetic photons (5.525 MeV) which
early experimental data by Castillo et al. (2014) showed neutron production even in
the energy window of the Pygmy Dipole Resonance reaction (PDR). Therefore
photons in the Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) region, where most medical LINACs
512
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

are actively operated, could be employed with effectiveness to induce neutrons by (γ,
n), (γ, fis), and (e, e’n) reactions in the W-target. They could serve as neutron sources
to increase a subcritical reactor’s keff. Photons, photoneutrons nph, or fission neutrons
ν, absorbed by Th/U fluid fuel could generate energy with a non-negligible rate,
depending mainly on the beam intensity. The advantage is that, for a given subcritical
assembly, several LINACs could supply energetic neutrons using tungsten as target
or other elements that have relatively large reaction cross-sections. This suggests the
feasibility of a photodriven MSR (PD MSR) that could be employed for energy gen-
eration (Sajo-Bohus et al., 2015a). Another suggestion is to employ such a PD MSR
subcritical assembly to reduce radiotoxicity of nuclear waste (e.g., minor actinides)
including medical radioisotopes such as the radio toxic 99Tc (byproduct of the decay
of 99mTc widely used in medical diagnostic applications). A further suggestion is to
employ LINACs to produce new radioisotopes for medical theranostic (therapy and
diagnostic) applications. In fact, high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation, such as
is given by alpha particles, is advisable for radioimmunotherapy, e.g., 223Ra, to
reduce metastatic bone tumor or to be employed for hormone-refractory prostate can-
cer. Other radioisotopes could be produced such as 225Ac, 211At, 212Pb/ 212Bi, 213Bi,
226Th, and 227Th for neoplasia (DOE, 2015).
Our study is oriented to determine fission rates and neutron production rates
employing nuclear track detector (NTM) methodology with poly-allyl-diglicol-
carbonate (PADC) passive detectors since these cope with the required sensitivity for
neutron field measurements (Pa´lfalvi et al., 2001; Espinosa et al., 2015). The latent
track formed during charged particle absorption is enlarged by appropriate develop-
ment and analyzed. Results yield conveniently the efficiency of neutron production
and their applicability as an external neutron source for a subcritical assembly.
15.5.2
Theory
At relatively low photon energy (B1020 MeV), a value near or above the nucleon
mean binding energy (B8 MeV), reactions are induced by GDR in the simulated tar-
get fuel, the reaction cross-section for the Th-U mixture increases with the photon
energy around 1015 MeV, and then drops rapidly. Due to collective oscillation in
the heavy nuclei, a neutron breaks free during photonuclear (γ, n) and (γ, 2n), electro-
nuclear (e, e’n) or (γ, pn) reactions including (γ, fis). The reaction total cross-section
may be expressed as the sum of cross-sections σi for a set of possible (γ, i) reactions,

(15.1)
in which Σi σi (γ, i) 5 σ (γ, n) 1 2σ (γ, 2n) 1 ν σ (γ, fis) and ν is the neutron
multiplicity which for actinides fission is around 2.2. The neutron yield Y(k) per
incident photon and energy group k, for target and PADC-detector-(CI2Hl8O7) ele-
ments, assuming a parallel beam of photons, is given by

(15.2)
where ρj is the atomic density, σj(k) is the cross-section for (γ, n) reaction of the
j-th isotope and t is the target thickness. The factor f1(k) takes into account photon
attenuation when relatively thick target material is considered. The photoneutron
yields calculated by Allen and Chaudhri (1988) are given in Fig. 15.11 for passive
detectors.
Relevant processes other than direct neutron induced fission are shown in the
following scheme:
Unat 5 99.3% (238U) 1 0.7% (235U); Thnat is assumed pure 232Th.
238U 1 γ ! 236U 12n 1 γ ! 235U 1 n ! fission fragments (A1, A2)
238U 1 γ ! 237U 1 n 1 γ ! 236U 1 n 1 γ ! 235U 1 n ! fission fragments (A1, A2)

ments (A1, A2)
232Th 1 γ !231Th 1 n; 232Th 1 γ ! fission fragments (A1, A2)
The photofission reaction cross-section for both isotopes 232Th and 238U are very
similar as shown in Fig. 15.12.
The number of delayed neutron number νd per energy in the interval 917 MeV
is almost the same (Van Lawe et al., 2006) so that the simulation for FC is less
complicated.
15.5.3
Experimental procedure
Experiments were carried out with a radiotherapy machine (LINAC Varian 2100
accelerator at the La Trinidad, GURVE-Clinic, Caracas, Venezuela), operated at
18 MV for 66 minutes with 400 Monitor Unit (or MU) and at a rate of 600 MU for
target irradiation. Detectors employed were combinations of different or mixed ele-
ments as given in Table 15.9 assembled into simulated fuel samples.

Accelerator-driven systems

The set of sample detectors were employed in a sandwiched configuration of fer-
tile/fissile material and Bnat as shown in Fig. 15.13. The latter is included in the tar-
get material Th as Th(NO3)4  4H2O and U as UO2(NO3)2  6H2O because it is
expected that through the reaction (α, n), more neutrons will be available to
increase the neutron source strength (i.e., neutron economy).
The alpha spectrum of 232Th is mainly composed of two most important groups:
5.4210 MeV (71%) and 5.3385 MeV (28%). To observe neutron fluence for the
assembled fuel-detector configurations, the passive detectors were covered by a thin
10B layer; so that nuclear tracks would be related only to neutrons coming from the
target and counted through their alpha and proton fingerprint. When absorbing ener-
getic charged particles, the detecting material registers a damaged region creating a
so-called latent nuclear track. This track is then visualized by chemical develop-
ment and microscopic examination. The PADC material was selected for its effi-
cient recording properties for alpha particles and proton recoils, when these have
impinging energy above the threshold values of 200 and 500 keV, respectively.
Details of the assembled fuel samples (targets) are given in Table 15.9 and
Fig. 15.13.
It is expected that energetic photons absorbed by the target compound release
prompt and delayed neutrons. Additionally, natural boron (Bnat) absorbing alpha
particles (from 232Th, Unat) as mentioned, increase the neutron economy. All these
neutrons to some extent will be detected by the PADC enhanced sensitivity due to
the cover of boron-10 neutron-to-alpha particle converter (as it has a relatively high
reaction cross-section of 3838 b for thermal neutron capture) and often is employed
in neutron counting (Pino et al., 2014). Since the reaction cross-section values
increases with the Fermi law (1/v), 3 cm thick paraffin is also used as moderator to
enhance the material-detecting property. Passive detecting PADC material from
Tastrack was available for this study supplied by the manufacturer (TASL, Track
Analysis System Ltd, Napier House, Meadow Grove, Bristol BS11 9PJ, UK). We
already mentioned the requirement for chemical treatment, the nuclear track meth-
odology requires a solution 6N, NaOH at 70C for 46 hours to make visible the
latent track under a light transmission microscope. On completion detectors were
analyzed employing a semiautomatic system following a well-established protocol
(Pa´lfalvi and Sajo´-Bohus, 2015). The system provides etched track density and size
distribution in the form of an area histogram, from which fuel neutron production is
determined.
15.5.4
Results and discussion
Results for detectors in Table 15.10 indicate that track densities, i.e., the number of
neutrons, are comparable but their track size distributions are very different. This is
explained by the target assembly efficiency to generate neutrons, which in fact
depends on the fuel isotopic or whole target composition. In the first case with sam-
ple composition of Th 1 Bnat the neutron production was 15% less in respect to
U 1 Bnat; that is explained by the track density observed in relation to the (α, n)
reaction induced in Bnat. We have also studied the FC Th 1 Unat 1 Bnat. Analyzing
516
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

the track density a larger number of low-energy neutrons were observed, confirming
that uranium offers higher photofission neutrons. The study proves the usefulness
of NTD sandwiched with natural or enriched to 98% boron by 10B and Th or U
compounds, to study in a simple and economical way the photonuclear reactions
produced by low-energy radiotherapy accelerators.
15.6
Conclusions
The concept of ADS is introduced briefly at first, and a typical application of an
AMSB for fissile production is proposed, where molten salt is used as a proton
beam target and blanket for fissile production. Assuming 80% load factor in
AMSB, an annual net production rate of 233U is about 800 kg/year, which can be
used to start one 1-GWe FUJI-MSR every 2 years.
Another application of MA incineration is described. The presented conception
of the subcritical MSR-B is restricted only by the physical aspects of the MA-
transmutation problem. It does not discuss the technological, economical, safety,
etc. problems which require much more serious considerations in the framework of
chosen strategy of the nuclear power development and its closing. In case all these
problems can be overcome about 10 such reactor-burners would be enough to clean
all the SF storages from MA in 50 years. The same number of B10 reactor-burners
is enough to arrange the special cycle for the MA transmutation in CNFC of the
nuclear power of about 200 GWe by fast reactor (FR) among total nuclear power
generation of 500 GWe. The transmutation time, τin, necessary for the burning of
the equilibrium loading, Q, is short enough to fulfill this task during the reactor
lifetime.

The reactor concept is based on a high dissolving ability of the actinide fluorides
in the salt FLiNaK, which has recently been demonstrated in a series of pioneering
experiments. Due to this phenomenon fast neutron spectrum is formed in the reac-
tor, eliminating the need for additional feeding by fissile isotopes. In this case the
fuel is transplutonium elements themselves.
This discovered ability of salt LiF-NaF-KF opens promising prospects for the
creation of molten salt reactors not only for MA transmutation but for other pur-
poses, similar to traditional solid-fuel reactors with a fast neutron spectrum.
Conclusions on low-energy linear ADS are as follows. Measurements carried out
in a low-energy accelerator used for clinical applications with the employment of
passive NTMs shows the production of neutrons in the accelerator tungsten target
and the production of neutrons in thorium and uranium targets. These results dem-
onstrate in principle the feasibility of the use of these accelerators for photodriven
subcritical assemblies. Finally, in this study we demonstrate that the employments
of passive NTMs are effective and economical means to ascertain fission rates and
neutron production rates.

16.1
Energy needs
World economic development correlates clearly with increasing energy consumption.
At present, world consumption is almost 13 billion tons of oil equivalent annually.
Taking into account continuing population growth of about 1.5% and world economic
growth of about 3%4% annually, primary energy consumption increases about 1%
annually. Use of fossil fuels, such as oil, natural gas, and coal, is increasing. The eco-
logical problems of greenhouse gas and pollution emission occur together with the
use of fossil fuels. The recent Congress on climate problems in Paris has confirmed
this once more. The world is showing concern over the growth of average tempera-
ture on the planet. It needs to stimulate actions to limit temperature growth within
2C of the preindustrial era value (B1900). Just these facts, along with natural
resource limitations and the high cost of developing new deposits are enough to
require new energy sources. Technologies with high-energy potential and minimal
negative environment impact are nuclear fission energy and thermonuclear energy.
The desire to develop energy technologies is not only an attractive direction that
responds to global interests, but also an opportunity to create high environmental
quality energy sources. Such growth may change industrial, social, and economic
structure by developing human potential for living well in the high-technology
world. It can provide sustainable development and long-term prosperity, and the
dominant role of fossil fuels will diminish.
At present the growth of the world economy is predominantly in developing
countries. By the end of the 21st century consumption per capita will gradually
tend towards equality. The population of developing countries is about five times
more than that of developed countries, and present consumption per capita is 45
times less than that of developed countries. Levelling of primary energy

consumption per capita can be expected under the influence of globalization pro-
cesses. This means that primary energy consumptions will increase at least 35
times by the end of the 21st century, even accounting for significant energy conser-
vation measures. Different forecasts of almost all analytical centers of the world
(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, International Energy Agency, etc.)
estimated growth of world energy consumption by 2100 confirm this prediction.
It is clear that such scales of energy consumption, regardless of primary energy
source, will lead to an unacceptably profound influence on the Earth’s atmosphere
and climate. Taking into account population growth, energy consumption growth,
and ecological problems, the development of new energy sources is one of the most
important tasks of our current civilization. The odds-on favorite is nuclear energy,
which provides great potential for reliable power and environmental quality. The
resource base of nuclear energy at acceptable prices (16 Mton U-235) is equal to
120 billion tons of oil, and it is not enough for long-term large-scale industry opera-
tion. Nearly unlimited resources can be attained with a closed fuel cycle using U-
238 and Th-232 to breed Pu-239 and U-233, which can be hundreds of times more
plentiful than U-235, which is currently used. The resources of U-238 and Th-232
are enough to last for thousands of years. These technological innovations should
be realized in a way to minimize radioactive pollution of the environment.
16.2
Fast breeder reactors
Traditionally a part of the nuclear community thinks that large-scale nuclear energy
development is connected with fast reactor development and the uraniumpluto-
nium fuel cycle. This scenario means that in the long-term perspective the system
will include mostly fast reactors, with very few thermal reactors. Let BR be the
breeding ratio in a fast reactor. Each nucleus of Pu-239 fissioned in the fast reactor
will be converted BR . 1 of new Pu-239 from U-238. One new fissile nucleus must
be returned back to the reactor for its further operation. Thus, there will remain
BR-1 nuclei to use in thermal reactors. Burning these new nuclei in thermal reactor
energy (BR-1)200 MeV will be generated, and in a fast reactor to produce these
nuclei energy of 200 MeV was generated. Consequently, in the nuclear energy sys-
tem the ratio of thermal reactors to fast reactors will be (BR-1). Using present fast
reactor designs, BR # 1.2, the fraction of thermal reactors cannot exceed 20%. In
practice, fast reactors are more expensive than thermal reactors, and their operation
must be stable, base-load power without unscheduled shutdowns.
Of course, such development of nuclear energy is possible, but only if it is opti-
mal and uncontested. Meanwhile, only thermal reactors are constructed worldwide
and fast reactor deployment is delayed until the middle of the century, when nuclear
energy will be more expensive, if it all possible.
There is one more serious troublesome aspect to fast reactors. To use newly
developed fissile isotopes, spent fuel must be reprocessed as soon as possible, much
faster than present reprocessing of spent fuel from light-water reactors (LWRs).
524
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

At present fuel is reprocessed after 57 years of service, when burnup is B 4%.
Keeping fuel out of the closed fuel cycle a long time leads to a long delay of a large
amount of plutonium, which will adversely affect the reactor deployment rate. For
this reason, we usually focus on fuel staying out of recycling not longer than 3
years, and burnup B 10%. Such recycling technology, with the required safety
guarantee, is not yet accomplished. If fuel is recycled after a short decay, then its
activity will be very high, and this obviously increases the risk of pollution and sig-
nificantly raises the price of the process.
16.3
Fusionfission hybrids
Taking into account the difficulties of nuclear energy development based on fast
breeder reactors, it is worthwhile to consider other ways of development that can
provide abundant fuel for large-scale nuclear energy deployment. It would also be
beneficial to reduce the associated radioactive waste disposal burden.
The most attractive perspective is to generate energy in thermonuclear fusion
reactors. Fusion is an almost ideal system, but construction of an economically
attractive fusion power plant may be delayed until the distant future.
Near-term fusion reactors with lower energy gain can be used to breed fissile fuel
by placing U or Th in the blanket, called a fusionfission hybrid. The blanket
breeds fissile isotopes and produces additional power from fission reactions. The
thermonuclear reactor in this case is a neutron source for the blanket reactions. Such
a hybrid system is like a typical fission reactor with an external neutron source, and
it is a self-sufficient energy system. An uncontrolled supercritical chain reaction can
be prevented by keeping the neutron multiplication factor well below unity.
In nuclear fission reactors the greatest danger is fuel rods’ loss of cooling.
Residual energy release fission product decay was dominant in the most serious
emergencies, such as the Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima accidents.
During loss of cooling fuel heating happens fast. The temperature of spent fuel and
construction materials increases, and the clad may fail, releasing radioactivity.
Thus, considering these safety issues, it is difficult to find strong arguments in favor
of putting a fission blanket around a fusion reactor. The main advantage of low
radioactive waste is lost.
An alternative strategy is to minimize fission in the blanket while maximizing
fissile breeding, called a “fission-suppressed” blanket. The bred fissile isotopes are
quickly removed from the blanket and processed to provide fuel for satellite fission
reactors. A special fuel composition facilitates rapid removal and processing.
16.4
Thorium fuel cycle
Neutrons from the core of the thermonuclear reactor are used as a high-intensity
external neutron source. To remove the disadvantages associated with fission in the
525
Fusionfission hybrids

hybrid blanket, a special fuel composition using molten salt including thorium
halides is used. This facilitates continuous processing of a side stream of blanket
salt for removal of accumulated fissile isotopes and fission products.
A molten salt hybrid reactor can clean the salt continuously, so the fission prod-
uct content can be kept low, with half as much leakage of radioactivity per gram of
coolant than other means of fissile fuel breeding. Thorium irradiated by neutrons
breeds U-233 by the following reaction chain:
Th-232 1 n!Th-233 (β-, 22,3 min) !Pa-233 (β-, 27 days) !U-233,
In the thorium fuel cycle the energy lost in production of one U-233 nucleus is
about 25 MeV, much less than the 43 MeV lost in generating one Pu-239 nucleus in
the U-Pu fuel cycle. The fast fission cross-section of Th-232 is only about half that
of U-238, so the thorium fuel cycle generates fewer fission products in the blanket.
Using Pu-239 as a fissile isotope in thermal reactors is not desirable. Plutonium
has quite a large capture cross-section in thermal energy range, which leads to neu-
tron production decreasing to 1.8 neutrons per capture in comparison with U-235,
which produces about 2.05 neutrons per capture. This affects fuel breeding in the
thermal reactor, which will decrease approximately for 0.2 units. For VVER (Vodo-
Vodyanoi Energetichesky Reaktors or Water-Water Power Reactors) reactors using
U-235 BR B 0.6, so switching to Pu-239 makes BR B 0.4. And then to provide
new fuel for this reactor, larger fissile isotope provision will be required.
Quite the contrary, using U-233 in thermal reactors is highly desirable. In a ther-
mal spectrum the breeding ability of 233-U is better than 235-U by 0.2 units, and
BR B 0.8. Only about 20% of the annual fissile fuel needs must be supplied
externally.
Approximately 1 ton of 235-U annually burns in 1 GWt reactor, and the quantity
of 233-U or 239-Pu will be approximately the same. If BR 5 0.8 provides 800 kg
annually, the external system should provide just 200 kg of 233-U to sustain the
fuel cycle.
16.5
Nuclear energy system
A fusion neutron source power of 1 GWt annually could breed about 3000 kg of
new fissile isotope. I.V. Kurchatov made the same assessment on new fuel accumu-
lation in the blanket of a thermonuclear reactor long ago. Under this assessment,
one thermonuclear reactor is able to provide fuel to more than 15 thermal reactors.
Thus, only about 7% of the power system needs to be fusion power. Replacement
of fast reactors by fusion reactors for fissile fuel production has a number of
advantages.
First, it will not be necessary to replace thermal reactors and their pervasive
infrastructure with fast reactors. The system with fusionfission hybrids supporting
thermal reactors can become more viable than fast breeder reactors.
Second, potential radiation leakage during spent fuel recycling will be reduced.
Used fuel with high burnup is very hot, and it needs to cool for several years before
526
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

reprocessing, but fast reactor irradiated fuel is supposed to be recycled after 1 or 2
years to extract bred Pu-239. During chemical reprocessing all fission products and
actinides will be released from the fuel pins, and it will take extensive precautions
to prevent their escape. Fission products must be extracted and disposed of, and fis-
sile isotopes must be cleared of chemically similar minor actinides and lanthanides.
Continuous reprocessing of the molten salt composition minimizes the radiation
released. The removal of fission products reduces the energy released in the blan-
ket. During loss of cooling the blanket integrity is significantly easier to preserve,
preventing uncontrolled leakage of radioactive isotopes.
Another important question is the use of heterogeneous fuel assemblies in
nuclear cores: one set of fuel rods with fertile isotopes, and one set with concen-
trated fissile isotopes. Most of the fissions occur in the fissile rods, so the energy
release and fission products will be concentrated there. In modern VVER reactors
the fuel burnup of 235-U is about 80% and this value can be increased to about
90%. In the future there will be no need to recycle these rods, and they will be bur-
ied with highly active fission products. Only fuel rods with fertile isotopes should
be recycled to extract bred U-233 and Pu-239. Energy release in these rods will be
approximately a factor of 10 lower than in rods with fissile isotopes. Consequently,
the radioactivity released during their recycling will be a tenth of total activity.
Fusionfission hybrid reactors to breed fissile fuels can be developed quickly.
In the initial stage the fusion neutron source is not required to have a high Q value
(ratio of fusion energy to input energy) for the fuel production to become economi-
cally feasible. The fusion neutron source can be gradually improved towards a pure
fusion power plant. Radiation loads on the first wall of the fusion reactor will be
high, and its maintenance can be time-consuming.
The concept presented here does not exclude fast reactors. If their cost and qual-
ity will be more attractive than thermal reactors, then there are no limitations of
their development.
The main advantages of a closed fuel cycle using fusionfission hybrid reactors
and the thorium-U-233 fuel cycle are as follows:
1. There are no rigid requirements about the ratio of fast reactors to thermal reactors in a
nuclear energy system with a closed fuel cycle.
2. There are no rigid requirements on the speed of spent fuel reprocessing.
3. One possible mode uses direct burial of spent fuel with high burnup ( . 90%).
4. The total radioactivity from spent fuel during its reprocessing will be at least a factor of
10 less than in the scenario of fast reactor development.
5. The present nuclear system oriented to thermal reactors is consistent with the hybrid sce-
nario, and thermal reactors can evolve to use the thorium fuel cycle.
6. Fast reactors will develop according to their cost and quality relative to thermal reactors.
16.6
Actinide incineration
“The hybrid blanket can be kept subcritical at all times, in contrast to a fast fission
reactor, where reactivity control is a safety issue. The harder neutron spectra from a
527
Fusionfission hybrids

14 MeV neutron source means that more neutrons will cause fission, destroying the
actinides (desirable), and fewer will be captured, producing higher atomic number
transuranics (undesirable). Actinide wastes could be processed out of spent fuel and
then be put in a fusion blanket in suitable form for incineration (fissioning). The
revenues would come from both electrical power sales and waste disposal.” (Moir
and Manheimer, 2014).
Cheng (2005) has studied a blanket design that incinerates separated transuranics
from used LWR fuel. In the “hard spectra” case there is only molten salt with the
dissolved actinides; and in the “soft spectra” case 50% of the volume is taken up by
beryllium that multiplies and moderates the neutrons. Chemical attack of the beryl-
lium by the molten salt would be prevented by separate zones or by cladding.
Table 16.1 shows the results when steady state is achieved. F 5 number of atoms
fissioned per 14 MeV neutron incident on the blanket; keff 5 effective neutron
multiplier.
The low keff values would keep the blanket far below criticality. One hybrid
reactor could incinerate about 1 tonne of actinides per year.
The molten salt could generate copious energy while incinerating weapons mate-
rials and nuclear “waste.” Only about 5% as much repository space would be
needed, compared with LWRs (Moses et al., 2009).

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

Molten salt hybrid tokamak
Russia is developing Molten Salt Hybrid Tokamak (MSHT) reactors to eliminate
five vital risks:
1. Severe accidents could be eliminated by keeping the fusion reactor blanket subcritical; by
removing fission products continuously from the circulating molten salt; and by avoiding
mechanical energy sources (high pressure) and chemical energy sources (Zr, Na, H).
2. Theft of weapons-grade fissile materials could be prevented by using only self-protected
fuel and by ceasing isotopic enrichment.
3. Risks of transuranium wastes and long-lived fission products can be avoided by using
nonenriched uranium; by separating fission products from used fuel; by incineration of
actinides in reactors instead of separating them; and by partial transmutation of highly
toxic long-lived fission products in MSHT.
4. Vital risks of investment loss can be reduced, shortening construction time by using
factory-made precision modules, simpler reactor safety methods (such as passive safety),
and cheaper fuel inventories.
5. The vital risk of rapid exhaustion of fuel resources would be eliminated by deployment of
MSHT. Fuel self-supply and the growth of nuclear power plant parks would be facilitated
by positive breeding gain of fissile materials. Such a nuclear power could start almost
“from zero level” when the first fuel inventory of a Vital Risk Free Reactor would be
available.
Deployment of MSHT power plants could eliminate all five vital risks and facili-
tate a renaissance of the nuclear industry (Velikhov, 2012).

Introduction
Fissionable nuclear fuel can be divided into two categories, i.e., uranium-based and
thorium-based. Currently, fuels of the entire nuclear power industry are all
uranium-based. Because of the rapid growth of energy demand, together with the
abundant global reserves of thorium, the utilization of thorium-based fuel has
become increasingly prominent.
The thorium molten salt reactor (TMSR) nuclear energy system is designed for
thorium-based nuclear energy utilization and hybrid nuclear energy application
based on the liquid-fueled thorium molten salt reactor (TMSR-LF) and solid-fueled
thorium salt reactor (TMSR-SF) in coming 20 years.
The TMSR-LF, in which the fuel is dissolved within the salt, is designed for
thorium-based nuclear energy utilization with online refueling and online/offline
reprocessing capability. The TMSR-SF, which uses the TRISO-type nuclear fuel, is
optimized for a high-temperature-based hybrid nuclear energy application.
As Fig. 17.1 shows, TMSR has characteristics and applications including thorium
energy utilization, hydrogen production, water-free cooling, and small modular
design. Moreover, TMSR has advantages in economics, safety, sustainability, and
nonproliferation. Commercialized TMSR is very feasible under current technology
conditions.

17.2
TMSR-LF
TMSR-LF is a small modular liquid-fueled thorium molten salt reactor with electri-
cal power of 168 MWe. Its main features are listed in Table 17.1. Mature technolo-
gies adopted in its design promote feasibility facilitate rapid deployment and
construction in the near future.
17.2.1
Design overview of TMSR-LF
TMSR-LF is designed with electrical power of 168 MWe for a single unit. It can
be scaled up for different power requirements, i.e., one unit, two units, six units

(GWe level). It consists of three loops, which are the primary loop with fuel salt, a
second loop for radioactivity isolation, and a third loop for energy utilization.
LiF-BeF2-UF4-ThF4 is used as fuel salt and also carrier salt of the primary loop
of TMSR-LF, in which the abundance of Li-7 is 99.995% and the abundance of
U-235 is 19.75%, and FNaBe is taken as salt of the second loop.
The inlet temperature and outlet temperature of the TMSR-LF primary loop are
600C and 700C, respectively. Due to its high temperature output, the open air
Brayton cycle and Rankine cycle combined system is used for TMSR-LF power
generation, and the thermoelectric conversion efficiency could be more than 45%.
An online refueling system is designed for TMSR-LF. The excess reactivity can
be kept at a low level because of online refueling. An online off-gas system is also
design for TMSR-LF, which can remove gaseous fission products online, including
Xe, He, and T. Thus, the neutron efficiency can be improved, while the require-
ments of the reactivity control system can be reduced.
A passive residual heat removal system is designed to remove the heat during
accidents at the TMSR-LF. A passive fuel salt discharging system with a freezing
valve is designed to shut down and remove heat in extreme accidents.
The plant of TMSR-LF is separated into a nuclear island, a conventional island,
and a service region. The nuclear island is placed underground to improve safety.
The conventional island is located close to the nuclear island and the cooling towers
are located close to the turbine-generators to minimize the heat transfer distances.
The buildings of potential auxiliary applications, such as hydrogen production and
seawater desalination, are also located in the conventional island. The administra-
tion building, the plant services building, and the training buildings are located in
the service region and near the entrance of the plant. The layout of TMSR-LF
nuclear island and reactor body is shown in Fig. 17.2.
Figure 17.2 Layout of TMSR-LF nuclear island and reactor body.
533
Thorium molten salt reactor nuclear energy system (TMSR)

TMSR-LF adopts a modular design, in which the lifetime of the reactor body
module is about 5 years. Installation and replacement of each module is simple, and
it is easy to maintain. As shown in Fig. 17.2, the reactor vessel and primary circuit
(pump and the main heat exchanger) are both located inside a steel containment,
which is a safety barrier. Also, the gas layer between the containment and reactor
vessel can be used for tritium removal.
17.2.2
Safety features of TMSR-LF
Compared to the third-generation reactors, TMSR-LF meets high level safety
standards, including intrinsic safety and the ability to contain radioactivity.
TMSR-LF is intrinsically safe, which is shown in the following aspects. It
operates at near atmospheric pressure, so the reactor vessel and the loops used in
TMSR-LF need only low-pressure resistance. The fuel salt has higher boiling tem-
perature (as high as 1400C) and higher volumetric heat capacity compared to other
typical coolants. Therefore, the fuel salt can absorb large amounts of heat in acci-
dents, which will slow the progression of accidents. It is operated with negative
coolant temperature reactivity coefficient, and low excessive reactivity due to the
online refueling.
The safety system of TMSR-LF includes: passive residual heat removal system
to cool the reactor core during an emergency, and a passive system to discharge the
fuel salt to the drain tank at high temperature, which would shut down the reactor
directly.
TMSR-LF has a good ability for radioactivity retention. Some accidents can be
avoided, such as large break loss of coolant accident (LBLOCA), etc. Most radioac-
tive nuclides, such as Cs-137, I-131, and Sr-90, are soluble in the salt which prevents
the leaking of radioactivity to the environment. The reactor vessel and containment
are used to prevent radioactivity leakage. Underground construction is adopted to
prevent leaking of radioactivity, resist natural disasters, and terrorist attacks.
17.2.3
Advanced Th-U fuel cycle based on TMSR-LF
The Th-U fuel cycle has several advantages compared to the U-Pu fuel cycle:
1. The thermal capture cross-section of Th-232 (7.4 barns) is about three times higher than
U-238 (2.7 barns) while that of U-233 (45.76 barns) is much smaller than that of Pu-239
(268 barns). It means that U-233 has higher production and lower consumption compared
with Pu-239 in thermal reactors. With the effective fission neutron number higher than 2
in the whole spectrum region, U-233 can be bred in both thermal and fast reactors. In
addition, the long-lived minor actinide (MA) resulting from fission is much lower in the
Th-U fuel cycle compared with the U-Pu fuel cycle. Therefore, U-233 has better neutron
economy than Pu-239 in the thermal neutron energy region and the Th-U fuel cycle is the
only one that can breed in thermal reactors with significantly reduced fissile inventory.
2. There is a benefit from the very low actinide production; the Th-U fuel cycle is also very
attractive in fast reactors compared with the U-Pu fuel cycle, which breeds too much MA.
In fast reactors, compared with Pu-239 the η (the number of fission neutrons produced per
534
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

absorption) of U-233 is lower, so the breeding ratio of Th-U is lower than in the U-Pu
cycle. However, Th-U fuel cycle is the best choice for trans-uranium (TRU) incineration
in fast reactors. The breeding of U-233 and TRU incineration can be achieved in the same
reactor simultaneously.
3. As one of the six Gen-IV reactor candidates the liquid-fueled thorium molten salt reactor
(MSR-LF) is a class of liquid fuel reactors, in which nuclear fuel is dissolved in molten
fluoride used as the primary coolant. Pyro-reprocessing can be applied in the MSR-LF
system to separate isotopes simultaneously, so that online reprocessing and breeding of
nuclear fuel can be achieved. Such a scenario is particularly suitable for the use of tho-
rium fuel.
TMSR-LF is the optimal choice for the Th-U fuel cycle. The goal of TMSR-LF is to
improve thorium resource utilization, minimize nuclear waste, promote nuclear nonpro-
liferationn and finally realize a fully closed Th-U fuel cycle. The advanced Th-U fuel
cycle system consists of a molten salt reactor, online degassing (Xe, He, T), an online/
offline fuel processing system, and a fuel salt preparation and reconstruction system.
Continuously removing gaseous FPs and online refueling are implemented. After
several years’ operation, the whole core fuel salt is discharged, offline U&Th
recycling is made for the discharged fuel salt, and finally the recycled fuel salt
is reloaded to core for operation. In the processing, FP&MA are kept for interim
storage and only U&Th are recycled.
1. In the first phase this fuel cycle uses LEU 1 Th as fuel loading, and then it gradually trans-
forms to the Th cycle. In the future, the system would use U-233 1 Th as standard fuel.
2. In the second phase online gaseous FP extraction and online U extraction and reinjection
will be adopted for continuously recycling of U and enhancing the fuel utilization ratio.
At the same time, offline batch processing and recycling residual U and Th will also be
implemented. In the processing FP & MA are also kept for interim storage.
3. In the third phase, the fully closed fuel cycle will use online gaseous FP extraction, online
U extraction and reinjection as in the second step above. However, offline TRU separation
and reinjection are implemented in this step. In this processing, all heavy elements are
recycled, and only FPs and a small amount of U and MA loss need geologic disposal. The
fully closed fuel cycle can have three different recycle optional modes: burners, breeders,
and break-even.

17.3.1
Design overview of TMSR-SF
The TMSR-SF is a small modular fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactor
(FHR) with electrical power of 168 MWe. TRISO fuel particles, like those of
535
Thorium molten salt reactor nuclear energy system (TMSR)

a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor, cooled by molten salt, with a passive natural
circulation heat removal system can achieve high-temperature output and inherent
safety under near-ambient pressure. The reactor adopts a simplified modular design,
online refueling strategy, and water-free cooling to expand its applications in differ-
ent conditions.
The major nuclear heat supply system of TMSR-SF consists of a pebble-bed
core, reactor internals, a reactivity control system, a fuel handling system, a coolant
system, and a passive decay heat removal system. During normal operation, energy
is produced by fuel pebbles in core, then transferred to the primary loop and sec-
ondary salt loop using forced circulation. Salt-air heat exchangers are employed to
translate nuclear heat to an open air Brayton cycle system and Rankine cycle.
A fully passive residual heat removal system is utilized for emergency conditions.
The active core region of TMSR-SF is constructed with graphite internals
enclosing a top cone, a bottom cone and a middle cylindrical zone. The reactor core
size is finely optimized to match transportation demand by railway and highway for
the modular design. The active region is 250-cm diameter and 420-cm-equivalent
height. The graphite reflector is a cylinder with 350-cm outer-diameter and 650-cm
height. An online fuel handing system is employed to achieve high discharge burn-
up, high loading factor, and automated fuel management. Discharge fuel burnup is
about 180 GWd/tonHM.
The TMSR-SF fuel pebbles are 30-mm diameter, spherical fuel elements with
tristructural isotropic (TRISO)-coated particles dispersed in the graphite matrix.
Each pebble contains about 2400 microfuel particles with 500-μm uranium kernels
(19.75% enriched uranium). When the core is full it contains about 870,000 fuel
pebbles randomly packed in the core. A fuel handling system circulates the pebbles,
performing six functions:
1. Pebble loading and discharge;
2. Pebble purification;
3. Pebble monitoring;
4. Pebble transfer;

5. Pebble storage;
6. Pebble replenishment.
A mechanical system combined with effects of buoyancy and pebble gravity is
used to implement fuel pebble loading and discharge.
Reactivity control is achieved by using control rods (the first shutdown system)
and shutdown blades system (the second shutdown system). The control rods sys-
tem consists of 12 rectangle rods, which move vertically in the SiC plate cut chan-
nels to control the reactivity during normal operation. The control blades system
consists of eight shutdown blades, which insert directly through the upper-center
graphite reflector into the pebble bed during emergency shutdown. The rods and
blades contain natural (unenriched) boron carbide and are clad with nickel-based
alloy. Reactivity control systems can provide sufficient shutdown to shut down the
reactor and maintain subcritical conditions.
The reactor vessel defines the pressure boundary of the primary coolant. The
reactor vessel houses the graphite structures, core barrel, control rods, fuel pebble
loading/unloading devices, and so on. Because of the near-ambient operating
pressure the reactor vessel can be much thinner than for high-pressure reactors.
The reactor coolant system consists of two branches, each having a primary loop
coupled to a secondary loop by an intermediate heat exchanger. This redundancy
provides a high level of safety when one branch encounters an accident. In each
branch, there are two pumps, one salt/salt heat exchanger and one salt/air heat
exchanger. The secondary loop is used to isolate the primary loop from the high-
pressure air loop, also as a radioactivity isolation loop. The two primary loops are
designed with compact layouts for safety considerations.
There are salt/air heat exchangers in both secondary loops, which transfer heat
from salt in the secondary loops to the compressed air coming from the power con-
version unit (PCU). Both of the coolants in the salt/air heat exchanger flow under
forced circulation. The salt/air heat exchangers are spirally fluted tube-shell type
exchangers that ensure enhanced heat convection. Under normal operation, the heat
exchanger system also has the capability to deal with the great pressure difference
between the salt side and the air side.
TMSR-SF uses an open air Brayton and steam Rankine combined cycle, in
which the thermoelectric conversion efficiency could be more than 45%. The PCU
include compressor, turbines, generators, residual heat recovery units, etc. The air
used in the Brayton cycle should be purified primarily. Hot, compressed air flowing
from a salt-air heat exchanger drives turbines to produce electricity. Residual heat
in air after the air Brayton cycle will be collected to drive the steam Rankine
combined cycle (Fig. 17.3).
17.3.2
Safety features of TMSR-SF
The inherent safety, passive and active safety systems are combined to achieve
a high level of safety in TMSR-SF. Inherent safety characteristics include
near-ambient pressure, low excess reactivity, passive residual heat removal
537
Thorium molten salt reactor nuclear energy system (TMSR)

systems, a large margin of fuel temperature, large thermal capacity, negative
coolant temperature reactivity coefficient, and radioactive nuclide retention by salt.
The emergency safety system consists of two dependent reactor shutdown systems
and a passive decay heat removal system. A confinement building is employed to
prevent radioactivity diffusion as the last barrier. These inherent safety characteris-
tics and safety system will greatly increase the safety level and alleviate accident
consequences.
Under accident conditions (such as loss of forced convection circulation acci-
dent), a fully passive residual heat removal system based on natural circulation of
molten salt and air will be put into operation and discharge the residual heat into
the atmosphere. It consists of four independent trains. The rated discharge heat is
designed to be 2% of total power. After safe shutdown, the decay heat of the reactor
will be exported into the environment through a pool reactor auxiliary cooling sys-
tem (PRACS), a direct reactor auxiliary cooling system (DRACS), and a natural
convection cooling tower.

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

TMSR-SF contains two sets of shutdown systems including eight rods and 12
blades to reach safe shutdown during accidents. The two shutdown systems use
different driving mechanisms, which will automatically go down in accidents.
The confinement system is designed to isolate the radioactive fission products
under design basis accidents, and to restrict and retard the radiation leakage under
severe accidents. The TRISO particles can maintain a quite large temperature mar-
gin from the design limitation of 1600C, resulting in no massive release of radia-
tion. Because of near-ambient pressure in the primary loop, there will be no large
break accident. The molten salt bears an extremely high boiling point (1430C), so
coolant leakage in break accident will not follow a similar pattern in Pressurized
water reactor (PWR) with instant jet flow and flashing phenomenon leading to
catastrophic pressure rise inside the confinement. In contrast to conventional
PWR, molten salt coolant has a large degree of retention on some of the important
radioactive elements, such as CS-137, I-131, and Sr-90, etc.
With online pebble fuel circulation, TMSR-SF is operated with small excessive
reactivity during normal operation. The reactivity induced by loading or unloading
one pebble is small and would not affect the operation of the reactor. The high heat
capacity of the coolant and graphite can minimize coolant temperature fluctuation
and allow operators enough time to intervene before the occurrence of accidents.
17.3.3
Multipurpose utilization of nuclear energy
based on TMSR-SF
The TMSR-SF has outstanding suitability for the comprehensive utilization of
nuclear power, based on hydrogen production. TMSR-SF is a multipurpose clean
energy supplier designed for electricity production, hydrogen or methyl alcohol pro-
duction, steam supply, heat delivering, seawater desalination, etc. TMSR-SF, based
on modularized design and waterless cooling, is suitable for a variety of areas, such
as remote areas, seaside, arid areas, hilly areas, mineral areas, and underground
holes. Fig 17.4 shows different multipurpose applications of TMSR-SF.
In TMSR, the multipurpose utilization of nuclear energy includes two fields.
On the one hand, nonelectric applications of nuclear energy could present sustain-
able solutions for many energy challenges that current and future generations will
have to face. There is growing interest around the world in using molten salt reac-
tor nuclear energy systems for such applications as nuclear hydrogen production,
district heating, various industrial applications, seawater desalination, and chemi-
cal or fuel production (see Chapter 3: Chemical fundamentals and other
applications).
On the other hand, many technologies, such as molten salt material preparation
and purification, molten salt loops, and instruments for molten salt reactors have
been developed. All these technologies can be applied in thermal energy utilization
fields, including concentrated solar power, thermal storage in grid, and waste heat
recovery.

Introduction
Fig. 18.1 shows the 400 MWth Integral Molten Salt Reactor (IMSR400).
The IMSR400 is a small modular molten salt-fueled reactor. It features a
completely sealed reactor vessel with integrated pumps, heat exchangers, and shut-
down rods. This vessel, called the IMSR core-unit, is replaced completely as a
single unit at the end of its useful service life (nominally 7 years). This allows
factory production levels of quality control and economy, while avoiding any need
to open and service the reactor vessel at the power plant site. The heat transfer
paths are shown in Fig. 18.2.
The IMSR uses molten fluoride salt, a highly stable, inert liquid with robust
coolant properties and high intrinsic radionuclide retention properties, for its pri-
mary fuel salt. A secondary, coolant salt loop, also using a fluoride salt (but without
fuel), transfers heat away from the primary heat exchangers integrated inside the
core-unit. As shown in Fig. 18.2, the coolant salt loop, in turn, transfers its heat
load to a solar salt loop, which is pumped out of the nuclear island to a separate
building where it either heats steam generators that generate superheated steam for
power generation or is used for process heat applications.
The design is based heavily on the intensive molten salt reactor (MSR) project
of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in the 1950s70s. In this project,

extensive R&D was done and MSR materials and equipment were developed. This
included such items as suitable graphite to act as neutron moderator, drain tanks for
the salts, and hot cells for housing the equipment, pumps, and heat exchangers.
The ORNL program culminated in the construction and successful operation of the
Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). The MSRE employed a molten fluoride
fuel salt, which was also the primary coolant. This fuelcoolant mixture was circu-
lated between a critical graphite-moderated core and external heat exchangers. The
IMSR is essentially a reconfigured, scaled-up version of the MSRE. This minimizes
required research and development (R&D). The IMSR has also been influenced
by a more recent ORNL design, the small modular advanced high-temperature reac-
tor (SmAHTR) which was to use solid fuel with fluoride salt coolant, but had an
“integral” architecture where all primary pumps, heat exchangers, and control rods
are integrated inside the sealed reactor vessel.
The safety philosophy behind the IMSR is to produce a nuclear power plant with
generation IV reactor levels of safety. For ultimate safety, there is no dependence
on operator intervention, powered mechanical components, coolant injection or
their support systems, such as electricity supply or instrument air in dealing with
upset conditions. This is achieved through a combination of design features:
G
The inert, stable properties of the salt;
G
An inherently stable nuclear core;
G
Fully passive backup core and containment cooling systems;
G
An integral reactor architecture.
18.2
Description of nuclear systems
Fig. 18.3 shows one of the core-units.
The IMSR is an integral nuclear reactor design. This means that the reactor core,
pumps, heat exchangers, and control rods are all mounted inside a single vessel,
which is referred to as the IMSR core-unit. This core-unit is manufactured in a con-
trolled factory environment and then brought to the reactor power plant site where,
following final assembly, it is lowered into a surrounding guard (containment) ves-
sel which itself sits in a below-grade reactor silo. There, the core-unit is connected
to secondary piping, which contains a nonradioactive coolant salt. For optimal
safety and containment, this coolant salt is used as an inert, low-pressure intermedi-
ate loop between the critical reactor circuit and the steam power generation circuit.
The steam circuit powers a conventional, off-the-shelf industrial steam turbine for
power generation and/or industrial steam production, depending on the required
application. Alternatively, some or all of the hot molten salt may be sent directly to
a process heat application.
Since it is a liquid fuel reactor, there are no fuel elements in the reactor core.
The fuel may consist of low-enriched uranium fluoride, plutonium fluoride, thorium
fluoride, or any mixture of these. The first of a kind IMSR400, however, will utilize
a once-through, low-enriched uranium fuel cycle as this is the simplest option. This
543
Integral molten salt reactor

fuel salt is diluted with coolant salt, consisting of fluorides such as sodium fluoride,
beryllium fluoride, and/or lithium fluoride. This mixture constitutes both fuel and
primary coolant. The fuelcoolant mixture is pumped between a critical, graphite-
moderated (thermal spectrum) core, and then through the integral heat exchangers to
transfer its heat to the secondary, coolant salt loop (Fig. 18.2). The secondary loop
consists of bare diluent salts (without fuel salt added), that in turn transfer its heat to
a third salt loop. This third loop improves safety by adding another barrier between
the radioactive primary inventory and the steam turbine. It uses a “solar salt” (nitrate
salt), for its lower melting point (to avoid steam generator freezing) and compatibil-
ity with steam (in the event of a leak). Finally, the third loop steam generator pro-
duces steam for process heat or to power a steam turbinegenerator set.
This fuel is separately brought to the power plant site as a solid, where it is
melted and added to the IMSR core-unit. This allows the IMSR to operate with
online fueling. Additionally, and unlike solid-fuel reactors, there is no need to
remove a proportion of old fuel during makeup fueling. All of the fuel stays inside
the closed IMSR core-unit during the entire power operations period of the core-
unit. The volume of small amounts of additional “makeup” fuel salt is simply
accommodated in the upper gas plenum. Unlike other power reactor systems, the
IMSR core-unit needs never be opened at the power plant site, either during start-
up fueling or during refueling. After B7 years of power operation, the core-unit is
shut down and after a cool-down period, the used fuel charge is pumped out to
robust holding tanks located inside the containment. The spent, empty core-unit is
then allowed to cool down for several more years, at which point its radioactivity
has diminished sufficiently to permit its safe removal from its containment silo.
The IMSR400 is a single unit plant, however two core-unit silos are used, to allow

switch-loading of the silos: this allows a long period of cool-down for the spent
silo, while another is connected by switching over the secondary, coolant salt lines
to the new unit. After this long cool-down period, the spent, empty core-unit is then
moved into a long-term storage silo where it can stay for an extended period.
Beyond this period the core-unit can be shipped to a central facility, to be recycled
or prepared for geological sequestration. Similarly the separately stored spent fuel
charge can also be shipped to a central facility to recover the fuel or for conversion
to a form for sequestration. This sealed, integral reactor architecture and once-
through, “burner” fuel cycle mode allows the actual power plant site to always
operate in a clean, simple environment without risk of facility contamination.

Description of safety concept
All nuclear power reactors must fulfill three fundamental safety requirements:
G
The chain reaction must be controlled;
G
Sufficient cooling must be provided to transfer heat out of the reactor core;
G
The radioactive materials must be contained inside the plant.
The basic design approach to safety in the IMSR is to achieve an inherent, walk-
away safe nuclear plant. No operator action, electricity, or externally powered
mechanical components are needed to assure the most basic safety functions:
G
Control: failure of control systems or reactivity insertion events only leads to reactor sta-
bilization at a slightly higher temperature.
G
Cool: inherent heat sinks are available initially to absorb transient and decay heat, with
heat losses providing long-term cooling for both core and containment.
Figure 18.4 Cut-away view into the reactor auxiliary building.
545
Integral molten salt reactor

G
Contain: the fluoride salts are chemically stable, bind radioactive fission products to the
salt, and have extremely high boiling points. Multiple engineered barriers are provided as
backup to this inherent containment. Partial entrenchment of the reactor, combined with
thick concrete and steel shielding, provides resistance to external events such as earth-
quakes, explosions, and aircraft crash.
An important part of the IMSR safety philosophy is to start by removing drivers
that push radioactive material into the environment. Specifically, the reactor always
operates at low pressure due to the inert, low-volatile fuelcoolant mixture and the
absence of water or steam in the reactor. As the materials employed in the reactor
system and even the interfacing systems, are all chemically compatible with each
other, there is no potential for adverse chemical reactions such as fuel cladding
hydrogen production or sodium reactions with air or water. This approach
completely eliminates stored energy, both physical and chemical, from the reactor
system. The IMSR further augments this high level of inherent, physics-based
safety with its integrated, pipeless, failsafe systems architecture. The result is a sim-
ple and robust system with inherent safety.
In light-water reactors (LWRs) the safety concept is dependent on providing suf-
ficient coolant flow to the solid fuel assemblies at all times. This must occur at high
pressure. During loss of coolant accidents (LOCA) such as pipe leaks or breaks, reli-
able depressurization is required, followed by low-pressure coolant injection. These
systems require various mechanical, electrical/control systems, instrumentation/
sensing, instrument air, and other support systems to operate reliably.
The IMSR does not depend on depressurizing the reactor or bringing coolant to
the reactor. All required control and heat sink functions are already present where
they are needed—in and directly around the IMSR core-unit. As such the IMSR
completely eliminates any dependence on support systems, valves, pumps, and
operator actions. This is the case in both the short term and the long term. To make
this possible, IMSR designers have combined MSR technology with integral reactor
design and a unique cooling system.
Reactor criticality control is assured through a negative temperature feedback
made possible by molten salt fuel. This negative temperature feedback assures reac-
tor safety on overheating, even with loss of all control systems. Molten salt fuel
does not degrade by heat or radiation, so there are effectively no reactor power lim-
its to the fuel.
The unique cooling system is based on heat capacity and heat loss—which are
immutable. Heat capacity is due to the thermal mass of the fuel salt, vessel metal,
and graphite. Heat loss occurs as the reactor vessel is not insulated. Short-term
cooling is provided by the low power density core-unit, and the internal natural cir-
culation capability of the fluoride fuel salt, resulting in a large capacity to absorb
transient and decay heat generation. Longer-term cooling is provided by heat loss
from the uninsulated reactor vessel which itself is enveloped by a guard vessel.
This guard vessel is a closed vessel that envelops the core-unit, providing contain-
ment and cooling through its vessel wall. Overheating of the core-unit will cause
the core-unit to heat up and increase heat loss from the core-unit, in turn increasing
546
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

heat transfer, via thermal radiation, to the guard vessel. The guard vessel in turn is
surrounded by a robust air-cooling jacket. This cooling jacket will provide long-
term cooling. The cooling jacket operates at atmospheric pressure so will continue
to cool in the event of a leak or damage to the jacket.
The guard vessel containment is provided as an additional hermetic barrier in the
extremely unlikely event that the integral core-unit itself would experience major
failures. Without sources of pressure in the core-unit or in the containment itself,
the containment is never challenged by pressure. Overheating of the containment is
precluded by the balance of heat losses and heat generation even if the core-unit
would fail. The containment itself is covered by thick horizontal steel radiation
shield plates at the top. These plates also provide protection against extreme exter-
nal events such as aircraft crash or explosion pressure waves, and provide an addi-
tional heat sink in any overheating scenario.
Fig. 18.5 shows the core heat removal system.
The IMSR has a highly attractive seismic profile due to its compact, integral
(pipeless) primary system. In addition, the below-grade silo housing the core-unit,
and low profile buildings, result in a very low center of gravity. Apart from the
reactor system and buildings themselves, earthquakes can often threaten support
systems such as main power, backup power, battery power, instrumentation and
control systems, emergency coolant injection lines, or pneumatic and hydraulic
systems. As the IMSR does not rely on any of these support systems, or even the
cooling jacket, for ultimate safety, the IMSR’s safety is inherently insensitive to
earthquakes.
Figure 18.5 The core-unit loses heat to an enveloping guard vessel, which in turn loses heat
to a passive air-cooling jacket. This provides backup cooling in the unlikely event all of the
redundant normal heat exchangers are unavailable for any reason.
547
Integral molten salt reactor

The IMSR system is a high-temperature reactor system whose key safety systems
are designed for extreme normal and emergency temperature profiles. No support
systems are required for safe shutdown. As a result of these features, the design is
inherently insensitive to fires.
As explained above, ultimate safety is provided by inherent and fail-safe fea-
tures. Nevertheless, with a view of further improving the robustness of the design,
to improve the reliability, and as investment protection, a considerable amount of
defense-in-depth is built into the systems. For the control function, redundant, shut-
down rods are also integrated into the IMSR core-unit. These shutdown rods will
shut down the reactor upon loss of forced circulation and will also insert upon loss
of power. Another backup is provided in the form of meltable cans, filled with a
liquid neutron-absorbing material that will shut down the reactor on overheating.
A complete loss of flow is however itself unlikely, as redundant primary pumps are
used for circulating the fuel salt, so that the system can continue to operate at full
power with any single pump failed or tripped, and slightly derated operation is pos-
sible with any two pumps failed or tripped. Similarly, to drive the pumps, conven-
tional backup engine-driven power is available upon loss of main power. For
containment, in addition to the inherently stable salt properties that act as physical
and chemical containment, the integrated reactor architecture maximizes the integ-
rity of the primary reactor system, the core-unit. This makes leaks very unlikely.
Should any leaks occur, a conventional, leak-tight containment is also provided.
Overpressure failure is not a plausible event due to the very high boiling points of
the salts and to a lack of pressurization sources inside the core-unit and even in
interfacing systems. Overheating failure of the core-unit is precluded by the use of
high-quality, high-temperature capable materials in conjunction with the inherent
heat loss to the surrounding passive cooling jacket.
18.4
Proliferation defenses
The IMSR has intrinsic, design, and procedural features that resist proliferation of
fissile materials for weapons production:
1. Fuel cycle: The IMSR core-unit itself is fueled with low-enriched uranium on a once-
through fuel cycle without fuel processing. There is no need for highly enriched uranium,
and, with no fuel processing on-site, there is no possibility of separating fissile materials
from the bulk of fuel salt. In addition, the high burnup and lack of online fuel removal
from the IMSR core-unit results in extremely poor isotopic quality in the spent fuel inven-
tory. In a MSR such as the IMSR, fuel and coolant are intrinsically mixed. Removal of
any significant amount of fuel therefore entails the removal of much larger volumes of
coolant salt. Any future fuel processing would be done in a secure, centralized facility.
2. Systems design: The plant engineering does not allow the removal of significant quantities
of fuel salt to small, and thus mobile, shielded containers during normal operation. Fuel is
added to the core-unit, fuel salt need not be removed during the 7-year cycle. Minor trans-
fers for chemistry monitoring and control, or for final spent fuel salt transfer to large
shielded holding tanks will be completely human-inaccessible due to the high-temperature
548
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

and radiation levels. Any future transfer of spent fuel salt for sequestration or processing
will involve time-consuming protocols under full supervision. Such off-site transfers
would entail full self-protection due to activity levels of contained fission products.
3. Procedural controls: The IMSR will comply with all IAEA proliferation safeguards, pro-
cedural controls, monitoring, and other requirements.
18.5
Safety and security (physical protection)
The IMSR is a MSR, having a highly radioactive primary fuelcoolant loop. In
addition, the high operating temperature means special shielded, insulated cells and
systems will be employed. These features make the reactor design highly inaccessi-
ble to potential sabotage or terrorist attack. The IMSR also employs the integral
architecture, which produces a compact, robust, and fully sealed primary core-heat
exchanger unit. Another design feature that protects against external threats is the
provision of a hardened below-grade silo as the holding cell for the core-unit. Such
hardening and below-grade construction provides superior protection against exter-
nal events. The core-unit itself is provided with additional layers of protection: a
sealed guard vessel surrounding the bottom and sides of the core-unit, and a steel
containment plate at the top. This containment head plate is made of very thick
steel primarily for radiation shielding, which also makes for a high-strength, ductile
external-events shield capable of stopping the impact of a large commercial aircraft
crash or explosive devices. Because the IMSR does not rely on any support sys-
tems, any attack on such support systems does not impede any of the three primary
safety functions—control, cooling, and containment—of the IMSR.
18.6
Description of turbinegenerator systems
The turbinegenerator system does not serve any safety-related mission and is not
needed for ultimate safe shutdown of the IMSR core-unit. Therefore, the IMSR will
employ a standard, off-the-shelf, industrial-grade superheated steam turbine plant.
The use of a standard turbine avoids the necessity of having to develop a new tur-
bine and control system for the IMSR, and allows the highly flexible and reliable
industrial-grade steam turbines to be used, that can be sourced from a variety of
major suppliers. These steam turbines are highly flexible, being capable of high
degrees of bleed off steam for cogeneration/industrial heat purposes, whilst also
being capable of operating as condensing (power-generating) turbine-only if
required. This affords the IMSR access to many industrial power and heat markets
such as steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), chemicals production, paper and
pulp production, desalination, etc. In fact, these turbines, powered by fossil fuel boi-
lers, are widely used already in many such industries today. The turbinegenerator
is a simple and compact, high-speed, skid-mounted design. A gearbox couples the
high-speed turbine to a lower-speed, 15001800 RPM electrical generator.
549

18.7
Electrical and I&C systems
The IMSR does not depend on electrical or even I&C systems for ultimate safety.
For operability and investment protection, a few additional requirements do exist,
such as freeze protection, as the fluoride salts have high freezing points. The normal
plant operations systems provide this protection, in the form of pump trips, electri-
cal (trace) heating, and thermocouple sensors. As with the steam turbinegenerator,
this type of equipment is available off-the-shelf from many suppliers. The pumps
are the primary control units, as passive, flow-driven control rods are utilized. This
links the trip and protection logic to the pump rather than to a control rod drive and
logic system. The result is a simple and easy to control system where the only real
variable to control actively is the pump speed (trace heating is typically kept in
automatic mode for normal operations). For example, to rapidly shut down the reac-
tor, no control rod drives, drive power, hydraulic supply, or other support systems
are needed; instead the pumps are simply tripped. The simplicity of this approach
and the lack of dependence on any electrical systems also means that cybersecurity
is easy to address.
As the IMSR does not depend on the electrical systems for ultimate safety, the
design of a detailed plant electrical and control room system is eased. However, as
with the steam turbinegenerator, standard, off-the-shelf industrial equipment is
expected to be used due to the generic nature of the requirements.
18.8
Spent fuel and waste management
The IMSR utilizes nuclear fuel with far greater efficiency than LWRs. There are
three basic factors that improve the fuel utilization of the IMSR compared to LWRs:
1. The thermal-to-electrical efficiency is high: despite the modest size, the IMSR400 features
higher plant electrical efficiency than LWRs. Depending on heat sink conditions and
balance-of-plant arrangement, the IMSR400 generates 185192 MWe from 400 MWth,
resulting in a net efficiency of some 46%48%.
2. The fuel burnup is high: rather than removing fuel from the reactor, new fuel is simply
added to the total fuel charge forming the reactor core. The high burnup and retention of
fuel inside the core results in improved plutonium and minor actinide burning capability.
3. Without fuel cladding, internal metallic structures or H2O, and with the IMSR design permit-
ting the passive exit of xenon from the core, there are far fewer parasitic neutron captures.
An additional advantage of the design is that its spent liquid fuel inventory is
much easier to recycle than solid fuel elements, making it more attractive to recycle
the fuel. As the fuel does not degrade, it can potentially be recycled many times. If
fuel recycling is employed, Terrestrial Energy envisages this to occur in a central
fuel recycling center, servicing many IMSR power plants.
The design also makes efficient use of engineering and construction materials.
This is mostly due to the low operating pressure and lack of stored energy in the salts,
eliminating the need for massive pressure vessels, pipe restraints, and containment
550
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

buildings. High pressures are confined to the steam turbine plant, which is a very
compact, standard industrial-grade unit. The salts also have high volumetric heat
capacity resulting in compact heat exchangers, pumps, and other heat transport
equipment. The result is very compact equipment and small buildings.
The IMSR features a fully sealed unit, avoiding the need to open the reactor ves-
sel during operation. This feature greatly reduces expected dose rates to personnel,
and avoids the generation of large amounts of contaminated drainage water and
disposables.
18.9
Plant layout
The IMSR core-unit is housed in a below-grade silo. This forms the heart of the
IMSR system. Surrounding the core-unit are the guard vessel cooling jacket, and at
the top, a removable steel containment head plate. All these components are located
below-grade as well. Above the containment head, shield plates cover the core-unit
for radiation shielding. An idle silo is provided next to the active silo, so that this
silo can be loaded with a new core-unit while facilitating cool down of a spent
core-unit. These two silos make up the main components of the reactor building.
After draining the spent core-unit followed by a cool-down period, the empty spent
module is then lifted out and stored in long-term storage silos in an area adjacent to
the reactor building. Inlets and outlets are provided for the (nonradioactive) coolant
salt lines coming into and out of the core-unit, which transfer the heat to steam gen-
erators and reheaters. The coolant salt lines are located inside the reactor building.
The steam and reheat steam are utilized in a conventional, off-the-shelf turbi-
negenerator system located in an adjacent building (Fig. 18.6).
Figure 18.6 IMSR400 plant layout.

18.10
Plant performance
The IMSR plant is designed to accommodate various load users, from baseload to
load-following. Featuring a simple modular and replaceable core-unit, very high
reliability ratings are targeted. The core-unit has only a few moving parts (pumps)
and these are redundantly fitted. Even premature replacement of a faulty module
only mildly affects reliability and levelized cost. The use of an idling silo greatly
increases plant capacity factor, as long cool-down times (for radiation dose reduc-
tion) are possible without plant downtime.
The IMSR has been specifically designed for factory fabrication. Nuclear com-
ponents are small and road-transportable. The IMSR core-unit is designed for a
short service lifetime, which allows dedicated factory lines to produce the units
semiautomatically, similar to aircraft jet engine production lines, for example.
The IMSR reactor building has a low profile and low mass, allowing rapid con-
struction. The reactor building is a simple lightweight industrial building as it does
not serve any major safety-related function—these are all provided by dedicated,
robust, fail-safe systems.
Being a MSR, the IMSR has low fuel reload costs; fuel fabrication costs are
zero, only extensive purification of the salts is required which, being bulk chemical
processing, has a much lower cost than traditional high-precision fuel fabrication
with all its quality and process control costs. Fuel recycling costs are also much
lower with molten salt fuels, as costly fuel deconstruction and reconstruction steps
are avoided and also because simple, compact, low waste volume creating distilla-
tion and fluorination processes can be utilized. This makes it likely that spent
IMSR fuel will be recycled.
18.11
Development status of technologies relevant
to the NPP
The IMSR is a simplified burner-type MSR. All of the basic technology has been
proven during the operation of the MSRE at Oak Ridge National Laboratories. The
MSRE was a fully functional burner-type MSR. Heat exchangers, pumps,
suitable graphites, fuel salts and purification steps, off-gas systems, fuel addition
mechanisms, as well as alloys of construction were all successfully developed. The
IMSR builds on this rich experimental evidence to assure a high degree of techno-
logical maturity. The IMSR utilizes an off-the-shelf industrial-grade steam turbi-
negenerator. Molten salt heated steam generators are also proven technology,
with recent and very successful experience in advanced, large-scale, salt-cooled
concentrated solar power (CSP) projects. Similarly water-cooled silo liners have
been successfully employed in many nuclear reactor systems. Other technologies,
such as tritium capture and management, are also proven technologies in the
nuclear industry with a wide and current experience base in LWRs and high-
temperature reactors. There are only a few components that have not been used
552
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

before, such as the air-cooling jacket. These components are technologically simple
and their proper function will be verified in large-scale non-nuclear testing.
18.12
Deployment status and planned schedule
This phase of work involves the support of a growing number of universities, third-
party laboratories, and industrial partners. In addition, the Canadian nuclear regula-
tor, the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC), at the request of Terrestrial
Energy Inc. (TEI), has started Phase 1 of a prelicensing Vendor Design Review of
the IMSR. This is an assessment of a nuclear power plant design based on a ven-
dor’s reactor technology. The assessment is completed by the CNSC, at the request
of the vendor. The word “prelicensing” signifies that a design review is undertaken
prior to the submission of a license application to the CNSC by an applicant seek-
ing to build and operate a new nuclear power plant. This review does not certify a
reactor design or involve the issuance of a license under the Nuclear Safety and
Control Act, and it is not required as part of the licensing process for a new nuclear
power plant.
The basic engineering phase will be followed by the construction and start-up of
a first full-scale commercial IMSR NNP at a site in Canada after securing all neces-
sary operating licenses from the CNSC (and licenses from other authorities), a pro-
cess that can be completed by early in the 2020s.

Need for deployment
As of June, 2013, a total of 1199 coal plants were planned for construction world-
wide, with a nameplate capacity of 1401 GWe. Each year these 1200 coal power
plants will require 5 billion tons of coal, will emit 12 billion tons of CO2 into the
environment, and will kill at least 400,000 people. The world needs clean energy to
avoid these deaths, environmental pollution, and waste of resources. Molten salt
reactors (MSRs) could help alleviate the situation if they could be deployed suc-
cessfully (Devanney et al., 2017, 2016, 2015).
Any new power plant should satisfy the goals of the utility companies that build
and operate them, and should be acceptable to the public (Chapter 1: Introduction).
Here we will illustrate one design that is aimed at fast deployment based on modu-
lar, factory construction, noting that this book does not endorse any particular MSR
company or design.

Modular power plant
“ThorCon” is a molten salt nuclear reactor with liquid fuel, which can be moved
around with a pump, and passively drained in the event of a casualty. It operates at
3 bar, about the same pressure as a garden hose.

The reactor uses normal piping thicknesses and easily automated, steel-plate con-
struction. The entire nuclear portion of the plant is underground as shown in
Fig. 19.1.
The decay heat cooling towers are on the far left. The underground nuclear
island is under the yellow rectangular hatches, served by gantry cranes. The turbo-
generator halls are the large buildings at the center, and the switchyard is on the
right. The main cooling towers, if required, would be to the right of the switchyard.
The cranes allow periodic replacement of all critical components including the
reactors and fuel salt. The reactors and fuel salt are transported by a special-
purpose ship shown in the background.
Fig. 19.2 is a cutaway view of the underground structure.
The reactor is divided into 250-MWe power modules. The drawing shows two
such modules. Each module contains two replaceable reactors in sealed cans (red)
in silos. At any given time, one of the cans of each module is producing power, and
the other can is in cooldown mode. Every 4 years the can that has been cooling is

removed and replaced with a new can, which is then filled with fuel salt. The can
that has been operating goes into cooldown mode.
Each can contains a pot containing liquid fuel, a pump, and a primary heat
exchanger (PHX), with a fuel salt drain tank underneath (Fig. 19.3).
The pot contains graphite moderator and fuel salt (mixture of NaF, BeF2, UF4,
ThF4). The pump pushes just under 3000 kg/s of hot liquid fuel (red pipe, 704C)
downward through the PHX, from where it returns into the pot bottom (green pipe,
564C). The pot gage pressure is 3 bar. The high outlet temperature facilitates an
overall plant efficiency of 45%, and a net electrical output per can of 250 MWe.
Each can is 11.6 m high, 7.3 m diameter, and weighs about 400 tons. The pump
impeller is the only major moving part in the can.
A membrane wall (blue) around the can and drain tank comprises water-filled
vertical steel tubes connected by strips of steel plate welded to the tubes and con-
nected by top and bottom circular headers (Fig. 19.3). The can and fuel drain tank
are cooled by radiation to the membrane wall. Steam from the top header flows by
natural convection up to a condenser and decay heat cooling tower (Fig. 19.1), and
the cool condensed water returns to the bottom header. This cooling process is
totally passive, requiring no operator intervention or outside power.
Each can is located in a silo, as shown in Fig. 19.4. The top of the silo is 14 m
underground (under the yellow hatches of Fig. 19.2).
The heat engine uses four coolant loops to isolate the steam turbine from any
radioactive materials:
1. The primary loop inside the can.
2. The secondary salt loop (dashed green line, mixture of NaF and BeF2).

3. The tertiary “solar salt” loop (pink, mixture of NaNO3 and KNO3).
4. The supercritical steam loop.
Hot secondary salt (dashed green line) is pumped from the PHX to a secondary
heat exchanger (SHX) where it transfers its heat to the solar salt (pink), which
transfers its heat to the supercritical steam loop (red), which drives the steam tur-
bine to generate 250 MWe electrical power, using the same steam cycle as a mod-
ern coal power plant. The solar salt loop captures any tritium that has made it to the
secondary loop.
19.3
Safety features
This reactor design has the following safety features.
19.3.1
Passive, unavoidable shutdown and cooling
The reactor has a negative temperature coefficient of reactivity, which prevents
overheating. At normal operating temperatures, the fuel salt in the fuse valve is fro-
zen. If the fuel salt becomes too hot, the plug will thaw, and the fuel salt will drain
to the fuel drain tank. Since the drain tank has no graphite moderator, fission will
stop quickly, and only fission product decay heat will be generated. This draining is
Figure 19.4 Cross-section of a silo hall (Devanney et al., 2017, 2016, 2015).
560
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

totally passive, and not preventable by operator actions. (Operator error exacerbated
the Three Mile Island accident.)
If the fuel drains, the peak fuel salt temperature 3 hours later would be 960C,
470C below its boiling point. The cooling pool contains a 72-day supply of water.
Safety is ensured without any operator actions, and there is nothing the operators
can do to prevent the draining and cooling. The salt would remain molten for over
100 days, facilitating restart.
19.3.2
Radioactivity release resistance
Four coolant loops isolate the steam turbine from hazardous and radioactive materi-
als. The reactor is 15 m underground, with four gas-tight barriers between the fuel
salt and the atmosphere, and it operates near atmospheric pressure. In the event of a
primary loop rupture there is no dispersal energy and no phase change. The spilled
fuel merely flows to the drain tank where it is passively cooled. The most trouble-
some fission products (including 131I, 90Sr, and 137Cs) are chemically bound to the
salt, ending up in the drain tank. Even if all four barriers were somehow breached,
few of these salt seekers would disperse.
19.3.3
Separate spent fuel storage not required
The reactor uses an 8-year fuel salt processing cycle, after which the used salt is
allowed to cool down in the nonoperating can for 4 years, eliminating the need for
a separate, vulnerable spent fuel storage facility.
19.4
Maintenance
No complex MSR repairs are attempted on site. Everything in the nuclear island
except the building itself is replaceable with little or no interruption in power
output.
Fission product accumulation requires changing the fuel salt after 8 years opera-
tion and 4 years cooling, when the decay heat will be down to 80 kW (0.25% of the
original). The cooled cans are shipped in a special canship to a recycling facility,
where they are disassembled, cleaned, inspected, and worn parts replaced. The fuel
salt going both ways will be unattractive as weapons material. The uranium will be
fully denatured and, after the initial load, contain enough Th-232, U-232, Pu-238,
Pu-240, and Pu-242 to make a weapon infeasible for all but the most advanced
weapons states.
The recycled cans would be disassembled and fully inspected, so incipient pro-
blems would be caught before they can turn into casualties. Decommissioning
would simply consist of pulling out all the replaceable parts.
561
ThorCon reactor

19.5
MSR vs. coal
Since MSR plants operate at low pressure, they can be much smaller than both coal
plants and light-water reactors. For a 1-GWe plant the ThorCon MSR would need
85,000 m3 concrete and 36,000 metric tons steel; while a coal power plant would
require 178,000 m3 concrete and 109,000 metric tons steel. The MSR would require an
extra 100 M$ of nuclear specialty items (graphite, SS316, Haynes 230 alloy, lead, and
excavation). The estimated overnight cost of a coal plant is 14002000 $/kWe, while
that of the MSR is about 1200 $/kW (Devanney et al., 2017, 2016, 2015).
Fission reactors require kilograms of fuel per day, while coal plants require thou-
sands of tons fuel per day. According to one analysis the fuel cost of a 1-GWe coal
plant would be about 2.3 cents/kWh, while the fuel cost of an MSR would be about
0.53 cents/kWh. So the MSR would have cost advantages relative to coal in both
capital cost and fuel cost (Devanney et al., 2017, 2016, 2015).
Nuclear waste from MSR power plants is discussed in Chapter 9: Environment,
Waste, and Resources. About 1 m3 of dry cask storage would be needed for each
GWe-year of power produced.
19.6
Construction speed
Rapid construction is facilitated by the following features.
19.6.1
No new technology is required
The reactor is a straightforward scale-up of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment
(MSRE), which ran successfully for 4 years at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
A full-scale 250-MWe prototype can be operating within 4 years, then subjected to
all the failures and problems that the designers claim the plant can handle. As soon
as the prototype passes these tests, commercial production could begin in year 7.
19.6.2
Historical examples
There are several historical examples of rapid nuclear reactor deployment.
Between April 1942 and October 1944 the first 250-MW Hanford plutonium
production reactor was designed and built, under the leadership of Eugene Wigner.
After March 1950, Captain Hyman Rickover decided to build the Nautilus, a
full-scale prototype, which was operational in less than 6 years, instead of using
cautious intermediate steps.
In 195960 the American Locomotive Company (ALC) designed and built the
10-MWt PM-2A nuclear power plant at Camp Century, just 800 miles from the
North Pole, in 16 months. The plant comprised 27 blocks, which were shipped to
Thule, sledded 150 miles north, and erected in 78 days. When Camp Century was
shut down in 1964 the PM-2A was simply disassembled and returned to the USA.

19.6.3
Shipyard quality and productivity
The 500,000-ton Hellespont Metropolis supertanker (Fig. 19.5) was built in less
than 1 year and cost 89 M$.
A good shipyard needs about 5 man-hours to cut, weld, coat, and erect a ton of
hull steel by using block construction. Subassemblies are produced on a panel line,
and combined into fully coated blocks with piping, wiring, and HVAC preinstalled.
Then the blocks, weighing up to 600 tons, are dropped into place in an immense
building dock.
Block construction facilitates excellent quality control via extensive inspection
and testing at the block level. Defects can be caught early and corrected more easily
than after erection. The MSR silo hall can employ concrete-filled, steel-plate sand-
wich-like walls, which results in a strong, air-tight, ductile building. A 1-GWe
MSR requires about 18,000 tons of flat plate steel for the nuclear island, and a fac-
tory panel line could produce these blocks using less than 2 man-hours per ton of
Figure 19.5 The 500,000-ton Hellespont Metropolis (Devanney et al., 2017, 2016, 2015).
563
ThorCon reactor

steel. The other components could also be manufactured on an assembly line and
delivered to the site as fully outfitted and pretested blocks. Each power module
would require 31 blocks. Upon arrival at the site, the blocks would be dropped into
place. The wall and roof blocks would be welded together using the automatic hull
welding machines from a shipyard. The wall cells would then be filled with con-
crete. Almost no form work would be required. The MSR blocks, up to 23 m wide
and 40 m long, could be barged up most major rivers, such as the St. Lawrence
River.
Regulation should be based on rigorous physical testing of a full-scale prototype,
including all design basis casualties. One schedule proposed for rapid deployment is:
Year 1. Complete design, prepare specifications for yard and other vendors. Get quotes,
negotiate prefission, full-scale prototype contracts. Conduct subsystem tests.
Year 2. Build prefission prototype; do subsystem tests; prepare detailed design/specifica-
tions of fission prototype.
Year 3. Prefission tests. Confirm thermohydraulics, stresses at operating temperature,
exercise safety, instrumentation, and replacement systems. Raise Phase 2 capital. Make
long lead time contracts for fission prototype. Obtain approval for zero power fission
testing.
Year 4. Convert prefission module to fission. Install turbine-generator. Start build of sec-
ond Module.
Year 5. Ramp up Module 1 to full power in a step-wise fashion over the year. Complete
build of second module.
Year 6. Long-run tests on one module; prototype self-supporting from power sales.
Casualty testing on other module. Start accepting orders.
Once a design has passed all these tests, it can be replicated efficiently, up to
50 GWe per year (Devanney et al., 2017, 2016, 2015).
The ThorCon type MSR competes economically with coal  the dominate
source for electricity in the world. A ThorCon type of MSR could be built and
deployed rapidly because no new research or technology is required, all the materi-
als are available, factory quality control can be used, shipyard production speed can
be achieved, the steam cycle is already deployed, cans and components can be
replaced, and there is no delay for scale-up. The main barrier to rapid civilian
deployment in the USA is regulatory delays, so initial deployment may be done
elsewhere.

The SAMOFAR project (Safety Assessment of the Molten Salt Fast Reactor) is one
of the major Research and Innovation projects in the Horizon 2020 Euratom
research program. The grand objective of the project is to deliver a paradigm shift
in nuclear safety and nuclear waste management to make nuclear energy truly safe
and sustainable. To this end, we have developed a new type of nuclear reactor, the
molten salt fast reactor (MSFR), whose key safety features will be demonstrated in
the SAMOFAR project.
The MSFR is the only nuclear reactor that can efficiently consume thorium and
process existing plutonium stock piles as well. The fuel is dissolved in a molten fluo-
ride salt that simultaneously serves as a coolant, avoiding many of the safety issues
of existing nuclear power plants. By using thorium, the production of plutonium and
other long-lived nuclear waste is reduced by a factor of 1000 or more. This would
reduce the required storage time of nuclear waste to just a few centuries.
Furthermore, thorium is abundantly present and can serve global electricity produc-
tion for tens of thousands of years.
20.1
Objectives of the project
The grand objective of SAMOFAR is to prove the innovative safety concepts of the
MSFR by advanced experimental and numerical techniques, to deliver a break-
through in nuclear safety and optimal waste management, and to create a consortium
of stakeholders containing Technical Support Organisations (TSO) and industry to
advance with the MSFR up to the demonstration phase of this technology. Besides
the research efforts in SAMOFAR, the consortium tightly connects with other large
projects in China, Russia, and the United States to exchange information, and to
coordinate and share resources.

The grand objectives will be achieved via the following specific subobjectives:
1. To deliver the experimental proof of concept of the unique safety features of the MSFR;
2. To provide a safety assessment of the MSFR for both the reactor and the chemical plant;
3. To update the conceptual design of the MSFR with all the improvements and recommendations
from afore-mentioned studies incorporated;
4. To deliver a roadmap for further exploitation of the project results by creating momentum
among key stakeholders that can validate and demonstrate the MSFR beyond SAMOFAR.
20.2
The concept of the molten salt fast reactor
The MSFR is a further development of the graphite-moderated molten salt breeder
reactor originally designed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in the
1960s, and is the current reference design studied within the Generation-IV
International Forum. It consists of a cylindrical vessel with diameter and height of
2.25 m made of a nickel-based alloy filled with a liquid fuel salt under ambient
pressure at operating temperature of 750C. The fuel salt, 18 m3 total in the pri-
mary circuit, is pumped upward through the central core zone and downward
through the heat exchangers located circumferentially around the core. In
between, a container filled with a blanket salt containing thorium surrounds the
core to increase the breeding gain. A schematic view of the primary circuit is
shown in Fig. 20.1.
The reactor is designed with a fast neutron spectrum, and it can be operated in
the full range from breeder to burner reactor. This flexibility is facilitated by the
fact that the fuel salt composition can easily be adapted during reactor operation
Figure 20.1 Schematic layout of the MSFR core. The central region (green) is the core
surrounded by the annular breeding blanket (red). The heat exchangers are located
circumferentially around the vessel.

without manufacturing of solid fuel elements. During reactor operation a fraction of
the salt is continuously diverted to an ex-core salt clean-up unit to extract lantha-
nides and actinides. A more detailed view of the whole MSFR plant layout is shown
in Fig. 20.2.
The fast neutron spectrum relaxes the requirements for this process enormously.
While in a thermal molten salt breeder reactor, the salt should be cleaned at a pro-
cessing rate of about 4 m3/day, this is only 40 L/day in a fast reactor. The salt
clean-up process is a unique feature of the MSFR and contains two major steps.
First, the gaseous and nonsoluble fission products like the noble metals are removed
from the primary circuit by gas bubbling near the pumps. In a second step the
uranium, actinides, and some fission product can be separated by pyro-chemical
techniques (fluorination and reductive extraction) in the ex-core chemical plant.
The use of a liquid fuel salt under ambient pressure offers unique assets not
present in other reactor types, based on the following mechanisms:
G
Thermal expansion of the fuel salt. The first mechanism to limit any reactivity excursion is
to let the fuel salt expand upon heating, which gives a strong negative void and temperature
reactivity feedback everywhere in the core. This is in addition to the nuclear Doppler effect.
The resulting temperature feedback coefficient is around 25 pcm/K.
Figure 20.2 Schematic layout of the MSFR, showing the location of the systems for
cleaning and draining of the fuel salt, and the three containment barriers (pink, yellow, gray).
567
Safety assessment of the molten salt fast reactor (SAMOFAR)

G
Natural circulation of the fuel salt. The first mechanism to remove the decay heat from
the fuel salt is to let it circulate in the primary vessel through the heat exchangers, even if
the pumps are not operating. This is facilitated by the facts that the fuel salt has a high
heat capacity and a large temperature margin to boiling (  2000 K).
G
Draining of the fuel salt. The second mechanism to remove the decay heat from the fuel
salt is to let the salt drain in passively cooled tanks underneath the reactor core. The
connection between the primary vessel and the drain tanks is sealed with a freeze plug
that will melt upon overheating, e.g., when the external power fails. This mechanism also
brings the fuel salt in a safe deep subcritical state.
G
Cleaning the fuel salt. The third principle to facilitate the decay heat removal from the
fuel salt is to reduce the decay heat production by continuously cleaning the fuel salt by
helium bubbling and by the chemical separation processes mentioned before. This reduces
the decay heat in the salt by approximately 35%.
G
High solubility of fission products in the salt. Most fission products dissolve in the fuel
and are strongly bonded, which may virtually eliminate the source term in the reactor core
of volatile fission products like cesium and iodine.
All these mechanisms lead to a robust safety approach of the MSFR, which will
be validated and quantified in SAMOFAR by advanced experimental and numerical
simulation tools.
20.3
Main research themes
In SAMOFAR, the following experimental research is carried out.
First, the reliability of the freeze plug concept and the mechanism to drain the fuel
salt in fail-safe storage tanks underneath the reactor core will be validated experi-
mentally. This requires experimental setups with molten salts at high temperatures.
Second, the natural circulation dynamics of the fuel salt will be investigated.
Because the decay heat is produced homogeneously in the salt, the natural circulation
dynamics may be different from those in solid-fuel reactors.
Third, the safety-related salt properties like viscosity, heat capacity, melting and
solidification behavior, need accurate experimental determination. This will be done in
advanced experiments with actinide-containing salts at high temperature (  600C).
Fourth, the synthesis of the fuel salt will be developed, as well as the extraction
of the lanthanides and actinides from the fuel salt by reductive methods.
Finally, the interaction between the salt and materials and coatings will be
experimentally investigated and demonstrated.
Besides this extensive experimental work, the integral safety assessment of the
reactor including the drain tanks and the processing unit will be carried out with a
newly developed method, and control strategies will be identified and simulated for
all kind of operation modes, such as start-up, shut-down, and load-follow operation.
An extensive risk assessment will lead to a complete set of transient scenarios that
will be evaluated by leading-edge multiphysics software specially developed for
this purpose. All these analyses will be done for the complete system including all
components in contact with the fuel salt.

The SAMOFAR consortium
The SAMOFAR consortium comprises the 11 partners shown in Table 20.1.
Because the MSFR is a reactor design with safety features that need to be moved
from low to high technology readiness, a major part of the work program is funda-
mental of nature. This part is mainly executed by universities and research laborato-
ries, like Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Joint Research
Centre (JRC), Consorzio Interuniversitario per la Ricerca Technologica Nucleare
(CIRTEN), Technical University-Delft (TU-Delft), and Paul Scherrer Institute
(PSI), thereby exploiting each other’s unique expertise and infrastructure. CNRS is
a French research institute with many branches and with strong expertise on the
MSFR reactor design and integral safety assessment and on experimental research
with molten salts, both in the field of physics (loop experiments) and chemistry
(chemical separation processes). Joint Research Center-Institute for Transuranic
Elements (JRC-ITU) is leading in Europe with fundamental experimental research
on molten salt thermo-dynamics and chemistry. It has an excellent infrastructure to
investigate actinide-containing molten salts. CIRTEN has a strong reputation in
experimental thermal-hydraulics and loop-dynamics as well as in numerical reactor
design. TU-Delft is an expert in fundamental experimental thermal-hydraulics and
computational reactor physics. PSI is the leading Swiss institute on nuclear research
with broad expertise, and with unique contributions to various work packages, like
the structural mechanics effects of some transients. Centro de Investigacion y de

Design principles
The fundamental principles of using static (unpumped) molten salt fuel in fuel tubes
and fuel assemblies very similar to those used with uranium oxide pellet fuel are
set out in Chapter 14, Static liquid fuel reactors. In this chapter, one particular
design of such a reactor is described. It is a fast spectrum reactor designed for con-
sumption of stocks of plutonium and higher actinides from spent nuclear fuel.
The design principles that have been followed are to:
1. Achieve intrinsic safety wherever that is possible;
2. Achieve passive safety when intrinsic safety is not achievable;
3. Minimize complexity, both to minimize cost but also to reduce the number of interacting
systems that inevitably create unexpected fault scenarios.
The resulting design bears a degree of similarity to modern pool-type designs for
sodium-cooled fast reactors, but differs in a number of key aspects. It is far smaller;
it contains no highly chemically reactive materials; its coolant has a much higher
volumetric heat capacity allowing much lower pumping speeds; and it is modular
in construction, allowing a wide range of reactor sizes to be constructed from stan-
dard modules.
And, of course, it has the defining and overwhelming advantage of molten salt
fuel of a very small volatile radioactive source term. Accepting design principle 1
(intrinsic safety whenever possible) would make choice of any other fuel system
incompatible with the ALARP principle.

The small size and intrinsic safety make this reactor much less costly to build,
and probably to operate, than modern sodium fast reactors and pressurized water
reactors. Chapter 14, Static liquid fuel reactors described the capital cost estimation
carried out for an earlier design of stable salt fast reactor based on typical UK
onsite construction. The design described in this chapter is a derivative of that
design, but modified to allow substantial factory-based modular construction, use of
standard parts for reactors of different sizes, and use of standard nuclear certified
steels, rather than more exotic superalloy materials. It is therefore anticipated that
this design will have a yet lower overnight capital cost and, due to its short onsite
construction schedule, a substantially lower total capital cost.
21.2
Design outline
The basic unit of the reactor core is the fuel assembly. One is illustrated in
Fig. 21.1.
Each assembly contains a square 18 3 21 hexagonal close-packed array of
10 mm diameter fuel tubes with 1 mm helical wire wrap filled to a height of
1600 mm with fuel salt. The tubes have diving bell gas vents at the top to allow
fission gasses to escape as described in Chapter 14, Static liquid fuel reactors.
The assembly is clad with stainless steel and has a spike at the base which contains
a filter apparatus and through which the bottom of the assembly is positively
located into the diagrid bottom support.
The region of the assembly above the fuel tubes is a lattice structure that is
narrower than the main part of the assembly, allowing space for instrument thimbles
Figure 21.1 Single fuel tube and fuel tube assembly.
572
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

to be inserted between the fuel assemblies. At the top the assembly has a spring-
loaded apparatus that positively locates the assembly into the upper support grid,
while permitting the springs to be compressed to disengage the assembly from the
upper support grid. When this is done, the assembly can be raised to disengage the
bottom spike from the diagrid, moved laterally along the channel in the upper support
grid and then securely reengaged in the bottom diagrid and upper support grid.
An unusual design feature of the reactor is that its core is rectangular in shape.
This is relatively neutronically inefficient compared to a cylindrical core but enables
substantial simplification of the movement of fuel assemblies and permits the core to
be extended essentially indefinitely in its long dimension simply by adding additional
modules. This compromise is driven by design principle number 3 above.
Fig. 21.2 shows an illustration of a reactor module. Each module contains 10
rows of 10 fuel assemblies, upper support grid, lower diagrid, heat exchangers,
pumps, control assemblies, and instrumentation. Each module has a thermal output
of 375 MW. Two or more of these modules are assembled side by side into a rect-
angular reactor tank (single modules are theoretically possible but suffer from more
significant “end effects” where power output is lower).
The modules (without fuel assemblies) are preassembled into the stainless steel
tank and delivered to the construction site as single road-transportable components.
They are placed in concrete- and steel-lined pits below grade level.
The upper part of the reactor consists of an argon containment dome, incorporat-
ing two crane type systems, a low load device designed to move fuel assemblies
within the reactor core, and a high load device designed to raise and lower fuel
assemblies into the coolant and to replace entire modules should that be necessary.
21.3
Fuel salt
The fuel salt is a close to eutectic mixture of 60 mol% NaCl with 40% mixed
uranium, plutonium, and lanthanide trichlorides. Initial fuel for the reactor is

expected to come from stocks of pure PuO2 from Plutonium uranium redox extrac-
tion (PUREX) reprocessed conventional spent nuclear fuel, mixed with pure
depleted uranium trichloride. The acceptability of substantial lanthanide contamina-
tion of the Stable salt reactor (SSR) fuel will make significantly lower cost repro-
cessing of spent uranium oxide fuel possible when the existing stocks of pure
plutonium have been consumed.
The properties of this salt are given in Table 21.1. Being a trichloride, it is much
more thermodynamically stable than the corresponding fluoride salts. It can there-
fore be maintained in a strongly reducing state by contact with sacrificial nuclear-
grade zirconium metal added as a coating on, or an insert within, the fuel tube. As
a result the fuel tube can be made from standard nuclear certified steel. Since the
reactor is fast spectrum, the tubes will be exposed to very high neutron flux and suf-
fer high damage (dpa) levels, estimated at 100200 dpa over the tube life. Highly
neutron damage tolerant steels such as HT9 would therefore be used for the tubes.
See Chapter 14, Static liquid fuel reactors for further details.
Gas produced during fission bubbles out from the fuel salt at a rate of approxi-
mately 0.5 mL per day per tube. This gas is primarily noble gases of longer half-
lives and cadmium (see Chapter 14: Static liquid fuel reactors). The gas enters the
argon containment dome and the cadmium metal and other traces of condensable
volatile species are collected in a cold (B10C) trap incorporated in the argon cir-
culation and cooling system. Accumulated noble gases undergo significant further
decay inside the containment and are released to atmosphere at intervals through
operation of the airlock which discharges argon from the containment to atmo-
sphere through the hot air decay heat removal stacks (see below).
The average power density in the fuel salt is 150 kW/L which allows a very gen-
erous margin for salt temperature below the salt boiling point. Power peaking to
double this level for substantial periods would not exceed the safe operating condi-
tions for the fuel tube.
21.4
Primary coolant salt
The coolant salt in the reactor tank is composed of 42 mol% ZrF4/48 mol% KF/10%
NaF. Its properties are given in Table 21.2. The zirconium is not nuclear-grade and

still contains B2% hafnium. This has a minimal effect on core reactivity but makes
the coolant salt a highly effective neutron shield. The 1 m of coolant reduces neutron
flux by four orders of magnitude.
The coolant also contains 1 mol% zirconium metal (which dissolves forming
2 mol% ZrF2). This reduces its redox potential to a level making it virtually noncor-
rosive to standard steels. The reactor tank, support structures, and heat exchangers
can therefore be constructed from standard 316L stainless steel.
The coolant salt is circulated through the reactor core by pumps attached to the
heat exchangers in each module. Flow rates are modest, approximately 1 m/s with a
resulting low requirement for pump power. The primary coolant salt becomes
radiaoactive due to absorption of neutrons, short-term activation (,1 day) is domi-
nated by activation products of Na while longer-term Zr dominates. In the very long
term (10 years), 36Cl formed by activation of K dominates and is the critical factor in
disposal of the coolant salt during decommissioning (Williams et al., 2006).
21.5
Secondary heat transfer loop and steam island
The radioactivity of the primary coolant salt makes use of a secondary heat transfer
loop necessary to avoid potential for high-pressure steam interaction with radioac-
tive salt in heat exchangers. The secondary circuit uses the same salt as the primary
coolant, maintained at a small positive pressure relative to the primary coolant to
prevent radioactive material entering the secondary loop in the extremely unlikely
event of a leak in a heat exchanger tube. The heat exchanger is of the twisted tube/
shell type with the secondary coolant salt in the tubes. The tube sheets are located
above the lid section of the heat exchanger so that any leaks at that point are visible
and do not allow mixing of the primary and secondary coolants.
The secondary coolant passes to a steam-generating heat exchanger of the tube/
shell type where the high-pressure steam is contained within the tubes. Backup heat-
ing is not required for the salt in the tank, however the salt-containing structures out-
side the primary salt pool are insulated and have electrical heating elements to
maintain temperatures above the coolant salt freezing points during shutdown periods.
The steam system is of standard construction. The outlet temperature of the sec-
ondary coolant salt is high enough to operate a supercritical steam cycle, however
the choice of that vs. a superheated steam cycle will be essentially economic.

21.6
Fuel management and refueling
In conventional light-water reactors, refueling is a major undertaking involving shut-
ting the reactor down for several weeks, flooding the reactor containment with water
and removing and replacing about one-third of the fuel assemblies. The remaining
assemblies are shuffled to make the “new” core as efficient as possible. Each shuf-
fling involves lifting an assembly entirely out of the core, moving it to its new posi-
tion and reinserting it into the core. This process requires large, complex mechanisms.
The stable salt fast reactor uses a radically simpler and faster procedure, enabled
by operation at atmospheric pressure, absence of chemically highly reactive fluids,
and with fuel assemblies compatible with a wide range of power levels and tempera-
tures. The simplicity evolves from the fundamentally superior physics of the reactor.
The fuel assemblies in the core are arranged in rows of 10 aligned along linear
support structures. Refueling involves three simple stages.
G
A spent fuel assembly is lifted from its anchoring point at one end of the row and moved
laterally, still immersed in the coolant salt, to a storage location at the extreme end of the
row. It remains there for 36 months until its decay heat has fallen to the level where it
can be lifted from the coolant, allowed to freeze, and then moved into dry cask storage.
G
The remaining fuel assemblies on that row are migrated one step across the core, in each
case involving only a few cm lifting and a short lateral movement. Alternate rows migrate
in opposite directions across the core.
G
A fresh fuel assembly is moved from its temporary storage location at the opposite
extreme edge of the row to the vacant position in the core.
This process can take place with the reactor at full power or with power reduced
to B10% of full power or with the reactor shut down. The advantage of doing it at
low power is a simplification of the process to restore it to full power.
The refueling process is carried out every 3 months on each fourth row of assem-
blies so assemblies spend 5 years in the core. The time required is consistent with
an overnight shutdown period. Removal of cooled spent fuel assemblies and inser-
tion of fresh assemblies into the temporary storage locations takes place with the
reactor at full power during the period between refuelings. The period between
refuelings is relatively short, and the reactor is able to maintain full power, despite
reduced core reactivity due to fissile burnup, through small variations in primary
coolant flow rate. No reactivity shim or control rod systems are required to control
reactivity under normal conditions.
Fresh fuel assemblies for an upcoming refueling are delivered as single consign-
ments and immediately loaded into the temporary storage locations in the reactor tank.
Fresh fuel stores are therefore not required. Spent fuel is transferred to dry casks or to
transport containers and either placed in air-cooled storage or sent for reprocessing.
21.7
Neutronics and reactivity control
The unusual geometry of the reactor core leads to a power distribution across the
core which is also atypical. Fig. 21.3 shows the results of MonteCarl N Particle
576
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

neutronics code (MCNP) neutronic analysis on a core where fresh fuel was intro-
duced at one end of each row with a range of reactor-grade plutonium concentra-
tions from 16% in the central rows to 22% in the peripheral rows and then
underwent a 66% burnup as the fuel assembly traversed the core.
The figure shows that power output from an assembly falls by about 64% as the
fissile isotopes are consumed but that averaged over adjacent rows of fuel assem-
blies an approximately uniform power distribution is achieved. The burnup of fissile
isotopes is approximately 60%.
This burnup is readily achieved both neutronically and chemically and represents
a burnup of B500 GWd/tonne, a level which has only been dreamed of for solid
fueled reactors and which is only possible due to the chemical and (most impor-
tantly) physical stability of the liquid fuel.
The temperature coefficient of reactivity of the fuel is a critical factor in reactor
safety. It is a measure of how much the nuclear reactivity of the reactor falls as it
heats up. A negative coefficient means that if reactor power increases, it heats up
and the power then falls. It is self-regulating. No reactor would be approved today
without a negative temperature coefficient. The temperature coefficient for the
stable salt fast reactor fuel is 210 pcm/K, a negative value around 510 times
greater than solid fueled reactors. The high negative coefficient is driven by the rel-
atively large thermal expansion of the liquid fuel as it heats. This has an obvious
safety advantage but also is vital in allowing the reactor to run between refueling
episodes without having initial excess reactivity that has to be “held down” by con-
trol rods or neutron poisons. The small reductions in reactivity that occur as fuel is
burned merely lead to a very small reduction in average fuel temperature which
compensates for the fuel burnup. In a solid fueled reactor, the fall in temperature
necessary would be 510 times higher and would severely impact on power output.
Control rods and other reactivity control systems are not therefore required dur-
ing operation of the reactor. However, they are provided in the form of narrow con-
trol blades which can be inserted between the rows of fuel assemblies. These allow
shutdown of the reactor when that is desired and have the usual fail-safe properties
of shutdown systems in all reactors.

Stable salt fast reactor

21.8
Decay heat removal
Even when shut down, all reactors continue producing heat from decay of radioac-
tive fission products. Failure to remove that heat will lead to any reactor core heat-
ing up continually until the dreaded “melt down” happens. Molten salt fueled
reactors may be immune from melt down (they are already molten) but uncontrolled
heating of the fuel salt would still be a serious accident—though without the long-
distance catastrophic release of gaseous radioactivity that happens with solid fuels.
Emergency heat removal systems that will prevent this happening under all cir-
cumstances are now sought for all new reactor designs. Systems requiring active
pumping of water can fail, as happened at Fukushima. The very best designs of heat
removal system do not require power, do not require operator intervention, and will
continue to operate forever with no reservoirs of coolant that could be depleted.
The stable salt fast reactor has such a cooling system. As shown in Fig. 21.4 the
reactor tank fits into a double-walled outer vessel.
Cold air is drawn into the outer space of this double wall, passes down, and then
enters the inner space at the bottom of the reactor. It then heats up, rises, and is
released to the atmosphere through tall chimneys which provide the draught that
drives the air flow with no need for pumps.
Such entirely passive heat loss systems have been conceived before, but they
have been found to only work with reactors that are either very low power, or
which have huge vessels providing a large surface area for heat loss. The stable salt
fast reactor is neither of these. It is a high power and very compact reactor.
What makes passive decay heat loss possible in the stable salt reactor is its high
operating temperature. Convective heat loss to flowing air is roughly proportional
to the temperature T of the vessel. Heat emission by infrared rays, however, is pro-
portional to T4! A mechanism which is barely relevant at Pressurized water reactor
(PWR) temperatures becomes dominant at molten salt reactor temperatures.
Figure 21.4 Passive decay heat removal system.
578
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

Radiative heat loss from the reactor tank would be pointless, however, unless
there was a mechanism to then remove that heat, otherwise the concrete pit in
which the reactor sits would just get hotter and hotter. The mechanism used is to fit
a large number of thin “fins” to the divider separating the incoming cold and outgo-
ing hot air. The radiated heat is absorbed by the fins which provide a huge surface
area for convective heat transfer to the flowing air. This is illustrated in Fig. 21.4.
This mechanism differs fundamentally from the conventional approach of adding
fins to the tank itself. Doing this does increase the area for convective heat loss, but
because the heat must be transmitted along the fins by conduction, the fins usually
have to be relatively short and thick. Thin fins that receive their heat by radiation
allow far greater efficiency of heat loss because far greater areas are practical.
21.9
Waste and spent fuel management
The fast-spectrum SSR is designed as a plutonium/higher actinide burner. It can be
operated on a once-through basis with the substantially burned fuel stored until
decay heat production is reduced to the level allowing for disposal in a geologically
stable repository.
However, while that process would reduce the amount of long-lived actinide
waste from thermal reactors by a factor of about three, the true value of the fast-
spectrum SSR is in completely closing the fuel cycle so that long-lived actinide-
containing waste is no longer produced.
Spent fuel from the reactor would therefore be reprocessed. Being already in a
salt form this is far simpler than is the case for oxide fuel. The spent salt fuel is
melted and reprocessed directly by electrolysis. This produces four streams of
product:
G
A metallic waste form containing the fuel tube metal plus deposited noble metal fission
products, including technetium;
G
A pure uranium metal fraction which can be stored for future use in breeder reactors;
G
An impure uranium/plutonium/higher actinide/lanthanide fraction which is usable as fuel
for the SSR with no further purification;
G
A mix of actinide free fission products for storage and useful applications or disposal.
Both the metallic waste and fission product waste decay to a level no more
radioactive than the original uranium ore after approximately 300 years. They can
therefore be stored without the need for a repository that is stable over geological
time periods. They could in fact be a source of valuable elements after the 300-year
period.
The key feature of the SSR that makes this very desirable process possible is its
ability to use fuel that is of very low purity, with the primary fissile fuel (pluto-
nium) contaminated with as much as 50% of uranium and lanthanides. No solid
fuel could tolerate such a low purity because the physical properties of the fuel
would suffer. Molten salts of course suffer from no such limitation.

21.10
Breeding potential
Fast reactors are traditionally seen as routes to breeding new nuclear fuel from fer-
tile isotopes, especially for the high breeding potential of plutonium in the fast neu-
tron spectrum. The reactor described in this chapter is not a net breeder. Breeding
of new nuclear fuel is not the economic imperative today that it was expected to be
in the 1960s when it was thought that uranium was a very limited resource. Today
it is known that uranium is more plentiful and the low contribution to nuclear costs
represented by uranium ore means that a large increase in uranium cost would not
be an economic problem. At such higher costs, very large reserves of low-grade
uranium ore become economically viable, possibly even including sea water. There
is therefore no imperative for a breeding program.
Nonetheless, the fast-spectrum SSR is readily converted to a breeding configuration
simply by replacing the zirconium fluoride-based coolant with a thorium fluoride-
based coolant. This configuration will breed uranium-233 in the coolant which can be
readily extracted into molten bismuth using methods established half a century ago. It
is actually a mixed breeder, with plutonium-239 being bred from uranium-238 in the
fuel salt and uranium-233 from thorium in the coolant salt. At some point, increased
uranium costs will make this option economically advantageous—that point will come
sooner if the world successfully expands its use of nuclear energy far faster than seems
likely today with our focus on economically marginal light-water reactors.
21.11
Conclusions
The fast-spectrum stable salt reactor has an enormous economic advantage over
other fast reactor designs, due to its far superior intrinsic safety. It can be both
highly profitable at electricity prices lower than those achievable by fossil fuels and
simultaneously can clean up the long-lived radioactive waste from current and
future generation of light-water reactors. It will form a critical part of the massively
expanded global nuclear power generation system that is needed if the world is to
truly decarbonize its power production.

Introduction
In many respects, nuclear energy is an ideal alternative to fossil fuels—it is a well-
characterized technology that can generate a large baseload supply of carbon-free
electricity at minimal operating cost. However, the nuclear power industry has his-
torically been hampered in part by concerns about nuclear waste production. To
address this concern, multiple advanced reactor technologies feature innovative
designs that are capable of achieving higher fuel utilization and thus producing sig-
nificantly less long-lived actinide waste than conventional reactor designs. One of
these technologies, the molten salt reactor (MSR), was first developed at the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory in the 1950s and 1960s, and is a reactor design that uti-
lizes liquid fuel.
Transatomic Power’s (TAP’s) previous publicly released technical white paper
described how to adapt this design with a new moderator and fuel salt to attain criti-
cality using low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel (Transatomic Power Corporation,
2014). This report provides additional detail about the reactor physics and

operational characteristics of such a design. TAP’s goal in developing this reactor
is to reduce reactor waste production by increasing fuel burnup (Burnup, also
known as fuel utilization, is defined as the thermal energy extracted per unit mass
of heavy metal, typically given in units of GWd/MTHM, where MTHM stands for
metric tons of heavy metal [Alain, 2009].). To achieve this goal, the design incorpo-
rates a new method of moderator rod operation that minimizes excess reactivity in
the core, allowing for considerably higher-burnup than LWRs and decreased waste
production (Reactivity, ρ, is defined by the equation, ρ 5 keff 2 1
keff
, in which keff is
the reactor’s effective multiplication factor, the ratio of neutron populations from
one neutron life cycle to the next.).
22.2
Fuel utilization in liquid-fueled reactors
The typical definition of fuel burnup is given by the following equation:
Bu 5 Pt
mI
in which Bu is the burnup, P is the reactor’s thermal power, t is the fuel resi-
dence time, and mI is the initial actinide loading in the reactor.
In liquid-fueled reactors, it is necessary to modify this equation to take into
account the additional mass of actinides, ma, added to the reactor over the
course of operation:
Bu 5
Pt
mI 1 ma
Nuclear fuel burnup is a key parameter for measuring the efficiency of the
nuclear fuel cycle. A higher-burnup fuel cycle decreases waste production, and thus
potentially reduces long-term waste storage costs and environmental impact.
Increasing burnup is equivalent to increasing the amount of time that a reactor
maintains criticality with a given amount of fuel, which is typically accomplished
by having either a large initial loading of fissile material, or a high conversion of
fertile to fissile nuclei in the reactor (Cochran and Tsoulfanidis, 1999) (This conver-
sion is quantified by a parameter known as the conversion ratio, which is defined
as the ratio of the fissile material production rate to the fissile material consumption
rate.). The main factors limiting fuel burnup in LWRs are structural damage and
trapping of fission products in the solid fuel pellets. Over the course of operation,
fission product buildup within the rods can reduce the fuel pellets’ thermal conduc-
tivity, thereby increasing the rod’s centerline temperature and decreasing the margin
582
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

to the fuel’s melting point. Increased fuel temperature and radiation-induced
damage can lead to swelling in the fuel pellets, which in turn can cause the fuel
pellets to impinge on the cladding and, in extreme cases, lead to cladding failure.
Buildup of fission products within the fuel rods also reduces the system’s reactivity
over time, because of several isotopes’ high neutron absorption cross-sections.
22.3
Fission product removal and reactor fuel utilization
In contrast to solid fuel, liquid fuel has numerous advantages that allow for
increased fuel burnup. Liquid fuel has no long-range structure to be damaged, does
not experience significant volumetric swelling, and avoids fission product poisoning
through continuous fission product removal. To measure quantitatively the effect
of fission product removal in molten salt systems, two depletion calculations on
otherwise identical models were run using the neutronics software Serpent 2.26
(Leppa¨nen, 2007) (Depletion calculations are computer simulations that model
burnup over the course of the reactor’s life.). The results of the simulation can be
seen in Fig. 22.1, with additional parameters given in Appendix A.
Although fission product removal increases the maximum burnup by more than
27% (44.5 GWd/MTHM compared to 34.8 GWd/MTHM), the final value still falls
short of yielding significant improvements when compared to current LWR limits
(45 GWd/MTHM). To increase this value further, it is possible to take advantage of

another aspect of liquid-fueled reactors: the ability to easily vary their geometry, by
inserting or removing moderator rods in the reactor core.
22.4
A new take on reactivity control
In order to account for the loss of fissile material over the course of operation,
solid-fueled nuclear reactors use core configurations and fuel compositions that
result in excess positive reactivity at the beginning of life (BOL). During normal
operation, excess reactivity is accounted for using control rods and soluble absor-
bers—the additional neutrons are captured, and the reactor can be operated safely.
The concept of “reactivity swing” (the variation in reactivity in a reactor over
the course of a given fuel loading) is shown graphically in Fig. 22.2. A reactor with
a large reactivity swing is inherently inefficient, as neutrons that could have other-
wise been used for fission and conversion in the fuel are effectively wasted in the
absorbers and control rods. An ideal reactor therefore has minimal reactivity swing,
and can use its neutron population with the greatest efficiency during operation.
The neutron balance in a reactor is a function of both geometry and core material
composition. In solid-fueled reactors, geometry is largely fixed, and control is
achieved through modifications in the composition—insertion and removal of
neutron-absorbing material. Liquid-fueled reactors, however, make it possible to
control reactivity by altering the core’s geometry, thereby largely eliminating

reactivity swing in the system. Specifically, it is possible to readily vary the salt
volume fraction (SVF; the percentage of the core volume occupied by fuel salt) in
an MSR core by inserting or removing moderator rods. In order to illustrate the
effect of changing SVF in the core, a scoping study consisting of multiple steady-
state pin cell calculations was performed in Serpent 2.26.
Varying the levels of 235U enrichment (1%5%) and modifying SVF through
the simulation of different-sized moderator rods makes it possible to estimate the
evolution of the fuel with time. Fig. 22.3 shows a plot of infinite multiplication fac-
tor as a function of SVF for these multiple enrichment levels. The graph shows that
as fissile material concentration in the reactor decreases, the reactor can either
maintain criticality:
1. By beginning with a large amount of excess reactivity and a constant SVF, as in a
stationary moderator rod configuration, or,
2. By decreasing SVF, as in a moveable moderator rod configuration.
Although exact operational progression cannot be derived from this graph, since
the simulations do not take into account the generation of transuranic isotopes
over the course of life, the general relationships among fissile concentration,
multiplication factor, and SVF can be inferred.
From this trend, it can be seen that it is possible to control the system’s reactivity
by adjusting the reactor’s SVF. Such an adjustment can thus be used to eliminate
reactivity swing, thereby increasing the reactor’s neutron utilization efficiency and

conversion ratio. Fig. 22.4 illustrates this effect through a plot of conversion ratio
as function of enrichment and SVF. The graph demonstrates that as fissile material
concentration decreases, moving from higher to lower SVF does, in fact, produce a
higher conversion ratio over the course of life (2) than does a stationary rod config-
uration (1).
In practice, SVF will be varied by inserting fixed-sized moderator rods via the
bottom of the reactor vessel (for safety considerations), in a manner analogous to
moving the control rods in a boiling water reactor, as shown in Fig. 22.5. The reac-
tor therefore does not require control rods beyond a single shutdown rod for safety.
As an additional shutdown mechanism, moderator rod removal may also act as a
means of bringing the reactor into a subcritical state.
22.5
Depletion calculations with movable
moderator rods
The scoping calculations make it possible to infer the influence of SVF on burnup
and reactivity control in an MSR. Following this initial scoping, assembly-level
depletion calculations were used to simulate the system evolution over time to a
higher degree of accuracy. In these simulations, SVF was adjusted to minimize
excess reactivity. The model employs continual fission product removal and a fuel
addition method that maintains constant actinide concentration following each time

step (In an operating MSR, it is necessary to add additional actinide fuel to the sys-
tem so that the fuel salt can remain at its eutectic composition. Additionally, further
details on fission product removal are included in Appendix A.). The initial actinide
loading is comprised of 5% LEU, with two different feed compositions being used
for comparison: one consisting of 5% LEU, and the other consisting of 50 GWd/
MTHM SNF.
Fig. 22.6 shows the change in SVF in the TAP reactor as a function of burnup
for both feed compositions. At the BOL, a high SVF is used to harden the spectrum
and convert the maximum amount of fertile material while the fissile content is still
high (Also note that at the beginning of life, leakage in the system is approximately
4.3%, dropping to 1.8% by the end of life. Leakage considerations are described in
more detail in Appendix B.). As shown in Fig. 22.7, as fissile concentration begins
to drop additional moderator rods are inserted in order to maintain criticality, lead-
ing to a decrease in SVF and subsequently conversion ratio (Fig. 22.8).
As the final mass of feed in these simulations is small in comparison to the ini-
tial actinide load, the small difference between the two fuel cycles is caused by the

feed material has a direct influence on conversion ratio, as it can be thought of as
an additional fissile production term. Eq. (22.1) illustrates this effect by presenting
an effective conversion ratio (CReff), defined as the system’s conversion ratio (CR)
plus the fissile concentration of the feed (FFeed).

Waste reduction
Addressing nuclear energy’s major challenge of long-lived waste disposal requires
two substantial steps, as the industry must both reduce the rate at which waste is
produced and find a long-term solution for the world’s nuclear waste stockpiles.
The TAP MSR’s unique reactor design makes significant strides by maximizing
burnup to reduce the waste production rate, and in doing so limiting the require-
ment of future repositories.
As shown in Fig. 22.9, fuel burnup and waste production exhibit an inverse
power relationship, meaning that the effect of increased burnup on waste production
depends highly on the reference position. With 100% fuel utilization being equiva-
lent to 909 GWd/MTHM and current LWR achieving burnups on the order of
45 GWd/MTHM, it is clear that there remains substantial room for improvement.

To fully explore TAP’s goal of maximizing burnup in the TAP MSR, in addition
to the fuel cycle cases discussed above, an identical depletion calculation was run
for a fuel cycle in line with the enrichment levels proposed by other advanced reac-
tor developers: a 10% enriched initial fuel load with a 20% enriched feed.
Fig. 22.10 compares the results of this calculation and those discussed previously in
terms of the TAP MSR’s improvement over current LWR technology.
As shown in Fig. 22.10, higher enrichments lead to higher burnups, and therefore
less waste, due to their ability to maintain criticality for longer periods of time. At
the highest LEU enrichment levels, this ability results in an 83% reduction in
annual waste production below that of LWRs. Even under the current industry fuel
cycle regime of a 5% enriched initial load with a 5% feed, the TAP MSR reduces
annual waste production by approximately 53%.
Further details on the calculations used to determine the TAP MSR’s fuel cycle
profile can be found in Appendix A.
22.7
Conclusion
The TAP MSR design takes advantage of its liquid fuel to allow for more than
twice the fuel utilization of LWRs, leading to an approximately 53% reduction in
waste when using 5% enriched uranium, the maximum enrichment readily available
in the current supply chain. Using higher enrichments, up to the 20% LEU limit,
this reduction reaches 83%. These accomplishments represent major leaps forward,

number located in the center of each rod, with 1 indicating the first rod inserted and
49 the last. It should be noted that 4 and 5 cm-pitch models produce similar results,
and may be chosen moving forward to limit the total number of rods in the reactor.

that the initial time steps are short enough to properly simulate the initial evolution

Over the course of operation, fuel addition and SVF continually disrupt this afore-
mentioned equilibrium, and it is therefore also important to limit the size of the max-
imum allowable time step. For all results discussed previously, 6 months was chosen
as the maximum step limit (Δtmax), with an even more accurate estimation into the
final burnup values coming through the use of a Richardson extrapolation Eq. (A.2).

By running a second depletion calculation with a maximum time step of

Appendix B: leakage considerations
In order to limit excess reactivity and achieve a high conversion ratio at the BOL,
the initial SVF must be very high, on the order of 0.9 for a 5% initial load. As a
result, the neutron spectrum at the BOL is hardened compared to that of the end of
life (EOL), as shown in Fig. B.1.

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

To accurately model such a spectrum, unresolved resonance probability
tables were included in the calculations for several significant isotopes: 235U, 238U,
238Pu, 239Pu 240Pu, 241Pu, and 242Pu. The omission of other actinides in this consid-
eration is not expected to introduce significant error, as their low concentrations
over the course of operation minimize their overall influence.
As the leakage rate of the hardened spectrum is expected to be higher than
that of the more thermal spectrum at the EOL, kN limits over the course of a
depletion calculation must reflect this evolution. Fig. B.2 shows the estimated
kN trend as a function of the number of rods inserted in an assembly, with leak-
age considerations, both radially and axially, being obtained by comparing the
kN of the infinite assembly to that of a representative three-dimensional core, as
shown in Fig. B.3.
Acting as a complement to Figs. B.2, B.4 and B.5 show the radial flux profile
of the reactor at the BOL for a 5% enriched initial actinide load, and the Shannon
entropy as a function of the number of inactive cycles, respectively. Shannon
entropy is used as a metric to verify that the source distribution has converged prior
to the start of active simulation cycles.

isotopes (e.g., 239Pu and 241Pu) produce both more neutrons, and greater energy
per fission than that of 235U, as well as 240Pu possesses a significantly higher
capture cross-section at lower energies (,1025 MeV) than that of 238U. In a
movable rod method, this effect is outweighed by increased moderation,
producing a thermalized spectrum at the EOL (see Fig. B.1), which is
unfavorable for conversion.

The effect of the movable rods is most visible upon examination of the sharp
decrease in 239Pu. After roughly 30 GWd/MTHM, 239Pu surpasses 235U as the pri-
mary contributor to fission in the core, as shown in Table C.1. In addition to this
larger consumption rate, 238U capture can also be seen to drastically decrease over
the course of life, as shown in Table C.2, reducing the production rate of 239Pu.

Copenhagen Atomics (CA) is working on a thorium molten salt reactor (MSR),
configured as a waste burner and placed in an airtight 13-m (40-ft) shipping con-
tainer. The goals are
1. To develop a MSR that is able to start on plutonium from spent nuclear fuel (SNF).
2. To show that it is plausible that these reactors can be manufactured at low cost on an
assembly line and decommissioned and recycled on another assembly line.
3. To help develop systems that can convert SNF from fuel rods into a molten salt fuel for
our reactor design.
We aim to create partnerships with other companies, countries, and researchers
that want to achieve some of the same objectives. Copenhagen Atomics’ primary
strengths currently lie in chemistry, measurement technology, and control systems.
We will start from here and build our competences and partnerships where it makes
most sense. The structure of our project resembles that of an open-source project
more than one of a large organization with a fully funded project and a fixed deliv-
ery date. Our mindset towards collaboration, openness, and sharing also resembles
that of an open-source project more than the typical corporate nuclear industry

project. The long-term goal is to be able to start more than one thorium breeder
MSR every day.
23.1
Reactor design choices
The best way to explain the design choices behind the CA Waste Burner is to
understand what it would take to power more than two-thirds of the entire global
population with energy at 200 GJ per capita per year (  1020 J/year). Clearly, it
would be possible to mine enough thorium to do so at low cost, thus the main prob-
lem is to get enough fissile material (U233, U235, and Pu239) to start these thorium
reactors. Only the last two will be available in significant quantities within the next
23 decades. U235 is obtained through enrichment of natural U, and Pu239 is
obtained from recycling SNF or old bomb material. Both enrichment of uranium
and recycling of plutonium are large political problems, because these techniques
can also be used for nuclear weapons. Therefore, it has been agreed internationally
that these technologies and the access to U and Th source materials must be
guarded with high security. The USA and the international atomic energy agency
(IAEA) have been trying to limit the number of countries globally with access to
enrichment and plutonium recycling, but all the weapon states have this technology.
Even if plutonium recycling and uranium enrichment were not political pro-
blems, it would still be highly unlikely that we humans would be able to produce
two-thirds or even 10% of global energy (1020 J/year) from any nuclear technology
before 2050 (www.theng.dk/simulation/breederfactor), unless we built some type of
breeder reactor. Research has shown that it may be possible to build thermal neu-
tron spectrum solid fuel thorium breeder reactors. However, the same research
shows that the breeding ratio would be very close to 1, with a doubling time of
many decades. Thus, it is clear that if nuclear energy is ever going to play a signifi-
cant role in global energy, then we must use (thermal or fast spectrum) liquid fuel
MSRs or fast spectrum solid fuel reactors. Nearly 20 fast spectrum solid fuel reac-
tors have been developed since the 1950s, and none of these has become a commer-
cial reactor. Thus, liquid fuel molten salt reactors are the best route to follow.
It is very important to depart from the mindset of today’s nuclear industry, where
it often takes more than 10 years to incorporate small changes to the current light-
water reactor technology. We must find a way to build MSRs with a rapid technol-
ogy improvement cycle. The oak ridge national laboratory-molten salt reactor
experiment (ORNL-MSRE) and physics capability show that it would be possible
to power the entire world with thorium MSRs, but political and funding issues are
large roadblocks. We concluded that a small modular reactor is likely to create the
least political problems and funding issues, while facilitating rapid technology
improvement cycles. However, we must be able to demonstrate to the public that
MSRs are safe and that the waste problem can be solved.
This book lists a number of different reactor designs, each of which advocates
different combinations of fuel mix and neutron spectrum (see Table 23.1).
600
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

Here we will only list a few of the main reasons why CA has chosen P239HW
for our reactor design.
We favor thermal reactors over fast reactors for two reasons:
1. The major limiting factor to how fast the world can deploy thorium MSRs as the primary
energy source is the amount of fissile fuel available in the world to start up these reactors.
The thermal fission cross-section is over 100 times larger than the fast spectrum cross-
section, so much more fissile inventory is needed to start up a fast reactor vs. a thermal
reactor of the same power rating.
2. Because the fissile fuel density of fast reactors is much higher than that of thermal reactors they
could go supercritical if a moderator (such as water or graphite) entered the salt. To circumvent
this danger requires extra safety systems, which may be complex, risky, and expensive.
We favor heavy water over graphite as a moderator two reasons:
1. Heavy water captures fewer neutrons than graphite, facilitating a better neutron economy
and breeding ratio. This makes it easier to solve problems related to reactor design and
waste reduction. In the very long term (30 years) we expect that the breeding ratio of the
CA Waste Burner, running on pure U233 after 10 generations, will reach a breeder ratio
of 1.1. By that time we will have burned most of the Pu239 from SNF in the world.
2. Until now, no one has been able to propose a way to decommission, or even better to
recycle, the radioactive graphite moderator after use. Thus, until the problem of graphite
decommissioning has been solved, we believe heavy water is an economic and ecolog-
ically better choice, with less R&D risk.
CA favors Pu239 over U235 as the startup fuel because:
1. The cost of enriched uranium may increase, which add risk to the choice of this fuel
cycle. Enrichment is also directly related to proliferation issues, and therefore may cause
additional risk associated with changing political and public opinion. Finally, the U235
fuel cycle results in large mining operations and waste.
2. The U235 fuel cycle eventually produces more long-lived actinides than the plutonium
thorium fuel cycle. Thus since CA want to make waste burners that minimize the amount of
SNF in the world the logical choice is to use the plutoniumthorium fuel cycle (Pu239
startup and Thorium breeding).
23.2
Mechanical design choices
CA believes it is paramount to have fast technology cycles and good breeding poten-
tial, and has therefore chosen to focus on a MSR design which can be made small,

while still having a fairly good breeding ratio. CA believes that a 13-m (40-ft)
shipping container unit size (see Fig. 23.1) gives the best tradeoff between perfor-
mance and small size for easy transport, recycling, and fast technology cycles.
Fig. 23.2 shows the plant arrangement. The reactor and the blanket are placed
underground (Fig. 23.3) and any such units can be placed next to each other inside
the reactor building dome to increase power and reliability. The thorium in the
blanket will capture leaking neutrons and ensure that the neutron and gamma radia-
tions on the outside of the blanket are very small. After several years the blanket
can be processed and a mix of Th232U233 can be used in a new reactor.
The CA Waste Burner uses the primary fuel salt as the heat transport medium.
Thus the flow rate of salt through the core is dictated by the reactor power output,
the heat capacity of the fuel salt, and the temperature drop of the primary heat
exchanger. Flow rates above 100 L/s are expected.
Simulations by CA show that it may be possible to remove between 25% and
50% of the fission products from the fuel salt (https://youtu.be/sDMFONiFAaI), if
it is fed through a vacuum aerosol directly after exiting the reactor core. This aero-
sol chamber is placed between the reactor core and the primary heat exchanger as
shown in Fig. 23.2.
Helium is used as the cover gas everywhere inside the waste burner, which is
sealed airtight after the fuel salt has been loaded. Helium is used to improve the fis-
sion product removal in the vacuum aerosol, and to separate the fission products
from the helium flow gas a helium purification membrane is used. All these sys-
tems are located inside the waste burner container.
The CA Waste Burner does not require a freeze plug, the dump tank is integrated
in the primary fuel salt loop. If power is lost, the salt will drain to the dump tank
where passive cooling is available when the liquid level rises above a certain point.
Passive cooling is achieved via long pipes drilled into the surrounding dirt at an
angle . 5 above horizontal and filled with oil (see Fig. 23.3). Passive convection
in the pipes removes the decay heat efficiently. Other decay heat removal systems
with contact to outside air or water streams carry the risk of attack on an easy single
point of failure by terrorists or other adversaries. If required by regulators our

passive underground decay heat removal system can be supplemented by one of the
traditional decay heat removal systems.
Control rods are known to capture precious neutrons and to make it difficult to
control power output of the reactor at low power. In the CA design the heavy water
tank is configured such that 95% of the water can be dumped in less than 2 seconds.
Thus, this can operate as a very efficient power control mechanism and allow the
reactor to run at very low power output. The heavy water moderator will only
absorb  1% of the reactor core heat, therefore the water will be circulated and
cooled outside the waste burner container. Hydrogen recombiners are also located
outside the waste burner container.
23.3
Recycling of spent nuclear fuel
A flame reactor (see Fig. 23.4) is an instrument that is less than 1 m high and 0.3 m in
diameter. It mixes a powder or a liquid with a F2 gas at the top and this creates a very
exothermic chemical reaction that often results in a visible flame, hence the name.
F2 reacts very willingly with any uranium in the input mix and creates UF6,
which is a gas. F2 may also react with other elements in the input stream. These dif-
ferent elements can usually be separated from UF6 very efficiently through simple
distillation. This makes the flame reactor a very efficient and low-cost method of
separating uranium from the fuel salt or from a spent fuel pellet granulate. Because

604
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

more than 95% of SNF is uranium, this is a great way to separate the uranium from
all the rest, which is mainly fission products and higher actinides.
UF and PuF species have different boiling points, they can be separated through
distillation. When the stream becomes relatively pure laser separation can be used
go to very high purity.
In a waste burner we want to feed all the higher actinides and plutonium into the
waste burner and burn them to become fission products or to transmute them into
something that can fission either in the waste burner or in an accelerator-driven sys-
tem. Some of these higher actinides capture neutrons, which is one of the reasons
we need to have a very good neutron economy in this MSR design.
The Pu239 in the spent fuel is especially valuable because it is ideal for starting
thermal MSRs. The pure uranium extracted from the SNF via the flame reactor is
similar in composition to the uranium extracted from mining, and it can be sold on
the global uranium market, as illustrated in Fig. 23.5. The extracted uranium is
expected to have a 10251027 contamination factor.
23.4
Molten salt reactor research
Nozzle spraying, an alternative to the traditional helium bubbling method, relies on
evaporation of noble gases and boiling of volatile fission product compounds. Some
fission products decay through multiple elements that are either noble gases or

volatile compounds. Salt droplets in a gas increase the surface area to volume ratio,
thereby significantly improving the fission product extraction relative to helium bub-
bling. This research, carried out by members from CA, in cooperation with partners
from the MIMOSA consortium. It includes both a theoretical study and numerical
simulations to determine and compare the efficiency of the nozzle spraying method
in comparison with traditional helium bubbling.
The objectives of the CA research are:
1. Theoretical models for diffusion and evaporation of volatile fission product fluoride spe-
cies from spherical droplets of varying diameters.
2. Literature review and experimental determination of boiling points, diffusion constants,
and vapor pressures of fuel components.
3. Numerical estimation of aerosolized salt advection out of the spraying chamber and means
of separating aerosolized salt from the flow stream.
4. Numerical estimation of the evaporation of fission products, fuel components, and acti-

The numerical simulations will be coupled with experimental data from
two techniques: low-pressure evaporation of volatile fluoride species at high
temperature using a pipe furnace, with different pressures and flow gasses. A
nozzle spraying loop under construction at CA will be used to determine
nozzle spraying droplet size under various conditions of temperature, flow
rate, and pressure. Both experiments will be carried out with LiFThF4 salts.
The nozzle spraying technology was presented at ThEC2015 (www.youtube.
com/watch?v5md90-FaEw7w). Similarly, a molten salt droplet spray was
designed earlier for tritium extraction from fusion reactor (Dolan et al.,
1992).
Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a measurement technology
that may be very well suited for molten salt reactors, reprocessing plants, and con-
trol of fuel salts storage and transport. LIBS is considered a nondestructive tech-
nique—less than 1 nanogram of material is consumed during a typical test. Tests
can be repeated several times per second. Laser pulses generate a high-temperature
microplasma on the surface of the sample, and the emitted light is analyzed by a
spectrometer, which facilitates remote in situ chemical composition analysis of mol-
ten salts. CA staff have done LIBS analysis of lithium/fluoride, thorium/uranium
salt samples and confirmed the ability to measure isotopes of Li6, Li7, U235,
U238, etc. Calibration of the LIBS equipment, part of the MIMOSA project, will
measure relative quantities of radioactive isotopes in irradiated fuel salt, to prepare
for use at the in-pile-loop at the Petten reactor in the Netherlands. LIBS ability to
measure ppm level salt components, such as corrosion materials and fission pro-
ducts, may be validated here.
If the above experiments turn out favorably, the IAEA and other nuclear
authorities may adopt LIBS as one of the technologies for safety and control of
salts containing fissile isotopes, for storage, transport, and online control of
606
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

reactor systems. The LIBS measurement technology will also be incorporated in
the nozzle spraying loops in Copenhagen.
By combining several technologies, we can measure accurately how much of
each isotope is in the frozen or molten salt or in the gases. This allows us to control
the redox potential of the salt accurately and to know the exact burnup, corrosion,
and radioactivity of the materials at any time during radioactive decay. Having
accurate measurements will allow us to build a very accurate model of the physical
processes in the reactor and help improve the safety, efficiency, and lifespan of the
waste burner. For both LIBS and infrared, it is possible to transfer the light to
instruments outside the waste burner container via optical fibers, in order to avoid
sensitive electronics inside the high-radiation zone.
23.5
“Prime minister safety”
It is often mentioned that MSRs should be built such that they are “prime minister
safe.” This refers to a design philosophy where no human, regardless of authority
level, would be able to prevent the reactor from shutting down when needed. The
CA Waste Burner has a set of systems governed by the laws of physics that cannot
be overruled by humans, and which will cause the reactor to shut down safely if
something goes wrong. As a second level of safety, a large number of the measure-
ment values such as temperature, pressure, vibrations, and isotopic composition are
combined into a measurement vector. This vector is continuously recorded similar
to the black box recorders in airplanes, and the values are recorded off site.
If this measurement vector is found outside a well-defined boundary of safe
operation then the reactor is automatically shut down by the computer system. This
well-defined boundary of safe operation will be hardcoded by CA in agreement
with the approval authority and cannot be changed by operators without entering a
new reactor design approval process.
This means that operators are not required to watch for alarms and act in accor-
dance. The CA Waste Burner must be able to automatically shut down before any
human can react to an alarm and choose what to do. If human action were ever
required for operation, other than during startup procedures, then we would con-
sider it a design failure, and recommend that all reactors of that design should be
shut down until the problem was corrected.

Introduction
The Seaborg Technologies’ Molten Salt Thermal Wasteburner (MSTW) is a ther-
mal spectrum, single salt, molten salt reactor, operated on a combination of spent
nuclear fuel (SNF) and thorium (Fig. 24.1). It is envisioned to produce 115 MW(e)
with a two-stage turbine, from 270 MW(th). The core outlet temperature is 700C,
but it can go as high as 900C for special uses, such as hydrogen production. The
MSTW is designed around inherent safety features; no active measures are required
to control the reactor under abnormal circumstances.
The fully modularized MSTW is suitable for mass production. As a module
reaches the end of its lifecycle, it will be extracted and returned for recycling in a
central production facility after it has cooled down. The reactor core, including the
graphite-based moderator, is projected to have a lifecycle of 7 years, while the
power plant will operate on the same batch of SNF for the 60-year facility lifetime.
The MSTW is in the early design phase, and Seaborg Technologies (ST) is focused
primarily on neutronics, radiative transfer, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and the
physics of the design. The reactor will be located in an underground cave (Fig. 24.2).
The MSTW is designed for electricity production, district heating/cooling, sea
water desalination, etc. Due to the high outlet temperature it is well suited for

synthetic fuel production, as well as industrial process heat applications. Its high
burnup and the fact that it is fueled directly with SNF make it a good option for
SNF stockpile reduction. However, as shown in Table 24.1, it can, without modifi-
cation, operate on a wide array of different fuels.
24.2
Design overview
24.2.1
Design philosophy
The MSTW was originally designed to address the three main concerns that
resulted in the Danish ban on nuclear power in 1985, namely safety, waste, and

proliferation. As the design has been developed and matured, these three concepts
together have been the essential philosophy around which the other features have
been planned and implemented.
Safety: The system is placed in an optimized configuration, whereby any pertur-
bation to such a system—from operator mistakes to major earthquakes—will move
the system away from the optimum and thus result in an automatic power reduction
and, if the situation is not alleviated, eventually reactor shutdown.
Waste: By combining SNF with thorium, the production of transuranic elements
(TRU) is lower than the rate at which they are created. The net reduction is roughly five
tonnes TRU over the 60-year plant lifetime. Fig. 24.3 shows the thorium fuel cycle.
Nonproliferation: To ensure high proliferation-resistance the MSTW is designed
to be a single salt reactor wherein the chemical reprocessing system is incapable of
extracting specific actinides. Furthermore, no actinide element will have an isotopic
composition usable for nuclear weapons at any point in the fuel cycle.

24.2.2
Power conversion unit
The MSTW utilizes a coolant salt-based core-integrated primary heat exchanger
system. The coolant salt acts as heat storage and flows through the primary side of
the steam generator, which transfers heat to a secondary salt circuit. A secondary
heat exchanger then transfers the heat to a tertiary circuit that delivers steam at
550C to the single- or two-stage turbines (Rankine cycle). The coolant salt and
heat exchanger system also serves as core shielding and neutron reflector.
24.2.3
Reactor core
The MSTW core is a graphite-based compound-moderator thermal reactor core
(Fig. 24.4). The core is slightly overmoderated to ensure negative void and tempera-
ture reactivity coefficients. The graphite is coated with a metal, and corrosion is
reduced by regularly circulating the fluoride salt through a fluoride burner and by
adding a reducing anode to the fuel salt. The reactor operates at 12 kW per liter core
volume, with a peak power density of 250 kW per liter fuel near the core center.
Swelling and corrosion of the graphite moderator is expected to be the limiting
factor for the lifetime of the core module.
The reactor core will passively shut down if overheated (negative thermal coeffi-
cient); therefore, loss of coolant accidents (LOCAs) will result in the reactor automat-
ically powering down. In the case of a continued inability to cool the core, the fuel
will eventually drain itself through a freeze plug to a passively cooled dump tank.
24.2.4
Fuel characteristics
The fuel salt is currently an eutectic sodiumactinide fluoride salt mixture, but
sodiumrubidiumactinide or sodiumzirconiumactinide fluoride salts are being
considered to reduce the actinide fraction in the salt, which will decrease the power
density in the fuel salt and reduce pumping power requirements. As shown in
Table 24.1, the design is highly flexible in terms of fuel. Initially an actinide fuel mix-
ture of 93% thorium, and 7% preprocessed SNF (3.5% uranium [1.1% enrichment]
and 3.5% reactor-grade plutonium) is foreseen, but over time the plutonium quality
decreases, and so only SNF is added, and the thorium fraction decreases.

24.2.5
Reactivity control
As shown in Fig. 24.5, the reactor has a strongly negative temperature coefficient,
which ensures a saturation temperature level of the core. For this reason the power
can be reduced by reducing cooling pump speed, or vice versa. The online refueling
slowly feeds fresh SNF into the salt (see Fig. 24.6), for continuous operation. Daily
adjustment of saturation temperature level is achieved using a series of graphite
fine-tuning rods, which can be inserted or extracted from the reactor. Using these
rods, the reactor can be maintained critical at its operational temperature for up to 2
months, without any addition of fresh SNF.
A Safety Control Rods Activation Method (SCRAM) system exists for the operators’
convenience, in additon to a redundant borofluoride injection system.
24.2.6
Reactor pressure vessel and internals
The reactor operates below atmospheric pressure above the fluid surface. The core,
chemical unit, dump tank, and other critical components are planned to be con-
tained in an airtight dome, able to withstand significant pressure, both from internal
and external events.

Molten salt thermal wasteburner

24.3
Safety and operation
In the MSTW safety is guaranteed by physics rather than engineering. The reactor
relies on natural convection, radiative heat transfer, and gravity for safety. The neu-
tronics of the reactor is designed to be under optimal conditions. Any unexpected
change to the system will result in a move away from the optimum, and thus a power
reduction or shutdown of the reactor. All active safety systems are redundant.
24.3.1
Emergency core cooling system and decay heat
removal system
In case of LOCA the core will heat up and the strong negative temperature coeffi-
cient will reduce reactivity and terminate power production without any operator
interference. After shut down the core will heat up from residual heating, and
passive cooling will be ensured through natural convection and radiative heat
transfer for a substantial time. However, if main cooling is not restored, the
reactor fuel will eventually drain itself (actively or passively) by melting a salt
freeze plug. In the drain tank the fuel will solidify and is cooled by conduction to
an underground heat sink.
24.3.2
Containment system
With the exception of noble gases, noble metals, and cadmium, fission products are
nonvolatile in a fluoride salt. Note that this includes the hazardous cesium and
iodine. The MSTW is designed so that temperatures which risk structural damage
are physically unreachable for a number of reasons, including the negative tempera-
ture coefficient and the balancing of residual heating and radiative heat transfer. As
such, no internally initialized accident events will lead to radioactive contamination
of the biosphere. Moreover, the noble gases and other similarly volatile fission pro-
ducts created in the salt are continuously extracted, handled, and vitrified, and are
therefore never present in significant amounts in the fluid. For this reason, the
source term, even during extreme disasters, will be small and will pose a minimal
off-site risk.
Despite the inherent safety, the reactor is designed with three barriers, where no
irradiated component, coolant, or fuel leaves the outer two barriers (dome and
reactor building—see Fig. 24.2) at point. This way licensing is anticipated by
adhering to well-known and accepted safety standards.
24.3.3
Plant safety and operational performances
The neutronic optimum design philosophy provides excellent transient behavior and
inherent safety features, and the plant has good load-following capabilities.
The heat storage in the coolant salt and the automatic saturation temperature of the
reactor enable power production to be cycled as fast as the steam generators can be
616
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

switched on and off. Furthermore, due to the removal of noble gases, and the
relatively large fuel inventory, the reactor will not experience issues with xenon
poisoning during shutdown or power reduction.
24.3.4
Instrumentation and control systems
The MSTW will have a series of control and monitoring features. Control will be
based on a series of fine-tuning moderator rods placed near the edge of the reactor
core, so that an ejection event will reduce reactivity (loss of reflector). The reactiv-
ity span of these rods will be such that the reactor core saturation temperature can
be adjusted within 200C, and such that critical temperatures are not reachable
through intentional or unintentional operator failures.
24.4
Plant arrangement
The plant design is not yet finalized. However, all irradiated components are con-
tained in an approximately 8 m deep and 12 m wide underground area, covered
with 2 m of concrete during operation (Fig. 24.2). The turbine building, control
room, and module handling area are placed above ground, above and around the
underground area. Since the overground components have no shielding require-
ments, distinguishing architectural designs will be used where applicable to consoli-
date the Seaborg trademark.
The plant is envisioned to have two operators, plus maintenance personnel for
turbines and other plant components. During module substitution, a team from the
central manufacturing site will be dispatched to the site.
24.5
Design and licensing status
ST is currently focused on advanced multiphysics, neutronics, and early engineering
details. The facility is planned as a green-field concept; decommissioning consid-
erations feature heavily in the design process; and most component parts are recy-
clable. Licensing considerations are included in the design process, and a plan has
been drafted, although it is not yet of prime importance.
24.6
Plant economics
The design is at a conceptual stage and the details of the plant economics are yet to
be assessed. It is our belief that the redundancy of all active systems will result in
significant cost reductions, through fewer engineering requirements and general
simplicity. Also, the centralized manufacturing and recycling of modules are
expected to benefit plant economics. Lastly, the short lifecycle of modules will
617
Molten salt thermal wasteburner

heavily reduce requirements of materials and engineering. This is expected to sig-
nificantly reduce the overnight cost, but will come at the expense of a increased
operating costs. Current trends in the nuclear industry suggest that postponing a
large fraction of the capital costs will be favorable from an economical point-of-
view.

25.1
The dual-fluid technology
The dual-fluid reactor (DFR) (Huke et al., 2013, 2014, 2015; Wang et al., 2015;
Wang, 2016) is a complete redesign of a nuclear power reactor, employing mature
technologies—among these many from areas other than nuclear technology—thus
resulting in a system which can be swiftly implemented as a straightforward engi-
neering project without further fundamental research. The resulting design remedies
the primary fault of deployed nuclear power plants (NPPs) of Generation IIII as
well as most of Generation IV and similar concepts and projects: the insufficient
economic competitiveness towards fossil fuel-fired power plants (particularly coal),
which is the chief reason why NPPs have such low market penetration among
worldwide power production. The ratio of reaction enthalpies between nuclear fis-
sion and carbon/hydrogen atom combustion amounts to eight orders of magnitude.
The NPP’s low utilization of its potential is especially dissatisfying. The DFR tech-

profound impact on national economies (Lambert, 2014). Since the DFR is also a
VHTR, operating at 1000C, its high efficiency would facilitate, contrary to the
Generation IV VHTR concepts, the synthesis of automotive fuels with an economic
edge in competition with fossil fuels.
The basic idea of the dual-fluid principle is a liquid-fueled fast reactor with sepa-
ration of the coolant from the fuel loop (see Fig. 25.1). The nuclear chain reaction
takes place in an arrangement of tubes through which the liquid fuel cycles and
which is set within a stream of pure molten lead (not an eutectic), the cooling
liquid. This goes beyond MSR concepts where both functions, cooling and fuel sup-
ply, must be provided by the same medium. What at first sight seems like a simple
invention has massive implications and resolves the former clash between high
power density, which is a sine qua non for a powerful economy, and inherent
passive safety, rendering expensive and failure-prone active safety systems super-
fluous. It combines the positive properties of the lead-cooled fast reactor (LFR),
i.e., high heat transportation capability and low activation of the coolant, with the
advantages of liquid fuel (as is used in an MSR), i.e., online reprocessing and pas-
sive safety via melting fuses. This efficiency enhancement is further sustained by
the internal liquid fuel cycle with partitioning and transmutation, thus enabling the
consumption of today’s LWR waste, thorium, natural and depleted uranium (see
Section 25.2). The economic advantages of liquid fuel, shedding the costly nuclear
fuel element cycle infrastructure, are also shared by the MSR, rendering the MSR
the only reactor concept with improved economics among Generation IV. In order
to simplify pyroprocessing and enable very high power density, the dual-fluid

the melting fuses (green cylinders).

principle goes a step further than usual MSR designs though, by employing
undiluted actinide trichloride salts such as UCl3 in the DFR/s (see below), without a
carrier salt.
There are two variants of the DFR currently under development:
G
DFR/s with molten salt fuel already boasts a number of advantages in respect to the
“usual” MSR concepts. Thanks to the dual-fluid principle, heat can be removed from the
core much more efficiently, making it possible to use pure undiluted actinide chloride
salts. This results in a very compact core, allowing for the economical use of expensive,
highly corrosion-resistant materials, which allow a very high operating temperature of
1000C.
G
DFR/m with molten metal fuel further increases power density and the hardness of the
neutron spectrum. Due to much higher heat conduction and actinide atomic density of the
metallic fuel (consisting of eutectics with more than 70 atomic% actinides), several
improvements of the reactor construction could be additionally made, considerably
enhancing its economics. Tentative simulations indicate conversion ratios approaching
two (when included, most actinides with even neutron number become burnable, e.g.,
234U, 240Pu) as a consequence of the hardened neutron spectrum.
Neutron simulations (Wang et al., 2015; Wang, 2016) show that the DFR has a
deeply negative fuel temperature coefficient which makes the DFR self-regulating
with no need for any mechanical parts in the core. Moreover, the DFR can satisfy
all the goals of Gen IV (Generation IV), as defined by the Generation Four
International Forum (GIF), in one system: sustainability, nonproliferation, physical
protection, economics, safety, waste management, and high temperature heat energy
for process chemistry.
Even compared to other fast-fission reactors, the DFR’s neutron spectrum is
extremely hard, making it highly efficient both as a transuranium incinerator and as
a thorium breeder. As for all fast-fission reactors, during DFR operation no waste
stream of unwanted actinides (e.g., minor actinides or Pu) is produced, thus the
search for geological repositories becomes irrelevant.
25.2
Fuel cycle: the pyroprocessing unit
The fuel is recycled online within the containment in the pyrochemical processing
unit (PPU). The PPU can be directly fed with irradiated fuel from current LWRs—
the material only needs to be transformed from oxides to chlorides, which could be
done on-site. Thus, the complex PUREX process becomes obsolete and the han-
dling of used fuel is simplified enormously. The DFR unites partitioning and trans-
mutation (P&T) in one plant.
The lower boiling points of the chloride salts allow for partitioning by fractional
distillation/rectification, a very straightforward reprocessing technology compared
to MSRs. This industrial technology is well-established in chemical plants, petro-
leum refineries, gas and liquid air processing, and can easily be adapted to the parti-
tioning of the fuel salt using similar distillation columns. Indeed, a process
621
Dual-fluid reactor

operating under similar conditions has already seen large-scale industrial applica-
tion since the 1930s: the Kroll process for production of titantium group metals.
For the metal fuel variant, DFR/m, a further chlorination and reduction process
needs to be inserted before and after the PPU. Volatile and noble metal fission pro-
ducts are processed in a prestage, analogous to the MSR. The considerably lower
total volume of the undiluted actinide fuel salt reduces the size of the processing
facility accordingly and thus also presents a safety improvement. Since outside of
the reactor core neutronics do not need to be taken into account, there is a much
wider choice of suitable structural materials. Any refractory material or combina-
tions thereof can be considered. The heat generation of fission products is not an
obstacle but an asset, since it supports evaporation of the fuel.
Partitioning by the PPU optimizes nuclear waste management in an economical
manner. The low volume of the fuel inventory as well as the shedding of the fuel
element cycle along with aqueous PUREX-type reprocessing and its accompanying
production of considerable volumes of medium-level radioactive waste from radi-
olytically destroyed auxiliary chemicals mark substantial progress. The DFR is an
adiabatic reactor, meaning that only fissionable material must be provided to the
plant, without any transports to an off-site fuel cycle infrastructure being required.
25.3
Applications
Possible applications are shown in Fig. 25.2. Even though they are possible for
every high-temperature reactor system, the low production costs enabled by the
DFR give them a pronounced economic advantage. Not only can electricity be gen-
erated with very high efficiency, but the synthesis chain also becomes viable for
Figure 25.2 Applications of the dual-fluid reactor.
622
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

inexpensive chemical products such as ammonia and hydrazine for vehicles or
petrochemical compounds. Additionally, large-scale desalination of seawater would
be possible.
25.4
Electricity production
For electricity generation, the heat energy needs to be transduced from the liquid
metal, a medium with very high heat transport capacity, to a working medium with
considerably lower capacity suitable for turbines. Without further research and
development, the most cost-effective state-of-the-art technology is the supercritical
water (scH2O) cycle. Another near-future possibility are supercritical carbon diox-
ide (scCO2) turbines (Dostal, 2004; Wright et al., 2010; US Department of Energy,
2013), resulting in more compact machine components with a slightly higher ther-
mal efficiency and significantly reduced corrosion rates [e.g., using industrial
INCONEL MA 754 nickel-base alloy (Oh et al., 2004)], but pressures approxi-
mately equal to scH2O turbines.
25.5
Synthetic fuels
The operating temperature of 1000C enables highly efficient production of hydro-
gen from water through combined electrolysis and thermolysis. This method, the
HOT ELLY process, was developed for the high-temperature reactor at the Ju¨lich
Research Center in Germany. Alternatively, the sulfur-iodine cycle could produce
hydrogen at a temperature of only .830C.
Due to the low energy density of hydrogen gas, it may be more useful to bind
the hydrogen in fluid chemical compounds that are easy to handle. These synthetic
fuels are also known as XtL-fuels, meaning conversion of substance X to liquid.
The relevant industrial-scale synthesis processes are well-developed and used com-
mercially—mainly for chemical engineering in primary production. Synthesized
fuels made from fossil fuels are wasteful compared to petroleum products.
The situation changes when nuclear thermal energy is utilized. Combined with
the previously generated hydrogen, it allows hydrogenation of coal via the Bergius
process, through which synthetic benzine or diesel could be formed (CtL-fuel: coal
to liquid). Instead of hydrogen, the Fischer-Tropsch process may employ syngas.
25.6
Hydrazine for combustion and fuel cells
In order to avoid the exploitation of coal—because it is not available or the genera-
tion of carbon dioxide is undesirable—atmospheric nitrogen may be used instead of
carbon. Here, the synthetic fuel of choice would be hydrazine (N2H4), a liquid fuel
with properties similar to benzine (including toxicity). Hydrazine has been used as
623
Dual-fluid reactor

a rocket propellant for 80 years. Produced by nuclear energy, it becomes an afford-
able alternative to petroleum products for use in transport. As liquid fuel, it may be
combusted in piston engines of vehicles and in turbines of aircraft with only minor
modifications similar to those for other alternative fuels, mostly affecting the quan-
tities of injected fuel and the ignition points. Hydrazine combustion is a very clean
process creating water and nitrogen. Thus, hydrazine may be considered an NtL-
fuel: nitrogen to liquid.
Hydrazine fuel cells may be produced at a lower price and be operated more
efficiently than hydrogen fuel cells, as power density and the level of efficiency are
significantly higher, and no rare, expensive metals such as platinum are needed
for their production. In the past, hydrazine fuel cells have already been used
successfully in spacecraft.
25.7
Silane
Silanes are the silicon homologs to carbon-based alkanes, which present an StL (sil-
icon to liquid) synhetic fuel option. Starting with heptasilane (Si7H16), they are sta-
ble, easy to handle and possess very high energy densities. At combustion
temperatures above 1400C, where silane burns exothermically with oxygen to
water and with nitrogen to silicon nitride (Si3N4), consuming 99% of atmospheric
intake, it is perfectly suitable for hypersonic ramjets or scramjets. Modified Wankel
engines in vehicles could also handle the dusty combustion products.
25.8
Other applications
25.8.1
Radiotomic chemical production
The short-lived fission product storage may be designed in an alternative fashion in
order to utilize the intense radiation for radiotomic induction of chemical reactions
requiring high doses (kGy/s) (Stannet and Stahel, 1971). Examples are production
of nitrogen oxides (NO(2)), ozone (O3), hydrocyanic acid (HCN), and carbon mon-
oxide (CO). Nitrogen oxide and ozone can be obtained by irradiation of compressed
air. Hydrocyanic acid originates from methane and nitrogen. Carbon monoxide
results from radiative dissociation of carbon dioxide. In the chemical industry, such
processes are already in use, though with radionuclide gamma sources and consider-
ably lower yield. The application of reactors for radiotomic chemical synthesis has
been investigated in the past. When the exploration of innovative reactor concepts
was abandoned, this research was also stopped. The topic is comprehensively cov-
ered in a review article (Stannet and Stahel, 1971). The short-lived fission product
storage of the DFR reference plant with its own thermal power of B30 MW may
produce 1045 tons/year of chemicals. It is also possible to design a special reactor
core in order to utilize its much higher radiation intensity for chemical synthesis.

25.8.2
Medical isotope production
The radiotracer 99mTc is a prime example of a medical application that would not
be possible without a nuclear reactor. The search for an alternative during the
worldwide molybdenum crisis in 2009/2010 failed due to the high neutron flux
required for the production of the 99mTc precursor 99Mo (A Supply and Demand
Update of the Molybdenum-99 Market, 2012). Cost-effective production of 99Mo in
commercial reactors seems to be impossible, as this would necessitate near-daily
fuel element cycling coupled with high-throughput reprocessing, which would be
extremely uneconomic and pose proliferation risks, so research reactors are mainly
used. An expensive separation process follows, and due to the short half-life of
99Mo of only 3 days, a sophisticated logistic chain to finally deliver the technetium
generators to hospitals is required. One single DFR produces several times the
world demand—around 300 g per year, corresponding to 700,000 6 day Curies or
the amount created by a 3 GWth DFR in approximately 1 day, and, more impor-
tantly, already provides it in separated form, as volatile fission products as well as
inert (with respect to chlorine) metals including molybdenum are removed from the
salt by noble gas bubbling; the metals will accumulate on the bubble surfaces.
From this concentrated inert metal mixture, the molybdenum can be fairly easily
extracted, so that complete on-site medical-clean production of the technetium gen-
erators becomes feasible, simplifying the logistics of delivery to hospitals. This
could lead to a cost implosion for the 99mTc radiotracer and therefore a surge in
applications.
25.9
Structural materials
The high operating temperature requires very stable and corrosion-resistant materi-
als in the reactor core. For a solid-fueled reactor, this would be problematic, as the
amount of structural material for solid reactors is high with respect to the nominal
power and the cladding cannot be reused upon fuel exchange. In contrast, the DFR
core is very compact, requiring only small amounts that remain in the core for a
long time while the liquid fuel is constantly exchanged (10 times lower structural
material consumption). This allows for the utilization of substances that are difficult
to manufacture. Several suitable refractory alloys and industrial ceramics have been
known for decades, but their fabrication was too difficult and therefore uneconomi-
cal. The situation has changed in recent decades. Today, these materials can be
tooled to versatile shapes in mass production, using advanced sintering and forging/
joining techniques.
Silicon carbide (SiC), which is known for its low neutron capture cross-section,
has been selected for the DFR/s core. Most of all dense CVD-like SiC is very resis-
tant against lead corrosion at over 1000C, even when lithium is added (Pb-17Li),
while pure Li would dissolve SiC at 500C (Pint et al., 2005). Regarding molten
salt corrosion, much less data are available for SiC. It has been tested with NaCl
which has an enthalpy (Taube and Ligou, 1974) similar to UCl3 and showed good
625
Dual-fluid reactor

resistance at up to 900C (Rigaud, 2011), even though it was a much less
corrosion-resistant variant (reaction-bonded SiC with Si excess). In comparison, the
corrosion resistance of CVD-SiC has been shown to be far greater (Olson, 2009).
Below 1200C, this material also displays high irradiation resistance, whereas SiC/
SiC fiber pieces are less durable, although the newest generation of these compo-
sites seems to be more robust (Katoh et al., 2007). Microcrystalline damage caused
by the high neutron flux and thermal stress will be automatically healed at these
high temperatures (annealing in metals). Ceramics are even more resilient
at elevated temperatures. Most likely SiC is also suitable for the DFR/m though
insufficient data for interaction with the liquid euctetic fuel are available. A
suitable alternative is ZrC-20mass%TiC with low penalty, due to the outstanding
neutron economy of the DFR/m.
25.10
Energy return on investment
Energy return on investment is probably the most important factor characterizing
the economical efficiency of an energy source. It is defined as the ratio of the total
electricity output of a power plant during its lifetime to the expended exergy for
construction, fuel supply expense, maintenance, and decommissioning (Ayres et al.,
1998; Weißbach et al., 2013), also called energy invested or cumulative energy
demand (CED).
Calculation of the EROI requires a full life cycle assessment (LCA) in order to
determine the correct CED. For a typical 1400 MWe PWR, a major part of the
CED is needed for the enrichment of uranium. A newly built PWR with mostly cen-
trifuge enrichment has an EROI of 75105, with complete LASER enrichment up
to 115 (Weißbach et al., 2013), more than four times greater than the EROI of fossil
power plants—but it also shows the limits of PWRs and Generation III(1 1 ) tech-
nology in general. Another important factor contributing to the low EROI is the
expenses for the fuel element infrastructure industry. The utilization of fuel ele-
ments also requires elaborate multiple-redundancy active and passive safety systems
in order to counteract the risk of core meltdown, further reducing the EROI in
effect.
Table 25.1 describes the CED for the DFR/s NPP, leading to an EROI of 2000
which is 25 times higher than that of today’s PWR technique (Weißbach et al.,
2013).
The large EROI gain of the DFR mainly results from two aspects: The shedding
of costly external fuel processing infrastructure (improvement of more than a factor
of three) and the far greater compactness and simplicity compared to a light-water
reactor (another factor of six). Additional minor improvements arise from lower
maintenance and much less fuel consumption as well as significantly smaller dis-
posal needs. The higher per-mass efforts for the refractory parts are far outweighed
by the extreme reduction of material amounts needed for construction (several 1000
metric tons of nickel alloys and highly alloyed steels in a light-water reactor versus

The ratio leads to the EROI of amost 2000. Since some materials (especially refractory metals) must be investigated
and modified for use in the DFR, their energy inventory must be estimated. Furthermore, the maintenance for the
nuclear part is also unknown, causing the same uncertainties

a few 100 metric tons of refractories for the DFR). Likewise, a DFR/m NPP
exceeds this figure significantly, approaching 5000.
The very compact design lowers the construction energy demand almost to the
level of CCGT plants on a per-watt basis, and the fuel-related energy demands are
tiny compared to light-water reactors due to their efficient usage. Further optimiz-
ing the design and extracting the fuel at basic crust concentrations (B10 ppm for
thorium) leads to a domination of the fuel-related input, showing that the DFR
exhausts the potential of nuclear fission to a large extent. Indeed, mining fissionable
material at the crust’s mean concentration limits the EROI of nuclear power to
10,000 (neglecting the plant’s CED), concurrently extending the range of fission
fuel to B1 Ga, thus turning fission power by definition into a “renewable energy
source,” since it will last until the further evolution of the Sun renders the Earth
inhospitable to life (Table 25.2).

Comparison with other reactor types
Table 25.3 shows the DFR in comparison with other reactor types. We restricted
the table to fast fission systems and the LWR.
One major characteristic of a nuclear reactor with regard to sustainable fuel
usage and waste production is its neutron economy expressed by the neutron excess.
The DFR and especially the metal fuel variant has the highest possible excess
which allows for multiple transmutation applications, reduced inventory doubling
times, and thus improves the utilization of the difficult thorium cycle significantly.
Apart from the LWR, only SFR operating experience has been gathered, indicating
that the electricity production costs for a Superphe´nix-like SFR are twice that of a
PWR (Nifenecker et al., 2003). Power density, system complexity, and necessity of
an external infrastructure contribute to the overall expenditures. Therefore, the
GCR and TP-1 would probably be more expensive than the SFR. The LFR is com-
parable to an LWR, although somewhat better. Only the MSR can considerably out-
perform an LWR, thus it is the most viable concept of Generation IV. The DFR
exploits the advantages of liquid fuels to the fullest, widely opening up the power
plant market for nuclear.

26.1 Australia
Lyndon Edwards
Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), Sydney, Australia
Australia has been a major supplier of nuclear fuel cycle materials since the 1950s
and on current estimates (Uranium, 2014; ,www.ansto.gov.au/AboutANSTO/
OPAL.) has over 30% of the world’s easily accessible uranium resources and over
638
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

10% of the world’s easily accessible thorium. Much of the thorium resources in
Australia are in the rare earth-thorium phosphate mineral, monazite, within heavy
mineral sand deposits, which are mined for their ilmenite, rutile, leucoxene, and zir-
con contents, where the thorium remains in the tailings which are usually returned
to the mine site and dispersed to reduce the radiation hazard. The mineral resource
extraction industry in Australia is globally competitive. If the market for thorium
does become viable, then Australia would be one of the top three thorium produ-
cers, as is the case for uranium.
The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) and its
predecessor, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission (AAEC), have a long his-
tory of research on the development and sustainment of nuclear reactors. Although
there have been proposals and initiatives to introduce nuclear power in Australia in
the past, none has ever progressed to construction or operation of a nuclear power
plant, for both political and economic reasons.
In recent times, in conjunction with the Argentinian firm, INVAP, ANSTO has
designed, developed, constructed and now operates what is arguably the most
modern research reactor in the world. The OPAL multipurpose reactor provides
state-of-the-art facilities for neutron diffraction, radiopharmaceutical production,
and materials irradiation (,www.world-nuclear-news.org/RS-IAEA-chief-witnesses-
progress-of-Australian-medicine-plant-08081601.html.).
ANSTO’s current nuclear power-related research concentrates on nuclear materials
engineering in their widest context, including fundamental radiation damage research,
nuclear component manufacturing, component and system structural assessment, and
component life in high-temperature nuclear environments. Australia also has a long and
distinguished history of innovation in waste conditioning and is the world leader in the
use of Synroc, an Australian invention. ANSTO is currently constructing the world’s
first operational intermediate-level waste (ILW) conditioning plant, based on Australian
Synroc technology as part of its expansion of its production of the radiopharmaceutical
Mo99 (,www.ansto.gov.au/BusinessServices/ANMProject/index.htm.; ,www.science.
gov.au/international/CollaborativeOpportunities/ACSRF/jointResearch/Pages/ANSTO-
SINAP.aspx.).
In 2012, the Institute of Materials Engineering (IME), whose capabilities and
expertise now form ANSTO’s nuclear materials platform (the ANSTO’s Nuclear
Fuel Research Group), was the recipient of a grant from the Australia-China
Science Research Fund to form a Joint Research Centre (JRC) with the Shanghai
Institute of Applied Physics (SINAP), to conduct fundamental studies of the perfor-
mance of materials in molten salt environments (,www.science.gov.au/interna-
tional/CollaborativeOpportunities/ACSRF/jointResearch/Pages/ANSTO-SINAP.
aspx.; ,www.ansto.gov.au/ResearchHub/IME/Projects/SINAP/.). The ANSTO/
SINAP Joint Materials Research Centre has focused on MSR-relevant research on
the high-temperature properties (He et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015; Shrestha et al.,
2016), radiation effects (De Los Reyes et al., 2014, 2016; Reichardt et al., 2015),
and the corrosion behavior of relevant nickel alloys and graphite materials
(Reichardt et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2015).
Following unanimous approval by the Generation IV International Forum (GIF)
members, Australia became the 14th member of the Forum on June 22, 2016. The
639
Worldwide activities

GIF Charter was signed by CEO Dr Adrian (Adi) Paterson of the ANSTO (,www.
gen-4.org/gif/jcms/c_71564/australia-joins-the-generation-iv-international-forum.;
,www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP-Australia-joins-fourth-generation-reactor-
forum-0305165.html.). Australia’s intention is to contribute research on the very
high temperature reactor (VHTR) and the molten salt reactor (MSR) systems.
Australia also proposes to participate in the VHTR Material (MAT) Project
Arrangement and the Risk and Safety Working Group. It is thus expected that
Australia will continue research into MSRs and in particular the materials chal-
lenges of MSRs for the foreseeable future.

MSR activities in Canada are concentrated in the Integral Molten Salt Reactor
(IMSR), which is a uranium-fueled, graphite-moderated, fluoride chemistry, thermal
spectrum molten salt reactor system designed by Terrestrial Energy Incorporated. It
is described in Chapter 18, Integral molten salt reactor.

Research Centre ˇReˇz, Husinec - ˇReˇz, Czech Republic
The technology of nuclear reactor systems with liquid molten salt fuel has been
investigated in the Czech Republic since 1999. The original effort came from the
national partitioning and transmutation concept based on the subcritical accelerator-
driven system for the incineration of transuranium elements with liquid fluoride
fuel and fluoride pyrochemical partitioning fuel cycle technology. After 2005, the
original R&D intentions were gradually converted to a classical molten salt reactor
technology and to the thoriumuranium fuel cycle. Arguments for this decision
were presented by a group of prominent Czech nuclear scientists. These arguments
were based on the fact that the Czech Republic should support the development of
a technology that can minimize the environmental impact of nuclear power, save
natural resources and has a potential to be deployed also in non-superpower
countries, whereas fast reactors, which need highly enriched uranium or a high
plutonium content, will represent the future of nuclear power for superpowers.
The theoretical and experimental development of MSR and liquid thorium fuel
technology have been realized by a national consortium of institutions and compa-
nies originally led by the Nuclear Research Institute ˇReˇz.
After the first R&D activities in 200003, devoted mainly to the subcritical
molten salt system for incineration of transuranium elements, since 2004 the
main R&D effort has been focused on critical MSR systems; and since 2005 the
thoriumuranium fuel cycle technology has also been under intensive study.
The Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic supported two impor-
tant R&D projects devoted to the MSR system and thoriumuranium fuel cycle.
The first, which was opened in 2004, was called “Nuclear system SPHINX with
molten fluoride salts based liquid nuclear fuel,” the second, opened in 2006, was
“Fluoride reprocessing of GEN IV reactor fuels.” The investigations were based on
641
Worldwide activities

experience obtained by the US Oak Ridge National Laboratory during the Molten-
Salt Reactor Experiment project in the 1960s (Rosenthal et al., 1971) and also from
the exchange of scientific information with the French EDF team on the AMSTER
project in 2000 (Vergnes et al., 2000).
The SPHINX project was devoted to the broad spectrum of the MSR technology
covering theoretical and experimental activities in MSR physics, fuel salt and fuel
cycle chemistry, molten salt thermohydraulics, structural material development, and
testing of apparatuses for molten fluoride salt media. The project was carried out by a
consortium of institutions and companies led by the Nuclear Research Institute ˇReˇz in
cooperation with ˇSKODA JS (ˇSKODA—Nuclear Machinery), Nuclear Physics
Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Faculty of Nuclear
Sciences and Physical Engineering of the Czech Technical University in Prague, and
Energovyzkum Ltd. Brno, and later also with the Research Centre ˇReˇz and COMTES
FHT. The main aims of the project were to contribute to the knowledge of MSR reac-
tor physics, core design and safety, structural material development, MSR fuel cycle
technology; to verify experimentally selected important areas of MSR technology;
and to contribute to the solution of existing bottlenecks. Research work under the
SPHINX project was divided into following work packages:
G
WP1—MSR core and primary circuit;
G
WP2—MSR fuel cycle technology;
G
WP3—Experimental MSR core and its control system;
G
WP4—Secondary circuit and its components;
G
WP5—Structural materials for MSR technology;
G
WP6—System study of MSR-SPHINX;
G
WP7—Experimental program SR-0.
The second project “Fluoride reprocessing” was devoted to the experimental devel-
opment of two fluoride partitioning technologies, specifically to the fluoride volatility
method and to electrochemical separation processes from fluoride molten salt media.
As the fluoride volatility method can be used for oxide fuels from fast reactors, the
investigation of electrochemical separation processes has been exclusively devoted to
the thoriumuranium fuel cycle of the molten salt reactor system. The work within
this project also covered the experimental verification of fresh liquid molten salt fuel
processing—a technology of ThF4 and UF4 preparation from ThO2 and UO2, respec-
tively, and final processing of MSR fuel salts LiF-BeF2-ThF4 and LiF-BeF2-UF4.
Other objectives of the MSR fuel cycle investigation were system studies focused on
the material balance calculations and a conceptual flow-sheet design of MSR on-line
reprocessing. Both one-fluid (single-fluid) and two-fluid (double-fluid) systems of
MSR core design were investigated, and conceptual flow-sheets were designed for
both design systems. Finally, the project also covered the nonproliferation and physical
protection aspects of Th-U MSR fuel cycle technology.
Although the MSR design and operation were already verified by ORNL in the
1960s, the on-line reprocessing was never fully realized and still represents a cru-
cial problem of MSR technology, which must be solved before MSRs can be
deployed in the future. The “Fluoride reprocessing” project was solved by the
Nuclear Research Institute ˇReˇz.
642
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

The main achievements of both projects were:
G
Challenging reactor physics experiments with inserted molten salt zones were realized in
LR-0 and LVR-15 and VR-1 reactors at the Nuclear Research Institute ˇReˇz, the Research
Centre ˇReˇz, and the Czech Technical University.
G
Computer codes for calculation of neutronic characteristics of the MSR system and for
calculation of the composition evolution during the burnout of liquid fuel were developed.
G
In the fluorine chemistry laboratory of the Nuclear Research Institute ˇReˇz, handling with
beryllium-containing molten salts was mastered, fresh thorium and uranium molten salt fuel
processing for MSR systems was verified in semipilot conditions, and the basic studies of
electrochemical separation of actinides (Th, U) from fission products were realized. These
electrochemical studies were devoted to MSR on-line reprocessing development.
G
MSR fuel cycle mass balance calculations and conceptual flow-sheets of on-line reproces-
sing were designed.
G
A special nickel alloy called MONICR, resistant to molten fluoride salt media, was devel-
oped by ˇSKODA JS and COMTES FHT companies. Irradiation and corrosion tests of the
MONICR alloy and metallographic studies were performed and experimental production
of sheets, tubes, and rods was realized.
G
Basic design and theoretical and experimental development of impellers and valves for molten
fluoride salts and “salt/salt” and “salt/air” heat exchangers were realized by Energovy´zkum Ltd.
G
The Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering of the Czech Technical
University in Prague opened new facultative topics “Liquid nuclear fuels” and “MSR sys-
tem technology” for regular and PhD students.
The LR-0 reactor, operated by the Research Centre ˇReˇz, has proved to be
extremely suitable equipment for measurement of molten salt neutronics. The mea-
surements were realized in molten salt zones inserted in the central part of the reactor
core. The standard VVER fuel served as the neutron driver (Fig. 26.3.1). Basic criti-
cal parameters (the critical height of the moderator, the moderator level coefficient)
were determined for each arrangement using the approved methodology of the initial
critical experiments for the LR-0 reactor. These, along with a description of the fuel
quantity, enrichment, and filling material, represent the fundamental data needed to
determine the effects of the filling on the physical properties of the core, and serve as
the input for calculations and benchmark comparisons. The initial critical experiments
were followed by measurements of neutron flux and reaction rate to determine the
characteristics of the neutron and photon field using the following methods. The
increase in reactivity was determined by differences in the critical moderator level
with and without the salt (Hron and Matal, 2008; Fry´bort and Voˇcka, 2009).
The theoretical and experimental investigations of MSR fuel cycle technology at
the Nuclear Research Institute ˇReˇz have been focused mainly on the electrochemi-
cal separation processes in fluoride media suitable for utilization within the MSR
on-line reprocessing technology. The main objective of experimental activities on
electrochemical separation technology has been to survey the separation possibili-
ties of the selected actinides (uranium, thorium) and fission products (lanthanides)
in selected fluoride melt carriers. The cyclic voltammetry method was used to study
the basic electrochemical properties.
The first step was the choice of fluoride melts suitable for electrochemical
separations. The melt should meet some basic characteristics—low melting point,
high solubility, high electrochemical stability, and appropriate physical properties
643
Worldwide activities

(electrical conductivity, viscosity, etc.). A special reference electrode based on the
Ni/Ni21 red-ox couple was developed to provide reproducible electrochemical mea-
surements in fluoride melts (Straka et al., 2009, 2011) and to facilitate the on-line
reprocessing flow-sheet design (Uhlı´ˇr et al., 2012a).
Results obtained from the measurements were interpreted in the following way:
G
In FLIBE melt, there is a good possibility for electrochemical separation of uranium.
Although the electrochemical studies of protactinium have not been realized yet, based on
the thermodynamical properties of PaF4, there is a presumption that protactinium could be
separated from this melt as well.
G
In FLINAK and in LiF-CaF2 melts, both uranium and thorium and most of the fission
products (lanthanides) can be electrochemically separated.
The national projects described above were successfully finalized in 2009
(SPHINX) and 2012 (fluoride reprocessing) (Hron et al., 2009; Uhlı´ˇr et al., 2012b).
The main goals were achieved in both projects, and the obtained knowledge and
experience created a good basis for international collaboration of Czech companies
in further collaborative R&D projects of MSR technology. In 2012, the Ministry of
Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic and US Department of Energy concluded
a Memorandum of Understanding focused on the collaborative investigation of the
fluoride-salt-cooled high-temperature reactor (FHR) and molten salt reactor technol-
ogies. Current Czech activities in this field cover mainly the areas of:
G
Experimental reactor physics of FHR and MSR;
G
Measurement of new neutronic data of coolant and fuel salts;
Figure 26.3.1 View into the LR-0 reactor core with inserted salt zone and the manipulation
with the salt zone before the insertion into reactor core.

G
Further development of nickel alloys for molten fluoride salt technologies;
G

These activities are supported by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
Czech activity in R&D of MSR technology has also enabled individual Czech
research teams to participate in several international projects devoted to MSR tech-
nology (MOST, ALISIA, and EVOL projects of the 5th, 6th, and 7th Framework
Programme of EC-EURATOM, selected CRP projects of IAEA and studies of
OECD-NEA). Czech representatives also participate in the work of the Provisional
System Steering Committee of MSR System of the Generation Four International
Forum under the membership of the EURATOM team.

26.5 Denmark
Thomas J. Pedersen
Technical University of Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark
Along with other European countries, Denmark from the mid-1950s engaged in the
development of peaceful applications of nuclear energy. In 1956 the Atomic
Energy Commission, later the Risø National Laboratory, was established with three
nuclear reactors, becoming a large Danish research center for nuclear technologies.
With Niels Bohr as one of its founding fathers, R&D at the Risø National
Laboratory took a broader perspective than nuclear energy only, and resources were
allocated to other technologies, including isotope production, materials studies, and
(later) renewable energy and environmental research. The DR3 reactor, a 10-MW
heavy water reactor was for many years a major research facility in Europe, used as
a neutron source for materials investigations, for medical isotope production, and
for doping semiconductors for the electrical power industry.
During the 1970s the public attitude to atomic energy shifted, and the larger
Danish utilities lost interest in building nuclear power plants. Instead, the energy
supply was based on imported oil and coal, later supplemented by natural gas pro-
duction from the North Sea. In 1985, the Danish Parliament decided not to include
nuclear power in Danish energy planning. Today, Denmark is self-sufficient in
primary energy supply, due to the large domestic production of oil, natural gas, and
wind energy. A goal is to discontinue the use of fossil fuels entirely by 2050.
As a consequence of the nuclear power production ban, public funding for R&D
related to nuclear energy also diminished. The last of the three nuclear reactors at
Risø was closed in 2000 and the state-owned company Danish Decommissioning
was established to take responsibility for the nuclear facilities at Risø and for the
radioactive waste in Denmark. In 2007, Risø National Laboratory became part of
the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). Meanwhile, nuclear technologies
R&D at DTU shifted towards other fields of research, including radiation physics,
dosimetry, radioecology, and the production of medical isotopes.
In 2015, Denmark saw the dawn of two small start-ups aimed at developing
molten salt reactor (MSR) technologies: Copenhagen Atomics and Seaborg
Technologies.
26.5.1
Copenhagen Atomics
Thomas Jam Pedersen, Chairman of the Board, Copenhagen Atomics
Copenhagen Atomics (CA) is a startup company developing a heavy water moder-
ated molten salt reactor design (HWMSR), which improves neutron economy and
recycling economy significantly over typical thermal MSR designs that rely on
646
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

graphite moderators. The goal is to develop this into a breeder reactor, which can
be manufactured on an assembly line. CA is based on an open-source philosophy,
where publishing results and collaboration with other teams are encouraged. In such
collaborations CA strengths are primarily related to measurement technology,
chemical processing, and control systems. In collaboration with other European
players CA is currently developing equipment for measuring isotopic compositions
down to ppm levels in fluoride and chloride salts up to 900C in a sealed reactor
environment. CA also has a salt loop experiment where they test fission product
removal from molten salts. A shareholder company of CA (Th Engineering) is
developing an operating system for MSRs, which will be licensed for free to
research and demonstration reactors. CA also hosts monthly meeting sessions on
thorium MSR in Copenhagen (see Chapter 23: Copenhagen atomics waste burner).
26.5.2
Seaborg Technologies ApS
Troels Scho¨nfeldt, CEO, Seaborg Technologies
Seaborg Technologies is a startup company founded by particle, nuclear, and
neutron physicists, with roots at CERN, European Spallation Sources (ESS), and
the Center of Nuclear Technologies at DTU. Today, Seaborg consists of 15 people
with backgrounds in physics, chemistry, engineering, and business. Seaborg’s main
field of expertise is neutronics. The team combines conventional simulation, model-
ing, and analysis tools used in particle, spallation, and reactor physics to derive new
results. With its own conceptual MSR design Seaborg uses its new software suite to
venture into uncharted territory, developing new experience and intellectual prop-
erty. Seaborg deploys their unique knowledge and tools through their design and
neutronics consultancy services; and they have delivered key neutronic results for
other MSR developers (see Chapter 24: Molten salt thermal wasteburner).

Since the ORNL experiments and projects on MSR, studies on this kind of reactor
were resumed in the 1980s in Japan with the Thorims-NES (Furukawa et al., 1990)
then the FUJI-AMSB projects (Furukawa et al., 2005), as well as in France with
studies on the MSBR by EDF and CEA at the same time. In the 1990s, the concept
647
Worldwide activities

was taken up again with a view to incinerating nuclear wastes in subcritical reactors
such as the TIER-1 project (Bowman, 1998), proposed by C. Bowman to transmute
the plutonium of pressurized water reactors, the CEA TASSE project (Berthou,
2000), and the EDF AMSTER project (Lecarpentier, 2001).
The French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) has been involved
in molten salt reactor studies since 1997. It re-evaluated the Oak-Ridge National
Laboratory Molten Salt Breeder Reactor project (Whatley et al., 1970) using a prob-
abilistic neutron code (MCNP) and an in-house evolution code for materials
(REM), both being coupled (Nuttin et al., 2005). To solve the issues of the MSBR
project (positive void coefficient, molten salt reprocessing, and graphite manage-
ment), an innovative concept called the molten salt fast reactor or MSFR (Merle-
Lucotte et al., 2008, 2009b, 2011, 2012, 2013; Mathieu et al., 2009; Brovchenko
et al., 2014a; Rouch et al., 2014; Allibert et al., 2015) has been proposed. This con-
cept results from extensive parametric studies in which various core arrangements,
reprocessing performances, and salt compositions were investigated with a view to
the deployment of a thorium-based reactor fleet on a worldwide scale. Systematic
studies of MSRs have been undertaken at LPSC/IN2P3/CNRS in Grenoble to
optimize an MSR in the framework of the deployment of a Gen IV concept, first
regarding neutronics and then including reactor physics, thermal hydraulics,
chemistry, materials, and safety. This led to the concept of an MSFR that has been
recognized as a long-term alternative to solid-fueled fast neutron systems with
unique potential (excellent safety coefficients, smaller fissile inventory, no need for
criticality reserve, simplified fuel cycle, etc.) and has thus been officially selected
for further studies by the Generation IV International Forum as of 2008 (GIF, 2008;
Renault et al., 2009; Boussier et al., 2012; Serp et al., 2014).
This research has been supported by several French interdisciplinary programs
involving
public
laboratories
(CNRS,
IRSN,
CEA)
and
private
companies
(AREVA: EDF): the former PACEN and present NEEDS national programs, as
well as local support in Grenoble (TSF from Carnot Energy Institute, CLEF from
Grenoble Institute of Technology), or direct industry support from Rhodia/Solvay
and AREVA (PhD theses) or material issues solved by Aubert&Duval.
Euratom provided important support by promoting international collaborations
on various aspects of MSRs. One can cite the following Euratom’s projects: MOST
(2001/2004),
ALISIA
(2007/2008),
EVOL
(2011/2013,
coupled
to
MARS
Rosatom’s project), SAMOFAR (2015/2019) as having significant contributions
from France.
Some aspects of fuel processing were studied by CNRS at IPNO (Delpech et al.,
2009) and LPSC showing that the impact of fuel processing on neutronics is low,
allowing parallel studies on chemical and neutronic issues (Doligez, 2010). Safety
studies led by CNRS have also been undertaken (Brovchenko, 2013; Brovchenko
et al., 2013, 2014b; Wang et al., 2014) in collaboration with IRSN and AREVA to
ascertain the high safety level of the concept and to find a suitable safety analysis
procedure for this new type of reactor (GIF methodology ISAM, and risk analysis)
in the frame of the EVOL then SAMOFAR projects (Chapter 20: Safety assessment
of the molten salt fast reactor (SAMOFAR)). A new approach of transient
648
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

calculations, coupling neutronics and thermal-hydraulics and based on the “transient
fission matrix” (TFM) innovative neutronic model has been achieved (Laureau,
2015; Laureau et al., 2015a). This showed the excellent capability of load following
of the MSFR in a very large power range and strong resilience of the reactor to per-
turbations (Laureau, 2015; Laureau et al., 2015b). Currently, a system code (plant
simulator) is under development at LPSC in the framework of the SAMOFAR
European project.
Regarding the first demonstration steps of the MSFR concept, an experimental
50-L salt loop called the FFFER project was built at LPSC using FLiNaK at 650C
flowing at about 1 m/s in a circuit with a centrifuge pump, a bubble injection sys-
tem, and a cyclone to separate bubbles from the salt. A cold plug valve and an
ultrasonic velocity measurement were also tested on this loop.

Molten salt reactors (MSRs) were studied during early phases of reactor develop-
ment in Germany. A fast neutron spectrum reactor concept without graphite in the
core, MOSEL, was proposed in Germany at Ju¨lich and studied in cooperation with
US partners (Kasten et al., 1965; Gat, 1967). The MOSEL reactor with a fast neu-
tron spectrum was developed primarily for the Th-U fuel cycle, with a fissile liquid
fuel for the core and a fertile one for the blanket. The core was fueled with uranium
fluoride dissolved in a carrier salt. The latter salt was a mixture of beryllium- and
alkali-metal-fluorides.
The core contained nickel-alloy structures, such as tubes or plates. Within these
structures the fuel was circulated primarily for the purposes of fuel mixing,
addition, and removal. The blanket fluid was thorium fluoride dissolved in the same
carrier salt.

In Kasten et al. (1965) the blanket fluid was also employed for cooling the core.
In Gat (1967) liquid lead was alternatively considered for cooling the MOSEL core;
the coolant was allowed to come into direct contact with the liquid fuel while pass-
ing through the core. This option was proposed to enhance heat transfer from the
fuel to the lead coolant and under assumption that the lead coolant is easily sepa-
rated from the fuel when it leaves the core.
In the 1970s and 1980s major nuclear activities in Germany were on alternatives
to MSR reactor types. Later, some interest in MSRs reappeared, in particular, due
to proposals to use these reactors for nuclear waste burning. These activities were
integrated in EURATOM FP projects, to which German Institutions contributed.
Different MSR systems were also studied with the participation of German institu-
tions within an IAEA project on options for nuclear waste incineration (Maschek
et al., 2009). In particular, safety-related reactor physics parameters, transmutation
potential, and transient behavior in different kinds of MSRs, including those with
fertile and without fertile components in the fuel, were evaluated for the latter
IAEA project. More recently, MSRs were considered as an option in the German
study on partitioning and transmutation (Renn, 2014).
Since early 2000, several EURATOM projects have been organized on MSR
studies, namely the MOST, ALISIA, EVOL, and SAMOFAR projects. The latter
project is running from 2015 to 2019. Major nuclear German institutions, in particu-
lar the Research Centers of Dresden-Rossendorf, Ju¨lich, and Karlsruhe, have been
involved in these EU projects. Only the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology is
currently contributing to the SAMOFAR project. The European Institute for
Transuranic Elements, actively contributing to all EU activities on MSRs, is also
located at Karlsruhe.
In Ju¨lich, the major effort in the past EURATOM projects was done on fuel
chemistry and reprocessing, while at Karlsruhe and Dresden, the activities were
mainly on the development and application of coupled fluid-dynamics and neutro-
nics models for simulating core behavior under nominal and transient conditions
and for fuel cycle analyses. Initially, both fluoride and chloride salts were consid-
ered, but soon the efforts were concentrated on fluorides in the MOST and the
following projects.
The initially studied systems in the MOST project contained graphite in the core
for neutron moderation, similar to the MSRE reactor. In these systems with a ther-
mal neutron spectrum, the fuel flows through graphite channels in the core.
Information on MSRE experiments was used to validate new computation
models developed for MSRs, including the effects of circulation of delayed neu-
tron precursors on transient core behavior and neutron balance. For later
EURATOM projects, including SAMOFAR, mainly fast neutron spectrum MSRs
were under investigation. The fast systems were introduced in order to improve
safety-related neutronics parameters, in particular reactivity coefficients, while
keeping the MSR breeding potential. The fast spectrum system systems are also
considered preferable for nuclear waste burning. The reason is that the probability
of fission—after a neutron interacts with a nucleus of transuranic fuel—is higher
at higher energies.

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

In Dresden a coupled code developed earlier for LWR reactor transient analyses,
DYN3D, was extended for MSR applications (Krepel et al., 2007). The neutron
transport solver in DYN3D is based on the diffusion approximation, initially devel-
oped for HEX-Z geometry and more recently extended to XYZ in space and to SP3
in angle approximation. The employed cross-section library contains cross-sections
for a reference set of reactor parameters, such as fuel temperature. These cross-
sections are computed in advance by a cell code and interpolated during the calcu-
lations. The fluid-dynamics part of the code for simulating fuel behavior in the core
is based on a multichannel approach and is well suited for thermal spectrum MSR
analyses: the fuel flow is essentially one dimensional in the graphite channels in the
core.
For the fast neutron spectrum cores without graphite, studies in Dresden were
mainly done on irradiation of structure materials surrounding the core (Merk et al.,
2014) and on the fast spectrum MSR potential for nuclear waste management.
For fast spectrum MSRs, studied in EVOL and SAMOFAR, the fluid pattern in
the reactor core can be rather complex because the core is essentially a large tank,
in which regions with stagnant flow may appear. Special design efforts were made
to exclude the possibility for formation of these reasons, in which the temperature
can be rather high. At Karlsruhe this was done by introducing a special flow distri-
bution plate below the core for flow profiling. A more recent approach proposed by
other EVOL partners was to modify the shape of the core/blanket boundary.
At KIT a safety code, SIMMER, was extended for MSR simulations in order to
support the MSR design and safety studies. This code was and is being developed
by JAEA of Japan, in cooperation with CEA of France, KIT of Germany, and other
partners, initially for analyses of severe accidents in sodium fast reactors (Tobita
et al., 2002). The code framework is rather general. It was extended in early 2000s
for accelerator-driven systems (ADSs) and other reactor types at KIT. For neutron
transport calculations, 2D RZ and 3D XYZ Sn method-based models are used in
SIMMER-III, 2D version, and SIMMER-IV, 3D version, respectively. The cross-
sections employed in neutron transport calculations are generated by the SIMMER
code while employing multigroup libraries with f-factors. The spatial kinetics
model is based on the quasistatic method. The neutronics part of the code was
extended first (Rineiski et al., 2005) and checked for an MSRE experimental model,
where the transient flow can be described in a rather simple manner. The effect of
neutron precursor movement was taken into account via an additional source-like
term. This integrally negative source-like term was introduced in the spatial and
point-kinetics parts of the code similarly to what was done earlier to take into
account the external neutron source in ADSs. Unlike ADSs, for which the reactivity
at nominal conditions is negative and the source term is positive, the reactivity at
nominal conditions for MSRs in SIMMER is positive, that is compensated by the
“negative” source-like term appeared due to decay of part of the delayed neutron
precursors outside of the core. The SIMMER fluid-dynamics part is based on a mul-
tiphase, multiple velocity field approach and includes models for phase transfers of
reactor materials, such as melting/freezing, vaporization/condensation, etc. Flexible
equations of states (EOSs) are used to describe the reactor material properties.
653
Worldwide activities

For making possible coupled neutronics and fluid-dynamics/thermal-hydraulics
MSR calculations with SIMMER in the general case, the fluid dynamics part was
extended further; in particular, a new turbulence model was introduced and new
EOSs for several fluoride salts were included in SIMMER at KIT (Wang et al.,
2006).
Due to a very general SIMMER code framework, its application takes a lot of
computing time. For transient MSR analyses, to which simplified calculation mod-
els are applicable, a faster running coupled code with a two-phase computational
fluid dynamics model is also being developed at KIT (Guo et al., 2016).
Recently a new MSR concept, a so-called dual-fluid reactor, was proposed by a
research group from Berlin, both for energy production and waste management.
The reactor employs a chloride salt as fuel that flows inside metallic structures,
which are cooled by liquid lead (http://dual-fluid-reaktor.de/; see also Chapter 24:
Molten salt thermal wasteburner). This activity is running in parallel to the above-
mentioned EU projects focusing on fluoride salts.

Introduction to the Indian MSR Program
India is pursuing the design of two molten salt reactors. The first is the Indian
Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (IMSBR), which is expected to be a self-sustaining
thorium-based molten salt-fueled reactor, attractive for the third stage of the Indian
nuclear power program. The other concept is the molten salt-cooled high-
temperature reactor, named the Innovative High Temperature Reactor (IHTR) with
nuclear hydrogen production by splitting water as the main objective. Both concepts
could be used for high-efficiency electricity generation. One of the important design
goals for IHTR is to achieve a maximum coolant temperature of 1273K and this is
based on a pebble bed fuel concept with molten salt as the coolant. R&D activities
for these reactors are being pursued in India and are covered briefly in this section.
26.8.2
Background to the Indian nuclear power program
and the relevance of MSBRs
India’s unique, sequential three-stage nuclear power program (http://dae.nic.in/
writereaddata/publ/saga/vol2/pdf2/Chapter-01.pdf) is aimed at the optimum utiliza-
tion of India’s nuclear resource profile of modest uranium and abundant thorium.
The three stages are natural uranium-fueled pressurized heavy water reactors
(PHWRs) in the first stage, plutonium-fueled fast breeder reactors (FBRs), includ-
ing metallic fueled ones, in the second stage, and 233U-fueled systems in the third
stage. The spent fuel of one stage is reprocessed to produce fuel for the next stage,
multiplying the energy potential of the fuel many-fold and at the same time reduc-
ing the quantity of waste. HTRs based on the 233U-Th cycle are also contemplated
during this stage for nuclear hydrogen production by splitting water. The closed
fuel cycle thus provides an ideal solution for satisfying the energy needs of a large
country like India in a sustainable manner, securing its energy freedom in the long
term. A schematic of the Indian three-stage nuclear power program is shown in
Fig. 26.8.1.
As mentioned earlier, the third stage of the Indian nuclear power program envi-
sages the use of thorium as a fertile material with 233U, which would be obtained
from the operation of 239Pu-Th-based fast reactors in the later part of the second
stage. A candidate reactor concept, which holds promise for this stage, is the molten
salt-fueled reactor, which has the potential to provide significant breeding ratios so
as to maintain long-term sustainability. India is carrying out fundamental studies so

as to arrive at a conceptual design of the IMSBR. Currently, various design options
and possibilities are being studied from the point of view of reactor physics and
thermal hydraulic design. In parallel, studies on salt preparation, salt characteriza-
tion, salt purification, thermal hydraulics, component and instrumentation develop-
ment, material development, and corrosion behavior of various molten salts are also
being carried out. The large-scale deployment of thorium-based reactors is likely to
take place in the second half of the 21st century, and it is planned to master all the
technologies much before large-scale deployment stage. The developed technolo-
gies would be demonstrated by setting-up prototype small power reactors with the
aim of optimizing the design for the larger reactors.
26.8.2.1
Molten salt breeder reactor program in India
India has one of the largest reserves of thorium in the world. The Atomic Minerals
Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMD), a constituent unit of Department
of Atomic Energy (DAE), India, has so far established 11.93 million tonnes of mon-
azite (thorium-bearing mineral) in India, which in situ contains about 1.07 million
tonnes of thorium oxide. In view of this, the third stage of the Indian nuclear power
program is based on extensive use of 233U-fueled reactors with thorium as the
fertile material. Efficient utilization of domestic thorium resources is one of the
primary aims of the third stage of the program. To maintain or expand the scale of
the program in the third stage in a sustainable manner, it is essential that the reactor
systems (i.e., the reactor and its associated fuel cycle facilities) should have a
breeding ratio of at least unity, after considering material losses. Hence the majority
of the reactor systems in the third stage, especially for electricity production, are
expected to be breeders operating on a 233U-Th fuel cycle.
While, it is possible to breed 233U from thorium in reactors of conventional
design (i.e., with solid fuel rod bundles), thorium, if used in conventional reactors,
suffers from one disadvantage. In the thorium fuel cycle, 233Pa is an intermediate

isotope in the nuclear reaction chain (Fig. 26.8.2), which results in conversion of
232Th to 233U. The conversion of 233Pa to 233U takes place by beta decay. However,
in a reactor core 233Pa is always subjected to the presence of fission neutrons,
which if absorbed, neither leads to the formation of 233U, nor to fission, and hence
is a parasitic loss. This is unavoidable in the case of solid-fueled reactors, since the
fuel pins need to be exposed to certain burnups before being extracted for reproces-
sing. This can be avoided if the fuel is in fluid form, so that the 233Pa is separated
out as soon as it is produced, and allowed to decay to 233U out of core. A feasible
way of doing this is the molten salt breeder reactor (MSBR). Therefore, the MSBR
is being considered as an attractive option for large-scale deployment during the
third stage of the Indian nuclear power program.
MSBR has fuel in the form of a continuously circulating molten salt, which
contains the fissile and fertile elements, besides other salts, as its constituents.
These are made to flow through heat exchangers, ultimately transferring the
high-temperature heat for power production. In order to generate electricity with
higher efficiency, R&D efforts have been initiated to develop supercritical
CO2-based Brayton cycle.
The critical configuration of the salt is achieved only when it enters the nuclear
reactor core. When the salt is moved out of the core, criticality is not achieved and
hence it does not undergo fission. Thus, if the salt is dumped into smaller dump
tanks, subcriticality is automatically achieved and thus the reactor is safely shut-
down. A crucial part for achieving reasonable breeding in such reactors is the need
to reprocess the salt continuously. Depending on the design, the reprocessing can
be configured to be in an online mode, or in an offline batch mode. In an online
mode, the reprocessing plant is located with the reactor and continuously repro-
cesses the fuel salt. On the other hand in an offline mode, the reprocessing is done
in a separate plant located nearby, with some portion of the fuel salt removed and
the reprocessed salt added to the primary circuit periodically.

Currently, studies for two conceptual designs of 850-MWe IMSBR (Dulera
et al., 2013; Vijayan et al., 2015) are being carried out. One concept is based on a
loop-type design and the other is based on a pool-type design. The major design
parameters for both concepts have been worked out. In order to develop and
demonstrate the involved technologies, before launching a large power reactor, it is
proposed to develop a small power (5 MWth) technology demonstration reactor. As
compared to other reactors, the use of fluid fuel allows for the removal of neutron-
absorbing products at regular intervals, allowing for efficient utilization of nuclear
materials. 233Pa removed is allowed to decay to 233U and re-introduced into the
reactor.
26.8.2.2
Conceptual design of the IMSBR
In order to arrive at the conceptual design of IMSBR, some of the design guidelines
which are being followed are as follows:
1. Self-sustaining in the 233U-Th cycle;
2. Minimization of fissile material inventory in the reactor;
3. Enhanced safety with inherent safety features as compared to current-generation reactors;
4. Avoiding the use of beryllium and beryllium-based salts to avoid chemical toxicity;
5. Minimization of waste generation and hence avoidance of the use of graphite;
6. Feasibility for inspection and replacement of components ensuring the long life of the
reactor.
A schematic of IMSBR is shown in Fig. 26.8.3. Two different concepts for the
850-MWe IMSBR have been investigated. For both concepts thermal efficiency is
aimed around 45%. The first design is a loop-in-tank concept, while the other is a
pool-type concept. Because of the need to avoid graphite and beryllium, the reactor
has been designed to operate primarily in the fast spectrum.

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

In the loop-in-tank concept (Basak et al., 2015), the reactor vessel and all the
highly active systems containing U, Th, fission products, and minor actinides are con-
tained within a nickel-lined safety vessel such that no active material leaves the safety
vessel. All potential active salt leakage scenarios are thus contained in the safety ves-
sel. Additionally, all major components are accessible for carrying out in-service
inspection (ISI). Such equipment would see only a gas environment. This arrange-
ment is expected to facilitate easy replacement of the blanket vessel, if required.
The schematic of the reactor is shown in Fig. 26.8.4 and the salient features are
listed in Table 26.8.1.
The pool-type concept (Borgohain et al., 2015) has the primary system contained
in a vessel to prevent any leakage of highly active fuel salts. Natural circulation-
based cooling of the reactor is found to be feasible, but need temperatures to be as
high as around 1000C. Forced circulation operation is possible at temperatures
around 800C. To mitigate the cost of a large vessel, a sacrificial frozen salt layer
has been considered. The major design parameters of two variations of the pool-
type concept are shown in Table 26.8.2. Schematics of the same are shown in
Fig. 26.8.5.
The loop-in-tank-type and pool-type concepts (natural circulation) have been
analyzed from the point of view of reactor physics design using a Monte Carlo
code. The initial results are briefly outlined in the following section. In the prelimi-
nary analyses, no effect of circulation of fuel salt and reprocessing has been consid-
ered. Computer codes for carrying out detailed analysis are under development.
26.8.2.3
Reactor physics design of IMSBR concepts
In order to achieve a higher breeding ratio (BR), a fast neutron spectrum has been
preferred for the above-mentioned concepts. The loop-type concept with forced cir-
culation (Srivastava et al., 2015b) was found to be a viable option for meeting the
criteria of relatively low initial fissile inventory (B3.2 t/GWe) and high initial BR
(B1.1). The effect of voiding in fuel in loop-type MSRs shows that the void reac-
tivity coefficient is negative at all voiding states, which become more negative at
higher voiding. Reactor physics feasibility analysis of the pool-type concept with
natural circulation, operating at a power of 850 MWe was also carried out as an
alternative design option which also operates in the fast neutron spectrum. The ini-
tial fissile inventory, however, was found to be higher (B5.4 t/GWe) compared to
the loop-type version for the same operating power, whereas the initial BR has
been found to be around 1.1. This is shown in Table 26.8.3. Neutron spectra for
loop- and pool-type concepts are shown in Figs. 26.8.6 and 26.8.7, respectively.
26.8.2.4
Key challenges for the design
Some of the major challenges for IMSBR, where R&D have been initiated include:
1. Development of closely coupled neutron transport and CFD codes with capability to
account for online reprocessing.

Research & development to meet the challenges
India is carrying out R&D in most of the major areas. Some of the prominent areas
are described in the following sections.
26.8.2.5.1
Chemistry of inactive salts and their characterization
Lithium fluoride (LiF) is one of the most important salts for MSBRs. It can be pre-
pared either by reacting LiOH with fluorine gas in a closed vessel or by neutraliza-
tion of LiOH with concentrated HF acid. In India the latter method is employed to
make LiF because of the ease of operation. First, the LiOH (3.6N) solution is puri-
fied for the removal of metal impurities by passing through a strong cation
exchange resin column. The purified LiOH solution is then neutralized using 20%
HF acid for the LiF production:
LiOH 1 HF ! LiF 1 H2O
ΔH0 5 257:35 kJ=mol
The wetted parts of the reactor are lined with Teflon. The reaction is carried out
in a well-ventilated plant with primary ventilation of gases being scrubbed before
they are discharged. pH is monitored to ensure that the solution is alkaline near the
end point of reaction. Once the neutralization is completed, the solution is filtered.
The residue is washed with distilled water 34 times to remove the hydroxide

impurities. The solid product formed is then dried in a vacuum oven. As high-
purity LiOH is used for the preparation of LiF, no further purification is carried out.
The product specification is given in Table 26.8.4.
26.8.2.5.2
Chemistry of active salts, their purification
and characterization
In India, uranium tetra-fluoride (UF4) is prepared by a gassolid reaction route
(Satpati et al., 2006) called the hydrofluorination method reacting nuclear pure
metal-grade uranium di-oxide (UO2) with anhydrous hydrofluoric acid (HF) at
450C in an inclined rotary tubular continuous reactor (Fig. 26.8.8). UF4, also
called green salt, is produced following a reversible exothermic reaction as:
UO2 1 4HF2UF4 1 2H2O
ΔH0 5 243:2 kcal
(26.8.1)
The produced salt is subjected to an expulsion operation (vacuum heating) to
remove adhered moisture and free acidity. Monitoring and controlling of critical
process parameters are important for obtaining metal-grade UF4. Specific design
and administrative control mechanisms are in place for the handling of highly cor-
rosive HF in both vapor and aqueous forms. Zero discharge of fluoride effluent has
been adopted in the process cycle. The quality of the produced UF4 is monitored
for each batch of operation. In general, particle size distribution and morphology of
the metal-grade salt is obtained as shown in Figs. 26.8.9 and 26.8.10, respectively.
The facility for salt purification is shown in Fig. 26.8.11. The metal-grade salt is
suitable for the production of uranium metal and other nuclear applications, such as
fuel for molten salt reactor, etc. The UF4 production process technology along with
effluent handing scheme and required safety measures are well established in the
Uranium Extraction Division (UED) of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC),
India. Fluorination of thorium oxide by ammonium bifluoride (Mishra et al., 2015)
has also been studied. Determination of eutectic composition and heat capacities of

fuel salt (LiF-ThF4-UF4) and blanket salt (LiF-ThF4) mixtures have also been car-
ried out (Mukherjee and Awasthi, 2015). R&D on the preparation of pure ThF4 and
LiF4, including development of equipment as well as estimation of solubility of
PuF3 in LiF4-BeF2-ThF4, was carried out in BARC (Fig. 26.8.12) during 1970s
(Sood et al., 1972) as part of a collaboration with ORNL.

Engineering facilities for thermal hydraulics
and corrosion studies
Currently, besides carrying out fundamental studies on various salts, the facility for
natural circulation-based thermal hydraulic studies called MAFL (molten active
fluoride salt loop), with an active blanket salt (using LiF-ThF4) has been designed,
manufactured, commissioned, and operated up to 700C to verify the thermal
hydraulics code (Srivastava et al., 2015a; Sarkar et al., 2015). This is a natural
circulation loop for thermal-hydraulic studies having a design pressure and

using OpenFOAM and stability calculations have been carried out using the
LeBENC code. This loop is shown in Fig. 26.8.13. A similar facility for fuel salt
(i.e., LiF-ThF4-UF4) is under fabrication.

26.8.2.5.4
Materials for molten salts
The development of structural materials with long-term compatibility with molten
fluoride salts at high temperatures and under a high radiation environment is essen-
tial for long-term operation of molten salt reactors. From a thermodynamics point
of view, nickel-based superalloys are the most suitable materials if moisture and
other impurities, like sulfides, are not present in the salt. Thermodynamic consid-
erations also dictate that the chromium content should be as low as possible.
Hastelloy-N and its variants have been proposed worldwide. This material is cov-
ered under ASME-Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code; Section VIII Division-1, for use
up to 750C. Significant data generation efforts have been envisaged to generate
the relevant data needed for design as per ASME-BPVC Section III Division-1
Subsection-NH for use in nuclear reactors at high temperatures. These include
long-term creep testing, creep testing under multiaxial loadings, creep fatigue tests,
statistical quantification of property variation, among others. Alternate alloys are
also being investigated. Expertise developed in India for ODS alloys (for fast reac-
tor fuel cladding) and Alloy 617M (for supercritical boilers) is expected to play a
significant role in the development of super alloys for use in IMSBR. Alloys
compatible with supercritical CO2 as well as molten salts are also being developed.
26.8.2.5.5
Reprocessing
The foremost objective of the reprocessing system for Indian MBSR is removal of
protactinium 91Pa233 and its subsequent decay to 92U233 (beta decay: 27 days half-
life) and reintroduction of 92U233 in fluoride form into reprocessed molten fuel salt.
The second objective is conventional removal of fission products and other nuclear
wastes. This would help in reducing the radio toxicity of waste and simultaneously
open the scope for separating and using some of the isotopes like Cs and Sr for
societal applications.
At the current stage, various technological options for reprocessing have been
evaluated and feasibility has been established. The rate of reprocessing would be
finalized, based on detailed reactor physics analysis. Since the current version of
the IMSBR designs being pursued in India is fast reactors, it is possible to adopt a
strategy for offline and batch mode reprocessing at intervals determined by reactor
physics design. Offline reprocessing is considered to be the more robust and safe
approach, as it decouples the reactor operation, and thus provides operational flexi-
bility to the reprocessing facility. The major steps and alternative methods in repro-
cessing are being studied, so as to arrive at the flow-sheet for the process. Some of
the methods being studied include Xe and Kr gas extraction by helium bubbling,
fluoride volatilization processes, reductive metal extraction, and electrochemical
processes.
Mass transfer-related studies and modeling for online helium bubbling are being
pursued. Trapping and fixing of fission product gases in a permanent matrix is chal-
lenging as it needs He in a closed loop, online stripping, fixing in permanent
matrix, its online management, active compressor, etc. For offline reprocessing of
668
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

the salt, the uranium and the elements with high gaseous oxidation states such as
Np, Pu for actinides and Nb, Ru, Te, I, Mo, Cr, and Tc for the fission products in
the salt are proposed to be removed by fluorination. Various technological options
to separate and recover the different elements are also being studied.
After the uranium and other high gaseous oxidation state elements are removed,
the fuel salt is proposed to be purified by reductive metal extraction processes.
Various technological options for this stage are also being studied. The actinides
(Pu, Pa, Am, Cm) could be extracted by reductive extraction in a liquid metal sol-
vent constituted of Bi with metallic thorium. The lanthanides can also be separated
by a reductive extraction in a liquid Bi pool containing metallic thorium as the
reductive reagent. In this case, the concentration of metallic thorium is kept higher
than the concentration used for the actinide extraction, in order to sufficiently lower
the potential to values which correspond to the reduction of the lanthanides dis-
solved in the molten salt. The back extraction of lanthanides from the Bi-Th bath is
done by anodic oxidation in LiCl-KCl chloride medium at 500C. A molten salt
based liquidliquid contactor operating in a hostile environment both with respect
to temperature and material is a major challenge, and India is working on develop-
ing an effective and reliable contactor. It is felt that the electrochemical method has
good potential to simplify the overall reprocessing scheme.
26.8.2.5.6
Equipment and sensors for molten salts
Operation of IMSBR will require continuous monitoring of the molten salt environ-
ment, property evaluation, and other mechanical equipments. In addition to the high
radiation environment, the molten salt provides a very aggressive media for the
sensors. Some of the areas in which R&D has been initiated are:
1. Online measurement of oxide and sulfide content in molten salts, so as to prevent local
criticality issues due to precipitation of oxyfluorides of uranium and thorium as well as
nickel superalloy corrosion issues.
2. Online measurement of redox potential and development of dynamic reference electrodes
for use in molten salt environments with thermal cycling resistance.
3. Instrumentation and sensors for high-temperature, molten halide salts, and high radiation:
a. Level sensors (e.g., ultrasonic, laser-based, conductivity-based, etc.)
b. Flow sensors (e.g., EM flowmeter, ultrasonic-based, etc.)
c. Pressure sensor (e.g., capacitance-based, Fabre-Perot-type, etc.)
d. Temperature sensors
4. Characterization techniques for thermophysical properties of molten salts:
a. Thermal conductivity (e.g., laser flash) (both solid and molten samples)
b. Viscosity: In-house development using novel techniques are being investigated
c. Vapor pressure and vapor phase composition, especially ensuring a vapor phase com-
position as close as possible to the liquid phase ensuring that the vapor condenses to a

order to carry out technology development for various technologies related to salts,
materials, components, power conversion systems, a molten salt breeder reactor
development facility (MSBRDF) has been planned at the new BARC campus in the
southern Indian city of Visakhapatnam. This is briefly explained in the next section.

Introduction to IHTR and its relevance
For India, a high-temperature reactor development program is significant mainly
for nonelectric applications. This requirement originated because of a need to
develop an alternate energy carrier to substitute for fossil fuel for transport applica-
tions. Hydrogen is considered an alternate energy carrier. High-efficiency hydrogen
production from water needs process heat at high temperatures or electricity, or
670
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

both, depending upon the process of hydrogen production selected. High-
temperature nuclear reactors have a large potential for sustainably supplying energy
for these hydrogen production processes at the required high-temperature condi-
tions. Although the development of relatively lower-temperature hydrogen produc-
tion processes (e.g., copper-chlorine process) as well as high-temperature processes
(e.g., sulfur-iodine process and high-temperature steam electrolysis) are being car-
ried out in India, the decision for a more challenging goal of development of tech-
nologies for reactor systems capable of producing process heat at 1273K was taken.
Therefore, under this program (Sinha et al., 2016) India is developing a small power
compact high-temperature reactor (CHTR), which is a lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE)-
cooled reactor, and a 600 MWth IHTR, both capable of producing process heat at
1273K. For the demonstration of IHTR technologies, a small power (20 MWth) ver-
sion would be initially set-up before deployment of large power reactors. Design
and R&D activities for IHTR are described in the following sections.
26.8.3.1
General description
BARC is carrying out the design of a 600 MWth reactor (Dulera and Sinha, 2008;
Vijayan et al., 2013) for commercial hydrogen production. This is a pebble bed-
based molten salt-cooled reactor. Pebbles consist of TRISO-coated particle fuel and
the coolant is driven through natural circulation. The IHTR reactor core is a long
right circular cylinder with annular core which consists of fuel pebbles and a molten
salt coolant. Fig. 26.8.14 shows a schematic of a 600 MWth Innovative HTR. There

are graphite neutron reflectors in the center and on the top, bottom, and outside of
this fuel annulus as shown in Fig. 26.8.15. Table 26.8.5 describes key characteris-
tics of IHTR-600 MWth (Dulera et al., 2009). Vertical bores in the central and outer
reflectors are provided for the reactivity control elements.
26.8.3.2
Reactor physics design and analysis
The IHTR-600 MWth has an elongated cylindrical core with an inner reflector of
2 m diameter followed by a 1.5 m wide reactor core and then another outer reflector
of 0.5 m. The core height is 8 m with 60% of the annular core volume filled with
pebbles and the remaining space occupied by the coolant. Reactor physics analysis
has been carried out with molten salt FLiBe. The IHTR annular core consists of
about 150,000 pebbles. The fuel pebbles consist of a fuel zone of 4.5 cm radius
with a protective layer of 0.5 cm. Each pebble consists of 46.7 g total heavy ele-
ment (233U 1 232Th) with 7.6% enrichment. Reactivity control and shutdown
devices are located in the inner and outer reflectors. A smaller pebble-bed demon-
stration reactor called IHTR-20 MWth is also in the design stage (Singh et al.,
2015b). This has a cylindrical region of 86.5 cm radius and 190 cm core height,
accommodating about 24,000 fuel pebbles and FLiBe as coolant. Each of these
6 cm diameter fuel pebbles consists of about 51,440 TRISO fuel particles, thus

with equilibrium fuel pebbles. The maximum attainable burn-up corresponding to
1200 FPD (Singh et al., 2015a) is found to be about 86,000 MWd/t.
Studies have been carried out to design fuel pebbles for this low-power IHTR
with maximum conversion of 232Th to 233U under the constraint of maintaining all
the reactivity coefficients as negative. Variation of conversion ratio and reactivity
coefficients with fuel depletion has also been studied.
26.8.3.3
Thermal hydraulic and material compatibility studies
A molten salt natural circulation loop (Srivastava et al., 2015), as shown in
Fig. 26.8.17, has been set up to carry out thermal hydraulic studies of molten salts.
Fig. 26.8.18 shows a comparison of analytical and experimental studies. In addition,
an experimental facility to study corrosion behavior (Keny et al., 2015) of FLiNaK
salt on the structural materials has also been set-up. Experiments on various materi-
als have been initiated. This is shown in Fig. 26.8.19.

exchangers.
2. Contamination of the hydrogen production system by radionuclides in primary coolant.
3. Diffusion of hydrogen from the secondary to primary side.
4. Embrittlement issues of material with hydrogen.
5. Safety against potential explosion of hydrogen.
Design options with intermediate heat-exchangers, getters for hydrogen and
tritium, providing coatings on tubes, and providing safe distance between nuclear
and hydrogen plant are being considered.
26.8.3.5
Future work
Future activities involve the development of pebble-based fuel, pebble feeding and
removal mechanism, thermal hydraulic studies for molten salts in pebble bed geom-
etry, development of large graphite components, high-efficiency power conversion
system, development of an intermediate heat exchanger, pump, instrumentation,
and other components for the molten salt environment, and development of hydro-
gen production technologies.
26.8.3.6
Fuel development
A typical IHTR fuel consists of fuel pebbles made of TRISO-coated particle fuels
with 233U-Th-based fuel. A schematic of a single pebble is shown in Fig. 26.8.20.

ral UO2 (Sathiyamoorthy et al., 2009; Aggarwal et al., 2013; Mollick et al., 2014).

Materials development
CHTR core internal materials comprise nuclear-grade high-purity materials. These
are high-density isotropic graphite (Dhami et al., 2006; Sinha and Dulera, 2010);
for reflector blocks. Other metallic structural materials are based on Ni-based super
alloys compatible to molten salt coolant and high temperatures. Graphite compo-
nents are coated with oxidation-resistant coatings (Chakravarthy et al., 2013; Sure
et al., 2015). These technologies have been successfully developed within BARC
and sister organizations, such as Nuclear Fuel Complex (NFC) and Indira Gandhi
Centre for Atomic Research (IGCAR).
26.8.3.8
Inherent safety features and passive heat removal
systems
IHTR is being designed to have many features that make it inherently safe. Some
of these features are: strong negative Doppler coefficient of the fuel, high thermal
inertia of the all-ceramic core and low core power density, very large thermal mar-
gin between operating temperature and boiling point of molten salt, chemical inert-
ness and negative reactivity effects of molten salt coolant, low-pressure natural
circulation of coolant, etc. In addition, passive systems for reactor heat removal
under normal and postulated accident conditions have been incorporated. This
includes natural circulation of molten salt for reactor heat removal, passive shut-
down systems, passive dissipation of decay heat, etc.
26.8.3.9
Key challenges for the design
The major challenges for the design, which are being met through sustained R&D
efforts within India, include coatings on TRISO-coated particle fuel and their charac-
terization, production of nuclear-grade high-density isotropic carbon-based materials
and component manufacture, development of molten salt resistant structural material
for high-temperature applications, oxidation-resistant coatings and their characteriza-
tion, development of components and instrumentation for service in intimate contact
with molten salt coolant at high temperatures, molten salt coolant technologies, etc.
26.8.4
R&D on high-efficiency power conversion system
High-efficiency supercritical CO2 Brayton cycle (SCBC)-based power conversion
systems are proposed to be used in many of the advanced reactors, including the
Indian High Temperature Reactor (IHTR), and IMSBR (Kaushik et al., 2015).
BARC has formulated a three-stage roadmap for the development of SCBC. The
first stage is the development of a kW range SCBC for use in solar power plants as
well as the CHTR. In the second stage it will be scaled up to MW range for appli-
cation in solar plants as well as the 5 MWth molten salt demonstration reactor,
under development, and the 20 MWth Demonstration IHTR. The third stage will be
677

a scale up to large-power IMSBR. The optimized process parameters for Brayton
cycle operating with 20 MWth IHTR and IMSBR are shown in Figs. 26.8.22 and
26.8.23, respectively. The cycle layout was modeled and analyzed to optimize the
process parameters and efficiency. The scoping studies were carried out as per the
parametric conditions, like compressor inlet pressure, pressure ratio, and turbine
inlet temperature. The properties of S-CO2 were taken by using different equation
of state models, namely LeeKeslerPlocker (LKP) and PengRobinson models.
As per the literature, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)

property database is very accurate. The NIST database was compared with the LKP
model and the properties were found to be coherent. Thus, for the current analysis,
the NIST database was used for the S-CO2 properties.
In parallel, technology development for critical components such as turbine,
compressor, compact heat exchanger, etc. have been initiated. This includes the
manufacture of miniature turbo-generator components and modules of a printed

were used for validation of the Nonlinear Stability Analysis Code (NOLSTA),
which is an in-house developed code to predict the flow stability of supercritical
fluids.
26.8.5
R&D on a high-efficiency hydrogen production
system
BARC
is developing
thermochemical processes (Prasad and
Dulera, 2009;
Shriniwas Rao et al., 2015) as well as high-temperature steam electrolysis for
hydrogen production by splitting water. The thermochemical processes use a
sequence of thermally driven chemical reactions in which water and heat are the
inputs, hydrogen and oxygen are the outputs, and the chemicals and reagents are
recycled in a closed cycle. Two promising thermochemical processes representing
high- and relatively lower-temperature regimes are the sulfur-iodine (SI) and
copper-chlorine (CuCl) processes. Presently R&D in BARC is focused on the
more challenging SI process. Other options will also be considered before a
large-scale deployment is planned so as to have an optimum mix of the technolo-
gies. The SI process is a three-step process involving formation (Bunsen reaction)
and decomposition of sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and hydriodic acid (HI). The decompo-
sition reactions, being endothermic, need external heat. Inputs to the process are
only water and heat and outputs are hydrogen and by-product oxygen. The process
is operated in a closed loop, and other chemicals used such as sulfur and iodine are
recycled back to the process. Apart from the feasibility of the process, efficiency,
stability of close loop operation, safety, suitable materials, catalysts, and integration
aspects with a HTR are the key challenges. BARC has carried out R&D on the
basic reactions, development of catalysts for H2SO4, and HI decomposition. It has
demonstrated a closed loop SI process using glass/quartz as material for equip-
ment and produced hydrogen at 30 L/h. India is the fifth country to achieve this
feat. A metallic system for high-pressure operation is being set up for individual
sections. In parallel, technologies for HTSE and other thermochemical process are
also being developed.

Summary
Efficient utilization of thorium is the cornerstone of the Indian nuclear program.
India has developed technologies for all the aspects of the thorium fuel cycle. An
advanced heavy water reactor is being developed as a technology demonstrator for
an industrial-scale thorium fuel cycle. India is also developing concepts of molten
salt cooled high-temperature reactors dedicated for high-efficiency nuclear hydro-
gen production. Large-scale deployment of MSBRs is envisaged during the third
stage of the Indian nuclear power program. Research and development have been
initiated to achieve designs with enhanced levels of safety. In the long term, molten
salt reactors offer sustainability to Indian energy needs.

Research activities on MSR in Indonesia are conducted by universities and by the
national agency for nuclear energy. The two main university MSR research groups
are:
1. Nuclear Physics and Biophysics Research Division, Department of Physics, Faculty of
Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB);
2. Nuclear Engineering Program, Department of Engineering Physics (UGM).
A group of faculty members at ITB has been interested in MSR since 2010,
especially the FUJI designs: FUJI-12, miniFUJI, FUJI-U1, and FUJI-U3 (Waris
et al., 2010, 2012a, 2013, 2015; Aji andWaris, 2014; Aji et al., 2015). At first they
were mainly focused on high-level nuclear waste (especially plutonium and minor
actinides) utilization in MSR. However, they are now studying the safety aspects of
MSRs. The FUJI designs are based on the ORNL MSBR design with several
improvements. The staff at UGM is mostly concentrated on the fuel cycle and
safety aspects of passive, compact molten salt reactors (PCMSRs) (Harto, 2015).
The National Nuclear Energy Regulatory Agency of Indonesia (BAPETEN) is
preparing the National Regulation on Technology and Safety Aspects of MSR.

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

Regarding the thorium fuel cycle in solid fuel nuclear reactors, the group from
ITB started research in 2007 (Waris et al., 2014, 2016; Subkhi et al., 2012, 2013,
2014, 2015, 2016; Trianti et al., 2015; Ariani et al., 2012; Permana et al., 2009a,
2009b, 2010, 2011; Ismail et al., 2009; Sidik et al., 2008a, 2008b; Waris, 2008;
Waris et al., 2007a, 2007b, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012b). The National Nuclear
Energy Agency (BATAN) operates a research center for uranium and thorium
extraction from uraniumthorium-bearing minerals.

R&D activities at Polito
The research group at Politecnico di Torino has been involved in all the
EURATOM-supported Projects on MSRs (IABAT, MOST, ALISIA, EVOL) and in
an IAEA Coordinated Research Project on transmutation (Maschek et al., 2008),
which also considered such systems. The R&D activities were focused on basic
reactor physics to handle the molten salt system specificities, with particular regard
to the moving fuel feature (Lapenta and Ravetto, 2000). Delayed neutron precursors
are also in motion, leading to a reduction of the importance of emitted neutrons.
Moreover, some neutrons are emitted outside the core, thus they are unable to take
part in the chain reaction. These phenomena lead to a reduction of the effectiveness
of the delayed emissions. In this regard, criticality and time-dependent analyses
were carried out by the Polito research group in a benchmark of dynamic simulation
tools for molten salt reactors (Delpech et al., 2003), and taking into account also
the interaction of thermal-hydraulics with neutronics (Dulla and Ravetto, 2007;
Nicolino et al., 2008). Kinetic methods were extended to the specific circulating
fuel configuration (e.g., adapting the DYNAMOSS code) (Dulla et al., 2008),
some
issues
related
to

perturbations

R&D activities at Polimi
The research group at Politecnico di Milano has been involved in the modeling and
analysis of both thermal and fast-neutron spectrum MSR concepts, in the context of
several collaborations with other research institutions (e.g., TU-Delft, PSI, CNRS-
Grenoble, KIT, Westinghouse Electric Co., VTT Technical Research Centre of
Finland). In both thermal and fast liquid-fueled MSRs, the molten salt simulta-
neously acts as fuel and coolant. This leads to a complex environment characterized
by peculiar features, in comparison with solid-fueled reactors, i.e., the mentioned
drift of delayed neutron precursors and the internal heat generation in a fluid. These
aspects notably affect the system dynamic behavior and require dedicated tools
(Luzzi et al., 2012a) to allow for the intrinsic coupling between neutronics and
685
Worldwide activities

thermal fluid dynamics. Hereinafter, the main R&D activities carried out by the
Polimi group are summarized.
In order to evaluate the effects of the fuel circulation on the system kinetics,
simplified models (Cammi et al., 2011a) were preliminarily set up to allow for the
decay of delayed neutron precursors in the out-of-core part of the primary circuit,
and assessed against the experimental data available for the MSRE (Molten Salt
Reactor Experiment). Later, analytic, deterministic, and Monte Carlo approaches
(Aufiero et al., 2014a) were developed for calculating the effective delayed
neutron fraction in the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR), which is the European
fast reactor concept studied in the framework of both the EURATOM EVOL (http://
cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/97054_en.html; http://cordis.europa.eu/result/rcn/159411_
en.html) and SAMOFAR (http://samofar.eu/) projects. As concerns the analysis of
MSR dynamics, different numerical models were conceived for studying the core
and system (primary/secondary circuits) behavior of thermal-neutron spectrum MSRs,
based on lumped and one-dimensional approaches. In this framework, the approxima-
tions related to the adoption of simplified geometries were also investigated (Cammi
et al., 2012). These models were adopted for stability analyses concerning both ther-
mal and fast MSRs (Guerrieri et al., 2013), and for a preliminary control-oriented
analysis focused on the MSFR (Guerrieri et al., 2014). As a further development in
the direction of more accurate dynamic analyses, a multiphysics modeling (MPM)
approach (Cammi et al., 2011b; Luzzi et al., 2012a) was developed to better repro-
duce the intrinsic coupling between neutronics and thermal-hydraulics. The adoption
of this approach to the study of graphite-moderated MSRs allowed a preliminary
assessment of the developed models on the basis of international benchmarks avail-
able for both the MSBR (Molten Salt Breeder Reactor) and the MSRE (e.g., in the
framework of the MOST project), pointing out the main advantages offered by the
multiphysics approach in comparison with the models available in literature for the
MSRs. The MPM approach was also adopted for the MSFR transient analysis
(Aufiero et al., 2014b; Fiorina et al., 2014b).
More recently, a geometric multiscale modeling strategy (Zanetti et al., 2015)
for the analysis of MSR “plant dynamics” was developed at Polimi. It consists in
the optimization of the MPM through the coupling between a multiphysics code
(addressing the core modeling with a 3-D PDE-based approach) and a computa-
tional environment that adopts simplified 0-D ODE-based models for handling the
boundary conditions and simulating the remaining part of the system (e.g., the
cooling loop) with a different level of detail. The aim is to conjugate the accuracy
of the MPM approach with acceptable computing power in order to analyze the
overall plant dynamics.
With reference to the MSFR, the research group at Polimi also developed an
extended version of the SERPENT-2 code to study fuel burn-up and core material
evolution (Aufiero et al., 2013), and carried out an investigation into the fuel
cycle and the long-term core physics performance (in terms of possible initial
core loading, actinide burning capabilities, radio-toxicity generation, decay heat,
and safety features), that also included a systematic comparison with solid-fueled
fast reactors (Fiorina et al., 2013). This R&D activity was also the subject of the
686
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

IAEA CRP “Near Term and Promising Long Term Options for Deployment of
Thorium Based Nuclear Energy,” (https://www.iaea.org/OurWork/ST/NE/NEFW/
Technical-Areas/NFC/advanced-fuel-cycles-crp-thorium-2011.html),
to
which
Polimi participated.
The thermal-hydraulic behavior of internally heated molten salts flowing in
straight circular channels was analyzed using both analytic and numerical tools
(Luzzi et al., 2012a, 2012b), with application to graphite-moderated MSRs and to
the MSFR as well (see also Chapter 6: Thermal hydraulics of liquid-fueled MSRs).
In
this
framework,
a
preliminary
heat
transfer
correlation
was
proposed
(Fiorina et al., 2014a). In particular, it has been shown that the effect of internal
heat generation can be described by means of a corrective factor to be applied to
traditional correlations (e.g., the DittusBoelter or Gnielinski correlations) for the
Nusselt number. The corrective factor has been demonstrated to be lower than 1 in
the case of inward wall heat flux, thus implying an overestimation of the heat
transfer coefficient in the case that traditional correlations were used. In the case of
outward wall heat flux, the correction factor is instead generally higher than 1.
Finally, the developed correlation has been used to carry out a parametric investi-
gation of the effect of decay heat on the out-of-core components of the MSFR.
The volumetric power determines higher temperatures at the channel wall, but
the effect is significant only in the case of large diameters and/or low velocities.
This might be the case for the channels of the salt reprocessing system (Fiorina
et al., 2014a).
As for the natural circulation dynamics with internal heat generation, linear and
nonlinear analysis methods were developed to investigate the natural circulation
features of internally heated fluids for MSR applications (Pini et al., 2014, 2016;
Ruiz et al., 2015; Cammi et al., 2016b). These methods have constituted the basis
for the design of a testing facility (DYNASTY), which is under construction at
Polimi (Cammi et al., 2016a). DYNASTY will be aimed at: (1) the experimental
investigation of the natural circulation dynamics in the presence of distributed heat
generation, with a specific focus on the analysis of thermal-hydraulic instabilities
(stability maps); (2) the experimental validation of the theoretical models and simu-
lation tools developed to study the natural circulation capability of a loop with a
homogeneously heated molten salt, useful for design optimization of the MSFR pri-
mary circuit. In Chapter 6, Thermal hydraulics of liquid-fueled MSRs (Section 6.4),
the influence of the volumetric heat generation on the stability features of natural
circulation is briefly presented, with reference to the stability maps of single-phase
rectangular loops.

Based on the long and wide development of ORNL from the 1950s to the 1970s,
Kazuo Furukawa and his group in Japan have been investigating graphite moder-
ated MSR “FUJI” and related accelerator technology since the 1980s until the pres-
ent day (Furukawa et al., 2008; Yoshioka, 2013). FUJI is mostly based on the
MSBR design, with some improvements. His group has provided wide design
results, such as detailed design results of FUJI-U3 for self-sustaining, FUJI-Pu for
Pu start-up, transmutation capability of minor actinides, super-FUJI of 1000 MWe,
and a pilot plant mini-FUJI, which are described in Chapter 11, Liquid fuel, thermal
neutron spectrum reactors. In order to promote MSR development, Furukawa and
his group established the International Thorium Molten-Salt Forum (ITMSF)
(2008), and the Thorium Tech Solution Inc. (TTS) (2010).
ITMSF is a nonprofit organization, which is composed of researchers and engi-
neers from 14 countries who are involved or interested in MSR and related thorium
cycles. Until 2016, 20 seminars had been held in Japan (Japan Atomic Energy
Committee) and in 2015, executives from China and the Czech Republic gave lec-
tures on their MSR developments. The Japan Atomic Energy Committee (JAEC)
issued a formal opinion paper in 2012, which mentioned candidates for future
689
Worldwide activities

nuclear applications, including thorium utilization. ITMSF proposed its MSR to the
JAEC in 2013 (Yoshioka and Kinoshita, 2013). ITMSF has been an observer mem-
ber of the MSR group of the GIF (the Generation IV International Forum) since it
started in 2005, and has participated in the discussions in recent years (Serp et al.,
2014).
Under the Atomic Energy Society of Japan, a special committee was started as
“Nuclear Application of Molten Salt.” In this committee, experts, including several
ITMSF members, discuss MSR, dry-reprocessing, fusion application, and so on. A
working group within this committee is participating in the ANS20.1 committee,
where the general design criteria (GDC) for the FHR (fluoride salt-cooled high-
temperature reactor) are discussed (ANS 20.1 Working Group, 2014). Based on the
discussions in the ANS20.1 committee, the GDC for the MSR is proposed in
Chapter 11, Liquid fuel, thermal neutron spectrum reactors.
Meanwhile, TTS’s final target is the commercialization of FUJI, which is based
on developments including ITMSF. TTS is now working on molten salt technology
in test reactors, such as the Halden Reactor in Norway. Irradiation experimentation
will proceed in the near future.
Kyoto Neutronics is designing a small thorium MSR integrated with heat
exchangers, named UNOMI (Universally Operable Molten-salt reactor Integrated)
(Kamei, 2013).
The following are the basic studies related to MSR at Japanese universities or
research laboratories.
1. Volatile FP release experiment in molten salts which is related to the MSR source term
issue, at the University of Fukui (Yamawaki et al., 2015).
2. Corrosion study of Hastelloy N in molten salt, at the University of Fukui (Fukumoto
et al., 2015).
3. Molten salt chemistry for nuclear systems, at the University of Tokyo (Terai et al., 2001).
4. Dry-reprocessing utilizing molten salt, at the Central Research Institute of Electric Power
Industry (CRIEPI) (Koyama et al., 2012).
5. FLiNaK-loop experiment for fusion technology, at the National Institute for Fusion
Science (NIFS) (Sagara et al., 2015).
In Japan, we will also continue our studies and activities, cooperating with
worldwide researches and promoters, in the future.

Deokjung Lee and Yongjin Jeong
Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, Ulsan, Republic of Korea
In Korea, Se Kee Oh and his group at Ajou University performed MSR research
actively from 1998 to 2008, and UNIST (Ulsan National Institute of Science and
Technology) started MSR research in 2002. Work on basic research has continued
up to the present day.
Ajou University first set up a computer code system for MSR analysis, which
consists of HELIOS (1998), AMDEC, and AMBIKIN2D (Lee, 2008; Lee and Oh,
2008). HELIOS is a commercially available code from Studsvik Scandpower Inc.,
and AMDEC and AMBIKIN2D are inhouse codes developed at Ajou University
specifically for MSR analyses. HELIOS solves two-dimensional neutron/gamma
transport problems and generates lattice parameters for the downstream diffusion
calculations by AMBIKIN2D. AMBIKIN2D is a two-group, two-dimensional
neutron kinetics code for MSR transient analysis, taking into account the flowing
fuel-induced neutronics effects such as the reduction of effective delayed neutron
fractions caused by the liquid fuel loop circulating through the outside loop of the
core. It solves the R-Z time-dependent diffusion problems and calculates eigenva-
lues, fluxes, power shapes, and reaction rates of the core. AMDEC performs the
fuel depletion calculations in multiregion fluid-fuel loop systems with continuous
feeding and reconditioning processes. HELIOS provides AMDEC with spectrum
weighted one-group cross-section sets, and AMDEC provides HELIOS with
691
Worldwide activities

updated nuclide number densities. HELIOS also provides the AMBIKIN2D code
with two-group macroscopic cross-section data. The code system was used for the
design and analysis of Ajou University’s unique MSR design, AMBIDEXTER.

designed
AMBIDEXTER-NEC
(Advanced
Molten-salt
Break-even Inherently-safe Dual-function EXcellenTly-Ecological Reactor Nuclear
Energy Complex), which encompasses a reactor core, primary pump, heat
exchanger, power generator, chemical processing units, etc. (Oh et al., 1998, 2000a,
2000b, 2001, 2002). The design objective of the reactor is to burn DUPIC fuel
(Ham et al., 2007; Oh et al., 2007) and to minimize minor actinide production while
generating electric power. To achieve the objectives, the AMBIDEXTER reactor
core consists of two parts: a blanket region and a seed region. The blanket region
consists of only molten salt fuel (LiF-BeF2-(Th,U,Pu)F4) and the seed region con-
sists of the molten salt fuel and graphite moderator channel. The blanket region has
a very hard neutron spectrum like a fast reactor, and the seed region has a soft neu-
tron spectrum like a pressurized water reactor (PWR). The seed region mainly burns
molten-salt fuel, and the blanket region mainly burns minor actinides because of
the neutron spectrum characteristics of each region. AMBIDEXTER was designed
as a burner reactor which has a low conversion ratio, 0.298. Unfortunately, when
Prof. Oh retired from Ajou University, the MSR research in Korea stopped until
2012, when UNIST started MSR research.
Deokjung Lee and his group at UNIST have been developing a code system for
the simulation of online reprocessing and refueling, and depletion of a molten salt
breeder reactor (MSBR) (Robertson, 1971). The MSBR was designed by ORNL
(Oak Ridge National Laboratory) in the 1970s. The MSBR adopts molten-salt as a
liquid fuel as well as coolant, and graphite material as a neutron moderator and
reflector. The reactor core of the MSBR is divided into two zones with different
fuel-to-graphite ratios. Zone-1 has a low fuel-to-graphite ratio and most fission
reactions occur here, while zone-2 has a high fuel-to-graphite ratio and most breed-
ing occurs here. UNIST investigated three different equilibrium composition search
approaches for the MSBR using the nuclear reactor core analysis computer code
system based on the MCNP6 Monte-Carlo code. (1) The first search method uses a
representative average single unit cell for both zones. The single unit cell model
uses volume-weighted average fuel and moderator compositions and sizes (Jeong
et al., 2014a, 2014b, 2015a). (2) The second method uses two representative unit
cells, one for each zone, which preserves the fuel-to-moderator ratio of each zone
(Jeong et al., 2015a, 2015b). (3) The third method directly models the whole
MSBR core. The code system was set up with the MCNP6 Monte-Carlo code, its
depletion module CINDER90, and the Python scripting language (Park et al.,
2015ac). Python is used for implementing batchwise reprocessing and refueling.
In the process of calculating the equilibrium fuel compositions, various parameters
like the multiplication factor, breeding ratio, and number density can be obtained to
analyze the MSBR. The MSBR whole core analysis is performed at the initial and
equilibrium core conditions, for various reactor design parameters such as normal-
ized neutron flux distribution, temperature coefficients, rod worth, and power distri-
butions. The neutronics core characteristics were analyzed using the four-factor
692
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

formula applied to the single-cell model, two-cell model, and the two zones of the
whole core, separately.
UNIST plans to develop a new high-fidelity code system for MSR analysis
including online reprocessing and refueling, and the modeling capability of the
movement of liquid fuel and the delayed neutron precursors. Furthermore, it is plan-
ning to develop a new MSR core concept using the developed code system.

Jan L. Kloosterman
Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands
The Netherlands has a long tradition with homogeneous nuclear reactors, starting
with the vision of Jan Went, the first professor of nuclear reactor physics at TU
Delft and director at the KEMA research center in Arnhem, to develop a homoge-
neous reactor in Europe (Andriesse, 2000). In 1957, the KEMA opened a new
nuclear laboratory for the development of the KEMA Suspension Test Reactor
(KSTR); a reactor with small uraniumthoriumoxide fuel particles in a water
flow pumped through the primary circuit. The particles were made by a newly
developed sol-gel process that laid the foundation for the later manufacturing of the
HTR TRISO particles in Germany (Kistemaker et al., 1988). They had a diameter
of less than 10 μm, allowing the fission products to escape from the particles and to
dissolve in the water coolant. By continuously (re)fueling and cleaning the coolant,
a long-term uninterrupted operation was envisaged. At first instance the focus was
on a zero power reactor which operated from 1957 till 1967. The construction of
the 1 MW reactor started in 1963 and took 9 years to finish. In 1974, after having
solved some unexpected issues with flow instabilities, the reactor became critical.
Unfortunately, cracking and clustering of fuel particles and unexpected wear at the
primary pumps caused the reactor to shut down in 1977. Meanwhile, another fac-
ulty member of TU Delft, Prof. D.G.H. Latzko worked in the 1960s on the use of
molten salts as heat transfer fluids for power generation, resulting in the thesis by
Dr. B. Vriesema (1969).
The interest in homogeneous reactors revived at TU Delft at the beginning of the
21st century as part of a research program on Generation-IV reactors. It was real-
ized that breeding of new fuel and complete destruction of long-lived actinides
could best be realized in a homogeneous reactor. Research on the thermal molten
salt reactor started around 2005 and was focused on the thorough understanding of
the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) behavior (Kophazi et al., 2009), and
on improving the thermal molten salt breeder reactor (MSBR) design originally
developed in the US (Nagy, 2012). Various alternatives were investigated among
694
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

which were one-fluid, one-and-a-half fluid, and two-fluid reactor core designs. In
addition, the chemical and physical properties of various fuel salts were studied,
in close collaboration with the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre in
Karlsruhe (Capelli, 2016). Although the thermal MSR design clearly has a lot of
potential to be explored and developed, research at TU Delft now focuses on the
molten salt fast reactor (MSFR) design originally proposed by CNRS and adopted
as the reference design for Generation-IV, which culminated in the SAMOFAR
project within the HORIZON2020 European framework program (201420). The
SAMOFAR project is described in Chapter 20, Safety assessment of the molten salt
fast reactor (SAMOFAR).
In the framework of the government-supported research into CO2-free energy
supply, the Dutch NRG research and consultancy organization in cooperation with
JRC-Karlsruhe is preparing an irradiation of samples of fissile and fertile material
containing fluoride fuel salt in corrosion-resistant graphite crucibles to determine
the stability of the fission products in the fuel salt during irradiation. The irradia-
tions will take place in the Petten High Flux Reactor with a total neutron flux of
around 1015 cm22 s21. Two campaigns with different irradiation times ranging up
to 1 year will be carried out, during which the samples will be held at a constant
temperature well above the melting point. The postirradiation experiments will be
carried out at both NRG and JRC-Karlsruhe, and will include a detailed evalua-
tion of the fission gas composition and distribution, as well as determination of
the temperature above which the fission products become volatile. In parallel,
cooperation between NRG and TU Delft will support the molten salt irradiation
experiments by studying helium bubbling and fission product behavior. The irra-
diations are expected to start in 2016, and are part of a multiyear nuclear R&D
program.

Thorium discovery in Norway
The element thorium (Th) was actually discovered in Norway in 1828. At that
time Norway was in a union with Sweden after having been part of Denmark for
some 400 years. Norway in the 19th century experienced a blossoming of science,
literature, and Arctic discoveries that paved the way for full independence in
1905.
The mineral “thoritt” was discovered by Hans Morten Thrane Esmark on the
tiny island of Løvøy in Telemark. He was the son of the geology assessor Jens
Esmark at Kongsberg, where silver had been mined for centuries. Even though
Hans had a passion for minerals he chose to become a priest and was sent to
Brevik in Telemark. His duties in the parish meant crisscrossing circuits in the
fjord archipelagos. The brown mineral “thoritt” was sent to his chemist friend
Jo¨ns Jakob Berzelius in Stockholm which was the intellectual capital of the union
of kingdoms.
Berzelius undertook the then state-of-the-art examinations and concluded that
“thoritt” had to be a newly discovered mineral and that it also contained a new
element. Berzelius had long dreamt of naming a new element after the Norse God
of Thunder, Thor; apparently the priest did not protest to its naming after a pagan
god.
26.14.2
“Thorium fever”
Th has special geochemical properties and as a result Th minerals have ended up in
pegmatites, a kind of geological dustbin from melting processes in the inner Earth.
“Thoritt” nuggets the size of walnuts can be found along the fjordline of Telemark.
From the 1880s a “klondyke” set in and the entire world production came from
only this area. Th was sold for several hundred crowns per kilo, a fortune at the
time, for use as glowing mantles in Auer lamps. People fought over claims but the
bonanza came to a stop when Th was able to be extracted easily using spades and
picks in the US, Brazil, and India before the turn of the century. Electric lights soon
outcompeted the lamps and “Thoritt” chunks will probably never be of commercial
interest again.

26.14.3
Telemark geology
Th has been identified at several locations in Telemark but Fen is the main area.
Fen is a very unique formation; 600 million years old it seems to have been a plug
sprung open during the creation of the Oslofjord, spewing up exotic minerals from
deep down. Its twin is the Tanzanian volcano Ol Doinyo Lengai. “Thoritt” ThSO4
is not the main mineral. “Rauhaugkitt” and “ankeritt” contain iron and carbonates.
ThO2 crystals are finely dissolved in the hard rock at concentrations of 0.2%
0.4%. Mining and refining are deemed too costly compared to monazite. However
europium, cerium, neodymium, lanthanum and other rare Earth elements at around
1% could make profitable value chains in the current marketplace.
26.14.4
Commercial interest
The Germans initiated mining for niobium during the Second World War. The
operation was closed down in 1965.
Helicopter gamma surveys were carried out in 2006 but Th reserves are hard to
predict since gammas do not penetrate from that far down. Historically the estimate
has been 170,000 tons Th, but the exact origin of this estimate cannot be pinned
down. Some prospectors claim much higher quantities as well as higher local
concentrations in smaller ores. A drilling campaign would cost in the hundreds of
millions USD.
Th from Fen needs to be highly automated since radiation and radon levels are
high. Tailings will be voluminous given low concentrations, and acidic waste after
separations will need a repository sealed off from the drinking water supplies of the
region.
26.14.5
Governmental investigation 2008
Heavy water production in Norway became globally known due to the commando
raid during the Second World War and the subsequent Hollywood films. It is no
secret that Norwegian heavy water was smuggled to Israel and to other nations as
well. The revelations caused exports to stop in 1988.
Norway built a 25-MWth heavy-water boiler in Halden, Østfold in the 1950s.
The test reactor is part the OECD framework on nuclear energy and has specialized
in fuel characterization and irradiation testing. Norway also houses a smaller instal-
lation for the production of medical isotopes at Kjeller, north of the capital Oslo.
The reactors were recently licensed until the end of 2020.
Prior to the Norwegian oil boom taking off in the 1980s a governmental commit-
tee recommended 12 reactors as a response to the oil crisis of the 1970s. The debate
was more relevant in Sweden where 24 reactors were proposed and 12 were built.

Out of the blue came a photo in late 2006 of CERN’s Carlo Rubbia posing with
the leaders of the Progress Party. This liberal-conservative movement had become a
force that no longer could be ignored by the traditional leftright split. The photo
was widely circulated in the press and sparked off a dynamic that led to the
Minister of Energy’s request for an international assessment on the thorium
resource.
26.14.6
Thorium report
The mandate of the Thorium Report of February 2008 was: “The Committee’s
work and the resulting Report shall establish a solid knowledge base concerning
both opportunities and risks related to the use of thorium for long-term energy pro-
duction. The work should be conducted as a study of the opportunities and possibil-
ities (screening), based on a review of Norway’s thorium resources and the status of
key technologies.” The Chairman was Mikko Kara, former CEO of Finnish VTT, a
governmental R&D organization.
CERN had advocated the accelerator-driven system (ADS) to the French for
over a decade without success. The company Thor Energy AS published press
releases about building a Norwegian thorium reactor in cooperation with Atomic
Energy of Canada Limited AECL. The report gained considerable interest from
diverse concerned actors including energy companies and environmental lobby
groups. Opinion polls showed that a large majority of citizens was favorable to the
prospect of “clean” nuclear thorium energy from Norway as opposed to “dirty” ura-
nium from abroad. The public opinion is still positive since the green lobby has lost
its hegemony. The molten salt option received little attention and was authored by
the French CNRS. However, the debate soon lost traction. In 2009 Sverre Hval
with the Kjeller reactor penned a proposal to the National Research Council for a
Norwegian molten salt R&D initiative that was dead on arrival.
26.14.7
Recent events
Then,
in
2012,
another
report
was
taken
by
a
collaborative
foundation
“Oslofjordfondet,” a sign that the prospect still lingered among some academics at
regional universities; powerful energy companies do not participate in the dis-
cussion of thorium. A small startup, 232 Thorwards AS, advocating molten
salts met with the Conservative Party in 2009. Since 2013 Norway has had a
ConservativeProgress Party coalition minority government that has a national
“thorium R&D center” in the works but nothing has crystallized as of the time of
this writing; crucial parliamentary support is needed from parties in the center of
the political spectrum.
In hindsight, confusion reigned on comparative safety, resistance to proliferation,
and waste footprints. ADS proponents and Thor Energy AS proclaimed vast
698

improvements that were easily questioned by the green groups simply by referring
to the historical record of thorium rods. It was also acknowledged that Telemark
Thorium would not be competitive. Clear guidance on the important issues was not
provided by the very small number of senior nuclear experts within the reactor
staffs.
The political climate is improving under the new government. The country is
eagerly debating what is to follow the oil era initiated in the 1980s. Politicians are
looking for a new industry that can shoulder a national strategy when petroleum
revenues decline. In the tradition of the Norwegian consensus culture Thor Energy
AS invited all thorium proponents to sign a petition to the Minister of Energy for
their rod technology in late 2013, but molten salt advocates from Thorium
Electronuclear AB did not concede to the roll call. Thorium Electronucear AB
advocates a denatured molten salt reactor (DMSR) commercial pilot.
Norway is particularly well positioned to launch a relevant initiative for molten
salt reactors. The safety culture in the world leading oil industry, subsea heavy duty
robotics, niche shipyards, high temperature aluminum ovens, and the Halden fuel
irradiation facility, unique in northern Europe, all harbor key competences.
26.14.8
IThEO started in Sweden
Andreas Norlin in Stockholm, Sweden, initiated the International Thorium Energy
Organization in 2009. With support from the UN Business Council yearly confer-
ences have been organized in different regions of the world. IThEO advocates tho-
rium energy in general and can be seen as a counterpart to John Kutch’s Thorium
Energy Alliance in the US.
26.14.9
Irradiation experiments at Halden R&D reactor
26.14.9.1
Th rods
In April 2013 the technical weekly “Teknisk Ukeblad” reported that Thor Energy
had inserted thorium rods in the flux of the Halden test reactor.
Thor Energy explains: “Thor Energy undertook to explore the operation of
U-233/thorium oxide fuel in a Gen III1 reduced-moderation BWR (RBWR). This
reactor platform should be well suited for achieving high U-233 conversion factors
due to its epithermal neutron spectrum. It was designed by Hitachi Ltd and JAEA
as a platform for flexible uraniumplutonium fuels in which high conversion or
actinide destruction can be achieved. It is based on the ABWR architecture but has
a shorter, flatter pancake-shaped core and a tight lattice to ensure sufficient fast
neutron leakage and a negative void reactivity coefficient. The study undertaken by
Thor Energy aimed to shed light on the characteristics of uranium that is
699

multi-recycled in a RBWR and the extent to which U-233 breeding can be achieved
while maintaining an acceptable cycle length and discharge burnup.”
“Thoriumplutonium fuels can be designed according to two distinct objectives:
1. Maximizing the utilization—and hence incineration—of plutonium. This is done by oper-
ating the fuel in a core environment with high neutron-moderation (a high hydrogen-to-
heavy-metal ratio).
2. Maximizing the cycle length for the reactor-fuel system. This is achieved by operating the
fuel in a reduced-moderation core environment (lower hydrogen-to-heavy-metal ratio),
resulting in higher production of 233U and hence a slower rate of fissile depletion in the
fuel.”
Another irradiation series is planned for 2015.
26.14.10
Molten salts
Thorium Electronuclear AB seeks finance to initiate irradiations aimed at the
DMSR at the Halden facility. DMSR was the last design from the Oak Ridge
National Laboratories after difficulties encountered during the two-fluid breeder
concept. MSRE ran smoothly on highly enriched U235, U233, and “pills” of pluto-
nium but the complete and irradiated chemistry has not been verified with thorium
also added to the mix. The DMSR is a one-fluid once-through concept with low
power density that allows for a 30-year graphite life. Eighty per cent of the energy
produced originates from thorium. It starts up on 19.75% enriched U. The physical
properties, thermal hydraulics, and corrosion mechanisms are not expected to
change significantly from the MSRE. Details were not disclosed at the time of this
writing.

Fast MSR with a U-Pu fuel cycle.
Almost all these activities are devoted to the theoretical and experimental
reasons for different modifications to the thorium MSR and its fuel cycle. In the
last 3 years the concept of the fast MSR with U-Pu fuel has been developed.
26.15.1
Physics and chemistry of MSR materials
Molten salt properties (density, viscosity, thermal capacity and conductivity, etc.)
have been studied in Russia for a long time. One of the first works was the determi-
nation of the fusion diagram of LiF-NaF-KF (Bergman and Dergunov, 1941). The
essential contribution to this field was done by VNIINM (Gorbunov et al., 1976),
Ural Polytechnic Institute (Smirnov et al., 1974; Desyatnik et al., 1979, 1981;
Klimenkov et al., 1983), RIAR (Naumov et al., 1996), and especially by the
“Kurchatov Institute” (Ignat’ev et al., 1984; Naumov et al., 1996; Ignatiev et al.,
1999, 2003, 2006a, 2006b, 2008, 2013; Afonichkin et al., 2009; Khokhlov et al.,
2009; Merzlyakov et al., 2011, 2014; Ignatiev and Surenkov, 2012, 2013; Alexeev
et al., 1997, 1998, 2014).
Measurements of the solubility of the actinide and lanthanide fluorides in molten
salts were performed recently at VNIIKHT (Seregin et al., 2011a, 2011b;
Ponomarev et al., 2011, 2013), VNIITP (Volozhin et al., 2013), and RIAR (Lizin
et al., 2013a, 2013b, 2015a, 2015b).
26.15.2
Subcritical MSR systems for minor actinide
incineration
Due to the small fraction of the Am delayed neutrons (ß  0.14%) MSR burners of
the minor actinides are considered mainly as subcritical ones. Many theoretical and
experimental works have been performed in this respect (Dubovsky, 1959;
Vasil’kov et al., 1970; Kolesov and Guzhovsky, 1994; Kolesov et al., 1995, 1997,
2002; Alekseev et al., 1995a, 1995b, 2015; Kolesov and Khoruzhii, 2000; Kiselev,
701
Worldwide activities

2001; Gerasimov and Kiselev, 2001; Mel’nik et al., 2003; ISTC Project#1486,
2004; Degtyarev et al., 2005, 2006, 2012, 2013a, 2013b, 2013c; Yurevich et al.,
2006; Gulevich et al., 2008a, 2008b, 2013).
The accelerator power Wa with proton energy Ea  1 GeV and the blanket core
power Wb with subcriticality Δk are connected by the relation (Degtyarev et al.,
2005):
Wa  0:7UΔkUWb
At
Wa 5 10 MW
and
Δk 5 0.05
the
blanket
power
is
restricted
up
to
Wb  300 MWth.
To enhance Wb to A  Wb at fixed Wa with amplification factor A, the cascade
schema of the MSR burner was considered (Dubovsky, 1959; Kolesov and
Guzhovsky, 1994; Kolesov et al., 1995, 1997, 2002; Alekseev et al., 1995a, 1995b;
Kolesov and Khoruzhii, 2000; Mel’nik et al., 2003; ISTC Project#1486, 2004;
Degtyarev et al., 2005, 2006). The experiment was performed at VNIIEF
(Fig. 26.15.1) (Kolesov et al., 2002; ISTC Project#1486, 2004). The measured value
A 5 2.0 6 0.1 is in fair agreement with theoretical estimations.
The effective MSR burner of Am was considered on the base of eutectic
LiF-NaF-KF in which the solubility of AmF3 is B40 mol% at 700C (Lizin et al.,
2013a). Such an MSR burner can incinerate B300 kg Am/year  GWth using Am as
fuel, without feeding by Pu and U-235 (Degtyarev et al., 2013b).

220 tablets of U-235 (18.6 kg, 90% enrichment), in which the sphere of Np-237 (5 kg) is

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

26.15.3
Thorium-based reactor and its fuel cycle
The thorium fuel cycle was studied for many years in the Institute of Physics and
Power Engineering (IPPE, Obninsk) and Moscow Engineering Physics Institute
(MEPHI, Moscow) (Mourogov et al., 1983), as well as in the Institutes of the
Russian Academy of Sciences (Suglobov et al., 2007). The most systematic consid-
eration was performed in the Russian Research Center “Kurchatov Institute”
(Ignatiev et al., 2007, 2008; ISTC Task #1606, 2007), especially in the framework
of the “MOSART” conception, based on the salt LiF-NaF-BeF2 (Ignatiev et al.,
2012a, 2012b, 2014). This reactor has an intermediate neutron spectrum, and it is
proposed as a minor actinides incinerator.
26.15.4
Fast MSR with U-Pu fuel cycle
The concept of the fast MSR based on chloride salt was considered in the work by
Mourogov and Bokov (2006).
Until recently the fast MSR with U-Pu fuel based on the fluoride molten salts
was not considered because the PuF3 solubility in these salts does not exceed
B3 mol%. In the last 3 years the extremely high solubility of the actinide fluorides
PuF3, UF4, and AmF3 in the eutectic 46.5LiF11.5NaF42.0KF (FLiNaK) was
established experimentally (B30, 45, and 40 mol%, respectively, at 700C) (Lizin
et al., 2013a, 2013b; Volozhin et al., 2013), as well as the lanthanide fluoride solu-
bility (Seregin et al., 2011a, 2011b; Ponomarev et al., 2011, 2013). These observa-
tions at first opened the way for the development of the fast MSR with U-Pu fuel
cycle, which can operate in the equilibrium mode (Degtyarev et al., 2015;
Ponomarev and Fedorov, 2015; Ponomarev et al., 2016) (see also Chapter 12: Fast-
spectrum, liquid-fueled reactors). The closed fuel cycle of such an MSR is simpli-
fied in comparison with that of the solid fuel reactors and its cost is essentially
reduced (Ponomarev et al., 2016). The subcritical fast MSR burner of minor acti-
nides based on FLiNaK can incinerate B300 kg Am/year  GWth (Degtyarev et al.,
2013b) (see Chapter 15: Accelerator-driven systems).

Introduction
Steenkampskraal Thorium Limited (STL), is developing the HTMR-100 (High
Temperature Modular Reactor) pebble bed reactor, a high-temperature gas-cooled
reactor, graphite moderated, and cooled by forced helium flow. The existing design
of the module is to produce high-quality steam which is coupled to a steam-turbine/
generator system to produce 35 MW of electric power. The steam can be used in a
wide range of cogeneration applications. The reactor is also suitable to provide
direct high-temperature energy for process heat. The design of the reactor is based
on proven technology and therefore no new basic technology development is
needed. The size of the reactor and the fuel cycle were chosen to simplify the
design and operation of the module and to facilitate the use of thorium. The
approach to small intrinsic safe modular units ensures continuous production, easy
road transportability, skid mounted subsystems, a wider range of manufacturers,
fast construction, and an enhanced licensing process (Fig. 26.16.1).
26.16.2
Target applications
The HTMR-100 is capable of supplying electric power to any distribution grid and
to standalone or isolated electricity users. It can be deployed as single modules or
multimodule plants as well as for medium-temperature process heat applications.
The HTMR-100 is a perfect fit for clients who want to progressively extend their
generating capability. The unique safety characteristics make it possible to intro-
duce and construct these plants in non-nuclear countries. First World countries that
want to utilize their stock of plutonium for peaceful applications are also markets
for HTMR-100 reactors.

Design philosophy
The reactor has good load-following characteristics which are needed for standalone
(not grid-coupled) applications. The “once through then out” (OTTO) fueling
scheme leads to a simple and cost-effective fuel management system. The relative
low primary loop pressure requires a thinner-walled pressure vessel and thus an eas-
ier manufacturing process, resulting in a wider range of vessel manufacturers.
The HTMR-100 plant design caters for different site and client requirements. It
allows flexibility in protection against external events and flexibility in multimo-
dule configuration and power capacity.

Reactor core and power conversion unit
The reactor unit consists of a steel pressure vessel, a steel core barrel, graphite
reflector blocks, neutron absorber rods, rod guide tubes, drive mechanisms, and in-
vessel instrumentation. The vessel is designed for 4 MPa pressure.
The graphite structure allows for differential expansion and volumetric changes
due to temperature and neutron fluence-induced distortion. This is done to keep the
stresses low and minimize primary fluid bypass and leaks. The side, top, and bot-
tom reflector material is nuclear grade graphite (Fig. 26.16.2).

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

The flow through the core is from top to bottom where the heated gas is col-
lected in a hot plenum. From the plenum the hot gas flows through a connecting
pipe to the steam generator. The power conversion system (PCS) uses a helical coil
steam-generator unit supplying superheated steam to the turbine. The main system
will be supplied as four skid-mounted units, namely the condenser, turbine, gearbox
and electric generator. The turbine can be used in a back-pressure configuration or
intermediate-temperature steam can be taken off for process heat applications.
26.16.4.3
Fuel characteristics and supply
The fuel elements (FE) for the HTMR-100 are 60 mm diameter spheres consisting
of a spherical fuel zone of approximately 50 mm diameter, in which the TRISO-
coated particles are randomly distributed in the graphitic matrix material. A fuel-
free shell of graphite matrix of about 5 mm in thickness is then molded to the fuel
zone. The fuel kernel and coatings serve as a fission product barrier in normal and
accident operating conditions.
There are various types of fuel that will be used in the HTMR-100 reactor, rang-
ing from LEU UO2 to mixtures of Th/LEU, Th/HEU, and Th/Pu. The following
options have already been studied and show to be viable

A fuel qualification and test program will be conducted on the fuel prior to
loading of the reactor.
The HTMR-100 operates on a much longer burn-up fuel cycle compared to
conventional reactors. The nonproliferation characteristic of the OTTO cycle is the
extended time the pebbles reside inside the core, making it more difficult to divert
partially burnt fuel.
26.16.4.4
Fuel handling system
The fuel handling and storage system (FHSS) is a support system to the main power
system of the HTMR-100.
A 6-month supply of fresh fuel is kept in the fresh fuel storage facility. New spherical
fuel elements (fresh fuel) are loaded by the fuel-loading machine into a charge lock. The
charge lock is purged, filled with clean helium, and pressurized to system pressure,
Figure 26.16.2 Power conversion and main support systems.

712
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

before it is opened and fuel is gravity-fed into the core cavity. The charge lock has a
physical capacity for approximately one full-power day’s fuel sphere inventory.
Spent fuel is removed from the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) by means of two
fuel-unloading machines (FUMs), connected to a single reactor defueling chute.
Each FUM discharges spent fuel into a discharge lock. The discharge locks have
sufficient capacity for a full-power day of spent fuel elements.
Spent fuel, damaged in such a manner that gravity conveyance is compromised,
is mechanically separated inside the FUM and accumulated in a dedicated scrap
canister, located inside the FUM.
Provision is made in the design of the FHSS for the temporary fitment of activity-
measuring devices. These are to be used for the removal of the first core graphite
spheres. Separate burn-up measuring devices can also be temporarily installed for
core performance and calculational purposes when running fuel composition trials.
During decommissioning the FHSS extracts the last used fuel in the same man-
ner as during normal operation (Fig. 26.16.3).
26.16.4.5
Reactivity control
Eighteen neutron absorber rods are provided in graphite sleeves inside the graphite
side reflector blocks. The absorber rods can be operated independently as a group or
as subgroups, as required by the reactor operating control system. A control rod con-
sists of several rod absorber material segments, pinned together to form articulating
Figure 26.16.3 Fuel handling scheme.
713
Worldwide activities

joints. The segments consist of sintered B4C absorber material, sandwiched between
an inner and an outer tube segment. The inner tube segment allows cooling helium
gas to flow from the top down in the circular channels. Each rod is equipped with a
position indicator which measures the position of the rod over its entire positioning
range and with position indicators for the upper and lower limit positions.
26.16.4.6
Reactor pressure vessel and internals
The RPV is constructed to the ASME III subsection NB code. It is comprised of
two main components:
1. Reactor vessel body;
2. Vessel head which is bolted to the vessel body.
The reactor vessel body consists of several forged ring-components circumferen-
tially welded together.
The core structures consist of the metallic parts and the graphite structures. The
function of these internal structures is to provide stable core geometry, neutron
reflection, cold and hot gas channeling, fuel element flow, shielding, thermal insula-
tion, and support of the control and shutdown systems guide tubes and the neutron
source. The functional design of the structural core internals is such that they are
capable of withstanding the steady state and transient loadings during normal opera-
tion, anticipated operational occurrences, and design basis accidents.
The shape and structure of the inner side reflector wall and the 30 degrees angled
core bottom permit uniform fuel element flow.
The loads borne by the ceramic internals are transferred to the steel core barrel
and then to the RPV through metallic components, such as the lower support
structure and the core barrel axial and radial supports.
All areas of the core internals are designed for the service life of the reactor.
Access for ceramic structure inspections can be done through the fuel-loading
channel and the reflector rod holes.
26.16.5
Plant safety features
26.16.5.1
Engineered safety system configuration and approach
In principle the plant is designed to perform its safety functions without reliance on
the automated plant control system, or the operator. The engineered safety system
of the plant has no engineered safety systems in terms of active human or machine
intervention to assure nuclear safety.
The low-power density, the large mass of the core structures, the slender core
geometry, and the use of materials capable of withstanding high temperatures
ensure complete passive residual heat removal capability without exceeding the
design limits of components.
Provision for beyond-design basis conditions is made. Beyond-design basis sce-
narios include the nonfunctioning/noninsertion of all active control and shutdown
714
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

systems. The reactor core characteristics, e.g., small excess reactivity and strong
negative reactivity coefficient with temperature will shut down the reactor and
maintain a condition where no damage to the fuel, core structures, and reactor ves-
sel occurs.
Excessive reactivity increases during water or water vapor ingress (increasing
moderation) is prevented by designing the reactor for limited heavy metal content
of the fuel.
26.16.5.2
Reactor cooling philosophy
The reactor cavity cooling system (RCCS) removes heat radiated from the reactor
towards the reactor cavity walls. It consists of welded membrane tubes arranged
side-by-side on the inside of the reactor cavity wall. Water is circulated through the
tubes to form a cold wall. The RCCS is a passive system and consists of three inde-
pendent cooling trains and is designed for all postulated design basis conditions.
26.16.5.3
Containment function
The primary fission product barrier is the TRISO-coated fuel particles, which keep
the fission products contained under all postulated events, even if the second barrier
(the primary pressure vessel system) and the third barrier (the building filter sys-
tem) collapse.
26.16.6
Plant safety and operational performances
The central consideration is the demand for high availability of process steam sup-
ply and/or electricity generation. To reduce or minimize the nuclear steam supply
system (NSSS) daily or weekly load changes of the reactor, the preference is to
change the ratio between steam supply and electricity supply. Excess steam and/or
electricity can be utilized in the desalination plants to provide water as a sellable
commodity earning additional revenue. This allows the plant to operate virtually
continually at full power very close to the plant availability.
In order to maintain the plant safety and operational performance, specific areas
are controlled for human occupation and protection.
26.16.7
Instrumentation and control systems
The automation system (ATS) comprises that group of safety and nonsafety C&I
systems that provide automated protection, control, monitoring, and humansystem
interfaces. The following three specific systems in the HTMR-100 system structure
define control and instrumentation:
715
Worldwide activities

1. Plant control, data, and instrumentation system: Provides overall plant control and moni-
toring. It includes architecture which combines C&I systems and the control room
equipment.
2. Equipment/investment protection system: Reduce the risk of losing critical or expensive
components by maintaining the plant within its normal and safe operating envelope.
3. Protection system: Initiates reactor SCRAM to protect against nuclear control failure or
loss of primary coolant, etc.
The HTMR-100 ATS architecture implements modern digital C&I designs and
equipment. The architecture of the overall automation system is based on redun-
dancy, diversity, separation, and functional and physical independence. This con-
cept includes four levels of defense-in-depth: (1) distributed control system or
control system; (2) reactor protection system (RPS); (3) manual shutdown system;
and (4) post-event information system.
26.16.8
Site and plant layout
The HTMR-100 is configured to simplify the construction of the various buildings
and to ensure easy installation of the reactor, steam generator, and handling of spent
fuel. The proposed plant layout aims to protect safety-important functions while
simplifying operational and maintenance tasks. The plant layout allows for the addi-
tion of multiple reactors (and associated equipment) in a compact multimodule
fashion.
26.16.8.1
Reactor building
The reactor building contains the safety equipment that provides the necessary func-
tions for the safe shutdown of the reactor under all design basis conditions. The
reactor building is partially submerged below ground level such that the reactor and
steam generator cavities are completely protected against postulated external
threats. The depth can be further adapted to suit the geological conditions of the
specific site to provide for the necessary level of seismic protection.
The reactor building, electrical building, and auxiliary buildings are connected
by means of underground tunnels, providing protection for interlinked services and
it also ensures that spent fuel is never brought above ground level. Provision is
made for the storage of all spent fuel produced during the operating life of the
plant. The reactor building is seismically designed to withstand a design basis earth-
quake (DBE) and together with the spent fuel storage bunker, is the only safety-
related building structure of the HTMR-100 (Fig. 26.16.4).
26.16.8.2
Electrical building
The electrical building houses the main control and computer rooms, primary and
secondary plant security alarm rooms, and provides the primary access facilities for
716
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

the nuclear island and the energy conversion area. This center also provides space
for activities associated with plant administration and security services. The plant
control, data, and instrumentation system control/display panels and computers are
housed in the control room.
26.16.8.3
Turbine generator building
The turbine generator building provides the foundation and housing for the PCS,
including other support systems such as the compressed air, water sampling,
HVAC, voltage distribution systems, permanent 11 kVAC and 400 VAC diesel
generator sets, and steam safety valves.
26.16.8.4
Balance of plant
The balance of plant consists of the secondary systems and the tertiary systems.
The PCS has one set of isolation valves between itself and the NSSS. The PCS
and its major subsystems are of non-nuclear safety class and thus conventional
safety class and the product is of a high-quality industrial standard.
26.16.8.5
Electric power systems
The electrical power supply system (EPSS) for the single-module HTMR-100 plant
supplies power to the plant safety and nonsafety equipment for normal plant opera-
tion, start-up, normal shutdown, as well as for accident mitigation and safe
shutdown.
The EPSS provides the following voltage levels: 230 VAC, 400 VAC, 11 kVAC,
24/48 VDC, and 250 VDC. The primary voltage of the station feeder transformer is
transmission grid dependent and thus site specific.

Worldwide activities

The majority of plant loads are powered from the main power supply system
(MPSS), while all safety-related loads as well as nonsafety-related loads on the
nuclear island (NI) portion of the EPSS are powered by the reactor power supply
system (RPSS). The RPS and some nonsafety-related loads (i.e., primary blowers 1
and 2, etc.) are powered from the RPSS. A portion of the RPSS circuit (inside the
reactor building) is categorized as safety-related (Class 1E).
26.16.9
Design and licensing status
Conceptual design is in an advanced stage. The core nucleonic, thermohydraulic,
and heat transfer analyses are carried out to optimize the performance and verify
the safety analysis. Nuclear regulator engagement is planned for 2017 with the aim
of commencing the preassessment for licensing in order to reach design certification
status at the end of the concept phase.

Plant economics
Since the HTMR-100 is mainly intended to service the needs of isolated geographi-
cal areas, it is not meant to compete economically with large (.1 GW) reactors
connected to an existing national grid. The HTR SMR comes into its own right
when the various combinations of electricity, process heat, and water desalination
are considered and holds great promise for the long-term economics of users.
Preliminary capital and operating cost studies indicate that this flexibility of the
HTMR-100 provides the most efficient energy to isolated communities and indus-
tries. It is well suited to deployment in developing countries with its affordability
and Gen IV safety characteristics.

Preliminaries
Research in advanced nuclear reactors (such as accelerator-driven systems (ADS)
or Gen-IV reactors) has not been very intensive in Sweden. Before the Three Mile
Island accident some aspects of fast reactor concepts were tested in critical assem-
blies at the national research center at Studsvik. After that accident, a national vote
718
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

(referendum) was held on nuclear energy, which resulted in a recommendation of
phasing out nuclear power in the long term. This had the consequence that in the
continuation, education, and research into nuclear engineering only obtained fund-
ing from the industry (coordinated by the Swedish Centre for Nuclear Technology
(SKC)), and the safety authority. For obvious reasons, the activity was restricted to
the safety of the existing installations.
Research on ADS and transmutation was started at the Royal Institute of
Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, with support from the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and
Waste Management Co., as well as from the EU, in the early 1990s. About the
same time, Chalmers (Go¨teborg) and Uppsala joined research on transmutation
techniques and Chalmers also participated in FP 4, 5, and 7 projects on ADS.
Regarding Gen-IV systems, the main interest in Sweden lies in lead-cooled fast
reactors. In 2009, in the midst of a short hopeful period in the pre-Fukushima era, the
Swedish Research council financed a 3-year-long framework project called GENIUS,
aimed at research in lead-cooled reactors. All three universities with nuclear engineer-
ing faculties (KTH, Uppsala, and Chalmers) participated in the project.
26.17.2
MSR kinetics, dynamics, and neutron noise
The Department of Nuclear Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology has
long been carrying out research and development work on reactor dynamics and noise
diagnostics in co-operation with the nuclear industry (the Ringhals power plant) and
the safety authority (the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority). Research on the
dynamics and neutron fluctuations in molten salt systems was started in 2008, partly
as a PhD research project (Jonsson, 2012). Some of the work was performed with
international co-operation, with a visiting professor from CEA Saclay, France. This
research is described in Chapter 5, Kinetics, dynamics, and neutron noise in stationary
MSRs, hence only a brief summary of the main findings is given here.
In this research, the kinetic behavior of molten salt systems was investigated in
simple models, in which analytical or semianalytical solutions can be obtained.
This facilitates the insight and understanding of the physics of such systems. A
number of characteristics of MSR dynamics were identified and interpreted in com-
parison with traditional solid fuel systems. It was shown that due to the movement
of the delayed neutron precursors, such systems become more tightly coupled from
the neutron physics point of view, which manifests itself in their dynamic response.
Due to the smaller effective fraction of delayed neutron precursors, the neutron
fluctuations induced by perturbations in a critical core have a larger amplitude than
in traditional reactors with solid fuel, hence neutron diagnostics might be an effec-
tive tool for monitoring and surveillance of such systems. It was also shown that
application of the traditional point kinetic approximation, which assumes factoriza-
tion between the space- and time-dependence, meets difficulties due to the fact that
the propagating property of the delayed neutron precursors is in contradiction with
factorization.
719
Worldwide activities

There was no Swedish technical participation in any of the European MSR projects,
but the Division of Nuclear Engineering from Chalmers had a member in the stake-
holders’ committee of the 3-year-long FP7 Project on the Evaluation of the Viability
Of Liquid fuel fast reactor system (EVOL), dedicated to the design of the molten
salt fast reactor (MSFR) concept. The EVOL project run between 20112013. The
Division was also invited to present their research at the CMSNT-2013 (Conference on
Molten Salts in Nuclear Technology), January 911, 2013, Mumbai, India.
26.17.3
Nonproliferation and safeguard aspects
of the MSR fuel cycle
Uppsala University has long had research and education activities within nonprolifera-
tion and nuclear safeguards of the fuel cycle, initially for light-water reactor systems.
They have extended this activity also to the fuel cycle of advanced reactor systems,
including molten salt reactors. This research is summarized in Chapter 10,
Nonproliferation and safeguards aspects of the MSR fuel cycle. The work concerns the
analysis of the whole fuel cycle of an MSR, and the attractiveness of the nuclear mate-
rials used; and the vulnerability of the fuel cycle is compared to the case of light-water
reactors. As is demonstrated, the fuel cycle of the MSR contains a number of chal-
lenges, as compared to the already-existing and proven technologies, due to the differ-
ences and the lack of operating experience. There are both advantages (high-energy
gamma radiation of one of the daughter nuclides, as well as low fuel inventory) and
disadvantages (a continuous material stream, easier divertible compared to discrete
fuel rods, on-line refueling and reprocessing, fuel residence outside the core, and
finally the good suitability of U-233 for constructing simple gun-type bombs).
The conclusion is that significant work remains to be done and experience to be gained
to improve and secure the proliferation resistance of the MSR fuel cycle.
26.17.4
Thorium research
In 2006, the largest Swedish nuclear utility Vattenfall, together with the Norwegian
privately owned company Thor Energy, initiated a feasibility study of various tho-
rium systems. The focus was on reactor types that were either already on the market
or perceived to be ready for commercialization within the next 1015 years. Parts
of the study were carried out by researchers within Vattenfall, some parts were car-
ried out at Swedish universities, and some parts were subcontracted to researchers
in other countries. The research performed at the Swedish universities included two
MSc thesis projects involving neutronic simulations, one focusing on the nuclear
design and evaluation of a BWR with four different variants of thorium-based fuel
(Insulander Bjo¨rk, 2008) and the other involving similar simulations but for a PWR
(Liu, 2008). The feasibility study did not indicate any showstoppers for the use of
thorium in any of the investigated systems. Based on the study, Vattenfall decided
720
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

not to engage more with thorium fuel, whereas Thor Energy decided to proceed
with irradiation testing of thorium-based oxide fuel with plutonium as a fissile com-
ponent (Th-MOX). An irradiation test rig was loaded in the Halden research reactor
in 2013, comprising Th-MOX pellets and also some uranium oxide fuel with tho-
rium added as a minor component.
As a further consequence of the feasibility study, Thor Energy, with the support
of the Norwegian Research Council, sponsored an industrial PhD project at the
Division of Nuclear Engineering at Chalmers, which involved neutronic simulations
of the usage of Th-MOX fuel in BWRs and PWRs, as well as analysis of the data
from the test irradiation and related thermal-mechanical simulations of the fuel
material (Insulander Bjo¨rk, 2015). In parallel, another PhD project was performed
at the Division of Nuclear Engineering at Chalmers, on the feasibility of using tho-
rium in PWRs, funded by the Oskarshamn Power plant and Vattenfall (Lau, 2014).
The origin of this project was that some sponsoring members of the Swedish Centre
for Nuclear Technology expressed interest in knowing more about the thorium
cycle and research in India in this respect. In this study, the main focus was the use
of thorium as a minor component in uranium oxide fuel, which was proven to pro-
vide some benefits, in particular with regards to power-peaking factors.
This concept attracted the interest of Thor Energy, which was the reason why a
fuel material typical for this application was included in the irradiation test rig in
the Halden research reactor. Some simulations were also performed by Thor Energy
on the neutronic merits of thorium as an additive to uranium oxide fuel in BWRs
(Insulander Bjo¨rk, 2015), and several different fuel materials typical for this appli-
cation were loaded in a second test rig in 2015, together with other uranium-based
fuel types with different additives for improving fuel performance.
26.17.5
The chemistry of the thorium cycle with a view
to MSR
At the Department of Nuclear Chemistry at Chalmers the specialty has for a long
time been the chemistry of the fuel cycle from mining to final repository, including
separation for transmutation. In this context several processes based on aqueous
reprocessing have been developed mainly for uranium- and uranium/plutonium-
based fuels. One of the reasons for this is that the nuclear chemistry laboratory at
Chalmers is one of very few in the world that can handle all chemical elements
present in spent nuclear fuel in reasonable amounts. Thus, advanced fuels such as
(Pu, Zr)N and minor actinide-bearing oxides can also be manufactured (the first
pure PuN pellet in the world was made here in 2015).
For thorium fuels the fabrication is rather straightforward. The choice of starter
nuclide is naturally pivotal for the choice of facility to work in. Today there are
several choices for such a starter, e.g., 239Pu, 233U, or 235U. In the latter cases
(U,Th)O2 fuels have been prepared at Chalmers by the powder-mixing route.
However, as the percentage of the starter increases or if the fuel is used for minor
721
Worldwide activities

actinide burning, other production routes, e.g. the dust-free sol-gel may be used.
This technique is also used in the Chalmers laboratories.
The recycling of thorium-based fuels is a major challenge, as is discussed in the
literature. The conclusion is that for normal Th-based fuel the U and the Th will be
recycled for further use, while the remaining elements will be vitrified. The separa-
tion process is rather simple and can be tested at Chalmers. However, the actual dis-
solution of the thorium fuel is not as simple, due to the very high stability of ThO2
(which makes it ideal for direct storage without recycling). So far, the dominating
suggested route has still been the HF/HNO3-based THOREX dissolution. More
novel methods exist but have not been tried industrially or in pilot plant scale.
In the case of the MSR, laboratories exist with the capability to develop pro-
cesses based on the uranium and thorium fuel cycles. In essence this means that an
MSR fuel simulate can be made mimicking any stage of the operational cycle. This
salt can then be used for separation studies in batch processes. No equipment for
continuous processes exists. In principle the methods that potentially can be used
for MSR cycles are:
1. Physical methods with fractionated distillation or sublimation and crystallization as well
as methods of liquidliquid extraction and distribution in immiscible molten metals and
molten salts;
2. Chemical methods such as cyclic oxidation and reduction methods using chemical and
electrochemical processes.
Depending on fuel type, i.e., uranium- or thorium-based, these methods may be
more or less suitable. However, for practical reasons, the preferred techniques at
Chalmers would be electrochemical separation from the molten salt or molten salt/
molten metal extractive separation. The present equipment is placed in a glove box
with possibilities to control the main atmosphere as well as the oxygen potential,
etc. This equipment is shown in Fig. 26.17.1.

Research into heat and mass transfer
in molten salts
Extensive studies into natural convection in molten salt pools (Sehgal et al., 1998;
Gubaidullin, 2002; Gubaidullin & Sehgal, 2002) have been completed at the
Division of Nuclear Power Safety at the Royal Institute of Technology in
Stockholm, with primary interest in severe accident research. A series of experi-
ments employing eutectic and noneutectic salt mixtures in a NaNO3-KNO3 system
were performed in the SIMECO facility (Fig. 26.17.2). Tests with stratified molten
pools with two and three unmixable layers were carried out to study and develop
heat transfer models for molten pools undergoing a miscibility gap. The heat-
focusing effect of a metal layer atop of the molten salt pool was investigated
experimentally.
Advanced numerical models were elaborated and tested, which enable quantita-
tive analysis of a two-layer salt-stratified system in a wide range of flow regimes,
including flow instabilities and turbulent effects. The turbulent characteristics inher-
ent to the convection at Rayleigh numbers of interest were obtained by direct
numerical simulation (DNS). The results were compared against experimental data.
The underlying physics of the flow characteristics was explained, and the shortcom-
ings of existing turbulence models were pointed out.
Currently the studies are extended to more refractory NaCl-BaCl2 salt systems
and pure aluminum or aluminumsilicon alloy unmixable layers. The research is
conducted within the European research program Horizon-2020 in the framework
of the IVMR project. Small-scale experiments on material compatibility and tests
of different heating methods were performed (Fig. 26.17.3). A new large-scale
SIMECO-2 facility is under construction to study both steady-state and transient
behavior of molten salt pools. The experimental results and the numerical

simulation methods developed will also benefit the research in and construction of
a wide spectrum of molten salt systems.

Introduction
Switzerland is a member of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF). In 2015, the
GIF general framework agreement, as well as the Swiss participation in GIF, was
extended for another 10 years. Switzerland, through its representative the Paul
Scherrer Institut (PSI), was traditionally involved in high-temperature reactor (HTR)
and gas-cooled fast reactor (GFR) research. However, participation in the GFR system
was terminated and Switzerland joined the GIF MSR project on November 20, 2015.
The MSR-related research was launched at the Nuclear Energy and Safety
(NES) division of PSI at the end of 2012. Nonetheless, there was historically
already some research effort in the field of chloride salt-based MSRs at the prede-
cessor of PSI, the Eidgeno¨ssisches Institut fu¨r Reaktorforschung (EIR), in the 1970s
(Taube et al., 1978). The recent activities were initiated at the Laboratory for
Reactor Physics and System Behaviour (LRS) and related mainly to the fuel cycle
in thoriumuranium-fueled MSRs (Fiorina et al., 2013; Kˇrepel et al., 2013). Later
the development of two different approaches for MSR transient analysis was
launched based on the coupled system code TRACE-PARCS (Kim, 2015; Zanetti
et al., 2015) and OpenFOAM high-fidelity solver GeN-Foam (Fiorina et al., 2015,
2016; Fiorina and Mikityuk, 2015). Currently, four laboratories of NES are already
partly involved in MSR research and, for instance, the chemical thermodynamic
study of mixed fluoride salt systems with the PSI in-house code GEMS was
launched. PSI is one of the SAMOFAR consortium members and it belongs to the
research institutions working intensively on MSR development.
26.18.2
Motivation and main research areas
One of the NES missions is to maintain excellence in nuclear engineering and to pro-
vide an attractive working area for future generations of scientists and engineers.
Innovative research projects represent an important asset to ensure successful recruit-
ing of a highly motivated and efficient workforce in the coming years. Furthermore,
the NES strategy calls for a new project at the department level that attempts to con-
solidate the research efforts of all NES labs towards a holistic consideration of safety
of an innovative reactor concept, which led to the choice of MSR.
725
Worldwide activities

MSR has a potential for high resources utilization, low waste production, and
risk reduction with the exclusion of severe accidents. It may fulfill the “low-waste,
low-risk” requirement of the broad public towards a better acceptance of nuclear
energy generation in the future. Furthermore, since MSR operates at low pressure
and since both the safety approach and the fuel cycle may be potentially simplified,
in the long term it may become cheaper than current or planned nuclear reactors.
The safety of MSR, as the key point and main interest of NES, cannot be evalu-
ated without knowing the system design, fuel chemistry, salt thermal-hydraulics
features, safety and fuel cycle approach, and the relevant material and chemical
limits. Not all of these issues will be addressed at PSI; however, there are several
NES competences related to thermal and fast solid fuel reactors which are planned
to be extended to the MSR analysis. These activities can be grouped into four
topical areas:
1. Core design and fuel cycle;
2. Fuel behavior at nominal and accidental conditions;
3. Transient behavior and decay heat removal system;
4. Safety, fuel stream, and relevant limits.
All these activities are interconnected and safety represents the central point of
interest (see Fig. 26.18.1). At the same time, the structure is proposed so that
there are research topics which can be independently studied within each of the
groups.

Related national and international projects
In 2012, PSI joined as an observer of the 4-year EU FP7 project on the Evaluation
of the Viability Of Liquid fuel fast reactor system (EVOL), dedicated to the design
of the molten salt fast reactor (MSFR) concept. Since 2015, the PSI has participated
in the EVOL follow-up project. It is a 4-year Horizon 2020 project entitled Safety
Assessment of the MOlten salt FAst Reactor (SAMOFAR) dedicated to innovative
MSFR safety features. The contribution of PSI ranges from reactor physics to
chemistry, as well as preliminary severe accident modeling and risk assessment.
In 2014, the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) financed a PhD study “Small
Modular Molten Salt Reactor Designing for Low Waste Production” for a 3-year PhD
project, which started in April 2014. SNF approved another 3-year PhD grant related to
MSRs in 2015 with the title “Data Assimilation Methods for Reactor Physics Design
and Safety Calculations of Molten Salt and High Temperature Reactor Cores.”
In May 2015 a 2-year research project dedicated to HTR and MSR “Feasibility
and plausibility of innovative reactor concepts in a European electricity supply
environment” was launched. It is financed by the Project and Study Fund of the
Electricity Industry (PSEL) of the Association of Swiss Electricity Producers
(VSE), Swiss electricity grid operators (swisselectric), and ETH Zurich.
For the chemistry of molten salts it is relevant that in 2008 PSI joined as a part-
ner
of
the
4-year
FP7
Project
“Actinide
recycling
by
SEParation
and
Transmutation” (ACSEPT). The project lasted until 2012 and in its framework the
HERACLES database for the PSI in-house chemical thermodynamics modeling
code GEMS was created. In 2013 PSI joined the 3-year FP7 follow-up project
“Safety of ACtinide SEparation proceSSes” (SACSESS), which lasted until 2016.
The PSI contribution focused on Mo and MgO behavior in LiCl-KCl salts and on
the behavior of actinide fluorides in LiF-AlF3 salts.
26.18.4
Core design and fuel cycle
The core design and fuel cycle-related activities at PSI focus on the identification
of MSR designs appropriate for sustainable energy production and simultaneously
limiting the waste production and granting high levels of safety. The work plan is
based mainly on the SNF PhD study and the PSEL project. It is divided into two
main phases. The initial and ongoing phase is a parametric study evaluating major
design options such as salts, moderators, feed materials, fuel cycle, core layout, etc.
The second phase objective is to identify a reactor design out of the choices from
the parametric studies. It is foreseen to use criteria for selection such as: dimen-
sions, materials lifetime, fissile inventory, etc. The main design criterion is, none-
theless, the neutron economy. Excellent neutron economy should enable both
breeding of fissile fuel from fertile nuclides (232Th or 238U) and reduction of legacy
and own waste volume. The pivotal tool for related simulations is the PSI in-house
equilibrium closed cycle routine EQL0D (Hombourger et al., 2015a, 2016). This is
a MATLAB script coupled with the Monte-Carlo code SERPENT capable of
727
Worldwide activities

simulating continuous reprocessing; for instance, removal of gaseous fission pro-
ducts (FPs) from the MSR core.
The performance of fast spectrum MSR was evaluated for several selected car-
rier salt compositions including both fluoride and chloride salts: 7LiF-BeF2, 7LiF,
7LiF-NaF, NaF-BeF2, NaF-KF, NaCl, and Na37Cl. The labels 7Li and 37Cl indicate
assumption of isotopic enrichment. These carrier salts were mixed with the fuel salt
to form an eutectic mixture with lowest melting point. Both U-Pu and Th-U fuel
cycles were evaluated using EQL0D by means of the equilibrium closed cycle
excess reactivity ρ for infinite medium. To provide further insight major contribu-
tors to the parasitic neutron capture were identified (see Fig. 26.18.2).
The highest reactivity excess and so the best performance in both fuel cycles
was provided by Na37Cl carrier salt. Its tremendous reactivity excess in the U-Pu
cycle can even enable the use of a breed-and-burn fuel strategy (Hombourger et al.,
2015b). The best performance from the fluoride carrier salts was 7LiF, the reference
carrier salt of the SAMOFAR project. It was used for several fuel cycle studies. A
parametric spectral study at equilibrium cycle and at full core level was accom-
plished with an ERANOS-based EQL3D procedure (Kˇrepel et al., 2013). A hybrid
spectrum MSR core was evaluated (Kˇrepel et al., 2014a), the simplified reproces-
sing scheme assessed (Kˇrepel et al., 2014b), and the continuous and batchwise
reprocessing schemes compared in Kˇrepel et al. (2015).
26.18.5
Fuel behavior at nominal and accidental
conditions
MSR fuel behavior at nominal and accidental conditions can be analyzed by the
thermochemistry of molten salts. The variety of possible salt composition calls for
a tool able to predict physical and thermodynamic properties of a wide range of
mixtures. The PSI in-house open-source Gibbs Energy Minimization Software
(GEMS) (Kulik et al., 20042014) thus may play a vital role (see Fig. 26.18.3).
Figure 26.18.2 Excess reactivity in infinite media for Th-U (left) and U-Pu (right) fuel cycles
and selected carrier salts. The difference between excess and hypothetical reactivity (for zero
parasitic capture) is isotope-wise breakdown into actual components of parasitic capture.
728
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

The PSI activities grouped in this area are financed via the EU projects ACSEPT,
SACSESS, and SAMOFAR, and through an internal MSR project.
The utmost interest for safety evaluations is the physical properties pertaining to
accidental conditions such as phase changes (freezing or boiling). Moreover, the
behavior of specific fission products such as 99Mo can be of interest for medical
isotope production. The GEMS code with the extended HERACLES database
(Shcherbina et al., 2012) can be applied to model the above-mentioned MSR ther-
modynamic properties. GEMS has a modular and flexible database and user inter-
face built around an efficient open-source GEMS3K numerical kernel code (Kulik
et al., 2013) for solving phase equilibria in complex nonideal systems that can be
coupled with transport- or multiphysics codes. It has been developed at NES since
2000 under the lead of D.A. Kulik.
GEMS3K also contains a TSolMod code library (Wagner et al., 2012) with .25
state-of-the-art mixing models for aqueous, gaseous, and solid solutions and melts.
This gives GEMS a broad applicability to various types of materials, e.g., fused
salts, if extended with the necessary datasets for phases and their components. The
input thermodynamic functions and interaction parameters of mixing are kept in the
database and consistently extended, as required. The accomplished and planned
tasks in this topical area are:

Molecular dynamics (MD) application to MSR chemistry. MD and DFT simulations will
be used to provide novel data for improvement/extension of a thermodynamic database of
the key MSFR fuel systems including PuF3 and ThF4. Properties that will be simulated

diagrams; amendments of GEMS3K kernel for efficient coupling with OpenFOAM.
Optionally, the results obtained by the GEMS code can be employed for precipi-
tation and vaporization simulation under accidental conditions with the in-house
code Parallel SImulator of BOILing (PSI-BOIL) (Niceno et al., 2010). It can simu-
late the solidification process of single crystals, and assess the feasibility of vapori-
zation or freezing methods in the purification of waste salts. Similar simulations
have already been carried out in Badillo and Beckermann (2006) and Badillo
(2015), where a phase-field model was used to predict the morphology and concen-
tration distribution around a growing crystal.
The information on excess Gibbs energy for binary systems together with the
information on thermophysical properties of pure compounds can be used to study
complex systems. Such an approach allows to study the speciation in selected
melts, and to determine the standard Gibbs energies of various species in melts.
The information on standard Gibbs energies is used to assess the standard chemi-
cal potentials of different species melts, as well as for constructing the E-pO22
stability diagrams, such as those developed for Mo in LiCl-KCl (Fig. 26.18.4;
Nichenko and Streit, 2015). Among the stable Mo species in the LiCl-KCl system
in this case are: MoCl3, MoO2, and MoO3. Higher chlorides and oxychlorides are
unstable and thus are not present in the melt. This information can support an
experimental study on CERMET fuel electrochemical reprocessing in the pre-
sented melts.

The liquid fuel is acting at the same time as a coolant.
G
The solid moderator, if used, is cooled by the liquid fuel.
G
The delayed neutron precursors drift with the salt flow.
G
The heat from fast-decaying fission products is spatially distributed in the salt.
G
The heat from slower-decaying fission products is equally distributed in the salt volume.
G
Since the salt is volumetrically heated, the bulk salt temperature has a different meaning
for the heat exchange with solid walls than in the classical case.
These features make the simulation of MSRs a very interesting research topic.
There are only a few available codes which can simulate several of these peculiari-
ties. Especially, the heat exchange between volumetrically heated liquids and solid
surfaces is a scientifically challenging issue, which can have a strong relevance to
safety. The accomplished and planned tasks in this topical area are:
G
Salt properties inclusion in the TRACE code and pre-evaluation of the heat exchangers
(Ariu, 2014).
G
TRACE-point kinetics modification for delay neutron precursors drift (Zanetti et al.,
2015).
G
TRACE-PARCS modification for delay neutron precursors drift and its application to
MSRE transients (Kim, 2015).
G
Assessment of decay heat distribution in the fuel stream (Choe, 2015).
G
Development of GeN-Foam solver for OpenFOAM field solver (Fiorina et al., 2015,
2016; Fiorina and Mikityuk, 2015) and GeN-Foam modification for delay neutron precur-
sors drift.
G
In the frame of semester work, the GeN-Foam solver was applied to various simplified
layouts of fast MSR geometries in 2015 (Bao, 2015).
G
In 2016, two MSc studies were planned and one PhD study was due to be launched. The
GeN-Foam solver and the TRACE-PARCS coupled code should be applied to the molten
salt reactor experiment (MSRE) and MSFR.
G
Other planned tasks may cover molten salt instrumentation (Doppler velocimetry), refined
thermal-hydraulics design of the core and DHR system, and possibly also derivation of a
new Nusselt number formula for volumetrically heated liquids.
As an example of the TRACE-PARCS application, the response of the MSRE
core at 1 MW power level to a 24 pcm reactivity insertion (adopted from Zanetti
et al., 2015) is shown in Fig. 26.18.5. The power increase after the insertion is rela-
tively strong; however, the average salt and graphite temperatures at the end of the
731
Worldwide activities

transient are only slightly increased. Furthermore, the power stabilizes to the
original level. Another illustrative result (Bao, 2015) shows in Fig. 26.18.6 a basic
parametric study related to a cold jet-driven MSR. It was assumed that the cold salt
in the center of the core can have a stronger reactivity value and thus that it can be
used more efficiently to control the power. Four different locations for the salt out-
let have been evaluated from the maximal temperature point of view. Generally, it
was concluded that the impact of spatial temperature distribution on the reactivity
is low and does not provide strong advantages.
26.18.7
Safety, fuel stream, and relevant limits
The evaluation of MSR safety should be the main long-term aim of the NES divi-
sion. It is a very broad topic and the other three research areas should thus provide
key inputs to support it. Since MSR safety strongly depends on the fuel treatment,
the design and safety evaluation of the off-gas system and reprocessing unit may
belong here. MSR safety is also strongly design-dependent and only few general
studies can be accomplished without knowledge of the detailed design.

insertion: power (left), average salt temperature (center), and average graphite temperature
(right).

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

One of these tasks could be aerosol formation and migration in the containment
atmosphere. Fission products may be present there, either in the gas phase or as
aerosols. They undergo transformations depending on the concentration of the dif-
ferent species as well as the containment temperature and pressure. The formation
of aerosols from the gas phase species will be calculated taking into account the
formation by homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation and growth by condensa-
tion, coagulation, and agglomeration (Bosshard et al., 2013). Transport of aerosols
will be simulated based on the containment thermal-hydraulic conditions and depo-
sition on the walls and other structures will be estimated. The transport of gas-
phase species will be assessed based on available models implemented in severe
accident codes. As a result, the source term in the containment will be assessed.
Another example is the simplified level-3 Probabilistic Safety Assessment
(PSA). This will be applied to MSR to address the consequences of a hypothetical
accident in the nuclear energy chain. At the core of this activity is PSI’s Energy-
related Severe Accident Database (ENSAD). For background information and more
details on the simplified PSA employed compare the report of the EU project
NEEDS (Burgherr et al., 2008).
26.18.8
Summary
Switzerland, and especially the NES division of PSI, is involved in many research
areas related to MSR and it is a member of the SAMOAR project consortium.
Safety is the key point and the main long-term interest of the MSR research at
NES. At the current stage, the program focuses on several specific and independent
studies in four research areas.

26.19.1
Goals
Nuclear studies were started in Turkey in 1955, after agreement between the
Republic of Turkey and the United States of America for cooperation in the field of
research in the peaceful uses of atomic energy was approved. The Turkish Atomic
Energy Commission (TAEK) was established in 1956 and a 1 MW swimming pool
type of research reactor was established at Ku¨c¸u¨k C¸ ekmece, ˙Istanbul. Studies of
uranium and thorium exploration and research in Turkey come under the responsi-
bility of the Mineral Research and Exploration Institute (MTA), which was founded
by M. Kemal Atatu¨rk in 1935 (Erbay, 1985a). MTA established a pilot plant benefi-
ciation plant for the production of yellow cake and to educate qualified personnel
in 1974 (Erbay, 1985b).
The exploration studies continued up to the end of 1990, and 9129 tons of ura-
nium reserve were determined (MENR, 2016). The thorium resources have already
been confirmed at about 380,000 tons reasonably achievable and 500,000 additional
tons were estimated, totaling 880 kton. Turkey has about 21.4% of the world total.
The first nuclear power plant (NPP) in Turkey, Akkuyu NPP, is under construction,
for which the investment cost is about 20 billion dollars.
The Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR) strategic plan for
201519 goals are to:
1. Deploy indigenous and renewable energy sources at the maximum level;
2. Support the reduction of energy intensity;
3. Use nuclear energy in electricity generation;
4. Minimize waste and environmental impacts of the energy;
5. Reach a competitive energy system, strengthening the country’s strategic position in inter-
national energy trade (MENR, 2016).
The coordinators for objective 4 are the Nuclear Energy Project Implementation
Department (NEPUD) and the General Directorate of Energy Affairs (EIGM). The
Turkish Atomic Energy Authority (TAEK), Electricity Generation Company
(EUAS), Turkish Electricity Transmission Corporation (TEIAS), and Energy
Market Regulatory Authority (EPDK) are the responsible bodies.
The performance indicators for this objective are:

Completion of electricity transmission lines for Akkuyu NPP by the end of 2018;
G
Start-up of Akkuyu NPP for electricity generation (test generation);
G
Start-up of construction for Sinop NPP;
G

Objective 11 in goal 2 is about domestic uranium and thorium resources that
shall be explored and developed for fuel in NPPs. Under the coordination of
NEPUD, the General Directorate of Mining Affairs (MIGEM), General Directorate
of Mineral Research and Exploration (MTA), and ETI Maden General Directorate
(ETI MADEN) are the responsible bodies (MENR, 2016). The completion of
reserve determination studies of uranium and thorium resources and the preparation
of production feasibility studies will be completed by the end of 2019.
Investigations of molten salt reactors and thorium are reported in the literature
by individual researchers at universities in Turkey. The interests of academicians
have been directed toward the theoretical scientific studies. Generally, thorium as
an additive fuel has been considered through neutronic calculations, and some sys-
tems such as heat exchangers have been studied.
An extensive study carried out by Energy Frontiers (ITMSF, 2016) with international
contributions including L. Berrin Erbay, considers the thorium molten-salt nuclear
energy synergetic system (THORIMS-NES). Furukawa et al. (Erbay et al., 1994;
Furukawa et al., 1994, 1995, 2008, 2011, 2012; Erbay, 1997, 2012a; Furukawa and
Erbay, 1997, 2010) described THORIMS-NES as a symbiotic system which is based on
the thoriumuranium-233 cycle; the energy is produced in molten-salt reactors and fis-
sile U-233 is produced by spallation in a breeder accommodated in regional centers.
26.19.2
THORIMS-NES and FUJI
The thorium molten salt nuclear energy system (THORIMS-NES) is a radically
different fuel cycle concept which departs from current fuel cycles:
1. It uses a liquid fuel instead of solid fuel elements;
2. It uses thorium instead of uranium as the fertile element to breed the fissile isotope
U-233;
3. It separates the nuclear power production from the nuclear fuel breeding by proposing a
simple thorium molten salt reactor (Th-MSR) devoted exclusively for energy generation
by burning initially U-235 or Pu-239 and eventually U-233;
4. It proposes an accelerator molten salt breeder (AMSB) devoted exclusively to the produc-
tion of fissile U-233;
5. It will incorporate fuel reprocessing in regional centers.
It is a “symbiotic” system with each function optimized by its simplicity. The
THORIMS-NES concept includes a planned timetable beginning with the construc-
tion of the mini FUJI, a 10 MWe small power reactor, whose purpose is to recover
the know-how that the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) obtained in
196469 with the molten salt reactor experiment (MSRE).
736
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

The rational thorium breeding fuel-cycle system called THORIMS-NES (thorium
molten-salt nuclear energy synergetics) can reduce the quantity of transuranium ele-
ments and recycling fuels produced by all kinds of military, research, and industrial
reactors. A system for the realization of THORIMS-NES has been introduced by
the explanation of relations between facilities. The status of groups working on Th
and the Th fuel cycle has been summarized. The development and launching of
THORIMS-NES requires the following three programs during the next three dec-
ades (Erbay et al., 1994; Furukawa et al., 1994, 1995, 2008, 2011, 2012; Furukawa
and Erbay, 1997, 2010; Erbay, 1997, 2012a):
1. Pilot-plant: miniFUJI (710 MWe);
2. Small power reactor: FUJI-Pu (100300 MWe);
3. Fissile producer: AMSB for globally deploying THORIMS-NES.
The replacement of the present fossil fuel industry by a fission industry needs to be
achieved in the next 3050 years. The fission industry should grow with a 57-year
doubling time. Such a growth rate will never be achieved by any kind of classical
“fission breeding power station” concept. Now a symbiotic system coupling fission
with spallation (or D/T fusion, but not yet proven) should be considered, because
fission is energy-rich but neutron-poor, and spallation is energy-poor but neutron-rich
(Furukawa et al., 2011). The new fissionspallation coupled energy technology
should be sufficiently safe to eliminate the chances of a “severe accident.”
A new, more simplified, highly efficient, economical, and safe molten salt nuclear
power station (MSR) named FUJI is presented, initially constructed from the smaller
reactor mini FUJI (Furukawa et al., 2008). The energy is produced in molten-salt
reactors (FUJI) and fissile U-233 is produced by spallation in accelerator molten-salt
breeders (AMSB). FUJI is size-flexible, and can use all kinds of fissile material,
achieving a nearly fuel self-sustaining condition without continuous chemical proces-
sing of fuel salt and without core-graphite replacement for the life of the reactor. The
AMSB is based on a single-fluid molten-salt target/blanket concept. Several AMSBs
can be accommodated in regional centers for the production of fissile U-233, with
batch chemical processing including radioactive waste management. The FUJI reactor
and the AMSB can also be used for the transmutation of long-lived radioactive ele-
ments in the waste, and it has a high potential for producing hydrogen fuel in molten-
salt reactors (Furukawa et al., 2008). This system uses the multifunctional “single-
phase molten-fluoride” circulation system for all operations. There are no difficulties
relating to “radiation-damage,” “heat-removal,” and “chemical processing” owing to
the simple “idealistic ionic liquid” character of the fuel.
26.19.3
Stirling engines
Power generation by the Stirling heat engine with molten salt reactors has been
proposed and examined by Erbay (1999). In the standard designs of MSRs, the classi-
cal steam cycle is considered for the heat removal system. In her study, the steam-
turbine is replaced with a Stirling heat engine. The hot molten-salt fuel transfers heat
through a heat exchanger (HX) which constitutes the heater (hot-end head) of the
737
Worldwide activities

Stirling engine. The flexibility in size of MSRs makes the use of a Stirling engine pos-
sible instead of the salt/steam cycle. The special properties of the small molten-salt
nuclear reactors and the available designs for Stirling heat engines have been pre-
sented to yield the present capacities and the possibility of an MSRStirling combi-
nation has been discussed (Erbay, 1999). The proposed MSRStirling system yields
a good match for power production from the nuclear source, and therefore gains high-
er public acceptance than other nuclear systems, with little maintenance.
The standard design of FUJI-series molten-salt reactors is completed with the
supercritical steam-turbine for electric generation with a thermal efficiency of
around 45%. On the other hand a Stirling (Str) engine works on the principle of
closed operating chambers, necessities long life designs with minimum maintenance
and requires high temperatures for high efficiencies. When a small MSR is used as
a continuous high-temperature heat source, the combined system turns out to be a
prosperous closed power-producing system. A dish Str engine with a directly illu-
minated tube-type receiver has been considered in the figures in which the receiver
is replaced with an HX (Erbay, 1999).
The figures of merit for the proposed MSRStr combination are summarized as
follows (Erbay, 1999):
1. The pressure of the system is maintained as low as possible throughout the plant. In the
standard design the steam turbine pressure is around 30 MPa. To maximize power,
Stirling engines typically operate at pressure in the range of 520 MPa, which is lower
than that of a standard steam cycle. The achievable temperature is higher in the proposed
Str.
2. The system maintenance and operation are simple and practical, as the Stirling engine is a
single closed unit.
3. The flexibility of the power size is ensured by using parallel Stirling engine sets in the
proposed system.
4. The MSRStr combination utilizes MSR benefits:
a. Reduced radiation damage in the liquid molten-salt fuel and blanket
b. Physicochemical behaviors of molten salts have high predictability
c. The configuration of the reactor is a simple tank
d. The fuel handling is easy
e. There is no core melt down accident;
5. The system directly imports the advantages of Stirling engines, which are the most effi-
cient heat engines, closed operating systems, operate quietly, and require little
maintenance.
6. The proposed system constitutes an almost completely closed power unit, since the MSR
has self-sustaining fuel characteristics without continuous fuel processing, and the Stirling
engine is also a single unit with a closed cycle.
The MSRStr combination merits further development for stationary electricity-
generating plants. The plant thermal performance is limited by the molten-salt fuel
outlet temperature. The required molten-salt fuel outlet temperature depends on the
working fluid type of the Stirling heat engine. He gas is chosen as the working
fluid. The thermal cycle can be considered as a single loop for initial designs, with
the possibility of a two-loop cycle (Erbay, 1999). As the power level increases, the
intense radioactivity of the fuel requires the use of a secondary loop. When the
738
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

MSRStr combined system has two loops, the primary loop exchanges heat with
molten-salt coolant flowing in the secondary loop. In previous studies, the coolant
salt in the secondary loop was NaF-NaBF4 (892 mol%). When low power levels
of Str heat engine designs are considered, a single loop is sufficient.
Since the power level of the MSR is dictated by the heat transfer rate and fuel is
removed outside the reactor by circulation, the design of the hot-end head HX has
particular importance (Erbay, 1999). The heater should have a low volume in order
to minimize the hold-up of fuel salt. Therefore a counterflow compact U-tube
arrangement is preferred (Erbay, 1999). A large heater head has been replaced by
the proposed system with a specialized compact HX. Helium, the working fluid of
the Stirling heat engine, flows inside the tubes of the heater HX and the molten-salt
fuel flows through the shell-side due to the possibility of fission product deposition.
Fouling of the tube walls by fission products should be examined seriously. The
heater is designed to provide good drainage to avoid the accidental freezing of the
molten-salt fuel.
The analysis of alternative combinations for the conceptual design of a power
plant consisting of a molten-salt nuclear reactor (MSR) and Stirling engine has
been discussed by Erbay (2001).
The system has the following problems to be studied in detail (Erbay, 2001):
1. The oscillatory nature of the flow in the heater-head affecting the flow of the liquid in the
secondary loop;
2. Radioactivity of the fluid fuel flowing in the primary loop;
3. Heat exchanger sizing for preventing the hold-up problem;
4. Heater-head design as a heat exchanger for the flows of a molten-salt (Flibe) and He gas
working in the engine;
5. The present power limit of Stirling engines;
6. U-233 production as a fuel for the molten-salt nuclear reactor.
26.19.4
Heat exchangers
The design of the heat exchanger offers solutions for the FUJI—Th-MSR as a safe
reactor (Erbay, 2012b). The design methodology already developed for normal
fluids can be applicable to FUJI. For molten salts flowing in the mini-
microchannels the flow still can be considered as Newtonian; and Navier-Stokes
equations can be applicable by considering the Knudsen number (Erbay, 2012b).
The ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Codes and Standards of Tubular Exchanger
Manufacturers Association (TEMA) are applicable to HXs. The compact arrange-
ments can help reduce the fuel and salt inventory, but the problems of thermal
expansion may intensify (Erbay, 2012b). A careful vision is established by consid-
ering the decrease in the flexibility of mechanical design. The FUJI system pressure
is lower than 0.5 MPa. The FUJI reactor vessel and all mechanical components in
contact with the molten salts use Hastelloy N and graphite.
739
Worldwide activities

The fundamental design methods are summarized by Kac¸ar and Erbay (2013).
Thermodynamic analysis of an HX is presented in terms of irreversibilities and
entropy generation. The irreversibilities are important for HX optimization (Yılmaz
et al., 2013). The effect of internal temperature crossing on the heat transfer and
entropy generation is examined by tackling the 12 TEMA-J shell-and-tube HX
(Yılmaz et al., 2013). The effect of the inlet temperature of the cold fluid on the
thermal performance of two minichannel flat-tubes with multilouvered fin compact
HXs has been studied experimentally by Do˘gan and Erbay (2016).
In general, studies carried out by researchers have the purpose of thorium utiliza-
tion in a hybrid reactor or a symbiotic system due to environmental concerns as
well as to energy economics.
26.19.5
Fusionfission hybrid reactors and
nonproliferation
The potential of a moderated fusionfission hybrid reactor fueled with ThC2 or
ThF4 is investigated by Yapıcı et al. (2000) assuming a plant factor (PF) of 75%
under a first wall fusion neutron current load of 5 MW/m2. LWR (light water reac-
tor) fuel rods containing ThC2 or ThF4 are placed in the fissile fuel zone of the
hybrid reactor. The behavior of the neutronic is observed for 4 years. At the end of
the operation period, the cumulative fissile fuel enrichment (CFFE) values varied
between 3.55% and 7% depending on the fuel and coolant type. Yapıcı et al. (2000)
indicated that the best neutronic performance is obtained with FliBe, followed by
air and natural lithium coolants; after 48 months, the maximum CFFE value is 7%
in the ThF4 fuel and FliBe coolant mode, and the lowest CFFE value 3.55% is in
the ThC2 fuel and natural lithium coolant mode. Consequently, these enrichments
would be sufficient for LWRs, and the lowest radial neutron leakage out of the
blanket is with the FLiBe coolant modes.
In a thorium fusion breeder the production of denaturated fissile fuel by mixing
the fertile fuel with natural-UO2 and LWR spent nuclear fuel has been investigated
by ¸Sahin et al. (2001). Four different coolants (helium, Flibe, natural lithium, and
Li17Pb83 eutectic) are considered. In order to obtain a power flattening in the
fissile-fertile zone, the UO2-fraction or the spent fuel fraction in the mixed oxide
(MOX) fuel has been gradually increased in radial direction. Power plant operation
periods between 13 and 29 months are evaluated. ¸Sahin et al. (2001) concluded that
the U-238 component of natural-UO2 can provide a limited proliferation hardening
only for the U-233 component, whereas, the homogeneous mixture of ThO2 with a
small quantity of (.4%) LWR spent nuclear fuel remains nonproliferational for
both uranium and plutonium components.
¸Sahin et al. (2002) have performed a neutronic analysis for a thorium fusion
breeder to burn minor actinides and to produce U-233, Pu-238, Am-242, and
Cm-245 for spacecraft application. Natural lithium has been selected as the fuel
zone coolant. Minor actinides from 5 to 10 units of LWRs per meter of blanket
740
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

height have been mixed with ThO2. This has significant advantages with respect to
plant operation and uniform utilization of the nuclear fuel in the fissile zone. A neu-
tronic analysis has been performed by ¸Sahin et al. (2004) to assess a prospective
utilization of light-water reactor (LWR) spent fuel in deuterium uranium reactors
mixed with thoria (ThO2), hence to open the extended utilization of worldwide dis-
posed spent nuclear fuel from CANDU reactors.
Yapıcı and Bayrak (2005) have studied how to denature nuclear weapon-grade
plutonium in a thorium fusion breeder. Ten fuel rods containing a mixture of ThO2
and PuO2 are placed in the radial direction in the fissile zone where ThO2 is mixed
with variable amounts of PuO2 to obtain a quasiconstant nuclear heat production
density. The plutonium composition volume fractions in the fuel rods are gradually
increased from 0.1% to 1% in 0.1% increments. The fissile fuel zone is cooled with
the four coolants with a volume fraction ratio of 1. Yapıcı and Bayrak (2005) noted
that the energy multiplication factor M changed between 2.1731 and 6.6241
depending on coolant type during the operation period.
Some quantities of plutonium have been accumulated in the nuclear waste of
civilian LWRs and CANDU reactors. ¸Sahin et al. (2006) indicated that reactor-
grade plutonium can be used as a booster fissile fuel material in the form of mixed
ThO2/PuO2 fuel in a CANDU fuel bundle, in order to assure reactor criticality.
They investigated the prospects of exploiting the rich world thorium reserves in
CANDU reactors. In the study two different fuel compositions were selected for
investigations: (1) 96% thoria (ThO2) 1 4% PuO2 and (2) 91% ThO2 1 5%
UO2 1 4% PuO2. The latter is used for the purpose of denaturing the new 233U fuel
with U-238. They observed the behavior of the reactor criticality kN and the burn-
up values of the reactor during full-power operation for .B8 years; the reactor
starts with kN 5 B1.39 and decreases asymptotically to values of kN . 1.06, which
are still tolerable and useable in a CANDU reactor. The reactor criticality kN
remains nearly constant between the fourth and seventh years of plant operation,
and then, a slight increase is observed thereafter, along with a continuous depletion
of the thorium fuel. After the second year, the CANDU reactor begins to operate
practically as a thorium burner; very high burn-up can be achieved with the same
fuel (.160,000 MW D/MT). The reactor criticality would be sufficient until a great
fraction of the thorium fuel is burned up, provided that the fuel rods could be fabri-
cated to withstand such high burn-up levels. Fuel fabrication costs and nuclear
waste mass for final disposal per unit energy could be reduced drastically.
A new fusion reactor APEX uses a liquid wall between the fusion plasma and
the solid first wall for either tritium breeding or energy transfer. This liquid wall
also allows using high neutron wall loads and reduces the radiation damage at the
first wall to obtain high performance for the reactor. High quality of fissile fuel U-
233 production has been studied by U¨ beyli and Yalc¸ın (2008) to get an additional
improvement in APEX. This can be obtained by using salts containing fissionable
isotopes as a liquid wall in fusion blankets with respect to energy multiplication
and fissile fuel breeding.
For a new reactor type, a so-called fixed bed nuclear reactor (FBNR), ¸Sahin
et al. (2009) investigated prospective fuels including Th with respect to reactor

criticality. The reactor criticality has lower values with uranium fuel, and there is
increased production of minor actinides, reactor-grade plutonium, and weapon-
grade plutonium, as expected.
A pebble bed modular reactor (PBMR) was also considered for different fuels
including thorium compounds. Acır and Co¸skun (2012) have investigated the time
evolution of criticality and burn-up grades of the PBMR for reactor-grade pluto-
nium and minor actinides in the spent fuel of LWRs mixed with thoria. First the
plutoniumthorium and minor actinidesthorium ratios were determined using the
initial keff value of the original uranium fuel design. Then the time-dependent neu-
tronic behavior of the reactor-grade plutonium and minor actinides and original
fuels in a PBMR-400 reactor was calculated. The core lives for the original, the
reactor-grade plutonium/thorium, and the minor actinide/thorium fuels were calcu-
lated by Acır and Co¸skun (2012) at B3.2, B6.5, and B5.5 years, whereas the cor-
responding burn-ups came out to be 99,000, B190,000, and B166,000 MWD/T,
respectively, for an end of life keff set equal to 1.02.
Different types of nuclear fuels including thorium have been studied in a gas
turbine-modular helium reactor (GTMHR). ¸Sahin and Erol (2012) have considered
two different types of nuclear fuels acquired from the reactor operations combined
with thorium, and also considered a GTMHR. Performances were compared with
the uranium fuel designed for this reactor. Nuclear fuels are 50% ThO250%
RGrPuO2 and 10% ThO290% RGrPuO2 uranium (original) fuel. Operation time
(i.e., the time passed until the keff value reached a level of 1.02 for original fuel),
MA, 50% ThO250% RGrPu and 10% ThO290% RGrPu mixtures were found by
¸Sahin and Erol (2012) to be 515, 565, 765, and 2315 days with burn-up values of
47.7, 71.94, 75.1, and 213.4 GWd/MTU, respectively.
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory studied a laser inertial confinement
fusion fission energy (LIFE) hybrid fusionfission nuclear energy system to gener-
ate power and burn nuclear waste. ¸Sahin et al. (2014) investigates the main para-
meters of a LIFE-driven thorium breeder. A blanket similar to the LIFE engine
design is chosen in order to allow mutual feedback between the two geographically
separated teams towards a more advanced and improved design with independent
views. ThO2 has been suspended in the form of microsize tristructural-isotropic
(TRISO) particles in the lithium coolant for U-233 breeding. The blanket energy
multiplication M increases with thorium volume fraction, namely as M 5 1.2206,
1.2322, 1.2426, 1.2536, 1.2636, 1.3112 for respective TRISO volume fractions due
to the contribution of fission energy. Fissile fuel productions in the blanket were
calculated as 17.23, 33.09, 48.66, 64.21, 79.77, and 159.71 233U (kg/year), respec-
tively, by ¸Sahin et al. (2014).
Accelerators can be used to produce fissile isotope U-233 from thorium. ¸Sahin
et al. (2015) have analyzed the integral U-233 and 239Pu breeding rates, neutron
multiplication ratio through (nxn)- and fission-reactions, heat release, energy multi-
plication, and consequently the energy gain factor in infinite size thorium and ura-
nium as breeder material in accelerator driven systems (ADS). The irradiation is
supplied by a 1-GeV proton source. Fissile fuel material production is calculated as
53 232Th(n,g) U-233, 80.24 and 90.65 238U(n,g) 239Pu atoms per incident proton,

respectively. They noted that the neutron spectrum maximum is by B1 MeV and
lower energy neutrons E , 1 MeV have a major contribution to fissile fuel material
breeding (.97.5%), where as the share on energy multiplication is negligible
(0.2%) for thorium, depleted uranium.

The UK started a program on molten salt reactors around 1970, inspired by the US
MSRE program. There was close contact with the US group and opportunities to
collaborate with France were explored. The program culminated in an extraordi-
narily ambitious conceptual design for a reactor as follows:
G
Pumped molten salt system operating without moderator in a fast spectrum;
G
Uranium/plutonium/sodium chloride fuel system with uranium/sodium chloride breeding
blanket;
G
Electrical power of 2500 MW;
G
Output temperature from the core of 1050C;
G
Helium as secondary coolant linked to gas turbine systems for power generation.
744
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

Substantial work was also carried out on the fuel cycle, materials requirements,
and other aspects. The reports are available for inspection at the UK National
Archives at Kew. The key report is AEEW R1059 “Conceptual design and assess-
ment of a helium cooled, 2500 MWe molten salt fast reactor with integrated gas
turbine plant,” which is located in AB 35/72. Further useful documents are avail-
able in the National Archive.
The original program was terminated about the same time as the US MSR pro-
gram and no further work on molten salt reactors took place in the UK until Moltex
Energy began development of reactors based on static molten salt fuels in 2013 (see
Chapter 14: Static liquid fuel reactors and Chapter 21: Stable salt fast reactor).
The only UK government-funded project relating to molten salt reactors in recent
times was a study on MSRs completed in July 2015 by Energy Process
Developments. The report (http://www.energyprocessdevelopments.com/uploads/EPD
%20MSR%20Review%20Feasibility%20Study%20July%202015%201.02.pdf)
sum-
marizes MSR activity internationally. It looks at the feasibility of developing a pilot-
scale demonstration MSR in the UK. A review of potential UK sites is given along
with an insight into the UK regulatory process for innovative reactor technology. The
technical review of six MSR designs led to the selection of the stable salt reactor,
designed by Moltex Energy, as most suitable for UK implementation (http://www.
energyprocessdevelopments.com/uploads/Selection_of_Moltex_SSR.pdf).
While government-funded work on molten salt reactors ended in the mid-1970s,
work on nuclear fuel reprocessing using molten salts did continue. In the 1960s
there was an active program on electrowinning of uranium from spent Magnox
fuel. Through the 1970s and 1990s small laboratory-scale projects were carried out
at British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL), generally in the context of larger European
collaborations, and with a focus on the pyro-processing concepts developed at
Argonne National Laboratory. In the early 2000s and prior to the UK withdrawal
from active engagement within the Generation IV International Forum in 2006, the
UK had a significant program of research on molten salt electrorefining process
technology that included engineering, fundamental science, and experimental
infrastructure investment; key to this was a Molten Salts Dynamics Rig (MSDR)
that is no longer operational (Banfield et al., 2005). The MSDR was a one-of-a-
kind pilot-scale test facility fitted with three pumping options and a lithium
chloride-potassium chloride eutectic (LKE) salt inventory of approximately 120 kg.
Since 2006, the UK, through the National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) and
University of Manchester, has maintained skills and expertise in molten salt-based
recycling technology through collaborative European projects, such as ACSEPT,
SACSESS, and ASGARD (Bourg et al., 2011, XXXX; Roadmap-Actinide
Separation Processes 2015). In 2011, a 4-year UK EPSRC (Engineering and
Physical Sciences Research Council)-sponsored program commenced focusing
on direct electrochemical reduction, electrorefining, and speciation and analysis:
this REFINE program was the largest program of molten salts work in the UK
up to 2016, led by the University of Edinburgh with partners from the
Universities of Manchester, Nottingham, Cambridge, and University College
London and NNL. A review of the status as of 2011 is available as IAEA Nuclear

In 2013, the UK government published its Nuclear Industry Strategy with a
vision for nuclear energy in the UK to play a significant role in delivering a secure,
sustainable and affordable low-carbon energy future, and in 2014 established the
Nuclear Innovation and Research Advisory Board (NIRAB) to advise on the
approach and coordination of nuclear innovation, research, and development that
will keep future energy options open and enable commercial opportunities to be
realized. NIRAB have concluded that there is a clear gap in the UK’s R&D activity
into next-generation nuclear reactor technologies, including SMRs and Generation
IV reactors, and their associated fuel cycles. The government announced that it
intended to re-invigorate the UK nuclear fission research capability, and d250
million was earmarked for this purpose in 2015. The NIRAB recommendations
suggested development of UK skills and capabilities for a range of advanced reactor
systems
(http://www.nirab.org.uk/media/6233/uk-nuclear-innovation-and-research-
programme-recommendations.pdf).
In 2016, the UK government announced a “small modular reactor” competition
aimed at selecting a new nuclear technology, in which the UK could take a leading
development role. While the competition was originally conceived as relating to
small modular PWRs, a number of molten salt reactors were entered into the
competition.
In early 2017, UK activity in the molten salt reactor field is most significant in
the private sector through Moltex Energy LLP, though a number of universities,
including the Universities of Manchester and Cambridge, have started academic
programs focused around the new concept of static molten salt fuels.

Introduction
From the USSR, Ukraine has inherited a huge amount of nuclear weapons, the
ruined fourth unit of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, and 16 PWR units that
provide half of the electric power in the country. While the nuclear weapons were
transferred abroad under the guarantee of security, Chernobyl is in the process of
becoming a nuclear waste storage site. The planned decommissioning of the major-
ity of PWR units (mainly of generation II) is expected before 2030. Taking into
account that many institutions and plants in Ukraine were involved in the nuclear
projects of the USSR, that one-sixth of explored world uranium reserves and a lot
of other raw materials for the nuclear construction materials belong to Ukraine, we
are not an ordinary user of nuclear technologies. Ukraine has good prospects for
nuclear industrial development as a partner in the world community. The explored
uranium reserves would be sufficient to provide the PWR fuel for the next 150
years. Therefore it was proposed (Paton et al., 2008) to develop a two-level nuclear
engineering structure in Ukraine during the transition to Gen-IV. The PWR units
constitute the first level. The second level is heavy water reactors (HWR) with the
fuel cycles oriented towards burning the spent nuclear fuel of PWRs and incinerat-
ing radiotoxic isotopes. Later, when MSR technologies are developed, they will be
implemented in Ukraine. Since the MSR technologies are more promising but less
advanced compared with the HWR technologies, they need a long-term R&D pro-
gram, which currently is being formed by the world community.
Structural materials for MSR is one of the key problems of this program. Since
there are many institutions and experts working in this field in Ukraine, the project
“Research and development of fuel and construction materials for accelerator-
driven plutonium disposal and nuclear waste transmutation systems using molten
salt fluoride blankets” was proposed by the researchers at the National Science
Center Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology in partnership with the Pacific
Northwest National Laboratory (USA). This project was approved for financing by
the STCU in 2003.
As a rule, promising construction materials have to be tested in reactors using
special loops reproducing all the conditions of a real MSR. Experiments of this
type take a lot of time and need special techniques and testing procedures. The idea
of the project was to imitate the reactor conditions of material corrosion using elec-
tron irradiation. The important point is the relevance of the data obtained in the
simulation experiments to the behavior of the material in reactor conditions. This
problem needs special investigations, which were performed within the project
framework. These investigations are based on the fact that the nature of kinetic
747
Worldwide activities

processes induced, modified, and activated by irradiation is very similar on the
microscopic level regardless of the type of irradiation. For this reason, the investi-
gation of the kinetic processes under electron irradiation gives valuable information,
which can be used for prediction of materials behavior in reactors, using the proper
rescaling of the kinetic coefficients.
A special remark concerning the corrosion kinetics in surface layers has to be
made. The corrosion is controlled by chemical reactions. The reaction rate is sensitive
to the local energy deposition due to irradiation. The irradiation excites the electron
states and can produce atomic replacements and displacements. These radiation-
induced elementary processes need excitation energy from one to tens of electron-
volt per atom. Accelerated electrons and γ-quanta are ideal agents for activation of
the corrosion kinetics at a comparatively low rate of replacements and displacements
of atoms. Therefore an electron accelerator of proper energy (10 MeV/electron) was
chosen to imitate the impact of the reactor irradiation on the corrosion kinetics.
Concurrently, the electron irradiation impacts diffusion and phase transformations in
the bulk and, especially, within the grain boundaries.
The corrosion tests in metallic melts and salts without irradiation provide a refer-
ence database and allow estimating of thermodynamic driving forces controlling the
corrosion and aging kinetics.
26.21.2
Methodology
26.21.2.1
Electron irradiation test facility (EITF)
Some helpful features of the electron irradiation are:
1. Since the energetic thresholds of nuclear reactions induced by electrons and γ-rays are
nearly 10 MeV or somewhat less, the use of electron beams with the energy of 10 MeV
avoids considerable radioactivity of the irradiated materials, so hot cells are not needed in
postirradiation investigations of the materials.
2. The penetration length of electrons with an energy of 10 MeV is of some centimeters. On
this length scale the electron energy decreases from 10 to 1 MeV or even less due to the
bremsstrahlung and other inelastic processes. This means that, on the one hand, the test
ampoules can have reasonable size to mimic large-scale experiments and, on the other
hand, the irradiation conditions are dramatically changing on a comparatively small
length. Therefore we can use many metallic specimens of submillimeter thickness within
one ampoule to investigate the dependence of corrosion and radiation damage processes
versus energy deposited by e- and γ-fields.
3. The electron beam can be used as an efficient heater of the irradiated target to maintain
the needed temperature if the electron beam power, target geometry, and construction are
properly chosen.
The irradiation cell and general view of the EITF are represented in
Figs. 26.21.1 and 26.21.2. The construction of the irradiated ampoule with tested
specimens immersed into molten salt is also shown. The surface layers of the speci-
mens S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6 are indicated.

Figure 26.21.1 Construction of the irradiation cell of the EITF-KIPT. On the later section of
the specimens their surfaces are marked by symbols S1S6. Due to stopping of electrons the
deposited energy within the surface layer considerably decreases with the layer number
increasing. In particular, the deposited S1 energy is 50 times larger than that in the layer S6.
749
Worldwide activities

Surface layers of the specimens are marked by letters S1S6. Due to the gradual
stopping of the electron beam, the deposited energy, Ed (S1), in the first surface
layer is much larger than that in the last layer, Ed (S6). Computer simulations
(Bakai and Garner, 2005) show that during a 700-hour experiment Ed (S1) 
6200 eV/atom, while Ed (S6)  120 eV/atom. In layers S2S5 this quantity assumes
intermediate values. Such ampoule construction allows one to investigate corrosion
kinetics over a wide range of irradiation rates in just one irradiation session.
26.21.2.2
Simulations of the e- and γ-fields and the deposited
energy distribution
The electron and γ-radiation field magnitudes, the spatial profiles of energy deposi-
tion onto the molten salt and the samples, as well as the rates of point defect gener-
ation in the specimens have been evaluated by means of numerical simulations of
radiation transport in the test bench geometry. The results of such simulations may
be used to optimize the ampoule construction and provide quantitative predictions
for the specimen properties versus the irradiation dose.
26.21.2.3
Temperature distribution
The equation of heat balance that takes into account the total deposited energy and
the radiation heat losses from the ampoule’s surface was used to estimate the ther-
mal balance inside of the irradiated target. To calculate the temperature distribution
within the ampoule, the spatial density of the deposited energy was used as an input
and then the heat transport equation was solved. The calculations performed show
that the temperature variance within the ampoules is very small.
26.21.2.4
Mechanical tests
The changes of the macroscopic mechanical properties due to the presence of the
molten fluoride salts or metallic coolants were revealed by standard mechanical
tests including nanoindentations. Indentation is an informative tool providing infor-
mation about the changes to the mechanical properties of the corroded surface
layers of the irradiated specimens.
Additionally, investigations of the impact of the ultrasonic vibrations on the
tested material were performed and provided information on the inner friction and
materials’ sensitivity to high-frequency fatigue.
26.21.2.5
Structural and compositional analysis
The compositional, structural, and phase changes were investigated by means of
advanced diffraction and microscopy techniques that reveal structure, composition,
and precipitation on the macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic scales.

26.21.2.6
Corrosion tests
Corrosion of alloys and their constituents in a molten eutectic NaF-ZrF4 fluoride
mixture has been studied by cyclic voltammetry, X-ray analysis, scanning electron
microscopy, and metallography. The corrosion rates of the samples exposed in salt
at 650C for different times were measured afterwards in a fresh molten salt by the
volt-ampere method. This way the impact of the electron irradiation on the corro-
sion rate of the alloys in molten fluorides has been measured.
26.21.2.7
X-ray spectroscopy
After irradiation by 10 MeV electrons a small number of nuclear reactions occur,
leading to the formation of γ-active nuclei. This gives a possibility to register the
products of the alloys corrosion in the molten salt by performing γ-spectroscopy of
the used salt. Although this method does not produce a proper quantitative composi-
tional analysis, it gives a semiquantitative and qualitative information about the sol-
ubility of alloy components in the molten salt.
26.21.2.8
Theoretical models
Quantitative analysis of the experimental data calls for the development of appro-
priate theoretical models. The main goal is to describe the corrosion and phase
transformation kinetics under the impact of electron irradiation. To the author’s
knowledge, this problem has not yet been solved.
26.21.2.9
Thermodynamics of Zr in alkali halide melts
Equilibrium constants determine the thermodynamic forces responsible for chemical
reactions and dissolution of alloys. Since Zr and alkali metals are the basic elements
of all fluoride salts used in MSR, it is important to know their thermodynamic
characteristics. Investigations of the thermodynamics of Zr in alkali melts were
performed within the framework of this project.

Ni-Mo alloys (Hastelloys), similar to those that had already shown satisfactory cor-
rosion resistance in contact with molten fluoride salts NaF-ZrF4 and ZrF4-LiF-BeF
at temperatures of 600800C in earlier experiments, were prepared and used.

Worldwide activities

Since comparatively small compositional changes of alloys can lead to a consider-
able decrease or increase in the corrosion resistance, two compositions of the
Ni-Mo alloys (Alloy A and Alloy B) were chosen after some analysis of the corro-
sion data previously obtained by others. The nominal compositions of these alloys
are shown in Table 26.21.1. It is noteworthy that yttrium was added to Alloy B to
improve the grain boundary corrosion resistance. Compounds of high purity were
used to exclude the impact of uncontrolled impurities.
26.21.3.3
Carboncarbon composite
CC composites with good mechanical properties and low chemical activity in
contact with fluoride salts were chosen as materials for the ampoules. Tests of the
corrosion resistance of these materials in molten salts under irradiation in EITF pro-
vided quantitative results on their corrosive properties.

Results of the CC composite tests
Tests show that exposure to the molten salt, with or without e-irradiation at 650C,
does not change the properties and composition of the tested specimens and
ampoules. It looks like the test conditions were not “hard” enough to initiate
destruction of this material.

Impact of the NaF-ZrF4 molten salt and e-irradiation
on the properties of alloys A and B
Our data show that:
G
Irradiation heavily impacts the corrosion rate;
G
Corrosion resistivity is rather sensitive to small compositional changes. Alloys A and B
have minor compositional differences but their corrosion resistivities with and without
irradiation are considerably different. Besides, the corrosion rate of Alloy B is more sensi-
tive to the deposited energy Ed;
G
Impurities of La in the NaF-ZrF4 molten salt enhance the corrosion of Alloy A, even with-
out irradiation.
The corrosion rates of Alloy A and Alloy B versus the exposure time and depos-
ited energy Ed are given in Fig. 26.21.3.
As can be seen, the corrosion rate of Alloy B under irradiation increases
B103 times, while in the case of Alloy A the energy deposition rate does not play
such a significant role.
In the bremsstrahlung X-ray spectrum of electrons with energy of the order of
10 MeV the comparatively soft γ-quanta with energy less than 1 MeV dominate.
Therefore, the generation of point defects is weak even at high levels of deposited
energy. Calculations show that at Ed 5 6200, 2120 eV/atom, atomic displacements
range from B1022 to 1023 per atom (Bakai and Garner, 2005).
The energy deposited in the fluoride salt is several times smaller than that in the
Hastelloy specimens. Nevertheless, it is large enough to impact the chemical

reaction rates. Apparently ionization and activation of atoms under irradiation
within and near the surface layers of the alloy are the main cause of the acceleration
of corrosion kinetics.
Different sensitivities of Alloys A and B to the deposited energy rate show that
the alloying additions (like yttrium and niobium) have an essential impact on the
corrosion resistance. Therefore, the search for optimal compositions of the Ni-based
structural alloys has to be continued in varied environments and at a range of irradi-
ation intensities.
Postirradiation mechanical tests of the samples prove their high strength and
plasticity. Microanalysis reveals Cr depletion and Ti enrichment in the surface
layers, as well as penetration of zirconium and sodium into the samples. The thick-
ness of the layers with considerable changes in composition is about 40 μm.
Our tests have demonstrated that the corrosion resistance of both alloys is
acceptable but that Alloy B shows better properties.

Summary
At least 100 experts from a number of labs in Ukraine and abroad were involved in
the EITF tests of the materials for MSR, investigations of their properties before
and after irradiation, and attempts to design better material compositions. Results of
their efforts are published in Paton et al. (2008), Bakai and Garner (2005), Bakai
(2008), Wanderka et al. (2007), Volkov et al. (2006), and other papers. This work
was stopped due to lack of funds caused by comparatively slow progress in the
development of the overall MSR program. However, the methodology of the MSR
structural materials assessment developed in the KIPT-EITF project proved to be
remarkably efficient. It is fast, cheap in comparison with the traditional in-pile tests,
and surely deserves further development and use in combination with other
approaches in the R&D of MSR structural materials.

and a reception honoring the pioneers of MSR technology. The MSRE, designed to
assess the viability of liquid fuel reactor technologies for use in commercial power
generation, operated from January 1965 through December 1969, logging more than
13,000 hours at full power during its four-year run.
Researchers at ORNL will participate in two new DOE-funded $6 million projects
to develop advanced nuclear reactor technologies. Industry-led teams will include
participants from universities and national laboratories.

CRADA
The Chinese Academy of Science’s (CAS) Shanghai Institute of Applied Physics
(SINAP) and the US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Oak Ridge National
Laboratory (ORNL) have recently entered into a Cooperative Research and
Development Agreement (CRADA) to accelerate the development of fluoride salt-
cooled high-temperature reactors (FHRs). The CRADA evolved from USChina
interactions under a Memorandum of Understanding between the DOE and the
CAS on Cooperation in Nuclear Energy Sciences and Technologies. The DOE-NE
Office of Advanced Reactor Technologies (ART) is currently supporting FHR
development primarily through its nuclear energy university program (NEUP).
The CRADA supports and is funded by SINAP’s thorium molten salt reactor
(TMSR) program. The overall purpose for SINAP’s TMSR program is to develop
molten salt reactor technology to supply energy to the growing Chinese economy.
The CRADA is limited to solid-fueled MSRs, but recognizes that nearly all of the
technology developed will be applicable to liquid fuel MSRs. The FHR test reactors
currently being planned will use low-enriched uranium fuel.
Developing a common understanding of the safety characteristics and conse-
quent regulatory requirements decreases the development risk. The approved first
phase tasks of the CRADA are:
1. To commission ORNL’s liquid salt test loop and use it for pebble bed heat transfer testing;
2. To perform component evaluation and testing;
3. To provide analysis software support;
4. To develop and participate in international FHR training activities;
5. To exchange technical information on FHR supportive technologies.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Charles Forsberg
MIT has been developing a fluoride-salt-cooled high-temperature reactor (FHR)
with a nuclear ir-Brayton combined cycle (NACC) and firebrick resistance-heated
energy storage (FIRES). The goals are to:
756
Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

1. Improve nuclear power plant economics by 50%100% relative to a base-load nuclear
power plant;
2. Develop technology for a zero-carbon nuclear/renewables electricity grid by providing
dispatchable power;
3. Eliminate major fuel failures and consequent potential for major offsite radionuclide
releases in a beyond-design basis accident.
The concept of the FHR is more than a decade old (Gat et al., 1992). An inte-
grated research project led by the author at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) and including the University of California at Berkeley (UCB),
and the University of Wisconsin (UW) has completed a 3-year study (analysis and
experiments) to develop the concept and develop a pathway to commercialization.
Since the FHR inception there has been growing interest at universities and national
laboratories—and a decision by the Chinese Academy of Science to build a
10 MWt test reactor by 2020.
It is the coupling of high-temperature nuclear reactor and gas turbine technolo-
gies that results in the transformational characteristics of an FHR with NACC and
FIRES. MIT, UCB, and UW have developed an FHR path forward including a
commercialization strategy (Sorensen, 2014), an FHR point design—a Mark-1
pebble-bed FHR (Mk1 PB-FHR) (Chvala, 2014), and a test reactor strategy (http://
web.utk.edu/Bochvala/MSR/Seminars/). Fig. 26.22.1 shows the Mk1 PB-FHR and
its NACC power conversion system.
The pebble-bed fuel is similar to that originally developed in Germany and now
used in China for their HTGRs, but the pebble size has been reduced to 3-cm diam-
eter spheres to enable a higher power density. Like the HTGR pebble bed reactors,

the pebbles flow through the reactor core to allow online refueling. The coolant is
Flibe (7Li2BeF4), the same coolant proposed for many molten-salt reactors (MSRs)
except in an FHR it is clean salt, to minimize corrosion and radiation doses in
coolant piping. The solid fuel FHR concept is discussed in Chapter 13, Solid fuel,
salt-cooled reactors; the NACC and FIRES concepts are described in Chapter 2,
Electricity production; and the Chinese TMSR is described in Chapter 17, Thorium
molten salt reactor nuclear energy system (TMSR).

The Compact Integral Effects Test (CIET 1.0) facility is a primary component of
the UCB Thermal Hydraulics Laboratory’s (TH Lab’s) mission to develop the sci-
entific and technical basis to design and license fluoride-salt-cooled, high-
temperature reactors (FHRs). Along with the other experiments and projects in the
UCB TH Lab, the CIET 1.0 facility is part of an experimental test program to vali-
date simulation codes for applications to FHRs. The capability to validate integral
transient response models is a key issue for licensing new reactor designs, and
CIET 1.0 as well as future iterations of the facility will be critical for providing the
validation data to accomplish this.
Currently, the three key missions of the CIET facility are:
1. To provide experimental validation data for system-level thermal hydraulic codes that are
used by the NRC and other nuclear regulatory agencies for licensing;
2. To serve as an advanced reactor test bed for advanced reactor control strategies, particu-
larly for cybersecurity strategy;
3. To provide a high-quality user experience to train operators, designers, and regulators on
the safe construction and operation of FHRs.
CIET 1.0 is the first integral effects test (IET) facility to study FHRs, and is
designed and constructed to reproduce the integral transient thermal hydraulic
response of FHRs (Fig. 26.22.2) under forced and natural circulation operation.
CIET 1.0 provides data to validate simulation codes for direct reactor auxiliary
cooling systems (DRACS), used for natural-circulation-driven decay heat removal
in FHRs. CIET 1.0 is designed to replicate an FHR transient response for a wide
range of licensing basis events (LBEs).
The CIET 1.0 facility uses Dowtherm A oil as a simulant fluid for fluoride salts,
because at relatively low temperatures (50120C), Dowtherm can match the
Prandtl, Reynolds, and Grashof numbers of the major liquid salts simultaneously, at
approximately 50% geometric scale and heater power under 2% of prototypical
conditions. CIET 1.0 was scaled based on the earlier design of a 900-MWth chan-
nel-type pebble bed advanced high-temperature reactor. Subsequently, UCB devel-
oped a new, preconceptual design of a 236-MWth Mark 1 pebble bed FHR (Mk1
PB-FHR), after the scaling and design of CIET 1.0 were finalized. The scaled ele-
vations of the main heat sources and sinks in CIET 1.0 and the Mk1 PB-FHR
design have reasonable agreement, as shown below.

Key phenomena include heat transfer, phase change, and single and multiphase
flows in water, gas, molten salt, and liquid metal coolants for advanced fission and
fusion systems, as well as transport and mixing processes that occur inside reactor
containment structures and in environmental systems. Experimental facilities
include the CIET; the X-ray Pebble Recirculation Experiment, which performs 3-D
X-ray tomography of pebble beds; and smaller separate effect tests studying con-
vective heat transport and thermo-photovoltaic power conversion.

waste management for fuel cycles of the uraniumplutonium metal fuel-based inte-
gral fast reactor (IFR) and the thoriumuranium fluoride salt fuel-based molten salt
reactor. In the MSR, thorium fluoride is dissolved in LiF-BeF2 (Flibe) and is trans-
muted to protactinium fluoride, which decays to U-233. The Utah group specializes
in studying electrochemical and pyrochemical processes with these salts, develop-
ing technology to monitor the composition of the salts in real time; conceptual safe-
guard approaches to virtually eliminate the potential for diversion of plutonium
from nuclear fuel processing facilities; and compact, durable waste forms to enable
safe permanent disposal of waste from nuclear reactors.

Penn State University
Hojong Kim
Penn State researchers study electrochemical separation of alkali/alkaline-earths (Ba,
Sr, and Cs) in liquid metals. One key challenge is the accumulation of fission pro-
ducts (e.g., alkali/alkaline-earth and rare-earth elements) in the molten salt electrolyte,
which changes the electrolyte properties and diminishes the performance efficiency
of an electrorefiner. The accumulation of the alkali/alkaline-earth elements (e.g., Cs
and Sr) with short half-lives (B30 years) can cause high decay power densities and
costly thermal management storage solutions. Advanced separation methods for fis-
sion product removal are needed to minimize the nuclear waste volume and decay
heat. Electrochemical separation of these alkali/alkaline-earth elements from the mol-
ten salt electrolyte may use liquid metal electrodes (e.g., Bi) that can selectively dis-
solve alkali/alkaline-earth metals (Cs, Sr, and Ba) by utilizing strong atomic
interactions between these fission products and liquid metal electrodes. The goal is to
enable salt recycling by electrochemical separation of fission products and reduce the
volume of the nuclear waste by concentrating alkali/alkaline-earths into chloride-free,
metallic form which can be easily converted to oxides for storage.

MUST is studying initial fuel possibilities for the TMSR. Considering the possibil-

fuel for MSRs using the TMSR. U-235 and Pu-239 will then be tested as
suitable initial fuels for the first fleet of TMSRs. These fuels are compared to the
reference data based on neutron flux spectra and breeding capabilities.
Using MCNP, a TMSR using U-233 for the initial and operating fuel was bench-
marked, based on the data presented by Billebaud Annick and her team at the
Laboratory for Subatomic Particles and Cosmology in France. The neutron energy
spectrum of U-233 was compared with those of U-235 and Pu-239 to analyze non-
proliferation concerns. In addition to the reduction of nuclear warhead stockpiles,
incorporating U-235 and Pu-239 into the first fleet of TMSRs will facilitate startup
without an initial load of U-233.

Introduction
Nuclear physics began in Venezuela with the Eisenhower program “Atoms for
Peace” within which a nuclear research reactor RV 1 was contracted and built
(195660) during the dictatorship of General Marcos Perez Jimenez and the follow-
ing transition to democratic government in 1958. The reactor was operated in the
Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificas (IVIC) as a service facility for a
mainly biology and medically oriented institute with no real interest or vocation for
nuclear physics. However, the institute’s library was designated a repository of US
Atomic Energy Agency publications, becoming a valuable source of information.
However, after successive ups and downs in the policy towards nuclear physics by
765
Worldwide activities

the institute’s directors, the reactor was finally shut down (1991) in a “reversible
manner” and the core fuel, 20% enriched uranium, was dismantled and returned to
the US. In spite of the closure of an important sector with the decommissioning of
the Venezuela Research reactor RV 1, there has been renewed interest in accelera-
tors for medical uses and applications of nuclear techniques for industrial purposes.
These activities were also reinforced by technical cooperation agreements with the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna, Austria.
During the 1970s the official interest in atomic energy was expressed by the cre-
ation of the “Consejo Nacional Nuclear” (CONAN), later converted to “Consejo
Nacional para Desarrollo de la Industria Nuclear” (CONADIN) and eventually to
the present DEA or “Direccio´n de Energia Atomica.” This institution became the
Venezuelan counterpart of the IAEA. It had plans for the introduction of atomic
power in Venezuela by the mid-1990s. It carried out modest surveying activities in
the search for uranium deposits in the country, which yielded no results. However,
a large deposit, Cerro Impacto (Aarden et al., 1973) containing thorium, niobium,
rare earths, and other elements was discovered, placing the country in seventh place
worldwide in thorium resources (World Nuclear Association, 2015). Nuclear power
introduction plans were abandoned with the world’s nuclear power cooling after the
Three Mile Island and Chernobyl accidents.
A revival of interest in nuclear power came with the election of Hugo Chavez as
president in 1998. The new government engaged in deep reform of the political and
economic system of the country, including the initiative to launch a nuclear program
for peaceful applications. Venezuela had signed the Tlatelolco agreement as a non-
nuclear weapons state (UN Office for Disarmament’s Affairs, 1967). It signed two
agreements with Russia dealing with nuclear science and technology. The first on
October 15, 2010 (Gaceta Oficial, 2009) was mainly a mutual collaboration agree-
ment. The second (Gaceta Oficial, 2010) considered the purchase and installation of
two nuclear reactors in the country: a research reactor to be used for medical, indus-
trial, and scientific purposes and a nuclear power plant. The agreements included
plans for the training of students in Russia to build the necessary manpower.
The tsunami at Japan and ensuing damage to the four Fukushima nuclear power
reactors on March 11, 2011 (Fukushima Daiichi, 2016), as well as the following world
media campaign against nuclear power, determined a presidential declaration putting a
stop to the plans for the Russian nuclear reactors. However, the personal training pro-
gram continued in a modest way with a number of students completing their postgrad-
uate degrees in Russia. This student training program was still active in 2017.
Modest nuclear science activities are carried out at Venezuelan universities and
at IVIC as part of the physics departments. This is mainly concentrated at the
Dosimetry Laboratory at IVIC and at the Nuclear Physics Laboratory of the
Universidad Simo´n Bolı´var (USB). This laboratory, founded in 1979, has produced
the majority of the research into the science, technology, and personal training in
nuclear science in Venezuela (Laboratorio de fı´sica Nuclear, 2016).
In 2009, Kazuo Furukawa and Takashi Kamei paid a 1-week visit to USB
during which they gave a course in thorium molten salt reactors (MSR) after a
presentation at the ANFM2009 meeting (Kamei et al., 2009). This visit marks
766

the beginning of the interest in thorium MSR of the research group of the
Nuclear Physics Laboratory of the Universidad Simo´n Bolı´var. Some of the
group research areas are related to neutron production by spallation, neutron
transport, and interactions in the core. In what follows we present some of the
background activities in the field of molten salts, we describe a radioisotope
excited subcritical liquid fuel assembly and a contribution to accelerator-driven
MSR (AD MSR). A further contribution to AD MSR is included in Chapter 15,
Accelerator-driven systems.
26.23.2
Background activities
Venezuela has a large experience in the industrial use of molten salt. This is an expe-
rience which can contribute modestly to the use of molten salts in the nuclear field.
The aluminum industry (Alcasa and Venalum) reduce alumina (Al2O3) to pure alumi-
num in Hall-Herauld cells that contain molten cryolite (Na3AlF6) at 950C. Very large
cells handling currents as high as 350,000 A have been developed (Club Ensayos,
2016). The need to streamline the analysis of cryolite in order to diagnose the state of
operation of the aluminum production cells and to optimize the operation of the plant
resulted in the design of an isotope excited neutron activation procedure for the analy-
sis of the fluoride molten salt (Greaves et al., 2005). This work resulted in first-hand
experience with handling high-temperature fluoride molten salts in Venezuela.
As mentioned previously the invitation in 2009 to Kazuo Furukawa and Takashi
Kamei to spend a week in USB resulted in close collaboration with the Japanese
MSR movement and the publication of review articles (Furukawa et al., 2011;
Greaves et al., 2012). The capacity of the molten salt nuclear fuel to be processed
for the removal of nuclear waste and generation of fissile (Delpech et al., 2011) as
well as the processing of alumina, created the idea of using molten salts for the
reduction and production of elements from the refractory mineral columbite
tantalite (niobium and tantalum mineral) from Venezuelan deposits. The work
carried out in Orsay, France, by E.D. Greaves with developments in the laboratory
of Dr. Silvie Delpech (2013) involved three molten chloride systems: ZnCl2NaCl,
LiClKCl, and NaClCaCl2 and one fluoride system: FLiNaK, ternary eutectic
alkaline metal fluoride salt mixture LiFNaFKF (46.511.542 mol%) that has
a melting point of 454C and a boiling point of 1570C. The work resulted in addi-
tional experience with the use of molten salts and an opportunity for fostering the
idea of the thorium MSR (Greaves, 2013a, 2013b).
26.23.3
Radioisotope excited subcritical liquid fuel
assembly
A subcritical liquid fuel reactor project is in progress at USB. It has as its purpose
the acquisition of expertise in the operation of liquid fuel reactors, the testing of
modeling results, and training of students. The project contemplates the simplest

configuration possible to keep costs and development time at very low levels.
Operation is at room temperature for which the reactor’s fuel (fertile and (eventu-
ally) fissile isotopes) are dissolved in aqueous media such as uranyl nitrate and tho-
rium nitrate solutions. The facility is built around an existing radioisotope neutron
irradiator developed as a cryolite (F6AlNa3) analyzer to serve the Venezuelan
aluminum industry (Greaves et al., 2005) as shown in Fig. 26.23.1. The reactor
contains a radioactive neutron source consisting of a californium 252Cf source and
an americium-beryllium 241Am-Be source located in the center of a lead container
that serves the purpose of shielding the high-intensity gamma radiation of the
californium source between 1 and 10 MeV. The fission neutrons produced by the
252Cf source are of high energy (on average 2 MeV) so that the source is
surrounded by a graphite moderator. The whole assembly has a biological shield
consisting of lithium-loaded high-density polyethylene as well as lithium-loaded
paraffin blocks. As shown in Fig. 26.23.1, there is an irradiation port which trans-
verses the graphite lengthwise, where the liquid fuel reactor core is located. The
core consists of a 3/16-in. polyethylene tube rolled around a graphite frame with a
number of turns that is located in the center of the irradiation port. The core has an
entrance and exit for the flow of the liquid fuel. The fuel solution is made to circu-
late in and out of the core by a peristaltic pump at a controlled flow that determines
the fuel residence time in the core. Due to the limited thermal neutron flux pro-
duced by the radioactive sources, monitoring of reactions taking place is accom-
plished in-line by a detector, but mainly by off-line measurements of the
radioactivity of the liquid fuel. For off-line measurements, these are done before
and after irradiation with a high-resolution very low-level gamma ray spectrometer
fitted with a solid-state detector (LEGE HPGe Camberra GL2020L) normally
intended for environmental measurements. The facility is used for neutron activa-
tion experiments in the “Advance Laboratory” practicals of the physics undergradu-
ate curricula at USB using nuclear electronics for energy spectra and lifetime

measurements in the identification of nuclear isotopes. Open source Monte Carlo
software packages such as FLUKA (FLUKA Home, 2016) and GEANT4
(GEANT4, 2016) are taught to advanced MSc and PhD candidates in nuclear tech-
nology projects. The modeling of the operation of the liquid fuel subcritical assem-
bly constitutes a challenging proposal to train them in current nuclear energy tasks.
26.23.4
Accelerator-driven MSR (AD MSR) simulation
An AD MSR operates as a subcritical assembly and the chain reaction is maintained
by an external neutron source. This can be accomplished by different technologies,
for example, with a radio-isotopic neutron source (252Cf, Ra-Be, Am-Be, or others)
as described above or by an accelerator-related source that generates neutrons by
gamma ray or particle beam nuclear reactions (Kamei, 2014). Earlier proposals on
spallation reaction target design have been considered for running nuclear reactors
(Furukawa et al., 1991; Rubbia et al., 1995) that operates close to the critical value.
Today’s important technological progress could be advantageously employed for
this purpose.
As part of an extensive study we considered the on-going EURISOL project
(2009) as a possible neutron source for an AD MSR device. Essentially it is an
accelerator with a technologically advanced ion source producing a 1 GeV high
energy proton beam impinging on the AD MSR device. The system is considered
with power between 1 and 10 MW depending on the choice of reactor, effective
multiplication factor keff value (Bk 5 0.98), and desired output power. It is usual to
employ Ebeam $ 800 MeV, targeting on fuel in the reactor core. In our case this is
liquid fuel flowing in the reactor core. This is a target station where spallation neu-
trons are generated in large numbers, between 30 and 40 neutrons per reaction, that
in turn interact with the thoriumuranium fuel providing transmutation and fission.
The fertile-fissile nuclei, located by design in a large tank lined with graphite, cir-
culate at high temperature and relatively low speed in a closed loop from the core
to the heat exchanger. The target station therefore hosts the spallation neutron
source and fissile fuel, including 235U-rich and 232Th molten salt mixture. The latter
contains ThF4 dissolved in the molten salt (FLiBe) being the fertile fuel to produce
fissile fuel
233U. The target area is a modification of that proposed for the
EURISOL neutron source with the important modification that the spallation reac-
tion takes place directly in molten fuel salt. The geometry of the device is shown in
Fig. 26.23.2.
Surrounding the target is a graphite moderator with cylindrical geometry provid-
ing the thermal neutrons and at the same time a duct for fuel transport. Further
from the target (not shown) the fuel flows in a graphite-lined vessel that by reflec-
tion improves the neutron economy. As a last radiation barrier a concrete wall pro-
vides shielding and structural support for the whole assembly. All of these details
have been included in a simulation using the FLUKA code (2016) (Battistoni et al.,
2016). The composition of the molten salt and relevant technical details are given
elsewhere (Bermudez et al., 2011).

The results of the modeling of the target station for a proton beam of 1 GeV and
a current of 1 mA indicate that a specific density of neutrons/cm2/mA is attainable.
An example is shown in Fig. 26.23.3.
The distribution of the power density in the core of the reactor follows approxi-
mately, as expected, the 3D-Bragg curve. Energy produced by fission in the molten

Molten Salt Reactors and Thorium Energy

salt has a strong heat gradient toward the surrounded graphite reflector and struc-
tural concrete. The system is conceived for an operational power of 10 MW. The
distribution of fissions in the fuel as a result of spallation neutrons and of fission
neutrons indicates an asymmetry of the neutron fluence, power density, and fission
density in the forward direction of the impinging proton beam. The fission density
distribution is indicated in Fig. 26.23.4.
Predictions by FLUKA show spectra that depend on a graphite moderator, fuel,
reflector, and concrete wall shape and mass. Specific spectra are obtained for the
various zones. These have an important consequence on the reactor’s effective mul-
tiplication factor keff. In fact, the spallation-related neutron energy distribution
departs strongly from the fission spectrum. This in turn will superimpose to the
existing in-core neutron spectrum and influences the neutron economy. One of these
results is shown in Fig. 26.23.5 in comparison with the fission spectra. It has been
observed that, in the nonfission multiplication case, fast neutrons produce a rela-
tively large number of (n, xn), X 5 1,2,3. . . reactions due to the spallation spectra
which contain a large portion of fast neutrons in the high-energy region.
The EURISOL AD MSR is characterized by the energy gain G (i.e., energy pro-
duced/energy injected) which is expressed by the relation:
ðEnergy=fissionÞ3ðNo numberof neutronsperprotonsabsorbedÞ=ðνð12ksÞEbeamÞ
In that ν represents the number of neutrons released during fission or
G 5 ð0:18NoksÞ=ðνð1 2 ksÞEbeamÞ 5 Go=ðð1=ksÞ 2 1Þ

General conclusions
The radioisotope excited subcritical liquid fuel assembly described shows how a
facility may be operated with very simple and economical means, without the need
for highly radioactive materials which require extensive and lengthy certification
procedures. The facility allows the acquisition of knowledge of the important fea-
tures of liquid fuel reactors. Furthermore, it offers at the same time technical knowl-
edge and the necessary expertise in the use of powerful modeling programs that
condense substantial nuclear physics and important data on how these tools may be
used for the design of the nucleonic aspects of MSR.
The work carried out in Monte Carlo modeling of the EURISOL type neutron
source shows that it is indeed possible to use this technology for a high energy pro-
ton accelerator-driven MSR. However, further work is needed in refinement in
respect to the size, scaling, fissile concentration, and the requirement of a more
realistic geometry.

The world needs widespread use of nuclear energy to promote universal prosperity,
to provide fresh water to dry regions, to prevent wars over fossil fuels, to comple-
ment intermittent energy sources, and to mitigate climate change. Widespread use
requires better utilization of uranium and thorium, hence consideration of breeding
with accelerators, fusion reactors, or high conversion ratio fission reactors. Molten
salts are useful for all these applications.
27.1
Achievements
Molten salt coolants do not evaporate at reactor temperatures, no water or steam is
present in a molten salt reactor (MSR) core, and no hydrogen is generated, so the
use of low-pressure molten salt instead of high-pressure water could have pre-
vented the Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima accidents. Recognizing
the inherent safety advantages, many countries are now engaged in MSR research
and in thorium energy development. MSRs could produce energy safely at costs
competitive with fossil fuels, if excessive regulatory requirements and delays did
not interfere.
Some MSR features and achievements cited in this book are:
G
Some MSR development company designs might satisfy the investors’ economic, regula-
tory, and public acceptance requirements for new power plants better than most other
reactors (see Chapters 1: Introduction and 1725).
G
The nuclear air-cooled Brayton combined cycle promises high-efficiency, thermal energy
storage, and potential deployment in dry climates. Even if the Rankine cycle with current
supercritical steam turbine is applied, the MSR has higher efficiency than current light
water reactors (LWRs) (see Chapter 2: Electricity production).
G
In addition to electrical power generation, MSRs could provide high-temperature chemical
production (such as hydrogen, ammonia, and ethylene), actinide waste incineration,
desalination of water, space propulsion, and medical isotope production (see Chapter 3:
Chemical fundamentals and other applications).

G
The reactor physics of moving precursors is being studied: simulation codes to help
understand the transport of delayed neutron precursors in the core, delayed neutron emis-
sion outside the core, and of fluid flow with heat sources in both the fluid and the graphite
(see Chapters 5: Kinetics, dynamics and neutron noise in stationary MSRs and 6: Thermal
hydraulics of liquid-fueled MSRs).
G
Materials selection, new materials development, and redox potential control can limit cor-
rosion to acceptable values (see Chapter 7: Materials).
G
On-line or batch processing can separate uranium, plutonium, other actinides, and fission
products from the fuel, breeder, and coolant salts (see Chapters 3: Chemical fundamentals
and other applications, 8: Chemical processing of liquid fuel, 11: Liquid fuel, thermal
neutron spectrum reactors).
G
Most of the fission products decay within 300 years, and the actinides are responsible for
the longer-term radioactivity. MSRs could remove the actinides online, or incinerate acti-
nides from LWRs, so that the fuel would not need to be treated as radioactive waste, and it
could even be recycled after 300 years (see Chapter 9: Environment, waste, and resources).
G
Ways to improve the proliferation resistance of MSR fuel cycles have been identified.
The safeguarding of liquid fuel will require changes in the accounting methodology.
Efficient incineration of plutonium by thorium MSRs would reduce the proliferation risk,
which is a concern for the current UPu fuel cycle (see Chapters 1012).
G
The 200-MWe FUJI-U3 thermal spectrum MSR can operate with a fissile mass inventory
B 1.1 ton, relatively flat power density profile, and conversion ratio B1 without online
reprocessing, keeping the graphite and liquid fuel in the core for 30 years, and producing
only 4% as much actinides as a Boiling water reactor (BWR) (see Chapter 11: Liquid
fuel, thermal neutron spectrum reactors).
G
Safety issues have been addressed and general design criteria for MSRs have been pro-
posed (see Chapter 11: Liquid fuel, thermal neutron spectrum reactors).
G
Due to recent observation of the high solubility of PuF3, UF4, and AmF3 in the eutectic
LiF-NaF-KF, three ideas can be combined: liquid fuel, fast neutron spectrum, and UPu
fuel cycle (see Chapter 12: Fast spectrum, liquid fueled reactors).
G
Solid fuel fluoride-salt cooled high-temperature reactors (FHRs) and static liquid fuel
reactors might be deployed earlier than liquid fuel-cooled MSRs, providing dispatchable
power to complement fluctuating solar and wind power, and perhaps serving as a stepping
stone to liquid fuel-cooled molten salt reactors (see Chapters 13: solid fuel, salt-cooled
reactors and 14: Static liquid fuel reactors).
G
A static liquid fuel reactor with molten salt fuel in conventional fuel tubes and assemblies
would avoid the need to pump and valve highly radioactive fluid, avoid the complexity of
combining the fuel and primary coolant, and avoid the need for online reprocessing and
chemical treatment (see Chapter 14: Static liquid fuel reactors).
G
Assuming 80% load factor in an accelerator-driven molten salt breeder, the net production
rate of 233U is about 800 kg/year, which can be used to start one 1-GWe FUJI-MSR every
2 years. Accelerator-driven systems could incinerate about 300 kg of LWR actinide
wastes per GWth-year of Accelerator driven system (ADS) operation (see Chapter 15:
Accelerator-driven systems).
G
A fusionfission hybrid neutron source power of 1 GWth could breed B 3000 kg/year of
U-233, enough to provide fuel for 15 fission reactors (see Chapter 16: Fusionfission hybrids).
G
Nine organizations describe the advantages of their reactor designs (see Chapters 1725).
G
A solid fuel MSR and a liquid fuel MSR are under construction in China (see Chapter 17:
Thorium molten salt reactor nuclear energy system (TMSR)).
G
Twenty-three countries are engaged in MSR or thorium energy research (see Chapter 26:
Worldwide Activities).

27.3
Societal issues
Some additional issues are:
G
Fissile isotope security and inventory control;
G
New safety criteria;
G
Simplified, efficient, affordable licensing procedures;
G
Public education and acceptance of MSRs.
27.4
Conclusions
This book shows the good progress that is being made on these issues, building on
the valuable MSRE experience. Liquid fuel MSRs afford significant advantages
over solid fuels (see Chapter 1: Introduction), but reactors that do not require online
processing of liquid fuels might be deployed earlier.
We envision a world where almost every country has affordable molten salt
reactors burning thorium, uranium, and spent fuel actinides, producing electricity,
hydrogen, and desalinized water with no serious accidents.
