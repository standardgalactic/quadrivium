A Designer’s Research Manual
If you’re working for a 
publicly traded design 
megalith whose creative 
staff is assisted by 
historians, anthropologists, 
sociologists, and marketers, 
you probably don’t need 
this book.

Introduction
HOW DO I
USE THIS BOOK?
 We know you’re busy. So we’ve 
packaged this content assuming that 
you’ll visit (and revisit) this book with 
limited chunks of time, and speciﬁc 
tasks in mind. It’s divvied up into four 
distinct sections:
1. Know the Basics
Before you can integrate research into 
your design process, you need a little 
background. This section provides some 
historical context, showcasing applied 
research practices from as far back as 
the Bauhaus (see, art school was on to 
something). We’ll also discuss how design 
creates value, helping you articulate why 
research-driven design methods serve 
your clients’ interests.  
2. Gather the Tools to Conduct 
Research
This section reviews research basics, so 
you understand the difference between 
primary and secondary investigations, 
and qualitative and quantitative methods 
before jumping into speciﬁcs. We'll survey 
a variety of research strategies, drilling 
down to tactics that you can employ on 
your projects, describing what these 
tools can (and sometimes can’t) do, how 
and when they are used, and the level of 
difﬁculty or expertise involved. 
If you’re one of the thousands of graphic 
designers whose education was based 
primarily in the art department, if almost 
all of your clients have MBAs, and if 
you’ve wished for some help validating 
your aesthetic decisions to that crowd, 
keep reading. 
Consider this manual a primer on 
research methods and their practical 
application to graphic design. It broadly 
outlines common research strategies 
and tactics and introduces you to 
frameworks in which to engage them. 
It offers suggestions for incorporating 
research-driven design into your creative 
process—whether you’re a freelancer, in-
house designer, member of a studio team, 
student, or professor. It features success 
stories and examples of these methods in 
action: accessible and pragmatic accounts 
of real-world experiences from designers 
around the globe. 
Writing this book (now for a second  
time) has inﬂuenced the way we 
approach design, and the way we teach 
our students. It is our ﬁrm belief that in 
a profession in ﬂux, a good generalist 
can always ﬁnd stability. You need this 
information for your good generalist 
shelf. Know when to use it and when to 
call in the experts. So armed, go make 
good stuff.

3. Integrate Research into Your  
Existing Practice
So many tools and techniques to choose 
from. Where to begin? What research 
methods are a good ﬁt for your team or 
project? This section provides exercises 
to help you get started, and methods for 
crafting research plans that account for 
resources and manage scope.
Need advice on how to turn research 
ﬁndings into creative gold? We’ll also 
outline frameworks that help analyze the 
results of your efforts, helping you craft a 
research-driven creative brief and identify 
new opportunities for design.  
4. Learn from the Experts
We’ve peppered the book with real world 
examples. This section is entirely focused 
on case studies from designers around 
the globe. Their individual practices 
are diverse in scale, project focus, and 
budget—but each shares a practical 
application of research that has resulted in 
creative dividends. Want to see research-
driven design principles in action? This is 
where to turn.
What’s Different in the  
Revised Edition?
The ﬁrst edition of A Designer’s Research 
Manual was released over 10 years ago! 
Much has changed in the design research 
space since, but the core principles remain 
the same. So we’ve kept the evergreen 
content from the original book, updating it 
with new strategies, tactics, processes, and 
tools to reﬂect current trends. 
A decade of working with designers 
who’ve adopted and adapted these 
methods has helped us understand where 
sticking points commonly occur. This 
second edition was written with process 
in mind, adding information to help you 
get started, plan your research strategy, 
analyze results—and incorporate them 
into a solid, action-oriented creative brief.  
More content = you making more good stuff.

DESIGN
Getting started is the 
hardest part. We provide 
tools and tactics that 
help you hit the ground 
running, plan your 
research approach, 
account for project 
scope, and manage your 
creative process.
Once you've done 
the research, how do 
you make sense of 
the data? We provide 
frameworks to help you 
discover patterns in 
the information you've 
gathered—and identify 
opportunities for design.
RESEARCH

A Designer’s Research Manual
Businesses recognize, 
now more than ever, how 
important design is to 
ﬁnancial success. However, 
clients are often looking 
for assurances that their 
communication dollars will 
be spent wisely. 
CHAPTER 1

Chapter 1: An Overview of Research in Graphic Design
 This chapter explores the concept 
of research-driven design, how it has 
been used in the past, where new 
opportunities exist, and how these 
practices generate value. 
Graphic designers have long been 
taught that form, structure, and style 
are indispensable communication tools. 
Hours spent in the study of typographic 
principles, color theory, grid placement, 
shape relationships, and visual contrasts 
inform a designer’s aesthetic decisions. 
However, the demands placed on today’s 
visual communication designer are very 
different from those asked of yesterday’s 
commercial artist. As the design profession 
evolves, an increasingly competitive 
global marketplace expects measurable 
results for its creative dollars. Clients want 
assurance that designers understand their 
business issues and that commissioned 
work will deliver a return on their 
investment. 
Incorporating research methods into the 
design process can aid in meeting this 
demand for a variety of reasons. Simply 
put, this approach redeﬁnes the designer/
client relationship—and multiplies the 
creative and ﬁnancial dividends for 
both. Research-driven design can help 
deﬁne an audience, support a concept, 
advocate for an aesthetic, or measure 
the effectiveness of a campaign. In a ﬁeld 
dominated by subjectivity, tools such as 
market research, ethnographic study, and 
data analytics can be used to communicate 
better with a target audience, create more

DESIGN?
effective messages, or continually assess a 
project’s development. Applying traditional 
research methodology to the process of 
graphic design also positions the designer 
in a consultative role. Armed with this 
supporting evidence, the designer (often 
viewed as a vendor) instead becomes a 
strategic consultant (newly viewed as a 
business partner). Designers who base 
their commissions around the creation of 
artifacts encounter clear project end-dates, 
while those who provide strategic services 
continue billing on a retainer basis. 
In chapter one we’ll introduce person-
ﬁrst design philosophies, exploring the 
importance of truly understanding the 
unique needs of the people for whom 
you’re designing. We’ll review some 
historical moments that helped deﬁne 
the role of research in design practice, 
because examining how the aligned ﬁelds 
of architecture, interior design, industrial 
design, and user experience design have 
successfully embraced research can help 
you learn how to apply the concepts to 
graphic design. We’ll end on some good 
news you can help spread, evidence of 
design’s connection to value generation 
and ﬁnancial success.

A Designer’s Research Manual
 Research is essential to solving 
complicated problems. This is true in 
almost every profession; it’s even true 
in complex personal undertakings! 
Whether you’re charged with 
expanding your company into a new 
market, or selecting your next car, 
you can’t solve the problem if you 
don’t do your homework. 
Research frames the problem. It provides 
context. It helps us get to know the people 
we’re designing for, and the issues we’re 
designing around: Who lives in this 
market? What distracts a new driver? We 
research to identify and understand needs, 
preferences, inﬂuences, motivations, 
habits. We’re looking for patterns. We’re 
seeking insight that will help us connect 
project goals to people. The extra work 
is worth doing because it places your 
user at the center of your design process. 
Research ﬁndings become a touchstone 
for ensuring that creative and aesthetic 
decisions are being made objectively. 
You’re lining up the work to resonate with 
your audience.
Research can also serve internally as a 
client communication tool. It can provide 
a platform for the client and designer to 
agree on project goals, scope, and audience. 
Findings can help outline concepts and 
support rationale with stakeholders and 
partners. Actively incorporating research 
into the design process makes the creative 
problem more transparent, helps win buy-
in, and mitigates perceptions of risk. 
Research can help provide focus, track 
progress, conﬁrm success, measure 
impact … and sometimes it can tell you 
that you’ve missed your mark.
Research isn’t a guarantee. It’s important 
to understand that the practices covered 
in this book don’t automatically ensure 
success. While design research can be 
very technical and in-depth, it’s still 
primarily a qualitative—or subjective—
activity. As designers, we undertake 
these activities to develop insights into 
problem and audience. We are not 
building evidence for a legal argument, 
there is no warranty on outcome, and 
we do not seek deﬁnitive proof. Research 
cannot guarantee—but it can predict and 
inﬂuence a project’s success. Ask the right 
questions, talk to the right constituents, 
and you will develop an understanding 
of central issues, a new empathy for the 
people you’re trying to reach. 
Research doesn’t prescribe aesthetic. 
Creative decisions can be inspired by 
research ﬁndings—the creative process 
almost always beneﬁts from more 
information—but research activities can’t 
create the work. Informed decisions—
based on research instead of an intuitive 
best guess—amplify the power of the 
artifacts they create. It’s up to the design 
team to incorporate the analytical to the 
beneﬁt of their art. 
WHAT RESEARCH CAN
AND CAN‘T DO

13
Chapter 1: An Overview of Research in Graphic Design
 One of the ﬁrst things we teach new 
designers is ‘It’s not about you.’ 
Looming deadlines can easily pressure us 
to jump into solving a problem visually, 
based on personal inferences. Undertaking 
a person-ﬁrst approach forces the creative 
to slow down and invest time stepping 
out of his or her own experience and 
into another’s perspective. We can craft 
more meaningful, targeted, resonant 
communications when we develop an 
empathy for our audience—placing 
those people at the center of the creative 
process. Embracing a research-driven 
design strategy means more work 
upfront, focused on developing a better 
understanding of the client and the needs 
of the end user. But that initial investment 
of time will pay dividends through the 
course of project development and well 
after launch.
Here are some ways that a person-ﬁrst 
approach beneﬁts all involved, client, 
customer and creative: 
• Research ﬁndings and participant feedback 
allow for deeper comprehension of the problem 
and yield more tailored solutions.
• Creative and client can establish appropriate 
project success metrics together, based on 
research ﬁndings.
• Audience participation and iterative process 
can raise questions, provoke solutions, and 
identify new opportunities. 
• The creative team has a better understanding of 
context including environmental factors that may 
inﬂuence use before they start designing.
• Validation and testing of concepts happens 
during prototyping, avoiding costly assumptions 
and post production mistakes. 
• Person-ﬁrst approaches have been linked with 
higher rates of customer satisfaction, increased 
time to market, and greater return on investment.
WHAT IS
PERSON-FIRST
DESIGN?
A person-ﬁrst approach 
employs research to help 
creative teams understand 
the needs, behaviors, and 
culture of their audience, 
and provide context for 
how they will encounter 
or interact with the 
artifact being created. 
Design solutions are then 
tested and reﬁned with 
real users.

A Designer’s Research Manual
Person-First Philosophies 
A number of terms are used when 
discussing person-ﬁrst approaches to 
design. It’s helpful to parse them into 
two big ideas, User-Centered Design and 
Human-Centered Design.  
User-Centered Design
The term “user-centered” has its origins 
in product design, human/computer 
interaction, and software development but 
has since expanded in practice to include 
a broad range of design disciplines—
anywhere a deep understanding of end 
users is essential to project success. This 
concept integrates research throughout 
the creative process, providing valuable 
insight into the needs, behaviors, and 
expectations of the target audience. User-
centered design is a person-ﬁrst approach 
focused on increasing the end user’s 
satisfaction with a product or service, 
experience or brand. This approach can 
be applied to the development of any 
design system, from interactive to print, 
packaging to environmental, single artifact 
to broad campaign. It is often applied 
to commercial endeavors but can also 
be a guiding principle of socially driven 
projects. User-centered design targets a 
speciﬁc audience and seeks to develop a 
project that serves their needs.
Human-Centered Design
Human-centered design incorporates 
many of the same approaches as user-
centered design, with deep research into 
behavior and an iterative process, but this 
concept attempts to address the needs 
of every individual, regardless of ability, 
age, education, or cultural background. 
Human-centered design veers away from 
the speciﬁcity of a user-centered focus, 
avoiding audience segmentation, and 
intent on creating design artifacts and 
systems that serve everyone. The terms 
 “design for all” and “universal design” 
are often used interchangeably when 
discussing human-centered design. 
If embracing user-centered design is a 
good business decision, many argue that 
there is a moral and ethical imperative 
to embrace human-centered design 
on certain projects, with principles of 
accessibility and access emphasized over 
aesthetics or economics.   
Ultimately both person-ﬁrst philosophies 
guide designers to address the needs of the 
individuals they’re designing for: It’s the 
scale of that group that differs. 
Graduate students at 
Kent State University’s 
School of Visual 
Communication Design 
embraced a human-
centered design approach 
to develop a series of 
illustrations used for 
teaching basic sanitation 
and hygiene around the 
world. These images 
provide instruction on 
basic hand washing 
technique and emphasize 
when it’s important. 
The graphics had to 
communicate to a diverse 
audience with varied 
ages, literacy levels, 
cultural backgrounds and 
nationalities.

A Designer’s Research Manual
APPROACHING + REACTING  
TO RESEARCH
 Design is about understanding.
The graphic designer must have empathy 
for whom and for what they are designing. 
Building research into the design process 
avoids resultant design solutions serving 
only to satisfy the designer or to paint over 
the cracks of an issue.
In many ways, designers have to become 
mini-experts in all that they deal with 
in order to be able really to understand 
the subject matter and the audience to 
whom they are speaking. Research in this 
respect is essential in getting designers to 
understand worlds they may not normally 
inhabit themselves: worlds that present the 
designer with unfamiliar environments, 
scenarios, people, industries, languages, 
and traditions.
Research is needed to understand a client, 
the people they wish to communicate 
with, and the reasons behind the need 
for communication—in other words, 
the problem. Research should also be 
employed to aid the generation of visual 
directions and solutions. 
Research should cover at least two 
strands at any given time. One strand 
provides a scenario within which the 
design needs to exist and potentially 
a surface on which to work, the other 
provides a visual language to employ. 
Together they present the designer with a 
means to engage. Although either strand 
should inﬂuence the other, they are not 
interdependent, and usually require 
separate and distinct approaches.

… it is not so much 
the kind of research 
that is carried out as 
it is the designer’s 
ability to spot 
the value in their 
research and have 
the conﬁdence to 
react to it. 

17
Chapter 1: An Overview of Research in Graphic Design
In my experience as a director of design 
consultancy Bond and Coyne Associates 
and as a lecturer at Kingston University, 
London, it is not so much the kind of 
research that is carried out as it is the 
designer’s ability to spot the value in 
their research and have the conﬁdence to 
react to it. That being said, there is also 
a danger that research can “dry-out” a 
solution. Research, if handled incorrectly, 
can take away the chance of surprise. 
Therefore, the design process—and for 
that matter, the design studio—should 
allow for the unconventional to work in 
tandem with the methodical. Creation 
of project spaces in which observations, 
quotes, and facts are displayed in a 
nonlinear fashion enables the designer 
to get an instant overview of a situation 
and make connections between ﬁndings. 
It also allows designers to present interim 
thoughts and ﬁndings to others in the 
design team and perhaps even the client. 
Presenting research in this way can aid 
analysis while not alienating those less 
familiar with the design process. 
Literally sit these ﬁndings alongside 
inspirational (perhaps image-, material-, 
or format-led) research to inform possible 
solutions, and you have the potential for 
sparks of ingenuity to ﬂy and opportunities 
for innovation to be spotted. It is really 
important that this strand of research 
is not literal, that it takes conceptual 
leaps sideways, works metaphorically, 
and thinks laterally. It may lead a digital 
designer into looking at styles of bronze 
sculpture to inform an interaction, or 
a book designer to looking at abstract 
painters whilst developing a binding 
format … and that can only be a good 
thing for ingenuity.
Research is kept ﬂuid and reactions 
to it free-ﬂowing as long as there is a 
culture (particularly in the initial stages 
of analysis) of “anything goes.” Deferring 
judgment in this way helps designers build 
conﬁdence in their research processes and 
gives them the ability to stand back, get 
the bigger picture, and synthesize their 
data without fear of being “wrong.” 
Remember …
• Designers need to use research as something to 
react against as well as respond to. 
• Research should back up thinking. Making 
assumptions, and ignorance, can be the death 
of a successful and inspiring design.
• Whenever possible, research should inform the 
brief ﬁrst, before informing the solution. People 
or situations cannot ask for what they do not 
know is possible or do not realize is necessary.
• Don’t let research kill a potential idea—let it 
feed and support it. 
• Frame the creative process with logic, and the 
less expected can thrive within it.

A Designer’s Research Manual
While the concept of research-driven 
design may seem to be a new trend, many 
practitioners throughout history have incorporated 
research methods into their design processes. 
Bauhaus Beginnings
In his book The New Vision: Fundamentals 
of Bauhaus Design, Painting, Sculpture, 
and Architecture, László Moholy-Nagy 
describes a tactile design problem 
assigned to second-semester students at 
the Bauhaus (Germany, 1919–’33) and 
the New Bauhaus (Chicago, 1937), where 
completed projects were user tested 
on the blind.1  Students were asked to 
assemble different tactile values or “tones” 
in a manner that would create meaning 
or showcase the relationship between 
swatches. For example, a student might 
create a value scale by placing a smooth 
surface such as leather at one end and a 
rough material such as sandpaper at the 
other, with graduated steps in between. 
Projects were then user tested by the blind, 
and testers’ comments and experiences 
informed further investigations.

The Perfect Couple
Industrial designer Henry Dreyfuss 
dedicates an entire chapter to Joe and 
Josephine in his groundbreaking book 
Designing for People, ﬁrst published in 
1955.2 The ﬁctional couple originally 
appeared on the walls of Dreyfuss’ studio 
as anatomical drawings of average men 
and women and were used to gain an 
understanding of human factors in product 
design. Dreyfuss explains that through the 
years Joe and Josephine developed 
 “numerous allergies, inhibitions, and 
obsessions … disturbed by glaring light and 
by offensive coloring; they are sensitive to 
noise, and they shrink from a disagreeable 
odor.” Beyond their original purpose 
as physical references, these insights 
into the feelings and needs of Joe and 
Josephine—user icons—gave the studio 
more information on which to base design 
decisions. This knowledge was used in 
the creation of everything from bicycles to 
tractor controls to the interiors of airplanes.

The study of marketing research was 
pioneered by Arthur C. Nielsen Sr., 
founder of the ACNielsen company, in 
the late 1920s. Probably most famous 
for television’s Nielsen ratings, Nielsen 
developed many innovative tools 
that provided clients with objective 
information about the effects of 
marketing. Using random sampling 
techniques, Nielsen was also able to 
quantify market share, making it a key 
indicator of ﬁnancial performance. 
In 1939 the company expanded its 
operations to the U.K., with western 
Europe following shortly thereafter.  
Today they have ofﬁces across the globe, 
from Azerbaijan to the Ukraine, and  
are recognized as a world leader in 
consumer research.3

Don’t Tell Me, Show Me
Most of us think of computers as 
something that revolutionized the last 
decades of the 20th century, but early 
computing was underway before World 
War II. Since the introduction of these 
machines, people have been looking for 
betters ways to interact with them. 
In early conﬁgurations, computers were 
complex and cumbersome tools, used 
primarily by scientiﬁc, engineering, and 
military communities. The machines 
themselves were huge, and programmers 
dictated functions through physical punch 
cards. As advancements were made in 
scale and availability, command line 
interfaces streamlined the programming 
process, allowing for commands to be 
typed directly through a keyboard. Still, 
entering these lines of code required an 
understanding of programming languages 
alien to the uninitiated. 
The digital world we experience today— 
touch screens at mass transit platforms 
and interactive devices in the hands of 
toddlers—would not have been possible 
if not for the practical application of a 
graphical user interface (GUI, sometimes 
referred to as ‘gooey’). GUI interfaces 
bring computer interaction to the masses, 
providing simple visualizations and easy 
analogy with the physical world. 
One of the ﬁrst interfaces of this kind was 
developed in the early 1970s at Xerox’s 
Palo Alto Research Center (or PARC) for 
the experimental Alto computer. The 
team at Xerox knew that several factors 
were critical to widespread consumer 
adoption of personal computers, including 
availability and price. But the most crucial 
element was creating an interface that 
people actually understood. 
Design was the key. 
And to get the design right, the team at 
Xerox PARC knew that they had to create a 
system that reﬂected the world of regular 
people. They spent years engaging in user 
research, employing an iterative process 
of prototyping and testing that allowed for 
the creation of design standards that still 
feel relevant decades later.

These simple user 
experience innovations 
revolutionized human 
computer interaction and 
set a design precedent 
still resonant today.

Alto, the in-house prototype, paved the 
way for the Xerox 8010 Star Information 
System,4 the ﬁrst publicly available 
personal computer using a graphical user 
interface, desktop metaphor, and mouse. 
Xerox PARC’s user-centered approach 
resulted in an icon-based operating 
system for the machine. People using the 
computer would see a picture of a desk, 
open a folder, and physically move a ﬁle 
to another location—the screen, instead of 
blinking code, would function in familiar 
visual contexts. The Star system was 
even capable of networking, allowing for 
an early form of email, represented by a 
simple icons of in and out boxes. 
As ubiquitous as electricity and running 
water to today’s digital natives, this simple 
visual metaphor was a revolution in its 
time. One that continues to inﬂuence our 
interactions with technology.
Many frame the rise of personal 
computers as a story of engineering, 
but the technology is only half of the 
narrative. Without the value created 
by this early user-centered design 
approach, public acceptance of personal 
computers might have been an uphill 
struggle. The graphical user interface 
was a cornerstone of the Apple Lisa and 
Microsoft Windows, and the foundation 
for every laptop, smartphone, and tablet 
since—a communication innovation that 
has become a default for integrating 
technology into everyday life.

Chapter 1: An Overview of Research in Graphic Design
 Design is an evolving and dynamic 
ﬁeld. Change is one of the few givens. 
As communication campaigns are 
becoming more integrated, audiences 
are simultaneously more diverse 
(think global reach) and speciﬁc (micro 
communities of persons with similar 
interests). 
Designers are tackling more than ever 
before—from complex business challenges 
to entrepreneurial endeavors to sticky 
social problems. 
Being able to conduct research, and act 
on it—integrating those ﬁndings into 
design campaigns—is the new normal. It 
has become as important as our ability to 
marry type, image, and color with concept. 
If you’re fascinated with this component of 
the modern designer’s arsenal, here are a 
few growth areas where you might thrive: 
Experience Design
Companies everywhere are hunting for 
new ways to create rich experience-driven 
interactions between consumers and their 
products and brands. Designers that can 
craft interfaces (physical or virtual) that 
are useful, usable, relevant, and unique 
are in high demand. 
These professionals live at the crossroads 
of user research, technology, and design, 
combining their insights into beautiful and 
meaningful interactions across multiple 
communication platforms. In experience 
design, projects are driven by empathy, 
so understanding what the user wants 
and needs drives the creative process. 
Conducting and understanding person-
centered research is an indispensable skill 
for building ‘what’s next.’ 
User Research
Everyone wants to know their audience 
better, from businesses to political parties, 
because knowing your audience means 
knowing what they need, want, avoid, 
or accept. User research has grown so 
important to communication that it has 
become a singular job description. 
This emerging role combines behavioral 
and cultural research with design thinking. 
User researchers understand the social, 
business, and communication implications 
of the conversations they’re having with 
audiences. They develop insights that help 
marketing and design teams connect with 
their target and meet project goals, turning 
feedback actionable. 
Understanding the creative process from 
the design side ensures that the data these 
researchers are collecting will be framed 
with design activity or design intervention 
in mind. User researchers do the 
ethnographic ﬁeldwork that design teams 
need to create objects, messages, services 
or campaigns that are responsive to the 
user’s perspective.

Design Strategy
Business is driven by innovation and 
customer insight. Developing new products 
and ideas and discovering new markets 
are essential to long-term success. Enter 
the design strategist. 
She is a seasoned practitioner with a 
deep understanding of user research 
and creative process. She is the chief 
innovation ofﬁcer, combining design 
paradigms and a deep understanding 
of audience to address business and/
or community needs. This integration 
allows for agile response to fast-moving 
markets, emerging social issues, and 
ﬁckle public opinions. Design strategists 
help companies and organizations ﬁnd 
new ways to conduct business and serve 
their constituents. They are the leaders 
that integrate design and outreach into a 
company’s culture—and success! 
Combining design 
thinking, strategic 
problem solving, and 
information visualization, 
cross disciplinary teams 
at Humantiﬁc engage 
in a term they’ve coined 
“visual sense-making.” 
User Experience Designers 
create interactions for 
multiple platforms, 
including wearable devices 
such as this application 
for BACtrack, a leading 
producer of  breathalyzer 
products.

A Designer’s Research Manual
 We’ve seen how design can visually 
differentiate one business from 
another in a crowded marketplace. 
We’ve used it to simplify complex ideas 
and advance understanding. We’ve 
shaped stories out of data, making the 
abstract tangible. We’ve crafted emotional 
connections between people and the 
products they buy, the services they 
use, and the organizations, ideas, and 
communities they support. Design creates 
value by making a meaningful connection 
with individuals, and research is the tool 
we use to foster that connection. 
However, to an untrained eye, design 
can be viewed as a subjective pursuit—
one mired in individual style, trend, or 
seemingly superﬁcial decoration. Many 
clients understand the rough concept of 
design as a ‘point of differentiation’ but 
are still completely unfamiliar with the 
rigors of the creative process, or unclear 
on the difference between audience 
appropriateness and personal taste. 
To that outsider, design can represent 
risk. As budgets tighten and market 
cycles accelerate, clients want more 
assurance of projected successes and 
return on investment (ROI). Proving value 
generation speciﬁc to design, especially 
hard value calculations such as ROI, can 
be difﬁcult on a per-project basis. While 
agencies and larger studios may have 
established methods and specialized staff 
tasked with measuring impact, those 
processes are often proprietary. Smaller 
ﬁrms often lack the time, resources, and 
expertise to gather this proof.5  
Luckily, for all of us, professional 
organizations around the world have 
marshalled their resources to investigate 
the link between design and ﬁnancial 
success. This helps the collective 
profession articulate its worth in ways 
that resonate with business and frame 
our design services in language that 
resonates with our clients. The studies

Design + Investment
Design Council is an industry advocate 
with decades of experience advising the 
UK government and investigating the 
link between ﬁnancial performance and 
design. The organization conducted a 
longitudinal investigation, between 1994 
and 2004, that linked the strategic use 
of design to stock performance. Called 
the Design Index,6 this investigation 
discovered that over that ten-year period, 
the share prices of companies that invest 
in design performed up to 200% better 
than the FTSE 100, the 100 largest 
companies listed on the London Stock 
Exchange. During the course of the study, 
not only did this group of companies 
outperform the market, they were also 
more stable, doing better when gains 
were positive, and falling less when 
markets dipped into negative territory. 
Building on the evidence generated by the 
Design Index, the Design Management 
Institute, an international membership 
organization based in the United States, 
partnered with Motiv Strategies to 
conduct similar research focused on 
companies headquartered in the USA. 
Their study, called The Design Value 
Index,7 yielded similar patterns. Between 
2004 and 2014, design-led businesses in 
the USA outperformed the Standard & 
Poors 500 Index (S&P 500), 500 stocks 
grouped to measure the economic health 
of the nation, by up to 219%. These 
ﬁndings are signiﬁcant because the 
companies in DMI’s Design Value Index 
continually outperformed the market 
during the economic crisis of 2008, 
mirroring the market stability indicated in 
Design Council’s original study. 
Expanding on their stock index 
investigation, and compiling several 
initiatives documenting the many ways 
design strengthens ﬁnancial performance, 
Design Council generated a more 
expansive study, resulting in “The Value 
of Design Factﬁnder Report.”8 This 
document is a must read for designers 
everywhere, clearly demonstrating the old 
adage that ‘good design is good business.’

also saw an average of 6.5% increase in

was used to reveal new opportunities 
and identify new markets. The Design 
Alert businesses were also less likely 
to compete on price, indicating design 
played a key role in inﬂuencing customer 
perceptions of value. 
After interviewing 1,500 UK businesses, 
the research team discovered that sales 
and revenue growth are more likely to 
occur for companies that increase their 
investments in design. Money spent on 
design yielded products sold and customers 
acquired. Companies that viewed design 
as an essential tool for developing new 
products and services, rather than only as 
a tool used to market existing ones, saw 
signiﬁcantly increased revenue. 
Design Council identiﬁed 250 study 
participants that utilized design in 
unique ways. Classiﬁed as Design Alert 
businesses, these companies were studied 
in more detail, providing even more 
evidence to support the link between 
design spending and positive business 
outcomes. Design Alert businesses saw

The Design Staircase 
Established in the 1970s with the intent 
to boost exports and promote business 
and industry, The Danish Design Center 
(DDC) initially focused on the practice 
of industrial design. Their efforts have 
since expanded to include diverse design 
disciplines with an emphasis on value 
generation. The DDC created a framework 
for understanding how design creates 
value for business, called The Design 
Staircase. They then used that framework 
to survey 1,000 Danish companies, 
presenting their ﬁndings in “The Economic 
Effects of Design” report.9 
The Design Staircase has four levels,  
or stages:
• Stage One: No Design  
Design plays no signiﬁcant role in product or 
service development, or company culture.
• Stage Two: Design as Styling 
Design is used in a decorative way.
• Stage Three: Design as Process 
Design is used as a process to develop new 
products or services.
• Stage Four: Design as Strategy 
Design is integrated into company culture and 
aligned with business objectives. 
The DDC discovered that companies that 
were operating at the top of the model 
(stages three and four) saw signiﬁcant 
returns on design investment and had up 
to 20% more growth in revenue. These 
companies also had increased exports. 
The methodology used in The Design 
Staircase was embraced by the Centre for 
Design Innovation in Ireland,10 where the 
study was replicated with a focus on Irish 
businesses. Adding validity to the DDC’s 
ﬁndings, despite market variances, the 
Irish survey yielded similar results. In their 
study, the Centre for Design Innovation 
found that companies operating on the top 
two levels of the Staircase were more than 
twice as likely to see increased demand for 
products and services, while companies 
operating at the bottom were much more 
likely to remain stagnant. 
Both studies illustrate that design, when 
integrated as a part of corporate culture, 
becomes a tool for innovation and a 
predictor of success.

You’re looking for  
insight, not evidence. 
As you begin to consider what research 
can do for your design practice, also try 
to understand what it can’t do. You’re 
undertaking these actions to generate 
better, more effective problem-solving. 
You’re not trying to deﬁnitively prove that 
your solution is the best or only answer. 
 
Shift your orbit. 
Put people at the center of your process. 
Aesthetics absolutely matter, but not at 
the expense of audience. Understand 
what’s important or resonant to the user 
and you can impact their lives (and the 
project’s success). 
There is nothing new 
under the sun. 
(Very little, anyway.) Don’t let clients balk at 
research as a newfangled service, add-on, 
or extra. There’s ample historical precedent 
for the success and importance of research-
driven design. Use these stories as evidence 
for your own intentions. Remember, you’re 
positioning yourself as a strategist and 
partner, not a take-out menu of à la carte 
creative services.

 Research ﬁndings can help the 
designer in a variety of ways. 
From supporting great concepts 
to measuring the effectiveness of 
ﬁnished projects, a research-driven 
approach can help deﬁne the way 
problems are solved and illustrate  
the value of those solutions.
This section provides an overview of 
traditional research methods and a 
discussion of their application to the ﬁeld 
of graphic design. Because design artifacts 
(websites, brand collateral, annual reports, 
mobile applications, etc.) are generally 
visual vessels for the application of research 
ﬁndings, it is important to begin with a 
survey of methods (theory), strategies 
(planning), and tactics (action).
BIG CONCEPTS  
IN RESEARCH
Quantitative + Qualitative Research
When discussing research methods, there 
are two distinct categories into which most 
data-gathering exercises fall: quantitative 
and qualitative. 
Measuring sets of variables or quantities 
and their relationship to one another 
produces quantitative research. This form 
of research is built around numbers, logic, 
and objective data. For example, a person 
studying the effects of global warming may 
take measurements of temperature over a 
given amount of time to determine the rate 
in which the climate is changing. Though 
well suited to scientiﬁc pursuits, applying 
these metrics to creative inquiry is less 
successful. Instead, designers look to the 
social sciences for a model that better 
suits our speciﬁc needs. Also incorporating 
statistical methods, quantitative marketing 
research is a social research technique

QUALITATIVE
He is tall.
They eat all the time.
The president is well liked. 
The cruise ship was huge.
The cat is fat.
Quantitative research 
measures objective data, 
whereas qualitative 
research measures 
subjective data, such as 
the qualities surrounding 
an area of inquiry.

A Designer’s Research Manual
36
focused around the development of 
questionnaires, the responses to which 
can be scored and measured. For 
example, if a designer wanted to determine 
the relationship between a user interface 
and user satisfaction, the designer could 
ask a population of users to ﬁll out a 
questionnaire. The information gathered 
would then be scored and measured. The 
resulting information could be useful in 
developing further iterations of alternate 
structures, measure the success of the current 
design, or even inform future projects. 
Whereas quantitative research deals 
with objective data such as numbers 
and logic, qualitative research deals 
with subjective material such as words 
and images. This research approach 
strives to understand the qualities of 
a speciﬁc ﬁeld of inquiry. This form of 
investigation uses tools such as individual 
or group interviews, literature reviews, 
and participant observation to understand 
and explain social behavior. For example, 
if a researcher wanted to gain insight 
regarding the shopping habits of teenagers, 
she might spend several days on location 
watching the subjects at a mall or shopping 
center, documenting her observations. 
Reviewing the resulting documentation, 
the researcher might be able to ﬁnd 
commonalities and thus formulate a 
theory on teenage purchasing behavior. 
In visual communication design, the 
majority of research practices fall under 
the qualitative umbrella. As designers 
continually develop new objects for diverse 
audiences, they must strive to understand 
the detailed needs of those consumers. 
Human behavior is not easily quantiﬁed; 
hence qualitative research strategies, born 
of the social sciences, are often a better ﬁt 
for creative pursuits. 
Primary + Secondary Research
The terms “primary research” and  
 “secondary research” might imply they 
happen in succession. However, they 
instead refer to proximity and speciﬁcity of 
source. Primary refers to original research 
that is conducted by an organization for 
its own use. For example, a cosmetics 
company in the United States might use 
observational research combined with 
surveys and questionnaires, targeted at 
middle-school-aged girls, to determine 
preteen purchasing habits. They would 
then use the resulting data to inform their 
packaging, product placement, and other 
marketing and design elements. 
Secondary research refers to the practice 
of reviewing a collection of data or ﬁndings 
that have previously been published 
by an outside party, for an alternative 
function. For example, if a record label 
in the United Kingdom could obtain a 
copy of the research produced by the 
cosmetics ﬁrm we’ve just mentioned, they 
might be able to use that information 

Chapter 2: Research Strategies +Tactics
37
to aid their marketing strategies for 
music sales to teenage girls. Chances 
are that reviewing the cosmetics ﬁrm’s 
brief would be much less expensive and 
faster than commissioning a focus group 
or conducting individual interviews or 
surveys. The information certainly would 
be relevant to those planning a campaign 
directed at the discretionary income of an 
adolescent. However, lipstick and music 
are vastly different products. Additionally, 
though the subjects of both inquiries share 
gender and age commonality, they may 
well vary from a cultural perspective. 
Secondary investigation, though less 
expensive, may or may not ﬁt the exact 
needs of the researcher.
Formative + Summative Research
Formative or exploratory research is 
used to gain insight into an area of study 
or to help deﬁne a question. This kind of 
research is especially useful for design 
applications, because in the business of 
innovation, identifying and then clarifying 
communication issues is essential. 
Formative research aids in problem 
identiﬁcation and problem solving. There 
are a number of research tactics that could 
be considered formative, including (but 
not limited to) literature reviews, trend 
forecasting, video ethnography, surveys 
and questionnaires, demographics, and 
user testing. 
Summative or conclusive research is used 
to frame and decipher the outcome of an 
investigative process. It conﬁrms that the 
original hypothesis is correct or illustrates 
that it is ﬂawed. Summative research can

answer questions such as, “Did I do it 
correctly? Did I make it better? Is it more 
successful?” There are many research 
tactics than can be summative, including 
(but not limited to) focus groups, user 
testing, surveys and questionnaires, and 
web analytics.
Most research tactics can be either 
formative or summative, depending 
where and when they are employed 
during the cycle of a project. For example, 
user testing might be performed before 
beginning the design of a new website 
by having test subjects navigate selected 
URLs while tracking their responses. The 
data collected in those sessions would 
then inform navigational structures 
developed for the new site. A focus group 
could be used to determine a target 
audience or to evaluate a newly designed 
magazine cover. Observational research 
might be employed to assess information 
architecture at a library—both before new 
systems are implemented and afterward. 
The possibilities and combinations are as 
limitless as creativity, time, and resources 
will allow.
Formative research is 
conducted at the start of 
a project to help frame 
the design problem. 
Summative research 
is used to evaluate 
prototypes or ﬁnished 
products, measuring them 
against pre-established 
project goals.

Basic + Applied Research
Basic research may sound like something 
elementary or easy, but the term actually 
refers to research conducted to gain 
new knowledge within a speciﬁc area, 
or research undertaken to satisfy the 
curiosity or personal interest of the 
researcher. A deﬁning factor for basic 
research is that the activity isn’t initiated 
with intent for commercial application.  
In a design context, basic research 
may take the form of personal creative 
exploration through things such as 
drawing, painting, or photography. 
Experiments with form, composition, and 
color might then inﬂuence design decisions 
on future projects undertaken for clients. 
Designers may also experiment with new 
programming languages or software to 
add skill sets and learn new tools. While 
each of these scenarios may have indirect 
commercial application, the motivation and 
resulting creative outputs have not been 
commissioned by clients. They have been 
undertaken to explore ideas or techniques 
that add to the individual researcher’s 
toolbox, or provide a safe creative outlet to 
experiment with new concepts.
For designers, basic research supports 
the growth of the individual or creative 
team. Experiments conducted through 
basic research might later lead to new 
service offerings, client acquisitions, or 
entrepreneurial opportunities. 
Alternatively, applied research is the term 
for any research activity commissioned 
speciﬁcally for a project, or with the 
intent of commercial or public use. 
Applied research efforts are focused on 
developing new products, experiences 
or services, serving commercial and/or 
social needs.
Applied research is an increasingly 
expected component of design practice, 
conducted to identify and clarify issues 
related to project goals; inﬂuence 
aesthetic choices; meet the business 
problems of the of the client; and serve 
the needs of an audience.

TRIANGULATION
Conﬁrm Research Findings 
Triangulation is the process of combining 
several different research methods to 
illuminate one area of study, in other 
words using several research tools to 
examine the same thing. Triangulation is 
commonly used by the social sciences and 
adds credibility to qualitative research. 
By incorporating different tactics, the 
researcher can overcome issues of validity 
inherent with many singular qualitative 
approaches. The goal of triangulation is 
to conﬁrm the ﬁndings of each individual 
tactic by focusing on where the collected 
information overlaps. This area of overlap, 
called convergence, is considered to be the 
most accurate representation of truth.
Research ﬁndings can be triangulated in a 
number of ways. For example, secondary 
research triangulation would compare 
a variety of previously published data 
(perhaps aggregated via articles, books, 
journals, and reports). Method triangulation 
would compare the ﬁndings of multiple 
and varied research tactics (perhaps 
collected via focus groups, user testing, 
and observational research). Investigator 
triangulation would compare the ﬁndings 
of multiple researchers (perhaps collected 
over a period of time, or from multiple 
sessions in the ﬁeld). To be unequivocally 
thorough a researcher might employ 
multiple variations of triangulation, 
comparing areas of convergence.

STRATEGY:
LITERATURE 
REVIEW
Literature reviews are undertaken as 
a starting point for all other research 
strategies. A literature review is a comprehensive 
investigation of all documents, publications, articles, 
websites, and books regarding a speciﬁc area of 
study. This ﬁrst step in the research process can also 
include a client’s corporate communications, as well 
as those of their competitors, in which case it is often 
referred to as a communications audit.

 A literature review is an important 
initial step, allowing the researcher 
to become familiar with historical 
references and parallel associations, 
as well as current market conditions. 
Literature reviews can also clarify 
research problems and be inﬂuential 
in the development of investigation 
strategies during later phases of the 
creative process. 
Literature reviews help save time by 
enabling the design team to frame their 
problem and understand how similar 
communication problems may have been 
approached in the past. A comprehensive 
literature review will ensure that the 
researcher does not redouble efforts 
undertaken during previous investigations 
of the same subject. 
Literature reviews are a formative  
tactic, used to orient the researcher to 
the current body of knowledge in a given 
area. In client/designer relationships, 
a literature review can be undertaken 
to gain insight into corporate culture, 
competitor analysis, and market trends.  
It can even inﬂuence search engine 
optimization, use of social media, and 
media buying practices.
Literature reviews are a relatively  
easy task compared to many of the 
other forms of investigation discussed in 
this chapter. Literature reviews require 
a strategy for ﬁnding and extracting 
relevant information, which can be 
aided by the help of a librarian or 
other research professional. Librarians, 
whether at community or university 
institutions, are trained professionals 
who have extensive knowledge of and 
access to proprietary research tools 
unavailable to average Internet users. 
They can help guide a search and may 
also assist in locating credible source 
materials directly or tangentially related 
to the area under study.
Literature reviews 
compile secondary 
research from multiple 
sources to help the 
investigator become 
familiar with the area  
or problem being studied.
LITERATURE REVIEW

A Designer’s Research Manual
44
What is it?
A communication audit is a comprehensive 
review of an organization’s marketing 
materials and an assessment of the 
channels they use to communicate with 
clients, customers, or constituents. The goal 
is to better understand what a company is 
saying about itself, to whom, and how. 
What can it do?
Communication audits outline the 
messaging an organization intends to 
project, and analyze how it actually 
resonates with an audience. These 
audits determine if those messages are 
being received and understood. This 
undertaking builds on the information 
gathered in literature reviews by engaging 
with the audience through actions such 
as interviews, focus groups, surveys, 
and questionnaires. A communication 
audit can tell you if internal perspectives 
of an organization match external 
perspectives—and if not, where the 
messaging breaks down.  
How is it used?
Communication audits are used to 
illustrate how an organization’s internal 
image and external image overlap, and 
identify contradictions. This assessment 
can help reveal which components of 
current communication strategies are 
working, where there are disconnects, 
or even new or missed opportunities. 
Design teams can analyze the results of a 
communication audit, looking for holes, 
and then propose actions aimed at ﬁlling 
the gaps.   
When is it used?
Communication audits should be 
undertaken early in the research process 
to help diagnose breakdowns in existing 
messaging. Data collected through this 
exercise can inform which media channels 
to use, inﬂuence project messaging and 
approach, and support aesthetic rationale. 
Level of difﬁculty/complexity?
Communication audits are approachable. 
Most designers already collect information 
from new clients to establish a better 
understanding of history, brand, and 
audience. This extends the basic literature 
review process by assessing how those 
communication materials were received. 
In addition to basic business acumen 
and secondary research experience, 
interviewing know-how and strong 
interpersonal communication skills 
will help establish dialog and moderate 
discussions.

What is it?
Competitor proﬁling is the process of 
evaluating the strengths and weaknesses 
of an organization’s competition. It uses 
open-source intelligence—information 
published in the public domain (secondary 
sources)—to determine competitive 
advantages. 
What can it do?
Competitor proﬁling helps differentiate. 
This information can be used to enhance 
brand position, adjust or conﬁrm mission, 
and focus communication strategies—
revealing unique qualities that help a 
product, service, or organization stand out 
in a crowd.
Competitor proﬁling provides the designer 
with a broad understanding of their 
client’s market conditions. This knowledge 
can help a creative team communicate 
empathy for the factors inﬂuencing 
a company’s bottom line, the shared 
understanding mitigating perceptions of 
risk in new designer/client relationships. 
How is it used?
Think of competitor proﬁling as a 
communication audit of the competition. 
The goal is to draft approachable 
summaries of companies or organizations 
practicing in the same market (read more 
about communication audits on page 44). 
Competitor proﬁling requires the collection 
of open source information. Assembled 
proﬁles may include details about 
competitive companies’ history, ﬁnances, 
products, markets, facilities, personnel, 
brand positions, and marketing strategies. 
The facts, stats, and observations gathered 
are assembled into reports, used to 
determine the following about industry 
peers:
• What does Competitor A say about itself, 
to whom and how (social media presence, 
advertising, press releases, corporate 
communications pieces)?
• What do external audiences (customers and 
strategic partners) say about Competitor A?
• What are Competitor A’s discernible strengths 
and weaknesses?
When is it used?
Competitor proﬁling is a formative tool; 
use it at the beginning of a research plan 
to help the creative team understand 
market conditions and history. Combine 
with a communication audit and identify 
a client’s unique strengths and assets

Level of difﬁculty/complexity?
Competitor proﬁling is a feasible research 
strategy for many designers. While careful 
investigations may be time intensive, they 
can prove beneﬁcial when applied to a 
larger communication campaign. The 
information gathered can help determine 
messaging, media buys, target audiences, 
and other factors, and is essential 
to differentiating a client from other 
companies in their marketplace. 
When discussing competitor proﬁling, 
the term “competitive intelligence” 
can arise. Competitive intelligence 
combines the secondary source tools 
of competitor proﬁling with primary 
research. The goal of both strategies is 
the same, but competitive intelligence 
often employs much more aggressive 
tactics. Some corporations have gone 
as far as hiring “informants” on their 
competitor’s staff, or releasing—and then 
rehiring—an employee after he or she 
has worked for the competition. Many 
businesses now use no-compete clauses 
and conﬁdentiality agreements in an 
effort to prevent such practices. For the 
purposes of this discussion of research 
techniques and how they aid design 
practice, competitor proﬁling is a useful 
and ethical strategy when compiled from 
previously published material.  
Matchstic, a brand 
identity ﬁrm in Atlanta, 
shared a unique technique 
employed before 
designing corporate 
identity programs. They 
catalog the use of shapes, 
colors, even typography 
in competitors’ logos 
(similar to the chart 
shown here). The resulting 
report outlines that 
market’s aesthetic culture, 
providing easy points of 
differentiation for their 
client’s new mark.

In a design context, ethnographic research 
endeavors help the creative team understand what it’s 
like to be a member of their project’s target audience 
(Who is it for?). Immersing in the user’s perspective 
provides insight on how a design piece needs to 
perform (What will they do with it?). The empathy 
gained by being immersed in the user’s perspective 
may also expose new opportunities for design (How 
can we make this better?). 

Chapter 2: Research Strategies +Tactics
49
 Ethnography is a research  
strategy, created by anthropologists, 
that focuses on the link between 
human behaviors and culture. 
Ethnographers strive to understand 
and separate the emic perspective 
(pronounced ee-mik) from the etic 
perspective (pronounced eh-tik). Emic 
investigations deﬁne cultural phenomena 
through the perspective of the community 
under study. For example, to develop 
an emic understanding of graphic 
designers, one might conduct individual 
interviews directly with practicing design 
professionals. Etic investigations deﬁne 
cultural phenomena from the perspective 
of an individual who is not a participant 
in the community under study. So an etic 
view of graphic designers might be found 
by interviewing their clients or family 
members. Ethnographic researchers try 
to focus their efforts on understanding the 
internal perspective of the community, 
using outside perspectives only to augment 
the data gathered.
When choosing subjects for ethnographic 
study, geographic clusters, interests, ages, 
or a variety of other segmentation criteria 
can be used. Macro-ethnography studies 
large populations of people, whereas 
micro-ethnography conversely focuses on 
smaller populations. When a community 
has been chosen, the ethnographer—
sometimes called a ﬁeld-worker, or ﬁeld 
researcher—will conduct background 
research and identify a speciﬁc question 
to be examined. Immersion into the 
chosen culture is sometimes necessary 
for the researcher to gain credibility from 
participants (subjects won’t act “naturally” 
if they are uncomfortable or anxious about 
observation). The researcher may identify 
key “informants,” who then lead to other 
informants, using a snowball sampling 
method to conduct interviews and re-
interviews over an extended period of 
time. These interviews use open-ended 
questions to draw more details from the 
subject. Documentation of interviews, 
copious ﬁeld notes, photography, and 
video can provide valuable information  
in understanding end users in context. 
After researchers have developed a 
theory, they may return to the group to 
test that assumption. 
Though ethnography is qualitative 
research, the subjective observations made 
by the researcher are considered to be 
as much, if not more, valuable than any 
quantitative or objective data that may 
exist about the chosen community. This 
research strategy is considered subjective 
for several reasons:
• Some researchers may have previous 
experience with the group they are studying, 
while others may have no prior exposure at all. 
Therefore, observations collected by multiple 
researchers may occasionally conﬂict. 
• Because ethnographic research involves 
humans in a speciﬁc context, time and place, 
ethnographic research experiments can never 
be exactly replicated.

A Designer’s Research Manual
50
• No matter how objective the researcher tries to 
be, it is impossible to separate one’s personal 
worldview from interpretive observations. 
• The researchers cultural background and 
personal history may inﬂuence their observations 
and interactions with the group being studied.
Good researchers will also use several 
different tools to document the experiences 
leading up to their conclusions. This 
triangulation of interviews, recordings, 
ﬁeld notes, and photographs helps conﬁrm 
the researcher’s distilled observations. 
Additionally, many ethnographic inquiries 
occur over an extended period of time, and 
the deep immersion of the researcher adds 
to the validity of the study. 
Because ethnographic research involves 
the study of and interaction with human 
beings, researchers must make certain 
ethical considerations before engaging 
in ﬁeldwork. With rare exceptions, the 
community under investigation must 
be made aware of the intentions of the 
study and must agree to participate. The 
American Anthropological Association’s 
statement on professional ethics is a 
good resource for ethical guidelines. 
If working at or in partnership with a 
hospital, laboratory, or university, you 
should consult with its Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)—an entity created to ensure 
the ethical treatment of human subjects—
before undertaking any ethnographic 
study. IRBs can provide best practice 
guidelines and assistance drafting consent 
forms and other legal documentation 
that may be relevant to (or required for) 
the human subject components of your 
research program.   
Note: For more information on how to triangulate research, see 
page 40.

Market segments are 
often deﬁned by standard 
demographic categories 
such as age, sex, and 
race. That view alone 
may lead to the false 
assumption that certain 
individuals have little in 
common.

Mapping micro-ethno-
graphic groups around a 
variety of categories and 
specializations (personal 
interests, geography, 
career pathways, and 
so much more) can help 
researchers discover 
patterns of behavior that 
expand past traditional 
macro-enthnographic 
boundaries.

A Designer’s Research Manual
52
What is it?
When unstructured interviews are 
conducted in a location related to how a 
person will use a design piece, the process 
is called contextual inquiry. For example, if 
working on a new self-checkout interface, 
the researcher might conduct interviews 
at a grocery store, rather than bringing 
shoppers to a neutral setting, such as a 
conference room or lab. 
What can it do?
Contextual inquiry gives the researcher an 
opportunity to document what the subject 
actually does, instead of what they claim to 
do. This process places the user and their 
activities in context, permitting them to be 
the expert who demonstrates how tools, 
products, and services integrate into their 
daily experience. 
Contextual inquiry allows the design team 
to consider inﬂuencers such as physical 
space, objects in the environment, and 
expected time-on-task. It also provides an 
opportunity for the researcher to take cues 
from facial expressions, body language, 
and interpersonal interactions.
How is it used?
Contextual inquiry reveals the real-world 
user issues that might go undiscovered 
in a more sterile lab setting. This tool is 
especially important in design endeavors 
that strive to modify or change behavior. 
Contextual inquiry grants direct access to 
the user’s environment, highlighting the 
ways it may affect their activities. This 
provides a baseline for behavior, and 
allows the researcher to see ﬁrsthand 
where design might inﬂuence change. 
Insights collected from contextual inquiry 
can be aggregated into experience 
maps, which document the action from 
start to ﬁnish. These can chart a single 
user’s experience, or those of multiple 
participants. Multi-user maps can 
demonstrate continuity of experience, 
or identify gaps, and either result might 
reveal opportunities for design. The maps 
also become effective tools for sharing 
research analysis with team members and 
clients (read more about experience maps 
on page 124). 
When is it used?
Contextual inquiry is used as a formative 
tool, helping creative teams frame their 
assignment. Interviewing and observing 
the people using a product or service in the 
environment where it exists (or will exist), 
provides a critical understanding of use. 
Level of difﬁculty/complexity?
Contextual inquiry is a blend of 
observational research and unstructured 
interviews, so basic interpersonal and 
interview skills are essential. Since the 
researcher is trying to perform two 
separate tasks at the same time, conducting 
an interview and making observations, 
working in teams results in more accurate 
information gathering. Assign one 
researcher to engage in conversation with 
the participant, while another is taking ﬁeld 
notes, photos, or video.

Having help in the ﬁeld also provides 
a second perspective on the events 
witnessed, affording more observational 
validity. Follow-up immediately after 
information gathering to compare thoughts 
while the experience is still fresh. 
Whenever possible, record audio. This 
ensures your interpretation of the events 
remains accurate, and allows for sharing 
of research with team members and 
stakeholders not present during the 
original observation. They may hear 
things essential to the project that seemed

TACTIC:
OBSERVATIONAL 
RESEARCH
What is it? 
Observational research is the systematic 
process of viewing and recording human 
behavior and cultural phenomena without 
questioning, communicating with, or 
interacting with the group being studied. 
What can it do? 
Simply observing people and phenomena, 
rather than conducting interviews, may 
provide a great deal of useful information. 
Through the resulting documentation of 
social behavior, researchers learn many 
things about attitudes and perspectives 
without inﬂuencing group behavior. This 
tactic allows for greater observational 
validity because the group under study is 
unaware of the researcher. The researcher 
is able to record and analyze what the 
subjects are actually doing, rather than 
what they say they are doing. 
 
How is it used?
There are several keys to conducting 
successful observational research. The 
investigator must remain quiet and 
observant and try to understand the 
behaviors exhibited. It is important to 
remain objective, and therefore not 
interact with subjects. In this case, the 
researcher does not ask questions or solicit 
opinions—the focus, instead, is to watch 
and closely examine group behavior.
Observational research can be conducted 
in different ways. Researchers can go into 
the ﬁeld and record their observations, 
or they can record images mechanically 
with video cameras (for example, to study 
human trafﬁc patterns in an airport). 
Of course, if images are recorded with 
cameras, it is important to the anonymous 
nature of the study that those devices be 
concealed. This kind of research can also 
be conducted in controlled laboratory 
settings—as is done in purchase labs, 
artiﬁcial environments in which research 
participants buy products. The use of 
purchase labs does, however, stray 
somewhat from tenets of traditional 
observational research, since participants 
do know that they are part of a study, 
which may inﬂuence their behavior. 
When is it used?
Observational research can be used in a 
formative fashion before a hypothesis is 
established. Notations from this process 
provide valuable insight into the behaviors 
of the target audience. Assumptions 
derived from observational research 
should be used as part of a multilateral 
process of discovery. They can also be 
used to support design decisions, as a 
form of evidence. 
Level of difﬁculty/complexity?
To be reliable and fulﬁll project objectives, 
the investigator must be trained to 
document his or her observations and 
must have a strong understanding of 
research goals. Observational validity may 

Chapter 2: Research Strategies +Tactics
55
be higher in this case (compared with 
visual anthropology), as the researcher is 
not inﬂuenced by the subject’s opinions. 
However, the investigator’s personal bias 
still can skew the documentation. Another 
problem with this tactic is that only public 
behavior is visible. Individuals often 
behave differently in solitary or smaller 
group settings, and ethical considerations 
prevent hidden cameras from intruding 
into private scenarios. Observational 
research also rarely gives an indication of 
the true motivations driving the behavior 
being witnessed.   
Observational research 
can be conducted in 
the subjects' normal 
environment or in 
specially constructed 
labs. For example, 
observation of consumers 
in retail environments 
may help provide 
insights into their 
shopping experience. 
However, when dealing 
with a rights protected 
group, such as children, 
laboratory settings may 
be more appropriate.

TACTIC:
PHOTO 
ETHNOGRAPHY
What is it? 
Photo ethnography is a ﬁeld exercise 
in which subjects are asked to record 
their daily experiences with still or video 
cameras. Participants capture their own 
behaviors, motivations, and attitudes by 
documenting them with images over an 
extended period of time. Researchers then 
combine individual case studies to form 
a larger understanding of the community 
being studied. This practice is similar 
to visual anthropology because both use 
visual media for interpreting cultural 
human behavior. Visual anthropology 
differs by placing the camera in the hand 
of the researcher rather than in the hand 
of the subject. 
What can it do? 
Photo ethnography can help illuminate 
the emic, or internal, perspective of the 
community or individual under study 
(“How do the elderly view themselves?”). 
Analysis of the collected images can 
provide the researcher with insight into 
the lives, needs, and motivations of the 
subject(s) and may also help identify ways 
to communicate with them. 
How is it used?
Photo ethnography should be a part of a 
larger research strategy and not a stand-
alone exercise. As stated previously, 
ethnography is subjective and cannot 
be replicated, so other methods of data 
collection should be used to qualify the 
researcher’s position.
When is it used?
Photo ethnography is often used as 
formative research, to help gain better 
understanding of the intended audience’s 
needs and behaviors. This kind of study 
can be used as a method in problem 
solving or in problem identiﬁcation.  
Level of difﬁculty/complexity?
Before undertaking a photo ethnographic 
study, the researcher must ﬁrst complete 
investigations to identify participants 
(also called informants) representative 
of the larger community. Some time will 
then be spent training those participants 
on image-capturing skills. (Training 
time will vary depending on skill; for 
example, operating a digital camera and 
uploading the collected ﬁles can prove 
complex for some participants.) Photo 
ethnography can be relatively inexpensive 
and places control in the hands of the 
subjects, essentially making them self-
ethnographers. An added beneﬁt of this 
tactic is the psychological buy-in created 
by involving the subject directly in the 
investigation. Conversely, problems with 
observational validity may occur because 
the participants are actively aware of 
what they are supposed to be cataloging 
and therefore may alter their “normal” 
behavior. Additional issues may arise if 
participants are not able to objectively 
select or capture images that accurately 
represent their larger community.

What is it?
Self ethnography (also referred to as auto 
ethnography) is an investigative method 
where an individual documents his or her 
own experience, acting as both researcher 
and participant. In a design context, the 
researcher/participant engages in an 
activity speciﬁc to the intended audience 
in an effort to better understand the users’ 
experience ﬁrsthand.  
What can it do?
Self ethnography provides a personal lens 
into the world of the user. It allows the 
design team to familiarize itself with issues 
relevant to its audience, gained through 
primary interaction with the activities, 
products, or services under investigation. 
It is used to gain a deep understanding 
of speciﬁc experiences, and to look for 
ways to enhance or improve them. This 
ﬁrst-person participation establishes 
a depth of empathy, revealing issues 
that may have gone unnoticed in other 
information collecting methods. Because 
the researcher is directed to be hyper-
aware and document every detail, self 
ethnography can even reveal new insights 
in commonplace situations.  
Self ethnography is a useful tool to kick-
start the primary research phase of a 
project. It doesn’t require the recruitment 
of prospective research participants, and 
the associated screening, scheduling and 
coordination related to other types of  
ﬁeld research. 
How is it used?
Information collected during self 
ethnography can take the form of ﬁeld 
notes, user diaries, photography, and 
video, that can then be shared with the 
creative team for analysis. 
Like contextual inquiry, insights collected 
from self ethnography can be aggregated 
into experience maps, which document 
the activity from start to ﬁnish. Research 
gathered from multiple participants can be 
cross-referenced to reveal opportunities 
for design intervention. The assembled 
ﬁndings can be shared with project 
stakeholders and used to provide rationale 
for future decision making. (Read more 
about contextual inquiry on page 52, and 
experience maps on page 124.) 
When is it used?
Self ethnography is used at the start of 
a project, helping to frame the design 
problem. Insights gained through the 
personal experience of self ethnography 
can formulate additional research 
questions and help plan subsequent 
research activities.

Level of difﬁculty/complexity?
Self ethnographic studies can be 
immersive, and require the researcher/
participant to be reﬂective and honest 
about the experience. Repeating the 
experience, recording multiple rounds of 
observation and reﬂection, will provide 
more observational validity. Because self 
ethnography relies on an individual’s 
perspective, if possible, assign more than 
one researcher/participant to collect data. 
Sending more than one person into the 
ﬁeld provides a broader perspective of the 
experience being studied and accounts for 
personal biases.

ethnographic journaling 
as a tool for self-
reﬂection. The journal

TACTIC:
UNSTRUCTURED 
INTERVIEWS
What are they? 
Unstructured interviews are an information 
gathering tactic where the researcher 
allows the participant to guide the direction 
of the interview. 
That is not to say that the interviewer 
doesn’t do extensive secondary research 
on the area to be discussed! A list of 
topics to cover and a set of questions are 
prepared in advance. The goal of this tactic 
is to foster a comfortable rapport with the 
research participants, letting them openly 
describe their understandings, feelings, and 
interpretations in their own words.
 
What can they do?
Unstructured interviews allow the 
researcher to see through the eyes of 
the respondent, uncovering relevant 
information speciﬁc to that individual or 
group. They can reveal primary knowledge 
of the participant’s beliefs, interests, and 
opinions. Often the information gathered 
was known only to the participant, so an 
unstructured interview may also reveal 
areas of opportunity for the project not 
previously imagined by the designer. 
How are they used?
Use unstructured interviews to help frame 
a problem. The information gathered can 
determine project objectives or priorities. 
Here are some tips for successful 
interviews using this tactic: 
• Craft a plan. Before the interview determine 
what kind of information you want to collect, 
and draft the questions that you want to cover—
but be adaptable should the conversation go 
in different directions. Adhering to a list of 
questions too closely can impede the organic 
nature of the dialog.
• Ask open-ended questions. The structure of 
your questions should allow participants to 
answer in their own words. Avoid yes/no 
questions, or questions that can be answered 
in a single word. 
• Be persistent. If a participant doesn't provide 
adequate feedback to a particular question, 
come back to it from another direction later 
in the session. If an answer is unclear, ask 
for clariﬁcation. When applicable, ask the 
participant to show you or teach you how to 
do something (even if you’re already familiar 
with the task). 
• Use human nature to your advantage. We’re 
all uncomfortable with pauses in conversation. If 
you feel participants are not providing adequate 
feedback to your questions, don’t say anything 
after their response. Be sure to look them in the 
eye and smile, but wait. Forcing them to ﬁll the 
empty space can lead to richer answers.
• Bring a friend. Often, taking ﬁeld notes  
while conducting the interview can be difﬁcult 
because you’re focused on two things at once. 
Bring along a partner to take notes and pay 
attention to body language so you can focus 
on the conversation. Afterward you and your 
colleague can compare impressions; two 
opinions provide more observational validity.

UNSTRUCTURED 
INTERVIEW
When are they used?
Unstructured interviews are a 
formative activity, generally scheduled 
at the beginning of a project to help 
establish context, conﬁrm, or invalidate 
assumptions from secondary research, 
and reveal concerns relevant to the 
user. This tactic is particularly useful 
when engaging with a new experience, 
problem, or group of people. 
Level of difﬁculty/complexity?
Conducting unstructured interviews is 
relatively easy, but does require some 
practice on the part of the interviewer. 
People skills are essential. The researcher 
needs to be comfortable with letting the 
participant lead the dialog. This may mean 
multiple interviews will be necessary to 
cover all areas relevant to your study.
Unstructured interviews 
allow the participant  
to drive the conversation, 
sometimes meandering 
into unknown 
areas. While more 
time consuming, 
the unstructured 
approach allows for 
deeper exploration of  
participants' unique 
perspectives—in their  
own words.

TACTIC:
VISUAL 
ANTHROPOLOGY
What is it? 
Visual anthropology is another ﬁeld 
research tactic that uses visual media to 
aid interpretations of cultural behavior. 
Visual anthropology differs from photo 
ethnography by placing the camera 
in the trained hands of the researcher 
rather than in the untrained hands of a 
subject. These investigations can help to 
illuminate an etic, or external, perspective 
of the community under study (“How are 
the elderly viewed by others?”). Visual 
anthropology may also include a review 
of cultural representation in areas such 
as performance, museums and cultural 
institutions, art, ﬁlm, and mass media. In 
these cases the investigation provides a 
secondary emic perspective, answering 
a question such as “How do the elderly 
view themselves?” by reviewing artwork 
created by octogenarians, or ﬁlms directed 
by Clint Eastwood when in his eighties. 
 
What can it do? 
Visual anthropology provides a collection 
of discernible samples that help the 
researcher gain insight into the common 
cultural understandings of the community 
being studied. 
 
How is it used?
Use visual anthropology studies as  
a method of documentation, augmenting 
other ethnographic research practices  
to illuminate understanding of a  
target group. 
When is it used?
Visual anthropology, similar to photo 
ethnography, is suited to formative 
research. Visual anthropology can help 
determine the behaviors, attitudes, and 
preferences of the target audience. Using 
visual anthropology as a tool may help 
the designer discover previously unknown 
factors. Information attained using this 
tactic can help deﬁne a problem or 
formulate a hypothesis. 
Level of difﬁculty/complexity?
This method of documentation 
addresses the problems inherent in 
photo ethnography by placing the lens 
in the hands of a trained researcher, 
through whose objective vantage point 
the relevance of events and symbols 
are cataloged. However, issues of 
observational validity still occur because 
the subject is aware of being under 
observation and thus may not behave  
in a truly candid fashion.

perceived concerns of the

group is represented 
in the media. For

MULTI-CULTURAL ASSIGNMENT,  
MULTILATERAL RESEARCH
 In creating a retail presence for a 
new shampoo, we faced enormous 
challenges that required intensive and 
unique research. Our large corporate 
client markets everyday and luxury 
necessities internationally, but had 
only focused on developed countries.
Our client was looking to tap into the 
endless opportunities in the markets of 
developing nations. They knew that the 
developing world buys and sells goods 
differently and that methods of retail 
communication used in modern retail are 
not effective in those countries. This client 
has presence throughout the world, so 
we examined buying and selling tactics 
in eighty prominent developing countries 
and found similarities in the stores across 
these regions.
Most developing markets feature small, 
locally run shops that have disorganized 
and cluttered retail displays. Beauty soap 
may appear next to a box of biscuits or 
even a pack of cigarettes. Additionally, 
these markets do not have a steady supply 
of electricity and often face extreme 
weather conditions.
Research helped us develop a deep 
understanding of the diverse cultures being 
examined so we could create designs that 
would work in a wide variety of developing 
regions. Our challenge was to come up 
with retail design solutions that would 
reinforce global brand equity, answer some 
of the issues that our research exposed, 
and attract shoppers in small corner shops 
across all these regions.

Chapter 2: Research Strategies + Tactics
Since the purpose of this exercise was to 
understand the possibilities and limitations 
of traditional, compact shops, extensive 
photo-documentation and classiﬁcation 
of shops across all relevant markets was 
required. Research was done by local 
client teams, our partners from The Design 
Alliance in Asia, and designer friends from 
Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and 
Latin America.
Along with photographs, we collected 
some basic information about the shops. 
This primarily consisted of ﬂoor area, 
orientation, shop layouts, illumination, 
display space, display patterns, frequency 
of change, and other factors.
This research was followed by three other 
elements:
• Shopper observations: The people purchasing 
consumer goods in developing nations are 
almost always female. Our teams observed the 
shopper’s path, focus, concerns, angle of vision, 
questions to the shop’s staff, and the relation 
between her shopping list and actual purchase, 
as well as what she noticed ﬁrst, and whether it 
had any impact on her purchase.
• Unstructured interviews: Along with a research 
company, our team interviewed shoppers to 
get insights into preferences for colors, shapes, 
and materials. These interviews also helped us 
classify the preferences of planned shoppers 
and impulse shoppers.
• Focus group discussions with shop-owners: 
This was done with the help of a research 
agency. We worked with ﬁve groups of shop-
owners to get their understanding of shopper 
behavior and successful display ideas. They 
also provided insights on the effects of weather, 
certain colors, materials, shapes, maintenance 
of point-of-sale devices, power consumption, 
and other factors.
Based on our analysis of the above, 
Elephant came to the following conclusions:
• Product placement is crucial for the impulse 
shopper, while the planned shopper wants the 
product to be on the same shelf every time.
• The most crucial time to engage a shopper is 
when she is standing at the counter, waiting for 
the staff to ﬁnd the product from her list.
• Anything in the line of vision during this wait is 
noticed and registered.
• Movement, unusual shapes, shine, glitter, 
shimmer, and sound attract attention. 
• Although any promotion outside the shop is 
easily seen by the passerby, the shopper may 
or may not notice it. When she enters the shop, 
she is either placing her car keys inside her 
bag, ﬁnding her shopping list, returning the 
phone call she had to miss while driving, or is 
otherwise distracted.
• If a counter is very crowded, the shopper 
concentrates on her money rather than displays.
These ﬁndings became the brief for 
point-of-sale and shelving devices for the 
shampoo brand in developing countries. 
Without the research, a well-deﬁned brief 
could not have been achieved, and as a 
result, the design solutions may have been 
inaccurate.

Marketing research and market analysis 
are two frequently confused terms. Marketing 
research is a form of sociology that focuses on the 
understanding of human behavior as it applies to a 
market-based economy. The term does not refer to 
a singular research method but rather a multilateral 
strategy used to describe a broad sampling of 
research practices surrounding consumer preferences.  

Chapter 2: Research Strategies +Tactics
67
 Market analysis, in contrast, 
is a quantitative business tool 
that measures the growth and 
composition of markets or business 
sectors. Market analysis considers 
elements such as interest rates, stock 
performance, price movements, 
and other measurable statistics that 
deﬁne the ﬁnancial climate in which a 
business operates. 
For example, a manufacturing company 
might commission a market analysis 
to determine trends in outsourcing 
fabrication to foreign countries to help 
advise an appropriate location for its 
next assembly plant. In this instance, 
that same manufacturing company 
might commission marketing research 
to determine the opinions of consumers 
regarding the need for a new version of a 
classic product. Would a new version be 
covetable? Would a new version replace 
the classic model, or is there enough 
consumer loyalty to support both?
Marketing research can be used to 
gather information about any number 
of marking related issues, including 
new product launches, brand equity, 
consumer decision-making processes, 
the effectiveness of advertising, and even 
leveraging against competitors.
Depending on the question being asked or 
the issue under investigation, marketing 
research can be either qualitative or 
quantitative as well as formative or 
summative. Qualitative practices may 
include such tactics as focus groups, 
interviews, or other observational 
techniques. This approach often samples 
randomly from a large population, 
conducting surveys or distributing 
questionnaires that are then statistically 
scored. In an exploratory (formative) 
role, marketing research can be used to 
determine an area in need of investigation: 
Would the market support an offshoot 
of this brand speciﬁcally targeted at 
teenagers? In a conclusive (summative) 
role, marketing research can be used 
to better understand such things as the 
effectiveness of an advertising campaign 
or consumers’ opinions regarding new or 
existing brands and products: What were 
teenagers’ new brand perceptions, and did 
they prefer the original?
As with all well-designed research plans, 
the results yielded by marketing research 
are the most accurate when several 
different tactics are used to inform a 
conclusion, rather than depending on one 
tool to determine the results.

TACTIC:
DEMOGRAPHICS
What are they? 
Demographics are collections of statistical 
data that describe a group of people or a 
market segment. Demographics generally 
include information on a variety of 
quantiﬁable cultural, economic, and social 
characteristics.  
What can they do? 
By grouping people into segments based 
on demographic variables, researchers 
can use the collected data to create 
hypothetical proﬁles. This research tactic 
can provide insight regarding what groups 
of people are doing, thinking, or buying. 
Common demographic variables include 
age, gender, sexual orientation, household 
size, personal income and family income, 
education, race, and religion.  
How are they used? 
Researchers study demographic data to 
clarify their understanding of the needs 
and motivations of individual market 
segments. 
When are they used?
Demographics provide formative 
information and therefore should be 
used at the start of a project to deﬁne an 
audience. 
Level of difﬁculty/complexity?
Marketing research ﬁrms can be hired 
to conduct primary demographics using 
proprietary resources and software. 
In addition, access to demographic 
information collected by both for-
proﬁt and nonproﬁt organizations is 
widely available as a form of secondary 
research. It is important to note that 
demographic proﬁling often makes broad 
generalizations about groups of people 
that do not account for the unique qualities 
of individuals—who may not always 
behave in the predicted fashion.

TACTIC:
PSYCHOGRAPHICS
What is it? 
Psychographics are a quantitative tactic 
used to measure subjective beliefs, 
opinions, and interests. In other words, this 
tactic is a quantitative tool for measuring 
qualitative information. Similar to 
demographic research, which gathers data 
on age, gender, race, and other factors, it 
instead counts information about opinions, 
religious beliefs, music tastes, personality 
traits, and lifestyles. 
What can it do? 
Psychographics can help the researcher 
gain valuable insight into the opinions and 
preferences of the groups being studied.  
How is it used?
Use psychographics in a manner similar to 
the way you’d use demographics, keeping 
in mind that psychographics measure 
inherently subjective data. This research 
tactic, whether employed in a primary or 
secondary fashion, will help you clarify a 
creative approach by illuminating a target 
market’s opinions and preferences.
When is it used?
Psychographics can be used for problem 
identiﬁcation or problem solving. It is best 
used in the early phases of the design 
process in conjunction with demographic 
research, ethnographic research, and 
personas. 
Level of difﬁculty/complexity? 
Most designers outsource primary 
psychographic studies to marketing 
research ﬁrms who specialize in the 
process. Often these are undertaken 
in conjunction with demographic 
investigations of the same group. 
Secondary psychographic data may be 
more readily available and thus more cost 
effective, but, as previously noted, will not 
be customized to the target market.
Though demographic 
and psychographic 
research may seem 
similar, psychographic 
research attempts to 
quantify subjective 
information, such as 
opinions, beliefs and 
lifestyle choices.

TACTIC:
FOCUS GROUPS
What are they? 
Focus groups are a social science tool 
used prevalently to conduct market 
research. Focus groups are organized 
discussions with a limited number of 
participants, led by a moderator. The 
goal of these discussions is to gain insight 
into the participants’ views about a given 
topic. Unlike survey research, which is 
primarily quantitative, focus groups are 
qualitative exercises because they allow 
the researcher to understand the opinions 
and attitudes of the respondents. This type 
of research is different from the similar 
methods of one-on-one interviewing 
and group interviews, as it allows for 
interaction among the participants. 
What can they do? 
Focus groups allow for interpersonal 
communication and interaction between 
participants. This kind of dialogue can 
lead to new topics of discussion originally 
unforeseen by the researcher. Additionally, 
participants know that their opinions 
are valued, or that they are considered 
experts—leading them to feel ownership 
of the process and provide possible 
solutions. Also, focus group research can 
be done relatively quickly without huge 
demands on time and ﬁscal resources. 
Qualitative in nature, focus groups don’t 
require the same number of participants/
responders as survey or poll research and 
can therefore be assembled and evaluated 
in a more timely fashion. 
How are they used? 
Moderating the session well is key to 
collecting viable data. It is important to 
make sure that participants stay focused 
on the questions asked, while giving 
them room to deviate should new issues 
arise. All participants must also feel that 
they are being engaged by the group and 
feel comfortable enough to participate 
in the discussion. Most important, the 
moderator must stay neutral so that he or 
she does not ask leading questions that 
might skew participant responses.
Focus groups usually consist of six to 
ten people. If the group is too small, the 
conversation may lag or be dominated by 
a few individuals. Conversely, if the group 
is too large, discourse may become too 
difﬁcult for the moderator to facilitate. 
Large groups may also lead to distracting 
side discussions among respondents or 
cause some participants not to engage in 
the dialogue at all.
Individual background is an important 
consideration when selecting participants. 
It is essential to choose people with similar 
characteristics, backgrounds, or interests 
so that they feel comfortable talking to 
one another. If respondents are on the 
opposite ends of an issue, the conversation 
can become heated, preventing a free 
exchange of ideas. Depending on the 
subject, several focus groups may have to 
be held in order to get a representative 
view of the issue. People also feel more 
comfortable sharing their opinions with 
people they don’t know, so limit focus 
groups to individuals that have no prior  
history with one another.

Chapter 2: Research Strategies +Tactics
71
When are they used?
Focus groups can be formative or 
summative depending on the nature 
of the design problem that they are 
addressing. This research tactic can be 
used to collect new information before a 
project starts. Or at key points during an 
iterative creative process to get feedback 
from potential users in order to reﬁne 
prototypes. (More on iterative design on 
page 105). As summative evaluation, 
focus groups can be used to assess the 
acceptance of a new campaign or gauge 
customer satisfaction levels. 
Level of difﬁculty/complexity?
Though focus group research has many 
beneﬁts, there are a couple of potential 
conﬂicts to take into consideration. As 
with most group dynamics, dominant 
personalities may sway the opinions being 
expressed in a certain direction. Careful 
selection and good facilitation on the part 
of the moderator can help circumvent 
this issue; therefore hiring or assigning 
trained moderators is a good investment 
in the success of the survey. Additionally, 
the results of focus groups are based 
entirely on the assumption that the people 
participating are being totally honest. 
Often, what people say they do is radically 
different from what is really happening. 
Preparing for these scenarios, and 
supplementing focus group research with 
other forms of information gathering, will 
lead to more accurate results.
While diversity of opinion 
is essential to focus group 
research, to ensure a free-
ﬂowing dialogue among 
participants, be sure 
to group together 6–9 
people who have similar 
experience. Radically 
divergent opinions can 
create conﬂict. To ensure 
validity of your ﬁndings, 
conduct more than 
one focus group, each 
representing a different 
type of end user.

SURVEYS + 
QUESTIONNAIRES
What are they? 
Survey research is a tactic for collecting 
quantitative information by asking 
participants a set of questions in speciﬁc 
order. Questions are administered to a 
sample of individuals, representative 
of a larger population. If a researcher 
administers the questions, it is called 
a survey or structured interview. If 
participants answer questions on their 
own, either online or by ﬁlling out a piece 
of paper, it is called a questionnaire. 
What can they do? 
Surveys and questionnaires can be used 
to collect information about the opinions 
and preferences of a deﬁned group, or 
to collect factual information, such as a 
census report. These investigations give 
the researcher the ability to collect large 
amounts of information from a wide 
population in a relatively short amount 
of time. Questions should be written 
and structured in ways to increase the 
reliability of valid ﬁndings; therefore, 
trained experts are the best resources for 
developing this content. 
How are they used? 
Use surveys and questionnaires to 
gather demographic (fact-based) or 
psychographic (opinion-based) data. 
When are they used? 
Use surveys as formative research, to gain 
insight into the opinions and desires of 
the target audience. This information can 
then be used to guide design decisions 
during project development. It can also 
be used as summative research, to 
support or conﬁrm creative solutions, or 
to understand the effects of a creative 
campaign. For example, a group of 
frequent online shoppers may be asked 
to ﬁll out a questionnaire regarding new 
features just added to the website they are 
using. Responses can be used to determine 
whether users are satisﬁed with or 
confused by the new tools. 
Level of difﬁculty/complexity? 
Survey research can be a cost-effective 
tool for gathering information from a 
large population, and there are many 
companies and organizations that 
can be retained to help construct and 
administer questions. Because of the 
complex structure, writing, and scoring 
inherent in survey research, working with 
a specialist will help increase accuracy—
missteps along the way can lead to invalid 
results. However, if there is no budget 
for outsourcing, tremendous amounts of 
information are available in the public 
domain to help guide the process.

User experience, also sometimes called user 
experience design, employs a broad range of 
techniques designed to measure a product’s ability 
to satisfy the needs of the end user (accessibility, 
functionality, ease of use) while also meeting project 
requirements (budget, size, technical requirements).  

Chapter 2: Research Strategies +Tactics
75
 The research methods employed in 
user experience are most commonly 
used in interactive and web design, 
but many of the concepts can apply to 
any product intended for human use—
digitally delivered or otherwise.
Usability in interactive and web design has 
been linked to several key performance 
indicators:
• Staying under budget: User testing in the  
early stages of development, as formative 
research in an iterative design process (more 
on iterative design on page 105), will ensure 
that usability hurdles are cleared before the 
project moves to production. Correcting 
usability issues after a project is launched can 
cost signiﬁcant time and money.
• Higher ROI (return on investment): High 
usability, through user testing and iterative 
design, can lead to increased sales, business 
leads, and lower customer support costs.
• Increased customer satisfaction: Sites designed 
with user testing practices will provide positive 
viewer experiences, leading to higher customer 
satisfaction and positive brand associations.
Many corporations and universities 
specialize in advanced usability testing 
for web and interactive media and have 
labs designed around those speciﬁc 
purposes. User participants are asked to 
complete a set of “tasks”: for example, 
locate a press release, purchase something 
with a shopping cart, or live chat with 
a company representative. They are not 
given any step-by-step instructions or 
guidance, so the lab environment mimics 
a typical user experience. Participants 
are timed throughout the process, and 
often observed through double-blind 
mirrors. In some cases, these labs have 
technology that can record, in real time, 
the movements of a user’s eyes as they 
navigate information on the screen. This 
data can be compared with the movements 
tracked by the user’s mouse, illuminating 
the user’s perspective on active content. 
Though expensive to undertake, this kind 
of detailed analysis is often invaluable.

What is it?
A/B testing evaluates two different design 
solutions, testing each with a unique 
group of users to measure feedback and 
responses. Subsequent comparison of 
the feedback collected from both groups 
helps determine which iteration is more 
successful.
What can it do?
A/B testing allows for comparative analysis 
of design solutions. In some scenarios, 
testing proposed designs against existing 
collateral allows the creative team to 
gauge the effectiveness of new aesthetics 
or concepts. It can also be used to evaluate 
or update speciﬁc components of a design, 
such as changing navigation, or adding 
new features or tools. In an online setting, 
A/B testing can be done while a site is live, 
redirecting some users to option A and 
others to option B, collecting actual user 
data over a period time for analysis. 
How is it used?
A/B testing can be used as part of any 
research plan, but is most commonly 
associated with user experience design 
projects. This process can help evaluate 
the success of design iterations or address 
speciﬁc, documented usability issues. 
In these instances it’s important to test 
incremental change, to determine how 
minor variations in design inﬂuence user 
feedback. It is difﬁcult to determine which 
variable a user is responding to when 
radical changes are shown. Feedback is 
only valid if the test group resembles the 
intended target audience.   
When is it used?
Use A/B testing to evaluate new concepts, 
address existing problem areas, or assess 
proposed changes. The process produces 
insights before costly, time-intensive 
development phases begin.
Level of difﬁculty/complexity?
On a basic level, A/B testing can be done 
quickly and inexpensively on any type of 
design project by establishing a “control” 
to test against (often an existing design), 
and developing the parameters for 
assessment (ex: Does new photography 
improve the experience?). When A/B 
testing, it is essential to establish a clear, 
speciﬁc question that can be answered 
through the testing process. If this is 
not deﬁned, iterations might continue 
indeﬁnitely.
For online projects, there are many  
third-party resources to help plan and 
execute A/B testing, providing quantitative 
results through web analytics.

What are they?
Analytics, sometimes referred to as web 
statistics or technographic research, are 
a form of quantitative analysis that uses 
concrete metrics to track user behavior 
online. A designer can gain valuable 
insight into the users’ needs and interests 
by measuring key variables through the 
course of a user visit. 
What can they do? 
Analytics can provide the designer with 
a lot of information about users’ viewing 
habits. For example, a designer can tell 
where users have come from (both via 
geographic location and via referring web 
domains); which pages are being visited 
most; how long users are staying on those 
pages; how long they stay at the site as 
a whole; at which times of day people 
are looking; and the bandwidths they are 
using to connect. These statistics may 
help the designer when thinking about 
where and when to run ads, whether the 
site is being viewed at work or at home, 
and can also help inform future technical 
considerations such as the use of video or 
complex interactive features.
How are they used? 
Looking at technographic data for the ﬁrst 
time can be daunting. Listed below are 
some of the basics to get you started:
• Hits: A hit is a request for any ﬁle from a web 
server. For example, when a user requests 
a webpage that has two images on it, that 
request will result in three hits. One hit is for 
the page, and one for each of the images, 
because all of those ﬁles are necessary to 
display that individual page. 
• Page Views: Page views are a more accurate 
measurement of web trafﬁc because they 
indicate the use of individual pages rather 
than server hits. As stated in the example 
above, a single page view might result in 
several server hits because of image ﬁles, 
style sheets, and so on.
• Visits/Sessions: A visit, or session, is the 
amount of time that a user spends on a website. 
For example, if a user requests a page and 
stays at that page for thirty seconds, that 
counts as a visit. When the amounts of visits 
are totaled for an extended period of time, the 
amount of trafﬁc to the site can be determined.
• Visitors/Unique Visitors: These terms refer to a 
user who visits a website more than once within 
a speciﬁed period of time. Web stat software is 
able to differentiate between visitors who come 
only once to the site and unique visitors who 
return. This information differs from a site’s hits 
or page views—which are measured by the 
number of ﬁles that are requested from a site—
because they are measured according to the 
users’ IP addresses, which are unique to every 
computer on the web. 
TACTIC:
ANALYTICS

Chapter 2: Research Strategies +Tactics
79
When are they used?
Web analytics can produce formative and 
summative data. In a formative role, they 
can help the designer understand which 
features or content users ﬁnd valuable in a 
current design. This information can then 
direct future iterations. In a summative 
role, they can tell the designer whether a 
redesign has increased visits, or whether a 
new feature is being used.
Level of difﬁculty/complexity? 
Hosting providers for websites often 
supply web analytics software. Often 
the tools provided go far beyond these 
basic functions and include features that 
indicate the user’s platform, bandwidth, 
peak usage hours, and even location. More 
comprehensive web analytic studies can 
be outsourced to companies that specialize 
in evaluating this type of data. Those ﬁrms 
have developed proprietary tools that go 
beyond what a web hosting company can 
provide. While this information may seem 
to be web-centric, the information gathered 
from web metrics can also help inform 
broader campaigns by indicating which 
types of information interest users and 
where users are geographically clustered.

What is it?
Card sorting collects feedback about 
information architecture by allowing 
participants to organize content in 
hierarchies that make the most sense 
to them. Subjects are given numbered 
cards, representing content, and asked 
to structure that information in a logical 
sequence. Each sort can be recorded, 
providing measurable data for the design 
team. While the sorts are scored, they 
measure subjective opinions, making it a 
qualitative exercise. Card sorts can reveal 
audience preference for different types 
of content, methods of communication, 
features, tools, or even ideas. 
What can it do?
Card sorting helps establish logical 
hierarchies of information, and identify 
user preferences and priorities. It’s also 
a simple way to engage an audience, 
allowing them to create structures that 
are meaningful and relevant to them. 
That’s why this method is also useful 
when engaging new clients or starting 
new projects. Performing sorts with key 
stakeholders can help everyone agree on 
the relative importance of project goals. 
In this context, card sorting is used as a 
communication tool and consensus builder 
between designer and client. 
How is it used?
There are two ways to approach card 
sorting: 
Open Sort—Subjects are presented with 
randomized cards then asked to organize 
them into representative groups, labeling the 
resulting clusters in their own words. Participants 
are asked to group like cards and structure 
hierarchies. In some cases, blank cards are 
provided for adding information to the deck. 
Open card sorts tell researchers how people 
organize and label information, and/or how 
they prioritize content, functions, and features. 
Closed Sort—Subjects are given cards 
and asked to place them in categories 
predetermined by the design team. Closed 
sorts conﬁrm the ﬁndings of previous open sorts 
and other research methods. They can also 
be helpful integrating new content or tools into 
existing designs. 
When is it used?
Card sorting is a formative tool. Use it 
early in your process to clarify areas 
of uncertainty or conﬁrm original 
assumptions. When conducted in person, 
this method is especially valuable 
because it helps begin a dialog between 
the creative team and their audience. 
Researchers can ask why decisions are 
being made, and encourage the participant 
to expand their discussion beyond the 
cards provided.  
TACTIC:
CARD SORTING

Chapter 2: Research Strategies +Tactics
81
Level of difﬁculty/complexity?
Card sorting is approachable. It’s 
often done by hand, utilizing simple 
and inexpensive tools such as sticky 
notes or index cards. There are also 
affordable online tools and mobile apps 
that allow you to create virtual cards for 
users to manipulate. These digital sorts 
automatically tally and collect data, and 
many present visualizations of the results. 
Although research teams can certainly 
tally with custom spreadsheets and create 
their own reporting tools. 
Card sorts require interpersonal 
communication skills, as it may be necessary 
to engage participants in the process 
(similar to conducting an unstructured 
interview or facilitating a focus group). 
Whenever possible, bring another 
researcher along to make observations and 
take ﬁeld notes. Often the cards’ content 
becomes a discussion prompt, allowing 
the conversation to veer in unanticipated 
directions. That partner can help make 
sense of unplanned interactions, relating 
them to project goals.
Card sorts allow subjects 
to organize information 
into hierarchies 
based on their own 
views, preferences, 
or experiences. This 
simpliﬁed example shows 
a sort by color and shape. 
The key is to allow users 
to organize information in 
ways that are meaningful 
to them.

TACTIC:
EYE TRACKING
What is it?
Eye tracking studies the movement, 
pattern, and duration of the human gaze. 
Even when we feel like we’re in a staring 
contest, our eyes are in a constant state 
of motion. These rapid micro-movements 
allow the brain to capture sensory data, 
seamlessly stitching innumerable images 
together to help us visualize the world 
around us. Behavioral scientists and 
psychologists divide these eye movement 
into three distinct activities: ﬁxations, 
saccades, and scanpaths. 
• Fixations occur when our eyes appear to 
pause,
• Saccades are the movement between two 
ﬁxations,
• Scanpaths are the accumulation of a series of 
ﬁxations and saccades.
Eye tracking research requires specialized 
equipment. The process is generally 
conducted in a laboratory setting, where 
a safe infrared light source is directed 
toward a subject’s pupils. The subject is 
shown images or content on a monitor 
placed in front, while a high speed camera 
captures the infrared light reﬂected from 
the subject’s eyes. This records the eye’s 
passage across the screen and tracks the 
associated eye movements.  
What can it do?
Eye tracking equipment can determine the 
location and duration of each individual 
ﬁxation, the subsequent saccades between 
them, and the length of the total scanpath. 
This allows the researcher to ascertain 
what participants are looking at, the order 
in which they view information, and how 
long their gaze lingers on speciﬁc details. 
Each participant’s test can be documented. 
The results of multiple tests are often 
compiled into a visualization called a 
heat map. Heat maps help triangulate 
multi-user data, removing the outliers and 
identifying common movements. 
How is it used?
Eye tracking is a component of usability 
studies for screen-based media, 
undertaken to evaluate page layout or 
interface design. Each participant’s eye 
movements can be followed in real time. 
This means eye tracking can can help 
researchers understand the way users 
visually process hierarchies  
of information, how long it takes them  
to perform speciﬁc tasks or ﬁnd  
distinct content. 
Eye tracking allows the research and 
design team to literally see through the 
eyes of the user. It documents how much 
time they spend reading content or how 
rapidly they jump from one area to the 
next—ultimately determining the success, 
or failure, of page structure.

SACCADE
SCANPATH
FIXATION
Fixations occur when  
the eye appears to stop 
or pause.
Saccades are the paths 
that connect two ﬁxations 
together. 
Scanpaths are the total 
collections of a series of 
ﬁxations and saccades. 

A Designer’s Research Manual
84
When is it used?
Eye tracking is often used as a part of 
the diagnostic process when usability 
issues arise. For example, if users are 
consistently having trouble performing a 
speciﬁc task, or they are overlooking key 
page elements or navigational items, eye 
tracking can tell us what they see and 
what they overlook. It can also tell us if 
ﬁxations and saccades move in a logical 
way, mirroring page structure, or if they 
are scattered, potentially indicating that 
the user may be having difﬁculty with 
the layout of information. Measuring the 
length of scanpaths can help optimize 
productivity. Shorter and more direct 
scanpaths may indicate information sets 
are easy to navigate and hierarchies easily 
understood, where long scanpaths may 
imply a less efﬁcient structure. 
Level of difﬁculty/complexity?
Because eye tracking requires specialized 
methods, equipment, and software, it often 
requires the help of an outside resource or 
third party, adding additional time and cost. 
Eye tracking provides a quantitative 
analysis of user behavior, because each 
participant’s experience is measured 
and recorded—but it may not always 
tell the whole story. One complication is 
that eye tracking only records the path 
of a participant’s direct line of sight, not 
accounting for peripheral vision. And while 
the process can show us what the user has 
been looking at, it doesn’t tell us why. 
Eye tracking should be used in conjunction 
with other forms of qualitative testing, 
such as interviews and contextual inquiry, 
to establish a broader awareness what 
users see, value, and understand.  
Scanpaths from multiple 
users can be recorded 
and then superimposed 
to create heat maps, 
documenting the 
areas of the page most 
commonly viewed.

PAPER 
PROTOTYPING
What is it?
Paper prototyping is a low tech—even 
no-tech!—process of testing digital 
and interactive experiences before 
programming or development occurs. 
Users are shown sketches and point to 
the options they’d pick, moving through 
drawn or printed sheets instead of 
ﬁnished, interactive digital presentations.  
What can it do?
Paper prototyping helps the design 
team work quickly and gather audience 
participation from real users. It can 
identify usability issues with navigation, 
architecture, or layout before costly 
investments in development.
How is it used?
Pages or screens are designed for 
every option (or button) represented 
in navigation. Users “press” interface 
elements, and are handed new pages for 
each option they select. Prototypes can 
be simple sketches or detailed design 
compositions. For the test to be valid, it 
is essential for each and every clickable 
option to have a subsequent page. 
Testing typically involves a moderator 
who helps guide the user through the 
experience, handing them sheets related to 
the design elements they’ve selected and 
occasionally asking questions or seeking 
clariﬁcation about speciﬁc choices. Other 
research team members may observe and 
take notes about the interaction between 
the user and page elements.
When is it used?
Paper prototyping can inﬂuence project 
development, testing initial assumptions 
on interface design and architecture. It 
can also be employed later in the design 
process, when high-ﬁdelity layouts are 
complete, as a ﬁnal assessment before 
development. 
Level of difﬁculty/complexity?
Paper Prototyping is a quick, approachable, 
and affordable way to validate design 
decisions while engaging actual users. 
Because paper is a static medium, things 
such as sound, motion, and video cannot 
be easily expressed. As interactive 
environments become more rich, paper 
prototypes may be limited in their ability 
to accurately represent ﬁnished projects.
This paper prototype 
was created by Hyland 
Software’s UX team 
for their enterprise 
cloud-based ﬁle sharing 
application, ShareBase. 
The interaction 
displayed is designed 
to persuade people to 
enable a ﬁngerprint 
scanner on their device 
to protect their ﬁles. 
Hyland’s UX team tested 
this paper prototype 
during user interviews 
to gauge the features’ 
appeal before investing 
in development.

 In an age where technology really 
is solving many real problems, what’s 
not to love?
Twitter helps revolutions form. Uber 
shatters the taxicab monopoly of lousy 
customer service. Facebook connects you 
with long lost family. Technology is pretty 
amazing. And when it comes to user 
experience, shouldn’t we use some of the 
principles around making our code better 
to make our user interface better? The 
answer of course is, yes. Unfortunately for 
many executives and engineers, “test it 
with users” is the end of the conversation 
about whether a user experience design is 
any good. In reality, that’s not why we do 
user testing.
Here are some common pitfalls to watch 
out for as you conduct your user testing. 
These are focused on digital products in 
tech (web, apps, etc.) but the principles 
apply across many different canvases.
A/B Testing Old + New Designs:
You might be lucky enough to have a 
design that has a big installed base. Then 
you can beta test the latest design with 
a limited set of existing users of the old 
version of the product. This is a fruitful 
approach to user testing because these 
are your likely users. But in this case, 
it’s important to remember, that you are 
asking your hardcore users to nitpick 
about changes you’ve made that they

COMMON PITFALLS OF USER 
TESTING IN A DIGITAL AGE
User testing can 
never answer 100% 
of the questions, so 
there will always 
be the need for 
leadership that has  
a cohesive vision of 
the product that’s 
being created.

will almost invariably complain about. 
Users don’t like change. They often 
equate “easy” with “what they know.” 
They may even like the fact that your 
user interface is difﬁcult because now 
that they’ve mastered it, it gives them a 
sense of superiority. It’s really important 
to take this feedback with a grain of salt. 
Understand where it ﬁts into the factors 
that deserve your attention.
Lab Bias:
Most importantly, when it comes to user 
testing your unreleased design, odds are 
that your testers are treating this for what 
it is, a test. They’re not necessarily using 
real data in their natural environments. 
When it comes to software that affects 
mission critical data, they’d be crazy to 
run your beta software in a situation that 
actually counts. What if it broke? What if it 
corrupted their ﬁle? What if, what if?
Over-Optimizing the First Experience:
Finally, when testing software with new 
users, it’s invariably their ﬁrst experience. 
First impressions count, but they take 
up a progressively smaller percentage of 
the user’s time with the software as they 
use it. Optimizing all efforts to take user 
feedback into account around a user’s 
ﬁrst hour with our software can be like a 
misapplication of resources.
User testing has a role, and an important 
one. But user testing is not a crutch that 
obviates the need for designers to have a 
clear point of view.
The process of creating great design is 
an iterative one where, with each loop, 
the team uses user testing, both passive 
and active, to reﬁne their own vision of 
the design. User testing can never answer 
100 percent of the questions. There will 
always be the need for leadership that 
has a cohesive vision of the product that’s 
being created. When that leadership uses 
user tests in just the right quantity to 
inform their own opinions and guide them, 
the design improves, and teams reach 
their destination of delighting customers. 
When that leadership thinks that user 
testing is the ﬁnal word on user experience 
design, in my experience, the ship ends up 
rudderless and meandering.

TACTIC:
PERSONAS
What are they?
Personas are fabricated archetypes, or 
models, of end users. Personas identify 
user motivations, expectations, and 
goals. Think of a persona as a singular 
icon representative of an entire group. 
Conjecture regarding the persona’s 
reaction in a variety of situations can help 
designers identify common needs. 
In communication design, personas are 
most commonly associated with interactive 
work. The American ﬁrm Cooper (formerly 
Cooper Interaction Design) and its 
principal, Alan Cooper, have been pioneers 
in the use of this technique. In his book 
The Inmates Are Running the Asylum, 
Cooper explains why personas are often 
preferable to actual test subjects: “The 
most obvious approach—to ﬁnd the actual 
user and ask him—doesn’t work for a 
number of reasons, but the main one is 
that merely being the victim of a particular 
problem doesn’t automatically bestow on 
one the power to see its solution.”1 
Although personas are ﬁctitious, they 
represent the needs of real users and are 
developed through traditional research 
processes. This formative research is 
critical to being able to validate the 
characteristics of the prototype and ensure 
that they are not instead based on the 
designer’s opinion.
1. Cooper, Alan, The Inmates Are Running the Asylum: Why 
High Tech Products Drive Us Crazy and How to Restore the Sanity 
(Indianapolis: Sams Publishing, 1999). 
What can they do? 
Personas help guide the design process 
by shifting the focus directly to the user. 
Findings will help organize information, 
structure navigation, or even inﬂuence 
formal presentation and color choice. 
Because design efforts are based on 
these carefully researched and developed 
personas, the users’ goals and needs 
are sure to be addressed. As agreed-
upon identity benchmarks, personas can 
also help the creative team substantiate 
their decisions when presenting design 
rationale to clients. 
How are they used? 
Personas are created using several sources 
of information, including ethnographic 
research, focus groups, and demographic 
data. A brief description (maybe one 
to two pages long) is then created to 
ﬂesh out individual attitudes, behaviors, 
environmental conditions, goals, personal 
details, and skill sets. It is important for 
the researcher to try to identify several 
different user types so that the goals of 
all users will be met. Keeping persona 
sets small ensures that the design process 
remains manageable, with one primary 
persona as a focal point.
Personas should be used as a component to 
a larger research strategy, not as a singular 
research method. Combining personas with 
other tools, such as user testing and market 
analysis, can give the designer valuable 
insight into the user’s needs.

Chapter 2: Research Strategies +Tactics
91
When are they used?
Personas can be used throughout the 
design process. In the planning or 
formative phases, they can be used to align 
project goals with audience needs. During 
the creative development phase, personas 
can be used as a standard to measure 
structural or aesthetic decisions.
Level of difﬁculty/complexity?
There is a lot of information available 
about the creation of personas, speciﬁcally 
regarding their use when designing 
interactive projects. However, creating 
functional ﬁctitious identities takes time, 
so production schedules should be written 
accordingly. 
By creating detailed 
ﬁctitious personas, 
designers can develop 
systems that meet the 
needs and goals of 
primary and secondary 
users. Personas help 
make research results 
more relatable because 
they use a singular 
icon to represent a 
group of individuals.

 The process of visual exploration 
forces creatives to move beyond initial 
concepts, often resulting in unique and 
innovative solutions. 
Through the graphic testing of type and 
image in varying structural forms, the 
designer can prototype rapidly in either 
low- or high-tech fashion (traditional 
paper and pencil sketches or computer 
roughs). This rapid investigation allows 
the designer to develop grids and 
typographic systems that are appropriate 
for delivering concepts and content to 
the end user. This generation of multiple 
visual solutions allows for comparative 
analysis of a broad sample of possibilities, 
which enables the designer to see the most 
successful vehicle for communication.  
A spirit of experimentation, openness to  
new ideas, and rapid prototyping 
without fear of failure are key to this 
developmental process. 
Visual exploration occurs after formative 
research has been completed. Using the 
information collected, the designer now 
focuses on creating visual prototypes 
engineered to meet the needs outlined 
during the research phase. Traditional 
sketching with pencil and paper remains 
the dominant form of rapid investigation, 
though designers develop their own 
methodology over time. Deadlines and 
budgets necessitate that these systematic 
visual development processes are 
executed ﬂuidly.

TACTIC:
COLOR  
PSYCHOLOGY
What is it? 
Color psychology studies the effects that 
colors have on human behavior. 
What can it do? 
Color is a powerful nonverbal 
communication tool and can play 
an important role in the success of 
commercial projects. Color can evoke 
emotions, elicit feelings—even cause 
hunger (reds and oranges have been 
linked to inspiring hunger and even 
speeding up food consumption)! Color 
perceptions are frequently based 
on shared experience and cultural 
association. For example warm colors 
such as yellow and orange are colors 
linked with heat, ﬁre, passion, love, and 
excitement. Cool colors such as blue, 
green, and violet are connected with 
the sea, sky, calmness, tranquility, and 
unity. Designers should be sensitive to 
the cultural perceptions of their target 
audience; for example, in many Western 
countries black is evocative of death, 
whereas in many non-Western countries 
death is represented by white. When 
branding a product for a global market, 
color selections require especially close 
consideration. 
How is it used?
By studying cultural associations and 
trends designers can use color to help 
support their concepts. Pantone, Inc., 
provides free documentation on color 
forecasting every year and offers for-hire 
color specialization services for designers. 
Beyond supplying ink to printers, 
Pantone can help your team with color 
ideation and validation by doing research 
into target market, brand positioning, 
substrate suitability (web, paper, or 
textile), color meanings and association, 
trends, and psychology. Pantone can also 
provide guidance on achieving consistent 
reproduction across varying media.
When is it used?
Decisions on the use of color are tested 
during visual explorations of form. Designers 
can choose the most appropriate color 
palette for a project based on preliminary 
research ﬁndings that illuminate the target 
market and color trends. 
Level of difﬁculty/complexity?
Choosing the right color palette is 
essential to any design undertaking. In 
addition to Pantone, there are several 
organizations, including the Color 
Association of the United States and the 
International Color Marketing Group, 
that can be helpful when forecasting and 
selecting appropriate color. In addition, 
there are numerous books available on 
color theory, psychology, and palettes.

MOOD BOARDS
What are they?
Mood boards are rapid visualization tools 
that aggregate imagery from numerous 
sources, helping the design team establish 
and convey an aesthetic tone. 
What can they do?
Mood boards help communicate and 
clarify ideas, establishing a graphic 
approach. Assembling visual inﬂuences 
can combat the creative roadblock familiar 
at the start of new design endeavors. 
Mood boards can provide a tangible 
representation of design direction to non-
designers, visually supporting concepts. 
They may also serve as a litmus test for a 
client’s response to visualization, helping 
creative teams understand what’s needed 
to achieve subsequent rounds of approval. 
How are they used?
Mood boards get the ball rolling for the 
creative team. They assemble a tone that 
inﬂuences decisions about type, color, 
imagery, even editorial or narrative voice. 
They can provide historical reference for 
aesthetic choices and diagram current 
trends. Mood boards can be used to build 
consensus, internally or externally, around 
the visual direction of a project. They help 
overcome misunderstandings in the verbal 
descriptions of visual ideas.
When are they used?
Mood boards are formative. Like sketching 
or other forms of visualization, mood 
boards are most effective when crafted 
after initial audience/user research has 
been completed. Because mood boards 
convey concepts quickly, they can help 
the creative team bridge research and 
design, assembling imagery around ideas 
generated in the research phase. 
Level of difﬁculty/complexity?
Assembling mood boards is fast, easy, 
inexpensive, and collaborative. Whether 
physically collaged or digitally collected, 
mood boards are an efﬁcient and effective 
visual brainstorming method that can 
kick-start the creative process.

TACTIC:
SKETCHING
What is it? 
Sketching, or visualization, is a rapid 
prototyping tool that designers use 
to make concepts easily understood. 
Visualization techniques help designers 
examine form, concepts, or even usability. 
Whether executed on paper or rendered 
in a three-dimensional modeling program, 
visualization helps turn abstract ideas into 
concrete tangible objects. 
What can it do? 
Sketching can help the designer/researcher 
avoid potential misconceptions with 
both clients and members of the design 
team. For example, presenting competing 
products, or storyboards, showing the 
client’s product in context, provides others 
with a greater understanding of what a 
designer is trying to ultimately achieve. 
Using visualization as a part of an iterative 
design process allows for earlier testing and 
reduces the risk of going to market with 
a product that doesn’t resonate with the 
public or meet the needs of the end user. 
How is it used?
Designers can use a broad range of 
tools for sketching, including computer 
renderings, models, comps, wireframes, 
storyboards and mood boards to visually 
articulate their concepts. Computer 
renderings and prototypes help 
communicate three-dimensional objects 
and environments. Storyboards or visual 
narratives can show how the product can 
be used in context. Designers can also use 
visual thinking or graphic organizers such 
as mind maps, to communicate concepts.  
When is it used?
Sketching is formative research. In the 
early phases of the design process, rough 
visualization techniques such as sketching 
wireframes or paper prototypes are quick, 
cheap, and easy to execute and update 
based on client feedback. During later 
stages of the design process, reﬁning these 
prototypes ensures that research ﬁndings 
are reﬂected in the end product. 
Level of difﬁculty/complexity?
Designers are by nature visual learners, 
and this research tactic is a component  
of almost all design educations, making  
it the most commonly used form of  
design research.
Wire frames, like these 
by Andrew Twigg a UX 
Designer and Professor 
at the School of Design 
at Carnegie Mellon 
University, allow 
designers to quickly 
ideate and conduct 
comparative analysis 
between potential 
solutions. Wireframes 
can increase in ﬁdelity 
from simple sketches 
to digital prototypes, 
accounting for 
complexity of features 
and interactions.

QUICK
TIPS
Get organized. 
It may sound elementary, but in fact 
it’s essential to clearly record, source, 
and organize your research. To get the 
most out of the investigative process 
take copious notes, organize the results 
into categories, and keep them in a job 
ticket of some kind (one that’s shared 
if you’re working as a team). Establish 
your ﬁling system before you begin 
your investigations. Keep it simple 
to encourage consistent use. Proper 
documentation makes processing your 
ﬁndings more efﬁcient and easier to share 
with your client or other members of the 
creative team. 
There’s always more than 
one side of the story. 
Design research focuses on people, 
arguably making everything you do an 
ethnographic exercise with few absolutes. 
As such, never depend on a single data 
point. You won’t have a clear picture. 
Triangulate your research, comparing 
commonalities, looking for outliers. Where 
you see convergence you’re closest to the 
truth. Just as you shouldn’t get all of your 
news from a single source, your research 
efforts are most legitimate when diversiﬁed. 
Always use the  
buddy system. 
Choose research methods that support each 
other. Pick a combination of exercises that 
serve different purposes, each designed 
to gather what another might miss. For 
example, surveys or demographic data 
rarely reveal user motivations; pair them 
with contextual inquiry or ethnographic 
investigations to build a deeper 
understanding of the subject.  
Not sure where to begin? 
Self ethnography is an approachable 
starting point for the researcher in-
training. Want to know what it’s 
like for your audience to navigate a 
museum, order a new product, or tour 
a college campus? Get out there, have 
the experience yourself, and begin 
documenting. The next chapter is ﬁlled 
with frameworks to help you become a 
good observer.

Chapter 3: Practicing a Research-Driven Approach
 All graphic designers and their 
respective studios move through 
an often complex process to create 
design collateral. 
Whether the project is print, interactive, or 
three-dimensional in nature, designers use 
an established set of procedures to create 
innovative solutions to communication 
problems. Many studios offer their method 
as a proprietary service, noting the 
value that process adds in the otherwise 
intangible medium of creativity. 
The graphic design process, as traditionally 
deﬁned, is modeled around the physical 
creation of a single artifact: an annual 
report, a website, a poster, an app, and 
so on. As such, the process is inevitably 
project-oriented as well as linear—it 
starts with research and progresses 
through concept development, prototype, 
production, and delivery. Historically, the 
research phase begins with a review of 
a client’s internal documents, interviews 
with key personnel or customers, and/
or competitor analysis. These actions 
help a designer better understand an 
organization’s goals and determine 
strategy and direction. While these forms 
of preliminary research are invaluable to 
a project’s success, they are but an early 
step in its creation. 
MANAGING THE  
DESIGN PROCESS:
YOU NEED A PLAN
Research, as deﬁned in this book, does 
not merely initiate the process, but rather 
augments it by integrating systematic 
investigation into each phase of a project’s 
development. The research-driven design 
process also depends on assessment, 
or summative evaluation, which is 
undertaken throughout the course of (or 
even at the end of ) a project. This allows 
the designer to reconsider assumptions 
gleaned from preliminary research. Using 
this data, the designer may opt to make 
adjustments to a design either before or, in 
certain situations, after production. This 
process of reevaluation creates a culture 
of consultation. As a result, research-
driven designers can engage in long-term 
relationships with their clients, acting as 
strategic business partners rather than 
service providers assigned to singular 
commissions.
Graphic design researchers gather 
information, and use those ﬁndings to solve 
speciﬁc visual communication problems. 
Because each project or commission has 
a unique set of goals, requirements, and 
budget and time constraints, it is imperative 
to outline a plan before beginning the 
design process. Developing a plan creates 
a clear framework in which the designer 
can conduct and vet the investigation. 
Whether the tactics employed focus on 
market trends, consumer preferences, or 
brand perceptions, a comprehensive plan 
for gathering data will help clarify both the 
problem to be solved and the resources 
necessary to accomplish project goals. 

104
A Designer’s Research Manual
Many large design studios or advertising 
agencies are already billing their clients 
for research services, and have proprietary 
processes—the details of which they guard 
closely from the competition. Numerous 
small ﬁrms, sole proprietors, in-house 
teams, and freelancers have also outlined 
research patterns, customized to their 
resources. Creative processes, whether 
proprietary or public domain, allow the 
designer to pair the most appropriate 
research tools with project requirements—
without reinventing the wheel for each 
assignment! 
Furthermore, research indicates that 
studios that have an internally documented 
design process in place experience 
more successful project outcomes, with 
increased time-to-market and higher client 
and end-user satisfaction. Documenting 
and adhering to a standardized process—
regardless of what that process may 
be—serves as a management tool, helping 
the creative team to work collaboratively, 
clearly delineate team roles, and manage 
client expectations.1
Individuals new to the concept of  
design research may ﬁnd the established 
processes described on the following 
pages to be an invaluable foundation on 
which to base their own investigations. 
Adapt as needed.

LINEAR PROCESS
Design is often viewed as 
a linear process. It begins 
with formative research—
deﬁne the problem—then 
progresses through 
concept development, 
prototype, production, 
and delivery. Process, 
as depicted above, 
focuses on the creation 
of a singular artifact or 
campaign.
Applying research in 
multiple phases, an 
iterative process allows 
the designer to redeﬁne 
early assumptions. 
While this model may 
involve more revision 
during development, 
better-informed design 
decisions often lead 
to more successful 
outcomes.

105
Chapter 3: Practicing a Research-Driven Approach
ITERATIVE
DESIGN
 Iterative design is a cycle of 
prototyping, testing, analysis, and 
reﬁnement. In this process the 
creative project is evaluated with 
user-based research methods, 
comparing successive versions, or 
iterations against project goals. 
Interaction with the target audience 
can reveal complications, generate 
new questions, and sometimes uncover 
solutions. Any design commission can 
beneﬁt from this process of collecting and 
integrating audience feedback. But, it is an 
especially beneﬁcial practice for interactive 
and experience-based projects with 
multiple, interconnected components. 
The complexity of an iterative process 
depends on which research tactics are 
chosen and how many iterations are 
intended. If working on the redesign 
of an existing system, or updating the 
functionality of existing tools, time should 
be allotted for benchmark testing of the 
original—before new iterative cycles begin. 
Understanding how well the original 
design functions in tests with audience 
members can provide the design team 
a baseline metric to work with when 
validating new designs. 
Be aware that even when using accessible 
techniques, multiple iterations will 
increase production timelines and, 
consequently, budgets. Be certain to clearly 
deﬁne project testing goals, with client 
approval, at the start of a project. This 
helps avoid perpetual testing cycles which 
can result in ballooning project scope, 
delayed production, increased costs, 
and general frustration. Because most of 
design research is qualitative in nature, 
prototypes rarely make everyone happy. 
Stay focused on how test results relate to 
project goals. Testing is about informing, 
not paralyzing the process or predicting 
design outcomes.

Chapter 3: Practicing a Research-Driven Approach
 Seeking to better understand 
design’s application in a corporate 
setting, Design Council, an industry 
advocate in the UK, studied the 
processes of eleven top design-
led companies.2 Those selected 
represented multiple business 
sectors, showing consistent and 
successful use of design related to 
business outcomes. 
The research team wanted to ﬁnd out 
how design was integrated organization-
wide (beyond creative departments).They 
examined the development and execution 
of ideas, products, and services, distilling 
best practices in problem solving and 
design management that could be shared 
with the broader profession. 
While each company varied in size, 
market, and product offering, Design 
Council was able to identify similarities in 
approach. They used this information to 
craft a model, The Double Diamond Design 
Process, outlining four stages that all 
designers must navigate when undertaking 
a commission: Discover, Deﬁne, Develop 
and Deliver. Research is integrated 
throughout, helping to deﬁne the problem 
and delineate the best possible design 
solutions, with iterative loops often 
occurring within or between each phase. 
The model is summarized here:
Discover: This initial step focuses on posing a 
question, analyzing a problem, or identifying 
a potential opportunity. In the Discover stage 
it’s essential to remain open-minded to diverse 
concepts, ideas, and inﬂuences. 
Deﬁne: This phase aligns ideas generated in the 
Discover stage with overall business objectives, 
potential return on investment, and feasibility. 
It concludes with a clearly articulated project 
brief, outlining goals, deliverables, scope, 
schedule, and budget. This ensures that client 
and designer have a mutual understanding 
of project purpose, and that members of the 
creative team understand individual roles and 
responsibilities.
Develop: Design concepts transition into 
working prototypes, tested with users, ensuring 
they meet the objectives outlined in the previous 
Deﬁne stage. 
Deliver: Final products, messaging, or designs 
are delivered to the audience. Summative 
evaluation may occur in this phase, conﬁrming 
alignment with project goals or identifying areas 
for further development. 
These project development steps can be 
applied by creative professionals working 
in any ﬁeld. Use of the model doesn’t 
guarantee project success, but it certainly 
helps manage the creative process. Amidst 
chaotic rounds of ideation and innovation, 
Double Diamond helps the designer stay 
on track. The model is most functional 
when there is active collaboration between 
creatives, clients and project partners, 
demystifying creative and showcasing the 
value it generates.

INFORMATION LITERACY
THE BIG6 + 
THE SUPER3
 Information Literacy, a lifelong 
learning strategy, focuses on 
empowering individuals by instilling 
the ability to recognize when 
information is needed, and to have 
the skills to ﬁnd, evaluate, analyze, 
and effectively use that information. 
Designers will ﬁnd that information 
literacy strategies coincide with their 
ability to ﬁnd, harvest, and analyze 
complex content, creating a familiar 
environment for the practiced information 
architect. While there are numerous 
documented models for framing research 
problems, one that coalesces particularly 
well with the problem-solving skill sets 
of visual communication design is The 
Big6. The Big6 is an information literacy 
model, or information problem-solving 
strategy, developed by Dr. Mike Eisenberg 
and Bob Berkowitz (Dean of the University 
of Washington Information School, and 
School Library Media Specialist with the 
Wayne Central School District in Ontario 
Center, New York, respectively). This 
model, which provides the user with a 
formula for problem solving, has been 
widely used, from educational settings 
to corporate professional development 
programs to adult retraining. Because 
of its inherent ﬂexibility, the Big6 can 
be used as a model for approaching 
any information-based problem, design 
projects included. Many designers will, 
in fact, ﬁnd that they are already going 
through a number of the documented 
Big6 steps when working on creative 
communication projects. Eisenberg 
and Berkowitz say of the Big6: “It’s not 
necessary to complete these stages in a 
linear order, and a given stage doesn’t have 
to take a lot of time.” This is especially 
welcome news to creatives with tight 
production schedules and modest budgets. 
The Big6 process uses these six steps to 
clarify an information-based problem. Try 
applying them to your next project.

It is also considered 
a metacognative 
model, which means 
it helps users assess 
their learning process.

Chapter 3: Practicing a Research-Driven Approach
 Writing a research plan at the 
beginning of a project can help 
organize your thoughts, guide 
your team, and help you bring key 
stakeholders on board. 
It outlines what you’re going to do, and 
why you’re doing it. It’s an essential 
communication tool, describing each team 
member’s roles and assignments. This 
can provide transparency for the client, 
illustrating that creativity and innovation 
aren’t magic—they’re the results of hard 
work and informed decisions.
While every project is unique and requires 
customization around scope, timeline, 
and budget, there are some basics that 
can help you draft a research plan for any 
problem you’re trying to solve. Consider 
the following sections of an adaptable 
general model:
Background: Outline project goals. Explain 
why the work was commissioned and what is 
to be achieved. Whenever possible, include 
information about audience. Background places 
the project in context. Putting it in writing also 
ensures that you and your client are on the same 
page. Perhaps some of this information has 
even been provided by them, when the project 
was initiated.
Assumptions: At the beginning of any new 
project, all members of the team have their own 
ideas regarding the assignment, the audience, 
possibly even the client. List those assumptions. 
They’re essential for helping you ask the right 
questions later. Get them all out on the table 
early. It clears your head and simultaneously 
jump-starts your research. If appropriate, you 
may even involve stakeholders or constituents. 
Research Questions: Draft questions relevant 
to project goals and what you’ve learned in 
the assumptions phase. Determine what you 
don’t know, and what you’ll need to have 
answered in order to move forward. Try to 
keep the list concise. Too many questions 
can mean that aspects of the project remain 
unclear, for you and the client. An unwieldy 
number of research questions is usually 
indicative of an unfocused project. 
Methods: Once you have placed the project 
in context, and you know what questions need 
answered, select research methods appropriate 
to time frame and resources. Select tools that 
will give you the most valuable information as 
quickly and efﬁciently as possible.

Implications: Implications connect research 
methods back to project goals. This step 
outlines how the research contributes to 
a successful solution. Implications answer 
research questions and validate—or 
invalidate—assumptions. They also show your 
client the value of research, illustrating how 
doing the homework early can save money in 
the long run by avoiding costly missteps. 
Resources: This part of the plan accounts 
for the impact of research on project time-
line, budget, and staff. Integrating research 
exercises into project production schedules 
is helpful, providing a clear and shared 
understanding of who is responsible for what, 
and when. This also provides an estimate of 
time-on-task, accounting for research activities 
and their impact on project costs. It can reveal 
if the team will need outside assistance to help 
plan accordingly.  
A research plan should be a living 
document. Treat it as a guide, not as 
dogma. Don’t be afraid to adjust the plan 
as things evolve. Just make sure that your 
team and your client are in agreement 
when things start to shift. Regular updates 
on progress—both internal (to your team) 
and external (to your stakeholders)—keep 
the project on track, and that plan you’ve 
so carefully crafted from falling unused 
into an empty drawer.
Outline project 
assumptions with this 
simple process: Ask 
participants to write 
each assumption on 
a single sticky note. 
Place them on a wall or 
community work space. 
Individuals can write 
as many assumptions 
as they’d like. When the 
writing or conversation 
starts to lag, it’s time 
to start looking for 
patterns. Group like 
concepts into clusters, 
creating categories. Once 
you’re satisﬁed with 
those categories, start 
thinking about the best 
resources to dig a little 
deeper into the related 
assumptions (books, 
articles, videos, people). 
As you come up with 
answers to, ‘How can I 
ﬁnd out more about …?,’ 
write them down and 
assign the work to team 
members. Give everyone 
time to investigate the 
assignments. Schedule a 
follow-up discussion to 
share what everyone  
has learned. 
This exercise is intended 
to help the creative team 
focus, proving initial 
assumptions valid, or 
demonstrating that they 
are false. Either way, this 
step helps to clarify what 
to do next.

 KWHL Tables are widely used 
graphic organizers that help you plan 
information seeking strategies and 
organize results. They are easy to use 
and broadly applicable, appropriate 
for both your professional queries 
and your kid’s ﬁrst big homework 
assignment. 
Use KWHL tables to organize your 
assumptions and kick-start your 
research plan. The KWHL process forces 
participants to rapidly identify what they 
do—and do not—know. This structured 
approach to early ideation sessions can 
be done individually, with a creative 
team, or even collaboratively with clients 
and stakeholders. The basic steps are 
outlined here:
K: What do I know? 
This step asks you to outline your understanding 
of facts and information related to the project/
audience/message. It also encourages you 
to list some of those assumptions you’ve just 
generated, what you think you know about 
those same subjects areas. It’s a good idea to 
visually differentiate proven fact from assumption 
for clarity. If assessing multiple categories, 
such as project/audience/message, it may 
be helpful to build individual KWHL tables for 
each, or create a more complex master chart. 
(Hooray grids and color coding!)
W: What do I need to ﬁnd out? 
Groups of people working together are 
often more successful completing this step. 
Conversation around this question tends to 
generate more insights and queries than one 
person would working alone. Here it’s your job 
to ﬁll in the gaps between what you know for 
certain, and where you’re less sure and have 
questions. What do you need to investigate and 
uncover in order to make the project a success? 
H: How will I ﬁnd the information  
I need? 
Time to connect research methods to questions, 
and hand out assignments if you’re working 
with a team. Be mindful of how much time 
you have to devote to this exercise and plan 
information seeking strategies that will deliver 
the most accurate, detailed information in the 
most efﬁcient manner. For example, it’s easy to 
turn to Internet searches, but equally easy to ﬁnd 
false information or fall down digital rabbit holes 
of distraction. Perhaps interviewing people is a 
faster path to provide some perspective? 
KWHL

Chapter 3: Practicing a Research-Driven Approach
L: What have I learned? 
After conducting preliminary research to 
investigate assumptions and questions, 
complete the chart, recording what you’ve 
learned. Add a meeting with the team, if you’re 
working collectively, and discuss the group’s 
discoveries. Don’t forget to keep your sources 
well documented for future reference. Findings 
will either conﬁrm assumptions and answer 
questions, or raise new areas of investigation. 
Use this tool at the beginning of the research 
process. It’s useful for taking inventory of 
a new commission and crafting a more 
precise research plan. While KWHL tables 
are intended as a formative tool, the content 
assembled could be used as part of later 
reporting. Work smarter, not harder. Look 
for overlaps!

Creating KWHL tables 
can help you develop 
a research plan. 
The exercise will 
identify holes in your 
understanding of the 
subject being studied, 
forcing the research 
team to develop 
strategies to ﬁnd the 
missing information. Use 
this technique to kick off 
your research and work 
through early project 
assumptions.

 Logic models can help visualize your 
research plan, connecting research 
methods to intended outcomes, time, 
and resources. 
For individual designers practicing solo 
on large-scale projects, logic models help 
break overwhelming workloads into 
achievable goals, reinforcing purpose, 
allocating time on task, and integrating 
research activities into overall project 
timelines. For teams, a logic model can be 
expanded to assign research roles to each 
member, accounting for every individual’s 
contribution, and illustrating how it relates 
to project goals. Logic models can also be 
shared with clients, making the case for 
design research by delineating why speciﬁc 
methods are used and how they will impact 
project development and success. 
Logic models commonly organize a 
project’s timeline into research and design 
activities, breaking each step down into 
Objectives, Inputs, Actions, Outputs, and 
Outcomes: 
Objectives deﬁne why you’re conducting a 
speciﬁc activity. What you are trying to learn? 
In some scenarios, the objective can be framed 
by a speciﬁc research question that you are 
trying to answer. 
Inputs take stock of resources—time, 
facilities, staff, external experts, even research 
participants. List anyone or anything you need 
to execute the activity.
Actions outline what you are going to do. Be as 
speciﬁc as possible. Logic models are planning 
documents. Thinking through the actions helps 
you take stock of what really needs to be done, 
and what resources will be expended.   
Outputs deﬁne take-aways or artifacts produced 
from the activity. What will be generated? How 
will that inform project development? Research 
outputs help you make the case for design 
decisions, reinforcing rationale. 
Outcomes record the results of an activity. This 
category can be expanded to include projected 
outcomes (drafted when planning research 
activities) and actual outcomes (ﬁlled in after 
research activities are completed). Comparing 
these two columns either conﬁrms or contradicts 
assumptions. There may be a story related to 
contradictions that warrants further investigation. 
Let’s apply a logic model to a common 
research action: For example, a literature 
review is often a ﬁrst step on a new 
project. The “objective” of this activity 
is to become familiar with the problem, 
client, and audience. The “inputs” may 
include a collection of previously published 
marketing materials, competitor websites, 
and the individuals assigned to complete 
the review. The “action” for this activity 
would be to comprehensively review the 
material, extracting information relevant 
to the project. The “output” might take the 
form of a written report  or presentation 
outlining key ﬁndings, or a mood board 
visualizing the client’s current design 
strategy in contrast to those of their 
competitors. “Outcomes” could include 
generating an agreed-upon list of project 
goals with your client, identifying areas of 
LOGIC

Chapter 3: Practicing a Research-Driven Approach
potential differentiation and advantage, 
or outlining new questions to be explored 
with further primary research. 
When drafting the model, place activities 
and categories on opposing axes, creating 
a grid. So the example left would ﬁll 
a single row. As project development 
progresses the information gathered 
should inform the next activity. While logic 
models organize activities in a linear way, 
be sure to indicate where there may be 
iterative loops. For example, user testing 
may inform project development, but 
testing may need to occur more than once 
to ensure project success. 
Adapt the category titles or structure to 
suit your needs. Experiment, and use what 
works best for you, your studio, or your 
market. Just be sure to clarify the need for 
the activity (Objective), what is to be done 
(Action + Output), and what you think will 
be accomplished (Outcome). Accounting 
for resources, time, and personnel (Input) 
takes the logic model from a research 
planning document and elevates it to a 
comprehensive production schedule and 
project management tool.
LOGIC MODEL
Logic models help 
structure research 
activities, focusing 
on Objectives, Inputs, 
Actions, Outputs, and 
Outcomes. As each 
research activity is 
performed, details 
are recorded in the 
framework. That 
information informs the 
next action.

ANALYSIS
You’ve invested signiﬁcant time and 
resources in your research efforts, gathered 
pages of notes, observations, testing responses, 
visual references—what’s next? How do you sort 
through all that information in an efﬁcient manner? 
Distill the relevant ﬁndings? Make sense of  
disparate feedback?

Chapter 3: Practicing a Research-Driven Approach
 Analysis frameworks provide 
structure for research ﬁndings 
(cataloging related people, 
places, things, and activities), 
or documentation of a user’s 
experience (illustrating timeline  
and associated activity). 
Frameworks allow team members to 
empathize with their audience. They 
provide a repository for information 
collected by multiple researchers, 
allowing the team to share and combine 
individual efforts. 
The resulting visualizations provide 
prompts for group discussion. They can 
help designers connect concepts, ﬁnd 
patterns, illustrate subject associations, 
demonstrate event sequences, compare 
and contrast, and more. 
Using frameworks for analysis should 
feel familiar, because in many ways the 
process mirrors ideation exercises. Gather 
the standard ingredients: a pile of sticky 
notes, markers, an uncluttered work 
space, ample time for discussion, open-
minded participants. Bring all the research 
ﬁndings you’ve collectively amassed. 
Kick things off by writing the selected 
framework categories on whiteboard or 
wall. Start by placing your ﬁndings—or 
any new questions that may pop up—
into the appropriate areas. One idea per 
sticky note—you know the drill. Look for 
patterns and clusters to emerge. Several 
observations in one column or too few in 
another may reveal an opportunity for 
design intervention, or identify an area 
that needs further investigation. 
This is a qualitative process, so don’t 
be afraid to try several different 
options for organization—some people 
combine multiple frameworks to distill 
their research. Different patterns (and 
opportunities) may emerge when you 
look at the data through an alternate 
lens. Apply what you have learned about 
convergence and triangulation (see pages 
40–41) to this process. If you keep coming 
back to similar conclusions, regardless of 
the framework you’re using, those ideas 
are worth exploring through design.

A Designer’s Research Manual
 Some designers use proprietary 
systems to process their research 
ﬁndings, but numerous general 
purpose frameworks for conducting 
and analyzing ethnographic 
research exist. 
Many of these are rooted in the work 
of Professor James P. Spradley, an 
anthropologist who taught at Macalester 
College in Saint Paul, Minnesota. 
Spradley developed a tool for structuring 
ethnographic observations that he called 
the Descriptive Observation Matrix.3 
Spradley’s matrix structures observations 
into the following nine categories, 
summarized here with instructions on use: 
1. Space: Describe the physical environment  
in detail. 
2. Object: Take stock of relevant objects in the 
environment.
3. Act: Catalog the behaviors of the individuals 
under observation. 
4. Activity: Detail the actions performed by 
participants, including interactions with other 
individuals, objects, and the environment. 
5. Event: Connect activities to happenings,  
or events.   
6. Time: Chronicle the time and date of the 
observation, and the amount of time spent 
engaged in activities. 
7. Actor: Describe the people under observation.
8. Goals: Note what the people under 
observation are trying to achieve in their 
activities. 
9. Feelings: Recount any discernible emotions 
expressed by the individuals under 
observation. 
Spradley suggested that placement of 
the categories be repeated on both the 
X and Y axes of the matrix, forcing 
the researcher(s) to explore how each 
classiﬁcation inﬂuenced the other. For 
example, “What is the impact of physical 
space on participant goals?” or “How are 
activities related to feelings?”  
Use Spradley’s categories as a reference 
point for your own framework. Adjust 
category quantity and titles to align with 
the goals of your investigation or project. 
The take-away is to be cognizant of people, 
the places they go, the things they use or 
encounter, and actions they undertake. 
Research activities and observations 
need to be summarized before they’ll ﬁt 
neatly into your system. Rarely does one 
framework perfectly serve every research 
query. Experiment until you ﬁnd a structure 
that works best for you and your practice.

activities or from several 
researchers), look for 
gaps in the matrix. They 
may indicate an area 
where more research is 
needed, or may reveal an 
opportunity for design 
to fulﬁll an unaddressed 
need.

 Experiences follow universal 
patterns, they have a beginning, a 
middle, and an end, like a narrative 
arc. They can be described in 
simple terms such as “before,” 
“during,” and “after.” Using these 
temporal prompts, you can organize 
observations and research ﬁndings 
around a person’s experience. 
Recreating their path helps you 
understand their actions, avoidances, 
frustrations, and choices. The visualization 
of that path is commonly referred to as an 
experience model (also experience map, 
customer journey, user journey, patient 
journey, etc.). 
Experience models can be used to 
document existing activities, or to 
prototype new ones. Using these models, 
you can map the impact of a change on 
an established system by projecting how 
shifts in one area affect subsequent actions 
down the timeline. Experience models can 
describe simple interactions (How does the 
shopping cart work on a particular mobile 
application?) or complex events (What 
exactly happens when a patient visits an 
emergency room?). At any scale, the key 
is to document all possible choices and 
outcomes as the experience progresses 
through completion.  
To create a research analysis framework 
that will help you empathize with your 
user, start by outlining simple time-
related categories such as “beginning,” 
“middle,” and “end” or “before,” “during,” 
and “after.” More complex experiences 
may require further customization; 
however, the general tenets remain 
the same: You are trying to map the 
experience from the active person’s 
perspective as they move through a 
sequence of events. If creative teams 
identify in advance that experience 
mapping will be a part of their research 
plan, they can use pre-established 
categories to organize ﬁeld notes and 
observations. This keeps the researchers 
organized, thinking of the participant  
at each interaction, and streamlines 
future analysis. 
SAMPLE

HELP EMPATHIZE
Event maps can be 
used by designers to 
determine the sequence 
of user behavior in an 
interactive environment, 
or even predict 
navigation of a three-

RESEARCH SUMMARY 
REPORTS AND 
CREATIVE BRIEFS
Research summary reports and creative 
briefs bridge the gap between research 
and design. These documents are essential to 
helping an internal team process. They can be 
shared to help stakeholders understand research 
ﬁndings and creative direction. The research 
summary report comes ﬁrst, communicating what 
you’ve discovered during the formative research 
phase, essentially reporting the results of your 
research plan. The creative brief follows, outlining 
what you’re going to do about it. Creative briefs 
guide the actual designing.

SUMMARY  
REPORTS
 The research summary report 
presents investigative ﬁndings and 
analysis before making the pitch 
on how to solve the problem (that’s 
the creative brief). The arguments 
crafted here, steeped in data and 
observations, are valuable resources 
should any of your future creative 
concepts come under scrutiny. 
Research summary reports (or 
presentations!) should be crafted as a 
narrative, making the information easy to 
digest for the layperson. Tell stories from 
your ﬁeldwork. Integrate experiences 
and dialog from participants whenever 
possible. Connect the formative research 
back to project goals and the experiences 
of real users. This places your ﬁndings in 
context, and can help you achieve buy-in 
from project stakeholders.  
When drafting your research summary 
report use your original research plan 
as an outline. The report or presentation 
you’re now crafting will walk project 
partners through your research process, 
so they can understand how you arrived at 
conclusions. Start with project objectives, 
progress through assumptions, research 
questions, and methods. Discuss the 
process of analyzing raw research: How 
did you arrive at the ﬁndings you’re 
presenting? This is your chance to tell a 
story about what you’ve learned (and how 
you learned it). 
Research summary 
reports or presentations

whatever will resonate 
with your team.
RESEARCH SUMMARY REPORT

128
A Designer’s Research Manual
Focus on Audience
Who are you talking to, or interacting with, 
when the project is complete? Who will use 
your design deliverables? Now that you've 
invested research time understanding your 
audience, draft a clear description to share 
with the rest of the creative team and project 
stakeholders. Too often audiences are framed 
by demographics (ex: males, age 18–24). 
You’ve done your homework and know it’s way 
more than age and gender, it’s about culture, 
attitudes, behaviors, and beliefs. Present the 
audience as real people and you will know 
how to design for them.
Deﬁne the Message
What do you need to say? What tone, 
language, aesthetic, medium will resonate 
with the audience? Sometimes, in complex 
communication programs, there may be more 
than one message. If necessary, create clearly 
delineated hierarchies of communication for 
primary, secondary, and tertiary audiences 
and/or phases. 
 The creative brief takes the research 
summary report—everything learned 
about audience and context during 
the research phase—and makes it 
actionable for the design team by 
connecting it to design deliverables. 
It can be used to get a client’s sign-off on 
strategy and conceptual direction before 
design begins. There are numerous takes 
on creative brief structure and content. 
The following will get you started:   
Delineate Succinct Project Goals 
What do we need to accomplish? These 
goals may mirror those established at project 
initiation/research planning, or they may have 
evolved or been winnowed during research. 
Project goals must be readily understood by 
all involved. Use clear and concise language 
to explain what the subsequent design 
pieces, activities, or creative campaigns must 
accomplish. Use the old “elevator pitch” as a 
standard: State your goal in as few sentences 
as possible, about 30 seconds spoken out 
loud. If you need more time than that, it’s an 
indicator that your project remains unclear or 
unwieldy in scope.

Establish a Call to Action
What do you want the audience to do? What’s 
the ideal reaction to the product you place 
in their hands, the message you send across 
their screen? Deﬁne what you want from the 
audience, then measure new concepts and 
ideas against that goal. Consider who beneﬁts 
from the action you’re suggesting. What's in it 
for the audience? Make that answer abundantly 
clear to encourage participation or purchase. 
Outline Project Deliverables
Literally, what are you going to make? What 
channels of communication are appropriate 
(social media, online video, interactive, print, 
advertising, etc.)? What are the campaign’s 
overall timeline and associated time-on-task, 
budget, and creative team responsibilities for 
each component?
If your inner artist is raging at the 
thought of all this reporting, embrace the 
frustration you feel when asked to read 
a long-winded paper or watch someone 
read slides during a presentation. Now 
don’t do that to yourself, your colleagues, 
or your clients. From research planning 
through creative briefs and even external 
case studies, know your audience! You 
aren’t being paid by the word, you’re 
being paid to communicate. Multistage 
reporting keeps lines of communication 
open between stakeholders and ensures 
that research and creative activities 
remain connected. Deliver the information 
that’s required in a way that engages the 
people you’re sharing it with—if you’re 
used to doing that for a target audience, 
you can surely apply those principles 
to documentation and summarization. 
Budget your time. Each subsequent 
report should build on the previous, 
diverging where necessary, according to 
new ﬁndings or strategy shifts, but not 
reinventing the wheel. These processes 
are intended to elevate your practice. They 
should be illuminating and adaptive. If it 
turns into bureaucratic reporting, you’re 
missing the point—and the advantage 
these exercises provide when done right.

Chapter 3: Practicing a Research-Driven Approach
 Research may feel foreign to our 
prior experiences and education as 
designers. However, our practices 
and methods offer tangible value to 
uncovering user insights.
Sadly, the discovery phases of the 
process are often depicted with a 
pronounced delineation between research 
investigation and design exploration. 
This separation inadvertently silos the 
activities and dedicated talent for each 
phase. Design, however, plays a vital role 
in the research process. Just as the design 
process continues to embrace research, 
design practices are indispensable to the 
research phase.
A note: This is not intended to advocate 
for early problem-solving before the 
problem is understood. No doubt that 
compressed time schedules often 
challenge teams to do this. 
Below are some suggested methods and 
roles to bring design into the research fold:
 
Observe with the Designer Eye
When multi-disciplined teams include 
members with prior research experience, 
volunteer to observe the research 
interviews. Your attendance will help 
minimize the challenge of translating the 
ﬁndings to the design team. Moreover, 
you may identify aspects that may be 
missed by team members from different 
backgrounds. Designers contribute an 
observant eye to the user’s physical 
interactions and workarounds as well

as an analytical perspective regarding 
how the current design is challenging 
or limiting users. Joining a team of 
experienced research colleagues will also 
help you develop your own observational 
interview skills. 
If you are new to research, you may 
want to volunteer to assist the lead 
interviewer with documentation by 
capturing photographs and video. This is 
an opportunity to practice observing and 
will familiarize you with the inventory 
of rich storytelling material that can be 
leveraged later in the project. As designers 
become acclimated to research, they are 
encouraged to ask follow-up questions that 
are not leading (“How about …”) and that 
are not hypothetical scenarios (“Would 
you use …”). The interview participants 
lack skills to determine how to solve the 
problem. With time and practice, you will 
be able to lead interviews. In the interim, 
practice observing the interviews with 
your own eye, attuned to the unstated 
user needs, interactions, and experience 
design. Be prepared to contribute to 
team discussions. Consider the following 
questions: What were the stated and 
unstated user needs? How were these met 
(or not)? What should a designer keep in 
mind in designing a future experience for 
this participant?  
Visualize the Problem through  
Information Diagrams
As designers, our visualization skills are 
beneﬁcial in helping teams see problems 
in new ways and identify patterns that 
appear across the research. Information 
diagrams and visual models can provide 
a narrative about ﬁndings, communicate 
problems as they were experienced, and 
identify new opportunities. Use them to 
bridge the problem-understanding aspects 
of research and the problem-solving 
aspects of design.  
Creating information diagrams can start 
early in the team’s analysis process. It 
begins with listening to the discussions 
and sketching visual diagrams to capture 
the team’s emerging thoughts. These 
can start in your own notebook during 
debrieﬁng and later be shared more 
broadly with your team. As you become 
more conﬁdent in these settings, this 
may evolve into early, rough sketches 
on a whiteboard as you and the team 
discuss the research ﬁndings, followed 
by collaborative sketches. Later in 
the process, the diagrams become 
higher-ﬁdelity and often take the form 
of a journey map or ecosystem map. 
Experience or journey maps are a good 
place to start, capturing what the team 
saw as the participant’s behaviors, needs, 
and emotions set along a process. 
Engage in Critique and Dialogue
Dialogue and critique are invaluable while 
the research team is analyzing the data 
and interpreting the ﬁndings. As designers, 
we inherently understand the iterative 
nature of identifying a solution. Crafting 
meaningful research insights, likewise, can 
mirror the critique culture that is integral to 
our own design education.  

133
Chapter 3: Practicing a Research-Driven Approach
Encourage your collaborators to post 
their thoughts on walls to help prompt 
discussion. It may start with early 
emerging insights or “wireframing” the 
research/user story. 
The practice of crafting insights is 
characterized by skills that are similar to 
our own design process. It involves: 
• Iteration
• Dedicated time
• Internal reﬂection
• Collaboration with others
• Consideration of audience
Foster Empathy through a  
Compelling Story
One of the most valued aspects of 
ethnographic research is the empathy it 
sparks for your clients and teams. This 
type of research is rich with human 
stories, emotion, and narratives that 
nurture emotional connections. However, it 
can be challenging to distill these ﬁndings 
into a set of ﬁnal deliverables (typically 
ﬂat documents and presentations). 
For designers, this challenge can be 
ﬂipped to a creative moment that breaks 
conventions. Leverage your design skills 
to frame the research ﬁndings as an 
evocative story, one that is memorable, 
digestible, surprising, and emotional. 
Preparing to craft a captivating story can 
happen prior to completing the research. 
Consider the end experience at the start of 
the project. Doing so will ensure that the 
right plans for the desired documentation 
are in place from the onset. Designing 
with high-quality photographs and video 
is much easier than working with myriad 
back-lit, blurry, or inconsistent images. 
Early communication of a creative vision 
will also ensure that the team is able to 
deliver on the ﬁnal outcomes.  
Integrating these familiar design 
practices into the research phase will 
help create invaluable insights, build 
a true multi-disciplinary team, and 
minimize time invested in knowledge 
transfer when it comes time for the 
design phase.

 Once a project has been completed 
and delivered to the client, research 
is almost over. Documenting the 
functionality and success of a ﬁnished 
project is an important phase in the 
research cycle and should not be 
overlooked. 
When making a case for the value of 
design, the information gathered toward 
the end of completion is often the most 
compelling. Additionally, designers and 
their respective studios can learn important 
lessons by reﬂecting on the achievements 
and failures encountered during a project’s 
development. Clients may be asked to 
contribute a letter or ﬁll out a questionnaire 
describing their experience and level of 
satisfaction with the ﬁnished project. This 
appraisal should be documented in an 
internal case study and used to streamline 
future assignments. 
Build a Personal Research Morgue
Don’t pack those internal case studies 
away in moth balls. Build your own 
library. By documenting and archiving 
research and processes, and creating 
case studies of past projects, designers 
can start to build their own research 
library. Secondary research done for 
new projects does not always have to 
come exclusively from outside sources. 
Research undertaken for one project may 
also be valuable for later commissions. 
By archiving research and creative 
processes, documenting learning 
outcomes, showcasing end products, 
and understanding how they work, the 
designer can build a proprietary body 
of knowledge that will be invaluable for 
soliciting and retaining future work.
Contribute to a Body of Knowledge
Build your profession. Publishing 
successful research-driven projects—either 
individually or through organizations such 
as AIGA, Design Management Institute, 
the Design Council, or ICOGRADA—
contributes to the collective body of 
knowledge in the ﬁeld and promotes the 
undeniable value of design.

QUICK
TIPS
Process vanquishes 
creative block. 
Invest time outlining research plans 
and creative processes at the start of a 
project, and efﬁciency will be ampliﬁed 
during development. When you hit a 
creative road block (and everyone does 
occasionally), a dedicated process model 
provides a task list that will keep you and 
the project moving forward. 
Logic models facilitate 
team building. 
Remember hating group projects in 
school, when inevitably only a few people 
carried the load? Logic models force 
accountability by outlining each task 
and the party responsible for completing 
it. This system clearly delineates who’s 
doing what, and how that connects to 
other people’s assignments. It’s harder to 
drop the baton when you know you have 
to hand it off to a team mate. 
Work smarter, not harder. 
As you’re developing a research plan 
consider what you’ll use to analyze results, 
it may frame how you record or document 
primary activities. Research reporting can 
take the form of presentations or papers; 
choose a manner of delivery that will 
resonate with your team. Keep in mind that 
during research planning, collection, and 
reporting, each step builds on the next and 
all share a common goal: You’re building 
a comprehensive argument for what you’ll 
produce in creative. This chapter is ﬁlled 
with a variety of methods, frameworks, 
and processes that can be used to your 
advantage—but you don’t need all of them 
on every project! Use a combination scaled 
to time, resources, and project goals.  
Borrow, build, share. 
Professional organizations and universities 
have the time and resources to investigate 
things that small businesses don’t (we’ve 
shared more than a few of them in this 
book). Borrow their models, and adapt 
them for your own use. Return the 
professional favor by spreading the word 
about these studies, and by making the 
time to document and share your own 
results. The ﬁeld is richer when we build 
on example.

Chapter 4: Project Spotlights
 Recruitment has become a  
high-stakes game for universities 
everywhere, each seeking to increase 
enrollment and attract the best  
and brightest. 
To stay competitive, Arts University 
Bournemouth (AUB), a leading specialist 
arts university in the United Kingdom, 
needed to refresh its brand strategy. They 
sought to capture the imagination of 
students from around the globe who were 
looking to enter the creative industries.  
Goals 
AUB had identiﬁed speciﬁc recruitment 
targets. Their campaign would need 
to hit a variety of touch-points with 
potential students from initial discovery 
to submitting an application, through 
enrollment. They recognized the need for 
an external perspective but the university’s 
small internal marketing team would need 
to easily manage the project’s rollout. 
AUB retained Bond & Coyne, a brand 
design agency with a history of excellence 
serving arts, education, and nonproﬁt 
markets. They would work closely with 
the school to create a strategy and visual 
language that could transcend media 
formats and communication scenarios. 
The charge: Cut through the clutter of 
a competitive market, resonate with a 
discerning audience, and hit AUB’s new 
enrollment metrics.

Chapter 4: Project Spotlights
Research + Deliverables 
The Bond & Coyne agency has a deep 
commitment to research, “context is critical 
to success” is a tenet of their practice. They 
began the project by investigating trends 
in higher education recruitment. Close 
attention was also paid to the speciﬁc 
needs of AUB. Organizational strategy was 
analyzed and mapping exercises were 
undertaken to align recruitment efforts 
with academic and budgetary calendars. 
“We know that as a studio there is no point 
in delivering a ‘big idea’ if the practicalities 
of making it a reality prevent it from ﬂying,” 
says Mike Bond, the ﬁrm’s cofounder and 
strategy director.
Understanding the audience would also 
be critical to the project’s success. The 
creative team gathered research to create 
a working knowledge of the individuals 
their campaign would target—going well 
beyond what demographics could offer. 
They sought qualities and values unique to 
that group. Curiosity, passion, individuality, 
and the desire to explore were identiﬁed 
as themes that resonated with young 
creatives. With this information the 
team could craft a purposeful message, 
regardless of form. 
Going beyond the brief, Bond & Coyne 
determined a conceptual direction ﬂexible 
enough to work across multiple channels 
(online, print, and environmental). 
It would be adaptive to a variety of 
marketing needs, and easily scalable 
for special events. The brand refresh 
focuses on the journeys of AUB students, 
rather than selling an institution. The 
team produced a distinctive range of 
collateral, including exhibition materials 
and take-away promotions for site visits, 
animations, and illustrations used across 
mediums, a detailed course guide, and a 
unique prospectus/view book designed 
as a metaphor for the AUB experience. 
Using imagery created by students and 
course information from the university’s 
website, combined with inspiration from 
the Eames’ House of Cards, Bond & Coyne 
broke the prospectus out of its traditional 
book form. The resulting cards interlock 
in unlimited arrangements, allowing 
prospective applicants to create their own 
journey, building classes into exciting new 
combinations, mirroring the dynamics 
of the campus’ creative culture and 
expansive resources.
Results 
Bond & Coyne’s strategy is on target.  
The campaign’s success can be measured 
through a rise in inquiries to the university, 
and in applications submitted for 
admission—which have grown by 30% 
since the initial iteration of the project 
was launched. This is a signiﬁcant 
increase relative to their competition in 
the higher education sector. AUB has also 
experienced elevated levels of engagement 
through social media with both prospective 
and current students. The campaign has 
even inspired ‘Aberdeen to Bournemouth,’ 
an alumni relations and networking 
project that documents the success of AUB 
grads across the UK.
 
Bond & Coyne designed 
a full suite of collateral 
for the Arts University 
Bournemouth rebrand. 
Central to recruiting 
efforts was a physically 
interactive prospectus/
view book. 

140
A Designer’s Research Manual
AUB’s new brand strategy and the 
related marketing campaign have also 
been recognized by several prestigious 
creative and education industry awards 
for effectiveness and innovation. That’s 
signiﬁcant for the university, because 
those professional bodies are ﬁlled with 
potential future employers of AUB grads. 
It’s also another opportunity to build the 
university’s reputation for excellence 
within the market it serves. Bond & Coyne 
appreciate the recognition as well, it builds 
the studio’s morale as it provides the basis 
for conversations with future collaborators 
and clients. 
The prospectus package 
opens to reveal a set 
of interlocking cards, 
each with a piece of 
AUB student artwork on 
one side and a course 
description from the 
catalog on the other. 
Potential applicants can 
literally build their own 
unique journey.

 Can a brand development ﬁrm hired 
to create a resonant white paper use 
design thinking to build a stronger 
community instead?
Goals 
Middletown, Connecticut, is a unique New 
England community with an ethnically and 
economically diverse population spread 
out over 42 square miles of rural, urban, 
and suburban landscape. Since 2006 the 
community and its public schools have 
administered a survey to students in 
grades 7–12, seeking to identify, measure, 
and articulate the experiences that youth 
need to thrive (and avoid risky behavior). 
The Middletown Youth Services Bureau 
(MYSB) wanted to develop a white paper 
to share the results of that survey with 
the community. They contacted CO:LAB, a 
regional creative studio with a reputation 
for excellence in socially driven projects, 
to help them create a document that would 
be easy to utilize.    
The survey, Search Institute’s “Proﬁles 
of Student Life: Attitudes and Behaviors 
Survey,” is a popular tool in youth 
development work. The data it gathers is 
cast as “developmental assets” and those 
are used to initiate conversation and 
action around improvement. Middletown’s 
initial results were dismaying, one critical 
indicator reﬂecting youth perceptions 
of being valued and supported by their 
community registering at only 19%.

inspired action.

145
Chapter 4: Project Spotlights
Working with MYSB, CO:LAB saw 
opportunity for design to do more 
than communicate survey results. The 
partnership developed a strategy to 
intervene. Rich Hollant, CO:LAB founder 
and principal, describes their vision: 
“Ultimately, our goal was to bring youth 
issues to the center of the community 
not as ‘a problem to resolve,’ but as an 
opportunity that can impact everything 
from quality-of-life measurements to 
property values to economic development.” 
Theirs would be a campaign in multiple 
phases, seeking to increase conditions for 
area youth to feel a “sense of belonging,” 
and planning for measurable outcomes. 
Research + Deliverables 
Data from the initial Search Institute 
survey had inspired the project, but the 
partnership knew they would need to 
gather more information to adequately 
address its ﬁndings. They undertook 
video interviews with survey participants, 
their role models, and other community 
members. Youth participants were asked 
three questions: 
• How do you believe the community  
views youth?
• How do you feel about these perceptions?
• What would you want from adults in  
your community?
Hollant describes the results of that 
documentation as “both heart-wrenching 
and ﬁlled with hope.” They shared edited 
video with community members, asking 
each adult participant to commit one 
thing they could do to help build up the 
deﬁcit of developmental assets. This 
became raw material for the campaign. 
An extensive variety of designed collateral 
was created to support outreach efforts, 
including websites, posters, postcards, 
buttons, program logos and t-shirts, 
environmental design and signage, and 
more. Some of the materials performed 
traditional marketing functions, others 
were used to encourage students to 
engage in a dialogue around their own 
self-interest. As the campaign progressed, 
the creative team focused on norms-
building, telling the story of community 
members who were making great strides 
connecting with youth to the beneﬁt of 
their organization or business. 
The partnership avoided a singular 
solution, understanding that no activity, 
event, or entity alone could address such a 
broad need. Their messaging emphasizes 
coalitions of impact. 
Results 
What was once envisioned as a one-
off report became the Asset Promise 
campaign. Inclusive of all Middletown 
residents, the ongoing efforts involve 
elements designed to empower young 
people to deliver messages in their own 
words. It also endeavors to shift adult 
perspectives, targeting any grown-up 
a Middletown kid might encounter, 
from parents and teachers to coaches, 
neighbors, shop-owners, and more. 

146
A Designer’s Research Manual
Most importantly, Asset Promise facilitates 
participation across the community. 
Sometimes openly declarative, such as 
the “Asset Promise / I Promise” program, 
which incorporated buttons, posters, and 
video pledges from participants of all ages 
publically committing to build opportunity. 
Other times evident through action: 
• Local merchants have co-branded TeenTuesdays, 
extending discounts to youth who were 
previously kept at arm’s length. 
• MYSB was able to build a vetted, veriﬁed 
online directory called MyConnections, where 
parents and children can ﬁnd local activities 
and services to support juvenile development. 
• Middletown’s Mayor even participates, meeting 
at a local cupcake shop to bake and talk about 
policies that affect kids.  
The longitudinal project is ongoing, and 
remains rooted in measurement. The 
schools continue to administer Search 
Institute’s survey. Results following the 
three-year span between initial survey and 
next assessment revealed improvements 
of nearly 40% in the ﬁve lowest rated asset 
areas. The community-wide investment, 
led by design and powered by a robust, 
collaborative ground game, has generated 
real social value for the city of Middletown. 
It has also been recognized as a model of 
success in the state of Connecticut, and is 
being studied by other communities. 
For CO:LAB the project has reinforced 
the ﬁrm’s reputation as a purpose-
driven social design consultancy. The 
Asset Promise experience has made 
their team especially adept at identifying 
organizational and programmatic capacity, 
and establishing appropriate pacing as 
change catalysts. Hollant says he now 
asks different questions when entering 
into partnerships, focused on selecting 
meaningful projects that also stand a good 
chance of yielding signiﬁcant results. As 
you might imagine, referrals from their 
Asset Promise work abound. 
The campaign included 
a rebrand of the 
Middletown Youth 
Services Bureau and 
a new web resource 
connecting young people 
to activities, programs, 
and services.

 Studies tell us the millennial 
generation craves discovery. 
They seek to be on the edge of new 
products, movements, and trends—always 
a step ahead of peers and colleagues.
Nowhere is that desire more prominent 
than in New York City, especially in the 
Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg 
(possibly the epicenter of hipster nation). 
As millennials eschew mega brands 
for smaller, curated experiences, can 
good design help an emerging home 
furnishings retailer expand its brand but 
keep its sense of novelty? 
Goals
BEAM is a home furnishings store in 
Williamsburg, focused on the well-
designed life. The co-owners established 
the store’s success curating furniture, 
home goods, accessories, and interior 
design services. They’d developed a 
rapport with locals and drop-in tourists, 
and had a knack for catering to an 
audience hungry for new. But they needed 
help extending those in-store experiences 
to a broader online customer base.   
The duo selected GFDA to tackle their 
branding project because, in addition to 
traditional design and communication 
services, the ﬁrm had experience with 
product development and distribution,  
and a research-driven approach to 
problem-solving. BEAM’s owners knew 
that they wanted to create a stronger 
brand, grow revenue, and increase their 
online presence—and they knew they 
needed help to do so.

digital presence allows 
the Brooklyn retailer to 
compete with larger, more 
established furniture and 
home brands.

151
Chapter 4: Project Spotlights
Research + Deliverables
GFDA started with those broad initial 
goals, then engaged in exploratory 
research to establish a list of qualitative 
and quantitative metrics for evaluation, 
and speciﬁc strategies for achievement. 
They reviewed BEAM’s business plan, 
including market analysis, industry 
analysis, competitive analysis, and strategic 
positioning. This helped frame the problem, 
allowing the designers to understand their 
client’s vision for the growing retailer. 
Then they engaged in competitor proﬁling, 
digging deeper into both the local market 
(Williamsburg design retailers) and the 
online market (retailers with established 
reach). The team conducted unstructured 
interviews with the owners and a random 
sampling of store patrons. These helped to 
build a deeper understanding of the shop’s 
day-to-day culture, and of an average 
customer’s experience. Photo ethnography 
was used to determine how the storefront 
was perceived by potential customers, 
assisting exterior signage placement with 
an intention of drawing in more walk-by 
street trafﬁc.
At the conclusion of their research 
GFDA compiled a 17-page report that 
synthesized their ﬁndings, outlining their 
proposed communication strategy and 
associated deliverables. A successful 
project would help BEAM increase sales 
through traditional in-store shopping 
and online sales, while bolstering social 
media engagement with their audience. 
They also wanted to help BEAM build 
better media relations, increasing the 
nature and volume of press coverage 
online and in print.
GFDA wanted the brand to reﬂect the 
personality and energy of BEAM’s 
owners. Previous iterations felt static 
when compared with the dynamics of the 
in-store experience. The design should 
be ﬂexible, responding to the customers’ 
interest in change and originality. GFDA 
created a new identity system with usage 
guide, collateral for the shop (including 
pricing cards, area maps, shopping bags, 
and more), marketing materials such as 
postcards and email templates, and an 
e-commerce website to launch the  
new brand. 
The visual components of 
the brand were designed 
with the rotation of the 
retailer’s stock in mind. 
Simple typography and 
black lines ground the 
whimsy of color and 
pattern evolutions in 
merchandise. 

152
A Designer’s Research Manual
Results
GFDA’s research-driven process paid off in 
big ways for their client, hitting multiple 
success metrics, including: 
• A 40% increase in overall sales
• A whopping 344% increase in online sales 
• A 43% increase in visitors to the site 
• An 162% increase in average orders/cart size
Project results have extended beyond 
increased revenue. The rebrand increased 
exposure to new audiences too. Co-owner 
Greg Coccaro says, “The branding has 
elevated BEAM’s place in the market. Not 
only have we seen a noticeable increase in 
sales, but the exposure has continued to 
snowball. This year we’ve been picked up 
by various industry publications and blogs 
that were previously out of reach for us.” 
For GFDA principals Jason Bacher and 
Brian Buirge, the success of the BEAM 
project reinforces an appreciation of 
research-driven process. The outcome 
serves as evidence that making informed 
design decisions ultimately generates 
tangible business results. The studio 
uses the success of BEAM’s rebrand to 
educate new clients on the value of design, 
emphasizing that research is essential to 
achieving project success.
After the rebrand and 
e-commerce platform were 
implemented, online sales 
increased by 344%, and 
combined sales, including 
the retail location, 
increased by 40%. 
The outcome  
serves as evidence 
that making 
informed design 
decisions ultimately 
generates tangible 
business results.

 Everyone knows millennials are 
connected, they “like,” and they 
 
“pin,” and occasionally “swipe right.” 
But do they send greeting cards? 
Goals 
Millennials are the largest American 
generation to date. As a group their 
numbers now exceeded even the baby 
boomers’ and are signiﬁcantly larger 
than caught-in-the-middle generation X. 
Millennials are also more diverse than 
previous generations, with more than 
40% identifying with minority race or 
ethnic groups in the last US census. This 
generation, born in the 80s and 90s, is 
becoming an increasingly important 
consumer segment. 
Hallmark is a brand in the business of 
“helping people make emotional connections

essential component of the brand.  
The aging baby boomer generation

to increase sales and brand awareness,

cards relevant to the largest generation 
living in the US. 
Research + Deliverables 
The Hallmark creative team began  
their investigation with a comprehensive 
literature review of existing information. 
They mined US Census Bureau data for 
hard facts and reviewed other sources to 
answer a variety of queries about their 
target millennial audience, including: 
• What are prefered connecting behaviors 
(technology and social media platforms)?
• What life stage(s) are they experiencing?
• What is their daily landscape (encounters, 
experiences)?
The company’s Consumer Understanding 
and Insights division helped dive beyond 
that initial data set, using consumer 
research, retail learning labs, and 
industry estimates to gain insight on 
how millennials perceive the Hallmark 
brand, and if there were any beneﬁts or 
barriers to their engagement. 
The ﬁndings were presented in a research 
report. This helped product teams 
understand the relatively new audience. 
Salient points framed an optimistic and 
conﬁdent generation who were also:   
• The largest users of social networking 
• Trend-forward, but seeking authenticity and 
uniqueness  
• Less inclined to traditional notions of home and 
family, but with an afﬁnity for collaboration and 
a preference for teamwork 
• Under-employed, but with different expectations 
from previous generations about career paths 
and workplace culture
• Discerning with their dollars, seeking value 
The research also identiﬁed opportunities 
and gaps in Hallmark’s product portfolio. 
Discussions informed by this information 
concluded that millennial needs were 
different enough to warrant a new 
product offering.
When Hallmark establishes a new 
product line they begin by producing 
documentation to help deﬁne a customer

 How does the company that 
coined the phrase “Good design is 
good business” pivot through rapid 
technological change—navigating 
innovation and opportunity from 
tabulating machines, scales, and 
cash registers to artiﬁcial intelligence, 
health care analytics, and Mars lander 
hardware? By design, of course. 
Goals 
IBM has a storied history of investing in 
design, and more than 100 years after the 
corporation was founded, Ginni Rometty, 
chairman, president, and CEO declared 
that change at IBM would be driven by 
it. Could an organization that many (even 
internally) viewed as technology-driven 
shift to a human-centered mission? While 
IBM already had some designers on staff, 
there was no common or systematic 
practice of design. Could design thinking 
be that common practice? Could it inspire 
new products and services from any 
team, ultimately driving better human 
outcomes? Could it empower diverse 
teams, drive collaboration across the 
workforce, including engineers, product 
managers, sales staff, and seasoned 
researcher scientists with no creative 
training? IBM Design was tasked with 
nothing less than changing corporate 
culture through design.

Research + Deliverables 
To deliver human-centered outcomes and 
design thinking, the company needed 
to scale the practice of design research 
so that it was approachable, accessible, 
and of beneﬁt to any employee. Chris 
Hammond, design research lead + 
practice manager at IBM Design, headed 
the team creating the tools to do so. 
Hammond’s team ﬁrst needed to 
understand how and where successful 
methods were already in use. Through 
observation, they began cataloging IBM 
team operations, seeking to learn how 
successful teams incorporated design 
research into their practice, and how 
they fostered user empathy, generated 
ideas, and collaborated. When an 
adequate amount of observational data 
was collected, team members began 
interviewing a range of employees, 
including designers, researchers, and 
engineers, establishing a baseline of 
common experiences.  
That information helped the team 
identify 49 key employees with expert 
knowledge who were asked to share their 
insight. The Design Research Content 
Creation Guide was used to solicit 
speciﬁc information. Three writing cues 
guided participants to provide thoughtful

and best practices for 
anyone, not just IBM 
employees.
responses outlining what research 
methods they used, what frameworks 
or models helped guide their process, 
and how they might engage their entire 
team in research activities. Hammond 
and crew stayed in contact with the 
participants, encouraging thoughtful 
discussion, and providing feedback based 
on their responses to ensure the most 
accurate representations of the research 
activities and methods used. 
The team also conducted trial workshops, 
using the information collected by the 
guide as curriculum. The goal of these 
workshops was to ascertain the best ways 
to communicate and teach the concepts 
company-wide. 
The results, a collaborative effort of 
dozens of IBM experts, is a practice that 
enables change and a comprehensive 
website repository of accessible design 
research methods. This approach 
provides IBM employees around the 
world with convenient and effective 
methods for integrating design research 
into their workﬂow. Better still, the 
site lives outside the IBM ﬁrewall,

Results 
Release of the practice is just the 
beginning for IBM Design. More IBM 
teams are engaging in design research 
than ever before, whether they have 
a trained researcher on staff or not. 
Hammond’s team continues to update 
and evaluate the content, using anecdotal 
feedback and traditional business metrics 
such as Net Promoter Score (NPS) data. 
NPS measures how likely it is that 
someone will refer the site to a friend, 
and this site’s scores are on the rise. This 
means word-of-mouth enthusiasm for the 
IBM Design Research site is spreading. 
In addition to the tactical, they’ve 
incorporated internal functionality, using 
it as a repository for consent forms and 
related procedural resources needed 
for conducting research. It’s also an 
opportunity to collaborate externally, 
bringing together the necessary tools 
for IBM to practice design research at 
a world class level, and sharing them 
extensively with anyone else like-
minded. IBM Design employees have 
enthusiastically discussed these methods 
at creative industry conferences and 
events, actively championing the power of 
design and design thinking. Their expert 
ambassadors report back consistent 
thanks from receptive crowds. Good 
design continues to be good business.

 Humantiﬁc practices at the 
intersection of three streams of 
activity: research, sensemaking, and 
organizational change.
Today’s organizational leaders are being 
hit with terabytes of external and internal, 
quantitative and qualitative information 
from a multitude of sources. The arrival 
of the so-called Big Data wave has created 
a ﬁre hose of quantitative content that 
has the potential to enrich or erode the 
capacity of organizations and societies to 
adapt to continuous change. In addition, 
new forms of human-centered research 
are generating insights that extend beyond 
simple data analysis.
While old-fashioned hunches and intuition 
continue to play a role in leadership, many 
leaders seek to reinvent themselves by 
adopting methods that integrate more 
tangible forms of insight into their idea 
and decision-making activities. These 
may include customized private research, 
purchased trends research, public 
research, along with private and public 
forms of data.

DESIGN RESEARCH +  
VISUAL SENSEMAKING
(OR MAKING SENSE OF RESEARCH)
Humantiﬁc helps business

makes sense of data 
through visualization.

167
Chapter 4: Project Spotlights
To make effective use of such diverse 
content requires visual sensemaking skills; 
an ability to unpack and organize fuzzy 
content, and differentiate which users 
require information in different ways. 
While content volume and complexity 
continues to rise, user attention spans 
continue to be compressed, presenting 
unique information digestion challenges 
for most organizations.
In our work with organizational leaders, 
we connect research with human-centered 
visual sensemaking and changemaking. 
We seek to humanize, shape, and then 
integrate diverse insight streams into 
a strategic co-creation process. This 
integration has been at the core of how 
we help organizational leaders since we 
founded Humantiﬁc in 2001. 
Part of Humantiﬁc’s “secret sauce” is a 
ﬁve-dimensional model of sensemaking 
which includes:
1. Making sense of the challenge/ 
opportunity space
2. Making sense of human behaviors in the 
challenge/opportunity space
3. Making sense of the data/information in 
challenge/opportunity space
4. Making sense of the project team’s  
thinking styles
5. Making sense of the challenge owner’s 
thinking styles
We bring this into a workshop setting to 
inform the changemaking process. We 
encourage participants to interact with the 
information as strategic co-creators. 
The goal of visual sensemaking is to 
make the complex clear, helping busy 
participants accelerate the process 
of information digestion and put it to 
practical use. That use might involve 
co-creating new strategies, addressing 
complex challenges, envisioning the 
future, or informing product, service, 
or experience development. We are 
teaching organizational leaders effective 
changemaking skills for a complex, 
dynamic world.

 Can design transform a commodity 
chain hotel into a repeat destination 
for frequent travelers—turning weary 
business commuters into welcomed 
brand loyalists? 
Goals 
Hyatt is a global hospitality company with 
a broad portfolio of properties and a range 
of customer offerings: luxury hotels, all-
inclusive resorts, boutique lodging, vacation 
ownership opportunities, and more. The 
corporation acquired the AmeriSuites 
chain with the intention of expanding 
their offerings in the fast-growing select 
service hotel category. Select service hotels 
keep consumer prices down by reducing 
amenities such as expansive meeting rooms 
and conference spaces, ballrooms, multiple 
on-site luxury restaurants, spas, etc. 
Think of the frequent traveler who values 
familiarity, convenience, and affordability 
over luxury or recreation, and you’ll 
understand the audience. 
Hyatt hotels are upscale, focused on 
service and design. At the time of 
purchase, AmeriSuites was under-
invested and lacked deﬁning character, 
placing the chain behind industry average 
in price-per-room. Hyatt had identiﬁed 
opportunity for growth, the challenge 
would be to decide where to invest to 
improve the guest experience. They 
enlisted Lippincott, a global creative 
consultancy, to help them reinterpret 
the select service category. Hyatt wanted

the experience of visiting the hotel, how 
it would look, sound, smell. They also 
had very speciﬁc business objectives: The 
new offering needed to hit ROI targets by 
increasing occupancy at a higher room rate. 
Research + Deliverables 
Su Mathews Hale, senior Lippincott 
partner and creative director on the 
Hyatt Place project, describes the creative 
team’s approach as “an integrated effort 
between strategy, design, and innovation.” 
The ﬁrm undertook a rigorous and in-
depth research process to understand 
the value of the market, and identify 
customer groups to be served and unique 
ways to serve them. Their strategic 
review included a wide range of research 
tactics, including market opportunity 
mapping, audience segmentation, and 
focus groups conducted with audiences 
across the nation.  
The process revealed an important 
customer segment, labeled “Road 
Warriors.” These individuals travel 
extensively for business and miss the 
comfort and familiarity of home. They’re 
looking for a hotel that will work around 
their hours, with accessible food options 
and business centers regardless of what 
hour ﬂight delays or trafﬁc jams cause 
them to arrive. They need dependable, 
robust Internet access and cable TV, a 
place to work and a place to unwind, easy 
access to toiletries, towels, and linens. 
They value staff that are unobtrusive but 
available if needed. They’re looking for a 
home away from home. 
Lippincott used this information to 
establish a holistic positioning platform 
that would activate the brand throughout 
a guest’s experience. Their positioning 
concept “larger than home,” embraced 
that sense of place guests were missing 
when on the road—somewhere to settle-
in, or return to. The new name that it 
inﬂuenced, “Hyatt Place,” conveys that 
notion. The visual identity designed for 
Hyatt Place matches the tone: friendly, 
direct, modern, and a little whimsical. It 
elevates the chain from its select service 
competitive set (DoubleTree, Holiday Inn 
Select, Ramada, etc.).   
Lippincott designed a set of “signature 
moments” to differentiate the Hyatt 
Place experience. Guests can order 
food and drinks at check-in, a major 
convenience to fatigued business 
travelers. They are greeted by sensory 
experiences in the common places of the 
hotels: 200 music tracks that vary by 
time of day, signature scents, furniture 
to help you unwind. Each component is

orchestrated to evoke the right emotional 
response, relief at the inclusion of custom 
expense envelopes to help business 
travelers with an essential chore, joy 
at convenient and colorful grab-and-
go coffee mugs (that also make guests 
into mobile brand carriers). Great effort 
has been made to address every detail, 
yet remain approachable. Lippincott 
even provided training programs and 
employee guidelines.
Results 
The transformation from AmeriSuites 
to Hyatt Place was more than just 
a dramatic visual and experiential 
improvement. In the ﬁrst year that the 
brand went live there was a 35% increase 
in revenue per room, and Hyatt Place 
was voted ﬁrst in its class in a JD Powers 
customer satisfaction survey. These 
successes helped attract development 
and expand new-build deals. They’re also 
building brand loyalists, as satisﬁed Hyatt 
Place guests look to the umbrella of Hyatt 
offerings when they make additional 
travel plans. 
Working with Lippincott sparked 
change within the Hyatt organization. 
The success of Hyatt Place proved the 
merits of a creative, experience-driven 
approach. Lippincott’s emphasis on 
authentic interaction and emotional 
engagement had beneﬁts for guests 
and employees alike. As a result, the 
partnership continues to identify new 
consumer segments, lifestyle trends, and 
opportunities within the Hyatt portfolio.  
   
Lippincott considered 
every aspect of of a 
guest’s visit, integrating 
sight, sound, smell, and 
touch into a cohesive 
experience.

 Poor diets and sedentary lifestyles 
are contributing to a health crisis in 
the United Kingdom. 
The number of individuals living 
with type 2 diabetes is growing at an 
alarming rate in Scotland, accounting for 
approximately 10% of the annual budget 
of Scotland’s National Health Service. Cost 
of treatment per individual is expensive, 
and recurring, due to the chronic nature 
of the disease. Complications from type 
2 diabetes frequently lead to loss of 
employment, compounding ﬁnancial 
impact. Can design intervene?   
Goals
Design in Action, a knowledge exchange 
hub and incubator for design-led 
innovation in the UK, hosted a series of 
events challenging the creative industry 
to address social welfare and economic 
development issues. The series, named 
Chiasma, was adjudicated by design 
thought leaders. Winning teams would 
receive funding to prototype and test  
their concepts. 
One Chiasma team focused on generating 
new ideas for Scotland’s growing food 
sector. The event paired creatives whose 
skills ranged from illustration to service 
design, with experts in nutrition, food 
product design, engineering, and food 
science. The two-day event acted as 
a forum for academics and industry 
professionals to meet, collaborate,  
and innovate.

Chapter 4: Project Spotlights
Design researcher Lauren Currie saw 
the event as an opportunity. Her pitch: 
educate the public on the dangers of sugar 
overconsumption and its impact on health 
and well-being. Her winning concept, 
Know Sugar, would create an immersive 
educational space using design to help 
individuals make healthier lifestyle and 
diet choices. Know Sugar had three goals: 
• Educate children and adults on the health 
impacts of sugar and the beneﬁts of a  
low-sugar diet. 
• Empower food producers to take positive action 
to reduce the amount of sugar in their products.
• Inﬂuence future changes in government  
dietary policy.
Research+Deliverables
Understanding nutritional science was 
key to project success. Currie and the Red 
Jotter team began by doing desk research, 
collecting all the necessary information 
related to sugar consumption, dietary 
requirements, and health trends. They 
also needed to understand the nature 
and cost of treatment for type 2 diabetes. 
A comprehensive literature review 
established context for the remainder  
of the project.
With that information in hand, the team 
built an online survey and conducted 
unstructured interviews, gathering more 
data about sugar consumption and 
dietary habits. With this as a foundation 
they could envision several different 
service design prototypes and the 
collateral needed to support them. Currie 
describes the team as having “A bias 
toward action—learning by doing, and 
thinking through making!” Design and 
visualization was an essential component 
of developing solutions.
The Know Sugar pop-up shop prototype 
was open for two days in the Wellgate 
shopping center. An empty retail space 
was transformed into an interactive 
environment to educate the general public 
about sugar’s impact on health and well-
being. Everything about the space, from 
the concept and educational exercises 
through signage, handouts, and even 
employee identiﬁcation was designed by 
the Red Jotter team. The shop was staffed 
by designers, photographers, nutritionists, 
and diabetes experts who guided 
participants through interventions to sugar 
consumption. 
Visitors could evaluate 
their understanding of 
nutritional information, 
personal eating habits, 
and health goals, then 
place a paper avatar on 
the Know Sugar scale to 
determine an appropriate 
challenge.

178
A Designer’s Research Manual
Visitors to the space were invited to 
evaluate their understanding of how much 
sugar they consumed daily. They could 
then take the Know Sugar Challenge, 
selecting an easy, medium, or hard 
challenge to alter their current lifestyle/
dietary choices. Health care workers were 
on staff to provide in-depth evaluations, 
and participants could visit an open 
kitchen supplied with grab bags of healthy, 
low-sugar snacks. Upon exit, visitors 
were asked to write on a chalkboard as a 
personal pledge and declaration of how 
they intended to change habits.
The space served as a design laboratory. 
Through the two-day experience, Know 
Sugar staff members collected data on 
project participants which would be 
used to further reﬁne messaging and 
future project deliverables. Volunteers 
used questionnaires to evaluate speciﬁc 
components of each participant’s 
experience, staff members used clickers 
to track attendance and interest, and the 
team would regroup and share insights 
and observations at the end of each day. 
This helped determine concept feasibility, 
scalability, public acceptance, and impact 
on individual behavior. 
to collect information on 
successful interventions 
and tools. Staff members 
and design researchers 
guided participants 
through the space, 
conducting interviews 
and taking notes on what 
resonated, and what 
could be improved.
Visitors to the Know 
Sugar pop-up shop 
could interact with a 
variety of educational 
experiences. The space 
served as a laboratory 
Results
During the two-day experiment, 750 
people attended the shop. Exit interviews 
indicated that an overwhelming majority 
of those visitors enjoyed their experience 
and learned something new. Of those 750 
participants, nearly 75% took the Know 
Sugar Challenge, committing to make 
some level of change in their own sugar 
consumption habits. 
Public sector experts and policy makers 
were impressed with the team’s efforts, 
encouraging continued exploration and 
idea sharing. Currie and her team are 
in dialog with Diabetes UK and Action 
Against Salt to determine next steps. They 
plan to scale the lessons learned through 
the Know Sugar prototype for application 
to other health and wellness issues.
For Currie, the experience served 
as proof of concept for design-led 
interventions to public health problems. 
She also reinforces the virtue of inviting 
the audience to shape a solution, 
emphasizing codesign and active 
participation as key components for 
successful service design endeavors.

water isn’t about quenching thirst, 
it’s about breaking cycles of poverty. 
Goals 
In the developing world, insufﬁcient 
access to clean water leads to dehydration, 
malnourishment, and disease. It’s also 
connected to individual loss of personal 
income; absence from family, home, and 
school; and exposure to criminal activity 
and personal exploitation—especially 
dangerous for vulnerable women and 
children in these regions.
Lifewater International, a nonproﬁt 
organization working to end the global 
water and sanitation crisis, was looking for 
ways to broaden their donor base and build 
awareness of their mission.
They turned to Rule29, a strategic design 
ﬁrm located outside of Chicago, with a rich 
portfolio of philanthropic and ﬁnancially 
successful projects. Through their GIVE 
program the studio had a history of 
committing 20% of its time and resources 
to “causes, ideas and initiatives that help 
create a healthier, more equitable, more 
sustainable, and more welcoming world.” 
Client and creative were a good cultural ﬁt. 
Lifewater hired Rule29 to explore how a 
design-led approach could help them meet a 
ﬁnancial goal of $40,000 raised to construct 
a well that would serve 1,000 Ugandans; 
increase Lifewater’s donor list; and bring 
awareness to the world water crisis.

Chapter 4: Project Spotlights
Research + Deliverables
To craft a resonant narrative and develop 
a comprehensive fundraising plan, Rule29 
needed to understand several key issues 
relevant to the project’s success. Their 
process began with an audit of Lifewater’s 
existing communication materials and 
interviews with organizational leadership 
to familiarize themselves with the mission, 
services, and goals of their client.
To accurately craft a story, the ﬁrm needed 
to understand conditions on the ground in 
the countries in which they were trying to 
affect change. Team members spent time in 
Africa, observing life in remote villages and 
conducting unstructured interviews with 
key Lifewater personnel working in the 
region. They documented their experience 
through photography and video so insights 
could be shared with colleagues when they 
returned to Chicago. 
They investigated nonproﬁt fundraising 
tactics, looking for examples of best 
practices, and learning from failures. 
Personas were developed for the varied 
audiences to be targeted in the campaign, 
including sponsors, donors, participants, 
and more. These helped Rule29 build mini-
strategies for communicating with each 
group necessary to the project’s success. 
Based on the formative research Rule29 
proposed a fundraising event centered 
around a compelling narrative, one that 
would support the Lifewater brand while 
cutting through media clutter prevalent 
in the nonproﬁt space. Ideally the event 
could be repeatable, if successful, allowing 
for continued fundraising efforts. 
The creative team planned, branded, 
promoted and participated in a charity 
bicycle ride across the state of California, 
called Wheels4Water, to raise funds for 
Lifewater’s Uganda project. The small 
but committed team of cyclists included 
Rule29 principal, Justin Ahrens, and 
frequent collaborator, photographer, 
and Wonderkind Studio founder, Brian 
MacDonald. To draw attention to the 
world water crisis, the cyclists would 
not carry any potable water with them 
during their journey, relying on sources 
found along the route and puriﬁed with 
the simple tools Lifewater distributes, or 
provided by the kindness of strangers. 
This direct participation held the Rule29 
team uniquely accountable for the success 
of the project, and clearly demonstrated 
a connection to both Lifewater’s mission 
and their own GIVE initiative. 
The design team created 
custom cycling jerseys as 
moving advertisements 
that would also 
commemorate the ride 
and acknowledge event 
sponsors.

Results
The Wheels4Water project exceeded 
expectations, raising $100,000 in its 
ﬁrst year, allowing the organization 
to help over 5,000 individuals (well 
beyond that 1,000 person goal). Through 
Wheels4Water, Lifewater has added 
hundreds of new individual and corporate 
donors, and the project helped establish 
ongoing relationships with organizations 
that continue to support their critical 
relief efforts. 
Repeat events have extended those 
fundraising efforts and generated hundreds 
of thousands of media impressions 
through print, social media, and traditional 
broadcast—fostering connections with new 
audiences, and building broad awareness 
of Lifewater’s role in international water 
crisis relief efforts. 
For Rule29, the experience changed the 
ﬁrm’s approach to campaign projects, 
redeﬁning their process. The work, 
from research through conception and 
production, showcased how design can 
have a tangible impact on human lives. 
Wheels4Water has helped portfolios and 
professionals grow; reafﬁrmed the power 
of creative to affect real change; and led 
to new business relationships, speaking 
engagements, and industry recognition. 
Three years later, Wheels4Water has 
raised over a quarter of a million dollars 
for ongoing Lifewater projects all over 
the globe.

ENHANCING 
VETERANS’ 
EXPERIENCES
 The Department of Veterans 
Affairs is a governmental institution 
dedicated to serving and honoring 
America’s veterans and their families. 
Like so many bureaucratic ofﬁces tasked 
with an enormous service load and ﬁscal 
constraints, the organization was process-
oriented and driven by efﬁciencies. VA 
Secretary Bob McDonald recognized the 
need to shift the organization’s focus back 
to the individual. Seeking systemic change 
he established the Veterans Experience 
Ofﬁce, a VA team comprised of service 
and visual designers, content strategists, 
data analysts, community engagement 
specialists, an operations team, and project 
managers with a mandate to help the VA 
become more customer-centered. 
Goals
The Veterans Experience Ofﬁce, led by 
chief veterans experience ofﬁcer Tom Allin, 
was charged with shifting VA employees 
from a process-perspective (How can we 
work better?) to one that was person-
centered (How can we help veterans feel 
served and supported?). 
The VA has more than 300,000 employees, 
approximately a third of whom are 
veterans themselves. It is an organization 
empathetic and dedicated to its mission, 
but many of those employees think “I’m 
a veteran, I know what veterans want.” 
And while our individual perspectives 
provide valuable insight, a singular point 
of reference can also be limiting. Internal 
organizational culture tended to parse

veterans in terms of demographics: 
Vietnam Vets, Gulf War Vets, Women Vets, 
and so on. The Veterans Experience team 
wanted to create an understanding that 
went deeper.
A large number of VA employees work 
directly with veterans, but many others 
are one-step removed from the individual’s 
experience. The team identiﬁed that it 
would be especially important to help 
that group of workers keep their focus 
on VA customer needs/perspectives, 
when it is easy to shift focus to process 
and organizational needs. The team’s 
goal was to present a rich, diverse, and 
comprehensive understanding of the 
veterans being served to the people who 
were working for them. 
Research+ Deliverables
The Veterans Experience Ofﬁce Insight and 
Design Team researchers began with a 
traditional “listening tour.” They met with 
VA senior leadership, middle management, 
and frontline staff to gather internal 
perceptions. They also sought a broad 
sampling of veterans’ voices, conducting 
in-depth ethnographic research with 
special focus on groups often marginalized, 
such as those living in rural areas, women, 
and people of color. They wanted to hear 
from all branches and eras of service, 
and from the families of veterans. Luckily 
several of the researchers were veterans 
themselves and reached out to friends and 
trusted colleague networks to help recruit. 
Most volunteers were eager to participate 
and motivated to share. Many referenced 
lifelong bonds, and an interest in doing 
their part to make VA services better for 
their friends.
The team hit the road to gather research 
in a series of “sprints,” often with 
only a couple of days preparation and 
planning—a schedule that could adapt 
to word-of-mouth introductions and 
interviewee availability. Their ﬁrst mission 
was to establish a baseline: “Who are 
our customers and what do they want 
and need from VA?” Followed with a 
deeper dive, seeking to understand key 
journeys through VA services. Ultimately 
they hoped to gather information that 
would assist in the creation and testing of 
prototypes to improve those services. 
Research reporting became the deliverable. 
The team developed a suite of journey 
maps and service design interventions. 
These included persona cards to capture 
rich composite portraits of veterans; help 
employees understand what veterans 
need/want from the VA; and identify 
opportunities where service could improve. 
Example personas include: 
The “Fast Tracker,” separated from the military, 
focused and directed. Will take advantage 
of VA services if they aren’t too difﬁcult or 
cumbersome, but have alternate options. Don’t 
perceive that they “need” the VA. 
The “Day-By-Day,” someone who struggles  
to ﬁnd/maintain stable employment and 
housing. Likely to have medical and/or 
behavioral health challenges. Rely on the VA 
for health care, housing, support groups and 
community. VA is a lifeline.

The Journeys of Veterans 
experience map covers 
ten common life stages, 
calling out “moments 
that matter” to help 
identify opportunities 
for the VA to have a 
signiﬁcant impact on  
the people it serves. 

190
A Designer’s Research Manual
The “Proud Patriot,” an older veteran who 
relies on VA facilities for both health care and a 
stand-in community center.
The cards present a complex assortment 
of veterans at different stages in their lives, 
but with overlapping service needs. 
Where the persona cards capture 
portraits, journey mapping is used to track 
experience. It follows 10 stages of a service 
person’s life from enlistment through 
death—because even in death the VA offers 
beneﬁts to survivors. From one event to the 
next, the experience of veterans, and their 
related interaction with VA services were 
mapped and carefully cataloged. 
Those using the deck and the journey 
maps together can envision different 
scenarios for common VA services, based 
on the individual being served. For 
example, a reservist and a retiree with a 
traumatic brain injury might have very 
different health maintenance needs.  
Results
The accessible, engaging tools that 
the Veterans Experience Ofﬁce created 
spark conversation and help provide 
understanding. That new perspective 
is driving behavioral and cultural shifts 
internally at the VA. Says Sarah Brooks, 
chief design ofﬁcer leading the Insight 
and Design team, “We want the journeys 
to be diagnostics for better running our 
business lines—prioritizing and resourcing 
efforts. We’ve seen it start to happen.” The 
tools have aided in strategic planning 
processes; been embraced by senior 
leaders; and created actionable insights 
for the organization. The visualized and 
curated information resonates in a way 
that another Power Point session or policy 
reports, cannot. People have commented 
that they see themselves, relatives, or 
friends in the work. The genuine quality 
of the content gathered, and the style in 
which it’s presented is building credibility 
and sparking change. It’s even caught the 
attention of Congress. 
This is also a story about the power of 
research-driven design, foundational in 
helping people at the VA see differently and 
embrace a new approach. In less than two 
years the Veterans Experience Ofﬁce went 
from a hypothesis to a demonstrated change 
agent. Brooks and her team are committed 
to delivering a growing body of work that 
delivers “effective, easy, and emotionally 
resonant experiences; working to principles 
versus rules; and spreading those behaviors 
through the organization, top down and 
bottom up.” They’ve even shared some of 
their best practices with you, available at

 The Affordable Care Act was a 
comprehensive reform to health 
care law, enacted to make health 
insurance available and affordable 
for more Americans; expand 
Medicaid to more individuals living 
in poverty; and support medical 
industry innovations that lower 
health care expenses for all. 
On the eve of its launch the massive legal 
shift left many unclear, from industry 
players to businesses and individuals 
seeking to navigate coverage options 
under a new system. Blue Cross and 
Blue Shield of Kansas City (Blue KC) saw 
potential in the transition.
Goals 
As Affordable Care Act enrollment 
deadlines approached, health insurance 
providers were scrambling to reach 
members and nonmembers alike. The 
law would prohibit insurers from denying 
coverage to individuals with pre-existing 
conditions, but also require the uninsured 
to hold coverage. Blue KC saw business 
opportunities in the act, potential to create 
new experiences for individuals seeking 
health insurance, and ways to better serve 
those already covered. 
They envisioned retail spaces where 
potential customers and existing 
policyholders could speak face-to-face 
with Blue KC representatives, demystifying 
coverage options. The convenience,

simplicity, and human interaction, would 
provide assurance to consumers, helping 
them navigate and understand complex 
choices. The space would simultaneously 
serve as lifestyle center, promoting health 
and well-being, and offering free exercise 
and nutrition classes to existing customers. 
It would also be a disruptive sales channel 
to encourage ﬁrst-time applicants or attract 
those who questioned their own coverage. 
With the project deﬁned, Blue KC 
contracted Willoughby Design to craft 
their approach to the retail/outreach 
concept. The goal was to create a space 
that would make health planning a 
proactive, rewarding experience—instead 
of a frustrating chore. 
Research + Deliverables 
The design team began the project by 
seeking to understand the customer 
base. Using observational research and 
unstructured interviews, they visited 
similar facilities around the country, 
noting consumer interactions and 
speaking with employees to discern best 
practices and areas for improvement. The 
information they gathered helped identify 
seven different types of customers, 
ranging from young/uninsured to retired/
insured. They crafted personas to drive 
design based on the varying functional 
and emotional needs of these customers.
The team understood that scalability was 
key, systems should be adaptable to both 
individual customers’ needs and emerging 
health care options and industry trends. 
They were also sensitive to operational 
feasibility, knowing that to be successful the 
concept had to be easy to manage and staff. 
Willoughby identiﬁed the importance 
of connecting the retail endeavor to the 
parent organization. They named the new 
service space “Live Blue,” referencing the 
company name and utilizing its signature 
color, then set out to create a brand that 
would resonate with their identiﬁed 
audience segments. 
The client’s original plan included 
opening ﬁve locations across the Kansas 
City metropolitan area, but the creative 
team encouraged starting with a single 
location, using it as a living laboratory to 
gather more user research, optimizing 
the experience before investing in further 
facilities. Willoughby partnered with Helix 
Architecture and Dimensional Innovations 
signage fabricators to create a welcoming, 
reassuring space that would impart the 
brand’s promise to provide clarity and 
accessibility amidst a sea of confusing 
options. They scouted potential locations 
and considered aesthetics adaptable to 
multiple sites. 
Visualization of the 
brand was extended 
throughout the space, 
creating a friendly, 
motivating environment 
for current policy holders 
and potential customers.

196
A Designer’s Research Manual
The resulting environment reinforces 
the Blue Cross Blue Shield brand 
through color and the use of its iconic 
logo, which was applied to everything 
from skateboards to jump ropes and 
racquetballs. The team integrated a 
rotating retail area into the front of 
the space, making use of storefront 
windows facing the street. This served as 
seasonal or monthly display, which might 
showcase goods from a local running 
shop, nutritional products, or other 
wellness-inspired curations, helping to 
draw in passers-by and local foot trafﬁc.
Results 
The launch of the prototype Live Blue 
retail space was so successful that Blue 
KC has opened two additional locations, 
each actively engaged with their local 
community. Attendance at the free 
ﬁtness and nutrition classes is growing 
dramatically. The retail spaces remain 
relevant well beyond the Affordable 
Care Act because they help individuals 
research, choose, and purchase health 
care. The concept builds on Blue Cross 
Blue Shield’s service expertise, extending 
into other regions of the country as a 
model of change, shaping how health 
insurance is marketed. 
Willoughby’s careful consideration of the 
customer experience created a solution that 
will serve Blue KC, its parent corporation, 
and their customers through ongoing 
political and legal shifts in a ﬂuid market. 
Exercise and nutrition 
classes are an added bonus, 
free to policyholders. The 
space also provides zones 
for retail and displays 
related to wellness, 
helping to draw walk-by 
visitors.
The resulting 
environment 
reinforces the Blue 
Cross Blue Shield 
brand through color 
and the use of its 
iconic logo.
