Foreword
Circuit
Theory
is
the
bedrock
of
Electrical
and
Electronic
Engineering.
Traditionally, the didactic treatment of the subject has been restricted to linear
framework. While linear methods are extremely powerful and universally applied in
Engineering practice, they miss the richness of nonlinear phenomena.
This book takes a uniﬁed approach to both Linear and Nonlinear Circuits,
emphasizing from the outset, that Circuit Theory provides a powerful paradigm for
modelling and analysing a range of physical systems, not just the electrical and
electronic ones. The laws of Circuit Theory are rooted in fundamental physical
principles, and the methods rely on profound mathematics. The circuits paradigm
provide accessible insight and intuition into the operation of a wide range of
physical systems, from neural networks to coupled pendula.
Parodi and Storace have done an excellent job in presenting foundational
material that every undergraduate student should know, followed by advanced
concepts which will enrich the learning experience for more advanced undergrad-
uates and graduate students. By combining this material, their book will also be an
invaluable resource for practising researchers who will, for the ﬁrst time, ﬁnd both
classical linear circuits concepts and advanced results in the one place.

Preface
Circuit theory is a discipline at the crossroad between physics, mathematics and
system theory and provides basic knowledge in various ﬁelds of engineering, such
as electronic devices and circuits, signal processing, control systems. The circuit
theory core is the concept of model, i.e., a mathematical description of a physical
system. Circuit theory treats circuits with a ﬁeld-less approach and, contrary to
general electromagnetic theory, neglects the electromagnetic propagation.
Circuit theory was developed later than electrical circuits, whose origin (ne-
glecting the Greek discover of static electricity) dates back to the end of XVIII
century. The ﬁrst circuit theory laws were provided in the middle of XIX century
and, up to the middle of XX century, the development of circuit theory was basi-
cally related to electrical circuits. During World War II, circuit theory received a
strong boost due to the inﬂuence and growth of disciplines such as system theory,
automatic controls and electronics. With the development of transistors and com-
puters, the realization criteria and the potentialities of circuits underwent deep
changes, concerned with both design (the semiconductor miniaturization made it
possible to conceive ever more ambitious, complex and low-cost circuits) and the
growing corpus of knowledge that circuit theory was called to provide and to
rationalize. The devices made available by technology were described by models,
ﬁrst of elementary devices, such as transistors, and subsequently of circuit parts to
be used as building blocks in broader architectures. The detailed behavior of the
devices inside these blocks became unessential for the user and, as such, usually
ignored.
Over the years, the need of both designing increasingly complex circuits (largely
containing nonlinear devices) and checking their behaviors before concretely
realize them required more and more the use of computer numerical simulations. In
this perspective, the use of models is essential to provide to the computer a sys-
tematic description of the circuit structure, together with the electrical properties of
its components; furthermore, models contributed to the formalization of methods
suitable to be mapped into mathematical algorithms, in particular, for the treatment
of large-size systems of algebraic equations and of systems of ordinary differential
equations. The numerical solutions provided by computers in shorter and shorter
ix

times made it possible to study complex circuits also in the absence of an analytical
solution.
The circuit theory development had repercussions also outside the circuit ﬁeld,
in areas seemingly far from circuits, but where experimental observations displayed
a strong similarity to physical behaviors observable in circuits. This led to formulate
equivalent circuit models mimicking the observed phenomena. When World War II
was still in full swing, for example, Hodgkin and Huxley formulated their circuit
model for neurons, now head of a family of models.
In our vision, a circuit theory course must systematically show ideas and
methods suitable to study both linear and nonlinear circuits, either passive or active.
The presentation of concepts and fundamental methods of analysis must aim not
only to allow their application in today’s problems, but also to highlight their
meaning and potential as tools to understand and address future developments.
These needs were clearly expressed during the ’60s of the last century, when
Charles Desoer and Ernest Kuh adopted them as guidelines for their treatise “Basic
Circuit Theory”, which became a classic for university education. In 1969, at
University of Genoa, Giuseppe Biorci adopted this text (in the original English
version) for his course, and in 1972 he was the Editor of its Italian version. Among
the university texts written with similar motivations in the following years, it should
be deﬁnitely mentioned “Linear and Nonlinear Circuits”, written by the previous
authors and by Leon Chua about twenty years later. More recent books focused on
circuits have downsized, in our opinion, this character. Even if the university
programs strongly changed in the last decades, giving in some cases a larger space
to information at the expenses of knowledge, there is still need of books providing
not only a solid background to all students, but also a broader view to the most
motivated among them. We strongly believe that circuit theory is a highly educa-
tional discipline, not only for Engineers. Indeed, students learn a quite large set of
tools and, when dealing with a speciﬁc problem, they have to decide what subset of
tools can be (or has to be) used to solve it. In our opinion, this capacity of solving
non-trivial problems should remain one of the main elements of the scientiﬁc
cultural baggage. It can certainly be aided and made more powerful by many
practical skills, but cannot be replaced by them.
With these guidelines in mind, this book is structured in multiple reading levels:
each part is split into two chapters (basic level and advanced level), with two
independent levels of reading. Moreover, in the advanced level some suggested
shortcuts provide simpliﬁed reading paths, left to the reader’s choice. The basic
chapters are aimed at newcomers to circuit theory, especially students taking a ﬁrst
course in the subject. Their organization is largely based on the experience ripened
through a one-semester course, taught for several years, ﬁrst at the Polytechnic
University of Milan and then at the University of Genoa. Our goal with these parts
is to explain the mathematics needed to handle circuits as clearly and simply as
possible, and to show how it can be used to analyze/understand how a circuit
works, also through many worked examples. A peculiar feature of this book is its
emphasis on examples, showing how the proposed methods can be applied. The
advanced chapters are aimed at both basic-level university students driven by

Preface

curiosity—in the belief that curiosity is the main driver for studying and learning—
and higher-level students, up to Ph.D. students and young researchers that want to
ﬁnd a complete treatment of many mathematical aspects related to circuits. The
theory is developed systematically, starting with the simplest circuits (linear,
time-invariant and resistive) and providing food for thought on nonlinear circuits,
potential functions, linear algebra, geometrical interpretations of some results. This
is the subject of this volume. Circuits characterized by time-evolution/dynamics
will be treated with the same spirit in a second volume. In our opinion, the multiple
reading levels help teachers to adapt their course to best meet students’ needs and
background. In all cases, students should be assigned homework from the problems
at the end of each chapter. They could also do computer projects based on circuit
simulators and/or build real circuits during lab activities, e.g., to reproduce and
check the results of some of the proposed examples. These aspects are left to the
teacher experience and availability.
We are indebted to our friend Lorenzo Repetto, who carefully revised the pre-
liminary version of this book reporting bugs and providing detailed comments,
many of which were included in the present volume. We also want to remember our
colleague and friend Amedeo Premoli, who passed away in 2014 and who shared
our vision of circuit theory. The structure of this book reﬂects at least in part many
discussions had in the past with him.

Abstract After having introduced the concept of model, in the basic level of this
chapter we deﬁne components, descriptive variables, reference directions, electric
power and energy, and Kirchhoff’s laws.
1.1
Physical Systems, Models, Circuits
All branches of science and engineering are based on the concept of model.
Scientiﬁc model: A description of a physical system or phenomenon, that
relies on existing and commonly accepted knowledge and whose aim is to
make it easier to understand, deﬁne, describe, or simulate.
The concept of model is well described in the following words by Primo Levi [1].
What we commonly mean by “understand” coincides with “simplify”: without a profound
simpliﬁcation the world around us would be an inﬁnite, undeﬁned tangle that would defy our
ability to orient ourselves and decide upon our actions. In short, we are compelled to reduce
the knowable to a schema. [...] This desire for simpliﬁcation is justiﬁed, but the same does
not always apply to simpliﬁcation itself, which is a working hypothesis, useful as long as it
is recognized as such and not mistaken for reality. The greater part of historical and natural
phenomena are not simple, or not simple in the way that we would like.

Usually, a model is based on a mathematical description and on a graphical rep-
resentation and is an approximation of reality. According to Levi’s quotation, a
simpliﬁcation implies a working hypothesis, that is, a choice about the elements
necessary and sufﬁcient to provide the desired level of simpliﬁcation. This choice
should be made by using the so-called Ockham’s1 razor or law of parsimony: among
competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.2
Often, a model is structured as a set of ideal elements that interact and are, in
turn, models. In this book, we call a “circuit” the model of a real circuit and “circuit
elements” or “components” the models of real devices.
As stated above, any ideal element is a mathematical/geometrical abstraction
aimed to represent or approximate a simple physical event or the behavior of a
part of the overall physical system. For instance, the mechanical oscillations of
a body vertically suspended to a coil spring and subject to the force of gravity
(Fig.1.1) can be studied by representing the body as a point mass and the spring as a
component applying a return force to the body proportional to its elongation.3 This
model of the system ignores the extension and shape of the suspended body, which is
considered as a rigid body free from physical extent. Similarly, mass and geometrical
dimensions of the coil spring are ignored and the material it is made of is assumed
to be perfectly elastic. This body and this spring are the ideal elements of the model
of the physical system and are, in turn, models, because the corresponding physical
objects (elements) are more complex both in structure and behavior.
Any physical component can be represented by models with different degrees of
accuracy.Thechosendegreeofmodelingaccuracyusuallydependsonthecomplexity
1William of Ockham (1287–1347) was an outstanding English theologian and scholastic philoso-
pher.
2The most popular version of Ockham’s principle – “Entities must not be multiplied beyond neces-
sity,” translated from Latin Non sunt multiplicanda entia sine necessitate – was actually formulated
by the Irish Franciscan philosopher John Punch in his 1639 commentary on the works of Duns
Scotus.
3This is the so-called Hooke’s law, named after the seventeenth-century British physicist Robert
Hooke. He ﬁrst stated the law in 1660 as a Latin anagram and published the solution of his anagram
in 1678 as “ut tensio, sic vis,” that is, “as the extension, so the force” or “the extension is proportional
to the force.”

of the system. When the overall complexity exceeds a reasonable level, one usually
changes the scale of the description. For instance, complex circuits, made up of
hundreds or even thousands of elements, are usually represented through global
relationships, which neglect the details of what happens to a single device. This is
called a behavioral description and aims at describing only the overall functionality
of the circuit. For instance, integrated circuits are usually modeled in this higher-
level way. In other words, the elements modeling parts of a physical system have
a mathematical description whose accuracy depends on the scale/complexity of the
system itself. Coming back to the previous mechanical example, the simplest model
for the spring, for instance, is based on Hooke’s law, which ignores the viscous
friction originated by the spring movement in the air. A more accurate model would
include an ideal element that takes account of this friction. A further reﬁnement
could relate to the dissipation of energy due to the imperfect elasticity of the material
used for the spring coils, and so on. We thus have the opportunity to represent a
system by using physical models where accuracy and complexity grow with those
of their components. A model good for accuracy of representation and predictive
ability is the basic tool both to study the system’s behavior, analysis, and to solve
design problems.
The above general considerations apply, in particular, when the physical system
is an electric circuit.
The circuits can be lumped – studied by circuit theory – or distributed. This book
deals only with lumped circuits. Their physical dimensions are negligible compared
to the smallest wavelength of interest in the electric variables involved. This means
that any lumped circuit is made up of lumped components and that the length of
any connection is negligible. The lumped circuit, therefore, behaves as a geometric
point: any electrical perturbation immediately affects every part of the circuit (null
propagation times), so that the spatial position of a component with respect to the
others does not affect the electrical behavior of the circuit. In a similar way, in the
example of the suspended body to the spring, the body’s shape and size were ignored
and the body was modeled as a point mass.
In distributed circuits the effects of physical dimensions are no longer negligible.
It can be shown, however, that distributed circuits can be thought of as the result of a
limit process applied to a suitable sequence of lumped circuits. Therefore a tool for
the study of distributed circuits is again circuit theory.
Oneandthesamemodelcansometimesbeusedtostudyphysicalsystemsdifferent
in nature. For example, it could be shown that the behavior of the mechanical model
for the system of Fig.1.1 is equivalent to that of a circuit made up of two components
(namely, an inductor and a capacitor). Generally speaking, this equivalence is based
on the correspondences that are established between the physical variables of two
models and that allow one to switch from the (mathematical) description of a system
to the other. Whenever such equivalence can be established, therefore, an electric
circuit can be employed as an equivalent model for a physical system of nonelectrical
type.

1.2
Components
Any circuit is made up of components.
Component: An object delimited by a closed boundary surface from which at
least two terminals emerge.
The number of terminals is the ﬁrst element of classiﬁcation for a component,
as shown in Fig.1.2. The shape and length of any terminal can be adapted to facili-
tate its connection to other components. The connection between two components is
established by the contact of (at least) a terminal edge, or node, of each component. It
is assumed that all the electromagnetic events characterizing the electrical behavior
of the component are conﬁned in the region within the boundary surface and that
the overall electrical behavior of the component can be described in terms of vari-
ables (called descriptive variables) that can be measured in the region external to the
boundary surface. Therefore the descriptive variables adopt a scale of representation
that ignores the detail of electromagnetic events within the boundary surface. This
means that in circuit theory any information concerning the physical structure and
electromagnetic ﬁelds within the boundary surface of the components is not consid-
ered. As an analogy, a newspaper article could be identiﬁed citing the title and its
author, but neglecting the detailed information represented by the words of its text.
1.3
Descriptive Variables
The descriptive variables for a component must be measurable outside its bound-
ary surface. The most common choice is given by voltages and currents. Alterna-
tively, one might consider magnetic ﬂuxes and electric charges, even if less easily
measurable.

1.3 Descriptive Variables

Fig. 1.3 Ammeter connections
Current: A real variable i ∈R which, in the general case, depends on time:
i = i(t). It is associated with each terminal of the component according to
a given convention. The SI unit of measurement of a current is the ampere,
whose symbol is A.4
The current through a terminal is measured using an instrument called the amme-
ter. It is assumed that the ammeter is ideal, namely that the application of this instru-
ment does not alter the behavior of the circuit. A conventional arrow deﬁnes the way
in which the current must be measured. The ammeter is a particular two-terminal
element whose nodes (marked as + and −) are represented adjacent to the boundary
surface (i.e., the terminals are not represented).
The direction of the arrow representing the current in a terminal deﬁnes how to
connect the ammeter. In Fig.1.3 the two possible choices i and i′ for the current in the
terminal B are indicated by arrows in opposite directions (i′ = −i). They correspond
to two opposite orientations of the pair + and −for the ammeter.
If the ammeter indication in the top connection of Fig.1.3 is −3A, it is said that
i = −3 A; inverting the nodes + and −as in the bottom connection, the ammeter
indication becomes +3A and it is said that i′ = +3 A.
Voltage: A real variable v ∈R which, in the general case, depends on time:
v = v(t). It is associated with any pair of nodes in the circuit according to a
given convention. The SI unit of measurement of voltage is the volt, whose
symbol is V.5
4The ampere is named after André-Marie Ampère (1775–1836), a French mathematician and physi-
cist.
5The volt is named in honor of the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (1745–1827), who invented
the voltaic pile, possibly the ﬁrst chemical battery.

connections
The voltage is measured using an instrument called the voltmeter. It is supposed
that the voltmeter is ideal; that is, its connection to any pair of nodes does not modify
the behavior of the circuit. An oriented arc between the pair of nodes deﬁnes the way
in which the voltage must be measured. In Fig.1.4 the two possible choices vAB and
vB A for the voltage between the nodes A and B are indicated by oppositely oriented
arcs (vB A = −vAB). The corresponding voltmeter connections differ in the opposite
orientations of the pair + and −.
If the voltmeter indication in the top connection of Fig.1.4 is 1.3V , it is said that
vAB = 1.3V ; inverting the nodes + and - as in the bottom connection, the voltmeter
indication becomes −1.3V and it is said that vB A = −1.3V .
1.3.1
Descriptive Variables for Two-Terminal Elements
We now consider a two-terminal element, which is the simplest element that can be
deﬁned.6 On the basis of the previous section, for each terminal we can introduce
two currents of opposite direction, as shown in Fig.1.5a.
Actually, in a two-terminal element we always have i1 = i3 and i2 = i4. This
property, which for now we assume as valid without proof, follows directly from
Kirchhoff’s current law, discussed in Sect.1.5. By virtue of this property, the number
of actual choices for the current reduces to two, identiﬁed as i1 and i2 in Fig.1.5b.
Obviously, we have i1 = −i2. Summing up, the currents and the voltages that can be
measured on a two-terminal element are i1, i2, v1, v2 as shown in Fig.1.5c. However,
in pair (i1, i2) only one current needs to be measured, and in pair (v1, v2) only one
6For a one-terminal element no voltage can be deﬁned, because we need at least two nodes. A
one-terminal electric structure makes sense only when propagation phenomena are present (e.g., an
antenna).

voltage needs to be measured: the remaining variables are obtained from the known
ones through a simple change of sign. Thus the amount of information necessary
and sufﬁcient to characterize the two-terminal element is given by the values of one
voltage and one current. These two variables are the descriptive variables for the
two-terminal element.
We still have one possible choice concerning the relative orientation of current
and voltage. Henceforth, the chosen convention or standard choice (or associated
reference directions) is to assume that they have opposite relative orientations (as the
(v, i) pair shown in Fig.1.6a): this is not mandatory, of course, as well as the choice
of currents and voltages as descriptive variables. But current and voltage, generally
speaking,aretime-dependentvariables,thustheycanchangetheirvalueandtheirsign
with time. Therefore it is usually meaningless to decide a priori the actual reference
directions for voltages and currents. The standard choice sets up a reference scenario
to measure/determine variables without any ambiguity and allows introducing the
component equation and the deﬁnition of electric power absorbed/delivered by the
component.
1.4
Electric Power and Energy
We can now deﬁne a third fundamental variable: electric power.
Absorbed power: For a two-terminal component described by variables taken
according to the standard choice, the absorbed (electric) power is deﬁned as
p(t) = v(t)i(t)
(1.1)

The (derived) SI unit of measurement of power is the watt, whose symbol
is W.7
Notice that, owing to the deﬁnition of electric power given above, 1W = 1V ×
1A. The instrument used to measure the power absorbed by a two-terminal is called
a wattmeter.
The power delivered by the component is the opposite (in sign) of the absorbed
power.
We remark that these deﬁnitions hold only when the variables are taken according
to the standard choice; if this is not the case, before computing a power it is necessary
to change the sign and orientation to one variable to restore the reference scenario.
To clarify this concept, it is useful to resort to a case study.
Case Study
In the example shown in Fig.1.7a, the current i (= 2mA) and the voltage
v (= 1.5V) satisfy the standard choice. Then, the absorbed power is p(t) =
v(t)i(t) = 3mW and the delivered power is ˜p(t) = −3mW. On the contrary,
in the case shown in Fig.1.7b, the current i′ (= 1mA) and the voltage v (= 2V)
do not satisfy the standard choice. Then, before computing any power, we have
torestorethereferencescenario,forexample,byactingonthecurrent,asshown

of the steam engine.

in Fig.1.7c. Then, the absorbed power is p(t) = v(t)(−i′(t)) = −2mW and
the delivered power is ˜p(t) = 2mW.
A strictly related variable is the absorbed (electric) energy, deﬁned as

In other terms, p(t) = dw
dt .
The energy absorbed/delivered by a component can be
• Converted/transformed in another form of energy: For instance, the lamps convert
the electric energy into light and (partially) heat, the heaters into heat and (partially)
light, the air fan and the food processor into mechanical energy, and so on.
• Stored: A device that captures energy produced at one time for use at a later time
is sometimes called an accumulator. For instance, a rechargeable battery stores
readily convertible chemical energy to operate a mobile phone. In other contexts,
a dam stores energy in a reservoir as gravitational potential energy, fossil fuels
store ancient energy derived from sunlight, and food is a form of energy stored in
chemical form.
1.5
Kirchhoff’s Laws
In a circuit made up of N two-terminals we have 2N descriptive variables, that is,
N voltages and N currents. In order to ﬁnd the values of all of them, is it necessary
to measure all of them? We look for an answer by considering the simple example
shown in Fig.1.8, where voltages have been assigned arbitrarily and currents have

Basic Concepts

of N = 7 two-terminals
been deﬁned according to the standard choice. This example is used in the following
subsections to introduce the two Kirchhoff’s laws,8 which are based on the concepts
of loop and cut-set.
1.5.1
Loop and Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law
The word “circuit” recalls a closed path or trip around something (e.g., one circuit of a
planet around the sun). Strictly speaking, an electric circuit is just a set of components
allowing a closed path of voltages: in this sense it is a synonym of loop. (See below.)
In a wide sense, it can denote more complex structures, containing several possible
paths, and is synonymous with electric network.
Loop: A closed path (or surface, more in general) corresponding to a sequence
(with two possible orientations) of n −1 distinct nodes. The nth node must
coincide with the ﬁrst one to close the loop.
Figure1.9 shows (dashed lines) three examples of loops for the circuit of Fig.1.8.
A loop can be oriented either clockwise or counterclockwise, according to a given
criterion or arbitrarily. For instance, Fig.1.10 shows arbitrary orientations for the
loops of Fig.1.9. Henceforth, a loop is usually associated with a speciﬁc orientation.
Following the deﬁnition given in Sect.1.3, the sequence of nodes involved by a loop
is related to a set of voltages. Each voltage of a given loop can be oriented either like
or unlike the loop.
If we measure with a set of voltmeters all the voltages contained in a loop and
sum them by assigning a positive sign to the voltages oriented according to the loop

understandingofelectricalcircuits,spectroscopy,andtheemissionofblack-bodyradiationbyheated
objects.

orientations
and a negative sign to the voltages with opposite orientation, we see that this sum is
identically equal to 0 V .
Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL): In a loop, the sum of the voltages oriented
like the loop is equal to the sum of the voltages with opposite orientation.
For instance, loop A in Fig.1.10 (oriented counterclockwise) involves voltages va
and vc with opposite orientation and voltage vb with the same orientation. Thus the
KVL for this loop states that va + vc = vb. This means that we can measure just two
of these voltages, inasmuch as the third one is not independent of the other two. For
instance, if we measure with a voltmeter va = 3V and vb = 1.5V, we know without
need of further measure that vc = −1.5V. It is evident that the loop orientation is
completely arbitrary, because it does not inﬂuence the relationship between the three
variables.
Similarly, loop B (oriented clockwise) involves voltages vd, vc, v f , and vg with
the same orientation. The KVL for this loop states that vd + vc + v f + vg = 0. Then,
knowing that vc = −1.5V, if we measure with a voltmeter v f = 1V and vg = 2.5V,
the KVL ensures that vd = −2V.

Basic Concepts

cut-sets
To check your comprehension, you can try to:
• Check the validity of KVL for loop C, with the voltage values listed above.
• Find other loops in the circuit and also check the validity of KVL for them.
For a given circuit, a loop not containing any component inside or outside is
called henceforth mesh. The (unique) mesh not containing any outside component
is henceforth called the outer loop, whereas the meshes not containing any inside
component are called inner loops. In the considered example, mesh C is the outer
loop and mesh A is one of the three possible inner loops.
1.5.2
Cut-Set and Kirchhoff’s Current Law
Concepts similar to those introduced in the previous section for voltages hold for
currents.
Cut-set: A set of n distinct terminals crossed by a closed path. If we imagine
that these terminals are cut, the resulting circuit would be made up of two or
more distinct parts.
Figure1.11 shows (dashed lines) three examples of cut-sets for the circuit of
Fig.1.8. For closed paths (henceforth called in turn cut-sets) A and B, one of the two
parts the circuit is made up of after cutting the corresponding terminals comprises
only one node. (See Fig.1.12, panels a and b.) For cut-set C, the circuit resulting
after cutting the involved terminals is made up of three parts. (See Fig.1.12c.)
A cut-set can be oriented either inwards or outwards, according to a given criterion
or arbitrarily. For instance, Fig.1.13 shows arbitrary orientations for the cut-sets of
Fig.1.11.
Following the deﬁnition given in Sect.1.3, the terminals involved by a cut-set are
related to a set of currents. Each current of a given cut-set can be oriented either like or

unlike the cut-set. If we measure with a set of ammeters all the currents contained in
a cut-set and sum them by assigning a positive sign to the currents oriented according
to the cut-set and a negative sign to the currents with opposite orientation, we see
that this sum is identically equal to 0 A.
Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL): In a cut-set, the sum of the currents ﬂowing
into the cut-set is equal to the sum of the currents with opposite orientation.
For instance, cut-set A in Fig.1.13 (oriented outwards) cuts terminals of com-
ponents b-c-e-g and involves currents ib and ic with the same orientation (these
currents ﬂow out of the dashed surface) and currents ie and ig with opposite orien-
tation (these currents ﬂow into the dashed surface). Then, the KCL for this cut-set
states that ib + ic = ie + ig. This means that we can measure just three of these cur-
rents, because the fourth one is not independent of the other three. For instance, if
we measure with an ammeter ib = 2mA, ic = −1.5mA, and ie = 1mA, we know
without need of a further measure that ig = −0.5mA. It is evident that the loop ori-
entation is completely arbitrary, inasmuch as it does not inﬂuence the relationship
between the four variables.

Basic Concepts
Fig. 1.14 KCL for a
two-terminal element
Cut-set B (oriented outwards) simply implies that i f = ig.
A cut-set containing only one node inside is henceforth called a node cut-set. If
we cut the corresponding terminals, the resulting circuit is made up of two parts, one
of which is the node itself. In the considered example, both A (node 5) and B (node
4) are node cut-sets.
Cut-set C (oriented inwards) cuts terminals of components b-c-d-f-g and involves
current ig and id with the same orientation and currents ib, ic, and i f with opposite ori-
entation. The KCL for this cut-set states that ig + id = ib + ic + i f . Then, knowing
(from above) that ib = 2mA, ic = −1.5mA, i f = ig = −0.5mA, the KCL ensures
that id = 0.5mA. Cut-set C is not a node cut-set.
To check your comprehension, you can try to ﬁnd other cut-sets in the circuit and
check the validity of KCL for them also.
Remark As anticipated, KCL justiﬁes the validity of the assumption made in
Sect.1.3 for the currents in a two-terminal element. The cut-set in Fig.1.14 clearly
shows that currents i and i′ are always identical: i = i′.
1.6
Descriptive Variables for n-Terminal Elements
Kirchhoff’s laws allow us to establish how many currents and voltages should be
measured to characterize an n-terminal element (or n-terminal component, or simply
n-terminal). The solution to this problem generalizes the result established for a two-
terminal element.
1.6.1
Descriptive Currents
A generic n-terminal element is represented in Fig.1.15a. Its n nodes are arbitrar-
ily numbered from 0 to n −1. For simplicity, all the currents at the terminals are
assumed entering the boundary surface of the component. The index of each current
is the number of the corresponding node. In the ﬁgure, the boundary surface of the
component is enclosed within the dashed gray cut-set. This cut-set concerns all the
terminal currents, whereby the KCL implies:

(b)
n−1

k=0
ik = 0
(1.3)
and one current can always be expressed in terms of the remaining n −1 currents.
In an n-terminal component, therefore, the currents that must be known are n −1.
They are referred to as the descriptive currents for the component.
As an example, once the currents i1, . . . , in−1 are known (say by measurements),
the i0 current is obtained as
i0 = −
n−1

k=1
ik.
(1.4)
The conventions adopted above are not binding.
For instance, Fig.1.15b shows a four-terminal component in which not all the
currents are entering the boundary surface. The KCL equation can be written as
i0 −i1 −i2 + i3 = 0
(1.5)
and three descriptive currents can be freely selected simply by removing one element
from the set {i0, i1, i2, i3}.
1.6.2
Descriptive Voltages
The easiest way to identify a set of descriptive voltages is represented in Fig.1.16a.
After selecting a reference node (here denoted by the number 0), we deﬁne the
voltages v1, v2, . . . , vn−1 between this node – said common node – and the nodes
1, 2, . . . , n −1. Once these voltages are known, any other voltage between two
nodes of the component may be found through KVL.

(b)
Fig. 1.16 Voltages in an n-terminal element
Fig. 1.17 Voltages in a
ﬁve-terminal element. The
four chosen descriptive
voltages are va, vb, vc, vd
For example, the voltage v32 between nodes 3 and 2 (dashed in Fig.1.16b) is
obtained by observing that it forms a loop with the voltages v3 and v2. For this
loop (dashed gray line) KVL gives v2 + v32 −v3 = 0, so that v32 = v3 −v2. More
generally, each voltage vAB between two nodes A and B (both different from the
common node) forms a loop with the descriptive voltages vA and vB. For this loop,
KVL provides vAB = vA −vB.
The n −1 voltages v1, v2, . . . , vn−1 form a set of descriptive voltages for the n-
terminal component. They meet the requirements of independence (i.e., no pair of
descriptive voltages forms a loop) and completeness (every other voltage between
the nodes of the component can be obtained by means of KVL).
The procedure based on the common node is just one of many to obtain a set
of descriptive voltages. Figure1.17 gives an example for n = 5. Here the set was
obtained by starting with the voltage va between the pair of nodes 0 and 1; the
subsequent voltages were obtained by connecting, each time, a new node to one
already considered. In this way vb,vc,vd are attained in sequence.

1.6 Descriptive Variables for n-Terminal Elements
19
Fig. 1.18 The standard choice for the descriptive variables in an n-terminal component
Whatever the method (including that based on the common node), the number of
descriptive voltages is n −1; the ﬁrst voltage connects the ﬁrst pair of chosen nodes,
and for each of the following only one new node is added.
1.6.3
Descriptive Variables in the Standard Choice
(Associated Reference Directions)
The standard choice for the descriptive variables in an n-terminal component easily
follows from the foregoing considerations. Obviously, it generalizes the correspond-
ing choice given for a two-terminal component.
The n −1 descriptive voltages are chosen referring to a common node. The cor-
responding descriptive currents, all entering the component’s boundary surface, are
obtained by simply discarding the current at the common terminal, as shown in
Fig.1.18.
As a ﬁnal comment, because the common node can be chosen in n different ways,
the number of different standard choices is also n.
1.7
Electric Power in n-Terminal Elements
The use of standard choice for descriptive variables allows the direct calculation of
the power absorbed by an n-terminal component.
To show this, consider, for example, the three-terminal component T shown in
Fig.1.19a together with its descriptive variables. The circuit shown in Fig.1.19b
is obtained by connecting T to the two-terminals A and B. In the ﬁgure, all the
descriptive variables are represented.

terminal (b)
Any lumped circuit as a whole is an isolated physical system; that is, it cannot
exchange power with the outside. This means that the sum of the powers absorbed
by all of its components must be zero. In the present case, then, we can write:
p + vAi A + vBiB = 0
(1.6)
where p denotes the power absorbed by the three-terminal component T and the
remaining terms indicate the power absorbed by A and B, respectively. In the circuit,
the KCLs for the gray cut-sets 1 and 2 imply i A + i1 = 0 and iB + i2 = 0. Moreover,
we have vA = v1 and vB = v2. Taking this into account, from Eq.1.6 we obtain
p = vA(−i A) + vB(−iB)

Therefore, the power absorbed by the three-terminal component T, which must equal
the sum of the powers delivered by A and B, is simply obtained as the sum of the vkik
(k = 1, 2) products of the descriptive variables deﬁned according to the standard
choice.
The extension of this result to the case of a component with any number n of
terminals is entirely obvious.
In terms of standard-choice descriptive variables (Fig.1.18), the power
absorbed by an n-terminal is:

Advanced Concepts
Abstract In this chapter we introduce elements of graph theory, graphs of compo-
nents, matrix formulation of Kirchhoff’s laws, matrix associated spaces, and Telle-
gen’s theorem.
2.1
Basic Elements of Graph Theory
A set of independent Kirchhoff’s laws for a given circuit – the so-called topological
equations – can be automatically found by relying on some concepts of graph theory,
thatis,thestudyofmathematical/geometricalstructures,calledgraphs,usedtomodel
pairwise relations between objects. Graph theory almost certainly began when, in
1735, Leonhard Euler1 solved a popular puzzle about the bridges of the East Prussian
city of Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) [1]. Nowadays, graph theory is largely used
in mathematics, computer science, and network science, but it can be applied in any
context where many units interact in some way, such as the components in a circuit.
Usually, a graph completely neglects the nature of each unit and of the interactions,
just keeping information about their existence.
A graph is a ﬁnite set of N nodes (or vertices or points), together with a set
of L edges (or branches or arcs or lines), each of them connecting a pair of
distinct nodes.
We remark that more than one edge can connect the same pair of nodes. In this
case, these edges are said to be in parallel. This implies that a pair of nodes can be
insufﬁcient to identify an edge univocally. Moreover, the above deﬁnition excludes
the degenerate case of edges connecting one node to itself. Henceforth, we label the
nodes with numbers and the edges with letters/symbols.
1Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) was a Swiss mathematician, physicist, astronomer, logician, and
engineer who made important and inﬂuential discoveries in many branches of mathematics.

(b)
In the simplest case, the edges are not oriented: in this case we have an undirected
graph, an example of which is shown in Fig.2.1a. If the edges are oriented, they are
called arrows (or directed edges or directed arcs or directed lines) and we have a
directed graph or digraph. (See Fig.2.1b.)
Order of a node: Number of edges connecting this node to other nodes.
For instance, in the ﬁgure node 1 has order 2, node 3 order 3, and node 5 order 4.
The speciﬁc shape of a graph is not relevant, according to the following deﬁnition.
Two (directed) graphs G1 and G2 are isomorphic if it is possible to establish
a bijective correspondence between:
• Each node of G1 and each node of G2
• Each edge of G1 and each edge of G2
such that corresponding edges connect (ordered) pairs of corresponding nodes.
Three examples of graphs isomorphic to the one of Fig.2.1b are shown in Fig.2.2.
For ease of comparison, we used the same labels for nodes and edges as in Fig.2.1b;
in this case, the graph is not only isomorphic, but is essentially the same. Any
change in the labels would not affect the equivalences. The graphs shown in Fig.2.3
are in turn isomorphic to the one of Fig.2.1b. Some of the correspondences are
summarized in Table2.1. You can check your comprehension by ﬁnding the missing
correspondences.
Planar graph: A graph that can be embedded in the plane; that is, it can
be drawn on the plane in such a way that all its edges intersect only at their
endpoints.
In other words, any planar graph admits an isomorphic graph where no edges
cross each other. Some examples of planar graphs are shown in Fig.2.4.

Graphs of Components and Circuits
For a circuit, it is quite natural (even if this is not the only possible choice) to associate
the circuit nodes with graph nodes and the descriptive voltages with graph arrows.
By assuming the standard choice, this means that each graph arrow is associated with
a voltage oriented like the arrow and to a current oriented in the opposite direction.
Figure2.6 shows some examples of graphs for multiterminal components.

For instance, the directed graph shown in Fig.2.1b corresponds to the circuit of

2.1.2
Subgraph, Path, Loop, and Cut-Set
In this section we deﬁne some basic graph structures.
Subgraph: A subset of the elements of a given graph, obtained by removing
some edges and/or some nodes together with the corresponding edges.
A subgraph is in turn a graph. For instance, by removing edges a, d, f from the
graph of Fig.2.1a, we obtain a subgraph which is in turn a star graph.
It has been shown [2] that a graph is nonplanar if and only if it is (or contains
a subgraph) a graph isomorphic to the ones shown in Fig.2.7, independently of the
edge orientations.
Path: A subgraph made up of a sequence of k−1 adjacent edges (the orientation
is not relevant) connecting a sequence of k nodes that, by most deﬁnitions, are
all distinct from one another.
In other words, a nondegenerate path is a trail in which all nodes and all edges are
distinct and then we have 2 nodes of order 1 (the ﬁrst and the last) and k −2 nodes of
order 2. Figure2.8 shows some examples of paths (in grey) for the reference graph
of Fig.2.1b.
A graph is connected when there is a path between every pair of nodes. Oth-
erwise it is disconnected.

An example of a disconnected graph is shown in Fig.2.9a.
A connected graph is hinged when it can be partitioned into two subgraphs
connected by one node, called a hinge.
An example of a hinged graph is shown in Fig.2.9b, where the hinge is node 3.
Loop: A subgraph containing only nodes of order 2, or a degenerate path where
the ﬁrst and last nodes are also of order 2, connected by an edge.
Figure2.10 shows some examples of loops for the reference graph of Fig.2.1b.
Mesh: A loop of a planar graph not containing any graph elements either inside
(inner loop) or outside (outer loop).
Figure2.11 shows some examples of meshes for the reference graph of Fig.2.1b.
Cut-set: A set of edges of a graph which, when removed, make the graph
disconnected.

(c)
Fig. 2.11 Examples of meshes (in grey): inner loops (a and b) and outer loop (c)
As stated in Sect.1.5.2, a cut-set can be easily associated with a closed path (or
surface, for nonplanar graphs) crossing the cut-set edges. Actually, for each cut-set
there are two possible closed paths, as shown in the examples of Fig.2.12 for the
reference graph of Fig.2.1b.
Nodal cut-set: A cut-set such that one of the two disconnected parts of the
resulting graph is a single node.
Figure2.13 shows some examples of nodal cut-sets for the reference graph of
Fig.2.1b.
2.1.3
Tree and Cotree
We now deﬁne the two basic graph structures used to ﬁnd matrix formulations of
Kirchhoff’s laws.
Tree: A subgraph containing all the N nodes and N −1 edges of a given graph
and in which any two nodes are connected by exactly one path.

Owing to this deﬁnition, a tree cannot contain any loop.
Cotree: A subgraph associated with a tree, containing all the N nodes and the
L −N + 1 edges of the graph not contained in the tree.
Figure2.14 shows some examples of trees and cotrees for the reference graph of
Fig.2.1b.
2.2
Matrix Formulation of Kirchhoff’s Laws
As stated at the beginning of Sect.2.1, these basic elements of graph theory can
be used to formulate in a compact way (i.e., in matrix form) a set of independent
Kirchhoff’s laws for a given circuit. The goal is to ﬁnd a complete2 set of independent
KVLs and KCLs, which are related to corresponding sets of independent loops and
cut-sets, respectively. A set of independent loops (cut-sets) is also called a basis of
fundamental loops (cut-sets).
2The set is complete if any further KVL or KCL equation is linearly dependent on the equations
belonging to the set.

the reference graph of Fig.2.1b
Fig. 2.15 Tree (thick grey
edges) and cotree (black
edges) for the reference
graph of Fig.2.1b
For planar graphs, the simplest choice for these bases is the set of L −N +
1 arbitrarily chosen meshes (which are independent loops) and the set of N −1
arbitrarily chosen nodal cut-sets (which are independent cut-sets).
For generic graphs, a criterion to identify these bases refers to a tree and the
corresponding cotree. In the following, we use the graph, tree, and cotree shown in
Fig.2.15. Moreover, henceforth Iq denotes the identity matrix of size q (i.e., the q ×q
square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere) and 0q denotes
the null column vector with q elements.
2.2.1
Fundamental Cut-Set Matrix
Each cut-set containing one and only one edge of the chosen tree is part of a
basis of (N −1) fundamental cut-sets. Each fundamental cut-set is oriented (in-
wards/outwards) like the corresponding tree edge and is labeled as Ck, where k
denotes the edge. Figure2.16 shows the basis of fundamental cut-sets for the con-
sidered example and the chosen tree.
Now, we can construct a matrix (of size (N −1) × L), called the fundamental
cut-set matrix, where:
• Each row corresponds to exactly one fundamental cut-set (i.e., to the related tree
edge).
• Each column corresponds to one graph edge. The columns are ordered as follows:
ﬁrst the cotree edges (ordered arbitrarily) and then the tree edges, in the same order

32

Advanced Concepts

fundamental cut-sets for the

as for the rows. In the example, we follow the alphabetical order for both edge
sets.
• Each matrix entry is set to:
0 If the edge on the column does not belong to the fundamental cut-set on the row
1 If the edge on the column belongs to the fundamental cut-set on the row and has
the same orientation
−1 If the edge on the column belongs to the fundamental cut-set on the row and has
the opposite orientation
In the considered example, the fundamental cut-set matrix is as follows.

We call i the column vector of descriptive currents associated with the oriented
edges of the graph and ordered exactly as are the columns of the cut-set matrix A;
that is, i = (ia ic ie ib id i f ig)T . It is easy to check that the rows of A are linearly
independent; that is, the rank of A is N −1. This is a general property, due to the
way the fundamental cut-set matrix is set up and to the fact that each row is related
to one element of a basis of cut-sets.
Of course, the cut-set orientation depends on the choice of the corresponding
closed path (as stated in Sect.2.1.2), but the resulting matrix is invariant, as can be
easily checked.

is a set of N −1 independent KCLs for the circuit associated with the
graph, corresponding to the fundamental cut-sets related to the chosen tree.
For the circuit of Fig.1.8 and for the choice of tree of Fig.2.15, the set of inde-
pendent KCLs is:

(2.3)
Each row of the submatrix α contains information about the composition of the cut-
set which the row refers to: for example, the nonzero elements in the row d of α
indicate that Cd contains (in addition to d) the edges a and c; similarly, the row f of
α indicates that C f contains, in addition to f , the edges a, c, e.
We observe in passing that something similar can be observed for the columns
of α: for example, the nonzero elements of the column a indicate that b, d, f, g are
the tree edges forming a loop with a; similarly, the nonzero elements of the column
c indicate that the tree edges d, f, g form a loop with c. Therefore α also contains
topological information about the loops. This fact has major consequences on the
fundamental loop matrix structure, discussed soon.
2.2.1.1
A Particular Case
For the speciﬁc tree choice shown in Fig.2.17, we obtain the basis composed by
nodal cut-sets only. Notice that the tree in this case is a star subgraph.

the set of independent KCLs is as follows.

This set of equations is completely equivalent to Eq.2.3.
This matrix is strictly related to the so-called incidence matrix.
You can check your comprehension by obtaining Eq.2.4 through linear combina-
tions of Eq.2.3.
2.2.2
Fundamental Loop Matrix
Each loop containing only one edge of a cotree is part of a basis of (L −N + 1)
fundamental loops. Each fundamental loop is oriented as is the corresponding cotree
edge and is labeled as Lk, where k denotes the cotree edge. Figure2.18 shows the
basis of fundamental loops for the considered example and the chosen tree.
Now, we can construct a matrix (of size (L −N +1)× L), called the fundamental
loop matrix, where:
• Each row corresponds to exactly one fundamental loop (i.e., to the related cotree
edge).
• Each column corresponds to one graph edge. The columns are ordered as in matrix
A.
• Each matrix entry is set to:
0 If the edge on the column does not belong to the fundamental loop on the row
1 If the edge on the column belongs to the fundamental loop on the row and has
the same orientation
−1 If the edge on the column belongs to the fundamental loop on the row and has
the opposite orientation

We call v the column vector of descriptive voltages associated with the oriented
edges of the graph and ordered exactly as are the columns of the loop matrix B; that
is, v = (va vc ve vb vd v f vg)T . It is easy to check that the rows of B are linearly
independent; this is a general property, due to the way the fundamental loop matrix
is set up and to the fact that each row is related to one element of a basis of loops.
For this reason, the rank of B is L −N + 1. When, as in this case, the ordering of
the tree edges is the same for the matrices A and B, the elements of A and B are
related very simply: the matrix part complementary to the identity submatrix is α in
A and −αT in B. This follows from the previously observed property concerning the
columns of α; that is, for any column j of α, the tree edges i with αi j ̸= 0 are the
constituents of the loop L j.

Some General Concepts on Vector Spaces and Matrices
A vector space V is a nonempty set of vectors such that, for any two vectors x1 and
x2 of V , any of their linear combinations β1x1 +β2x2 (β1, β2 ∈R) is still an element
of V . The null element 0 is always a vector of V .
The dimension of V , denoted as dim(V ), is the maximum number of linearly
independent vectors in V and must not be confused with the number of components
of the elements of V .
A set of linearly independent vectors in V consisting of dim(V ) vectors is called
a basis for V .
Given p vectors x1, . . . , x p with the same number of components, the set of all
linear combinations 
p
i=1 βixi is a vector space called the span of these vectors. For
instance, the vector space V is the span of dim(V ) linearly independent vectors.
The span of a number of linearly independent vectors lower than dim(V ) generates
a subspace L of V . For instance, Fig.2.20 shows an example for V ≡R3.
The vectors x1 and x2 (as well as all their linear combinations β1x1 + β2x2, with
β1, β2 ∈R) lie in a plane L , which is a two-dimensional subspace of R3 passing
through the origin.

2.2 Matrix Formulation of Kirchhoff’s Laws
37
Fig. 2.20 A
two-dimensional subspace
L in R3
As stated above, it is important not to confuse the dimension of the vector space
(or subspace) with the number of components (the size) of its individual vectors,
because they are not necessarily the same. In the considered example, for instance,
the vectors x1 and x2 have three components, despite their belonging to the two-
dimensional subspace L .
In the following, we introduce some speciﬁc spaces and subspaces associated with
a matrix [3, 4], in order to provide (in the next section) a geometrical interpretation
of the matrix formulation of Kirchhoff’s laws, thus settling the basis for introducing
Tellegen’s theorem.
Let us consider a matrix Q ∈Rm×n. We can write Q in terms of its columns as
Q = (q1 . . . qn). Let x denote any vector in Rn. The vector space
R(Q) =

y ∈Rm : y = Qx, x ∈Rn
is called the range of Q. We can also write, in terms of the column vectors qi,
R(Q) = span (q1, . . . , qn) .
In the general case, the linearly independent columns of Q can be a subset of
{q1, q2, . . . , qn}. It can be shown that the maximum number of linearly indepen-
dent columns of Q and the maximum number of its linearly independent rows are
equal. This common value r is the rank of Q. Then rank(Q) = rank(QT ) = r ≤
min(m, n) and dim(R(Q)) = r.
The set of all solutions to the homogeneous system Qz = 0,
N (Q) =

z ∈Rn : Qz = 0

is called the null space of Q (or kernel of Q).

38

Advanced Concepts
In the same way we can deﬁne the vector spaces associated with the transpose of
Q: R(QT ), N (QT ).
Two m-size vectors wR ∈R(Q) and w0 ∈N (QT ) are always orthogonal;
owing to the deﬁnition of R(Q), there must exist a vector ¯x such that wR = Q ¯x,
thus wT
Rw0 = (Q ¯x)T w0 = ¯xT QT w0
  
0
= 0. An analogous result holds for two n-size
vectors xR ∈R(QT ) and x0 ∈N (Q).
These spaces are the main ingredients of two important results concerning the
decomposition of vectors:
1 Any vector x ∈Rn, the domain space of Q, can be uniquely decomposed as
x = xR + xO, where xO ∈N (Q) and xR ∈R(QT ). Then N (Q) and R(QT )
are complementary and disjoint (N (Q) ∩R(QT ) = ∅, empty set) subspaces of
Rn; that is, Rn is given by the direct sum (⊕) of the two subspaces:
Rn = N (Q) ⊕R(QT ) and n = dim(N (Q)) + r.
The subspace N (Q) is an empty set if and only if r = n.
2 Any vector w ∈Rm, the codomain space of Q, can be uniquely decomposed as
w = wR + wO, where wO ∈N (QT ) and wR ∈R(Q). Then N (QT ) and R(Q)
are complementary and disjoint (N (QT ) ∩R(Q) = ∅) subspaces of Rm; that is,
Rm is given by the direct sum of the two subspaces
Rm = N (QT ) ⊕R(Q) and m = dim(N (QT )) + r.
The subspace N (QT ) is an empty set if and only if r = m.
To exemplify the above concepts, let us consider the matrix
Q =
⎛
⎝
q1
q2
2

⎞
⎠
which has m = 3, n = 2 and rank r = 2. Its column vectors q1, q2 deﬁne the plane
R(Q):
R(Q) = span(q1, q2) = Q
 β1
β2

= β1q1 + β2q2;
β1, β2 ∈R.
Taking as reference the orthogonal directions a1, a2, a3, the vectors q1, q2 are
shown in Fig.2.21. The plane R(Q) intersects the a1a3-plane along the line of q1
and the a2a3-plane along the line of q2.

2.2 Matrix Formulation of Kirchhoff’s Laws
39

matrix Q
Because dim(N (QT )) = m −r = 1, the complementary subspace N (QT ) is a
straight line orthogonal to the plane R(Q). Denoting as p = (p1 p2 p3)T a vector
along this line, we have
QT p =

⇒
2p1 + p3 = 0
p2 + p3 = 0
Then the components p1, p2 can be expressed in terms of p3, that parameterizes
the points of the subspace. The vector p plotted in the ﬁgure corresponds to p3 = −2.
Finally, inasmuch as r = n, we have dim(N (Q)) = 0 (empty subspace) and
R(QT ) = Rn.
2.2.4
The Cut-Set and Loop Matrices and Their Associate
Space Vectors
Consider a directed graph with L edges and N nodes. This graph can be arbitrarily
partitioned into a tree and its cotree. Such a partition leads to the deﬁnition of a cut-set
matrix A and a loop matrix B, as shown in Sects.2.2.1 and 2.2.2. A current vector i
and a voltage vector v, both of size L, are said to be compatible with the graph if they

Advanced Concepts

spaces for compatible
voltage and current vectors
satisfy the KCLs and KVLs, respectively, that is, if Ai = 0 and Bv = 0. Because
the structure of A (where m = N −1 and n = L) is

α|IN−1
	
, from Ai = 0 we have
N −1 independent scalar equations, which represent as many constraints on the L
elements of the vector i. Therefore, due to KCLs, the number of degrees of freedom
for the current elements of a vector i compatible with the graph is L −N + 1.
In terms of vector spaces, Ai = 0 means that i belongs to N (A), the null space
of matrix A, whose dimension is L −N + 1.
Consider now the KVLs Bv = 0, with B =

IL−N+1|−αT 	
(where m = L−N+1
and n = L). The vector v can be partitioned into two subvectors vC and vT , which
contain the L −N + 1 voltages on the cotree edges and the N −1 voltages on the
tree edges, respectively:
v =
 vC
vT

(2.9)
Owing to this partition, the KVLs Bv = 0 can be recast as IL−N+1vC −αT vT = 0;
that is, vC = αT vT . Then, we directly obtain:
v =
vC
vT

=
 αT
IN−1

vT = AT vT .
(2.10)
It follows that each vector v of voltages compatible with the graph can be obtained
through a product AT vT . This means that v ∈R(AT ), whose dimension is N −1. The
values of the N −1 components of the subvector vT can be assigned independently,
therefore the voltage elements of a compatible vector v can be chosen with N −1
degrees of freedom, due to KVLs, which impose L −N + 1 constraints on the L
components of v.
Figure2.22 summarizes all these results and also highlights the roles of the ma-
trices A and AT as operators for the passage between the subspaces of RL and the
space RN−1.

Case Study
Consider the very simple graph (L = 3, N = 2) shown in Fig.2.23a.

the fundamental cut-set matrix A is
A =

(2.11)
Therefore, KCL reduces to a single scalar equation:
i =
⎛
⎝
ib
ic
ia
⎞
⎠;
Ai = −ib −ic + ia = 0
(2.12)
The three components ib, ic, ia of any current vector i compatible with the
graph must fulﬁll the KCL constraint ia = ib+ic, which leads to the expression
for the two-dimensional subspace N (A):
i =
⎛
⎝
ib

ib + ic
⎞
⎠= ib
⎛
⎝

0
1
⎞
⎠+ ic
⎛

⎞
⎠.
(2.13)
In the above expression, the values of ib, ic play the role of span coefﬁcients.
Denoting by b, c, a the orthogonal directions spanning the R3 space as
shown in Fig.2.23b, N (A) is the plane that intersects the plane ic = 0 along
the straight line ia = ib and the plane ib = 0 along the straight line ia = ic.
All the vectors i ∈R3 compatible with the graph lie on the plane N (A).

Advanced Concepts
The voltage vector
v =
⎛
⎝
vb
vc
va
⎞
⎠
(2.14)
can be partitioned according to Eq.2.9; in particular, we have vT = va. With
this in mind, and recalling Eq.2.10, any vector v compatible with the graph
can be obtained as
v = AT vT =
⎛
⎝
−1

⎠va
(2.15)
or, in a more general formulation highlighting the parametric role of the term
va, as
v = pβ;
p =
⎛
⎝
−1
−1
1
⎞
⎠;
β ∈R.
(2.16)
Therefore, any vector v such that Bv = 0 is proportional to the vector p.
It is easy to verify that p is orthogonal to any vector i ∈N (A), as shown
in Fig.2.23c. The way to prove it is based on the observation that, being
ia = ib + ic, we can write i as (ib ic (ib + ic))T and then:
pTi = (−1 −1 1)
⎛
⎝
ib
ic
ib + ic
⎞
⎠= 0.
(2.17)
You can check the correspondence of these results with the general ones
shown in Fig.2.22.
In a similar fashion, denoting by iC and iT the subvectors containing, respectively,
the L −N +1 cotree currents and the N −1 currents through the tree edges, we have
i =
iC
iT

(2.18)
which enables us to recast the KCLs Ai = 0 as αiC +IN−1iT = 0; that is, iT = −αiC.
With this in mind, we obtain
i =
iC
iT

=
 IL−N+1


iC = BTiC.
(2.19)
Therefore,eachcurrentvectori compatiblewiththegraphcanbeobtainedthrough
a product BTiC. This means that the current elements of any compatible vector i can
be chosen with the L−N+1 degrees of freedom representing the size of the subvector

iC; moreover, i ∈R(BT ). Because Bv = 0 means that v belongs to N (B), the space
RL can be thought of as partitioned into the two subspaces R(BT ) and N (B). This
partition is shown in Fig.2.24, which highlights the roles of the matrices B and BT
as operators for the passage between the subspaces of RL and the space RL−N+1.
The properties presented in this section are the basis for Tellegen’s theorem, which

□
Tellegen’s theorem is one of the most general theorems of circuit theory [5]. It
depends only on Kirchhoff’s laws and on the circuit’s topology (graph), and it holds
regardless of the physical nature of the circuit’s components or the waveforms of
voltages and currents, and so on. Therefore the voltages and currents that are used
for Tellegen’s theorem are not necessarily those actually present in a given circuit. By
introducing speciﬁc assumptions about the physical properties of the components,
waveforms and so on, Tellegen’s theorem is the starting point to obtain, usually in a
direct way, various speciﬁc and useful results. In the next chapters we show that for
many circuit properties, the proof that can be given by relying on Tellegen’s theorem
is simpler than others and its range of validity is more clearly demonstrated.

Basic Concepts
The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its
own reason for existing.
A. Einstein
Abstract In Chap.1, we introduced circuit equations (KCL and KVL) related only
to the way the circuit components are connected (the circuit topology). These equa-
tions are completely independent of the components’ nature, that is, of their physical
behavior. In this chapter we begin considering the speciﬁc physical role played by
each component, which is described through the so-called descriptive equation(s).
Then, we introduce the descriptive equations of electrical and electronic two-terminal
components (resistor, voltage and current sources, diode) and deﬁne general com-
ponent characteristics and properties: implicit and explicit representations, linearity,
time-invariance, memory, energy-based classiﬁcation, and reciprocity. Some intro-
ductory examples of circuit analysis are proposed. Then the Thévenin and Norton
equivalent representations of two-terminal resistive components are introduced. The
main connections of two-terminal resistive elements conclude the chapter.

Basic Concepts
The determination of these 2L descriptive variables requires 2L equations, which
are of two types: descriptive equations and topological equations. Solving a circuit
means using at most 2L equations to ﬁnd the value (or the symbolic expression) of
one (or more) of these variables.
The descriptive equations derive from the physical behavior of each component,
that is, from its speciﬁc nature. An nk-terminal component has (nk −1) descriptive
equations that, in general, involve all the 2(nk −1) descriptive variables of the
component itself. For example, any two-terminal component has a single descriptive
equation; a three-terminal component needs two descriptive equations, and so on.
Denoting by v the vector of descriptive voltages: v =

v1 · · · vnk−1
T and by i the
analogous vector of descriptivecurrents:i =

i1 · · · ink−1
T , thedescriptiveequations
can be written in implicit form as
f j(v, i) = 0 ( j = 1, . . . , nk −1).
(3.2)
The term f j represents a (scalar) algebraic function of its arguments, but in other
cases it may contain derivatives or integrals with respect to time. In this chapter, we
introduce only components described by algebraic f j functions.
Because the number of descriptive equations for an nk-terminal is (nk −1), the
total number of these equations in the circuit is L. Therefore, the number of necessary
topological equations also amounts to L. If the circuit has N nodes and L edges, it has
been shown in Sects.2.2.2 and 2.2.1 that the KVLs provide (L −N +1) independent
equations, whereas the KCLs provide the remaining (N −1) ones. Summing up, the
2L equations necessary to solve the circuit are generated according to the diagram of
Fig.3.1: the necessary and sufﬁcient information for the complete study of any circuit,
for half originate from its topological structure (the way in which its components are
connected) and for half by the components’ physical characteristics.

Descriptive Equations of Some Components
Here we introduce the descriptive equations for some largely used components.
3.2.1
Resistor
The resistor is an electrical device (some examples are shown in Fig.3.2a), whose
two-terminal model is shown in Fig.3.2b.
The resistor descriptive equation – also called Ohm’s law –1 is
v(t) = Ri(t)
(3.3)
R is a parameter called (electrical) resistance. The (derived) SI unit of measure-
ment of resistance is the ohm, whose symbol is Ω. According to Ohm’s law, it is
evident that [Ω] = [V/A].
The implicit form of Ohm’s law is f (i, v) = v−Ri = 0. In a physical resistor, the
resistance R is positive and its value depends on many factors, mainly temperature
and age. The resistor model, instead, assumes that R is constant. Moreover, its value
is usually positive, but in some cases it can also be negative, to model more complex
physical devices, as we show later.

1The law was named after the German physicist Georg Simon Ohm (1789–1854), who, in a treatise
published in 1827, presented a slightly more complex equation than the one above to explain his
experimental results about measurements of applied voltage and current through simple electrical
circuits containing wires of various lengths. The above equation is the modern form of Ohm’s law.

The inverse of the resistance G = 1/R is called the conductance. Its (derived) SI
unit of measurement is the siemens, whose symbol is S.2 Of course, [S] = [Ω−1] =
[A/V].
The descriptive equation is linear and homogeneous, therefore it is represented on
the (i, v) plane by a straight line with slope R passing through the origin, as shown
in Fig.3.2c.
3.2.1.1
Limit Cases
For R = 0, the descriptive equation becomes v(t) = 0. In this case, the two-terminal
is called a short circuit and is represented by the model shown in Fig.3.3a. For
G = 0 (i.e., R →∞), the descriptive equation becomes i(t) = 0. In this case,
the two-terminal is called an open circuit and is represented by the model shown in
Fig.3.3b.
3.2.2
Ideal Voltage Source
The (ideal) voltage source (shown in Fig.3.4a) is a two-terminal that imposes a
prescribed voltage, say e(t), between the two nodes.
2The unit is named after Ernst Werner von Siemens (1816–1892), a German inventor and industri-
alist.

3.2 Descriptive Equations of Some Components
53
The voltage source equation is
v(t) = e(t)
(3.4)
e(t) is called the impressed voltage and is measured in volts.
The implicit form of the descriptive equation is f (i, v) = v −e = 0. We remark
that current i does not appear in the equation: this means that its value depends on the
rest of the circuit (and not that its value is 0A, as sometimes supposed by imaginative
students).
The most common expressions for the impressed voltage are two:
• e(t) = E: In this case, the direct current (DC) source, the voltage is constant and
the voltage source models a battery. Of course, a real battery impresses a constant
voltage only for a limited period of time.
• e(t) = E cos(ωt + φ) = E cos(2π Ft + φ): In this case, alternating current (AC)
source, the voltage oscillates in time and the voltage source models an electric
socket. Parameter E is a voltage amplitude (measured in volts), φ is an angle
(expressed in radians), and F is a frequency (measured in s−1 or in hertz3) called
utility frequency, (power) line frequency, or mains frequency. Worldwide, typical
parameter values are F = 50Hz (with amplitudes E ranging from 220 to 240 V)
and F = 60Hz (with amplitudes E ranging from 100 to 127 V).
Inasmuch as the descriptive equation is in general not homogeneous and not
constant, it is represented on the (i, v) plane by a horizontal straight line moving
vertically with time, as shown in Fig.3.4b.
In the limit case e(t) = 0, the voltage source is turned off and is equivalent to a
short circuit.
3.2.3
Ideal Current Source
The (ideal) current source (shown in Fig.3.5a) is a two-terminal that generates a
prescribed current, say a(t).
The current source equation is
i(t) = a(t)
(3.5)
a(t) is called the impressed current and is measured in amperes.
3The (derived) SI unit of measurement of frequency is the hertz (whose symbol is Hz), so named in
honor of Heinrich Rudolf Hertz (1857–1894), the German physicist who ﬁrst conclusively proved
the existence of electromagnetic waves theorized by James Clerk Maxwell (1831–1879).

The implicit form of the descriptive equation is f (i, v) = i −a = 0. We remark
that voltage v does not appear in the equation: this means that its value depends on
the rest of the circuit.
The most common expressions for the impressed current are two: a(t) = A (DC
source) and a(t) = A cos(ωt + φ) = A cos(2π Ft + φ) (AC source).
Because the descriptive equation is in general not homogeneous and not constant,
it is represented on the (v, i) plane by a horizontal straight line moving vertically
with time, as shown in Fig.3.5b.
In the limit case a(t) = 0, the current source is turned off and is equivalent to an
open circuit.
3.2.4
Elementary Circuits
Here we provide ﬁve examples of the analysis of simple circuits. As a general remark
(according to Ockham’s razor), we always aim to solve the circuit by involving the
minimum number of unknowns, in addition to those requested by the problem. This
allows us to reduce the number of equations and unknowns to be handled, thus also
decreasing the sources of errors. Working on the circuit scheme is a great help from
this standpoint. As shown, in most circuits we ﬁnd the ﬁnal solution by handling few
equations.
Remark Another great help to prevent errors is to check the physical dimensions in
the obtained symbolic expressions.

Case Study 1
Find the symbolic expressions and the numerical values for i1, ie, and va
in the circuit shown in Fig. 3.6a, with E = 2V , A = 1m A, R1 = 5kΩ,
R2 = 7kΩ.
Notice that for the current source the descriptive variables are not taken
according to the standard choice. This is not a concern if we are not required
to compute the power absorbed/delivered by this component.
We can start by ﬁnding the variables that can be expressed in terms of the
given unknowns: the voltage on R1 (taken according to the standard choice)
is R1i1 and the voltage on R2 (taken according to the standard choice) is R2 A.
(See Fig.3.6b.) Then, by using the voltage source equation and the KVL for
the left mesh, we have R1i1 = E; that is, i1 = E/R1 = 2/(5 · 103) A = 0.4
mA = 400μ A. By using the voltage source equation and the KVL for the right
mesh, we have va = E + R2 A = [2 + (7 · 103)(1 · 10−3)]V = 9 V. Finally,
by using the KCL at nodal cut-set 1 (Fig.3.6b), we obtain A = i1 + ie; that is,
ie = A −i1 = (1 · 10−3 −0.4 · 10−3) A = 0.6mA = 600μ A.
As an alternative, the same circuit can be solved by introducing all possible
descriptive variables (2L = 8, in this case), as shown in Fig.3.7, and solving
a system of eight equations. (N −1 = 2 KCLs, L −N + 1 = 2 KVLs, and
L = 4 descriptive equations.)
For instance, we can take the two inner loops in Fig.3.7 to ﬁnd the KVLs
v1 = ve and va + v2 = ve. Similarly, we can take the two nodal cut-sets 1
and 2 to ﬁnd the KCLs i1 + ie + ia = 0 and ia = i2. The four descriptive
equations are: v1 = R1i1, v2 = R2i2, ve = E, and ia = −A. (Pay attention
to the current directions!) By solving this system, one ﬁnds all the descriptive
variables, included the requested ones.
The ﬁrst solving method in practice shortens the process of substitution of
the unknowns not requested by the problem. Even for a very simple circuit
such as this, it is evident that managing a set of 2L unknowns can increase the
probability of errors, therefore we recommend once more the introduction of
the minimum number of unknowns, as in the ﬁrst solution.

Find the symbolic expressions and the numerical values for the currents
ﬂowing through the voltage sources and the voltages across the current sources
in the circuit shown in Fig. 3.8, with E = 2V , A = 3m A. Compute the powers
delivered by the current sources and absorbed by the voltage sources.
From the left mesh, we immediately have (KVL) vA = E = 2 V. Then,
the power delivered by the current source A is pA = E A = 2 · 3 10−3
W = 6mW. From the outer loop, we have (KVL) E = v2A + 3E; that is,
v2A = −2E. Thus the power delivered by the current source 2A is p2A =
−v2A 2A = 4E A = 4 · 2 · 3 10−3 W = 24mW. From KCL at node 2,
i3E = 2A = 2 · 3 10−3A = 6 mA and the power absorbed by the voltage
source 3E is p3E = 3Ei3E = 6E A = 6 · 2 · 3 10−3 W = 36mW. From KCL
at node 1, iE + A = 2A; that is, iE = A = 3 mA and the power absorbed by
the voltage source E is pE = E(−iE) = −E A = −2 · 3 10−3 W = −6 mW.

From the right mesh (KVL) and from Ohm’s law, we ﬁnd the values for the
R3 descriptive variables. (See Fig.3.9b.)
We have to compute the power absorbed by the current source, therefore we
introduce as a further unknown the voltage vA and, from the left mesh (KVL)
and from Ohm’s law, we ﬁnd the values for the R1 descriptive variables. (See
Fig.3.9b.) Then, from the KCL at node 1, we ﬁnd the current in R2 and (Ohm’s
law) the voltage across it. (See Fig.3.9b.)

the circuit shown in Fig. 3.10a, with E = 1V , A = 1m A, R = 20kΩ.
Notice that this circuit corresponds in structure to the generic example used
in Sect.1.5.
We can start from the right mesh (KVL) and from Ohm’s law to ﬁnd the
descriptive variables of resistor R in terms of the circuit parameters. (See
Fig.3.10b.)
Then, we can use the nodal KCL at node 3 and Ohm’s law to ﬁnd the
descriptive variables of resistor 3R in terms of both the unknown iE and the
circuit parameters. (See Fig.3.10c.)
Now we can ﬁnd the descriptive variables of resistor 2R by using the KVL

We can start from Ohm’s law to ﬁnd the voltage across resistor R/2. Now,
we cannot go on without introducing a second unknown, that is, one of the
descriptive variables of the other resistors. For instance, we choose the voltage
(say v) across the upper left resistor. Then, we can exploit the KVL for mesh A
and Ohm’s law (twice), as shown in Fig.3.11b. By using the KVL for mesh B,
Ohm’s law, the KCL at node 3, and Ohm’s law again, we ﬁnd the voltages and

large enough values of v, and high resistance for negative or slightly positive values
of v. Panels b and c show two piecewise-linear (PWL) approximations of the original

3.2 Descriptive Equations of Some Components
61
The driving-point (DP) characteristic: for a two-terminal element such as
those deﬁned up to now, is the curve containing all admitted pairs on the plane
(v, i).
For instance, the DP characteristics of a resistor and some alternatives for a diode
are shown in Figs. 3.2c and 3.13, respectively. The asymmetric DP characteristic of
the diode unveils its asymmetric behavior.
Case Study 1
Consider the descriptive equation 3.7 with the PWL characteristic shown in
Fig. 3.13b. Show that this equation can be obtained as the descriptive equation
of the composite two-terminal element shown in Fig. 3.14, where the diode’s
PWL characteristic is that represented in Fig. 3.14 (Eq. 3.8).
The ﬁrst step to obtaining the characteristic is to write the topological equa-
tions:

id = i
v = Ri + vd + VT
.
(3.9)
Then we consider the two regions of the diode’s characteristic, identiﬁed by an
equation (id = 0 or vd = 0) and by an inequality. Henceforth these regions are
called α and β, respectively. (See Fig.3.14) Combining descriptive equations
and topological equations leads to the formulation of the PWL equations in
terms of v and i:
• α region: taking id = 0, Eq.3.9 gives i = 0 and v = vd + VT . This
result holds as long as the inequality vd < 0 is satisﬁed, that is, as long as
v −VT < 0. This corresponds to the ﬁrst line of Eq.3.7.
• β region: taking vd = 0, we have v = Ri + VT . This result holds as long as
id > 0, for which we have id(= i) = (v −VT )/R > 0; that is, v > VT . For
R = 1/g, the second line of Eq.3.7 follows.

Figure 3.15a represents a two-terminal with descriptive variables i and v.
Among the components internal to that element, the diode has the character-
istic shown in the right part of the same ﬁgure. The voltage generator has
E > 0. Under these assumptions, we want to get the two-terminal’s descrip-
tive equation and to represent the corresponding DP characteristic in the (v, i)
plane.
Following the track of Case Study 1, KCL and KVL easily lead us to write
the following two equations, in which the v, i variables appear together with
the descriptive variables of the diode.

vd = E + R2(i −id)
v = R1i + vd
.
(3.10)
• Assuming that the diode is operating in the α region, so that id = 0 and
vd < 0, the previous equations easily give:

E + R2i < 0
v = E + (R1 + R2)i
.
(3.11)
Thus inequality vd < 0 is satisﬁed in the region i < −E/R2 (i.e., v <
−E R1/R2).

Bipolar Junction Transistor
A bipolar junction transistor (or BJT) is a three-terminal device, whose symbol is
shown in Fig.3.16, that exploits two junctions between two semiconductor types
(n-type and p-type) and uses both electron and hole charge carriers. In contrast,
unipolar transistors, such as ﬁeld-effect transistors (or FET), use only one kind of
charge carrier.

Basic Concepts
3.3
General Component Properties
On the basis of its descriptive equations, any component can be classiﬁed according
to some criteria or properties. Here we introduce a set of basic properties.
3.3.1
Linearity
A component is linear if all its descriptive equations are linear and homoge-
neous with respect to the descriptive variables. Otherwise it is nonlinear.
For instance, the resistor is linear, whereas the ideal sources, the diode and the
BJT are nonlinear.
Other examples:
• A two-terminal with descriptive equation i = C dv
dt is linear, because the derivative
(as well as the integral) is a linear operator.
• A three-terminal with descriptive equations

v1 = R(t)i2
i1 = I0cos( v2
V0 ) + αi2
(3.14)
is nonlinear, because at least one of the two equations (the second one) is nonlinear
with respect to at least one descriptive variable. If the second equation were i1 =
I0cos(β) v2
V0 + αi2, the three-terminal would be classiﬁed as linear, because in this
case the term I0
V0 cos(β) plays the role of a mere coefﬁcient.
3.3.2
Time-Invariance
A component is time-invariant if its descriptive equations do not depend on
time. This means that the relationship between the descriptive variables or
their derivatives (or integrals) is always the same, even if the values of the
descriptive variables change in time, of course. Otherwise it is time-varying.
The resistor is time-invariant (remember that R is assumed to be constant) as well
as the diode and the BJT, whereas the ideal sources are time-varying, in general, inas-
much as their descriptive equations contain a time-varying parameter (the impressed
voltage/current).

3.3 General Component Properties
65
Other examples:
• A two-terminal with descriptive equation i = C dv
dt is time-invariant: i and v change
in time, but the relationship between i and dv
dt is always the same, because C is
assumed to be constant.
• The three-terminal with descriptive equations3.14 is time-varying, because at least
one of the two equations (the ﬁrst one) contains an explicit dependence on time
for a parameter (the resistance R).
• A two-terminal with descriptive equation

v = 0 for t < t0
i = 0 for t ≥t0
(3.15)
is time-varying, because the descriptive equation changes with time. In particular,
this two-terminal is called an ideal switch and is closed (short circuit) for t < t0
and open (open circuit) for t ≥t0.
3.3.3
Memory
A component is memoryless or resistive or adynamic if its descriptive equa-
tions involve only the descriptive variables and not their derivatives (or inte-
grals). Otherwise we say that it has memory or is dynamic.
Resistor, ideal sources, diode, and BJT are memoryless components.
Other examples are:
• A two-terminal with descriptive equation i = C dv
dt has memory.
• The three-terminal with descriptive equations3.14 is memoryless, because both
equations are expressed in terms of the descriptive variables only, not involving
their derivatives/integrals.
A circuit containing only linear, time-invariant, memoryless components and
independent sources is called a linear time-invariant resistive circuit.

66

Basic Concepts
3.3.4
Basis
A memoryless component admits the voltage basis (current basis) or is a
voltage-controlled resistor (current-controlled resistor) if its descriptive
equations can be expressed in the explicit form i = f (v) (v = g(i)), where
in general v is the vector of the descriptive voltages and i is the vector of the
descriptive currents.
A two-terminal can admit the voltage basis, the current basis, both bases, or none
of them.
An n-terminal element with n > 2 can also admit mixed bases: this means that
at least an explicit form y = f (x) is admitted, where the n −1 independent
variables x (i.e., the basis) are a mixed set of descriptive voltages and currents.
In other words, it must be possible to assign arbitrarily the vector x and obtain
univocally (through the vector of functions f ) the n −1 variables y. This restricts the
possible combinations because we cannot assign both voltage and current at a given
terminal. For instance, in a three-terminal, it is not possible to impose both v1 and
i1: if we impose v1 with a voltage source, the current i1 depends on the component
equations, and vice versa. (See also the examples below.) Then, for a three-terminal,
the possible mixed bases are (v1, i2) and (i1, v2), whereas (v1, i1) and (v2, i2) cannot
be bases.
For instance, the resistor admits both bases, the ideal voltage source and the short
circuit admit only the current basis, whereas the ideal current source and the open
circuit admit only the voltage basis. The diode with the characteristic of Fig.3.13a
admits both bases, whereas in the PWL case of Fig.3.13b it admits only the voltage
basis and in the case of Fig.3.13c it does not admit any basis. The BJT admits all
possible bases.
Other examples are:
• A three-terminal with descriptive equations

v1 = Ri2
i1 = I0cos( v2
V0 ) + αi2
admits bases (i1, v2) and (v1, v2). (See Fig.3.17.) It does not admit either the mixed
basis (v1, i2), because the two variables are proportional (then it is impossible to
assign both of them arbitrarily), or the current basis (i1, i2), because the cos(·)
function is not bijective and then from the second equation it is not possible to
obtain univocally v2 for a given pair (i1, i2);

bases are not admitted due to the proportionality relationships imposed by the two
descriptive equations.
• A three-terminal with descriptive equations

v1 = 0
i1 = αi2
(3.17)
admits only the mixed basis (i1, v2) (Fig.3.19): any basis containing v1 is not
admitted because (due to the ﬁrst equation) v1 cannot be arbitrarily assigned and
the second equation makes it impossible to assign both currents arbitrarily.

3.3.5
Energetic Behavior
The energetic behavior of a component depends on the expression of the absorbed
power p (for memoryless components) or energy w (for components with memory)
for any possible electrical situation, that is, for any admitted values of the descriptive
variables.
A component is:
• Nonenergic (or inactive) if p(t) = 0 (w(t) = 0) for any electrical situation
• Passive if p(t) ≥0 (w(t) ≥0) for any electrical situation
• Strictly active if p(t) ≤0 (w(t) ≤0) for any electrical situation
• Active if the sign of p(t) (w(t)) depends on the electrical situation
A memoryless component can be said to be dissipative as an alternative to passive.
For a given memoryless two-terminal element, the classiﬁcation is quite easy on
the basis of its DP characteristic: if it lies only on the coordinate axes, the component
is nonenergic; if it lies only on the I–III (II–IV) quadrants, the component is passive
(strictly active); otherwise the component is active.
For instance, the resistor is passive (by assuming R > 0) because the absorbed
power is p(t) = Ri2 = v2/R ≥0 for any electrical situation.
Instead, the ideal sources are active. By considering the voltage source, for
instance, the absorbed power is p(t) = e(t)i(t) (Fig.3.4a): because i(t) depends
on the rest of the circuit, the sign of p(t) depends on the speciﬁc electrical situa-
tion considered and nothing general can be stated. For instance, in Case Study 2 of
Sect.3.2.4, one of the two voltage sources absorbs positive power, whereas the other
absorbs negative power.
The diode is passive, generally speaking, even if in the case of Fig.3.13c it would
be nonenergic.
A resistor with negative resistance (R < 0) is strictly active.
The energetic behavior of components with memory is treated in Volume 2.

3.3.6
Reciprocity
The reciprocity property is encountered in various ﬁelds of physics, such as mechan-
ics, acoustics, and electromagnetism. In broad terms, it concerns the possible
exchange of roles between input and output of a physical system. In the case of
electromagnetism this property was studied, among others, by Maxwell6 [1] and by
Lorentz7 [2]. An example concerning electromagnetic propagation regards the pos-
sibility of swapping the positions of a transmitter and a receiver without altering the
quality of the received signal. The reciprocity property is also present, however, in
circuit theory, where each propagation phenomenon is absent by assumption.
One of the possible ways to begin the discussion about reciprocity within the
circuit domain is to deﬁne this property for a memoryless n-terminal component.
To this aim, we consider the same n-terminal element in two different electrical
situations, for example, two identical components working in two different circuits,
two identical components used in different places in the same circuit, or a single
component working in a circuit but considered at two different times. In the ﬁrst
situation, we measure voltages v′ and currents i′, whereas in the second situation, we
measure voltages v′′ and currents i′′, as shown in Fig.3.20.
We can now introduce the (virtual) cross-powers:
p′(t) = (v′′)Ti′ = (i′)T v′′
(3.18)

of electromagnetic radiation, bringing together for the ﬁrst time electricity, magnetism, and light as
manifestations of the same phenomenon.
7Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (1853–1928) was a Dutch physicist who shared the 1902 Nobel Prize in
Physics with Pieter Zeeman for the discovery and theoretical explanation of the Zeeman effect. He
also derived the transformation equations that settled the basis for the special relativity theory of

Basic Concepts
An n-terminal is said to be reciprocal if p′(t) = p′′(t) for any pair of electrical
situations, that is, for any v′, v′′,i′,i′′ compatible with the n-terminal. Otherwise
it is nonreciprocal.
This deﬁnition may seem abstruse, far from the claims made at the beginning
of this section about the links between an “input” and an “output” properly deﬁned
for the component. To show that this distance is only apparent, we consider a four-
terminal, and assume that it is reciprocal and admits the bases shown in Fig.3.21.
Referring to the ﬁrst admitted basis, we ﬁrst consider the four-terminal in the
two electrical situations described in Fig.3.22a and b. In both circuits, the current of
terminal3issetto0.Intheﬁrstcircuit,weassigntheremainingpair(v1, v2) = (E, 0).
This is done through a voltage source E and a short circuit, as shown in Fig.3.22a.

By equating these terms, as required by the reciprocity assumption, we get i

2,
that is, the current of terminal 1in the second circuit equals that of terminal 2 in the
ﬁrst circuit. In other words, in the circuit of Fig.3.22c, the source E (input) and the
ammeter (output) can be swapped without changes of the ammeter’s measurement.
As a second example, referring now to the second basis, we consider v1 = 0 and
we set (i2, i3) = (0, A) in Fig.3.23a and (i2, i3) = (A, 0) in Fig.3.23b. We obtain
the following two pairs of vectors for the descriptive variables.
v′ =

The reciprocity condition provides v

3. Therefore, in the circuit of Fig.3.23c the
swapping of the current source (input) and the voltmeter (output) does not change
the voltmeter’s measurement.
To check your comprehension, you can refer to the ﬁrst basis and try to obtain the
results when v2 (instead of v1) or i3 are set to zero.
Both previous results bring back the reciprocity to a swapping between a source
and a measuring instrument. We can have a third reciprocity relation that does not
refer to a swapping.
To show this, we refer again to the ﬁrst basis, taking v1 = 0 and working on the
remaining pair of basis variables, v2 and i3. Therefore in the circuit of Fig.3.24a we
set i
′
3 = A and v

2 = 0, whereas in the circuit of Fig.3.24b (identical to Fig.3.22b,
but repeated for clarity) we set i
′′
3 = 0 and v
′′
2 = E. This amounts to having these
two pairs of vectors of descriptive variables:

To check your comprehension, you can try to obtain the analogous result when
v2, instead of v1, is taken ﬁxed to zero.
Coming back to the general case, for the introduced two-terminal elements, we can
check reciprocity by applying the proposed deﬁnition to their constitutive equations.
For instance, a resistor (with 0 < R < ∞) admits both bases. With this in
mind, it is very easy to verify that it is reciprocal. Indeed, for two pairs (v′, i′)
and (v′′, i′′) of values of the resistor’s descriptive variables, we can always write
v′i′′ = Ri′i′′; v′′i′ = Ri′′i′. Thus, p′ = p′′ always.
A diode is nonreciprocal because of its nonlinear DP characteristic. To show this,
we ﬁrst denote by i = f (v) the diode’s descriptive equation in the case of both
Eqs.3.6 and 3.7. Then we observe that, for two assigned voltage values v′ and v′′, we
have i′ = f (v′) and i′′ = f (v′′), respectively. Therefore, because the corresponding
cross-power terms are v′i′′ = v′ f (v′′) and v′′i′ = v′′ f (v′), we conclude that p′ ̸= p′′.
With similar reasoning, you can check that the BJT is also nonreciprocal.
Voltage and current sources are nonreciprocal components as well. A voltage
source e, for instance, admits the current basis, and for two assigned current values
i′ and i′′ (with i′ ̸= i′′), we obviously have v′ = v′′ = e. Thus we conclude that
p′ ̸= p′′.
Remark For dynamic components, reciprocity can be deﬁned by making reference
to virtual works instead of virtual cross-powers.
Finally, we introduce a theorem here that is proved in Sect.6.3.
Theorem 3.1 (Reciprocity theorem) A component consisting of reciprocal elements
only is in turn reciprocal.

ℵby turning off all the independent sources (b)
This is a remarkable result that allows one easily to check the reciprocity of
some composite components. For instance, owing to this theorem, we can immedi-
ately assess that any n-terminal component containing only resistors is reciprocal.
We remark that the theorem provides a sufﬁcient condition only. This means that a
composite n-terminal containing both reciprocal and nonreciprocal components can
be either reciprocal or nonreciprocal: we have to check it through the reciprocity
deﬁnition.

Thévenin and Norton Equivalent Representations
of Two-Terminal Resistive Components
A generic (black box) two-terminal ℵmade up of linear, time-invariant, and memo-
ryless components and independent sources (Fig.3.25a) might admit an equivalent
representation with the same descriptive equation but a simpliﬁed internal struc-
ture, which neglects the detail of all internal variables. This is sometimes called a
macromodel of the two-terminal. There are two possible circuit representations for
macromodels, known as the Thévenin equivalent and Norton equivalent. In practice,
a macromodel is a higher-level model (Sect.1.1) of a portion of circuit.
3.4.1
Thévenin Equivalent
The Thévenin equivalent is shown in Fig.3.26a.8
8The original theorem (commonly known as Thévenin’s theorem) was independently derived in
1853 by the German scientist Hermann von Helmholtz [3] and in 1883 by the French electrical
engineer Léon Charles Thévenin (1857–1926) [4, 5].

74

Basic Concepts
(a)
(b)
Fig. 3.26 Thévenin equivalent (a) and corresponding DP characteristic (b)
The descriptive equation of this two-terminal is
v(t) = eT H(t) + RT Hi(t)
(3.20)
which corresponds to the DP characteristic shown in Fig.3.26b. This equation states
that this representation is admitted by the two-terminal ℵwhen its constitutive equa-
tion can be recast in the explicit form Eq.3.20, that is, if and only if it admits the
current basis.
How do we ﬁnd the two parameters eT H and RT H for the Thévenin equivalent of
ℵ? We have two ways:
1. One can ﬁnd the descriptive equation of ℵ, compare it with Eq.3.20, and obtain
eT H and RT H by comparison. This can be easily done for elementary circuits,
but becomes harder for more complex circuits.
2. Otherwise, one can analyze two simpler two-terminals: the ﬁrst one (say ℵoc)
is obtained from ℵby imposing i = 0 and allows obtaining the open-circuit
voltage eT H (Eq.3.20); the second one (say ℵ0; see Fig.3.25b) is obtained from
the original one by turning off all the independent sources (i.e., by replacing
each voltage source with a short circuit and each current source with an open
circuit) and allows obtaining the Thévenin equivalent resistance as RT H = v
i .
Indeed (Eq.3.20), RT H is the resistance of ℵwhen it is equivalent to a linear
resistor (then passive), that is, when all the independent sources are turned off,
thus ensuring that eT H = 0.
Remark: Equation3.20 holds for the Thévenin equivalent shown in Fig.3.26. If
the voltage source is assumed upside down, there is just a change of sign in Eq.3.20
but we follow the same line of reasoning. This is apparent in Case Study 2 below.

To check your comprehension, you can try to solve Case Study 5 in Sect.3.2.4
by preliminarily ﬁnding the Thévenin equivalent of the composite two-terminal con-
nected to the resistor where the unknown i ﬂows and then by solving the very simple
resulting circuit.
3.4.2
Norton Equivalent
The Norton equivalent is shown in Fig.3.30a.9
9The original theorem (commonly known as Norton’s theorem) was independently derived in 1926
by Siemens and Halske researcher Hans Ferdinand Mayer (1895–1980) [6] and Bell Labs engineer
Edward Lawry Norton (1898–1983) [7].

that this representation is admitted by the two-terminal when its constitutive equation

basis.
How do we ﬁnd the two parameters aN R and RN R? Also in this case, we have a
double key to uncover the Norton equivalent of a given generic two-terminal:

1. One can ﬁnd the descriptive equation of the two-terminal ℵand obtain aN R and
RN R by comparison with Eq.3.21. This can easily be done for elementary circuits,
but becomes harder for more complex circuits.
2. Otherwise, one can analyze two simpler two-terminals: the ﬁrst one (say ℵsc)

3.4.3
Comparisons Between the Two Equivalent Models
It is quite apparent from the proposed examples that when a composite two-terminal
admits both bases (and then both equivalent representations), it is straightforward
to derive one model from the other. For instance, starting from Eq.3.21, one easily
ﬁnds v = −RN R · aN R(t) + RN R · i. By comparing this equation with Eq.3.20, we
identify eT H = −RN R · aN R and RT H = RN R.
Why is there such a large temporal interval (1853 vs. 1926) between the formu-
lations of these seemingly similar equivalent models? The current-source equivalent

80

Basic Concepts
did not occur to early electrical scientists because of the apparent impossibility of
the existence of a current source. Only later did Norton and Mayer realize that the
current-source equivalent was easier to use in certain practical situations.
3.5
Series and Parallel Connections of Two-Terminals
When analyzing a circuit, it is useful to replace some circuit parts whose details
are not under study with others, equivalent but simpler. In other words, once more
we replace some parts with macromodels. The most common structures admitting
simpliﬁcations are series and parallel connections of two-terminals.
3.5.1
Series Connection
As shown in Fig.3.34,
Two two-terminals are connected in series when the same current ﬂows
through them.
The two-terminals a and b share the same current, whereas v = va + vb.
For memoryless components, this connection makes sense if at least one of the
two two-terminals admits the current basis.
3.5.1.1
Examples When both Components Admit the Current Basis
Figure3.35a shows two resistors connected in series. In this case the descriptive
equation of the composite two-terminal is v = (RA + RB)i, which is the descriptive
equation of a resistor with resistance RA + RB. Then, if we are not interested in
determining vA or vB, we can replace this series connection with the single resistor
shown in Fig.3.35b.
Figure3.36a shows two voltage sources connected in series. In this case the
descriptive equation of the composite two-terminal is v = E A −EB, which is the
descriptive equation of a voltage source with impressed voltage E A −EB. Then we

Figure3.37a shows a resistor connected in series with a current source, which does
not admit the current basis. In this case the descriptive equation of the composite
two-terminal is i = −A, which is the descriptive equation of a current source. Then,
if we are not interested in determining vA or vR, we can replace this series connection
with the single current source shown in Fig.3.37b (equivalent model). Notice that the
voltage across the equivalent model is different from the voltage across the original
current source.
Figure3.38a shows a voltage source connected in series with a current source.
The descriptive equation of the composite two-terminal is i = −A, which is the
descriptive equation of a current source with impressed current −A. Then we can
replace this series connection with the single current source shown in Fig.3.38b.

Figure3.40a shows two open circuits connected in series. In this case there is no
way to determine vA and vB. An equivalent model exists anyway. (See Fig.3.40b.)
Finally, a short circuit connected in series with a generic two-terminal is obviously
equivalent to the two-terminal itself.
3.5.2
Parallel Connection
As shown in Fig.3.41,
Two two-terminals are in parallel when they are connected to the same pair
of nodes and they share the same descriptive voltage.

descriptive equation of the composite two-terminal is i = A1 −A2, which is the

Figure3.44a shows a resistor connected in parallel with a voltage source, which does

if we are not interested in determining the currents in the two branches, we can
replace this parallel connection with the single voltage source shown in Fig.3.37b
(equivalent model). Notice that the current in the equivalent model is different from
the current in the original voltage source.
Figure3.45a shows a voltage source connected in parallel with a current source.
The descriptive equation of the composite two-terminal is once more v = E, which
is the descriptive equation of a voltage source with impressed voltage E. Thus also
in this case we can replace this parallel connection with the single voltage source
shown in Fig.3.45b.
In any case, the equivalent model coincides (apart from the current) with the

different voltages is absurd.

also be easily found. As a further step, KCL at node 1 and Ohm’s law provide

Numerical Aspects
When we have two resistors with resistances differing by orders of magnitude,
• If they are connected in series, the whole connection is practically equivalent to
the resistor with the highest resistance value.
• If they are connected in parallel, the whole connection is practically equivalent to
the resistor with the lowest resistance value.
For instance, if we consider two resistors with resistances R1 = 100Ω and R2 =
1MΩ, their series connection is equivalent to a resistor with resistance Rs = R1 +
R2 ≈R2, whereas their parallel connection is equivalent to a resistor with resistance
Rp =
R1R2
R1 + R2
≈R1.
These “rules of thumb” can be easily generalized to the cases with more than two
resistors connected either in series or in parallel.
3.6
Resistive Voltage and Current Dividers
In this section, we introduce two very common circuit structures: the voltage divider
and the current divider.
3.6.1
Resistive Voltage Divider
The resistive voltage divider is shown in Fig.3.51a. We remark that the two resistors
are connected in series. We want to know which fraction of the input voltage e(t)
drops on the output resistor Ro. Because the two resistors are connected in series,
we have i =
e(t)
R + Ro
. Then vo = e(t)
Ro
R + Ro
.
Inasmuch as the current is the same in both resistors and due to the linear descrip-
tive equation of the resistor, this equation simply means that the higher Ro is, the
higher the fraction of e(t) which drops on Ro.

Basic Concepts
3.6.2
Resistive Current Divider
The resistive current divider is shown in Fig.3.51b. We remark that the two resistors
are connected in parallel. We want to know which fraction of the input current a(t)
ﬂows in the output resistor Ro. Because the two resistors are connected in parallel,
we have v = a(t)
RRo
R + Ro
. Then io = a(t)
R
R + Ro
.
Inasmuch as the voltage is the same across both resistors and due to the linear
descriptive equation of the resistor, this equation simply means that the higher Ro is,
the lower the fraction of a(t) which ﬂows in Ro. This is not surprising: the current
tends to privilege the path with minimum resistance! A similar reasoning could be
applied to a liquid ﬂowing in two parallel pipes: the higher quantity of liquid will
ﬂow in the pipe with larger diameter (i.e., lower resistance).

Chapter 4
Advanced Concepts
Abstract In this chapter, we deﬁne the potential functions for two-terminal and
n-terminal resistive elements. Moreover, we introduce some fundamental results
concerning the variational principles for nonlinear resistive circuits.
4.1
Potential Functions
The concept of potential function or dissipative function for resistive elements orig-
inated from an idea of Maxwell [1], who formulated a “minimum heat” theorem
for circuits containing only sources and two-terminal linear resistors. Much later,
the result obtained by Maxwell was generalized by Millar [2] to circuits also con-
taining two-terminal nonlinear resistors. The cited theorems state that voltages and
currents settle to values such that the power dissipated by the resistors is minimum,
as well as the amount of electric power converted to heat by the circuit. More in
general, these values correspond to the stationarity (i.e., points where the gradient
is null) of a suitable scalar potential function (minimum heat or dissipated power)
that generalizes the Rayleigh dissipation function introduced in classical dynamics
[3]. A potential function represents a very succinct description of the circuit and,
as such, can be an important tool for the analysis of a circuit and of its properties.
For instance, the deduction of the values of voltages and currents by a stationarity
principle for a scalar function may suggest (especially in the nonlinear case) more
efﬁcient computational techniques than the classic ones, based on the solution of a
system of algebraic equations. Furthermore, the use of a scalar function to describe
the properties of a circuit can allow relating it to other kinds of physical systems,
at ﬁrst sight far from circuit theory. As an example, natural analogies can be estab-
lished between some basic optimization problems and proper resistive circuits. Some
important applications of these concepts are illustrated in Volume 2.

Content and Cocontent for Two-Terminal Memoryless
Elements
Consider a memoryless two-terminal (henceforth simply called resistor), whose
descriptive equation can be either linear or nonlinear. A nonlinear resistor is rep-
resented by the symbol of Fig.4.1, with the descriptive variables v and i deﬁned
according to the standard choice.
4.2.1
Content Function
If the two-terminal resistor admits the current basis (i.e., it is current-controlled), its
descriptive equation may be expressed in the form v = g(i). (See Sect. 3.3.4.)
The content function G(i) of a current-controlled resistor is
G(i) =
 i
0
g(x)dx
(4.1)
The choice i = 0 for the lower limit of the integral is only customary; a change
in the lower limit implies a new G(i) that differs from the previous one only by a
constant additive term. From deﬁnition Eq. 4.1, we obtain
v = dG
di
(4.2)
whereby the lower limit in the integral Eq. 4.1 does not affect the determination of
the voltage v. The relationship between the characteristic v = g(i) and its content
function G(i) can be represented in the (i, v) plane as shown in Fig.4.2.

4.2 Content and Cocontent for Two-Terminal Memoryless Elements

characteristic v = g(i) and

Notice that there are no restrictions for the energetic behavior of the considered
resistors. For instance, the DP characteristic shown in Fig.4.2 corresponds to an
active two-terminal. Among the elements with content function, therefore, we can
also include the ideal voltage source v(t) = e(t), which admits the current basis
and can be viewed as a time-varying resistive element for the algebraic nature of its
descriptive equation.
Case Study 1: Linear Resistor
For a linear resistor R (Fig.3.2) Ohm’s law (v = Ri = g(i)) gives the con-
tent function G(i) the following expression,
G(i) =
 i
0
Rxdx = 1
2 Ri2
(4.3)
Case Study 2: Nonlinear Resistor
The descriptive equation for the nonlinear resistor whose DP characteristic
is shown in Fig.4.3 is:
v =
 R1i
for i < 0 (branch I)
R2i
for i ≥0 (branch II)
where R1 and R2 are the slopes of the branches I and I I, respectively. The
corresponding content function is

Case Study 3: Ideal Voltage Source
For the ideal voltage source e(t) (Fig.3.4a) the content function is time-
varying, as a direct consequence of the time-dependence of e(t):
G(i, t) =
 i
0
e(t)dx = e(t)i
Here the differential relationship between v and G must be expressed in terms
of a partial derivative:
v = ∂G
∂i = e(t).
4.2.2
Cocontent Function
If the two-terminal resistor admits the voltage basis (i.e., it is voltage-controlled),
its descriptive equation can be formulated in the explicit form i = f (v). (See
Sect.3.3.4.)
The cocontent function G(v) of a voltage-controlled resistor is
G(v) =
 v
0
f (x)dx
(4.4)
from which we immediately have
i = dG
dv .
(4.5)
For the lower limit of the integral Eq. 4.4, considerations completely analogous to
those valid for the content function apply. The relationship between the characteristic
i = f (v) and its cocontent function G(v) is shown in Fig.4.4. Among the elements

basis.

Case Study 3: Ideal Current Source
For the ideal current source a(t) (Fig.3.5a) the cocontent function is time-
varying, as a direct consequence of the time-dependence of a(t):
G(v, t) =
 v
0
a(t)dx = a(t)v
Then the current i is obtained from G through a partial derivative:
i = ∂G
∂v = a(t).
4.2.3
Legendre Transformation
When a two-terminal resistive element admits both the voltage and the current basis,
we can establish an important relationship between the resulting G and G functions.
For this purpose, we represent the DP characteristic on the plane (i, v) and we choose
a point P0 = (i0, v0) on this curve. Taking i0 and v0 as the lower limits for content and
cocontent integrals, respectively, the values assumed by these integrals at a generic
point (ˆi, ˆv) of the DP characteristic can be expressed as follows.
G(ˆi) =
 ˆi
i0
g(i)di =
 ˆi
i0
vdi
(4.8)
G(ˆv) =
 ˆv
v0
f (v)dv =
 ˆv
v0
idv
(4.9)
where f is the inverse function of g. Then we have:
G(ˆi) + G(ˆv) =
 ˆi
i0
vdi +
 ˆv
v0
idv =
 ˆi ˆv
i0v0
d(iv) = ˆi ˆv −i0v0
The terms ˆi ˆv and i0v0 denote the areas of the two rectangles shown in Fig.4.6a.
When P0 is chosen at the intersection of the DP characteristic with either axis, as
usually done (see the comments about the choice of the lower limits in the deﬁnitions
of G and G), we obviously have i0v0 = 0 and
G(ˆi) + G(ˆv) = ˆi ˆv

which is the typical formulation for the Legendre transformation [4, 5]. This means
that, at any instant, the sum of content and cocontent for a resistor equals the total
power absorbed by that resistor in that instant.
It is easy to verify that, in this case, G(ˆi) and G(ˆv) are complementary areas inside
the rectangle with edges ˆi and ˆv, as shown in Fig.4.6b.

Advanced Concepts
The n-terminal’s descriptive equations in the current-controlled case can be writ-
ten as v = g(i), where g is a vector of (n −1) scalar functions. As a generalization
of the result given for a two-terminal element,
The content function for an n-terminal current-controlled resistor is deﬁned
by the integral
G(i) =
 i
0
gT (x)dx
(4.10)
where the function to be integrated is the dot product between the vector of functions
g(x) and the vector of differential terms dx. The value G(i) of the integral must
be independent of the path connecting the points 0 and i; that is, the dot product
gT (x)dx must be the exact differential dG of the content function. In order to fulﬁll
this requirement, it is necessary and sufﬁcient that, for any component gk of the
vector g and for any component i j of the vector i, the following relation holds [6].
∂gk
∂i j
= ∂g j
∂ik
j, k = 1, . . . , n −1.
(4.11)
These constraints on the descriptive equations are known as conditions of local
symmetry [5].
In a completely analogous way,
A voltage-controlled n-terminal element with descriptive equation i = f (v)
(i, v, f are vectors with (n −1) components) for which the conditions of local
symmetry
∂fk
∂v j
= ∂f j
∂vk
j, k = 1, . . . , n −1
(4.12)
are fulﬁlled, admits the cocontent function
G(v) =
 v
0
f T (x)dx.
(4.13)
The cocontent function for the n-terminal element G(v) is independent of the
integration path connecting the points 0 and v.

4.4 Additivity of Potential Functions

4.4
Additivity of Potential Functions
In this section we introduce a remarkable result [5] that settles the basis for the next
sections.
Q Shortcut. The additivity property introduced by the theorem is crucial, but the
proof can be skipped without compromising the comprehension of the next sections.
Theorem 4.1 (Additivity of potential functions) The potential function (content or
cocontent) of a composite resistive element is given by the sum of the potential
functions of its constituents.
Proof The proof is given for the content case. Let us consider a circuit made up
of current-controlled two-terminal resistive elements, including p voltage sources.
The whole circuit can be schematically represented as in Fig.4.8, where the voltage
sources are brought outside a closed boundary, whereas all the remaining circuit
elements are inside the boundary. The pair (vk, ik) denotes the descriptive variables
of the kth resistor (k = 1, . . . , N), deﬁned according to the standard choice. On the
contrary, the voltage sources are described by pairs (e j, i j) ( j = 1, . . . , p), chosen
according to the nonstandard choice.
From Tellegen’s theorem (Sect.2.3) we know that the vector of voltages v =
(e1, . . . , ep, v1, . . . , vN)T and the vector of currentsi = (−i1, . . . , −i p, i1, . . . , iN)T
are orthogonal. Then we have
p

j=1
e ji j =
N

k=1
vkik.
(4.14)
This equation holds for the actual voltages and currents as well as for any set of
voltagesandcurrentscompatiblewiththecircuitgraph.Fortheactualvalues,Eq.4.14
has the obvious meaning of a circuit power balance: the l.h.s. represents the whole
power delivered by the voltage sources and absorbed by the circuit portion inside the
boundary, whereas the r.h.s. is the sum of powers absorbed by the resistive elements
inside the boundary. Taking now a set of compatible currents,
−(i1 + di1), . . . , −(i p + di p), i1 + di1, . . . , iN + diN
Fig. 4.8 Circuit used to

we can write
p

j=1
e j(i j + di j) =
N

k=1
vk(ik + dik).
(4.15)
Therefore, owing to Eq.4.14, we obtain:
p

j=1
e jdi j =
N

k=1
vkdik.
(4.16)
Now we can integrate both members from 0 to i. The r.h.s. integral is the sum of
the contents of the inner resistors. Then, the integral on the l.h.s can be viewed as
the content G of the whole circuit portion inside the boundary. In other words, the
content G of this 2p-terminal is given by the sum of the contents of its elements.
As a ﬁnal observation we recall that (Sect.2.1.1) the descriptive variables for an
(m + 1)-terminal component can be represented through the m branches forming
any of its graphs. When such a component belongs to the circuit portion within the
boundary of Fig.4.8, we can formally replace it with the m branches of its graph, and
we can associate a pair of descriptive variables (ik, vk) with each of these branches.
After this replacement, we can follow the same procedure used to obtain Eq.4.16.
At the r.h.s. of this equation, m terms of the sum lead to the content function of the
(m + 1)-terminal (current-controlled) component. Therefore, the content-additivity
property can be directly extended to the case when parts of the resistive circuit
constituents are current-based multiterminal components.
□
A completely analogous statement can be formulated and proved for the additivity
of the cocontents [5]. These results are part of a set of general results concerning
resistive circuits which are discussed in the next section.
4.5
Kirchhoff’s Laws and Variational Principles
for Potential Functions
In this section the relationships between Kirchhoff’s laws and potential functions is
pointed out by means of two variational principles.
A variational principle is a method for determining the working condition of
a physical system by identifying it as a stationary point (minimum, maximum,
or saddle point) of a function.

4.5 Kirchhoff’s Laws and Variational Principles for Potential Functions
103
For a differentiable function of several real variables, a stationary point is an
input (one value for each variable) where all its partial derivatives are zero (or,
equivalently, the gradient is zero), that is, a point where the function “stops”
increasing or decreasing (hence the name).
We start by introducing the so-called stationary content principle [7].
Theorem 4.2 (Stationary content principle) For a resistive circuit admitting content
function, the actual branch currents of the circuit make the circuit content stationary
with respect to the graph-compatible current variations.
Proof To prove this principle, we consider a circuit composed of m two-terminal
elements (this restriction can be removed by following a line of reasoning similar to
that of the preceding section). We assume that for each of them a content function
can be given. Let vk and ik be the descriptive variables of the kth element, oriented
according to the standard choice, and Gk its content function; the total content G of
the circuit is
G =
m

k=1
Gk(ik).
After partitioning the circuit graph into tree and cotree, the vectors v, i can be orga-
nized into the tree and cotree subvectors vT , vC, iT , iC. Taking into account the struc-
ture of the fundamental cut-set and loop matrices (Eqs.2.1 and 2.5), we have
Ai = (α | I)
iC
iT

= αiC + iT = 0;
Bv =

I | −αT  vC
vT

= vC −αT vT = 0
With this in mind, let us consider the ﬁrst-order variation of G originated by graph-
compatible variations δik (which are not required to be small) of the branch currents:
δG =
m

k=1
∂Gk
∂ik
δik =

k=1
vkδik =

vT
T vT
C
  δiT
δiC

= vT
T δiT + vT
CδiC.
(4.17)
Because the δiC and δiT variations must be compatible with the graph, we have
αδiC + δiT = 0. The substitutions δiT = −αδiC and vT
C = vT
T α into the r.h.s. of
Eq. 4.17 give
δG = vT
T (−αδiC) + vT
T αδiC = 0.
This means that the change of G induced by graph-compatible variations of the
branch currents is null; that is, G is stationary with respect to these variations.
□
As an example, consider the simple circuit shown in Fig.4.9a.
In terms of the
currents iE and i, the total content G of the circuit is EiE + 1
2 Ri2. Following the

theorem proof, therefore we have δG = ∂G
∂iE δiE + ∂G
∂i δi = EδiE + Riδi. However,
because iE = −i, we have δiE = −δi and
δG = (−E + Ri)δi = 0 for i = E
R .
The condition i = E
R follows directly from the KVL applied to the circuit. For this
value of i, then, the content G is stationary with respect to a graph-compatible
variation δi.

An analogous result, the stationary cocontent principle, holds for the circuit
cocontent G:
Theorem 4.3 (Stationary cocontent principle) For a resistive circuit admitting a
cocontent function, the actual branch voltages of the circuit make the circuit cocon-
tent stationary with respect to the graph-compatible voltage variations.
You can check your comprehension by proving this theorem.
The stationarity principles stated above are strictly related to Kirchhoff’s laws.
As shown in the following two case studies, the stationarity of the content function
G implies that the KVLs on the circuit’s fundamental loops are met, whereas the
stationarity of the cocontent function G implies the KCLs’ fulﬁllment on the circuit’s
fundamental cut-sets.

Case Study 1: Stationary Content Principle
We consider the circuit shown in Fig.4.10 together with a possible tree
(in grey) of its oriented graph. The two-terminal R is a linear resistor. The
descriptive equation of the nonlinear resistor is v = g(i). For each branch, the
descriptive variables are taken according to the standard choice.
The content function of the circuit is:
G = e1i1 + e2i2 + 1

R + Gg(i) with Gg(i) =

According to the chosen tree, the subvectors iC, iT are:
iC =

iT =

On this basis, we can write G as a function of the cotree currents only, that
is:
G(iR, i2) = e1(−iR) + e2i2 + 1
2 Ri2
R + Gg(iR −i2).
The variation δG of the content function can be written as
δG = ∂G

and δG = 0, that is, a stationarity
point of G, for any pair (iR, i2) that fulﬁlls the KVL equations, as shown
through the last equations.
As a concluding remark, we observe that the terms e1, e2, R in the expres-
sion of the content function G(iR, i2) play the role of physical parameters.
Any change of these parameters inﬂuences the shape of G and, obviously, the
positions of the stationary points in the plane (iR, i2).

Case Study 2: Stationary Cocontent Principle
We consider the circuit shown in Fig.4.11, where R1 and R2 are linear
resistors. The grey lines in the circuit graph denote the tree. The nonlinear
resistor is voltage-controlled, and its descriptive equation is i = f (v). For each
branch, the descriptive variables are taken according to the standard choice.
Taking as reference the voltages va and v of the tree, the cocontent function
of the circuit can be directly written in the form:

In this section we show that the content function of a circuit deﬁned as in Sect. 4.4
(Fig. 4.8) and containing only resistors with monotonically increasing DP character-
istics has its minimum for the actual current distribution.
Theorem 4.4 In a circuit containing only independent sources and resistors with
monotonically increasing DP characteristics, the stationary point of the function G
for the actual current distribution is a minimum of G.
Q Shortcut. The theorem proof can be skipped without compromising the com-
prehension of the next section.
Proof We denote by vk = fk(ik) the descriptive equation (k = 1, . . . , N) of the kth
resistor, with descriptive variables vk and ik.
This means that, for any two points
P and P0 with coordinates (ik, vk) and (i0
k , v0
k) on the characteristic (Fig.4.12), the
inequality
(vk −v0
k)(ik −i0

(4.19)
holds. Taking P0 ﬁxed and provisionally choosing for P the coordinates ik = i0

Owing to the assumed resistors’ characteristics, an inequality of this kind can be
written for each of the N resistors within the boundary of Fig.4.8. Each of them has
its own reference point (i0

With the aim of applying Tellegen’s theorem to the circuit, we ﬁrst consider the actual
voltages and currents in the circuit, say i0
k , v0
k for the kth resistor (k = 1, . . . , N),
without loss of generality. According to Fig.4.8, the actual voltages and currents are:
e1 · · · ep v0
1 · · · v0
N
−i0
1 · · · −i0p i0
1 · · · i0
N.
Then we consider a second set of currents, not measured on the circuit but compatible
with its graph (i.e., they obey KCLs):
−i1 · · · −i p i1 · · · iN.
We can now apply Tellegen’s theorem (Sect. 2.3) taking the set of actual voltages
and the set of currents obtained by subtracting the current elements of the ﬁrst set
from those of the second:
p

e j(i j −i0

This inequality shows that, under variations of the currents ik, the r.h.s. is minimum
for the actual current distribution [5].

P(i1, i2) and for the KCL constraint on i1, i2
This result includes, as a special case, the minimum heat theorem due to Maxwell,
described in the next section.
4.7
Minimum Heat Theorem
In the special case when all resistors are linear, their content and cocontent functions
coincide with the dissipated power and the previously discussed stationary principles
become equivalent to the minimum heat theorem formulated by Maxwell.
Theorem 4.5 (Minimum heat theorem) In a circuit composed of linear passive
resistors and sources, the currents are such that the dissipated power is minimum.
Although this result can now be considered as a special case of the stationary
principles discussed in the previous sections, it is worth considering a simple case
study to show how the problem of determining the currents in a circuit of this kind
can be reformulated as a minimization problem.
Case Study
We consider the circuit shown in Fig.4.13a, which is a resistive current
divider, as discussed in Sect.3.6.2. The power P absorbed (i.e., dissipated) by
the linear resistors R1 and R2 is
P(i1, i2) = R1i2
1 + R2i2
2
At the same time, the resistor currents i1 and i2 are subject to a constraint
imposed by the KCL, namely:
a −i1 −i2 = 0.
(4.23)

Advanced Concepts
The minimum of P must be sought under this constraint. Indicating with λ
a Lagrange multiplier, therefore, we consider the function:
F(i1, i2; λ) = P −λ(a −i1 −i2).
Both P and the KCL constraint have a simple geometric interpretation, shown
in Fig.4.13b. The minimum of P is the minimum of the curve intersection
between the surface P(i1, i2) and the vertical plane a −i1 −i2 = 0. Setting
to zero the partial derivatives of F with respect to the variables i1 and i2
(stationary condition), we obtain
 ∂F
∂i1 = 2R1i1 + λ = 0
∂F
∂i2 = 2R2i2 + λ = 0
⇒λ = −2R1i1 = −2R2i2
which implies R1i1 = R2i2. Owing to both this result and the constraint
Eq. 4.23, the minimum value of the power P occurs at the point with
coordinates
i1 =
aR2
R1 + R2
;
i2 = R1
R2
i1 =
aR1
R1 + R2
.
Note that the products R1i1 = R2i2 are nothing but the voltage v on R1 and
R2.

Memoryless Multi-ports: Descriptive

Abstract This chapter is focused on the concept of “port”. Generic n-port compo-
nents are introduced and linear, time-invariant, memoryless two-ports are deﬁned
and characterized through matrices, properties, and connections. The two-port com-
ponents introduced in this chapter model real devices widely used in practical appli-
cations.
5.1
Port and n-Ports
As shown in Chap.1, in a two-terminal element the KCL imposes a constraint on the
currents ﬂowing in the terminals. This is the basis to deﬁne the concept of port.
Port: A pair of accessible terminals of a circuit that meet the so-called port
condition; that is, they behave as for a two-terminal.
A black-box composite two-terminal, containing various components properly
connected, is a one-port element (Fig.5.1a). For instance, an appliance is a one-port
element whose port is the plug.
Many common electronic devices and circuit blocks, such as transformers, elec-
tronic ﬁlters, and ampliﬁers have terminals that are naturally associated in pairs,
each meeting the port condition. A component with 2n terminals associated in pairs
is called an n-port and each port (owing to the port condition) needs as descriptive

Fig. 5.1 One-port (a), two-port (b), and n-port (c) with standard choice of descriptive variables
variables one voltage and one current. Then, an n-port needs n port voltages and n
port currents to be completely characterized. This also implies that the number of
descriptive equations necessary to characterize an n-port is n. The standard choice
for each port is the same as for a two-terminal, as shown in Fig.5.1c. We notice that,
if the component were viewed as a 2n-terminal, it would require (2n −1) descriptive
voltages and as many descriptive currents. The restriction imposed by the concept of
port introduces n independent constraints on the 2n terminal currents and allows ne-
glecting the voltages corresponding to pairs of terminals belonging to different ports
because they can remain undetermined without any consequence on the component’s
electrical behavior.
As shown in Sect.3.4, a speciﬁc class of composite two-terminals/one-ports might
admit a Thévenin or Norton equivalent representation. As for a composite two-
terminal, we can deﬁne macromodels describing an n-port with descriptive equations
expressed in terms of the port variables, as we show in Chap.8. This allows us to
reduce the complexity of circuit analysis, inasmuch as the n-port is regarded once
more as a black- box connected to the outside world through its ports, which are often
points where input signals are applied, output signals taken, or just contact points
allowing the exchange of electrical energy. The port variables are the only variables
to be considered in determining the n-port’s response to applied signals. Of course,
the knowledge of the neglected voltages is not necessary to determine the n-port’s
behavior.
In terms of standard-choice descriptive variables (Fig.5.1c), the power ab-
sorbed by an n-port is the sum of the powers absorbed by each port; that
is:
p(t) =
n

(5.1)
Note for the readers who are aware of graphs (Sect.2.1): The graph of an n-port
is disconnected and is made up of the 2n nodes of the n-port and the n directed edges
corresponding to the port voltages.

5.1 Port and n-Ports
115
A memoryless n-port can admit the voltage basis (voltage-controlled n-port), the
current basis (current-controlled n-port), or mixed bases, containing in any case one
variable per port, because it is not possible to impose both voltage and current on the
same port.
Two-ports (an example is shown in Fig.5.1b) are the most widely used multiport
elements. When both port voltages are referred to the same node (i.e., the lower
terminals are connected by a short circuit), the two-port can be represented as a
three-terminal. The possible bases for memoryless two-ports are: (i1, i2), (v1, v2),
(v1, i2), (i1, v2).
5.2
Descriptive Equations of Some Two-Ports
Here we introduce the descriptive equations for some two-ports largely used to model
electronic components and in particular ampliﬁers. An ampliﬁer (from the Latin
ampliﬁcare, “to enlarge or expand”) is an electronic device that can increase the
power of a signal by taking energy from a power supply and controlling the output
to match the input signal shape but with a larger amplitude. In the next subsections
we deﬁne a class of two-ports called controlled sources and the so-called nullor.
5.2.1
Controlled Sources
A controlled source (or dependent source) is a voltage or current source (port 2)
whose value depends on a voltage or current somewhere else in the circuit (port 1).
Port 1 is also called the driving port and port 2 the driven port.
Controlled sources are models of commonly used electronic components, simple
or composite. Practical circuit elements have properties such as ﬁnite power capacity,
voltage, current, or frequency limits that mean a model is valid only under speciﬁc
assumptions.
The four possible types of linear controlled sources are deﬁned in the follow-
ing sections. All of them are time-invariant, memoryless, nonreciprocal, and active
components. Dependent sources are not necessarily linear, as shown in Sect.5.2.1.5.
5.2.1.1
Current-Controlled Current Source (CCCS)
The current-controlled current source (CCCS) is a two-port (shown in Fig.5.2) often
used to model current ampliﬁers and BJTs.1
1In the BJT case, the two ports share the same reference as for the port voltages, according to the
three-terminal nature of this component.

Basic Concepts
Fig. 5.2 Current-controlled current source (CCCS)
Fig. 5.3 Case Study for CCCS (left circuit) and detail (within the dotted curve on the right) showing
the driving port of the CCCS
The CCCS descriptive equations are:
v1(t) = 0
i2(t) = αi1(t)
(5.2)
α is a dimensionless parameter called the gain, which can be positive or negative
(if α = 0 the port 2 of the CCCS degenerates to an open circuit), and i1(t) is called
the driving current. Usually, |α| > 1, at least when modeling ampliﬁers.
From the descriptive equations, it is apparent that the only admitted basis is the
mixed basis (i1, v2).
The absorbed power is p(t) = v1i1 + v2i2 = v2i2 = αi1v2. Because we cannot
say anything a priori about the sign of this power, this two-port is active. It can easily
be checked that it is nonreciprocal.
Remark: The port 1 of the CCCS (as well as of the other current-controlled
source, the CCVS) is usually “hidden” in the circuit. It is just the terminal through
which the driving current ﬂows, as shown in Fig.5.3. (See the detail on the right
side.)

As usual, we start by ﬁnding the variables that can be expressed in terms of
the given unknowns, that is, v (problem target) and i3 (driving variable): the
voltage on R1 (Fig.5.4a) is E −v (KVL for mesh A) and the voltage on R3
(taken according to the standard choice) is R3i3 (Ohm’s law). Then, we obtain
the current in R1 (Ohm’s law) and, by using the KCL for cut-set 1, we ﬁnd
v = E + R1(α −1)i3.
By using KVL for mesh B, Ohm’s law, and KCL for cut-set 2 (Fig.5.4b),
we ﬁnd v = (R2 + R3)i3 −R2 A. Finally, by solving the two equations, we
ﬁnd v = E + R1(α −1)

The CCVS descriptive equations are:

(5.3)
r is the CCVS gain or transresistance (with physical dimension of Ω), which
can be positive or negative (if r = 0 the port 2 of the CCVS degenerates to a short
circuit), and i1(t) is the driving current.
From the descriptive equations, it is apparent that the only admitted basis is the
current basis (i1, i2). Moreover, you can easily check that this two-port is also active
and nonreciprocal.

Find the symbolic expression and the numerical value of the current iE in the
circuit shown in Fig. 5.6, with E = 5 V, A = 5 mA, R = 200Ω, r = 400Ω.
Also ﬁnd the numerical value of the power absorbed by the current source.
The problem unknowns are iE (problem target) and i (driving variable):
the voltage on 2R (Fig.5.7) is 2RiE (Ohm’s law) and the voltage on R (taken
according to the standard choice) is Ri (Ohm’s law). Then, by using the KCL
for cut-set 1, we ﬁnd iE = A + i and, through KVL for the outer loop, we
obtain (R + r)i + 2RiE = E.
By solving these two equations, we ﬁnd iE = E + (R + r)A
3R + r
= 8 mA.
The power absorbed by the current source is p = A· Ri = RA(iE −A) = 3

i1(t) = 0
v2(t) = βv1(t)
(5.4)
β is the VCVS dimensionless gain, which can be positive or negative (if β = 0
the port 2 of the VCVS degenerates to a short circuit) and v1(t) is the driving voltage.
Usually, |β| > 1, at least when modeling ampliﬁers.
From the descriptive equations, it is apparent that the only admitted basis is the
mixed basis (v1, i2). Moreover, you can easily check that this two-port is also active
and nonreciprocal.
Remark: Port 1 of the VCVS (as well as of the other voltage-controlled source,
the VCCS) is just the pair of nodes across which the driving voltage is taken, as
shown on the right side of Fig.5.9.

As usual, we start by ﬁnding the variables that can be expressed in terms

three unknowns:

(KVL for the right inner loop)
E + RiE = vA
(KVL for the left inner loop)
iE + A + 1−α

The voltage-controlled current source (VCCS) is the two-port shown in Fig.5.11.
The VCCS descriptive equations are:
i1(t) = 0
i2(t) = gv1(t)
(5.5)
g is the VCCS gain or transconductance (with the physical dimension of Ω−1)
and v1(t) is the driving voltage.

From the descriptive equations, it is apparent that the only admitted basis is the
voltage basis (v1, v2). Moreover, you can easily check that this two-port is also active
and nonreciprocal.
5.2.1.5
Nonlinear Controlled Sources
As stated above, dependent sources are not necessarily linear. However, a nonlinear
controlled source can be easily obtained by properly combining a linear controlled
source and a nonlinear resistor. For instance, a nonlinear CCVS with an equation of
the driven port v2 = f (i1), with f nonlinear function, can be obtained as shown in
Fig.5.12, by combining a linear VCVS and a nonlinear resistor admitting the current
basis and described by the equation v = ˜f (i) (where ˜f (·) = f (·)
β ).
Indeed, v2 = βv1 = β ˜f (i1) = f (i1).
Similar considerations hold, mutatis mutandis, for any other nonlinear controlled
source.

The nullor descriptive equations are:

(5.6)
These apparently strange equations – that assign both variables at port 1, also
called the input port, and leave completely free both variables at port 2, also called
the output port – actually summarize the limit behavior of a linear VCVS inside a
linear circuit.
In order to show this, we consider the introductory circuit shown in Fig.5.14. The
input port (terminals A and B) of the VCVS draws no current. For any ﬁnite value
of the voltage gain parameter β, we easily obtain the expressions for the voltages v
and vo:

For β values large enough to satisfy the inequality (β +1) R1
R2 ≫1, the ﬁrst of Eq. 5.7
gives |v| ≪|vi|. This means that, in the KVL vi + vR + v = 0 (loop L), |v| becomes
negligible with respect to |vi| and |vR|. Moreover, large values of β strongly simplify
the vo expression:

You can consider a realistic numerical case taking β = 105 and R1
R2 = 10−2. For
these values, v ≃−10−3vi and vo ≃−102vi = −R2
R1 vi.
Summing up, for β →∞the voltage and current at the input terminals A, B of
the VCVS are zero. (Recall the nullor equations!) Moreover, vo is proportional to

vi through the coefﬁcient −R2

, which depends only on components external to the
VCVS.
This is just the circuit solution obtained by replacing the VCVS with a nullor, as
in Case Study 1.
Case Study 1
Find the symbolic expressions of the voltage vo in the circuit shown in
Fig. 5.15.
We start by exploiting the nullor descriptive equations: the voltage on R1
(Fig.5.15) is vi (KVL for mesh L) and the current in R1 (Ohm’s law) and R2
(KCL for node 1) is vi/R1. Then, we obtain the voltage across R2 (Ohm’s law)
and, by using the KVL for the outer loop, we ﬁnd vo = −R2
R1 vi.
In a linear circuit, then, the nullor models the VCVS behavior when its voltage
gain becomes inﬁnite. The nullor’s symbol recalls the descriptive equations. On
port 1 we have a degenerate two-terminal, called the nullator, described by Eq.5.6.
On port 2 we have another degenerate two-terminal, called the norator, with no
descriptive equations. This means that the descriptive variables on the output port
are determined by the rest of the circuit, because the nullor does not impose any
constraint on them. Even if made up of two degenerate two-terminals, the nullor
is not degenerate, because, in some sense, the anomalies of nullator and norator
compensate each other. You can easily check that the nullor is a time-invariant,
memoryless, active, nonreciprocal two-port.
The replacement of the VCVS with a nullor is commonly adopted as a good
approximation for analyzing or designing electronic circuits containing operational
ampliﬁers. An operational ampliﬁer (op-amp) is shown in Fig.5.16a, where +VS and
−VS denote the positive and negative power supply, respectively. An op-amp is an
ampliﬁer circuit with very high ratio (on the order of hundreds of thousands of times)
between the magnitude of output (v2) and input (v1) voltages. Though the term today
commonly applies to integrated circuits, the original op-amp design used valves, and
later designs used discrete transistor circuits. The labels “+” and “−” at the input

(noninverting ampliﬁer)
play an important role to ensure the stability of the overall circuit (a concept that is
developed in Volume 2). The op-amp circuit corresponding to Fig.5.15 is shown in
Fig.5.16b.
The apparently strange equations of the nullor actually summarize the two “golden
rules” describing an ideal op-amp. The ﬁrst rule only applies in the case (known as
closed-loop with negative feedback conﬁguration) where there is a signal path of
some sort feeding back from the output to the inverting input, labeled by a “−”
in Fig.5.16b. This rule states that in this conﬁguration the output attempts to do
whatever is necessary to make the voltage v1 zero. The second rule states that the
input terminals draw no current (assumption of inﬁnite input impedance). These rules
are commonly used as a good ﬁrst approximation for analyzing or designing op-amp
circuits, thus the nullor (which implements these rules) is a commonly used model.
Case Study 2
Find the symbolic expressions of the voltage vo in the circuit shown in
Fig. 5.17.
We start once more by exploiting the nullor descriptive equations: the volt-
age on R1 (Fig.5.18) is vi (KVL for mesh A) and the current in R1 (Ohm’s
law) and R2 (KCL for node 1) is vi/R1. Then, we obtain the voltage across R2
(Ohm’s law) and, by using the KVL for loop B, we ﬁnd vo =

We start once more by exploiting the nullor descriptive equations: the cur-
rent in R1 (Fig.5.20) is i (KCL for nodal cut-set 1) and the voltage across
R0 (KVL for loop A) is v. Moreover the voltage across R2 (KVL for loop
B) is R1i. Then, by using the KCL for nodal cut-set 2, we ﬁnd v = −R0 R1
R2 i,
which is the equation of a resistor with negative resistance, that is, a strictly
active two-terminal. This possibility was anticipated in Sect.3.2.1. This exam-
ple shows a possible network realization of this apparently “strange” resistor
using a composite two-terminal with an active component.

In the following, the indices of the matrix elements refer, as usual, to rows and
columns, not necessarily to the port number. Moreover, whenever there is no am-
biguity, the matrices are simply denoted by a capital letter (e.g., R). Otherwise, the
letter is inserted between brackets (e.g., (R) or [R]).
In Sect.8.4 these descriptions are generalized to the nonhomogeneous (and then
nonlinear) case. In Volume 2 a further generalization to circuits with memory is
introduced.
5.3.1
Resistance Matrix
If the two-port admits the current basis, we can describe it through the resistance
matrix:
 v1
v2

= R
i1
i2

=
 R11 R12
R21 R22
 i1

Each matrix entry is a resistance that can be algebraically obtained as
R11 = v1
i1

i2=0

R12 = v1

R21 = v2
i1

i2=0
;
R22 = v2
i2

i1=0
(5.11)
From a circuit perspective, this means that when port 2 of the composite two-port
is left open (i2 = 0; Fig.5.21a), R11 can be obtained as the ratio between port-1
voltage v1 (measured) and current i1 (imposed), and R21 as the ratio between v2
(measured) and i1 (imposed). When port 1 is left open (i1 = 0; Fig.5.21b), we can
similarly obtain R12 and R22.
For instance, the resistance matrix for the CCVS is (from Eqs.5.3)

that is, R11 = R1 + R3 = 150Ω and R21 = R3 = 50Ω. The case with i1 = 0
is shown in Fig.5.23c, from which we ﬁnd v1 = R3i2 and v2 = (R2 + R3)i2;
that is, R12 = R3 = 50Ω and R22 = R2 + R3 = 80Ω.

Conductance Matrix
If the two-port admits the voltage basis, we can describe it through the conductance
matrix:

Each matrix entry is a conductance that can be algebraically obtained:

From a circuit perspective, this means that when port 2 of the composite two-port
is short-circuited (v2 = 0; Fig.5.24a), G11 can be obtained as the ratio between
port-1 current i1 (measured) and voltage v1 (imposed), and G21 as the ratio between
i2 (measured) and v1 (imposed). When port 1 is short-circuited (v1 = 0; Fig.5.24b),
we can similarly obtain G12 and G22.
For instance, the conductance matrix for the VCCS is (from Eq.5.5):

5.3.3
Hybrid Matrices
If the two-port admits the mixed basis (i1, v2), we can describe it through the ﬁrst
hybrid matrix:
v1
i2

= H
 i1
v2

=
 H11 H12

Ω, H22 of Ω−1, whereas H12 and H21 are dimensionless) and can be algebraically
obtained as
H11 = v1


v2=0

H21 = i2

H22 = i2

(5.18)
From a circuit perspective, the matrix entries can be computed by applying a
method completely similar to the one described for matrices
R and G,
mutatis mutandis.
For instance, the H matrix for the CCCS is (from Eq.5.2) H =
 0 0
α 0

.
Completely analogous considerations hold for the second hybrid matrix, which
exists if the two-port admits the other mixed basis (v1, i2):

Of course, if the two-port admits both the mixed bases, H
′ = H −1.
You can check your comprehension by ﬁnding the hybrid matrices for the com-
posite two-port shown in Fig.5.22.
5.3.4
Transmission Matrices
Differently from the previous representations, each related to a basis, in the two
representations described in this section the independent variables of Eq.5.9 are
taken both on the same port. If the “input” variables are those on the second port,2
we can describe the two-port through the forward transmission matrix:
v1
i1

= T
 v2
−i2

=
 T11 T12
T21 T22
  v2
−i2

(5.20)
whose elements have hybrid physical dimensions (T11 and T22 are dimensionless,
T12 has physical dimension of Ω, T21 of Ω−1), and can be algebraically obtained as
follows.
T11 = v1


i2=0

T12 = −v1

T21 = i1
v2

i2=0
;
T22 = −i1
i2

v2=0
(5.21)
For instance, the T matrix for the four controlled sources are: TCCCS =
0 0
0 −1


,
TCCV S =
 0 0


, TVCV S =


, TVCCS =
0 −1
g


.
From a circuit perspective, the matrix entries cannot be computed directly as for
the other matrices, inasmuch as we cannot impose both voltage and current on port 2.
But the inverse of each entry can be computed also in the circuit, provided that this is
compatible with the descriptive equations (i.e., provided that KCL and KVL are not
violated): with this caveat, for instance, 1
T11

i2=0
can be computed (Fig.5.25a)
2We remark that in this case the term “input” is intended only to refer to their position in the
mathematical expression because it is physically infeasible assigning both voltage and current on
the same port. This is the reason for using the quotation marks around the word input.

other entries can be computed by following the same line of reasoning, as shown in
Fig.5.25. As a counterexample, in a current-controlled source (Figs.5.2 and 5.5) we
could not impose the voltage v1 because the driving port is a short circuit, thus we
could not compute T11 in this way.

Generalizations to Higher Numbers of Ports
The representations deﬁned in the previous subsections can be easily generalized for
linear, time-invariant, memoryless n-ports with n > 2. In this case, each matrix size
is n × n.

v1 = Ri2 −Ri3
v2 = −Ri1 + Ri3

To evaluate its energetic behavior, we compute the absorbed power: p =

Ri2i1 −Ri3i1 −Ri1i2 + Ri3i2 + Ri1i3 −Ri2i3 = 0. Then the three-port is
nonenergic.
The voltage basis is admitted if and only if the conductance matrix is admit-
ted, which means that the resistance matrix must be invertible. The determinant
of matrix [R] is det([R]) = −R(−R2) −RR2 = 0; thus matrix [R] is not
invertible and the voltage basis is not admitted.

Reciprocity of Two-Ports
The reciprocity of a two-port belonging to the class considered in the previous section
can be simply assessed in terms of its matrix-based descriptions, if any.

Remarks and Examples
We remark that to assess the reciprocity of a given two-port it is sufﬁcient to check
the reciprocity condition(s) for one of the admitted matrices. All the conditions are
summarized in Sect. A.3 in the appendix.
The two-port analyzed in the Case Study of Sect. 5.3.1 is reciprocal, because
R12 = R21.
The controlled sources are not reciprocal, because in all cases det(T ) = 0. For
each controlled source, you can also check this property by looking at its other
admitted matrix.
Case Study 1
Given the two-port shown in Fig. 5.26, ﬁnd its matrix T and the value of
the gain g (if any) ensuring reciprocity.
We can start by expressing the driving variables in terms of port variables:
i = v2
2R and v = Ri1. Then, we ﬁnd v1 = Ri1 −3R v2
2R + v2 (KVL for the
outer loop) and i1 + gRi1 + i2 = v2
2R ; that is, i1(1 + gR) = v2
2R −i2. After
a few algebraic manipulations, we obtain i1 =

det(R) = 0, which implies R2
R3
(1−α) = 0. Inasmuch as α ̸= 1 this condition
holds for R2 = 0.
For answering Question 3, we have to study the circuit shown in Fig.5.28.
From Ohm’s law for the left resistor, we have v1 = −R1i1 and from the two-
port equations, we ﬁnd v1 = R1(i1 + i2) = R1i1 + R1A. Then, i1 = −A/2
and v2 = R1(i1 + 2i2) = 3R1A/2. The power delivered by the nullor is

behavior does not change, according to the deﬁnition. The original two-port (shown
in Fig.5.29a) is described by Eq.5.10.
The same two-port with exchanged ports (shown in Fig.5.29b) is described by
the descriptive equations:


Then, by comparing these descriptive equations with the original ones, we can
conclude that the two-port is symmetrical if and only if R12 = R21 and R11 = R22.
Notice that the symmetry of the two-port does not correspond simply to the symmetry
of matrix R, which instead characterizes the reciprocity of the two-port.
For instance, if we take the circuit shown in Fig.5.30a, we have v1 = R11A and
v2 = R21A. The same two-port connected as shown in Fig.5.30b provides ˆv1 = R12 A
and ˆv2 = R22 A. The two-port is symmetrical if and only if ˆv1 = v2 and ˆv2 = v1, that
is, if and only if the symmetry conditions hold.
Completely similar conditions (G12 = G21 and G11 = G22) hold for matrix G.

These conditions are trivially satisﬁed for det(H) = 1 and H21 = −H12. A less
trivial solution is described in the case study below.
Completely similar conditions hold for matrix H

138

Basic Concepts
We remark that these symmetry conditions hold only if matrix H is invertible
(i.e., det(H) ̸= 0).
Case Study
Determine if and under which conditions a two-port described by a matrix
H with det(H) ̸= 1 and H12 ̸= −H21 can be symmetrical.
Because det(H) ̸= 1 by assumption, the symmetry conditions H11 =
H11
det(H) and H22 =
H22
det(H) can be fulﬁlled only if H11 = H22 = 0. Then,
det(H) = −H12H21 and the other two symmetry conditions become H12 =

21 = 1.
Because H12 ̸= −H21 (i.e., the two-port is not reciprocal), the symmetry
conditions are H12 = H21 = 1 or H12 = H21 = −1. In this case the two-port
is symmetrical but not reciprocal.
5.5.3
Transmission Matrices
A two-port admitting matrix T is symmetrical if and only if T11 =
T22
det(T ), T12 =
T12
det(T ), T21 =
T21
det(T ) and T22 =
T11
det(T ). You can check your comprehension by
deriving these conditions.
You can also check that there are only two possible matrix structures fulﬁlling
these conditions: T =
 T11
T12
T21 −T11

, with T 2
11 + T12T21 = −1 (in this case the two-
port is also reciprocal, because det(T ) = 1) and T =
α


, with α = 1 or
α = −1.
Completely similar conditions hold for matrix T
′.
We remark that these symmetry conditions hold only if matrix T is invertible (i.e.,
det(T ) ̸= 0).
5.6
Directionality of Two-Ports
Another property that can be used to characterize a two-port is the so-called
directionality.

5.6 Directionality of Two-Ports
139
Fig. 5.31 Example of
zero-directional two-port,
with two uncoupled ports
A two-port is zero-directional if the two ports are uncoupled. (See an example
in Fig.5.31.) On the contrary, a two-port is one-directional if it is not zero-
directional and there exists one and only one relationship involving only the
descriptive variables of one port.
For instance, any pair of uncoupled one-port elements is a zero-directional two-
port, whereas the ideal controlled sources are one-directional two-ports.
Zero-directionality implies that the matrices associated with a basis are diagonal
and neither T nor T
′ are admitted.
One-directionality implies that in the matrices associated with a basis either the
element 12 (one-directionality 1 →2) or the element 21 (one-directionality 2 →1)
is zero. For example, the matrix R of Eq.5.12 and the matrix G of Eq.5.16 regard one-
directional 1 →2 elements. It also implies that either det(T ) = 0 or det(T
′) = 0,
depending on the versus of directionality.
5.7
Two-Port Ideal Power Transferitors
In this section, we deal with a particular subclass of nonenergic two-ports known as
ideal power transferitors. In generic nonenergic two-ports (Sect. 3.3.5 and Eq.5.1),
the power absorbed by a single port may also be identically (i.e., for any electrical
situation) zero, whereas in the ideal power transferitors the overall power only is
identically zero.
An ideal power transferitor [1] is a nonenergic two-port that absorbs an
identically null overall instantaneous power p(t) = v1i1 + v2i2, inasmuch as
both v1i1 and v2i2 are not identically zero.
Of course, this constraint implies that v1/i2 = −v2/i1 or equivalently v1/v2 =
−i2/i1, but these equations are not sufﬁcient to deﬁne a two-port (we would need a
pair of independent scalar equations).
We remark that a two-port ideal power transferitor always admits both T and T
′.
Indeed, because p1 = v1i1 ̸= 0 and p2 = v2i2 ̸= 0, nonenergic zero-directional two-
ports whose ports are either open or short circuits cannot be ideal power transferitors.

140
5
Basic Concepts
Moreover, as p1 + p2 = 0, it is not possible to have p1 = 0 and p2 ̸= 0 or vice
versa. This implies that one-directional two-ports where one port is either an open or
short circuit cannot be ideal power transferitors. For these reasons, an ideal power
transferitor cannot be either zero-directional or one-directional. As a consequence
(Sect. 5.6), T and T
′ are nonsingular.
Inconclusion,withoutlossofgenerality,wechoosematrix T torepresentageneric
ideal power transferitor. The overall instantaneous power p(t) absorbed by such a
two-port can be expressed through the entries of matrix T as a function of v2 and i2:
p = v1i1 + v2i2 = (T11T21)
   v2
2 + (T12T22)
   i2
2 + (1 −T11T22 −T12T21)


 v2i2 (5.24)
The null-power condition requires that the three underbraced coefﬁcients in
Eq.5.24 be null. Then, in order to ﬁnd the matrices T that fulﬁll the null-power
condition, we have to solve nonlinear system of three equations with respect to the
four unknowns T11, T22, T12, T21:
⎧
⎨
⎩
T11T21 = 0
T12T22 = 0
T11T22 + T12T21 = 1
(5.25)
The ﬁrst two of Eq. 5.25 constrain at least two of the unknowns (one between T11
and T21 and one between T12 and T22) to vanish. There would be four cases, but the
third equation excludes the possibility that both a diagonal and an off-diagonal entry
may be zero; that is, only two of the four cases are admitted. In conclusion, it is only
possible that either the two diagonal entries are both zero and the product of the two
off-diagonal ones returns one or vice versa. Then, there are only two structurally
different subsets of solutions of Eq. 5.25.
5.7.1
Ideal Transformer
The ﬁrst solution subset is given by T12 = T21 = 0, T11T22 = 1. This subset of so-
lutions fulﬁlls the reciprocity condition det(T ) = 1 and corresponds to a two-port
circuit element shown in Fig.5.32a, called the ideal transformer, whose transmission
matrix T is:
T =
 n
0
0 1/n

(5.26)
where n is a dimensionless real parameter called the transformation ratio.

5.7 Two-Port Ideal Power Transferitors

(b)
The ideal transformer descriptive equations are:
v1(t) = nv2(t)
i2(t) = −ni1(t)
(5.27)
Remark 1: The dots determine the orientation of each port; that is, they denote
the upper terminal of each port.
Remark 2: The port at the “n” side is port 1.
From the descriptive equations, it is apparent that the only admitted bases are the
two mixed bases (v1, i2) and (i1, v2). Moreover, this two-port is linear, time-invariant,
memoryless, nonenergic, reciprocal, and nonsymmetrical (by assuming n ̸= 1). If
n = 1, we obtain the so-called ideal connector.
You can check your comprehension by ﬁnding one or more equivalent models of
the ideal transformer, containing only controlled sources.
The two-port ideal transformer was proposed as an idealized model of a device
(transformer) that has been well-known from more than a century, and is exploited to
transfer electrical energy without signiﬁcant losses. According to the historical notes
on circuit theory reported in [2–4], the generalized N-port ideal transformer was
introduced into the circuit literature in 1920 [5] as “an electrical device which may
be used to transfer energy, but itself can neither absorb, store, nor supply energy”
(Appendix VI in [5], where the basic concepts for the “new” element are established).
Among the many applications, real transformers are also used extensively in
electronic devices to decrease the supply voltage to a level suitable for the low-voltage
circuits they contain. In these cases, they appear as black-boxes placed between the
plug and the device. Your daily experience makes it apparent that a real transformer
differs from the ideal component for at least two reasons: it warms up when working
– meaning that it is not an ideal power transferitor – and it does not work anymore
when connected to a DC source – meaning that the model approximates the physical
system reasonably well only under speciﬁc assumptions, for example, AC input
within a proper frequency range.

Case Study 1
Find the descriptive equation of the composite two-terminal shown in
Fig. 5.33, where the two-terminal A connected to the ideal transformer is
described by the implicit equation f (˜i, ˜v) = 0.
From the ideal transformer equations, we obtain v = n˜v and i =
˜i
n (no-
tice that ˜i is the opposite of the port-2 current). Because f (˜i, ˜v) = 0, we
ﬁnally obtain that the descriptive equation of the composite two-terminal is
f (ni, v
n ) = 0. For instance, if the two-terminal A were a resistor, the descrip-
tive equation of the composite two-terminal would be v = n2Ri, that is, again
a resistor, but with a scaled resistance value.
Case Study 2
Find the descriptive equation and the Thévenin equivalent of the composite
two-terminal shown in Fig. 5.34.
First of all, we have to identify the ideal transformer ports (through the
label n in the ﬁgure) and their orientations (through the dots) correctly. Then,
as usual, we express the descriptive variables in terms of the problem variables,
which in this case are v and i: thus (Fig.5.35) we ﬁnd the voltage across R1
(Ohm’s law), the current circulating in the left mesh (current equation of the
ideal transformer), the voltage across R2 (Ohm’s law), and the voltage on port
2 of the ideal transformer (KVL). Next, by using the voltage equation of the

KVL, the required descriptive equation: v = R1i + n2R2i −nE.
By simply reorganizing the descriptive equation, we can easily ﬁnd the

Case Study 3
For the composite two-port shown in Fig. 5.36, where α ̸= n, ﬁnd the
descriptive equations, the admitted bases and matrices, the resistance matrix
(if admitted), the conditions on the parameters such that the composite two-
port is reciprocal, symmetrical, passive, active, or nonenergic (check each
property independently of the others).
As usual, we express the descriptive variables in terms of the problem
variables, which in this case are the port variables and the driving voltage vR:
thus (Fig.5.37) we ﬁnd the voltage across R2 (Ohm’s law) and the voltage
on port 2 of the ideal transformer (KVL). This implies that vR = −R2i2 and
v1 = αvR = −αR2i2, which is a ﬁrst descriptive equation. Then, from cut-set
1, it is evident that the current ﬂowing in R3 must be null, as well as the voltage
across it. This also implies that the current in port 2 of the ideal transformer isi2.
Next, by using the current equation of the ideal transformer, we ﬁnd the current

Basic Concepts

in its port 1 (−i2/n), which is also the current ﬂowing in R1 (due to KCL for
nodal cut-set 2). Then the voltage across R1 is −R1i2/n. The voltage equation
of the ideal transformer states that the voltage on its port 1 is n(v2 −R2i2) and,
through KVL for inner loop A, the second descriptive equation is: −αR2i2 =
n(v2 −R2i2) −R1i2/n; that is, v2 =

i2.
From the descriptive equations, the admitted bases are (i1, i2) (correspond-
ing to matrix R) and (i1, v2) (corresponding to matrix H). Matrix T
′ is also
admitted.
The resistance matrix can be directly identiﬁed from the descriptive equa-
tions:
R =

Reciprocity: The two-port is reciprocal only for α = 0 (such that R12 =
R21).
Symmetry: The symmetry conditions require α = 0 and (to impose also
R11 = R22) R2 = −R1/n2, which is not compatible with the usual assumption
of positive resistances.
Energetic behavior: Owing to the descriptive equations, the absorbed power
(p(t) = v1i1 + v2i2) is in general a function of i1 and another port variable,
thus we cannot say anything about its sign. Then, for α ̸= 0, the two-port is
active. For α = 0, we have p(t) =

is passive.
5.7.2
Gyrator
The second subset of solutions of Eq. 5.25 is given by T11 = T22 = 0, T12
T21 = 1. This subset corresponds to a nonreciprocal two-port circuit element shown

(5.28)
where gm is a real parameter (with physical dimension of Ω−1) called the gyration
conductance.
The gyrator descriptive equations are:
i1(t) = gmv2(t)
i2(t) = −gmv1(t)
(5.29)
From the descriptive equations, it is apparent that the only admitted bases are the
voltage basis and the current basis. Moreover, this two-port is linear, time-invariant,
memoryless, nonenergic, nonreciprocal, and nonsymmetrical. (You can easily check
it.)
The (ideal) gyrator was conceived by Tellegen in 1948 [6], not as a model of a
physical element but as the paradigm of nonreciprocal and passive two-port elements.
It represents one of the most signiﬁcant cases where circuit theory led to the deﬁnition
of a new (ideal) element whose physical realization was obtained later on. (See, e.g.,
[7–9].) For this reason, we call the (ideal) gyrator simply the “gyrator,” whereas the
name “ideal transformer” refers to the introduction of this two-port as an idealization
of an existing physical element. The gyrator basically changes the basis of a given
two-terminal element, as shown in the following Case Study 1. The most interesting
application of such a property was the possibility of converting an inductor into a
capacitor (two components that are introduced in Volume 2) and vice versa.
Case Study 1
Find the descriptive equation of the composite two-terminal shown in
Fig. 5.38, where the two-terminal A connected to the gyrator is described
by the implicit equation f (˜i, ˜v) = 0.
From the gyrator equations, we obtain i = gm ˜v and ˜i = gmv. Because
f (˜i, ˜v) = 0, we ﬁnally obtain that the descriptive equation of the composite

two-terminal is f (gmv, i
gm
) = 0. For instance, if the two-terminal A were a
linear resistor (˜v = R˜i), the descriptive equation of the composite two-terminal
would be i = g2
m Rv, that is, again a resistor, but with a scaled resistance value.
If the two-terminal A were a nonlinear resistor admitting the current basis only
(˜v = f (˜i)), the descriptive equation of the composite two-terminal would be
i = gm f (gmv) = ˆf (v), that is, again a nonlinear resistor, but admitting the
voltage basis only.
Case Study 2
For the composite two-port shown in Fig. 5.39, where R > 0, ﬁnd descrip-
tive equations, admitted bases and matrices, conductance matrix (if admitted),
and properties.
We express the descriptive variables in terms of the port variables: thus
(Fig.5.40) we ﬁnd the voltage across 2R and the current in R (Ohm’s law),
the voltage on port 1 of the gyrator (KVL), and the current in port 2 of the
gyrator (gyrator equation). Then, from the second gyrator equation, we ﬁnd
i2 = gmv1, which is a ﬁrst descriptive equation. Moreover, from KCL for cut-
set 1, we ﬁnd i1 = gm(2Ri2 −v2) + v1/R = gm(2Rgmv1 −v2) + v1/R =

From the descriptive equations, the admitted bases are (i1, i2) (correspond-

sponding to matrix H). Matrices T and T

Connections of Two-Ports
When two or more linear, time-invariant, and memoryless two-port elements are
connected, the two-port parameters of the combined network can be found by per-
forming matrix algebra on the matrices of parameters for the component two-ports.
The matrix operation can be made particularly simple with an appropriate choice of
two-port parameters to match the type of connection of the two-ports, as shown in
the following subsections.
The combination rules need to be applied with care. Some connections result in
the port condition being invalidated or Kirchhoff’s laws violated and the combination
rule will no longer apply.
5.8.1
Cascade Connection
One of the most common two-port connections is the so-called cascade connection.
In the cascade connection two two-ports are connected with port 2 (output
port) of the ﬁrst connected to port 1 (input port) of the second, as shown in
Fig.5.42.
The most convenient representation for cascade-connected two-ports is the for-
ward transmission matrix T . If both two-ports admit transmission matrices TA and
TB and also the resulting two-port admits transmission matrix T , then T can be easily
obtained as T = TATB. Indeed, for two-port A, we have

Given the composite two-terminal shown in Fig. 5.43, ﬁnd the matrix repre-
sentations admitted by two-port A and by two-port B and the Norton equivalent
representation shown in the ﬁgure.
Two-port A admits all matrix representations but H
′, because the basis
(vA1, i A2) is not admitted.
Two-port B admits all matrix representations but R and G, because current

Series-Series Connection
Another quite diffused connection is the so-called series-series connection (or simply

In the series connection two two-ports are connected in such a way that the
ports 1 of both two-ports share the same descriptive current, as well as the
ports 2, as shown in Fig.5.45.
The most convenient representation for series-connected two-ports is the resis-
tance matrix R. If both two-ports admit resistance matrices RA and RB and also
the resulting two-port admits resistance matrix R, then R can be easily obtained as
R = RA + RB. Indeed, for two-port A, we have

A third important connection is the so-called parallel-parallel connection (or simply

In the parallel connection two two-ports are connected in such a way that the
ports 1 of both two-ports share the same descriptive voltage, as well as the
ports 2, as shown in Fig.5.46.
The most convenient representation for parallel-connected two-ports is the con-
ductance matrix G. If both two-ports admit conductance matrices G A and G B and
the resulting two-port admits conductance matrix G, then G can be easily obtained

When ports 1 (2) are connected in parallel and ports 2 (1) are connected in series,
we have the so-called parallel-series (series-parallel) connection. In these cases, the
most convenient representations are the hybrid matrices.

Advanced Concepts
Abstract In this chapter, Tellegen’s theorem and the colored edge theorem are
used as tools to get some general properties for a circuit such as reciprocity and
passivity, results concerning the power balance, and the so-called no-gain properties.
Henceforth, the word network is used to denote a generic portion of a circuit, that is,
a composite multiport or a composite multiterminal.
6.1
Tellegen’s Theorem: A Tool to Investigate Circuit
Properties
Tellegen’s theorem (Sect.2.3) can be employed to study the properties of a circuit in
terms of those of its components. For this purpose it is useful (although not essential)
to introduce a theorem formulation in which the circuit branches containing sources
are put in evidence with respect to the rest of the circuit.
Consider a circuit containing voltage and current sources. This circuit can be
represented schematically as in Fig.6.1, where all the P sources are placed outside a
closed boundary, whereas the network consisting of all the remaining circuit elements
is inside the boundary.
The two-terminal element represented within the boundary does not introduce
any restriction on the number of terminals of the inner components. It should be
thought of as simply representing any inner edge of the circuit graph. Let N be
the number of edges of the graph corresponding to the circuit within the boundary.
The descriptive variables for each of these edges follow the standard choice and
are denoted by vk, ik (k = 1, . . . , N). On the other hand, the conventional directions
assumed for the descriptive variables ˆv j, ˆi j of the P sources ( j = 1, . . . , P) follow
the nonstandard choice. With this in mind, the orthogonal vectors of descriptive
variables in the circuit are (ˆv1, . . . , ˆvP, v1, . . . , vN) and (−ˆi1, . . . , −ˆiP, i1, . . . , iN)
and we can write Tellegen’s theorem in the form

This formulation of Tellegen’s theorem can be used to show that if a network
consists entirely of elements of a given class, it belongs in turn to the same class. Some
examples of this general property and other consequences of Tellegen’s theorem are
provided in the remaining sections of this chapter.

6.4
Circuit Biasing and Small-Signal Relations
Many electronic circuits containing nonlinear components, such as communications
and signal processing devices, usually carry a small-amplitude AC signal, also called
a small signal, summed to a DC term, also called bias. This suggests that these circuits
can be studied by analyzing relatively small perturbations around a bias point: this
is usually done by linearizing the circuit equations around the bias point.
As an example, in the circuit shown in Fig.6.3a the DC voltage E generates the
bias voltages v(0)
1
and v(0)
2
across the resistor and the diode, respectively; let ˆi1
(0)
be the (common) bias current. All these values can be found by solving the circuit
equations. The diode’s equation is obviously nonlinear. The introduction of the AC
voltage source δe induces current and voltage perturbations with respect to the bias
values, as shown in Fig.6.3c, d.
More in general, it is often possible to decompose a time-varying signal as the
sum of a large-amplitude component (large signal) and a small-amplitude component
(small signal). The DC and AC signals are just a particular case of this general
scenario.
Tellegen’s theorem relates the bias and perturbation values without introducing
any assumption about the amplitude of the perturbations, which are not necessarily
small signals. In the following, we provide two results concerned with power balances
for both the biases and the perturbation values of voltages and currents. Making
reference to Fig.6.1, we ﬁrst consider a vector v(0) and a vector i(0) whose voltage
and current elements
v(0) = (ˆv(0)
1 , . . . , ˆv(0)
P , v(0)
1 , . . . , v(0)
N )
i(0) = (−ˆi(0)

Fig. 6.4 The pairs of vectors
to which Tellegen’s theorem
is applied
are such that all circuit equations are fulﬁlled. They correspond to a physical reference
situation for the circuit and can be either constant values (bias values) or time-
dependent functions (e.g., sinusoidal functions with assigned frequency). Obviously,
v(0) and i(0) are orthogonal. Now consider a situation in which the voltages and
currents are perturbed with respect to these reference values. This means that the
voltage and current vectors are now structured as follows.
v = v(0) + δv
i = i(0) + δi.
(6.2)
Voltages and currents of the vectors v and i are compatible with the graph of the
circuit and orthogonal as well. From expressions Eq.6.2, then, it follows that the
perturbation vectors δv and δi, individually, also share the same properties.
Tellegen’s theorem in the form 6.1 can be applied to the elements of the vectors
v(0), i(0), δv, and δi deﬁned above in four ways, labeled in the diagram of Fig.6.4.

6.4 Circuit Biasing and Small-Signal Relations
171
The terms that appear in the cross-power balances II and III have a mixed character.
Each edge of the graph contributes to the Tellegen balance with a product term
between one of its descriptive variables in the reference state and its complementary
variable in the perturbed state. As such, they do not, in general, offer a direct physical
interpretation.
The other two cross-power balances are explicitly written below:

Equation6.3 is simply the balance of powers in the reference physical situation:
the overall power supplied by the sources is absorbed by the components inside the
boundary surface.
Equation6.4 is concerned with the power balancing related to perturbations. The
power terms for these components may evolve with time differently from those in
the reference physical situation. For example, if the reference terms in Eq.6.3 are
constants, the perturbation terms in Eq.6.4 may be periodic in time (e.g., sinusoidal,
as in the examples cited at the beginning of this section). Alternatively, if the reference
terms are large AC signals at a certain frequency, the perturbation terms may be, say
small AC signals with a higher frequency.
The result of Eq.6.4 is a nontrivial consequence of Tellegen’s theorem and is the
basis for the properties described in the next section.
6.5
Local Activity and Ampliﬁcation
When all the N (with N ≥2) products δvkδik in the sum at the r.h.s. of Eq.6.4 are
positive, each of them is strictly smaller than the overall power 	P
j=1 δˆv jδˆi j delivered
by the sources. However, there are cases where one or more of these products can
be negative. As an example, for a nonlinear resistor whose DP characteristic on the
(i, v) plane has a negative slope −R at its bias point Q (Fig.6.5), the small-signal
variations δv and δi are such that δvδi = −R(δi)2 < 0. In this case, we say that the
resistor is locally active at its bias point.
A resistor is said to be locally active at a speciﬁc point of its DP characteristic
if the slope of the characteristic is negative at that point.

172

Advanced Concepts
Fig. 6.5 DP characteristic of
a resistor locally active at Q.
In a small neighborhood of
Q (grey circle) δv ≃−Rδi
In the presence of a locally active resistor, we can get an ampliﬁcation. The
following particular case of the power balance expressed by Eq.6.4 provides an
example, with one source (P = 1) and two resistors inside the boundary (N = 2).
In this case Eq.6.4 becomes:
δˆvδˆi


ps
= δv1δi1

  
p1
+ δv2δi2

  
p2
.
The term ps, positive by assumption, denotes the small signal power supplied by the
external source and entering the boundary surface, whereas p1 and p2 are the powers
absorbed by the inner resistors. Taking account of this expression, the ratio between
the powers p1 and ps can be recast as
p1
ps
= ps −p2
ps
.
• When p1 > 0 and p2 > 0 we have
p1
ps
< 1
(no ampliﬁcation)
A similar result holds for p2
ps
.
• If p1 > 0 and p2 < 0, instead, we obtain:
p1
ps
> 1.
Therefore the power p1 is larger than the power ps entering the boundary surface;
that is, there is an ampliﬁcation of the power related to (small) perturbations. The
resistor with p2 < 0 is locally active.
We remark that these results relate only to electrical perturbations with respect to
a reference physical situation.
To better understand the roles of the bias and of the perturbation terms, consider
the following case study.

Case Study
Figure6.6a shows the physical reference situation. A constant voltage
source E is connected to the series of a linear resistor Ro and of a nonlinear,
passive, current-controlled resistor whose DP characteristic v = ¯v(i) is shown
in Fig.6.6b. In terms of the current io ﬂowing through the circuit elements, we
can write:
E = Roio + ¯v(io).
(6.5)
We assume that, owing to the parameters’ setting, at the point Q = (io, ¯v(io))
theresistorcharacteristichasanegativeslope−R (with R > 0).(SeeFig.6.6b.)
The voltage source δe (Fig.6.7) perturbs the current and voltages with
respect to the reference values. In this case Eq.6.5 is recast as
E + δe = Ro(io + δi) + ¯v(io + δi)
(6.6)
Assuming that, in magnitude, perturbations are smaller than the corresponding
reference values (in particular, |δi| << |io|), the nonlinear resistor’s voltage
can be approximated by a Taylor series centered at the bias point Q and trun-
cated to the ﬁrst term:
¯v(io + δi) ≃¯v(io) + d¯v

δi.
Then, Eq.6.6 can be approximated:
E + δe ≃Ro(io + δi) + ¯v(io) −Rδi
from which, taking account of Eq.6.5, and within the limits of accuracy of the
Taylor ﬁrst-order approximation, we obtain
δe = (Ro −R)δi.
(6.7)
This result allows us to write Eq.6.4 as
δeδi = Ro(δi)2 −R(δi)2
When R < Ro, δi, and δe share the same sign (Eq.6.7) and the power term
δeδi is positive. Under this assumption, the ratio between the power absorbed
by Ro and the power delivered by the source δe is:

Colored Edge Theorem
The colored edge theorem, or colored branch theorem [1], was initially formulated
and applied mainly in the graph-theoretic framework. Later on, it was progressively
recognized as a powerful tool also in the circuit theory context [2]. The theorem
depends on the circuit’s graph only, as well as Tellegen’s theorem, and has the same
level of generality. Here, it is used to prove two theorems in Sect.6.7.
Q Shortcut. The reader not interested in the cited proofs can skip this section.
For an arbitrary allocation of the edges of a graph in three sets (colors), the
theorem establishes alternatives for the existence of loops or cut-sets having speciﬁc
characteristics (color and orientation of the edges). Following [2], ﬁrst consider a
directed graph; then freely color each of its edges using one of three colors: red, blue,
or green. Among the green edges, one is dark. In this manner, the same graph can be
colored in many different ways.
In a generic loop inside the graph, the edges oriented in the same direction (clock-
wise/counterclockwise) are called similarly directed. Likewise, considering a cut-set

colored edge theorem. a

b cut-set fulﬁlling
condition 2
(a)
(b)
with its associated closed path, we call similarly directed the cut-set edges oriented
as the closed path (or surface for nonplanar graphs).
Theorem 6.3 (Colored edge theorem) In a directed colored graph (not necessarily
connected), one and only one of the following properties must hold:
1. The dark green edge forms a loop exclusively with green and/or red edges such
that the green edges (including the dark green edge) are similarly directed.
2. The dark green edge forms a cut-set exclusively with green and/or blue edges such
that the green edges (including the dark green edge) in the cut-set are similarly
directed.
The proof of the theorem can be found in [2] and is not reported here.
Two examples are shown in Fig.6.8, where go denotes the dark green edge. Each
green edge (g-edges in the ﬁgure) is oriented, whereas for red (r-edges of panel a)
and blue (b-edges of panel b) edges, both directions are allowed.
Remark 1 Only one of the two conditions holds, thus the existence of a loop fulﬁlling
condition 1 of the theorem excludes the existence of a cut-set with the characteristics
given in condition 2; on the other hand, in the presence of a cut-set fulﬁlling condition
2, we cannot have a loop as described in condition 1.
Remark 2 The theorem says nothing about uniqueness. If a loop (cut-set) fulﬁlls
condition 1 (2), it is possible that the graph contains other loops (cut-sets) with the
same characteristics.
Figure6.9 shows two possible applications of the theorem, corresponding to two
different colorings of the edges on the same (nonplanar) graph. The choice of the
dark green edge go as in Fig.6.9a leads to a loop formed by another green edge
oriented as go and by two red edges. It is easy to verify that go does not form cut-sets
meeting condition 2 of the theorem. The same graph is represented in Fig.6.9b with
a different choice of the edge colors. In this case, the edge chosen as go forms a
cut-set with two green edges both oriented as go and three blue edges. You can easily
check that go does not form loops meeting condition 1 of the theorem. To check
your comprehension, you can arbitrarily choose other color allocations for the graph
edges and verify the theorem validity.
The colored edge theorem is one of the most appropriate results to highlight
the generality of graph theory. Under rather mild assumptions, a graph can be used

Fig. 6.10 Example of graph representing a vehicular trafﬁc network; a graph structure with the
various kinds of streets (one-way, two-way, blocked); b, c results from the colored edge theorem
for two different choices of the dark green edge go
to represent lumped physical systems of very different nature (e.g., mechanical,
acoustic, hydraulic, thermal) [3]. In these cases, the voltage and current variables
are replaced by equivalent variables (resp., across variables and through variables)
suitable to closely represent the system physical nature. The graph plays, in any case,
the same role as in the case of circuits; that is, it codes information on how the various
parts of the system are connected to each other. Vehicular trafﬁc networks are among
these systems [4] and the results obtained by applying the colored edge theorem to
their graphs are simple and meaningful.
A road network can be schematized in a completely intuitive way as an intercon-
nection of edges, each representing a street. We can color two-way streets in red,
one-way streets in green, and blocked streets in blue. (See Fig.6.10a.) The edge go
chosen in Fig.6.10b, connecting node 3 to node 4, forms a cut-set with a blue edge
(and, according to the theorem, no loop with similarly directed g edges and/or with
r edges). Then node 4 is reachable from node 3 but not vice versa, owing to the edge
orientation. The edge go chosen in Fig.6.10c forms two loops with similarly directed
green edges and with red edges (and, according to the theorem, no cut-set with sim-
ilarly directed g edges and/or b edges): all nodes of these loops can be reached from
any of their nodes.
In the circuit ﬁeld, the colored edge theorem can be a very efﬁcient analysis tool
when the edges of the graph are colored depending on the nature (or on a speciﬁc
property) of the components corresponding to these edges. For instance, consider
the diode Graetz bridge in the circuit of Fig.6.11. In general, the voltage source e on
the input side AB is time-dependent: e = e(t) (e.g., an AC source as in the case of
an electric socket). The output variable is the current i(t) through the resistor R. The

(b)
four diodes of the bridge are thought to behave as an open or short circuit, according
to the PW L DP characteristic shown in Fig.3.13c.
In the circuit graph, each diode edge is colored in green and oriented as the current
direction when the diode operates as a short circuit. The edge go is associated with
the series connection of e(t) and re and is oriented according to the physical direction
of the current delivered by the input side AB to the rest of the circuit: from right to left
when e > 0 (Fig.6.12a) and from left to right when e < 0 (Fig.6.12b). Finally, the
output side CD of the graph is colored in red. Following the colored edge theorem,
you immediately see that in both graphs no cut-sets of go with similarly directed green
edges can occur (condition 2). In both cases, then, go forms a loop with similarly
directed green edges and with the red edge (condition 1). These loops are marked by
the grey dashed lines in Fig.6.12a, b.
The positive current assumption through the edges g1, g2 in the ﬁrst case and
g3, g4 in the latter case implies that the corresponding PW L diodes behave as short
circuits. In both cases, therefore, the Graetz circuit is equivalent to the simpler circuit
shown in Fig.6.13a, and we have:
i =
|e|
R + re
.
This proves that, irrespective of the sign of e(t), the current i is “one-directional”.
We ﬁnally observe that it is easy to verify that the diodes on the edges g3 and g4 in
Fig.6.12a and the diodes on the edges g1 and g2 in Fig.6.12b behave as open circuits.

a full-wave bridge rectiﬁer.

Circuits Consisting of Two-Terminal Elements:
No-Gain Theorems
We consider a circuit containing only independent voltage and current sources, two-
terminal resistors, and short-circuit and open-circuit elements (Fig.6.14). Each resis-
tor can be either linear or nonlinear and is assumed to be strictly passive, according
to the following deﬁnition.
A two-terminal resistor is strictly passive if and only if vi > 0 for any point
(v, i) of its DP characteristic, except the origin (0, 0).
Then a linear resistor with R > 0 is strictly passive and the same holds for any
resistor whose characteristic lies in the ﬁrst and third quadrants and intersects the v
and i axes only in the origin. For instance, the DP characteristic shown in Fig.6.6b
is strictly passive, whereas the DP characteristic shown in Fig.3.13c is passive, but
not strictly passive.
Furthermore, we assume that the circuit does not contain either loops of short
circuits only or cut-sets of open circuits only.
Under these assumptions, the following no-gain theorems hold [2].
Theorem 6.4 For any element of the circuit, the upper limit of the current magnitude
is given by the sum of the current magnitudes through all independent voltage and
current sources.
Q Shortcut. The proof can be skipped without compromising the comprehension
of the next sections.

Fig. 6.14 Sets S and X of two-terminal elements allowed by the no-gain theorems. Resistors can
be either linear or nonlinear. Loops of short-circuit elements and cut-sets of open-circuit elements
are not allowed
Fig. 6.15 The cutset C in the proof of Theorem 6.4. The conventions for the sources are left
unspeciﬁed because they are not relevant to the theorem’s proof
Proof We preliminarily note that, when the edge considered (henceforth denoted
as p) is a voltage or current source, or if i p = 0, Theorem 6.4 is trivially satisﬁed.
Now consider the case when p is a resistor, or a short circuit or an open circuit
and vp ̸= 0 or i p ̸= 0. The edges of the circuit with zero voltage and current may be
removed because they do not contribute to the sum in the theorem’s statement, do not
alter the circuit solution, and do not introduce new loops, owing to the assumptions.
In the resulting circuit, let S be the set of sources, and X the set of resistors, short
circuits, and open circuits (Fig.6.14). Therefore, p is an element of X. Because all
of the resistors are strictly passive, without loss of generality we can choose the
associated directions for any element (associated with the graph edge q) of X such
that vq ≥0 and iq ≥0. Now we apply the colored edge theorem by coloring in green
the edges in X and in blue the edges in S.
The edge p cannot form a similarly directed loop that contains only other edges
of X. Indeed, if vp > 0, the KVL in the loop would be violated because the other
loop voltages can only be ≥0; if vp = 0, the KVL also implies that the other loop
voltages are zero. In the latter case, however, inasmuch as it is excluded that the
corresponding currents are also zero (the branches with zero voltage and current
have been removed), the edges of the loop should be short circuits, but this is not
possible by assumption. According to the colored edge theorem, then, there must be
a cut-set C that contains, apart from p, edges from both X and S and wherein the
edges from X are similarly directed. (See Fig.6.15.)

Theorem 6.5 For any element of the circuit, the upper limit of the voltage magnitude
is given by the sum of the voltage magnitudes across all independent voltage and
current sources.
Q Shortcut. The proof can be skipped without compromising the comprehension
of the next sections.
Proof We preliminarily note that, when the edge considered (henceforth denoted
as p) is a voltage or current source, or if vp = 0, Theorem 6.5 is trivially satisﬁed.
We again apply the colored edge theorem. We maintain the green color for the
edges of X (including the edge p) and red color for the edges of S (no blue edges). As
in the proof of Theorem 6.4, the associated directions for all edges in X are chosen so
that vq ≥0 and iq ≥0. The same line of reasoning, mutatis mutandis, immediately
gives that edge p cannot form a similarly directed cut-set that contains only edges
of X. Therefore, according to the colored edge theorem, there must exist a loop L
containing, in addition to the edge p, edges from both sets X and S, where the edges
from X are similarly directed. (See Fig.6.16.) The KCL written for loop L gives

As a particular case for the two theorems, we observe that in a circuit containing
a single (voltage or current) source and only strictly passive (both linear and non-
linear) resistors, the magnitude of the voltage across any resistor cannot exceed the
magnitude of the voltage across the source. A completely analogous statement can
be formulated in terms of the current magnitudes through the resistors and through
the source, respectively.

Abstract This chapter is devoted to general methods of circuit analysis, that is,
methods to solve a circuit (see Sect.3.1) in a systematic way. Some of these methods
are particularly suitable for circuit simulation using a computer. In particular, here
we focus on memoryless circuits, even if the proposed results are easily extended
to other circuits in the next chapters. We describe node and mesh analysis methods,
the superposition principle, substitution principle, and some practical rules that can
help circuit analysis.

Nodal Analysis
In this section we introduce different versions of the nodal analysis method, starting
from the simplest one.
7.1.1
Pure Nodal Analysis
We consider a circuit consisting of two-terminals only. Let L be the number of these
elements and N the number of circuit nodes. Any one of these nodes can be chosen
as the reference node (or datum node). We label the reference node with 0 and all
the other nodes with integer positive numbers, for example, increasing from 1 to
N −1. The voltage ek from the reference node to the generic node k is called the
node voltage. It is easy to check (by applying KVL) that any other voltage can be
expressed as a sum (with proper signs) of node voltages. This is true, in particular,
for the voltages across the components. As an example, for the circuit in Fig.7.1 the

voltages e1, e2 as

The KCL equations are written for all the N −1 nodes different from the reference
node. For the circuit of Fig.7.1 we have:
ia + ib + ic = 0;
−ic + id = 0.
Assumptions: The circuit consists only of
• Linear two-terminal components that admit the voltage basis
• Independent current sources
Under these assumptions, the currents in the KCL equations can be easily
expressed in terms of the node voltages ek through the component equations. This
leads us to obtain a set of linear equations whose only unknowns are the node volt-
ages ek (k = 1, . . . , N −1). Once the node voltages are known, any other voltage or
current can be obtained in a straightforward way. The procedure is detailed through
the following example.

The node equations are:
−ia + id + A1 = 0;
ia + ib + ic −A1 + A3 = 0;
−ib + A2 −A3 = 0.
Each resistor current can now be expressed in terms of the node voltages,

namely in such a way that the terms on the main diagonal of G appear with a

In passing, we note that the circuit equations, per se, could be those of
a three-port (containing only resistors, which are reciprocal components)
described by the matrix G connected to three equivalent current sources,
described by the vector ˆa. (See the equivalent circuit shown in Fig.7.3.)
The three-port is reciprocal, owing to the reciprocity Theorem 3.1. (See also
Sect.6.3.) This implies, for a generalization of the property shown in Sect.5.4.1
for two-ports, that G is symmetric.
The node voltages can be easily obtained from the system of equations, whatever
the form in which the system is written. In any case, the form Ge = ˆa is simple
to obtain by following a few systematic rules. These rules are easily obtained by
observing the correspondences between the terms of the equations and the circuit.
Their character, however, is general, and as such they are proposed below.
In the system of equations
Ge = ˆa
(7.1)
the entries of G and ˆa are obtained by circuit inspection according to the rules:
1. In the ith row, associated with the ith node, the element Gii of the main diagonal
is the sum of the conductances of the resistors incident at the node i.

2. Gik, with k ̸= i, is the sum of the conductances (with −sign) of the resistors
connecting node i with node k. If no resistors connect node i with node k, then
Gik = 0.
3. The ith entry of ˆa is the algebraic sum of the currents impressed by the sources
connected to the ith node; each of these currents contributes with the + sign if
its direction is towards the node; otherwise it contributes with the −sign.
According to these rules, everything works as if at the ith node only one current
source were present. The source is connected between the ith node and the common
node. For instance, in the circuit of Fig.7.2, the equivalent current source entering
node 3 is A3 −A2.
7.1.2
Modiﬁed Nodal Analysis
The nodal analysis method can be modiﬁed so as to admit the presence of both
independent voltage sources and the four controlled sources deﬁned in Sect.5.2.1.
In this case, the unknown variables of the circuit are not only the node voltages {ek}
(primary unknowns) but also proper auxiliary unknowns.
A ﬁrst type of auxiliary unknown is related to the voltage sources, both inde-
pendent and controlled. As a matter of fact, in both cases the component’s equation
does not provide information about the current through the source. This current must
therefore be regarded as an unknown ix (Fig.7.4), to be found together with the node
voltages.
The second kind of auxiliary unknown is the controlling current for both CCVSs
and CCCSs. This descriptive variable appears in the component’s equation and must
be added to the set of unknown variables. In the case of VCVS and VCCS, instead,
because the driving variable is a voltage, it can be directly expressed in terms of node
voltages, without the need of an auxiliary unknown.
Because of the introduction of the auxiliary unknowns, the system to be solved
no longer has the simple form Eq.7.1 as for the case of pure nodal analysis.
Many circuit simulation programs, such as those of the SPICE (Simulation Pro-
gram with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) family, are based on modiﬁed nodal analysis
(MNA).

The presence of two voltage sources (one controlled and one independent)
requires the introduction of the auxiliary unknowns i1 and i2, respectively;
moreover, we must introduce as an auxiliary unknown the driving current i of
the controlled source.
Step 1. The three node equations are as follows.

Step 2. The descriptive equations of the components that do not admit the
voltage basis are:

Voltage source: e3 = E
Step 3. The driving current i can be expressed as i = e1
R .
You can easily check that, solving these equations, you ﬁnd the solution
already found in Sect.5.2.1.2.
7.1.3

Writing the circuit equations can sometimes be made easier by applying the substi-
tution rule described here, which can be used for both independent and controlled
sources.

containing this current source can be removed by modifying the circuit as shown
in Fig.7.6b, where two current sources identical to the original one are connected
in parallel to the components a and b. The electrical behavior of the circuit does
not change, because the KCL equations that are written at the nodes 1, 2, 3 in the
original circuit are exactly the same as for the modiﬁed circuit (in particular, the
overall contribution of the two current sources at node 1 is zero). As a result of this

substitution, we have a current source connected in parallel to both a and b. If the
two-terminal a is, in turn, a current source, the parallel connection is equivalent to
a single source whose current is given by the algebraic sum of the two constituents.
(See Sect.3.5.2.1.) If a is a resistor, the connection of a current source in parallel
originates a Norton equivalent.
As an example, the circuit of Fig.7.2 can be changed by applying the transforma-
tion twice, for both A1 and A3. The resulting circuit is shown in Fig.7.7. The equiv-
alent current sources entering nodes 1, 2, 3 are −A1, A1 −A3, −A2 + A3, respec-
tively. Obviously, these are also the elements of the vector ˆa obtained from the circuit
equations in Sect.7.1.1.

Mesh Analysis
Also in this case, there are different versions of the mesh analysis method, that require
different assumptions. In this chapter, the term mesh is used to denote inner loops
only. (See Sect.2.1.2.)

its three meshes
7.2.1
Pure Mesh Analysis
We consider a circuit consisting of two-terminals only. We assume that this circuit is
planar, that is, that you can draw it on a sheet without crossings between components.
Without loss of generality, we assume also that the circuit is not hinged, that is, that it
cannotbedividedintotwopartsconnectedbyasinglenode.Undertheseassumptions,
the sides (elements) of the circuit form a set of meshes (i.e., “holes” on the sheet)
bounded by two or more elements of the circuit. If L is the number of elements of
the circuit and N is the number of nodes, it can be shown that the number of meshes
in the circuit is L −N + 1. As pointed out in Sect.3.1, this is also the number of
independent KVL equations for the circuit. This fact is not surprising: for each mesh
you can write a KVL equation in which the voltages are different, in whole or in part,
from those of every other mesh of the circuit. In addition, the KVL equations that can
be written for any other loop of the circuit are linearly dependent on those written
for the meshes. As an example, in the planar circuit of Fig.7.8 the KVL equations
corresponding to the meshes I,II,III are
(I)
va + vc −vb = 0
(II)
−vc + vd −ve = 0
(III)
ve −v f −vg = 0
The KVL for the loop (not mesh!) formed by the two-terminals c, d, f, g can be
written as −vc + vd −v f −vg = 0, but this equation linearly depends on equations
(II) and (III), because you can get it by summing member by member these equations.
(Note that the sum drops the term ve.)
The currents through the L two-terminals must meet the constraints given by the
N −1 KCL equations. These currents can be expressed in order to meet the KCLs
automatically. To do this, simply associate a “mesh current”1 with each mesh and
1Notice that this is not necessarily a variable that can be physically measured through an amper-
ometer.

express the currents through the components in terms of these mesh currents. Then
the current in each component will depend on one or two mesh currents.
In the proposed example, you can deﬁne the mesh currents j1, j2, j3, which are
shown in Fig.7.9, together with the component currents. In the two-terminals c and
e, which are shared by two meshes, the currents are given by the algebraic sum of
their mesh currents. With the conventions adopted, the complete set of equations
relating the component currents and the mesh currents is as follows.
ia = −j1;
ib = j1;
ic = −j1 + j2;
id = −j2;
ie = j2 −j3;
i f = ig = j3.
Each mesh current passing through the closed boundary of a cut-set does it twice,
one as input and the other as output, for which the resulting contribution to the
KCL is zero. (See Fig.7.10, which represents the cut-sets for nodes 2 and 5 with
the pertinent mesh currents related to the circuit of Fig.7.9.) Therefore, the mesh
currents automatically satisfy the KCL at the nodes (and more generally the KCL
for any cut-set in the circuit).
The mesh analysis method considers as unknowns the (L −N + 1) mesh currents
instead of the L component currents. After getting the mesh currents, the currents in
the components can be easily obtained, as in the example just considered.

Remark: It should be noted that drawing the same circuit in different ways may
originatedifferent meshes. For instance, thecircuit of Figs. 7.8and7.9canberedrawn
as shown in Fig.7.11. In this case, the edges f and g form a mesh with edges c, d,
and (as before) a mesh with e. The new set of mesh currents is completely equivalent
to the previous one.
Assumptions: The circuit is planar and consists only of
• Linear two-terminal components that admit the current basis
• Independent voltage sources
The KVL equations are written with reference to the meshes of the circuit; by
means of the descriptive equations of the components, each voltage contribution
inside the mesh can be written directly in terms of the mesh currents. The procedure
details are illustrated by the following example.
Case Study
Solve with pure mesh analysis the circuit shown in Fig. 7.12.
The circuit is planar and contains linear resistors and independent voltage
sources only. The three meshes are associated with the mesh currents j1, j2, j3,
respectively, all oriented in the same way. For each mesh, we can write the KVL
taking the component voltages as positive if oriented like the mesh current. In
this way we obtain the following equations.

7.2 Mesh Analysis

⎧
⎨
⎩
−Eb −Ra j1 −Rc( j1 −j2) = 0
−Ee −Rc( j2 −j1) −Rd j2 = 0
Ee −R f j3 −Eg = 0.
After a few manipulations, the system can be recast as
⎧
⎨
⎩
(Ra + Rc) j1 −Rc j2 = −Eb
−Rc j1 + (Rc + Rd) j2 = −Ee
R f j3 = Ee −Eg.
Therefore, the system of equations can be written in compact form as
Rj = ˆe with j =

namely, in such a way that the terms on the main diagonal of R appear with a
positive sign.
We notice that the circuit equations, per se, could be those of a three-
port containing only reciprocal components (resistors) and described by the
matrix R connected to three equivalent voltage sources, described by the vec-
tor ˆe. (See the equivalent circuit shown in Fig.7.13.) Due to the reciprocity
Theorem 3.1 (see also Sect.6.3) the three-port is reciprocal. This implies
(owing to a generalization of the property shown in Sect.5.4.1 for two-ports)
that the matrix R is symmetric.
Of course, the mesh currents are easily obtained from the system of equations
whatever the form in which this system is written. However, the system in the form
Rj = ˆe is particularly simple to obtain because it rests on few systematic rules.

Basic Concepts
These rules are deduced easily by referring to the considered circuit, but are general
in nature and as such they are set out below.
In the system of equations
Rj = ˆe
(7.2)
the entries of R and ˆe are obtained by circuit inspection according to the rules:
• In the ith row, associated with the ith mesh, the entry Rii of the main diagonal is
the sum of the resistances encountered by ji along the mesh i.
• Rik, with k ̸= i, is the sum of the resistances (preceded by the −sign) shared by
ji and jk. If no resistance is shared by ji and jk, then Rik = 0.
• The ith entry of ˆe is the algebraic sum of the impressed voltages in the ith mesh;
each of these voltages contributes with the + sign if its direction agrees with that
of the mesh current ji; otherwise it is taken with the −sign.
According to these rules, everything works as if in the mesh associated with ji
only one voltage source were present. The voltage value is given by the ith element
of the vector ˆe: for instance, in the circuit of Fig.7.12, the equivalent voltage source
for the mesh associated with j3 is Ee −Eg.
7.2.2
Modiﬁed Mesh Analysis
As for the node analysis, the mesh analysis method can be modiﬁed so as to admit
the presence of independent current sources and of the four controlled sources. As a
general criterion, we need to add proper auxiliary unknowns to the primary unknowns
(the mesh currents { jk}).
Aﬁrsttypeofauxiliaryunknownisrelatedtothecurrentsources,bothindependent
and controlled. Indeed, in both cases the component’s equation does not provide
information about the voltage across the source. This voltage must therefore be
regarded as an unknown vx (Fig.7.14), to be found together with the mesh currents.
The second kind of auxiliary unknown is the driving voltage for both VCVS and
VCCS. This descriptive variable appears in the component’s equation and must be
added to the set of variables to be determined. For CCVSs and CCCSs, instead,
the driving variable is a current that can be expressed directly in terms of the mesh
currents, without the need of a further auxiliary unknown.

Fig. 7.15 Planar circuit for
the Case Study
Because of the introduction of the auxiliary unknowns, the system to be solved
does not maintain the simple form Eq.7.2 as for the case of pure mesh analysis.
Case Study
Solve with the modiﬁed mesh analysis the circuit shown in Fig. 7.15.
Thisplanarcircuitcontainslinearresistors,alinearVCCS(driving voltage: v),
a linear CCVS (driving current: i), and an independent current source A. The
circuit equations are expressed in terms of the mesh currents, of the auxiliary
variables vx and vy for the two current sources, and of the driving variables i
and v. With this in mind, we can formulate the KVL for each mesh as
⎧
⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
vx −R1 ( j1 −j2) = 0
R1 ( j1 −j2) −R2 j2 −R3 ( j2 −j3) = 0
v + vy −R4 ( j3 −j4) = 0
R4 ( j3 −j4) −ri = 0
The remaining equations are the driving variables i and v expressed in terms
of mesh currents and the descriptive equations for independent current source
and VCCS:
⎧
⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
i = j1 −j2
v = R3 ( j2 −j3)
j3 = gv
j1 = A
Note that the driving current i of the CCVS is expressed in a trivial way in
terms of the mesh currents; furthermore, the position of the current source A
on the external loop of the circuit enables us to assign the value A immediately
to the mesh current j1.
As j1 = A, the entire system of equations can be reformulated easily as fol-
lows. A ﬁrst group of three equations containing only the unknowns j2, j3, j4:
⎧
⎨
⎩
R1A −j2 (R1 + R2 + R3) + R3 j3 = 0
r j2 + R4 j3 −R4 j4 −r A = 0
gR3 j2 −j3 (1 + gR3) = 0

and a second group of equations that, taking j2, j3, j4 as solutions of the
previous equations, lead directly to writing the expressions of the remaining
unknowns vx, vy, i, v:
⎧
⎪⎪⎨
⎪⎪⎩
vx = R1 (A −j2)
vy = −R3 j2 + (R3 + R4) j3 −R4 j4
i = A −j2
v = R3 ( j2 −j3)
7.2.3
Substitution Rule
Writing the mesh equations in a circuit can sometimes become easier by applying
the substitution rule described below, which can be used for both independent and
controlled sources.
Figure7.16a represents the portion of a circuit containing a voltage source E. The
branch containing E can be replaced by a short circuit (and the nodes 1 and 2 reduced
to a single node) by modifying the circuit as shown in Fig.7.16b, where two voltage
sources E are connected in series to the components a and b, respectively. The KVLs
for the loops involving {E, va, v3} and {E, vb, v4}, respectively, are identical in the
original circuit and in its modiﬁed version; moreover, the same KCL holds for the
cut-set in the original circuit and for the node in the modiﬁed one (both indicated by
closed gray dotted lines in the ﬁgures). Therefore, the transformation does not affect
the behavior of the circuit. As a result of this substitution, we have a voltage source
connected in series to each of the components a and b. If a is a resistor, the series
connection with a voltage source originates a Thévenin equivalent; if a is, in turn, a
voltage source, the series connection is equivalent to a single source, whose voltage
is given by the algebraic sum of the two constituents. (See Sect.3.5.2.1.)
As an example, the circuit of Fig.7.12 can be modiﬁed by applying the sub-
stitution rule to the voltage source Ee. The resulting circuit is shown in Fig.7.17.

Sect.7.2.1.
7.3
Superposition Principle
The superposition principle is a general property valid for all linear systems. In very
general terms, this principle states that the “response” (output) of a linear system
induced by two or more stimuli (inputs) can be obtained at any instant as the sum of
the responses due separately to each stimulus. In classical mechanics, for instance,
for a point mass initially at rest and subject to the action of two forces (vectors) F1 and
F2 – not parallel, in general – the velocity vector at a given time can be obtained by
summing the velocity vectors due to the separate actions of F1 and F2. Switching to
another branch of physics, that is, electrostatics, at any point of the empty space and
at any instant the electric potential generated by the action of two electric charges q1
and q2 (stimuli) can be obtained by summing the contributions separately originated
by q1 and q2.
In other words, if input x1(t) produces output y1(t) and input x2(t) produces
output y2(t), then input k1x1(t) + k2x2(t) produces output k1y1(t) + k2y2(t), with
k1 and k2 dimensionless constants.
Stimuli and responses can be either scalar elements (e.g., numbers, functions) or
vectors. In the latter case, the superposition implies a vector sum.
For linear electric circuits, each stimulus (input) corresponds to an independent
voltage or current source; each term of the response can be either the current through
a branch of the circuit or the voltage across a pair of nodes of the circuit. The
superposition principle for electric circuits can then be expressed as follows.
Superposition principle: The solution (or response, or output) of a circuit
made up of linear components and two or more (say P) independent sources
(inputs) is the sum of the outputs that would have been determined by each
input acting alone, where all the other independent sources are turned off, that
is, replaced by either a short circuit (for voltage sources, see Fig.7.18a, b) or

an open circuit (for current sources, see Fig.7.18c, d). Then, the solution of
the original circuit is the sum of the solutions of P auxiliary circuits, each
obtained by turning on one independent source in turn and turning off all the
other independent sources.
In the most general case, the linear circuit elements can be either memoryless or
dynamic.
A more formal expression of this principle (superposition theorem) is provided
and demonstrated for time-invariant memoryless circuits in Sect.8.3.
Case Study 1
Find the current i in the circuit shown in Fig. 7.19.
As stated above, we can solve this problem in two different ways.
Way 1. We apply the superposition principle.
We have three independent sources; thus we have to solve three auxiliary
circuits. In the ﬁrst one, shown in Fig.7.20a, only the voltage source E1 is
turned on. The corresponding solution (R1 and R2 are connected in series in
the auxiliary circuit) is i(1) =
E1
R1 + R2
.
In the second auxiliary circuit, shown in Fig.7.20b, only the voltage source
E2 is turned on. The corresponding solution is i(2) = −
E2
R1 + R2
.
Finally, in the third auxiliary circuit, shown in Fig.7.20c, only the current
source A is turned on. The corresponding solution (according to the current
divider structure of this auxiliary circuit, Sect.3.6.2) is i(3) = −A
R2
R1 + R2
.

that the solution is the same as above.
We remark that each of the sources E1, E2, A may be constant or time-
varying.

Actually, we already applied the superposition principle before introducing it:
it happened in Sect.3.4, where we introduced the Thévenin and Norton equivalent
representations of two-terminal resistive components. In that case, the superposition
principle was applied only partially, by considering a ﬁrst input external to the two-
terminal element (current source i for Thévenin and voltage source v for Norton) and

204
7
Basic Concepts
all the internal independent sources as a single second input. You can check your
comprehension by solving again the case studies of Sect.3.4, by also applying the
superposition principle to the internal independent sources.
We remark that the superposition principle only works for output voltages and
currents but not for powers, because the power deﬁnition involves a nonlinear
operation (product) on voltages and currents. In other words, the sum of the powers
absorbed/delivered by a given component due to the action of each single independent
source is not the real power absorbed/delivered by that component. To calculate this
power properly, we should ﬁrst use the superposition principle to ﬁnd the current(s)
and voltage(s) involved in the power computation and then calculate the power.

Find the power p delivered by the voltage source E1 in the circuit shown
in Fig. 7.19.
The required power is p = E1i = E1
E1 −E2 −R2 A

. You can easily
check that if we applied the superposition principle to the powers delivered in
the three auxiliary circuits (p′ = E1i(1) + 0 · i(2) + 0 · i(3)), we would obtain
a wrong solution.
7.4
Substitution Principle
Another general principle valid under mild assumptions is the substitution principle.
It is yet another tool to substitute with a simpler model a part of a circuit we are not
interested to describe in detail. For instance, a housewife is not interested to know
what there is behind a wall socket: for her (and for a large part of us!) the socket can
be more simply represented by an ideal voltage source, which supplies the energy
required by an appliance for working properly.
In the case of memoryless circuits (linear or nonlinear, time-varying or time-
invariant), we can prove the following theorem.
Theorem 7.1 (Substitution theorem) We consider a memoryless circuit (network)
ℵthat can be decomposed into two complementary subnetworks (composite two-
terminals) S1 and S2, as shown in Fig.7.26. At the parallel connection between S1 and
S2 we can measure voltage v and current i. We assume that ℵadmits a unique solution
(v, i). Then, if S1 admits the current basis, S2 can be replaced by an independent
current source with impressed current i, as shown in Fig.7.27a. Analogously, if S1
admits the voltage basis, then S2 can be replaced by an independent voltage source
with impressed voltage v, as shown in Fig.7.27b.
The theorem states that, from the point of view of S1, there is no difference between
the circuit conﬁguration shown in Fig.7.26 and the one shown in Fig.7.27 (either a

or b). Once more, this means that, if we are not interested in what happens within S2,
we can represent more compactly this part of the original network ℵ, thus resorting
to a higher-level model.
Proof By assumption, there exists a unique solution (v, i). Then, by deﬁnition of
basis (Sect.3.3.4), if the memoryless composite two-terminal S1 admits the current
basis, its descriptive current i can be arbitrarily assigned and its descriptive voltage
v is obtained univocally. Moreover, if the independent current source admits the
voltage basis, then it is compatible with any voltage v.
A similar reasoning can be applied, mutatis mutandis, if S1 admits the voltage
basis. ⊓⊔

Practical Rules
In this section we introduce some further practical rules that can be useful to make
handling the most common circuit structures simpler.
7.5.1
Millmann’s Rule
The reference circuit for the application of Millmann’s rule is shown in Fig.7.28.
It consists of a ﬁnite number K of branches connected in parallel, each of which
contains a Thévenin equivalent, that is, a voltage source Ei in series with a resistor
Ri (i = 1, . . . , K).
The voltage v common to all the branches can be easily obtained as follows.

impressed by the ith Norton current source is Ei/Ri.
• Determine the resulting current source A and the equivalent resistance R

Some Comments and Generalizations
Once the voltage v is known, the current through each resistor Ri can be obtained
immediately. This is evident observing the circuit of Fig.7.29a.
If one of the branches (say the kth branch) in the circuit of Fig.7.28 contains only
the resistor Rk (i.e., when Ek = 0), we must remove the term Ek/Rk at the numerator
of Eq.7.3.
Millmann’s rule can be easily extended to the case in which one or more branches
of the circuit are constituted by a current source. For example, in the circuit of
Fig.7.30 the expression Eq.7.3 changes as follows.

Two-Ports with T −Π Structure
Among the most common two-ports containing two-terminals as building blocks, the
ones shown in Figs.7.31 and 7.32 are particularly interesting. The ﬁrst one is usually
known as a T (or “star”, or “wye”, or Y) structure; the second one is known as a
Π (or “mesh”, or “delta”, or Δ) structure. In both cases, the ports have a common
terminal. In the following, unless otherwise speciﬁed, we adopt the term T for the
ﬁrst and the term Π for the second structure. In the general case, the two-terminal
elements a, b, c may be of a different kind, but here we focus on the case where they
are linear resistors.

Note that the two-port is reciprocal (R12 = R21). This is a direct consequence of
the fact that all components are reciprocal. (See Theorem 3.1.)
From Eq.7.4 we have:
ra = R11 −R12;
rb = R22 −R12;
rc = R12 = R21.
(7.5)
Therefore, given the matrix R of a reciprocal two-port and assuming that the ports
have a common terminal, you can get the resistance values (ra,rb,rc) of the elements
of the equivalent T structure. This structure can be realized by standard resistors as
long as the resistance values are positive (or null). Therefore, the following inequal-
ities must be satisﬁed:
R12 ≥0;
R11 ≥R12;
R22 ≥R12.

T ⇄Π Transformations
Suppose that a given two-port can be represented equivalently by both a T -structure
(R matrix) and a Π-structure (G matrix). In this case, we must have GR = I, where
I denotes the 2 × 2 identity matrix. This is the basis for expressing the parameters
of the Π structure in terms of those of the T structure and vice versa.
7.5.3.1
T →Π Transformation
In this case we consider as known the parameters ra,rb,rc of the T structure of
Fig.7.33. To obtain the parameters ga, gb, gc of the corresponding Π structure
(Fig.7.35), we ﬁrst set G = R−1. From Eqs.7.4 and 7.6 we have

Eq.7.7, it is easy to obtain ga, gb, gc. For example, we have

The structure shown in Fig.7.39a is called a lattice structure for obvious reasons. It
can be redrawn as in Fig.7.39b, that is, in the form of the so-called bridge structure.
One or the other representation is adopted, depending on convenience.

representation of a balanced
bridge
Inasmuch as all the elements of the bridge are two-terminal resistors, the structure
is reciprocal (Theorem 3.1) and we have R21 = R12. With a procedure similar to that
followed for R11, we ﬁnally have
R22 = (ra + rc)(rb + rd)
ra + rb + rc + rd
.
As a general comment, the minus sign in the numerator of the expression of R12
and R21 implies the possibility that these terms are null or negative, in spite of the
positiveness of ra,rb,rc,rd.
When the condition rard = rbrc holds, we have R12 = R21 = 0 and the bridge is
called balanced. In this case, the matrix R becomes:
R =

with
R11 = rc(ra + rb)

and
R22 = rb(ra + rc)

In this case, the two ports become uncoupled (i.e., the two-port is zero-directional)
and the bridge reduces to two separate resistors, as shown in Fig.7.42.
Another situation of interest is when one port (say port 1) is connected to a voltage
source E1 and the second port is left unconnected (open-ended). This is shown in
Fig.7.43. Under this condition, the voltage ratio α between v2 and v1 is

(Resistive) Ladder Structures
The resistive structure shown in Fig.7.44a is very appropriately denoted as a ladder
structure. It can be thought of as a chain of a generic number of two-ports called cells
(in general different from each other for parameters). The kth cell is represented in
Fig.7.44b together with its port variables.
The voltages and currents in a ladder network within a circuit can be easily studied
by choosing one among many methods. One of them is based on the transmission
matrices T1, ..., Tn of the cells. Referring to Fig.7.44b and to Sect.5.3.4 the matrix
Tk for the kth cell is:
Tk =
⎛
⎜⎜⎜⎝

(7.8)
The way to use the matrices Tk (k = 1, . . . , n) is described in the case study below.
For the sake of comparison, the analysis of the same circuit is also carried out with
another method.

Case Study
In the circuit of Fig. 7.45, ﬁnd the voltages v3 and v4 in terms of the source
voltage E. The resistance values of the ladder are: Ra1 = 5Ω; Ra2 = Ra3 =
3Ω; Rb1 = Rb2 = 2Ω; Rb3 = 1Ω.
Way 1. For the assigned parameter values, from Eq.7.8 we obtain the matri-
ces T1, T2, T3:
T1 =

⎛

Because v1 = E and i4 = 0, we immediately write E = T11v4 + T12 · 0;
then v4 =
2
121 E. By this result and making use of T3 we write v3 = T311v4 +
T312 · 0 and ﬁnally v3 = 4v4 =
8
121 E. The values of the other voltages and
currents in the circuit can be found similarly.
Way 2. All the voltages and currents of the circuit are expressed preliminar-
ily in terms of the unknown voltage v4 at the end of the ladder, going up with
an iterative procedure from v4 to the voltage E. The various steps are easily
described in sequence making reference to the ladder elements in Fig.7.45 and
observing that Rb3 and Ra3 are connected in series:
i3 = v4
Rb3
;
v3 = (Ra3 + Rb3)i3;
i2 = i3 + v3
Rb2
; v2 = Ra2i2 + v3;
i1 = i2 + v2
Rb1
; E = Ra1i1 + v2.
Using the numerical values of the parameters, the previous expressions
give:
v3 = 4v4;
v2 = 13v4;
E = 121
2 v4.

7.5.5.1
Iterative Resistance
Iterative resistance is the resistance R at one port of a two-port when the other port is
connected to an inﬁnite chain of identical two-ports, as shown in Fig.7.46a. Because
the chain is assumed to be inﬁnite, iterative resistance is also the resistance value R
of an equivalent resistor connected to port 2, as shown in Fig.7.46b.
Making reference to Fig.7.46b, the value R of the iterative resistance must fulﬁll
the condition:
R = Ra +
RRb
R + Rb
that is: R2 −RRa −Ra Rb = 0.
The two solutions of this second-degree algebraic equation are:
Ra

In general, the iterative resistance of port 1 is not equal to the iterative resistance
of port 2: an inﬁnite chain of two-ports beginning with port 2, as shown in Fig.7.47a,
has an iterative resistance ˆR that can be calculated through the circuit of Fig.7.47b.
The obvious condition is:
ˆR = Rb(Ra + ˆR)
Rb + Ra + ˆR
that is
ˆR2 + ˆRRa −RbRa = 0.
The only positive solution for this equation is:
ˆR = Ra

Therefore we have ˆR ̸= R (more precisely, we have ˆR < R as you can immediately
check).
As a ﬁnal remark, we observe that the cells of Figs.7.46a and 7.47a are only
two of the possible building blocks for an inﬁnite ladder. The general constituent
two-port has the “T” structure delimited by the gray box in Fig.7.48, where δ is
a parameter that ranges in the domain [0, 1]. The previously considered cells, in
particular, correspond to the parameter values δ = 1 and δ = 0, respectively. For any
value of δ within the range [0, 1], the condition giving the iterative resistance R is
R = Raδ + Rb [(1 −δ) Ra + R]
(1 −δ) Ra + R + Rb
.
As an exercise, you can ﬁnd the corresponding second-degree algebraic equation
and check that its positive solutions for δ = 1 and δ = 0 correspond to the previously
found values.

Iterative Resistance and the Cell’s T Matrix
The iterative resistance of the cell is closely related to the eigenvalues of the transmis-
sion matrix T . For the cell represented in Fig.7.46b, the physical condition deﬁning
the iterative value R is:
v1
i1
= v2
−i2

(7.9)
then the two vectors y = (v1 i1)T and x = (v2 −i2)T must be collinear; that is,
y = λx, as sketched in Fig.7.49. Their proportionality can now be interpreted in
terms of the general relation y = T x:
 y = λx
y = T x ; then T x = λx.
Therefore the voltage and current components of both x and y must be thought of as
the components of an eigenvector of the matrix T . In terms of the vector x, we have

8.1
From Mesh to Loop Currents: A Graph-Based
Generalization
One of the necessary conditions to carry out the mesh analysis of a circuit (consisting
only of two-terminal elements) is that it can be drawn on a sheet without crossings
between components. This means that its graph is planar and allows unambiguously
identifying the meshes (which are independent and form a basis) and drawing all the
mesh currents.
A more general formulation, also valid for nonplanar circuits (graphs), can now be
given. According to this formulation, the mesh currents can be viewed as a particular
case of the so-called loop currents. Each loop current ﬂows through a speciﬁc loop in
thecircuit’sgraph,anditsorientation(ingeneral,free)canbeﬁxedinanunambiguous
way even when the graph is not planar.
The structure of each loop associated with a loop current depends on the initial
partition into a tree and its respective cotree chosen for the graph. For a directed
graph with L edges and N nodes, the number of loop currents is L −N + 1. This
number coincides with the dimension of the null space N (A) of the matrix A. (See
Sect.2.2.4.) The set of loop currents constitutes one of the possible bases for N (A).
This can be easily shown through an example. Consider the graph of Fig.8.1a.
For the tree choice shown in Fig.8.1b, following the procedure deﬁned in Sect.2.2.1,
the cut-set matrix A is

Therefore, each current vector i compatible with the graph must be such that

The column vectors x1, x2, x3 can be used to obtain the compatible vector iT of
currents on the tree edges in terms of the iC components. For any given set iC of
currents on the cotree edges b, e, f we have:
iT = −αiC = −ibx1 −iex2 −i f x3.
Now, by setting to zero in the previous expression all the coefﬁcients ib, ie, i f except
one in all possible ways, we can obtain each loop current and the structure of the
loop where it ﬂows in the graph.
• For ib = j1 ̸= 0 and ie = i f = 0, we have iC = j1 (1 0 0)T and

Therefore, the current vector i corresponds to the loop current j1 ﬂowing through
the edges b, g, d, h and oriented as the cotree edge b, as shown in Fig.8.2.

i = j2 (0 1 0 −1 1 −1 0)T .
The loop current j2 ﬂows through the edges e, a, g, d and is oriented as the
cotree edge e, as shown in Fig.8.3. Note that the loop e, a, g, d is not a mesh.
• For i f = j3 ̸= 0 and ib = ie = 0, we have iC = j3 (0 0 1)T and

i = j3 (0 0 1 1 −1 0 0)T .
The loop current j3 ﬂows through the edges f, a, g and is oriented as the cotree
edge f , as shown in Fig.8.4.
Although the example refers to a planar graph for simplicity, the process used to
obtain the loop currents is completely general and applies equally well to nonplanar
graphs. Thus the loop currents represent a generalization of the mesh currents, which
can be deﬁned without ambiguity only in the case of a planar graph.1 Choosing
a different partition of the graph into a tree and cotree generates another set of

Tableau Method for Linear Time-Invariant Resistive
Circuits
As shown in the ﬁrst chapter, the most general method to ﬁnd the complete solution
(i.e., each descriptive current and voltage, collected in the vectors i and v, resp.) of
a circuit is solving a set of independent topological equations (KVLs and KCLs),
together with the set of descriptive equations related to all the components contained
in the circuit.
In Chap.2, it was shown that a possible way to obtain a set of independent topolog-
ical equations is based on the fundamental matrices. In particular (see also Fig.3.1),
Ai = 0N−1
(N −1 independent KCLs in the unknowns i)
(8.2)
and
Bv = 0L−N+1
(L −N + 1 independent KVLs in the unknowns v)
(8.3)
where 0K denotes the zero vector with K entries. Considering now the L descriptive
equations (see Fig.3.1), we know (see Chap.3) that the most general way to express
them for a memoryless circuit is the implicit form. Then for a linear time-invariant
resistive circuit (i.e., a circuit containing only linear, time-invariant, memoryless
components, and independent sources; see Sect.3.3.3), the descriptive equations can
be expressed as
H vv + Hii = ˆu(t)
(L independent equations in the unknowns v and i)
(8.4)

physical dimensions and ˆu(t) is an L-size vector whose (physically hybrid) entries
are either zeros or impressed currents/voltages. In particular, if the circuit contains
P independent sources, the vector ˆu(t) will have L −P null components.
For instance, for Case Study 1 in Sect.7.3 with the complete set of unknowns
shown in Fig.8.5, the descriptive equations for the ﬁve circuit components are:
v1 = E1
v2 = E2

Instead, if matrix Q is singular (rank(Q) < 2L), the circuit solution either does
not exist or is not unique and in this case the circuit is commonly said to be patholog-
ical. This means that the circuit contains at least one absurd connection of compo-
nents, such as a loop of independent voltage sources, a cut-set of independent current
sources, or a connection of components not compatible with the admitted basis or
bases (e.g., an ideal transformer connected to both ports to two independent voltage
sources or to two independent current sources).
As an example, taking R1 = R2 = 0 in the circuit of Fig.8.5 (the corresponding
graph edges remain unchanged), matrix Q becomes singular (rank(Q) = 2L −1)
and both spaces N (Q) and N (QT ) are one-dimensional. (See Sect.2.2.3.) More
precisely, we have:
R2L = R(Q) ⊕N (QT );
dim(N (QT )) = dim(N (Q)) = 1
This means that the homogeneous equation Qx = 0 admits nontrivial solutions
x0 ∈N (Q).
In the circuit, voltage sources E1 and E2 are now connected in parallel, therefore:
• For E1 ̸= E2, the parallel connection of the voltage sources violates the KVL.
In terms of matrix algebra, writing Eq.8.7 as Qx = b for ease of reference, it
could be shown that the vector b has a component in the space N (QT ), whereas
any product Qx generates a vector in the (complementary) space R(Q); then the
equation Qx = b has no solutions.
• When E1 = E2 the parallel connection of the voltage sources does not imply
a violation of the KVL and b ∈R(Q), then equation Qx = b can be solved.
However, the currents i1 and i2 ﬂowing through identical sources (or through short
circuits, in the particular case when E1 = E2 = 0) can take any value such that
i1 + i2 = A. In other terms, given two elements i1 and i2 = A −i1 of the solution
vector x, we can obtain a new solution by simply replacing i1 with i1 + i0 and
i2 with i2 −i0 for any value of i0, which means that the solution vector x is not
unique; this amounts to saying that the addition of any vector x0 ∈N (Q) to a
solution x generates a new solution x + x0:
Q(x + x0) = Qx + Qx0

We remark that only P of the L vectors ˆu(k) have one component different from 0.
The other L −P vectors have only null entries, thus the sum has only P signiﬁcant
terms. Because the names of the vectors ˆu(k) are completely arbitrary, we can assume
without loss of generality that the signiﬁcant vectors are the ﬁrst P and that ˆu(t) =

source (corresponding to ˆu(k)) and turning off all the other independent sources. □

Equivalent Representations of Memoryless Multiports
In this section, we generalize the concepts introduced in Sect.3.4 for a memoryless
two-terminal element to memoryless multiports. Also in this case, we aim to ﬁnd a
macromodel (i.e., an equivalent representation with the same descriptive equations
but a simpliﬁed internal structure) of a portion of a linear time-invariant resistive
circuit.

circuit represented as the

and n two-terminals
Fig. 8.7 Thévenin
equivalent representation (in
black) of the n-port ℵshown
in Fig.8.6
We start by pointing out the presence of the n-port ℵwithin the circuit, as shown
in Fig.8.6. The picture is completed by n two-terminal (or one-port) macromodels
ℵj ( j = 1, . . . , n) representing the remaining parts of the original circuit.
General assumptions: Owing to the hypothesis of a linear time-invariant resis-
tive circuit, we assume that ℵcan contain only linear, time-invariant, memoryless
components, and independent sources.
Temporary assumption: We also assume (only temporarily) that the circuit does
not contain any controlled source. We remove this assumption later on.
There is also a further speciﬁc assumption about the basis admitted by ℵ, which is
made in each of the following subsections. We remark that the proofs of the theorems
provided therein are based on both the substitution principle (see Sect.7.4) and the
superposition theorem (see Sect.8.3).
8.4.1
Thévenin Equivalent Representation of Memoryless
Multiports
Theorem 8.2 (Thévenin equivalent representation of memoryless multiports) Given
an n-port ℵsatisfying the general assumptions listed above and admitting the current
basis, it can be represented equivalently by an n-port with the structure shown in
Fig.8.7.

8.4 Equivalent Representations of Memoryless Multiports
235
Fig. 8.8 Step 1 (substitution
principle)
Fig. 8.9 Step 2a (ﬁrst
auxiliary circuit)
Proof The proof is based on two steps.
Step 1. Because ℵadmits the current basis, we can substitute each two-terminal
ℵj ( j = 1, . . . , n) with an independent current source i j, as shown in Fig.8.8.
Step 2. Now we apply the superposition theorem to ﬁnd the expressions of the
port voltages v j in terms of port currents and parameters of ℵ: this possibility is
ensured by the fact that ℵadmits the current basis. Due to the general assumptions
about the composition of ℵand to the speciﬁc assumption about the admitted basis,
its descriptive equations will have the following structure:
v = eT + Ri
(8.12)
where eT is a vector of n terms that are independent of the port currents i and R is
an n × n matrix of real and constant coefﬁcients.
In the following, the n-port ℵwith all the internal sources turned off is denoted
ℵ0.
Step 2a. We obtain a ﬁrst auxiliary circuit (Fig.8.9) by turning off all the cur-
rent sources i j ( j = 1, . . . , n) and considering the contribution to v j due to all the
independent sources contained within ℵ. In other words, in this auxiliary circuit
all ports are connected to open circuits (current sources turned off) and the corre-
sponding open-circuit voltage on the jth port is the jth component of the vector eT
in Eq.8.12. This term depends only on the impressed currents and voltages of the
independent sources internal to ℵand on the parameters of the other components
within ℵ. Of course, if the internal structure of ℵwere known, we could consider
one contribution for each independent source and the sum of all these terms would
be eT j.
Step 2b. We now obtain other n auxiliary circuits: the kth auxiliary circuit
(Fig.8.10) is obtained by turning off all the sources internal to ℵ(thus obtaining ℵ0)
and all the port current sources but ik. The correspondingcontribution to v j (say v(k)
j )

has the physical dimension of a resistance
and is an element of the matrix R in Eq.8.12.
As an alternative (see Sect.5.3.1 for n = 2), one can directly obtain the descriptive
equations of the linear, time-invariant, and memoryless two-port ℵ0 and identify from
them the R entries.
Step 2c. Finally, we sum the contributions provided by the auxiliary circuits and
obtain the expression of the port voltage v j ( j = 1, . . . , n):

(8.15)
This equation allows us easily to obtain the Thévenin equivalent representation
of ℵ: it tells us that the port voltage v j is given by the sum of a voltage eT j, which
is independent of the port currents and can be interpreted as an independent voltage
source, and of a voltage v
′
j, which can be interpreted as the jth port voltage of
the n-port ℵ0, obtained by turning off all the internal independent sources of ℵand
described by the resistance matrix R. This corresponds to the n-port shown in Fig.8.7.
□
Remark 1. Step 2 in the proof requires the linearity assumption of ℵ, but nothing
is said about the two-terminals ℵj ( j = 1, . . . , n) representing the remaining parts
of the original circuit. In fact, they could also be nonlinear, as often happens in
electronic circuits.
Remark 2. Equation8.12 is nothing but a generalization of Eq.3.20, which is
related to a two-terminal (particular case of n-port for n = 1) admitting the current

basis and made up of linear, time-invariant, and memoryless components and inde-
pendent sources. The n-port ℵ0 is compactly described by the resistance matrix R,
whereas the contributions due to the internal sources are represented by the vector
eT .
Remark 3. If we remove the temporary assumption stated above and we admit
the presence of controlled sources within ℵ, we have two possible cases:
• If the driving variable of a given controlled source belongs to ℵ(i.e., it is either
an inner variable or a port variable), from the ℵstandpoint this source is in fact a
controlled source and it is treated as such.
• On the contrary, if the driving variable is an inner variable of one of the two-
terminals ℵj ( j = 1, . . . , n), from the ℵstandpoint this source is actually an inde-
pendent source (there is no evidence of the presence of a driving variable, in ℵ) and
it is treated as such; that is, it is turned off together with the independent sources
during Step 2b.
Remark 4. Equation8.12 holds for the Thévenin equivalent shown in Fig.8.7. If
the jth voltage source in Fig.8.7 is connected upside down, there is just a change of
sign in the corresponding component of the vector eT , but we follow the same line
of reasoning. This is apparent in Case Studies 2 and 3 below.
Remark 5. The proof provides a method to obtain the Thévenin equivalent rep-
resentation of memoryless multiports, as shown in the next case studies.
Case Study 1
Find the Thévenin equivalent of the two-port shown in Fig.8.11.
We can solve this problem in two different ways.
Way 1. We ﬁnd the descriptive equations of the two-port in the form v =
eT + Ri and we identify vector eT and matrix R. This is left to the reader as
an exercise.
Way 2. We analyze two simpler auxiliary circuits.
The ﬁrst one (with port currents set to 0 through open circuits and port
voltages equal to eT ) is shown in Fig.8.12a and can be easily solved, thus
ﬁnding eT 1 =

The circuit in Fig.8.18a is nonlinear because of the presence of the diode in
ℵ1. The two-port ℵcontains a CCVS whose driving current i0 is just the diode’s
current; in any case, because i0 is external to ℵ, the descriptive equations of
the two-port can be obtained considering the CCVS as independent as well as
the voltage source E2. The remaining components of ℵare linear. Under the

and admitting the voltage basis, it can be represented equivalently by an n-port with

Proof Also in this case, the proof is based on two steps.
Step 1. Because ℵadmits the voltage basis, we can substitute each two-terminal
ℵj ( j = 1, . . . , n) with an independent voltage source v j, as shown in Fig.8.21.
Step 2. Now we apply the superposition theorem to ﬁnd the expressions of the
port currents i j in terms of port voltages and parameters of ℵ: this possibility is
ensured by the fact that ℵadmits the voltage basis. Due to thegeneral assumptions

where aN is a vector of n terms that are independent of the port voltages v and G is
an n × n matrix of real and constant coefﬁcients.

8.4 Equivalent Representations of Memoryless Multiports

Step 2a. We obtain a ﬁrst auxiliary circuit (Fig.8.22) by turning off all the voltage
sources v j ( j = 1, . . . , n) and consider the contribution to i j due to all the indepen-
dent sources contained within ℵ. In other words, in this auxiliary circuit all ports
are connected to short circuits (voltage sources turned off) and the corresponding
short-circuit current on the jth port is the jth component of the vector aN in Eq.8.16.
This term depends only on the impressed currents and voltages of the independent
sources internal to ℵand on the parameters of the other components within ℵ. Of
course, if the internal structure of ℵwere known, we could consider one contribution
for each independent source and the sum of all these terms would be aN j.
Step 2b. We now obtain other n auxiliary circuits: the kth auxiliary circuit (Fig.
8.23) is obtained by turning off all the sources internal to ℵ(thus obtaining ℵ0) and
all the port voltage sources but vk. The corresponding contribution to i j (say i(k)
j ) is
obtained as follows.
i(k)
j
= i j

ℵ=ℵ0 & v j=0 for each j̸=k
(8.17)
Because vk ̸= 0, we can write that
i(k)

ℵ=ℵ0 & v j=0 for each j̸=k

vk

ℵ=ℵ0 & v j=0 for each j̸=k
has the physical dimension of a conduc-
tance and is an element of the matrix G in Eq.8.16.
As an alternative (see Sect.5.3.2 for n = 2), one can directly obtain the descriptive
equations of the linear, time-invariant, and memoryless two-port ℵ0 and identify from
them the G entries.
Step 2c. Finally, we sum the contributions provided by the auxiliary circuits and
obtain the expression of the port current i j ( j = 1, . . . , n):

This equation allows us easily to obtain the Norton equivalent representation of
ℵ: it tells us that the port current i j is given by the sum of a current aN j, which is
independent of the port voltages and can be interpreted as an independent current
source, and of a current i
′
j, which can be interpreted as the jth port current of the n-
port ℵ0 obtained by turning off all the internal independent sources of ℵand described
by the conductance matrix G. This corresponds to the n-port shown in Fig.8.20. □

Case Study 1
Find the Norton equivalent of the composite two-port shown in Fig.8.11.
Also in this case, we can solve this problem in two different ways.
Way 1. We ﬁnd the descriptive equations of the two-port in the form i =
aN + Gv and we identify vector aN and matrix G. This is left to the reader as
an exercise.
Way 2. We analyze two simpler auxiliary circuits.
The ﬁrst one (with port voltages set to 0 through short circuits and port
currents equal to aN) is shown in Fig.8.24 and can be easily solved, thus
ﬁnding aN1 = −E

Hybrid Equivalent Representations of Memoryless
Multiports
Theorem 8.4 (Hybrid equivalent representation of memoryless multiports) Given
an n-port ℵsatisfying the general assumptions listed at the beginning of Sect.8.4
and admitting a mixed basis, it can be represented equivalently by an n-port ℵ0
(obtained by ℵturning off all the internal independent sources and described by a
hybrid matrix) with either a voltage source in series (as for the Thévenin equivalent)
or a current source in parallel (as for the Norton equivalent) to each port, according
to the admitted mixed basis.
The proof is completely similar to the Thévenin and Norton cases and is not
reported here.
For the case of memoryless two-ports (n = 2), the two possible hybrid equivalent
representations are shown in Fig.8.31.
8.5
Summarizing Comments
Most of the results proposed in this chapter rely on the linearity assumption. Despite
the fundamental laws of physics are often assumed to be linear, the real world is
usually nonlinear: then the linearity assumption can have validity limits, more or less
hard, as pointed out at the beginning of this book (Sect. 1.1). Whenever possible,
it is useful to resort to this assumption in order to exploit analysis tools that are
available only for linear circuits and systems.2 In this perspective, linearity can be
either an intrinsic property of a given physical system or, more commonly, a working
assumption with validity limits that must be known. As an example for the ﬁrst case,
the electric ﬁeld vector E originated by a set of charges in the free space can be
obtained by summing the ﬁeld contributions of the individual charges, thanks to the
linearity of the electric ﬁeld equations. As to the second case, a physical resistor
maintains its linear behavior until the current through it does not cause overheating,
which alters the resistance value (and makes it dependent on the current magnitude)
or destroys it (as occurs for an electric fuse). Similarly, the variation of a spring
length depends linearly on the applied force (Hooke’s law) as long as this force
2In his Lectures on Physics, while introducing linear systems, the Nobel laureate Richard Feynman
writes: “[· · · ] linear systems are so important [· · · ] because we can solve them” [1].

8.5 Summarizing Comments

does not exceed a certain limit. Beyond this limit the change in length no longer
follows a linear law. Furthermore, for large variations with respect to the length of
the undeformed spring, the elasticity assumption for the spring is no longer valid and
permanent deformations may occur.
The main advantage of linear systems is that they can be broken down into parts
(e.g., the auxiliary circuits we introduced with the superposition principle) that can be
solved separately: the overall solution is a linear combination of the partial solutions
obtained in this way. This is the essence of the superposition principle, which allows
greatly simplifying complex problems. In other words, a linear system is equal to the
sum of these parts. Actually, it has been known for many centuries that often, “The
whole is more than the sum of its parts,” which is the abridged version of the sentence,
“The totality is not, as it were, a mere heap, but the whole is something besides the
parts.” [2]. In fact, most of everyday life is nonlinear and the superposition principle
fails due to interferences, competitions, and cooperations between “parts”.
There are many examples coming from the real world, for instance, the emergence
of ﬂocking, swarming, and schooling in groups of agents (e.g., birds, ﬁsh, penguins,
ants, bees, bacteria) that follow three basic heuristic rules: cohesion (attempting
to stay close to nearby agents), collision avoidance, and velocity matching [3–5].
Despite the fact that each agent tries to follow these very simple rules and has only
local interactions with the other agents, the overall behaviors turn out to fulﬁll dif-
ferent main optimization criteria such as time, energy, and predation risk in different
situations [6]. Other familiar examples are concerned with [7–9]:
• Consciousness, which is an emergent property that engages incredibly high num-
bers of neurons (corresponding to agents) and synapses (corresponding to local
connections)
• Magnetism, which emerges from the collective behavior of millions of spins
• Large-scale electrical blackouts, resulting from a cascading series of failures in
electrical power grids
• Spread of information and disease, strongly affected by structure and dynamics of
animal social networks
• Extinction of living groups, resulting from the interactions between the elements
of food chains
• Spread of computer viruses, depending on both the Internet structure and the
behaviors of computer users
• Trafﬁc jams, emerging from car drivers interacting on urban streets
In all cases, the “whole” depends on both the topology (structure of the hardware
infrastructure and the interactions between agents/parts) and the agent/part individual
way of functioning/behaving. This is an aspect common to linear and nonlinear
systems. But for linear systems (including circuits), the individual behaviors are
simple and there cannot be surprising behaviors emerging from their connections.
Moreover,inthecircuitsconsideredinthisbook,mostcomponentsaretime-invariant,
which in turn greatly simpliﬁes the analysis, excluding the possibility of changes in
both network topology and component behaviors.

Fig. 8.32 Problem 8.1
The difﬁculties increase more and more as far as we introduce in a network (of any
kind) nonlinear agents/parts and plasticity in the interactions (i.e., time variance in
the network topology). We had a taste of this in Sect.3.2.5, when we analyzed simple
circuits containing a diode: in order to solve these circuits analytically, we had to
resort to piecewise-linear approximations of the diode DP characteristic. But doing
this simply means that we replace the originally smooth nonlinear DP characteristic
with linear approximations that are valid under some limits (voltage/current range);
outside a given range, we change the linear approximation.
This is the simplest way to maintain both many advantages of the linearity and
the nonlinear nature of the circuit. This is also the working principle of many circuit
simulators, which simulate nonlinear circuits iteratively, bringing them back to an
equivalent linear circuit at each iteration. It may take many iterations before the
calculations converge to a solution.
We remark that the increase in complexity in the nonlinear case can be twigged
in memoryless circuits, but it will become more and more evident when considering
dynamical circuits and systems in Volume 2.

2.3 We have 5 unknown currents and 3 independent KCLs, then 2 independent cur-
rents, say i and i3. If we measure i3, i cannot be determined. The graph of Fig.2.26b
is the same as for the circuit of Fig.2.26a, then, one can apply Tellegen’s theorem,
thus ﬁnding: ˆv1i1 + ˆv2i2 + ˆv3i3 + ˆv4i + ˆv5i4 = 0. Taking into account the KCLs
(i2 = i3, i1 = −i −i3, and i4 = i), one ﬁnds (ˆv4 + ˆv5 −ˆv1)i = (ˆv1 −ˆv2 −ˆv3)i3.
But KVLs imply that the terms between brackets are identically zero, thus it is not
possible to determine i knowing i3.
2.4 The graph has N = 6 nodes and L = 8 edges. Thus it has L −N + 1 = 3
fundamental loops and N −1 = 5 fundamental cut-sets and as many tree edges.
