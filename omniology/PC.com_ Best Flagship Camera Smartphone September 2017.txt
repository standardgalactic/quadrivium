EDITOR’S NOTE
A WORD 
FROM
THE 
EDITORIAL 
TEAM
Editor’s Review pg.58
H
ello from the team! 
September marks three quarters of the year and 
the tech scene isn’t slowing down! One of the biggest 
announcements this month, we have Samsung launching 
its long-awaited Galaxy Note 8. Flip to page 36 to find out how the 
device looks like. 
With a rumoured price tag of close to RM5,000, the Note 8 
seems to be joining the ranks of latest premium smartphones with a 
price tag breaching the RM 3,000 mark. That is also the topic for our 
cover story this issue. With the price of premium flagship phones 
steadily increasing, are the devices really worth its worthy price 
tag? We break it down on page 44. 
Besides a wallet slimming price tag, smartphone 
manufacturers are also competing for camera quality. Well, more 
than just letting the companies tell us which phone carries the best 
cameras – we pitched them head to head with a shootout. Wanna 
know which phones gives you the best photos? Zoom in to page 83 
for the Showdown. 
While the tech giants rake in big money from sales of its 
latest devices, many startups take to Kickstarter for the next big 
venture. From wireless speakers to hi-tech jackets, we look at some 
of the projects worth over a million dollars USD. Curious? Page 49 
has it all.
Fresh from our labs this month we gave the newly released 
ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro a spin – all the way from Taiwan! Also 
featured in Tested this issue we have the mod king – Moto Z2 Play, 
as well as the Huawei Watch 2 and the DJI Spark. All that and more 
starting from page 56. 
On the gaming end, Persona 5 stole our hearts this month. 
We’d be reluctant to disclose any more than that – just forward to 
page 102. We also dropped by PSX, the Playstation Experience, to 
see what Sony has in store for the upcoming season. That and more 
gaming news from page 110. 
All that and more, serving right up!
P.s. If you’re curious about who are the winners of our Wiko 
Merdeka Contest, head over to page 26.

Huawei Nova 2 Plus. You can also read our review on the ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro and Nova 2 Plus in our ‘Tested’

Is the Samsung Note 8 worth buying or should I wait 
for the iPhone 8? I’m currently using the iPhone 7.
Subject 
Samsung Note 8 or iPhone 8?
If you’re a long-time iPhone user, it would be best to stick with the iPhone 8 as you are already familiar with how 
the device works whereas switching from the iOS to Android platform would definitely take some getting used to. 
In the end, it’s all about your personal preference and which you’re comfortable with. Happy shopping Sharlini!

1.8GHz quad-core 64-bit CPU, which 
provides enough power without any 
deterioration in performance. Aside 
from two USB 3.0 ports, the GT-AC5300 
features an eight-port gigabit-LAN 
switch to provide all the connections 
necessary (two of which are dedicated 
gaming ports to maximise network 
traffic for gaming).

ith this being only his second 
time in Malaysia and the 
first ever time stepping 
foot into Kuala Lumpur, the 
Vice President of Handset Business for 
the Huawei Consumer Business Group, 
Bruce Lee talks about Huawei’s upcoming 
flagship, amongst other things.
Although nothing was neither 
confirmed nor denied when it came to 
the eagerly-anticipated flagship, the 
soon-to-be-revealed Mate 10 will feature 
Huawei’s latest HiSilicon Kirin 970 
chipset. Alongside that, the Mate 10 will 
come with an increase in performance, 
endurance and a more compact screen 
without compromising on size.
The focus of the Kirin 970 chipset 
looks towards doubling on the performance 
that was set from its predecessor, the Kirin 
960, which was used in the Huawei P10, P10 
Plus and even the Honor 8 and Honor 8 Pro. 
Aside from boosting performance levels, 
Huawei will be looking to reduce the power 
consumption on its Kirin chipsets, which will 
benefit Huawei users to have smartphones 
with longer-lasting battery lifespans.
4G and 5G networks are also 
a topic for discussion with Lee, who 
talks about the need for more 4G and 
5G networks, which will be able to get 
the most out of Huawei smartphones. 
Aside from giving greater speeds and 
faster downloads, 5G networks will 
also feature lower transmission latency 
and even lower power consumption on 
Huawei smartphones, making it an ideal 
choice for consumers. Lee is also looking 
to leverage on its partnership with 
Android to ensure future devices will 
run smoothly on the EMUI 5.0 operating 
software and beyond. 
After getting the burning questions 
about the Mate 10 out of the way, Lee also 
touches on how Huawei smartphones will 
be integrated with artificial intelligence 
(AI) as he hopes to further introduce AI 
into more aspects in the future. In terms of 
technological innovation, Lee talks about the 
rising popularity of Type-C USBs and views it 
as a potential trend in the future.

Fashion Goes Digital
 Epson print technology empowers fashion designers during KL Fashion Week 
he world of fashion and digital 
printing collides as award-winning 
fashion designer Melinda Looi 
and Espon Malaysia came 
together on the runway of the Kuala 
Lumpur Fashion Week (KLFW) 2017. 
 
Showcasing 
an 
innovative 
collaboration through THE INTERIORS 
collection, Looi draws inspiration from the 
decorative elements and components of 
interior space, and translating them digital 
textile printing via Epson’s SureColor 
F-series digital textile dye sublimation 
printer. A total of 20 creations were 
featured during the runway show. 
The use of Epson printers gave Looi 
a wide range of flexibility and speed in 
trying out new print ideas, without the 
exorbitant cost and time consuming 
mould or frame-making that is required for 
conventional textile printing. 
Speaking 
more 
about 
how 
technology makes all these creative 
impulses possible, Looi says: “I believe that 
technology adds an incredible advantage 
to apply innovation in the fashion industry. 
A number of different technologies are 
currently being experimented with, such 
as 3D printing and I did launch Asia’s first 
3D printed fashion collection back in 2013. 
We even have e-textiles nowadays, with 
circuits built into it.”
Addressing the big trend in the 
fashion industry, which is ‘see now, buy 
now’, the designer believes that digital 
printing makes this much easier. 
She adds: “We do not have to print 
thousands of meters of fabric, only what 
is needed, when is needed. In fact, I am 
most impressed with the quality of prints 
by Epson’s digital textile dye sublimation 
printers, which is very clear, beautiful 
and durable on a wide range of textiles 
and surfaces we tried it on.”
Danny Lee, General Manager, Sale 
& Marketing, Epson Malaysia comments: 
“Working with Melinda Looi, who is known 
for her signature avant-garde style and her 
penchant for marrying prints into design, 
was perfect to showcase the versatility 
and capabilities of Epson’s digital textile 
printers and the opportunities it brings to 
the fashion industry.
“This 
collaboration 
continues 
our efforts from last year when we 
collaborated in a similar fashion with 
Zang Toi at the Malaysia Fashion 
Week 2016. As a leader in digital 
textile printing we want to support the 
creative industry in Malaysia to easily 
materialise any possible idea into a 
reality, and potentially, a business 
opportunity too.”

Introducing the Jaybird X3 and Freedom Headphones
he active lifestyle deserves 
good tunes and a proper set of 
headphones to match. Jaybird is 
a company that has been manufacturing 
sports buds for a better part of the 
decade. Is there a difference between 
regular earphones and sport earphones? 
Sweat is probably one of the worst 
enemies of tech, and for the earphones 
is no different. Jaybird’s earphones are 
designed to be sweat-proof. After its 
acquisition by Logitech, they are now 
officially available in Malaysia by way of 
a new distributor, Funsportz Sdn. Bhd. 
Jaybird introduces the X3 and 
Freedom wireless earphones. As we see 
more headphone jacks disappear from 
smartphones, wireless communication

The 
X3 
Sport 
Bluetooth 
Headphones brings larger sound, thanks 
to an enhanced 6mm driver, as well as 
its smaller size, making it the first in 
the X-Series to be helmet compatible. 
The redesigned enhanced-comfort ear 
fins and selection of ear tips provides 
a universal snug fit during the toughest 
of workouts. Thanks to Bluetooth 4.1 
connectivity, users can now pair two 
sets of X3 headphones to one device 
and even pair the X3 to two devices 
simultaneously. On a single charge, the 
battery will last eight hours. With the 
Jaybird app users can setup the sound 
profiles for their personal preference.
Meanwhile, the Freedom Wireless 
Bluetooth Buds Headphones combine 
sophisticated style, incredible sound and 
T
increased comfort in the smallest, advanced 
wireless earbuds which rivals anything in the

GREEN PRINTERS
OKI Data’s unwavering commitment of going 
green pays off with MyHIJAU certification
The MyHIJAU 
certified printers are 
available at selected 
authorised OKI 
partners. 
To find out more, visit 
the OKI website 
(www.oki.com.my) or 
call 1800-88-1177.
B
eing environmentally-conscious 
has always played a big part in OKI 
Data’s business strategy, whether it 
is through their services or products. 
Featuring a wide range of printers and 
multifunction printers (MFPs) in its repertoire 
of green products, OKI offers individuals 
and business owners printing solutions 
that are both efficient and cost-effective. 
Through the innovative LED technology 
in OKI printers and MFPs, which generates 
ample light on very little power, it allows the 
company to be energy efficient. The LED 
Technology enables the brand to also reduce the 
amount of plastic used in its printers, as well as 
making them have a smaller physical footprint. 
Always keeping its users in mind, its printers 
and MFPs are equipped with features and 
performance enhancing functions, all while 
keeping costs low. An example is the duplex 
printing function, which comes standard in its 
portfolio of green printers, as it enables users 
to reduce paper usage. Complementing this 
feature is its toner saving function that reduces 
toner consumption – making it possible to 
lessen the printers’ impact on the environment. 
Notably, another function that has 
contributed to OKI’s green efforts is the sleep 
mode function. By reducing energy consumption 
when the printers are not in operation, it helps 
users to save energy. Newer models in the 
category come equipped with a quiet mode to 
further reduce noise and energy consumption. 
As print speed is correlated with energy 
consumption, OKI’s micro-capsule toner 
helps to limit and reduce energy consumption 
substantially compared to conventional toner. 
Additionally, OKI’s green products are designed 
to separate the toner from drum. Each toner has 
a different replacement schedule; the separation 
of toners allows users to reduce waste caused 
by throwing out drums that could still be used. 
What this means for users is the possibility 
of fully utilising the lifespan of each toner.
With the lengthened lifecycle of its components, 
parts that traditionally have gone to waste are 
reduced. Moreover, designs that were created to 
simplify disassembly and reuse has also helped 
OKI save resources in constructing its products. 
Over the years, OKI’s printers and MFPs have 
achieve the Energy Star 2.0 and Blue Angel 
certifications. OKI’s consistent effort has once again 
proven that being green is the way to go. Adding 
to the list is the Malaysian Green Technology 
Corporation (GreenTech Malaysia) MyHIJAU 
Certificate – an accolade that OKI Data obtained 
recently in conjunction with the Royal Malaysian 
Police (PDRM) Green Day 2017 celebration. 
Among the green products to receive the 
MyHIJAU Certification include the B412dn, 
B431dn+, B432dn, B512dn and B731dnw 
mono printers, as well as the C531dn, C532dn, 
C612dn, C712dn, C833dn and C911dn 
colour printers. A range of its MPFs, namely 
the MB492dn, MC363dn and MC573dn, 
have also been certified under MyHIJAU.

at all nationwide Digi outlets.
The Vivo V5Plus features a dual selfie

even comparable to large aperture DLSR 
cameras. One of the cameras is composed 
of a 20-megapixel IMX376 primary front 
camera that is co-engineered with Sony 
and an 8-megapixel secondary camera for 
depth-of-field information.
Apart from that, it has a 5.5-inch full

Snapdragon 625 chip with 4GB RAM, 
64GB internal storage and complete with 
a built-in 3,160mAh battery under its hood.

Buying encryption? 
Five good questions to ask before you do
ersonal data protection act 
(PDPA), 
together 
with 
the 
growing 
number 
of 
data 
breaches are the most pressing 
reasons why small and medium businesses 
are 
implementing 
data 
protection 
technologies – including encryption.
However, with limited time and the 
market flooded by various products, it can 
be a difficult task for companies’ owners 
and decision-makers to find the right fit 
for their needs.
If you are faced with the decision 
yourself, avoid pitfalls in selecting 
an encryption product by asking the 
following questions:
1. Which laptops present the 
greater risk: On-site or off-site?
This might seem like a pointless 
question with an obvious answer; 
systems are more liable to theft when 
away from the office. But making this 
distinction and keeping it in mind is the 
right place to start and when you have 
settled on a solution, be sure to test 
its effectiveness at managing problem 
scenarios for your remote users.
P
2. Does the encryption system suit 
the needs of your IT department 
for full remote control of off-site 
endpoint encryption?
All 
major 
endpoint 
encryption 
products offer the means to manage 
remote systems, but look carefully 
at the requirements. Most need 
either an open incoming connection 
to a demilitarised zone (DMZ) on 
your server, or a VPN connection. 
All involve a higher level of IT skills 
that can add additional costs and, 
in order to function, may require the 
user to initiate the connection; not 
much use with a rogue employee or 
stolen laptop.
A well-designed product will 
give you the remote management 
necessary 
without 
creating 
additional 
security 
problems, 
requiring specialist knowledge, or 
adding expense to the project. 
3. Why is this important?
Being able quickly to vary security 
policy, encryption keys, features and 
operation of endpoint encryption 
remotely, means that your default 
policy can be strong and tight. 
Exceptions can be made only when 
and where they are needed, and 
reverted just as easily. If you can’t do 
this you’ll be forced to leave ‘a key 
under the doormat’, just in case — 
tearing holes in your policy before 
deployment is complete.
4. Does the solution allow remote 
locking and wiping of keys from 
laptops?
The answer might be crucial if a 
company computer with full-disk 
encryption gets stolen while in sleep 
mode or with the operating system 
booted up. It’s even worse if those 
systems come with the pre-boot 
password affixed on a label or tucked 
in the laptop bag. If a remote lock or 
wipe function is not available, then 
the system is either unprotected or 
secured only by the OS password, 
with the encryption being bypassed 
in either case.
Similarly, it is important to 
know whether the solution has

Google pays $10,000 for student’s bug
Google has rewarded a Uruguayan student with $10,000 after he exposed a 
security flaw that could allow hackers to access sensitive data. Ezequiel Pereira 
discovered the vulnerability in Google’s App Engine server after changing the 
Host header in requests to the server using Burp.
The high-school student explained in a blog post, “I was bored, so tried to 
find some bug at Google”. Following several failed attempts, he managed to gain 
access to an internal webpage that did not check his username or require any 
other security measure.

Organisations are increasingly aware of the threat posed by data breaches, 
according to Thales’ 2017 Data Threat Report. A remarkable 88% of respondents 
also admitted to feeling vulnerable to threats, with 9.1% feeling “extremely 
vulnerable”. This is significantly higher than the number actually experiencing

PlayStation social media accounts briefly hacked 
Sony became the latest entertainment company to suffer at the fingertips of

the typical use cases that would 
otherwise unravel a well-designed 
security policy.
5. Does the solution secure 
removable media without having 
to whitelist each item?
With an array of writeable devices 
that people use for their everyday 
work, it is almost impossible for the 
admins to whitelist each and every 
one of them, and decide whether it’s 
permissible to read from, write to, or 
not access the device at all.
It is much easier to set a file-
level policy – distinguishing between 
files that need encryption and 
those that don’t – and keep these 
protected every time they move from 
workstation or corporate network to 
any portable device.
In other words, if you connect 
your own USB stick, it won’t force 
you to encrypt your private data; 
anything coming from the company 
system, however, will be encrypted 
without the keys being held on 
your device. It is a simple idea, but 
one which makes any device safe, 
without the need for whitelisting.
The security was there a long 
time ago; what will make or break your 
deployment is flexibility and ease of use. 
In the end, you need to figure out if the 
solution you want to use is easy to deploy. 
If the setup of the solution takes 
hours or even days and needs additional 
tools for its operation, it might cause new 
headaches for company sysadmins and 
create new security risks. Aim for an easy-
to-deploy solution that doesn’t require 
advanced IT expertise and preserves both 
finances and your human resources. If 
the user experience mirrors that easy 
deployment, then IT staff won’t be 
further taxed by user lockouts, lost data 
and other frustrations.
All validated, commercial encryption 
products have been more than strong 
enough for many years, yet a significant 
proportion of the recorded data 
breaches involving lost or stolen 
laptops and USB drives happened to 
organisations who had bought and 
deployed encryption products.
Reading the case notes for these 
incidents reveals that being able to fit the 
solution to your environment, working 
practices and making encryption easy for 
everyday users as the real challenges.

Huawei Does It Again
 The nova 2 Plus makes its way to Malaysia
s the P and Mate series are 
considered Huawei's top-range 
premium flagships, the nova 2 
Plus is the latest smartphone 
to come out from Huawei's nova line-up of 
smartphones. Priced at RM1,999, Huawei 
dubs the nova 2 Plus as its best selfie 
smartphone, fitted with a 20-megapixel 
front-facing shooter.
The camera also comes with 3D 
facial recognition with skin enhancement 
features to better bring out the true 
you when taking selfies. Its front-facing 
camera can also take selfies with an 
added bokeh effect, a much-needed 
feature to give your Instagram that added 
dash of glamour and sophistication. Aside 
from making your selfies look natural and 
flawless, the nova 2 Plus also comes with 
a Gesture Shutter feature, which allows 
you to take a picture without having to 
press the button.
As for the rear camera, the nova 2 
Plus joins the ranks of many smartphones to 
carry a dual-camera featuring a 12-megapixel 
wide-angle lens as well as a long-focus 
8-megapixel lens with f/1.8 aperture, which 
will capture more light into your pictures. 
Like the front camera, its rear comes with 
a Professional Portrait mode that keeps 
the focus on your subject while giving the 
background that signature bokeh effect. You 
can also adjust the bokeh level in real-time to 
achieve the desired results in a snap.
In terms of hardware, the nova 2 Plus 
comes kitted with the Kirin 659 chipset, 4GB 
of RAM and 128GB of internal storage space. 
It also comes with the Android OS 7.0 Nougat 
with its own EMUI 5.1, backed up by a 5.5-inch 
display screen. There's also a dual SIM tray 
that fits a nano-SIM and a USB Type-C jack 
that juices up its 3,340mAh battery. Much like 
the Huawei P10 Lite, the nova 2 Plus places 
its fingerprint sensor onto the backplate of the 
device rather than on its Home button like the 
P10 and P10 Plus. Interestingly, the depth of 
the fingerprint sensor on the nova 2 Plus is 
a lot shallower compared to other Huawei 
devices, giving it a more flushed and polished 
look without any indents.
The nova 2 Plus also features a new 
Hi-Fi chip, the AK4376a that can keep audio 
distortions to a minimum while ensuring the 
music comes out clean, crisp and crystal 
clear to your ears.
The launch of the nova 2 Plus 
featured a teaser of another upcoming 
Huawei device, which is now known as the 
nova 2i. Although not much has been said 
about its latest upcoming smartphone, 
we do know that it will feature a total of 
four cameras - two on the front and two 
at the back. Expected to drop sometime 
in September, the nova 2i comes with a 
supposed price tag of below RM2,000, 
which sounds like a steal.

COVER 
STORY

Is it really worth paying a substantial amount 
for a smartphone, which you might change in 
a couple of years?
What is Really 
Worth It?
by Teh Wi-Liam

COVER STORY
 
lthough considered to be a norm 
in today’s modern smartphone 
market, 
many 
smartphone 
giants around the world are 
still pricing its flagship models at 
gargantuan prices. We as consumers 
still buy into the whole marketable ploy 
of it, even going so far as to lining up 
for days just to be the first in getting the 
latest smartphone, whether it be from 
Apple or Samsung. What breeds these 
modern-day mentalities into thinking 
that we can be fulfil the emptiness 
in us with a brand-new smartphone? 
Or, is there something bigger here at 
stake that we’re missing?
Close to a decade ago was the 
launch of the smartphone era with the 
likes of BlackBerry and the Apple iPhones 
leading the charge. Even then, prices for 
such luxury smartphones did not breach 
the RM2,000 limit and some would still 
contemplate as to whether it’s worth it 
to pay such an amount for a smartphone.
Fast forward 10 years later and 
we’re looking at the likes of Samsung, 
Sony, Huawei and Apple charging 
somewhere between RM3,000 and 
above for its flagship smartphones. To 
give you a sense of just how much, the 
latest Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is selling 
at RM3,999 and the highly-anticipated 
iPhone 8 is going for US$999 (approx. 
RM4,267). If you thought that was all, 
the latest Huawei flagship is the P10 
Plus, which goes for RM3,099 while 
Sony’s latest flagship costs RM3,399. 
Of course, no one is holding a knife 
to your throat in saying that you have 
to purchase the flagship devices with 
that sort of price; many are happy at 
purchasing a mid-range device between 
RM1,000 to RM2,000, even if they are a 
loyal follower of the big brands.
This begs the question: how far 
does a hardcore fanatic of Apple or 
Samsung must go to actually own its 
latest product? In Apple’s case, it’s more 
often than not the loyalty towards the 
brand than anything these days. How 
does Apple justify its price point for its 
iPhones? When the iPhone 7 launched 
last year, the standard iPhone 6 32GB 
variant was priced at RM3,199 while 
its 256GB variant was a whopping 
RM4,199. If that isn’t enough, the iPhone 
7 Plus 32GB was RM3,799 and its 256GB 
variant was RM4,799. Imagine, there are 
actually people in the world forking out 
almost RM5,000 for a smartphone.
However, this goes just beyond 
brand loyalty. One can argue that 
technology and innovation have grown 
at a rapid rate over the years, making 
smartphones smarter and giving us 
everything we need in one destination. 
One can also argue about the amount 
of R&D that goes into developing a 
smartphone as well as the soaring prices 
of internal components like chipsets 
and camera sensors. And, this goes just 
beyond a full-on bashing towards Apple; 
A

SEPT 2017

Samsung is also on the same boat with 
the exorbitant pricing of its Galaxy Note 8.
Essentially a slightly larger Galaxy 
S8+ with a stylus (S Pen) and the first of 
the Note series to carry dual cameras, 
that isn’t enough to justify its price tag. 
While the S8+ costs RM3,699, how does 
Samsung justify the RM300 increase 
for the Note 8? Surely it can’t be down 
to the inclusion of the S Pen? Both are 
using the same Exynos 8895 octa-core 
chipset and the Note 8 is only a fraction 
bigger than the S8+ by 0.1-inches.
There is also the question of the 
viability of the Note 8, given its rather 
disastrous history (which is a story for 
another time). Would anyone in their 
right mind be willing to purchase the 
Note 8 with that sort of track record? 
I for one, wouldn’t want to. This is by 
no means a hate message towards the 
people over at Samsung; for what it’s 
worth, I am a fan of the Galaxy S8+ and 
if it weren’t priced at RM3,699, I would 
actually consider purchasing one.
Now, back to the matter at hand.
To a certain extent, you must give 
it to these tech giants for being able to 
create a cult following for themselves. 
Steve Jobs’ charisma and showmanship 
on stage in selling the first ever iPhone 
to the last iPad 2 before his untimely 
demise, you have to applaud Jobs 
for Apple’s marketing schemes that 
has managed to capture the hearts of 
millions from around the world. 
Samsung 
is 
another 
brand 
that relies heavily on its marketing 
strategies to capture audiences, and 
it has done so in a great way through 
its commercials. How could one forget 
about the countless commercials we’ve 
seen online about Samsung having a go 
at Apple? Whether those commercials 
were authentic or not remains to be 
seen, but it was enough to turn plenty of 
heads and soon, change plenty of minds.
When it comes right down to it, 
smartphone shopping is the modern-day 
equivalent to retail therapy for most 
men and certainly plenty of women 
as well. Gone are the days of being 
able to spend a substantial amount 
on clothes as the spending power of 
Malaysians allow them to be able to 
afford more luxurious goods. Being the 
first in line to get the latest iPhone or 
Samsung is nothing more than gaining 
bragging rights; it isn’t so much about 
the device anymore but more of the 
means of how one got it.
In the end, this breeds capitalism, 
which then feeds into consumerism.

How Malaysians are using Bitcoin?
L
uno – a leading digital currency 
company – sees improvement in 
the understanding and adoption of 
Bitcoin and virtual currencies in Malaysia. 
As interest continues to increase, the 
company surveyed its Malaysian customers 
on just how and why they use Bitcoin.
WHY BITCOIN?

16.3% speed
10.5% control
 
             44.7% 
 
             investing
15.1% trading 
Reasons
Respondents
According to Luno, there are five main 
reasons as to why Malaysians buy Bitcoin:
1. Payments – Bitcoins are better than 
credit cards, as the payment method 
reduces fraud and increase privacy 
significantly as compared. 
2. Speed – Malaysians believe that using 
virtual currency is a faster and cheaper 
alternative. 
3. Control – Customers are in control 
of their virtual currency wallet. It is 
decentralised, while what they earn is 
based on how much they mine. 
4. Investing – Malaysians are looking 
for ways to diversify their investment 
portfolio. Bitcoin is currently seen as a 
high performing asset. 
5. Trading/Speculation – It is a convenient 
option for those constantly buying/
selling 
assets, 
taking 
advantage 
arbitrage and day trading.

Packed with more than enough specs to be used as your main camera
5 Key Features 
oF the eos M6
T
he EOS M6 is the latest addition to the EOS M-series line-up and its features rival those of mid-range or higher DSLRs. 
The EOS M6 boasts enhanced shooting features, as well as an improved design for better operability, thanks to the 
24.2-megapixel Dual Pixel CMOS sensor, and the latest DIGIC 7 image processor. The camera can achieve high-speed AF, a 
maximum normal ISO speed of 25,600 and fast continuous shooting performance of up to 9fps.
While the exterior design is reminiscent of vintage cameras, the EOS M6 has improved usability, featuring a grip that makes the 
camera easier to hold, and a dial design that your fingers can easily adapt to. Moreover, it is equipped with a new Quick Control Dial, 
with the exposure compensation dial stacked above it, allowing you to conveniently change settings such as the ISO speed without 
having to remove your hand from the grip. Continuous shooting performance has also been enhanced, improving your chances of 
capturing photo opportunities as and when they arise.

pixels
You can also choose to get the 
lightweight Electronic Viewfinder EVF-DC-2 
(sold separately), which matches the design 
of the EOS M6 and can be mounted externally. 
This lets you enjoy DSLR-style shooting with a 
viewfinder. With a compact size that allows 
you to carry it anywhere, this is one camera I 
would recommend as you can carry it around 
with you while going about your day. 
Next, let’s look at five key features of 
the EOS M6.
1. High-performance DiGiC 7 
imaging processor
On mirrorless cameras, the light 
information obtained by the image 
sensor is used to control everything from 
AF to shooting, so the functionality of the 
camera is directly related to the power 
of the image processor. Compared to 
previous image processors, DIGIC 7 
contributes to improved image quality 
in various ways. Not only does it deliver 
improved noise reduction performance 
when shooting at high ISO speeds, 
but also through great improvements 
against diffraction blur, among others. 
DIGIC 7 also contributes to power 
savings, enabling the EOS M6 to take 
up to around 295 shots – at an ambient 
temperature of 23°C – while using the 
same battery as that of other models in 
the EOS M series.
2. Dual pixel CMOs sensor 
realises high-speed AF
The Dual Pixel CMOS sensor 
performs both imaging and image 
80% of the sensor area (horizontally and 
vertically) can be used for high-speed 
image plane phase-difference AF.

plane phase-difference detection AF 
functions simultaneously. This allows 
the EOS M6 to perform high-speed 
AF across a wide area of the screen, 
providing a dramatically increased 
ability to shoot moving subjects.
3. smartphone pairing with 
Bluetooth
The EOS M6 features Bluetooth 
low-energy technology, which is not 
only power-saving, but also enables 
the camera to maintain a constant 
connection to compatible smart 
devices if the camera is switched on 
- even when in Auto Power Off mode.

facilitating the uploading of photos to 
social media.
4. Deeper grip and additional dials 
for a more fully-fledged design
The EOS M6 has slightly more rounded 
edges overall for a form that gives a 
softer impression, while the arrangement 
of the buttons is virtually the same as 
other Canon mirrorless cameras. The LCD 
screen on the rear side of the camera can 
be smoothly tilted up to 180° upwards. 
The strap mount is smaller so if you want 
to use an off-the-shelf strap, you will 
need to use a triangular ring.
Deeper grip for an easier hold. The grip 
has been made deeper for a firmer 
hold. Even people with larger hands 
can comfortably hold the EOS M6. 
5. The new Quick Control Dial 
allows you to rapidly change 
settings even during a shoot
The key feature is the new Quick Control 
Dial with the Exposure Compensation 
Dial stacked on top. On the EOS M6, it 
is now possible to assign functions to 
the Main Dial, Quick Control Dial and 
Control Dial. The degree of flexibility has 
been improved, particularly by allowing 
you to change settings while holding the 
grip when shooting in Manual mode. 
Control Dial
The Control Dial on the rear of the 
camera can be rotated clockwise or 
anti-clockwise for menu selection and 
for scrolling through images during 
playback.
Quick Control Dial
With dial customisation, you can register various 
functions such as White Balance and Drive mode 
for a dial. Because the stacked dial comprises 
two dials, with the Exposure Compensation Dial 
stacked on top of the Quick Control Dial, it might 
take some time getting used to using both dials 
at once.

Wait, Lemme Take a Selfie
ASUS Zenfone 4 Selfie Pro
Dual Front Camera
Unlike many other of its 
competitors, 
the 
dual 
camera 
isn’t 
reserved 
for the rear camera, but 
rather the front!
Quick charging
It’s not USB-C, but it 
does sport fast charge 
capabilities. You don’t 
have to wait hours for 
a full charge. 
Ready for Oreos
The entire ZenFone 4 series 
is confirmed to be ready for 
Android O upgrades.  
24 HOURS EXPERIENCE
24 HOURS EXPERIENCE
Double the Lens, 
Double the Fun!
Heavily promoted for its selfie taking 
capabilities, the ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro 
comes with a 24-megapixel DuoPixel front-
facing camera at F1.8 with SuperPixel 
Tech. All that tech babble means you get 
some really good quality shots, especially 
when using the front camera. It even 
shoots video in 4K! The 120° wide-angle 
camera allows you to fit more people 
or scenery when taking photos with the 
front camera. Not forgetting ASUS’ famed 
beauty mode, giving you blemish-free 
photos ready for the ‘gram. 
Low Light, No Problemo
The camera features a flagship Sony IMX362 
image sensor with a large 1/2.55” size 
format and 1.4µm pixel size. Sony has been 
well known for its superb quality of camera 
sensors, providing excellent pictures even 
in low-light. On the ZenFone 4 Selfie Pro, 
it lives up to that legacy, taking detailed 
photos, even at night with limited lighting. 
While adjusting the brightness can be a bit 
fiddly, for a smartphone camera the UI is 
intuitive, and the quality is pretty good too.
Not Just the Front
Sure, the selfie camera gets a lot of 
attention – it is in the name after all! The 
rear camera isn’t shabby either. Similarly 
fitted with a Sony image sensor with 
ASUS SuperPixel Engine, the rear camera 
is a powerful 16-megapixels and performs 
just as well under low-light conditions. 
While the front camera’s quality might 
suffer slightly when using the wide-angle 
lens, the performance of the rear camera 
is consistently solid, giving clear photos 
even in low-light settings.  
HOUR 24
“Could consider this 
as an alternative 
phone to my 
current phone. I 
think I’ll put my 
spare line and 
use this phone 
permanently. ”
HOUR 12
“Ohh… might be 
a bit hot after 
continuously 
using the camera. 
Although, the 
battery is still going 
strong.”
HOUR 6
“Hey, it holds up 
quite decently 
in lowlight. Also, 
I barely feel the 
phone’s weight. It’s 
so easy to bring 
around.”

Other Than the Camera
Enough about the camera. The performance 
of the phone itself is very intuitive and 
quick. The upgraded ZenUI 4 comes with 
way less bloatware compared to its 
predecessors, only giving you useful apps, 
which is a welcomed change. Besides that, 
the Snapdragon 625 provides a quick and 
smooth performance, without much lag or 
seizing up. The ZenUI also comes with some 
handy security features, including app locks. 
Might Want Some 
Extra Juice
With a 3,000mAh battery, it’s by no means 
the largest. (Its sibling, the ZenFone 4 
MaxPro boasts a 5,000mAh battery!) It 
can comfortably last a full day, but if you 
are a heavy user, you might want to bring 
a cable with you – just in case. On the 
plus side, it isn’t as prone to overheating 
compared to some others in the market. 
While overheating is still a slight issue, it 
cools quickly, with tools in the phone to 
help clear apps and processes. 
Slim Figure
The phone is designed to be 
slim and classy. Although 
sporting a 5.5-inch screen, 
it’s 
lightweight 
and 
comfortable to hold.   
Streamlined UI
The updated UI is much more 
streamlined, minimalistic and 
less messy. A pleasant change 
from its previous iterations!

Moto Z2 Play
Moto Mods are a Must
The Moto Mods are key when it comes 
to the Z2 Play. As a device on its own, 
the Z2 Play is pretty much your standard 
smartphone. With Moto Mods, it can 
become so much more. Sadly, we didn’t 
receive any Moto Mods with the device 
so it’s hard to say for sure how great the 
Z2 Play is, but it has the potential to be a 
top-notch smartphone.
Smooth Criminal, 
it is Not 
One design flaw of the Z2 
Play is its rear camera, 
which protrudes out in 
an odd way, making it 
look lopsided.
Easy-to-remember 
Moto Actions 
The Z2 Play comes with 
Moto Actions, which are 
easy-to-remember motions 
to turn on the camera or 
the flashlight on the device.
Locked & Loaded 
Aside from using the 
fingerprint 
to 
unlock 
the Z2 Play, you can 
now lock the device as 
well by holding your 
designated finger down 
onto the reader.
Not Enough Juice  
Although it comes with 
a 
3,000mAh 
battery, 
the Z2 Play’s battery life 
is average at best; not 
something worth spending 
RM2,000 on.
Mod Your Moto
Speedy and Snappy
With the help of the mid-range Snapdragon 
625 processor, the Z2 Play has a quick step 
to its game as it doesn’t get bogged down 
at all. Unlocking and locking the device 
takes less than a blink of an eye while 
swapping between apps is quick, to say 
the least. Although it only comes with 
4GB of RAM, it’s more than enough to get 
you through your day.
Easy on the Eye 
Although the protruding camera is a turn-off 
to certain people, the design of the Z2 Play 
is very thin and feels good in the palm of 
your hands. It’s sleek unibody design is 
covered in aluminium, which gives it a 
premium look and feel; something that is 
worth its weight in gold. The display screen 
also gives plenty of bright and consistent 
colour without looking cheap, another plus 
point to Moto’s latest flagship.

Keeping it Clean 
Thanks to the help of the stock Android 
Nougat, the Z2 Play comes with very 
minimal bloatware. The Moto app works 
very well with the stock Android OS, giving 
you great feel and access to the phone for 
daily usage. Especially if you’re one who 
could care less about bloatware that many 
smartphone brands tout, the Z2 Play is one 
to consider owning as its clean and without 
the bells and whistles.
Fluctuating Camera 
Performance  
The Z2 Play comes with a 16-megapixel 
shooter on the back and 5-megapixels 
in the front. When trying to focus on 
close-up shots, the Z2 Play does brilliantly 
well; but in terms of a much wider 
audience, the autofocus is atrocious with 
being able to capture the correct target. 
Colours do pop during close-up pictures 
but loses its edge on much wider shots, 
making it a hit-and-miss.

AMD Ryzen 3 1200
Three is the Magic Number
Bank Account Friendly
Rounding up its range, AMD’s newest 
Ryzen 3 completes the family where it 
now has processors available for every 
mainstream need out there (apart from 
Threadripper, which is slated to arrive 
sometime later this year). Ryzen 3 fills 
the needs of starter computer users, who 
are looking for something powerful, yet 
at the same time, economical.  Priced 
at RM519, it is the cheapest quad-core 
processor in the market now!
4 Cores 4 Life
If power is what you need, the Ryzen 3 
has enough to dish out to resource-hungry 
applications. The four cores and four 
threads in the CPU ensure your processing 
needs are fulfilled, be it something as 
simple as web browsing or intensive as 
3D gaming. While it does not support 
multi-thread processing, the four built-in 
cores do give it a leg-up when compared to 
the competitor’s dual-core offerings.
Unlock Your Potential
Thanks to the nature of the Zen architecture, 
AMD made the Ryzen cores unlocked, which 
means that overclocking is the flavour of 
the day, rather than just for the select few. 
The chip can be easily overclocked to 4GHz, 
even with the standard cooler so it is quite 
stable on a full load.
Full Ecosystem Support
As the Ryzen 3 is part of the Zen 
architecture, you get full support 
such as USB 3.1, x16 PCIe lanes 
and overclocking.

Work or Play – Your Choice
The power of the Ryzen chips makes it great for work, multi-
core processing to render videos or even play as games 
are optimised. The Ryzen 3 offers 10% more frames in 
AAA games as opposed to the chips from the boys in blue.
Power Sipper
One feature about the Zen architecture is its ability to 
consume power sparingly. As the Ryzen 3 comes with 65W 
TDP, which saves on power, making it more impressive that 
even at full load using AIDA64, the temperature doesn’t 
rise above 40°C. This is with the stock cooler and stock 
speeds with no overclocking. With the right motherboard, 
the Ryzen 3 can be overclocked, thanks to its generous 
temperature and power overhead. 
Cooler Included
AMD supplies the Ryzen 3 1200 with the Wraith 
Stealth cooler in the box for out-of-the-box 
builds. That’s value for money right there.

The Legion Comes
Lenovo Legion Y720
Mid-Range Monster
Previously known only as the Lenovo Y 
Series, Lenovo has since rebranded its 
gaming division by renaming it to be known 
as the Lenovo Legion Y Series. Up steps the 
Y720, featuring a Kaby Lake processor with 
NVIDIA GTX 1060 graphics, 8GB of RAM and 
a 1TB hard drive. Although it doesn’t seem 
like much, Lenovo Legion Y Series keeps its 
Y720 strictly mid-range with above average 
specs and a modest price tag.
Lenovo Nerve Sense
Coupled with the Lenovo Legion Y720 is 
the Lenovo Nerve Sense, your one-stop 
destination to keeping tabs on the laptop. 
From there, you get to choose between 
four keyboard colour profiles in Light Shift; 
keeping the laptop performance up and its 
temperatures down via Extreme Cooling 
(which gets insanely loud when turned 
on); and Network Priority, which detects 
when a game is being run and to ensure 
its prioritised with the internet connection.
Another VR-Ready 
Gaming Machine
For fans of virtual reality (VR) games, the 
Lenovo Legion Y720 comes with the bare 
minimum requirements to run all your 
favourite VR games. With the help of having 
more at least two USB 3.0 ports, a HDMI 
port and the GTX 1060 GPU to boot, the 
Lenovo Legion can keep you entertained for 
hours. However, you would need to invest 
more into owning a VR set, which could set 
you back quite a bit.
Fire Them Up
The Lenovo Legion Y720 
comes equipped with 
JBL speakers and a 
Dolby Atmos subwoofer, 
ensuring 
your 
music, 
movies and games come 
with top-quality sound.
Four Ports Galore

Mini but Full
This is one of the first Mini-ITX motherboards

That said, it has all the required ports and

position of its power pins. The 24-pin 
power socket is not at your typical location, 
and the 8-pin socket is way at the bottom 
of the motherboard. Cable routing may be a 
challenge in smaller cases. 
RGB All the Way, Baby
Yes, as this is the Ryzen platform, RGB 
support is readily available. It even comes 
with an onboard header to connect your 
RGB strips or fans to be controlled by 
Gigabyte’s RGB Fusion software. You only 
get two headers though, so make full use of

ensure that heat leaves the router quickly.
Like a Spider
The ROG is a big heavy router 
with eight massive antennas 
surrounding its base. Optional 
antennas could be an upgrade later.
Never Gonna Let You Down
Though it bears resemblance to the RT-
AC5300, that is where it ends. ASUS ROG 
has hardware pushed to the very limits 
of present day technology. It contains 
the latest chipset from Broadcom with 
support for MU-MIMO from three separate 
bands that will deliver up to 5,334Mbps 
combined. The CPU and RAM are an 
insane combination of a quad-core 1.8GHz 
processor with 1GB of RAM. This ensures 
it will never be bogged down with all the 
data coming through from the computers 
and from the internet.
Ports Galore from ROG
One weakness of the RT-AC5300 was 
its inclusion of only four LAN ports. The 
Rapture has remedied this by giving a total 
of eight LAN ports and one gigabit WAN. 
In true ROG style, it also included port 
aggregation on a pair of LAN ports. This 
allows for data over two LAN ports to be 
combined, a feature normally found on NAS 
storage. Dual USB 3.0 ports are on the back 
and can support a host of connections with 
hard disk drives as well as a 4G modem for 
backup.
Subheads:
The software used to control the Rapture 
is one of the most complete systems to be 
placed in a router. From the way the Lan 
port is configured to the type of utilisation 
for the USB ports, you have a hand in 
everything. Rog has even added GPN to 
the Rapture by way of WTFast, which 
minimises lag while obtaining a quick and 
stable connection for a specific game.

Pleasantly Surprised
nubia M2
Design Meets Performance
Unlike many mid-range phones, the nubia 
M2 sports a sleek design with evenly 
distributed weight, while still looking 
elegant. It’s not just the design though, the 
performance is just as smooth. The phone 
handles running multiple applications 
very well. Running games and swapping 
between surfing the net and navigation 
– it all runs smoothly. Although, if you 
are a very heavy user, the phone might 
occasionally seize up.
Unique Interface
Although basing off Android 6, nubia opted 
for an in-house UI. Instead of recent apps, 
the third button is a menu button. The 
settings lives in the menu bar, instead of 
being shown as a separate app. Besides 
that, the phone has edge gestures, where 
you can swap between apps by sliding up 
or down the edge of the phone, or long 
tapping the edge to switch screens. The 
M2 also allows for long screenshots, and 
even screen recording. Very handy. 
Shooting Wonder
With a 13-megapixel Monochrome + 
13-megapixel RGB dual camera at F2.2, 
the rear camera combo gives clear pictures 
with functions for multiple exposures, 
timelapse, slow-mo, etc. While the 
various camera features were fun to play 
with, the quality might suffer slightly. The 
16-megapixel front shooter allows for very 
clear selfies, as well as beauty modes. 
There’s a very handy brightness bar to the 
side of the focus circle on the screen, so 
you can adjust the brightness easily too.  
Play All Day
The phone has a 3,630mAh 
battery so it holds up comfortably 
for a day of heavy usage.
USB-C!
For a mid-ranger, we 
weren’t expecting the m2 
to have a USB-C port. 
Handy Gestures
You can use different gestures 
on the edge of the phone to 
swap between apps, change 
screen, or even clean out 
background apps.

optimised for low-power consumption. A 
nifty feature of the Watch 2 is the ability 
to customise its face to match the outlook. 
There is also a built-in LTE, which allows 
the Watch 2 to function as a standalone 
device without being tethered.
Fitness and Fashion Collide
Not only does the Watch 2 look decently 
fashionable for any outfit, it even comes 
with decent fitness features to keep track 
of your vitals. The heart rate sensor is 
noticeably faster than its predecessor 
and its readings were on par with the 
health tracker on other smartwatches. The 
lower button on the Watch 2 activates 
the built-in Activity app, which tracks 
a variety of exercises from biking to 
running. Sadly though, the Watch 2 is only 
splash-proof at best. 
Steady and Sturdy 
The build is solid and 
a 
raised 
bezel 
helps 
to protect the screen 
from scratches.
Turning to the Gorilla
Instead of sapphire in the first 
iteration, the Watch 2 comes covered 
with Corning’s Gorilla Glass.
Bigger is Always Better
The Huawei Watch 2 looks and 
feels like a typical sports watch 
as its thick bezel makes its 42mm

By turning off all smartwatch features, the

All the Colours!
Canon imageCLASS MF633Cdw
8.6
SPECS
VERDICT: 
“An all-in-one printer that shines in colour.” - Atifi 
For the Modern Business
No longer are businesses confined to using 
big, bulky multifunction printers in an office 
setting. As print technologies advance, 
these printing workhorses are getting 
smaller in footprint. Designed for the 
modern business, the Canon imageCLASS 
MF633Cdw is ideal for a small- to 
medium-sized business. 
Boxy and Compact
The MF633Cdw is comparatively small 
and boxy in design, however, it is just 
as capable as those conventional office 
printing behemoths. While there is a 
150-sheet maximum in its cassette, there 
is an optional cassette tray available if you 
need the capacity. Smaller outfits, one that 
doesn’t need a high print monthly print 
volume, will appreciate the formfactor, 
which doesn’t take much space. 
Versatile for Any Occasion
Being a coloured laser printer, the 
MF633Cdw 
produces 
vivid 
coloured 
printouts that does not bleed or smudge. 
Having used this printer for both black and 
white, as well as coloured documents, the 
MF633Cdw certainly shines for the latter. It 
would be perfect to print out presentations 
or A4 posters. 
Easy Access
Users can easily access 
the control panel through 
its 
generous 
5-inch 
coloured LCD touchscreen 
panel. It’s user-friendly 
and easy to navigate. 
Quick to Print
If you’re not printing a 
full-colour or graphic-heavy 
document, the MF633Cdw 
is nimble in churning out 
text document printouts 
that are crisp and bold.

Core Strength
Thermaltake Core G21 TG
8.2
SPECS
VERDICT: 
“The casing is one of the best looking and yet affordable tempered glass 
casing on the Malaysian market right now.” - Din 
Tempered Glass!
Thermaltake is quite a proven name for 
PC enthusiasts in terms of producing 
quality and affordable casings. Its identity 
of simple-looking but sleek products have 
been a favourite for years now, and it’s not 
a surprise when we see their latest product, 
the Thermaltake Core G21 TG Casing. The 
“TG” here, if you haven’t guessed, stands 
for tempered glass. And, it’s not every day 
you can find a tempered glass casing that 
is selling for sub RM300.
Small Matter
The case is compact and garnished in 
matte black all over. Its simple design 
exudes elegance but it would’ve been nicer 
if the white Thermaltake logo is blended 
into the casing rather than being stuck on. 
The perforated front-end gives lots of room 
for air to enter and cool the innards, either 
using air cooling via three 120mm fans (or 
two 140mm’s) or a maximum 360mm-sized 
radiator if you’re into water cooling. Fans 
can be installed either on the top, at the 
rear or even at the bottom of the casing.
Fragility No More
The design of the casing extends to two 
clips at the bottom that keeps the tempered 
glass in place so you won’t have to worry 
about its fragile side panels. Although 
slightly tinted, it’s clear enough to check on 
your components. Sadly, this also means 
that you can see the cables running at 
the back, which is a double-edged sword 
if you’re one of those that hates cable 
management (like me). 
Limited Storage Space
You are only limited to two 
3.5-inch storage devices. Two 
2.5-inch SSD mounts are also 
included and can be found on top 
of the PSU shroud.
Blind Spot
We are surprised the PSU 
is mostly shrouded from the 
front and top. This does mean 
that you won’t be able to 
show off some “bling” PSUs.

Simply Portable
Sony Mobile Projector MP-CL1A
Mediocre Battery 
One disappointing feature 
is the battery. With a 
3,400mAh battery, it lasts 
for only about two hours. No 
Marvel movies then?
Link Up Other 
Speakers  
A bit bummed by the 
speakers? You can link 
up other speakers or 
headsets via Bluetooth.
Extra Power 
The projector doubles as a 
power bank in case you need 
extra juice in a pinch.
Elegently Slim
The design of the projector is slim and 
solid without feeling heavy, making it 
easy to carry. Not much bigger than the 
size of a 5-inch smartphone, it comes with 
easy access buttons and ports, all on one 
side. Fitted with a headphone jack, a USB 
port and a HDMI port, it’s got just enough 
for playing any videos from most devices. 
The USB port also allows the pocket 
projector to double up as a power bank 
for your other devices.
Easy Setup 
The setup is simple. You can detect the 
pocket projector from any Wi-Fi enabled 
devices, pair them and the screen will be 
mirrored. After the screen is mirrored, a 
single toggle switch allows you to refine 
the settings, including keystones, colour 
contrast, brightness, Bluetooth settings, 
etc. The toggle switch also doubles as a 
volume control for the in-built speaker. 
One-Person Entertainment 
Being a pocket projector, it’s not meant to 
give you a cinematic experience. The stand 
is made so you can angle the projector 
onto a nearby wall, or onto a ceiling. (You 
know, when you’re lazy to get out of bed.) 
The speakers are loud enough, but they 
won’t be top shelve quality. Supporting 
up to 1920x720 HD resolution, the visuals 
turned out to be a bit darker. While 
you can adjust the settings, it isn’t the 
best for image quality.

Vast Connectivity Options
At the back are full connectivity ports, 
mainly two USB ports, a LAN ports, a

Android Domination
Having already been used with TVs, 
car stereos, smartphones, the Android

the JOI Remix Mini PC as well, making 
way for another segment in the market 
its penetrating. The Remix Mini gives the 
Android OS a makeover with the Android 
Play Store pre-installed unlike some Android 
boxes where it’s absent. Installation and 
setup is straightforward with no issues in 
recognizing the mouse and keyboard.
No Storage, No Problem 
The Remix Mini is capable of processing 
just about any file you throw at it. However, 
it was not as consistent in detecting 
storage devices via the USB ports. But 
when it comes to decoding 4K videos, the 
Mali400MP2 GPU is more than capable 
of doing so. Using any media centre 
software like Kodi can turn the PC into a 
very competent TV Box, albeit it must be 
controlled with a mouse and keyboard. With 
the right customisation, you could stream 
any content onto your TV or monitor.

Design and Shape
The Cooler Master Masterbox 5t is a 
departure from the safe and under-the-
radar design of its predecessor. The mid-
tower chassis features a red front mesh, a 
roof dust filter and a motherboard tray that 
certainly adds more character while still 
having a practical purpose. The I/O panel 
now sports a fan controller alongside the 
dual USB 3.0 ports and audio jacks.
You Decide the Inside
Cooler Master has been focusing on 
the idea of modular design, giving 
builders more flexibility in layout and 
configuration for a more simplified case-
building experience. The interior of the 
chassis is spacious enough for pain-free 
installation of your core components. For 
clumsy people, the front panel comes off 
easily for better access to the internals. 
The interior has enough clearance for the 
beefier and bigger air coolers as well as the 
chunkier graphic cards.
Real-World Airflow & Noise
While this case was built for gaming, we 
also intended for it to be our secondary 
video editing workstation, which meant 
thermal performance and noise dampening 
were equally important. Despite not 
being in the high-end spectrum with a 
dual-fan configuration, we were able to 
run an i7-6700K with a minor overclock at 
reasonable temperatures, rarely peaking 
over 60°C. Airflow was good with fresh air 
being pulled from the front panel mesh and 
exited via the rear and top vents. 
Front Fan 
Bracket
The 
front 
bracket 
supports radiators up 
to 360mm for those 
seeking liquid-cooled 
performance 
without 
the need to fuss with 
brackets or adapters.
Carry Handle
A Carry handle that 
supports up to 30kg 
of 
weight 
makes 
for relatively easy 
and 
upright 
case 
transportation. It also 
doubles as a nice 
cubby hole to stash 
USB drives.
Stormguard Bracket
To 
prevent 
your 
lovely 
peripherals from disappearing 
to unsavoury types, the chassis 
has a Stormguard bracket to 
keep your mind at ease.

Serious Business
When a bright red and black hard-shell case 
arrived at our test lab, we were curious to 
see what lies within. Truth be told, neither 
one of us expected an industrial label 
maker. The Epson LabelWorks LW-Z900FK 
is a hefty machine that will suit even the 
most rugged of environments thanks to its 
durable design. It certainly weighs quite a 
bit; thankfully no toes or flooring were hurt 
during its time here. 
Commercial Application
As mere consumers, the LW-Z900FK is 
certainly an overkill for day-to-day labelling 
of office stationery, which may or may not 
include our staplers and scissors (you’d be 
surprised at how many of these disappear 
from the desk). It is suitable for skilled 
workers such as contractors, builders and 
plumbers, who are constantly exposed to 
the elements – this label maker would be 
appreciated in such setting. 
Label All the Things!
Truly made for industrial applications, 
the LW-Z900FK is complemented with 
an extensive list of label styles, including 
cable-wrap, die-cut, heat shrink tapes and 
magnetic tapes. Also, Epson offers users 
up to seven tape widths, from as narrow 
as 4mm to as wide as 36mm, in a variety 
of colours. For our review, we utilised the 
12mm standard tape – an all-rounder when 
it comes to labelling. From text to barcodes, 
the label maker printed everything 
clearly and quickly. 
Hands-free Operation
This label maker has an 
automatic cutter that cuts full 
or half-size labels. In fact, you 
could even mount it onto steel 
surfaces – made possible by 
its magnatised feet. 
Look Ma, No Wires
Being an industrial label marker, 
it comes with a high-capacity 
battery. The only wire you’ll ever 
find is for when it needs a charge.

Free to Move 
When thinking of sports headphones, you’d

norm is the Monster iSport Freedom on-ear 
headphones, which can be used both wired 
and wirelessly. For those who need music 
blaring while doing their workouts they will 
be able to enjoy this particular pair. 
Exercise Companion
Sporting a black and chartreuse colourway, 
the material used is smooth and rubberised. 
It fits snuggly on the head as the material 
helps with keeping it where it should be. 
We didn’t try to use it for more vigorous 
activities, but the iSport Freedom will stay 
put with minimal effort if you’re going for 
a jog or even exercising at the gym. We 
didn’t try whether it was water resistant 
either, though we can safely report that it is 
indeed sweat-proof (re: this writer doesn’t 
usually partake in exercising). 
High-end Offering
The headphones are priced at a premium, 
which some may not want to pay. Pay a 
bit more, and you can get yourself a pair 
of more comfortable wireless headphones 
from brands like JBL, AKG and Sony. 
Also, sweat does tend to shorten the 
life of headphones, even if they are 
made to be resilient. That said, the audio 
quality and battery longevity of the iSport 
Freedom is something we can’t complain 
about. Perhaps its the touch-sensing 
controls, located on the right earcup, 
that makes it pricey?

DJI Spark
Much to our Dismay 
The Spark has very limited flying range 
when paired and controlled with a mobile 
device. Whether it’s your smartphone 
or your tablet, the results are the same 
as the Spark can only fly up to a certain 
distance. If you’re planning on capturing 
more footage, we would highly recommend 
getting the dedicated controller.
Short Flight Time
The Spark’s tiny size is the limiting 
factor for its flight time. It is so 
small, the battery pack is almost 
45% of its main fuselage/body, 
which results in approximately 
10-15 minutes of flying.
Many Ways to Fly 
The Spark can be controlled 
in three different ways: hand 
gestures, mobile devices or a 
dedicated DJI controller.  
Pocket-sized Performer  
Drones are normally quite large, which 
ensures that they can stay stable in 
flight but the Spark is tiny.  It’s slightly 
larger than an iPhone 6S+. 
Spark the Pilot in You 
Perfect for Beginners 
The DJI Spark is easily the best aircraft 
for beginners to start out with before 
moving on to bigger and move complex 
drones. Pairing and setting it up for flight 
takes less than five minutes and it comes 
with automatic take-off and landing with a 
return-to-home function, giving you a peace 
of mind when piloting the Spark. Its small 
frame is also great if you’re not confident 
with bigger-sized drones to begin with.
Getting your YouTube 
Career Started 
Packed with an impressive 1080p FHD 
camera, the 2-axis gimbal combined with 
flight stability allows for stunning videos. 
Functions like ‘Object Tracking’ allows for 
selfie-styled videos with ease while indoor 
videos have very little digital noise and 
distortion. You can also switch between 
videos and stills through the settings. Sadly, 
no audio will be recorded with the video.

VERDICT: 
“We love the versatility and portability of the KOOVA. The 
subscription plan, not so much. ” - Atifi  
More Than Just a Camera
Known for its robotic security cameras, 
Amaryllo has been hard at work with the 
KOOVA – touted as the world’s smallest 
auto-tracking and face detection robotic 
camera. It is a considerable upgrade 
from the original iSensor camera, which 
sports a similar design. The KOOVA, 
however, houses a range of smart features 
that makes it a nifty on-the-go security 
camera. Its dual-core CPUs makes it 
possible for facial recognition (up to 
four people) and detection, along with 
auto-tracking features.
Small and Smart
Thanks to its size, you could easily 
transplant the security camera anywhere. 
We could see the merits of setting up the 
KOOVA as a temporary security solution 
while you’re on holiday. It powers by USB 
– you can use a cable with a power bank or 
wall plug – and connects to the Wi-Fi while 
being discreet enough to be unnoticed by 
unwanted visitors to your accommodation. 
Should there be any alerts, the moment will 
be recorded and an alert will be sent to you 
via the Amaryllo app. 
Not for Free
There are a range of other smart features 
available on the KOOVA, including setting 
your own customised Activity and Block

Thermal Efficiency 
Thermaltake Water 3.0 X120

SPECS
VERDICT: 
“The X120 is compact, but still great performing AIO cooler from Thermaltake.” - Din 
Thermaltake Coming in 
Strong
For the past few years, AIO has been the 
top choice for PC enthusiast’s due to its 
efficiency and easy installation, compared 
to a full-fledged water-cooling loop. It can 
even fit in the most casings in the market 
and even a cramped mini ITX. So, it’s great 
to see Thermaltake release an update to its 
flagship AIO Water 3.0 line: the X120. With 
a max 25db 120mm fan, it’s highly efficient, 
even when using a tempered glass casing, 
or a fully enclosed mini ITX.
Single but Powerful
As the name implies, the X120 is a single 
radiator AIO cooler that comes with a 
single 120mm fan. Weighing in at only 
782g, the X120 can be fitted at the rear, top 
or at the front of your casing. The piping 
is made from smooth rubber, which is just 
flexible enough to let you manipulate the 
pump/cooler head to install. 
No Rainbows
The pump is rated at 12v and features a 
white LED Thermaltake logo. Sadly, no RGB 
here, but hey, it still looks cool, especially 
in a tempered glass casing. The X120 
comes with various backplates, which let 
you install it on various Intel and AMD 
systems. And great news, the X120 also 
supports the new AMD AM4 socket, which 
means you can now use the X120 to cool 
down your Ryzen. 
Silent and Deadly
The X120 is insanely 
quiet, even when it’s 
under heavy load; good 
job, Thermaltake!
Keeping it Classy
With 
all 
the 
hype 
surrounding RGB, it’s 
great to see Thermaltake 
taking things different 
with an all-white LED.

SHOWDOWN
martphones have invaded just 
about every facet of our lives 
today. Some segments of the 
electronics sector have succumbed 
to this invasion, rendering them almost 
to oblivion; one such segment is digital 
photography. With every flagship model 
that has launched, there have been several 
expected improvements that is anticipated 
and you can bet that the camera is one 
of them. In this showdown, we decided 
to take a closer look at the cameras of 
the leading flagships that have launched 
recently and pit them against one another. 
We selected a few challenging aspects/

conditions of shot-taking to see which 
one of the flagship smartphones have the 
better camera. 
1) Daylight with HDR
2) Night
3) Video (Front and Rear)
4) Selfie
The chosen smartphones are the 
Samsung S8+, Sony Xperia XZ Premium, 
Huawei P10 Plus and the OnePlus 5. I will 
be leaving the phones in their full auto 
settings and not make any changes to the 
camera parameters.

SHOWDOWN
ifferentiation in daylight is often very difficult. All four smartphones 
were very capable in this aspect of photo-taking. Upon closer 
inspection of the images, blemishes and imperfections start to 
show.  When zoomed in, the XZ Premium reigns supreme in terms 
of providing detailed clarity, which is then followed by the Galaxy S8+. 
Unfortunately, the OnePlus 5 and P10 Plus has lost its details.
A feature that comes with every flagship smartphone camera is high 
dynamic range (HDR), which helps in capturing images in great detail. While 
the S8+ and P10 Plus provide the most details in their shots, the XZ Premium 
gives the clearest image among all four devices. Sadly, the OnePlus 5 doesn’t 
do itself justice in this department as it was miles away compared to the 
other devices. In overall scoring, the daylight win will have to be the S8+ 
followed by the XZ Premium, P10 Plus and OnePlus 5 respectively.

Night 
ight time shots are the Achilles heel of any smartphone camera. 
Just when you thought you captured the perfect image, it turns out 
to be totally unusable because the natural low-lighting conditions 
ruined it. The image results were taken with the help of a tripod and 
things to look out for are clarity and visibility, not just from afar but when 
enlarged as well.
Putting the four smartphones through different tests yielded similar 
results when compared to the daytime shots as both the S8+ and the P10 
Plus came out on top. These two devices retained the most detail and clarity 
while the XZ Premium and OnePlus 5 were not able to find proper focus, 
causing the details to be lost and washed out.
Just to reiterate, the pictures were taken by hand and in the end, the 
S8+ was the clear winner, which is then followed by the P10 Plus. The XZ 
Premium came in a respectable third place while the OnePlus 5 was the 
unfortunate loser again.

SHOWDOWN
ith image stabilisation in one form or another being part of all 
smartphone in this month’s showdown, the videos shot in daylight 
are silky smooth. The only difference between them would be a 
matter of personal preference on smartphone choices. 4K recording 
was the choice of the day for video recording and unfortunately for the 
XZ Premium, it didn’t come with 4K recording within its video settings. 
Recording in 4K taxed all the devices, which were pretty warm to touch 
after just five minutes of recording.
Night videos were taken to stress out the cameras. From the stills taken 
from the videos, the noise and motion blur are most evident on the OnePlus 
5, followed by the P10 Plus. The XZ Premium contained the least amount 
of digital noise, however, it was also not able to capture much details. The 
best balance with enough detail and noise comes from the S8+.

Selfie 
aking a picture of one’s self has become such a phenomenon that the Oxford 
dictionary has officially recognised the term ‘selfie’. This gave rise to 
not just the capabilities of the cameras at the back but also at the front 
of the smartphones. Nowadays, some smartphones are even touting the 
front-facing camera as one of the key USPs of its features.
Looking at the images, the XZ Premium had the widest field of the group while 
the remainder shared a similar field of view. A worthy takeaway was the P10 Plus, 
which was the only one with a bokeh effect or portrait mode for its front-facing 
camera. The XZ Premium also had the sharpest clarity of the background as well 
as better colour reproduction compared to the other smartphones. What was a 
little surprising was the S8+ as the background was a little washed out. With the 
OnePlus 5, the details in the background appeared distorted, which just spoke 
about the overall performance of the device. The P10 Plus would come second to 
the XZ Premium as it retained a lot of the details.

SHOWDOWN
CONCLUSION
All the smartphones performed very well but this would not be a showdown if we did not dig deep to find the differences among 
them. The Samsung Galaxy S8+ was the most consistent performer under all conditions, crowning it the winner of this month’s 
Showdown. The Sony Xperia XZ Premium does deserve an honourable mention for being the most colour accurate and despite 
the big bezels, we liked its design best for being understated yet premium. The Huawei P10 Plus also deserves some recognition 
for being a formidable front and rear-facing shooter.

BEHIND 
THE 
CLOAK 
C
raf ty offenders use 
cloaking as a technique 
to circumvent Facebook’s 
review processes, thus 
allowing content that violate 
t h e  p l a t f o r m’s  C o m mu n i t y 
Standards and Advertising Policies. 
In an effort to further combat 
false information, Facebook addresses 
the act of cloaking by removing 
financially-motivated bad actors who 
create misleading experiences for people. 
Bad actors disguise the true 
destination of an ad or post, or the 
real content of the destination page, 
in order to bypass Facebook’s review 
processes. For example, they will set 
up web pages so that when a Facebook 
reviewer clicks a link to check whether 
it’s consistent with Facebook’s policies, 
they are taken to a different web page 
than when someone using the Facebook 
app clicks that same link. Cloaked 
destination pages, which frequently 
include diet pills, pornography and 
muscle building scams, create negative 
and disruptive experiences for people.
On this end, Facebook is utilising 
artificial intelligence and has expanded 
their human review processes to help 
them identify, capture, and verify 
cloaking. The new system allows 
Facebook to better observe differences 
in the type of content served to 
people using our apps compared 
to our own internal systems.

 Adobe research shows SEA consumers prefers buying via desktop 
over smartphones  
Online Shoppers 
Prefer Desktop 
onsumers in Southeast Asia 
(SEA) prefers to purchase 
via 
desktops 
sites 
over 
smartphones, 
an 
Adobe 
research concluded. 
Adobe’s Best of the Best research 
examined average website performance 
versus the top 20% across Asia Pacific 
(APAC). The research is based on 
aggregated and anonymous data from 
100 billion visits to 3,000+ websites 
across the region including India, 
Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Hong 
Kong, Japan and the United States. 
The 
report 
found 
that 
SEA 
experienced the largest decrease in time 
spent on websites at 13%; at the same 
time SEA saw 40% growth in smartphone 
conversion rates. This highlights changing 
consumer habits, as attention spans 
shorten and network connection speeds 
improve across the region. 
Despite declining desktop traffic and a 
corresponding increase in smartphone traffic 
in SEA, desktop conversion rates also grew 
an average 21% YoY and were still more than 
double the conversion rates of smartphones. 
This suggests that even as SEA consumers 
are browsing more on their smartphones, 
they are still purchasing via desktop.
“While consumers in SEA are still 
making their purchases largely on the 
desktop, brands should not ignore the rise 
of smartphones that will fast overtake 
desktops,” says Scott Rigby, Head of Digital 
Transformation, Adobe.  
“Organisations that are overly 
dependent on desktop traffic, and 
not optimizing on smartphones, may 
find themselves at risk of becoming 
obsolete as smartphone share of visits 
continues to multiply.”

4G Driving 
Smartphone Growth
Gartner says component shortage might affect premium

artner releases the latest 
numbers for global smartphone 
sales in the second quarter of 
2017. Totalling 366.2 million 
units, it registers a 6.7% increase over the 
same period the previous year. 
“Although 
demand 
for 
utility 
smartphones remains strong, there is 
growing demand in emerging markets for 
4G smartphones, with more storage, better 
processors and more advanced cameras. 
This is translating into higher demand for 
mid-priced ($150 to $200) smartphones,” said 
Anshul Gupta, research director at Gartner.
Android continues to grow its market 
share with an 87.7% market share while 
iOS accounted for 12.1%. Compared to Q2 
2016, sales of all types of smartphones 
have grown; although there are issues 
concerning rising component costs as 
well as limited supply of certain critical 
components, especially flash memory and 
OLED displays. 
Based on brand breakdown, Samsung 
takes the crown with smartphone sales 
growing 7.5%, thanks to the boost from 
their Galaxy S8 series. Apple on the other 
hand registered a 0.2% decline, although 
the upgrade to iOS 11 is expected to fuel 
growth in the next quarter. 
Majority of the global smartphone 
sales came from Greater China and 
emerging Asia/Pacific markets, with 
market shares of 27.7% and 21.4%, 
respectively. However, smartphone sales 
in Greater China declined year-over-year, 
due to longer replacement cycles, as users 
prefer to buy better smartphones.

LENOVO IS CURRENTLY ONE OF THE TOP NAMES IN PERSONAL COMPUTING, BUT THEY 
ARE NOT RESTING ON THEIR LAURELS
ON THE ROAD TO 
VICTORY

omputers are everywhere and 
chances are, most machines you 
interact with everyday are made by 
Lenovo. From desktop computers 
to servers running on the cloud, Lenovo’s 
reach is all encompassing and far-reaching.
With that said, it isn’t at all surprising 
to know that Lenovo is one of the top names 
in the personal computing world. 
However, innovations are far and few 
in-between these days, thus throwing the 
overall PC market into a state of limbo. This 
results in low engagements and purchasing 
by customers, something Lenovo is eager 
to transform by triggering customers to 
purchase a new device, based on new and 
revolutionary innovations that will wow 
them. This is the vision that is shared by 
Ken Wong, President of Lenovo Asia Pacific 
& Senior Vice President of Lenovo Group.
Lenovo is constantly on the move, 
creating the right product for the right market 
segment. This fulfils the needs, wants and 
requirements of the customers, which is 
what Lenovo is all about with its company’s 
new philosophy: “Customer Centricity”. 
This 
transformation 
has 
been 
going on for quite some time, and it has 
garnered positive results for both Lenovo 
and its customers. The company follows 
a simple guiding principal – “what would 
make our customers’ life better?” The 
answer to this question is what Lenovo is 
focusing on this fiscal year.
One of the ways it is being addressed 
is the establishment of new resources, 
starting from this fiscal year to better 
serve Lenovo’s customers. This includes 
dedicated teams on a global level to find 
out what do customers want. 
The rebranding of Lenovo’s gaming 
line-up is one of the results. Previously 
known as the Y-series, it has since been 
rebranded and is now known only as 
Lenovo Legion. This includes both the 
hardware as well as the community 
being built around the brand. Having a 
branded community is important, as the 
gaming community is a staunch believer of 
community feedback and communication. 
“One of the reasons we started 
Lenovo Legion is because branding is 
important for gamers. In fact, other 
companies have their own brand to make 
them stand out as gamers tend to associate 
better with a brand. A community is also 
important for gamers as it is something 
most gamers are looking forward to. 
Therefore, we have invested heavily in 
nurturing the gaming community and 
building a platform to interact directly with 
our customers,” says Wong.
Through Lenovo’s Customer Centricity 
philosophy, its enterprise segment has also 
started to take shape. Its current range of 
enterprise products are constantly evolving 
through the feedback from customers, 
making it better than before.
Surprisingly, the enterprise market is 
one of Lenovo’s growing segments in APAC 
alongside gaming, bucking the flat growth 
trend that PCs are facing in the region. 
Through various interactions and feedback 
gathered from customers, Lenovo has 
discovered that enterprise requirements 
are becoming more complicated and 
sophisticated than ever before.
“For example, if you look at our data 
centre business, we spent about US$2.5 
billion (bn) as an acquisition from IBM 
a few years ago. This year, we will be 
building an end-to-end dedicated team 
on all levels, from products to R&D as a 
dedicated source for our Data Centre Group 
(DCG) business,” he adds. 
Lenovo’s growth is only made 
possible thanks to the contribution from 
the company’s partners, which includes 
System Integrators (SI), distributors, sales 
and marketing, and the service team that 
works with business partners.
In investing for the future, Lenovo 
has spent over US$1.2bn in R&D over the 
past year; 20 – 30% of that amount has 
been funnelled into Atificial Intelligence 
(AI) research. To further the study, Lenovo 
brought Dr. Yong Rui on board, due to his 
experience in AI to bolster the company’s 
grip in the burgeoning market. Rui oversees 
Lenovo’s corporate technical strategy, R&D 
directions and Lenovo’s corporate Research 
and Technology (R&T) organisation, which 
covers AI, intelligent devices, big data 
analytics, cloud computing 5G network and 
smart lifestyle-related technologies.
Another segment that Lenovo is 
dipping their toes into is its Smart Home. 
The launch of the Smart Assistant at 
CES 2017 signals the company’s entry 
into the smart home segment, which ties 
deeply with the AI R&D. 
Not only is this new segment set to 
boom in the next couple of years, more and 
more consumers and companies, which 
includes developers, are embracing the 
world of Internet of Things (IoT). Lenovo is 
ready to be in the heart of the revolution.
“Devices are no longer confined to a 
screen, keyboard and mouse. A connected 
device, linked to the smart home through 
Smart Assistant, is the future and Lenovo is 
ready to take the journey into the unknown, 
and beyond,” Wong concludes.

echnology has changed the 
way we live, work, learn and 
play. As technology continues 
to evolve and become an ever-
more seamless part of our lives, the 
expectations and demands of consumers 
to enjoy a more personalised experience 
through digital channels, get higher all 
the time. As we become increasingly 
connected, there has been an explosion 
of data that’s transferred through devices, 
servers and cloud. Organisations in almost 
every industry sector are integrating 
their business operations with cloud, 
developing a seamless user experience to 
help them stay relevant and competitive.
As 
Malaysian 
enterprises 
move through this process of digital 
transformation, it’s driving an increasing 
number of companies opting for cloud-
based 
services. 
Organisations 
are 
embracing 
dynamic, 
cloud-based 
operating models to better position 
themselves for cost optimisation and 
increased competitiveness. Malaysia’s 
2017 Budget has placed a strong 
emphasis on digitisation as a step 
towards achieving the nation’s vision of 
a fully connected digital economy. we 
should expect more digital disruption 
as businesses slowly integrate their 
business operations onto cloud.
Potential of Cloud Innovation
Cloud-first strategies are the foundation for 
businesses to stay relevant in today’s fast-
paced world. As businesses move away 
from legacy iT infrastructure, the pattern 
of iT spending is shifting dramatically, with 
more than US$1 trillion in iT spend being 
directly or indirectly affected by the shift to 
cloud during the next five years.
Disruptive technologies such as cloud 
computing have been an accelerating force 
in driving innovation and enabling new 
business models, helping organisations to 
be more agile and creating a new generation 
of start-ups and born-in-the cloud providers. 
Cloud has introduced a significant shift 
in how technology is obtained, used, and 
managed. it also shifts how organisations 
budget and pay for technology services. 
it benefits organisations by giving them 
the ability to trade capital expense for 
variable expense, gain advantage from 
massive economies of scale, make agile 
capacity decisions, increase business 
speed and agility, stop spending money 
running and maintaining data centres, 
and go global in minutes.

Innovating 
on the Cloud
By Laurence Si, The author is the Country Manager, Amazon Web Services Malaysia

SEPT 2017
The true value of cloud computing is 
its ability to optimise business functions in 
ways that can maximise growth and value, 
and its ability to achieve this with the 
most effective end-user effort. Businesses 
are freer than ever before to focus their 
resources where they most matter: on 
driving and growing their business, rather 
than worry about managing iT issues. 
when a business grows, its cloud service 
provider should act as a partner in its 
expansion, through the ability to scale the 
solution in line with business demand, 
ensuring costs are kept in line with growth 
but performance is not compromised.
Making the Transformation to the 
Cloud
in transitioning to the cloud, every 
organisation will experience a unique 
cloud adoption journey, but benefit from 
a structured framework that guides them 
through the process of transforming their 
people, processes, and technology.  in order 
to successfully transition to the cloud, you 
need to understand your organisation’s 
current state, the target state, and the 
actions required to achieve that target 
state. Knowing this will help set goals 
and create work streams to enable staff to 
thrive in the cloud.
Businesses are freed to spend 
time and resources thinking about how 
technology can make their customers’ 
lives better. For example, the Fave Group 
recently migrated Groupon Malaysia to 
its new platform, switching all traffic 
and some three million subscribers from 
the group-buying website to its new 
website running on Amazon web Services 
(AwS). The start-up was able to migrate 
immediately, scale up, optimise services 
and could focus on building and improving 
products instead of managing complex and 
costly iT infrastructure.
Fave uses cloud computing technology 
to accelerate digital transformation to give 
consumers access to everything that’s 
needed to engage in today’s digital world. 
The launch of Fave, running entirely on AwS 
Cloud, helps bridge the communication 
gap by bringing offline merchants online 
to meet the current and evolving needs of 
their consumers. Fave’s collaboration with 
merchants also provides consumers with 
easy-to-use mobile technology that allows 
them to search, purchase and book their 
favorite meals or leisure activities – all 
within the palm of their hands.
Grab, a ride-sharing service which 
was locally founded in Malaysia in 2012, 
is another company that has rapidly 
grown its presence in the Southeast Asia 
region by innovating on the cloud. Grab 
uses real-time data computation and 
data streams to support over 1.5 million 
bookings per month in Southeast Asia. 
By utilising AwS Cloud, Grab can 
minimise the resources needed to manage 
iT infrastructure, and instead shift its focus 
to developing innovative services and 
features to deliver a seamless consumer 
experience. For instance, Grab introduced 
GrabChat, an instant messaging platform 
embedded within the mobile app, allowing 
drivers to communicate their estimated 
arrival times without leaving the app screen, 
while passengers are able to receive more 
responsive feedback and share their exact 
locations. Since the launch of the feature, 
the company saw a significant reduction in 
ride cancellations.
Fave and Grab reveal how cloud 
services open up a realm of possibilities 
that at one time, organisations could 
never have imagined. enterprises and 
start-ups alike are moving away from 
legacy thinking, and embracing the digital 
revolution to bring innovation for their own 
organisations. in turn, they’re changing the 
way we live.

The People 
Element of Digital 
Transformation
By KT Ong, The author it the Country Manager – Malaysia, Dell EMC
number of recent studies have 
been examining how changes 
in technology, such as the 
internet of Things (ioT) from a 
consumer standpoint, the wholesale move 
to the ‘Third Platform’ is impacting business. 
Most of these studies focused on the 
technologies themselves: from hardware 
and software to the new currency of 
business – the data, to those focusing 
on how to transform business and digital 
operating infrastructure, which will help 
defend businesses from being eclipsed by 
nimbler start-ups born in the digital age. 
Among 
conversations 
about 
technology-driven 
transformation, 
a distinct constant is the necessary 
changes a company must make to 
its operating model, processes and 
organisational structure, in order to 
succeed in the digital era.
Organisations’ inability to facilitate 
and accelerate the transformation of 
their organisational model at or ahead 
of advancing technologies is an age-
old problem. The shame of knowing our 
A
inadequacies are still very much alive 
and in full view, and has amplified the 
effects of the digital era, creating a space 
for new firms to step-in and cause all 
manner of disruption to many traditional 
business models. 
But organisations aren’t faceless, 
empty buildings. They are run by people. 
while technology does the heavy 
lifting, it is people who intentionally 
commission the labour. Dell’s global 
Digital Transformation index, unveils 
some of the shortcomings experienced 
by companies in this area. Obvious 
indicators include the fact that only 
39% of businesses in the Asia Pacific 
and Japan (APJ) region say the Board is 
driving digital transformation, and that 
one of the top barriers to transformation 
is a lack of in-house skills and expertise.
To try and understand this more 
deeply, it is important to take a look at 
three key attributes of a digital business, 
as defined by business leaders and used 
as a measure of success within the 
Digital Transformation index:
1. Innovate in Agile Ways
The pressure for business leaders to 
act and transform is extremely high – 
61% of respondents in the APJ region 
indicating that they have already 
experienced significant disruption to 
their industries as a result of digital 
technologies, with 83% considering 
digital start-ups as a threat.
The term “if it ain’t broke, don’t 
fix it” is familiar to all of us. The tricky 
thing is – how do we know what is and 
isn’t broken? A business process might 
work ‘fine’ in the present day but should 
we settle for just ‘fine’; and will ‘fine’ 
sustain the business in the near-future? 
Digital start-ups are carving-up 
the business landscape. in just 3-5 
years, 52% of businesses believe 
they may become obsolete. So, what 
isn’t broken today, could well be 
broken tomorrow. How do we prepare 
for this? To enable organisations to 
address the unforeseeable future, 
they need to welcome innovation 
and agility in all shapes and forms. An 

101
SEPT 2017
interesting phenomenon has started 
to take shape in many corporations 
who are struggling departmentally 
with digital transformation. with the 
advent and availability of Software-
as-a-Service (SaaS) and Cloud-based 
applications, users in the business 
community are now going outside of 
traditional iT teams and practices to 
fund and implement new solutions 
themselves. These are often interpreted 
as rogue activities that need to be 
tracked down, assimilated into current 
infrastructure and governed more 
closely. This isn’t seeing them for what 
they are: innovative ways to solve 
real business problems or indicators 
that some business processes have 
outlived their sell-by date. 
According 
to 
the 
Digital 
Transformation 
index, 
74% 
of 
businesses in APJ admit to not 
innovating well and in an agile way 
organisation-wide. Clearly, something 
needs 
to 
change. 
Releasing 
employees’ shackles and opening the 
door to creative ingenuity could be a 
company’s saving grace.
For leaders of transformation, 
it is important to assess the need 
for change in various aspects of 
business operations, be it driven by 
operational enhancement, market 
need or new revenue opportunity. By 
opening our eyes and understanding 
that the physical world of networking, 
application availability and remote 
access are no longer limitations for 
transactional systems or processes, 
we could, for instance, develop a 
series of micro services that allow 
the safe and flexible transfer of data 
across an ecosystem, while saving 
money and breaking down barriers. 
in Malaysia for instance, the 
Companies Commission of Malaysia 
(SSM) highlighted that the government 
is expected to deliver quality customer 
experience, despite a limited budget. 
This requires a change in the way of 
thinking and working, and choosing 
the right technology platform becomes 
an essential component in its digital 
transformation journey. To do this, SSM 
is using data analytics - the focus is on 
delivering data analytics, audit and risk 
analytics and analytics applications 
not only to internal users, but also to 
external users i.e. the customers.
2. Predict New Opportunities
An integral part of digital transformation, 
business analytics based services are 
on track for a four-year compound 
growth rate of 20.3% between 2016 
and 2020, according to iDC. According 
to a separate study which includes 
Malaysia, 42% of the respondents from 
Malaysian organisations are planning 
to 
deploy 
cloud-based 
analytics 
software in the next one to two years 
while some have already deployed such 
solutions. As organisations continue to 
shift more critical applications into the 
cloud platform, the demand for cloud 
analytics will grow exponentially. 
However, taking data generated 
by enterprise systems such as eRP, 
Sales, 
Marketing, 
Manufacturing, 
and placing the right bets on the right 
insights through reporting and analytics 
is still a practice that is yet to be refined. 
with the arrival of so many different 
systems, external and internal options, 
rapid transformation of business 
processes and people, there are now 
only pockets of ‘data stability’ that 
can be achieved.
For someone in the traditional 
reporting space for example, this 
presents an emotional challenge 
as stability, accuracy and trend 
measurement (the staples of historical 
reporting) are thrown out of the window 
and replaced with a ‘free market 
economy’ of reporting and analytic 
capabilities that can produce divine 
insight but can also be undercut by nay-
sayers who question accuracy or quality. 
Finding just the right blend between the 
extremes of accuracy and accountability 
or innovation and daring is where strong 
leaders can differentiate themselves 
and their teams.
Unfortunately, predicting the 
future and being able to act on these 
opportunities is still the unknown, 
volatile part of the equation. As the 
Digital Transformation index backs-
up: 65% of respondents admit to not 
acting on intelligence in real-time.
3. Demonstrate Transparency and 
Trust
Transparency and trust is often a 
golden rule in customer interaction. 
However, when looking inwards 
toward 
organisational 
digital 
transformation, 
transparency 
and 
trust take on an entirely different 
meaning. An organisation’s ability 
to create a safe environment, where 
team members are encouraged to 
share ideas, take risks and shake 
things-up, could be businesses’ only 
way to survive in the new economy. 
it is a huge leap of faith, and 
many companies won’t have the 
stomach for it. They won’t be able to 
overcome the default position of ‘but 
it is not possible to do it that way’ 
or ‘we tried that before’ or ‘how will 
we have a process to govern this’ 
and fall back into the old analogue 
ways of managing and executing their 
business objectives. This is reflected in 
the fact that only 30% of respondents 
are demonstrating transparency and 
trust well and organisation-wide. 
However, if we can pull together 
those people who do believe and are 
willing to put themselves on the line, 
and embrace opportunities brought 
about by emerging technologies, we 
can truly grow the business through 
digital transformation. 
These are just three of the five pillars 
outlined in the Digital Transformation 
index, but they are also the ones that 
most directly relate to the people and 
operational side of the equation. By 
taking the time to recognise the impact of 
Digital Transformation on organisations, 
and especially to individuals within them, 
and becoming aware of the pitfalls of 
attempting to drive change simply through 
technology, we will be able to influence 
business success more directly.

Into a Whole New World
First and foremost, I must warn that there 
are spoilers ahead as the developers 
have crafted such an intriguing mystery, 
I couldn’t avoid them in this review.
Persona 5 wastes no time throwing 
the player into the thick of a mystery, 
introducing the main character in the middle 
of a casino heist and the basics of the game 
are explained by a mysterious voice. One 
thing leads to another and the protagonist 
is ambushed and sent to an interrogation 
room. The story is then told through a series 
of flashbacks starting at the point where 
our hero first arrives at his new home and 
a glimpse of his backstory. 
As you progress past the first couple 
of hours of the game, you learn of the 
Metaverse - an alternate world where 
an individual’s deepest and darkest 
desires are manifested in physical form 
as Shadows. In this world, the hero and 
his merry band of thieves utilize their 
Personas, a manifestation of the user’s 
personality or ‘mask’, to face their foes. 
It’s here they begin the walk down the 
path of Phantom Thieves, attempting to 
change society by stealing the hearts and 
treasures of wicked Shadows.
Like previous Persona games, core 
gameplay is divided into two basic parts, 
the classic RPG dungeon crawler and a 
social simulator. While these two styles 
might not seem to have much in common 
with one another, Persona 5 has managed 
to interlace these two concepts brilliantly. 
Despite being a master thief in the 
Metaverse, the hero must still keep up 
appearances as a normal high school 
student. This means keeping your room 
clean, studying for exams, hanging out 
with friends and even house chores. All 
these activities lead to improved social 
stats like guts, knowledge and charm 
which will in turn affect many important 
events throughout your journey. 
As time is finite in the game, 
managing your time effectively as a 
student and thief will be key tackling 
any challenges the game throws at you. 
Although, I must admit that over hours 
of gameplay, I ended up developing 
a connection with the hero and his 
ragtag gang, the story and writing 
does a really good job of evolving the 
characters over time. 
In the metaverse, the Shadows with 
the strongest desires end up creating 
Palaces, strongholds of their power and 
it’s up to the players to break in and steal 
the Shadow’s most prized possessions. 
While this section is more of 
your standard dungeon crawling RPG, 
the designers have decided not to go 
with procedurally generated dungeons. 
Instead, you have painstakingly maze-like 
Palaces, designed from the ground up. 
Each location has its own set of puzzles, 
security measures and traps to trip the 
team up when they break in. 
Certain Palaces will be harder to 
break into requiring both action in the 
Metaverse and the real world. In between 
Palaces, there’s a large underground area 
called Mementos where players can 
encounter other Shadows as well.
Graphic Eye Candy
Combat within the game is fluid despite being 
a basic turn-based combat system where 
each team member takes turn to attack. 
There is a rock-paper-scissors mechanic 
involved when it comes to elements and 
as exploiting enemy weaknesses results 
in an extra turn, players are encouraged 
to constantly experiment with different 
elemental builds.

attack or negotiate with the enemy to 
either give some cash, items or just 
straight out join you as a Persona. It’s 
amazing how simple the combat system 
and yet there’s enough depth to really 
customise a team to your liking.
Persona 5 is incredibly stylish, 
especially when you consider how 
flashy the previous Persona games 
were. This is Inception and Ocean’s 
Eleven wrapped in slick black and red 
anime wrapper. 
Moving from scene to scene, 
location to location, the transitions are 
seamless and even the loading screens 
have purpose. Every single element of 
this game is so well-polished that the 
hours just flew past as I was consumed 
by this game. Unwilling to stop, always 
wanting to find out what would happen 
around the next day – rinse and 
repeat. All while having the infectious 
background tune in my head.
I’m going to put it out there and 
say that Persona 5 is definitely one of 
the best JRPGs that have come out in
the past few years and will eventually be 
an entry that will be fondly remembered 
by fans. Content within the game is 
abundant and the level of polish is 
nothing short of amazing. I’m not joking 
when I say it will consume your life.

TOO BIG FOR 
ITS BOOTS
By Teh Wi-Liam
By Teh Wi-Liam
Gigantic
t seems the trend of gaming has turned its attention towards 
MOBA-based games with the likes of Dota 2, League of 
Legends and Overwatch taking the pole position. This has left 
many other games with plenty of potential in the dust; Gearbox 
Software’s very own Battleborn was slated to be one of the 
biggest MOBA-centric first-person shooter games on the PS4 
but didn’t see the light of day thanks to Blizzard’s Overwatch.
Having got my start in MOBA games with Dota 2, the bar has 
been set at a high standard for me to be pleased with the outcome of 
today’s MOBA games. While League of Legends will never pique my 
interest and Overwatch just looks clunky, Gigantic did strike a chord 
that it could potentially be fun.
Straightforward Gameplay
While most MOBA games are pretty much straightforward, 
Gigantic keeps it to the bare minimum in terms of simplicity. 
Instead of breaking into the enemy base and destroying it 
like Dota 2 and League of Legends, Gigantic keeps its focus 
on magical beings called Guardians that is protected by 
five players on each team. Each team’s main objective is to 
capture ‘power circles’ at which they can summon defences 
or monsters to fight alongside them to increase the overall 
health bar of the Guardian. Once a team reaches 100, the 
Guardian is active and will proceed to attack the other team’s 
Guardian. Whichever team attacks the Guardian three times

in a row wins the game. I guess you could say it has a very 
Heroes of the Storm feel to it as its more objective-based as 
compared to other MOBAs.
Time to Get Cracking
Much like all MOBA games, each character is unique and comes 
with special abilities and roles to help balance out your team. 
When first starting out, you only get five characters to choose 
from but more will be unlocked the more you level up. This is a 
ploy that has been adopted by many other MOBA games to get 
you to play more, thus unlocking more characters. Why couldn’t 
everything just be unlocked and give new players a chance to test 
out all the characters? Is that too much to ask for?
Thankfully, the Practice Arena mode gives you full access 
to all characters but there isn’t much you can do except train your 
craft with each hero. The Practice Arena also gives you various 
enemies that you can battle against, which is a challenge on its 
own right. Either the tougher enemies in the Practice Arena is 
really that difficult or I am just losing my touch when it comes to 
video games…
It Takes Forever
Sadly, I don’t think there are many Gigantic players in Southeast 
Asia as it took forever to queue for a matchmaking game. Unless 
you have a team of five who are willing to play against bots until 
you’re at a high enough level to start playing regularly, you will be 
quite put off with the whole matchmaking system Gigantic has.
Why Does Everyone Do This?
This begs the question: why do many of these new age MOBA-centric 
games tend to limit new players into playing with themselves (that 
came out wrongly) or with bots until they are of a certain level to be 
able to play with actual gamers from around the world?
One way in understanding this new matchmaking concept 
is to not ruin the experience for everyone else, especially when 
there’s a newbie on their team who would know what is going 
on in the game. Sure, this limits the number of toxic players in 
the game but it also discourages new players from picking up the 
game due to this type of matchmaking system.
Even with games like Battleborn and Paladins, it all 
uses the same system, which is what has stunted its growth 
in the gaming scene. If Gigantic wants to grow, it had better 
come up with a better way gamers, both new and old, can 
enjoy the game without having to go through the frustration 
(or I could just be 
salty because it 
made me wait too 
long for a game).

BETA-TESTING A 
GRAND TOUR
By Sharil
By Sharil
Gran Turismo Sport Beta
riving can be a chore to some 
while it’s a pleasure to many 
others. This is especially true 
for driving simulation games 
that pepper the gaming landscape. We 
have seen some lemons in our reviews, 
but not the Gran Turismo Sport. The 
beta version of the game offers a peek 
at what we can expect from the full 
game – and we like it very, very much.
True to Life
What stands out in any Gran Turismo 
game is the level of detail that goes 
into the game, thanks to the developer: 
Polyphony Digital. This is also true 
in Gran Turismo Sport (GTS), where 
the ‘sport in the name refers to a new 
mode that will be offered to players. 
Sport mode will pit players against one 
another in an online simulation where 
they will race to see who will top the 
leader board and who is the best (digital) 
driver around the track.
The first time we took to the wheel 
in GTS, we were reminded why the 
game series has been a staple on the 
PlayStation platform. Fun fact – the first 
Gran Turismo game was released way 
back in 1997 on the original PlayStation, 
and the upcoming Gran Turismo Sport 
will be the seventh iteration of the game. 
Sheer realism is on the plate with 
GTS and it is evident, right down to the 
driver’s cockpit that you experience 
through the screen. Every nuance of 
driving is replicated, down to the smallest 
of details. Every roar of the engine and 
screeching of the wheels gives you the 
realistic feeling of actually being in the 
car, which brings you just that bit closer to 
being a real race car driver.
How realistic is the game? When 
taking a corner while driving, you may be 
blinded by the ray of sunlight hitting you 
square in the face. It can’t get any more 
real than that – Polyphony Digital has made 
strides in ensuring you are getting the most 
realistic experience when you’re behind the 
wheel in GTS.
Multi-class Driving
In the beta, we were giving the choice 
between three racing classes: the N300, 
GR.4 and GR.3. This translates into stock 
production cars, cars with slight racing 
modifications and full-bore, race-tuned 
production cars. With the focus placed 
towards the competitive side of the 
game, we essentially raced throughout 
the day, trying to edge out that little extra 
performance from the cars given. We made 
changes in just about every parameter 
possible to make sure we can be on top of 
the leader board and qualify for the race 
against other players.
What makes the system different 
this time is the new matchmaking system 
incorporated into the game. When 
going against an opponent, your driver 
and sportsmanship ratings are key into 
matching with your opponent. These two

new indexes measure a player’s overall 
skill with a rating sale from E, D, C, B, A 
and S. We may see this system being fully 
implemented into the real game when 
it starts shipping by the end of the year. 
Of course, the sportsmanship part of the 
system was ignored by most players, so we 
hope that this will not be the case when 
game is gold.
Waiting Game 
One feature that didn’t enamour us was 
the waiting game; you can’t just pick up 
your controller and driver whenever you 
feel like it. There is a pre-set wait time for 
you to drive and you must qualify to race. 
The downside is that you will be stuck on 
the track, trying to chase for that elusive 0.1 
second to qualify. The upside, you’re stuck on 
the track, which the game renders beautifully.
This sneak-peek look of the 
upcoming GTS is quite interesting as it 
gave us something to whet our appetite 
while patiently waiting for it to be 
released. The beta was also a way for 
the developers to gain insights into 
what gamers really want and the data 
collected will be used to make the game 
even better. We, on the other hand, were 
busy driving around and enjoying the 
scenery with the cars available to us; this 
is also a perfect way to enjoy the Gran 
Turismo series as the name of the game 
in Italian stands for “Grand Touring.”

With the entire hall filled with 
rambunctious laughter and chatter, KL 
Live Centre was buzzing with gamers 
from all around Southeast Asia either 
waiting in-line to test out upcoming 
games or waiting to hear from one of the 
keynotes. The first keynote was about 
Gran Turismo Sport, which was then 
followed up with a Taiko no Tatsujin 
performance, 
a 
popular 
rhythmic 
drumming game by Namco in arcades. 
It then took to Monster Hunter: World 
to showcase its brand new open-world 
platform; Marvel v Capcom: Infinite, which 
talked more about the game’s mechanics 
and how the Marvel and Capcom universe 
would intertwine; and lastly, the Final 
Fantasy XV VR (FFXV VR) presentation, 
which focused on the VR capabilities of 
bringing a popular, yet nerve-wrecking 
mini-game from the popular title onto the 
VR platform: fishing.
Aside from hearing about the 
keynotes, there were plenty of beta versions 
of AAA game titles scattered across the 
two floors of KL Live Centre, with one of 
the main attractions boasting the longest 
line: FIFA 18. Another popular game that 
saw its fair share of waiting was Gran 
Turismo Sport, which was played in its own 
racing pods, as well as other games like 
Marvel v Capcom: Infinite, Detroit: Become 
Human, Far Cry 5, Matterfall, Stifled and 
Inpatient to name a few.
There was also a mini-game that 
took place throughout the course of the 
day where participants to PSX Asia had to 
play a number of games to win a stamp, 
which can then be redeemed for goodies 
like PS Plus and PS Store goodies.

iquid are doing it!” A phrase 
that 
echoes 
throughout 
the arena whenever Team 
Liquid were to pull off a 
great victory. Originally coined by David 
‘LD’ Gorman back in TI3 where Liquid 
upset one of the tournament favourites 
back then, LGD Gaming from China. This 
time around, Liquid have finally done it 
by taking a clean 3-0 sweep over another 
Chinese powerhouse, Newbee.
TI7 in general was a grand event as 
it broke eSports gaming history once again 
as it trounced the previous prize pool with a 
total of US$24,787,916, making it the largest 
prize pool ever in eSports history. The first 
day of TI7 saw 18 teams being separated 
into two groups, who would go through 
a gruelling four days of best-of-twos to 
ultimately decide its placing.
Day One
After the Group Stages were done and 
dusted, TI7 said goodbye to Malaysian 
favourites, Fnatic from Group A and 
HellRaisers from Group B. Day One of the 
Main Event in the Key Arena in Seattle saw 
a total of six games being played, two of 
which were a best-of-three for the Upper 
Bracket and the rest being a best-of-one 
in the Lower Bracket. The Upper Bracket 
matches saw both Liquid and Evil Geniuses 
(EG) losing out to Invictus Gaming (iG) and 
Newbee, respectively. Day One also saw 
four more teams being shown the door, 
which comprised of Execration from The 
Philippines, Cloud 9 from North America, 
iG Vitality from China and Infamous from 
South America (fun fact: TI7 was the first TI 
to feature a team from the South American 
region.) These teams were bested by Team 
Secret, Team Empire, Digital Chaos (DC) 
and OG, respectively.
Day two
Focusing on the other two matches of 
the Upper Bracket, Day Two saw LGD.
ForeverYoung (LFY) knock down TNC Pro 
Team from The Philippines to the Lower 
Bracket while Virtus Pro (VP) managed to 
bring down the other LGD franchise, LGD 
Gaming, both hailing from China. Day Two 
also saw the rise of Liquid as they knocked 
out Team Secret, who took down Infamous 
a day earlier. Team Empire, who eliminated 
Cloud 9, took out another North American 
favourite, Evil Geniuses (TI5 champions.)
Day three
Day three saw the rest of Round 2 of the 
Lower Bracket matches play out between 
TNC Pro Team against OG and LGD Gaming 
versus DC. What was touted to be a repeat 
of TNC’s famous upset over OG during TI6, 
it turned out to be the other way around as 
OG had the upper hand this time and exacted 
revenge over TNC. After eliminating iG Vitality 
in Day One, DC’s run came to an end via LGD 
Gaming, a sad way to go for the first runner 
up of TI6. The rest of Day Three saw Round 
Two of the Upper Bracket between iG and 
Newbee as well as LFY against VP. Newbee 
wound up victorious and so did LFY, which set 
up the Upper Bracket Final to determine who 
would be the first Grand Final Entry.

Day Four
Liquid were tested further in Day Four, 
having to play two best-of-threes against 
Team Empire and VP, respectively. Taking 
on two teams from the CIS region, Liquid 
were pushed to the limit but eventually 
prevailed, sending themselves further up 
into the Lower Bracket Semifinal. Day Four 
was also the day multiple Major winners, 
OG got knocked out by LGD, which marks 
another disappointing loss for the boys 
in green as the dream of lifting the Aegis 
remains as it is. The rest of Day Four also 
showcased the All-Star Captain’s Mode 
match, which featured 10 players who 
were chosen through a voting system 
via The International 2017 Battle Pass 
Compendium. This was the first time a 
prize pool of US$100,000 was featured for 
the All-Star Captain’s Mode match, which 
was ultimately won by Team Radiant.
Day Five
Day Five saw LGD go up against Chinese 
counterpart iG where LGD came out on 
top to book their place in the Lower 
Bracket Semifinal against Liquid. The 
Upper Bracket Final was also played 
on Day Five between Newbee and LFY, 
another all-Chinese match-up. Sadly, 
LFY was knocked down to the Lower 
Bracket Final, awaiting the results 
between Liquid and LGD.
Day Six
Another demanding task at hand, Liquid 
first faced off against LGD, which ended in 
a 2-0 sweep and brought them to the Lower 
Bracket Final. They then had to face LFY, 
which turned out to be a back-and-forth 
match. Ultimately, Liquid were victorious 
with a 2-1 win, sealing their Top 2 placing 
in the Grand Finals.
Day Seven
Although Liquid decimated Newbee 
in all three games, it was no walk in 
the park. Game One saw Liquid totally 
outclass Newbee in terms of drafts and 
play style while Game Two was a more 
even match-up with Newbee pulling 
ahead at certain parts of the game. 
However, Liquid were able to put their 
heroes to good use and created space 
all around the map and pushing out the 
sidelanes, ultimately causing Newbee 
to call the ‘GG’ and taking it to a third 
and final game.
Game Three saw Liquid taking total 
control of the game, not allowing Newbee 
any chance to take over. Although it did take 
Liquid just over 45 minutes to crack Newbee, 
the Chinese were forced to call out the ‘GG’ 
once more, gifting Liquid the victory they so 
deserved. Liquid walked away with a cool US$ 
10,862,683 while Newbee had to settle for 
US $3,950,067. The other two Chinese teams, 
LFY and LGD, took home US$2,592,231 and 
US $1,728,154 respectively.

DJI Spark Mini Drone (Meadow Green) Fly More Combo
The usage of drones has been gaining momentum within the last few years. We have also seen beginners 
and enthusiasts picking up professional drones for aerial imaging. While such devices provide users with 
top-of-the-line aerial imaging experience, inexperienced drone pilots - beginners and enthusiasts alike - may 
risk crashing them.

its smallest and smartest drone. The Spark makes it easier for operators to capture and share those special 
moments on-the-go. 
 
As the world’s leader in drone technology, DJI delivers features that give users with great video- and photo-
taking capabilities in this small package. Seize the moment with the Spark as it empowers you to push your 
boundaries through its intelligent flight control options, mechanical gimbal and incredible image quality.

Lending a Hand
Users are able to control the device with hand 
gestures alone, which is made possible through its 
innovative 3D Sensing System. Features like Gesture 
Mode and PalmControl allow users to control the 
Spark with hand movements as commands, which 
include following the users, take aerial selfies, send 
the drone away and beckon for it to come back. 
 
With its Record gesture, users can now start and 
stop video recording with a simple arm movement. 
This gives you the freedom and flexibility to capture 
beautiful, smooth videos whenever the right moment 
strikes.
Smart and Nimble
Another innovative feature found in the Spark is 
the QuickShot Intelligent Flight Modes, which makes 
creating professional videos fun and easy. Through 
the use of QuickShot, the Spark can automatically 
fly along a preset flight path while recording a short 
video and track the subject along the way. 
 
Moreover, you can now control the circular direction 
of the drone with the Circle and Helix modes for better 
cinematic control when filming. Other QuickShot 
modes also include Dronie and Rocket modes, which 
increases the height gained and smooth out the 
camera’s pitch respectively. 
Accessories Galore
Out of the box, the Spark itself is loads of fun and easy 
to use. To heighten your aerial imaging and drone-
operating experience, the Fly More Combo offers a 
breadth of accessories to pair with the Spark. While 
we found the Spark’s hand gestures capabilities to be 
innovative, sometimes having greater flight control is 
needed. Navigate your way around the sky with the 
Spark Remote Controller, and you’ll be sure to always 
be in control. Other accessories in combo include a 
battery charging hub; a set of propeller guard; two 
sets of quick release folding propellers; two intelligent 
flight batteries; and a shoulder bag.
