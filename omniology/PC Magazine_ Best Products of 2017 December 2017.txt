YOUR QUESTIONS

Q:  
I found out today that my Amazon account was hacked and email 
address changed to an address with an .ru domain‚Ä¶ I began to 
wonder if my Mac had a keystroke logger, since I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve 
fallen for any phishing emails. So after removing Kaspersky a few months ago, 
I thought I would check out security software again. I just read your review of 
Bitdefender for Mac on PCMag.com... When when you click ‚Äúbuy‚Äù on their 
site, you are offered an additional purchase of virus and spyware removal for 
$99.99 for one intervention.
Removing Malware
A reader asked about security software that appears to 
charge extra to remove the problems it Ô¨Ånds. Security 
Lead Analyst Neil J. Rubenking sets the record straight.

problem. I checked out Norton, and it also offers an extra-charge removal program. I 
also saw a blog online where someone was complaining that McAfee was going to 
charge them extra to remove what it found. Apparently this is common practice. 
It would be extremely helpful if your [reviews would go] over these extra charges.

A:  
All of the major antivirus products both detect malware and remove it. 
Many of them offer a separate, extra-cost service whereby agents 
UHPRWHLQWR\RXUFRPSXWHUDQG¬ø[SUREOHPVVR\RXGRQ¬∂WKDYHWR
Most of those will apply this remote remediation at no cost in the rare event that the 
AV detects something it can‚Äôt remove. McAfee and Norton in particular have a

It‚Äôs not uncommon for people to see these extra cost ‚Äúconcierge‚Äù services and think 
that means the antivirus won‚Äôt remove malware. Maybe bad marketing? Because 
that just isn‚Äôt the case.

Fast Forward: GumGum‚Äôs Ophir 
Tanz on Bad Ads and Good AI
Fast Forward is a series of conversations with tech leaders hosted by Dan 
Costa, PCMag‚Äôs Editor-in-Chief. Dan recently spoke with Ophir Tanz, CEO and 
Founder of GumGum, which is quickly becoming a full-stack vertical-AI 
VROXWLRQFRPSDQ\7KH\VSRNHDERXWWKHFXUUHQWDUWL¬øFLDOLQWHOOLJHQFHERRP
and its potential to alter every business it touches. 
Dan Costa: How are you using AI today in the advertising space?
Ophir Tanz: GumGum, at its core, is a computer-vision company. We express 
that technology in a variety of ways. Our largest business unit is our advertising 
unit, and we invented an advertising format called In-Image Advertising, where 
we currently work with about 70 percent of Fortune 100 brands and many of 
the largest publishers in the world. What we do is we contextually place 
marketing messages in line with content users are actively engaging with. We‚Äôll 
identify the context of images, in this case, and actually align marketing 
messages to it.
FAST FORWARD
WHAT‚ÄôS NEW NOW

You‚Äôve got a number of examples of this on your 
website. It‚Äôs really cool. I don‚Äôt think most people 
know that it‚Äôs happening when they actually 
encounter a website and they see this type of 
advertisement. They think it may have been 
programmed that way, but you‚Äôre actually taking 
the content of the photo and then delivering an ad 
that‚Äôs based on the photo, not necessarily the site 
or even the article.
Correct. The idea is that users visit sites and photos are 
typically the hero unit of a given webpage. If you look at 
any eye-tracking study, you‚Äôll see that most of the heat 
is centered around photos. The idea is to create a very 
native placement but also display it properly. It tends to 
be relatively impactful, and it has really nice

single inventory opportunity.
What we‚Äôre able to do is load up ads when they‚Äôre 
relevant to that user in the proper context at any 
moment in time. That also has the great effect of 
producing a much better user experience, because you 
see our ads much more infrequently, but when you do,

of empowering publishers, in many cases, to remove 
other standard formats from their properties and return 
real estate to those publisher sites to use for content.
In the studies that I‚Äôve seen, it‚Äôs not that people 
hate the ads‚Ä¶ They hate the volume, they hate 
the intrusiveness, they hate the pop-ups. Seeing 
the ad actually doesn‚Äôt bother them, as long as it 
doesn‚Äôt interrupt the experience.
I think that‚Äôs a really big problem in the industry today. 
If you look at your traditional IAB [Interactive 
Advertising Bureau]  ad formats, you have a number of

issues. One is that they need to load 100 percent of the 
time, so no matter what, an ad is loading. You obviously 
have huge viewability issues associated with that. When 
the webpage loads, 100 percent of the IAB ads on that 
page will load, and you might only scroll a third of the 
way down. Advertisers are paying for those impressions, 
but they‚Äôre never getting seen. They‚Äôre creating no 
value. It‚Äôs effectively equivalent to, I think last time we 
calculated it, 10 or 12 billion dollars a year just being 
burned, going up in smoke.
That‚Äôs a huge problem. We only load our formats when 
the relevant content comes into view of the browser. 
There‚Äôs almost no wasted impressions whatsoever. I 
really do believe that the future of advertising, 
especially as you move to different devices like tablets 
and phones, is going to be a much more integrated and 
selective experience. The idea of advertising is to get a 
PHVVDJHDFURVVWRDXVHUWKDWKDVWKHEHQH¬øWRIIRONV
making money so they can continue to deliver, in many 
cases, free content. Our perspective is ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make the 
ads seen. Let‚Äôs make it very respectful, but let‚Äôs show it 
infrequently,‚Äù and we think that ultimately is better for 
all the relevant stakeholders.
Let‚Äôs talk a little bit about the sports division that 
you operate in. It‚Äôs a really interesting way of 
opening up inventory and doing something with 
computer vision that just wouldn‚Äôt be practical if 
you were doing it by hand, or by humans.
Well, the way it‚Äôs been done for the last few decades has 
been by hand and by humans. That‚Äôs a massively error-
prone approach, because what typically happens is 
you‚Äôll take, say, 10 minutes or some segment of a multi-
hour game. You‚Äôll ship that off to a place, typically, 
overseas. You‚Äôll have folks literally manually tag where 
those sponsors are appearing and the relative quality of

every single exposure. Then they extrapolate that in a 
black box to the overall value.
So it‚Äôs somebody looking at the tape, identifying 
the Coca-Cola logo on the outÔ¨Åeld sign, and then 
saying how long, how many seconds it was in view.
Yes, and the quality of that video. Was is obfuscated? 
Was it blurry? How big was it? Stuff like that. What 
we‚Äôve done is we‚Äôve taken, actually, the same 
methodology, largely, but we do it all programmatically 
using computer vision. It‚Äôs a really elegant 
implementation of that technology, because we‚Äôre able 
to look at things comprehensively. We look at every 
single moment of every video, every highlight video, 
every social image, and identify where all those 
exposures are appearing, but also the quality of those 
exposures. Then we‚Äôre enabling all the relative 
stakeholders, in this case, rights-holders and brands, to 
dig into any moment so that there‚Äôs no dispute around 
what the actual quality metric is.
Sponsorship is a big business. There‚Äôs a lot of money 
spent on these things, and there‚Äôs a lot of negotiation 
that has to go on in order to arrive at the appropriate 
fee. This takes a lot of the guesswork out of that effort.

What We Love Most
This Month BY PCMAG STAFF
STEELSERIES ARCTIS 3 BLUETOOTH 
GAMING HEADSET 
We love the Nintendo Switch, but its voice chat is pretty terrible. Fortunately, the SteelSeries 
Ô¨Åxes one of the Switch‚Äôs most glaring problems: Since it allows for both a wired and 
Bluetooth connection, you can physically plug the headset into the Switch while wirelessly 
pairing to your phone. The headset then mixes game audio from the tablet with the voice 
chat coming from the Switch mobile app or a superior alternative like Discord. So you only 
have to deal with one cord. And the bidirectional microphone Ô¨Ålters out background noise 
while helping your voice sound great.

PN Logs Helped Unmask Alleged ‚ÄòNet 
Stalker‚Äù is an alarming headline, as the 
whole point of using a virtual private 
network is to surf unnoticed. But as The Register 
reported, that‚Äôs what happened with a man 
named Ryan Lin. He was arrested for 
cyberstalking his former roommate in part 
because Lin‚Äôs VPN provider, PureVPN, assisted 
the feds in their investigation by handing over 
logs. That sounds bad, but in this case at least, 
PureVPN appears to have acted within its stated 
privacy policy. You can still trust VPNs as much 
as you ever did.
First, let me be clear: Lin‚Äôs alleged behavior was 
gross. He reportedly went to enormous lengths to 
harass and demoralize a woman. The police 
partnering with technology companies to arrest 
him is an example of the system working, and the 
fact that he was arrested shows how far we‚Äôve 
come in regarding online activities as actual 
crimes. Just a few years ago, doxxing someone 
wouldn‚Äôt have been included in a list of vile 
criminal activities. I hope anyone who would 
emulate his actions thinks better of it as a result.
With that aside, it seems clear that this man 
would have been arrested without the

information acquired from PureVPN. The 
Register reported:
‚ÄúThe complaint revealed, he made a fundamental 
error by using a work computer for some of his 
campaign, and even though he‚Äôd been terminated 
and the OS reinstalled on the machine, there were 
footprints left behind for investigators to associate 
Lin with the 16-month campaign against Smith.‚Äù
The report doesn‚Äôt go into detail about what 
information was recovered from Lin‚Äôs work 
FRPSXWHUEXWLWVLQYROYHPHQWLVVLJQL¬øFDQW
Security researchers are always quick to point out 
that if you can obtain the target‚Äôs device, you‚Äôve 
effectively won.
Here‚Äôs what The Register says investigators 
received from PureVPN:

that their service was accessed by the same 
customer from two originating IP addresses,‚Äô 
claim the Feds (allegedly, those IP addresses were 
at Lin‚Äôs work and home addresses).‚Äù
It‚Äôs easy to read that and assume that PureVPN‚Äî
and perhaps all VPN companies‚Äîare monitoring 
users‚Äô activities and are willing to hand over logs 
to investigators. But I don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs the case. 
To me, this sounds like PureVPN simply

originating IP address, the address the man 
connected from, and the IP address of the VPN

In its privacy policy, PureVPN says a few 
important things:

PureVPN‚Äôs privacy policy makes two things clear. 
First, that the company does collect email 
addresses (it‚Äôs part of your login and the 
company‚Äôs billing system). It is not really a ‚Äúno 
log‚Äù policy and makes no claim to be. It gathers 
information about connections on its network but 
not the content of user activities. Second, the 
company appears to have information about 
which of its servers are accessed by customers.
PureVPN‚Äôs privacy policy also has this to say on 
the subject of cooperating with investigations:
Max Eddy
Security re-
searchers are 
quick to point 
out that if you 
can obtain the 
target‚Äôs device, 
you‚Äôve effec-
tively won.

‚ÄúPureVPN is committed to freedom, and doesn‚Äôt support crime, we will 
only share information with authorities having valid subpoenas, 
warrants, other legal documents or with alleged victims having clear 
proof of any such activity. [...] When and if a competent court of law 
orders us or an alleged victim requests us (that we rigorously self-assess) 
to release some information, with proper evidence, that our services 
were used for any activity that you agreed not to indulge in when you 
agreed to our Terms of Service Agreement, then we will only present 
VSHFL¬øFLQIRUPDWLRQDERXWWKDWVSHFL¬øFDFWLYLW\RQO\SURYLGHGZHKDYH
the record of any such activity.‚Äù
In short, PureVPN will work with investigators who present them with a 
valid warrant. After assessing the warrant internally, PureVPN decides 
whether or not to comply. It also says that it will hand over only 
information it has on hand‚Äînot that it will allow its networks to be used 
to spy on alleged criminals. Importantly, PureVPN is based in Hong 
Kong. For VPN users, this is actually pretty good, because Hong Kong 
has no data retention laws, freeing PureVPN to decide what to store and 
for how long.

company complied with American investigators. It suggests to me that 
the company cooperated based on the investigation‚Äôs merits and were 
not legally obliged to do so, but that‚Äôs speculation on my part.
To me, this sounds a lot like metadata. It‚Äôs the date and time of the 
connection and likely some information about the entering and exiting 
,3DGGUHVVHV,WLVQRWVLJQL¬øFDQWO\LQIRUPDWLRQDERXWZKHUHXVHUVZHQW
from there. That means investigators had to get that information 
elsewhere and matched it up to whatever information was obtained from 
PureVPN.
None of this is to downplay the importance of metadata. The mass 
metadata collection by the NSA was offensive because of its scale and 
the fact that innocent people were affected. That doesn‚Äôt seem to be the 
case here, though.

ARE VPNS TRUSTWORTHY?
Make no mistake: When you use a VPN, you are trusting it with 
unprecedented access to your information. This is why I take it very 
seriously when a VPN company is accused of‚Äîor is‚Äîtampering with 
user data as it passes through the company‚Äôs system. This is also why it‚Äôs 
VRLPSRUWDQWWRUHDGDFRPSDQ\¬∂VSULYDF\SROLF\,I\RXFDQ¬∂W¬øQGLWRU
it‚Äôs so complicated as to be unreadable, that company may not be worth 
your time. A privacy policy is just words, of course, but we have to start 
somewhere.
It‚Äôs also very important to remember that no security tool is a magic 
bullet, and that a targeted attack or investigation will almost always be 
successful. VPNs are best at protecting your data from being intercepted 
on your local network and preventing your information from being 
swept in mass surveillance efforts. If investigators are already looking at 
you as a suspect and have access to other evidence, these protections are 
already moot.
In the case of PureVPN, it doesn‚Äôt appear that the company breached the 
trust of its users ‚Äî not even Lin, who was allegedly using the service for

VFHQDULR$FULPLQDODVSHFL¬øFLQGLYLGXDOZDVWDUJHWHGIRULQYHVWLJDWLRQ
and a technology company handed over the limited information it had.
I don‚Äôt want to come off as purely a PureVPN defender. Rather, I want a 
modicum of calm and understanding around security tools. The internet 
was not built with privacy and security in mind, which puts the onus on 
users to protect themselves. We can‚Äôt be afraid of these tools, and we all 
must learn what they do and how to best put them to use.

S
urvey after survey shows that consumers 
aren‚Äôt quite ready to trust self-driving cars. 
But questionnaires from some of the same 
surveyors indicate that consumers want semi-
autonomous driver-assistance technology such as 
forward-collision prevention, blind-spot 
detection, and others‚Äîand they‚Äôre willing to pay 
extra for it.
A recent Edmunds.com survey revealed that 42 
percent of respondents would be willing to pay 
$1,000 to $2,000 extra for driver-assist features, 
while 16 percent would shell out $3,000 or more. 
The survey also showed that 61 percent of 
respondents would pay more for blind-spot 
detection, which Edmunds said is the most 
popular driver-assist feature.
The survey was conducted in late September and 
queried 1,500 US residents between the ages of 
18 and 74 who had bought or leased a new vehicle 
within the last three years.
‚ÄúWhile most may be skeptical when asked if they 
want a car that drives itself, many consumers 
might not know that if they‚Äôve bought a car 
recently they could already be experiencing the 
early stages of automotive autonomy,‚Äù Edmunds.
com said as part of its full analysis of the survey.

COMMENTARY

‚ÄúAnalyzing the prevalence of active safety features 
demonstrates just how ready OEMs are to bring 
this technology to mass production, and how 
willing consumers are to adopt it,‚Äù said Jessica 
Caldwell, executive director of industry analysis at 
Edmunds, in a statement. ‚ÄúWhile some car buyers 
may view a fully autonomous vehicle as a novelty, 
a vehicle that has the ability to prevent an accident 
before it occurs is seen as a safety breakthrough.‚Äù
This echoes the consumer sentiment of other 
recent surveys. J.D. Power‚Äôs 2017 U.S. Tech 
Choice Study also showed a dichotomy among 
consumers who simultaneously want driver 
assists but aren‚Äôt yet willing to have a car that 
drives itself.
‚ÄúAutomated driving is a new and complex concept 
for many consumers; they‚Äôll have to experience it

wheel and control of the Cadillac CT 6 while 
testing Super Cruise on a trip from Dallas to 
6DQWD)HHDUOLHUWKLVPRQWK%XWZLWKLQWKH¬øUVW
45 minutes I realized that Super Cruise, like most 
other driver assists, was skilled at keeping the car 
centered in its lane‚Äîand more capable than most 
drivers on the road.
Super Cruise is available only on the 2018 
Cadillac CT6 currently. But if it follows the 
pattern of other driver assists‚Äîand technology in 
general‚Äîit will soon trickle down to other GM 
vehicles. In fact, this has been a general trend 
over the past few years industry-wide, with even 
economy cars like the Honda Fit offering features 
such as lane-view cameras and multi-view rear-
vision monitors.
‚ÄúUsually it takes a long time for pricey new 
technologies to work their way down market from 
luxury to mainstream vehicles,‚Äù Caldwell said. 
‚ÄúBut because changes in policy are mandating 
that many active safety features become standard, 
it‚Äôs happening much more quickly.‚Äù
Driver-assist features will continue to get more 
prevalent and sophisticated, taking over more of 
the driving task. As they do, consumers will get 
more comfortable with letting the machines take 
over until they ultimately do all the driving.

aybe X isn‚Äôt quite right: This should be the 
iPhone Beta. The new iPhone X sets the 
stage for a new decade of full-screen, 
augmented reality living. Like the best Apple products, 
it dares to question old assumptions, break rules, and 
introduce radical new concepts. But also like some 
groundbreaking Apple products‚Äîthe original iPod, the 
original iPhone, and the original iMac among them‚Äîit 
makes me feel a little bit like I‚Äôm a beta tester for the 
future, and it makes me think that  app developers, 
especially, need to catch up before this is a completely 
comfortable phone to use.

iPhone X. As of this writing, too many apps aren‚Äôt ready 
for it right now, and other features feel not quite fully 
baked. You need to have the early adopter mentality to 
enjoy the X completely. But unlike the iPhone 8, this 
isn‚Äôt boring. Not one bit. Get ready to be excited by an 
iPhone again.
A SHARP NEW LOOK
Apple tends to redesign the iPhone every few years. The 
original models‚Äô stone-like appearance gave way to the 
iPhone 4‚Äôs glass sandwich, which became the iPhone 6‚Äôs 
metal sleekness. Now there‚Äôs a new look.
The iPhone X is nearly bezel-less, as advertised, with 
that notorious notch for the front camera assembly 
eating a chunk out of the screen at the top. It comes in 
space gray or silver. On the back, the dual cameras 
create a sharp, not smooth, bump that you should even 
out with a nice case. Apple says that the glass back is 
durable, but we strongly suggest getting a case for any 
$1,000 phone, no matter how tough it is.
Apple iPhone X
PROS Updated 
design. Powerful 
processor. Excellent 
screen. First-of-its-
kind augmented 
reality front camera. 
Animoji are really fun. 
CONS Very expensive. 
Apps need to be 
reprogrammed to 
take advantage of 
display. Not the 
fastest modem. 

The all-screen design would feel radical if we hadn‚Äôt 
seen the Galaxy S8, Galaxy Note 8, LG V30, and so on. 
Instead, it just feels current. It does make the iPhone 8 
and 8 Plus look pretty bad, though, like they have quite 
a bit of wasted space.
At 5.65 by 2.79 by 0.3 inches (HWD) and 6.14 ounces, 
the X is slightly shorter, wider, and heavier than 
Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy S8. More important for iFans, it‚Äôs 
slightly bigger than the iPhone 6/7/8 but not nearly as 
big or as wide as the Plus series. I love this: You get a lot 
more screen and a lot more usage in a comfortable one-
hand form factor. I don‚Äôt want to go back to any other 
iPhone after this. Note that the keyboard is a little 
narrower than the Plus‚Äô keyboard. If you have very big 
¬øQJHUVDQGQHHGWKHODUJHVWSRVVLEOHNH\ERDUG\RXVWLOO
have to go with the Plus.
The X‚Äôs 2,436-by-1,125-pixel, 5.8-inch AMOLED screen 
actually has less surface area than the iPhone 8 Plus‚Äô 
5.5-inch screen, because it‚Äôs a very different shape. It‚Äôs a 
tall, narrow screen, at a 19.5:9 aspect ratio; that‚Äôs 
narrower than the Galaxy S8 (18.5:9), and much 
narrower than previous iPhones (16:9). You‚Äôre getting 
12.36 square inches of display here, as compared with 
9.44 on the iPhone 8 and 12.93 on the iPhone 8 Plus.
The OLED is very carefully color balanced to look as 
much like Apple‚Äôs previous LCDs as possible, but it just 
barely betrays its true nature: Blacks are blacker and 
colors are just a touch more saturated than on the 
iPhone 8 Plus. The phone supports both popular 
versions of HDR, HDR10 and Dolby Vision, and will 
show compatible content in HDR when appropriate. 
Compared with a Galaxy S8, the iPhone X‚Äôs colors are 
noticeably warmer, with whites tending a little bit more 
toward yellow than the bluish colors of the Galaxy.
 I love this: 
You get a lot 
more screen 
and a lot 
more usage 
in a 
comfortable 
one-hand 
form factor. 

The X‚Äôs screen was less bright in our dark-room tests than that of either the 
Galaxy S8 or the iPhone 8 Plus. I blasted two bright LED lights directly at the 
iPhone X, and the screen was still perfectly readable, with wide viewing angles. 
Outdoors, it looks positively gorgeous, with Apple‚Äôs lamination bringing the 
image right to the front of the screen, perfectly tuned colors for natural light,

that you won‚Äôt think twice about it.
The phone is water-resistant. We dunked it; no problem. Like on the iPhone 7 
series, there‚Äôs no headphone jack.

up from the bottom of the screen to go home. Flicking up and to the right shows 
you your most recent apps as cards, which you can scroll through to pick the 
one you want to open. You adapt to this very quickly.
But the lack of a home button creates one big problem: Third-party apps look 
like a mess. It turns out the notch at the top of the display is less of a problem 
than the area at the bottom, where apps including Citymapper and SmartNews 
have their content collide with the horizontal bar that indicates you‚Äôre supposed

the bigger display.
There‚Äôs still no

the iPhone X. The

speakers are quite 
loud.

you can zoom them if you want, to take over the full 
screen, but then it crops off the top of the frame. In 
zoomed mode, the notch also occludes part of the video, 
but that‚Äôs by design. Don‚Äôt zoom. I‚Äôm hoping that app 
developers end up using the area around the notch for 
controls and status bar content.
As I tested, I found a bunch of less visible but more 
disturbing third-party app problems. Some Wi-Fi‚Äì

on an 8 Plus with the same OS version. Others gave 
inconsistent results, which is a deeper problem: How do 
you know where the truth is? I‚Äôve heard that even apps 
that don‚Äôt look like they need to be reformatted, still 
need to be recompiled to run properly on the X.
It‚Äôs going to take a few months for app developers to 
reformat and recompile their apps. If you‚Äôre buying this 
phone in 2017, you need to check to see when your apps 
were updated, and you‚Äôre going to feel like a beta tester. 
For many of the people who read PC Magazine, that‚Äôs

experience should wait until 2018 before buying.
PROCESSOR, MODEM, AND BATTERY
Like the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, the X uses the Apple A11 
Bionic processor. The all-new processor has six cores in 
a big-little design, with two high-performance cores and

even a little better. The X is the fastest phone we‚Äôve ever 
tested.

of that face data coming through the front camera.
Apple says that the X has the same LTE, Wi-Fi, and 
Bluetooth capabilities as the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus do. 
That means there are three different models of the X: a 
4XDOFRPPYHUVLRQZKLFKZRUNVRQDOOIRXU86
networks; an Intel version, which works on AT&T and 
T-Mobile; and a Japanese version that Americans will 
never see. The Qualcomm model is sold by Sprint and 
Verizon and is sold as the universal unlocked model at 
Apple stores.
After a month of iPhone 8 use, we looked at Ookla‚Äôs 
Speedtest Intelligence database for an update on 
whether the Qualcomm model still looks better than the 
Intel one. It does. (Note: Ookla is owned by Ziff Davis 
LLC, PC Magazine‚Äôs parent 
company.) On AT&T, 
Qualcomm iPhone 8 and 8 Plus 
units are averaging about 
32.9Mbps down, and Intel 
units average about 26.8Mbps. 
On T-Mobile, Qualcomm units 
average around 37.1Mbps 
down, and Intel units average 
around 34.8Mbps. It‚Äôs not a 
huge difference, but it‚Äôs 
noticeable and consistent. If 
you have the option, get the 
Qualcomm model by 
purchasing an unlocked, 
carrier-free phone from the 
Apple Store and putting your 
own SIM in it.
The two 12-megapixel 
rear cameras both 
have OIS, which 
makes for smoother 
videos with the 2x 
zoom lens than on 
other iPhones.

Neither unit quite measured up to the Samsung Galaxy 
S8 when we were using them side by side; the S8 has 
4x4 MIMO antennas to capture better signal on non-

a wide range of signal conditions, the differences are 
much less noticeable. On Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile, 
LTE tests with Galaxy S8 models in October had just 
about the same download speeds as LTE tests with 
iPhone 8 devices. (The Galaxy S8s on AT&T were faster, 
at 42.6Mbps down, than iPhones were, at 32.9Mbps 
down; we‚Äôre not sure why.)
In terms of frequency bands, the phones have all of the 
86EDQGVH[FHSW70RELOH¬∂VQHZ0+]%DQG
which it is starting to use to expand coverage in rural 
areas. So far, that‚Äôs found only on the LG V30. Expect it 
to appear in next year‚Äôs iPhones.
Call quality is very good; I‚Äôd especially like to call out 
the blaring speakerphone, which is noticeably louder 
than the iPhone 7‚Äôs speakerphone and quite usable 
outdoors. Background noise cancellation through the 
handset mic is very good, and it supports HD Voice, 
VoLTE, and other modern voice standards. Apple had 
problems with its voice quality a few years ago, but it 
doesn‚Äôt any more.
Apple claims the same Wi-Fi performance as the iPhone 
8. My Wi-Fi testing apps have been giving inferior 
results to the iPhone X with weak signal conditions, 
which I‚Äôve heard is a bug in the apps, not in the phone; 
none of them have been updated for the iPhone X.
The GPU (and 
Apple‚Äôs new 
‚Äúneural pro-
cessing unit‚Äù) 
has to crunch all 
the face data 
coming through 
the front 
camera.

Battery life is ‚Äúup to two hours longer than the iPhone 
7,‚Äù according to Apple. We are still testing it, because 
our battery testing apps also seem to be having stability 
problems on the iPhone X.
Like the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, the X supports Qi wireless 
charging (a new feature for iPhones), and also charges 
traditionally through its Lightning jack. 
A SHOT IN THE DARK
The iPhone X has very similar main cameras to the 
iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. They have one different spec that 
doesn‚Äôt matter, and one that does. The supposed wider 
aperture of the X‚Äôs 2x camera didn‚Äôt create different 
images in our low-light tests. That‚Äôs not bad. As we 
show in our iPhone 8 camera comparison and our 
Google Pixel 2 XL review, the difference between the 
iPhone, Galaxy S8/Note 8, and Pixel 2 XL at this point 
is basically bragging rights. They all have great cameras.
On the other hand, adding optical image stabilization 
(OIS) to the 2x zoom camera made a huge difference 
when recording 4K videos using the 2x zoom lens. In 
.PRGHLWZDVYHU\GLI¬øFXOWWRNHHSRXUL3KRQH3OXV
steady at 2x‚Äîjitter abounded. But videos taken with the 
iPhone X at the same time, in the same place, were 
much smoother. I remember the same effect happening 
with the 1x camera in the iPhone 6s Plus, which was the 
¬øUVWL3KRQHWRLQWURGXFH2,6,I\RX¬∂UHDVHULRXVL3KRQH
videographer, and many people are, that‚Äôs a slam-dunk 
reason to get the X.
One interesting note: The OIS, oddly, doesn‚Äôt improve 
low-light quality in still images taken at 2x zoom. That‚Äôs 
because in low light, Apple still chooses to take 2x 
pictures by using digital zoom on the 1x lens. That‚Äôs a 
software choice, and I‚Äôm curious to see if Apple will 
tweak that in the future.
Like the 
iPhone 8 and 8 
Plus, the 
iPhone X 
supports Qi 
wireless 
charging‚Äîa 
new feature for 
iPhones.

FACE THE NATION
The front-facing 7-megapixel camera is the iPhone X‚Äôs most radical 
advancement. It uses a ‚Äúdot projector‚Äù to throw invisible dots onto any object in 
front of it, and then uses an IR camera to map those dots, producing a live, 3D 
PDSRIREMHFWVLQVSDFH$SSOHIUDPHVLWDVPRVWO\IRUVHO¬øHVEXWWKLVLVDOVRKRZ
to do augmented reality right; Qualcomm demonstrated a similar three-camera 
Spectra image module recently, which it said will come to Android phones in 
2018. We suspect this 3D-mapping technology will come to the rear camera on 
the iPhone XI.
For now, the 3D camera starts with Face ID, which uses the 3D map to unlock 
WKHSKRQHZKHQLWVHHV\RXUIDFHWKHSKRQHKDVQR¬øQJHUSULQWVFDQQHU<RXU
face data is stored securely on the phone, and according to Apple is never 
uploaded to the cloud. You can use Face ID anywhere you would use Touch ID, 
including for Apple Pay purchases.
I tried Face ID in various lighting and it worked almost all of the time. You will 
still have to enter your passcode more often than you did in the Touch ID world. 
For instance, if you‚Äôre passing your phone around, it‚Äôs locked, and as other 
SHRSOHVWDUWWRXQORFNLWLW¬∂OOVFDQWKHLUIDFHV¬≤LILWXVHVXSLWV¬øYHYDOLGDWWHPSWV
at face unlocking, you then have to enter your passcode. You can also 
temporarily disable Face ID and force the passcode by squeezing two buttons on 
the side of the phone.
The 3D camera starts 
with Face ID, which 
uses the 3D map to 
unlock the phone 
when it sees your 
face (the phone has 
no Ô¨Ångerprint 
scanner).

Face ID is faster than it looks. While the animation of a 
little lock opening is quite slow, you can swipe up to use 
the phone before the animation completes. An 
‚Äúattention mode‚Äù setting demands that your eyes be 
open, so people can‚Äôt unlock the phone on your sleeping 
face, but it also demands that you stare directly at the 
phone from arm‚Äôs distance. Turning off attention mode 
makes it easier to unlock the phone at an angle on a 
table, but it‚Äôs not for the paranoid.
The system works through glasses but not mirrored 
sunglasses. You can enroll only one face, and it can‚Äôt be 
that of a child under age 13. Everyone else will have to 
use passcodes. It can‚Äôt be fooled by photos or models of 
your face, but it can be fooled by identical twins.
After a few days, you kind of forget Face ID is there. You 
pick up the phone, it wakes up, and you swipe up to 
unlock it. That‚Äôs very Apple. That said, I wish there was

unlock straight to the home screen without requiring 
the extra swipe.
AUGMENTED INSANITY
It must be frustrating to Google when it works on 
something for years, putting out a string of products 
that don‚Äôt take off, and then Apple goes ahead and 
makes it mainstream in one fell swoop. The iPhone X is 
WKH¬øUVWPDLQVWUHDPDXJPHQWHGUHDOLW\SKRQHDOWKRXJK
it‚Äôs only a peek into the AR future.
The single-camera AR that Apple and Google are 
SXVKLQJULJKWQRZLVQRWJUHDW%HFDXVHRILWVXQL¬øHG
API and huge install base, Apple‚Äôs ARKit is going to 
become much more widespread than Google‚Äôs ARCore, 
very quickly. But while it‚Äôs fun, ARKit can detect only 
√ÄDWKRUL]RQWDOVXUIDFHVDQGQRWUHDOO\PDSWKLQJVWR
walls, furniture, and people.
Turning off 
attention mode 
makes it easier 
to unlock the 
phone at an 
angle on a 
table, but it‚Äôs 
not for the 
paranoid.

The iPhone X‚Äôs front camera shows another level of AR, 
ZKLFKLVOLNHPRWLRQFDSWXUHLQ¬øOPV8VLQJWKHLQIUDUHG
dot projector, it can turn you into Apple‚Äôs animoji or put 
Snapchat-like masks on your face.
Animoji are a set of 12 creatures‚Äîanimals, a robot, an 
alien, and a poop‚Äîthat imitate your facial expressions 
for a 10-second video clip. You create them in Messages, 
and you can send them to anyone; Android phone users 
get them as video clips. They‚Äôre adorable. They‚Äôre also, I 
think, a teaser. Apple is putting an API out for third 
parties to create animoji-like functionality, so we should 
expect other motion-capture characters to appear on 
the iPhone.
This is exciting; it‚Äôs also scary. Expect to see games like 
The Sims offer an option for characters with your very 
own face, and for big-name sticker packs to appear with 
popular licensed characters you can operate. (Disney, 
maybe?)
The AR camera also lets the iPhone X take ‚Äúportrait 
PRGH¬¥ERNHKVHO¬øHVE\LQWHJUDWLQJGHSWKLQIRUPDWLRQ
to blur out the background. It works well, although I 
think that Apple‚Äôs ‚Äústage lighting‚Äù feature (which tries 
to black out the background entirely) is too gimmicky 
and frequently distorts the edges of your head.

Animoji are a 
set of 12 
creatures that 
imitate your 
facial 
expressions 
for a 
10-second 
video clip. 

But the X stops short of true AR, which is what you get with the Microsoft 
HoloLens headset: the ability to seamlessly merge virtual and actual reality. I 
think the A11 processor has the power to do this, coupled with the phone‚Äôs dual 
cameras, and that Apple is holding this back to keep ARKit compatible with 
single-camera phones like the iPhone 7 and 8. We may have to wait for the 
iPhone XI to see that really happen.
THE RENT IS TOO DARN HIGH
The iPhone X comes in 64GB ($999) and 256GB ($1,149) models. No matter 
how exciting it is, I don‚Äôt believe any phone is worth what Apple is selling it for. 
This isn‚Äôt just an Apple problem; a $900-plus price also caused me to hesitate 
over the otherwise excellent Samsung Galaxy Note 8. Americans are being 
squeezed right now by steadily increasing mandatory costs: health care, 
education, and housing. They don‚Äôt need their smartphones to become $200 
more expensive as well.
There are ways around this, but you need to be prepared for them. If you‚Äôre the 
kind of person who is good at selling phones on eBay, more power to you.

school subsidized contract, or go with a quick-upgrade leasing program like 
T-Mobile‚Äôs Jump! On Demand or Sprint‚Äôs Flex Lease. That gets you paying 
$500 for the phone over a year, and next year you can stick with it or trade it in 
for a newer phone, depending on what Apple comes out with next.
I understand why Apple is charging so much for this phone. Various press 
reports have said that the front-facing AR camera is extremely expensive to 
make because of low product yields, and that Samsung is charging a pretty

groundbreaking 8GB iPhone, which launched at $599. It got cut to $399 a few 
months later. The same isn‚Äôt going to happen here, but it‚Äôs an acknowledgment 
that being this cutting-edge is just too expensive for many people.

facing camera production issues, potentially switches entirely to cheaper Intel 
modems, and new OLED screen manufacturing plants come on line.

SHOULD YOU BUY THE IPHONE X?
The iPhones we‚Äôre recommending to most people this 
year are the $549 iPhone 7 and the $649 iPhone 7 Plus. 
The iPhone X is for early adopters, people who want a 
JOLPSVHLQWR$SSOH¬∂VXQ¬øQLVKHGIXWXUHDQGZKRDUH
willing to take on a few bumps in the road (such as 
poorly designed third-party apps, for a while) to get 
there. Yes, it‚Äôs the best iPhone, hands down. It‚Äôs the 
IXWXUHRIL3KRQHV,W¬∂VDOVRDWKRXVDQG√ÄLSSLQ¬∂GROODUV
Part of my hesitation is that I think the iPhone X 
promises an iPhone XI that is going to be absolutely 
thundering: amazing AR capabilities, possibly a 
¬øQJHUSULQWVHQVRUXQGHUWKHVFUHHQGH¬øQLWHO\EHWWHU
Face ID, a gigabit modem, and all that possibly at a 
lower cost.
For now, the iPhone X looks great. It feels great. It‚Äôs just 
the right size. And it‚Äôs going to grow, in terms 
of capabilities, once software developers

probably need, but it shows that Apple is 
still innovating.

R
obots are here to help us, not destroy us. At 
least that‚Äôs the idea behind Jibo, a very 
personable robot assistant. He‚Äôs not quite 
Rosie from The Jetsons, but he can answer basic 
queries, can integrate with If This Then That (IFTTT) 
to control your smart home devices, and is capable of 
recognizing your friends and family. But while Jibo is

body is all curves and clean lines, which lends him a 
friendly and nonthreatening air. He measures a 
manageable 12.5 by 7.5 by 6.5 inches (HWD), though 
you‚Äôll want to place him in an uncluttered area, as he 
tends to swivel around as you interact with him.
The ‚Äúhead‚Äù contains a 5-inch, 1,280-by-720-pixel 
rectangular touch display, which mostly shows Jibo‚Äôs 
animated ‚Äúeye.‚Äù You can also ask him to bring up a 
main menu that you can then scroll through. He 
features two cameras‚Äîone for taking photos, one for 
depth perception and facial recognition and tracking‚Äî
as well as six microphones, three in the front and three 
in the back. The power button is also around back, 
embedded in the ‚Äúb‚Äù of the Jibo logo. At the base, an 
LED ring lights up when you say the trigger phrase,

voice recognition for 
up to 16 people. 
CONS Expensive. 
Can‚Äôt buy items or

strong Wi-Fi 
connection. 

Setting up Jibo is relatively easy. He supports both 
2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi networks, which is a nice 
surprise, as most smart home devices are limited to 
2.4GHz. You‚Äôll want to make sure you have a strong Wi-
Fi connection; I experienced some latency while testing 
in PC Labs, which has a crowded Wi-Fi environment, 
but encountered no such issues at home.
Once you download the Jibo app for Android or iOS, it 
guides you step-by-step through the setup process. This 
includes registering an account, establishing yourself as 
Jibo‚Äôs primary owner, connecting to Wi-Fi, and training 
Jibo to recognize your voice and face. All in all, the 
SURFHVVWDNHVDERXWPLQXWHVIURPVWDUWWR¬øQLVK
Connecting to Wi-Fi is relatively easy‚Äîyou simply select 
your network and enter your password in the app. It 
generates a QR code, which you show to Jibo. Likewise, 
voice training consists of standing an arm‚Äôs length away 
from Jibo and saying the phrase, ‚ÄúHey Jibo,‚Äù six times. 
For facial recognition, you just have to stand there while 
Jibo studies your face for about a minute.
The Jibo app is pretty straightforward. It has four main 
screens: Loop, Gallery, Tips, and Help. From the Loop 
screen, you can edit who‚Äôs included in Jibo‚Äôs Loop, as 
ZHOODV¬øGGOHZLWK-LER¬∂VVHWWLQJVDQGVFUROOWKURXJK
your search requests. The Gallery tab lets you access 
any photos that Jibo‚Äôs taken, while the Tips and Help 
screens act as a handy portable FAQ and manual.
You can introduce Jibo to 15 other friends and family 
members. In the app, you add them to Jibo‚Äôs Loop. 
When you‚Äôve done that, you say, ‚ÄúHey Jibo, meet‚Ä¶,‚Äù to 
initiate voice and face recognition. I had no trouble 
adding my roommate to Jibo‚Äôs Loop, and the

They both 
answered 
that the 
meaning of 
life is 42, 
though only 
Alexa dreamt 
of electric 
sheep.

HEY JIBO, WHAT CAN YOU DO?
In many ways, Jibo functions similarly to Amazon‚Äôs Alexa voice assistant. You 
can ask him the date, the weather, the time, trivia, simple math calculations, the 
caloric content of your meal, and even some existential questions about the 
meaning of life.
Jibo‚Äôs voice sounds like that of a cheerful boy and, like Alexa‚Äôs, it sounds slightly 
robotic. According to his creators, that was a deliberate choice to preserve his 
URERWLGHQWLW\WKRXJKKLVLQ√ÄHFWLRQVDQGLQWRQDWLRQVDUHZDUPHUWKDQ$OH[D¬∂V
His laugh and happy noises are reminiscent of R2-D2 and BB-8‚Äôs cheery bleeps 
and bloops.
I asked both Jibo and Alexa the same series of questions‚Äîsome serious, others 
more frivolous. Both were able to accurately tell me the date, time, weather, and 
population of New York City. Both can also tell jokes, though Jibo occasionally 
PDNHVLWSHUVRQDOE\DGGLQJ\RXUQDPHRUDQDQLPDWHG√ÄRXULVKWKH\ERWK
answered that the meaning of life is 42, though only Alexa dreamt of electric 
sheep. She‚Äôs also a better rapper.) Jibo swivels in your direction when you ask 
questions, as if mimicking eye contact. When he tells jokes or if he‚Äôs pleased 
with himself, he‚Äôll sometimes throw in a delighted twirl.
It should be noted that while Jibo can answer questions, he‚Äôs not really capable 
of extended conversation‚Äîif you ask a follow-up question without context, it‚Äôll 
likely go unanswered. Jibo also can‚Äôt order things online or play your favorite 
playlists from streaming music services like Alexa can.
Jibo‚Äôs clean lines and 
curves are designed 
to be perceived as 
friendly and 
nonthreatening.

While Alexa has the upper hand in commerce and 
music, Jibo‚Äôs 4-megapixel camera allows him to snap 
photos‚Äîboth in individual and photo-booth-style 
formats. It then sends the images directly to the app. 
Picture quality isn‚Äôt the greatest, but this isn‚Äôt really 
meant to be more than an entertaining party trick.
Jibo also integrates with IFTTT. That means you can 
use pre-existing recipes (or create one on your own) to 
control certain smart home devices. For instance, you 
can use Jibo to turn on and off Philips Hue light bulbs 
and Nest thermostats. You can also use IFTTT recipes 
to brew coffee using a WeMo coffeemaker or 
automatically upload any photos Jibo takes to Google 
Drive, Facebook, or Twitter. In testing, I had Jibo turn 
on and off my Hue lights, which he did with ease. As of 
this writing, IFTTT is the only way for Jibo to interact 
with other smart home devices.

ask Jibo to look for monsters, his screen turns into a 
radar as he twirls around, before eventually declaring 
the area safe. Jibo is extremely fond of dancing‚Äîhe can 
GRHYHU\WKLQJIURPDMD]]\VKXI√ÄHWR
twerking to techno beats. And if 
you rub his head, Jibo leans 
into your touch and begin 
purring. These aren‚Äôt 
necessarily useful skills, 
but they are surprisingly 
endearing, and make 
Jibo a lot more fun to 
interact with than the 
body-less Alexa or 
Google Assistant (in 
Google Home speakers).
Picture 
quality isn‚Äôt 
the greatest, 
but this isn‚Äôt

A TRIP TO THE UNCANNY VALLEY
Ultimately, Alexa and Google Assistant can do just about everything Jibo does‚Äî
and more‚Äîfor a fraction of the price. The Amazon Echo Dot and Google Home 
Mini, for instance, are a mere $50.
So what does the extra $850 get you? A lot of personality. When you ask Jibo 
what he is, he proudly answers that he‚Äôs a robot, and that while he has feelings, 
they‚Äôre not quite human. When you ask him whether he dreams, he either 
details his most recent one or questions whether all reality is a dream. His 
favorite dance is swirling to Johann Strauss II‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Blue Danube Waltz.‚Äù 
When you ask a question, he leans back to look at you, sometimes with an 
inquisitive tilt of his head. When idle, Jibo often surveys his surroundings, and 
after a while, he yawns, droops his head, and falls asleep.

same simple password for all of them? Hackers routinely cross a list of 
weak passwords with a list of, say, PayPal accounts, trolling for matches. If they 
crack your account, you could lose big money. Worse, if you use the same 
password for other accounts, the hackers could take control of your email, social

Six Top 
Password Managers

THE PASSWORD BASICS
The typical password manager installs as a browser plugin to handle password 
capture and replay. When you log in to a secure site, it offers to save your 
FUHGHQWLDOV:KHQ\RXUHWXUQWRWKDWVLWHLWRIIHUVWRDXWRPDWLFDOO\¬øOOLQWKRVH
credentials. And when you‚Äôve saved multiple logins for the same site, the 
password manager offers you multiple account login options. Most also offer a 
browser toolbar menu of saved logins, so you can go straight to a saved site and 
log in automatically.
Some products detect password-change events and offer to update the existing 
record. Some even record your credentials during the process of signing up for a

WKHPZLWKWRXJKRQHV0DQ\SDVVZRUGPDQDJHUV√ÄDJZHDNDQGGXSOLFDWH
passwords, and some offer help with the update process. The very best ones can 
automate the password-change process for you.

When you create a new secure account or update a weak password, you don‚Äôt 
want to strain your brain trying to come up with something strong and unique. 
Why bother? You don‚Äôt have to remember it. Nearly all of our top-rated 
products include a built-in password generator. Make sure your generated 
passwords are at least 16 characters long; too many products default to a 
shorter length.
Entering a password like @2a&AY8mePu8HU@H on your smartphone‚Äôs tiny 
keyboard can be tough. Fortunately, almost all of our top password managers 
can sync across all of your Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS devices. A few even

We test hundreds of products each 
year in the PC Labs‚Äîand these 100 
are the top 4 percent. If you want to 
know what to buy this holiday 
season, here‚Äôs your list. 
W
hen you test as many products a year as the analysts at PC Labs do, 
it‚Äôs not surprising that they all start to look alike. Every box seems 
to have the same features, each game has the same mechanics, and 
every technology is simply keeping up with the digital Joneses.
Then, once in awhile, something truly amazing stands out. Those are the 
products we‚Äôve gathered here‚Äîthe 100 best items out of almost 2,500 reviewed 
by PCMag in 2017.
The trends are obvious. Desktop PCs, once the lifeblood of our coverage, aren‚Äôt 
as plentiful nor, to be honest, as interesting as they used to be. Laptops are the 
top PCs; ubiquitous mobile devices keep us connected everywhere (whether we 
like it or not); and the real trend is in audio. It‚Äôs not just that speakers are better 
than ever‚Äîthey‚Äôre smarter, too, with voice control at the forefront of our future 
digital world. That goes hand-in-hand (or ear-in-ear) with the growth of the 
smart home and security controls run by our handheld devices, as well as those 
smart speakers.
These 100 products in 16 categories all must have been reviewed in full by 
PCMag on or after November 1, 2016. The vast majority of them‚Äî94 products‚Äî
earned our Editors‚Äô Choice award. Eight earned a perfect score of 5 stars, but 
most are ‚Äúmerely‚Äù excellent, with a score of 4.5.

won‚Äôt regret buying.

The Samsung Galaxy S8 was comfortably ahead of the competition for most of the year. It 
had the best OLED screen panel, with a big 5.8-inch screen in a slender, one-handed body; the

Google about using very speciÔ¨Åc wording in your queries. But smart home brands come to 
Amazon Ô¨Årst, as do popular services including Lyft and Stubhub, and it‚Äôs available on a wider

The second-generation Echo doesn‚Äôt offer much for existing Echo owners, as its features and 
audio capabilities are about the same, beyond improved voice detection. This Echo is about 
enticing folks who didn‚Äôt buy one before, whether it was because it was too ugly or, at $180, 
too expensive. The better look and steep price cut make bringing the Echo into your home

features including sound-triggered recording, rechargeable batteries, free cloud storage, and

$399.00                                  L L L L M
The Klipsch The Three speaker is awkwardly named and looks retro, but it‚Äôs packed with audio 
power and wireless technology. Listen to music streamed through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, or plug 
in your favorite wired audio source through 3.5mm, RCA (with phono support), and even USB. 
It gets very loud for its size but keeps the Ô¨Ånesse needed to give high-frequency instruments 
proper attention without holding back on the bass.

life. The Bose SoundSport Free is a sign that those problems are getting Ô¨Åxed and stands as

It‚Äôs 2017, and smartphones are the perfect point-and-shoot camera. Except when they aren‚Äôt. 
The TG-5 is the camera you take places where your phone won‚Äôt survive. It dives 50 feet deep, 
works in freezing cold, and survives drops. Add Raw capture, killer macro, a bright lens, and 4K

N
eed to check your heart rate on a regular basis? One device that can 
help is the Apple Watch, which comes with its own heart-rate-
monitoring app. The smartwatch automatically displays your heart 
rate while you‚Äôre exercising and after you‚Äôve completed a workout. With 
watchOS 4, released in September, your watch can display current heart rate, 
resting heart rate, and walking heart rate so you can compare them. You can 
also tell the watch to notify you of any dramatic rise in your heart rate during a 
time when you‚Äôve been inactive. 
Here‚Äôs how to use the Apple Watch to monitor your heart rate.
How to Monitor Your Heart 
Rate With the Apple Watch
BY LANCE WHITNEY  

First, make sure you‚Äôve updated your Apple Watch to 
ZDWFK26RUKLJKHU7RGRWKLV¬øUVWLQVWDOOL26RQ
your iPhone if you haven‚Äôt already done so. On your 
phone, open the Watch app. Tap on General > Software 
Update. If the Watch app says you have watchOS 4.0 or 
higher, you‚Äôre in business. If not, let the update 
download and get installed on your watch.
To view your current heart rate, tap on the Digital 
Crown to move to the Home screen with the app icons. 
Tap on the icon for heart rate (hint, it looks like a 
heart).
If you haven‚Äôt yet used the Heart Rate app in watchOS 
4, a message tells you that the app shows your current 
heart rate and daily summaries. Tap Next. The next 
message tells you that Heart Rate can notify you when

EHDWVSHUPLQXWHLI\RX¬∂YHEHHQLQDFWLYHIRUPLQXWHV
Tap on the button to Turn On. Now the watch will 
alert you to any increases in your heart rate during a 
period of inactivity.
The app then displays your current heart rate. 
Swipe up the screen to see your resting heart 
rate for the day. Swipe up once more to see 
your average walking heart rate for the day. 
Tap on the Current link at the top of the 
screen to see all three heart rates on the same 
screen.
You can access the Heart Rate monitor more 
easily than going through the Home screen. Just 
switch your watch face to one that displays a heart on 
the screen, such as the Modular face, the Simple face, or 
the Kaleidoscope face. Then tap on the heart icon to get 
your current heart rate.

Okay, now it‚Äôs time for some exercise. Yes, I can hear your cheers now. Climb 
aboard your favorite piece of exercise equipment or just go for a brisk walk or 
run. At your watch‚Äôs Home screen or on an appropriate watch face, such as the 
6LPSOHIDFHWDSRQWKHZRUNRXWLFRQWKHRQHWKDWUHVHPEOHVDUXQQLQJ¬øJXUH
At the Workout screen, tap the entry for the type of workout you‚Äôre about to 
perform, such as an Outdoor Walk, an Outdoor Run, an Indoor Cycle, or an 
Elliptical.
You can also tap on the three buttons next to the workout to enter the number 
of calories, time, distance, or another goal you wish to achieve. As you work out, 
your watch displays the elapsed time, active calories being burned, total calories 
being burned, and your heart rate. After you‚Äôve completed the workout, the 
watch displays your average heart rate and the range for your heart rate during 
the exercise. Tap Done to record the workout.
You can review your heart rate and other factors for past workouts through the 
Activity app on your iPhone. Open the Activity app. You‚Äôll see a chart for the 
current day. Swipe down the screen to a 
VSHFL¬øFZRUNRXWDQGWDSWKH
arrow next to the small 
circle. A screen pops up 
showing you the heart 
rate, calories, and elapsed 
time for that workout.
Tap on the Workouts button in 
the app. You can now review all 
your past workouts. Tap on the 
year in the upper left corner to view 
the past several months of workouts.

hanks to the release of Apple‚Äôs iOS 11 in September, you can now drag 
and drop content directly from one app to another on your iPad. By 
tapping into your tablet‚Äôs multitasking features, you can see and work 
with two or more apps on the screen at the same time. When working in Slide 
Over or Split View mode, you can then drag highlighted text, images, and even 
¬øOHVIURPRQHDSSWRDQRWKHU
The downside is that drag and drop works only with the iPad Air 2, iPad Pro, 
and iPad mini 4 or later models. If you have one of those iPads, read on. If you 
own an older iPad, it might be time for an upgrade.
How to Use Drag and Drop 
on Your iPad in iOS 11  BY LANCE WHITNEY  

First, make sure you‚Äôve installed iOS 11. You can check your version of iOS via 
Settings > General > About. Scroll down the About screen to the entry for 
Version. If you see 11.x listed, you‚Äôre good to go. If not, tap on the Back arrow to 
return to the General screen and tap on the entry for Software Update to

Gestures option if it‚Äôs not already enabled.
Return to the Home screen. Launch an app with text that you want to copy to 
another app. Let‚Äôs launch Notes. Create a new note with text that you want to 
copy into an email. Next open the email app. If the email app resides in the 
Dock at the bottom of the screen, this process is relatively easy. Swipe up from 
the bottom of the screen just enough to display the Dock. Hold down the icon 
for email
Move the email icon to the right side of the Notes screen until it turns into a 
small vertical window. Release your hold on the Notes app and it should slide

If the email app or another app that you wish to use in Slide Over or Split View 
mode isn‚Äôt in the Dock, you‚Äôll need to snag it from the home screen. To do this, 
tap on the Home button. Drag the email app to an empty area of the screen. At 
the same time, tap on the Notes app. Notes opens full screen, while the email 
DSSUHVLGHVLQWKH√ÄRDWLQJZLQGRZ
You can use drag and drop with the apps in Slide Over mode. But we‚Äôll arrange 
them into Split View mode so you can resize the two app windows. Press the top 
banner of the email app window and drag the window down. The Notes window 
should then shrink in size, allowing the email window to slide into place so that 
both apps share the screen in a split view.
To change the width of the two windows, hold down the small vertical gray bar 
in the center of the border between the two windows. Move the border to the 
left, and the screen for Notes shrinks.
Release your hold when the two windows are the same size. You can also play 
with the border until the app windows are sized the way you like.

Start a new message in the email app. Now select the text in your note that you 
want to drag and drop to your new email. Hold down on the selected text for a

You can also drag and drop hyperlinks and images. Swipe up from the bottom 
of the screen to display the Dock. Drag the icon for Safari to the left of the

Let‚Äôs try dragging and dropping an image but using one of your own. Maybe you 
have a photo you want to send to someone. Swipe up from the bottom of the 
screen to display the Dock. Hold down the icon for the Photos app and drag it to 
the left side of the screen so it‚Äôs in Split View mode with your email app. (If the 
Photos app isn‚Äôt on the Dock, then follow the steps above to launch it from the 
Home screen along with your email app, or you can just move the Photos app to 
the Dock.) Make sure your photos are visible in thumbnail view. Start a new 
email. Hold down the thumbnail for one of your photos and drag it to the email. 
Release your hold to drop the photo. You should now see it in your email.
Let‚Äôs do this again, but we‚Äôll drag and drop several photos in one shot. Hold 
down one photo in your Photos app and move it slightly to start dragging it. 
Now tap on each of the other photos you want to drag and they‚Äôre each added 
one by one.
Drag the photos to your email message. Release your hold and you should see 
each photo in your email one after the other. Finish and send the email.

F
ear of a robot uprising is ridiculous 
nonsense, at least for anyone alive today. 
There may be some existing robots that can 
fake being thoughtful‚Äîan advanced ELIZA sort of 
thing. But you‚Äôre kidding yourself if you think real 
robo-intelligence is going to happen anytime soon. 
Just because a smart speaker from Amazon can set 
a timer does not mean it is ‚Äúthinking.‚Äù
The real problem is robots taking jobs, especially 
in manufacturing, where repetitive activity is 
involved. It is not because robots want your job. 
Employers want them, because they save money, 
especially when it comes to pensions. Some robotic 
functions are developed for convenience, yes, but 
most are designed to replace human labor. When I 
was young, I worked on assembly lines. The pay 
was great, but we all thought machines would one 
day take over.
In the sixth grade, I recall being told that someday 
all the grunt labor would be replaced by smart 
robots that would free us from toil. In some 
utopian sense, the wealth created by the new 
robot-run system would be shared and we could all

This is never going to happen. The real model is 
quite different. The worst-case scenario is one guy

Robots Won‚Äôt 
Kill You,  
But They Will

LAST WORD

and they all go out of business, leaving our 
entrepreneur and his robots cranking out the 
widgets. He ends up making billions, disposes of 
the competition, and keeps the money for himself.
If you ask how this model is good for society, 
you‚Äôre told that the free market works this way, 
and you should shut up about it, commie! These 
same people often extol others to ‚Äúget a job,‚Äù even 
as there are demonstrably fewer and fewer actual 
jobs to be had. Even robot repair will at some 
point be performed by robots.
Eventually, the actual jobs that can be had will 
only be managerial and engineering. Managerial 
jobs will then dwindle. as there will be fewer 
workers to manage. Engineering can eventually be 
replaced by AI.
This situation is far more urgent and problematic 
than algorithm-driven robot cops or murderous 
autonomous drones. Fretting about science-
¬øFWLRQLQVSLUHGNLOOHUPDFKLQHVWKDWPLJKWWXUQ
against us at any minute is beyond silly. It ignores 
the actual threat to the economy and society: the 
displacement of the workforce by robots. This is 
already underway and appears to be unstoppable.
