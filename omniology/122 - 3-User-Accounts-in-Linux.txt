Creating User Accounts in Linux: 
 
When we run ‘useradd‘ command in Linux terminal, it performs following major things: 
 
It edits /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group and /etc/gshadow files for the newly created User account. 
Creates and populate a home directory for the new user. 
Sets permissions and ownerships to home directory. 
 
 
 
Basic syntax of command is: 
 
useradd [options] username 
 
In this article we will show you the most used 15 useradd commands with their practical examples in 
Linux. We have divided the section into two parts from Basic to Advance usage of command. 
 
    Part I: Basic usage with 10 examples 
    Part II: Advance usage with 5 examples 
 
Part I – 10 Basic Usage of useradd Commands 
 
1. How to Add a New User in Linux 
 
To add/create a new user, all you’ve to follow the command ‘useradd‘ or ‘adduser‘ with ‘username’. The 
‘username’ is a user login name, that is used by user to login into the system. 
 
Only one user can be added and that username must be unique (different from other username already 
exists on the system). 
 
For example, to add a new user called ‘solider‘, use the following command. 
 
[root@localhost ~]# useradd solider 
 
When we add a new user in Linux with ‘useradd‘ command it gets created in locked state and to unlock 
that user account, we need to set a password for that account with ‘passwd‘ command. 
 
[root@localhost ~]# passwd solider 
Changing password for user solider. 
New LINUX password: 
Retype new LINUX password: 
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully. 
 

Once a new user created, it’s entry automatically added to the ‘/etc/passwd‘ file. The file is used to store 
users information and the entry should be. 
 
solider:x:504:504:solider:/home/solider:/bin/bash 
 
The above entry contains a set of seven colon-separated fields, each field has it’s own meaning. Let’s see 
what are these fields: 
 
Username: User login name used to login into system. It should be between 1 to 32 charcters long. 
Password: User password (or x character) stored in /etc/shadow file in encrypted format. 
User ID (UID): Every user must have a User ID (UID) User Identification Number. By default UID 0 is 
reserved for root user and UID’s ranging from 1-99 are reserved for other predefined accounts. Further 
UID’s ranging from 100-999 are reserved for system accounts and groups. 
Group ID (GID): The primary Group ID (GID) Group Identification Number stored in /etc/group file. 
User Info: This field is optional and allow you to define extra information about the user. For example, 
user full name. This field is filled by ‘finger’ command. 
Home Directory: The absolute location of user’s home directory. 
Shell: The absolute location of a user’s shell i.e. /bin/bash. 
 
 
2. Create a User with Different Home Directory 
 
By default ‘useradd‘ command creates a user’s home directory under /home directory with username. 
Thus, for example, we’ve seen above the default home directory for the user ‘solider‘ is ‘/home/solider‘. 
 
However, this action can be changed by using ‘-d‘ option along with the location of new home directory 
(i.e. /home/newusers). For example, the following command will create a user ‘solider‘ with a home 
directory ‘/home/newusers‘. 
 
[root@localhost ~]# useradd -d /home/newusers solider 
 
You can see the user home directory and other user related information like user id, group id, shell and 
comments. 
 
[root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/passwd | grep solider 
solider:x:505:505::/home/newusers:/bin/bash 
 
 
3. Create a User with Specific User ID 
 
In Linux, every user has its own UID (Unique Identification Number). By default, whenever we create a 
new user accounts in Linux, it assigns userid 500, 501, 502 and so on… 
 

But, we can create user’s with custom userid with ‘-u‘ option. For example, the following command will 
create a user ‘navin‘ with custom userid ‘999‘. 
 
[root@localhost ~]# useradd -u 999 navin 
 
Now, let’s verify that the user created with a defined userid (999) using following command. 
 
[root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/passwd | grep solider 
navin:x:999:999::/home/solider:/bin/bash 
 
NOTE: Make sure the value of a user ID must be unique from any other already created users on the 
system. 
4. Create a User with Specific Group ID 
 
Similarly, every user has its own GID (Group Identification Number). We can create users with specific 
group ID’s as well with -g option. 
 
Here in this example, we will add a user ‘tarunika‘ with a specific UID and GID simultaneously with the 
help of ‘-u‘ and ‘-g‘ options. 
 
[root@localhost ~]# useradd -u 1000 -g 500 tarunika 
 
Now, see the assigned user id and group id in ‘/etc/passwd‘ file. 
 
[root@localhost ~]# cat /etc/passwd | grep tarunika 
tarunika:x:1000:500::/home/tarunika:/bin/bash 
 
5. Add a User to Multiple Groups 
 
The ‘-G‘ option is used to add a user to additional groups. Each group name is separated by a comma, 
with no intervening spaces. 
 
Here in this example, we are adding a user ‘solider‘ into multiple groups like admins, webadmin and 
developer. 
 
[root@localhost ~]# useradd -G admins,webadmin,developers solider 
 
Next, verify that the multiple groups assigned to the user with id command. 
 
[root@localhost ~]# id solider 
uid=1001(solider) gid=1001(solider) 
groups=1001(solider),500(admins),501(webadmin),502(developers) 
context=root:system_r:unconfined_t:SystemLow-SystemHigh 
 

6. Add a User without Home Directory 
 
In some situations, where we don’t want to assign a home directories for a user’s, due to some security 
reasons. In such situation, when a user logs into a system that has just restarted, its home directory will 
be root. When such user uses su command, its login directory will be the previous user home directory. 
 
To create user’s without their home directories, ‘-M‘ is used. For example, the following command will 
create a user ‘shilpi‘ without a home directory. 
 
[root@localhost ~]# useradd -M shilpi 
 
Now, let’s verify that the user is created without home directory, using ls command. 
 
[root@localhost ~]# ls -l /home/shilpi 
ls: cannot access /home/shilpi: No such file or directory 
 
7. Create a User with Account Expiry Date 
 
By default, when we add user’s with ‘useradd‘ command user account never get expires i.e their expiry 
date is set to 0 (means never expired). 
 
However, we can set the expiry date using ‘-e‘ option, that sets date in YYYY-MM-DD format. This is 
helpful for creating temporary accounts for a specific period of time. 
 
Here in this example, we create a user ‘aparna‘ with account expiry date i.e. 27th April 2014 in YYYY-
MM-DD format. 
 
[root@localhost ~]# useradd -e 2014-03-27 aparna 
 
Next, verify the age of account and password with ‘chage‘ command for user ‘aparna‘ after setting 
account expiry date. 
 
[root@localhost ~]# chage -l aparna 
Last password change  
 
 
 
 
: Mar 28, 2014 
Password expires 
 
 
 
 
 
: never 
Password inactive 
 
 
 
 
 
: never 
Account expires  
 
 
 
 
 
: Mar 27, 2014 
Minimum number of days between password change 
 
        : 0 
Maximum number of days between password change 
 
        : 99999 
Number of days of warning before password expires 
 
: 7 
 
8. Create a User with Password Expiry Date 
 

The ‘-f‘ argument is used to define the number of days after a password expires. A value of 0 inactive the 
user account as soon as the password has expired. By default, the password expiry value set to -1 means 
never expire. 
 
Here in this example, we will set a account password expiry date i.e. 45 days on a user ‘solider’ using ‘-e‘ 
and ‘-f‘ options. 
 
[root@localhost ~]# useradd -e 2014-04-27 -f 45 solider 
 
9. Add a User with Custom Comments 
 
The ‘-c‘ option allows you to add custom comments, such as user’s full name, phone number, etc to 
/etc/passwd file. The comment can be added as a single line without any spaces. 
 
For example, the following command will add a user ‘mansi‘ and would insert that user’s full name, 
Manis Khurana, into the comment field. 
 
[root@localhost ~]# useradd -c "Manis Khurana" mansi 
 
You can see your comments in ‘/etc/passwd‘ file in comments section. 
 
[root@localhost ~]# tail -1 /etc/passwd 
mansi:x:1006:1008:Manis Khurana:/home/mansi:/bin/sh 
 
10. Change User Login Shell: 
 
Sometimes, we add users which has nothing to do with login shell or sometimes we require to assign 
different shells to our users. We can assign different login shells to a each user with ‘-s‘ option. 
 
Here in this example, will add a user ‘solider‘ without login shell i.e. ‘/sbin/nologin‘ shell. 
 
[root@localhost ~]# useradd -s /sbin/nologin solider 
 
You can check assigned shell to the user in ‘/etc/passwd‘ file. 
 
[root@localhost ~]# tail -1 /etc/passwd 
solider:x:1002:1002::/home/solider:/sbin/nologin 
 
Part II – 5 Advance Usage of useradd Commands 
11. Add a User with Specific Home Directory, Default Shell and Custom Comment 
 
The following command will create a user ‘ravi‘ with home directory ‘/var/www/solider‘, default shell 
/bin/bash and adds extra information about user. 
 

[root@localhost ~]# useradd -m -d /var/www/ravi -s /bin/bash -c "Solider Owner" -U ravi 
 
In the above command ‘-m -d‘ option creates a user with specified home directory and the ‘-s‘ option set 
the user’s default shell i.e. /bin/bash. The ‘-c‘ option adds the extra information about user and ‘-U‘ 
argument create/adds a group with the same name as the user. 
12. Add a User with Home Directory, Custom Shell, Custom Comment and UID/GID 
 
The command is very similar to above, but here we defining shell as ‘/bin/zsh‘ and custom UID and GID 
to a user ‘tarunika‘. Where ‘-u‘ defines new user’s UID (i.e. 1000) and whereas ‘-g‘ defines GID (i.e. 1000). 
 
[root@localhost ~]# useradd -m -d /var/www/tarunika -s /bin/zsh -c "Solider Technical Writer" -u 1000 -g 
1000 tarunika 
 
13. Add a User with Home Directory, No Shell, Custom Comment and User ID 
 
The following command is very much similar to above two commands, the only difference is here, that 
we disabling login shell to a user called ‘avishek‘ with custom User ID (i.e. 1019). 
 
Here ‘-s‘ option adds the default shell /bin/bash, but in this case we set login to ‘/usr/sbin/nologin‘. That 
means user ‘avishek‘ will not able to login into the system. 
 
[root@localhost ~]# useradd -m -d /var/www/avishek -s /usr/sbin/nologin -c "Solider Sr. Technical Writer" 
-u 1019 avishek 
 
14. Add a User with Home Directory, Shell, Custom Skell/Comment and User ID 
 
The only change in this command is, we used ‘-k‘ option to set custom skeleton directory i.e. 
/etc/custom.skell, not the default one /etc/skel. We also used ‘-s‘ option to define different shell i.e. 
/bin/tcsh to user ‘navin‘. 
 
[root@localhost ~]# useradd -m -d /var/www/navin -k /etc/custom.skell -s /bin/tcsh -c "No Active Member 
of Solider" -u 1027 navin 
 
15. Add a User without Home Directory, No Shell, No Group and Custom Comment 
 
This following command is very different than the other commands explained above. Here we used ‘-M‘ 
option to create user without user’s home directory and ‘-N‘ argument is used that tells the system to 
only create username (without group). The ‘-r‘ arguments is for creating a system user. 
 
[root@localhost ~]# useradd -M -N -r -s /bin/false -c "Disabled Solider Member" clayton 
 
For more information and options about useradd, run ‘useradd‘ command on the terminal to see 
available options.

    Hi Ravi. Your suggestion to go directly to the source documentation to understand the requirements 
and details is an exceedingly excellent one. You have obviously done so, and translated the English it is 
written in, into whatever your native language is. A link to your interpretation, in your native language 
would be more helpful than the confusing broken English found here.

    Hi Ravi, 
 
    I have one problem, from client side I have a request to add a new user with username having space, I 
mean username of two words. 
 
    For example, 
 
    # adduser "ravi gen" 
    adduser: invalid user name 'ravi gen'

        @Anuj, 
 
        That’s not possible, add underscore or dash, like ravi_gen or ravi-gen.
