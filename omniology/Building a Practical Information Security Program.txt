CHAPTER 0
As, a concept, information security becomes ever more a part of our societies. 
This is, in a large part, a result of our nearly ubiquitous adoption of comput-
ing technology. Many of us depend on computers in our everyday lives. We sit 
in front of computers for our employers, we play on them at home, we go to 
school online, and we buy goods from merchants on the Internet. Our laptops 
go with us to the coffee shop so we can check our e-mail and do homework. 
We carry our smartphones at all times so we can check our bank balances on 
the go. We read and watch movies on our iPads. The sensors on our wrists track 
the calories we burn and hours we sleep.
These technologies enable us to be more productive and access a host of infor-
mation with only a click of the mouse, but they also bring with them a large 
set of security issues. If the information on the systems used by our employers 
or our banks becomes exposed to an attacker, the consequences can be dire 
indeed. Our business may suddenly find itself bereft of funds, as the contents 
of its accounts are transferred to a bank in another country in the middle of the 
night. Our employer could lose millions of dollars, face legal prosecution, and 
suffer damage to its reputation because of a system configuration issue allow-
ing an attacker to gain access to a database containing personally identifiable 
information or proprietary information. Such issues appear in the media with 
disturbing regularity.
If we look back 30 years, such issues related to computer systems were nearly 
nonexistent, largely due to the low level of technology and the few people

who were using what was in place to run our business or finances. Although 
technology changes at an increasingly rapid rate, and specific implementations 
arise on a seemingly daily basis, much of the theory that discusses how we 
go about keeping ourselves secure changes at a much slower pace because it 
involves the underlying protocols and infrastructure and does not always keep 
up with the changes to our technology. If we can gain a good understanding of 
the basics of information security and how to apply them, we are on a strong 
footing to cope with changes as they come along.
WHAT DO WE MEAN WHEN WE SAY INFORMATION 
SECURITY?
Information security is defined as “protecting information and information 
systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or 
destruction,” according to US law [1]. In essence, it means we want to protect 
our data and the systems that hold it from those who would seek to misuse it.
In a general sense, security means protecting our assets. This may mean pro-
tecting them from attackers invading our networks, natural disasters, adverse 
environmental conditions, power failures, theft or vandalism, or other unde-
sirable states. Ultimately, we will attempt to secure ourselves against the most 
likely forms of attack, to the best extent we reasonably can, given our environ-
ment and tolerance for risk.
When we look at what exactly it is that we secure, we may have a broad range of 
potential assets. We can consider physical items that we might want to secure, 
such as those of inherent value (e.g., gold bullion) or those that have value to 
our business (e.g., computing hardware). We may also have items of a more 
ethereal nature, such as software, source code, or data. In today’s computing 
environment, we are likely to find that our logical assets are at least as valuable 
as, if not more than, our physical assets. In addition, we must also protect the 
people who are involved in our operations. People are our single most valu-
able asset, as we cannot generally conduct business without them. We dupli-
cate our physical and logical assets and keep backup copies of them elsewhere 
against catastrophe occurring, but without the skilled people to operate and 
maintain our environments, we will swiftly fail.
In our efforts to secure our assets, we must also consider the consequences of 
the security we choose to implement. Although we could certainly say that a 
system in such a state could be considered reasonably secure, it is surely not 
usable or productive. As we increase the level of security, we usually decrease 
the level of productivity. With the system mentioned in our quote, the level of 
security would be very high, but the level of productivity would be very near 
zero; it is key to find the right balance.

3
What Do We Mean When We Say Information Security?
In addition, when securing an asset, system, or environment, we must also 
consider how the level of security relates to the value of the item being secured. 
We can, if we are willing to accommodate the decrease in performance, apply 
very high levels of security to every asset for which we are responsible. We can 
build a billion-dollar facility surrounded by razor wire fences and patrolled 
by armed guards and vicious attack dogs, and carefully place our asset in a 
hermetically sealed vault inside…so that mom’s chocolate chip cookie recipe 
will never come to harm, but that would not make much sense. In some envi-
ronments, however, such security measures might not be enough. In any envi-
ronment where we plan to put heightened levels of security in place, we also 
need to take into account the cost of replacing our assets if we do happen to 
lose them, and make sure we establish reasonable levels of protection for their 
value. The cost of the security we put in place should never outstrip the value 
of what it is protecting.
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Triad
Three of the primary concepts in information security are confidentiality, integ-
rity, and availability, commonly known as the confidentiality, integrity, and 
availability (CIA) triad, as shown in Fig. 0.1. The CIA triad gives us a model by 
which we can think about and discuss security concepts, and tends to be very 
focused on security, as it pertains to data.
Integrity
Availability

CHAPTER 0: 
Why We Need Security Programs
Confidentiality
Confidentiality is a concept similar to, but not the same as, privacy. 
Confidentiality is a necessary component of privacy and refers to our ability to 
protect our data from those who are not authorized to view it. Confidentiality 
is a concept that may be implemented at many levels of a process.
As an example, if we consider the case of a person withdrawing money from 
an automated teller machine (ATM), the person in question will likely seek to 
maintain the confidentiality of the personal identification number (PIN) that 
allows him, in combination with his ATM card, to draw funds from the ATM. 
In addition, the owner of the ATM will hopefully maintain the confidentiality 
of the account number, balance, and any other information needed to com-
municate to the bank from which the funds are being drawn. The bank will 
maintain the confidentiality of the transaction with the ATM and the balance 
change in the account after the funds have been withdrawn. If at any point in 
the transaction confidentiality is compromised, the results could be bad for the 
individual, the owner of the ATM, and the bank, potentially resulting in what 
is known in the information security field as a breach.
Confidentiality can be compromised by the loss of a laptop containing data, a 
person looking over our shoulder while we type a password, an e-mail attach-
ment being sent to the wrong person, an attacker penetrating our systems, or 
similar issues.
Integrity
Integrity refers to the ability to prevent our data from being changed in an 
unauthorized or undesirable manner. This could mean the unauthorized 
change or deletion of our data or portions of our data, or it could mean an 
authorized, but undesirable, change or deletion of our data. To maintain integ-
rity, we not only need to have the means to prevent unauthorized changes to 
our data but also need the ability to reverse authorized changes that need to 
be undone.
We can see a good example of mechanisms that allow us to control integrity 
in the file systems of many modern operating systems such as Windows and 
Linux. For purposes of preventing unauthorized changes, such systems often 
implement permissions that restrict what actions an unauthorized user can 
perform on a given file. In addition, some such systems, and many applica-
tions, such as databases, can allow us to undo or roll back changes that are 
undesirable.
Integrity is particularly important when we are discussing the data that provide 
the foundation for other decisions. If an attacker were to alter the data that 
contained the results of medical tests, we might see the wrong treatment pre-
scribed, potentially resulting in the death of the patient.

5
What Do We Mean When We Say Information Security?
Integrity can be compromised on purpose or by accident by modifying the 
data on which our business depends. The data entry clerk who misplaces a dec-
imal point when changing the price of a product can do just as much damage 
as an attacker that hacks in to modify the same data. Some may also argue that 
accidental modification of data extends into a question of validity.
Availability
The final leg of the CIA triad is availability. Availability refers to the ability to 
access our data when we need it. Loss of availability can refer to a wide variety 
of breaks anywhere in the chain that allows us access to our data. Such issues 
can result from power loss, operating system or application problems, network 
attacks, compromise of a system, denial of connectivity, or other problems. 
When such issues are caused by an outside party, such as an attacker, they are 
commonly referred to as a denial of service (DoS) attack and can be against 
end devices or the bandwidth to support them.
Relating the CIA Triad to Security
Given the elements of the CIA triad, we can begin to discuss security issues in a 
very specific fashion. As an example, we can look at a shipment of backup media 
on which we have the only existing, but unencrypted, copy of some of our sensi-
tive data stored. If we were to lose the shipment in transit, we will have a security 
issue. From a confidentiality standpoint, we are likely to have a problem since our 
files were not encrypted. From an integrity standpoint, presuming that we were 
able to recover the tapes, we again have an issue due to the lack of encryption 
used on our files. If we recover the tapes and the unencrypted files were altered, 
this would not be immediately apparent to us. As for availability, we have an issue 
unless the tapes are recovered since we do not have a backup copy of the files.
Availability can be compromised by any event that prevents us from important 
resources. A good example of this is ransomware—malware that encrypts data 
with a key known only to the attacker, with the express purpose in mind of 
extorting funds from the victim in exchange for revealing the encryption key so 
that the victim can reclaim their files.
Compliance and Risk
Another important concept to address is that of compliance versus risk. With 
the natural difficulty of determining what an appropriate level of security 
investment is some security programs are developed with the idea in mind of 
“checking the box” to satisfy the auditors that are assessing the organization’s 
degree of compliance with the various regulations and requirements under 
which they operate. Although this level of security may scrape through an audit 
and satisfy the paper requirement for security, it by no means constitutes an 
actual security program. In the case where a company that has been determined 

6
CHAPTER 0: 
Why We Need Security Programs
to be compliant with whatever standard(s) they are being held to is breached, 
the situation may descend into a maelstrom of accusals, counter accusals, and 
lawsuits, as each party attempts to be the one that is not to blame. Clearly, this 
is an undesirable situation.
As discussed later, two general approaches to building security programs are 
the above-mentioned compliance-based program and a risk-based approach. 
The risk-based approach, although almost definitely resulting in a stronger 
program (which as compliance as a subset), is also more resource intensive 
and may not apply well to all organizations, particularly those that are very 
small in size, or on very tight resource constraints.
Compliance Based
In recent years various compliance requirements have greatly changed the way 
that the information security industry, and the businesses and organizations 
which it supports, has begun to operate. If we look back a decade, the majority 
of information security efforts were centered on a few policies and a general 
mandate to keep attackers out. Yes, regulations did exist at that time to help 
protect data and consumers, but such efforts were considerably less defined 
than they are now and not as strictly enforced.
In the present state of the security industry, we have a number of issues that 
force us more in the direction of compliance. There are a seemingly ever 
increasing number of large breaches, the Target breach in December of 2013 
https://paperpile.com/c/cTAM8E/0PJ9 [1] being a very public example of such, 
which draw additional scrutiny to compliance issues (PCI in this case). There 
are also regular updates to the regulations with which we must comply and 
new regulations being enacted. This creates a moving target for companies that 
need to be concerned with compliance.
Given the set of regulations and industry requirements that we might be required 
to comply with while operating in any given industry, it can be easy for an orga-
nization to become trapped by these requirements when developing a program. 
If we allow our program to organically develop, tacking things on in a reaction-
ary way as we encounter compliance requirements, specific issues, audit findings, 
and other such drivers, we will likely end up with a very unbalanced program.
Compliance requirements are not meant to take the place of intentionally 
developing a sound foundation for information security. They exist to set min-
imum standards for, in most cases, protecting the customers that we serve.
Risk Based
Risk-based security programs represent the more planned and intentional 
methodology for constructing a security program. At a high level, a risk-based 
program is developed by identifying our important assets, identifying the 

7
What Do We Mean When We Say Information Security?
potential threats against them, assessing the vulnerabilities that we have pres-
ent, and then taking steps to mitigate these risks, as shown in Fig. 0.2.
In building a security program based on actual risks that pertain to our envi-
ronment, we build not just a generic security program, but a program that is 
suited to our particular needs.
First and foremost, we need to conduct a security assessment for our 
­organization. The rest of the program flows from this assessment. Using 
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP800-30 
https://paperpile.com/c/cTAM8E/QWeV [2] as a basis, the assessment should 
include the following items:
	
n	 System characterization
	
n	 Threat identification
	
n	 Vulnerability identification
	
n	 Control analysis
	
n	 Likelihood determination
	
n	 Impact analysis
	
n	 Risk determination
	
n	 Control recommendations
	
n	 Results documentation
With the risk assessment in hand, we can begin to lay out a roadmap that 
addresses the operational, tactical, and strategic goals of our organization. Given 
these goals, we can then forecast the required resources to accomplish these goals 
and use this as the basis for management discussions around the controls that 
we need to put in place, a security budget, and a number of other such details.

The NIST produces a number of Special Publications that provide government agencies with 
guidance on a variety of technical topics, including information security. NIST SP800-30 is 
the Guide for Conduct Risk Assessments. The list of Special Publications can be found at 
http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html and is a very useful source of guidance when 
developing the various parts of a security program.

CHAPTER 0: 
Why We Need Security Programs
It is important to note that using a risk-based approach to developing a secu-
rity program does not mean that we throw compliance by the wayside. It does, 
however, mean that we approach compliance as a factor in making decisions 
about our program, rather than as the driving force behind it. Although com-
pliance may not equal security, security done properly should encompass 
compliance.
SECURITY FOCUS AREAS
When we look at the security program, there are a number of levels at which we 
can focus, moving from the lowest and most in the weeds technical details at 
the tactical level, to very-high-level national security issues at the most strategic 
level. Each of these focus areas is necessary to getting the work of the security 
program done, and to ensuring that the work being done at that particular level 
is appropriate and effective. We have all experienced or heard of the manager 
at high or middle levels who is unable to leave the technical work efforts to 
those who are specifically employed to do said work, and insists on jogging the 
elbows of these poor souls. Likewise, asking our technical staff to make high-
level strategic decisions can have equally disastrous results.
Looking at the focus areas in question, from tactical to strategic, we have: tech-
nical, management, board level, industry, and national, as shown in Fig. 0.3.

Security Focus Areas
Technical
The technical level is at the most tactical end of the spectrum. The work that 
goes on here is where the rubber meets the security road. Here we have the 
architects, engineers, and analysts who are working to keep attackers out of our 
systems and are directly tuning the systems that keep our security infrastructure 
humming along properly. We may see the organization split into several teams 
at the technical level, to allow focus on specific efforts. We might commonly 
see divisions along the lines of engineering, operations, consulting, archi-
tecture, and penetration testing efforts. We may also see additional divisions 
along geographical boundaries. This will vary highly from one organization to 
another, depending on the specific needs and the size of the organization, and 
indeed the composition of such teams is very likely to change over time, even 
in a single organization.
They are architecting, implementing, and maintaining our critical security 
infrastructure like firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems, Data Loss Prevention 
tools, and the many other capabilities that need to take place to keep our secu-
rity infrastructure working. They are combatting malware that has infected our 
systems, responding to security incidents and investigating employee miscon-
duct involving our computer systems, conducting forensic collections from 
systems and performing analysis on them, and a myriad of other such efforts 
on a daily basis.
Some portion of the personnel at this level may also be shift based, in the case 
of Incident Response or Security Operations Center personnel, who we might 
require to respond around the clock as issues arise. Others can be on call or 
respond as required.
We would typically not expect our people with a technical focus to be setting 
the overall direction for the program or working at a higher level of strategic 
concern, although this may be a portion of the duties asked of the architecture 
role in some organizations.
Management
At a management level of focus, at a high level, we should see the direc-
tion set for the overall security program. The particular duties carried out 
at the management level of focus will vary considerably from one organi-
zation to the next and will also depend to a certain extent on the manage-
ment structure. We might typically see management reporting to middle  
management reporting to a chief information security officer (CISO) or, 
lacking a CISO, a chief information officer, who may then report to a chief 
executive/financial/operations officer, who will likely report to the board, 
as shown in Fig. 0.4.

10
CHAPTER 0: 
Why We Need Security Programs
We would typically expect the CISO, or whoever is filling this role under a dif-
ferent title, to set the direction for the organization’s overall security program. 
The CISO also has the ultimate responsibility for the success or failure of the 
program, and should set the vision and drive the culture of the organization. 
The CISO will also more than likely set the overall budget for the security orga-
nization and will sign off on very impactful security decisions. Because they are 
responsible they may find themselves in a precarious career position, should 
the program fail dramatically and publicly, in the case of a large breach that 
reaches the national news media.
Middle management in an information security is typically put in place to facil-
itate the smooth functioning of such organizations as they grow and mature. 
Past a certain point, it is not feasible for everyone in security to report directly 
to the CISO, and for this person to have a hand in every daily security decision.
Direct management of the technical teams, usually the first level or two of the 
structure, has a much more direct hand in how security functions for the orga-
nization. These managers are often setting specific budgets for purchases of 
security devices, making decisions for purchases directly, or requesting higher 
levels of management approval.

Security Focus Areas
Board Level
At the level of the board of directors for the organization, information secu-
rity concerns become largely indistinguishable from other business risks. 
If the business is not successful, then the security of the company and its 
information assets becomes somewhat of a moot point. For the business to 
succeed, we need to see to the overall security of the organization, protect cus-
tomer data that are entrusted to us, and take care to safeguard our reputation. 
The CISO must present the information risks in a way the board can compare 
and evaluate what level of risk is appropriate to accept and where they should 
invest.
At a board level, the security of the organization revolves around the high-
level successful completion of audits and similar external assessments, ensur-
ing that we do not make the front page of the morning news by having a 
large or very public breach or security incident, and providing direction to the 
layers of management below to ensure that these things happen. In the last 
several years, cases where the board of directors was held responsible for secu-
rity lapses in the security for the company that it oversees have become more 
common. Thus, ensuring that its members are not unwillingly fitted for orange 
jumpsuits is also a priority for the board. In addition, statements about cyber 
risk are becoming common in stockholder materials.
Protection of customer data is also an item of focus at the board level, as this 
refers directly to the above-mentioned breach issue. In a very large number of 
cases involving a breach of security or focused attack against a company, the 
target of the attack is customer information, often specifically stored customer 
payment card information. Even where this information is not directly present, 
customer personal information may still be the target, as this can be used to 
open fraudulent credit accounts in the name of the victim.
In addition, the board is focused on safeguarding the reputation of the com-
pany. All of the above-mentioned issues, when exposed to the public, represent 
damage to the reputation of the organization’s brand. Although the public 
appears to have somewhat of a short-term memory as relates to the missteps 
of companies that have experienced such issues, repeated problems in this area 
will eventually begin to stick in the minds of the public.
Industry
At an industry level, the focus on security shifts to a much more broad focus 
than any one organization. An excellent example of this is that of the Payment 
Card Industry (PCI) Security Standards Council, developers of the PCI Data 
Security Standard (PCI DSS), Payment Application Data Security Standard, 
and PIN Transaction Security requirements. These standards are often collec-
tively referred to as simply PCI.

12
CHAPTER 0: 
Why We Need Security Programs
This council was founded by the five major payment card brands: American 
Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard, and Visa Inc. 
and exists to help ensure a consistent level of security among the customers who 
use the collective groups products, namely, anyone who takes a payment card as 
payment for good or services. For businesses to accept payment card transactions, 
they have to agree to abide by the PCI DSS and, with varying levels of scrutiny based 
on number of transactions, submit to yearly audits of their security programs.
Via this mechanism, the PCI Security Standards Council influences industry 
level security for virtually anyone who uses payment cards as a portion of their 
business model. Similar comparisons can be made for other industry-focused 
security efforts, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act (HIPAA), the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), and 
a host of others. We will discuss efforts such as these at a greater length in 
Chapter 2. We may also categorize HIPPA and NERC as being at a national 
level of focus as they really fit into both groups.
National
We might think that a national security level of focus would be strictly related 
to cyberwarfare and firmly in the realm of the various governmental agencies 
that concern themselves with such efforts, but this is not entirely the case.
Although many of these matters are indeed above the level that an average orga-
nization would need to concern itself with, some are definitely still on our radar 
as security professionals. A large portion of the efforts of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) at this point are focused on cybercrime. Cybercriminals reg-
ularly attack businesses through theft of customer data and intellectual prop-
erty, DoS attacks, fraud, malware, and any of a number of similar efforts.
As discussed elsewhere in this chapter, meeting the bare minimum to ensure compliance with 
any of a number of standards, such as PCI DSS or HIPAA, does not equate to having a solid 
information security program. Although security can be seen as a superset of compliance, the 
reverse is not often true.

NOTE

13
Understanding the Threats We Face
The FBI, Federal Trade Commission, and US Secret Service are regularly 
involved in protecting US interests, including those of organizations that have 
attracted the attention of organized crime, black hat hackers, political activists, 
and other such parties.
Within our security organization, it often pays dividends to foster and develop 
relationships with the local representation of the agencies that are a part of 
combatting cybercrime on a national level. In several recent breach cases, the 
intrusions went undetected until they were reported by law enforcement agen-
cies that were monitoring fraudulent and criminal activities on the part of the 
perpetrators.
UNDERSTANDING THE THREATS WE FACE
It is important when constructing a security program to understand the poten-
tial issues that we might face. Factors such as the motivations and intent of 
attackers, whether the threats are from external or internal attackers, or even 
risks brought about from the regulatory environments within which our par-
ticular industry operates may affect how we structure the security program for 
our organization.
Motivations and Intent
Understanding the motivations and intent of those who attack us can be of 
great assistance in planning how we will respond to them. How we handle 
these attacks can vary greatly from one situation to another.
For example, if we are operating in the financial industry, the financial assets 
that we are handling will likely present a very large target for attackers. If we are 
handling account numbers, customer information, and payment card num-
bers, these items are valuable to attackers from the standpoint of being saleable 
information. Likewise, websites and applications that allow customers to per-
form financial transactions such as moving money from one account or bank 
to another, sending wire transfers, or withdrawing money from retirement 
accounts present tempting targets to fraudsters and thieves. The motivations 
and intent here both sync up to being theft of inherently valuable information 
and our program and sets of controls will likely be very focused around keep-
ing these particular assets safe.
In a different case, we might be developing a security program for a legal firm 
that handles civil rights cases for minorities and immigrants in troubled areas. 
Although we still have some similarities in that there is likely to be customer

protecting this is not present. In this case, we might need to worry about pro-
tecting customer information for matters of personal safety on the part of our

clients, rather than financial issues. We could also potentially run up against 
attacks on our online presence, such as website defacement or DoS attacks on 
our email servers. Here the motivation and intent are both in the direction of 
preventing our services from be conducted and potentially harming us or our 
clients.
Two very different situations lead to different focus in our security program, 
different controls in place, and a generally different focus. Although the set of 
tools and resources needed to carry out both efforts would be largely the same, 
the application of it would be rather different.
External Threats
When we think of threats to organizations, many of us picture dimly lit and 
smoke-filled rooms populated by black hat hackers banging away at their key-
boards as they chug highly caffeinated beverages, the stuff of cheesy hacker 
movies like Hackers and Swordfish.
Unfortunately, there is some element of truth to this. There are innumer-
able attackers out there leveling both manual and automated attacks at our 
networks during all hours of the day. Some of them may indeed be the sug-
ar-and-caffeine-fueled hacker nerds of movie fame, but some of them are also 
political activists, representatives of organized crime, members of foreign gov-
ernment–backed groups, spammers, scammers, and all manner of other unsa-
vory types. Some of these groups have individuals working of their efforts full 
time, and with areas like cybercrime they could have up to 15 years of industry 
experience.
External attacks are typically driven by one of a few things:
	
n	 Wrath—Attacks carried out in anger or as revenge for some slight
	
n	 Greed—Attacks carried out for some material gain
	
n	 Glory—Attacks carried out for the purpose of later boasting or street 
cred
	
n	 Reconnaissance—Attacks carried out for the purpose of collecting 
information
If you are unfamiliar with these movies, you are really missing out on a foundational bit of 
security knowledge. There are any number of lists https://paperpile.com/c/cTAM8E/aXE6 
[3] of greatest hacker movies on the internet, many of which share the same general set of 
movies. Grab some popcorn and a healthy suspension of disbelief and slog through a few of 
them.
NOTE

15
Understanding the Threats We Face
Many of the media-worthy attacks that we see today are done in the name of 
greed. Breaches among the industries that handle credit card data have become 
rampant, with the resulting financial data being put up for sale behind (virtual) 
closed doors. Although this will, of course, vary by industry, a large portion of 
attacks on public sector businesses will fall into the category. Fortunately, this 
does lend some level of specificity to the types of attacks and defenses that we 
need to put in place as protective measures.
Internal Threats
In addition to worrying about innumerable attacks from external organizations, 
we also need to be concerned with those that come from within. According to 
the 20115 Verizon Data Breach Report https://paperpile.com/c/cTAM8E/oGnR 
[4], 20.6% of all security incidents and 10.6% of all confirmed data breaches 
are sourced from insiders.
Although this may not seem to be a huge number of insider attacks, consider 
that just a single attack could cause the breach that landed a company a great 
deal of negative media attention, financial repercussions, reputational impacts, 
loss of stock share price, and a great many other undesirable such impacts. In 
addition, attacks from insiders have the potential to be much worse than those 
that are external. Although external attackers have to do some measure of work 
to get to their target, insiders may literally stroll right through all of an organi-
zation’s carefully planned defenses and back out again with the crown jewels 
on a thumb drive.
As security professionals, we need to have plans in place for how we will 
respond to an attack coming from a trusted source. As good example of this 
is the 2008 internal attack on the City of San Francisco computer networks 
https://paperpile.com/c/cTAM8E/JfW3 [5]. In this case, a disgruntled worker 
changed all of the administrator passwords for the network infrastructure 
devices and refused to give them to anyone else. Although this is not an attack 
in the traditional sense, it certainly crippled the ability of the organization to 
manage its networks and had the potential to have led to a much worse set of 
circumstances, had some network catastrophe taken place while the legitimate 
administrators of the network were locked out of their own devices.
In this particular case, the motivation was not malice, but indeed an overzeal-
ous desire to protect what Childs considered to be “his” network. The motiva-
tions behind insider attacks may not always be as clear cut and clean as those 
seen in external attacks.
Regulatory Risks
In addition to external and internal threats, there are a number of risks brought 
about by the regulatory environments within which most organizations 

16
CHAPTER 0: 
Why We Need Security Programs
operate, an area to which we will return in Chapter 2. For example, it would 
not be unusual for a company to be bound by regulations covering customer 
data, employee data, health care data, corporate reporting, sales records, and 
financial records, all simultaneously applied and all with a similar, but slightly 
different set of requirements. Even for large corporations with equally large 
budgets and staff, this can be a very cumbersome set of rules to follow and 
presents a large risk to the organization. Failure to comply in these areas can 
bring with it stiff financial penalties and can often affect the ability of the orga-
nization to operate in its industry. Large financial losses and loss of ability to 
conduct business are some of the main factors that cause the other threat vec-
tors to be considered as threats.
Although we might be perfectly justified in discussing this as a risk management 
issue, it is such a large and prevalent problem that it also fits well here. This is 
not cleanly an insider threat. Although we could look at it that way, the enforce-
ment and auditing that such a regulatory environment brings with it is carried 
out by external parties. To borrow a phrase from the bible, “out of us they went 
forth, but they were not of us” https://paperpile.com/c/cTAM8E/YUy6 [6].
We could look at this as an external threat equally as well; after all, this is a 
situation forced on us by external parties, but this is not quite right either. The 
regulatory environment exists to set the guard rails for our industry, to prevent 
those not blessed with an overabundance of scruples from engaging in unfair 
or unsavory business practices (this is only partially successful), and to protect 
consumers using the goods and services in question. We do want regulations 
to exist, but we must also be wary of the consequences of them being in place.
BENEFITS OF A FORMAL SECURITY PROGRAM
Given all of this, we need some method of dealing with all of these security-re-
lated issues. We need a formal structure or framework within which we can 
address the issues that we discussed earlier in the chapter to enable us to protect 
our assets while staying on the proper side of legal and compliance issues. A for-
mal security program can help us to ensure the security of our information assets 
and provide a framework for security to codify our desired security level, help 
assess and mitigate risk, and help keep our program and practices up to date.
Ensure Security of Information Assets
One of the chief reasons to develop a formal information security program, 
if not the reason, is to ensure the security of information assets. In the risk 
assessment process that we have been looking at, this is largely driven by the 
system characterization portion of the risk assessment.

n	 Results documentation
Cataloging Assets
Among the outputs of the system characterization step will be a list of the 
assets involved, a summary of what the system does, and an assessment of the 
criticality and sensitivity of the system and the data that it handles. Among 
these items, the list of assets is, quite possibly, the most critical.
Without some clear idea of what we are protecting, the task of protecting it 
becomes exceedingly difficult. The asset inventory should include, at a mini-
mum, the list of systems and the criticality of each of them. This can later be 
used as the basis for conducting risk assessments, disaster recovery, incident 
response, vulnerability scanning, patching, and a host of other information 
security and information technology processes.
Classifying Assets
In addition to developing an asset inventory so that we know specifically 
what we are protecting, in the sense of individual hosts, it is also vital that 
we know what the importance of the individual hosts is. We might choose 
any number of factors to rate the importance of a given host, but a few of 
the more likely are items such as whether the host is internet facing or not, 
whether it represents a single point of failure, whether it supports a criti-
cal process for the organization, and whether it stores or processes sensitive 
data. There will, of course, be any number of factors that may be more or less 
important in any given environment, and we should choose those appropri-
ate for our needs.
We can generally assign a criticality level to the system and can base further 
efforts in the direction of security it on this rating. As with the asset list that we 
It is absolutely vital when developing a formal information security program to have an up-to-
date and regularly updated list of assets as early as possible. We cannot protect the assets 
that we do not know about. One of the hardest tasks down the road is to go back and retrofit an 
asset inventory. Once the process of building and deploying systems has begun and the task 
of maintaining an asset inventory is not included as an integral part, going back to bolt it on 
later will be detrimental to the security program.
WARNING

18
CHAPTER 0: 
Why We Need Security Programs
just discussed, having a formal definition of the criticality of any given system 
is a foundational part of developing the security program. If we cannot say 
that system X is more, less, or equally as important that systems Y and Z, then 
we have no basis for prioritizing work toward securing these systems, incident 
response efforts, disaster recovery, and so on.
Provide a Framework for Security
A security program provides us with a framework in which we can approach 
the security for our organization and assets. Without a formal plan, our results 
are likely to be sporadic and vary greatly as one person or another who is 
involved in the effort applies his/her own interpretation on what the desired 
result and path to get there actually is. Where a formal security program gives 
us the equivalent of a GPS-based set of directions and a dynamically updating 
map on how to get there from where we are now, the lack of such a plan gives 
us directions relayed via the telephone by someone who is not clear on where 
we are starting from.
Codifies the Desired Security Level
A security program clearly defines the desired level of security for our organi-
zation. This will vary greatly from one organization to the next and will greatly 
depend on the information assets in question.
At a high level, we can look to our policies to define the desired level of secu-
rity. Our security policy should define the rules that are in place to protect the 
information assets of the organization, including things like customer data, 
intellectual property, and so on. The security policy should set the baseline of 
the state of security within the organization.
The distance between the desired security level and the actual security level 
will be informed by the output of our risk assessment, in particular the control 
recommendations. These recommendations, based on the information from 
the rest of the assessment, should identify the areas in which there are gaps 
between the present level of security and the desired level.

Benefits of a Formal Security Program
Provides a Mechanism to Assess Risk
Having a properly developed security program can help us to assess the risks 
that we might face as an organization. The process of defining the program 
will generate a risk assessment and the results of such will give us the mate-
rial and information from which to build the program. This information will 
come from the threat and vulnerability identification, analysis of existing con-
trols, determination of likelihood and impact, and the overall determination 
of risk.

n	 Control recommendations
	
n	 Results documentation
Given these items, and the resulting documentation from the assessment, the 
risks to the organization should be readily apparent. One of the very useful 
side effects of developing a risk-based security program is the output of per-
forming the risk assessment as a part of the process.
Helps Mitigate Risk
Having a properly developed security program will also help us to mitigate 
both the present risks that we have uncovered and those that may be discov-
ered in the future. The risk determination and control recommendations that 
are output from the risk assessment will directly help to mitigate risks.

n	 Impact analysis
	
n	 Risk determination
	
n	 Control recommendations
	
n	 Results documentation
Although the risks and recommendations should be clearly defined as a result 
of the assessment, they will only help to mitigate the risks by providing a list 
of what needs to be fixed. The actual work of remediating the risks may be 
considerably more difficult than simply constructing a list of problem areas. 

20
CHAPTER 0: 
Why We Need Security Programs
Often mitigation of risk will involve working with teams outside of informa-
tion security or even outside of information technology entirely, and may be a 
very involved process.
Helps Keep Program and Practices Up To Date
Having a formal security program can also help to keep your security program 
and its related practices up to date. Most processes that we will define as part 
of the information security program, for example, the risk assessment method-
ology that we have been discussing, are iterative and cyclical in nature—when 
we get to the last step of the process, we return to the first step and start all 
over again, hopefully continuing to refine and improve the program with each 
iteration of the process.
As we build each portion of the program, we define what the iterations will 
consist of and at what interval they will take place. For example, we might 
decide that the security policy that provides the basis for the program needs 
to be reviewed at a minimum of 6 month intervals—every 6 months we take it 
out, dust it off, and make changes based on our last 6 months of experiences 
with implementing the policy, significant changes that have been made within 
the environment since we last reviewed it, and so on. We will also, of course, 
make updates to it as need arises, given some glaring fault that was pointed out 
or radical change that occurred.
ACTIONS
 
Enable the Business
Understand the role of security in the business
	n	
It is of critical importance that we understand the role of security in the business. Security 
exists to enable the business to carry out its mission in a safe and secure manner. Security 
does not exist for its own sake. All of our decisions regarding the function of security within 
the organization need to be made with this concept in mind.
Establish context
	n	
As a corollary to understanding the role of security in the business, we need to establish the 
proper business context for security investments and efforts to the stakeholders in the busi-
ness. In many cases, security is seen as a cost or a tax on the business. It is very important 
that we communicate in terms that are relatable to business efforts.
Relate security investments
	n	
Security investments should relate directly to supporting the business. They should protect 
our customers, enable now business opportunities enable gains in efficiency and reduce the 
effort needed to complete tasks, and be of benefit to the business. Security investments do 
not exist for their own sake.

21
Actions
Communicate risk clearly
	n	
If we are having difficulty in gaining management support, funding, or resources to support 
security efforts, it is because we have not adequately communicated the risk of not doing 
so. We need to clearly communicate risk in terms that directly relate to impacts to our 
ability to conduct business.
Ensure the Security of Information Assets
Mitigate risk to acceptable levels
	n	
One of our key tasks is to mitigate risk to the point of being acceptable. We will not be able 
to eliminate risk entirely, and it would be a very costly exercise to attempt to do so. We need 
to reduce the risks to our confidentiality, integrity, and availability to levels that we can live 
with. These levels will vary by organization.
Influence in a positive direction
	n	
We should strive to continuously and positively influence the behavior of our organization 
in secure directions. Information security should not say no to anyone, but should give a 
qualified yes to those who consult us regarding their efforts. Becoming the security organi-
zation that always says no to its customers will result in security simply being ignored and 
bypassed as the business works to complete its primary mission.
Make security a top concern
	n	
Security should be one of the top concerns in our organization. It should be reflected  
in every aspect of the business, and should be a core tenet behind the design and 
development of every technologically oriented step that the various components of our 
organization take.
Provide a Framework for Security
Establish policies
	n	
Our security policies establish our risk posture and how we will manage it. The security 
policy defines what we mean when we say secure and provides the foundation on which to 
build the rest of our security program.
Establish standards
	n	
Our security standards define how we will keep our information assets secure. They are the 
framework by which we manage the security of our intellectual property and the various 
data on which our business operates.
Make use of existing information security standards
	n	
Following the adage of standing on the shoulders of giants, we should make use of existing 
industry-recognized security standards such as the various NIST special publications that 
relate to information security and the ISO 27000 family of standards, which covers informa-
tion security systems management.

CHAPTER 1
Strategy is the plan for achieving an organization’s business, mission, and objec-
tives. In today’s dynamic and rapidly shifting technological environment, stra-
tegic planning has been deemphasized and often criticized as to be no longer 
relevant. At the pace of technology adoption, planning from a strategy perspec-
tive has become an annual exercise rather than a disciplined formulation of near 
to long-term action planning along a defined three to five planning horizon.
Perhaps such long-range planning is no longer practical for those companies 
that heavily depend on technology, or are influenced by rapid changes in the 
market, but strategic planning still remains an essential part of defining clear 
objectives for the organization. Irrespective of the planning horizon, strategic 
planning defines clear business objectives, the respective goals to reach those 
objectives, strengths and weaknesses that act as tailwinds or headwinds, the 
key actions necessary to capitalize on these strengths or close critical gaps, and 
roles and responsibilities of those who are empowered to execute the actions 
to achieve the plan.

Business strategy is generally created at the upper levels of an organization, 
depending on the size and market focus of the company. Companies with a

narrowly focused strategic plan. Large corporations that participate in mul-
tiple markets with numerous products or services may have several business 
segment strategic plans that then roll up to a high-level corporate strategic 
plan. In either case, the degree of detail, specificity, and format is largely sub-
jective. Some organizations have detailed documents that are very descrip-
tive and lengthy; others may simply use a set of five or six presentation slides.
Creating an information security strategy and strategic plan is not any different 
from the planning process for the business. A clear and concise information 
security strategic plan allows business leadership, information security execu-
tives, information security managers, and their staff to understand what is the 
vision, mission, objectives, and plan for the organization and their role in its 
fulfillment. This provides the foundation of what is the direction and desired 
end state from “top down.” The additional benefit is that the strategic plan 
creates the annualized organizational goals that are further flowed down to 
the individual employee, providing traceability in performance goal planning 
at the organizational and individual levels. A discussion of performance plan-
ning and metrics will be covered later in Chapter 10.
DEVELOP THE ORGANIZATIONAL VISION AND MISSION 
STATEMENTS
A vision statement declares the objectives of the organization. Often an inter-
nal statement, a clear and concise vision communicates the organizational 
goals to management and staff. The vision statement should paint the picture 
of what leadership believes is the ideal state or value that it delivers to the 
business. Vision statements define what the leadership wants the business to 
become, in terms of market focus, growth, values, or contributions to society.
The vision statement for an information security organization should lay out 
the goals at a high level and should support or enable the business leader-
ship’s vision statement. A vision statement can be also reflective of the organi-
zational culture. For example, if innovation is a goal of the overall business, the 
information security vision should in some way support that goal. If lacking 
a ­higher-level business vision statement, the information security leadership 
should still attempt to relate the information security organizational vision 
statement back to the overall business’s objectives and goals. An example of an 
information security organization’s vision statement is provided.
Information security will provide world-class, innovative, value-added 
solutions and services to our company; create a work environment where our 
employees are proud to work, and make a positive impact on our community.
Vision statements and mission statements are very different. Mission statements 
define the organization’s purpose. These statements explain why information 

25
Describe the Information Security Environment
security exists as an organization or function. Similar to vision statements, 
mission statements should be short, clear, and powerful. An example mission 
statement is provided as follows.
Through cost effective and innovative solutions, our mission is to educate and 
empower our employees to make informed risk-based decisions, work securely 
and safely, and reduce the technology risks associated with our business.
Ensure that the vision and mission statements are short, concise, clear, focused and 
even inspiring. Long, complex vision and mission statements tend to be “every-
thing and the kitchen sink,” which may not be reasonable or even attainable. 
They should be easy on the tongue and natural. They should be easy to memorize 
for both managers and staff who are all ambassadors of the information security 
organization back to the business. Lastly, vision and mission statements should 
be revaluated as the business changes; information security strategy can quickly 
become stale and irrelevant if it does not reflect the changes in business strategy.
DESCRIBE THE INFORMATION SECURITY ENVIRONMENT
To formulate the strategy and plan, the information security leadership needs 
to understand the environment that surrounds the business with a focus on 
its mission and goals. The information security strategy and strategic plan 
are based on the higher-order, strategic influences that create the function for 
protecting the business. Businesses generate their understanding of the envi-
ronment and formulate strategies based on this understanding using several 
techniques, methods, or tools.
	
n	 Strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats or SWOT analysis
	
n	 Threat-opportunities-weaknesses-strengths or TOWS analysis
	
n	 Political-economic-social-technological or PEST analysis
	
n	 Porter’s five factors
	
n	 Critical success factors
Originated by Albert Humphrey in the 1960s for Stanford Research Institute, 
the SWOT analysis is a well-known method of strategic planning. A SWOT 
analysis can also be a method for understanding the security environment 
or posture through the lens of internal strengths and weaknesses, as well as 
external opportunities and potential threat. The use of an information security 
aligned SWOT analysis supports the business strategy by addressing informa-
tion security factors, issues, and challenges unique to the business and there-
fore complements the overall business strategy.
	
n	 Strengths—the most effective information security factors of the 
business

CHAPTER 1:

n	 Opportunities—factors that can help the company improve its 
information security
	
n	 Threats—man-made or natural factors that may exploit company 
information security weaknesses
An application of a SWOT analysis is provided—the management of an imag-
inary professional services firm that advises companies on financial services 
needs to start its information security program. The firm has 100 consultants 
and associates that either work from home or travel to customer locations 
to perform these services nationwide. The company employees are highly 
reliant on three core IT services—office productivity, collaboration, and 
human resources applications, which are offered as cloud-hosted Software 
as a Service. The company uses a Bring Your Own Device approach to end 
computing. The new information security leader is developing a company 
strategy using a SWOT analysis. After the security leader’s analysis, a SWOT-
based list of current information security factors is developed as in Fig. 1.1.

27
Describe the Information Security Environment
For Strengths, the information security leader lists the most effective infor-
mation security characteristics, for example, experienced security leadership, 
strong security practices in their cloud providers, and, since financial commu-
nity is highly regulated in information security, a very compliance-focused cul-
ture. These strengths would be capitalized upon in the strategy development. 
In evaluating information security Weaknesses, the security leader noted that 
their employees are buying a wide variety of laptops and cell phones without 
any guidance on minimum features, such as security software, e.g., antivirus. 
Also there were no formal policies on handling company information on per-
sonal devices or security awareness program informing them of any policies 
or restrictions. Lastly, a weakness in the contractual relationship between the 
cloud provider and the company exists when and to whom security incidents 
are reported. These factors should be improved.
Opportunities identified in our exemplar by the security leader are factors—
generally external, but can be internal—that can help the company improve its 
security. In our example, these may be security training and awareness products 
that can be bought commercially, subscription to the cloud provider’s addi-
tional data protection security services, and specially discounted end-point 
protection software for various device platforms. Threats are those factors that 
exploit the company’s information security weaknesses, and are either of a 
man-made or natural environmental source. For instance, as a financial ser-
vices firm, there are regulatory requirements in protecting customer financial 
data. Likewise, these companies are often targeted by the most motivated and 
sophisticated threat actors, unusual organized cyber criminals. Also, as expe-
rienced information security professionals are in high demand, the company 
may have a lack of experienced information security staff. Lastly, the threat of 
earthquakes is a natural environmental hazard in our example.
It is from the SWOT analysis that high-level strategic objectives emerge from 
our financial services professional advisory firm:
	
n	 Establish security function and policies,
	
n	 Provide a safe and secure employee experience, and
	
n	 Leverage cloud service provider security offerings.
Likewise, the process offers goals or actions in support of the strategy objectives 
for evaluation and prioritization:
	
n	 Create company security policies that are relevant for financial services 
professional,
	
n	 Contract for commercial “off-the-shelf” security training for the 
employees that build upon the new company security policies,
	
n	 Identify specialized information security search firm for recruiting key 
talent, when needed,

Each strategic recommendation should be evaluated using different criteria, for 
example, relative cost of the strategy’s operationalization, ease or difficultly of 
implementation, relative effectiveness of the strategy, i.e., does it completely 
or partially address a weakness or threat. Strategies may include actions or ini-
tiatives that can be implemented in the short term (“quick wins”), whereas 
others may require expanded investments in additional staff, technology, or 
processes over extended time. Companies do not have unlimited operating 
capital resources for new recommendations and security leaders will be asked 
to prioritize their list of alternate strategies; when developing the presentation 
it is best to be prepared for the discussion rather than be sent away for more 
information gathering and analysis.
Search out and team with the business leader who leads the organizational or 
business strategy development and planning function. This individual is crit-
ical to the information security leader’s understanding of the overall business 
strategic planning process, as well as the techniques and methods used in the 
planning process. An additional benefit is that the business strategy individual 
may not have contemplated information security as an environmental factor 
or risk to attaining overall strategic objectives. This individual could very well 
champion information security in other forums and efforts.
DELIVERING THE INFORMATION SECURITY STRATEGIC 
PLAN
Up to this point, the information security leader has gained support from 
stakeholders, as well as feedback and/or redirection on mission, vision, and 
initial strategy, the core activity is to move from strategy to planning. There are 
various methods in action planning, the most commonly in information secu-
rity being either threat-based planning or capability-based planning.
Threat-based planning is essentially the measures of countering potential state 
threat capabilities with the defensive countermeasures by focusing on poten-
tial threats, man-made or natural. Threat-based planning assumes the orga-
nization is at a high state of protection at all times. The core of threat-based 
planning are answers to the questions “who is the threat” and “what might 
they do.” A list of threats are developed and scenarios are developed as the 

29
Delivering the Information Security Strategic Plan
basis for further detailed planning on architecture, infrastructure, and indi-
vidual defensive technologies (generally the combined people, process, and 
technology) to counter the threat.
The methods of threat-based planning for information security planning 
­purposes were heavily drawn from US military strategic planning processes 
in the post-Cold War era and the methodology is preeminent when threats 
to US interests are easily recognized and contingency, then determine the 
amount of force needed to prevail in that scenario. This approach lends itself 
to dynamic and static modeling and provides a quantifiable rationale for the 
recommended force structure. This approach to strategic planning continued 
well into the 1990s, with some variation of flexibility and adaptability added 
as corollaries, but was fully forced into reexamination in the post 9/11 realities 
of an asymmetric threat (e.g., international, borderless terrorism).
In its application to information technology, threat-based planning took 
shape in the 1990s. An example of threat-based planning is threat modeling. 
Threat modeling is a method for optimizing information security by identify-
ing objectives and vulnerabilities, and then defining countermeasures to pre-
vent, or mitigate the effects of, threats. Threat modeling takes on a defender’s 
perspective.
The concept of threat modeling through attack trees was introduced by Dr. 
Edward Amoroso in 1994.1 Attack trees describe how an asset, or target, might 
be attacked through the use of diagrams. In 1999, Bruce Schneider further 
proposed the use of attack trees to model threats against technology. “If we 
can understand all the different ways in which a system can be attacked, we 
can likely design countermeasures to thwart those attacks.”2 This means that 
threats are examined and defensive measures are identified. Threat modeling 
could be correlated with an organization’s security policy and risk manage-
ment in a way that business executives can easily understand risk, regardless of 
their level of expertise. The benefit was for senior management, security spe-
cialists, network managers, and application developers to work collaboratively 
in the prioritization and mitigation of threats.
Challenges in threat modeling for large, organizational purposes began to 
emerge in the post-9/11 era where threats shifted, morphed, and adapted at a 
much more rapid speed than before. Simultaneously, multiple threats sources 
materialized where in the past a single large threat existed and was highly pre-
dictable. In the realm of information technology, the threats are numerous 
and diverse and rapidly change and evolve. The ability to address all threats, at

all times, becomes untenable from a resource capacity, scalability, and budget 
perspective. Threat modeling also requires highly specialized subject matter 
experts with in-depth knowledge of organizational risk from an architecture, 
infrastructure, and application security perspective, which itself proves to be 
a challenge finding qualified security professionals with these specialized cre-
dentials. The pervasiveness of information technology in every business pro-
cess, now requiring infrastructure and systems, introduces and aggregates a 
significant number of threats and attack trees, all which need to be addressed 
and comprehended for program planning. Lastly, threat-based strategy can be 
costly for organizations to try to implement—to address all threats at all times, 
assumes that security will be at its highest spending levels all the time. This is 
not to discard threat-based planning and modeling; for small organizations 
that only depend on a smaller set of applications and single infrastructure, 
threat-based planning may be appropriate, if not desirable.
Enter capability-based planning. Capabilities-based planning is more appro-
priate when threats are unpredictable, dynamic, and multifaceted. These types 
of threats do not fit in a single attack tree, scenario-based analysis. Capability-
based planning focuses on multiple threats and applies the appropriate mix of 
required capabilities.
A major challenge with capability-based planning is convincing senior lead-
ership that information security has established the proper linkage between 
an uncertain future and the specific investments requested to establish the rel-
evant capabilities. This is where risk management perspective can make the 
linkage more understandable.
INFORMATION SECURITY CAPABILITY ROAD MAP 
DEVELOPMENT
Information security leaders and practitioners need a framework for guiding 
the organization around its strategic plan. Road maps are a common approach 
to articulate that plan. An information security strategic road map is a time-
based plan that defines where a business is, where it wants to go, and how 
to get it there. It is a visual illustration that organizes and presents informa-
tion related to the strategic plan and future tactical plans. They are an effective 
communication tool for managers, and link strategic initiatives with business 
plans.
A road map describes a destination in terms of goals, timelines, and interme-
diate stops on the way. It shows practical steps necessary to get to the desired 
destination. It considers interdependencies among steps and anticipates alter-
native routes that help optimize resource allocation and minimize risks. The 
road map is designed to structure the communication between the information 

31
Information Security Capability Road Map Development
security organization, functional support, and various stakeholders in a man-
ner that allows the information security entity to:
	
n	 Act strategically when making investment decisions and managing 
projects.
	
n	 Securing buy-in from business leadership that makes it easier to earn 
buy-in from business users.
	
n	 Negotiate more effectively with leaders or staff who request new 
projects or initiatives that require significant, nonoperating effort.
Road maps should include the following:
	
n	 A strategy statement based on the earlier business and information 
security strategic planning.
	
n	 A prioritized list of improvement opportunities. This is generated jointly 
by the business and IT and should be refreshed periodically.
	
n	 A timeline of the initiatives and projects that will occur over the next 
several years with approximate start and end dates, durations, and sizes.
	
n	 High-level justifications for each project. These should be robust for 
projects over the next 12 months and simpler statements for projects 
past the 12-month horizon.
	
n	 The estimated cost and duration for each project. This is specific and 
reasonably accurate for projects occurring over the next 12 months 
and can be vaguer for projects that go out farther than that. An owner 
for each project. This is the sponsoring executive or delegate directly 
overseeing the project. For projects in the next 12 months it should be 
the specific person and for projects beyond that it can be the owning 
executive.
It may involve a couple of rounds of iteration before it is finalized. Here it 
is important to note that the information security strategic plan as articu-
lated as a road map is where the organization aspires to be in a couple of 
years and what it would look like when compared with the current state. 
Without the linkage to strategy, it may become a “to-do” list with loads of 
activities and timelines and individual names who are responsible for var-
ious activities. An example road map that addresses active cyber threats is 
represented in Fig. 1.2.
The information security leader can use the road map to facilitate investment 
discussions with the rest of the executive leadership. The leader will use the 
road map as a baseline when discussing new projects or priorities with exec-
utives. It will help the leadership understand how to balance investment and 
project priorities and provide a way to visualize trade-offs. The road map will 
help them anticipate resourcing needs, plan assignments, software and vendor 
selection, and costs ahead of time, and make it possible to start visioning and 
planning with the functional owners well in advance.

CHAPTER 1: 
Develop an Information Security Strategy
STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
Once the strategy has been formulated into high-level alternatives, it is ben-
eficial to begin stakeholder engagement to test the assumptions and recom-
mendations. Formulating and managing an information security strategy, 
particularly those that are enterprise-wide, is full of challenges. Stakeholder 
buy-in is extremely helpful to gain traction, achieve momentum, and realize 
success. Stakeholder engagement is also very helpful for establishing risk appe-
tite during the description of any one strategy and its importance to reduce 
risk, either real or perceived. Key activities in stakeholder engagement are iden-
tifying the key stakeholder, engaging as soon as possible, receiving feedback 
and input, refining or refocusing strategic alternatives, and reinforcing strategy 
through continual communication.
Identifying the key stakeholder is the process of really understanding who 
the key actors are, what they are concerned about, and their relationship to 
the information security strategy and recommendations. Methods to identify 
stakeholder include a vertical, horizontal, and external scan of organizations, 
functions, and individual personalities that have a vested interest in the infor-
mation security strategy and program.
A vertical scan may reach up to the highest echelon of the organization, 
including the senior leadership and even board of directors, to the individual

Summary
employee. A horizontal scan includes the operational entities and supporting 
functions of the business. Operational entities, or those lines of business that 
are customer facing, are important to engage as they are directly affected by the 
information security program as they go to market. Conflicts or misalignments 
that may occur from information security initiatives should be understood 
before they impact those business processes or delivery from generating reve-
nue. Failure to do so will incur the perception of information security inhibit-
ing the business.
Horizontal scanning involves the identification of other functional organiza-
tions that support the business. Functional entities, such as human resources, 
legal, communications, procurement, and finance, have an influence on the 
information security program as supporters of strategic initiatives as well as 
the avenue in which these program elements are delivered. An example is 
human resources (HR)—not only is HR an important function in supporting 
security workforce management program (i.e., recruiting, hiring, and retaining 
an information security professional), but also the HR team may additionally 
deliver information security training and awareness as an employee learning 
and development activity.
Once stakeholder engagement has been accomplished, the information secu-
rity leadership can process feedback back into the overall strategy. Adjustments 
and tuning not only help refine the strategy to make it more appropriate for fit, 
but also help garner support from stakeholders as they recognize these adjust-
ments based on their feedback.
SUMMARY
Information security strategic planning is about setting the vision, estab-
lishing short- and long-term goals, providing directions, and acknowledg-
ing the limitations and constraints that will guide the attainment of these 
goals. A clear and concise information security strategic plan allows senior 
leadership, executive management, and key staff to understand where the 
organization is expected to go, focus their efforts in the right direction, and 
describe the end state once they have accomplished their goals. A holistic 
information security strategic plan can be more effective when a disciplined, 
rigorous approach toward planning and execution is adopted. The meth-
ods described in this chapter require the integration of people, process, and 
technology dimensions of information security while ensuring it is aligned 
with the business and supports the overarching business goals. The better the 
alignment and integration to strategic decision making, the more effective 
the information security program will be in targeting and achieving its own 
state goals and objectives.

ACTIONS
 
Develop the information security organizational vision and mission statements.
	n	
Built upon the overall business vision and mission statements, the ­information security 
vision and mission statements should be short, concise, easy to understand in nontechnical 
terms. The use of technical terms and jargon may confuse the business leaders to its real 
value and business benefits.
Describe the current information security environment.
	n	
The information security team should first describe the current environment and  
security posture as an assessment of the “As Is” state of security. This is the starting point 
for developing forward-looking strategic plan and later road maps. It is from where the 
journey starts.
Develop the strategic plan
	n	
The strategic planning process should describe future state and pathway from current state 
to future state. There are a number of strategic planning tools that the information security 
team can use; most important is to use and adopt the same strategic planning tools as the 
business and IT planning tools to ensure a common framework and alignment with the 
business and IT. The use of radically different planning  
processes and tools may confuse business and IT leaders.
Deliver a plan of action through information security road maps.
	n	
Information security road maps provide a calendarized view of tactical ­initiatives that 
support the strategic goals and objectives. Each road map node will eventually become a 
formal project or improvement activity to ­incrementally advance the organization toward the 
desired end state.
Engage key stakeholders to test for alignment and relevancy
	n	
Key stakeholder should be identified and continually updated on the progress to plan. Their 
support, both near- and long term, will help communicate the importance and relevance 
of the plan to other business leaders. Their ­support will be critical to receive the necessary 
resources and budget to execute the plan.

CHAPTER 2
Now that the strategy and strategic plan is established, the security leader will 
need to gain adoption and embed information security into the business. 
Integration of security into the business organization and operations can be 
influenced through three dimensions: organizational culture, business process 
structure, and business operations.
UNDERSTAND THE ORGANIZATIONAL SECURITY 
CULTURE
The culture of an organization is basically its personality. It includes the goals, 
assumptions, beliefs, values, norms, behaviors, customs, rites, history, and 
dress of the people who work for the organization. It is what makes employees 
feel like they belong and what encourages them to work collectively to achieve 
organizational goals. A strong security culture is both a mindset and mode of 
operation. One that is integrated into day-to-day thinking and decision mak-
ing can make for a near-impenetrable operation. Conversely, a security culture 
that is absent will foster uncertainty and, ultimately, lead to security incidents 
that the organization likely cannot afford to incur. It might be difficult to move 
an organization’s culture in a different direction or to make major changes, but 
actually change is occurring all the time due to a variety of influences, internal 
and external to the organization.
An organization’s culture is generally reflected in its mission or vision state-
ment and explicitly stated core values. The core values spell out the organiza-
tion’s basic beliefs and passions, i.e., what the company stands for and what 
it values. The mission statement is created based on the core values. The core

36
CHAPTER 2: 
Integrate Security Into the Organization
values and the mission statement are used to guide the organization when 
making strategic, and even ethical, decisions. There are organizations that 
include the terms “secure,” “security” and “privacy” in their vision and/or mis-
sion statements, particularly those in highly regulated industries that require 
data security. However, inclusion of the words “privacy” or “information secu-
rity” in an organization’s list of core values does not guarantee that everyone 
in the organization will value them unless management demonstrates its com-
mitment. Many organizations periodically review their mission statements 
and core values, to ensure they reflect the organization’s guiding principles. 
Security executives should use that opportunity to convince top management 
that information security and privacy should be included among their organi-
zation’s core values. Security executives can use these concerns, cite laws and 
regulations that punish noncompliance, emphasize the positive impact on 
employees and productivity, and point out the impression it will make on the 
organization’s customers. This will have the effect of making security a priority 
for the top leaders in the organization.
Indeed, the strongest influence comes from the top leadership position, some-
thing security professionals can use to their advantage to encourage the change 
that is needed to achieve a more secure organization. Many organizations rec-
ognize the need to secure their data but do not know how to make it a prior-
ity throughout the organization. To this end, one recommendation is starting 
with identifying the benefits to the business leaders so that they realize the 
need for the change, then identifying the specific steps to be taken to imple-
ment the change (i.e., the information security program).1
Since the business context is already understood at the highest levels, it is 
important to now “sell information security” in the appropriate levels and 
with the most important partners. The natural start is with the stakeholders 
identified during the validation stage of testing the strategy’s fit for purpose. 
However, it is often the next level of the lines of business operations that will 
have to adopt, directly or indirectly, the information security program. These 
stakeholders will most likely be supportive if the value of the program is cor-
rectly communicated. You can justify information security value by centering 
on four common aspects of the value proposition for information security: 
compliance, risk, revenue, and reputation.
Compliance is well understood by all businesses as the foundation of good 
management. The policies and standards usually come in two forms, exter-
nal and internal. External regulations, legal statutes or industry mandates 
will influence the security policies as a set of requirements that the business 
must adopt. Examples are statutory privacy requirements when handling 
1Thornbury J. Creating a living culture: the challenges for business leaders. Corporate Governance 
2003;3(2):68–79.

37
Understand the Organizational Security Culture
personal health information governed by the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act, national, regional, or even local legal statues may govern 
not only handling of personal identifiable information, but data breach dis-
closure requirements, and industry standards such as Payment Card Industry 
Data Security Standards outline privacy requirements and technical standards 
associated with credit card transitions. Internal policies will generally have the 
same weight of external policies. Internal policies may be an interpretation or 
foundation from the external regulatory or industry standards that govern the 
business. In other cases, internal policies are the statement of requirements—
operational or technical—that must be adhered to for the proper functioning 
of business processes or systems. The value of the information security pro-
gram to avoid noncompliance and possible penalties can be quite attractive.
The second aspect, risk, is one that must be tailored to the stakeholder’s per-
spective. Each business leader or personality may have a different perspective 
on risk and the language and concepts should be slightly adapted to fit the 
individual’s framework. Simply explaining the numerous threats that the busi-
ness is exposed to will not convince everyone of the particular value of the 
program, particularly if the company has survived without any trouble to date. 
C-suite executives care less about a particular virus or how many times the 
firewalls were probed for a particular port or protocol. Chief executive officers 
and board members will care about reputation risk, as described later. Chief 
financial officers care about financial risk; they will be much more interested 
in the cost to a financial risk model that ties the return on investment of the 
information security program (reduce current costs, reduce future costs, and 
reduce the financial risk to the business). Business line executives are much 
more interested in business risk across their portfolio than a single system or 
application; they look for risks to the entire portfolio of processes or systems 
could aggregate significant downside to their quarter or annual plan. For man-
agers who rely on their business-related transactional applications, that may 
be more concerned over the confidentiality, availability, or integrity of infor-
mation being processed than the latest threat tactic using malicious software 
against a particular vulnerability.
The connection of information security and revenue is hard to make, partic-
ularly as security is perceived as a function than as a generator of revenue. 
Information security’s return on investment, or more appropriately “return 
on security investment,” is difficult to calculate, but something that can be 
achieved, often in terms of cost avoidance or savings. A transactional system 
security incident can result in outages that subsequently impact the business of 
generating cash. The financial value of information security program in getting 
things back up and running quickly is something that actually can be finan-
cially appraised. In some industries, information security may be viewed as a 
competitive advantage and valued by customers who may articulate the selec-
tion of one business over another based on information security capability 

38

Integrate Security Into the Organization
as a criterion. For example, those companies that follow ISO 27000 frame-
work and formally audit their data centers, applications, or systems against this 
framework often offer these certifications as a discriminator and valued aspect 
of their service delivery against others. Likewise, products that are formally 
certified under ISO/IEC 15408 Common Criteria for Information Technology 
Security Evaluation (commonly referred to as Common Criteria), interna-
tional standard (ISO/IEC 15408) are provided preference over those products 
that have not had their security model formally evaluated. For the US Federal 
government, Common Criteria is used as the basis for procurement decisions 
in analyzing alternatives.
The impact to a business’s reputation is not necessarily a hard story to tell. In 
recent years, the media and newslines have reported that several high-profile 
businesses have had their reputations dented by security incidents. Technology, 
retail, and banking industry firms have had reported compromises and outages 
due to internal and external threats. It is worthwhile explaining that not just 
external threats can damage a business’s brand, as many companies have suf-
fered bad media due to the improper or errant use of system, as well as fraud 
and identity theft, by an internal user. These high-profile incidents are very use-
ful for explaining the impact that security incidents can have on a company’s 
reputation. If a business has spent decades building a solid brand, explaining 
just how quickly and easily reputations can be harmed is an acceptable man-
ner to emphasize the value of information security. Executives and managers 
understand the value of brand and consequences of brand erosion.
Beyond business executives and managers’ adoption of information security 
culture, it should be well understood as a set of day-to-day practices by the 
employees. It would be a mistake to target massive change of culture at the 
employee level, particularly those that are global in nature, so information 
security should focus on a common understanding of information security 
awareness and a standard set of employee practices. First, ensure that a com-
mon information security awareness training articulates the key information 
security policies in easy–to-understand language. It should reference the doc-
umented information security policy and where it can be found on the cor-
porate intranet. The training should outline what steps the business has taken 
to maintain information security, protect information, and acceptable use of 
company resources (inclusive of information). Beyond the employee-level 
training, role-based targeted training is also a mechanism to change behav-
ior. One example is manager information security training; managers need to 
understand not only their obligation to maintain information security, but 
also how to identify indicators of employee bad behavior and how to correct it. 
In another example of role-based training, if the business is concerned about 
deploying secure systems, an applications security training and secure coding 
may be a manner to reinforce positive behavior with the develop community. 

39
Integrate Information Security Into Business Processes
At a common employee level, antiphishing training is an example of proactive 
training to test their behavior in protecting data against clever social engineer-
ing attacks. Training should be constant to ensure an enduring effect.
INTEGRATE INFORMATION SECURITY INTO BUSINESS 
PROCESSES
There is a distinct difference between a business function and a business pro-
cess. There may literally be any number of functional organizations in an 
enterprise—human resources, finance, legal, sales, marketing, and communi-
cations to name but a few common business functions. Business processes are 
less numerous. Business processes are generally a set of repeated activities that 
produce something of value for the business, stakeholders, and customers. The 
business process represents a stream of activities, their inputs, and their results. 
Processes have names like product development, supply chain, order handling, 
distribution, logistics, and market development. Processes can pass through 
many different organizational business functions. For example, a new prod-
uct may have been originally designed through the combined efforts of the 
research and development, engineering, and marketing functions, then passed 
through many of the business’s other functions on its way to market and cus-
tomer hands. Functions tend to reflect how a business is organized, whereas 
processes reflect how a business behaves.
In integrating information security practices, it is extremely important to 
understand information security issues in the context of business processes. 
From a process perspective, information flows between activities, people, func-
tions, and organizations as a process component. Information, as an asset, may 
have a process owner who creates or originates the information. Information 
users, or stewards, carry out the process owner’s requirements in their part of 
the process flow. Basic information protection requirements such as classifica-
tion, authorization, authentication, and accountability that are imposed on 
the information in the process-based view that may not reflect a pure “systems 
view” due to the information flows between organizations and individuals. 
Nevertheless, they come closer to a true reflection of the business needs of 
protection throughout the process. Therefore information security is affected 
directly in real time through process arrangements, tools, and people in those 
activities that are process based.
This poses a challenge to the business process owner who will need assistance 
from information security. The business process owners will need the guidance 
and advices on translating the information security policy in a meaningful 
way to impose protection requirements end to end. Information security must 
also develop an understanding of the major processes in the organization. 
Information security will need to understand the business process architecture

Integrate Security Into the Organization
that defines the processes, interrelationships (“interprocesses”), and informa-
tion that flow through the business to its suppliers, partners, and customers. It 
is also essential to educate the appropriate management and business process 
owners the value of implementing controls, such as enhancing predictability, 
stability, repetition, and overall quality. Information security should not be 
perceived as inhibiting or throttling the business process; information secu-
rity should support the overall business process objectives without creating a 
bottleneck. A further benefit is the cost avoidance of reengineering processes 
or supporting technology for remediating failures that may or have led to secu-
rity incidents. The cost of reengineering may be more than the insertion of 
information security well before the design and development of a solution, 
product, or service. By participating in the business process creation or reengi-
neering process, information security can be embedded in the business pro-
cesses as a value-add partner.
ESTABLISH INFORMATION SECURITY BUSINESS 
RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT
The third key point of integration is establishing a partnership with the busi-
ness. The classic integration is the placement, or alignment, of an information 
security representative or officer with the business entity in a direct support 
role. An information security officer plays a critical role in informing, advis-
ing, and alerting the general management on matters relating to the enterprise 
information security policy and program. The duties of the information secu-
rity officer are typically managerial; the information security officer may be a 
single representative of the enterprise program to the business or may direct a 
team of analysts, engineers, and operations staff that are in direct support to 
the business unit. Some of the key responsibilities of the information security 
officer are:
	
n	 Reviews internal processes, standards, guidelines, requirements, and 
practices, both at the enterprise and local levels
	
n	 Updates internal control structures and standard operating procedures
	
n	 Conducts annual reviews for security compliance
	
n	 Provides security impact assessments and feedback
	
n	 Identifies security training needs and completing training requirements
	
n	 Protects identifying information collected in accordance with policies
	
n	 Reports proven or suspected exposure or disclosure of personal 
information
	
n	 Supports communication of security information to the unit
	
n	 Provides input and feedback on current and future security standards 
and initiatives
	
n	 Reports unit concerns and considerations related to security

41
Establish Information Security Business Relationship Management
The challenge in this role is that information security officer is often considered 
a support or subordinate role. The information security officer is perceived as 
a technical expert in the domain information security, but less of an expert on 
the business itself with the knowledge and skills of an information security 
officer. On a positive note, the information security officer role and relation-
ship with the business has been evolving along with the advent of business 
relationship management. Business relationship management and the busi-
ness relationship manager role were introduced as a process in Information 
Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) 2011. Business relationship manage-
ment is a formal approach to understanding, defining, and supporting strategic 
and tactical business activities. Business relationship management consists of 
knowledge, skills, and behaviors that promote a more synergistic relationship 
between a service organization (e.g., information security) and its business 
partners. Concepts and principles that surround business relationship man-
agement are described in Business Relationship Management chapter of ITIL 
Service Strategy book.
Applied to information security, business relationship management addresses 
a fundamental principal—to gain a better understanding of the business and 
information technology (IT), therefore reducing the barriers and providing 
better alignment between the information security function and the business. 
A mature information security to business model will ultimately support two 
key goals: a defined relationship where information security has a specified 
purpose and role with the business and a set of processes that make up the 
information security to business management relationship lifecycle.
An information security relationship manager (e.g., Business Information 
Security Officer or Business Information Risk Manager) is the information secu-
rity liaison for each major business line-of-business or entity. The information 
security relationship manager should be familiar with the business processes 
and provides advice to ensure maximum value for business-related information 
security requirements. The information security relationship managers should 
possess domain knowledge of information security and business acumen. The 
key traits of successful information security relationship managers are strategic 
vision and structured thinking, knowledge of industry trends in business and 
technology, strong teamwork and interpersonal skills, and excellent presenta-
tion and communication skills. The information security relationship manager 
is a crucial link between the information security organization and business 
partner by acting as an orchestrator, connector, and facilitator. The information 
security relationship manager responsibilities include:
	
n	 Aligns business, IT, and information security for synergies
	
n	 Defines key strategies for the delivery of information security to the 
business

42
CHAPTER 2: 
Integrate Security Into the Organization
	
n	 Understands and communicates information security concerns
	
n	 Recognizes new technology trends and forecast future information 
security requirements
	
n	 Works with project managers to embed security into project phases
	
n	 Helps evaluate IT project objectives and analyzes new business initiative
	
n	 Works with information security executive’s financials staff on IT 
budgets
The information security relationship manager should be equally familiar with 
other IT functions (e.g., infrastructure, applications), disciplines, and processes 
to ensure maximum value for business-related IT and information security 
requirements. The information security relationship manager will need to 
engage with other IT functions, such as:
	
n	 Enterprise architecture. Engagement with enterprise architecture will 
provide the function a greater understanding of information security 
technology and solutions, or develop a strategy to synergize the overall 
IT and information security road map for various lines of business. 
Portfolio Management. The information security relationship manager 
will help estimate and prioritize various initiatives or projects on which 
the business would want information security to work on.
	
n	 Project management office. The information security relationship 
manager can provide subject matter expert advice on key information 
security related risks that need to be addressed in the execution of a 
project (i.e., requirement phase, design phase, or preproduction).
	
n	 Security and infrastructure operations. The information security 
relationship manager will need to understand current state as well as 
any incidents.
With the advent of the business relationship management discipline, secu-
rity executives should leverage this paradigm as a manner to understanding, 
defining, and supporting interbusiness activities. The business should see the 
information security relationship manager as a trusted partner. To develop 
this deeper relationship, the information security executive and senior infor-
mation security relationship manager should identify the partners within 
scope of information security delivery. Typically, the partner would be the 
person who represents the business entity, but not necessarily limited to the 
partner alone. Other interested parties may include management, custom-
ers, shareholders, professional bodies, and suppliers. The information secu-
rity executive appoints the information security relationship manager to the 
business partner. Named individuals should be responsible for managing the 
relationship. This individual should be at an appropriate level of seniority 
responsible for managing the relationship and accountable to the business 
partner for performance.

43
Establish Information Security Business Relationship Management
Once appointed, the information security relationship manager establishes 
engagement and communications with the business partner. The informa-
tion security relationship manager must identify business partner needs and 
ensures that the information security function is able to meet these needs. One 
of the main purposes of business relationship management is to identify busi-
ness partner demand in a business context, and translate it into a requirement 
for the information security function. The information security relationship 
manager must understand desired business outcomes. This must be explained 
in business terms, such as improvements in data protection, reducing cost of 
security incidents, and greater maturity of security process. It is important to 
identify the benefits as well as value realization.
The information security relationship manager will also define how business 
outcomes will be achieved. The information security relationship manager, 
along with the information security executive, will need to provide the trace-
ability from the desired outcome to how it will be achieved. There needs to be 
an agreement between partners on what and how information security will be 
provided to meet these outcomes. Lastly, the information security relationship 
manager should monitor change and manage it. The information security rela-
tionship manager will need to manage change requirements, drive improve-
ments, measure satisfaction, and deal with incidents and/or complaints. This 
involves not only reacting to incidents, but also being proactive in the manage-
ment of the business partner’s expectations.
Although information security executives are keen on engaging the business 
through their information security relationship managers to enhance the infor-
mation security to business relationship, it is also important to evaluate and 
improve the value of the relationship. This can be measured in two dimensions: 
organizationally and individually. The information security function’s organi-
zational success should be continuously measured using the following criteria:
	
n	 The quality and number of information security solutions that were 
proposed to the business partner for supporting or growing the business 
top or bottom line. This can be measured both organizationally and 
individually.
	
n	 The degree to which the business partner is up to date on key 
information security initiatives. This can be demonstrated in feedback 
from the business partner to the information security executive. 
Typically this is measured individually, to the degree that the 
information security relationship manager is responsible for keeping 
the business partner informed.
	
n	 Business partner satisfaction surveys on the state of the relationship. 
This includes an average measured satisfaction for information security 
delivery.

CHAPTER 2: 
Integrate Security Into the Organization
SUMMARY
Ultimately, information security helps deliver business goals. Integration 
of security into the business organization and operations can be influenced 
through three dimensions: organizational culture, business process ­structure, 
and business operations. The importance of information security as an 
­organizational capability is constantly growing due to the shift in the informa-
tion security’s role from an “order taker” to strategic business partner. Weaving 
organizational culture, business processes, and business relationship manage-
ment as an to integration framework between information security and the 
business facilitates the adoption of the information security strategy, objectives 
and goals while creating a relationship with the business as an equal partner.
ACTIONS
 
Assess and align information security to the organization’s culture.
	n	
Identify the key elements of the organizational business model, structure, and culture. Align 
security as a “value add” in maintaining compliance to external and internal policies, regu-
lations, and statues, as well managing information security risks to business disruption.
Embed information security into business processes.
	n	
Blueprint the business processes and identify integration points in the business processes 
for information security to enhance the protection of data. Business processes that have 
information security as an attribute or component in their design and execution are less 
likely to fail and introduce risk to data leakage or loss.
Establish information security business relationship framework.
	n	
Establish a business relationship management framework for information security and 
the business. Introduce the role of Business Information Security Officer or Business 
Information Risk Manager as an advisory and consulting function to assist the business to 
meet their information security objectives, goals, and requirements.

CHAPTER 3
In constructing an information security organization, there are a number of 
items to be considered. For example:
	
n	 What are the key factors that determine how to build the organization?
	
n	 Who should security report to in executive leadership?
	
n	 Who has what responsibilities at each level of the security organization?
	
n	 How do we handle relationships with law enforcement, partners, and 
external organizations?
These and others are all very good questions and are, have been, and will con-
tinue to be argued over by almost teams tasked with assembling this type of 
organization.
KEY FACTORS IN DETERMINING THE ORGANIZATIONAL 
STRUCTURE
There are a number of key factors that need to be taken into account when 
trying to determine the best organizational structure for a given environment. 
We should be looking at the mission of the organization, the risk appetite of 
the business, the culture, the size of the business, the scope of responsibilities, 
and the budget that we have been given to work with. Other factors may exist, 
of course, depending on the environment, and some may not pertain to par-
ticular environments.

INFORMATION IN THIS CHAPTER:
Establish a Security Organization

46
CHAPTER 3: 
Establish a Security Organization
Mission
The mission of the security organization is, perhaps, the primary driving fac-
tor in how we structure it. The mission for our security team drives almost 
everything about how we develop the program. Does the team exist to meet 
compliance requirements and nothing beyond this? Does the team exist with 
the sole purpose of protecting customer or proprietary data and keeping us out 
of the news? Does the team exist to keep hackers representing the interests of 
foreign governments from stealing state secrets from a set of highly classified 
computer systems?
Our mission is the information security equivalent of the old existential ques-
tion ‘why are we here?’ Sorting out what exactly the mission of a security orga-
nization consists of can be a bit of a tricky proposition. In most cases, the 
answer will be that we need to keep the bad guys out of our systems so our 
information is not compromised, all the while making sure that we do not 
interfere with legitimate users in the process. Sorting out the particulars of 
what this means can be a valuable exercise and needs to be done with the input 
of the key stakeholders for the organization.
Risk Appetite
Risk appetite can very much influence our security organization. In very risk-
averse organizations, we are likely to put in a great deal more controls to mit-
igate cyber risk. Although not entirely, some large portion of these controls 
are likely to be technical in nature, thus incurring more technical costs and 
requiring a larger organization to support and administer them.
In an organization with a larger risk appetite, likely due to having a less critical 
or smaller set of information assets to protect, or due to outsourcing the host-
ing and management of such assets, we can get by with a smaller security staff.
For example, if we are performing security duties for a company that provides 
patient management solutions for chiropractic clinics, we might see this go 
either way. If we develop the software and host it and the data for the clinics in 
our own data centers, we might have a very low risk appetite. We need to ensure 
that the software performs in a security manner, that the platform is available 
for the customer, that the data are secure where stored, that the data center is 
physically secure, and any of a number of other issues.
On the other hand, if we were the same purveyor of patient management soft-
ware but did not develop the application ourselves and helped customers host 
it themselves in the cloud, then our risk appetite might be very different. We 
are not directly responsible for issues with the software, we are not hosting the 
data, and we do not need to worry directly about the security and availability 
of the data center. By transferring risk to the hosting provider, we have taken 
on a role of governance, not management, although we are still responsible for 

47
Key Factors in Determining the Organizational Structure
the capability, even though we do not directly own it. These two situations call 
for almost entirely different security organizational structures.
Culture
Company culture may be a large factor in developing a security organization. 
In a very authoritative culture, such as we might find in a government agency, 
we might need a very different organization than what we would find in a 
more open-minded and free-thinking organization, such as we might have in 
a company that developed free and open source software to give away for use 
in third-world countries.
In our example government agency, particularly if we were handling classified 
data, we might need a very large organization to run a large number of secu-
rity tools. In this case, we might need to take very heavy handed measures to 
ensure that none of our classified data walked out the door on a flash drive or 
went out over the internet, and that no malware snuck into our very carefully 
segmented environment. We might also need to staff more heavily for investi-
gations and compliance audits to ensure that we were following all of the rules 
laid down for us to safely and legally operate. For the most part, confidentiality 
is the big driver in this environment.
In our open source development organization, we might find an environment 
on the other extreme end of the spectrum. Here, we are more likely to find 
a number of users working from their homes and a smattering of all differ-
ent kinds of equipment present, running every conceivable operating system. 
Developers are likely to be collaborating with people in other organizations, 
and the intellectual property (IP) that we are working with is made to be given 
away. Without IP to protect or customer data to carefully safeguard, here we 
have a rather different focus. In this environment, we would need to worry 
more about protecting the availability of the systems and integrity of the source 
code for the projects more than anything else. The end points and the servers 
that hold the code would be the focus here and would require a smaller staff 
and set of tools than what we discussed earlier.
Size
The size of the organization and the number of assets that need to be secured 
can be a big driver for the structure of the security organization.
In a very small organization with few assets, we are very likely to find a team 
in the single digits with a jack-of-all-trades mentality among its members. In 
such small teams, we often cannot afford to fund an entire person to maintain 
a single technology or process. We are much more likely to see the case of each 
person on the team having at least a passing familiarity with each area and 
a much greater dependence on vendor support organizations when the time 
comes for very heavy lifting or to solve difficult problems.

48
CHAPTER 3: 
Establish a Security Organization
In a large organization with a correspondingly large number of assets, we will 
probably see a great deal of segmentation and stratification. One very common 
example of such segmentation is between security operations (often called just 
operations, or even ops) and the rest of information security. This is typically 
done to move the repeatable day-to-day tasks such as configuring access, ­updating 
antivirus or intrusion detection system definitions, and so on to a particular 
team. We may also see other functions split off into their own teams, such as 
compliance, vulnerability management and patching, engineering, architecture, 
security consulting, and incident response, just to name a few. Exactly what these 
divisions are will vary heavily from one organization to another, and often tends 
to happen organically and based on need and the skills available. We should put 
careful thought into size-based organizational structure changes, as making such 
changes rashly or hurriedly can be hard to recover from if they are wrong.
Budget
Budget can be a huge factor when determining organizational structure. If our 
budget dictates a miniscule security organization of a single person, the orga-
nizational structure may be a very straightforward single line reporting to man-
agement. In a very small or very new organization, this may be exactly what is 
needed. With a team on the small extreme end of the spectrum, costs are likely 
to be very low. Even if we choose to invest in training and appropriately equip-
ping our very small security team, which would be wise, the expense should be 
very low. This must map back to other factors such as risk appetite.
On the other hand, if we have a budget reaching into the hundreds of mil-
lions, we will likely have a bit more structure to go along with it. With such 
a large budget, we might assume a larger mission, as discussed earlier, and 
a correspondingly complex organization. In this case, we might have a chief 
information security officer (CISO), one or more layers of senior directors and 
directors, another few layers of senior managers and managers, and perhaps a 
layer of team leads under the managers. All of these employees will cost a great 
deal to support, train, maintain office space for, and so on, so it is important 
to take these items into consideration when planning out such a large set of 
Although a one-person security organization, or one staffed by volunteers or students, may 
seem ridiculous, it is important to remember that we should always structure and scale 
security to be appropriate to the organization and assets that we are protecting. If our 
organization is very small with an infrastructure entirely hosted in the cloud or in the case 
of open source software mentioned before, a single person may be appropriate to the risk.

teams. Along with the personnel, we need to make sure that roles and respon-
sibilities are clear and support integrated operations. Although someone like 
a Fortune 100 company could have a large staff, they must still strive to be 
effective and efficient.
WHERE SHOULD SECURITY REPORT?
In addition to the question of what the structure of the security organization 
should look like is the question of where the organization should report in the 
management structure. We might find security reporting through information 
technology (IT) or outside of it; through Operations; Governance, Risk, and 
Compliance (GRC); directly to a C-level security executive; or to any of a number 
of other places. The concern is, if security reports up through it, that they may not 
receive a fair share of resources. Additionally, if security reports through the chief 
executive officer (CEO) or chief financial officer (CFO), will these positions under-
stand and contribute to the security vision? There is no clear industry standard and 
this often comes down to culture and relationships within the organization.
Inside or Outside of IT
A large question in sorting out where to place the reporting for the security 
organization is whether it should report up through someone like the chief 
information officer (CIO) in the IT chain or not. On the surface, this does 
make a certain amount of sense. Information security is largely a technolo-
gy-oriented organization and works closely with IT to ensure that systems are 
built in a secure manner, patches are installed, vulnerabilities are compensated 
for, malware is discovered and cleaned, and a thousand other daily tasks. As 
the two functions are so closely paired, having them report through the same 
management can be very useful.
On the other hand, having the same reporting structure over both IT and 
information security can also bring with it a set of issues. In many cases, 
IT provides the platform for the business to be able to proffer its goods or 
services and is vital to conducting business. Additionally, although this is 
a somewhat myopic point of view, information security is often viewed as 
being obstructionist. Information security often insists on things being done 
a certain way to appropriately protect the information assets of the company. 
To those who are in a hurry or do not understand the need for security, this 
might seem heavy handed and unnecessary. Having these two viewpoints 
reporting to the same management can potentially lead to issues and might 
become a conflict of interest.
Another potential reason for having IT and information security report sep-
arately is for purposes of supporting segregation of duties. If we have the 

50
CHAPTER 3: 
Establish a Security Organization
same set of personnel, or even the same team (this is very common in small 
organizations) fulfilling both roles, we have a segregation of duties issue. 
Having the same personnel build the systems and then subsequently eval-
uate the security of how well this was done is likely to lead to issues in the 
long run.
Operations
One potential very interesting area to have information security report is to 
operations through the role of the COO. As the COO is responsible for the 
daily operations of the company, this can lead to a much better alignment 
between information security and the objectives of the business. In many 
cases, we see information security butting heads with the business functions 
as they try to carry out their task of running the company, generally with the 
goal of making money for organizations in the civilian world. It can be very 
frustrating for the business attempting to carry out its mission to be forced to 
fight with information security over every little task that it tries to accomplish 
in the name of success.
Having security report to the COO means not only that the business may 
have an easier task in accomplishing its goal, but also that the management 
of the business may be a little more security focused that we might expect 
with other structures.
The role of the CIO is changing and we could potentially see it go away entirely. We might see 
the chief operating officer (COO) could take over the CIO. The chief technology officer (CTO) 
could take on these duties or they could be split between other roles such as chief innovation 
officer, chief privacy officer, chief cloud officer, chief marketing officer, chief social media 
officer, chief security officer (CSO), chief risk officer (CRO), or any of a host of other more 
specialized positions.
NOTE
It is very important to remember when we are carrying out our jobs as security professionals 
that information security does not exist for its own sake. Security exists to protect the business 
so that it can safely and securely carry out its mission. It is counterproductive for security 
to hamper the business. If security comes to be seen as an obstruction to the business, 
the business will just stop asking the security function for advice before doing things. It is 
important when security is being consulted on a secure way to do something that we are 
careful not to say “no,” but rather, “yes, let’s find you a secure way of doing this.” Additionally, 
if security says no, the business will often find workarounds that are even more risky.
TIP

51
Where Should Security Report?
Governance, Risk, and Compliance
In some cases, we may see information security reporting through the GRC 
portion of the organization, usually through the role of the CRO, where such 
a position exists. Where in this mix information security might fall can vary 
from one structure to the next, with any of them being equally possible. This is 
much more likely to be the case in compliance-based organizations.
In most implementations, the GRC group is responsible for making sure that 
the overall parent organization is playing by the rules that have been set forth 
for it. This usually involves ensuring compliance with any of a number of 
requirements, audits, risk management, and so on. In short, GRC is the road 
that information security’s rubber is meeting.
The GRC function can be a bit of a two-edged sword to have security reporting 
through. It can be very useful in the sense of having access to the resources and 
data that this organization usually houses, in the sense of knowing where the 
security issues are likely to be found. Being able to go straight to some of the 
problems or anticipate them when implementing security controls can save a 
considerable amount of time and can lead to a greater level of efficiency.
On the other hand, having information security report to the piece of the orga-
nization that has some level of responsibility for ensuring that the company 
is operating within regulatory boundaries can lead to the two functions strug-
gling against each other to a certain extent. If the GRC function is very closely 
monitoring every activity of information security to ensure that it is carried out 
perfectly to specification and polished to a mirror shine, this may greatly slow 
down the rate at which projects and tasks are accomplished.
Direct Reporting
In recent years, it has become considerably more common for information 
security to have its own C-level executive to report to, who will report to the 
CEO of the company. This person, who may be referred to as the CSO or CISO, 
holds responsibility for the security of the organization and typically reports 
directly to the CEO.
In some cases we may see both a CSO and a CISO, with the CSO being in 
charge of security for the entire company, including physical security, product 
security, risk management, and any other security functions all rolling up to 
this position. In this case, the CISO might specifically be in charge of informa-
tion security and not necessarily the other security functions.
There are, unfortunately, no hard or fast rules for the use of CSO or CISO, so 
we are equally likely to see either or both of them used interchangeably, or one 
by itself in either type of position. This reflects on the relative immaturity of 

52
CHAPTER 3: 
Establish a Security Organization
information security as a function within organizations that these distinctions 
have not been codified.
There are certainly advantages to having the security organization report directly 
to its own management at the executive level. Such reporting can lead to better 
support for the security mission, as the CSO is directly focused on the security 
of the company and not on other tasks. This may also mean that security is not 
competing for funding or resources with other portions of the organization, at 
least not below the level of executive management. Additionally, this report-
ing structure can give security a more informed seat at the management table 
where decisions are being made about things that fall within its purview. In 
some cases, not having a security point of view at such discussions can lead to 
later issues in helping to protect the company.
Other Areas
In any given organization, we might find security reporting up through almost 
any path. As the formal structure of executive leadership will vary to a certain 
extent from one business to another, the location of security will likely vary as 
well.
A somewhat less common area for security to report through is the legal 
department. This does make a certain amount of sense as many issues that 
concern information security concern the legal department as well. If security 
is taking part in collecting information for a legal case, either in support of the 
prosecution or the defense, they will need to work very closely with legal. If an 
employee is being investigated for misconduct, if security questions are being 
asked by or of a third party that the company is planning to do business with, 
or any of a great number of other similar cases, security often ends up paired 
with someone from the legal team.
Another common set of reporting areas for security is to any of the other C-level 
executives, i.e., CFO, CTO, or any of a number of others. Whether this makes sense 
or not depends on the organization in question, but this is also very common.
Ability to Support Security
The most important issue, above and beyond the specific reporting structure of 
the security organization, is the ability to support the mission of information 
security. The particular area that security reports to may, and likely will, vary 
with industry, business focus, changes in management personnel, and a huge 
list of other factors. This determination will likely be made at the executive 
management level during the formation of the parent organization, or the for-
mation of the security organization.
To be effective, the information security function needs strong support in exec-
utive management, appropriate funding, skilled personnel, and a clear security

state goal and road map to get there. Although some reporting structures may 
be somewhat more or somewhat less of a help to getting things done, as long 
as security is able to be effective in its mission, any of the above-mentioned 
structures can be made to work.
RESPONSIBILITIES WITHIN SECURITY
Whether we are discussing areas that directly relate to information security, 
areas that make use of security, or those that are slated with governing how the 
security program runs, there are a number of segments of responsibility that 
govern the function. We may see these changes to a certain extent, influenced 
by the size and maturity of the organization, but we will generally find that the 
responsibility for management of the security function, risk, privacy, and data 
fit into the structure in some fashion.
Bigger Equals More Complex
As we discussed to a certain extent earlier in the chapter when talking about 
reporting structure, the bigger the organization is, the more complex its struc-
ture will necessarily be. What exactly “bigger” is may vary considerably, includ-
ing staff, budget, network, or any of a number of factors. Although it might be 
easy to look at this statement in simple terms and make a snap decision about 
running our security organization with minimal management, we will quickly 
run up against reality. A given person can only manage a limited number of 
direct reports effectively—this number is traditionally set at five. This limit is 
typically referred to as “span of control.”
When leaders’ span of control strays too far above five, they become much 
less effective due to lack of time to work on their tasks, and often end up 
working longer days. The number of management-level personnel, when 
reduced to math, should be somewhere nearing the total count of the 
organization divided by five. Although this may not apply to staffing in 
places like call centers, it is key when thinking about security analysts and 
engineers.
CISO/CSO/CIO/CFO/CEO—Relationships and Roles
The relationships between and among the various C-level executives that we 
might find in any given organization can be complex, but this is usually due 
Span of control, and the idea that direct reports should be limited to five, is an idea that dates 
back to at least the time of Napoleon [1].

to creativity with the organizational structure. Given a CEO, COO, CFO, CIO, 
CSO, and CISO, we will likely see a reporting structure that looks something 
like Fig. 3.1.
In the structure shown here, all C-level executives report directly to the CEO, 
with the exception of the CISO, who reports up through the CSO. As we might 
expect, the responsibility of the functions is as follows:
	
n	 CEO—maintains overall responsibility for the organization
	
n	 COO—responsible for operations
	
n	 CFO—responsible for financial aspects of the organization
	
n	 CIO—responsible for informational aspects of the organization 
(typically IT)
	
n	 CSO—responsible for all aspects of security
	
n	 CISO—responsible for information security specifically
Information Security Committee
The information security committee, sometimes referred to as a security steer-
ing committee, is typically composed of management that has a direct respon-
sibility for security and other key stakeholders. On such a committee, we might 
typically see the CISO and the management level below them, as well as rep-
resentatives from other security-oriented teams such as IT, compliance, audit, 
risk, legal, privacy, CTO, and physical security. Next we will see members of the

business that must accept the risk such as CFO, COO, lines of business owners, 
and sales. The makeup of the committee will vary heavily from one organiza-
tion to another based on the reporting structure.
The information security committee typically reviews metrics that are derived 
from the day-to-day operation of the security program and discusses large secu-
rity technology purchases and other such guidance for the security program. 
They can also serve as a source for helping to resolve issues and make decisions 
that need to be taken to a higher level of management.
Risk
In the information security world, management of risk is an area that can rest 
with a particular segment of the organization, often referred to as risk man-
agement, can be a responsibility divided among the organization, or can be 
a combination of these. Typically a security program will reach either a larger 
size or a greater level of maturity before a dedicated risk program begins to 
make sense.
The risk team, as we would expect, is responsible for addressing risk, as it 
pertains to information security. The primary vehicle of tracking risks and 
the remediation of them is the risk register, a concept that we will discuss 
at greater length in Chapter 5. The risk register provides us with a mecha-
nism to document risks as they are discovered, rank them according to their 
level of risk to the overall organization, track their present status, and report 
all of this to the information security committee and the leadership of the 
information security organization. It is where we track risk acceptance and 
remediation decisions.
Privacy
Privacy is a segment that may or may not be a part of information security. 
Depending on how the reporting structure is assembled, we might see this 
report up through security, directly up through the office of the CIO, GRC, risk, 
or the legal department. The privacy team exists to ensure that the organization 
is compliant with regulations and legal requirements for the protection of the 
information that we are handling in the course of conducting our daily busi-
ness. This might include customer data, employee data, or any of a number of 
other such items. Depending on the geographic area in which we are operat-
ing, there are a number of laws that cover how we protect these data, for exam-
ple, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [2] in the United 
States, the European Convention on Human Rights [3] covering most of the 
European countries, and numerous others. Within the United States, each state 
has its own privacy laws.

56
CHAPTER 3: 
Establish a Security Organization
Another, and unfortunately common, task that typically falls under the privacy 
organization is that of breach notifications. When a company suffers a breach 
that involves customer data, there are legal requirements for notifying custom-
ers whose data were involved in the breach in a timely manner.
Responsibility for Data
In addition to responsibility for the various components of the information 
security program and related functions, it is also important that we pay attention 
to the responsibility for the data on which our organizations function. From a 
data focus, we have data stewards, data owners, data custodians, and data users.
Data Steward
Data stewards are responsible for the overall management of the data and 
metadata that the organization is using. Typically, there will be a number of 
data stewards, each responsible for the data that pertains to a particular area, 
i.e., operations, IT, and security. Smaller organizations may only have a single 
data steward with responsibility for this effort across the entire company.
Data stewards will define the policies that govern the use of the data and meta-
data for which they are responsible and will also see to the implementation 
and execution of these policies. Additionally, they are responsible for making 
sure that the higher-level governance regarding the data and metadata under 
their responsibility is followed.
In the United States, the laws regarding breach notifications can vary heavily from one state to 
another. Companies that have suffered breaches may fall under the laws from multiple states 
depending on where they are headquartered, where they are operating from, and where their 
customers are located as well. It can be very important to consult legal counsel as soon as 
possible in the case of a breach to ensure that appropriate attention is paid to these issues. 
In the United States, the National Conference of State Legislatures maintains a list of breach 
notification laws by state [4].
WARNING
Metadata is data about data. If we look at a text file that contains minutes from a meeting, the 
actual content of the file is the data. The file size, time stamps noting when the file was last 
accessed and updated, the author of the content, and any of a number of similar items, are 
the metadata. For any given file type, the metadata may vary. For example, our text file might 
not have much metadata at all, but an audio or video file may contain metadata regarding 
the frequency, frame rate, equipment that created the recording, applications on which the 
file was edited, and much more. Different regulations define metadata and if it requires 
protections. Some regulations define an IP address as personally identifiable information.
NOTE

57
Relationships With External Organizations and Authorities
Data Custodian
Data custodians, sometimes also referred to as data managers, have direct con-
trol over granting access to the data for which they are responsible. They typ-
ically work directly with the data owners and data users to implement and 
manage access to the data and provide guidance and advice when new technol-
ogies or processes are being implemented that affect these functions.
Data custodians are often a part of the IT organization, sometimes operating 
as their own function within IT, or potentially as a part of another data focused 
team, such as database management or administration. Although this function 
does not generally report through information security, it is often responsible 
for ensuring that policies driven from information security are properly imple-
mented and followed.
Data Owner
Data owners are directly responsible for the lifecycle of the data, i.e., their cre-
ation, use, and deletion when no longer needed. Data owners have the author-
ity to grant or deny access to the data for which they are directly responsible, 
and also for ensuring the integrity of their data.
Additionally, data owners are key stakeholders in developing governance and 
the processes that implement it for their data. As the domain experts for the 
data in question, business owners should be the primary source of guidance on 
how the data should be used and maintained.
Data User
Data users are the customers of the data. Data users can be individuals or other 
organizations. The chief responsibility of the data users is to ensure that they 
store, process, and handle the data in a secure manner and work to maintain 
its integrity.
It is an unfortunate truth in the information security industry that users 
tend to be the weakest link in the security chain. There are many examples 
of users being careless with data and circumventing the carefully laid con-
trols that were put in place to make sure that it was kept secure. Planning 
out user level security can be a complex endeavor from both administrative 
and technical levels.
RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS AND 
AUTHORITIES
One important and often overlooked segment of the security organization 
is not really a part of the organization at all, to be technical about it. The 
outside organizations, agencies, vendors, and authorities with which we 

58
CHAPTER 3: 
Establish a Security Organization
interact in the execution of our daily duties can be every bit as much a part 
and parcel of our success as those in our direct employ. In the course of our 
information security duties, we are likely to work with others in our chosen 
industry (both information security and the industry in which our parent 
organization operates), auditors, law enforcement at various levels, and a 
host of others.
Industry
Relationships with other organizations operating in the same industry as we 
are can be very helpful when carrying out our duties as security profession-
als, whether these relationships are in the security industry, the industry in 
which our organization operates (retail, utilities, etc.), or a combination  
of both.
Other Organizations in the Same Industry
Relationships with others who operate in the same industry as we do can be 
very helpful, as they can provide us with a large amount of data that is both 
security program specific and specific to an environment that is very likely to 
be similar to ours in many ways. Other programs that have been developed 
to operate in industries that are the same as ours have likely been developed 
to a similar set of standards, compliance requirements, and issues as our 
own. This can be very helpful when evaluating new technologies, working 
to remediate issues, putting new pieces of program in place, or developing 
them further, and a great number of similar areas. In particular, if we have 
the opportunity to develop contacts at similar organizations that have more 
mature or further developed information security programs, this may afford 
us the opportunity to be “standing on the shoulders of giants” [5] and learn 
from the lessons and mistakes of those who have been down the same path 
before us.
Another benefit to working with others operating in the same industry is that 
we may be able to work with others to afford us all some additional layer 
of security from shared knowledge. To borrow from Benjamin Franklin, “We 
must, indeed, all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately” 
[6]. We can see examples, for instance, in the retail industry, where a number of 
security breaches at large retailers bore a striking set of similarities in the types 
of attacks used, specific malware used, and internal patterns of infrastructure 
organization. Closer cooperation among these companies may have alerted 
those attacked later to some indicators to look for in their environments a little 
sooner than what occurred. The potential downside of such sharing is that it 
might result in security issues being publicly revealed before we are ready to 
do so ourselves.

59
Relationships With External Organizations and Authorities
Industry Bodies
Although informal cooperation among those working in the same or similar 
industries can be beneficial, so can formal cooperation in the same avenues. 
With this specific idea in mind, a number of Information Sharing and Analysis 
Centers (ISACs) exist across multiple industries for the express purpose of 
sharing information centering on particular industries. ISACs exist for utility 
companies, finance, retail, aviation, defense, IT, and a great number of others. 
These can be a treasure trove of information regarding industry-specific issues 
and can also provide a forum to discuss things in a safe environment and net-
work with others of a similar focus. We will discuss ISACs to a greater extent 
in Chapter 5.
Auditors
Our relationships with auditors can be a bit of a two-edged sword. Auditors 
exist to point out where we are not compliant or not meeting standards, which 
is generally a poorly received message. Such audits, even when bearing news 
that is bad, or that we would rather not hear, can be of benefit to us in pointing 
out areas that we have opportunity for improvement. The worst sort of audit 
is the one that finds no problems for us to fix. This may mean that the auditor 
was not sufficiently thorough.
On the positive side, auditors can provide us with a list of areas in which we can 
improve our program and practices. This can be very helpful in making improve-
ments as it gives us some specific directions for improvement and, hopefully, 
some specific recommendations. An item of particular importance in many 
environments is that audit findings will generally be reported to some level 
of management over the security program. Although we might think that this 
would be a negative thing, and in some cases there might be a certain amount of 
negativity associated with such things, audit findings do two things for us. First, 
they get management attention on specific items that we might have trouble 
remediating otherwise. Management focus on issues can get us help in working 
with other teams and holding people accountable for getting the problems rec-
tified. Secondly, audit findings will often make getting funding to fix the issues 
a considerably easier task that we might otherwise have. Although there is a 
certain amount of weight attached to the security team asking for funds to fix 
a problem or enhance a technology, an audit finding is a different case entirely.
On the negative side, auditors have the potential to cause a great deal of trouble 
for the organization being audited. This does not always directly relate to issues 
that are found during the audit, although these have the potential to bite us if 
many such issues are found, but more often relates to the quality of the audit 
itself. If the audit is not performed diligently and to the set of standards upon 
which the organization should be working from, then the audit may be working  

60
CHAPTER 3: 
Establish a Security Organization
against improving the program, not for it. For example, if we are working from 
the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) standards for devel-
oping security programs and our auditors assess us against the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO) (yes, this acronym is out of order from 
what we would expect) 27000 series of standards for security programs, we will 
end up with differences in expectation for what the program looks like.
Lastly, it can also be of benefit for us to switch auditors occasionally, whether 
these are internal or external parties carrying out the audit. There is, arguably, 
some benefit to having an auditor who is familiar with the environment being 
audited; however, this can also grow to be a negative over time. When we are 
very familiar with a particular thing, and this is not something specific to 
audits, we begin to develop preconceptions about what it should or does look 
like, and may gloss over differences between what we expect to be there and 
what is actually there. This can lead to audits that do not benefit us greatly due 
to there being gaps between issues, or lack thereof, and what the environment 
actually looks like.
Law Enforcement and Government
Contact with various law enforcement agencies can be critical to the success 
of the security function. Some organizations may end up in the position of 
needing to work with local law enforcement for issues that involve a local and/
or physical component, federal law enforcement for cybercrimes in general or 
for larger scale issues, and international law enforcement for issues that span 
the borders of multiple countries.
Local
Building relationships with local law enforcement can be of great importance 
when dealing with security issues that have a local focus or local component. 
One unfortunately all too common occurrence of such a case where local law 
enforcement can be of help is the clandestine placement or use of skimming 
devices. Skimmers are generally devices that are physically placed in environ-
ments where credit cards are in use to capture the track data from the card being 
swiped and potentially the Personal Identification Number used with the card 
as well. As such devices are often wired or inserted into the payment terminal, 
they require physical placement, thus a potential need for bringing in local law 
enforcement to investigate or deal with the attacker on a physical level.
For more information on payment card skimmers, see the series by Brian Krebs on the subject 
[7]. There are a surprising number of ways that such devices are integrated into payment 
terminals in ways that are almost indistinguishable from the original equipment.
NOTE

61
Actions
Federal
Federal law enforcement involvement is frequent where there are investigations 
of cybercrime. In most US-based cases, the agency involved will be the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or in some cases, depending on the exact nature of 
the crime, the Secret Service.
One of the services that the FBI provides is its flash alert service, often found 
to contain alerts pertaining to current or upcoming cyberattacks, malware, 
botnets, and other similar activity. These alerts will often contain Indicators 
of Compromise, such as filenames, hashes, IP addresses, domain names, and 
other information that we can use to search our own enterprises for signs that 
we have been a victim of the particular attack or method discussed in the alert.
Additionally, federal law enforcement may have visibility to outside data or 
signs that a particular organization has come under attack without the organi-
zation’s own security measures being alerted. This is often information based 
on other ongoing investigations that the agency is working on, or data that 
they have collected as a result of observing such activity.
International
For issues that span the borders of multiple countries, we may need to recruit 
the assistance of international law enforcement agencies, or work with agen-
cies from multiple countries cooperating internationally.
Cases involving international issues can be very complex indeed, as the laws 
governing the types of issues that we are likely to be concerned with can vary 
widely from one country to another. What might be a very serious crime and 
accompanied by a very stiff set of consequences in one country may be com-
pletely legal and of no consequence whatsoever in another. Additionally, the 
issue of correctly attributing the origin of the attack to a particular geographic 
location and host system can complicate such engagements even further.
For most organizations, any international portion of an investigation where 
law enforcement is involved will be conducted through agency based in our 
local country. This is generally a good thing, as these agencies are trained in 
and familiar with such tasks.

CHAPTER 4
The translation of the information security program’s strategy and planning 
into organizational adoption is through the alignment of information security 
policy with the business goals. Any policy is an organizational statement of 
intent. Information systems security policies are designed to inform the mem-
bers of an organization of their obligatory responsibilities for protecting the 
information systems of their organization. Policies are adopted by a company 
as a statement of purpose, objectives, and roles and responsibilities. They are 
formally promulgated by the concurrence of company leadership. An informa-
tion security policy defines the objectives of the information security function 
and provides a high-level strategy toward achieving the stated objectives. An 
organization without business-aligned information security policies is likely 
to be a fragmented collection of standards, guidelines, and procedures that 
indiscriminately addresses a holistic practice of information security.
ALIGN INFORMATION SECURITY POLICIES TO THE 
ORGANIZATIONAL PROFILE
An information systems security policy and subordinate standards, guidelines, 
and procedures integrate the many different aspects of an enterprise informa-
tion security program to achieve business objectives. An enforceable written 
policy helps ensure that everyone within the organization coherently behaves 
in an acceptable manner with respect to information security. Information 
security policies provide a framework for the business that can be followed 
by all employees. Policies will help to define and categorize information as an 
asset, inform the employees on their responsibilities to protect these important

Why Information Security Policies?
assets from unauthorized access, modification, disclosure, and destruction, 
and how to respond and report to policy violations.
Information security policies are also useful beyond the purpose of protecting 
company information assets. It is essential for companies to be able to demon-
strate compliance with current regulations and legislation. Information security 
policies can assist the company in demonstrating its compliance requirements 
to regulatory, legal, and even contractual requirements. In many market indus-
tries, companies are required to show compliance with regulatory or legal frame-
works that govern their participation in a particular industry or business process. 
Legal requirements surrounding Sarbanes Oxley (SOX), Gramm-Leach-Bliley 
Act, Payment Card Industry (PCI), and Health Insurance Accountability and 
Portability Act (HIPAA) require companies to have specific protection in place, 
which start from simple policy statements surrounding the requirement. Policy 
support compliance by mapping the policy to operational or technical stan-
dards, guidelines, and procedures to ensure the requisite controls are in place.
Policy is important in large complex enterprises to set expectations of all busi-
ness entities and their associated information technology (IT) departments. It 
should reflect the generally accepted principles and best practices that should 
be adopted across geographic and organizational boundaries. This is particu-
larly relevant where corporate culture toward security may not be uniform due 
to cultural difference and the need to set expectations of behavior that might 
not be inherent in these segments.
Policies can also introduce technology initiatives and drive more securi-
ty-aligned technology adoption when those policies become translated into 
technical requirements. Policies can be the engine of change by outlining the 
secure deployment and implementation of emerging technology and its busi-
ness use. For example, the introduction of a new cloud-based storage solution 
or Bring-Your-Own-Device initiative will require certain new behaviors with 
technology, and a support information security policy will drive the secure 
adoption through why and how adoption will be achieved. An effective secu-
rity policy should fulfill many purposes. It should:
	
n	 define information as a company asset;
	
n	 underscore the importance of information as an asset;
	
n	 set the rules of behavior in handling the information asset;
	
n	 describe how to report a suspected policy violation;
	
n	 articulate the consequences of policy violations;
	
n	 authorize the investigation of policy violations.
TYPES OF INFORMATION SECURITY POLICIES
Policies are generally organized in a top-down hierarchy that is defined by 
the company’s leadership for proper governance. An umbrella organizational 

65
Types of Information Security Policies
policy is the highest statement of policy; any subordinate policies will be addi-
tional levels of granularity to the detailed configuration of specific technology, 
yet traceable to the higher level policy.
Organizational Policy
An organizational or institutional policy details the purpose, ownership, roles 
and responsibilities, and related documents or related policies. The organiza-
tional policy is often the highest level policy statement from which all other 
polices, standards, guidelines, or procedures draw their legitimacy. As a writ-
ten policy, it should be mandatory and reflect management’s requirements for 
organizational behavior. It should not be laced with language about a specific 
technology or vendor product, but agnostic to how the policy objective is met.
Standards
An information security standard describes the implementation and manage-
ment of information security controls. A standard provides an information 
security control to meet required specifications, including those for meet-
ing specific industries or regulatory compliance objectives. There are several 
well-recognized standards frameworks.
	
n	 The Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology 
(COBIT). COBIT is a framework developed in by the Information 
Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA), an independent 
organization of IT governance professionals. COBIT originally focused 
on reducing technical risks in organizations, but has evolved with each 
successive version to include alignment of IT with business-strategic 
goals. It is the most commonly used framework to achieve compliance 
with SOX rules.
	
n	 The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27000 
Information Security Management. The ISO 27000:2013 series provides 
a very robust information security framework for any industry. Rooted 
in the earlier British Standards Institution (BSI) Standard 17799, it is 
often referred to as the information security version of ISO 9000 quality 
standard. ISO 27000 is further decomposed into several substandards 
based on the content. For example, ISO 27000 provides a description 
of the standard, ISO 27001 defines the program requirements, and 
ISO 27,002 defines the operational information security program 
requirements.
	
n	 The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special 
Publication 800. NIST SP 800 series provides general and specific 
guidance on nearly all aspects of information security. NIST SP 800-53 
is model framework that US government agencies and suppliers use 
to comply with the Federal requirements. Even though it is specific 
to government agencies, the NIST framework could be applied in any 

66
CHAPTER 4: 
Why Information Security Policies?
other industry and should not be overlooked by companies looking to 
build an information security program.
These frameworks also share multiple security or compliance objectives that 
are synergistic or allow the control to meet all frameworks’ intent. For exam-
ple, COBIT, ISO2002, and NIST 800-53 all define the necessity of a security 
policy; developing a security policy can fulfill multiple frameworks and stan-
dards if properly crosswalked and normalized to meet the common objective. 
This equally facilitates a “test once, comply many” audit or inspection process 
where the company needs to meet multiple legal or regulatory requirements 
due to its participation in multiple industries. There are several common stan-
dards that companies should evaluate as the basis for its standards framework.
Procedures
Procedures consist of step-by-step instructions to assist workers in implement-
ing the various policies, standards, and guidelines. A procedure is the specific 
step-by-step instructions to properly operate a control or execute a process. 
A procedure could be a written instruction on how to configure auditing on 
a server, run a vulnerability scanner, or implement a firewall rule. A process 
may also be defined through the use of a desktop procedure, such as how 
to triage a security event. For procedures, the information security team has 
the option of not creating the procedures themselves, but adopting commonly 
recognized standard configurations. The benefit of using prepared standard 
configuration procedures or standards is that the effort to research test and 
document the procedure is borne by the originating authors. Secondly, these 
common configurations are template for use in automated configuration or 
compliance management tools to allow validation. The disadvantage is that, 
although standardized, the company’s specific technology deployment may 
require deviations that need to be documented and accommodated. Some 
popular standardized configuration procedures are those developed by the 
National Security Agency Central Security Service, NIST, Center for Internet 
Security, and others.
Guidelines
Guidelines consist of recommendations that may support a policy or stan-
dard. Guidelines are related to information security best practices that sup-
port a policy or standard. For example, a policy may direct that employees 
must report security violations to a centralized mailbox or operations center’s 
internal phone number. The supporting guidelines may be a list of important 
information that would support the report (i.e., when did it occur, who was 
involved, computers affected). For example, standard may dictate the use of 
encryption for sensitive information. The companion guideline may be what 
types of information should be encrypted.

Information Security Policy Governance and Management
Checklists
A checklist is used to validate or confirm certain conditions or configurations 
associated with the security policy or standard. The checklist is used, often by 
IT or security staff, to validate that a condition or configuration is correctly 
implemented. For example, a system administrator may use a checklist to set 
up logging for a server, set permissions, or assign rights. Each configuration is 
validated on the checklist as being properly set and secure. A second example 
is the use of checklist during inspections or assessments. The auditor will use 
the checklist to note conformance or nonconformance with a specific policy 
or checklist.
INFORMATION SECURITY POLICY GOVERNANCE AND 
MANAGEMENT
Information Security Policy Governance
Many organizations and companies have a policy management framework 
that defines the process of how to promulgate a corporate policy or standard. It 
defines the purpose of policy and policy types, describes how to determine and 
assign policy ownership, guidance on policy development, the process of sub-
mitting a policy for promulgation (adoption), the communication of policy to 
the organization, and the review process to ensure currency. In most compa-
nies, the policy management function is centrally managed by the corporate 
home office. It is important for the security leadership to understand the pol-
icy management process to effectively craft, submit, and manage their policy 
inventory. For general IT policies, some information management functions 
centrally manage all IT policies related to the delivery of IT to the company. 
Each IT organization—Application, Infrastructure, and Information Security—
should take ownership of a set of relevant policy, standards, or procedures 
related to the delivery of its particular service area.
Information Security Policy Management
Policy management is a continuous cycle of development, publication, main-
tenance, and retirement. Companies require a well-defined and organized 
approach to manage the life cycle that ensures information security policies 
are created and approved.
Policy Development
It is critical to select who is going to be involved in the development phase 
as early as possible. Ideally, the team or individual who develops the policy 
should ideally also be the process or technology owner and responsible for 
setting expectations for policy enforcement once promulgated. For informa-
tion security policies, it will most likely be the information security function. 

68
CHAPTER 4: 
Why Information Security Policies?
The membership of the policy development team will vary depending on the 
scope, scale, and complexity of the policy topic or subject. For a policy that is 
narrow in scope and targeted toward a particular process, technology, or pop-
ulation, the policy development team may be small or a single individual. For 
those policies that are long reaching with large scope, a multifunctional policy 
development team may be more appropriate. The following roles should be 
involved:
	
n	 Information Security Leader or Focal Point. Since the information 
security policy is an information security initiative, it is expected that a 
leader or focal point be designated to manage the development phase 
up to final promulgation. Overall responsibility may be assigned to a 
key person with the other development team members in a supporting 
role. This focal point will guide each policy through development and 
subsequent revisions. Managing the development phase as a project, 
it is the focal point’s responsibility to set the tasks, schedule, and 
resources necessary to successfully deliver the policy document.
	
n	 Subject Matter Experts. The policy development team will most likely 
be staffed by subject matter experts in the topic or subject of the policy. 
It is most likely that subject matter experts will be drawn from the 
information security team. In addition to the information security team, 
the policy development team may need the expertise of other IT staff 
who have specific technical knowledge in the subject domain. These 
experts should be familiar with the technology or process associated 
with the policy. They can provide good insight if the policy is actually 
reasonable, feasible, and enforceable.
	
n	 Legal Counsel. The Office of General Counsel, or similar function, 
should review the policy at a logical point of the development process, 
often as it approaches final draft. Legal counsel can provide advice on 
the policy applicability or conflict with any legal or regulatory statutes 
or rules. The privacy function often resides in the legal department and 
the privacy officer will need to review for any conflicts with privacy 
concerns. Lastly, the general counsel may provide input to the feasibility 
of enforcement if any policy violations occur.
	
n	 Internal Controls and Audit. The Internal Audit and Internal Controls 
departments should review the policy for consistency with the general 
control and audit framework (e.g., SOX) for the company. Internal 
controls department should be consulted on the coherence of the policy 
with other controls as a best practice. Internal audit will provide good 
feedback on the ability to monitor and audit the policy in terms of their 
audit procedures.
	
n	 Human Resources. Many information security policies are employee 
centric on what is and what is not acceptable behavior or use of 

69
Information Security Policy Governance and Management
IT. Human Resources (HR) department may need to review the 
information security policy for coherence and consistency with other 
HR policies that are security-related. They will also examine the policy 
for the ability to enforce and what would be the general consequences 
for policy violations. The information security focal point or team 
should be able to communicate the gravity or impact of not adhering to 
the policy so as to determine if the violation may be considered ground 
for termination.
	
n	 Technical Writer. A technical writer can be useful in determining the 
appropriate structure, style, and format for the policy. Although some 
information security departments may have a technical writer in their 
group, more often than not, a technical writer will be sourced from 
a general pool of technical support staff as a shared resource. In even 
smaller companies, this resource may not be available and left to the 
information security team to both author and edit the draft policy. The 
technical writer can help organize the policy, edit the various drafts, 
and proofread the initial policy for spelling or grammar errors. An 
additional benefit is that, if the technical writer has experience writing 
company policies, he or she can jump-start the policy creation through 
their familiarity with style, as well as the process to get a policy at the 
level of acceptability that management is accustomed to. It is important 
to adopt the corporate style guide to make them publishable. If one 
exists, it should be used to ensure policies have the same look and feel 
as other corporate policies, avoid rewrites, and help them to be more 
quickly accepted as corporate documents.
	
n	 Business Partner Representatives. At a certain point of creating the 
policy, it is useful to test the policy for acceptability and receptiveness 
with a business representative. A business partner can provide feedback 
to the policy development team on issue such as language, prose, and 
style. Technical staff tend to talk in dry technical terms; the business 
representative can help the team adapt the intent and content in 
business terms that are more recognizable than technical jargon. If 
employees cannot understand the policy, they are less likely to follow 
it. Also, for global companies, a business representative from each 
region may be required to review the policy in the native language 
in which it is deployed. The team should not rely exclusively on 
contracted translation services, but use business representative to vet 
and even correct inaccurate translations. Where a current information 
security policy is being reviewed or updated, testing with a business 
representative helps determine the success of a policy’s intent. This 
will help indicate whether an update or revision is required. This is 
particularly meaningful where policies have been in place for several 
years and in danger of becoming irrelevant.

70
CHAPTER 4: 
Why Information Security Policies?
Once the team is identified, the hard part of policy development is the drafting 
of the policy. There are three key considerations in the drafting of the policy: 
maintain the purpose and scope of the policy, identify the audience and ensure 
applicability, write the policy at the correct level or detail necessary, and iden-
tify any exception conditions and process for attaining an exception.
It is important to maintain the purpose and scope of the policy during its development. A 
policy does not create itself; there was a need or requirement, either based on operational 
need, to meet a regulatory requirement, or even threat-driven. The policy development team 
should constantly guard itself from dragging irrelevant side issues into the policy or attempt 
to cover multiple issues or reasons into a single policy. In either case, the danger is that the 
policy becomes unclear or obtuse; the reader may become confused exactly what the policy 
is attempting to address or what actions he or she should take to be compliant with the 
policy. The method to ensure scope and focus is to be laser focused on the intent and ensure 
it is singularly related to the expected behavior. For example, rather than articulating the 
employees’ responsibility and use of technology buried deep in a single policy as a section or 
paragraph, it is advised that a single acceptable use policy would be more appropriate. This 
way, the employee does not have to read a long policy to find what their responsibilities are, a 
single focused policy is more easily referenced, and, for management, enforced.
TIP
The general audience of the policy is the employee population, but there may 
be particular or specific group that the policy is intended for. The audience may 
be subcategorized as management, technical staff, and end users. Establishing 
an information security policy is very much an issue of corporate culture. 
Each one of these target audiences are affected by the policy in different ways. 
Managers not only are required to follow the policy themselves, but also are 
expected to enforce the policy as part of their managerial duties and respon-
sibilities. Technical staff are expected to translate the policy into functional 
processes or automated controls, or a mix of both. The end user population is 
expected to follow the policies that are most relevant or directed toward their 
behavior with technology.
The degree of detail and length is typically dependent on the type of policy and 
target audience. Organizational policies should be written at a high enough 
level that are enduring and do not require frequent changes. Policies should 
be universal enough to accommodate organizational changes such as mergers, 
acquisitions, and divestitures with little need to update or modify the policies 
outside of scheduled reviews. Organizational policies should be only two to 
three pages in length—who is responsible for what—with a corporate officer or 
other appropriate senior manager signing off on the policy to give it the proper 
authority. Policies may also refer to the subordinate standards, procedures, or 

71
Information Security Policy Governance and Management
guidelines associated with the high-level policy. Standards, as more detailed 
forms of policy, are often operational or technical requirements, such as con-
trols or control objectives. Policies that combine high-level statements of intent 
with detailed standards result in a complex document that may create problems 
with employee receptiveness and understanding, as well as issues when third 
parties, such as customers, that require the company to disclose policies. These 
requests result in the company having to produce more information than it is 
comfortable with disclosing. It is a best practice to limit the detail in high-level 
policies and let the subordinate policy types, such as standards or procedures, 
carry the additional detail on how the policy is being implemented.
Company information systems security policies need to be easily understood 
and practical to be effective. When writing the policy, it is equally import-
ant to set the correct tone for making the policy palatable and increase the 
chances of receptiveness. A draconian, harsh policy may alienate the employee 
population and increase the potential for nonadherence. An inappropriately 
weak-worded policy will simply cause benign neglect. Employee acceptance 
is dependent on the policy’s ability to link the benefit of following policy to 
information systems security. A clear, concise, coherent, and consistent policy 
that sets expectations is more likely to be followed. This is where the techni-
cal writer and business representative reviews become critical in the develop-
ment of the policy. They ensure that the information security policy does not 
become excessively technical or steeped in the jargon of information security. 
A good policy should be understandable to the general employee population.
Information systems security policies should provide the conditions for excep-
tions, when appropriate. An acceptable policy contains policy statements, but 
also should refer to the process of how exceptions can be granted. This ensures 
that the company policy is clearly stated and enforced, while providing a mech-
anism for dealing with exceptions without weakening the policy. Employees 
who are faced with a compliance challenge will have a choice to ignore the 
policy altogether. Without an exception clause in the policy, the employee may 
simply default to ignoring it.
Lastly, a compliance “grace period” is recommended by the policy develop-
ment team. Companies do not issue policies and become compliant overnight. 
A grace period provides an acceptable period of time until when compliance 
can be measured. The IT department and business policies can review them, 
communicate the policy, implement them where applicable, and validate 
them for effectiveness prior to formal inspection. It is also a good practice to 
­coordinate the grace period with Internal Audit during policy development 
how soon they anticipate auditing the policy after publication. Depending on 
the scope, scale, and impact of the policy, and the size of the company, a grace 
period may typically span several months up to 1 year.

72
CHAPTER 4: 
Why Information Security Policies?
Policy Publication
Once the policy is ready for review, it will follow the established governance 
process and be distributed to the companion IT departments for their review 
and concurrence. Once the IT department is satisfied with the policy in a final-
ized version, it is submitted to the centralized policy management group. 
The policy manager group then staffs the policy with the relevant corporate 
functions and business leadership representatives. The corporate functions  
(e.g., HR, Legal, Audit) may simply ask who was involved in the drafting of 
the policy and then confer with the appropriate development team member 
if there are any issues or criticisms. As the representative was part of the orig-
inal authors, this is a relatively short conversation. However, some corporate 
functions may assign an independent reviewer who was not on the original 
development team to test for conformance. Similar to the corporate function 
review, the business leadership may quickly approve the policy if the develop-
ment team included business partner participation. If not, then the business 
leadership review will entail a more detailed review to gain their approval. The 
business leadership has an equally valid reason for conducting such a detailed 
review—a policy that is either generally not acceptable to the business or lacks 
business support is a policy that will not be easily adopted or enforced. Once 
the policy management team has completed the socialization and staffing of 
the proposed policy, the document can be deemed ready for formal release.
Once formally accepted and promulgated, as documents, polices should be 
electronically published so that they are easily accessible to all employees. 
Large companies will have an organized policy repository on their company 
intranet available for download, printing, and saving. Typically, the informa-
tion security function’s intranet site will also link to these repositories. For 
those smaller organizations or companies, the information security function 
may host their policies on their own internal site.
The next step in publication is to communicate the policy. An effective policy 
communication strategy will ensure that all targeted audiences are aware of new 
or updated security policies, know where to find them, and understand how to 
comply with them and the consequences of nonadherence. However, the decision 
becomes should the policy be communicated to the entire employee population 
or a subset of those employees most affected by the policy. Large companies strug-
gle with how to communicate policies, but for information security policies, the 
communication approach should be a tailored communication strategy approach 
such that the targeted employee population or group would receive directly only 
those policies needed. For example, corporate functions receive policy commu-
nication relative to the business process they govern or oversee. Technical staff 
would receive communication on those policies, standards, and procedures rele-
vant to their area of technology management. The employees receive communi-
cations about their responsibilities to protect information assets.

73
Information Security Policy Governance and Management
Policy Management
All information security policies should be reviewed and updated regularly. An 
annual review ensures the policy stays current, relevant, and up to date. Ad hoc 
updates may be necessary when a significant fundamental change in technol-
ogy, process, or organizational realignment affects the relevancy or applicabil-
ity of the existing policy, or parts of them. The review process should follow 
the initial development process as a matter of process integrity. However, the 
review may be significantly shorter if the policy does not require major updates 
or changes.
There are two important aspects that should be considered in the policy review. 
First, input from those most affected by the policy should be surveyed on the 
acceptance and efficacy of the policy. Business representatives, either as mem-
bers of the original policy development team or independent of that effort, 
should be asked if the policy has made the desired effect based on intent. 
Technical staff should be interviewed on the experience of working with the 
existing policy; this can identify the technical difficulty, cost, or complexity of 
actual implementation and maintenance. Feedback will be useful to identify 
any necessary tailoring or adjustments that would make the policy more effec-
tive relative to the intent.
A second aspect is the identification of frequent audit nonconformance or 
security violations or that occurred over the life of the policy. Audit nonconfor-
mance information will identify where the policy was difficult to implement 
or enforce. Frequent policy violations that resulted in security events should be 
particularly noted. This information is an important indicator that the policy 
has some issues with its effectiveness. It may be that the policy is not feasible 
or capable to meet the original intent or may indicate that there are some 
simple adjustments that need to be made to refine the policy’s implementa-
tion. While tuning the policy to make it more effective, the information secu-
rity team should guard from watering down the policy’s intent. Changing an 
effective policy to an ineffective policy, just to suit a particular need to reduce 
violations, only creates bad policy.
An effective manner of communicating information security policy is through the establishment 
of annual security education and awareness training. Most organizations use the common 
learning platform to host mandatory annual training on information security where policies 
are communicated to all employees. The additional benefit of annual security education 
and awareness training is that many compliance requirements, such as PCI or HIPAA, also 
require annual training. Annual training can be the most effective and economical manner of 
communicating all information security policy requirements.
TIP

74
CHAPTER 4: 
Why Information Security Policies?
Once the review process is completed, the results should be documented in the 
policy itself, usually a revision and change section of the policy document. The 
aggregate decisions to update, retire, or keep the same policy in place should also 
be documented in some form, usually in the review team’s meeting minutes. 
Then the same steps followed in the initial policy publication and communi-
cation should be followed for consistency. However, it may be much more sim-
plified as a simple email to the targeted audiences; if there were no changes, the 
policy management team may decide a formal notification is unnecessary.
Policy Retirement
With the speed and changing landscape of technology, policies eventually 
become outdated or irrelevant. During a policy review, it is possible that the 
review team and stakeholders have arrived at a decision for whatever reason 
that the policy is no longer relevant and should be retired. However, once the 
policy has been identified as needing to be retired, the process is not to simply 
delete the policy document from the policy repository. A retirement process 
should involve a record of decision to retire, usually in the policy review team’s 
meeting minutes. The policy itself should have a record of its retirement in 
the revision and change section of the policy document. The communication 
of the policy retirement should be made to the proper target audiences, and 
lastly, wherever polices are stored and listed, it may be appropriate to annotate 
“retired” next to the policy title.
SUMMARY
A well-designed information security policy framework outlines and defines 
the objectives of the organization’s information protection strategy and 
delivers a stated approach to achieve these objectives. An information system 
without security policies is more likely to be a disjoint collection of state-
ments, controls, and procedures that may not meet the information security 
protection objectives. Business aligned and relevant information security 
policies, then, can often be used to help integrate the multiple aspects of an 
enterprise information security program to achieve business objectives.
ACTIONS
 
Assess and align information security to the organization’s culture.
	n	
Identify the key elements of the organizational business model, structure, and culture. 
Aligning security as a “value add” in maintaining compliance to external and internal poli-
cies, regulations and statues, as well managing information security risks to  
business disruption.

75
Actions
Gain management commitment to information security policy intent.
	n	
Management commitment to security is essential to promote the importance of the infor-
mation security policy, if not the most important factor in its adoption. Without manage-
ment support, their employees are less likely to follow the policy. Management support of 
information security policies provides the visibility and importance with their subordinate 
manager and employees. The best time to obtain visibility for information security policy 
conformance is at the initial publication and when a violation occurs. Management empha-
sis on the importance of conforming to policy and the consequences of a violation has the 
effect of applying pressure to motivate all employees toward compliance. Management can 
drive adoption by championing the resulting policies and putting their weight behind them 
through leading by example.
Ensure that the information security policies are relevant.
	n	
Policies must be realistic, relevant, and appropriate. Once employees understand that the 
information security policy helps them in their daily work activities to protect themselves 
and the company information assets, they are much more likely to be receptive to be com-
pliant. Likewise, when management realizes that the information security policy is leverage 
to ensure adherence to legal or contractual requirements, managers are much more likely 
to be supportive in providing resources for policy development and more inclined to become 
policy champions themselves.
Maintain the currency of the information security policies.
	n	
All companies need to periodically review their information security policies. Failure to con-
duct periodic reviews will cause the policies to become outdated and lapse into obsolesce. 
Similar to relevancy, employees will simply ignore or disregard policy requirements and, as 
unrealistic and obsolete, become unenforceable. Beyond periodic reviews, an alternative is 
to specify a defined review cycle more frequent than the annual review. By specifying a more 
frequent review cycle, the policy has less opportunity to become stale.
Deliver information security policies that carry weight.
	n	
Information security teams worry that the policies that took an incredible amount of time to 
formulate, socialize, and publish are not taken seriously. This is a common fear for  
those information security teams that are new to the policy development practice or 
where a policy management process is absent. This is where effective communication and 
management commitment come into play. Effective communication ensures that employ-
ees understand the intent and importance of the policy to protect information assets. 
Management commitment, as described earlier, enforces the importance of the security 
policy to the employees, as well as the consequences of nonconformance. If both are pres-
ent, employees will understand that these policies are not trivial and carry enough weight to 
adopt the proper behaviors.

CHAPTER 5
DEVELOP A RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK
One of the first objectives in risk management is to decide on what we will 
use for a framework or, perhaps, to develop one of our own. We need a frame-
work to develop discipline and structure and to ensure integration with the 
system development life cycle (SDLC). There are a great many frameworks 
that we can make use of, with some of the most used being those from the 
National Institute for Science and Technology (NIST) and the International 
Organization for Standardization (ISO).
Why We Need a Framework
Proceeding off on our risk management journey is a bit akin to heading off on 
a road trip into unfamiliar territory with no map or Global Positioning System. 
	n	 Develop a risk management framework
	n	 Evaluate objectives for risk management
	n	 Responding to the results of risk assessments
	n	 Communicating risk to the business
	n	 Risk management and controls
	n	 Gaining management buy in
	n	 Actions
INFORMATION IN THIS CHAPTER:
Manage the Risks
The sharp-eyed reader may have noticed that the International Organization for Standardization 
does not fit well with ISO. ISO, in fact, is not an acronym at all, but is named for the Greek 
word “isos,” which means equal. If ISO was an acronym, it would need to be changed for each 
language in which it was used, as the words would not always be used in the same order. This 
would not be very supportive of the mission for international standards.
NOTE

78
CHAPTER 5: 
Manage the Risks
We might get there eventually, but it will not be an efficient or effective route 
for our journey.
Discipline and Structure
A framework provides us with discipline and structure for our program. It 
ensures that our risk management efforts are both consistent and repeatable. It 
ensures we will cover what we need as it has been through industry-wide peer 
review. If we cannot hand our framework to two different people and get gen-
erally the same results back from them, then we have more work to do on it.
A framework also aids us in documenting our efforts. If we do not follow a 
consistent path through risk management, then when we try to look back at 
historical data it will be very hard to assemble any sort of a coherent picture as 
we will be all over the map. This documentation is key when later we must deal 
with audits or compliance.
A key area we need to build our frameworks around is development of 
new capabilities or applications. As we look at how code is developed into 
capabilities it is important to remember that if security is not designed in 
at the beginning it will be both more expensive and less effective to add at 
the end.
SDLC Integration
Our risk management program and information security program should inte-
grate closely with the SDLC. This integration will help to ensure that, as sys-
tems are built according to the SDLC, we have quantified and set a direction 
for handling any risks that are identified, which also plays very nicely into the 
information security program.
If we use the NIST definitions for both the risk management:
	
n	 Categorize
	
n	 Select
	
n	 Implement
	
n	 Assess
	
n	 Authorize
	
n	 Monitor
and the SDLC:
	
n	 Initiate
	
n	 Design
	
n	 Implement
	
n	 Operations and maintenance
	
n	 Dispose

79
Develop a Risk Management Framework
cycles, we can see, as in Fig. 5.1, how they can fit very nicely together.
When used in conjunction, these two processes pair up sets of activities well. 
When we are initiating our system, we are also categorizing it to enable later 
risk activities. When we are designing the system, we are also selecting the secu-
rity controls that go into it. When we are implementing the system, we are 
also implementing the required controls, assessing their implementation and 
use, and authorizing the system. In the operations and maintenance phase, we 
monitor the controls in place on an ongoing basis.
An additional step, not covered in the risk management phases for NIST but 
covered in the SDLC steps, is disposal. We should, from a risk management 
perspective, be matching up disposal of obsolete controls with the disposal 
phase of the SDLC.
Choosing an Existing Framework
Given the wide variety of risk management frameworks available, in most 
cases it will be advisable to use one of the existing selections. Among the com-
monly used are NIST, ISO, and, in the case of certain federal systems, Federal 
Information Processing Standard (FIPS). Many organizations will end up using 
one or more of these as a basis, where appropriate. Several of these overlap in a 
complementary fashion and are by no means exclusive of each other. Although 
the ISO standards tend more in the direction of a checklist, NIST offers more of 
a practical set of implementation guides.
National Institute for Science and Technology
The NIST Special Publication provides guidance for a great many areas 
of computing and technology, including risk management. The two 
main publications in this area are SP 800-37 “Guide for Applying the 
Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems” and SP  
800-53 “Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems and 
Organizations.”

CHAPTER 5: 
Manage the Risks
SP 800-37 lays out the risk management framework, the six steps that are the 
basis for many risk management programs:
	
n	 Categorize—Categorize the system based on the information that it 
handles and the impact of exposing or losing such data.
	
n	 Select—Select controls based on the categorization and any extenuating 
circumstances.
	
n	 Implement—Implement the controls and document the implementation.
	
n	 Assess—Assess the controls to ensure that they are implemented 
properly and performing as expected.
	
n	 Authorize—Authorize the use of the system based on the risk and the 
controls implemented to mitigate it.
	
n	 Monitor—Monitor the controls to ensure that they continue to 
appropriately mitigate risk.
SP 800-53 serves to provide control information for those who are selecting 
controls using SP 800-37 as a basis.
International Organization for Standardization
The ISO is a body first created in 1926 to set standards between nations. 
Among the over 21,000 standards that they have created are standards “cover-
ing almost every industry, from technology, to food safety, to agriculture and 
healthcare” [1].
In the case of risk management, ISO 31000:2009 “Risk Management - Principles 
and Guidelines” is the ISO standard governing this area. This standard “pro-
vides principles, framework and a process for managing risk” [2]. Although the 
NIST and FIPS documents are very much aimed at federal information systems, 
the ISO standard is intended for as broad as possible an audience.
Additionally, ISO Guide 73:2009 “Risk management – Vocabulary” works well 
with ISO 31000 by providing a standardized vocabulary for such efforts, and 
31010:2009 “Risk management – Risk Assessment Techniques” focuses on the 
risk assessment process.
Federal Information Processing Standard
NIST maintains a series of publications, the FIPS documents. One of the direc-
tives of NIST, mandated by the Federal Information Security Management Act 
(FISMA) is to develop implementation guidance for federal information sys-
tems. At a federal system level, some of the NIST publications have the power 
of federal mandates.
The FIPS publications cover a wide area, but two in particular, FIPS 199 and 
FIPS 200, both mandatory standards, which are related to risk management 
frameworks.

81
Evaluate Objectives for Risk Management
FIPS 199 “Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and 
Information Systems” defines the categories of information systems to be used 
by the federal government. The categorization requirements under FIPS 199 
include rating each system according to the confidentiality, integrity, and avail-
ability (CIA) triad.
FIPS 200 “Minimum Security Requirements for Federal Information and 
Information Systems” defines the minimum standards for security of federal 
systems. Essentially, it requires FIPS 199 to be used to categorize the system, 
then controls to be implemented to secure it appropriately, using NIST Special 
Publication 800-53 “Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information 
Systems and Organizations” as a basis.
Although many of the FIPS documents fall back onto NIST publications as the 
basis of their efforts, they are somewhat of an extension of those publications 
that expands on and solidifies those requirements for systems needing a higher 
level of security.
Developing a Framework From Scratch
We can certainly develop our own framework or modify an existing one, if this 
is something that we think that we need to do, but we should think carefully 
before we proceed to do so. As we just finished discussing, there are numerous 
frameworks for risk management that already exist in the market. These frame-
works have all undergone considerable review and testing and have been in use 
for years. Although reinventing the wheel may be merited in some cases, this 
seems like an unlikely candidate for such.
Presuming that we do decide that this effort makes sense, it would make 
sense to harvest whatever we can from the existing frameworks in build-
ing our own. Although we may build or tune a framework out of our own 
needs, most of the concepts behind the steps are likely to turn out very 
similar.
EVALUATE OBJECTIVES FOR RISK MANAGEMENT
There are two main categories of objectives for risk management as pertains 
to information security: the objectives of the business itself and the objectives 
that are specific to information security. In the business sense, we have the 
traditional objectives: strategic, financial, operational, and compliance. In the 
information security world, we have objectives that have come down from  
the business and those that are specific to security itself. These objectives 
are generally set during annual planning processes and added to or updated 
throughout the year on an as-needed basis.

82
CHAPTER 5: 
Manage the Risks
Business Objectives
Our business objectives, as pertaining to risk management, can be categorized as 
strategic, financial, operational, or compliance related. As we will discuss later in 
this chapter in greater detail, our responses to these types of risk are to avoid, mit-
igate, accept, or transfer risk. These responses may be coordinated by a central 
group, or responsibility for resolution may fall to certain areas or lines of business.
Strategic
Strategic risks are those that result from uncertainties, unpursued areas, and 
general gaps in organizational strategies. These types of risks are usually exter-
nal to the company and, thus, are often not included in or evaluated along 
with the more obvious and largely internal set of risks as we are evaluating risk. 
Some examples of strategic risk might include:
	
n	 a new competitor entering the market;
	
n	 an existing competitor developing a disruptive technology;
	
n	 changes to customer base or demand for a product;
	
n	 mergers and acquisitions among competitors.
Objectives for strategic risk are designed to enhance the corporate strategy and 
ensure that we are able to execute on it and gain the maximum level of effec-
tiveness from it. Preparing responses to strategic risk can often be difficult as 
the risks are considerably more ethereal in nature than the other types that we 
need to deal with and develop strategies to compensate for.
Financial
Financial risks are those that are associated with the financial systems of the 
company, including how we conduct our financial operations on a day-to-day 
basis. Some examples of financial risk might include:
	
n	 cash flow
	
n	 who we owe money to and who owes money to us
	
n	 financial insurance or lack thereof
	
n	 interest rates
	
n	 exchange rates in foreign markets
	
n	 dependencies on single markets or customers
Financial risks, unlike strategic risks, are often very well defined and controlled. 
In some cases depending on how our organization is structured and owned, we 
will be subject to a number of laws and regulations that very specifically govern 
how we handle financial risk and how we report this to investors, customers, 
and the general public.
Operational
Operational risk objectives are those that are associated with the day-to-day 
operation of the business and its operational and administrative processes 

83
Evaluate Objectives for Risk Management
and procedures. These are typically managed at a line of business level as they 
require considerable domain knowledge of the business to properly respond 
to the individual risk. Some examples of operational risk might include:
	
n	 hiring processes
	
n	 termination processes
	
n	 supply chain
	
n	 management of IT networks and systems
	
n	 management of theft or loss
	
n	 management of fraud
Operational objectives, and their associated risks, are, to a large extent, the under-
pinning of our strategic objectives. For example, if our IT systems cannot support 
the amount of traffic that results from the heightened level of activity during our 
annual black Friday [1] sale, then we may potentially lose tens of millions of 
dollars of sales and be unable to support our strategic objective for sales.
Compliance
Compliance risk objectives are those associated with our requirements to 
comply with the laws and regulations that are defined by the industries and 
geographies in which we are operating. In particular, when we are operating 
internationally, this can result in a very complex set of compliance boundaries 
in which we must conduct business. Ensuring proper compliance is one of 
the primary objectives of being a strong corporate governance program. Some 
examples of compliance risk might include:
	
n	 new laws around health or safety (tobacco, asbestos);
	
n	 changes in legislation reducing demand for a product;
	
n	 costs associated with compliance assessments and resulting mitigation 
efforts;
	
n	 higher operational costs resulting from regulatory changes;
	
n	 changing laws on what information needs to be reported and tracked.
Compliance risks can weigh heavily on our strategic and financial objectives as 
they have the ability to heavily influence both of these areas. A change to com-
pliance can heavily impact business, for example, the announcement from the 
Payment Card Industry (PCI) council in 2011 [2] that required retailers to start 
supporting EMV (Europay, MasterCard, Visa)-enabled payment cards in 2015, 
causing retailers to upgrade payment terminals en masse.
Security Objectives
The management of information security risk and the resulting objectives are 
centered on protecting the organization and its information assets from harm, 
whether accidental or intentional. These objectives fall into two major cate-
gories: those inherited from the business, as just discussed, and those that are 
specific to information security.

84
CHAPTER 5: 
Manage the Risks
Objectives Inherited From the Business
Information security objectives inherited from the business include support 
of strategic, financial, operational, and compliance areas. Although this does 
not mean that information security is directly responsible for executing these 
objectives, it does mean that we are responsible for supporting the organization 
in its safe execution of them. Ultimately, if we allow the organization’s assets 
confidentiality, integrity, or availability to be compromised, it will adversely 
affect its ability to conduct business.
Strategic
As discussed earlier, strategic risks are those that result from uncertainties, 
unpursued areas, and general gaps in organizational strategies and they are 
largely external to the organization. In an information security sense, much of 
our responsibility here will likely be in the area of protecting the ­organization 
and its information assets from external interference. Particularly in the case 
where we have trade secrets or other intellectual property on which the com-
pany depends on maintaining a high level of confidentiality around, the infor-
mation security team has a definite role here.
Financial
When we covered this risk earlier in the chapter, we said that financial risks 
are those that are associated with the financial systems of the company, 
including how we conduct our financial operations on a day-to-day basis. 
Security has a large role here, particularly in the area of keeping attackers 
from compromising the systems on which our company’s finances run or 
interact with.
Operational
As discussed, operational risk objectives are those that are associated with the 
day-to-day operation of the business and its operational and administrative 
processes and procedures. Again, as with financial objectives, it falls within 
information security’s remit to protect the operational systems of the company. 
If we do not protect our IT systems, supply chains, etc., then the ability of our 
organization to conduct business will be highly impacted. We also need to 
make sure that security does not obstruct operations, or security will simply 
not be consulted in the future.
Compliance
When we look at compliance, our risk objectives are those associated with 
our requirements to comply with the laws and regulations that are defined 
by the industries and geographies in which we are operating. This is an area 
heavily associated with information security, as many of the controls that we 
are required to put in place from a mitigation perspective are very specifically 

85
Evaluate Objectives for Risk Management
security controls. In many cases, it falls to the security department to assess 
what controls are needed, ensure that they are put in place, and evaluate their 
proper functionality after they are implemented.
Security-Specific Objectives
In a strong security program, our security-specific goals for risk management 
will be constructed based on the business, the structure of the organization, the 
risks identified, and the resources that we have available to work with. In many 
cases, the majority of the high-level objectives for information security will be 
driven by the requirements of the business. In a security-specific sense, we can 
structure our efforts around the CIA triad.
Confidentiality
Maintaining confidentiality is a key information security task in almost any 
industry or environment that we might care to examine. Even in the case where 
we are not working with any sort of regulated data, which is somewhat of a rare 
business environment these days, we will generally have some information 
that we would not care to have publicized, even if it is only lists of customers 
or clients that competitors might make use of. Many such efforts around confi-
dentiality will be focused on the securing of data within our systems and move-
ment of data into, out of, and among the systems that we control ourselves and 
those external systems that we interface with.
Integrity
Protecting the integrity of our information assets is another area in which 
information security plays a key role. If we lose control of the way in which our 
data are manipulated and enable unauthorized or unintentional manipulation 
of data, this may have a very large effect on the business.
A good example of this is the Wal-Mart Universal Product Code (UPC) label 
manipulation scam, an uncomfortably often repeated scam in which attackers 
overlay the UPC barcode on more expensive items with those from similar 
but less expensive items [5]. This is a particularly difficult area to secure, as the 
information defining which product is being purchased and what said product 
should cost is easily open to modification.
Availability
The availability of our applications, systems, networks, and other items of infra-
structure can have great impact on our ability to conduct business and often 
falls, at least in part, under the purview of information security. Although, 
conceptually, this is not a difficult thing, it can be a considerably more com-
plex area than we might expect it to be. When we have even a small number 
of internal and external systems interacting to build software, maintain sys-
tem configurations, take payments from customers, ship products, and so on, 

86
CHAPTER 5: 
Manage the Risks
making sure that these systems are always up and functioning and can fail over 
properly can be a large task and should not be underestimated.
RESPONDING TO THE RESULTS OF RISK ASSESSMENTS
As we look at responding to the results of our risk assessments, two major 
questions arise: who decided how we will respond to the risks that we have 
codified and in what ways can we respond to the risks? Although the answer to 
the first can be somewhat fluid, depending on our organization, the latter has 
a well-structured set of methods by which we can respond.
Who Decides How to Respond?
When we look to place responsibility for deciding how to respond to risk with 
a particular team or group within the organization, there are a number of 
places that this could land. We could make use of a risk management team, 
leave decision making to the lines of business that own the risks, information 
security could handle risk, or we could form a collaborative group expressly 
for doing so.
Centralized Risk Groups
In larger, more mature, and more well-structured organizations, we are very 
likely to find a group whose charter is to manage risk for the overall organi-
zation. Such a group will typically be part of legal, human resources, or even 
report through information security itself.
The benefit of having a risk team be responsible for deciding how to respond 
to risks is that tasks like this are, presumably, very specifically why such a team 
exists. They have the expertise and domain knowledge of risk management and 
can apply this, in conjunction with knowledge of the organization, to respond-
ing to the risks that have been identified.
Presuming an organization with the size and resources to support a risk orga-
nization, tasking them with developing the strategy for responding to risks 
would seem to be the most efficient and logical path.
Lines of Business
Another option that we have is to assign the responsibility for deciding how 
to respond to risks to the lines of business from which said risks issued, given 
that the lines of business have intimate knowledge of their procedures and 
processes and will have, perhaps, the best handle on what needs to be done to 
resolve this risk. This would make a certain amount of sense.
One potential issue here, especially in larger organizations, is that we may be 
dealing with many lines of business, perhaps distributed over large geographic 

87
Responding to the Results of Risk Assessments
areas. Even in the case where we let the businesses manage their own risks, we 
would still need some sort of central body to manage the decentralized set of 
groups that would be handling all of the different risks.
Absent of this function, we would not have a good way of being able to track 
the response to the risks and ensure that they were taken care of appropriately.
Information Security
We might also decide to leave the decisions regarding how to respond to risk 
to the information security team. After all, the security team will have a good 
handle on the security intricacies surrounding the risks and should play a large 
part in deciding how to handle the identified risks.
A potential issue with this approach is that information security is often located 
in one of a couple portions of the organization, either reporting directly to the 
C-level executives, or reporting up through the information technology leader-
ship. Although supporting information security with its very focused and often 
very technology-oriented mission works well from these two reporting paths, it 
can sometimes give security a bit of a myopic view of the overall organization.
Collaborative Groups
We might also elect to form a collaborative group to decide how to respond to risk. 
An interdisciplinary team composed of risk management, the lines of business, 
information security, and perhaps other representatives from information technol-
ogy or elsewhere in the company can come together to form a very knowledgeable 
team that is capable of putting together a very solid plan for handling risks.
Although the other teams that we have looked at all have their strengths, any of 
them attempting to work in isolation may not ultimately fare well. Each of them, 
by themselves, will end up missing some level of the knowledge and expertise 
needed to properly respond to risks as they are discovered. Additionally, this type 
of structure will usually work well with any size and structure of organization. 
The difference being the scale of the team and the degree to which its members 
are specialized. In smaller organizations, we are likely to see such teams com-
posed of fewer people with a broader range of responsibilities.
Ultimately who accepts risk is also based on the amount of risk. A security 
engineer or incident response analyst could decide how to deal with risk of 
isolated infected system but only the chief executive officer would decide how 
to respond to a breach of all customer data. Defining roles is key to make sure 
the right level of the organization is making appropriate decisions.
Types of Responses
There are four ways that we can respond to risk. We can avoid it, we can mit-
igate it, we can accept it, or we can transfer it to someone else. Which type of 

88
CHAPTER 5: 
Manage the Risks
response to use should be based on an assessment of the likelihood of the risk 
occurring and the impact the risk will have if it does actually occur, as shown 
in Fig. 5.2.
Avoid
If the risk has a high likelihood of occurring and a high impact if it does occur, 
we should avoid the risk in question entirely. Although this gives us a very sure 
method of not needing to deal with the risk, it can be a very expensive propo-
sition indeed.
For example, retail establishments that take credit card payments can assume 
a truly staggering level of risk by doing so. With thousands or millions of 
customer credit card numbers traversing hosts and networks on their way 
to be processed, we provide a target rich environment for attackers looking 
to steal such data for fraudulent purposes. We can avoid this risk by using 
tokens to represent the credit card numbers instead of using the numbers 
themselves. If we no longer handle credit card numbers directly, we no 
longer have a risk.

A token is the “process by which the primary account number (PAN) is replaced with a 
surrogate value called a token. Detokenization is the reverse process of redeeming a token 
for its associated PAN value. The security of an individual token relies predominantly on the 
infeasibility of determining the original PAN knowing only the surrogate value.” [3].
NOTE

89
Responding to the Results of Risk Assessments
Mitigate
In cases where our risk has a high likelihood of occurring, but a low impact, the 
best route of response is to put controls in place to mitigate the risk. Although 
we can mitigate a risk, we can almost never eliminate it entirely. Whatever risk 
we have left after putting controls in place to mitigate it is known as residual risk.
We should also carefully evaluate the cost of mitigating the risk versus the cost 
of just accepting it. We can certainly put a very strong set of controls in place 
to secure a particular set of data by encrypting the individual items of data in 
a database, encrypting the storage on the database servers, putting numerous 
firewalls and intrusion detection systems on the carefully segmented network 
to which the computer is connected and locking the whole lot away inside a 
high-security facility with armed guards. However, if the data in question is 
mom’s chocolate chip cookie recipe, there was no real cost in just accepting the 
risk in the first place. It can be easy to lose sight of this.
Accept
If a risk has a low likelihood of occurring and a low level of impact if it does 
occur, then we may simply choose to accept the risk.
For example, the majority of states in the United States require vehicle owners 
to purchase car insurance, which can be costly depending on the type of vehi-
cle in question and the driving record of the vehicle owner. The cases in which 
it might be noticed that there is no insurance covering a vehicle would be if the 
vehicle was in an accident or if the vehicle was pulled over by the police and 
they request proof of insurance. For most careful drivers, the chance of either 
of these situations taking place is relatively low. Although illegal, we might 
choose not to purchase insurance on the basis of the likelihood of getting 
caught being relatively low and the impact of getting caught (outside of the 
cost of an accident) still costing less than buying proper insurance.
Acceptance of a risk because it is unlikely to occur does come with one caveat; 
we need to carefully monitor the risk for signs that its likelihood or impact 
have changed. Accepting a risk and then ignoring it for an extended period of 
time is almost sure to have undesirable results.
Transfer
In the case of risks that have a low probability of occurring, but can have a high 
impact, the best response may be to transfer the risk. Transferring the risk may 
mean asking another party to conduct the risk activity in our place, or could 
also include purchasing insurance to offset the cost of dealing with the risk, 
should it actually arise.
Transferring risk to another organization, in terms of depending on them 
to run part of your technology infrastructure is, in theory, supposed to be a 

90
CHAPTER 5: 
Manage the Risks
positive thing for an organization. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. In 
mid-2015, eCellar Systems, a company that processes payments for a number 
of wineries in Northern California, announced a breach in which “The intruder 
gained access to customer names, credit/debit card numbers, the related billing 
addresses, and any dates of birth in our system during the window of April 1st 
through 30th this year,” [4]. Among other issues, it turned out that eCellar did 
not use a tokenization solution to protect the credit cards in its systems, thus 
rendering an attack directed at stealing this sort of information very fruitful.
Cyber liability insurance is another form of risk transference. An organization 
can purchase “insurance designed to cover consumers of technology services or 
products. More specifically, the policies are intended to cover a variety of both 
liability and property losses that may result when a business engages in various 
electronic activities, such as selling on the Internet or collecting data within its 
internal electronic network” [5], thus insulating themselves from the impact of 
incidents that might occur.
COMMUNICATING RISK TO THE BUSINESS
When we communicate risk to the business, it will pay dividends to plan out 
how exactly we will do so in advance. We need to know what our channels of 
communication will be, how we will alert them to issues or changes, how we 
will communicate responsibilities to users, and how we will receive commu-
nication from users.
Communications Channels
When we are planning to communicate to the business and/or its members, 
we need to understand how exactly this mechanism will work. It is helpful to 
know who exactly the stakeholders are for the area in which we will be com-
municating, to have an understanding of how the businesses are structured 
and what they do, and we need to be able to tailor our communications for 
those audiences so that they are properly understood and relevant.
Understand the Business
Understanding the business is the first and, perhaps, the most crucial part of 
the information that we need to successfully communicate with them. Without 
an idea of how the organization is structured in terms of what the hierarchy 
is and which pieces do what, we will have very little on which to base critical 
communications, as we will not know what needs to be communicated to 
which parts of the organization.
Once we have some idea of the organizational structure and know which pieces 
of the company do what, we can start to sort out who exactly it is that we need 
to communicate to get tasks and projects accomplished.

91
Communicating Risk to the Business
Know Who the Stakeholders Are
When looking to communicate with the lines of business, as mentioned, it is 
vital to know who it is that we are looking to communicate to. Knowing who the 
stakeholders are is a critical part of this. We need to know, for each portion of the 
organization, who the leadership is and who it is within each leadership chain 
that we need to be communicating with on a given issue. Once we know who the 
stakeholders are, we can tune our communication to them to be more effective.
Targeting Communication
In addition to knowing who it is that we should be talking to, it is also import-
ant to understand at what level we should approach the subparts of the organi-
zation for a given issue. If we are taking detailed technical issues to the senior 
management for a segment of the business, then we are probably approaching 
the wrong level. These managers will end up directing us to someone below 
them, possibly several levels down, until we arrive at the proper person to help 
us. Likewise, approaching the bottom level of management for high-level stra-
tegic decisions is equally likely to fail.
Alerting for Issues or Changes
In communicating with users, we need to plan for what processes and mecha-
nisms we will use to communicate alerts. Is it likely that, at some point, we will 
have to communicate the need for a change to be made in the environment, 
or alert users to an issue, for example, patching on workstations or servers of a 
critical vulnerability.
Alerting Mechanisms
When we choose alerting mechanisms, we have a few options, many of which 
fall into the realm of normal communication in the organization, such as 
email. The unfortunate case, especially in larger organizations, is that using a 
common method of communication for alerting may mean that our alerts will 
get lost in the massive tsunami of meeting requests, email exhorting us to con-
tribute to the charity of the day, and the multitude of other corporate chatter. 
If we expect anyone to actually take action, we will need to do something that 
makes our messages stand out from the rest.
Conspicuous Alerting
For our alerts to be seen and acted upon, we need to make them stand out from 
the crowd. We can do this in a few ways:
	
n	 Uncommon senders—If we send email from a standard corporate 
distribution list it is unlikely to be noticed. Email from the vice 
president over information technology may fare better.
	
n	 Crafted subjects—Messages sent with strong subjects suggesting action, 
such as “action required” may gain us a bit more notice.

92
CHAPTER 5: 
Manage the Risks
	
n	 Out of band—Any other mechanisms we can use to communicate our 
messages may increase its effectiveness, for example, having managers 
directly pass the information to their employees in person.
Alert Fatigue
When we are subjected to a constant barrage of alerts particularly those that 
are, or at least seem to be, of a less than worthwhile nature, we develop what 
is known as “alert fatigue” or “alarm fatigue” [7]. Alert fatigue desensitizes us 
to the alerting mechanism in general, greatly increasing the likelihood that we 
will ignore the alarm entirely.
In the case of the Target breach that occurred in 2014, Target’s information 
security team was alerted, repeatedly, to the malware that was part of the attack, 
but chose to ignore it because the security tool alerting them was alerting on a 
very regular basis [8].
Communicating Responsibilities to Users
When we communicate with users, we need to be clear about what exactly it is 
that they are responsible for. For example, if we are sending out a “patch now” 
alert email and exhorting users to apply a critical Microsoft patch, we need to 
be clear on exactly what it is that we expect of them and who specifically is 
responsible for doing what.
Training and Awareness
Training and awareness, as we will discuss to a much greater extent in Chapter 
8, plays a part in how we communicate to users. It gives us a chance to set a 
baseline for what we expect them to do, it lets us specify how it is that we will 
communicate with them, and it gives us the opportunity to send a message 
tuned for each audience on what their overall responsibilities are, as relates 
to information security. Leaders, IT staff, and users all need to have training 
tailored to their functions.
Accountability
As mentioned earlier, we need to be clear what exactly it is that those being 
communicated to are going to be held accountable for and what it is that we 
expect them to do. In our “patch now” email example earlier, we might specif-
ically call out what actions we expected from end users, server administrators 
for different platforms, desktop support personnel, etc.
If we do not craft our message with this level of clarity, we will have a few people 
who do what we expect, a few people who take some unexpected action entirely, 
and the rest who will do nothing at all because they did not find a clear message 
that called for action from them directly. Where appropriate there should be con-
sequences for not meeting expectations built into the Human Resources system.

93
Communicating Risk to the Business
Receiving Communications From Users
Equally as important to planning out how we will send communication to 
users and the businesses that they represent is how we will receive communica-
tion from users. We should understand what the communication mechanisms 
are from the user end to us and set expectations for how those communica-
tions will be responded to. We also need to have a plan for critical communi-
cations coming from the user end, such as those reporting security incidents. 
Automation is important to ensure timely response.
Communication Mechanisms
Mechanisms for communication from the user world may be slightly different 
than those that we are sending out. When we are on the sending end, the com-
munication mechanism is many to one; we are typically sending out to a large 
group of people. On communications where we are on the receiving end, we 
have the opposite situation; many to one. Where we might be okay in sending 
out from a mailing list, being on the receiving end of one with a large user base 
on the other side may be problematic.
In this case, we will likely be better off in putting some sort of gating mecha-
nism in place such as a ticketing system or help desk. In this way we can control 
and filter the incoming messages, perhaps solving the source of some of them 
simply by having a process in place to corral them on the way in.
Setting Expectations
Setting expectations for how we will respond to incoming communications is 
another important part of the process. These expectations may range anywhere 
from “we will respond to this request within X hours/days” to “this mailbox is 
unmonitored, please call the help desk for issues.” The exact content of such 
replies does not matter as much as the fact that we have set the expectations for 
the person on the other end of the communication.
Another method of setting expectations is through the use of service level 
agreements (SLAs). When we document SLAs, we preset an expectation of how 
long we will take for a first response to a request, how often we will provide 
updates, and, potentially, the period of time in which we expect to solve the 
issue.
Incident Reporting
Security incident reporting is somewhat of a special case for user commu-
nication. This is an area in which we want to be sure to pay maximum 
attention to what users are communicating to us. Although there will be 
a certain number of false positives from end users, we would generally 
have them overreport than keep quiet about some sort of problem that was 
happening.

94
CHAPTER 5: 
Manage the Risks
Issues in this area can generally be fixed with the application of a bit of pro-
cess and training for both users and those performing intake of incidents. 
We need to quickly be able to triage the situation and decide whether the 
issue merits further action or simply needs to be routed elsewhere for a 
solution. This area needs training and validation exercises to ensure it is 
operating correctly.
RISK MANAGEMENT AND CONTROLS
In the world of risk management, controls provide us with one of our primary 
methods for mitigating risk. They help to assure us that our risk management 
requirements are being met from a legal, regulatory, and business standpoint. 
They ensure that the risks are being dealt with and that the controls that we put 
in place are adequate.
What Security Controls Provide Us
Ultimately, controls provide us with some assurance that our risks are being 
handled in some fashion. We need to make sure that we are in compliance 
with the various items under which we fall by dint of the data that we are han-
dling and the industries in which we operate. They also help to give us some 
assurance that risks are being dealt with. This ties back to using frameworks 
that outline the proper controls.
Assurance That Requirements Are Met
Controls help to, but do not assure, that our requirements are being met. Often, 
our compliance requirements come along with specific requirements for con-
trols being implemented. For instance, the PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry 
Data Security Standard) requirements include a variety of specific controls that 
need to be implemented, an example of which includes “5.1 Deploy antivirus 
software on all systems commonly affected by malicious software (particularly 
personal computers and servers)” [6].
Controls can fall into three main categories, physical, administrative, and 
technical. Physical controls mitigate risks to physical security, administrative 
controls mitigate risks from a procedural and process perspective, and techni-
cal controls manage risk from a technical standpoint. None of the categories 
of controls are sufficient by themselves, but each contributes to the layered 
defense necessary to provide good security.
Assurance That Risks Are Being Dealt With
Controls also provide us with some level of assurance that risks are being dealt 
with. In the sense of technical controls, this typically means that we are miti-
gating risk. We put firewalls, intrusion detection systems, access control lists, 
and so on in place to prevent attackers from getting into our systems at all.

95
Risk Management and Controls
In a certain sense, when we accept, avoid, or transfer risk, we may be utilizing 
administrative controls. We are putting processes, procedures, standards, etc. 
in place to prevent us from hurting ourselves by making bad decisions about 
taking risk.
We must also consider, however, that controls are only as good as our 
implementation of them. If we implement a control in an improper or 
insecure fashion then we may actually be worse off than not having imple-
mented it at all, due to having given ourselves and our customers a false 
sense of security.
Key Controls
Key controls are the primary controls that we use to manage risk with our envi-
ronments. Key controls typically have characteristics similar to the following:
	
n	 Key controls are required to provide some level of assurance that the 
risk will be mitigated.
	
n	 If the control fails, it is unlikely that another control could take over for 
it.
	
n	 If the control fails, it will affect an entire process.
	
n	 The control needs to be tested as part of compliance or audit efforts.
What is and is not a key control will vary by the environment in question and 
the risks within that particular environment. What is a key control in one place 
may not be so in another.
Establish
Establishing key controls will be a product of the risk management process, 
largely in our responses to risk. When we mitigate or transfer our risk, in par-
ticular, we will likely put controls in place around our efforts to ensure that we 
end up in an expected place.
As mentioned previously, key controls will vary from one environment to the 
next. Our particular set of key controls will be those that are needed to mitigate 
our risks, each control covering its own areas.
Evaluate
Key controls must be periodically evaluated to ensure that they are function-
ing in accordance with the requirements for putting them in place. In the 
case of technical controls, such as firewalls, this often involves penetration 
testing to have some level of assurance that the control is doing what it is 
supposed to do.
In the case of administrative controls, we will often need to run through the 
documentation that defines how the control should work and then provide 
examples of the process actually being followed in the intended fashion.

96
CHAPTER 5: 
Manage the Risks
Effectiveness
The effectiveness of our controls is somewhat more difficult to gauge than the 
functionality of them as it is rather more subjective. In many cases, we should 
easily be able to accurately evaluate administrative controls as this involves 
working through the processes and comparing how they work on paper versus 
how they are implemented in practice.
Technical controls are somewhat a different case. Evaluating such tools will 
often require a highly technical and specialized set of skills and, sometimes, 
tooling and instrumentation as well. Outside of companies with a great deal of 
resources to spare on such activities, or those already operating in such indus-
tries, we will often need to outsource such evaluations.
Control Activities
When we have controls in place, there are three primary sets of activities that 
we need to do to maintain them properly: monitoring, reporting, and review. 
Each of these activities is equally important as the next and we will likely not 
have a full coverage of ensuring control health conducting all three.
Monitoring
Controls need to be monitored to determine whether the measures have the 
desired effect and whether they have a positive or a negative impact toward 
mitigating or reducing risk. Monitoring of controls, especially key controls, 
should be done on an ongoing basis to make sure that they stay current and 
continue to perform their role relative to changes in the environment or in 
technology. Without such monitoring, our controls will quickly fall out of use-
fulness and we may not even know that this has happened. Additionally, con-
trols should be slated for recurring and regular review cycles.
Review
Our controls need to undergo a periodic review to determine whether they are 
still effective and meet the risk management objectives, control objectives, and 
the risk environment. In particular, as risks change, are negated, and new risks 
arise, these changes should be feeding directly into the review process. Without 
an ongoing feed of risk updates, and subsequent review to determine whether 
our set of controls still covers these risks, or whether new controls are needed 
entirely or old controls should be retired, we will again, fall quickly out of use-
fulness in the controls department.
Reporting
As we monitor controls and review them, we also need to document the results 
and carefully track how the control environment in our organization changes 

97
Gaining Management Buy In
so that they can be tracked over longer periods of time and reported to man-
agement. Given a history of control change, we can begin to evaluate trends 
and, perhaps, begin to predict where the trends in our control changes are 
headed. This can be of great utility in forecasting resource needs as some con-
trols are very expensive to make changes to.
Controls and Audit Findings
In many cases, audit findings are centered on the use of controls. For any given 
framework against which we might be audited, we are likely to find audit find-
ings centered on controls or the lack of them, and how these controls are applied.
Auditing Against Frameworks
Audits are typically done against existing frameworks of some kind. In the 
security world, these will often take the form of the ISO 27000 series of doc-
uments or the NIST special publications series documents that cover various 
information security topics. There are a multitude of such frameworks against 
which we might be audited, and the particular one chosen by our auditors will 
vary with organization, industry, and other similar factors.
Audit Findings Centered on Controls
Audit findings are often centered on the use of controls. For any given frame-
work against which we might be audited, said framework will generally specify 
a control or set of controls to mitigate particular risks. In an organization that 
deals with a variety of regulated data, we might even see the same or overlap-
ping controls mandated by different bodies. This can be very complex to sort 
out when planning an information security program and, in the end, may not 
lead to a strong security program at all.
Auditing How Controls Are Applied
Another item of concern in many audits is how exactly our controls are applied 
or implemented. We could have the newest, most expensive, and strongest 
security controls available on the market, but if we have not implemented 
them properly, they may be of no use to us at all.
Auditors will typically have criteria for the appropriate implementation of par-
ticular controls, hopefully with a foundation in the particular framework being 
used to develop and assess the environment.
GAINING MANAGEMENT BUY IN
One of the most crucial aspects of an information security program, any part of 
it that we might care to examine, is gaining management buy in and support. If 

98
CHAPTER 5: 
Manage the Risks
we are not adequately supported by management, then we will have difficulty 
in a wide variety of areas, whether gaining funding, staffing, resources, or even 
political support. Gaining such support will be considerably eased if we estab-
lish business relevancy, put issues into context, discuss our objectives and how 
to meet them, relate these objectives back to compliance, and communicate 
our needs, all backed with solid data. This may seem like a large effort, but 
really it is relatively simple, as shown in Fig. 5.3.
Establish Business Relevancy
A vital part of getting management buy in is establishing how our request is 
relevant to the business. A common mistake made by security professionals is 
to assume that information security exists for its own sake. Although it is true 
that security is important, outside of a few exceptions, it is not the primary 
driver for business. The primary business driver is selling the company’s prod-
ucts like selling books, providing a mobile financial application for customer 
use, cleaning windows, etc. We need to address how it is that whatever we are 
asking for is going to drive business to the company or how it is going to pre-
vent current business from leaving.
FIGURE 5.3
Gaining management buy in.

99
Gaining Management Buy In
In many cases, drawing lines from information security to business objectives 
is relatively simple. Information security exists to protect customer data, safe-
guard intellectual property, protect infrastructure from attackers, and so on. 
Particularly in the case where we are in or adjacent to an industry where sensi-
tive or regulated data are being handled, we have an easy answer to the “why 
do we need to do this?” question.
Discuss Objectives and How They Will Be Met
When we are presenting our plan to gain management buy in, it is vital that we 
discuss how it is that we plan to meet our objectives. This will often take the 
form of a project plan or set of documents that detail out what exactly it is that 
we are doing, what the timeline is for accomplishing our goals, what resources 
are to be used, what dependencies are in place both within and outside of our 
organization, and so on.
We should also be careful, as with any other of our set of details that describe 
our project, not to bring information to management at too great a level of 
depth. Not only do we need to have the detailed information that describes 
how we will execute our plan at the level that we need to accomplish it, but we 
also need to have a boiled up version, suitable for presenting to management, 
sometimes referred to as an executive summary. We will return to this concept 
again later in this section.
Relate to Compliance
One particularly helpful tactic to gain management buy in for our efforts is to 
relate them back to compliance. This does make the assumption that we are 
working with data that are, in some fashion regulated, but this is very common 
and not doing so in some portion of our environment would be the exception 
rather than the rule. Where there is no regulation there are still key stakeholder 
requirements and the list below can help determine what that looks like.
The wide variety of compliance-driven security efforts present in almost any 
given organization might include:
	
n	 PII—Personally Identifiable Information (name, address, Social Security 
number)
	
n	 PCI—Payment Card Industry (credit cards)
	
n	 HIPAA—Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (health 
care data)
	
n	 FERPA—Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (educational data)
	
n	 GLBA—Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (financial data)
Nearly any company with employees will have at least a few areas where one 
or other types of these data are stored. If we can relate our security efforts back 

100
CHAPTER 5: 
Manage the Risks
to items that we are legally or contractually required to put protections in place 
for, this can considerably ease our task.
It is important to note that a security program based on the baseline compli-
ance requirements is not necessarily a very secure program. Although these 
often represent a good starting point, they are not sufficient to provide strong 
security.
Be Prepared With Data
Although our need to display data at varying depths will change with the audi-
ence that we are presenting to, we should always be prepared to discuss it. In 
many cases, especially in larger organizations, the higher the level of man-
agement that we are presenting to, the less time and interest they will have in 
doing deep dives into our data. As with presentations of any kind, we need to 
have tuned our message to the audience, but be ready go deeper if needed.
As discussed in the earlier sections, among other things, we need to be able to 
establish business relevancy, put issues into context, and relate back to compli-
ance. These are all data-driven items and we should have the information ready 
about what exactly needs to be done, what the results will be if we do not do 
it, and what is needed to achieve it.
When preparing data on which decisions will be made, it can often be helpful 
to present alternatives as well. In this way we can provide a minimum, ade-
quate, and ideal set of plans, along with the data to back each of them up. One 
of the caveats with presenting data-backed requests is that data are very black 
and white and can lead to a yes or no answer that does not allow for grey areas, 
unless we present them.
Communicate Needs
When we are making a request of management, we need to be very careful to 
communicate our needs. As covered in the previous section, we need to have 
enough data to back up what it is that we are asking for, but we need to go 
beyond this when actually asking.
If our expectation is that we will need to spend 1 million dollars on a new 
cluster of security appliances, hire two people to run it, and send both of 
them to training classes from the vendor, then we need to ask for this in 
very specific terms. We need to have a write-up that covers why this was the 
selected solution, how it relates back to the objectives of the overall orga-
nization and its compliance efforts, and how exactly we plan to make the 
purchase, get it installed, and have it up and performing its function, all in 
conjunction with a set of milestones and a timeline for getting everything 
done.

CHAPTER 6
Protecting the information assets on which our organization runs is a large 
part of our responsibility as security professionals. For almost any organiza-
tion we choose to look at, information is key to survival and growth. Even 
in the case where we look at a business much more oriented to the physical, 
manufacturing, for instance, where goods being created and then sold are the 
linchpin of the business, the information is still what drives the business. Our 
manufacturing business without its customer lists and the ability to bill its 
customers would not last for more than a quarter.
To protect these information assets, we need to understand what they are and 
what physical components they have, and be able to classify and be able to 
apply controls to both sides. In addition, we need to be concerned with tech-
nology areas changing and growing with rapidity such as the cloud, laptops, 
and mobile devices.
DATA CLASSIFICATION
Data classification gives us a way to indicate how a particular item of data 
should be stored, handled, and protected, who it should be shared with, and 
what the rules around sharing might be.

Protect the Data

104
CHAPTER 6: 
Protect the Data
When we look at types of data to classify them, they may fall into different 
categories of classification systems, depending on whether the environment in 
question is commercial or not.
Data Sensitivity and Criticality
The particular language used in classification systems for government and mil-
itary use will vary from one country to another, but the concepts are, for the 
most part, the same. The system used in the United States contains the follow-
ing commonly used classification levels (there are quite a few more):
	
n	 Top secret
	
n	 the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected 
to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security
	
n	 Secret
	
n	 the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected 
to cause serious damage to the national security
	
n	 Confidential
	
n	 the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected 
to cause damage to the national security
	
n	 Unclassified
	
n	 data open to the general public with no restrictions
Such systems are implemented in a strict method, with stiff penalties for not 
doing so or for not having done so.
In a corporate environment, we may find data marked with a classification 
system similar to what is used by the military, but with somewhat differing 
terminology:
	
n	 Highly sensitive/Restricted
	
n	 could represent a very high cost if exposed or controlled by 
regulations
	
n	 Sensitive/Confidential
	
n	 could represent a high cost if exposed
	
n	 Internal
	
n	 data not for public consumption, but not of a sensitive nature
	
n	 Public
	
n	 data for public consumption, as might be posted on a public website.
In a corporate environment, we will often find data classification schemes such 
as this, perhaps with some variation in exact terminology, implemented in pol-
icy but not in practice, or implemented in a poor manner. These environments 
are not often under any regulatory pressure to do so, and the task is a difficult 
one to carry out. The exception to this is in businesses dealing with or having 
had such work contracted to them.

105
Access Control Considerations
In the case of regulatory data, we will often find data classified into the follow-
ing categories:
	
n	 Personally Identifiable Information (PII)—name, address, social 
security number, etc.
	
n	 Patient Healthcare Information—health care data
	
n	 Payment Card Industry (PCI)—payment card data
	
n	 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act—educational data
These classifications are not mutually exclusive with those above or with each 
other, and we may well find a combination of them, as we might in the case 
of a database containing customer data being marked as Highly Sensitive, PII, 
and PCI. Due to the regulatory nature of these categories, we will find them 
used to a much greater extent in corporate or educational settings than those 
in the aforementioned list.
ACCESS CONTROL CONSIDERATIONS
An information asset is any item of information providing material value 
to our organization. Information assets can be customer information, 
order information, trade secrets, recipes, architectural plans, intellectual 
property, or any of a huge number of other items of information. If we 
will feel an impact from the information going missing, being exposed to 
the public, being sold to hackers, and so on, this would be an indicator it 
was an information asset.
The important items to know when discussing information assets are what 
the assets are and how we go about protecting them. As with almost every-
thing in the security industry, we need to have some understanding of a thing 
to be able to secure it. This can present a problem to us as security profes-
sionals, as no one has an inherent understanding of the value and impact of 
an information asset. Our information assets are handled by managers, engi-
neers, developers, cooks, janitors, groundskeepers, and a large assortment of 
other people working in and around our environments on an everyday basis. 
If the person emptying the bins containing sensitive documents slated for 
shredding intermingles them with the regular recycling bin due to lack of 
understanding regarding the sensitivity of “just paper,” then we might end 
up with a serious problem.
These and other potential issues we might wish to avoid can indicate the need 
to be careful in documenting the program and process pieces in place to pre-
vent these sorts of incidents, as well as ensuring we take careful steps to train 
everyone who might have access to our information assets, all the way from the 
top down to the lowliest brook wielding janitor.

106
CHAPTER 6: 
Protect the Data
Administrative Controls
From an administrative standpoint, the controls around information assets 
will more often than not be based on policies and procedures. Our policies 
should be pointing out the high-level intent of how our information assets are 
to be handled, and the procedures should lend specific definition using the 
policies as a basis. From a policy perspective, we need to discuss the intent for 
protecting our information assets. Here we should be discussing the need to 
protect customer information, trade secrets, and the rest of the data on which 
our business depends. Having the appropriate procedures in place will help 
to protect us from incidents like our shred-bin-dumping janitor in the exam-
ple we discussed earlier. These types of issues are so common they are often 
found as hot spots for investigation during various audits as well, so it would 
behoove us in a variety of ways to have these pieces of the program well road 
mapped out and be working toward implementation of them.
These controls, of course, will not stand by themselves and will fail if we do not 
communicate them and take steps to ensure our organization is trained in what 
we expect of them. We will discuss training and other similar needs in Chapter 8.
Technical Controls
Controlling the movement of information assets from a technical perspective can 
be a difficult task indeed. In the network-connected age in which we live, almost 
any device can connect to a network and store a file. This provides almost endless 
avenues for our information to move around in an unauthorized manner.
The set of technologies referred to as rights management is one possible solution 
to protecting, managing, and controlling access to our information assets. To 
boil down rights management technology into a bit of a simplified version of 
how it works we can use the example of a document containing sensitive data. 
We would like to be able to control how the document is used, who can access it, 
how many times it can be accessed and over what period of time, and whether it 
can be printed or edited, and we would like to be able to deny access to it, should 
it become necessary or desirable to do so. This sounds like an overwhelming set 
of things to keep track of for a single document, let alone a large set of them. 
To accomplish all of this, we can bring in a Rights Management System (RMS).
Rights Management
RMS systems are available from a number of vendors, including offerings from large 
companies such as Microsoft and Oracle. The amount of effort in implementing such a system 
can be large, but the security gains realized can be larger yet.
TIP

107
Physical and Environmental Security for Facilities
In essence, when we use the RMS, we encrypt our document in a special man-
ner only the RMS can understand and decrypt. We then use a specific client to 
access the document. This might be a specific reader for the RMS or it might be 
a plugin for another tool, such as Microsoft Office. The client is configured to 
know where our back-end RMS servers are and how to talk to them, and it goes 
off and requests access to the document in the context of the user when we try 
to open it. The RMS server will check the specifics for the document and user to 
see what types of access are allowed and then relay this to the client. If the user 
is allowed to access the document and the document itself is still registered 
as being accessible, the user is provided access. This access might be further 
restricted by disallowing the user saving the document elsewhere or printing it, 
or any of a large number of other granular permissions.
Physical Controls
In addition to administrative and technical controls to protect our data, we 
also need to consider physical controls. Physical controls, i.e., those that pre-
vent someone from just walking in and making off with the physical media on 
which our data are stored, may arguably be the most critical of the three control 
categories. If physical controls are not implemented, not implemented prop-
erly, or are subverted, then the technical and administrative controls may be 
nullified entirely. We will discuss physical controls in detail in the next section.
PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SECURITY FOR 
FACILITIES
In addition to the security of our personnel, when we look at security from a 
physical and environmental perspective, we have two major areas of concern: 
securing the area itself and securing the items within the area. To create a secure 
area from a physical perspective, we need to secure the site itself, using locks, 
guards, site layouts and landscaping, badges, video cameras, and so on. For the 
equipment within the facility, our security concerns become somewhat more 
environmental, i.e., providing stable power, keeping water where it belongs, 
and ensuring proper disposal of equipment. We also need to take into consid-
eration the possibility of equipment or data storage devices leaving our facili-
ties in an unauthorized manner.
Secure Areas
For site security we may see detective systems in the form of human or ani-
mal guards, whether they patrol an area on foot or monitor it secondhand 
through the use of technology such as camera systems. This type of monitoring 
has both good and bad points—a living being may be less focused than an 
electronic system, but does have the potential to become distracted and will 
need to be relieved for meals, bathroom breaks, and other similar activities. In 

108
CHAPTER 6: 
Protect the Data
addition, we can scale such guards from the lowliest unarmed security guard to 
well-armed security forces with a great deal of training, as is appropriate for the 
situation. As is true for most implementations involving security, the principle 
of defense in depth applies here.
When we discuss securing access to our equipment or our facility, we return 
again to the concept of defense in depth. There are multiple areas, inside and 
outside, where we may want to place a variety of security measures, depending 
on the environment. A military installation may have the highest level of secu-
rity available, whereas a small retail store may have the lowest level.
We can often see measures for securing physical access implemented on the 
perimeter of the property on which various facilities sit. Often, we will at least 
see minimal measures in place to ensure vehicle traffic is controlled and does 
not enter undesirable places. Such measures may take the form of security 
landscaping. For example, we may see trees, large boulders, large cement plant-
ers, and the like placed in front of buildings or next to driveways to prevent 
unauthorized vehicle entry. At more secure facilities, we might see fences, con-
crete barriers, and other more obvious measures. Such controls are, in general, 
in place as deterrents, and may be preventive in nature as well.
At the facility itself, we should expect to see some variety of locks, whether 
mechanical or electronic with access badges, in place on the doors at the 
entrance to the building. A typical arrangement for nonpublic buildings is for 
the main entrance of the building to be unlocked during business hours and a 
security guard or receptionist stationed inside. In more secure facilities, almost 
all of the doors will be locked at all times, and a badge or key required to enter 
the building. Once inside the building, visitors will often have limited access to 
a lobby area, and, perhaps, meeting and restrooms, whereas those authorized 
to enter the rest of the building will use a key or badge to access it.
Once inside the facility, we will often see a variety of physical access controls, 
depending on the work and processes being carried out. We may see access 
controls on internal doors or individual floors of the building to keep visi-
tors or unauthorized people from accessing the entire facility. Often, in the 
case where computer rooms or data centers are present, access to them will be 
restricted to those with a legitimate need to enter them for business reasons. 
We may also find more complex physical access controls in place in such areas, 
such as biometric systems.
Badges
Badges and the badge readers that accompany them are a physical control 
enabling us to restrict access to our employees, without having to deal with 
the distribution and relative irrevocability of having physical keys. Although 
badges do make a good control, they are not without their drawbacks.

109
Physical and Environmental Security for Facilities
Physical tailgating, also known as “piggybacking” is what most people think 
of when they hear the term used. This is the act of following someone through 
an access control point, such as secure door, without having the proper creden-
tials, badge, or key, required to enter the door.
Tailgating is a problem endemic to locations that use technical access controls. 
In almost any location, unless strong steps have been taken to prevent it, we 
can see people tailgating. This is somewhat an issue of laziness, and somewhat 
an issue of the desire to avoid confrontation. In particular, in locations where 
the majority of foot traffic is composed of younger people, we will see tailgat-
ing policies flouted, i.e., closed school campuses, apartment buildings, etc., 
often in a willful fashion. Such locations make for easy tailgating targets.
A few tricks of equipment, such as knowing which props to use, and the use of 
psychology to allow attacker to play on the sympathies of others, will aid them 
in their tailgating efforts.
Video
Video monitoring can be a simple and, in relative terms, inexpensive method 
for adding a layer of security to a facility. Video monitoring systems can range 
from custom designed and installed systems in the tens or hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars and represent the highest level of video and audio monitoring, 
to a canned system picked up from a big box store for a few hundred dollars 
and deployed in an hour or two. In either case, the systems provide similar 
functionality at a high level, in providing a deterrent to unwanted behavior 
when those under observation know they are present and monitored.
Video surveillance can also provide us with a historical record of the events within 
the range of its ability to monitor. This ability is, perhaps, even more important 
than the deterrent provided by the presence of the system as it gives us a founda-
tion on which we can base investigations from a variety of angles. Although we 
might think the recording from the video surveillance system would be of use in 
the grossest of physical crimes, such is not the case at all. Records of physical move-
ment throughout an area, or lack thereof, and the ability to track an individual’s 
movement form one place to another, coupled with the time stamp often applied 
by video surveillance systems, can be invaluable in a great number of situations.
An additional step to take beyond video monitoring itself is the placement of signs 
in public places indicating video monitoring is in place. Video cameras are such a 
ubiquitous part of being in public or in a place of business these days they are nigh 
invisible in the background. The signs themselves do nothing to prevent people 
from acting in an undesirable fashion, but they do help to illustrate the idea there 
may be consequences for doing so and call attention to the fact there are cameras 
present. Such measures, while perhaps not contributing at a significant level to 
what we might think of as physical security, do help to keep honest people honest.

CHAPTER 6: 
Protect the Data
Equipment
Last on the list of our concerns for physical security, although still important 
and significant, is protecting our equipment, and, to a certain extent, the 
facilities housing it. This category falls last on the list because it represents 
the easiest and cheapest segment of our assets to replace. Even in case a 
major disaster destroys our facility and all the computing equipment inside 
it, as long as we still have the people needed to run our operation and are 
able to restore or access our critical data, we can be back in working order 
without a great deal of time elapsing. Replacing floor space or relocating to 
another area nearby can, in most cases, be accomplished with relative ease, 
and computing equipment is both cheap and plentiful. Although it may take 
us some time to be back to the same state we were in before the incident, 
getting to a bare minimum working state technology-wise is often a simple, 
if arduous, task.
Protecting Equipment
The physical threats harmful to our equipment, although fewer than those we 
might find harmful to people, are still numerous.
Extreme temperatures can be harmful to equipment. We often think of heat as 
being the most harmful to computing equipment, and this is correct for the 
most part. In environments with large numbers of computers and associated 
equipment, such as in a data center, we rely on environmental conditioning 
equipment to keep the temperature down to a reasonable level, often in the 
high 60s to mid-70s on the Fahrenheit scale, although there is some debate 
over the subject [1,2].
Liquids can be harmful to equipment, even when in quantities as small as 
those can be found in humid air. Depending on the liquid in question, and the 
quantity of it present, we may find corrosion in a variety of devices, short cir-
cuits in electrical equipment, and other harmful effects. In extreme cases, such 
as we might find in flooding, such equipment will often be rendered unusable 
after having been immersed.
Living organisms can also be harmful to equipment, although in the environ-
ments with which we will often be concerned, these will often be of the smaller 
persuasion. Insects and small animals gaining access to our equipment may 
cause electrical shorts, interfere with cooling fans, chew on wiring, and wreak 
all manner of havoc.
Movement in earth and in the structure of our facilities can be a bad thing for 
our equipment. One of the more obvious examples we can look at is an earth-
quake. Earthquakes can cause structural damage to our facilities, but the resul-
tant shaking, vibrations, and potential for impacts due to structural failures can 
cause a large amount of damage.

111
Physical and Environmental Security for Facilities
Smoke and fire are bad for our equipment, as they introduce a number of 
harmful conditions. With smoke or fire, we might experience extreme tem-
peratures, electrical issues, movement, liquids, and a variety of other problems. 
Efforts to extinguish fires, depending on the methods used, may also cause as 
much harm as the fire itself.
Utilities
In the case of security for utilities, our primary concern is electricity. Electrical 
anomalies can be harmful to any type of electrical equipment in a variety of 
ways. If we see issues with power being absent or not sending the expected 
amount of voltage, our equipment may be damaged beyond repair as a result. 
Good facility design will provide some measure of protection against such 
threats, but mitigating the effects of severe electrical issues, such as lightning 
strikes, can be difficult [3].
The best steps we can take to prepare ourselves for disruption of utilities are 
focused around disaster preparedness plans in place and tested well in advance 
of any incidents. In many larger organizations, such plans are covered under a set 
of policies and procedures referred to overall as business continuity planning and 
disaster recovery planning, often called BCP/DRP. BCP refers to the plans we put 
in place to ensure critical business functions can continue in a state of emergency. 
Disaster Recovery Plans (DRP) covers the plans we put in place in preparation for a 
potential disaster, and what we will do during and after a particular disaster strikes 
to get the technical infrastructure operational (often in a new location).
Disposal
As with many information security–related concepts, to secure something well 
we need to consider the various aspects of its life cycle. In the case of protecting 
equipment, we also need to see to its secure disposal. When we dispose of a 
server, desktop PC, phone, copier, controller for our air conditioning system, or 
almost anything containing electronics, we need to at least examine it to evalu-
ate whether it contains anything sensitive and need data wiping or destruction 
before we dispose of it. We might look at something like a copier and assume 
it contained no sensitive data at all, but we might well be incorrect.
In 2010, Affinity Health Plan returned a set of copiers to the leasing company from which 
they had come, with the assumption they contained no sensitive data. As later discovered 
by investigative journalists with CBS Evening News, information on 344,557 health care 
patients was contained on the devices [4], a breach of the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) costing the company a hefty fine.
NOTE

112
CHAPTER 6: 
Protect the Data
When we dispose of an item of equipment, we also need to keep a record of 
what was done to secure the device in question when it was decommissioned as 
well as a record of the serial and model numbers of the item for later reference.
ZONES OF TRUST AND CONTROL
Zones provide us a way of establishing areas of differing levels of security 
within our networks, to help mitigate risk and provide appropriate security 
controls within and at the perimeters of each of these areas. Zones are a net-
work-centric implementation of the defense in depth concept.
Defense in depth is a strategy common to both military maneuvers and infor-
mation security. In both senses, the basic concept of defense in depth is to 
formulate a multilayered defense that will allow us to still mount a successful 
defense should one or more of our defensive measures fail. In Fig. 6.1, we can 
see an example of the layers we might want to put in place to defend our assets 
from a logical perspective; we would at the very least want defenses at the 
external network, internal network, host, application, and data levels. Given 
well-implemented defenses at each layer, we will make it very difficult to suc-
cessfully penetrate deeply into our network and attack our assets directly.
One important concept to note when planning a defensive strategy using 
defense in depth is that it is not a magic bullet. No matter how many layers we 
put in place, or how many defensive measures we place at each layer, we will

Zones of Trust and Control
not be able to keep every attacker out for an indefinite period of time, nor is 
this the ultimate goal of defense in depth in an information security setting. 
The goal is to place enough defensive measures between our truly important 
assets and the attacker so that we will both notice that an attack is in progress 
and also buy ourselves enough time to take more active measures to prevent 
the attack from succeeding.
Security Zones
A security zone is an area of a network defined by a common set of security 
characteristics that define the systems that rest within it. A commonly recognized 
implementation of a security zone is what is referred to as a DMZ (demilitarized 
zone), which is a somewhat protected zone that has a greater level of protection 
than a device open on all ports to the Internet, but lesser than that of zones con-
taining systems that have no need to be directly exposed to the Internet.
As we can see in Fig. 6.2, some of the more commonly implemented zones are:
	
n	 Untrusted—This zone is often used to categorize systems over which we 
have no control at all, such as those coming in from the open Internet.
	
n	 DMZ—This zone is used to house systems that require some level of 
exposure to the Internet, such as web servers, mail servers, File Transfer 
Protocol (FTP) servers, and so on.
	
n	 Trusted—This zone is often used for middleware servers that provide 
services to the servers in the DMZ, but do not house sensitive data.

CHAPTER 6: 
Protect the Data
	
n	 Restricted—The restricted zone, usually the most secure of all the zones, 
is where we will often find the sensitive data in an environment, such as 
credit card numbers or customer data. Data in the restricted zone will 
generally fall under one or more bodies of regulation governing how it 
is protected.
	
n	 Management—The management zone is used to provide access to the 
systems and people that manage the devices within all the other zones. 
Systems in the management zone can reach into the other zones, but 
this connectivity should only be in that direction.
	
n	 Audit—The audit zone is used to maintain audit data from all the other 
zones. Data flows into the audit zone from the other zones, but not in 
the other direction.
We may see other zones implemented in addition to the above-mentioned list 
of zones, as well as zones that have additional segmentation within. For exam-
ple, we might see the Restricted Zone divided into further subzones, depending 
on the particular needs of the business and, perhaps, types of regulated data in 
the environment. The Restricted Zone might further be divided into subzones 
for PII, PCI, and HIPAA data, as shown in Fig. 6.3, each with its own set of 
controls and restrictions, as is appropriate for the type of data contained and 
the controls that need to be applied to it.
Implementing Zones
When implementing zones, we need to take into account the requirements for 
the zone in question and set up the appropriate controls to comply with these 
requirements. This will depend entirely on the needs of the zone, and there is 
no good “one size fits all” that can be universally applied. For example, our 
DMZ zone needs to be screened from the Internet, allowing access only on the 
ports needed to provide access to services that face the outside world. On the 
inside, it also needs to have access to the midtier systems that allow the services 
exposed in the DMZ to function properly. These are two relatively different sets 
of needs with different controls to protect them.

115
Zones of Trust and Control
In general, we will likely use network segmentation, access control lists (ACLs), 
monitoring, and carefully limited zone interface points to control and protect 
zones and the boundaries in between them.
Network Segmentation
Network segmentation can go a long way toward reducing the impact of 
attacks. When we segment a network, we divide it into multiple smaller net-
works, each acting as its own small network called a subnet. We can control the 
flow of traffic between subnets, allowing or disallowing traffic based on a vari-
ety of factors, or even blocking the entire flow of traffic if necessary. Segmented 
networks can boost network performance by containing certain traffic only to 
the portions of the network needing to see it, and can help to localize technical 
network issues. In addition, network segmentation can prevent unauthorized 
network traffic or attacks from reaching portions of the network to which we 
would prefer to prevent access, as well as making the job of monitoring net-
work traffic much easier.
Another design factor of assistance in the name of securing our networks is to 
funnel network traffic through certain points where we can inspect, filter, and 
control the traffic, often referred to as choke points. The choke points might be 
the routers moving traffic from one subnet to another; the firewalls or proxies 
controlling traffic moving within, into, or out of our networks or portions of 
our networks; or the application proxies filtering the traffic for particular appli-
cations such as Web or email traffic.
Access Between Zones
A key part of implementing security zones is being able to control access 
between them. When we have two zones of differing security levels, we do not 
want to make “Swiss cheese”-like access between them, as this would be dif-
ficult to both control and monitor. Instead, we want to carefully control how 
access is allowed between them and how many points there are at which traffic 
can move from one zone to the next. Additionally, traffic should not be able 
to skip zones, i.e., traffic going from the Restricted Zone to the DMZ must go 
through the intervening Trusted Zone, not straight from the Restricted Zone to 
the DMZ, as shown in Fig. 6.4.
Limiting Zone Interface Points
Access between zones should be limited to only a few interface points, as few 
as we can possibly get down to and have the ability to function as needed. This 
enables us to very carefully monitor and control these few choke points, as the 
scope of our monitoring and access controls is very small. When we open up a 
greater number of interface points between zones, this makes the task of con-
trolling the movement between them considerably more difficult.

116
CHAPTER 6: 
Protect the Data
Being able to limit interface points in this fashion, however, requires a certain 
amount of organization in our applications and environments. In the case where 
we have an application that is not cleanly divided up into application tiers, and/
or we do not have cleanly segmented areas in which our data are centrally stored, 
this can be quite a task to bring order to in the fashion that we are discussing.
In many cases, regulatory compliance requirements will require us to limit 
zone interfaces in this fashion, at least to a certain extent. Speaking generically 
of regulated data, there is often a requirement that the data be stored in some 
central repository and that access to said repository be limited to the greatest 
possible extent. This is exactly the situation that we are setting up by putting 
zones in place and only allowing limited traffic between them.
Access Control Lists
When we look at the variety of activities that take place on networks, both pri-
vate and public, we can again see ACLs regulating such activity. In the case of 
network ACLs, we typically see access controlled by the identifiers we use for 
network transactions, such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, Media Access 
Control (MAC) addresses, and ports. We can see such ACLs at work in network 
infrastructure such as routers, switches, and firewall devices, as well as in soft-
ware firewalls, Facebook, Google, email, or other forms of software.
Permissions in network ACLs tend to be binary in nature, generally consisting 
of allow and deny. When we set up the ACL, we use our chosen identifier or 
identifiers to dictate which traffic we are referring to and simply state whether 
the traffic is to be allowed or not.

117
Zones of Trust and Control
One of the simplest forms of network-oriented ACLs that we might see in 
place is MAC address filtering. MAC addresses are, in theory, unique identifiers 
attached to each network interface in a given system. Each network interface 
has a hard-coded MAC address issued when it is created.
We can also filter by the port being used to communicate over the network. 
Many common services and applications use specific ports to communi-
cate over networks. For instance, FTP uses ports 20 and 21 to transfer files, 
Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) uses port 143 for managing email, 
Secure Shell uses port 22 to manage remote connections to systems, and many 
more—65,535 ports in all. We can control the use of many applications over 
the network by allowing or denying traffic originating from or sent to any ports 
that we care to manage. Like MAC and IP addresses, the specific ports that are 
used for applications are a convention, not an absolute rule. We can, with 
relative ease, change the ports that applications use to different ports entirely.
Using single attributes to construct ACLs is likely to present a variety of issues, 
including our attribute not being guaranteed to be unique, such as an IP address, 
or being easy to alter, such as a MAC address. When we use several attributes in 
combination we begin to arrive at a more secure technique. A very commonly 
used combination is that of IP address and port, typically referred to as a socket. 
In this way, we can allow or deny network traffic from one or more IP addresses 
using one or more applications on our network in a workable fashion.
We can also construct ACLs to filter on a wide variety of other things. In some 
cases, we might want to monitor the traffic going over our network to allow or 
deny traffic based on more specific criteria, such as the content of an individual 
packet or a related series of packets. Using such techniques, we can filter out 
traffic related to attacks, or traffic that is simply undesirable to us, such as that 
related to the peer-to-peer file-sharing networks commonly used to illegally 
share copyrighted songs, videos, and software.
Monitoring
Monitoring can provide us with an additional tool for managing the security of 
and within our zones. There are a variety of places that we can monitor and, in 
these places, specific items of data that we might be interested in.
Monitoring the flow of network traffic into, out of, and in between zones can 
be critical for maintaining security. In most cases there will be a desired direc-
tionality for the flow of data relative to our zones and, additionally, zones to 
which the flow of traffic is explicitly desired or not desired. For example, the 
PCI subzone of our Restricted Zone should only be seeing traffic to or from a 
very limited number of systems. If we see an unusual volume of traffic in com-
parison with the baseline for normal traffic flow, if we see traffic to hosts that 
normally do not communicate with the PCI subzone, or if we see a completely 
unusual traffic pattern, such as the PCI subzone exchanging traffic with the 

118
CHAPTER 6: 
Protect the Data
Untrusted Zone, then we will have a very solid indicator that something has 
gone awry with our security controls and should immediately investigate.
We might also monitor the type or content of the data moving through our various 
zones. If we have a dedicated zone, for example, that should be the sole area for 
storage of sensitive data, then we might be on the lookout for this data in other 
parts of the environment where it should not be seen. If we were to find data con-
taining large blocks of credit card numbers outside of our PCI subzone, then we 
would again have an indicator that something may have gone seriously wrong.
ENSURING DATA CONFIDENTIALITY
The use of cryptography is an integral part of computing, networking, and the vast 
set of transactions taking place over such devices on a regular basis. We use cryp-
tography when we have conversations on our cell phones, check out email, buy 
things from online retailers, file our taxes, and do other activities. The chief security 
measure allowing us to make use of such technologies is cryptography—in the 
form of encryption. If we were not able to utilize encryption to protect the infor-
mation we send over such channels, many of the Internet-based activities we enjoy 
today would be carried out at a much greater risk than they are carried out now.
To discuss cryptography it is helpful to first have a good understanding of the 
terms used to describe encryption, its components, and the people involved in 
its development and use.
Cryptography, practiced by cryptographers, is the science of keeping informa-
tion secure. The term cryptography is, in everyday use, confused with encryption. 
Encryption itself is a subset of cryptography, referring to the transformation of 
unencrypted data, called plaintext or cleartext, into its encrypted form, called 
ciphertext. Decryption is the process of recovering the plaintext message from the 
ciphertext. The plaintext and ciphertext may also be referred to as the message.
The science of breaking through the encryption used to create the ciphertext is 
referred to as cryptanalysis and is practiced by cryptanalysts. The overarching 
field of study covering cryptography and cryptanalysis is referred to as cryptol-
ogy and is practiced by cryptologists.
The specifics of the process used to encrypt the plaintext or decrypt the cypher-
text is referred to as a cryptographic algorithm. Cryptographic algorithms use 
a key, or multiple keys, to encrypt or decrypt the message, this being, at a high 
level, analogous to a password. The range of all possible values for the key is 
referred to as the keyspace. We may also refer to the cryptosystem, a concept 
covering a given algorithm and all possible keys, plaintexts, and ciphertexts.
Cryptographic technologies depend on difficult mathematical problems, some-
times referred to as one-way problems. One-way problems are easy to perform 

119
Ensuring Data Confidentiality
in one direction but difficult to perform in the other direction. Factorization of 
large numbers is an example of a one-way problem. Such problems form the 
basis of many modern cryptographic systems.
Where We Use Encryption
We can divide practical uses of cryptography into three major categories: pro-
tecting data at rest, protecting data in motion, and protecting data in use. 
Protecting data at rest is important because of the large amount of stored data 
found on devices such as backup tapes, flash drives, and hard drives in portable 
devices such as laptops. Protecting data in motion is vital as well because of the 
enormous amount of business conducted over the Internet, including financial 
transactions, medical information, tax filings, and other sensitive exchanges. 
Last, protecting data while it is in use can be difficult, as we do need to allow 
access to the data at some point for it to have any utility at all.
In Motion
Another major concern to protecting our data comes when it is in motion 
over a network of some variety. This might be over a closed wide area network 
or local area network, over a wireless network, over the Internet, or in other 
ways. The primary method of securing data from exposure on network media 
is encryption, and we may choose to apply it in one of two main ways: by 
encrypting the data itself to protect it, or by protecting the entire connection.
We can take a variety of approaches to protect the data we are sending over the 
network, depending on what data we are sending and the protocols over which 
we are sending it.
Secure sockets layer (SSL) and transport layer security (TLS) are often used to 
protect information sent over networks and over the Internet, and they operate 
in conjunction with other protocols such as IMAP and Post Office Protocol for 
email, Hypertext Transfer Protocol for Web traffic, VoIP for voice conversations, 
instant messaging, and hundreds of others. SSL is the predecessor of TLS, and 
TLS is based on the last version of SSL. Both methods are still in common use.
Another approach we might choose to take is to encrypt all our network traffic 
with a virtual private network (VPN) connection. VPN connections use a variety 
of protocols to make a secure connection between two systems. We might use a 
VPN when we are connecting from an insecure network, such as the wireless con-
nection in a hotel, to the internal resources secure behind our company firewalls.
At Rest
Protecting data at rest is an area in which security is often lax and is an area in 
which we choose not to emphasize security. Data are considered to be at rest 
when they are on a storage device of some kind and are not moving over a 
network, through a protocol, and so forth. Although it might sound somewhat 

120
CHAPTER 6: 
Protect the Data
illogical, data at rest on media can also be in motion; for example, we might 
ship a load of backup tapes containing sensitive data, carry in our pocket a 
flash drive containing a copy of our tax forms, or leave in the back seat of our 
car a laptop containing the contents of a customer database.
We can see this type of incident on a somewhat disturbing frequency basis 
in the media. In August 2013, the Advocate Medical Group in Park Ridge, 
Illinois, announced it had a breach of personal information due to the theft of 
four computers containing unencrypted storage media. The media contained 
sensitive information such as names, addresses, Social Security numbers, and 
dates of birth of more than 4 million patients [5]. Had the group taken the 
necessary steps to protect its data at rest by encrypting it, not only would it 
have not had such a large security incident, but it also may have been spared 
from having to disclose the incident had occurred, thus saving quite a bit of 
embarrassment [6].
At Use
The last category of protecting data involves securing them while they is being 
used. Although we can use encryption to protect data while they are stored 
or moving across a network, we are somewhat limited in our ability to pro-
tect data while they are being used by those who have legitimate access to 
it. Authorized users can print files, move them to other machines or storage 
devices, email them, share them on peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing networks, 
and make a mockery of our care laid security measures.
In June of 2013, it was discovered classified information containing details 
on the US National Security Agency PRISM program, designed to collect and 
review terrorism-related communications flowing through, in, and out of the 
United States, had been leaked to news agencies by a government contractor 
named Edward Snowden [5,7]. This is a case of sensitive data being lost, but 
we can also see many examples of companies holding and working with data 
sensitive to businesses and individuals on a regular basis.
MAKING USE OF TESTED TECHNOLOGIES
In the information technology field in general, but particularly in the area of 
information security, it is very important to make use of technologies that have 
been tried and tested. For security-focused technologies, algorithms, controls 
of various kinds, and a wide variety of other items that serve the goal of infor-
mation security, it is critical that we use technologies that have been subjected 
to careful scrutiny before being released for public use.
In many cases, it is a relatively small set of architects, designers, and developers 
who are involved in putting a security product together. This product will then 

121
Making Use of Tested Technologies
often be implemented in places where it is subject to the tender ministrations 
of a vast multitude of attackers, security researchers, inept users, trolls, and 
other such horrors. The product will be poked, prodded, abused, and used in 
ways that those designing it never intended, and it must be able to withstand 
all of this without failing in its primary task of providing security.
Customization
Customization in security solutions, even in the case of existing and well-
known technologies, can lead to issues as well. This is not to say that we 
should stick to the stock implementation of the tool or solution in question 
and should not configure it to meet the needs of our environment, but that 
we should not alter it beyond the point of being supportable by our staff and 
the vendor of the tool, and should not make heroic efforts to make the tool 
do things that it was never intended to do. It is all too tempting to make use 
of Application Program Interfaces (APIs), scriptable extensions, direct access to 
database back ends of products, and other similar “under-the-hood” features 
to make a product jump through hoops.
The happy medium here is to customize our security solutions to the point 
where they fit our needs, as can be done within the reasonable and supportable 
bounds of the product, service, or solution. If we take the “my only tool is a 
hammer” approach and attempt to stretch a product to cover an area for which 
it was not intended to serve, then we are only going to cause ourselves, or those 
who come after us, future pain. This goes double for crafting entirely custom 
solutions for complex problems.
Although it is admirable, cost-effective, and an efficient use of resources to 
script out or code a solution to solve an administrative issue or automate a 
repetitive task, there are bounds within which this is reasonable. We can expect 
to be successful in putting together a tool to manage a task such as putting 
together a bash or Powershell script to handle deploying a vendor-provided 
full disk encryption tool to a fleet of laptops. We are much less likely to succeed 
if we also attempt to develop the encryption product itself using Powershell 
as well. Where exactly the bounds are for what is and is not reasonable in this 
area is a judgment call.
Why Developing Your Own Encryption Is a Bad Idea
In addition to what we have already discussed about the security benefits of 
using tested technologies and why excessive customization can cause security 
and a variety of other issues, building custom encryption technologies is a 
special case. Building encryption algorithms and the hardware and/or software 
tools that make use of them is a very difficult task. Cryptography is actually one 
of the fields that make use of very advanced math and a cryptographic tool is 

122
CHAPTER 6: 
Protect the Data
a conjunction of said very advanced math and a relatively fragile set of code 
and hardware to support it. The smallest mistake in development or imple-
mentation can render the entire set of protections null and enable attackers to 
effortlessly glide past the control.
As an example of this, we can look to the flawed encryption used by the Open 
Smart Grid Protocol (OSGP), primarily used in smart meters for electrical 
utilities. The OSGP “is optimized to provide reliable and efficient delivery of 
command and control information for smart meters, direct load control mod-
ules, solar panels, gateways, and other smart grid devices” [8]. The crux of the 
issue, and there are many, with encryption in OSGP is the OMA Digest Message 
Authentication Code (MAC). Several of these issues are described in detail in 
the papers Dumb Crypto in Smart Grids: Practical Cryptanalysis of the Open 
Smart Grid Protocol [9] and Structural Weaknesses in the Open Smart Grid 
Protocol [10], and more were uncovered by a variety of security researchers 
probing the protocol for further weaknesses.
It can be very tempting to create a custom encryption tool, but, as with the 
OSGP example, doing so may lead to considerable rework when flaws with 
the system are discovered down the road. Using carefully developed and tested 
cryptographic tools does not always guarantee a happy result either, but at 
least such tools will have been carefully vetted and simple flaws such as those 
discussed earlier are much more likely to have already been discovered and 
remediated.
ACTIONS
 
Classify data and assign sensitivity and criticality
	n	
All data in the environment need to be assigned levels of sensitivity and criticality. A system 
and accompanying processes need to be developed to maintain data classification and con-
trols must exist to manage data in accordance with it.
Decide how to implement confidentiality
	n	
Confidentiality is generally implemented through encryption. Determine what type of

CHAPTER 7
THIRD PARTY AGREEMENTS
When we are looking to third party agreements, there are a couple of major 
areas of concern: regulatory agreements and security agreements. Regulatory 
agreements are the general container for issues specific to regulated data and 
working through a third party and security agreements are the general set 
of agreements between us and a third party to ensure that strong security is 
upheld. We will talk about both areas.
Regulatory Agreements
In the realm of the regulatory agreements under which we are bound to 
operate, we must also ensure that any third parties that we have engaged in 
handling such data, whether storing, transmitting, or processing, are com-
pliant as well. This can be a tricky area with a third party, as the particulars 
of what exactly needs to happen must be very carefully spelled out.
Defining Sensitive Data
When we are working with a third party and sensitive or potentially sensitive 
data, we need to very carefully define what exactly it is that is sensitive, for what 
reason, and within what parameters.
In a general sense, sensitive data might include:
	
n	 ethnicity or race
	
n	 religious preference
	
n	 sexual preference
	
n	 health details, both physical and mental
	
n	 legal or criminal history
	
n	 full name and/or relative’s names
	
n	 address of residence
	
n	 mailing address
	
n	 Social Security number
	
n	 date of birth
	
n	 biometric details—hair color, eye color, height, weight
Manage the Security of Third Parties  
and Vendors

126
CHAPTER 7: 
Manage the Security of Third Parties and Vendors
	
n	 phone number
	
n	 IP address
	
n	 MAC address
And a dizzying array of other such details. Even within the bounds of an orga-
nization, it can be difficult to say what are and are not sensitive data and how 
any given item of data needs to be protected. When we are dealing with a third 
party, we need to be very explicit about this information. Ultimately, we need 
to very carefully document what we expect of the third party in great detail of 
we expect them to behave in a particular fashion.
Breach Notifications
When working with third parties, we need to be very clear on expectations and 
requirements for notifications from them in the event of a breach. Typically, 
even if a vendor is not directly the cause of a breach, for example, if a payment 
card processor were to suffer a breach and allow unauthorized access to credit 
card transaction information from a particular vendor, it is the primary vendor, 
not the third party, that will end up notifying customers of the issue.
The major concern is the rules and, perhaps even more so important, the con-
tractual language, that governs the third party requirements to report breaches 
that might be of concern to us. In the case of a significant breach, we may need 
to take immediate steps to remediate the issue within our own environments 
by changing credentials, reissuing payment cards, and so on.
Unfortunately, in many cases, breaches are not reported on while they are 
being actively investigated. If it was the case that this had happened, we could 
be continuing to incur damages and not even know that anything untoward 
was taking place.
Industry-Specific Issues
Industry-specific issues, again, may have some overlap with the categories that 
we have already discussed earlier, and more as well. Although the particular 
categories of data may not be changed, the emphasis placed on them may be 
much stronger in some areas. For example, let us look briefly at the retail and 
education industries.
Retail
In the retail industry, most of the concern revolves around the protection of 
payment card data in (hopefully) segmented portions of the environment 
known as the cardholder data environment (CDE) [1]. In the case that we are 
working with third parties, much of the concern will be around making sure 
that they do not have unauthorized access to the CDE, and that the CDE is 
appropriately segmented from the systems that they control.

127
Third Party Agreements
This is a lesson that Target learned the hard way, as the root cause of its 2014 
breach was attackers gaining access through an improperly segmented heating, 
ventilation, and air conditioning system directly from the internet [2].
Education
In the education world, the focus is on protecting students and the data that 
relate to them. Among a variety of administrative controls, rules, and regula-
tions that help to manage the protection of student data in general, we also have 
technical controls in place, similar in a general nature to those for payment or 
healthcare data. In the same sense, educational data must be segmented and 
appropriately secured when stored, in motion, or in use.
Given the stringent federal regulations around educational data, we must be 
very careful when working with third parties that may have any level of access 
to it.
Security Agreements
The security agreements that we put in place with our vendors define how we 
expect them to behave from an information security perspective. Some of the 
main areas that we may want to look at are information security agreements, 
privacy agreements, auditing and monitoring agreements, and foreign corrupt 
practices agreements.
Information Security Agreement
Our information security agreements with third parties are designed to com-
municate to them what our minimum standards are for information security 
and what practices we expect them to follow. These practices, just as our own, 
are designed to ensure the security of our data, our customer data, and our 
information assets in general.
Such agreements are generally built around a security framework of some kind, 
frequently the ISO 27002 control categories:
	
n	 Information security policies
	
n	 Organization of information security
	
n	 Human resource security
	
n	 Asset management
	
n	 Access control
	
n	 Cryptography
	
n	 Physical and environmental security
	
n	 Operation security—procedures and responsibilities, protection from 
malware, backup, logging and monitoring, control of operational 
software, technical vulnerability management, and information systems 
audit coordination

128
CHAPTER 7: 
Manage the Security of Third Parties and Vendors
	
n	 Communication security—network security management and 
information transfer
	
n	 System acquisition, development, and maintenance—security 
requirements of information systems, security in development and 
support processes, and test data
	
n	 Supplier relationships—information security in supplier relationships 
and supplier service delivery management
	
n	 Information security incident management—management of 
information security incidents and improvements
	
n	 Information security aspects of business continuity management—
information security continuity and redundancies
	
n	 Compliance—compliance with legal and contractual requirements and 
information security reviews
ISO 27002 may not be the perfect fit for every environment, but it is a good 
starting place. There are a number of other similar frameworks that may work 
equally as well in a given case.
Information Privacy Agreement
The agreements that we have in place with third parties to protect the privacy 
and confidentiality of our data are highly important in the set of agreements 
that we have with our business associates. We should note that it is a very 
common practice in the business world to share data among companies in the 
same industry, owned by the same parent companies, other business partners, 
and so on, with a relative degree of freedom. If we do not wish our data to be 
shared on such a basis, we need to explicitly build this into our contract lan-
guage so that our intentions are clear.
Additionally, we need to be very clear about the international use of our data. 
In many cases, laws regarding the handling of data vary heavily from one 
country to another. What is a completely unproblematic set of data to collect, 
process, and store in one country may be the start of an international incident 
in another. If we have restrictions on where data may or may not travel geo-
graphically, we need to build this into our third party agreements.
Auditing and Monitoring Agreement
When working with third parties, we need to provide clear responsibility for 
the security of our data at all levels of management, both within our own 
organization and within the third party. Just as is the case within our own 
organization, if we do not clearly communicate our expectations, we should 
not be surprised when they are not met.
We also need to understand what exactly the culture of security is within the orga-
nizations that we have third party relationships with. We should be seeing evidence 
of security training for new hires and also evidence of ongoing security education 

129
Ensuring Compliance
and awareness efforts. Additionally, we need to see evidence that new hires are 
being carefully vetted before they are allowed to handle data of a sensitive nature.
We need to ensure vendors have placed controls around our sensitive data 
being handled by our third party relationships, such as the monitoring, inci-
dent response, use of encryption, data loss prevention tools, system hardening, 
segmentation, and so on. If at any point unusual activity is discovered, we need 
to take swift action to ensure that issues are resolved.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Agreement
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (FCPA) is primarily concerned with 
transparency as pertains to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the 
bribery of anyone through personal payments, gifts, etc. Companies can also 
be held liable for the actions of third parties under the FCPA. This is primarily 
done to keep companies from acting through other companies to escape the 
results of their actions.
When working with third parties, we need to carefully monitor for anything 
that might be criminal activity and take immediate action on it if such practices 
are found. If our organization is found to have had knowledge of any such 
activities, or to have been “willfully blind” to them, we may be held responsi-
ble for resulting issues. We need to put processes in place to monitor and audit 
the activities of our third party relationships so that we can detect any abnor-
malities that might indicate unusual discounting, price changes, or other such 
activities that might be used to cover up bribery.
ENSURING COMPLIANCE
In our agreements with third parties, we need to work diligently to ensure 
that they are maintaining compliance with both what we have directly agreed 
between us when developing the relationship with the other organization, 
as well as the regulatory requirements that both organizations are bound by. 
We can do this through the risk assessment mechanism, as well as various 
enforcement mechanisms that we may choose to use.
Risk Assessment
In our third party relationships, just as within our own organizations, we can 
use risk assessments to help surface some of the issues that we may run into 
later and deal with them before they become much larger problems. There are 
a few areas in which we may want to specifically focus our risk management 
efforts as pertaining to external organizations:
	
n	 network connectivity
	
n	 data handling

130
CHAPTER 7: 
Manage the Security of Third Parties and Vendors
	
n	 data destruction
	
n	 employment practices
	
n	 physical security
Network connectivity can be a particularly sensitive area when it comes to 
allowing others to connect to our infrastructure. Whether this is indirect 
through the use of applications, or a site-to-site virtual private network con-
nection, there is risk involved and we must ensure that any outside entities are 
appropriately restricted in terms of access, segmented off from areas that they 
do not need access to, and monitored appropriately.
Data handling is an enormous issue when we are sharing data with outside 
organizations. The potential for such efforts to work out in an undesirable 
fashion can be very large, particularly when we are working with sensitive data 
or regulated data. We need to carefully put controls in place to ensure that our 
data are protected in use, in motion, and at rest.
Data destruction is at least equally important to protect as data handling is. If 
our data are not disposed of properly, we may very well end up on the news 
due a box of printer out customer data being found in a dumpster. All of our 
data should be carefully controlled, and disposed of in a secure and certified 
manner, which is then reported back to us on a regular basis.
The employment practices of third parties should also be of great concern to us. 
If the other organization is not carefully screening new potential hires, as well as 
background checking them, conducting credit inquiries, drug testing, etc., then 
we have no idea who it is that will be handling our data. We should expect a 
hiring standard from third parties to be at least as strong as our own. In the case 
where those being hired are overseas, we need to be even more careful. The dif-
fering laws in other countries as relates to hiring, personal data, and any other 
such HR-related issues are an area in which we should tread very carefully.
Physical security is also an area in which we need to take great care. An old saw 
of information security is that it is “game over” if we lose the ability to control 
the physical security of the environment in which our information assets are 
housed. We should carefully review the physical environments of our third 
party associates to ensure that they are adequately constructed. In particular, if 
we are in a situation where the third party has direct network connectivity to 
use, we might find ourselves in a situation where their physical compromise 
results in a situation where attackers are able to bypass our network security 
entirely though something as simple as social engineering.
Enforcement Mechanisms
There are a number of mechanisms that we can use as part of our efforts to enforce 
compliance in third party relationships. Among them are auditing and monitor-
ing, oversight, reporting, third party reviews, and, if need be, termination.

131
Ensuring Compliance
Auditing and Monitoring
Once our business relationship has been established, we need to perform 
ongoing monitoring to be sure of our ability to manage the risks around work-
ing closely with another organization. Just as we would with our internal risk 
assessments, we need to be aware of changes in the environment, processes, 
technologies used, and any of a number of other such factors.
In general, we will want to perform audits on a cyclical basis, once per year being 
a common interval for this. We may elect to conduct such audits ourselves, or we 
may decide to outsource this function to an external partner that specializes in 
such functions. We will discuss the use of external auditors later in this section.
We may also want to build performance measurements in our contracts with 
third parties. This gives us a solid baseline to measure compliance against when 
we are auditing and gives the third party organization a clear set of goals that 
they need to accomplish, as well as a way of reporting associated risks within 
our own organization. As with many contractual stipulations, there may also 
be penalties specified with noncompliance on the third party’s end.
Third Party Reviews
Third party reviews give us the opportunity to have a consistent and unbiased 
review that will give us solid evidence as to whether our business partners are 
behaving in the manner that we expect them to. Such reviews are typically con-
ducted on an annual basis and there are many consulting companies that are 
willing and able to conduct such reviews around the globe. Some of the more 
common types of standardized reviews might include:
	
n	 PCI DSS (Payment card industry data security standard) certification
	
n	 ISO 27002 certification
	
n	 OWASP (Open web application security project) Application Security 
Verification Standard certification
	
n	 SAS (Statement on auditing standards) 70 Type II
	
n	 SSAE-16 (Statement on standards for attestation engagements)
	
n	 Verizon Cybertrust
	
n	 SOC (Service organization controls) 1,2,&3
Although none of these is the proverbial “magic bullet” that will guarantee 
the absolute security, they do provide us with a certain level of baseline for 
how the organization being evaluated handles information security and risk 
management within their environments. In many cases, one or more of these 
reviews are considered to be the minimum bar to conduct business in certain 
industries.
Reporting
Properly documenting and reporting the state of our third party relation-
ships enables oversight, monitoring, and risk management in general. Such 

132
CHAPTER 7: 
Manage the Security of Third Parties and Vendors
documentation and associated reporting is typically metrics driven, some of 
which might include:
	
n	 degree of compliance with security requirements
	
n	 number of incidents
	
n	 incident resolution rate and time
	
n	 organizational financial condition
	
n	 insurance coverage
	
n	 service level agreement compliance
As with similar discussions we have had throughout this book regarding metrics, 
we will typically roll these up into a set of key performance indicators to report 
performance in broad categories across all of our third party relationships. 
Typically such reporting is done at an executive management or board level to 
enable these levels of management to develop and update our organizational 
strategy as relates to our third party business partners.
Termination
As a last resort, we should develop a plan and contingencies for transitioning 
away from the third party relationship in which we are involved. This may 
happen through breach of contract, failure to satisfy the terms of the contract, 
contracts ending, organizational changes on one side or the other, or any of a 
number of such occurrences.
We should have several plans for this eventuality, potentially including 
bringing the functions back in-house, transferring them to a different third 
party, changing the processes being used entirely, and so on. This is an area 
in which we should plan both carefully and in advance. If we have not done 
so, we may find ourselves locked into a relationship by a particular issue, 
for example, simply for lacking the technical means or resources to move 
from one environment to another. Cloud services can be particularly tricky 
in this regard.

CHAPTER 8
PARTNERING WITH STAKEHOLDERS
To successfully launch and maintain a security awareness and training pro-
gram, we need to partner with the stakeholders that have an interest in seeing 
such a program succeed. If we do not have support of the right stakeholders, we 
are very likely to fail in our efforts. Security awareness and training are a critical 
part of the information security program and such efforts need to be carefully 
planned, socialized, and supported if they are to be of any effect.
Who Are the Stakeholders for Security Training?
Although the specific stakeholders for our security awareness and training pro-
gram are very likely to vary from one organization to the next, there are several 
categories of people that we will commonly see represented. From the top down, 
stakeholders generally include our board of directors, senior management, man-
agement, and employees. Let us look at each of these groups and talk about why 
they have a stake in our security awareness and training program.
Board of Directors
The board has a fiduciary responsibility to represent and protect the interests of the 
employees, investors, and customers. The board is one of the main, if not the main 
stakeholder in properly training those that work for the organization on how to 
behave in a secure manner. As the board is responsible for protecting the assets of 
the company, it is ultimately and directly responsible for security issues that occur.

INFORMATION IN THIS CHAPTER:
Conduct Security Awareness and Training

136
CHAPTER 8: 
Conduct Security Awareness and Training
In some cases, members of the board and/or executives may even be held per-
sonally responsible in the case of particularly egregious breach or incident. In 
2014 during the Palkon v. Holmes case, a shareholder of Wyndham Worldwide 
Corporation directly sued members of Wyndam’s board, claiming failure to 
implement strong enough information security policies enabled repeated data 
breaches and large losses of customer data [1].
Security training can benefit the board in several ways. Perhaps in one of the 
most obvious ways, it can help to prevent the members of the board from 
being held personally responsible for incidents that occur. Of course, hav-
ing a security awareness and training program will not directly prevent such 
incidents from taking place, but properly trained users are much less likely 
to unknowingly cause such incidents to take place because of lack of training 
that told them what the security behavior expected of them actually was. We 
should also consider security training for the members of the board directly. 
As they are dealing with some of the most sensitive data that can be found in 
the organization, from a strategic perspective, they should not be overlooked 
in our efforts.
Secure practices, to a certain extent, as part and parcel of our awareness 
and training program can also help to drive business to the organization. 
Particularly in case where sensitive data are being handled by the company, 
customers and business partners will often want to know some level of detail 
regarding how their data are protected. Particularly in the wake of several years 
of major data breaches from large public companies like Target and Home 
Depot the need for sound security practices is much more in the public eye. We 
might very well find that customers and business partners are willing to seek 
out other business opportunities if our organization is unable to demonstrate 
that it has some level of commitment to sound security practices.
Management
Management, including all management from officers of the company to proj-
ect managers, has a vested interest in a strong information security program 
being in place.
Management needs to be informed about security risks to critical assets and 
what the potential impacts of these might be, as well as the current state asset 
protection and legal and regulatory compliance. For all or any of this to hap-
pen successfully, we need to have a well-educated security staff, an end point 
that is reached through the implementation and execution of a security aware-
ness and training program that includes and supports providing the required 
information.
The members of management are also responsible for ensuring that the com-
pany succeeds in its aims and goals and part of this effort is making sure that 
the assets of the company are secure.

137
Partnering With Stakeholders
Security awareness and training benefit management in two major ways. Such 
programs help to ensure that the organization and its assets are secure, and 
they also help to ensure that incidents are handled in an appropriate manner.
Keeping the organization’s assets secure is an effort that spans the entire company. 
From management to engineering and development, down to the lowliest admin 
maintaining the email server starting their first day on the job, information secu-
rity hinges on every person making security decisions as they move through their 
day and carry out the tasks that are required of them. A large portion of making 
sure that this happens in the way that we would like to is to support the security 
programs that help to ensure behavior trending in the direction that we would like.
Secondly, management would like us to handle incidents in an appropriate 
manner. We would expect the incident response team to be well trained in 
how to specifically respond to an incident, but this team will likely not be the 
very first team on the scene in many cases. We also need those who detect and 
report the issue or work in the vicinity of the equipment involved with it to 
behave securely. As these behaviors, at least in terms of incidents, involve not 
following the natural inclination to start digging into the problem, this is defi-
nitely an area in which specific training is required for a large set of personnel.
Individual Contributors
As we have discussed repeatedly in the last several sections, we expect quite 
a lot out of individual contributors in terms of security behaviors. We expect 
them to safeguard data when they are of a sensitive nature, to report incidents 
appropriately but not interfere to the extent of causing issues for those who 
will be investigating later, and numerous other security bits and pieces. For 
those who are not in information security or information technology (IT), this 
can be a daunting set of tasks, some of which may seem nonsensical or even 
counterintuitive. Individual contributors definitely have a stake in how the 
security awareness and training program is constructed and carried out, as they 
are ultimately the end audience for what is produced.
Individual contributors can provide us with a considerable amount of feedback as 
we put our awareness program together. From the standpoint of information secu-
rity, much as is the case of any other specialized field inside or outside of technol-
ogy, many of these policies and processes seem to make inherent sense to us. We 
are surprised when people make decisions that do not parallel what we expect for 
user behavior. Unfortunately, this is not a reasonable expectation without training.
Security awareness and training benefit individual contributors by giving them a 
definition for what we expect them to do, how we expect them to do it, and under 
what circumstances they should be doing what. Such items should be based on 
our security processes and policies. Without defining the rules of the game for 
them, we cannot very well expect them to play it properly, if at all. If we can care-
fully define what we expect of them, we will all be considerably more successful.

138
CHAPTER 8: 
Conduct Security Awareness and Training
TARGETING TRAINING NEEDS FOR THE AUDIENCE
When we conduct security awareness and training, we need to be careful to tai-
lor it to the various audiences that we will be interfacing with. If we do not do 
so, we will likely experience issues in communication and render the training 
considerably less effective by delivering overly technical content to nontech-
nically savvy audiences and information at too high of a level to technical 
audiences. There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all security training pro-
gram that will be effective for all audiences. In broad categories, we will need 
to customize our training for the general audience, various technical staff, and 
management. We are more likely to carry this out in a successful manner by 
developing a general training that can be delivered to everyone, then providing 
additional training for those who need specialized content.
Training for All Staff
When we produce training intended for all of our staff, we should be careful 
to use less technical jargon and detail and put more emphasis on explain-
ing things in relatable terms. The typical set of topics for such training might 
include:
	
n	 passwords
	
n	 internet usage
	
n	 social engineering
	
n	 malware
	
n	 social media
	
n	 sensitive data
	
n	 information security policies
We will briefly look at each of these areas and the typical items that are covered.
Passwords
	
n	 Do not write passwords down—Users should understand the dangers of 
recording passwords in an insecure manner.
	
n	 Do not share passwords—Users should understand that their login 
credentials are specifically attached to them as individuals.
	
n	 Do not create passwords from personal information—Users should

Additional Training for Technical Staff
When we are training technical staff, we will cover, at some level, the same 
items as we will for all staff, but at a greater level of detail and with more 
technical explanations. In addition to these items, we will also cover areas that 
relate to their specific area of responsibility in technology. Typically this means 
additional training for IT staff and for developers. This audience has greater 
access and needs role-based training to understand the risks they take by sim-
ple acts like using their admin login for everyday access.
Information Technology Staff
Our IT staff will often be exposed to security-related situations and incidents, 
will have a greater level of exposure to sensitive data, and will be responsible 
for maintaining the infrastructure on which the organization runs. Given these 
responsibilities, this staff will need additional training so that they know how 
they are expected to handle these responsibilities and accesses.

141
Targeting Training Needs for the Audience
Incident Reporting and Response
Even if they are not directly part of the information security team, IT staff will 
often be in a position that exposes them to security-related situations or inci-
dents. The IT staff should understand how to handle these situations properly, 
including whom they should call or notify if they think an incident might be 
occurring, how they should respond directly they are responsible for doing so, 
and so on. In many cases, staff responding improperly to an incident can make 
the situation considerably worse for doing so. At the very least, they should 
know where to go to look up the process or procedure that defines how they 
should respond to a given situation.
Data Protection
IT staff should understand what their responsibilities are in the area of data 
protection. Given their position, they will likely be exposed to a variety of 
sensitive or regulated data, perhaps bound by a variety of international laws 
on top of whatever regulatory requirements exist. Given the potentially very 
complex web of requirements for protecting such data, we should ensure 
that our expectations are carefully defined for how these situations should be 
handled. For those working specifically with regulated data such as that gov-
erned by Payment Card Industry (PCI) or Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA), training specific to these areas may be needed 
or required.
Environmental Security
IT staff will often be responsible for maintaining the security of the environ-
ment. They should understand what is required of them for typical IT activities 
such as installing patches, updating software, creating backups, onboarding 
and off boarding users, securely installing equipment, disposing of equipment 
and media, or any of a number of other similar tasks for which the IT staff is 
responsible on a daily basis. This can be one of the broadest and most critical 
areas for training as a poorly or insecurely maintained environment can be the 
cause for an innumerable amount of issues further down the road.
Software Development
Software developers and software engineers are in a position to greatly help or 
harm the overall security posture of the products for which they are respon-
sible. In many cases, the reputation of the organization in general can suffer 
grave damage if the products that it produces develop a reputation for being 
insecure. Adobe, a company much maligned for producing products with a 
wide variety of security flaws has had many issues with exactly this situation 
over the years and has taken steps such as renaming its particularly security 
bug-stricken Flash product, a move though by some to be designed to shed 
some of the damaged confidence in the process [2].

142
CHAPTER 8: 
Conduct Security Awareness and Training
Secure Software Development
Although it might seem like developing software in a secure manner would 
be relatively simple and intuitive, this is anything but the case. Developing 
software securely is a very difficult task, exacerbated by the fact that each lan-
guage has some set of different problem areas on top of the common areas that 
plague all programming languages. For a developer to code securely in a new 
language they need to understand the security peculiarities of that language 
and what needs to be done to work around them. In short, each language that 
we are working with in our development efforts will require at least some addi-
tional training for our developers to write security code in it.
Vulnerabilities
Although there are a wide variety of potential software vulnerabilities, most of 
them fall into a few main categories [3]:
	
n	 buffer overflows
	
n	 invalidated input
	
n	 race conditions
	
n	 access-control problems
	
n	 weaknesses in authentication, authorization, or cryptographic practices
Although this information is useful at a high level, developers need to be able 
to recognize these types of vulnerabilities and understand what the impact of 
them is in the software that they are developing. Although part of this equation 
comes with security software development training, a solid understanding of 
specifically why these sets of vulnerabilities are problematic can be invaluable.
The OWASP (open web application security project) top 10 list,1 although specific to web 
applications, can be of great utility for understanding application vulnerabilities. For each of 
the 10 areas we will find a very detailed explanation of the vulnerability, how to detect it, how 
to prevent it, and a detailed example of how an attack on the issue might be carried out.

TIP
Software Development Life Cycle
The inclusion of security into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a key 
area to include in training for developers. There are a nearly innumerable variety 
of approaches to this with one of the commonly used being the Microsoft Secure 
Development Lifecycle (SDL) [4]. The SDL process includes training, requirements, 
design, implementation, verification, release, and response, as shown in Fig. 8.1.

143
Targeting Training Needs for the Audience
Although it is not particularly important that the SDL process specifically be 
the one to be followed, it is important there be some methods of ensuring that 
security is adequately represented in the SDLC.
Training for Management
In addition to the general areas that we discussed earlier managers need a leader-
ship-appropriate version of the technical training that we discussed earlier and also 
need to know how to promote the security message. Additionally, they need to 
know what they are responsible and accountable for the security of.
Compliance
Managers need to understand the requirements that they and those that work for 
them have for compliance. In many cases, especially in technology management, 
there will be a variety of compliance requirements brought about by sensitive 
data that fall under their purview. PCI, PII (personally identifiable information), 
PHI (protected health information), HIPAA, NERC (North American Electric 
Reliability Corporation), and any number of other types of regulated data bring 
with them varied and sometimes conflict sets of rules and it is vital that ­managers 
have a sufficient understanding of the controls that govern these areas.
In addition to regulatory compliance, managers also need to understand what 
internal policies and procedures govern their daily activities. To provide guid-
ance for the personnel, programs, and services for which they are responsible, 
we need to be sure that our managers are properly trained on what the partic-
ulars and expectations are and how to appropriately communicate the security 
message for these areas.
Sensitive and Regulated Data
In the area of sensitive and regulated data, in addition to the compliance 
requirements already discussed earlier in this chapter, managers need to under-
stand specifically what information is sensitive and what rules govern the use 
of said data in any form in which they might appear.
Managers also need to know what their requirements are for loss of sen-
sitive and regulated data, as it is all too common for such data to be acci-
dentally divulged, lost, or otherwise inappropriately exposed. Additionally, 
they should know what, if any, their responsibilities are for reporting such

Conduct Security Awareness and Training
data losses to victims or customers, or at least how to contact the party in 
the organization responsible for such notifications.
Another major area of data handling in which managers need to be trained 
is what the requirements are for disposal of sensitive or regulated data and 
what policies or procedures govern such activities. Inappropriate or insecure 
disposal of sensitive data could lead directly to a major breach.
Enforcing Security Policy
Managers should understand the requirements for enforcing security policy 
and secure practices for which they are responsible. Managers should be able to 
walk through an area and look for policy issues such as unsecured or improp-
erly discarded sensitive data such as credentials written down and posted in 
working areas, printer matter of a sensitive nature left on printers, or other 
issues such as unlocked and unattended workstations or secured doors that 
have been propped open. They should also understand what the requirements 
are for reporting such issues when they are found.
We should also educate managers on the need to fairly and consistently enforce 
security policies. Security policies are in place to protect the organization and 
its customers and need to be followed uniformly. Inconsistent application of 
security policies can lead to a number of negative endings, including enabling 
attackers to successfully penetrate the security controls around our organiza-
tion’s environments.
Incident Response
Even, or perhaps especially, in the case where a manager is not part of a tech-
nology organization or of information security, he or she should have at least a 
high-level idea of what should and should not be done in the case of a security 
incident, whether the incident is internal or external in origin.
They should understand that data, hosts, and networks involved in a secu-
rity incident need to be handled based on established processes so as not to, 
whether accidentally or purposefully, alter any evidence of what exactly took 
place. They should understand that tampering with any involved systems may 
render data that might later be used to investigate what exactly took place, or 
perhaps even legally prosecute those involved, unusable entirely. Particularly 
in the case of issues involving internal personnel, we should very carefully 
communicate what is expected of a manager in these types of situations.
TRAINING AND AWARENESS METHODS
There are a number of ways and means that we can use to communicate 
our training and awareness efforts to our user base. We can conduct training 
classes with a live instructor; employ computer-based training; provide various 

145
Training and Awareness Methods
security-related media to users, play games, or run contests that have a security 
focus; give away items designed to bring security to mind, or any of a great 
number of other methods. The important part is not that we do any particu-
lar thing, but that we communicate effectively and are successful at modify-
ing user behavior in a positive direction. Additionally, it must be done often; 
annual training is not effective in modifying behaviors. Ultimately, a successful 
program will more than likely end up employing a variety of methods.
Instructor-Led Training
Instructor-led training, as it sounds, is the traditional training scheme with a 
group of people listening to the instructor talk in real time. This could mean 
that a group of people gather in a single location or that the instructor is 
broadcast while speaking. This method is particularly useful where the people  
being trained are central to an office or location where new hire intake takes 
place.
One of the most important parts of this method is that it allows the instructor 
in interact with the audience in some fashion. This interaction enables the 
audience to ask questions of the instructor and the instructor to engage the 
audience by asking questions of them and by prompting them to relay their 
personal experiences with the subject matter being discussed at any given time. 
To allow this to happen, classes must be smaller (10–20 people).
Audience involvement is critical to ensuring that the subject matter is being grasped 
by the audience and provides some opportunity for in-flight modification of the 
content to suit a particular audience. Ultimately, this provides a better and more 
engaging experience for both the instructor and the audience and will result in 
an overall more successful training. Retention from these classes is always higher.
Although somewhat less desirable, instructor-led training can also be recorded 
for future playback by those who were not present for the training or who were 
unable to attend at the time of its delivery. Although this does not provide the 
valuable opportunity for audience feedback, it can still be of some value. In the 
case that recorded training is to be used as the primary method of delivery, it 
should be followed up with some other method of ensuring audience engage-
ment, such as quiz or other test of knowledge. Otherwise all we are ensuring 
is the ability of our audience to tolerate background noise for a period of time 
(or fast forward through it).
Computer-Based Training
Computer-based training, often referred to as CBTs, can be a very handy 
method of delivering training to large or widely distributed groups of people 
where having them in a single location is not desirable or feasible. CBTs gen-
erally enable users to work on training at a time and place of their choosing, 
although often impose some deadline for the training to be accomplished.

146
CHAPTER 8: 
Conduct Security Awareness and Training
CBTs can vary widely in quality. On the low end, they may be nothing more than 
a slide presentation that requires the user to click on each slide to move through 
it in a “death by PowerPoint fashion.” Just as is the case when sitting through 
a meeting consisting of a slide deck being read by someone, this does not gen-
erally provide a strong method of communicating important concepts to users.
On the opposite end of the CBT quality spectrum, such training can incor-
porate multimedia, periodic activities designed to require input and activity 
from the user such as clicking and dragging matching items, small incremental 
knowledge checks, and so on. These require a much higher level of engage-
ment from the user to proceed through the training and often culminate with 
an overall assessment of how well the user absorbed the concepts.
In addition to standard training of a presentation-oriented nature, some train-
ing providers even offer security-themed training games and activities. These 
can be of particular utility in environments that include a larger number of 
younger or technologically skilled users.
In general the computer training environment can provide us with the oppor-
tunity to step slightly outside of the bounds of the standard training paradigm. 
Novel activities such as games can provide us with an opportunity to reach 
users more effectively.
Games/Contests
Gamification is “the process of adding games or game like elements to some-
thing (as a task) so as to encourage participation” [5]. Elements of gamification 
that apply to security awareness and training might include items such as:
	
n	 narrative/story
	
n	 social aspects (networking, status, pressure)
	
n	 measurements of progress (points, levels, badges, scoreboards)
	
n	 clear goals
	
n	 challenges and challenges of increasing complexity
	
n	 collaborative problem solving
	
n	 time-dependent rewards
	
n	 competition
	
n	 collecting/trading
If we couch our training, awareness, and evaluation efforts in the form of a 
game, we are considerably more likely to find willing participants. Few people 
will willingly spend time in training that does not directly impact their present 
or desired set of responsibilities, but many will cheerfully while away the hours 
in playing a game.
One very easy to setup and conduct example that fits very nicely with the stan-
dard instructor-led security training class is the quiz show. We can quickly put 

147
Training and Awareness Methods
together a quiz show based on the common Jeopardy framework with catego-
ries based on our particular training efforts, such as that shown in Fig. 8.2.
This particular case touches on every one of the gamification elements that we 
mentioned earlier and lends quite a different atmosphere to what might other-
wise be a relatively boring training class for those who do not have an inherent 
interest in information security. Ultimately, as with many of the other methods 
that we use for communicating security awareness topics, the more interesting 
and unusual methods will typically enjoy a much higher level of success. Novel 
methods will often stick with our trainees far better than the standard training 
“death by PowerPoint” tactics that seem to be all too unfortunately common 
in training classes the world over.
Security-Related Media
We can make use of a variety of security-related media items in support of our 
training and awareness efforts. This might include items such as:
	
n	 posters
	
n	 flyers
	
n	 newsletters
FIGURE 8.2
Security quiz show.

148
CHAPTER 8: 
Conduct Security Awareness and Training
	
n	 security-branded notepads or sticky notes
	
n	 comics
	
n	 videos
	
n	 screensavers
	
n	 computer desktop backgrounds
Or any of a variety of other such vehicles. Although none of these items in iso-
lation amounts to much, each of them draws attention to our program every 
time that someone sees, uses, or interacts with one of them. Media such as 
posters can easily be distributed to and displayed in a variety of areas, typically 
in gathering places such as break rooms, cafeterias, and other places where 
people will spend time sitting or standing in line.
Desk items such as sticky notes, screensavers, and desktop backgrounds can 
also be particularly effective, as these are often in close proximity to users for 
extended periods of time and will be noticed by them repeatedly, even if only 
for short periods of time as they move from one task to another.
A key item for any security-related media is that it will quickly age to the point 
of being unnoticed if it is not periodically refreshed. It is important to keep 
a relatively short cycle of updates to such items, where resources reasonably 
allow for this to happen. In the case of more costly items, such as higher-­quality 
copies of printed posters, we can achieve this by rotating material from one 
location to another. In this way, at least the items in specific areas will change 
and be fresh to those who do not see all of the items across all locations. Novel 
or somewhat clever media items, such as the poster shown in Fig. 8.3 [6] will  
often draw more attention as well.
Giveaways
Giveaways are the standard items that we commonly see as conference 
Souvenirs, Wearables, and Gifts, i.e., t-shirts, pens, mugs, stress balls, small 
windup toys, and any of a number of other such items. Just as vendors at con-
ferences give away branded examples of such items, we can use this same tactic 
to gain ongoing awareness of our security programs.
We can use giveaway items in a variety of ways. We can simply give them to 
people, such as those participating in information security training. If we send 
people away from our training with a security program branded pen or mug, 
we stand a slightly higher chance of having security pop into their mind when-
ever they use the item in question.
Perhaps more effectively, we can use giveaways as prizes for other security activ-
ities. If we can equate success or desirable actions with a physical prize, this 
can lend our item some level of status. This is a variety of gamification, as we 
discussed earlier in this chapter In this way, not only can we give away more 

149
Evaluate the Effectiveness of Training
interesting items, as there will be presumably less of them than the security 
pen that we might give to everyone we train, but they can draw attention and 
awareness to the security program as well.
As we have said before in this chapter, every little bit helps when we are pro-
moting security awareness. If we gain some level of increased security and pos-
itively modified behavior as a result of earmarking a tiny bit of our security 
budget for a few trinkets, then this is money well spent.
EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TRAINING
The real measure of training effectiveness comes when we evaluate explicit 
measures of our success. In many cases, this will mean developing metrics that 
we can use for such evaluation. We might, for example, count the number of 
incidents reported by users to determine whether we saw an increase or decline 
in incidents based on our training.
FIGURE 8.3
Security awareness poster.

150
CHAPTER 8: 
Conduct Security Awareness and Training
We may also choose to go with a more “rubber meets the road” type of eval-
uation and conduct activities like directly testing the responses of our users 
through activities, contests, or events or their reactions to realistic attack sit-
uations by including interacting with them in the scope of a penetration test.
Finally we need to conduct survey where our customers evaluate the secu-
rity team for things like clear and understandable policies, useful training, 
and easy-to-follow processes. Open source tools like SurveyMonkey are 
useful for this.
Effectiveness Metrics
When we are developing metrics to measure our security awareness and train-
ing program, there are two major places that are useful for us to gather such 
data: the deployment of the program and the impact that the program is hav-
ing as and after we have rolled it out. This does not preclude further metrics 
for measuring the progress of such a program, but these are common areas to 
measure when such programs are first being rolled out. More mature programs 
will likely see an ongoing change in metrics over time.
Metrics to measure deployment might include items such as [7]:
	
n	 Training completion—Number of users who have completed security 
awareness training.
	
n	 Communication methods—Types of training, who communication is 
directed to, and at what interval.
	
n	 Policy sign-off—Ensuring users have completed training, and signed an 
agreement of understanding of the policies.
Metrics to measure the impact of the program [7]:
	
n	 Phishing awareness—Number of people who failed during a phishing 
assessment.
	
n	 Phishing detection—Number of people who failed succeeded during a 
phishing assessment.
	
n	 Infected computers—Number of infected systems.
	
n	 Updated devices—Percentage of devices that are appropriately patched.
	
n	 Lost/stolen devices—Number of devices lost or stolen over a given 
period of time.
	
n	 Secure desktop—Number of users who lock their workstation while 
away from it.
	
n	 Passwords—Number of people using strong/complex passwords.
	
n	 Social engineering—Number of people who failed during a social 
engineering assessment.
	
n	 Sensitive data—Number of users posting sensitive company 
information on public facing media.

151
Evaluate the Effectiveness of Training
	
n	 Data wiping or destruction—Number of users properly following data 
destruction policies/processes.
	
n	 Facility physical security—Number of users who follow and enforce 
policies around physical access to facilities.
These metrics are, of course, simply a starting point on which to base a set mea-
sures that are appropriate for a specific organization. In any given environment 
the security focus will have particular emphases, i.e., credit cards, health care 
data, etc., and the security awareness metrics should be adjusted in accordance 
with these priorities. The key is to develop metrics that facilitate understanding 
and allow the capability owner to make an informed decision.
Counting Incidents
Counting incidents is one way that we can use to measure the effectiveness 
of our security awareness program. Logically, when we increase the level of 
training for how to respond to security incidents in our user population, and 
increase the level of awareness for such incidents existing in the first place, we 
would expect to see the number of reported security incidents go down, if not 
go down rather sharply. After all, our well-trained cadre of users should now 
be out making a more secure workplace as they carry out their appointed tasks, 
should they not? Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, no.
For example, what we can expect to see, when we have rolled out our aware-
ness program in full force, is a sharp uptick in reported security incidents. Why 
would this be? For several reasons.
First, we have drawn awareness to security incidents existing. Although some 
subset of our users would have previously been both technically savvy enough 
and security aware enough to spot such incidents before our training, the gen-
eral user population would not. We have given them a new set of tools and 
exhorted them to make use of them in the course of their daily activities. This 
means that we have now increased the likelihood that security issues will be 
detected and reported through the proper channels.
Second, we have greatly sensitized our users to the potential for security inci-
dents to exist, whether they actually exist or not. For some period of time, 
we will likely see an uptick in jumping at shadows as relates to information 
security. We will get reports about every odd looking email, strange soliciting 
phone call, USB drive found in the hallway, and a wide variety of other such 
“incidents.” This will calm down over time and as the idea of security aware-
ness becomes less of a brand new thing.
Ultimately, we are likely to see sharp uptick in incidents, subsiding to a some-
what lesser level over time, but ultimately at a higher level than before we 
started the program. This is both a normal and a healthy expected result.

152
CHAPTER 8: 
Conduct Security Awareness and Training
Testing Users
In this particular case, when we say testing this does not refer to penetration 
testing (we will come back to that momentarily). There are a variety of ways 
that we can test users before we proceed on to the rather heavy (and sometimes 
expensive) process of penetration testing.
When we are conducting training, and shortly after, we can literally test 
user behavior and knowledge. As we discussed earlier when discussing 
­instructor-led training and CBTs, we can include quizzes and tests during and 
after training as a knowledge check. From a training perspective, this forces 
users to pay some level of attention when they would otherwise be staring out 
the window and wishing that they were somewhere else other than “wasting” 
a block of time in a training class. This gives us the opportunity to at least see 
if they were paying attention, although it may be somewhat boring.
As we discussed earlier in the section on gamification, we can also couch such 
testing in the form of a game. If we add elements of a game and of competition 
to our testing, we can sneak such evaluation on users while they are having 
fun. This also tends to give us a better result for purposes of evaluation, as we 
may have a larger share of the trainees’ attention that we might have with a less 
enjoyable activity such as a quiz.
We can also conduct testing activities that edge more toward the direction of 
penetration testing without quite going all the way there. For example, we 
might try a very simple test of a particular item that we discussed in training. 
An easy case of this would be seeding a few USB drives around our facility 
with a “phone home” utility on them to see who picked them up and inserted 
them in a workstation. Numerous such tests could be conducted at a very small 
expense and a great return in terms of information about the secure or insecure 
behavior of our users. As we do this training it is important to decide if you are 
going to reward good behavior or openly punish poor performance and build 
the program to meet the style you feel is most effective.
Penetration Testing
Penetration testing is ultimately as close as we can get to a real world measure 
of the effectiveness of our training and awareness program. The ultimate goal 
of our program is to modify the behavior of our users in a more secure direc-
tion. When we conduct a penetration test, we can include in the scope items 
that test the reactions of our personnel in certain areas.
The most obvious of these categories is the broad category of social engineer-
ing attacks. Fortunately, such attacks are very easy to measure for success or 
failure; either the users fell prey to the attack or they did not. Some of the more 
obvious candidates for these types of attacks include standard social engineer-
ing efforts such as phishing email or phone calls, with the pretext and payload 

153
Evaluate the Effectiveness of Training
of such attacks being tuned to be feasible in the environment in which they are 
being conducted.
We can also intentionally include in our penetration testing items that should 
warn users of unusual activity taking place, such as unusual system loads or 
behaviors, attacks that we know will set off alert processes, attacks that are 
calculated to push users into areas where there are document process to be fol-
lowed (such as requesting permission for a particular activity or process to be 
executed), and so on. If our users do not respond to the intentionally unusual 
activity in the proper fashion, or for that matter do not notice that it is taking 
place at all, then we know that we have further training to conduct and/or new 
areas in which we should focus our program to a greater extent.
Penetration testing, in particular the people-oriented portions, is a particularly 
important part of our security awareness and training program. In case after 
case where major breaches have happened, human failures to take appropriate 
actions have been at the heart of the failure to detect and block the inciting 
attack. Unfortunately, fixing such issues is not something that we can carry out 
with a simple technology purchase or configuration change. Fixing the inse-
cure behaviors of people is a difficult prospect indeed. Ultimately penetrating 
testing will validate our incident response tools and training.
Report on Training Effectiveness
As with any other part of our security program, we will need to, at some point, 
report to our management on the effectiveness of our program. It is likely that 
the metrics that we discussed at the beginning of this section will feature heav-
ily in such reporting. Although the full array of metrics may contain a greater 
level of detail than is useful or desirable for such reporting, they can certainly 
be used to inform in. Key performance indicators (KPIs) may be one useful way 
of rolling our metrics up into an easily reportable form to provide detail at a 
Goldilocks level (not too little, not too much, just right). KPIs are “quantifiable 
measurements, agreed to beforehand, that reflect the critical success factors of 
an organization” [8]. In the case of the metrics that we discussed earlier, we 
might have two KPIs to express the health of our security awareness program: 
one for the rollout of the program and another for the impact of the program.
The KPI for the rollout of the program, based on our metrics, would likely indicate 
the percentage of the user base that had been trained, with the ongoing state of the 
KPI being based on employee turnover versus training over time. In this fashion, 
we do not deliver the details of the individual metrics but can provide an overall 
view of the percentage of employees that are adequately trained at any given time.
Our KPI for impact, if we were trying to boil our collection of impact metrics 
up into a single item of performance data, would likely revolve around the 
metrics that indicate how our users performed when tested for appropriate 

154
CHAPTER 8: 
Conduct Security Awareness and Training
response to a set of situations. In this case we might take the data from each 
individual metric that measured user behavior and take the average across all 
of them so that we could report a percentage of positive vs. negative responses.
Items such as these are often given just a few seconds of time in which to be 
reported during normal times and will generally need to be ­representable in 
graphical format on a presentation slide (think red, yellow, and green lights). 
In times of crises, however, such items are often given closer scrutiny, so backup 
slides containing the detailed data are always a useful thing to keep at the ready.

CHAPTER 9
Information security compliance is both an operational and a legal concern 
for organizations in many industries today. However, it is not about the fear 
of lawsuits or fines (albeit this fear is well founded), but due to the increased 
reliance on information technology (IT), the value of information assets has 
increased significantly and maintaining repeatable, standardized operations 
relies on strong control compliance framework. Organizations depend mainly 
on IT to provide a platform for conducting business. As a result, controlling 
risks to information assets via security controls has become a dominating topic.
To comply with security practices, enterprises must develop comprehensive 
information security compliance management programs to comply with mul-
tiple regulations, such as Sarbanes–Oxley (SOX), Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Payment Card 
Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS), and many others. These regula-
tory standards prescribe recommendations for protecting data and improving 
information security management in the enterprise.
	
n	 SOX requirements mean that any electronic communication must be 
backed up and secured with reasonable disaster recovery infrastructure,

PCI DSS requirements.

CHAPTER 9: 
Security Compliance Management and Auditing
Failure to protect information assets may result in high financial and public  
cost and may also cause disruption of business activities, and even brand 
­erosion. In some cases, such as with HIPAA, failure to achieve and maintain 
security compliance may potentially result in financial and legal penalties. 
What, precisely, is examined in a compliance audit will vary depending on 
whether an organization is a public or private company, what kind of data it 
handles, and if it transmits or stores sensitive financial data.
If managed properly, information security compliance standards can be 
used to strengthen an organization’s overall information security program. 
Integrating compliance efforts with an organization’s overall information 
security program can save money and time, reduce complexity, and help 
create long-term, sustainable solutions for an organization’s information 
security challenges. In demonstrating security compliance, enterprises are 
better able to define and achieve specific IT security goals as well as mit-
igate the threat of network attacks through processes like vulnerability 
management.
ESTABLISHING AN INFORMATION SECURITY 
COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM
An information security compliance management program comprises a 
minimum set of security requirements for protecting data that apply to any 
organization that stores, processes, or transmits that data. Maintaining infor-
mation security compliance requires that an organization have well-defined 
programs, practices, and processes in place to review and reassess information 
security practices, even in highly dynamic business environments. To under-
stand how an organization’s security program performs on a day-to-day basis, 
organizations must implement an information security compliance program 
to continuously monitor and document the implementation, effectiveness, 
adequacy, and status of all of their security controls. These programs should be 
well aligned with the organization’s business and security goals; address any 
changes within the organization, operating environment, and implemented 
technologies; and produce sufficient evidence to illustrate continued adher-
ence to security requirements.
The information security leader should ensure the right stakeholders 
involved in the process—senior management support is essential for an 
information security compliance management program. Information secu-
rity leader should use these various compliance mandates to get with senior 
leadership, who are often removed from day-to-day information security 
challenges and processes, to understand the compliance requirements and 
the organization’s security state of compliance against these requirements. 

159
Establishing an Information Security Compliance Management Program
Thankfully, senior leadership understands compliance; however, informa-
tion security concepts, such as authentication, access controls, and logging 
and monitoring, continue to be abstract requirements to many senior exec-
utives. Senior leadership does understand many regulations come with pen-
alties and fines that could impact the business, such as imprisonment for 
SOX noncompliance or fines for PCI DSS noncompliance. When discussing 
regular updates about compliance efforts and compliance projects, informa-
tion security leader should also use the time to identify managers’ security 
concerns and risk appetite, and educate senior leadership about information 
security efforts to reduce noncompliance risk.
For organizations that lack a senior executive dedicated to overseeing over-
all compliance, it is essential that a business risk steering committee be 
solicited to review the compliance audit process and outputs, including the 
recommendations. Be sure to include participants from all relevant business  
groups in the process, as well as line-of-business representatives. Even if 
the information security leader owns the information security compliance  
audit, great care should be taken to be sure the involvement of business 
risk steering committee usually comprises Internal Controls, Internal 
Audit, and Financial Executives, and the process is not dominated by the IT 
organization.
Once the information security leader has established support for a compliance 
management program with senior leadership, a qualified information security 
compliance manager should be assigned overall responsibility for these activi-
ties and be given adequate funding and the proper authority to effectively orga-
nize and allocate such resources. Maintaining security compliance requires a 
well-managed program to integrate security into the day-to-day activities of the 
organization. Ongoing compliance also requires centralized coordination of 
numerous resources, actions, projects, and people.
The information security compliance manager would be responsible for 
engaging management support, coordinating monitoring and assessment 
activities, and engaging key personnel or functional groups as part of the 
efforts to ensure all security functions, such as patching systems, security-log 
reviews, wireless network scans, internal/external vulnerability scans, and 
internal/external penetration tests are performed as required. Additionally, 
the information security compliance manager should be responsible for 
collecting, collating, and storing evidence to demonstrate security controls 
are operating effectively on a continuous basis. Although the compliance 
manager is not typically tasked with generating or organizing all of the evi-
dence, the compliance manager would be responsible for making certain 
the evidence is prepared, indexed, and stored in a central repository for use 
during assessments or internal reviews. Often the compliance manager and

team rely on governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) tools to manage the 
process through workflow and hold evidence for inspection.
PUBLISHING AN INFORMATION SECURITY COMPLIANCE 
POLICY
To ensure organizational understanding of the information security compli-
ance management mandate, a policy is an important tool to state the man-
date’s objective, goals, purpose, roles, and responsibilities, and its relationship 
to the overall information security program. The policy formally articulates 
the requirements that assist management in defining a framework that ensures 
compliance with the overall information security goals with security-related 
laws, regulations, policies, standards, and contractual provisions to which 
their IT resources and data are subject. The policy also has ties to the subor-
dinate procedures and guidelines that may explain the “how” compliance is 
implemented.
It is equally important to review and update the information security com-
pliance management policy and procedures. As discussed in Chapter 4, the 
organization may have irrelevant or stale policies, lacks policies that are 
routinely adhered to, or does not follow the ones it does have in place. In 
any organization that relies on IT, policies need to be fluid and dynamic, 
and continually evaluated and updated for appropriateness toward chang-
ing IT environment or business conditions. The IT and information security 
functions should determine together which compliance policies need to be 
updated, which need to be overhauled, which need to be added, and which 
need to be retired.
DEPLOY AN INFORMATION SECURITY COMPLIANCE 
PROCESS
Organizations confronted with multiple regulatory requirements, as well as 
their own security policies, are often stretched about how to meet so many 
laws and regulations obligations. Some organizations allow ­information 
security compliance to be addressed by more than just the information 
security function. For example, they may allow the business units most 
directly affected by the regulatory requirement to perform their own com-
pliance assessment in addition to the organizational compliance assess-
ment and perhaps even a third Internal Audit assessment. As a result, efforts 
are often incomplete, redundant, duplicative, and even costly. In addition, 
these organizations may not have the rigor or discipline to execute an evi-
dence-based audit and may simply “self-attest” to a state that is not reflected 
by reality.

161
Deploy an Information Security Compliance Process
A piecemeal approach may also undermine the integration of information 
security compliance into other institutional compliance programs, such as 
information privacy and institutional governance. For example, a decentral-
ized approach to information security compliance management could make it 
harder to monitor and report the controls that are increasingly a part of audits. 
For all of these reasons, organizations should consider a unified approach 
to meeting information security compliance. By using a unified approach to 
information security compliance, organizations subject to multiple informa-
tion security laws, regulations, and guidelines will be able to comply with all 
of them at one time. This is commonly known as a “test once, comply many” 
approach. By determining which organizational policies, laws, and regulations 
are applicable, the compliance team then conducts a comprehensive compli-
ance analysis that covers these multiple requirements, and then recommends 
the minimum level of required safeguards to meet these requirements. Where 
there are conflicting requirements, such as password strength, encryption 
strength, or audit settings, compliance should focus on the most stringent 
requirement as a “high water mark.”
Step 1: Determine Applicable Security Policies, Laws, and 
Regulations
The first step in the process is to determine the security policies, laws, and reg-
ulations applicable to the organization. This is an important preliminary step 
to set compliance’s scope. This determination not only will assist in preparing 
the compliance assessment plan but also will guide the compliance assessor 
in selecting the information to be collected and the type of compliance assess-
ment methodology that should be performed.
Identifying the appropriate requirements is not always a straightforward 
process. Depending on their activities and operations, organizations can be 
affected by a number of laws and regulations. In addition, some policies, 
laws, and regulations apply only to specific organizational departments or 
functional activities. In other cases, more than one requirement on the same 
control area or domain may be applicable. Once the applicable information 
security requirement law is determined, an appropriate information security 
risk or compliance analysis framework, such as International Organization 
for Standardization (ISO) 27004 or National Institute of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) 800-series, can be selected. It is often worth the effort to 
map these several requirements when the target of evaluation is governed 
by several information security framework requirements. For example, if the 
information system password authentication requirement for system access 
is six characters for one requirement, eight character for another, and eight 
characters and special characters for yet a third, it may be helpful for a single 
requirement (the most stringent) and evaluate the system accordingly.

162
CHAPTER 9: 
Security Compliance Management and Auditing
The analysis model to be used will depend on the organizational type, 
applicable information security requirements, and information security 
framework aligned to both type and requirements. An example is a govern-
ment agency that is aligned to NIST 800-series may require the compliance 
framework of NIST Special Publication 800-37 “Guide for Applying the 
Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems.” A second 
example is a commercial entity that is aligned to ISO 27000-series may find 
the ISO 27004 method of risk management more appropriate. Some help-
ful qualifying questions can be asked to determine the scope and focus of 
the compliance assessment:
	
n	 What is the type of organization (i.e., privately held, publically traded, 
government agency)?
	
n	 What type of industry or markets does the business participate in?
	
n	 What type of information is stored, processed, transmitted?
	
n	 What processes have legal or regulatory implications (i.e., does the 
organization provide health care service, process credit cards for 
payment purposes)?
Step 2: Prepare the Information Security Compliance 
Management Plan
After the information security compliance requirements are identified, a thor-
ough compliance management plan is prepared by the compliance manager. 
This management plan is used to guide the individual compliance activities—
number and type of compliance audits by business unit or entity, schedules of 
the compliance activities including senior leadership reviews, policy and sup-
porting procedure and guideline updates, staffing mixes and training require-
ments for the conduct of audits, and any technology road maps for tools used 
during compliance audits. This is traditionally an annual process, adjusted 
periodically as schedules or resources become released or constrained.
Step 3: Data Collection and Asset Identification
Information gathering includes the identification of assets to be protected, 
document review, and interviews with both management and other stakehold-
ers. The individuals who are interviewed may be line-of-business personnel, 
functional staff, senior management, legal counsel, audit and compliance per-
sonnel, and, of course, the IT staff. It may also involve vendors and other third 
parties, particularly if certain functions are outsourced but are in scope of the 
audit. The scope of the interviews will differ slightly, depending on the state, 
federal, and international laws and regulations that are applicable.
The data collection process will review information security technical, opera-
tional, and risk management practices, processes, and procedures. Technical 
security reviews includes asset management, configuration management, 

163
Deploy an Information Security Compliance Process
security management, as well as assessment of IT architecture, application, 
and network policies. Operational security includes vulnerability manage-
ment, patch management, incident management, business continuity/disaster 
recovery, and other operational service or functions. Risk management reviews 
cover policies and procedures, risk assessments, compliance audits, third-party 
security reviews, and other analytical functions in managing and governing IT 
security risk. It is also important to ensure that physical security is included to 
evaluate compliance for the protection of information security facilities.
Evidence is collected through either manual or automated methods, mainly 
documentary, interviews, and automated collection through system or security 
tools. Documentary evidence include written policies and procedures, Internet 
policies and procedures, sanctions and disciplinary procedures, and other 
documents evidencing organizational efforts to protect information, such as 
contracts, procedures for assigning, modifying, or removing access rights, and 
password-management policies. Auditors will generally ask chief information 
officers, chief technology officers, and IT administrators a series of pointed 
questions over the course of an audit. Interviews are particularly helpful to 
elicit how the program is implemented and personal observations of its effec-
tiveness. Some important areas to cover during interviews are:
	
n	 the individual(s) responsible for information privacy and security 
(organizational and departmental levels);
	
n	 information assets that need to be protected to support the business 
and operations;
	
n	 how the information security program is structured; how compliance 
policies and procedures are implemented and integrated with other 
activities;
	
n	 how well departments work together to ensure that information security 
practices are uniform; which third parties have access to the institution’s 
information system.
IT administrators prepare for compliance audits using event log managers and 
robust change management software to allow tracking and documentation 
authentication and controls in IT systems. These tools’ output may include 
what users were added and when, who has left the company, whether user 
IDs were revoked and which IT administrators have access to critical systems. 
Beyond the common system management tools, the growing technological 
landscape of GRC software now enables the IT staff to quickly show auditors 
that the organization is in compliance.
Step 4: Perform Risk Analysis
In Step 4, the collected data are integrated into the selected risk analysis (e.g., 
organizational, ISO, or NIST frameworks). The quality and effectiveness of com-
pliance risk analysis results will depend heavily on how much data were collected 

164
CHAPTER 9: 
Security Compliance Management and Auditing
in Step 3. The compliance risk analysis includes technical, operational, and man-
agement security including organizational context and considerations.
Step 5: Report Findings and Recommendations
The results of the compliance risk analysis are then documented in an infor-
mation security compliance audit report. The information security compli-
ance audit report should list organizational context, identified threats and 
vulnerabilities, current controls, and control effectiveness or even absence. 
To ensure relevancy and due diligence, the information security compliance 
audit report should reference specific sections or paragraphs of the applicable 
security regulations for both existing and missing controls. The plan should 
encompass all the safeguards identified in the risk analysis and also include 
procedures for the selection of security system vendors or service providers, 
and the installation of security systems or services. To maximize the report’s 
effectiveness, the information security compliance audit report should also 
contain an action plan and milestone schedule for implementing the neces-
sary changes to attain compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Step 6: Execute the Implementation Plan
The implementation plan provided in the information security compliance 
audit report is executed in this step. At this stage of the compliance process, 
it is important to integrate all new controls for meeting information security 
compliance with other compliance efforts currently under way (e.g., financial, 
contracts, legal). The integration of compliance programs will ensure unifor-
mity and consistency across the compliance activities, or at the very least avoid 
duplication of effort redundancy. For example, rationalization and harmoni-
zation of compliance activities to support information security regulations can 
potentially save time, money, and other resources and procedures.
Step 7: Periodically Monitor, Test, Review, and Modify the 
Information Security Compliance Management Program
Information security, as any IT activity, is an ongoing process. Maintaining 
a state of continuous compliance requires focused effort and coordination. 
Due to the changing technology landscape, information security functions 
should continuously monitor and test the effectiveness of implemented con-
trols against known or potential threats. This involves testing applications and 
networks or applications against emerging threats and recommending actions 
when threats are present and vulnerabilities are discovered. Organizations that 
are accustomed to traditional approaches of information security compliance 
that focus primarily on annual audits may find it difficult to build in the peo-
ple, processes, and technology necessary to support sustained compliance. 
Organizations should perform periodic compliance risk analysis to validate 

165
Information Security Compliance Management in Mergers and Acquisitions
that control selection and implementation features continue to be reasonable, 
appropriate, and effective.
INFORMATION SECURITY COMPLIANCE MANAGEMENT IN 
MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS
Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) can be extremely effective mechanisms for 
companies to achieve important business objectives. Information security 
and privacy compliance requirements play a critical role because they may 
impact the acquirer’s business objectives, regulatory profile, and valuation 
model, particularly if the new acquisition introduces increased risk of an 
information security or privacy-related liability. Whether the M&A goal is 
gaining access to a new market, acquiring new technology, or gaining econ-
omies of scale, the acquiring organization needs to develop an information 
security compliance approach that addresses information security and pri-
vacy concerns that may manifest themselves before, during, and after the 
M&A. As the information security team reviews acquisition targets, as well as 
the M&A team’s approach to evaluating targets, the team should consider the 
following elements:
	
n	 If the acquisition goal is expansion into new industries or geographic 
regions, there may be new regional regulatory or legal requirements 
for information security and privacy. It is important to identify what 
new markets will be entered. If the acquisition involves expansion into 
highly regulated sectors (e.g., health care, financial, business targeting 
children as consumers, etc.), then the information security program 
may require a change in the face of changing compliance obligations, 
both domestic and international, for the organization.
	
n	 If new business processes are introduced with new data types or 
categories transmitted, processed, or stored between the two parties, 
this may introduce a different level of required security or privacy 
compliance. During the due diligence process, if the acquirer finds that 
the acquisition target involves cross-border data transfers or privacy 
regulations, the acquirer will need to explore the target’s compliance for 
transmission security. For example, if the seller or target has certified to 
the EU–US Safe Harbor replacement program (“Privacy Shield”), the 
acquirer will want to review any previous Safe Harbor assessments, as 
well as its publicly available Safe Harbor certification. If the seller or 
target is subject to HIPAA, the buyer would want to evaluate its HIPAA 
compliance measures. The compliance risk profile of the buyer or seller 
might change post sale.
	
n	 If the motivation for acquisition is the introduction of a new product, 
service, or technology, then the types of data categories or sensitivity of 

166
CHAPTER 9: 
Security Compliance Management and Auditing
privacy information must be identified. What privacy policies, notices, 
and other compliance efforts will be required to support new products, 
services, or technologies? This becomes particularly relevant if the 
acquisition uses the acquired technology in a different manner than 
earlier designed. For example, using a new platform for processing data 
types for which it was not designed may require rework and additional 
cost to the acquirer, and therefore may dilute the value proposition of 
the acquisition by introducing more cost to the transaction.
Another information security compliance concern is the M&A process itself. 
Both parties should be sensitive that sometimes providing other parties 
(such as the acquirer in an M&A) with the personal information of employ-
ees or clients can itself be a breach of privacy policies or laws. Questions 
should be asked before the diligence process actually takes place to ensure 
no violations will occur with performing the diligence process. Likewise, 
another aspect of due diligence is third-party information security com-
pliance. It is during the diligence process that large amounts of sensitive 
and confidential information will be shared with bankers, attorneys, con-
sultants, third-party vendors, and other parties. No matter how secure an 
organization is and how many process steps are taken to secure their data, 
both parties are reliant on third parties that host, access, and store the target 
organization’s data. Parties, particularly the target company, should care-
fully assess third-party compliance to information security practices that 
will be hosting their data during the diligence process, particularly in their 
online data rooms.
SUMMARY
The increased number of government-mandated and private contractual infor-
mation security requirements has caused organizations to view information 
security as another aspect of regulatory or contractual compliance. The exis-
tence of fines, penalties, or loss (including brand erosion) has also increased 
the appetite to implement comprehensive information security practices, such 
as information security compliance management. This approach begins by 
reviewing all of the information security requirements imposed by the emerg-
ing statutory, regulatory, and contractual legal standards. These standards are 
then compared with the more established information security standards. After 
a thorough risk assessment and analysis, the legal standards and the informa-
tion security standards are blended to create a complete information security 
compliance program. A unified approach to information security compliance 
thus enables organizations not only to address identified risks but also to com-
ply with the law.

167
Actions
ACTIONS
 
Identify the business need for an information security compliance program; compliance pro-
grams do not exist unto themselves.
	n	
Industry involvement, regional orientation, business processes or product/services, and 
information types will generally indicate a requirement to protect. The compliance program 
will tie the requirement and validation together as a business requirement.
Develop an information security compliance management policy and supporting documentation 
according to the compliance requirement (legal, regulatory).
	n	
An overarching policy provides the basis and justification of the information security compli-
ance program. Subordinate procedures, guidelines, and checklists then provide the “tools” 
for implementing the program. Periodic information security compliance policy and other 
documentation reviews should be conducted as regulations and standards change—the 
policy, as a minimum, should be reviewed annually for relevancy and effectiveness.
Identify stakeholders that will champion the information security compliance management 
program.
	n	
Usually these stakeholders will be involved in other compliance or compliance-related 
activities; the chief financial officer and chief compliance officer are typically the best 
champions for a compliance-based program that reduces financial risk, as well as any 
other compliance risks to the business that may cause some degree of materiality to the 
business.
Design and develop a compliance management process that is easy to understand and follow.
	n	
Ensure traceability to the legal requirements to compliance audit framework—the require-
ment must have direct correlation to the audited control and data that support the analysis. 
Failure to demonstrate traceability will cause some to call into question the reason for the 
compliance audit if it is not relevant. Simplicity in compliance audit execution will be much 
more palatable than onerous, time-consuming audit processes.
Deliver business value through clear and concise reporting of findings and recommendations.
	n	
Ensure that these recommendations are vetted against other risk and compliance manage-
ment recommendations to eliminate redundancy and duplication. The overall finding should 
be easy to understand in business terms and relevant to the business risk than simply 
technical risk. The business leader who cannot translate the compliance gap to the effect 
on the business is less apt to invest in gap remediation than one who easily understands the 
gap and necessity to close it due to business impact.
Ensure information security has a role in M&A.
	n	
M&A can have an impact on the organizational compliance posture through the integration 
of new business processes and information categories between the acquirer and target 
organizations. During due diligence, the information security team should understand the 
target acquisition compliance requirement, how the target is meeting them, and if any 
liability or risk of failures may be introduced into the acquirer’s portfolio of information 
security risks. Post acquisition, the information security program will need to integrate the 
new acquisition into the existing information security compliance program.

CHAPTER 10
Information security metrics can help organizations verify that their security 
controls are in compliance with a policy, process, or procedure; identify their 
security strengths and weaknesses; and identify security trends, both within 
and outside the organization’s control. Studying trends allows an organization 
to monitor its security performance over time and to identify changes that 
necessitate adjustments in the organization’s security posture. At a higher level, 
these beneﬁts can be combined to help an organization achieve its mission by 
evaluating its compliance with legislation and regulations; improving the per-
formance of its implemented security control; and answering high-level busi-
ness questions regarding security, which facilitate strategic decision making by 
the organization’s highest levels of management.
An information security metric quantifies the component activities of a pro-
cess, person, or product via a predefined system of measurement. Information 
security metrics are simple calculations or formulas that seek to measure and 
manage information security processes like risk management, compliance man-
agement, application security, and cybersecurity, to name a few. Information 
security metrics describe:
	
n	 what exactly is being measured,
	
n	 specific units of measurement (e.g., percentages, ratios, indexes, 
numbers),
	
n	 how it is to be measured, and
	
n	 which data source will be used to collect the measurements.
The term metric is often used to refer to the measurement of performance, but 
it is clearer to deﬁne metrics and measures separately. A metric is an abstract,

somewhat subjective attribute, such as how well an information security pro-
gram secures the organization against external threats or how effective is the 
organization’s incident response team. A measure is a concrete, objective attri-
bute, such as the percentage of systems within an organization that are fully 
patched, the length of time between the release of a patch and its installation 
on a system, or the level of access to a system that a vulnerability in the system 
could provide. A table of definitions and sources of the definitions is provided.

Many information security metrics programs have focused on collecting indi-
vidual measures with little thought on how the measures could be combined 
or transformed into metrics. A more optimal approach is to ﬁrst select the 
information security metric, and then determine what measures they can per-
form that produce the metrics. By collecting and analyzing groups of measures, 
the information security analyst can approximate the metric.
An organization should also have multiple levels of metrics, each geared toward 
a particular type of audience. The audience of information security metrics 
includes senior executives, lines-of-business management, and functional sup-
port staff including the information technology (IT) and information security 
staff: strategic decision making, business risk management, and operational 
performance monitoring benefit from an information security metrics program.
	
n	 Strategic decision making support. Security metrics information aid 
different kinds of strategic decision making (e.g., industry or market 
entry, program planning, resource allocation, product and service 
selection). Information security metrics and benchmarking can 
introduce critical information on the organization’s competitiveness in 
the market relative to its security, perceived or not.

171
Building the Security Metrics Program
	
n	 Risk management. An organization that understands its security 
posture, likely understands its level of security risk relative to its IT 
management control systems. Risk management metrics assist the 
business, at multiple levels, to understand what information assets 
need protection, what are threats to the assets, management controls 
effectiveness, what gaps exist, and new controls need to be added.
	
n	 Operational information security monitoring and reporting. Monitoring 
the operational IT environment and its security posture can determine 
compliance with the security requirements (e.g., policy, procedures, and 
regulations), as well as gauge the performance of specific operational 
security programs and technical controls, effectiveness of security 
controls under stresses, provide a basis for trend analysis, and identify 
specific for improvement.
For example, information security management might be interested in higher-level 
metrics regarding the organization’s security posture, such as the overall effec-
tiveness of the organization’s incident response handling capabilities. Technical 
information security staff might be interested in lower-level metrics related to the 
effectiveness of particular types of security controls, such as intrusion detection 
rates or user access violations. Lower-level information security metrics facilitate 
making more tactical decisions, whereas higher-level information security metrics 
are well suited for making more strategic decisions. The lower-level metrics are 
often used as input to the higher-level metrics.
Information security metrics and measurements can be used to facilitate deci-
sion making and improve performance and accountability through the collec-
tion, analysis, and reporting of relevant performance-related data. Information 
security metrics must be based on information security performance goals and 
objectives. Likewise, organizations can also use information security metrics 
and measures to set targets as goals, and determine success or failure against 
the targets. For example, if an organization determines that 70% of its informa-
tion systems is compliant with an antivirus policy. The organization could set 
a target threshold of 90%, implement changes in its processes or procedures to 
increase compliance, and then measure compliance quarterly to determine if 
the target has been achieved. Targets are generally very organizationally speciﬁc 
and are based on operational baselines in the environment.
BUILDING THE SECURITY METRICS PROGRAM
To facilitate understanding and acceptance at all levels of a new security met-
rics program, it is advisable to ground the program in a well-defined process in 
the development and sustainment of the initiative. The eight steps below could 
be used to guide the process of establishing a security metrics program.

172
CHAPTER 10 
Information Security Program Metrics
Step 1. Identify the Stakeholders
Executive buy-in is the key to successfully deploying an information security 
metrics program. As highlighted earlier, in the case of initiatives that have a 
perceived lack of benefits or could affect unwanted cultural change, it is inev-
itable that many who will be affected by a metrics implementation effort will 
question it. Some may even work against it. For that reason, it is critical that a 
high-level executive sponsor visibly supports the metrics program.
Once the sponsor is identified, stakeholders are likewise identified (usually 
with the help of the sponsor). Stakeholder generally corresponds to the scope 
of the information security program. Senior executives who have interest in 
the strategic decision-making benefits of the metrics program will typically be 
the chief information officer, chief financial officer, chief privacy officer, and 
chief human relations officer and general counsel. Those who have business 
risk management concerns generally consist of the lines-of-business and func-
tional support leaders. Operational metrics will involve both functional and 
operational staff responsible for execution of their management scope.
Step 2: Define Metrics Program Goals and Objectives
Information security metrics program development and maintenance take con-
siderable effort and divert resources; it is critical that the goal(s) and objectives 
of the program be well defined and agreed upon. For the metrics program to 
demonstrate value and effectiveness, it is very important to tie metrics to busi-
ness goals. Statements of objectives should also indicate high-level actions that 
must be collectively accomplished to meet the goal(s). Such goals may include:
	
n	 cost avoidance from security incidents
	
n	 higher information security performance
	
n	 lower operational risks and errors
	
n	 greater regulatory compliance
	
n	 meeting cost and schedule targets for information security projects
	
n	 return on investment for key information security projects
	
n	 end-user productivity
Step 3: Decide Which Metrics to Report
Any underlying corporate framework could dictate what metrics are 
needed. This step would be to identify those specific security processes. A 
­compliance-based approach would assess how closely established security 
standards are being followed. There are several standards-based information 
security metrics frameworks that have been formalized to assess an overall 
organizational information security program. Many stem from regulatory or 
legal requirements, such as Sarbanes–Oxley, Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act, or European Network and Information Security Agency. 

173
Building the Security Metrics Program
Others are related to industry-based compliance framework (e.g., Payment 
Card Industry Data Security Standard). Although some organizations may 
choose to design, implement, and deploy their own security measures, the 
adoption of standards and guidelines for security measurement greatly 
improves the quality of an organization’s measurement program, and allows 
organizations to better communicate their security postures with others that 
share the same framework, and allow benchmarking with other external orga-
nizations. Another benefit is if the organization adopts a policy framework 
based on standards, then the complementary metrics framework is readymade 
to adopt and tailor for conformance. Two such frameworks, ISO 27004:2009 
Information Security Management Measurement and National Institute of 
Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-55 Revision 1 
Performance Measurement Guide, deserve special mention.
ISO 27004:2009—Information Security 
Management—Measurement
In the ISO/IEC 27000 series, information security metrics now has its own ISO 
standard, ISO/IEC 27004:2009, and has been integrated into the revised infor-
mation security management standard ISO 27001:2013. ISO recognition has 
led to a significant rise in the use of information security metrics and potential 
value to the information security posture of the organization. ISO/IEC 27004; 
2009 concerns measurements relating to information security management. 
The standard is intended to help organizations measure, report on, and hence 
systematically improve the effectiveness of their information security manage-
ment systems.
It provides guidance on the development and use of measures and measure-
ment to assess the effectiveness of an implemented information security man-
agement system and controls or groups of controls, as specified in ISO/IEC 
27001:2013. This would include policy, information security risk management, 
control objectives, controls, processes, and procedures, and support the process 
of its revision, helping to determine whether any of the processes or controls 
need to be changed or improved. ISO 27004:2009 articulates core information 
security metrics that will be required to demonstrate conformance to the stan-
dard. If core metrics were to be clearly defined, companies could collect indus-
try-wide statistics, and use them to benchmark performance and progress. In 
addition, the ISO standard does allow for the creation of customized metrics 
and measurements. The measurement process used in ISO/IEC 27004 consists 
of the steps of:
	
n	 developing measures,
	
n	 operating measurement program,
	
n	 analyzing and reporting results, and
	
n	 evaluating and improving the measurement program itself.

174
CHAPTER 10 
Information Security Program Metrics
The measurement model in ISO/IEC 27004:2009 provides a detailed top-down 
and bottom-up structure for identifying the information that is being sought 
from the measures, the individual attributes required to construct individual 
measures, and a hierarchical structure for rolling up and consolidating the data 
with increasing complexity.
NIST Special Publication 800-55 Revision 1—Performance 
Measurement Guide
The NIST in the United States has also made significant contributions to the 
production of guidelines and definitions on the use of security metrics. NIST 
Special Publication 800-55 Revision 1, Performance Measurement Guide for 
Information Security, describes the processes and methodologies that link 
information system level security performance to organizational agency per-
formance through the organization’s strategic planning processes. By doing 
so, the processes and methodologies help demonstrate how information secu-
rity contributes to accomplishing organizational strategic goals and objectives. 
NIST cites that the performance measures developed according to NIST SP 
800-55 will enhance the ability of organizations to respond to government 
mandates and initiatives (i.e., Federal Information Systems Management Act 
or FISMA). The measurements standard focuses on three key measurement 
categories: implementation measures, effectiveness/efﬁciency measures, and 
impact measures. NIST SP 800-55 recommends when establishing a measure-
ments program, the organization should follow the steps of:
	
n	 mapping measures of the information security program performance 
to information security goals and objectives across the range of security 
controls;
	
n	 mapping measures corresponding to security control families or 
individual security controls directly to the individual security control(s);
	
n	 use the data describing the security control’s implementation and 
security program performance to generate required measures.
In the absence of any preexisting framework, a top-down or a bottom-up 
approach for determining which metrics might be desirable could be used. 
Meaningful and well-designed metrics and measurements for a business or 
organization are created and selected by carefully defining their scope and 
purpose. In this form, metrics can be used to address a wide range of infor-
mation security management issues including measurement of progress in 
achieving goals and objectives, adherence to internal control procedures, 
justification of budgets and investment, and effectiveness of training and 
awareness program.
The selection of the metric should be able to answer what objective is being 
sought. Ouedraogo, et al. (2013) [1], assert that a good metric should always 

175
Building the Security Metrics Program
satisfy the criteria of meaningfulness, measurability, correctness, and usability. 
Meaningfulness requires that the metrics and measurements should be focused 
and their value should be easily recognizable and apparent to the intended 
audience. Correctness is the metric’s context, completeness, and objectivity to 
what is being measured. Measurability requires the metric to have the attainabil-
ity or availability with sufﬁcient accuracy to be measured. The criteria of useful-
ness entail the metric’s efﬁciency, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Each metric 
should be questioned for its appropriateness using a standard set of questions.
Questions Relevant to Meaningfulness
	
n	 Is the metric meaningful in the context of its use?
	
n	 Is the metric meaningful to the measurer in the context of its use?
	
n	 Is the metric meaningful to the audience in the context of its use?
	
n	 Are the metric and associated measurements clearly formulized?
	
n	 Are only important parameters considered in the metric?
	
n	 Is the metric applicable to the planned decision making?
	
n	 Does the metric support comparability?
	
n	 Are the metrics and related measurements useful in the decision 
making?
Questions Relevant to Measurability
	
n	 Can the measurement data be provided from the scope of the 
assessment?
	
n	 Are the measurement data available?
	
n	 Are the same results returned if a measurement is reproduced in the 
same context, with exactly the same conditions?
	
n	 Are the same results returned if a measurement is repeated in the same 
context, with exactly the same conditions?
	
n	 Are the same results returned if a measurement is reproduced in the 
same context, with exactly the same conditions by different measurers?
Questions Relevant to Correctness
	
n	 Does the metric and what is being measured correlate?
	
n	 Are the results of the metric consistent enough?
	
n	 Are the results of the metric able to accurately depict the attributes of 
the measured element?
	
n	 Is the metric able to predict the security risk for the purposes of metric?
	
n	 Are we measuring the attribute that we really want to measure?
	
n	 Do we know enough about an attribute before it is reasonable to 
consider measuring it?
	
n	 Do we know enough about the context before it is reasonable to 
consider measuring it?

176
CHAPTER 10 
Information Security Program Metrics
	
n	 Does the collection of measurements cover the objectives to a sufﬁcient 
degree?
	
n	 Can the measurement results be biased by the measurer’s beliefs or 
actual feeling?
Questions Relevant to Usefulness
	
n	 Are the measurement results kept within the deﬁned limits or the 
measurement window?
	
n	 Are adequate measurements achieved while only consuming the 
minimum amount of undesired resources?
	
n	 Are adequate measurements achieved while only consuming minimal 
costs?
	
n	 Are adequate measurements achieved while only consuming the 
minimum amount of effort and time?
A second good metrics selection framework that helps indicate which security 
goals are being met and drives actions to improve the security posture of the 
organization is that which is SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, repeat-
able, and time dependent). Whatever framework is used to develop and select 
the appropriate metrics, it should be easily understood and mutually agreed to 
by those who are using and reviewing the measurements.
Step 4: Establish Targets and Threshold
In this step appropriate targets are identified and thresholds set. To increase or 
maintain an acceptable level of information security, organizations must set 
targets and performance thresholds at which corrective action must be taken. 
A target is the desired level of performance, as indicated by measures that rep-
resent success at achieving a defined outcome. A threshold is a level, rate, or 
amount at which something comes into effect; in this case, a threshold is where 
the measurement crosses from acceptable to unacceptable state. See Appendix 
A for thresholds as depicted by an information security scorecard.
One method in establishing targets and thresholds is using historical mea-
sures. It can be helpful to use measures that the information security organiza-
tion has already gathered to establish a baseline, or starting point, for a target. 
If historical data are unavailable, consider using information from outside data 
sources to benchmark, or compare, your performance data with those of other 
comparable organizations. The information security leader not only should 
review industry-specific data resources for possible targets and best practices, 
but also may find national and global metrics provided by SANS Institute, 
NIST, and other publications helpful. Technical benchmarking is also a man-
ner of comparing the organization’s performance and practices against peer 
groups within the industry or noted “best practice” organizations outside the 

177
Building the Security Metrics Program
industry. These technical benchmarks can be found in various industry associ-
ations or professional research organizations, such as the Corporate Executive 
Board, Gartner, and others. Then set targets that seem reasonable in light of the 
benchmarking information.
Step 5: Develop Strategies for Collecting Metrics Data
Once an organization has identiﬁed its metrics, it then needs to determine 
what measures can feasibly be collected to support those metrics. These strat-
egies should specify the source of the data, the frequency of data collection, 
and who is responsible for raw data accuracy, data compilation into measure-
ments, and generation of the metric. Organizations should seek opportunities 
to use existing data sources and automated collection mechanisms because 
of the cost of implementing and maintaining new systems and software sim-
ply for data collection purposes. As measures are collected, organizations 
need a way to analyze them and generate reports for the metrics they support. 
Organizations can analyze the measures and metrics in many ways, such as 
grouping them by business group, market industry, geographic location, logi-
cal division within the organization, information system type, and/or informa-
tion system criticality.
Organizations should also favor measures that can be collected via automated 
means because they are more likely to be more accurate than manual collec-
tion and can also be collected at any time. These sources of data can be system 
configuration files, system logs, firewall logs, audit reports, and user surveys. 
Although most of these sources of data were distributed across the enterprise, 
and there were few automated tools available, new products such as gover-
nance, risk, and compliance (GRC) applications have been introduced into 
the marketplace to make data collection, analysis, and reporting much more 
cost-effective. These GRC applications roll up measures into metrics and pres-
ent the metrics in a security dashboard format, with the measures underlying 
each metric available through drill-down. This allows a dashboard user to see 
the values of the presented metrics and changes in those metrics over time, as 
well as to examine the metrics and measures comprising those metrics.
Step 6: Determine How Metrics Will Be Reported
No information security metrics program effort is effective if the results are 
not communicated well. Executives may be accustomed to dealing with finan-
cial and other trend lines, but since information security is not a core com-
petency for management, complex information security–related data should 
be presented in a concise, well-understood format. The context, format, fre-
quency, distribution method, and responsibility for reporting metrics should 
be defined up front, so that the end product can be visualized early on by those 

178
CHAPTER 10 
Information Security Program Metrics
who will be involved in producing the metrics and those who will be using 
them for decision making. Graphic representations are particularly effective.
Another aspect is the distribution or presentation of the information secu-
rity metrics to targeted audiences. Revisiting the list of stakeholders will help 
organize the right topics with the right audiences. Senior executives who have 
interest in the strategic decision-making metrics will typically be the chief 
information officer, chief financial officer, chief people officer, chief human 
resources officer, and general counsel. Lines-of-business and functional sup-
port leaders will have an interest in the business risk management-related 
metrics. Operational metrics will be interesting to functional and operational 
staff responsible for execution of their management scope. Some information 
security metrics may be meaningful only to the information security manager 
and staff, and should not be distributed further. However, some tactical infor-
mation security metrics are required to help articulate remedial actions with 
the organization, particularly when funding is concerned.
Step 7: Create a Remediation Action Plan
Where the information security metrics reveal gaps, particularly critical gaps, a 
remediation action plan should accompany the report. A remediation action 
plan should contain all tasks that need to be accomplished to address the gap 
along with the gap owner, expected completion dates, and deliverables. As men-
tioned in Step 2, action items should be directly traceable to the goals and objec-
tives. Highlighting the traceability of actions in the plan to goals and objectives 
is useful why a given action is important. Another best practice in action plan-
ning is the incorporation of a verification or testing process to ensure the desired 
outcome has been realized. Lastly, an accountable executive or manager, usually 
the gap owner, should be required to inspect and validate the action closure.
Step 8: Conduct a Formal Program Review Cycle
An information security metrics program will require a formal, regular review 
of the metrics and measurements at least on an annual basis. Metrics that 
become stale or irrelevant are an indicator for a program refresh. Some guiding 
questions should be used to test for program effectiveness:
	
n	 Are the metrics useful in determining new courses of action for the 
overall security program?
	
n	 How much effort is it taking to generate the metrics?
	
n	 Is the value derived worth that effort?
These and other similar questions will be important to answer during the 
annual review process. A complementary approach is benchmarking within 
and outside the organization and industry to help identify new developments 
and opportunities to fine-tune the program.

179
Information Security Metrics and Key Performance Indicators
INFORMATION SECURITY METRICS AND KEY 
PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
A key performance indicator (KPI) is a metric used to evaluate factors that are 
crucial to the success of an organization. KPIs are quantifiable measurements, 
agreed to beforehand, that reflect the critical success factors of an organization. 
These are usually a subset of the total metrics in the information security met-
rics program. They differ from an objective in that an objective is something 
you want to achieve, whereas a KPI is something used to verify if your efforts 
are leading you toward the defined objective. If KPIs are used as a matter of 
course across the organization (business or IT), then security-related KPIs may 
be identified as part of Step 4 mentioned earlier, or independently as a fol-
low-on step if not consistently used by the business.
Examples of Strategic KPIs
	
n	 Percentage of business initiatives supported by the information security 
program (percentage of security supported business initiatives against 
total). The higher the value, the more optimized the information 
security resources, since management resources are being used over 
more aspects of the organization.
	
n	 Percentage of information security initiatives containing cost/benefit 
estimates program (percentage of security investments with financial 
value estimates against total). This indicator shows the organization’s 
maturity on tracking security investment value realization. The higher 
the value, the more the decisions are based on financial facts.
	
n	 Percentage of agreements with information security clauses (percentage 
contracts issued with security standard clauses of total awarded). 
This indicator shows how services and products are incorporating 
information security aspects (e.g., service level agreements on availability, 
confidentiality, integrity, and continuity). The higher the value, the better 
supported your relationships with clients and suppliers are.
Examples of IT Risk Management KPIs
	
n	 Percentage of key information systems that have completed an annual 
risk assessment (percentage key systems that have completed an annual 
risk assessment of the total number of systems). This indicator provides 
a view of how many key networks, systems, or applications have been 
evaluated for their security posture.
	
n	 Percentage of key information systems that have completed an annual 
risk assessment and rated “unsatisfactory” (percentage key systems that 
have completed an annual risk assessment with an unfavorable rating 
of the total number of systems). This indicator provides a view of how 

180
CHAPTER 10 
Information Security Program Metrics
many key networks, systems, or applications have been evaluated for 
their security posture and found lacking.
	
n	 Percentage of critical vendors whose information security is assessed 
(percentage of critical vendors who have completed a risk assessment). 
This indicator reveals the security posture of key suppliers on whom the 
organization is dependent.
Examples of Operational Security KPIs
	
n	 Percentage of systems (workstations, laptops, servers) with latest 
antivirus/antispyware signatures (percentage of systems with latest 
antivirus/antispyware signatures or total system population). This 
indicator describes the ability to reduce outages or nonproductively due 
to malicious software disruption.
	
n	 Percentage of email messages with malicious software attachments 
stopped within measurement period (percentage of email spam 
messages stopped/detected of total email). This indicator describes the 
ability to reduce outages or nonproductively due to malicious software 
disruption.
	
n	 Percentage of employees who have completed annual information 
security awareness training (percentage completions of total number 
of employees). An indicator of employee understanding of security 
policies and procedures deemed critical (e.g., how to identify and report 
a security event).
EXTERNAL BENCHMARKING
Benchmarking is the process of comparing organizational processes and per-
formance metrics to industry standards and best practices from other orga-
nizations, optimally organizations in the same industry and size. In fact, the 
use of metrics and statistics in isolation could create a false sense of security 
for an organization. The ability to benchmark and obtain some form rating 
against a comparable norm has been the goal of many organizations, partic-
ularly those involved in formation security intensive activities. It ensures that 
the organization is continually striving to improve its performance through 
learning. Benchmarking also opens minds to ideas from new sources within 
the same industry and other sectors. It is important to make sure that potential 
benchmarking partners are already tracking specific metrics or that can be eas-
ily derived from existing measures. Optimally, widespread industry acceptance 
would have to be achieved with agreement on the specific metrics to be used 
and interpretation of the metric framework standard (i.e., IOS/IEC or NIST).
As a project, the benchmarking purpose, objectives, and scope should be 
documented. This is a necessity for any project, particularly if sponsorship 

181
Common Objections to Information Security Metrics Programs
is needed. An executive sponsor will want to understand the benefits of the 
benchmarking exercise. Secondly, the benchmarking sample should be care-
fully selected. The project could select a sample of organizations whose per-
formance is actually worse or better than that of its own organization simply 
because of different industry, size, or geographical region. Benchmarking data 
will be difficult to compare “apples to apples” in terms of a bad sample selec-
tion. Lastly, the organization should agree on the primary information security 
metrics as the basis of comparison. These comparisons will be valid only if the 
participating organizations in the study measures performance in exactly the 
same way, every time.
Once the benchmark is concluded and lessons learned have been formulated, 
similar to any metrics program, the organization should develop and com-
municate an action plan for the changes that it will need to make to realize 
improvements. These action plans should feed its performance improvement 
processes, just as the actions developed from the information security metrics 
efforts.
COMMON OBJECTIONS TO INFORMATION SECURITY 
METRICS PROGRAMS
The introduction of any new measurement program will inevitably face 
objections. Although some objections may be totally legitimate and require 
addressing them to accommodate the obstacle, other objectives may be based 
on organizational culture and addressed with change management techniques. 
One common objection is the concern that managers could be assessed against 
a new set of metrics how their departments and staff perform against a goal. 
There will be many outside the information security organization who will be 
involved in collecting data whose activities and functions will be measured. 
This is a very personal reaction, and can be resolved with some socialization 
on the benefits of the program with these reluctant managers. Other common 
objections to an information security metrics program are:
	
n	 Cost of implementation. The additional effort in establishing an 
information security metrics program will require incremental funding 
for both development and sustainment of the effort (e.g., labor and 
possibly software). The cost can be offset through the benefits of the 
program in the cost avoidance or efficiencies gained by the investment. 
For regulated entities, an information security metrics program may be 
mandated as part of a compliance program.
	
n	 Size of the organization. An information security metrics program, 
like any metrics program, may be perceived as unwarranted overhead 
for small to medium-sized businesses. Although this concern is valid, 

182
CHAPTER 10 
Information Security Program Metrics
most small to medium-sized businesses may grow and, if privately 
held, become publically traded. Management through metrics as an 
organizational discipline will be expected if not required.
It is important to overcome these objections with sensible arguments of the 
benefits of the program. It is equally important not to “water down” informa-
tion security metrics that then become meaningless. The goal of setting infor-
mation security metrics is to improve organizational performance. Metrics 
and targets should be challenging; it will provide more value than focusing on 
something that is easily achievable or is already being achieved.
SUMMARY
The decision to implement a program of metrics and measurements is not to 
be taken lightly. The quality of the results will be directly attributable to the 
integrity and accuracy of the raw information collected and the stated objec-
tives of the metric framework. The use of standards-based metrics program 
can be designed to be implemented as part of the wider ranging information 
­security management standard since companies need to ensure that their 
information-gathering infrastructure meets or exceeds compliance guidelines 
as well as industry-recognized standards. This will assist them to withstand 
scrutiny from auditors and accountants. The use of security metrics and mea-
surements is likely to increase. If properly researched and implemented, they 
will prove to be a valuable resource for IT security officers and the company as 
a whole. They will also encourage best practice while ensuring regulatory com-
pliance. If poorly implemented, however, they will provide only meaningless 
figures, which may result in infrastructure weaknesses and a false sense of secu-
rity. For this reason effective policies and procedures must be the cornerstone 
for reliable security metrics and measurements.
ACTIONS
 
Identify stakeholder for the information security metrics program.
	n	
The information security team should identify champions and gather support for the 
information security metrics program. These stakeholders are the intended audience of the 
reports generated by the metrics program and most likely the decision makers from whom 
direction and guidance is sought.
Define the information security metrics programs and goals.
	n	
The metrics program’s goals and objectives should be traceable to the overall organiza-
tional goals and objectives. An acceptable approach is to decompose the business value 
chain and identify the nodes on which information security shortfalls or gaps may influence 
a business impact to the overall business goal in its market orientation.

183
Reference
Establish information security business relationship framework.
	n	
Establish a business relationship management framework for information security and the 
business. Introduce the role of business information security officer or business information 
risk manager as an advisory and consulting function to assist the business to meet their 
information security objectives, goals, and requirements.
Decide which metrics to report.
	n	
Implement a tiered approach to address strategic decision making, risk management, and 
operational information security, each with specific metrics and targets for the various 
audiences.
Establish metric targets and thresholds.
	n	
To increase or maintain high levels of quality, organizations must set targets and perfor-
mance thresholds at which corrective action must be taken.
Develop strategies for collecting metrics data.
	n	
Determine the sources of measures to be collected, how data will be collected (manual or 
automated), and how the data will be stored.
Determine how metrics will be reported.
	n	
Provide an easy-to-understand graphical representation of the collected information secu-
rity metric.
Create a remediation action plan.
	n	
Ensure that any gap is addressed with a remediation plan that will close the gap or correct 
the concern.
Conduct a formal program review cycle.
	n	
Check the metrics program for relevancy and consistency on an annual basis.
Select KPIs
	n	
KPIs should be extrapolated from the various metrics being collected, down select to a few 
highly relevant, impactful performance indicators that represent the strategic, business, 
and operational goals of the program.
Conduct external benchmarking.
	n	
Information security leaders should avoid the tendency to be insular and myopic in the 
metrics program; look outward to identify best practices through peer comparisons.
