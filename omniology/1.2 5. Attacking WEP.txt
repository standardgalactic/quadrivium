Attacking WEP

• Not spending much time on this
• Not that common anymore
• Sometimes still around in Latin America, 
Africa and Asia
• Still huge in SCADA/ICS and Manufacturing
• New APs often have WEP disabled
Attacking WEP

• Put interface into monitor mode
• Identify the vulnerable WEP network
• Start airodump-ng to capture the IVs
• Use aireplay-ng to do a fake authentication 
with the access point
• Start aireplay-ng in ARP request replay mode 
(listen for ARP and reinject them - generate 
new IVs)
• Run aircrack-ng to obtain the WEP key
