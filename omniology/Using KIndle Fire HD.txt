The Kindle Fire models are known for their excellent screen resolution, 
durability (with Gorilla Glass displays on the HD models), long-lasting 
batteries, and speedy Wi-Fi connections. Their size and weight are well 
engineered for your hand. The sound on the new HDX is significantly louder 
than on the iPad and is clear, even, and crisp even at max volume. Here are 
just some of the features available:
You can access the Internet using the Silk web browser 
 
and check your e-mail using the e-mail app.
You can download from a large library of books straight 
 
to your Kindle and read them everywhere you go. The 
screens have the clean appearance of the Amazon 
Kindle devices.

 
and Twitter to engage with your friends, and take photos 
with the built-in camera and post them directly to your 
Facebook or Twitter pages.

 
Kindle to your TV and watch them on a big screen.
You can choose from a variety of games available in the

 
run Windows 8 from the cloud on your tablet, meaning for 
instance that you have access to your Windows-based 
business apps on your Fire HDX.
You can even keep your kids safe with the built-in 
 
parental controls that allows you to monitor or  
block content.
In the rest of this book, you will explore how to use the Fire, its features,  
and how the significant software works so that you are well equipped to use 
your Fire successfully.

Chapter 2
Initial Setup
This chapter will cover the basics of the initial setup.
Powering On
Power on your device by pressing the small button on the bottom of your 
Kindle.
Once the device has started up, you will see the lock screen. Slide the lock 
with your finger to open your Kindle. The first time you start up your device 
you will need to register it with Amazon.
If you purchased your Kindle from Amazon, it will already be registered to 
you so you will not have to register it again.

CHAPTER 2: Initial Setup
4
Connecting to Wi-Fi
First, select your Wi-Fi from the list of wireless networks detected.  
Your network name (SSID) and password (network key) is usually printed  
on a sticker on the back of your router, DSL, or cable modem.
Enter the network key when prompted.
Registering Your Kindle
Set the time zones to the closest city in your time zone and then tap 
continue.

CHAPTER 2: Initial Setup
5
Enter your Amazon account details. If you don’t have an Amazon account, 
click the Create an account link and follow the instructions to sign up.
When you are done, tap the Register button. This links your Kindle to your 
Amazon account. All Kindle purchases will be paid for using your Amazon 
account payment details and delivered to your Kindle.
You can also add your Facebook or Twitter account. On the confirmation 
screen, click the Get started now link.
Go make yourself a cup of coffee and start using your Kindle.

Using Your Kindle
By now, you’re familiar with tapping to select buttons and other items on 
your Kindle Fire, as shown in the previous chapters.
You can also use several other gestures to interact with your Kindle Fire. 
This chapter will show the basic gestures that you are likely to use daily.
In addition to tapping to select items, you can zoom in on a figure in a book 
or a web site, as shown on the following page. There you can see that by 
pinching the screen you can zoom in or out.

Chapter 6
Device and Cloud Storage
Any content you purchase from Amazon for you Kindle is securely stored 
remotely on Amazon’s servers; the content is said to be stored in the cloud 
and so it is known as cloud storage. The idea is to allow you to access your 
content from anywhere, not just on your home computer or Kindle.  So if for 
instance you happened to have a problem with your device you could still 
retain your data.
Content stored 
remotely on your 
cloud storage
Content stored 
locally on your 
Kindle device
All your music, books, newspapers, and apps are stored on the cloud storage 
and are synched or copied to your device. Depending on your Kindle, you get 
anywhere between 4GB and 16GB of storage on your Kindle.

CHAPTER 6: Device and Cloud Storage
22
Music, photos, documents, and books are all 
stored remotely on Amazon’s Cloud Drive.
Amazon Cloud Storage
Cloud Drive
Cloud Drive is an online storage service that allows you to store files such  
as music, photos, and documents. At the time of writing, you get 5GB free 
on the Cloud Drive. Then you can get 20GB for $10 a year and 50GB for  
$25 a year.
Files can be stored on your Kindle and on the Cloud Drive. Using the Cloud 
Drive app, you can easily transfer files from your PC to your Kindle and  
vice versa.
Accessing the Cloud Drive from a PC
The Cloud Drive app allows you to copy files from a PC onto your Kindle.
On your PC, open your web browser and navigate to
http://www.amazon.com/gp/drive/app-download
In the prompt that appears, click Run.
This will guide you through the installation process. Once installed, you can 
find your Cloud Drive in Favorites in Windows Explorer.

CHAPTER 6: Device and Cloud Storage
23
Click the Cloud Drive icon to show your files on your Cloud Drive, as  
shown below.
You can drag and drop files in to the folders or delete them, as shown in the 
right-hand pane. Just copy them from your libraries.
Securing Your Fire
If you are like most people, you will have data on your device that you would 
not like to lose or be stolen.  If this is the case, it is a good idea to secure 
your device with a password.   Otherwise, your Fire could end up in the 
wrong hands and all of your content would be available to whomever  
found it.
To set a password, swipe your finger down from the top of the screen to 
reveal the Settings menu, tap More, then tap Security, and turn the Lock 
screen password on.

25

You can purchase apps on your Kindle Fire by tapping Store in the top right 
corner of the Apps library screen as circled on the screen shown here.

paid and free apps, and search the App Store by tapping in the Search 
in App Store field and using the keyboard to enter the app name you are 
looking for.
You can explore content categories such as New, Games, Entertainment, 
and Lifestyle.

CHAPTER 7: Games and Apps

your purchase by pressing the green Buy App button. The app will be 
downloaded, installed, and placed in your Apps library.

CHAPTER 7: Games and Apps
28
Tap the app icon in your Apps library to open it up.
From time to time you will probably decide that you no longer wish to keep 
an app on your Kindle Fire.

CHAPTER 7: Games and Apps
29
If this is the case, you can uninstall it. Select Apps from the navigation bar 
on your home screen, tap and hold your finger on the app icon, and select 
Remove from Device from the menu that appears.
Apps can be paid for using the payment details you entered on your 
Amazon account.

album, individual song, or particular genre. In this example, I am playing a 
classical album.
To open an album, tap the album cover.

CHAPTER 9: Music
38
This takes you to the play screen where you can skip tracks, pause, and 
change the volume.
You can search for music at the Amazon MP3 store; to do so, simply tap 
Music from the home screen and then tap Store.
At the top, you will see the Amazon’s featured MP3 deals and promotions. 
In addition, you can browse for music using the New Releases and Genres 
categories. Later in the book, I will discuss downloading music from your PC.

CHAPTER 9: Music

The camera is designed for video chat such as Skype, so taking a 
photograph can be quite tricky since it is a front-facing camera.
To share the photograph, tap the Settings menu and tap Send. Scroll down 
to Facebook if you want to share it on Facebook, or use e-mail, etc.

Chapter 11
Browsing the Web
Amazon Silk is the name of the new web browser, run on Amazon Web 
Services (AWS), for the Kindle Fire. The Internet is accessed using the  
Wi-Fi connection you set up earlier in this book. You can connect to  
any Wi-Fi hotspot in the same way.
Simply tap Web on the navigation bar on the home screen to access 
Amazon Silk.

The sidebar is a new feature that allows you to quickly access bookmarks, 
browsing history, and your most visited web sites.
Quickly access the sidebar from the navigation bar on the Silk web browser.
Silk makes use of tabbed browsing. You can open new tabs for a web page 
by tapping the + on the top right; Silk will show you a list of your most 
visited web sites. You can either tap on the site or type in a search term in 
the Search box.

CHAPTER 11: Browsing the Web
49
One feature I find really useful when browsing the Web on a Kindle is to use 
Silk’s reader function.

CHAPTER 11: Browsing the Web
50
You will find that this option appears in the address bar on most web sites. 
This feature displays a web page as if it were an e-book and makes reading

Setting up E-mail
The Kindle Fire contains an e-mail app allowing you to get your e-mail.  
You can launch the app by tapping the E-mail icon in the Apps library.
Email Icon
Kindle Fire e-mail supports Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Hotmail, and AOL. It also 
supports many other industry-standard IMAP and POP e-mail systems. So 
to use your existing account, you will want to set up your email account on 
the Fire.
To get started, tap the icon for the type of e-mail account you have. In this 
case, I am adding a Hotmail account, but the principle applies to the others 
as well.

CHAPTER 12: Setting up E-mail
54
Then type in your e-mail address, password, and a description (e.g., Hotmail 
account). You can also choose to make that address your default account 
so that any messages you send from your Fire will be from that address.

CHAPTER 12: Setting up E-mail
55
Predictive text bar 
starts to guess the 
word you are typing. 
If a word appears in 
this bar,tap on it to 
save you typing the 
whole word.
Make default 
e-mail address.
Not all of your email accounts may be free. You may receive a message 
telling you that you might have to pay for a premium or Plus subscription 
to get POP access to your e-mail. Most are still provided free (Gmail and 
Hotmail).
You can open an e-mail by tapping on it in your inbox, as shown below.

CHAPTER 12: Setting up E-mail
56
You can now access your e-mail at any time by tapping the e-mail icon in 
the Apps library.

or month.

CHAPTER 13: Calendar and Skype
59
Skype Your Friends
Skype allows you to instant message (chat) between users on Skype around 
the world. Tap Apps from the menu on the home screen and tap Skype.
You will need to sign in with either a Microsoft account or a Skype account. 
If you don’t have one, tap Create a Skype Account and follow the directions.
Once you are in, give your friends your Skype account id or address and 
they can call you and have a video chat.

CHAPTER 13: Calendar and Skype
60
Skype is great way to keep in touch with family living in other countries or 
friends that live a long way from you. Plus, Skype is free and more personal 
than a phone call or e-mail.
To add a contact, tap the little contact icon shown below and enter their 
Skype id. This will add their name to your contact list. To call them, just tap 
on their name.

61
Chapter 14
Watching Videos
You can watch videos and films you get from Amazon using a LoveFilm 
subscription. You can watch them on your Kindle screen or, if you prefer a 
more cinematic experience, you can hook up your Kindle Fire HD to your  
TV using a Micro HDMI cable. To do so, plug the large end into the back 
of your TV and the mini end into the side of your Kindle. Newer TVs will 
support HDMI.
Watch your film in glorious high definition.

The process for accessing videos is similar to the other applications we 
have discussed and we will use YouTube as an example in the following 
section. One area that may trip you up though is Flash. While Flash is 
supported by Silk, it is disabled by default despite being widely used still on 
the net. To enable Flash you need to use the Silk Settings menu. Then follow 
the directions to enable Flash.
If you haven’t updated your Kindle Fire to the latest software version 
available, this setting can be accessed by tapping the Enable plug-ins option.
To update your Kindle Fire to the latest software version, visit
http://www.amazon.com/Kindlesoftwareupdates

You can view YouTube videos on your Kindle Fire by opening up your web 
browser and browse to
http://m.youtube.com

Then you can tap the magnifying glass icon to search for a video.
When watching videos, they look better if you have your Kindle in landscape 
orientation.

CHAPTER 14: Watching Videos

If you have connected your Kindle to your HD-ready TV, you can watch 
these videos on a big screen.
To close your video, swipe your finger across the screen from the right edge

You can also download a YouTube app free from the App Store. Just search 
for “YouTube” in the App Store.

Chapter 15
Adding Your Music
One of Kindle’s many functions is the capability to stream or download 
music from your Amazon Cloud Drive. Go to the following web site on your 
computer and sign in:
 
http://www.amazon.com/cloudplayer
Uploading From Your PC
Go to the Amazon MP3 page and click the Cloud Player banner in the 
upper-right corner.

CHAPTER 15: Adding Your Music
68
Sign in with your Amazon account and click the Import your music option 
from the upper-left corner and then click the Download Now button to 
download the MP3 Uploader.
Once downloaded, open the Uploader and follow the instructions to install it.
Once installed, the Uploader will scan your computer’s hard drive for MP3s 
to upload. After scanning finishes, select the MP3s you want uploaded and 
click the Start upload button.
Depending on how much music you have to upload, this may take a while, 
so go make a cup of coffee (or tea if you prefer).
If you have a large amount of music on your machine, it is best to select  
Edit Selections.

CHAPTER 15: Adding Your Music
69
This gives you the option of manually selecting the music you want on your 
Kindle. Choose wisely; you only have 250-song capacity on the free cloud.
You will get a warning when you are near your limit.

CHAPTER 15: Adding Your Music
70
Finding Music on Your Kindle Fire
Make sure you’ve signed in with the Amazon account for the music you just 
uploaded and tap the Music tab. Then tap the Cloud tab.
There you’ll see your uploaded music. If you’re on a Wi-Fi connection, you 
can either tap a song to stream it or tap and hold your finger on the screen 
for a few seconds to download it to your Kindle.
If you uploaded quite a few songs, reveal the Settings menu by swiping your 
finger down from the top of the screen and tap Sync.
Once downloaded, you can access your songs in your Music library by 
tapping Device and finding them there. 

71
Chapter 16
Parental Controls
The parental controls allow you to seal off access (through password 
protection) to areas on your Fire that you may not want people to access 
at a somewhat granular level. Obviously, children are a significant target of 
this protection, but this area allows you to prevent access to specific areas 
such as email or your contacts to other people who you might allow on your 
device. To access this area, on your home screen, swipe down from the top 
edge to reveal the settings bar.
Tap More.

CHAPTER 16: Parental Controls
72
Then select the Parental Controls option. Enter a password and then you 
can modify the Parental Control settings on your Fire.

CHAPTER 16: Parental Controls
73
From this menu, you can password protect features such as your web 
browser, email, videos, music, your photos, your documents, access to  
Wi-Fi or purchasing content on Amazon.com. So these features are not just 
for kids.
Blocking certain types of content from the Parental Controls screen will 
remove that item from the Kindle navigation bar at the top of the home 
screen.
After you have made your selections, tap the back arrow in the lower part of 
the Parental Controls menu.
Kindle FreeTime
The Kindle Store offers a wide array of content that may or may not be 
suitable or of any interest for your children. Kindle FreeTime is designed to 
enable access to age-appropriate content for your children. The best part is 
you can set up six users on your Fire. So you can have different settings for 
each of your children if you wish.

CHAPTER 16: Parental Controls
74
Amazon’s Kindle FreeTime app makes this possible by allowing you to set 
up a library of content that’s educational and appropriate for different age 
ranges.
The content in the FreeTime library is free to FreeTime subscribers.
Each child sees only the books, videos, and apps in the FreeTime library 
and any additional content you added.
You can’t exit the Kindle FreeTime app without the Parental Controls 
password. This prevents them from accessing other content on the Kindle 
Fire without your permission.
Daily Time Limits
Another nice feature of FreeTime is it gives parents the ability to set daily 
time limits for reading books, watching TV shows and movies, and using 
apps. As you can imagine, this is a huge plus for parents who want to limit 
game time to an hour or two a day without affecting their child’s desire to 
read for hours on end.
Setting Up FreeTime and Adding Content
To set up FreeTime, download the app from the Amazon Store and tap on it 
to launch.
Enter your Parental Controls password. Then create a user account, input all 
the necessary information, and tap Next. You can add up to six profiles.

CHAPTER 16: Parental Controls
75
Tap the photo box to add a photo or picture to the profile.
Enter your child’s name in the text box, select their gender and birthday, and 
tap Next at the bottom of the screen. Your child’s profile is complete.
Once the profile is created, you can open FreeTime and tap your child’s 
profile image to put the Kindle Fire HD in FreeTime mode.
Tap to launch 
profile before 
handing the 
Kindle to your 
child.
Tap to add or 
remove 
content.
Tap to set how much 
time you want your 
child to spend on the 
Kindle; the screen 
locks after time is up.
Add, remove, or 
update a child’s 
profile.

CHAPTER 16: Parental Controls
76
To manually add content to your child’s profile, launch the FreeTime app and 
tap Manage Content & Subscription at the bottom of the page.
Enter your password and tap Manage Your Content. You can then view and 
manage a list of the books, videos, and apps that you own on your account. 
From this screen, you can tap the item you want to make available on their 
FreeTime account.
Once FreeTime is running in the background, your children can’t leave the 
application without entering the Parental Controls password, so you should 
keep this password a secret.
Setting the Daily Time Limits
As mentioned before, FreeTime also allows you to limit the amount of time 
your child can use the Kindle.

CHAPTER 16: Parental Controls
77
To choose daily time limits, tap Total Screen Time and move the slider to the 
appropriate amount of time you want your child to use the Kindle.
You can also put a limit on different content types. To restrict each specific 
content type, select Content Activity Time and then set the amount of time 
you want your child to be able to read books, watch videos, or use apps.
Tap the back arrow to save your settings.

79
Chapter 17
Sending Documents  
to the Kindle
Documents can be sent to your Kindle by e-mailing them to your Kindle 
email address. The email address is on your Amazon account page. 
Alternatively, you can add files directly by connecting the Kindle to your 
computer.
Now, Amazon offers a Windows/ Mac application, Send to Kindle, which 
provides a simple solution for you to send documents from your PC to your 
Kindle Fire. On Windows, you simply right click from Windows Explorer. You 
can also send a document from any Windows program by choosing print, 
then selecting Send to Kindle as a printer option. This chapter will discuss 
how to set up Send to Kindle and discuss all of the file sending options in 
more detail.

CHAPTER 17: Sending Documents to the Kindle 
80
Installation
Go to the following website, download and install the Send to Kindle 
program on your PC with Windows 7 and 8 or Mac OS.
http://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle/pc
You will be asked to register Send to Kindle, and you will enter your Amazon 
account e-mail address, the password, and click the Register button.

CHAPTER 17: Sending Documents to the Kindle 
81
Sending from Windows Explorer
In Windows Explorer on your PC, right-click on a document you want to 
send to your Kindle, and select Send to Kindle.

CHAPTER 17: Sending Documents to the Kindle 
82
If you want to send more than one document, you can select files while 
holding down the Ctrl key. Then when you have them selected, click Send 
to Kindle.
This may take a few minutes; check your Kindle to see if your documents 
have been delivered. Document and graphic file types such as .doc, .jpeg, 
and so on (other than PDF) will be converted automatically to Kindle format.
You may need to sync your Kindle if your documents do not go through. You 
can do this by going to the Settings menu and tapping on Sync. The maximum 
file size is 50 MB and if you are storing your documents on the Amazon Cloud, 
you have 5GBs of storage space.

CHAPTER 17: Sending Documents to the Kindle 
83
Sending from a Print Dialog
To send a document from a Windows program, select Print, and then 
choose Send to Kindle as your printer from the drop down menu.

CHAPTER 17: Sending Documents to the Kindle 
84
When the Send to Kindle window pops up, you will need to select from the 
options on the screen shown below and then click the Send button.
Once you click send, your file will be uploaded to Amazon cloud and you will 
be able to download it to your Kindle. You can find your document in the 
docs section on the menu.

CHAPTER 17: Sending Documents to the Kindle 
85
Caution  Do not mess with any of the directories here as you can 
seriously mess up your Kindle. I would suggest you keep to the following 
directories:
Documents
Music
Pictures
Videos
Leave the rest alone!
To get started, Open Windows Explorer by clicking your Explorer icon in 
the task bar. Scroll down to the Computer section in the Windows Explorer 
window.
In the left-hand pane you should see Libraries. This is where Windows 
stores all your personal files.
Note that in the Libraries section you see the four directories in the Caution 
at the start of this section.
Further down the left-hand pane, under Computer, you should see Kindle.  
If you open this up, you will see all the directories common to your computer 
and your Kindle device.
Adding Files Using Explorer
If you plug your Kindle into your computer, you can access it using Windows 
Explorer as shown below (Mac users can find it in the Finder window).

CHAPTER 17: Sending Documents to the Kindle 
86
Adding a File
You can find files in your Libraries section in Windows Explorer. For example, 
click your Music library, and then from the right-hand pane, drag the file you 
want from your computer’s Music section into the Music folder representing 
your Kindle. It helps to arrange your windows as shown below so that you 
can see the Kindle directories.

CHAPTER 17: Sending Documents to the Kindle 
87
Once you are done, you can find the newly added track in the Music library 
on your device, as shown below.
