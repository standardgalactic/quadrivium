Preface
Introduction to Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) 
RFID is a wireless modulation and demodulation technique for the automatic 
identification of objects, the tracking of goods, smart logistics, and access control. 
RFID is a contactless, usually short distance transmission and reception technique 
for unique ID data transfer from a tagged object to an interrogator (reader). The 
generic configuration of an RFID system comprises: (i) an ID data-carrying tag; 
(ii) a reader; (iii) middleware; and (iv) an enterprise application. The reader inter­
rogates the tag with the RF signal, and the tag, in return, responds with an ID 
signal. Middleware controls the reader and processes the signal, and finally feeds 
into the enterprise application software in the IT layer for further processing. The 
RFID technology has the potential to replace barcodes due to its large information-
carrying capacity, flexibility in operation, and versatility of application [1]. Due to 
its unique identification, tracing, and tracking capabilities, RFID also gives value-
added services incorporating various sensors for real-time monitoring of assets and 
public installations in many fields. However, the penetration of RFID technology 
is hindered due to its high price tag, and many ambitious projects have stalled due 
to the cost of the chips in the tags. Chipless RFID tags mitigate the cost issues and 
have the potential to penetrate mass markets for low-cost item tagging [2]. Due to 
its cost advantages and unique features, chipless RFID will dominate 60% of the 
total RFID market with a market value of $4 billion by 2019 [3]. Since the removal 
of the microchip causes a chipless tag to have no intelligence-processing capability, 
the signal processing is done only in the reader. Consequently, a fully new set of 
requirements and challenges need to be incorporated and addressed, respectively, 
in a chipless RFID tag reader. This book addresses the new reader architecture and 
integration techniques for reading various chipless RFID tags. 
Recent Development of Chipless RFID Tags
IDTechEx (2009) [3] predicts that 60% of the total tag market will be occupied by 
the chipless tag if the tag can be made at a cost of less than one cent. However, the 
removal of an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) from the tag is not a

trivial task, as it performs many RF signal and information-processing tasks. Inten­
sive investigation and investment are required for the design of low-cost but robust 
passive microwave circuits and antennas using low-conductivity ink on low-cost 
and lossy substrates. Some types of chipless RFID tags are made of microwave reso­
nant structures using conductive ink. Obtaining high fidelity (high quality factor) 
responses from microwave passive circuits made of low-conductivity ink on low-
cost and lossy materials is very difficult [4]. Great design flexibility is required to 
meet the benchmark of reliable and high fidelity performance from these low-grade 
laminates and poor conductivity ink. This exercise has opened up a new discipline 
in microwave printing electronics in low grade laminates [5]. 
The low-cost chipless tag will place new demands on the reader as new fields 
of applications open up. IDTechEx [3] predicts that, while optical barcodes are 
printed in only a few billion per year, close to one trillion (>700 billion) chipless 
RFIDs will be printed each year. The chipless RFID has unique features and much 
wider ranges of applications compared to optical barcodes. However, very little 
progress has been achieved in the development of the chipless RFID tag reader and 
its control software. This is because conventional methods of reading RFID tags 
are not implementable in chipless RFID tags. For example, hand-shaking protocol 
cannot be implemented in chipless RFID tags. Dedicated chipless RFID tag readers 
and middleware [6] need to be developed to read these tags reliably. 
The development of chipless RFID has reached its second generation with more 
data capacity, reliability, and compliance to some existing standards. For example, 
RF-SAW tags have new standards, can be made smaller with higher data capac­
ity, and currently are being sold in millions [7]. Approximately thirty companies 
have been developing TFTC tags. TFTC tags target the HF (13.65 MHz) frequency 
band (60% of existing RFID market) and have read-write capability [7]. However, 
neither RF-SAW nor TFTC is printable and cannot reach sub-cent level prices. In 
generation-1 of conductive ink-based fully printable chipless RFID tag develop­
ment, few chipless RFID tags—which are in the inception stage—have been report­
ed in the open literature. They include: a capacitive gap coupled dipole array [8]; a 
reactively-loaded transmission line [9]; a ladder network [10]; and finally, a piano 
and a Hilbert curve fractal resonators [11]. These tags are in prototype stage and 
no further development to commercial grade has been reported to date. A compre­
hensive review of chipless RFID can be found in Author’s most recent books [12].
Following twenty years of RF and microwave research experiences, we have 
pioneered multi-bit chipless RFID research [13–14]. For the last eight and a half 
years at Monash University, our research activities include numerous chipless tag 
and reader developments as follows.    
At Monash University, our research group has developed a number of print­
able, multi-bit chipless tags featuring high data capacity. These tags can be cat­
egorized into two types: retransmission-based and backscattered-based. The re­
transmission-based tag, originally presented by Preradovic et al. [13], uses two 
orthogonally-polarized wideband monopole antennas and a series of spiral reso­
nators. The RFID reader sends a UWB signal to the tag, and the receiving an­
tenna of the tag receives it and passes through the microstrip transmission line. 
The gap-coupled spiral resonators-based stop band filters create attenuations and 
phase jumps in designated frequency bands. This magnitude and phase encoded 
signal is then retransmitted back to the reader by the tag’s transmitting antenna. 

Backscatter-Based Chipless Tag

The attenuation in the received signal due to the resonator encodes the data bits. 
In two Australian Research Council (ARC) Grants (DP0665523: Chipless RFID 
for Barcode Replacement, 2006–2008 and LP0989652:  Printable Multi-Bit Radio 
Frequency Identification for Banknotes, 2009–2011), we developed up to 128 data 
bits of chipless RFID with four slot-loaded monopole antennas and wideband feed 
networks [15]. This chipless tag is fully printable on polymer substrate.  
Backscatter-Based Chipless Tag
Balbin et al. [13] have presented a multi-antenna backscattered chipless tag. Here, 
only the resonator structure is present on the tag, and as no transmitter-receiver tag 
antenna exists, it is more compact than retransmission type tags. The interrogation 
signal from a reader is backscattered by the tag. By analyzing this backscattered 
signal’s attenuation at particular frequencies, the tag ID is decoded. 
Monash University Chipless RFID Systems
Under various research grant schemes, the authors have developed various chipless 
RFID tag reader architectures and associated signal processing schemes. To date 
four different varieties of chipless RFID tag readers have been developed for the 
2.45, 4–8, and 22–26.5 GHz frequency bands. Feasibility studies of advanced level 
detection [13] and error correction algorithm have been developed. 
As stated above, our group has developed five different varieties of chipless 
RFID tag readers in various frequency bands at 2.45, 4–8, and 22–26.5 GHz fre­
quency bands. The readers comprised an RF transceiver section, a digital control 
section, and middleware (control and processing). The reader transmitter com­
prises a swept frequency, voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) [6, 16]. The VCO 
is controlled by a tuning voltage that is generated by a digital-to-analog converter 
(DAC). Each frequency over the ultra-wide band (UWB) from 4–8 GHz is gener­
ated with a single tuning voltage from the ADC. In addition, the VCO has a finite 
settling time to generate a CW signal against its tuning voltage. Combining all these 
operational requirements and linearity of the devices, the UWB signal generation 
is a slow process (taking a few seconds to read a tag). To alleviate this problem 
and improve the reading speed, some corrective measures can be taken. They are: 
(i) high speed ADC and (ii) low settling time VCO. These two devices will be ex­
tremely expensive if available in the market. The reader cost will be very high to 
cater for the requirement specifications of the chipless RFID reader. In this regard, 
signal processing for advanced detection techniques alleviate the reading process 
in greater details. Also, the sensitivity of the reader architecture using dual antenna 
in bi-static radar configuration and I/Q modulation techniques can be greatly en­
hanced. Highly sensitive receiver design is imperative in detecting very weak back­
scattering signal from the chipless tag. With the presence of interferers and move­
ment and the variable trajectory of the moving tags, this situation is worsened. In 
this regard, a highly sensitive UWB reader-receiver needs to be designed. Designing 
such a receiver is not a trivial task where the power transmission is limited by UWB

regulations. I\Q modulation in the receiver will improve the sensitivity to a greater 
magnitude. 
In addition to this high-sensitivity receiver design, a high-end digital board with 
a powerful algorithm will alleviate the reading process. The digital board serves as 
the centerpiece of the reader, where data would be processed and numerous control 
signals to the RF section of the reader would be generated. The digital board has a 
Joint Test Action Group (JTAG) port where a host PC can be connected to moni­
tor, control, and reprogram the reader if necessary. In addition, it is also the host to 
the power supply circuit that is used to generate the necessary supply voltages for 
most components of the reader. The digital board consists of: (i) an FPGA board 
with ADC; (ii) a power supply circuit; and (iii) a digital-to-analogue converter 
(DAC). High sampling rate A\D and D\A converters and a FPGA controller will 
augment the powerful capturing and processing of backscattering signals. The digi­
tal electronics and interface with a PC will accommodate custom-made powerful 
algorithm, such as singular value decomposition for improved detection [17], time 
frequency analysis [18] for localization [19], or anticollision [20] of chipless RFID 
tags. All these control algorithms and signal processing software will be innova­
tions in the field. This book has addressed these advanced level analog and digital 
designs of the chipless RFID reader. 
Antennas form a significant part of the chipless RFID tag readers [21]. Polar­
ization mismatch and low gain of antenna are the two pressing problems in chipless 
RFID tag reading.  Dual-polarized and circularly-polarized tags and reader anten­
nas will alleviate the mismatch in the polarization. Mismatch of the signal by the 
presence of interferers will create major challenges for reading the tag. Similar to 
3-D scanning optical barcode readers, multistate reader antennas with polariza­
tion diversity and beam scanning may alleviate the problem to some degree. Array 
antennas have solved low-gain issues. This will need a significant innovation in the 
development of reconfigurable antennas that will generate both polarization and 
beam reconfigurabilities. In the physical layer development, a smart antenna with 
beam and/or polarization-agile reconfigurability is required to track and read the 
mobile tag. In the UWB chipless RFID reader systems, two varieties of smart anten­
nas, such as switched beam (SB) and phased array with polarization diversity, can 
be employed. The SB antenna comprises broadband antenna elements, a switching 
network, and an RF input port. The phased array has a more complex feed net­
work with phase shifter modules and summing circuits. Our research group has de­
veloped a multilayered shared aperture dual-polarized patch antenna for mm-wave 
UWB band [22]. The phase shifter and switching electronics modules have also 
been developed in other projects led by us. A full chapter is dedicated to address 
the various challenges of broadband high gain fixed beam and smart antennas for 
the chipless RFID reader. 
In a conventional chipped RFID system, established protocols are readily avail­
able for tag detection and collision avoidance. Reading hundreds of proximity tags 
with the flick of an eye is commonplace. However, as stated above, reading mul­
tiple chipless RFID tags in close proximity has not been demonstrated as yet. RFID 
middleware is an IT layer to process the captured data from a tag by a reader. 
Middleware applies filtering, formatting, or logic to tag data captured by a reader

so that the data can be processed by a software application. For chipped RFID, 
there are established protocols for these tasks. However, in chipless RFID, tasks 
such as hand-shaking are not possible. Therefore, a completely new set of IT layers 
needs to be developed. Raw data obtained from a chipless tag needs to be processed 
and denoised, and new techniques need to be developed. A companion book will 
address these issues of chipless RFID tag detection, data integrity, and anticollision. 
This book aims to provide the reader with comprehensive information with the 
recent development of chipless RFID tags, associated chipless RFID tag readers, 
and their relevant detection and signal processing both in the physical layer devel­
opment and the software development algorithm and protocols. To serve this goal, 
this book features ten chapters in three sections. They offer in-depth descriptions 
of terminologies and concepts relevant to chipless RFID tags, and RF transceivers, 
antennas, digital design, system integration, detection algorithm and anticollision 
protocols related to the chipless RFID reader system.  
The chapters of the book are organized into three distinct topics: 
••
Operating Principle of Chipless RFID System; 
••
Reader Architecture of Chipless RFID;
••
Physical Layer Development of Chipless RFID Tag Reader. 
In first Chapters 1 and 2, chipless RFID fundamentals with a comprehensive 
overview are discussed. The overview and the recent development of chipless RFID 
reader systems are discussed in Chapter 3. These chapters form the foundation for 
the rest chapters of the book. Usually, researchers tend to ignore the physical layer 
development of reader architecture with the perception that RFID reader architec­
ture is an established discipline. However, a physical layer implementation of the 
chipless RFID reader is a fully new domain of research. This is the first book in a 
new discipline. To fulfill the goal of this book, the comprehensive physical layer 
development of the reader components such as antennas, RF components, digi­
tal design, and integration of these blocks into a complete physical chipless RFID 
reader are discussed in Chapters 7–10. Finally, a state-of-the-art chipless RFID tag 
reader that incorporates all the physical and IT layer developments stated above 
are discussed in the last few sections of Chapter 10. Chapter 10 also demonstrates 
how the reader can mitigate tag readings in challenging environments such as re­
tails, libraries, and warehouses.
In this book, utmost care has been paid to keep the sequential flow of infor­
mation related to the chipless RFID reader architecture and signal processing. We 
hope that the book will serve as a good reference of chipless RFID systems and will 
pave the ways for further motivation and research in the field.

Foreword
Radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology is a powerful identification tech­
nology that has many useful applications. However, high implementation cost lim­
its its applicability in many cases. The most expensive item in an RFID tag is the 
application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) microchip. Considerable effort has 
been made to remove the ASIC chip from RFID tags to make them cheap and fully 
printable. However, printing microwave circuits on a low-cost material is not a 
trivial task. A considerable amount of design flexibility and high-precision printing 
with high-conductivity ink are needed to fabricate microwave circuits with these 
types of materials. Furthermore, reading of the tag is highly challenging due to its 
low-fidelity response. No conventional protocols can be invoked in the chipless 
RFID tag because they have no on-board signal processing capability. To make the 
technology operational, a new type of RFID reader, a chipless reader, is needed. The 
proposed book deals with chipless RFID reader architecture and integration.
The book is organized into three sections covering various aspects of chipless 
RFID tag design and reader architecture. Sections 1 and 2 present a general over­
view and then move on to in-depth coverage of the operating principles of fre­
quency, time, and hybrid domain chipless RFID tag technologies and their dedi­
cated reader architectures. The third section covers the component-level designs, 
including ultra-wideband antenna design and development of the physical layer 
and information technology (IT) layer. It also considers the passive and active com­
ponents that are required to develop fully integrated transceivers at the RF, micro­
wave and millimeter-wave frequency bands. The design of the digital components 
is also included in this section. The section ends with a discussion of the integra­
tion of all components into a complete physical layer and IT layer technology for 
chipless RFID readers. New concepts are proposed for a chipless RFID reader with 
frequency domain swept frequency interrogation signals and ultra-wideband im­
pulse radio signals. The final chapter of the book presents the integration of the 
chipless RFID reader and a few specific applications.  
I believe this well-written book is the first published book on the chipless RFID 
reader architecture. I sincerely hope that this book with its comprehensive coverage 
will be a good resource for the RFID research community.

Introduction 
1.1  Chipless RFID 
In the current era of information communication technology, radio-frequency iden­
tification (RFID) has been going through tremendous development. RFID tech­
nology has the potential to replace barcodes due to its large information carrying 
capacity, flexibility in operations, and versatility in applications. With the advent of 
low-powered ICs, energy scavenging techniques, and low-cost chipless tags, RFID 
technology has achieved significant advancements [1]. Due to its unique features of 
identification and its tracing and tracking capabilities, RFID also provides value-
added services incorporating various sensors for real-time monitoring of assets, 
public installations, and people from various backgrounds. However, the penetra­
tion of RFID technology is hindered due to its high price tag, and many ambitious 
projects have been stalled due to the cost of chipped tags. Chipless RFID tags, how­
ever, mitigate the cost issues and have the potential to penetrate mass markets for 
low-cost item tagging [2]. Since the removal of the microchip causes a chipless tag 
to have no intelligence processing capabilities, signal processing is done only in the 
reader. Consequently, a fully new set of requirements needs to be incorporated and 
addressed, respectively, in a chipless RFID tag reader. This book addresses the new 
reader architecture and signal processing techniques of the novel chipless RFID tag 
readers in various chapters and should be a very useful resource in this new field.
RFID is an emerging wireless technology for automatic identification, access 
control, asset tracking, security and surveillance, database management, inventory 
control, and logistics. A generic RFID system has two main components: a tag 
and a reader [3]. As shown in Figure 1.1, the reader sends an interrogating radio-
frequency (RF) signal to the tag. The interrogation signal comprises a clock signal, 
data, and energy. In return the tag responds with a unique identification code (data) 
to the reader. The reader processes the returned signal from the tag into a meaning­
ful identification code. Some tags coupled with sensors can also provide data on 
the surrounding environment such as temperature, pressure, moisture content, ac­
celeration, and location. The tags are classified into active, semiactive, and passive 
tags based on their on-board power supplies. An active tag contains an on-board 
battery to energize the processing chip and to amplify signals. A semiactive tag also 
contains a battery, but the battery is used only to energize the chip; hence it yields

Introduction 
better longevity compared to an active tag. A passive tag does not have a battery. It 
scavenges power for its processing chip from the interrogating signal emitted by a 
reader; hence it lasts forever. However, the processing power and reading distance 
are limited by the transmitted power (energy) of the reader. The middleware does 
the back-end processing, command and control, and interfacing with enterprise 
application as shown in Figure 1.1.
As mentioned earlier, the main constraint of mass deployment of RFID tags for 
low-cost item tagging is the cost of the tag. The main cost comes from the appli­
cation-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or the microchip of the tag. According to 
the respected RFID research organization IDTechEx [4], in 2019 an ASIC-based 
chipped tag will cost approximately 4 cents compared to 0.4 cent for a chipless tag. 
The costs for materials, the curing procedure, and lamination are of similar magni­
tudes for both types of tags. Therefore, the ASIC makes up 90% of the cost of an 
RFID tag. In addition, a chipless tag does not have any chip placement costs and 
soldering is not required. This will reduce the cost of a chipless tags even further. 
If the chip can be removed without losing functionality of the tag, then chi­
pless tags can have the potential to replace optical barcodes. The optical barcode 
has several operating limitations: (1) each barcode is individually read, (2) their 
use requires human intervention, (3) they have less data handling capability, (4) 
soiled barcodes cannot be read, and (5) barcodes require line-of-sight operation. 
Despite these limitations, the low cost benefit of the optical barcode makes it very 
attractive because it is printed almost without any extra cost. Therefore, there is 
a pressing need to remove the ASIC from RFID tags to make them competitive in 
mass deployment situations. If the chipless tag can be produced with costs in the 
sub-cent range, it will have the potential to provide low-cost item-level tagging, 
thus coexisting with or replacing the trillions of optical barcodes printed each year. 
The solution is to make the RFID tag chipless. Similar to optical barcodes, the tag 
should be fully printable on low-cost substrates such as papers and plastics [5]. A 
reliable prediction by IDTechEx [2] advocates that 60% of the total tag market 
will be occupied by the chipless tag if the tag can be made for less than 1 cent. 
However, removal of an ASIC from the tag is not a trivial task because it performs 
many RF signal and information processing tasks. Tremendous investigation and 
investment will be needed to design low-cost but robust passive microwave circuits 
and antennas using conductive ink on low-cost substrates. Additionally, obtaining

a high-fidelity response from low-cost lossy materials is very difficult [5]. In the 
interrogation and decoding aspects of the RFID system, we must take into account 
the development of the RFID reader, which must be capable of reading the chipless 
RFID tag. Little progress has been achieved in the development of a chipless RFID 
tag reader. This is due to the fact that conventional methods of reading RFID tags 
cannot be implemented with chipless RFID tags. Dedicated chipless RFID tag read­
ers [6] need to be developed to read those tags reliably. This book is the first of its 
kind to report on the most recent developments in reader architectures, physical 
layer developments, detection methods, and signal processing of the various types 
of chipless RFID tag readers.
The quest to develop low-cost RFID tags in the very low cost sub-cent range 
has opened up a new discipline. A very comprehensive account of the most recent 
developments in chipless RFID tags in the commercial domain can be obtained 
from [2]. Due to price advantages and some unique features that are not obtainable 
in silicon tags, the chipless RFID tag market is estimated to grow exponentially. 
As forecast by IDTechEx, the market volume for chipless RFID technology was 
less than $5 million in 2009. However, this market will grow to approximately 
$4 billion in 2019 [4, 7]. In contrast to the 4 to 5 billion optical barcodes that are 
printed yearly, approximately 700 billion chipless tags will be sold in 2019. How­
ever, the price of the chipless RFID system (readers and middleware) will remain 
the same. A significant proportion of the chipless tag types are thin-film transistor 
circuit (TFTC) tags, surface acoustic wave (SAW) tags, microwave passive circuits 
(radar arrays), and ink strips. This book presents reader architectures and signal 
processing designs that target the latter two chipless RFID tag types. These two 
tag types will offer the lowest price of all chipless tag types and hence development 
of the interrogators of these tags will occupy significant space in the research and 
development sectors. 
The development of chipless RFID technology has reached its second genera­
tion with more data capacity, reliability, and compliance with some existing stan­
dards. For example, RF SAW tags have new standards, can be made smaller with 
a higher data capacity, and currently are being sold in the millions. Approximately 
30 companies have been developing TFTC tags. TFTC targets the HF (13.65-MHz) 
band (60% of existing RFID market) and has read-write capability [7].
In the first generation, only a few chipless RFID tags, which were at the incep­
tion stage, were reported in the open literature. They include a capacitive gap-
coupled dipole array [8], a reactively loaded transmission line [9], a ladder network 
[10], and a Peano and a Hilbert curve fractal resonator [11]. These tags were in 
the prototype stage and no further developments for commercial use have been 
reported so far. 
Realizing that chipless RFID technology is the only path forward for compet­
ing with optical barcodes, and foreseeing the lucrative market potentials in chipless 
RFID tags, big industry players such as IBM, Xerox, Toshiba, Microsoft, HP, and 
new players such as Kavio and Inksure have been investing tremendously in the 
development of low-cost chipped and chipless RFID. Figure 1.2 shows the moti­
vational factors for developing chipless RFID tags and reader systems. The data 
shown in the figure have been approximated from two sources [4, 6]. Currently, 
conventional chipped tags cost more than 10¢ each if purchased in large quanti­
ties. This high tag price hinders mass deployment of RFID in low-cost, item-level

Introduction 
tagging. The goal is to develop sub-cent chipless tags that will augment the low-
cost, item-level tagging. The technological advancements in both chipless tags and 
their readers and peripherals will create an approximately $4 billion market by 
2019 [4, 7]. 
According to [7], the revenue generated in the global chipless RFID market is 
expected to reach $3,925 million in 2016 from $1,087 million in 2011, at an es­
timated combined annual growth rate of 29.3% from 2011 to 2016. The targeted 
market sectors for chipless RFID technology include retail stores, supply chain 
management, access cards, airline luggage tagging, aged care and general health­
care, public transit, and library database management systems.
Significant strides have been achieved in tagging not only polymer banknotes 
but also many low-cost items such as books, postage stamps, secured documents, 
bus tickets, and hanging cloth tags. The technology relies on encoding spectral sig­
natures and decoding the amplitude and phase of the spectral signature [12]. The 
other methods are phase encoding of backscattered spectral signals [13] and time 
domain delay lines [14]. So far more than 20 varieties of chipless RFID tags and 
five generations of readers have been designed by this team. The proof-of-concept 
technology is being transferred to the banknote polymer and paper for low-cost 
item tagging. These tags have the potential to coexist or replace the trillions of opti­
cal barcodes printed each year. To this end it is imperative to invest in low-loss con­
ducting ink, high-resolution printing processes, and characterization of the lami­
nates on which the tag will be printed. The design of a spectral signature-based tag 
needs to push in higher-frequency bands to accommodate the increased number of 
data bits in the chipless tag to compete with the optical barcode. In this space, the 
reader design needs to accommodate large reading distance and high-speed read­
ing, multiple tag reading in proximity, error correction coding, and anticollision 
protocols. Also wide acceptance of RFID technology by consumers and businesses

requires robust privacy and security protection [15]. The goal of this book is to ad­
dress all of the issues mentioned above to make the chipless RFID system a viable 
commercial product for mass deployment.  
Figure 1.3 shows the salient features of a chipless RFID tag and Figure 1.4 
shows the burdens a chipless RFID tag reader faces to meet market demands. While 
industry (market) focuses on compatibility of the new tags and readers with the 
existing standards and operational cultures, available technologies, and on-the-
shelf products, and finally, huge profit margin, it is not a trivial task for a dedicated 
chipless RFID tag reader to meet all requirements. Figure 1.4 shows the chipless 
RFID system, which needs to address a whole spectrum of technical and regulatory 
requirements such as the number of data bits to be read and processed, operating 
frequencies, radiated (transmitted) power levels and hence reading distance, mode 
for reading (time, frequency, or hybrid domain), compatibility with existing tech­
nological framework, simultaneous multiple tag reading, and resulting anticollision

Introduction 
and security issues. All of these considerations will impact the development and 
commercialization of the new technology. IDTechEx [4] reports on chipless RFID 
tag development by commercial entities and highlights the synergies required to 
address these issues and make the chipless RFID a commercially viable and com­
petitive technology.
1.2  Chipless RFID Tag Reader
As advocated by IDTechEx [4], the chipless RFID tag readers and data processing 
software will have costs similar to those for their chipped counterparts. The market 
segment of hardware and related middleware is more than the cost of tags used. 
Therefore, there is a huge commercial potential to invest in readers and related 
software development. However, very few resources on chipless RFID reader sys­
tems are available in the open literature. This is the first initiative by an author to 
introduce the potential field in a combined and comprehensive body of literature. 
The book covers the following topics in the field:
1.	 Introduction to chipless RFID;
2.	 Chipless RFID reader architecture;
3.	 Physical layer development of chipless RFID reader.
As mentioned above the chipless RFID will impact low-cost item tagging in 
this millennium. We provide readers with comprehensive coverage of chipless RFID 
tags and reader systems as shown in Figure 1.5. The book reports on the most re­
cent developments and challenges ahead in the chipless RFID field. With the popu­
larity of RFID applications, the demand for chipless RFID tags has been growing 
exponentially [4, 6]. The demand will further accelerate research and development 
on chipless RFID technology. These endeavors will lead to successful mass com­
mercialization of chipless RFID tags. This book features:
1.	 A single comprehensive and most recent source of the chipless RFID tech­
nologies applied to low-cost, item-level tagging for large-scale deployment 
to replace or coexist with the trillions of optical barcodes printed each year

1.3.1  Operating Principle of Chipless RFID Systems
These chapters include two very high quality chapters on the review of chipless 
RFID tags and reader systems. The most recent developments of the various types 
of chipless RFID tags and readers and their operating principles are presented in 
Chapter 2. Chapter 3 presents the most recent developments for various chipless 
RFID tag reader systems that can read these chipless RFID tags. Specifics are given 
next.
Chapter 2: Chipless RFID System Operating Principles
This chapter presents an overview of the operating principles of chipless RFID 
systems. The contents are focused on the different techniques used to encode data 
on a tag that does not have a microchip. A comprehensive review of chipless RFID 
tags is presented followed by a brief description of different reading methods used 
in chipless RFID tag readers. The objective of this chapter is to provide the basic 
operating principles of chipless RFID systems so the reader can understand the rest 
of the chapters of the book.
Chapter 3: Chipless RFID Readers
Chapter 3 provides a comprehensive review of various chipless RFID readers and 
their operating principles. Because the readers used for reading conventional tags 
cannot read chipless tags for various reasons, totally new and dedicated readers 
need to be developed for the interrogation of chipless tags. The chapter mainly pro­
vides the fundamental operating principles of chipless RFID readers developed for 
different kinds of chipless tags as discussed in Chapter 2. Many theories that are the 
bases for the new tag reading processes are highlighted. This chapter provides the 
foundation information for planning and integration of the components developed 
in the following chapters.

Introduction 
1.3.2  Reader Architecture for Chipless RFID Systems
In these chapters, the reader architectures of the fundamental reading principles 
are discussed: frequency domain (or also called frequency signature) based chipless 
RFID readers. time domain (TD) based chipless RFID readers. and, finally, the hy­
brid or combined time and frequency domain based chipless RFID tag readers. All 
three categories of chipless RFID tag readers are under development or in their in­
ception phases. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, besides the authors’ research 
group, no new information is publicly available in the field. Therefore, this section 
presents some niche ideas and principles to interrogate and decode the information 
data bits for the various types of chipless RFID tags.  The chapters are as follows: 
Chapter 4: Frequency Domain Based RFID Reader
Multiresonator based chipless RFID tags have the potential to achieving very low 
cost tags. A frequency signature is used to encode data in multiresonator based chi­
pless tags. Therefore, the reading process requires characterization of the tag in the 
frequency domain. This chapter provides detailed information for two chipless tag 
readers. The two readers operate based on two different concepts. First, a detailed 
description of the theoretical framework used in the reading process is explained, 
then the design details of the two readers are presented. 
Frequency signature based chipless tags are required to operate over a very 
wide frequency band for multibit data capacity. The frequency domain based read­
ers presented in this chapter use a linear frequency sweep (linear chirp) to interro­
gate the chipless tags. A microcontroller delivers the tuning voltage, which in turn 
generates the swept frequency in a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). The VCO 
needs some settle-in time to generate linear sweep. Therefore, this technique re­
quires a considerable amount of time (a few hundred milliseconds to a few seconds) 
to read multibit data capacity chipless tags. The reading time of this reader depends 
on the frequency band of operation, the number of data bits, and the performance 
of the VCO to interrogate and decode the data bits. High-performance VCOs have 
low settle-in times, which results in high-speed reading. This problem is overcome 
by the time domain based chipless RFID tag reader as described in the next chapter. 
Chapter 5: Time Domain Based Chipless RFID Reader 
Frequency signature based chipless tags need to operate in very wide frequency 
bands, as discussed in Chapters 2 and 3. The frequency domain based readers pre­
sented in Chapter 4 use a linear frequency sweep (linear chirp) to interrogate the 
chipless tags. To reduce the reading time, the concepts used in time domain ultra-
wideband (UWB) communication technology can be applied in the fast reading 
process of chipless RFID tags. The UWB impulse radio based reader illuminates the 
frequency signature based chipless tags with its RF impulse energy. The data decod­
ing process is accomplished by applying the Fourier transform for the retransmitted 
signal from the tag to extract the encoded data in frequency domain. This chapter 
provides the fundamental theory for a time domain based chipless RFID reader 
design using the UWB impulse radio principle followed by the reader architecture 
and simulated results of the reader design.

Chapter 6: Hybrid Chipless RFID Reader
Both frequency and time domain based tags have data encoding capacity limita­
tions. To enhance the capacity, a multiplexing technique with a combination of time 
and frequency domains is used to read the tag in the frequency domain in multiple 
time slots similar to the time domain multiplexing technique (TDMA). This chapter 
presents some recent progresses in chipless RFID tag reading techniques. Both time 
and frequency domain encoding improves the data bit capacity, detection, and ac­
curate estimation of information.
1.3.3  Physical Layer Development of Chipless RFID Tag Readers
For any enabling technology, the physical layer is the heart of the system. Software 
protocols, middleware, and digital interfaces all augment the hardware develop­
ment and improve the efficacy of the hardware’s performance. For chipless RFID 
systems there is no exception. Efficiently designed hardware improves the signal 
quality, speed, and accuracy of operation. This also reduces the load on other parts 
of the systems. Figure1.1 earlier in this chapter shows the physical layer of a generic 
RFID system. As can be seen the physical layer occupies the most significant part 
of the total system. For chipless RFID the exception is in the removal of the ASIC 
chip from the tag. Otherwise the rest of the system contains generic components 
and subsystems such as tag and reader antennas, hardware, and middleware for the 
reader. 
This book elegantly covers the physical layer development with comprehensive 
design details of system components, integration of the components in operational 
subsystems, and evaluation of these subsystems into integrated reader architecture. 
The salient components of a reader architecture are reader antennas, microwave 
and millimeter-wave passive designs such as passive lowpass, bandstop and band­
pass filters, power dividers, couplers, resonators, and microwave and millimeter-
wave active devices such as VCOs, power amplifiers (PAs), low-noise amplifiers 
(LNAs), impulse generators, and switches. These passive designs and active devices 
cover the RF transceiver development of the chipless RFID reader.
The second part of the physical layer design is the digital section and their in­
terfaces with the RF transceiver and middleware. The efficient design of all compo­
nents and systematic evaluations of all sections can ensure the working prototype 
of a mixed signal system engineered chipless RFID tag reader. Three very high 
quality and technically comprehensive chapters cover every detail of the design and 
development of the components and subsystems of the various types of the chipless 
RFID tag readers as stated in the preceding section.
Chapter 7: Antennas for Chipless RFID Readers
The three main types of chipless RFID systems—frequency, time, and hybrid do­
mains—cover the UWB spectrum in both microwave frequency bands from 3 to 
11 GHz and millimeter-wave frequency bands from 20 to 30 GHz, and, finally, 
around 60 GHz. To address the diverse requirements of such large operational 
bandwidth and operating frequency ranges, many types of reader antennas have 
been designed, fabricated, and evaluated. The antenna types vary from a simple

Introduction 
disk-loaded ground reflector assisted printed monopole in both microstrip line 
and coplanar waveguide topologies to a broadband printed dipole array antenna 
and a broadband microstrip line fed aperture coupled patch array antenna. These 
comprehensive designs of antennas generated a huge depository of knowledge in 
both microwave and millimeter-wave frequency bands. These antennas are not only 
UWB but also of high gain. Therefore, the developments are significant in the field 
of antenna design. This chapter presents the design and fabrication of microwave 
and millimeter-wave band UWB antennas and their evaluation as used in their in­
tended RFID tag reader systems. 
Chapter 8: Microwave and Millimeter-Wave Active and Passive Components
While antennas are the eyes of the system that communicate with the outer world 
wirelessly, the microwave and millimeter-wave passive and active components are 
the hearts of chipless RFID tag reader systems. This chapter formulates the specifi­
cations for various passive and active components for the reader systems followed 
by the fundamental theories and design details of these components. The passive de­
signs such as microwave and millimeter-wave power dividers, resonators, and filters 
are designed and developed from scratch and then fabricated and measured with 
high-precision microwave and millimeter-wave measuring equipment. The pieces of 
equipment were the Agilent Performance Vector Network Analyzer PNA E8361A, 
Agilent Performance Spectrum Analyzer E4408A, and Tektronix high sampling rate 
(up to 20 GHz) digital storage oscilloscopes TDS6604. 
The active devices were incorporated into design circuits to evaluate their spe­
cific functionalities and then integrated in a system. Moreover, these components 
are used for both chipless tags and RFID readers. Passive components are used for 
chipless tags and the reader’s RF front-end design; the active components are used 
in the receiver and transmitter sections of the reader’s RF front-end. Therefore, 
the whole chapter presents a comprehensive body of knowledge in the field and 
offers excellent guidelines for the designers of active and passive microwave and 
millimeter-wave components and systems.
Chapter 9: Digital Module for Chipless RFID Readers
Because RFID systems use a mixed signal enabling technology, they deal with sig­
nals of various types such as microwave and millimeter-wave RF carrier signals, 
down-converted information carrying baseband signals and digital signals. The 
readers also process the signals for modulations and demodulations and encoding 
and decoding purposes. Therefore, all RFID readers consist of three major sections: 
antennas, RF transceiver, and digital control sections. The first two were covered in 
the two preceding chapters. Each of the three different types of chipless RFID read­
ers (frequency, time, and hybrid domains) has a different RF and digital section for 
controlling its operations. This chapter provides information on the requirements 
of digital interfaces for chipless RFID readers. This chapter also provides two digi­
tal interfaces that are based on microcontroller and field programmable gate arrays 
(FPGAs).

Chapter 10: RFID Reader System Integration and Applications
This chapter presents the integration of the UWB antennas, RF reader front-ends, 
and digital sections in the formation of a complete chipless RFID system. Finally, 
the chapter includes field trials and case studies of the various integrated reader 
systems. The implementation challenges of these developed readers in commercial 
domains and essential tasks for efficient detection, multiple access, and signal integ­
rity to improve the efficacy of the developed readers will also be addressed. These 
topics are covered in a companion book, Chipless RFID Reader Signal Processing.   
1.4  Conclusion
RFID is an emerging technology for automatic identification, tracking, and tracing 
of goods, animals, and personnel. In recent decades, the exponential growth of the 
RFID market has signified its potential in numerous applications. The advanta­
geous features and operational flexibility of RFID have attracted many innovative 
application areas. Therefore, there is a need for tremendous development and open 
literature on RFID to report new results. However, the main constraints to mass 
deployment of RFID technology are the cost of the tag and the reading techniques 
and processes of the chipless tag. This is the first book in the field that covers 
comprehensively many significant aspects of chipless RFID reader architecture and 
signal processing. 
This book project is an initiative to publish the most recent results of research 
and development on the chipless RFID tag reader system. It aims to serve the needs 
for a broad spectrum of readers. It starts with a comprehensive review of various 
chipless RFID tag technologies developed so far, and various reading methods in 
three main domains: time, frequency, and hybrid. A full section is dedicated to the 
component-level design and physical layer development of chipless RFID tag read­
ers, their system-level integration, and field trials.  It also covers the system aspects 
of the chipless tag readers, system architectures, detection techniques, multiaccess 
protocols, and signal integrity. The book has proposed a few novel detection tech­
niques dedicated to radar array based chipless RFID tags [12, 13]. First, signal 
space representation based chipless RFID tag detection is used for the frequency 
signature based chipless tags. Second, a UWB impulse radio detection technique is 
used to interrogate a frequency signature based chipless tag. Third, a singularity 
expansion method is used to separate poles and residues of the tag responses, and, 
finally, various filtering techniques such as wavelet transformation and the prolate 
spheroidal wave function are used for noise filtering. All of these detection, denois­
ing, and filtering techniques improve the efficiency of the reader. 
The book has also proposed a few state-of-the-art multiaccess and signal in­
tegrity protocols to improve the efficacy of the system in multiple tag reading sce­
narios. Comprehensive studies of anticollision protocols for chipless RFID systems 
and various revolutionary techniques to improve their signal integrity have also 
been presented. It has also identified future challenges in the sphere. 
Finally, an industry approach to integration of the various systems of the chi­
pless RFID reader technology is given: integration of physical layers, middleware, 
and enterprise software are the main features of the book. Overall, the book has

Chipless RFID System Operating 
Principles
2.1  Chipless RFID Tags
Much effort has been expended by researches all over the world to reduce the cost 
of RFID tags. Because the tag antenna and application-specific integrated circuit 
(ASIC) assembly result in a costly manufacturing process, it is still not possible to 
achieve RFID tags at a cost of less than 1 cent (or sub-cent) each. To address the 
challenge of reducing the cost of an RFID tag, numerous efforts have been made to 
encode data on a tag without an ASIC. Those tags have been named chipless RFID 
tags. The generic term chipless RFID covers all types of passive transponders that 
have no on-board ASIC or “chip.” 
Most chipless RFID tags use the electromagnetic properties of materials and 
various circuit layouts to achieve a specific electromagnetic behavior (or property). 
The identification or extraction of data from chipless tags is done by analyzing the 
reflected signal from the tag. This technique is similar to the operation of some 
types of chipped RFID tags [1]. Although some chipless RFID tag developments 
have been reported on in recent years, most of them are still reported as prototypes. 
Only a handful are considered to be commercially available or viable. The tag ID 
is incorporated within the structure of the tag. Such tags can be divided into differ­
ent categories. The main focus of this chapter is to review the techniques used to 
encode data in different types of chipless tags and their reading processes. A broad 
classification is presented in Figure 2.1. 
With the maturity of technology, thin-film transistor circuit (TFTC) tags will 
cover a large market segment of the chipless RFID tags in the near future. These 
tags use the HF (13.65-MHz) band, have a high data capacity, and are compatible 
with the existing time domain RFID standards. However, the cost of TFTC chipless 
tags will be an issue. Once fully printable passive microwave and millimeter-wave 
chipless tags, namely, radar arrays, are fully developed and can be printed in the 
sub-cent cost rage, the radar arrays will dominate the chipless RFID market. The 
author presented a comprehensive review on chipless and chipped tags in his previ­
ous book1. Therefore, this review focuses only on radar array based chipless tags.

Chipless RFID System Operating Principles
The following section presents information about different chipless RFID tags 
based on three categories (see also Figure 2.1): 
1.	 Time domain TDR based chipless RFID tags
2.	 Frequency domain (spectral signature) based chipless RFID tags
3.	 Hybrid domain based chipless tags.
2.1.1  Time Domain (TD) Based Chipless RFID Tags
TD based tags are interrogated by sending a short pulse and observing the received 
trains of pulses reflected from the structure that is designed to reflect incoming 
pulses. Data are encoded in the time domain based on the delay in arrival of the 
transmitted pulse at different times. There are printable and nonprintable TD based 
chipless RFID tags. An example of a nonprintable chipless RFID tag is the surface 
acoustic wave (SAW) tag [2]. These are excited with a chirp of RF pulse centered 
around 2.4 GHz. SAW tags are the most common type of commercially available 
chipless RFID tag [3]. Most of the printable TD based tags are still in the experi­
mental stage [1, 3]. Various types of time domain based tags are described next.
2.1.1.1  SAW Chipless RFID Tags
The SAW based tag is one of the few commercially available chipless RFID tags. To 
date a few hundred thousand SAW tags are commercially sold each year. The sales 
are exponentially growing and in 2019 approximately 200 million SAW tags will 
be sold according to the IDTechEx predictions [4]. Their market includes electronic

toll collection and defense and space applications. Data are encoded using time 
delays in the reflected pulses, which can be termed time position encoding or pulse 
position modulation (PPM) [4]. An interrogation pulse is sent from the reader an­
tenna to the tag. The tag receives the pulse signal with its omnidirectional antenna 
and guides it to an interdigital transducer (IDT). The IDT is made of two interlaced 
comb-like metal structures deposited on the microacoustics piezoelectric substrate 
(LiNO3, etc.). It converts the guided electromagnetic wave into a surface wave 
(mechanical wave), which propagates slowly (100,000 times slower than the speed 
of light in free space [5]) over the piezoelectric surface of the tag. Then the surface 
wave encounters a series of bandstop filters made of aluminum strips and reflected 
back toward the IDT, which carries a code based on the positions of the reflectors. 
The reflected SAW pulses are then reconverted to electrical form again by the IDT 
and retransmitted to the reader by the tag antenna. Currently, however, the pulse 
signal is rarely used in practical reader systems for SAW tags. The principle of 
operation of a SAW tag is shown in Figure 2.2(a). In real reader systems a simple 
frequency domain reading method is used, in which the reflected signal (S11) of 
the tag is measured at a particular frequency and then Fourier transformed to the 
time domain. This technique lowers the cost of the reader. The SAW tag has some 
advantages over chipped RFID tags. It can be used as a temperature sensor because 
its piezoelectric crystal has a predictable change in its properties with change in 
temperature [6]. It can be detected at a distance of few meters using 2 to 3 orders

Chipless RFID System Operating Principles
of lower power (10 mW [5]) than the chipped RFID tags. SAW tags also work on 
metal surfaces and have a higher resistance to interference. This tag works more 
reliably in harsh environments than do chipped tags. Moreover, multiple SAW tags 
can also be identified, as is true of multiple chipped tags, by applying a multiple 
access spread spectrum signaling scheme [7, 8].
To increase the data capacity, some other techniques are now added to the IDT 
based SAW tags. Many of them added advantages to the current system—along 
with a few disadvantages too. One technique uses multiple IDT [9] to increase the 
number of bits. But it generates a spurious signal, which causes code confusion. 
Another one is reflector based X-Cyte tags [10], which use 16 reflectors distributed 
in four acoustic tracks. This reduces the tag size but increase the losses inside the 
tag where the tag cannot be tested before the final stage. An Epcos tag [4] uses 
two tracks on the same side of the IDT. Here bits are changed by removing the 
tracks completely. But it makes the reflected signal dependent on the encoded bits. 
Siemens developed a 31-bit tag operating in the 2.45-GHz ISM band [10]. It uses 
33 equidistantly placed reflectors. But it suffered from relatively high insertion loss 
(attenuation) of the symbols due to the many reflections required for its amplitude 
shift keying (ASK) coding scheme. The BaumerIdent tag developed by TAGIX uses 
split-finger IDT with five open circuit λ/2 reflectors [6]. But the data capacity of 
this tag is very low. 
Hartman et al. [10] proposed a global SAW tag using a time position coding 
scheme. Here the phase increment in a given group of slots of the total slot array 
is used as a code. A 128-bit measurement result was also shown. Orthogonal fre­
quency coding [11] and SAW resonators with slightly different frequencies are also 
proposed to generate IDs for the SAW tags. At first glance, it seems that the SAW 
tags are fully functional and could replace the chipped tag easily. However, the 
main drawbacks of this SAW based tag are its costly piezoelectric substrate and its 
IDT and reflectors, which need to be deposited slowly by submicron photolitho­
graphic tools. These lithographic tools make the initial fixed cost for SAW tags very 
high. Another drawback is the incompatibility in terms of printing the tag directly 
on substrates such as banknotes, postage stamps, security documents, and plastic 
packets.
2.1.1.2  Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) Based Tag
The second type of TD based tag is the TDR chipless tag. Here the transmitted 
signal through a transmission line is interrupted in a cascade of short circuit dis­
continuities along the line. The returned echoes are time sampled and the delays are 
recorded as stream of data bits as 1’s and 0’s in time. A fully printable tag has been 
presented in [12, 13] where the time domain reflectometry (TDR) method is used 
for encoding data. Here the reader transmits a train of short time pulses modulated 
at high frequencies. These pulses are received by the tag antenna and then travel 
through the attached long meandering transmission line. Impedance discontinuities 
are put at an interval determined by the pulse width in the transmission line to en­
code the logic 1 and removed the encoded logic 0. The pulse is reflected back to the 
reader at different times according to the position of the impedance mismatches. If 
an impedance mismatch is removed from one point, then there will be no reflection 
from that point, which makes that bit zero. The total length of the transmission line 

2.1  Chipless RFID Tags 
19
is determined by the number of bits, which is equal to the number of discontinuities 
and the equivalent of the physical length of the pulse width of the interrogation sig­
nal. For a typical 4-bit tag with 2-ns interrogation pulse, an approximately 54-cm 
transmission line is required [see Figure 2.2(b)]. This long transmission line makes 
the tag very large and unsuitable for commercial use. A few techniques to overcome 
the size issue are proposed in [14] and [15]. 
A 2.45-GHz TDR based fully printable tag has been developed by the authors’ 
research group (Figure 2.3). Four stubs are placed at regular intervals. A disk-load­
ed UWB monopole antenna with modified ground plane [Figure 2.3 (b)] is added to 
the delay line [Figure 2.3(a)]. The complete tag and reader system is shown in Fig­
ure 2.3(c). Here another monopole is used as a reader antenna. The time domain 
response is shown in Figure 2.3(d). 
Stelzer et al. [15] proposed a delay line using left-handed (LH) negative refrac­
tive index (NRI) transmission line sections. The lines are described as LH, since the 
sum of the electric and magnetic fields associated with a Poynting vector follow 
a “left-hand” rule, rather than the traditional “right-hand” (RH) rule of classi­
cal EM theory. Although this line allows the delay lines to be shorter, they exhibit 
significant distortion, which limits the number of usable bits for the system. It is 
possible that a usable transponder may come from this method, but it will still take 
a significant amount of research to produce a viable design.

response of a 4-bit(1010) tag as shown in part (c) [16].

�����������������������������������������
Chipless RFID System Operating Principles
Another printed passive RFID tag on the paper substrate with high data rate is 
proposed by Shao et al. [12]. They used a UWB antenna and a tapered microstrip 
transmission line loaded with distributed shunt capacitance as the information cod­
ing element. A tapered microstrip line is used to overcome the limitations of low 
ink conductivity and thin-film thickness of the printed metal lines. The silver ink 
used for printing the tag has conductivity of 1 × 107 S/m and a thickness of 0.5 µm, 
which is much less than those of copper (conductivity 5.8 × 107 S/m and thickness 
of 17 µm). From measurement results it is seen that the tag features a robust read­
ability with a greater than 80-cm reading distance. But the data density is very low 
for this tag. Only 8 bits are encoded using eight different shunt capacitors and bits 
are changed from logic 1 to 0 by removing the connections between the microstrip 
line and shunt capacitors. The tag size will increase linearly with the increment in 
the number of bits and it also needs a ground plane, which will increase the cost 
of printing.
2.1.2  Frequency Domain Based Tags
Data are encoded in the frequency spectrum received from the tag. Different types 
are discussed next.
2.1.2.1  Chemical Tags 
Chemical tags are mainly made from the deposition of nanometric resonating fi­
bers and electronic ink on a substrate [3]. These materials resonate at different 
frequencies and create a distinct frequency signature in the backscattered signal 
to the reader. These tags are cheaper than chipped ones and have the advantage of 
being able to be printed on plastic items. Seventy different chemicals are claimed to 
be used by the CrossID company to create 70 frequency signatures for a 70-bit tag 
[17]. This CrossID system can work with existing barcode systems. The Tapemark 
company proposed another tag, which consists of an antenna made of very small fi­
bers (as small as 5 µm in diameter and 1 mm in length) [18]. The antennas are made 
spatially unique by changing the combinations of the fibers and read by a reader 
using the radar technique. These low-cost tags can work on paper and plastic pack­
aging materials. Though this tag is printable, it requires very high accuracy, which 
keeps its cost at more than 5 cents each. Moreover, no further reporting about the 
tag development after the first reports in 2004 from these two companies infer that 
their claims of data capacity and reliable tag operation are still in the research stage.
2.1.2.2  Space-Filling Curves 
RFID tags that use space-filling curves have been proposed by McVay et al. [6]. 
Peano and Hilbert curves are used to generate different resonant structures to reso­
nate in a frequency band centered around 900 MHz. The Hilbert and Peano curves 
are used due to their spatial efficiency over half-wave dipoles at the same frequency. 
A 5-bit tag is made using five Hilbert/Peano curves and in a backscattered radar 
cross-section (RCS) measurement result five picks are present that represent the 5 
bits. The drawback of this tag is that removal of one curve is required to change 
that bit, which affects the radiation pattern of the other bits. Also, the size of the 

2.1  Chipless RFID Tags 
21
tag will increase with the number of bits because bits have a 1-to-1 correspondence 
with the number of space-filling curves.
2.1.2.3  Dipole Array Based Chipless Tags 
Jalaly and Robertson [19] present an RF barcode that uses arrays of capacitively 
tuned identical microstrip dipoles. The dipoles resonate at different frequencies 
within the ISM bands based on the gap capacitance. When the tag is hit by a fre­
quency swept signal from the reader, each dipole absorbs their resonant frequen­
cies. The tagged item ID is determined from the presence or absence of the resonant 
frequencies. Measured results for an 11-bit prototype are presented using 11 dipole 
elements in the 5.8-GHz band [Figure 2.4(a)]. A further increase in the number of 
bits is possible using the UWB band. But to encode each extra bit, this tag needs an 
extra dipole. That means the size of the tag will increase linearly with the increment 
in the number of bits and it will be unusable where higher number of bits are re­
quired. Moreover, the resonant dipoles have a linearly polarized directional far-field 
radiation pattern, which also limits its practicality.
Another novel approach is proposed in [19] to achieve a RF barcode [Figure 
2.4 (b)] that consists of three sets of half-wave resonant dipole–like structures that 
resonate at three bands (2.4, 5.25, and 5.8 GHz). The width of the dipole array of 
each band is then varied to increase the number of bits. The tagged item ID is de­
termined by the presence or absence of the resonant frequencies. Measured results 
of a 5-bit prototype at 5.8 GHz are shown to prove the concept. The number of 
encoded bits is determined by the Q factor of each dipole. But the Q factor or the 
bandwidth mainly depends on the conduction loss and the radiation loss. Surface 
wave and dielectric loss are almost negligible. Q factors on the order of 100 can be 
achieved on Taconic TLY-5 substrate. But with this high Q factor only 4 to 5 bits 
can be coded in a single ISM band. Moreover, to increase the number of bits using 
the UWB band we need many dipoles. This will increase the size of the tag.
Deepu et al. [20] proposed a theoretical concept for a 9-bit RFID tag within a 
credit card size area using three diploe antennas [Figure 2.4(c)]. The single-sided 
tag was printed on a 0.8-mm-thick FR4 sheet with 3-mm-wide dipoles with lengths 
of 23.5, 16.8, and 11 mm and the dipoles were placed 9 mm apart. Three dipoles 
give resonances at three different frequencies according to their lengths (L1, L2, 
and L3). Later lengths of the dipoles are varied by a small amount (ΔL) to shift 
their resonant frequencies to encode a larger number of bits. These shifts need to 
be measured reliably and accurately to decode the encoded information in the tag. 
The maximum number of bits that can be encoded by varying the dipoles’ lengths 
are determined by the minimum frequency resolution of the reader. But the fre­
quency resolution in bistatic antenna measurements will be much higher than the 
frequency resolution shown in the paper by metallic cavity measurements. There­
fore, in the practical field we cannot achieve 23 bits within a credit card size area 
using this technique.
An RFID tag that uses a slot-loaded planar elliptical dipole is presented in [21]. 
In this type of arrangement, notches are created in the backscattered frequency 
signature by adding slots inside the dipole. But the tag is detected by looking at 
the poles and residues because poles are unique and independent of excitation and

observation point. But the slots do not behave independently for this tag, which is 
seen in the change of pole location.

A chipless RFID tag with a very low data capacity that uses magnetically coupled 
LC resonators is used for electronic article surveillance (EAS) [22]. It has a simple 
coil that resonates at a particular frequency. The operating principle is based on the 
magnetic coupling between the reader antenna and the LC resonant tag. The reader 
continuously transmits the resonant frequency of the tag. When the tag enters inside 
Figure 2.4   (a) Capacitively tuned dipoles, (b) multiband dipole based RF barcode, and (c) RF bar­
code for secured application [33].

23
the sweeping range, it will resonate and absorb power at the resonant frequency, 
which will produce a voltage dip across the reader’s antenna ports. The interroga­
tion frequency is swept across a band of frequencies to detect the multiple coils of a 
multibit transponder. The advantage of this tag is that it is a very cheap and simple 
solution. Therefore, it is mainly used for security purposes to check for the absence 
or presence of a tagged item. But due to its very limited data capacity and multiple 
tag collision issues, it is currently losing its market day by day.
2.1.2.5  SRR Based Chipless Tags
Hyeong-Seok et al. [23] proposed a 4-bit printable chipless tag that uses split-ring 
resonators (SRRs) [Figure 2.5(a)]. The electromagnetic code is encoded using the 
frequency selective behavior of the SRR array. A different combination of SRR ar­
rays generates different bit patterns. The combinations are changed by changing 
the resonant frequencies of SRRs by changing gap directions (Lgap) and the differ­
ent parameters of the SRRs (W, H, WPatterns, DSRRs). The tag can be printed on 
one side of paper or plastic based items, but we need multiple sets of SRR arrays 
to increase the number of bits. We also need multiple waveguides to measure the 
multiple SRR arrays. Alignment between them should be strictly maintained. 
2.1.2.6   Coplanar Strip Based Chipless Tags
Another novel compact (15-mm × 20-mm) printable chipless RFID tag was recently 
discussed by Vena et al. [24]. It uses quarter-wavelength coplanar strips [Figure 
2.5(b)]. The proposed single-sided 10-bit tag has a higher data density (3.3 bits/
cm2) than other techniques. It uses four strip resonators. Among them, the fre­
quency of three resonators (1, 2, 4) can be varied independently. To encode data, 
the length of three of these strip resonators was varied, which shifts the resonant 
frequency around a reference frequency. Strip lengths are changed by adding some 
short circuits (L1, L2, and L4) in the slots to get better results. Both time domain 
and frequency domain measurements were done to demonstrate the robustness of 
the designed tag. However, the maximum data encoding capacity of this design 
totally depends on the frequency resolution of the reader and no further data capac­
ity improvement technique is mentioned there. So it cannot be used where a data 
capacity of more than 10 bits is required. 
2.1.2.7  RFID of Letters
A frequency signature based method for RF identification of letters has been pre­
sented by Singh et al. [25], where RF is used for identifying 24-mm-long letters in 
the Arial font. When a metallic printed letter is being hit by an electromagnetic 
wave, then free electrons produce a surface current. Due to their different struc­
tures, different letters have different surface current paths and different radiation 
characteristics are seen in the backscattered frequency signatures. But some of their 
resonances are very close to each other. The authors proposed to measure those 
letters in both horizontal and vertical polarities to differentiate them. The main 
limitation of this technique is that only one letter can be identified at a time and we 
cannot use multiple letters together as a chipless RFID tag to identify many items.

2.1.2.8  Spiral Resonator Based Chipless Tags
The authors’ research group developed three types of frequency signature based 
chipless RFID tags and different types of RFID readers for their designed chi­
pless tags [26–38]. The initial designed tag [Figure 2.6(a)] was made by using two 
Figure 2.5  (a) SRR array based tag [37], (b) strip line based tag [38], and (c) letter ID based tag 
[39].

2.1  Chipless RFID Tags

orthogonally polarized wideband monopole antennas and a series of spiral resona­
tors. These resonators are gap coupled to a microstrip transmission line, which 
connects the orthogonally polarized monopoles [27]. The reader and the tag anten­
nas are cross-polarized to provide isolation between the transmitting and receiving 
Figure 2.6  (a) Spiral resonator based tag [40], (b) MRDA loaded tag [52], and (c) fractal loaded 
tag [53].

signals. The RFID reader sends a UWB signal to the chipless RFID transponder 
[34]. The wideband receiving monopole antenna of the tag receives the signal and it 
passes through the microstrip transmission line. The gap-coupled spiral resonators 
create magnitude attenuations and phase jumps at their resonant frequencies in the 
UWB signal received and this magnitude and phase coded signal is retransmitted 
back to the reader by the tag’s transmitting monopole antenna. The attenuation in 
the backscattered signal due to a resonator is denoted as logic 0 and the absence of 
attenuation at that frequency is denoted as logic 1. The attenuation was removed 
by simply shorting one end of that resonator, which shifts the resonant frequency 
outside of the desired UWB band. A 6-bit and a 35-bit prototype tag are shown in 
[27] and [30]. But these first-generation tags are double sided and made on Taconic 
TLX-0; hence, they are not fully printable. Later second-generation single-sided 
fully printable tags are proposed in [32]. But all of these proposed tags were not 
rotation independent. Later a rotation-independent tag using a single monopole 
antenna and multiple spiral DGSs coupled to a microstrip line was researched [33]. 
A temperature sensing feature can also be added to this design [31] (but it becomes 
double layered again). Moreover, all of the proposed tags have a 1-to-1 correspon­
dence between each spiral resonator and each bit. So the size will be much higher 
for tags with a higher number of bits. Besides, the performance of the tags is also 
very much dependent on the printing accuracy of the complex spiral structures and 
small coupling gap between the CPW line and resonators. The operating principle 
of spiral resonator based chipless RFID tags is explained in detail in Section 2.2.
2.1.2.9  MRDA Based Chipless Tags
Balbin and Karmakar [39] proposed a new design using the concept presented in 
[29]. They used a linearly polarized UWB circular receiving monopole antenna 
coupled to an orthogonally polarized novel dual multiresonant dipole antenna 
(MRDA). The dual multiresonant loop antenna creates a frequency signature in the 
orthogonal polarization of the interrogation signal. They verified their proposed 
concept with a 6-bit double-layer prototype using two sets of MRDAs each having 
six dipoles [Figure 2.6(b)]. This design has advantages over the design proposed 
in [29] because only MRDAs are used instead of the stopband spiral resonators 
and the second antenna used in [29]. Here the MRDAs operate as set of parallel 
loop antennas. The size of the tag can be reduced because its total tag area is deter­
mined by the outer loop element. Higher frequency elements were placed inside the 
outer loop, which significantly improves the spatial efficiency over the tag in [29]. 
However, each bit is encoded here by adding an additional dipole to the circuit. 
Therefore, the size of the tag increases linearly with the number of bits and it also 
requires printing alignment on both sides, making the printing process much more 
sophisticated.
2.1.2.10  Fractal Based Chipless Tags
Another novel transponder concept using fractal multiband loading element was 
proposed in [39]. Data are encoded in the backscattered frequency spectrum re­
ceived from the tag. When a wideband monopole antenna is loaded with the fractal 
structure [Figure 2.6(c)], its resonant peaks detectable in the backscattered power 

2.1  Chipless RFID Tags

spectrum correspond to a set of resonant frequencies that can be directly mapped 
to the generating parameters of the fractal. If multiple fractal resonators are added 
through a power divider to a monopole antenna, then the number of resonant 
picks will increase, which will increase the number of bits. Although the number 
of combinations is large, it will be limited by the fabrication process and materials 
of the transponder. Moreover, the design is very large and it requires very precise 
double-sided fabrication and a large amount of conductive ink due to the large 
ground plane of the tag.
2.1.2.11  Slot-loaded Monopole Based Chipless Tags
A chipless RFID tag with a high data capacity that uses two orthogonally polarized 
slot-loaded UWB monopole antennas has been researched [40]. Data are encoded 
by the frequency notches produced by the open-ended slot resonators in the retrans­
mitted frequency signature. When the tag receiver monopole antenna is hit with a 
UWB signal from the reader transmitting antenna, frequency notches are generated 
at the resonant frequencies of the slots inside it. This frequency notched signal then 
travels through a real frequency transfer (RFT) matching section to an orthogonally 
polarized transmitting antenna. This signal is again frequency notched by the slots 
presents at the transmitting monopole at different frequencies and retransmitted 
back to the reader receiver antenna. Because the slots are cut inside the monopoles, 
the size of the tag is more compact than the tag with a similar concept proposed in 
[28]. 
2.1.2.12  Stub-Loaded Patch Based Chipless Tag
A chipless RFID tag that uses an encoding technique in the backscattered phase 
has been discussed by Balbin and Karmakar [41, 42]. Their proposed transpon­
der included open circuit high-impedance stub-loaded patch antennas. The patch 
antennas are resonant at nearby frequencies. When the patch antennas are hit by 
their corresponding resonant frequencies, they reradiate the signal in cross polar­
ity with distinct phase characteristics. This cross-polarized backscattered phase at 
the resonant frequency of each patch can be controlled by changing the stub im­
pedance, which can be changed by changing its length. Thus data are encoded as 
hexadecimal bits in the backscattered phase of the patch. The cross polarized phase 
measured by the phase difference between backscattered E-plane and H-plane sig­
nals in the reader antenna. Because it is a polarization-dependent technique, the 
misalignment between the tag and the reader may decrease the phase resolution. 
Moreover, data are encoded only in the phase domain at a particular frequency and 
the backscattering from other patches at that frequency may cause undesired non­
resonant structural scattering. If the backscattered phase is varied due to multipath, 
then it might cause a bit encoding error as well [43].
2.1.2.13  Stacked Multilayer Patch Based Chipless Tags 
A chipless RFID tag that uses stacked multilayer patches was proposed by Mukher­
jee [44]. Three stacked rectangular patches are used as a scattering element for 
the prototype tag. When the upper patch resonates, the middle patch acts as a 

28 
�����������������������������������������
Chipless RFID System Operating Principles
ground plane. Similarly, when the middle patch resonates, the bottom patch acts 
as a ground plane. As a result two dips are seen in the backscattered magnitude 
when it is hit by a frequency swept signal. But the structural scattering tends to 
maintain the RCS relatively constant over the frequency band. So the dips become 
very small at higher distances. However, the phase (and therefore delay) undergoes 
significant changes at resonances and is more robust than the magnitude signal at 
higher distances. This time-delay (phase) measurement along with a soft comput­
ing technique [45] made the tag robust in the reading range, but its data capacity is 
very low. Moreover, it has multiple layers. Hence, it cannot be printed roll to roll 
for item-level tagging. 
2.1.2.14  Remote Measurement of Complex Impedance
This technique was used to implement a chipless RFID by Mukherjee and 
Chakraborty [43]. The proposed tag does not require a semiconductor element 
and can be printed directly on a low-cost dielectric substrate. A narrowband chirp 
signal is used to illuminate multiple tags and the combined response is received by 
the reader antenna. The received signal is then mixed with the transmitted chirp 
and filtered to create the intermediate frequency (IF) for detecting a particular tag. 
A reference channel is used to recover the phase-frequency profile for identifying 
the tag. The proposed detection method requires less power and is reluctant against 
multipath propagation and interference. But the tag used (L-C Ladder) for verifying 
the detection concept cannot be used commercially because of its larger size.
2.1.3  Image Based Tags
2.1.3.1  SAR Based Chipless Tags
Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) based chipless RFID is one of the recently proposed 
promising techniques. Referred to as a printed radar array by IDTechEx, three 
companies (InkSure, Nicanti, and Vubiq) reported up to 96-bit chipless tags. Ink­
Sure [46] proposed a new design for their SAR coded tag and a reader for their tag, 
which can read up to 25 cm in 240 ms of time. Here the radar technique is used 
for generating an image of the tag made of conductive ink. The operating principle 
is almost similar to the barcode reading process. It uses a multiantenna array to 
generate a very narrow millimeter-wave beam to detect multisymbol patterns and 
their intersymbol diffraction effects on the tag. Then the beam orientation and sen­
sitivity are precisely controlled to generate a map of radar cross section (RCS) from 
multiple observation points. A digitized image of the tag is created where the pres­
ence of conductive strips is mapped as 1’s and the absence of conductive strips is 
mapped as 0’s. To encode a higher number of bits in a small place and to get higher 
resolution, an ISM band of 60 GHz is used. Multiple types of inks are also used to 
improve the information resolution of the transponder. If slots in the metallic plane 
are used instead of metallic strips, then the tag will work on metallic bodies too. 
Though a printable tag with high data capacity was proposed long ago, it is not yet 
available commercially due to the very complex reader antenna and high process­
ing power requirement for the reader for the reliable detection of the tag. Nicanti 
reported on a resistive ink radar array based chipless tag (NiCode™) that can be 

2.1  Chipless RFID Tags

read from a few millimeters away [4]. The applications are brand protection and 
anticounterfeiting. Vubiq reported on a millimeter-wave chipless RFID label that 
can be read from a large distance [4].
2.1.3.2  Ink Tattoo Based Chipless Tags
An ink tattoo based chipless RFID tag can be directly printed on the surface of 
tagged items using electronic ink [47]. The reader interrogates the tag with a high-
frequency (>10-GHz) microwave signal and receives the reflected signal [48]. This 
reflected signal is different for different tags due to their unique pattern of ink depo­
sitions. The company Somark Innovations claimed the development of this kind of 
tag and a reader that can read the tag up to 1.2 m [49]. To tag animals, permanent 
ink can be deposited on the dermal layer to create the tag, which can then be used 
for the whole life span of the animal. The tags are claimed to be readable on metal 
surfaces as well. Though this tag is printable, its cost is still high and there is no fur­
ther reporting about the claims, which infers that the claims about tag data capacity 
and reading range are still in the experimental phase.
2.1.4  Hybrid Domain Chipless RFID Tags
In addition to the two main categories of chipless tags discussed above, it is pos­
sible to introduce another type of chipless RFID tag. A hybrid tag uses two or more 
features of frequency domain tags and of time domain tags to encode data on it. 
Therefore, these types of tags cannot be directly classified into either the frequency 
domain or time domain. Hence, in this book a new category is defined, the hybrid 
domain. The operation of a hybrid domain chipless RFID tag is described in Figure 
2.7. Figures 2.7(a) and (b) show the conventional method of encoding data in the 
Figure 2.7  Illustration of data encoding methods used in the chipless tags discussed.

30 
�����������������������������������������
Chipless RFID System Operating Principles
time domain and frequency domain, respectively. In time domain reflectometric 
tags, usually a short-duration RF pulse is used and echoes from the tag are captured 
in time. In frequency domain tags, the data are encoded using the spectral features 
and the data encoding does not depend on the time information. However, as il­
lustrated in Figure 2.7(c), phase-frequency domain based encoding of data uses two 
features from the frequency domain—phase and frequency—to encode data. On the 
other hand, time-phase domain based encoding uses phase and time information 
from a signal to represent data. A tag that uses frequency-time domain encoding of 
data is reported on in [50]. The tag contains two sets of resonators that resonate at 
the same frequency. The length of the transmission lines coupled to the spiral reso­
nators is different as shown in Figure 2.8. Therefore, the interrogation UWB pulse 
signal received from port 1 reaches the transmitting antennas connected to port 2 
and 3 at different times. By analyzing the two pulses received at two different times 
at the reader, the data can be decoded. More detailed descriptions of hybrid domain 
tags and their reader are presented in Chapter 6. 
2.1.5  Summary of the Review of Chipless RFID Tags 
Based on our review of the different types of chipless RFID tags, they can be divided 
into two main categories: time domain and frequency domain. Time domain tags 
use the time information of a RF signal such as time of arrival of a reflected RF sig­
nal or position of a pulse in a stream of RF pulses. Spectral signature based chipless 
tags encode data using resonant structures. Based on the technique used in each 
tag, either the amplitude or phase of an input RF signal is modified to encode data. 
In some types of tags, both amplitude and phase are modified to encode data. The 
new term hybrid domain was introduced to categorize the tags that use both time 
and spectral information to encode a larger amount of compressed data compared

to that of their predecessors, time domain and frequency domain tags. Table 2.1 
shows a comparison of the various chipless tags investigated in the open literature. 
The study reveals that chipless RFID tags may contain large data bits and small 
physical size as compared to conventional RFID tags. These promises with unique 
features will make the chipless RFID the frontier disruptive technology in the new 
millennium.
The next section presents a detailed description of the principle of operation 
of multiresonator based chipless RFID tags. Multiresonator based chipless RFID 
tags reported on in [29] can be implemented on low-grade flexible substrates such 
as paper or plastics. Further, the manufacturing of the tag can be done using con­
ductive inks and existing printing technologies such as ink-jet and screen printing. 
Therefore, this chipless RFID tag shows the potential to achieve much lower manu­
facturing costs compared to other chipped and chipless RFID tags [1, 3].

Chipless RFID System Operating Principles
1.	 Operating frequency;
2.	 Data encoding technique;
3.	 Communication protocol used to communicate with the tag.
In terms of operating frequency, other active and passive chipped tags mostly 
work on the LF, HF, UHF, and ISM frequency bands and in a very narrow band­
width [17]. In contrast, this chipless RFID system works in a very wide bandwidth, 
greater than 500 MHz [29]. In conventional chipped tags, amplitude shift key­
ing (ASK) and binary phase shift keying (BPSK) are mostly used as modulation 
techniques and time domain reflectometry for transmitting and reception of data. 
On the other hand, this system uses amplitude attenuation and phase jumps in a 
continuous wave (CW) for encoding data. In terms of a communications protocol 
used to establish data communication between the tags and their reader, chipped 
tags use a handshake algorithm by responding to the reader’s polling signal. How­
ever, this chipless RFID system is fully passive and no handshake algorithms are 
possible.
The tag is a planar microwave resonance structure consisting of spiral resona­
tors, split-ring resonators, and so forth. They resonate at different frequencies of 
the operating frequency bandwidth. Each resonator is a bandstop filter. Therefore, 
the tag could be modeled as a series of bandstop filters connected in series with two 
cross-polarized UWB monopole antennas [29]. A block diagram and a photograph 
of a prototype of the tag are shown in Figures 2.9.
Spiral resonators are gap coupled to a 50 microstrip transmission line. A single 
spiral resonator coupled to a microstrip line can be modeled with a parallel RLC 
network. The equivalent circuit of the tag derived based on this model is shown in 
Figure 2.10. Each parallel RLC network generates a high-Q stopband at a desig­
nated frequency [51]. Therefore, N spirals coupled to the microstrip line generate

2.2.1  Operating Principle for Reading of Multiresonator Based Chipless RFID 
Tags
Since the chipless tag is a fully passive microwave structure, an external source of 
electromagnetic signals is needed for the interrogation. When the tag is illuminated 
with a sufficiently wideband signal to cover all the frequencies of the multiresonat­
ing structure, it creates a spectral signature, which can be converted into a series of 
bits (1’s and 0’s). Figure 2.11 explains the operation of the tag. When the tag is il­
luminated with a wideband signal as shown in the figure, due to the captured signal 
by the receive (Rx) antenna of the tag, resonators start resonating at the designed 
frequencies and create attenuations in the amplitude. Further, it creates phase jumps 
at each resonating frequency since each resonator acts as a bandstop filter. This 
signal is then retransmitted back from the transmit (Tx) antenna of the tag. The 
presence of a resonator creates attenuation in amplitude of the frequency spectrum

Chipless RFID System Operating Principles
and creates phase jumps, whereas the absence of a resonator does not create either 
amplitude attenuation or phase jumps. Ultimately, the resonator circuit creates a 
frequency signature in the received signal from the Rx antenna of the tag. This sig­
nal with its frequency signature is transmitted back through the transmit antenna 
of the tag. The frequency signature can be controlled by varying the resonance fre­
quencies and using different combinations of resonance frequencies. This property 
is converted into bits by using a convention such as this: The presence of amplitude 
attenuation and phase jump is bit 0 and the absence of amplitude or phase jump at 
the predetermined frequency is bit 1.
The techniques and components used for generating the wideband signal, re­
ceiving the signals from the tags, and decoding the data by identifying the frequen­
cy signature are described in Chapters 3 and 4. 
2.2.1.1  Operation of a Multiresonator Circuit
Figure 2.12 shows the measured results for a the multiresonator circuit. An Agilent 
E8361A performance network analyzer (PNA) was used to measure the tags. The 
forward transmission coefficient (S21) of the multiresonator circuit is measured to 
identify the resonances. The forward transmission coefficient of the multiresonator 
circuit contains two parts, amplitude and phase. The resonance can be observed 
in both the amplitude and phase of the transmission coefficient measurements as 
shown in Figures 2.12(a) and (b). The measured results show nine dips in the am­
plitude response and nine deviations from the linear phase variation. Each dip and 
phase variation corresponds to the resonance that occurs in the multiresonator cir­
cuit. Based on the notation used earlier in this chapter, the tags contain 9 bits. The

respectively.
2.3  Methods for Reading RFID Tags
Many types of RFID readers are available for reading various tags with ASICs and 
chipless tags. Any RFID reader that is used to read chipped or chipless tags contains 
three major sections: 
1.	 An antenna;
2.	 An RF section;
3.	 A control section. 
A block diagram of an RFID reader is shown in Figure 2.13. One or more antennas 
are used to transmit and receive RF signals. 
The RF section usually contains both the transmitter and receiver circuits in 
a section called the transceiver section. The outputs of the RF transceiver section 
are interfaced with the data and signal processing unit belonging to the control 
section. The processing of the outputs of the RF section and decoding data is done 
at the data and signal processing unit. The RF transceiver section is controlled by 
the control unit and usually implemented in the digital section of the reader. Even 
RFID tags with ASIC chips use many techniques such as ASK, BPSK, and FSK to

Chipless RFID System Operating Principles
transmit data. Therefore, the RF section is customized to suit the communication 
technique used in the tag.
As discussed in this chapter, chipless RFID systems do not contain an RF trans­
mitter or any active modulation scheme on the tag. Therefore, it is not possible 
to use conventional data communication techniques to extract data from chipless 
tags. Because many methods are being used to encode data in chipless tags, highly 
customized readers are required to extract the data from them. Although it would 
be preferable to use an off-the-shelf reader in chipless RFID systems, it is impos­
sible due to the differences of the operating principles. The chipless readers are 
typically designed to read a particular type of tag and cannot be used with another 
type of tag. This section provides an overview of the reading processes of different 
types of chipless RFID tags.
2.3.1  Reading Time Domain Based Chipless RFID Tags
Time domain tags either use reflected echoes from the passive structure or a stream 
of reflected pulses from the tag to encode data. The time information of the received 
signals is important in these readers. Therefore, the reading process involves gen­
eration of the interrogation signal and recording of the incoming RF signal with 
accurate timing information. Typically high-speed sampling devices or envelope de­
tectors are used based on the requirement of the signal processing technique. As an 
example, if the chipless tag uses the timing information of the reflected echo from 
the tag as mentioned in [56], a high-speed sampling device is needed for the reader. 
The sampled signal is analyzed and processed to recover data in the digital section. 
In a laboratory a high-speed sampling oscilloscope or some other high-speed sam­
pler can be used [56]. 
2.3.2  Reading Frequency Domain Based Chipless RFID Tags
Frequency domain based chipless RFID systems require the measurement or iden­
tification of the frequency response of the tag. For most of the frequency domain 
chipless RFID tags, a similar process of characterization of the tag in the frequency 
domain is needed to extract the data. Therefore, the reader should be capable of 
generating and receiving the signals with sufficient bandwidth to cover the operat­
ing frequency range of the tag. Typically the operating range is several gigahertz 
in most of the frequency domain chipless RFID tags [3, 29]. Identification of the 
amplitude and phase changes between the transmitted and received RF signal is the 
key operating principle for most of the chipless tags. Therefore, most of the time, 
the timing information of the RF signals is not critical as long as they provide accu­
rate frequency and sufficient bandwidth. RF imaging based identification also can 
be considered a frequency domain based reading method. The SAR based chipless 
RFID tag uses a small radar system and signal processing method to identify the 
data encoded in the tag [46, 47]. 
Typical laboratory equipment that is used to characterize the RF components 
in the frequency domain can be used to read chipless RFID tags. A vector network 
analyzer is a good example of such laboratory equipment that can be used to read 
some of the chipless RFID tags. The PNA works as both the signal source and the 
receiver and displays the frequency response of the tag [29]. In addition to that, 

2.3  Methods for Reading RFID Tags 
37
using a signal analyzer and a signal generator, the amplitude response of the chi­
pless RFID tag can be measured. Use of laboratory equipment to read the chipless 
RFID tags is discussed in Chapters 3 and 4. 
2.3.3  Reading Hybrid Domain Based Chipless RFID Tags
Hybrid domain based chipless RFID tag reading requires accurate generation and 
identification of timing information of the transmitted and received signals. In ad­
dition to the recording of timing information, the reader should be capable of ana­
lyzing the signal in the frequency domain to identify the spectral features of the 
incoming RF signal. Combining time and frequency domains increases the data 
carrying capability of the chipless tag. However, it also increases the complexity and 
the cost of the reader. Figure 2.14 shows a proposed reading method for a hybrid 
domain chipless tag. A UWB RF pulse is transmitted to the receive antenna of the 
chipless tag. The two outputs of the tag are transmitted back to the reader and it 
records the two pulses in the time domain by using a high-speed sampler. Then, 
with a digital signal processing technique, the frequency spectrum is obtained to 
identify the resonances introduced by the ID generation circuit [50]. Together with 
the identified resonances, the timing information in the recorded signal can be used 
to identify the encoded data bits in the tag.
In a laboratory a high-speed sampling oscilloscope can be used to record the 
signals and signal processing software used to analyze the frequency response.
2.3.4  SAR Based Reading Process
SAR principles require the relative motion between the antenna and the target. 
Figure 2.15 shows such a reading technique [46]. Usually the antenna is mounted 
on a moving platform and by using a single beam-forming antenna the target is 
illuminated repeatedly with short bursts of RF waves. Alternately, a semicircular 
grid switched beam antenna array can be used to avoid the physical movement of 
Figure 2.14  The reading of a hybrid domain chipless RFID tag.

the reader antenna. Detailed technical descriptions of switched beam antennas can 
be found in [57–61].
The reflected signals are received successively at different antenna positions 
and coherently detected and processed together to form an image of the illuminated 
target. The working principle of the SAR based chipless RFID tags is very similar to 
the conventional SAR implementation in microwave imaging systems. Sometimes a 
switching set of antennas is used instead of the relative movement to scan the full 
surface of the SAR based chipless tags. Then the received signals are processed to 
obtain an image of the tag, which is converted into a stream of bits using a signal 
processing algorithm. The resolution of the image depends on the frequency of the 
RF signal used to illuminate the tag. Millimeter-wave RF signal provides resolution 
of a few millimeters. Therefore, a high data capacity is possible with smaller size 
tags. 
2.4  Conclusion
This chapter presented a comprehensive review of chipless RFID tags. Time do­
main and frequency domain tags were introduced as the two main categories of 
chipless tags. Time domain based tags use the timing information of the RF signals 
to encode data. Frequency domain tags use spectral features to encode data. The 
new term hybrid domain was introduced to categorize the tags that use both time 
domain and frequency domain principles to encode data. Detailed descriptions of 
the operating principle of multiresonator based chipless RFID tags act as the foun­
dation for Chapters 3 through 6 of this book. In this chapter a brief introduction 
to various reading methods has been provided for different types of chipless tags. 
Whatever techniques are implemented in the chipless RFID systems, the common 
goal is to increase the data capacity, compactness, and compatibility with existing 
systems and, finally, to achieve sub-cent tag prices.

Chipless RFID Readers
3.1  Introduction to Chipless RFID Readers
The preceding chapter explained the three main types of chipless RFID tags: fre­
quency, time, and hybrid domain based tags and their operating principles. This 
chapter presents various types of reader architectures and the operating principles 
used to successfully read those tags. The main theme of this book is chipless RFID 
tag reader architectures. Therefore, this chapter lays the foundation for the whole 
theme of the book. After reading the first three chapters, the readers of the book 
will have learned background information and the fundamental principles of chi­
pless RFID technology on the whole. These three chapters present the state of the 
art of the chipless RFID systems. Then the reader will gain more specific informa­
tion on technical specifications, design details, and niche areas of chipless RFID 
reader designs in later chapters. 
A reader is the device that performs the interrogation of any RFID system. In 
technical nomenclature, it is sometimes called the interrogator. In chipped RFID 
systems, the architecture of the reader is almost the same even for different types 
of tags, because common data communication techniques are used for transferring 
data between the tag and its reader [1]. However, in chipless RFID systems, due to 
the differences discussed in Chapter 2, the architectures of the readers need to be 
different. The signal processing techniques that are used in the readers also need to 
be unique based on the technique used in the tag to encode data.
As discussed in Chapter 2 chipless RFID tags are passive devices and have no 
ability to generate their own signal for communication purposes. Without a sig­
nal generated by an external source, chipless tags cannot send information to the 
reader. Once the tag is illuminated with a suitable signal generated by a reader, the 
received signal from the tag is captured. Then it is processed in the software (some­
times it is called the middleware) and converted into useful information typically 
as data bits [2].
This chapter provides information on different types of chipless RFID read­
er systems with a comprehensive review of commercially available and reported 
reader systems in the open literature. Also, this chapter provides a foundation for 
understanding the different principles and techniques used in chipless RFID tag 
interrogation in the rest of the book.

Chipless RFID Readers
Next we take a look at the details of chipless RFID reader system architectures.
3.2  Chipless RFID Reader System Architectures
RFID reader technology is a combination of several disciplines such as microwave 
or RF engineering, digital systems design, antenna engineering, digital signal pro­
cessing, and computer engineering. To understand the architecture of an RFID 
reader, a basic understanding of the technologies and disciplines used in the design 
is required due to the multidisciplinary nature of RFID technology.
As discussed in Chapter 2 three major subsystems can be identified in any 
chipped or chipless RFID system, although there are many differences between 
these systems. They are:
••
Antenna;
••
RF section; 
••
Digital control and data processing section. 
Figure 2.13 shows a block diagram of a general RFID reader system that il­
lustrates the above three units. Although there are three common subsystems in 
every RFID system, the architecture of each subsystem is different. Due to these 
differences, the controlling and signal processing algorithms are different from one 
reader system to another.
The following section provides an overview of a chipless RFID reader system archi­
tecture and also details for each subsystem.
3.2.1  General Overview of Chipless RFID Reader Architecture
The architecture of a chipless RFID reader is described using an existing chipless 
RFID reader design. Figure 3.1 shows the design of a chipless RFID reader used for 
multiresonator based chipless RFID tag reading [3, 4]. This reader design is used 
only as an example to introduce the functionality and the typical components used 
to build up each subsystem. It is important to note again that the architecture and 
the operation of the reader are different for different types of chipless RFID tags.
3.2.1.1  Antennas
Antennas work as the sensory organs ( eyes, ears, and mouth) of the RFID system. 
All interactions between the reader and the tags pass through the antennas in the 
form of electromagnetic (EM) waves. The system can have a single or multiple 
antennas depending on the requirements of the application and technology used 
in the RFID tags. Irrespective of the number of antennas, the basic function of an 
antenna is to transmit and receive EM waves to establish communication between 
the tag and the reader.
The function of antennas can be understood by comparing the communication 
of a human body. The antennas are illuminating an area of the surrounding space, 
similar to looking in one direction with the eyes to pick up one or a few objects 

3.2  Chipless RFID Reader System Architectures

from a large set. This process is also called spatial filtering. Spatial filtering reduces 
the collision of communication with tags [4]. Similar to hearing sounds with ears, 
antennas “listen” to EM waves and this process is called reception of EM waves. 
The speaking (function of the mouth) of a communication process can be identified 
as transmitting EM waves toward a certain direction. Chapter 7 discusses various 
antennas for RFID reader systems.
The use of smart antennas increases the capabilities of the antennas and en­
hances the performance of the RFID systems. A comprehensive description on the 
use of smart antennas in RFID systems is presented in another publication by the 
author [5].
3.2.1.2  RF Section
The RF section is responsible for generating the interrogation signal and receiving 
and demodulating the information carrying signal from the tag. The RF section is 
an interconnected collection of different RF components. The typical components 
are an RF signal source such as an oscillator; frequency conversion mixers, power 
amplifiers, low-noise amplifiers, lowpass/bandpass filters; and power dividers. De­
pending on the technology used in the reader architecture, there may be components 
such as a gain/phase detector (GPD) as shown in Figure 3.1 and power detectors, 
which are not common in other RF receiver or RFID reader units.
There are two different signal paths in the RF section: the receiver path and the 
transmitter path. The transmitter path usually contains strong RF signals compared

Chipless RFID Readers
to the receiver path. The signal source or sources generate the RF signal to be trans­
mitted using an oscillator. It is a usual practice to use a VCO and tune it to obtain 
the desired frequency in wideband or multiband RF systems [6]. For narrowband 
systems, oscillators that are tuned to a fixed frequency are used. The type of oscil­
lator or signal source basically depends on the operating frequency and the desired 
frequency band of operation. In the design shown in Figure 3.1 a YIG oscillator 
[6] is used and the operating frequency is 3 to 6 GHz. The output frequency is con­
trolled using a voltage input as shown in the figure.
There might be a coupler to extract a small portion of the transmitted signal, as 
a reference signal to be used in the demodulation process in the receiver path. The 
presented reader design as shown in Figure 3.1 has an asymmetric coupled line cou­
pler that extracts a small portion of the transmitted signal, also called a pilot signal 
or a reference signal. There is an RF power amplifier for amplifying the RF output 
of the oscillator if the required power level is not generated from the oscillator. It is 
important to be aware of the input power level to the power amplifier; otherwise, 
higher power level inputs might drive the RF power amplifier into saturation.
Received signals are weak in comparison to the transmitted signals and require 
amplification. LNAs are used to amplify such weak signals in the received path 
as shown in Figure 3.1. The two mixers in the reader design down-convert the 
incoming RF signal and reference signal into an intermediate frequency (IF) sig­
nal for demodulation. In this design only the frequency down-conversion is done. 
However in some reader architectures, a frequency up-conversion might happen 
using mixers. Lowpass filters (LPFs) or sometimes bandpass filters (BPFs) are used 
to filter out the unwanted frequencies created during the frequency up-conversion 
or down-conversion processes. Sometimes, a bandpass filter is applied immediately 
after the receiver antenna in the receiver path.
The gain/phase detector (GPD) is a specialized RF component that compares 
the amplitude and phase of two RF signals [7]. In this design, a portion of the 
transmitted signal and the received signals is down-converted and compared with 
the GPD to identify the features of the frequency signature. More information on 
the operation of the GPD and the reader is presented in Chapter 4. The informa­
tion generated by the GPD output is acquired by the digital section for further 
processing.
This reader design example is presented to help this book’s readers understand 
the general overview of the reader architecture as well as to emphasize the use 
of unique features and components that are not commonly used in typical RFID 
readers.
3.2.1.3  Digital Section
A block diagram of the digital section is shown in Figure 3.1. The control of the 
reader is implemented on the middleware of the digital section. The control of the 
transmission of the interrogation signal, acquiring the down-converted or demodu­
lated signals from the RF section, and, if applicable, any additional signal process­
ing algorithms or anticollision algorithms are also implemented in this section. The 
primary function of the digital section of the RFID reader is to perform digital sig­
nal processing and recover the received data from the RFID transponder. Also, the 
control section enables the reader to communicate with the transponders wirelessly

by performing modulation and decoding the received data from the tags. These 
data are usually used to interrogate tags (read) or to reprogram the tag (write) in 
case of chipped tags. However, there are no reported chipless tags, which have a 
wireless reconfiguration capability. Therefore, for chipless RFID tags it can be said 
that the data are only used in reading the tag. This section usually consists of a 
microprocessor, a memory block, a few analog-to-digital converters, and a commu­
nication block for the software application. The typical digital section is based on a 
microprocessor or a field programmable gate array (FPGA). Chapter 9 presents the 
digital control section of the chipless RFID reader.
3.3  Chipless RFID Readers and Tag Reading Techniques
In Chapter 2, three major categories of chipless RFID tags were identified and 
their operation and techniques used in encoding data without using a chip were 
discussed. The identified three types of tags are:
••
 Time domain (TD) chipless tags;
••
 Frequency domain chipless tags;
••
 Hybrid domain chipless tags. 
A short description of the techniques used for reading the tag ID or encoded data 
on the tags was given at the end of Chapter 2. To read the three types of chipless 
RFID tags, four types of reading techniques were also introduced in the last section 
of Chapter 2. Based on the four types of techniques used to read the tags, chipless 
RFID readers can be categorized into four types:
1.	 Time domain chipless RFID readers;
2.	 Frequency domain chipless RFID readers;
3.	 Hybrid domain chipless RFID readers;
4.	 SAR based chipless RFID readers.
This section provides a review of reader architectures and reading methods 
used in commercially available chipless RFID systems and reported chipless RFID 
systems in the open scientific literature. More focus is being given to the reader 
architecture and operating principle of the reader system since the operating prin­
ciples of tags are discussed in Chapter 2. The construction of the reader system and 
the details of the functional blocks of the reader are explained in detail. The block 
diagrams of the reader systems discussed in this section are also provided whenever 
possible.
Since the chipless tag is a fully passive device, it is required to have two com­
mon features in all four types of chipless RFID readers. They are: 
1.	 The generation of an interrogation signal;
2.	 All the signal processing related to tag ID extraction. 
Therefore, all RFID readers are required to have a unit to generate a suitable inter­
rogation signal and a unit to process the received signal and decode the tag ID.

Chipless RFID Readers
3.3.1	
Time Domain Readers and Tag Reading Techniques
Time domain based chipless RFID tags use reflected echoes as a stream of pulses 
reflected from the tag to encode the data. The tag reading process involves generat­
ing an interrogation signal, capturing the signals received from the tag, processing 
the signals, and decoding the tag ID or data bits encoded in the tag. This section 
describes few selected chipless RFID readers that work on time domain based oper­
ating principles and the different methods used to interrogate and decode the data 
encoded in the tags.
3.3.1.1  SAW Time Domain Reader
A SAW based RFID tag is one of the successful commercial chipless tags [2]. The 
operating principles of SAW tags are described in detail in Chapter 2. The SAW tag 
is categorized as a time domain based chipless tag and uses short RF pulses as inter­
rogation signals [8]. However, frequency domain based SAW tag reading processes 
have also been reported [9, 10]. Figure 3.2 shows a block diagram of a reader that 
works on the time domain based principle.
As shown in Figure 3.2, an RF oscillator is used as the RF signal source. Using 
rapid HF switches, a short RF pulse is generated. The RF signal (pulse) is ampli­
fied with a power amplifier if the strength of the output of the RF signal source 
is not sufficient. The international scientific and medical (ISM) frequency band 
(typically 2.45 GHz) is used in most of the SAW tags since the unlicensed usage of 
the frequency band is possible. The bandwidth of the signal is usually kept around 
100 MHz. The pulse created using rapid HF switches is applied to the antenna by 
placing the RF switch in the proper position. If a SAW chipless tag is in the inter­
rogation range of the reader, the transmitted short pulse is received by the antenna 
of the tag.
The tag converts the short pulse to a surface wave [8], and the reflective struc­
tures of the tag start reflecting the generated surface wave. Once the reflected puls­
es reach the reader antennas of the SAW tag, they are retransmitted with the tag 
antenna elements. The usual return time of the reflected pulses from the tag is a 
few microseconds. Due to this comparatively long propagation delay compared to 
other electromagnetic reflections caused by the surrounding environment, it is easy 
to separate the reflections of the signals from the surrounding objects. The received 
signals are passed through the receiver path of the reader by choosing it with the 
HF switch (also called a duplex switch). The signal is amplified with an LNA and 
demodulated with a quadrature demodulator [11]. The decoded in-phase (I) and

quadrature-phase (Q) components are sampled with an analog-to-digital converter 
(ADC). The two orthogonal components of the received signals can be used to 
identify the time delay between the received pulses or the phase angle between 
those. The time delays are then converted into a sequence of bits according to the 
protocol used to encode data. Usually a group of bits is represented with a number 
of pulses (e.g., 16 bits are represented with four pulses [12]) and the data bits are 
represented according to the position of the pulse in a specific time window. A 
photo of a RFSAW reader system and an antenna is shown in Figure 3.3.
3.3.1.2  UWB-IR Time Domain Chipless RFID Readers
Ultra-wideband impulse radio (UWB-IR) systems have a distinguishing feature such 
as extremely large signal bandwidth. This feature enables a number of properties 
unique to UWB-IR systems: high data rate with low transmitting power, good signal 
penetration, little fading of the signal amplitude at the receiver, and the ability for 
precise localization. Much research has been conducted on data communication, 
medical applications, sensors, radar, and positioning.
More recently, increasing interest is being paid to UWB technology based chi­
pless RFID systems. This section provides an introduction to chipless RFID reader 
systems recently reported about in the scientific literature [13–18]. To the authors’ 
best of knowledge, there are no reported UWB-IR based commercial chipless RFID 
systems as yet.
Based on published work, the block diagram of a UWB-IR based reader is 
shown in Figure 3.4. There is a UWB impulse generator that generates a short RF 
pulse. The width of the RF pulse is in the range of a few hundred picoseconds to a 
few nanoseconds [16, 17] based on the required bandwidth. The chipless RFID tag 
may operate on different principles and most of the published works are based on 
time domain reflectometry [14, 16, 17]. The receiver block contains a high-speed 
sampling device. The experimental work has been carried out using either a PC 
based high-speed sampler [16] or a high-speed digital storage oscilloscope (DSO) 
[13, 17].

Chipless RFID Readers
The sampled signal is processed with different signal processing techniques. 
Lazaro et al. [16] used a continuous wavelet based signal processing technique to 
detect a chipless RFID tag based on time domain reflectometry (TDR). A time-
coded tag with terminated transmission line is used in this experiment. Hu et al. 
[17] analyze the antenna mode scattering of a UWB pulse of the tag. The tag has 
a simple passive structure with one antenna and terminated transmission line. Ka­
lansuriya and Karmakar [14] proposed a different tag design with a spiral resona­
tor loaded transmission line and a UWB monopole antenna. They use a technique 
similar to that proposed for identifying the signature of the tag [14]. Another TDR 
based chipless tag is reported by Zheng et al. [15]. A transmission line with capaci­
tive discontinuities is used to encode the data. By analyzing the reflected signal re­
corded with a high-speed DSO, the bits are identified. A pulse position modulation 
(PPM) based UWB chipless RFID tag has been proposed by Gupta et al. [13]. The 
chipless tag contains two cross-polarized antennas as the receive and transmit an­
tennas. A dispersive delay structure (DDS) is used to obtain different group delays 
for different frequencies. The retransmitted pulses are recorded with a high-speed 
DSO and analyzed for obtaining the encoded data.
The next section presents information about existing frequency domain reader 
designs.
3.3.2  Frequency Domain Readers and Tag Reading Techniques
A comprehensive review of frequency domain based chipless RFID tags was pre­
sented in the previous chapter. The frequency domain chipless tags use the ampli­
tude or phase of the frequency response or both amplitude and phase to encode 
data on the tag. Therefore, the reading of the chipless tag involves a process similar 
to that used for characterizing a passive RF device in the frequency domain. Ac­
cording to the technique used to encode data on the tag, the reading process and the 
reader architecture are different from one another. However, the sequence of opera­
tion introduced in time domain readers (generate the interrogation signal, transmit 
and receive it, process and decode data) is also valid for frequency domain readers. 
In this section, a selected set of chipless RFID readers that work in the frequency do­
main is presented. The selection of readers is done based on the different techniques 
carried out in the reading process. The selected set of readers covers the frequency

domain reader operating principles and operating frequency bands.
3.3.2.1   Tagsense Chipless RFID Readers
Two chipless RFID systems reported on in [19–21] have been developed by Tag­
sense. They work in the 1- to 50-MHz frequency range. The reader reported in [20, 
22] is commercially available. The block diagram of the reader system is shown in 
Figure 3.5. 
The operation of the chipless RFID tag used with the readers is explained in 
[20]. The frequency signature depends on the shape of the conductive tracks of the 
tag. With different track shapes and modifications done by shorting and so on, it 
is possible to achieve multiple resonances. The multiple resonance frequencies are 
used to represent multibit data on the chipless RFID tag.
The reader system used to read these tags is shown in Figure 3.6. It contains a 
swept-frequency source, a signal detector, a directional coupler, an antenna, and a 
data and signal processing unit. One loop antenna is used as the reader antenna. 
The directional coupler transfers the signal generated by the source to the reader 
antenna and this signal is used as the interrogation signal. The frequency is swept 
in the range of 1 to 50 MHz. The antenna transmits the signals to the tags within 
its effective range. Then the antenna receives the response signal from the tag with 
frequency signatures. The received signal travels in the reverse direction, which 
is the opposite direction of the interrogation signal as shown in the figure. This 
reverse signal does not travel to the RF source. It passes to the third port, which is 
connected to the detector due to the operation of the directional coupler. The de­
tector samples the received signal and senses the power of the signal. It is possible 
to use a threshold based technique to identify the resonance peaks by observing 
the amplitude of the received signal. Other techniques that are used to convert the 
signal into the frequency domain use either the fast Fourier transform (FFT) or a 
SAW transducer. Then, by determining the number of resonance peaks of the re­
ceived signal, it is possible to identify the encoded data by analyzing the frequency

response of the tag. The tag reader system provides encoding of up to 32 bits of 
data within the operating frequency range of 1 to 50 MHz.
The other chipless RFID system [21] developed by Tagsense works on a differ­
ent principle. The block diagram of the reader system is shown in Figure 3.7. Some 
of the materials in the tag have high permittivity and permeability. As shown in the 
figure, the reader system contains a tunable oscillator connected to a coil antenna. 
The coil antenna works as one tuning element of the oscillator. When there are no 
tags in the range of the reader antenna coil, the tunable oscillator oscillates at a 
certain frequency. This frequency can be called the characteristic frequency. In the 
presence of a tag in the range of the reader antenna coil, the characteristics of the 
coil change (inductance of the coil). This change results in a different operating 
frequency in the tunable oscillator. By counting the frequency of the oscillator, it is 
possible to identify different sets of objects. However, the number of objects that 
can be used with this system (i.e., the number of bits that can be encoded) is less 
than that for the previous system, the LC-10 reader system [20]. The two reader 
systems have a limited reading range and operating frequency range.

3.3.2.2  Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) Frequency Domain Reader
The SAW chipless RFID tags belong to the time domain based category of tags. The 
operating principle of a reader that works on time domain principles was discussed 
in Section 3.3.1. However, techniques that were developed based on frequency do­
main principles are available [9, 10] for interrogating SAW chipless RFID tags. A 
reader based on the frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar prin­
ciple is shown in Figure 3.8.
 As shown in Figure 3.8, the RF source generates a chirp signal and it is passed 
through the directional coupler to the reader antenna. The antenna does the sig­
nal transmission and the reception. The retransmitted signals from the SAW tag 
reach the antenna, travel through the directional coupler, and then pass through the 
directional coupler to its port 3. The transmitted signal is coupled to port 4. Ho­
modyne reception is achieved by mixing the two signals obtained from ports 3 and 
4 of the directional coupler. The output of the mixer is passed through a lowpass 
filter (LPF) and sampled with an ADC. For the interrogation of SAW chipless RFID 
tags, the standard practice is to use either a linear frequency modulated continuous 
wave (LFMCW) or linear frequency stepped continuous wave (LFSCW) interroga­
tion signal [10]. However, most of the VCO based LFMCW or LFSCW generation 
is a slow process due to the stability of the oscillator frequencies. Therefore, in [10] 
a direct digital synthesis (DDS) based FMCW signal generation scheme is used that 
is faster than other methods. However, this FMCW signal generation scheme gen­
erates a nonlinear signal. The effect of nonlinearity is compensated by rearranging 
the sampled signal in a timescale to obtain a signal similar to the one received from 
a LFMCW signal.
As shown in Figure 3.8, the transmitted signal is an up-chirp signal (frequency 
of the chip signal increases with time). Due to the operation of the SAW transducer, 
the retransmitted signal from the tag is the time-reverse of the interrogation signal 
[9]. Therefore, the response of the tag becomes a down-chirp signal (frequency 
of the chirp signal decreases with time). However, the electromagnetic reflections 
that might occur due to the surrounding environment have an up-chirp frequency 
profile similar to that of the transmitted signal. Therefore, it is easy to separate the 
response of the tag from surrounding reflections with signal processing. After the 
rearrangement of samples to remove the effect of the nonlinear interrogation chirp 
signal, the FFT can be used to recover the frequency response of the SAW tag and 
decode the ID.

3.3.2.3  Chipless RFID Readers for Multiresonator Based Chipless Tag Interrogation
Three generations of chipless RFID readers for interrogating multiresonator based 
chipless RFID tags have been reported by the authors’ research group [3, 4, 23, 24]. 
The block diagram for a first-generation reader is shown in Figure 3.9. The reader 
operates over a 500-MHz frequency band from 2.0 to 2.5 GHz. A DAC is used 
to generate a swept-frequency signal with a VCO. The generated signal is passed 
through the tag as shown in the figure and the retransmitted signal is captured by 
the receiving antenna. The received signal is passed through a bandpass filter and 
amplified with a LNA. The amplified signal is fed to a diode detector to capture 
the envelope of the received signal. The resonances that occur in the tag make local 
minima in the envelope. If there is a resonance, it is considered to be a logic 1; other­
wise, it is considered to be a logic 0. For the best results, a calibration tag is required 
to differentiate between the 1’s and 0’s. With envelope detection, only the amplitude 
response of the frequency signature can be captured with a first-generation reader.
The block diagram of the second-generation reader design is shown in Figure 
3.10. The operating frequency is as same as for the first-generation reader. How­
ever, with the use of a gain/phase detector (GPD) it is possible to extract both the 
amplitude and phase responses of the frequency signature of the chipless tag. The 
swept frequency is generated with the same technique used in the first-generation 
reader. A reference signal to the GPD is extracted from the output of the VCO. The 
signal received from the tag is amplified and compared with the reference signal 
to identify the amplitude differences and phase jumps that occur due to resonators 
of the chipless tag. The ability to recover both amplitude and phase increases the 
accuracy and reliability of the readings.
The block diagram of the UWB reader, a third-generation reader, is shown in 
Figure 3.1 [4, 23]. The components of the reader were explained in the previous 
section. This reader design uses a GPD to capture the amplitude and phase respons­
es of the frequency signature of the chipless tag, similar to the second-generation 
version. However, the VCO of this reader generates higher frequencies than the 
operating frequency range of the GPD. Therefore, to compare the reference and 
received signals from the tag for the amplitude and phase differences, it is required 
to down-convert to a suitable frequency. The two mixers are used to down-convert 
the reference signal extracted from the transmitted signal and received signal from 
the tag along with a local oscillator (LO). The LO is kept at a fixed frequency in 
Figure 3.9  First-generation chipless RFID reader for interrogating multiresonator based chipless 
tags. It detects only the amplitude response of the frequency signature [4].

this design. This introduces a limitation on the operating bandwidth of the reader. 
Because the local oscillator is kept at a fixed frequency, the intermediate frequency 
(IF) of the two mixers varies with the transmitted frequency. Therefore, the IF can 
have a maximum swing of 2.6 GHz (operating range of the gain phase detector: 
0.1 to 2.7 GHz). Due to the varying IF frequency, the extraction of phase informa­
tion process is also poor in this reader. A photo of the reader RF section is shown 
in Figure 3.11.
3.3.2.4  Nicanti Swipe Reader for NiCode Chipless Tag Reading
A printable chipless RFID system developed by Nicanti [25–27] uses a reader that 
can be considered as working with frequency domain based principles. The block di­
agram of the reader, a cross section of a printed tag and reading process, is shown in 
Figure 3.12. The tag, called NiCode, is printed on any substrate used for packaging

goods such as paper or plastics. A combination of proprietary conductive inks is 
used to print patterns to form a chipless tag. Printing techniques such as ink-jet or 
screen printing can be used for small-scale applications and a thermal transfer based 
technique is proposed for large-scale printing applications [27]. The printed pattern 
is protected with an insulating layer. On top of this insulation layer, anything can be 
printed using standard nonconductive inks as shown in Figure 3.12.
The block diagram of the reader device is also shown in Figure 3.12. An AC 
bridge circuit is formed by the section of the tag covered with electrodes. An RF 
signal is applied to the formed bridge circuit by the reader unit RF generator. The 
tag section covered by the electrodes can be modeled as a network of resistors 
and capacitors [25]. The set of electrodes does not directly contact the conductive 
section of the tag. Only placing the reader electrodes over the insulating layer is 
sufficient to make a capacitive coupling from the bridge circuit for the reading. 
Therefore, this method can be considered to be a noncontact reading technique and 
can be considered to be a type of chipless RFID system. An RF signal of 50 MHz is 
generated by the reader and injected to the AC bridge circuit. The current flowing 
through the electrodes is measured and the impedance of the tag section is calcu­
lated. The real and imaginary components of the impedance are used to encode the 
data of the tag. The size of the tag depends on the number of data bits encoded in 
the tag. When the size of the tag increases, the reader is swiped over the tag area 
to cover the whole tag. During the swiping process, the current flowing through 
the electrodes is recorded. Using signal processing techniques, the impedance at 
different sections is calculated from the recorded signal. The reader is interfaced 
to the PC with a cable or a wireless technology such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Secure 
data transfer protocols are used to transfer data from reader to PC when using the 
reader with security-sensitive work. A photograph of the reader is shown in Figure 
3.13.
3.3.3  Hybrid Domain Readers and Tag Reading Techniques
The hybrid domain tag design [28] reported by the authors’ research group and a 
reading technique were discussed in Chapter 2. A comprehensive description of the 
design of the readers for hybrid domain tags is presented in Chapter 6.

This section discusses three commercial chipless RFID system tags that use SAR

operate on different working principles.
3.3.4.1  Printed Chipless RFID Tag Reader System Developed by Vubiq
As shown in Figure 3.14, the reader system developed by Vubiq [29, 30] utilizes 
radar technology to identify and decode chipless tags. The chipless tag is printed 
using conductive inks. Typically an array of antenna shapes is printed on a sub­
strate. The array of antennas is organized to be resonating at different frequencies 
and scatter the received RF signals with different polarizations. The data of these 
tags are encoded in phase and polarization of these antenna elements. The reader 
transmit antenna polarizations are controlled using a control unit as shown in Fig­
ure 3.14. Using this arrangement it is possible to transmit and receive signals with 
two different polarizations simultaneously. The reader illuminates the tag area with 
a millimeter-wave RF signal in the frequency range of the resonant frequency of the 
antenna elements on the tag.
The beam scanning is achieved with an antenna and a control unit. It utilizes 
the scanning of the tag area to support the SAR imaging. The receive antenna cap­
tures the reradiated signals from the tag and the captured signals are stored in the 
memory of the reader device. Using signal processing algorithms based on SAR, 
the reader develops an image of the reader system. Mathematical focus algorithms 
used in radar imaging are used to obtain high-resolution images of the scanned 
area. The antenna orientation and sizes are obtained from the image by analyzing 
the phase and polarization data captured in the reading process. The identified

phase and polarization information are converted back to the data or as the ID of 
the tag.
The reader device contains an RF transmitter and receiver, a digital signal pro­
cessor (DSP), a control processor, and control units to drive the transmit and re­
ceive antennas. The reader device needs to perform complex signal processing us­
ing the DSP to develop the image of the scanned tag. Another processor (control 
processor) is used to control and synchronize the operation of other units of the 
reader. The reader is utilized with wired or wireless networks to support industry 
standard data communication interfaces.
3.3.4.2  Chipless RFID Tag Reader System Developed by InkSure
Another SAR based chipless RFID tag reading system has been developed by Ink­
Sure as reported in [31]. The block diagram of the reader and tag reading process 
is shown in Figure 3.15.
The tag comprises a substrate layer patterned with several diffraction elements 
having the dimension of the order of the wavelength of the illuminated RF signal. 
The frequency of the signal used to interrogate the tag is in the millimeter-wave 
range (typically 30 to 60 GHz). The elements are printed using conductive inks.

The printed patterns diffract the illuminated RF signals in different power levels. 
The operation of the tag in lower frequencies is also possible. However, the size 
of the tag becomes excessively large, which makes the tag not suitable for tagging 
applications.
The reader generates an RF signal in the millimeter-wave range and transmits 
using the array of antennas as shown in Figure 3.15. The antenna contains a large 
number of antenna elements. The antennas are switched to scan the interrogation 
beam across the tag. The millimeter-wave RF signals generated by the RF source 
are transmitted toward the tag with the antennas. The diffracted signals from the 
tag are captured with the same antenna array. The received signals by the receiver 
are processed and an image is developed using SAR signal processing techniques. 
The image is processed with a DSP assisted unit in the reader. The image represents 
the amount of diffraction of RF signals done by the tag. The data are extracted 
by considering the amount of diffraction and position of the diffraction of the tag 
area. The control unit provides the control of the operation of the reader and inter­
faces external communications with the reader. 
This system is different from the Vubiq in two ways although it uses SAR im­
aging techniques. First, the operating principle of the tag and reader architecture 
is different from that of the Vubiq tag reader system. Second, the type of materials 
used in the tag and reader architecture is different from InkSure’s chipless tags and 
readers.
3.3.4.3  Somark Ink Tattoo Chipless RFID Tag Reader System 
A chipless RFID system focused on animal tagging applications has been developed 
by Somark [32]. The chipless tag is printed in the form of a tattoo by using a spe­
cial ink on the animal’s skin. The tattoo is transferred to the animal’s skin using a 
technique similar to that used to print tattoos. However, it can be implemented on 
other substrates and the tag is not limited to tattoos. The tattoo ink contains dielec­
tric materials that scatter the RF signals. The tattoo contains a series of bars with 
different widths similar to a barcode. The data are encoded by using a number of 
bars having different widths [32].
The block diagram of the reader system and a model of the tag developed 
by Somark [32] are shown in Figure 3.16. The tag design is done for millimeter-
wave frequencies to reduce the size of the tags. The reader transmits a signal with 
the transmitter antenna. The antenna is either mechanically steered to cover the 
tag area or a beam is steered. As shown in Figure 3.16, the ink bars with smaller 
widths scatter the incoming RF signal in a smaller amount than the lines with high­
er widths. The reader antenna receives the scattered signals from the ink bars and 
records the strength of the scattered signal toward it. The information on the scat­
tered signal strength and the corresponding beam position are combined to form 
a 2D image of the tattoo with SAR image processing algorithms. The constructed 
image is used to identify the data encoded in the tag.
Although the three systems reported above use SAR techniques in signal pro­
cessing, they use entirely different operating principles and hardware configura­
tions in the physical layers.

3.4  Limitations and Issues with Current Chipless RFID Readers
As discussed earlier in the literature review, chipless RFID technology has attracted 
strong interest from many industry sectors. The chipless RFID is promising for 
many application areas for not only its low-cost characteristic but also its special 
properties that conventional chipped tags cannot offer. For conventional chipped 
RFID technology, many international (ISO) standards have been published that al­
low interoperability of different devices from different sources. For chipless RFID 
tags, some tags [8, 31] produce industry standard data formats for tagged items 
(e.g., SAW tags). However, many chipless RFID systems are still in their inception\
experimental stages for practical applications. Therefore, many challenges have to 
be overcome to enable the technology to be more attractive commercially. Figure 
3.17 shows some of the challenges that chipless RFID systems have been encounter­
ing. This section discusses the limitations and challenging issues related to existing 
chipless RFID reader systems.
3.4.1  Cost of Readers
In general, the function of the chipless tag is to produce a signature that can be 
identified by the reader. By removing the chip from the tag, all the burden of signal 
Figure 3.16  Chipless RFID reader developed by Somark to read the ink tattoo chipless tag. The tag structure 
is similar to that of a barcode. Bars with different widths are printed with a dielectric ink to obtain a unique 
code. A 2D image is developed to obtain the information coded in the tag using a similar technique to SAR 
[32].

processing is transferred to the reader. Therefore, the complexity of the reader is 
comparatively higher than that for conventional RFID readers. The increased com­
plexity in the physical layer design and its processing techniques generally increases 
the cost of the reader system. For example, the chipless systems that use SAR tech­
niques [29, 31, 32] require high-performance hardware platforms to meet the re­
quirements of their complex signal processing schemes. Although the cost of the tag 
is reduced, the cost of the reader increases due to the expensive components and sig­
nal processing chips1. However, when the technology matures, the manufacturing 
costs will decrease and the low-cost components and services required for system 
development will be available. IDTechEx advocates that the cost of the chipless tag 
reader and its peripherals will be comparable to that for the chipped tag reader [33].
3.4.2  Read Range
One of the main reasons RFID technology became popular is its reading flexibil­
ity and long-distance capabilities, which mean that less human intervention is re­
quired. With chipped active and passive RFIDs, achieving long operating distances 
compared to barcode systems is not difficult due to the on-chip transmitter of the 
tag. However, with passive chipless RFID tags, achieving long operating ranges is 
challenging due to the unavailability of the signal source on the tag. The developed 
chipless RFID tags operate over UWB frequency ranges from 3 to 11, 22 to 26, and 
around 60 GHz. There are stringent regulatory issues surrounding the transmitting 
of higher power in similar orders of magnitudes for the conventional chipped tags. 
For example, for UWB chipless tags only a few milliwatts of transmission power is 
permissible to comply with stringent regulations and not to interfere with existing 
telecommunications and weather radars. Contrary to this, the conventional RFID 
systems can transmit power on the order of a few watts. Therefore, reading dis­
tances for the chipless tags could be an issue.
A few tags having long operating ranges of up to about 100 feet in line-of-sight 
conditions [29, 30]. However, with multiple reflections (multipath propagation), it 
is not possible to achieve such a long distance in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) opera­
tion. The NLOS characteristic is one of the main reasons why RFID technology 
became popular, and it is becoming a challenging issue in chipless RFID technology 
today.
3.4.3  Tag Reading Speed
As discussed in Chapter 2 and in this chapter, most of the chipless RFID systems 
operate in a very wide bandwidth. In particular, those chipless RFID tags that use 
frequency signatures to encode data [3, 34, 35] use up to several gigahertz of band­
width. Reading of these tags requires generation of UWB signals. The widely used 
techniques for generating wideband signals with a several gigahertz frequency band 
use swept-frequency signals (frequency sweep) and narrow UWB RF pulses. The 
first technique swept-frequency signal generation is usually done with a wideband 
VCO or similar synthesized source. These wideband oscillators require a certain 
1.	
SAR techniques use millimeter-wave technology at 60 GHz and above. Hence, the hardware is very 
expensive.

62

Chipless RFID Readers
settling time to generate linear swept frequencies. They take significant time to 
cover the whole bandwidth using linear chirp. The second technique narrow UWB 
RF pulses can generate the UWB pulses within a very short period of time (typically 
several hundreds of picoseconds to several nanoseconds) [13, 14, 17]. The time 
required for signal generation is reduced with the use of short RF pulses. However, 
the main issue is the reception of short UWB pulses. To achieve the full benefit of 
the nanosecond range of signal generation time, it is required to sample the received 
signal with ultra-high-speed ADCs. The use of ultra-high-speed ADCs increases the 
cost of the reader system significantly.
Equivalent time sampling (ETS) is another standard technique that is used for 
sampling the signals in very high speed DSOs [36] to obtain the trace of subnano­
second signals. However, to use ETS, the input signal should be repeated a number 
of times to obtain enough samples to reconstruct the original signal with signal 
processing techniques [36, 37]. The requirement for the repetition of the signal 
means that the full benefit of the very small signal generation time is lost because 
signal reception requires much longer times. In addition to the longer reception 
time, signal processing techniques have to be applied to reconstruct the original re­
ceived signal [38, 39]. The reconstruction process leads to increased signal process­
ing complexity and increased time is required for the reading process. Therefore, 
achieving a high tag reading speed is another challenge for most chipless RFID 
systems.
3.4.4  Anticollision, Error Correction, and Data Integrity
The vision for chipless RFID tag development is item-level tagging in mass de­
ployment. Therefore, multiple tag reading in proximity will be a common feature 
of chipless RFID applications. Because the chipless tag is a fully passive device, 
it cannot control the reception and retransmission of the incoming interrogation 
signal. If the tag receives a signal, the retransmission or backscattering happens 
automatically. If there are multiple tags in the vicinity of a reader, all the tags will 
respond to the interrogation signal at the same time. The simultaneous responses of 
the tags introduce collisions in the tag-reader communication process. Therefore, 
reading multiple tags or implementation of anticollision algorithms should be done 
entirely in the reader without any assistance from the tag. A few anticollision tech­
niques for SAW chipless RFID tags have been reported on in [12, 40]. Anticollision 
techniques based on the signal strength of backscatterers, time separation, spatial 
separation, and code division based schemes are proposed in [12]. A linear block 
code based anticollision technique is proposed in [40] for RF-SAW tags. Azim and 
Karmakar [41] proposed an anticollision method for multiresonator based chipless 
RFID tags [24]. The technique uses a signal processing technique based on the frac­
tional Fourier transform (FrFT) to separate the frequency signatures of multiple 
tags. The SAR technique based reading methods also report multiple tag reading 
with high-end signal processing schemes [29, 31]. However, there is the demand­
ing requirement of implementing multiple tag reading in chipless RFID systems if 
they are to be used in real-world applications. A companion book, Chipless RFID 
Reader Signal Processing, by the lead author of this book presents a comprehensive 
literature review and proposed methods for anticollision, error correction, and data 
integrity for chipless RFID tags. 

3.5  Conclusion 
63
3.4.5  Orientation of the Tag
Readability of existing chipless RFID tags is sensitive to the orientation of the tag 
with respect to the reader. For example, the tags based on SAR principles [29, 31, 
32] should be kept in a way such that the tag backscatters the interrogating RF 
signal toward the reader device. Transmit and receive antennas should be polariza­
tion matched with the reader antennas to achieve proper operation of the chipless 
RFID tags [24]. The polarization diversity in tags is used to achieve a higher bit 
density in a smaller area as reported in [34, 42]. Proper reading of these tags is only 
achieved by means of a fixed orientation with the reader’s antennas. The reading of 
the retransmission chipless tag with two cross-polarized antennas requires a UWB 
RF pulse and is also sensitive to the reader antenna’s orientation [13]. None of these 
tags can scatter a signal toward the reader if the plane of the tag is kept in parallel 
to the direction of propagation of the interrogating RF signal. In general, almost 
all of the chipless RFID systems are sensitive to the orientation of the tag—without 
the proper orientation, it is challenging to achieve a proper reading. Therefore, a 
totally new set of chipless RFID tags and reader antennas need to be specified to 
have orientation-insensitive tag reading. Chapter 7 presents many aspects of an­
tenna design and propagation issues. The rest of the book provides information to 
overcome the identified limitations, at least up to a certain extent.
3.5  Conclusion
Chipless RFID is an emerging RFID technology that transforms the identification, 
asset tracking, security surveillance, anticounterfeiting, and many other sectors into 
lower cost solutions than conventional chipped RFID technology. The off-the-shelf 
RFID readers cannot be used with chipless RFID tags. The operation of the reader 
depends on the operating principle of the chipless tag. Therefore, different RFID 
tags require different reader systems.
This chapter presented a comprehensive review of the existing commercial and 
proof-of-concept prototype chipless RFID readers that have been reported on in 
the scientific literature. The review shows that the chipless RFID system is a com­
bination of several disciplines such as RF/microwave engineering, antenna engi­
neering, digital systems design, and digital signal processing. The interrogation is 
completely handled by the reader and the tag has no control over the communica­
tion process with the tag. In most of the chipless RFID systems, each and every 
component is tailored to the specific system. The review of reader architectures and 
reading techniques presented in this chapter and review of chipless tags presented 
in Chapter 2 will help build a foundation for understanding the rest of this book.

Frequency Domain Based RFID Reader 
Development 
4.1  Introduction
The preceding two chapters presented comprehensive reviews of chipless RFID tags 
and readers, respectively. The review of available and reported chipless RFID tran­
sponders presented in Chapter 2 has demonstrated the need for dedicated reader 
designs for different types of chipless RFID systems. Therefore, the multiresonator 
based chipless RFID tags need readers that are tailored to the operating principles 
and requirements of the particular system. As discussed in Chapters 2 and 3, the 
architectures and signal processing techniques of the chipless RFID tag readers need 
to be different according to the principles of operations.
In laboratory settings, test equipment such as vector network analyzers (VNAs), 
high-performance signal analyzers, high-speed digital storage oscilloscopes (DSO), 
and high-speed samplers are used. However, it is not economical to use these ex­
pensive and bulky laboratory pieces of equipment for the real-world applications 
of chipless RFID systems. Therefore, while trying to reduce the cost of the tags by 
using chipless RFID technologies, it is essential to develop low-cost reader devices 
that can lead to the realization of low-cost chipless RFID systems.
This chapter describes the design of two chipless RFID readers based on fre­
quency domain detection techniques. The frequency signature of the multiresona­
tor based chipless RFID tag can be detected using either frequency domain or time 
domain techniques. A reader design based on the time domain based reading tech­
nique will be presented in Chapter 5.
4.1.1  Organization of This Chapter
The organization of this chapter is summarized in Figure 4.1. The frequency do­
main based reader architectures presented in this chapter can be divided into two 
categories based on the data decoding technique:

Frequency Domain Based RFID Reader Development 
••
Identification of the features of frequency signatures;
••
Reconstruction (or recovering) of the frequency signature of a chipless RFID 
tag. 
Two reader designs based on the above two techniques are described in this 
chapter along with their operating principles.
The first technique, the identification of the features of frequency signatures, 
can be divided into two subcategories as shown in the Figure 4.1. In this method, 
data can be identified using the attenuations that occur in the amplitude and de­
viations of the phase from the linear variation (also known as phase jumps) of the 
received signals from the tags. Each piece of information could be used to identify 
the data encoded in chipless tags. However, by using both pieces of information, 
amplitude and phase, the reliability of the decoded data is greater than when using 
only either amplitude or phase.
The second tag reading technique discussed in this chapter that is based on the 
frequency domain involves reconstructing the amplitude and phase information of 
the frequency signature of the chipless tag. The reconstruction of the amplitude and 
phase information is done using the signal received from the chipless tags. Using 
signal processing techniques, it is possible to reconstruct both the amplitude and 
phase information of a frequency signature based chipless RFID tag.
The following sections present information about the operating principles, de­
sign, simulation, and experimental results of the two readers based on the two 
techniques shown in Figure 4.1.

4.2  Operation of Frequency Domain Based Chipless RFID Readers
Before going into the details of the operating principles and designs of the readers, 
a brief description of the multiresonator based chipless RFID tag is presented. This 
will help in understanding the operating principles of chipless RFID readers that are 
presented in detail in later sections of this chapter.
As explained in Chapter 2, the chipless tag is a fully passive microwave struc­
ture. An external source of electromagnetic signals is needed for the interrogation 
of the tag. When the tag is illuminated with a sufficiently wideband signal to cover 
all frequencies of the multiresonating structure, it creates a spectral signature. The 
reader converts the spectral signature of the tag into a series of binary data bits (1’s 
and 0’s). Figure 4.2 explains the operation of the tag. When the tag is illuminated 
with a wideband signal as shown in the figure, with the captured signal by the 
receive (Rx) antenna of the tag, resonators start resonating at the designed frequen­
cies and create attenuations in the designed frequency. In addition, phase jumps are 
also created at each resonating frequency. Here each resonator acts as a bandstop 
filter. Then this signal is retransmitted by the transmit (Tx) antenna of the tag. The 
presence of a resonator creates attenuation in the frequency spectrum and creates 
phase jumps, whereas the absence of a resonator does not create either attenuation 
or phase jumps.
As explained in previous chapters, as a response to the combined effects of the 
presence and absence of the bandstop filter (resonators), the resonant circuit cre­
ates a frequency signature in the received signal from the Rx antenna of the tag. 
Then the signal with frequency signatures is retransmitted with the transmit an­
tenna of the tag. The frequency signature can be controlled by varying the resonant 
frequencies and using different combinations of resonant frequencies.
If the response of the chipless tag in the frequency domain is H(f), then the 
amplitude response  A(f) and phase response φ(f) of an N-bit tag (if there are N 
number of resonators) can be expressed respectively as:

Using (4.1) and (4.2) it is possible to describe the frequency response (frequen­
cy signature) of any multiresonator based chipless RFID tag.
The detection of tags and decoding of data require identification of the attenu­
ations and phase jumps. The two types of readers discussed in this chapter decode 
data by analyzing the frequency signature in two different ways: 
••
Identification of the features of frequency signatures (type-1 readers): In 
this method, the reader’s RF section directly compares the signal transmit­
ted toward the tag and the signal received from the tag. A differential mi­
crowave gain/phase detector (GPD) processes the raw data in analog gain 
and phase data obtained from the tag. Based on the comparison of the two 
signals, attenuations and phase jumps are identified using a simple signal 
processing technique in the digital section of the reader. In this method, the 
identification of the attenuations and phase jumps is primarily an RF elec­
tronics (hardware) based process. The RF section outputs contain the gain 
and phase information of the detected tag and the microcontroller merely 
analyzes the outputs of the RF section. 
••
Reconstructing (or recovering) the frequency signature of the chipless RFID 
tag (type-2 readers): In this method, the frequency signature of the chipless 
RFID tag is reconstructed at the reader using the signal transmitted toward 
the tag and the signal received from the tag. The output of the RF section is 
captured and the Hilbert transform (HT) based signal processing technique 
is applied at the digital section of the reader to recover the frequency signa­
ture of the chipless tag being read. In this reader, the output of the RF section 
does not provide any amplitude or phase information for the tag. It outputs 
only a specific waveform. This waveform is processed with the HT signal 
processing technique and the amplitude and phase information of the tag is 
recovered at the digital section of the reader.  
In other words, one type of frequency domain based reader presented in this 
chapter detects the features of A(f) and φ(f), while the other reader reconstructs (or 
recovers) the functions A(f) and φ(f) using HT based signal processing techniques. 
The main difference between the two types of the readers is that in type-1 readers, 
the RF section output contains two separate gain and phase information signals, 
whereas the RF section output of type-2 readers does not provide such information 
and those two pieces of information should be recovered with signal processing 
techniques in the digital section.
The following sections describe the operating principles and the design of the 
readers in detail.

4.2.1  Detecting the Features of the Frequency Signatures of Chipless Tags: 
Type-1 Readers
 The operation of the first type of frequency domain based chipless RFID tag read­
ers is presented in this section. Here, the operating principle of the chipless reader is 
introduced with a functional block diagram of the process of detecting the features 
of the frequency signatures of chipless tags. Next the operation of the tag reader is 
explained by means of a component-level block diagram. The mathematical formu­
lation of the operating principle provides a deeper understanding of this tag reading 
process.
Generation of a Wideband Interrogation Signal
To extract encoded data from a chipless tag, the reader should transmit a suitable 
interrogation signal and receive the retransmitted signal from the tag. For the inter­
rogation signal, a signal should be generated with a sufficiently wide band to cover 
all resonating frequencies of the multiresonating circuit. Such a wideband signal 
can be generated using a VCO, as shown in Figure 4.3. A voltage ramp is applied 
as the tuning voltage over a certain period of time (T). The frequency output of the 
VCO varies over the T period of time from f1 to f2, generating a frequency sweep 
over f1 to f2 with a constant amplitude of wideband microwave power. This signal 
has a bandwidth  that can be used as the interrogation signal for reading chipless 
RFID tags. Since the DAC generates discrete voltage steps, the output of the VCO 
becomes a stepped frequency sweep. However, by applying very small voltage steps 
(in the millivolt range), the tuning voltage signal can be approximated into a lin­
ear voltage ramp. Therefore, the output of the VCO can be approximated into a 
continuous frequency sweep. Due to the finite settle-in time for generation of each 
frequency point of the VCOs, it is difficult to achieve very low chip durations (T). 
A sufficient period of time should be allowed per tuning voltage step to settle down 
the VCO for providing a stable frequency step. The settle-in time varies with the 
performance of the VCO. Faster VCOs are typically expensive, and cheaper ver­
sions require more time to settle down. Therefore, in the reader design process, we 
will be required to optimize between the cost and the performance of the VCO.
Process of Detecting the Features of Frequency Signatures:
To decode the encoded data on the chipless tags, we must identify the features of 
the frequency signatures (attenuations and phase jumps introduced by the multi­
resonating circuit). The identification of the features of the frequency signatures

Frequency Domain Based RFID Reader Development 
is done by using a GPD module. The functional block diagram of the process is 
shown in Figure 4.4. The received signal from the tag and the transmitted signal 
are compared with each other as shown in Figure 4.4; the differences in amplitude 
and gain between the transmitted and received signals can be identified in a GPD. 
The AD8302 GPD is such a module [1], and it is commercially available. At attenu­
ated frequencies, gain and phase information gives peak values for the DC voltage 
outputs of the GPD. Since the resonance frequencies are known, by observing the 
peaks, bit 0 can be identified. If there is no peak of gain information or phase in­
formation voltage, that can be identified as bit 1. Because this reading process only 
identifies the attenuations and phase jumps of the frequency signatures, the process 
can be referred to as “detecting the features of frequency signatures.” Decoding of 
data is done by analyzing the shape of the gain and phase information output sig­
nals of the GPD. The output waveforms are sampled with an ADC and stored in the 
memory of the digital control section. Then the data are processed and converted 
into digital binary data.
Block diagram of the reader that detects features of frequency signatures:  This 
section provides an in-depth description of the operation of the RFID reader that 
detects the features of chipless tags with the aid of equations. The component-level 
block diagram of the reader is shown in Figure 4.5.

From (4.12) and (4.13), it can be observed that the frequencies of the two 
signals are the same. However, there are differences in amplitude and total phase 
angle. The two signals are fed into the two inputs of GPD to detect the amplitude 
and phase differences.

The Operation of the AD8302 Gain Phase Detector
 The functional block diagram of the AD8302 GPD is shown in Figure 4.6. The two 
inputs to the GPD are amplified with two 60-dB logarithmic amplifiers as shown 
in the block diagram. Then the outputs of the two amplifiers are passed through 
a voltage summing circuit to obtain the difference of the two output signals. The 
output of the summing circuit is amplified further to scale up into the range of 0V 
to 1.8V. Similarly, to extract the phase difference of the two signals, they are passed 
through a phase detector as shown in the block diagram. The output of the phase 
detector is amplified again to match the output range of 0V to 1.8V with an ampli­
fier. The AD8302 GPD allows offset values to be set to the magnitude information 
output (Vamp) and phase information output (Vphase) signals. However, in this 
application, setting an offset value to the magnitude and phase information outputs 
is not required and that feature is not used. 
The operation of the GPD can be expressed with two equations as shown in 
(4.14) and (4.15) according to the block diagram shown in Figure 4.6. The two 
outputs of the GPD, gain information and phase information voltages are defined 
as [1]:

where kAMP = kIF/kREF.
Expressions (4.16) and (4.17) shows that the outputs of the GPD vary accord­
ing to the amplitude and phase differences of the two input signals. The two volt­
ages are sampled and processed in the digital section to identify the resonant fre­
quencies of the tag by comparing them with a calibration (reference) measurement. 
Because the two output voltages show variations in amplitude and phase informa­
tion outputs, according to the resonances that occur in the tag, this tag reading 
technique can be identified as extracting the features of the frequency signatures.
The equations were derived assuming that there are no reflections from the sur­
rounding environment and no leakages of the transmitted signal to the receiver sec­
tions. However, in practice, a calibration tag without resonators is used to remove 
reflections that occur due to the surrounding environment and leakages of trans­
mitted signal to the receiver section. Therefore, a calibration measurement is used 
to achieve more accurate results and better performance from the reading process.
4.2.2  Recovering the Frequency Signature of Chipless Tags: Type-2 Readers
The operation of the second type of the frequency domain based chipless RFID 
reader presented in this chapter is explained here. The reader reconstructs the fre­
quency signature of the chipless RFID tag with the aid of the received signal from 
the tag and the transmitted signal from the reader. The detailed description of the 
tag reading process is explained here.
Figure 4.7 shows the block diagram of the frequency domain based reader that 
recovers the frequency signature of chipless tags. It wirelessly recovers the ampli­
tude and phase functions of the chipless tag consisting of bandstop filters. The RF 
transceiver (Tx/Rx) section provides the basic function to recover the frequency 
signature of the tags being read. A coherent detection is achieved with a bi-static 
FMCW radar architecture with two Tx and Rx antennas. The digital section as­
sisted with a DAC, drives the VCO, controls the overall operation of the reader and 
performs signal processing of the re-transmitted signal from the chipless tag. Fol­
lowing is the detailed discussion of the different blocks of the reader. The operation 
of the reader is explained with the use of mathematical derivations.
RF section:  A linear RF chirp signal is used as the interrogation signal in this reader. 
A sawtooth waveform generator [3, 4] and a VCO generate the linear RF chirp 
signal. The bandwidth of the swept frequency depends on the specification of the 
VCO operating bandwidth of the chipless tag. The reader described here is designed 
with a VCO that operates in the 4- to 8-GHz frequency band.
The instantaneous frequency of the linear chirp interrogation signal can be 
expressed as [3]:

The signal propagation and the free-space path loss profile of the tag–reader 
system is shown in Figure 4.8. As mentioned earlier, it is assumed that the antenna 
is a linear device and, therefore, there are no phase and amplitude distortions at 
the Tx and Rx antennas of the reader and the tag. A constant path loss over the 
operating frequency range [2, 5] is Ltotal and the time delay introduced by the tag

Due to practical limitations such as the high-chirp bandwidth and the required 
settle-in time for the VCO to stabilize the frequency output between the steps of 
the frequency sweep, it is difficult to achieve very short chirp durations. Although, 
it can be seen that the frequency of the output signal varies with the parameters: 
Tchirp, τ1, and BW. The chirp duration Tchirp is the main parameter that determines 
the frequency of Ytag(t). Therefore, the frequency of the signal Ytag(t) gets very low 
values in practice and depends more on Tchirp than on τ1 and BW.
Since the Ytag(t) contains the information about the frequency signature (phase 
and amplitude information) of the chipless RFID tag, by analyzing the Ytag(t), the 
two functions A(f) and φ(f) can be recovered to identify the data bits encoded in 
the chipless RFID tag.
Recovering the amplitude and phase responses of the chipless tag using Hil­
bert transform: Hilbert transform based complex analytical signal representation is 
used to extract the frequency signatures of chipless tags. Using the HT, it is possible 
to reconstruct both amplitude and phase responses of the chipless tags.
Any real signal that can be expressed as the sum of a series of sinusoids, a 
transform can be applied to shift each sinusoidal component in phase by (π/2). This 
transform is called the Hilbert transform [6]. Assume that x(t) is a real signal and 
the HT output y(t) can be denoted as . The signal z(t) is then called the complex 
analytical signal of x(t) and it can be expressed as [6, 7]:

The first two terms of (4.35) show a linear variation of phase with time with a 
constant phase shift of 2πf+τ1 due to the time taken by the signal to travel from the 
Tx antenna of the reader through the tag and be received by the Rx antenna of the 
reader as shown in Figure 4.8. The third term of (4.35) is easily identifiable as the 
phase information, φ(f′) of the frequency signature of the chipless tag.
In summary, by applying HT to the output of the RF section, we can recon­
struct the frequency signature. Using this information it is possible to identify the 
bits encoded in a chipless tag.
4.3  Design of Frequency Domain Based Chipless RFID Readers
This section covers the design of two major subsections of the readers, the RF sec­
tion and the digital section. The RF and digital sections consist of a number of ac­
tive and passive components. A detailed description of each component used in the 
readers is presented in Chapter 8. In this section, the emphasis is on the system-level 
design of each subsection of the reader.
4.3.1  Design of a Reader That Detects the Features of Frequency Signatures of 
Chipless RFID Tags
The design of the reader is done in two parts, the RF section and the digital section. 
The two sections are made on two separate PCB modules that can be plugged into 
a metallic housing. The fabricated reader is shown in Figure 4.9. The RF section is 
mounted on top of the digital section using two connectors. The reason for design­
ing two PCBs is the operating frequency ranges of the two sections. The RF section

operates over a wide frequency band of 4 GHz (4 to 8 GHz). However, the digi­
tal section and other associated components work up to the maximum frequency 
range of 20 MHz. Because of the wide frequency bandwidth of operation of the 
RF section, a high-performance PCB substrate is required to achieve the desired 
performance. Taconic TLX-0, 0.5-mm-thick high-performance RF substrate is used 
in the RF PCB design. It is possible to use the same PCB substrate for the digital 
section and power supply unit. However, the high-performance PCB substrate is 
very expensive. It is not economical to use a single PCB for the whole reader design. 
Therefore, the digital section is designed on an FR-4 substrate, which provides a 
more economical solution for the PCB design. 
The digital control section controls the entire operation of the reader, and the 
operation can be divided into three functions: (1) transmitter control, (2) receiver 
control, and (3) signal processing and data decoding. The digital control section 
is designed to use a reader for tags with different numbers of bits without chang­
ing its hardware configuration. To generate a frequency sweep, a voltage ramp is 
generated using an MCP4912 digital-to-analog converter (DAC). According to the 
specifications of the VCO, to operate in the frequency range of 4 to 8 GHz, the 
voltage ramp applied to the tuning voltage should be between 0V and 20V. The 
generation of the tuning voltage is achieved by changing the output of the DAC 
with 1024 steps, which gives 1.96-MHz (2 GHz/1024) resolution per input tuning 
voltage step, with a DAC.
For sampling the gain and phase voltages, the built-in 10-bit analog-to-digital 
controller of a PIC 18F452 microcontroller running at 20-MHz clock speed is used. 
It has an 8-to-1 built-in analog multiplexer, which can be used to sample multiple 
analog voltages if multiple RF sections are connected to the same digital controller. 
According to the data sheet of the AD8302 GPD, gain and phase outputs vary be­
tween 30 mV/dB and 10 mV/deg, respectively. Since the two analog outputs of the 
GPD vary between 0V  and 1.8V, the reference voltage of the ADC was set to 1.8V, 
which gives 1.77-mV (1.8V/1024) resolution and provides adequate resolution for 
sampling the two analog voltages. The sampled data are stored in a 32-kbyte RAM 
chip and addressing of the RAM is done using a 15-bit binary counter driven by a 
microcontroller pin. Although the use of a counter to address the RAM increases 
the access time, it reduces the number of utilized pins of the microcontroller so that 
a low-cost microcontroller can be used in the design. An RS-232 interface is added 
to the design for communicating with a PC, as shown earlier in Figure 4.5.
The procedure and sequence of operation explained in the previous section was 
implemented on a PIC 18F452 microcontroller. Specifications of the PIC 18F452 
microcontroller can be found in its data sheet. C language was used to develop the 
firmware for the microcontroller. The flowchart of the whole controlling algorithm 
and data decoding algorithm is shown in Figure 4.10.
4.3.2  Design of a Reader That Recovers the Frequency Signatures of Chipless 
RFID Tags
The design of this reader is also done in two parts: as the RF section and the digital 
section. The RF section of the reader architecture was realized on Taconic TLX-0 
(ε = 2.45, tan δ = 0.02, h = 0.5 mm) high-performance RF substrate. The digital 
section was realized on low-cost FR-4 PCB substrate. The two sections are made on

Frequency Domain Based RFID Reader Development 
two separate PCBs that can be plugged in together, similar to the previous one, to 
minimize the cost of the expensive PCB substrate. The fabricated reader is shown 
in Figure 4.11. The reader is designed to operate in the frequency range of 4.0 to 
8.0 GHz, and all components were chosen to operate in this frequency range. A 
Richardson RVCSD6000F wideband VCO [tuning bandwidth = 4 to 8 GHz, tuning 
sensitivity (fairly constant) = 200 MHz/V, output power = 10 dBm, phase noise at 
1 MHz offset = -80 dBc/Hz] is used in the reader design as the signal source. The 
VCO operates in the frequency band of 4 to 8 GHz. A -15-dB asymmetric coupled 
line coupler was realized on the same RF PCB section. Surface-mount LPFs with a 
cut-off frequency of 600 MHz and a Mini-Circuit SIM-14+ double balanced mixer 
are used to construct the reader along with other parts. A noninverting amplifier is 
used at the output of the RF section, and the amplified output is interfaced with the 
digital control section.
The output of the RF section Ytag(t), is sampled with the internal ADC of the 
PIC 18F452 microcontroller, and the sampled signal is sent to a computer for fur­
ther processing with Matlab for extracting the frequency signature. In this work, 
Matlab is used since it is more flexible and easier than using a microprocessor or 
FPGA based signal processing algorithms with an experimental setup. However, 
the necessary signal processing can be easily done at the reader by using a micro­
processor or an FPGA once the signal processing algorithms have been finalized 
and fine tuned to suit the application. The different components and units in the 
RF and digital section require different voltage levels. Therefore, a power supply 
section is also included in a part of the digital section PCB.
As shown earlier in Figure 4.7, the digital section consists of an ADC, a DAC, 
a digital control section, and an FPGA or a microcontroller. The frequency of the 
output signal from the RF section Ytag(t) depends on the parameters Tchirp, τ1 and 
BW of the interrogation signal. Due to the settle-in time required for the VCO, 
it is difficult to achieve very high speed frequency sweeps. Further, the value of 
Tchirp can be controlled by the digital section. Since, the frequency of Ytag(t) mainly 
depends on the parameter Tchirp, it is possible to achieve 2-GHz frequency sweeps 
with 5-MHz frequency steps in 500 ms using a VCO with average performance.

Therefore, the output of the RF section generates very low frequency outputs. 
Therefore, a very low sampling rate is used in the ADC in the digital processing 
of the reader. A microprocessor or an FPGA can be used to control the ADC and 
DAC and to carry out the signal processing of the reader [8, 9]. Decoded data can 
be transferred to a PC using a serial or parallel interface or displayed on the LCD 
screen of the reader.
The flowchart of the firmware of the digital control section that performs the 
detection and display of data is shown in Figure 4.12. The number of samples to 
be acquired over the frequency span of the linear chirp is set at first. The output 
of the RF section, Ytag(t), is progressively sampled N times and stored after gener­
ating the chirp signal. Next, the HT of the stored data is carried out followed by 
the computation of the analytical signal ztag(t). The computed complex analytical 
signal represents the amplitude and phase response of the chipless tag. Using the 
two pieces of information contained in the complex analytical signal, attenuations 
and phase jumps are identified to decode the encoded data on the tag. The decoded

data are finally transferred to a PC or displayed on the LCD screen of the reader. 
The control and signal processing algorithm can be implemented in the form of the 
firmware of a microprocessor or an FPGA [8, 9].
4.4  Results
Here, the results of the two frequency domain based readers are presented. The 
results presented in this section are obtained using the fabricated prototypes of the 
two types of readers. The results presented in this section show the functionality of 
the readers and how the data bits are decoded from the outputs obtained from the 
RF sections of the readers. To prove the operation of the reader, 9-bit multiresona­
tor based chipless RFID prototype tags with 9 bits encoded were tested with the 
reader. The tested tags were realized on Taconic TLX-0 substrate (ε = 2.45, tanδ = 
0.0019, h = 0.7874 mm). The operating frequency range of the tags is 4 to 6 GHz. 
The measured resonant frequencies of the multiresonator based chipless RFID tags 
used for the experiments are listed in Table 4.1. The measurements were recorded 
using an Agilent E8361A performance network analyzer (PNA).
4.4.1  Results: Detecting the Features of Frequency Signatures
Figure 4.13 shows the measured results of reading two 9-bit chipless RFID tags. 
The sampled gain voltages give a local minimum point with respect to the adjacent 
areas when a resonance occurs in the multiresonating circuit. Figure 4.13(a) shows 
nine saddle points in the amplitude information, and Figure 4.13(b) shows nine 
phase ripples of the phase information for the tag with encoded data “000000000.” 
The difference between the calibration tag (tag with data “111111111” or with 
no resonators) gives clear peaks in amplitude as shown in Figure 4.13(a), which 
make easier to identify the resonances. This information can be easily converted 
into binary data bits. However, the difference of phase information of the two tags 
does not provide a distinguishable signal that can be used to identify the resonance

seen that these two pieces of information (amplitude and phase) can be extracted 
using the reader and they can be used to identify the data encoded in any multireso­
nator based chipless RFID tag. From the results, it is clear that the reader identifies 
the resonance frequencies by extracting the differences that occur in amplitude and 
phase information generated by the GPD.
Reading and decoding time takes about 1 second per tag. The reason for taking 
such a long time per reading is that, when generating the voltage ramp to obtain 
the frequency sweep, a 1-ms time period should be allowed to obtain a stable fre­
quency output from the VCO. If the bandwidth is increased, it will take more time 
because more frequency steps will be generated. However, it is possible to reduce 
the reading time by only sweeping through the frequencies where resonances occur 
for a chipless tag with known resonance frequencies. Data processing time is very 
much shorter than the frequency sweep time. Therefore, to increase the tag reading 
speed, a faster frequency sweep should be used or a different technique is required. 
A time domain based faster tag reading technique is presented in Chapter 5.
4.4.2  Results: Recovering the Frequency Signature of Chipless RFID Tags
The results of the tag readings done with the built reader prototype that recon­
structs the frequency signature of chipless RFID tags are presented in this section. 
The same tags that have 9 encoded bits (operating in the 4- to 6-GHz frequency 
range) were used with this reader. Since the tags operate only in the 4- to 6-GHz 
frequency band, the tuning voltage for the VCO was generated using the DAC of 
the digital section only to sweep the frequency from 3.9 to 6.1 GHz (2.2 GHz BW). 
A 5-MHz frequency step was used and the chirp duration Tchirp was 500 ms.
The computed envelope of the signal Ytag(t) and the measured output signal 
of the RF section, Ytag(t), are shown in Figure 4.14. Figure 4.14(a) shows the am­
plitude response of the tag as expected with proper attenuations according to the 
resonators of the chipless tag. The calculated phase angle of the tag signal Ytag(t) 
shows clear phase ripples (varying from 5° to 20°) at their corresponding resona­
tors of the chipless tag. The phase ripples are highlighted in Figure 4.15(b). These 
two plots of the measured results show that the reader reconstructs both the ampli­
tude and phase responses of the frequency signature of the chipless tags. Using the 
reconstructed amplitude and phase responses, it is possible to develop an algorithm 
that detects the saddle points in the amplitude response and discontinuities in the 
gradient profile of the phase response. Using the amplitude and phase information, 
the tag is decoded as “000000000” and “010101010.”
4.5  Conclusion
Two designs for low-cost frequency domain based readers for reading multiresona­
tor based chipless RFID tags were presented. The two readers work on two different 
operating principles. A type-1 reader detects the features of the frequency signatures 
of chipless tags, whereas a type-2 reader reconstructs the frequency signatures using 
the received signals.
The reader that detects the features of frequency signatures uses two VCOs in 
the RF section. The two VCOs were driven in such a way as to keep a constant

frequency difference between the two outputs using the tuning voltages generated 
by the DAC in the digital section. Using this VCO driving technique, it was possible 
to achieve a constant IF over the entire operating frequency range of the reader. A 
GPD was used to compare the transmitted and received signals to identify the at­
tenuations and phase ripples generated by the resonators of the chipless RFID tag. 
The reader prototype presented in this work operates in the 4- to 8-GHz frequency 
range.
The type-2 reader, which reconstructs the frequency signature of chipless tags, 
needs only one VCO, which is the most expensive component in the reader system.

Frequency Domain Based RFID Reader Development 
Mixing of the transmitted signal with the received signal and chirped interrogation 
signal relinquishes the requirement for the second VCO as a variable local oscil­
lator. A compact, less expensive, and simpler RF section is also achieved in type-2 
readers compared to type-1 readers, which have two VCOs. Moreover, the type-2 
reader does not use a calibration tag to decode data. This is another advantage of 
this reader. The simple signal processing algorithm based on HT provides for the 
extraction of the amplitude and phase functions of the frequency signature of the 
chipless RFID tag.
Both theoretical analysis and experimental validation were carried out to vali­
date the operation of the two readers. The accurate detection of a 9-bit chipless 
RFID tag using both amplitude and phase information was achieved with both 
types of readers.
The concept of the reader with a single antenna and a single VCO is proposed 
for achieving a more compact and less expensive reader device. In that reader, the 
same antenna is used for the communication and the VCO is used as the signal 
source. The receiver section contains a detector and filter network followed by a 
microprocessor-assisted signal processing unit.
Future development will concentrate on reducing the cost and enhancing the 
compactness of the reader and improving the reading range and reading speed of 
the reader. The operating bandwidth of the reader is determined only by the operat­
ing frequency bandwidths of the components used in the design. By using compo­
nents that can be operated in wider frequency bandwidths, the operating frequency 
bandwidth of the reader can be further expanded.
The frequency domain based tag reading techniques consume a considerable 
amount of time to generate a suitable interrogation signal, and subsequent signal 
processing methods are needed for the detection process. This limits the usability 
of the frequency domain based readers in applications that require high-speed tag 
reading. Therefore, to reduce the tag reading time and enable high-speed tag read­
ing, a time domain based chipless RFID reader is proposed in Chapter 5.

Time Domain Based Chipless RFID Reader
5.1  Introduction
This chapter presents the operating principle for a time domain (TD) based chipless 
RFID reader. The frequency signature of a chipless tag is identified using a short ul­
tra-wideband (UWB) RF pulse as the interrogation signal and a TD based detection 
technique. The received TD signal from the tag can be directly processed with a fast 
Fourier transform (FFT) based signal processing technique to obtain the frequency 
signature of the tag. However, direct processing of the received signal requires high-
performance analog and digital hardware. This greatly increases the cost of the 
reader. In this chapter, a simple and low-cost TD based reader receiver architec­
ture, which comprises a low noise amplifier (LNA), a 1-to-n-way-power divider, 
narrow bandpass filters (BPFs), envelope detectors, and comparators, is proposed. 
The reader yields high-speed reading capability. The proposed reader architecture 
is augmented with theory, design, simulation, and performance benchmark results.
The previous chapter dealt with the design of two types of chipless RFID read­
ers using frequency domain (FD) reading techniques. The two FD readers operate 
over the UWB frequency band. The readers extract the frequency signatures of a 
chipless RFID tag fully within the FD. In the FD reading method, a few issues hin­
der high-speed reading: (1) the settling time and linearity of the VCO output, (2) 
the number of frequency points required to determine the frequency signatures, (3) 
the sampling rate, (4) the synchronization of VCO driving signals with sampling of 
the received signals, (5) the nonlinearity of other active and passive components, 
(6) the transmitted power, and (7) the number of data bits to be extracted.
An alternate approach to improve reading performance and speed is a TD 
based impulse radio (IR) technique. In a TD-IR based reader, a short RF pulse 
that spreads the spectral contents (real power) over the UWB frequency band is 
transmitted. The result is that a very fast reading speed is achieved via the UWB-IR 
based reader. In traditional TD based analytical techniques, the waveforms of time-
varying signals at various stages of a system are captured to examine the perfor­
mance of the system. In the proposed reading method, the time-varying waveforms 
and their representative frequency domain spectral contents will be examined at 
each important stage of the reader. This anatomical approach to the processed

signal of a frequency signature based chipless tag interrogated with a time domain 
impulse will create a unique discipline. 
As stated above, the tag reading speed of a FD based reader is limited by vari­
ous factors. The UWB FD chipless tag may operate in a very wide frequency band 
from 3.1 to 10.6 GHz1. It is difficult to generate a very high speed interrogation 
signal with a sufficient number of frequency steps to interrogate a chipless tag with 
a wideband VCO. With the operating frequency bandwidth and the number of 
frequency points generated by the VCO, the required settling time for stable fre­
quency outputs increases the tag reading time. As an example, our current reading 
time for a 9-bit chipless tag is approximately a few seconds. To increase the tag 
reading speed, use of a high-performance VCO with a low settling time is envis­
aged. However, this solution would increase the cost of the reader. Therefore, it is 
imperative to investigate alternative options that generate interrogation signals that 
have very high reading speeds and cover the required operational bandwidth. 
In UWB communication systems, short RF pulses are used as transmitting sig­
nals. These short RF pulses have a several gigahertz operational bandwidth. The 
typical width of a single UWB RF pulse is less than 10 ns. Therefore, the use of 
a short RF pulse as the interrogation signal opens up a new discipline to achieve 
high-speed reading of chipless RFID tags. Figure 5.1 shows a comparative study 
of frequency and time domain reading techniques and the advantages of TD based 
reading techniques over FD based reading techniques. As shown in the figure, the 
TD based reader enjoys the unique advantages of short transmission times and a 
simple architecture. 
Chapter 3 gives a detailed description of the design and operation of a com­
mercial TD based SAW chipless RFID tag reader. In addition to the SAW RFID tag 
reader, there are a few TD based chipless tag reading techniques reported in the sci­
entific literature. However, they are still in the inception phase with only laboratory 
prototypes reported. A comprehensive review of recently reported works on UWB-
IR based chipless RFID tag reading systems is given below. This review exposes 
the significance of the proposed reading technique described in this chapter. As 
mentioned in Chapter 3, to the authors’ best knowledge there is no reported UWB-
IR based commercial chipless RFID system except for the RF-SAW. Therefore, this 
chapter presents a fundamental concept in the field of chipless RFID tag readers.
TD based chipless RFID systems [1–6] use UWB short pulses as the interroga­
tion signals. The transmitter of the reader comprises a UWB impulse generator 
that generates a short RF pulse. The width of the RF pulse is in the range of a few 
hundred picoseconds to a few nanoseconds [4, 5] based on required specifications. 
Most of the TD-based chipless RFID tags [2, 4, 5] are based on the principle of time 
domain reflectometry (TDR). The reader’s receiver decodes the encoded data bits in 
a chipless RFID tag in the TD. The receiver block contains a high-speed sampling 
device. The reported experimental work has been carried out using either a PC 
based high-speed sampler [4] or a high-speed digital storage oscilloscope (DSO) 
[1, 5]. The sampled signal is processed with different signal processing techniques, 
described as follows.
Lazaro et al. [4] used a continuous wavelet based signal processing technique 
to detect a chipless RFID tag based on TDR. A time coded tag with a terminated

transmission line is used in this experiment. Hu et al. [5] analyzed the antenna 
mode scattering for a UWB pulse of the tag. The tag has a simple passive structure 
with one antenna and a terminated transmission line. Kalansuriya and Karmakar 
[2] proposed a different tag design with a multiple spiral resonator loaded trans­
mission line and a UWB monopole antenna. They use a technique similar to that 
proposed in [5] to identify the signature of the tag. Another TDR based chipless tag 
is reported by Zheng et al. [3]. A transmission line with capacitive discontinuities is 
used to encode the data. By analyzing the reflected signal recorded with high-speed 
DSO, the bits are identified [3]. A pulse position modulation (PPM) based UWB 
chipless RFID tag has been proposed by Gupta et al. [1]. The chipless tag contains 
two cross-polarized antennas as the receiving (Rx) and transmitting (Tx) antennas. 
A dispersive delay structure (DDS) is used to obtain different group delays for dif­
ferent frequencies. The retransmitted pulses are recorded with a high-speed DSO 
and analyzed to obtain the encoded data [1]. The use of these types of expensive 
laboratory equipment does not suit commercial applications. A commercial-grade 
reader needs to have a low-cost design if it is to meet market demands. So far no 
integrated chipless RFID reader architecture has been proposed in the open litera­
ture. Therefore, there is room for further development of a TD based reader in an 
integrated package. This chapter highlights some of the practical issues of a TD-
based chipless tag reader.
The FD chipless RFID tag uses a frequency signature to store data bits in a 
fully passive microwave structure. The chapter has adopted a TD based technique

to interrogate the FD chipless tag with a UWB-IR signal. The TD based receiver 
decodes the frequency signature of the tag into meaningful ID information.
The chapter is organized as follows. First, various techniques for generating 
UWB short RF pulses are described. Then the operating principle of the TD based 
chipless RFID system is presented. The whole tag and reader system is designed on 
an Agilent ADS 2009 platform. A simulation is performed to examine the perfor­
mance of the reader. Practical implementation issues, including the availability of 
components to develop a commercial-grade reader, are presented. Finally, results 
are discussed and conclusions drawn.
5.2  Theory of Operation of a Time Domain Based Chipless RFID Reader 
The operation of a TD based chipless RFID reader is described in this section. The 
reader can be divided into two main functional units. The first functional unit is 
the UWB short RF pulse generator. Because the short RF pulse is used as the inter­
rogation signal, it is important to understand the operation of the impulse signal 
generation. The second functional unit comprises the receiver and a data decoding 
section. The operation of the reader is described in this section based on these two 
main functional units.
5.2.1  Generation of UWB Short Pulses
Figure 5.2 shows the two common types of UWB short pulse generators in UWB 
communication systems [7]. The two commonly used techniques are:
••
Use of a pulse generator and an up-converter ;
••
Use of a short pulse generator and a pulse shaping circuit. 
The two pulse generation techniques are described here in detail.
5.2.1.1  UWB Short RF Pulse Generation Using a Pulse Generator and an Up-
Converter
In this method, a UWB short pulse is generated by mixing a baseband pulse with 
a microwave frequency signal. A local oscillator (LO) generates the microwave

frequency signal that lies in the UWB frequency band [7]. A mixer up-converts the 
pulse with the LO signal. The up-converted pulse passes through a bandpass filter 
(BPF). The block diagram of the UWB pulse generation circuit is shown in Figure 
5.3. As shown in the figure, control signals are used to control the pulse generator 
as well as the LO. Usually a digitally controllable pulse generator is used to allow 
binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) and other types of modulation on the pulse.
Note that the bandwidth of the generated pulse is around 550 MHz. To cover 
the entire UWB frequency band from 3.1 to 10.6 GHz, the output of the pulse gen­
erator is up-converted with a signal generated by a tunable LO in a mixer. The LO 
provides a continuous RF signal centered at discrete frequencies within the UWB 
frequency band. The output of the mixer is an up-converted version of a short RF 
pulse covering the entire UWB frequency band. The frequency spectrum of the RF 
pulse is centered at the LO frequency, which lies inside the UWB frequency band 
[7]. Figure 5.4 shows the schematic diagram of the impulse generating circuit. As 
can be seen, this method of UWB short pulse generation is complex due to the 
number of modules. In addition to the complexity of the circuitry, this method 
consumes significant power for the operation. However, the main advantage of this 
method is that the frequency spectrum of the output UWB short pulse is more easi­
ly controllable compared to the other technique, which is described in next section.

5.2.1.2  UWB Short RF Pulse Generation with a Short Pulse Generator and Pulse 
Shaping Circuit
A short pulse generator is used to directly generate RF pulses that have frequency 
spectra lying in the UWB frequency band. A block diagram of this UWB short RF 
pulse generation is shown in Figure 5.5. As shown in the figure, the output of the 
pulse generation circuit is sent through a delay line directly to an AND or XOR 
gate. Due to the time delay caused by the pulse transmitted through the delay line, 
the output of the gate becomes a narrow pulse as shown in Figure 5.5. Then this 
narrow pulse is sent through pulse shaping circuitry to meet the spectral require­
ments of the UWB frequency band [8, 9].
The short pulse generator with a pulse shaping circuit is less complex than the 
previous technique. The use of typical digital logic gate building blocks makes this 
technique very popular when designing chips for UWB applications [8–11]. The 
use of standard CMOS designs and manufacturing processes makes this type of 
UWB short RF pulse generation technique more economical as well. Figure 5.6 
shows the schematic diagram of the impulse generator with a pulse shaping circuit.
UWB pulse generation circuits that are made using some lumped components 
have been reported [12–14]. The operation of the pulse generation circuit is still 
the same as that shown in Figure 5.6. The only difference is that they do not use 
digital logic blocks for generating narrow pulses. Instead of digital building blocks, 
they use typical diodes or RF transistors that operate over microwave frequency 
bands to generate narrow pulses. In addition to the UWB pulse generators, the 
circuitry for pulse shaping and signal subtraction is required to generate a very nar­
row pulse. This is done using a reflective network consisting of shorted stubs. The

length of the shorted stub is designed to provide enough delay to generate a very 
narrow output pulse as described in [12, 13].
Some reports have been made of pulse generators that can be tuned to obtain 
different pulse widths [15–17]. They are considered when tunable pulse generation 
circuits are needed in some special applications. However, obtaining the required 
center frequency of the UWB pulse spectrum is more difficult than in the previous 
type of pulse generators. The fact that the process for setting the center frequency is 
less flexible. This is the major disadvantage of this class of pulse generators. There­
fore, these types of impulse generators are not considered here.
5.2.1.3  Laboratory Equipment Used to Generate UWB Short Pulses
Arbitrary signal generators with various pulse shapes in a tunable bandwidth are 
used for various time domain experiments in laboratory settings. For such applica­
tions there are ranges of laboratory equipment that can be used according to proj­
ect requirements. In such applications the pulse generators presented above may 
not offer enough flexibility in project development and experimentation. However, 
both pulse and arbitrary waveform generators are used in laboratory settings. Some 
commercially available pulse and arbitrary waveform generators that are used for 
laboratory testing of time domain project development and experimentation are 
described next. 
Pulse Generators
There are a range of commercially available pulse generators. All of them provide 
flexibility in terms of setting the pulse width, rise and fall times, amplitudes, and the 
shapes of pulses. The Picosecond pulse generator [18] is popular equipment that is 
used to generate short RF pulses for UWB applications. Agilent [19] and Quantum 
Composers [20] also provide a range of pulse generators with flexible pulse genera­
tion capability.
Arbitrary Waveform Generators
An arbitrary waveform generator is another piece of equipment that can be used 
to generate UWB pulses. It is possible to feed in data points from a text file into an 
arbitrary waveform generator. One possible use is to generate the shape of a UWB 
pulse that has the required width and bandwidth using a software tool such as 
Matlab and then record the data points on a text file and feed it into the waveform 
generator. Some versions of the arbitrary waveform generators provide predefined 
shapes of waveforms such as Gaussian pulses. By changing the associated param­
eters of the waveform, it is possible to generate UWB short RF pulses. LeCroy’s 
ArbStudio [21], Agilent’s series of arbitrary waveform generators [22], and Tektro­
nix’s AWG7000 series [23] are popular and are commonly used in laboratory ex­
periments. Although these pieces of laboratory equipment provide much flexibility 
in setting the properties of a pulse such as pulse width, amplitude, and bandwidth, 
they are bulky and expensive. Therefore, they are not suitable for low-cost com­
mercial applications.
Several specific mathematical functions such as Gaussian [24] , truncated sine, 
and shifted sinc [24, 25] have wide frequency spectra that can be used to generate 

100 
��������������������������������������
Time Domain Based Chipless RFID Reader
wideband signals. Gaussian pulses are easier to generate using electronics than 
truncated sine and shifted sinc waveforms [24]. Therefore, a Gaussian function and 
its derivatives are widely used waveforms in short pulse UWB applications [26]. 
The expression of the waveform is given in (5.1) [25]:

time domain waveform and frequency spectrum of a Gaussian modulated sine wave 
are shown in Figure 5.7.
The waveform shown in Figure 5.7 is a 4-GHz sinusoidal signal modulated as 
a Gaussian pulse with s = 0.6 and µ = 0.5 ns. As shown in Figure 5.7(b), it has a 
40% 3-dB and 60% 10-dB bandwidth. The frequency spectrum is centered at 4 
GHz as shown in the figure. It shows the possibility of generating wideband signals 
with derivatives of Gaussian pulses. The next section presents the architecture and 
operation of the receiver and data decoding unit.
5.2.2  UWB Short Pulse Based Interrogation
As mentioned in previous chapters, the multiresonator based chipless RFID tag 
can be modeled as a block of cascaded narrowband bandstop filters attached to 
two orthogonally polarized Tx and Rx antennas [27]. The Tx and Rx antennas 
are oriented in the orthogonal polarization to minimize the coupling between the 
two antennas. The reader antennas are also oriented in orthogonal polarization to 
maximize the transmitted and received signals to and from the tag, respectively. 
The UWB short RF pulse is transmitted via the reader’s Tx antenna toward 
the chipless RFID tag. The Rx antenna of the chipless tag captures the transmitted 
signal, and it passes through the multiresonator circuit. Next, the signal reaches the 
Tx antenna of the chipless tag and reradiates. The reradiated pulse is captured by 
the reader’s Rx antenna. This whole process of signal flow from the transmitter to 
the receiver via the multiresonator based chipless RFID tag is shown in Figure 5.8.

5.2  Theory of Operation of a Time Domain Based Chipless RFID Reader  
101
The signal captured by the Rx antenna of the reader is processed in the reader’s 
receiver to identify the frequency signature of the chipless RFID tags. Two process­
ing methods can be used to process the captured signal from the chipless RFID 
tag. The first method is based on a digital signal processing technique. The second 
method is based on microwave channelized receiver architecture. The operating 
principles and the design of the two methods are described in following sections.
5.2.2.1  DSP Technique
Figure 5.9 shows the signal processing technique in a UWB-IR reader architecture. 
In this method, the received pulse captured from the chipless RFID tag is digitized 
with an ADC in the receiver section, as shown in Figure 5.9. Because the opera­
tional bandwidth of the chipless RFID tag is several gigahertz, the ADC should be 
selected carefully. When choosing the ADC, there are two options. According to the 
Nyquist sampling theorem, the sampling frequency of the signal should be at least 
twice the bandwidth. However, in practice at least five times the bandwidth of the 
signal is used as the sampling frequency for faithful reconstruction of the processing 
signal. Therefore, the required sampling rate should become several gigasamples 
per second (GS/S). These types of high-speed ADCs are extremely expensive. In ad­
dition, very high performance hardware platforms are also required to control the 
high-speed ADCs.
To alleviate this problem, the equivalent time sampling technique [28, 29] can 
be used to sample the repetitive signals with lower sampling rates than are required 
using the conventional method. The following section explains the theory and op­
eration of the equivalent time sampling technique.
Equivalent Time Sampling (ETS) Technique
The ETS technique uses a much lower sampling rate than real-time sampling rate 
ADC to sample the signals that have very large bandwidth. Although the maximum 
sampling rate of the ADC is low, it is essential to have an analog front-end with 
enough bandwidth that is able to handle the sampled wideband input signal. How­
ever, ETS can be applied only to repetitive signals or signals that can be repeated 
with precise repetition time throughout the entire sampling cycle. The ETS process 
is illustrated in Figure 5.10. As shown in the figure, the input signal is repeated with

a time interval T that has a lower repetition rate than the maximum sampling rate 
of the ADC. The sampling interval T is obtained with a triggering mechanism or us­
ing a counter. As shown in the figure, in the first cycle of the repetitive input signal, 
only one sample is acquired by the ADC. Then in the next cycle, a small time delay 
of Δt is added before sampling the input signal. This time delay is progressively 
incremented over the entire sampling cycle as the sampling continues. Therefore, to 
sample the Nth cycle, a time delay of (N – 1) · Δt is required after the place where 
the first trigger point is applied. Since only one sample is acquired per cycle, the 
acquisition time is no longer limited by the sampling rate of the ADC. It is possible 
to acquire N number of samples from the input signal by repeating the input signal 
N number of times. Then the signal is reconstructed with the acquired samples with 
correct timing information. However, the use of ETS increases the complexity of 
the signal processing techniques. As explained in [30, 31], the reconstruction of the 
original signal by using the acquired samples requires a considerable amount of 
signal processing in order to achieve accurate results. In conclusion, the high-end 
ADC is traded off with the advanced signal processing algorithm. 
In the chipless RFID application, the interrogation signal generator is con­
trolled by the reader’s control section. The interrogation signal can be repeated 
as required as long as the tag produces the same response for the repeated inter­
rogation signal. Therefore, the signal at the reader’s receiver is a repetitive signal. 
The ETS technique repetitively samples the received signals from the tag that have 
several gigahertz bandwidth without using very high speed expensive ADCs.
After digitizing the received signal, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) can be 
applied to obtain the frequency spectrum of the received signal. The FFT of the 
received signal shows the frequency signature of the chipless RFID tag. Therefore, 
by analyzing the computed frequency spectrum, it is possible to decode the identi­
fication data of the chipless tag.
By implementing a low sampling rate ADC and ETS technique, it is possible 
to design a low-cost reader architecture for a chipless RFID system. The reader 
architecture can read a variety of chipless RFID tags with different operational 
bandwidths. The next section discusses a low-cost receiver architecture that can be 
used with this time domain reading technique.
5.2.2.2  Microwave Channelized Receiver Architecture
Figure 5.11 shows the block diagram for a chipless RFID reader that identifies the 
frequency signature of the chipless tag with a filter bank based RF receiver architec­
ture. As shown in the figure, after the receiver antenna, an LNA is used to amplify 
the received signal. To keep the received UWB pulse undistorted after amplification, 
the LNA must meet two important requirements: good phase linearity (or fewer 
variations in group delay performance of the LNA) [32–34] and a flat gain response 
over the operational bandwidth [33, 35]. The nonlinear phase response of the am­
plifier distorts the shape of the amplified pulse [34]. As a consequence, the LNA 
may distort the frequency spectrum of the received signal. In addition to the group 
delay and gain requirements, a flat noise figure (NF) performance over the opera­
tional bandwidth and low power consumption are also desirable [33]. Followed by 
the LNA, a power divider is used with a number of branches. The output branches 
of the power divider are terminated to a set of bandpass filters. This configuration

Time Domain Based Chipless RFID Reader
of a receiver is called the channelized receiver architecture (or filter bank based 
receiver) [36]. This receiver architecture has been widely used in wideband radar 
receiver systems for a long time [37, 38].
As shown in Figure 5.11, a channelized receiver typically consists of a 1-to-
n-way power divider and a set of bandpass filters connected at each output port 
of the power divider. This configuration divides a wideband signal into a set of 
narrowband channels. Then each channel is processed separately. This simple tech­
nique greatly reduces the complexity of wideband receiver architectures [36]. The 
concept of channelization is being used in digital receiver architectures as well. By 
using a digitized signal with digital down-conversion and digital filtering, division 
of the wideband signal into a number of narrowband channels has been reported 
[39, 40]. However, due to the limitations in signal processing power in ADC and 
DSP hardware, the bandwidth of the processed signal and the operating frequen­
cies of the digital channelization techniques are not enough for the UWB chipless 
RFID application. Solutions are discussed next.
The output of the power divider produces the copies of the original signal re­
ceived by the Rx antenna of the reader. At each output of the power divider, a nar­
row bandpass filter is used. Each bandpass filter has the center frequencies of the 
resonators of the chipless tag. The output of each bandpass filter passes only the 
energy contained in the passband of the input pulse. Then the envelope detectors

connected to the output of the bandpass filters produce a pulse output that can be 
detected with typical digital hardware systems. If there is a resonance in the chipless 
RFID tag, the output pulse from the chipless tag does not contain that particular 
frequency band. Then the corresponding channel corresponding to that particular 
resonator does not output a signal. On the other hand if no resonator resonates at 
a certain frequency, the output pulse from the chipless tag contains that frequency 
band. Then the corresponding channel of the receiver outputs a pulse indicating the 
absence of the resonator and the presence of the particular frequency band in the 
received signal. Based on this operating principle, by observing the output channels 
of the receiver section of the reader, it is possible to identify the resonances of the 
chipless RFID tag.
The next section presents the design and the simulation setup of the proposed 
chipless RFID reader using Agilent’s ADS2009. ADS2009 is a very powerful tool 
for designing and evaluating a complex system. The system-level simulation of the 
TD based reader architecture validates the concept.
5.3  Design of UWB TD Based Chipless RFID Reader
The important design steps and the simulation setup in Agilent ADS2009 are de­
scribed in this section. Out of the two reader designs presented in Figures 5.9 and 
5.11, only the reader with the channelized receiver architecture is simulated. The 
operation of the reader that uses signal processing techniques is self-explanatory 
and not simulated. 
As shown in Figure 5.11, each output branch of the power divider has an RF 
power divider network and a bandpass filter. The power divider and the filters can 
be implemented using microstrip lines on the RF PCB board. It is preferable to use 
a power divider type with sufficient isolation between output ports. A 1-to-n-way 
fork-type power divider with high isolation on the order of 30 to 40 dB is report­
ed in [41]. Similar multi-stage power dividers can be implemented in the current 
receiver architecture. Even for a flexible receiver configuration, a reconfigurable 
power divider can be used. 
The bandpass filters are tuned to the center frequency of each resonant fre­
quency of the multiresonator based chipless RFID tag. The bandpass filters also 
can be implemented on the same RF board of the power divider. Implementation 
of the bandpass filters can be done either by using lumped components or by us­
ing microstrip technology without a lumped component. However, the use of mi­
crostrip technology to implement the filters may occupy more space on the RF 
PCB board. Therefore, proper optimization of the cost and the size of the RF PCB 
should be done when choosing the type of bandpass filter. The pass bandwidth of 
the bandpass filter must be kept in the range of the bandwidth of the correspond­
ing bandstop resonator of the chipless tag. If the passband is not synchronized with 
the bandwidth of the corresponding bandstop filter of the tag, the receiver will 
give erroneous results at the outputs of each channel of the RF section. A sufficient 
guardband is needed to isolate adjacent resonances. 
The outputs of each bandpass filter are then connected to an envelope detector. 
For the envelope detector a rectifying diode and a capacitor are used to keep the 
cost of the reader to a minimum. When choosing the components for the reader, 

106 
��������������������������������������
Time Domain Based Chipless RFID Reader
it is important to choose the ones that cover the whole operating frequency band­
width of the reader. 
The output of the envelope detector is then connected to an FPGA or a micro­
controller to identify which branch gives a voltage output. If a certain frequency is 
attenuated at the tag, then at the receiver the corresponding branch of the envelope 
detector will give a lower voltage output. If a certain frequency is not attenuated at 
the tag, it will give a higher voltage output than the earlier case.
However, this reader architecture is not as flexible as the one that uses signal 
processing techniques for identifying the resonances and data decoding. For read­
ing a tag with different resonant frequencies, a different RF section is required. 
An RF section with tunable bandpass filters can accommodate the variations of 
frequency responses in the chipless tag due to variations in the printing quality, 
material properties, and addition of environmental noises and interferences. Such 
a reconfigurable RF section will bring new breakthroughs in chipless RFID tag 
reader development. A list of components that can be used in the design of the 
chipless RFID readers described above is shown in Table 5.1.

nelized receiver architecture. The modeling of the UWB short RF pulse generator, 
chipless RFID tag, and receiver section is presented in detail. The important steps 
and methods used in the reader configuration to obtain the results at each section 
of the design are also described along with illustrations of waveforms. Note: The

5.3  Design of UWB TD Based Chipless RFID Reader 
107
Agilent ADS2009 software package and hereafter the term ADS are used as the 
nomenclature of ADS the software development platform.
Figure 5.12 shows the schematics of the block diagram of the simulation setup 
of the reader system used in ADS. The three main units of the reader system are 
marked on the block diagram. When creating the simulation project, the “Digi­
tal Signal Processing Network” option is used. For the simulation controller, the 
“Data Flow Controller” should be used in simulations. A 20-ps time step is used 
for the simulation.
In developing the modular equivalent circuit for a chipless RFID tag reader 
system, a few unique models for antennas, chipless tags, and readers have been 
derived. For example, for a UWB antenna, the model comprises (1) a gain block 
of Gn to represent the gain of the nth antenna, (2) a bandpass filter to represent 
the finite bandwidth of the antenna, and (3) an antenna that is used as a spatial 
transformer, the coupling interface between free spaces of intrinsic impedance of 
377 Ω to a 50-Ω microwave system, a transformer with a turns ratio of 377Ω : 50Ω 
completes the antenna model. The model is used in the transmitter and receiver of 
the reader and in the tag. Figure 5.12 show the model for the UWB antenna, the 
tag, and the reader as used in ADS. All modules are connected via wires. The free-
space path loss is represented with an attenuator with an attenuation factor of A ∝ 
1/R2, where R is the free-space path length. Following are detailed descriptions of 
the models for the antennas, UWB-IR transmitter, and the receiver.

Time Domain Based Chipless RFID Reader
Modeling Chipless Tag
A series of bandstop filters was used to model the tag with the UWB Tx/Rx anten­
nas. For the model a 4-bit chipless tag is used in the investigation. Hence, only four 
resonant frequencies were used: 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.4 GHz. Data conventions were 
as follows: the presence of a resonator (attenuation at a designated frequency)—
logic 0; the absence of a resonator (no attenuation at a designated frequency)—logic 
1. Figure 5.13(a) shows the schematic model of the tag.
The system-level simulation model of the tag created in ADS is shown in Figure 
5.13(b). The bandstop filters were created using the “SBlock” module available in 
the “Timed Linear” library. The characteristics of the filter are specified with a text 
file created in the Touchstone format. The four filters represent a multiresona­
tor based 4-bit chipless tag. As shown in Figure 5.13(b), parallel unity gain blocks 
are used to remove the bandstop filter from the simulation setup easily without 
deleting components from the simulation setup. Just disabling an “SBlock” and 
enabling the gain block connected in parallel to it removes the bandstop filter from 
the simulation without interrupting the signal flow through the deactivated resona­
tor block.
Modeling the UWB Pulse Transmitter
The UWB pulse transmitter consists of a UWB pulse generator and a transmitting 
antenna of gain  G2 as shown in Figure 5.14(a). The built-in Gaussian second-order 
derivative pulse generator is used to model the UWB short RF pulse generator as 
shown in Figure 5.14(b). A 100-ps pulse width is used to generate a wideband short 
RF pulse. The UWB antenna model with a G2 gain block, a bandpass filter with a 
3- to 7-GHz passband bandwidth, and a wire-to-air interface transformer is used 
after the impulse generator.

Modeling Receiver Section
The receiver section consists of (1) a receiving antenna, (2) an LNA, (3) a 1-to-n-
way power divider, (4) bandpass filters, (5) envelope detectors, and (6) compara­
tors. A built-in, four-way fork power divider is used as the power divider simulation 
model.The bandpass filters were modeled with SBlock, which has characteristics 
defined by a text file in the Touchstone format similar to the bandstop filter mod­
els used in the chipless tag model. The envelope detectors were modeled with the 
in-built models of a rectifier and a lowpass filter. To obtain the time domain wave­
forms at different points of the setup, “TimedSink” data monitors available in the 
“Sinks” library in ADS are used.
The outputs of each envelop detector are connected to a voltage comparator.
The comparator converts the analog pulse output into a square pulse that can 
be easily interfaced into a digital electronics device such as a microcontroller or 
a FPGA. For the simulation, same reference voltage is used for all output chan­
nels. However, it is possible to provide different reference voltage levels for each 
comparator using a DAC as shown in Figure 5.11 to provide more flexibility to 
determine suitable reference values for each channel.
The complete system-level simulation model of a chipless RFID tag-reader sys­
tem is used in Agilent ADS2009. Three main blocks—the pulse transmitter, the 
tag, and the receiver—are hardwired. The air interfaces between the three blocks 
are represented by the 377 Ω : 50 Ω transformer blocks incorporated in the anten­
nas. The air interfaces are modeled with attenuators. The next section presents the 
system-level simulation results obtained using this simulation model of the chipless 
tag-reader system.

Time Domain Based Chipless RFID Reader
5.4  Results
Here, the simulation results for a UWB TD based chipless RFID reader are pre­
sented. The results presented in this section show the functionality of the reader, 
how the data bits are encoded in the tag and decoded from the outputs obtained 
from the RF sections of the reader, and the time domain waveforms and their fre­
quency spectrum at each important observation point of the system. Places where 
important changes of the input signal take place are connected with “TimedSinks” 
(equivalent oscilloscopes) and “Spectrum Analyzers” on the block diagram of the 
simulation model.
The system is modeled with two 4-bit frequency signature based chipless tags 
with tag IDs of “0101” and “1111.” As can be seen in the figure, the transmitter 
generates a Gaussian pulse and transmits through the antenna to the tag. The tag 
encodes the pulse as it passes through the resonators. The output pulse contains the 
frequency signature of the tag embedded in the waveform. A detailed analysis of 
the pulse can be found in [2]. The FFT of the signal yields the encoded data bits in 
the frequency domain. The tag sends the encoded signal to the receiver. The receiv­
er’s LNA amplifies the signal and sends it to a 1-to-4-way power divider. The BPFs 
channelize the UWB signal into their prescribed narrowband channels. The outputs 
of the filter provide refined frequency domain data bits. The filter outputs pass 
through the envelope detectors followed by comparators. A square pulse output 
is generated by the comparator that can be easily interfaced with digital electronic 
devices such as microprocessors or FPGAs.
As shown in Figure 5.15, the UWB pulse only exists for 0.5 ns and this wave­
form has a 3-dB bandwidth of 3 GHz and 10-dB bandwidth of 6 GHz. The analysis 
of the time domain impulse when it passes through a bandpass filter is shown in 
Figure 5.15. Figures 5.16(a) and (b) show the signal when it passes through the 
tag. The time domain waveform and the frequency spectrum depict the encoded 
data bits “0101” and “1111” as shown in the figure. For ID “0101” two obvious 
resonances in the frequency spectrum are observed whereas for ID “1111” the 
spectrum flattens. Similar phenomena are also observed in the time domain signals.

Figures 5.17(a) and (b) show the outputs of the bandpass filters of the receiver. 
The attenuation at the selected frequency bands can be seen clearly. This attenua­
tion of the resonance frequency does not provide enough power to create an out­
put at the envelope detector, hence the outputs of the envelope detectors remain 
near zero. The outputs of envelope detectors and comparators for tags encoded 
as “0101” and “1111” are shown in Figure 5.18. The comparator outputs can be 
interfaced directly with the FPGA/microcontroller pins. The FPGA/microcontroller 
identifies the data as “0101” or “1111.” The maximum time taken for this decod­
ing process is 9 ns according to the simulation. This shows the improvement of 
the data decoding speed and demonstrates the suitability of this technique for use 
with high-speed tag reading. For frequency domain reading of the same 4-bit tag, 
the reading time is 500 ms [42]. This shows the improvement in the data decoding 
speed and the suitability of this technique for use in high-speed tag reading and 
when reading tags on the move.

Time Domain Based Chipless RFID Reader
and shown promise for practical implementation. However, many practical issues 
need to be addressed when practical design and system-level integration are consid­
ered for the proposed reader system. The contrasting issues of the simulations are 
as follows:
••
ADS considers ideal components and work in their linear operating regions. 
The nonlinear behavior and transient analysis of the components may be 
incorporated in future simulation studies of the reader system.
••
We have hardwired components assuming the antenna to be the spatial filter 
with an impedance transformer of ratio of 377 Ω : 50 Ω for reception and 
50Ω : 377Ω for transmission. The dynamic free-space path loss and practical 
channel model are missing in this simulation.
••
We also did not consider the distance between the tag and the reader as we 
hardwired the system blocks. Therefore, the propagation path loss and sur­
rounding interference and the attenuation of power levels with distances are 
missing in the simulation.
••
We also did not consider the phase noise, delay spread, antenna temperature, 
system thermal noise, and nonlinearity of devices in the simulation. What 
will be the effect of group delay in the antenna and filter with respect to the 
time domain impulse response? Some antennas are good at UWB impulse 
response compared to other types of antennas. The reader antenna should 
be planar, low weight, and low profile in design and implementation. How 
will the antenna be responsive to the UWB-IR based interrogation signals?
••
In the receiver the UWB channels are subdivided into narrowband channels 
with a 1-to-n-way power divider followed by the narrow passband filters. Is 
adequate channel equalization considered in the simulations?
The results of the individual blocks have been discussed in a sequential order as 
presented in Section 5.4. Here some critical issues are addressed for practical imple­
mentations of system blocks: impulse transmitter, chipless RFID tag, and receiver.

Time Domain Based Chipless RFID Reader
Impulse Transmitter
The impulse transmitter is modeled with an impulse generator followed by a band­
pass filter. The impulse distorts when the filter is applied as shown in Figure 5.18. 
A few issues are considered for UWB-IR based communication systems as follows: 
The impulse responses of passive components such as antennas could be major is­
sues in UWB communications systems. A dipole-like antenna is less susceptible to 
the time domain signal compared to a planar antenna such as a microstrip patch 
antenna. Will the delay spread be the optimum choice for a low-profile printed an­
tenna such as a microstrip patch antenna? Microstrip patch antennas are conformal 
to handheld and gantry-based readers. They are readily available in the commercial 
market. Therefore, the proposed reader may consider microstrip antennas as suit­
able candidates.
Chipless RFID Tag
The chipless RFID tag comprises two orthogonally polarized UWB disk-loaded 
monopole antennas and a series of multiresonator circuits [27]. A few critical issues 
may need to be considered as follows:
••
Planar bandpass and bandstop filters suffer from group delays of time do­
main transmitted signals. Will there be acceptable group delays of the incom­
ing UWB impulse signals in both transmission and reception modes via the 
chipless RFID tag?
••
The isolation level between the frequency responses of a logic 0 (with resona­
tor) and logic 1 (without resonator) is on the order of 25 dB. For very weak 
signal reception, this constitutes a very minimal difference between the two 
logic levels. What will be the receiver sensitivity to discriminate these minute 
differences between the two logic levels and to extract the information car­
rying data bits in the reader?
••
Printing errors of chipless RFID tags, variations of base materials on which 
the tags will be printed, and ambient noise may contribute to the signal 
distortion and variation in frequency responses (both amplitude and phase) 
when the tags are in the reading zone of the reader. What types of adaptive 
threshold technique and reconfigurable filters will be utilized to overcome 
the reading errors in the system?
Receiver
The receiver comprises the receiving antenna, a LNA, a power divider, narrow 
bandpass filters for channelization of the UWB signal, envelope detectors, and com­
parators. The receiver is the most susceptible to interference and noise. Antenna 
temperature and its impulse response, the noise figures, the gain and linearity of the 
LNA, the delay spread (group delays) of passive components such as power divid­
ers and filters and their interconnects (such as SMA connectors and interconnecting 
microstrip transmission lines), and the intermodulation products of the envelope 
detectors and the comparators may contribute to significant distortions and impose 
challenges to recovering the encoded data bits from the chipless RFID tag.

5.5  Conclusion 
115
System-Level Considerations
During the integration of the system using the modular approach as shown in Fig­
ure 5.16, a few system-level considerations need to be addressed as follows:
••
Signal-to-noise ratio of the overall system;
••
Aggregated antenna noise temperature of the system;
••
System noise temperature;
••
Noise due to inappropriate shielding, grounding, and filters (all electro­
magnetic compatibility and electromagnetic interference issues and their 
remedies);
••
Noise introduced by the tag due to printing errors and variations in substrate 
materials and design inaccuracies due to these consequences. 
Yield analysis and Monte Carlo simulation may provide some degrees of flex­
ibility in the system-level design considerations. All of these practical issues must be 
considered in the practical design of the system. 
5.5  Conclusion
This chapter has presented a UWB reader architecture based on a time domain 
UWB-IR interrogation signal. UWB is a license-free frequency band technology that 
has gained popularity for short-distance, high-data-speed communications between 
household devices. In UWB communications, devices are designed in two formats: 
UWB microwave circuit design and impulse radio based system design. In the first 
method, all active and passive components are designed targeting a bandwidth of 
more than 500 MHz. However, in the time domain the requirements of UWB mi­
crowave circuits are not relinquished. Here devices that provide a linear response 
to the UWB impulse with minimum distortion are envisaged. The main advantage 
of UWB-IR based devices is the minimal time required to generate the transmitted 
signal. A burst of wideband signals can be sent in a very short duration via a very 
narrow pulse. This advantage of very short time transmission, which is contrary 
to a VCO swept frequency based source, has been exploited in the proposed time 
domain based reader architecture. However, since most microwave communica­
tions circuits are traditional frequency domain circuits, the time domain devices 
are maturing. There are also many challenges for time domain devices. They are 
basically transient responses and nonlinearity may disrupt the system performance. 
The chapter has taken a challenging stride to propose a new TD based reader archi­
tecture for the chipless RFID system.
First, the chapter reviewed time domain based chipless RFID systems. The re­
view revealed only a few reported works [1–6] based on a TD reading technique. 
These works are mainly based on time domain reflectometry (TDR) based chipless 
RFID tags. Only the authors’ group has reported multiresonator frequency sig­
nature based chipless tag detection using time domain signals [2]. In this regard, 
the chapter has contributed some fundamental knowledge in the discipline. The 
proposed reader architecture comprises an impulse transmitter and a channelized

receiver. The transmitter is comprised of a modified Gaussian pulse generator fol­
lowed by a UWB antenna. The receiver is comprised of an LNA block, a 1-to-n-
way power divider followed by narrow bandpass filters, envelope detectors, and 
comparators. The system is capable of reading any frequency signature based chi­
pless RFID tag such as a retransmission chipless tag [27] and a backscatter chipless 
tag [43] with minor modifications if required. To implement the TD-based reader 
architecture the following tasks have been performed:
••
Various impulse generators and pulse shaping circuits have been studied. The 
study has led to three categories of impulse generators: (1) a pulse generator 
with a reconfigurable up-converter, (2) a pulse generator containing a pulse 
shaping circuit, and (3) commercially available equipment. As stated earlier, 
most reported works used laboratory equipment to prove their concepts. 
Therefore, there is a big gap in the research and development efforts. An 
impulse generator has been proposed that can be directly implemented in the 
prototype time domain based chipless RFID tag reader. In this regard, among 
the three pulse generation circuits, the pulse generator with an up-converter 
circuit has been selected as the candidate signal source. This is mainly be­
cause these types of pulse generators yield the most controlled impulse for a 
chipless RFID tag reader.
••
After selecting the source, we have proposed two types of detection methods 
in the receiver of the reader: (1) a signal processing method and (2) a hard­
ware method. Both techniques have pros and cons in processing the returned 
echoes from the tag.
••
The chipless RFID is a UWB system. Processing the UWB signal in state-
of-the-art processors requires very expensive DSP chip sets, high sampling 
ADCs, FPGAs, and a powerful algorithm. In this chapter, we have concen­
trated on the hardware based receiver.
••
The Agilent ADS2009 platform with “Digital Signal Processing Network,” 
“Data Flow Controller,” and 20-ps time step has been used to implement the 
proposed TD reader architecture. The three modulesthe impulse transmitter, 
the multiresonator chipless RFID tag, and the hardware based receiverwere 
fully designed in the schematics of Touchstone of ADS2009 and simulated 
for performance validation. For the proof-of-concept ADS implementation, 
a 4-bit chipless RFID tag operating over a 4- to 6-GHz frequency band was 
designed. The reader comprises the transmitter and the receiver.
••
In modeling the three modules in ADS2009, a few unique contributions are 
made. Since the system is a modular design, the transmitter, the tag, and the 
receiver are hardwired for simulation.
••
The antennas for the reader and the tag are modeled as a spatial filter with 
a gain block representing the gain of the antenna, a bandpass filter, and a 
transformer with an impedance ratio of 377 Ω: 50Ω for transmission and 
50Ω : 377Ω for reception. A variable attenuator with attenuation A ∝ 1/R2 
can be used to represent the free-space path loss. Here R is the reading dis­
tance of the tag from the reader.

Questions 
117
••
The universal model of the frequency signature based chipless RFID tag is 
comprised of a tandem of parallel gain blocks and stopband filters. Based on 
the presence and absence of the multiresonator (stopband filter) circuits, the 
gain block and the filter were activated. Both transmitting and receiving an­
tennas with appropriate gain blocks, bandpass filters, and impedance trans­
formers were connected with the resonator blocks. This design is a unique 
equivalent circuit model representing any frequency signature based chipless 
RFID tag
••
The transmitter has been designed with an impulse generator and an an­
tenna. A 100-ps pulse width is used to generate a wideband short RF pulse. 
The pulse bandwidth is constricted with the UWB antenna, namely, the band­
pass filter. However, the pulse shape generates appropriate spectral content 
spanning from 4 to 7 GHz with approximately uniform amplitude over the 
frequency band.
••
The receiver is the most complex system of all modules in the proposed 
reader architecture. The receiver uses a UWB receiving antenna, an LNA 
gain block, a power divider, narrow bandpass filters, envelope detectors, and 
comparators. The unique feature of the receiver is the method of channeliza­
tion using the power divider and the narrow bandpass filters. The down-con­
version to a baseband signal and filtering are done with envelope detectors. 
The final baseband signal is sent for further processing in the voltage com­
parators assisted decision circuit such as FPGAs and microcontrollers and 
their computer interfaces.
••
The designed receiver was able to successfully decode two 4-bit chipless tags 
having the IDs “1010” and “1111.” A comprehensive system-level design 
and signal flow diagrams helped depict the performance of the proposed 
reader architecture in every stage of signal transitions of the tag–reader sys­
tem. This has developed huge confidence in the practical implementation of 
such reader architecture in real-world scenarios.

Hybrid Chipless RFID Reader
6.1  Introduction
In previous chapters chipless RFID systems that generally use a single dimension, 
such as the frequency or time domain, for encoding information were discussed. In 
such systems, an elemental encoding structure is used to transform the properties 
of the dimension used, frequency or time, in order to encode information where 
the presence of the elemental structure encodes a single bit of information. Also, in 
the process of reading a chipless tag, RFID readers are required only to analyze the 
characteristics of the single dimension used for encoding information.
In [1–3] a spiral resonator is used as the elemental encoding structure to trans­
form the amplitude spectrum for encoding information in the frequency domain 
(refer to Chapter 2). The presence of a spiral resonator causes a sharp attenuation 
in the amplitude spectrum and also simultaneously causes an abrupt phase jump in 
the phase spectrum at the resonant frequency of the resonator in the frequency do­
main. Therefore, one can use either the amplitude spectrum or the phase spectrum 
as a dimension for encoding information where the representation of a single bit of 
information requires a unique spiral resonator resonating at a unique frequency. In 
the time domain reflectometry based chipless RFID systems described in [4–6] the 
elemental encoding structure is a capacitive stub that introduces a discontinuity in 
the transmission line forming the chipless RFID tag. Each discontinuity generates 
a single echo that encodes a single information bit. Hence, each capacitive element 
can only encode a single bit of information in the chipless RFID tag.
It is clear that the use of a single dimension limits the amount of information 
that can be encoded into an elemental encoding structure. Also, encoding more 
information using a single dimension requires the use of multiple elemental struc­
tures. This demands more space, requiring the overall size of the chipless RFID 
tag to be very large, which causes the chipless RFID system to be impractical in 
real-world applications. To increase the spectral and spatial efficiency in encoding 
information in chipless RFID systems, each elemental structure needs to encode 
more than one bit of information. By designing an elemental structure capable of 
manipulating multiple amplitude levels as opposed to causing an abrupt change of 
a single level, multiple bits can be encoded into a given dimension such as time or 
frequency; that is, multiple amplitude level changes at a given resonant frequency

for a frequency domain chipless RFID tag or multiple amplitude levels of an echo 
in a time domain reflectometry based chipless RFID tag. However, using multiple 
levels for encoding information in a single dimension, particularly in a passive con­
text without any active digital modulation or forward error correction mechanisms 
together with noise and other detriments introduced by the wireless environment is 
unreliable and will introduce many errors. Therefore, a better solution to improve 
spectral and spatial efficiency in chipless RFID systems is to design elemental struc­
tures that are capable of encoding information by simultaneously transforming 
properties in multiple dimensions. Figure 6.1 contrasts the use of a single dimen­
sion and multiple dimensions for encoding information in chipless RFID systems. 
It is evident that the use of extra dimensions enables the efficient use of frequency 
spectrum and space.
Several works have reported on the use of hybrid encoding approaches to design 
compact and efficient chipless RFID systems. The earliest reported hybrid RFID 
systems have elemental encoding structures that make use of frequency, phase, and 
time for encoding information in a mixed nature [7, 8]. Although the authors of 
these works do not specifically define the term hybrid chipless RFID, they make use 
of more than one dimension for encoding information in each elemental encoding 
structure.
In [8] the elemental encoding structure is a stub-loaded microstrip patch anten­
na, where the antenna resonates at a unique resonant frequency and also produces 
a phase shift due to the loading condition. The phase shift depends on the length of 
the stub attached to the patch antenna. Therefore, each patch antenna can be used 
to encode more than a single bit of information by using multiple levels of phase 
shifts.
In [7] the dimensions of phase and time are used for encoding information in a 
chipless RFID. The structure of the chipless RFID tag discussed in [7] is similar to 
a time domain reflectometry based system where discontinuities in a transmission

line result in echoes, which in turn encode information bits. Here in addition to 
encoding information bits using the time of arrival of the echoes, each discontinuity 
also introduces unique phase information to each echo, which further enhances the 
data capacity of the system. The authors of [9] use the two dimensions, time and 
frequency, for encoding information in a chipless RFID tag. The elemental encod­
ing structure is a spiral resonator. Even though each resonator encodes a single bit, 
the introduction of a meandered transmission line section in the chipless tag causes 
a time delay that enables the reuse of the same resonance frequencies in a different 
time period, as in a time domain multiplexing system. This enables better spectrum 
utilization; however, the size of the chipless tag becomes larger since the number of 
bits per elemental encoding structure is not improved.
In [10] the chipless tag uses a pulse position encoding technique where it intro­
duces a frequency-dependent unique time delay to interrogation pulses modulated 
with different frequencies. The system makes use of the dimensions of group delay 
and frequency for encoding information. The elemental encoding structure used is 
a C-section dispersive delay structure. However, the system demonstrated can only 
encode a single bit per C-section. The authors of [11, 12] also make use of a similar 
C-section based chipless RFID design to make use of the dimensions of group delay 
and frequency for encoding information into chipless RFID tags. In a recent work 
[13], a chipless RFID system that uses the dimensions of frequency and polariza­
tion for encoding information is presented. Here, the elemental encoding structure 
is a set of co-centric split-ring resonators (SRR). In [14] a chipless RFID tag based 
on a set of C-sections is designed that makes use of the two dimensions of phase 
deviation bandwidth and frequency for encoding information. 
In this chapter the aforementioned hybrid chipless RFID systems that make 
use of more than one dimension for encoding information are examined in detail. 
The discussions presented are classified into three groups: (1) frequency-phase, (2) 
frequency-polarization, and (3) frequency-time as shown in Figure 6.2. The theory 
involved in encoding information in an elemental encoding structure of the chipless 
RFID tag and the organization of the RFID reader for each group is discussed in 
detail. The rest of the chapter is organized as illustrated in Figure 6.3. In Section 
6.2 the research reported in [14] is discussed in detail where the two dimensions 
of frequency and phase are used for encoding information bits in chipless RFID 
tags. The characteristics and operation of the encoding element are discussed and

examined in detail. The encoding element’s application in the chipless RFID tag de­
sign is presented and the corresponding RFID reader design is discussed. Next, the 
novel technique reported in [13], which makes use of polarization as an additional 
dimension for encoding information, is examined. The frequency and polarization 
characteristics of the elemental encoding structure are discussed in detail and its 
application for data encoding in the hybrid chipless RFID tag design is illustrated. 
An RFID reader design capable of reading hybrid frequency-polarization based chi­
pless RFID tags is also discussed. Section 6.4 discusses several works [10–12, 15, 
16] that make use of frequency and time as dimensions for encoding information 
in chipless RFID technology. An RFID reader design that analyzes characteristics 
of both time and frequency is also discussed. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Sec­
tion 6.5.

6.2  Frequency-Phase Based System
In this section the work of Vena et al. [14] on the simultaneous use of the two di­
mensions of frequency shift and phase deviation bandwidth for data encoding in 
chipless RFID is discussed. Here, the basic element that encodes information in the 
chipless RFID tag is a planar C-section. 
6.2.1  Working Principle of the Encoding Element
Figure 6.4 depicts the elemental encoding structure used in the chipless RFID tag 
design of [14]. It is a planar C-section consisting of only a single layer of conductive 
material placed on a substrate material. The dimensions L and g of the C-section 
determine the resonance frequency and the phase deviation bandwidth. 
When the structure shown in Figure 6.4 is illuminated with an electromagnetic 
wave that is vertically polarized, a highly resonant mode is observed at a specific 
frequency in the RCS. The resonant frequency is a function of the physical dimen­
sions of the C-section. Figure 6.5 shows the behavior observed in the radar cross 
section near the resonance frequency of the C-section when L is fixed and g is 
varied. Each C-section gives rise to a resonant peak and a resonant dip, and the fre­
quency of the resonant peak is determined by the length L + g/2. The gap between 
the peak and dip is related to the ratio between g and L. The C-section also trans­
forms the phase near the resonance. From Figure 6.5 we can observe that the phase 
transformation bandwidth is closely linked with the frequency of the resonant peak 
and resonant dip. Therefore, we can see that the phase transformation or deviation 
bandwidth B is also a function of g/L. Figure 6.6 shows the behavior of the radar 
cross section near the resonance when g is fixed and L is varied slightly. The lengths 
g and L are chosen such that g is always much smaller than L. Therefore, a slight 
change in L does not greatly affect the ratio g/L. Hence, it is observed that when 
L is slightly changed the resonance peak shifts, whereas the phase deviation band­

width stays the same since the ratio is not affected. However, the start frequency of 
the phase deviation bandwidth shifts together with resonance peak.
The resonant nature of the C-section observed in Figures 6.5 and 6.6 can be 
analytically expressed using the following transfer function T(ω) [14],

the damping factor mp where the resonant dip is characterized by the zero at ωz 
with the damping factor mz.

6.2.2  Hybrid Frequency-Phase Chipless RFID Based on C-Sections
By carefully selecting the values of L and g, it is possible to assign a unique reso­
nance peak and a phase deviation bandwidth to a C-section so that information 
can be encoded using both frequency and phase. Figure 6.7 demonstrates a possible 
case where 2 bits can be encoded in a single C-section using a combination of phase 
deviation bandwidth and frequency shifts. From Figure 6.7 it is clear that the most 
significant bit (MSB) of the 2 bits is determined by the resonant peak frequency; 
that is, the MSB is “0” when the resonant peak frequency is f1, and it is “1” when 
the C-section has a resonant peak at f1 + Δf. The resonant peak frequency is pre­
dominantly controlled by the length L1.
The least significant bit (LSB) of the 2 bits is determined by the phase deviation 
bandwidth. When the C-section takes the smaller phase deviation bandwidth, B1, 
the LSB is “0” and when it has the larger bandwidth B2 the LSB is “1.” Therefore, 
through the unique combination of a resonant peak frequency and a phase devia­
tion bandwidth, the C-section will encode one of four 2-bit data combinations, 
“00,” “01,” “10,” or “11.” Figure 6.8 shows a constellation diagram for a differ­
ent set of frequency-phase combinations that a C-section can be configured to have 
for improved encoding efficiency. It is possible to encode 1 of 10 states to a single 
elemental encoding structure. All 16 states shown in the constellation diagram can­

not be physically achieved due to overlapping of resonance frequencies; only the 10 
states that are shown as dark filled circles can be realized [14].
The chipless tag demonstrated in [14] consists of multiple C-sections, as shown 
in Figure 6.9, each encoding more than 1 bit of information. The total tag signature 
will have multiple resonant peaks and phase deviation bandwidths corresponding 
to each C-section in the chipless tag. 
6.2.3  Chipless RFID Reader for Hybrid Frequency-Phase Chipless RFID
The RFID reader required for reading a hybrid frequency-phase chipless RFID 
should be able to simultaneously extract both phase and amplitude spectrums of 
the backscattered signal. Either of the reader designs proposed in Chapter 4 (fre­
quency domain) and Chapter 5 (time domain) can be employed for implementing 
an RFID reader for reading hybrid frequency-phase chipless RFID tags. Figure 6.10 
illustrates the design of a frequency domain based RFID reader that uses a gain/
phase detector (GPD) for reading hybrid chipless RFID.

6.2  Frequency-Phase Based System 
129
The reader design shown in Figure 6.10 is discussed and explained in detail in 
Chapter 4, Section 4.2.1. It consists of mainly two sections, an RF front-end and 
a digital section that performs control functions of the RF front-end and processes 
digitized data. Usually the digital section is implemented using a field program­
mable gate array (FPGA) or an industrial microcontroller. 
The interrogation signal is generated using a voltage-controlled oscillator 
(VCO), which is controlled using analog control signals produced by a digital-to-
analog converter (DAC). The DAC is controlled by the digital section. Here the 
transmitted interrogation signal is a frequency sweep where the frequency linearly 
increases from low to high, which corresponds to a control signal having the shape 
of a sawtooth waveform. The interrogation signal is amplified using a power am­
plifier before being transmitted through a transmitting antenna. 
The backscatter coming from a chipless tag is picked up by the receiving an­
tenna of the reader and amplified using a low noise amplifier (LNA). The reader 
design makes use of a GPD to extract the phase and amplitude information from 
the received backscattered signal. The operation of the GPD requires a reference 
signal that serves as the reference with respect to which the gain and phase of the 
received signal is calculated. Here, a coupled signal obtained from the transmitted 
interrogation signal serves as the reference. Because the frequencies considered in 
a typical chipless RFID application lie beyond the S-band, both the reference and 
the received signal are first converted into an intermediate frequency (IF) that falls 
within the operational range of frequencies of the GPD. For this purpose a second 
VCO is used which is also controlled using a sawtooth voltage waveform. The two 
VCOs operate at slightly different frequencies (with a constant frequency gap) in 
order to produce the IF signal. The generation of the IF signals also require mixers 
and low pass filters (LPF). The GPD outputs voltages proportional to the ampli­
tude difference and phase difference between the reference (IF Ref.) and received 
(IF Rx) signals. These output signals are digitized using an analog-to-digital con­
verter and are presented to the digital section of the RFID reader. The digital sec­
tion uses DSP algorithms to filter out any noise present in the data and constructs 
amplitude and phase spectrums using the gain phase information. These amplitude 
and phase spectrums are then simultaneously analyzed and examined to extracting 
the information encoded in them.

In the illustration shown in Figure 6.10, a chipless RFID tag having three C-
sections is used. Here each C-section is considered to be capable of encoding 16 
different frequency-shift and phase deviation bandwidth combinations at the vicin­
ity of a particular resonance frequency. Therefore, when algorithms in the digital 
section simultaneously analyze the amplitude and phase spectrums, they will gener­
ate a 4-bit code for each frequency-phase combination, resulting in decoding of the 
12-bit data contained in the chipless tag.

6.3  Frequency-Polarization Based System 
131
6.3  Frequency-Polarization Based System
This section describes chipless RFID systems that make use of the dimensions of 
frequency and polarization for data encoding. Polarization has been investigated 
as a means of enhancing data capacity in [13, 17, 18]. In [17, 18] a compact high-
data-capacity chipless RFID tag design is introduced that consists of patches loaded 
with horizontally and vertically polarized slot resonators. The elemental encoding 
structures in this tag design are these slot resonators. In the design, the information 
is encoded as sharp amplitude or phase changes in the frequency domain and the 
polarization (vertical/horizontal) is simply used as a means of frequency reuse for 
doubling the data capacity for a given frequency spectrum. Therefore it uses the 
additional dimension of polarization in a limited fashion to achieve better spectrum 
utilization where the elemental encoding structures in either polarization (vertical 
or horizontal) can only each encode a single bit. However, because each patch can 
hold multiple slot resonators in a compact nature, the overall chipless tag design 
is both spatially and spectrally efficient in encoding data. On the other hand, the 
research presented in [13] fully utilizes polarization as an extra dimension together 
with frequency for encoding information. The elemental encoding structure in the 
chipless RFID tag is a split-ring resonator, which has a unique resonance frequency 
and also exhibits a characteristic behavior with the polarization angle of the inci­
dent electromagnetic wave. Therefore, each elemental encoding structure can en­
code information using both polarization angle and resonance frequency.
6.3.1  Resonant and Polarization Characteristics of the Split-Ring Resonator
Figure 6.11 shows the microstrip split-ring resonator (SRR) used as the elemental 
encoding structure in [13]. The resonator gives rise to two resonant modes de­
pending on the polarization of the incident electromagnetic wave. When the gap is 
oriented at the top as in Figure 6.11(a) and the wave is vertically polarized, the half-
wavelength resonant mode of the SRR is aligned with half the perimeter of the ring, 
which gives rise to a lower frequency (f0) resonant mode. When the gap is rotated 
90º as shown in Figure 6.11(b) so that the incident wave is horizontally polarized 
Figure 6.11  SRR having radius R gives rise to two resonant modes (on substrate RO4003): (a) lower 
frequency resonant mode having wavelength λ0 and (b) higher frequency resonant mode λ1.

132

with respect to the gap orientation, the half-wavelength resonance spans the perim­
eter C such that C = 3λ1/2. This gives rise to a higher frequency (f1) resonant mode 
having a shorter wavelength λ1.
The two resonant modes of a SRR having a ring radius of 9.3 mm and a ring 
width of 1 mm (on substrate RO4003) are shown in Figure 6.12(a). When the inci­
dent wave is vertically polarized (polarization angle of 0º), only the lower resonant 
mode, 3.1 GHz, is visible; and when it is horizontally polarized (polarization angle 
of 90º), only the higher resonant mode, 4.6 GHz, is visible. With a 45º polarization 
angle, both resonant modes can be observed together. The behavior of the SRR 
with the polarization angle at these two resonant modes is shown in Figure 6.12(b). 
When the polarization angle of the incident wave is gradually incremented, it is 
observed that both resonant modes show characteristic drops in the magnitude of 
the radar cross section. For the lower resonant mode, this characteristic drop oc­
curs when the polarization angle is 0°, whereas for the higher resonant mode the 
drop occurs when the polarization angle is either –90° or 90º. Figure 6.13 shows 
the behavior of the lower resonant mode with the changing polarization angle and 
how the orientation of the gap in the SRR affects the response. This characteristic 
behavior of the two resonant modes of the SRRs can be readily used for informa­
tion encoding. 
6.3.2  Encoding Information in a SRR Based Frequency-Polarization Tag
From the characteristic nature of the SRR described earlier, it is clear that the orien­
tation of the split/gap of the SRR is pivotal to its behavior with respect to the polar­
ization angle. That is, when the polarization angle of the incident wave matches the 
angle of the gap as shown in Figure 6.13, a significant drop in the RCS is observed 
at the lower resonant mode (f0). This behavior can be exploited for encoding infor­
mation bits as shown in Figure 6.14. Here, the gap is oriented in one of four differ­
ent angles (0º, 45º, 90º, or 135º) for encoding one of four 2-bit data combinations: 
“00,” “01,” “10,” or “11.” In this approach a resonant SRR will encode 2 bits of 
information using polarization in a given resonant frequency. Hence, the complete 
chipless RFID tag can encompass multiple SRRs resonating at different frequencies

for encoding more information. Therefore, the encoding process utilizes both di­
mensions of frequency and polarization. 
The encoding element shown in Figure 6.14 uses the absolute angle of the gap 
orientation for encoding information. One drawback of this method is that if the 
chipless RFID tag is physically rotated, the reading obtained would include both 
the angle of orientation of the SRR gap and the physically rotated angle, causing 
an error in the detection process. The solution to this problem is to include a dedi­
cated reference SRR and use relative angles with respect to the reference SRR for 
encoding information. Figure 6.15 illustrates a 4-bit chipless RFID tag that uses 
three co-centric SRRs having radii R1, R2, and R3. The outermost SRR is used as 
the reference and the two inner SRRs are used to encode 2 bits each. In the scenario 
presented in Figure 6.15, where the tag is rotated, the critical polarization angles 
(where the RCS drops significantly) of the SRRs R2 and R3 are meaningless and do 
not provide any useful information for decoding by themselves without the knowl­
edge of the angle of tag rotation φ. Using the polarization characteristics of the 
outermost SRR, which serves as the reference, this rotation angle can be computed. 
Once the tag rotation angle is found, it is clear that R3 has a critical polarization 
angle of 45º relative to R1, and R2 has a critical polarization angle of 90º relative 
to R1. Therefore, R2 encodes “10” and R3 encodes “01.” If the MSB is assigned to

the lowest frequency and the LSB is assigned to the highest frequency, then the tag 
shown in Figure 6.15 encodes the data “1001.” 
The SSR based frequency-polarization hybrid chipless RFID tag design dis­
cussed here uses the frequency spectrum efficiently since the data encoding is per­
formed using the polarization angle. The encoding is ultimately determined by the 
orientation of the gaps of the SRRs. The number of bits encoded per SRR is de­
termined by the number of polarization angles considered in the encoding process. 
In the example presented in Figure 6.15, only four polarization angles (0º, 45º, 
90º, and 135º) were considered. By increasing the number of polarization angles, 
the number of bits encoded per elemental structure can be further increased, mak­
ing the chipless tag spatially efficient. However, this would increase the receiver 
complexity since the reader is required to detect subtle changes in the polarization 
characteristic in fine resolution.
6.3.3  Chipless RFID Reader for Hybrid Frequency-Polarization Based Chipless 
RFID
To read the hybrid frequency-polarization chipless RFID tag, the reader needs to 
have the ability to transmit and receive signals with different polarizations. This 
can be achieved by using polarization agile reader antennas or through mechani­
cal rotation of the reader antenna setup. However, mechanical rotation of reader

antennas using stepper motors would render the RFID reader bulky and make the 
interrogation process very slow. 
Figure 6.16 shows reader systems for hybrid frequency-polarization chipless 
RFID. A reader system that utilizes dually polarized antennas (vertical and hori­
zontal) in the transmit section and the receive section of the reader is shown in 
Figure 6.16(a). This type of reader is suitable for reading the tag design proposed in 
[17, 18] where the tag consists of horizontally and vertically polarized resonating 
slots. The RF section of the reader is very similar to that described in Figure 6.10. 
Here, two IF received signals are produced for each polarization. These signals are 
then compared against the reference signal in two separate gain/phase detectors to 
calculate the respective amplitude and phase spectrums of each signal. These spec­
trums are then analyzed in the digital section of the reader to determine the data 
encoded in the chipless RFID tag. 
A reader system that employs polarization agile antennas is shown in Figure 
6.16(b). Here, the antennas used for transmitting the interrogation signal and 
receiving the backscatter have the ability to dynamically change their polariza­
tion. One method of achieving polarization agility is by using a dually fed antenna

(vertically and horizontally) and controlling the phase difference of the signals fed 
to the antenna [19]. This technique enables the transmission of vertical, horizontal, 
left-hand circular, and right-hand circular polarized signals. This type of reader sys­
tem is capable of reading the tag designs proposed in [13, 20]. For reading the SRR 
based chipless RFID tags discussed earlier, the reader needs to interrogate the tag 
with a linear polarization and also vary the polarization angle in order to calculate 
the profile of the amplitude versus polarization angle for decoding the informa­
tion contained in the tag. The amplitude of the received signal can be obtained as 
in the previous reader design through the use of a GPD. In [20] a reader design is 
proposed where the transmitter and receiver antennas choose between different 
combinations of polarization and record the response from a chipless RFID tag in 
order to uniquely identify it. 
6.4  Frequency-Time Based System
In this section we explore hybrid chipless RFID systems that make use of the di­
mensions of time and frequency for encoding information. The research on time-
frequency based chipless RFID systems available in the literature is mostly based on 
the group-delay characteristics of microwave structures [10–12, 15, 16]. In these 
designs the encoding mechanism is a frequency-dependent time delay defined by 
the group-delay characteristics of the elemental encoding structure used in the tag. 
Let H(jω) be the frequency domain transfer function of the elemental encoding 
structure, where H(jω) can be defined as:

The group delay, τ(ω), of this system is defined as [21]:

(6.3)
The group delay τ(ω) is a measure of how long it takes for a signal having angu­
lar frequency to transit through the system H(jω). Therefore, by utilizing a system 
having a unique group-delay profile, unique tag ID information can be encoded.
6.4.1  Group Delay Based Frequency-Time Hybrid Chipless RFID
The elemental encoding structure used in the group delay based chipless RFID sys­
tems reported in the literature [10–12, 15, 16] is a group of microstrip C-sections. 
The C-section described here is different from that of Section 6.2.1, which is single 
layer nonmicrostrip design. Each C-section is essentially formed by the end-to-end 
connection of two coupled microstrip transmission lines. In the chipless tag design, 
the microstrip C-sections are grouped and cascaded together and a dispersive delay 
structure (DDS) is constructed. This DDS introduces a frequency-dependent time 
delay [22] to the signals that travel through it. Figure 6.17 illustrates the DDS used 
in [16]. For clarity only one C-section is shown per group in Figure 6.17(a), whereas 

6.4  Frequency-Time Based System 
137
in the actual DDS, multiple C-sections are grouped and closely coupled to enhance 
the group-delay profile as shown in Figure 6.17(b).
The group delay introduced at a particular frequency can be controlled by 
varying the physical dimensions Li, gi, di, and wi of the C-section. The frequency of 
interest where the group delay peaks can be controlled by varying Li. The group-
delay profile of a C-section is periodic with frequency where peaks occur at odd 
multiples of the frequency of interest [16]. 
Let Figure 6.18(a) denote the group-delay profile of the structure shown in 
Figure 6.17(a). The group-delay profile shows three peaks at three distinct frequen­
cies, fL1, fL2, and fL3, which are caused, respectively, by the three C-sections having 
lengths L1, L2, and L3. By varying the parameters of each C-section, the amount 
of group delay at each frequency can be controlled. By increasing the length Li, 
the group delay can be increased; at the same time, however, this causes the cor­
responding frequency fLi to shift to the left or to decrease. On the other hand, the 
group delay can be increased without affecting the frequency by reducing gi and wi. 
Given this group delay profile, let us consider that a modulated pulse is input into 
the structure. The pulse is modulated with a frequency fm. When fm = f0 ,where f0 
is a frequency where the group is a minimum as shown in Figure 6.18(a), the pulse 
traveling through the structure experiences the lowest propagation delay. Whereas 
when the pulse is modulated using the frequencies fL1, fL2, and fL3, the output 
pulse experiences a longer delay since the group-delay profile maximizes at those 
frequencies. The most delay is experienced when fm = fL1 because the highest group 
delay is at the frequency fL1. Figure 6.18(b) illustrates the time of arrival of the 
output pulse, using the envelope of the modulated pulse, for different fm.

C-sections and (b) DDS consisting of closely grouped C-sections.

It is clear from Figure 6.18 that the DDS constructed using C-sections can be 
used to introduce a frequency-dependent time lag for a signal traveling through it. 
This behavior can be readily exploited for encoding information in chipless RFID. 
Next we will discuss two different methods of encoding information by using this 
behavior.
Method I
The first method is discussed in [11, 12, 16] where a discrete set of time lags pro­
duced at a given frequency encodes information bits in each group of C-sections 
in the DDS. Using more discrete levels of time delay for a particular frequency will 
increase the data capacity of an elemental encoding structure. Table 6.1 illustrates 
the coding principle used in [12] where the chipless tag consists of two groups of 
C-sections; each group encodes a single bit. The group delay for a particular fre­
quency is changed by slightly increasing the length of a C-section. A larger group 
delay denotes a data bit “1,” whereas a smaller group delay denotes a data bit “0.” 
Furthermore the LSB is denoted using the lowest frequency and MSB is denoted 
using the highest frequency.

with different frequencies that are output from the DDS.

Figure 6.19 illustrates the time of arrival of the output pulse for different mod­
ulation frequencies fm for the four different binary data combinations of the 2-bit 
chipless RFID tag. Here, the output is tested using two different interrogation in­
put pulses in two steps where each input pulse is modulated with fL1 and fL2, re­
spectively. The interrogation of the chipless RFID tag can also be done using one 
broadband pulse, which encompasses both frequencies of interest, fL1 and fL2. In

such a case, further signal processing needs to be performed to isolate the time lag 
experienced by each frequency from the total output signal obtained.
Method II
The second method uses the DDS to pulse position modulate the interrogation sig­
nal in order to encode information [10, 15]. The interrogation signal is a train of 
pulses in which each pulse is modulated at a different frequency so that each pulse 
will experience a different delay when it passes through the DDS. Figure 6.20 il­
lustrates the encoding principle of this method. The output pulse stream starts to 
appears after a propagation delay of Tp where each individual pulse in the stream 
is offset by slight amounts to the right or left of its intended location due to the 
frequency-dependent delays introduced by the DDS. The encoding principle is such 
that if a pulse is shifted to the right from its intended location, then it represents a 
bit “1”; if the shift is to the left, then it represents a bit “0.” 
Figure 6.21 depicts the complete chipless RFID tag consisting of the encoding 
elements (DDS) and tag antennas required for receiving and transmitting signals. 
The signal antenna design uses the same antenna for receiving and transmitting 
signals. In such a design the interrogation signal is first received by the antenna and 
then passes through the DDS structure where it gets transformed. Afterwards the 
signal reaches the end of the transmission line (which can be either open circuited 
or short circuited) and gets reflected where it travels back through the DDS for a 
second time and gets retransmitted by the same antenna to generate a backscat­
tered signal. In the two-antenna design the signal captured by the receiving antenna 
only travels through the DDS once where it encounters the transmit antenna at the 
end of the transmission line. The two antennas are configured to be in orthogonal 
polarizations to reduce cross-talk between them. Either one of the methods dis­
cussed earlier for encoding information can be used for either of these tag designs. 
The actual signals received at the RFID reader through the wireless medium would 
be different than those illustrated in Figures 6.19 and 6.20 due to the presence of 
Figure 6.20  Pulse position modulation encoding technique for DDS based frequency-time chipless 
RFID [10, 15].

6.4  Frequency-Time Based System

multiple modes in the backscattered signal (antenna mode and structural mode 
[23]). However, the principle of operation would still be the same. 
6.4.2  Non-Group-Delay Based Approaches for Hybrid Frequency-Time 
Chipless RFID
A non-group-delay based chipless RFID system is presented in [9] that relies on both 
time and frequency for its operation. The information is encoded in the frequency 
dimension as sharp changes in the amplitude using spiral resonators. In this design 
the dimension of time is not directly used in the process of encoding information; it 
is used as method of time division multiplexing for efficient spectrum utilization in 
encoding information. That is, information encoded in a given frequency spectrum 
is separated through the use of large time delays. Therefore, the total information 
that needs to be stored in the tag can be broken apart into smaller pieces and en­
coded in the same spectrum of frequency that is separated in time through delays as 
illustrated in Figure 6.22.
From the illustration shown in Figure 6.22, we can see that the frequency spec­
trum spanning f1 to f3 is used to encode 9 bits of data as three 3-bit groups sepa­
rated in time. An example of a physical passive microwave structure capable of 
achieving this process is shown in Figure 6.23. This design was proposed in [9].
The chipless tag shown in Figure 6.23 consists of two transmitted antennas. 
The signal received by the tag’s receiving antenna is divided into two parts by the 
power divider and sent through two paths. A meandering delay line is included 
Figure 6.21  Complete chipless RFID used on C-section based DDS: (a) single antenna configuration 
and (b) two-antenna configuration.

in one path in order to introduce an extra delay to the signal traveling through it. 
Each path is coupled to a bank of spiral resonators in order to encode information 
in the passing signal. The two signals are then retransmitted through the transmit­
ting antennas. The two signals are delayed in time due to the extra delay introduced 
by the meandering transmission line. 
6.4.3  Chipless RFID Reader for Hybrid Frequency-Time Based Chipless RFID
The design of the RFID reader required for reading hybrid frequency-time chipless 
RFID tags can be either frequency domain based or time domain based. In either 
case the analysis needs to be performed in the time domain where windowed Fou­
rier analysis of the time domain backscattered signal is required (particularly in 
the non-group-delay based approaches discussed in Section 6.4.2). Therefore, if a

spectrum.

6.5  Conclusion

frequency domain based reader design is used, the time domain representation of 
the backscatter needs to be obtained through the inverse Fourier transform. 
The reader shown in Figure 6.24 is based on a time domain architecture where 
an ultra-short-duration pulse is used for interrogating the tag. This reader design 
is aimed at reading the group delay based chipless RFID tags discussed in Section 
6.4.1. The raw received backscatter is first sampled and digitized using a fast ana­
log-to-digital converter, shown in inset (A). Next the strong coupled signal between 
the two antennas and the unwanted structural mode needs to be removed through 
windowing [24]. The resulting desired signal is shown in inset (B). This signal is 
then analyzed using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) methods in order to local­
ize the position of specific frequency content along the time axis. An illustration of 
the resulting signal through an analysis using DWT for two frequency components 
in the backscatter is shown in inset (C). The time delay between these frequency 
components reveals the encoded information in the chipless RFID tag. The Fourier 
transform and its inverse (FFT and IFFT) are also two common DSP tools used in 
these types of readers.
6.5  Conclusion
Frequency spectrum and space occupied by a tag are two main resources in any chi­
pless RFID tag design. Because of the limited availability of license-free bandwidth 
and the high cost of licensing frequency bands, spectrally efficient data encoding for 
chipless RFID is vital. 
The typical chipless RFID application demands a tag to be comparable in size 
to existing chipped RFID tags or barcodes. Furthermore, the size of the tag dictates

the cost associated with manufacturing it using conductive ink and substrate ma­
terials. Therefore, spatially efficient data encoding is also of great importance in 
chipless RFID. 
 Hybrid chipless RFID systems make use of more than one dimension for en­
coding information, enabling spectrally and spatially efficient data encoding in 
tags. The elemental encoding structures used in these systems are more efficient 
than elemental encoding structures used in chipless RFID systems that only use a 
single dimension, in terms of space and spectrum usage per encoded information 
bit. This is because they can simultaneously manipulate multiple dimensions to 
store information. 
A comprehensive review of contemporary research on hybrid chipless RFID 
systems is presented where the working principles of different types of hybrid 
chipless RFID systems are discussed. The operation of encoding elements for the 
chipless RFID tags of hybrid systems using the dimensions of frequency-phase, 
frequency-polarization, and frequency-time are analyzed in detail. Through the use 
of novel planar microwave components (C-sections, SRRs, DDSs) and through the 
examination of their characteristic behaviors with different dimensions of interest 
(frequency, polarization, time, etc.) it is possible to innovatively utilize them for 
designing a hybrid chipless RFID tag design.

Antennas for Chipless RFID Readers
7.1  Introduction
The preceding chapters have presented frequency, time, and hybrid domain chipless 
RFID tag reader systems. In all cases these systems encode and decode chipless 
RFID tags in UWB frequency bands. Therefore, the antennas for both tags and 
readers must be designed to cover the entire frequency band of the system. This 
chapter presents such antenna developments. 
Various types of reader antennas for chipless RFID systems are presented in 
the chapter. Antennas are classified in terms of form factors, beamforming types, 
and operating frequency bands. Both planar and wire antennas are used in the 
UWB technology based reader systems. They are disk-loaded monopoles, leaf di­
poles, log-periodic dipole antennas (LPDAs), log-periodic dipole array antennas 
(LPDAAs), and horn antennas. Theories of antenna elements and array analysis 
help in the development of these antennas. The designs and results of these anten­
nas are presented for unlicensed instrumentation, scientific and medical (ISM) mi­
crowave and millimeter-wave frequencies bands. Antennas are designed targeting 
reading the chipless RFID designed in UWB microwave frequencies of 3 to 10.6 
GHz and millimeter-wave frequencies of 22 to 26.5 GHz. All frequencies fall in 
unlicensed UWB bands. Antenna input return losses, radiation patterns, and gain 
are presented to augment the required specifications of readers. Finally, the anten­
nas developed are discussed in terms of their applications to low-cost UWB chipless 
RFID tagging systems.
Antennas are an integral part of a wireless system. They are the “eyes” of 
electronics that allow them to communicate with the outer world. An antenna is a 
conduit between free space and the guided structure. In that sense antennas are also 
called spatial filters or transducers. Antennas are fully passive circuits. However, 
they have gain due to their characteristics of forming radiation patterns in different 
shapes and directions. Antenna gain is directly added to the gain and loss factors of 
microwave active and passive devices, respectively, in the link budget calculations 
for any wireless system. Therefore, effective antenna design is the prime goal for 
an efficient system. 
Antennas can be designed to be reconfigurable and active. The reconfigurabil­
ity is realized in terms of frequency and beamforming. A part of the antenna can be

tuned electronically to obtain frequency reconfiguration. A beamforming network 
in an antenna array can be added to obtain beam agility. Antennas can be made 
active as well by adding an amplifying device integrated into the antenna as is done 
in active filters. Antennas are also used to scavenge DC power by adding a Schottky 
diode and a lowpass filter as the rectifying and filtering circuits, respectively. This 
type of rectifying antenna is called a rectenna [1].
All of these advanced features of different antennas can be incorporated in 
RFID readers to establish efficient wireless links between the tag and the reader 
and to energize some parts of the reader electronics if required1. Readers can refer 
to a previous work on various smart antennas for RFID systems [2]. For the par­
ticular application with chipless RFID systems developed by the authors’ research 
groupMonash Microwave Antennas, RFID and Sensors (MMARS) Laboratories 
at Monash University—the developed tag and reader antennas can be classified 
into the categories illustrated in Figure 7.1. As can be seen in the figure, the devel­
oped antennas can be broadly classified into their physical configurationsplanar 
and nonplanar, beam agility, and operating frequency bands. In terms of form fac­
tors, antennas are developed mainly in microstrip antenna configurations. Some 
antennas are designed in modified wired and waveguide configurations such as 
UWB leaf dipoles, wideband ridge horns and similar structures. These antennas are 
3D in shape.
The efficacy of an RFID reader is highly dependent on the performance of the 
reader antenna. An efficient antenna controls the link margin and the interference 
for a wireless system. This is very vital for an RFID system in which the transmitted

signal from a chipless RFID tag, which is a minute radar target, is returned from 
the tag with a fourth-power reduction in magnitude of the reading distance (R–4), 
where R is the distance between the tag and the reader. Therefore, a slight improve­
ment in antenna gain and directivity plays a significant role in improving reading 
range, accuracy, and localization of the tag. The RFID tag and reader antennas can 
be broadly classified according to three important parameters: (1) form factors, 
(2) beamforming, and (3) frequency bands, as shown in Figure 7.2. In terms of the 
form factors, the antennas are divided into planar and nonplanar configurations. 
Planar antennas are printed circuit board (PCB) based antennas such as microstrip 
patch antennas. Nonplanar antennas are dipoles and their arrays and horn anten­
nas, which are made of wires, coaxial cables, metals, and waveguides, respectively. 
In terms of their beamforming capabilities, antennas are classified into fixed-beam 
and agile-beam antennas. A fixed-beam antenna can be a single-element antenna 
or it can have an array of elements connected to a fixed feed network. Agile-beam 
antennas are phased arrays, switched beam arrays, and adaptive array antennas. A 
detailed account of such antennas can be found in [2]. 
The fixed-beam antenna for the RFID reader is commonplace, and a plethora 
of antenna vendors are selling RFID antennas to cater to the RFID market demand. 
The fixed-beam antenna has a unique radiation pattern. Panel antennas, which are 
microstrip patch antenna arrays, are used as the reader antennas for the most part. 
Most UHF and microwave band RFID readers are equipped with omnidirectional 
or wide-beamwidth antennas in order to include as much area as possible in their 
interrogation zones. Several fixed-beam antennas are also used, and can be com­
monly found in Alien Technology [3] and Omron [4] readers. The fixed-beam an­

logic control to steer their beams. However, they pick up multipath signals and 
interference and are incapable of localizing the tag’s position when receiving tran­
sponders’ backscattered signals. This situation may lead to reading errors during 
interrogations. The smart antenna for an RFID reader can mitigate these problems 
by offering a directional high-gain beam toward the desired tags and nulls toward 
the interferers. Multipath interference makes the reading unreadable even if it is 
within the reading range of the reader. 
A smart antenna can solve the interference problem by electronically control­
ling the main beam emitted from the reader’s antenna toward the desired tags and 
nulls toward the interfering signals. The smart antenna technology incorporated in 
RFID readers reduces reflections from surroundings and thus minimizes degrada­
tion of system performance due to multipath and other undesired effects. A 2 × 
3-element phased array antenna for a UHF universal RFID system was introduced 
in [2]. However, considering the trade-off between cost and performance, fixed-
beam antennas are preferred over agile-beam smart antennas. This chapter covers 
various UWB fixed-beam antennas for chipless RFID readers.
The chapter is organized as follows (also see Figure 7.3). Section 7.2 introduces 
fundamental antenna parameters such as radiation patterns, gain and directivity, 
bandwidth, polarization and axial ratio, input impedance, and array factor. Section 
7.3 reviews the various broadband antennas. Section 7.4 presents design specifica­
tions for chipless RFID reader antennas and practical design procedures. Section 
7.5 presents the design and results of various reader antenna types, followed by ap­
plications and discussion of results in Section 7.6 and a conclusion in Section 7.7.

7.2  Antenna Parameters

7.2  Antenna Parameters
The characteristics of an antenna are defined by a set of parameters. The important 
basic parameters of an antenna are: (1) radiation patterns (beamwidth, front-to-
back ratio, sidelobe levels), (2) directivity and gain, (3) bandwidth, (4) polarization 
and axial ratio, (5) input impedance return loss and voltage standing wave ratio 
(VSWR) and (6) the array factor of an antenna array. The basic antenna parameters 
are defined below.
Radiation Patterns
The radiation pattern of an antenna is defined as the antenna power and field pat­
terns emanating out of the antenna in its radiating modes. An antenna pattern rep­
resents the 3D influential zone of radiation when the antenna is active in both the 
transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) modes. To enhance this understanding, antennas are 
also defined in terms of 3D solid angle (cone angle instead of 2D angular concept). 
From the solid angle one can easily predict the antenna directivity and its patterns.
Figure 7.4 shows a typical radiation pattern for an antenna. As can be seen 
in the figure, the antenna’s mainlobe has a finite half power (3-dB) beamwidth 
that defines the directional property of the antenna. Antennas also have sidelobes, 
which are undesirable in many applications especially for our chipless RFID read­
ers. Sidelobes are inherent properties of antennas and pick up unwanted signals 
from the surrounding interferers. Therefore lower sidelobes are better to avoid 
such unwanted signals being picked up by the antenna2. Antennas also have back 
lobes. For wideband design of slot-type antennas and broadband aperture coupled 
patch antennas, the dimensions of the slots become comparable to half the wave­
length of the design frequency. The slots become resonant with the patch antenna to 
obtain a large bandwidth from these antennas. These slots radiate equally in both 
the front and back directions; hence back lobes become comparable to the front 
lobes. The ratio between the mainlobe and back lobe power levels is defined as 
the front-to-back-ratio (F\B). Antennas also produce nulls in particular intervals in 
2.	
Very small terminals (VSATs) use very low sidelobe antennas to avoid receiving unwanted signals from 
surrounding satellites.

angular positions. If adaptively controlled, such nulls can be used in advantageous 
situations to avoid interference at known positions of interferers. Thus, adaptive 
antennas improve the signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio (SNIR) of a system. 
Directivity and Gain
Directivity represents the directional properties of an antenna and depends primar­
ily on its radiation characteristics. Directivity is defined as the focusing capability 
of an antenna compared to an isotropic radiator. An isotropic radiator radiates 
power uniformly in all directions. However, antennas have losses. The losses make 
antennas less efficient. Some antenna types are quite highly efficient. As an ex­
ample, microstrip patch antennas etched on a low-loss laminate enjoy efficiencies 
as high as more than 90%. The antenna gain is the product of the directivity and 
the efficiency. For an antenna design, the gain is more important to observe than 
the operating frequency band. 
Bandwidth
The bandwidth of an antenna is defined as the frequency band of operation over 
which the antenna operates satisfactorily. Some antennas have a large radiation 
pattern and gain bandwidth compared to the input impedance bandwidth. The 
gain bandwidth is defined as the frequency band over which the gain does not drop 
a certain level compared to its peak value at the center frequency. Usually a 1-dB 
gain drop limits the gain bandwidth. Because most low-profile and planar antennas 
enjoy a much larger gain and radiation pattern bandwidth than the input imped­
ance bandwidth, a designer first attempts to achieve a satisfactory input impedance 
bandwidth. The input impedance bandwidth is defined in terms of a 10-dB return 
loss bandwidth or a VSWR of 2 over the operational frequency band. Therefore, 
for a UWB antenna, a 10-dB return loss and/or 2 VSWR are ensured over the fre­
quency band of 3 to 10.6 GHz. Other bandwidth definitions are also available but 
less common. They include the axial ratio bandwidth (appropriate for the circularly 
polarized antennas), co- and cross-polar level bandwidth, 3-dB beamwidth band­
width, and F/B ratio bandwidth. 
Polarization and Axial Ratio
Polarization of an antenna is defined as the orientation of the antenna’s radiated 
electrical field vector with time. Simple wire antennas such as dipoles and wave­
guide apertures have very definitive polarization. The polarizations of these an­
tennas depend on their physical orientations. For example, if a dipole antenna is 
positioned vertically with respect to the ground, the antenna is vertically polarized. 
The same rules are applied to the waveguide. If the feed pin of the waveguide 
is vertically centered along the wider dimension of the rectangular aperture, the 
waveguide antenna is vertically polarized. Insight regarding the electrical field dis­
tribution of an antenna aperture explains its polarization. When both Tx and Rx 
antennas are in the same polarization, they receive maximum power, and their wire­
less communication is at its most effective. If the antennas are not positioned at the 
same orientation, the antenna loses power in proportion to the square of the cosine 
of the angle formed between the antennas. This loss term due to the mismatch of 
polarization between two antennas is defined as the polarization loss factor. 

7.2  Antenna Parameters 
153
All antennas are inherently elliptically polarized, meaning the electric field vec­
tor in one orientation is larger than that for another orientation. The axial ratio is 
the ratio between these two fields. As defined earlier, linear polarization and circu­
lar polarization are subsets of elliptical polarization. In the linear case the field is 
always in one orientation, as seen, for example, in a vertically polarized antenna, 
where the vertical electric field is most pronounced compared to the field in an­
other orientation. For circularly polarized antennas, the field vector is continuously 
rotated either in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. In the ideal case both 
fields have the same amplitude and 90° phase offset for a circularly polarized an­
tenna. Therefore, the axial ratio is 1 (0 dB). However, in reality a 0-dB axial ratio is 
very hard to maintain over the bandwidth of operation. Therefore, the axial ratio is 
defined as the 3-dB axial ratio bandwidth over the operating frequency band. This 
means the power of one oriented field (say, Ex) is double that for the field oriented 
in the other direction (Ey). 
Antenna Input Impedance
When a practical antenna is designed, a designer always looks at the system per­
spective to determine how the antenna will be used in the particular system. The 
designer always has the goal of making an efficient radiator for both transmission 
and reception. In that respect, impedance matching of an antenna is the prime goal 
of antenna design. As stated earlier, when a designer designs an antenna, the first 
parameter he/she looks at is the antenna input impedance bandwidth. In this regard 
an antenna is always designed with a matching section as an integral part of the 
antenna. The matching section can be as simple as the feed line with a different 
impedance from the antenna’s input impedance or a delicate matching network. 
Details of antenna matching can be found in any antenna textbook. Since antennas 
are reciprocal devices, they behave similarly in both the Tx and Rx modes. There­
fore, the same matching section can be used for both transmission and reception. 
A simple equivalent circuit model of an antenna in a transceiver system is shown in 
Figure 7.5. As can be seen the antenna has an inherent input impedance zAnt (also 
called antenna driving point impedance). The antenna needs to be matched with a 
transceiver of inherent impedance Zo. A matching section is added between the two 
to match the antenna with the transceiver. Once perfect matching of the antenna

over the frequency band of interest is obtained, the designer looks at other param­
eters such as radiation patterns, gain, directivity, and polarization. 
Antenna Array Factor
In many applications, high gain and directivity antennas are needed. In those cases 
an antenna element is severely limited by its low gain and broad beamwidth. The 
antennas can be arranged in linear, rectangular, circular, and spherical grids to make 
arrays. For the chipless RFID reader, a 2 × 2-element broadband dipole array was 
designed to enhance the gain and radiation performance of the antenna [5, 6]. 
For an M × N number of elements planar array, the normalized array factor 
(AF) (to its maximum amplitude) is represented [7] by:

Generally, to avoid grating lobes, element spacing is kept less than the wave­
length of the operating frequency (λ) [7]. However, to optimize mutual coupling of 
radiating elements, element spacing is kept as 0.7 times the wavelength (0.7λ) [8, 
9].

7.3  Review of UWB Antennas
Since the inception of UWB communication technology in February 2002, UWB 
communications devices have gone through tremendous development. UWB anten­
nas have occupied significant space in the development. Various UWB antennas are 
under development. The UWB antennas developed so far can be broadly classified 
in terms of the gain performance: low gain antennas and high gain antennas. Disk-
loaded monopole and printed dipole antennas are low-gain antennas. The dipole 
arrays, log-periodic dipole antennas and arrays, and tapered ridged horn antennas 
are relatively high-gain antennas. Figure 7.7 shows the classifications. The antenna 
reviews are discussed next. 
A historical background and recent development can be found in [10–12]. 
There are many kinds of UWB antennas, including printed disk-loaded monopole 
[13–15], bowtie [16], TEM horn [17], spiral [18], Vivaldi, and biconical [19, 20]. 
Biconical UWB antennas are the earliest type used in wireless communication sys­
tems. There are many variations of biconical antennas, such as finite biconical

antennas and discone antennas [21]. Although they exhibit a broad impedance 
bandwidth [22, 23], due to their metallic structure and bulky size, they are mainly 
used in laboratories. 
Theoretically frequency-independent antennas that provide a constant perfor­
mance over the operating frequency band can be applied to broadband antenna 
design. Log-periodic antennas such as log-periodic slot antennas, log-periodic di­
pole arrays, and log spiral antennas are some of the popular frequency-independent 
antenna types used in practice [24]. However, when such frequency-independent 
antennas are used for communicating UWB pulses, they show unstable phase cen­
ters dependent on frequency. This distorts the radiated pulse waveform [25].
Elliptical-shaped monopole [26, 27] and dipole planar antennas [28, 29] are 
the most common models for UWB communication applications in terms of suit­
able gain, low cost, and low profile, as well as high stability in input impedance 
[23]. A comprehensive study of planar elliptical dipole antennas working from 0.5 
to 6 GHz has been carried out in [27–30]. Triangular and rectangular slots have 
been used to improve the bandwidth performance of semicircular bowtie antennas 
[31, 32]. A planar elliptical dipole has been designed for UWB wireless communi­
cation applications working in the frequency range of 0.75 to 6 GHz [33]. 
The elliptical-shaped dipoles reported in [9, 26, 27] show broadband behav­
ior and have a low profile. Several techniques are used to improve the operating 
bandwidth of the antennas. In [31, 34] exact elliptical shapes are used with the op­
timized ratio of the radii of the major axis and the minor axis. Nazli et al. [26] use 
elliptical-shaped slots inside the elliptical-shaped dipole arms to achieve improved 
bandwidth. Cerny and Mazanek [35] report that elliptical-shaped dipoles exhibit 
a better impedance match with higher impedance feeds (greater than 50Ω). Using 
tapered feed lines and a shorting bridge across dipole arms improves the bandwidth 
[36]. However, most of these antennas have omnidirectional radiation patterns and 
the gains of these antennas are relatively low at approximately 0 to 3 dBi.
When these antennas are attached to walls or metals, their performance can 
be degraded owing to their omnidirectionality. If directional antennas are utilized, 
the degradation of performance due to omnidirectionality can be avoided [37]. 
Further, less power transmission and higher speed can be achieved by the commu­
nication system.
By using antenna arrays, a higher gain and narrower beamwidth can be achieved 
[17, 18]. Several designs have comparatively high gain with a directional radiation 
pattern and show broadband characteristics. One antenna array uses leaf-shaped 
dipole elements and has an operating bandwidth of 4.1 to 10 GHz and fairly high 
gain over the frequency band [38]. However, its physical size is not suitable for a 
chipless RFID reader. A modified elliptical-shaped dipole array reported on in [39] 
uses a balun transformer between the feed network and each dipole element. Thus 
it has a complex structure, although it has a gain of 9 dBi over the frequency range 
of 3.1 to 8.5 GHz. 
The printed antenna arrays discussed in [39, 40] use a broadband feed net­
work with an integrated balun transformer to feed each dipole element. They have 
achieved more than 200% fractional operating frequency bandwidth. Although 
they have 32 elements, the size of the antenna array is fairly small compared to 
those discussed in [35]. However the minimum operating frequency is 6 GHz. Due 
to the fact that broadband dipoles are better matched with higher impedance [35], 

7.4  Practical Design Procedure for UWB Antennas 
157
the designs reported in [41–43] use integrated baluns [44] to feed dipole elements. 
All of the dipole array antennas discussed above use a metallic reflector to achieve 
unidirectional radiation characteristics, thus showing high gains. 
From the above review we can see that there is a broad range of selections for 
UWB antennas for chipless RFID reader systems. In the following section the de­
sign specifications and practical design procedure for UWB chipless RFID reader 
antennas are presented.
7.4  Practical Design Procedure for UWB Antennas
The antenna parameters discussed earlier are used in this section to form the design 
specifications and practical design procedure for an antenna for a specific system, in 
this case a chipless RFID system. A few salient features of a chipless RFID tag and\
or a reader antenna are as follows [45]: 
••
The antenna should exhibit a bandwidth large enough to accommodate as 
many frequency signatures as are needed to encode large numbers of data 
bits. 
••
The radiation pattern of the antenna should be as uniform as possible over 
the entire frequency band of operation.
••
The antenna radiation pattern should be omnidirectional to cover the read­
ing range. 
••
The antenna should offer polarization purity for optimum wireless commu­
nication an sufficient isolation between the Tx and Rx links.
••
The antenna should exhibit a compact, low-profile, planar layout for ease 
of fabrication. 
Table 7.1 lists the design specifications for UWB antennas used with a chipless 
tag and its reader. These design specifications provide guidelines for design engi­
neers as they plan for an appropriate antenna design. First, based on the deploy­
ment environment, the antenna topology is selected.
Figure 7.6 shows a practical design guideline for an antenna. Once the antenna 
application area has been determined and the antenna type selected, the bills of 
materials are formulated. For planar patch antennas, the microwave laminates and 
input connectors are the two prime components to be selected first. For nonplanar 
antennas, wire gauges, metals sheets, and connector assemblies are important. In 
both cases the design guidelines (i.e., the dimensions and antenna configurations) 
are maintained with high precision. High-end software tools with a full-wave elec­
tromagnetic (EM) solver such as CST Microwave Studio, Agilent Momentum, 
Zealand IE3D, and Ansoft HFSS are some of the most popular EM solvers 
in the market. They come with nice graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for precision 
2.5D to 3D design suites for planar and nonplanar antennas. At MMARS we have 
been using CST Microwave Studio for all of our passive design requirements.
Once the antenna configuration and bills of materials have been chosen, the 
next phase is to do the appropriate design based on the theoretical framework and 
associated design parameters such as length, width, and height of various sections

of an antenna. Various layers of the antennas are designed with high precision, 
and appropriate connectivity between layers is examined before the simulation is 
performed. The input ports (sources) of the antennas are connected and appropri­
ate excitation methods suitable for the simulation types are added. The simulation 
goals based on the design specifications are determined in terms of input imped­
ance (10-dB return loss and/or 2 VSWR), bandwidth, radiation patterns, beam­
width, peak gain, gain bandwidth, and isolation between ports for dual polarized 
antennas before the simulation is started.
Once the design of the antenna and the simulation setup are ready, the design 
is simulated with the software tool and the design outcomes are extracted in terms 
of S-parameters versus frequency, radiation patterns, gain versus frequency, and 
surface current plots on the antenna structures. The S-parameters versus frequency 
plots give the antenna input impedance match, which is vital for examining anten­
na performance. The input return loss, which is defined as the negative log of the 
input reflection coefficient (S11), is observed in the first instance. If the input return 
loss is more than 10 dB over the frequency band of interest, the design passes the 
first requirement specification.
Then the other parameters such as radiation patterns in both 2D and 3D, co-
polar and cross-polar components, gain versus frequency, axial ratio versus fre­
quency are observed in the design frequency band. If these parameters are not sat­
isfactory, the surface current plot of the antenna can be analyzed to determine why 
the antenna is not behaving well. Rectification and modifications are made to the 
design to mend the problem and then further simulations are performed. The com­
plexity of the simulation increases with the complexity of the antenna geometry 
and high-end requirement specifications. A systematic approach and appropriate 
planning help to ease the simulation cycles of the antenna design. As shown in Fig­
ure 7.8, surface current plots help to identify problems with the design. Therefore,

it is a good practice to check the surface current plots at times when the desired 
outcome in both input impedance and radiation characteristics is not obtained. 
7.5  UWB Antenna Development 
In this section various UWB antennas developed for chipless RFID readers are pre­
sented. Sequentially they are: (1) disk-loaded monopoles, (2) UWB dipole arrays, 
(3) log-periodic dipole antennas (LPDAs), (4) log-periodic dipole array antennas 
(LPDAAs), and (5) broadband horn antennas. All antennas provide sufficiently 
large bandwidth to sustain multibit tag reading in various UWB frequency bands. 
7.5.1  UWB Disk-Loaded Monopole Antennas 
The most popular UWB antenna is the disk-loaded monopole antenna. It has a 
simple layout and exhibits extremely large bandwidth and a figure-eight radia­
tion pattern [13–15]. A ground plane in the vicinity of the disk-loaded monopole 
emulates dipole-type behavior. UWB dipole antennas have been reported on by 
researchers that have radiation properties and bandwidth similar to those found us­
ing UWB monopoles. Both types of antennas are fully printable and initially appear 
suitable for deployment as chipless RFID tag antennas. According to the definition 
of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), antennas having a bandwidth 
greater than 500 MHz or a fractional bandwidth greater than 0.2 are considered 
UWB antennas [11, 12]. In this regard a disk-loaded monopole outperforms the 
Figure 7.8  Design procedure for chipless RFID UWB reader antennas.

FCC regulation and offers a bandwidth over the entire UWB microwave frequency 
band from 3 to 10.6 GHz.
The chipless RFID tags [45] use circular disk-loaded monopole antennas as 
the Rx and Tx antennas. These monopole antennas have low gain (near 0 dB) 
and omnidirectional radiation patterns. Because the tag antenna gain is low, the 
retransmitted signal with spectral signatures is also weak. If directional antennas 
are utilized as reader antennas, the sensitivity of the reader system can be enhanced, 
and better reading distance can be achieved by transmitting the same amount of 
power. Therefore, the development of UWB antennas with directional radiation 
characteristics and high gain is highly desirable. Antennas with omnidirectional ra­
diation patterns can also be used as reader antennas, but are suitable only for appli­
cations that require a very short reading distance (less than 10 mm), for example, 
secured document authentication. For conveyor belt applications, a clearance of at 
least 100 mm between the conveyor belt and antenna is required because a larger 
reading distance of more than 100 mm is needed.
As stated earlier, UWB disk-loaded monopole antennas are the most popular 
antenna due to their simple configuration and uniform performance over the entire 
UWB frequency band. Because of their low gain, UWB circular and elliptical disk, 
and deformed versions, loaded monopole antennas meet all favorable criteria and 
are used as short-range reader antennas. The only disadvantage is that the antenna 
has a figure-of-eight radiation pattern and losses half the transmitted power in an 
unwanted direction.
Figure 7.9 shows the layouts for three types of disk-loaded monopole antennas. 
As can be seen in the figure, the antenna consists of three important components, 
which play a significant role in antenna performance. They are a circular disk 
with radius R, a feed line of length Lfeed and width Wfeed connecting the disk and 
the source input port, and a ground plane at the bottom side of the substrate with 
length LGnd and WGnd. The gap between the disk edge and the ground plane edge 
influences the input impedance matching of the antenna drastically. Therefore, the 
gap length is a significant design parameter. Both the ground plane and the an­
tenna are supported with a substrate of height h, dielectric constant εr, and loss

tangent tan δ. The antenna radius R is determined based on its fundamental mode 
frequency. A crescent antenna can be designed to reduce the size of the antenna. 
For compatibility with MMIC designs and to achieve low-cost simple fabrication, 
a CPW line feed antenna can be designed. This monoplane design is preferred for 
ease of integration with RF\microwave electronic circuits. 
The UWB disk-loaded monopole antenna operates over its fundamental and 
higher order modes as shown in Figure 7.10. As can be seen, the resonances of 
different modes are closely distributed over the UWB frequency band [13–15, 45]. 
The frequency responses of various modes are overlapping each other and the com­
bined result is a UWB VSWR response at the input port of the antenna. Although 
the fundamental mode frequency of the disk-loaded monopole determines the radi­
us R of the disk and provides an undistorted figure-of-eight omnidirectional radia­
tion pattern, the higher order modes distort the E-field patterns in higher frequen­
cies than that of the fundamental frequency. However, the overall performance is 
broadbeam omnidirectional radiation patterns with a moderate gain of 1 to 2 dBi.
Figure 7.11 shows the input impedance return loss versus frequency plot [45]. 
As can be seen, the input return loss is more than 10 dB over the frequency band. 
Figures 7.12(a) and (b) shows the radiation patterns. Both plots show omnidirec­
tional properties. Figure 7.13 shows the gain versus frequency plots of the antenna.

Antennas for Chipless RFID Readers
Crescent-Loaded Monopole Antenna
There is always pressure to design compact antennas that meet stringent require­
ments, including low cost. In addition, for a UWB impulse radio (UWB-IR) based 
reader, a low structural mode RCS is desirable. A crescent-loaded monopole an­
tenna is designed to address these issues. Figure 7.14 shows such an antenna. As can 
be seen, the results and performance parameters of the antenna are very similar to 
those of a disk-loaded monopole antenna. Some gain patterns need to be sacrificed 
in H-plane radiation patterns and cross-polar level due to the asymmetry of the 
configuration of the antenna.
CPW Feed Disk-Loaded Monopole on Polymer
A CPW feed disk-loaded monopole antenna has been designed and fabricated as 
shown in Figure 7.15(a). Specially made plastic jigs were developed at Monash

their return loss, gain, and radiation patterns. All of the jigs were made of Perspex 
(nonmetallic, clear plastic-like substance) to avoid unwanted reflection. Prior to 
application of the conductive epoxy on the CPW monopole, the applicant should 
make sure that the layer to which the epoxy is being applied is the conductive layer. 
This can be ensured by checking the electrical conductivity using a simple multi­
meter. After the procedure, conductive epoxy is applied in small amounts to both

the ground planes to ensure smooth and continuous connectivity with the ground 
of the SMA connector. Figure 7.15(a) shows a photograph of the polymer antenna 
and Figure 7.15(b) shows the input impedance return loss versus frequency of the 
antenna. As can be seen in Figure 7.15(b), the antenna meets the 10-dB return loss 
bandwidth requirement from 3.5 to 11 GHz. The antenna exhibits a maximum 
gain of 1.5 dBi with a minimum gain of –2 dB due to excess loss of the polymer 
substrate, epoxy glue, and Perspex fixture. The radiation patterns are very similar 
to those for the microstrip line feed disk-loaded monopole antenna.

7.5.2  UWB Dipole Array Antennas
The monopole antennas discussed above are very low gain antennas. They are 
mainly used for tag design and short-range (<5 cm) reader design. More details 
about the design principles, parametric studies, and operations of these antennas 
can be found in [45].
In this section, the detailed design for two linearly polarized, high-gain, low-
profile, UWB dipole reflector antenna arrays is presented. During the process of 
antenna design, two antenna prototypes were developed: (1) the elliptical-shaped 
dipole reflector antenna array, operating in the 4.0- to 6.0-GHz bandwidth and (2) 
the elliptical-shaped printed dipole reflector antenna array, operating in the 3.8- to 
10-GHz bandwidth. Each prototype has a different operating bandwidth and is 
suitable for reading chipless RFID tags operating in different frequency bandwidths. 
The quality factor (Q) of a resonator is defined as the ratio of inductive reac­
tance to the resistance (jwL\R). Resonators with a high quality factor yield nar­
rowband operations, and resonators with a low quality factor yield wideband 
operations. Balanis [7] provided excellent accounts of resonant dipole antennas. 
The thin wire half-wave dipole antenna is a high-Q resonator hence yields narrow 
bandwidth. However, the Q decreases with the wire radius of the dipole. The band­
width versus dipole length to diameter (l/d) ratio of the antenna has been studied 
[7]. As an example, a dipole antenna with a ratio of l/d = 5000 has an acceptable 
bandwidth of about 3%, which is a small fraction of the center frequency. An an­
tenna of the same length but with a ratio of l/d = 260 has a bandwidth of about 
30%. The phenomenon with the Babinet and Rumsey’s principles [7] helps develop 
the concept of designing frequency-independent antennas.
Figure 7.16 shows a generic block diagram for a dipole array antenna in an 
RFID reader system. The RF source (reader electronics) is connected to the antenna 
with a SMA connector and a feed network is used to feed the four elements of the 
array. The design and results of the antenna element, feed network, and the 2 × 
2-element dipole array antenna are explained in the following subsections. CST

Microwave Studio 2010 (CST MWS) software was used for the simulation of feed 
networks and antennas.
7.5.2.1  Design of Elliptical Leaf Dipole 
The design of the elliptical leaf dipole requires the optimum dimensions of the leaf 
to be known in order to achieve the best radiation characteristics and antenna per­
formance. The survey of dipole antennas has shown that modified ellipse shapes 
perform better than exact elliptical-shaped dipole elements. A single-dipole reflector 
antenna was designed and developed to study the effects of different dimensions. To 
find the optimum values for the dimensions of the dipole elements, a single-dipole 
reflector was designed first and parametric study of the dipole elements was carried 
out.
Figure 7.17(a) shows the CST Microwave Studio simulation model used for 
the parametric study to find the optimum values for the dimensions of the dipole 
leaves. Models of leaves were created using 1-mm-thick brass plates. The gaps 
between the two leaves were kept at 2 mm and they were fed with a 75Ω discrete 
port. A metal plate was used as the reflector with h = 12 mm (assuming a center 
frequency of 6 GHz since the required bandwidth is 4.0 to 8.0 GHz) behind the 
modeled dipole elements, as shown in the figure. Figure 7.16(b) shows the impor­
tant design parameters: length (L) and radius (R) of the dipole leaves, with h being 
the reflector distance from the dipole leaves. Figure 7.16(c) shows the prototype 
leaf dipole antenna backed by a reflector.

model, and (c) dipole reflector prototype.

A comprehensive parametric study of the dipole antenna transforms the an­
tenna to its best performance. The following inferences have been extracted from 
the study:
1.	 Resonant frequency decreases linearly with L. Input impedance matching 
also gets better at lower frequency with L.
2.	 Radius R, the width of the dipole leaf, has no influence on the resonant 
frequency. However, R has a significant influence on the input impedance 
matching of the antenna. The 10-dB return loss bandwidth increases al­
most linearly and then is saturated at R = 3 mm (0.06λ) at a 6-GHz center 
frequency. 
3.	 Reflector distance h, the antenna height, significantly influences the input 
impedance matching3. At h = 0.4 λ, the best matching is achieved and it 
plateaus. Otherwise the variation is linear on both sides of h = 0.4 λ.
Table 7.2 shows the optimum design parameters for the antenna after the com­
prehensive parametric study of the antenna. To validate the optimized results, a 
physical dipole reflector antenna was built with the optimized dipole arms and 
reflector distance as shown in Figure 7.17(c). The simulation and measured input 
impedance return loss versus frequency results are shown in Figure 7.18. Measured 
results are in good agreement with simulation results as shown in the figure. 
7.5.2.2  Broadband Feed Networks
After achieving satisfactory performance for the antenna element, the broadband 
feed network is designed. For a 2 × 2-element array antenna, a four-way corporate 
feed network with equal power distributions for individual elements was designed. 
For the applications that require miniature size and large operating bandwidth, 
T-junction power dividers with quarter-wavelength tapered line transformers are 
the most appropriate. A compact size and a wide operating bandwidth for the feed 
network were achieved with T-junctions having tapered transmission lines. The 
feed network is a 1-to-4 equal broadband power splitter. The input impedance of 
the feed network is 50Ω and output ports are transformed to 75Ω, as shown in Fig­
ure 7.19. The feed network was designed on Taconic TLX-8 substrate (εr = 2.50; 
thickness t = 0.5 mm, and loss tangent tanδ = 0.0019). The 10-dB input impedance

Reflector distance also influences the mode of excitation and, hence, the beamwidth and radiation patterns.

return loss bandwidth of 2 to 14 GHz was achieved in both simulations and mea­
surements. Figure 7.19(a) shows the feed network and Figure 7.19(b) shows the 
S-parameters versus frequency plots of the feed design. As can be seen from the 
figure, the feed network yields very uniform insertion loss (S21 and S31 in decibels) 
between the input and output ports and more than 10-dB input impedance return 
loss over the frequency band of 2 to 14 GHz. The comprehensive design of the feed 
network for the antenna is discussed in Chapter 8.

7.5.2.3  Elliptical Leaf Dipole Array
After achieving a satisfactory design and results for the single element and the 
2 × 2-way corporate feed network, the two were combined to achieve the 2 × 2-ele­
ment array. Array analysis was performed to determine the optimum interelement 
distance and optimum mutual coupling between the elements. Once satisfactory 
results from the parametric study and array analysis were achieved, the complete 
array antenna was designed in CST Microwave Studio™, fabricated, and finally 
tested to determine its best performance. 
The parametric study revealed the following facts about the mutual coupling 
and grating lobe behaviors of the array antenna:
1.	 The 10-dB input impedance return loss bandwidth (BW) decreases linearly 
from BW = 6 GHz at interelement distances dx = dy = 0.52 λ to BW = 1 GHz 
at interelement distances dx = dy = 0.68λ and then saturates.
2.	 Input impedance matching also worsens from (44-dB return loss) to 12 
dB in that interval. However, the input impedance return loss of the array 
antenna never goes below 10 dB. 
3.	 At around the height of the antenna h = 0.2λ, BW = 6 GHz and the best 
matching of a 22-dB input impedance return loss is obtained. At h = 0.36 λ 
the return loss reduces to 6 dB and therefore no further study was made.  
Based on the parametric studies, the optimum design parameters are listed in 
Table 7.3. When the dipoles were fed with 50Ω ports, the antenna continued to 
show 2-GHz, -10-dB S11 magnitudes. However, the center frequency of the oper­
ating bandwidth changed and new values for the interelement distance and reflec­
tor distance should be used for the new array. Two dipole reflector arrays were 
designed with 2- and 5.5-GHz operating bandwidths. Optimized values for each 
design parameter for the two versions of the antennas are shown in Table 7.3. 
Figure 7.20 shows the simulated input impedance return loss (S11 in decibels) and 
realized gain for each design.

7.5.2.4  Mechanical Assembly of Antennas
The feed network design is presented in Chapter 8. Here, the summary of design 
specifications for the feed network is shown in Table 7.4. In this section the con­
struction of the antenna is presented. 
The mechanical construction of a 50Ω fed elliptical dipole array was carried 
out as shown in Figure 7.21(a). A prototype antenna is shown in Figure 7.21(b). As 
shown in Figure 7.21(a), the ground plane of the feed network acts as the reflector. 
Due to the complexity of the mechanical construction of the leaf dipoles (they are 
soldered separately with the feeder coaxial cables), the leaf dipoles were etched on 
a thin laminate. Each element is fed with 75Ω semirigid coaxial cable. The feeder 
cables act like supporting posts for the feed network PCB and the dipole array PCB. 
Both PCBs were etched on 0.17-mm, thin Taconic TLX-8 (εr = 2.4, tan δ = 0.0019) 
substrate. The complete antenna and the plan view of the assembly are shown in 
Figures 7.21(c) and (d), respectively.

7.5.2.5  Results
In this section, we present the CST MWS simulated and measured results for the 
antenna designs. 
Results for an Elliptical-Shaped Dipole Reflector Antenna Array with 50Ω Feed
The measured E- and H-plane radiation patterns of the antenna shown in Figures 
7.22(a) and (b) for 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 GHz. The main beams show sum patterns and 
have a 25° to 35o half-power beamwidth over the frequency range. Sidelobe levels 
are below 15 dB from the peak value of the main beam for the frequency range of 
4.0 to 6.0 GHz. Figure 7.23 shows the simulated and measured return loss and gain 
versus frequency of the antenna. Both measured results have good agreement with 
the simulated results. The measured gain is about 2 dB less than the simulated value

for the whole frequency range. This loss is probably introduced by the feed network 
and coaxial cable assemblies used to feed each element.
Results for an Elliptical-Shaped Leaf Dipole Reflector Antenna Array with 75Ω Feed 
The E- and H-plane radiation patterns of the antenna are shown for frequencies 
4.0, 6.0, 8.0, and 10 GHz in Figure 7.24. The sidelobe level becomes – 5 dB at 10 
GHz; and for frequencies below 10 GHz, sidelobe levels are below – 10 dB in both 
the E- and H-planes. The 10-dB return loss bandwidth is 3.8 to 12.5 GHz.
Figure 7.25 shows the simulated and measured input impedance return loss 
and gain versus frequency plots of the antenna. As shown in the figure, the mea­
sured 10-dB input impedance return loss bandwidth is 4.3 to 9.5 GHz, and over a 
9-dBi gain bandwidth is 3.9 to 9.3 GHz. The measured and simulated realized gain 
show good agreement up to 8 GHz. However, a large discrepancy beyond 9 GHz

between the measured and simulated results is observed. Using a balanced and 
unbalanced (balun) feed, this discrepancy in gain performance is minimized [7, 44]. 
Surface Current Distribution
For a wire dipole antenna, the bandwidth of the antenna is limited by its fundamen­
tal mode and higher order mode currents. Therefore, different patterns are observed 
when the antenna operates above its fundamental mode. For the broadband dipole 
antenna, this is not the case. The operating principle can be explained with the help 
of Rumsey’s principle [7]. The elliptical dipole antenna geometry is a function of 
angle and helps overcome the frequency dependency. However, the ground plane 
reflector under the broadband elliptical dipole antenna makes the antenna direc­
tional. Boresight radiation patterns are obtained due to the reflection of the radi­
ated figure- eight field pattern of the leaf dipole from the ground reflector. As stated

before, the distance of the ground reflector from the antenna element has significant 
influence on the input impedance match and radiation patterns. To understand the 
broadband characteristics of the antenna, a comprehensive study on the surface 
current distribution of the antenna elements and the ground plane was made. The 
broadband radiation mechanism is interpreted with the aid of the surface current 
distributions in the leaf dipoles and the ground plane at difference frequencies.
Figure 7.26 shows the CST Microwave Studio simulated surface current dis­
tributions on dipole elements and the reflector plate. With simulated return loss 
and radiation patterns, satisfactory operation of the antenna was observed over 
3.8 to 10 GHz. The sum patterns of the main beam and broadband matching over 
a bandwidth of more than 6 GHz can be explained with the aid of surface current 
distribution on dipoles and the reflector plate as follows:
1.	 The surface current distributions on the elliptical-shaped dipole elements 
confirm their broadband behavior. At lower frequencies (4 to 6 GHz), a 
high current density in a large portion of the dipole elements can be ob­
served. The direction of current on the ground plane (reflector) at 4 GHz 
is opposite that of the currents in dipole elements. However, since the cur­
rent density of radiating elements is high compared to that for the ground 
plane, this opposing current does not distort the radiation pattern. 
Figure 7.26  Surface current distributions of antenna.

7.5  UWB Antenna Development  
175
2.	 At higher frequencies (8 to 10 GHz), the current distribution is confined to 
the outer edges of the dipole elements, as shown in Figures 7.26(e) and (g), 
and the current is opposite in the areas marked with ovals. At this stage, 
dipole elements are not radiating as a conventional λ/2 dipole. The surface 
current distribution on the ground plane is in the direction marked with a 
black arrow. It is confined in the area surrounded by dipole elements and 
contributes to the radiation of dipole elements. The current distributions 
of the grounded reflector plate show that it is also acting like a radiating 
element of the antenna. Therefore, a sum pattern main beam and excellent 
impedance match with moderately high gain over a large frequency range 
were achieved with this compact profile antenna. 
Discussion of UWB Dipole Array
Two new antennas that have two different operating bandwidths, 4.0 to 6.0 GHz 
and 3.8 to 10 GHz, have been designed. Two antennas were fabricated and their 
input impedance return losses and gain were measured. With the utility of surface 
current distribution on the dipole elements and reflector plate, the operation of the 
antennas over a wide bandwidth has been explained. Each antenna shows a gain 
greater than 10 dBi over the operating bandwidth and no discontinuity in the main

beam over the below 10-dB return loss bandwidth (S11 in decibels). The half-power 
beamwidth for each antenna is in the range of 15 o  to 35o over the operating band­
width. All antennas are linearly polarized and suitable for use with the multireso­
nator based chipless RFID tags mentioned in Section 7.6. Using antennas working 
at the 4.0- to 6.0-GHz frequency range, the frequency signature of the chipless tag 
was measured wirelessly to show the suitability of the antennas as reader antennas. 
These antennas were used with one of the chipless RFID reader designs described 
in Chapter 10.
7.5.3  Log-Periodic Dipole Antennas
Log-periodic antennas are one of the most popular UWB antennas. They have a 
low-profile configuration with moderately high gain and uniform radiation char­
acteristics over the frequency band of interest. Since MMARS’ first retransmission 
based chipless tag [45] needed precise alignment with the reader antenna, a very 
compact low-profile antenna was investigated and a compact circular log-periodic 
antenna was the selected design candidate. The advantages of the log period anten­
nas are: (1) very compact in size, (2) low profile, (3) light weight, and (4) moder­
ately high gain with uniform radiation patterns over the UWB frequency band.
A circular LPDA antenna was designed that operates over a wide frequency 
band (4 to 6 GHz). The log periodic dipole array (LPDA) antenna is supposed to 
be a frequency-independent antenna [7] operating over a wide range of frequencies. 
The antenna is supposed to be a comparatively high gain antenna, linearly polar­
ized, and fitted to the chipless RFID reader. The basic principle of operation of 
this antenna is that a few closely resonant dipoles are placed in an array in such a 
way that their resonances overlap; hence, the antenna resonates over a much wider 
frequency band. A microstrip line feed circular planar log period antenna is shown 
in Figure 7.27. 
The main design parameters of a log-periodic antenna are its flared angle α, 
the stem angle β, and the radii of the complementary teeth rn, Rn, and Rn+1. Using 
uniform periodic teeth, the geometrical aspect ratio of the antenna as shown in 
Figure 7.27 is [7]:

Based on this design equation, an LPDA that covers a bandwidth of 3 to 10.6 
GHz can be achieved. Figure 7.28 shows the antenna. As can be seen, the antenna 
is fed at one end of the log-periodic dipole arm, and a tapered matching section 
is extended to the end of the antenna to facilitate the assembly of the coaxial feed 
line.

Figure 7.29 shows the simulated input impedance return loss versus frequency 
of the antenna. The antenna shows a 10-dB return loss over a frequency range 
from 4 to 7 GHz. The antenna was designed on 1.5-mm-thick FR4 substrate with 
a dielectric constant of 4.2. Figure 7.30(a) shows the CST-generated coordinate 
system and Figures 7.30 (b), (c), and (d) show 3D gain patterns from 4 to 6 GHz 
in 1-GHz steps. As can be seen, the antenna exhibits omnidirectional radiation pat­

terns (figure-eight) in both the front and back sides with nulls in the elevation zero 
angle (more pronounced in the 5-GHz gain pattern).
Because the antenna loses half of its power in an unwanted direction, similar 
to the dipole reflect array, the circular LPDA antenna is placed in a conical cavity 
to suppress the back lobes and direct the beam in the boresight direction of the 
antenna. The conical cavity backed reflector provides different reflective distances 
for different wavelengths in a smooth transition and thereby a directional and high-
gain beam is obtained in the front side of the antenna.
Figure 7.31 shows the two types of cavity backed circular LPDAs. This com­
plementary design was done to accommodate a right-angle SMA connector while 
creating minimum obstruction to the radiative parts of the antenna and also to pre­
vent the existence of any unknown radiative part (e.g., the cable junction below the 
antenna), especially inside a reflective cup. Figures 7.31(a) and (b) show the back 
and front views of the fabricated antenna PCB of the circular LPDA, respectively. 
As can be seen in Figure 7.31(a) the tapered matching section is connected to half 
of the dipole. The center pin of the SAM connector is soldered at the end of the ta­
pered matching section from the other side of the PCB. As shown in Figure 7.31(b), 
the thick complementary tapered line at the center of the other half of the dipole 
(top view) acts as the ground plane of the tapered matching section on the bottom 
side of the antenna. The stem of the SMA connector, which is the ground of the 
connector, is soldered with the tapered line. The aluminum conical back reflector 
housing is shown in Figure 7.31(c) and the complete assembled antenna is shown 
in Figure 7.31(d). The whole structure was designed and simulated with a discrete 
input port in CST, as shown in Figure 7.31(e). This completes the fabrication and 
assembly of a type 1 antenna with conical back reflector housing.
The type 2 antenna was a compact circular LPDA with tight element spacing 
for much closer frequency resonances. The antenna is backed by a flared cylindrical 
metal cup reflector. Figure 7.31(f) shows the compact assembled antenna. 
Figure 7.32(a) shows the CST simulated return loss and measured S-parameters 
(return loss and insertion loss) of the cavity (cup) backed circular LPDA. In both 
simulation and measurement, the circular LPDA shows good return loss figures over 
a wide frequency band similar to the case for the antenna with the cavity backed

turn loss S11 and S22­ of a pair of tuned cavity backed circular LPDAs and insertion 
lossforward transmission coefficient S21 and reverse transmission coefficient S12. 
The tuning was done for the first time and showed a rise in the return loss centered 
on 5 GHz. The two antennas were placed face to face while attached to the VNA 
and their insertion loss was also measured. The rise in the return loss was reflected 
by a dip in the insertion loss. Further tuning may solve the slight mismatch and 
consequential transmission issues. 
Figure 7.33 shows the simulated and measured radiation patterns for the cav­
ity backed circular LPDA antenna. The patterns yield directional symmetry in both 
the E- and H-planes with an average 3-dB beamwidth of approximately 60°. Figure 
7.34 shows the gain versus frequency plots for the LPDA with the cavity connected 
with the chassis ground. In both cases the antenna exhibits an average 7-dBi gain 
over the frequency band. The antenna was used to encode a 5-bit retransmission 
based chipless RFID tag. The encoded data are presented in Section 7.6.

cavity housings. In chipless RFID reader systems, lightweight, low-profile, planar 
antennas are preferred. In this section a couple of linear log-periodic dipole ar­
ray antennas (LPDAAs) for both microwave and millimeter-wave UWB bands are 
presented. LPDAAs are very common linearly polarized broadband antennas with 
relatively high gain and favorable radiation characteristics. Since the antenna radi­
ates at its end fire direction, it has found many applications in broadcasting and 
receiving operations.
Another advantage of LPDAAs is that both input impedance match and radia­
tion performances (radiation patterns, gain and front-to-back ratio) are essentially

frequency independent over the frequency band of operation. The basic configu­
ration of a log-periodic antenna is similar to any fishbone antenna such as a Yagi 
Uda antenna. The antenna elements gradually increase with a flared angle and are 
fed by a two-wire transmission line, as shown in Figure 7.35. An LPDAA design 
requires three design parameters [7]: geometric ratio τ, angle factor α, and spacing 
factor σ, as shown in Figure 7.35. By defining the desired directivity, the geometric 
ratio τ and spacing factor σ may be easily found from [7].

where fn and fn+1 are the resonant frequencies of the nth and (n + 1)th dipole ele­
ments, respectively. The spacing factor σ defines the separation between the dipole 
elements in order to achieve the desired bandwidth Bs and directivity Do. The terms 
Rn and Rn+1 represent the separation between the nth and (n + 1)th dipole elements, 
respectively, and Ln and Ln+1 are the lengths of the two dipole elements of the nth 
and (n + 1)th orders as shown in Figure 7.35. The above design equations and de­
sign procedure give the dimensions of an LPDAA. Figure 7.36 shows the practical 
design procedure for an LPDAA. 
 Transferring the design into a microstrip PCB introduces a new chapter of prac­
tical realization of the antenna. The practical design procedure (see Figure 7.37) is 
performed in a CAD tool such as CST Microwave Studio, Agilent Momentum, 
or LineCalc and similar EM CAD tools. Design optimization in CAD tool needs 
both fundamental knowledge of antenna theory and specific skills sets for those 
specific CAD tools. In this regard, it is not expected that the optimum design and 
performance benchmark will be attained in one go. Design optimization needs a 
set of goals to be achieved and that should be incorporated in the simulation en­
gine. An iterative process is the common mode of CAD design culture. If the initial 
iteration does not meet the goal, the tuning tools of some advanced level software 
package such as CST Microwave Studio can be used or manual trial-and-error 

7.5  UWB Antenna Development

observations and tuning of design parameters based on the skill set and knowledge 
can be applied. Surface current plots on the designed layout can also be a useful 
tool to verify the root cause of the problem (see, e.g., Figure 7.26). The design can 
be modified based on the perception of surface current plots, and the design can be 
optimized to achieve the required goal. Once the design is optimized, the layout can 
be transferred to Gerber or dfx format for fabrication and production. 
Based on the preceding design equations and design procedures, a comprehen­
sive parametric study was done on the width of the dipoles d, the gap between feed 
lines S, and the geometric ratio τ, leading to the following conclusions:
1.	 Reducing the geometric ratio τ results in a better return loss performance. 
However, it also reduces the antenna gain and the bandwidth. 
2.	 Increasing the gap between feed lines S results in shifting the center fre­
quency to a lower value (shifts to the left), which gives a poor performance 
in the desired frequency band of operation. 
3.	 Increasing the width of the dipoles results in an increase in the bandwidth. 
Based on the parametric study performed on various design parameters, a 
geometric ratio τ of 0.8 to 0.95 yields the most desirable operating param­
eters and the best compromise between them.

4.	 Increasing the width of a dipole d will only have a positive effect on per­
formance. The gap between feed lines S is dictated by the fabrication ca­
pabilities of the milling machine, which is 0.15 or 0.1 mm in our available 
resource (LKPF Milling Machine).
7.5.4.1  Design of Microwave LPDAAs
Based on the design guideline given earlier, two LPDAAs were designed for RFID 
chipless tag readers in the microwave frequency band (2 to 3 GHz) and the milli­
meter-wave frequency band (20 to 30 GHz). Figure 7.38 showsa photograph of an 
LPDAA designed for the microwave frequency band. The design parameters for the 
microwave LPDAA are as follows:

Results for Microwave LPDAA
Measurements were performed for the input impedance return loss versus frequency 
plot, gain versus frequency plot, and measured co-polar radiation patterns of the 
microwave LPDAA operating in the 2- to 3-GHz frequency band. The antenna has 
a 10-dB input impedance return loss from 2 to 3 GHz and beyond. The average gain 
of the antennas is 6 dBi and the 3-dB beamwidth is approximately 60° and 40° at 
2.2 and 2.9 GHz, respectively. Significant sidelobes and back lobes are pronounced 
due to the truncated ground plane and edge diffraction of the antenna. More details 
for similar microwave LPDAAs can be found in [45].
7.5.4.2  Design of Millimeter-Wave LPDAA
Here the design and results for a millimeter-wave LPDAA are presented. Figure 
7.39 shows a CST-generated layout for a millimeter-wave LPDAA. The antenna 
was designed on microstrip laminate Taconic TLX0, which has a dielectric constant 
of 2.45 and thickness of 0.5 mm. The dimensions for the 2- to 3-GHz operational 
LPDAA [45] were scaled down by a factor of 10 to obtain the initial structure of 
the 20- to 30-GHz LPDA. The dimensions of the antenna are 1 cm × 2.5 cm × 1.6 
cm. The connector is a 2.4-mm air core flange coaxial connector.

Results of Millimeter-Wave LPDAA
The antenna was measured with an Agilent E8361A PNA with full two-port er­
ror correction calibration. This instrument can measure microwave and millimeter-
wave signals from 10 MHz up to 67 GHz with high precision. Figure 7.40 shows 
the input impedance returns versus frequency plot of the antenna. As can be seen in 
the figure, the prototype antenna shown in Figure 7.39 yields a 10-dB return loss 
bandwidth throughout the design operating range of 20 to 30 GHz.
Figure 7.41 shows the CST simulated gain patterns for 20, 25, and 30 GHz. 
The realized gain of the antenna gradually increases from 6 to 10 dBi from 20 
to 30 GHz. Due to the unavailability of a rotary joint at that frequency range, it 
was not possible to measure the gain pattern in the anechoic chamber. However,

the forward transmission of the antenna was measured with a millimeter-wave 
4 × 4-element microstrip feed aperture coupled patch antenna array in the Monash 
University anechoic chamber, as shown in Figure 7.42(a). The realized gain de­
rived from the results of the forward transmission measurement is shown in Figure 
7.42(b). Taking measurements in the reflection-free anechoic chamber ensures the 
true performance of the LPDAA. As can be seen in Figure 7.42(b), the gain gradu­
ally increases with frequency.

Concluding Remarks for Millimeter-Wave LPDAA
The millimeter-wave LPDAA was designed as a scaled-down version of the micro­
wave frequency LPDAA (also reported in more details in [45]). The antenna pro­
vides consistent input impedance return losses, antenna gain patterns, and realized 
gains over the design frequency. A few important parametric studies over the design 
parameters help to convert the design to its optimum performance. The antenna 
exhibits an average 8-dBi gain over the frequency band from 20 to 30 GHz.

7.5.5  UWB Horn Antennas
An exponentially tapered ridged horn antenna is present in this section. The benefits 
of UWB horn antennas over other antennas are mainly their superior performance 
in terms of wider frequency bandwidth, high gain, and directivity. However, the 
manufacturing process of a horn antenna can be complicated due to the mechanical 
properties of the metal (K-factor and bending radius of the tapered ridges), which 
will affect the performance of the antenna due to the shift in its overall dimension. 
Furthermore, the high-precision manufacturing process is both costly and time con­
suming. The UWB horn antenna comprises mainly three parts: (1) a waveguide 
launcher, (2) a pair of tapered ridges, and (3) the horn itself. Figure 7.43 shows a 
cross section of the antenna, with these three parts showing. This section provides 
the design of an antenna that operates over the 3- to 12-GHz frequency band.
7.5.5.1  Design of Exponentially Tapered Ridge
The design of the tapered ridge is the most vital part for achieving the desired UWB 
performance. Each part of the tapered ridge provides different impedances as it pro­
gresses, starting with 50Ω at the feeding point to 377Ω at the end of the antenna. 
Thus a wideband matching over the desired frequency band is achieved. 
The variation of the impedance can be expressed using the following equations

Antennas for Chipless RFID Readers
In the current design L = 0.4λ is selected, where λ is the smallest wavelength 
corresponding to the highest frequency of 12 GHz. Based on the design calculation, 
an exponentially tapered section is designed. Figure 7.44 shows the geometrical 
layout of the tapered section with dimensions. The total length of the section is 70 
mm. Each taper has a uniform width of 7 mm. The corresponding lengths of the 
sections in millimeters are tabulated in Figure 7.44. The exponential contour of the 
taper section is also shown in the figure.
7.5.5.2  Design of Waveguide Launcher and Cavity Back
The design of the waveguide launcher is the means for excitation of the horn an­
tenna. The wideband matching of the launcher ensures efficient transfer of energy 
from the microwave source to the antenna. The short circuited cavity backing is 
very crucial for providing the perfect match with the horn antenna [46–49]. The 
overall dimensions of the waveguide launcher with its feed assembly (coaxial con­
nector) and the short circuited cavity backing yield the perfect match for the an­
tenna. A common practice to achieve the lowest possible input return loss from the 
transition from the feeder to waveguide is to apply a cavity backing, as shown ear­
lier in Figure 7.43. Therefore, it is vital that the overall length of the short circuited 
cavity backing be optimized. The ridge thickness will influence initial impedance, 
Z0. Therefore, it is important to match its impedance with the feeder rod imped­
ance (the inner conductor of the coaxial cable), which is 50Ω, to ensure the high­
est possible input impedance return loss, which results in perfect input impedance 
matching of the antenna. 
To simplify the fabrication, the waveguide and the cavity backing are retained 
in the traditional rectangular shape. The overall dimensions of the waveguide are 
a = 40 mm, b = 10 mm, thickness of the ridge w = 3.5 mm, and total length of the 
waveguide launcher l = 20 mm. Figure 7.45(a) shows the cross section of the wave­
guide launcher, and Figure 7.45(b) shows the isometric 3D view with the length of 
the waveguide launcher that ends at the beginning of the tapered ridges.
Based on simulation, the optimum distance for the short circuited cavity back­
ing to waveguide, Lcb, is 10.5 mm, which is approximately λ/4 of the center fre­
quency of 7.5 GHz spanning the 3- to 12-GHz frequency band. This distance of 
short circuited end provides a perfect match for the reflected signal for the entire 
band and reduces reflection loss during the transition from feeder rod to wave­
guide. Figure 7.46 shows the isometric view of the launcher with cavity backing.

The antenna was manufactured in the Monash University ECSE workshop. 
The tapered ridges were welded with the horn. The cavity backing is an integral 
part of the horn antenna4. A SMA connector is added at the end of the horn. Figure 
7.47 shows the manufactured horn antenna. 
7.5.5.3  Results
The complete antenna with the launcher and the horn was designed in CST Micro­
wave Studio. Figure 7.48 shows the CST simulated input impedance return loss ver­
sus frequency plot of the antenna. As can be seen in the figure, the horn antenna has 
a 10-dB return loss bandwidth of 3 to 12 GHz with a slightly lower return loss at 
a couple of frequency points. Improvement of the input impedance bandwidth can 
be achieved by tuning the launcher of the horn antenna. Usually, tuning screws in 
the launcher waveguide are used to tune the input impedance of the horn antenna. 
To examine the operational bandwidth, the radiation characteristics of the horn 
antenna were thoroughly investigated in a CST simulation. Figure 7.49 shows the 
E- and H-plane radiation patterns from 3 to 12 GHz with a 3-GHz interval. As can 
be seen in the figure, the antenna exhibits directional radiation patterns except at 
9 GHz with pronounced high sidelobes. Due to these sidelobes, in both the E- and 
4.	
Such complex fabrication is possible with a 3D printer.

H-planes the antenna suffers a drop in gain. This reduced gain and sidelobes can be 
improved with the modification of side walls (ribbed side walls) on the horn anten­
na. Figure 7.50 shows CST-generated 3D radiation patterns for those frequencies.
Figure 7.51 shows the realized gain versus frequency plot. The realized (with 
50Ω input impedance match) gain of the horn antenna varies from 5.5 to 10.5 dBi 
with a dip to 7 dBi at 9 GHz due to the spread of the mainlobe in the E-plane and 
the sidelobes in the H-plane.
A few commercial tapered ridged horn antennas with excellent antenna perfor­
mance have been acquired by the authors’ research group that work from 1 to 18, 
18 to 40, and 50.0 to 75.0 GHz. The 1- to 18-GHz antenna suffers from similar 
sidelobe and gain issues at the higher end of the frequency band, whereas the other 
two types of antennas provide excellent directional radiation patterns and gain. 
More details on the antenna performance can be found at the manufacturer’s web­
site ( www.ainfoinc.com).

lent radiation performance they are used in the laboratory setting to read chipless

RFID tags. The antennas enjoy UWB input impedance bandwidth, moderately high 
gain directional radiation patterns, extremely favorable isolation between the Tx 
and Rx chains, and a uniform gain profile over the frequency band of interest. These 
advantageous features of horn antennas result in error-free and robust readings of

chipless tags. A few examples of the use of horn antennas as a reader’s antenna in 
laboratory settings can be found in [45, 50]. 
So far five different varieties of UWB antennas in both planar and nonplanar 
configurations have been discussed. The planar antennas are disk-loaded mono­
poles and LPDAAs and the nonplanar antennas are leaf dipole arrays, cavity 
backed LPDAs, and exponentially tapered ridged horn antennas. These antennas 
are used in chipless RFID reader systems to read multibit chipless RFID tags. In the

dicated in the plots.)

following section applications for the UWB antennas that have been developed are 
described. 
7.6  Applications
So far various chipless RFID reader antennas have been discussed. The antennas are 
used in reading the tags using microwave measuring equipment and readers built 
in-house. A few examples follow of the reader antennas developed and their uses in 
reading chipless RFID tags in various forms. 
7.6.1  Disk-Loaded Monopoles as Reader Antennas 
A disk-loaded monopole is the most basic antenna that can yield omnidirectional 
radiation patterns and a uniform return loss over the UWB band. Figure 7.52 shows 
the setup for measuring a retransmission based chipless RFID tag using an Agilent 
E8361A PNA at Monash University. As can be seen, two monopole antennas are 
connected with the two ports of the PNA. The chipless RFID is placed 1 to 2 cm 
above the antennas. The display of the PNA shows the frequency signature of the 
chipless tag. The four frequency resonances of the 4-bit chipless tag are clearly vis­
ible on the PNA’s display. The monopole antenna can be used in a touch-and-go 
reader. 
7.6.2   Elliptical Leaf Dipole Arrays as Reader Antennas
Figure 7.53 shows a similar arrangement for measuring chipless RFID tags using 
high-gain elliptical dipole arrays. To validate the use of the antenna with chipless 
Figure 7.52  Disk-loaded monopoles as near-field chipless RFID reader antennas.

7.7  Conclusion 
201
RFID tags, a chipless RFID tag reader built in-house was used [51]. The antenna 
was connected with the two antenna ports of the reader (not shown in Figure 7.53). 
This measurement shows the suitability of the antenna for use as a reader antenna 
on a chipless RFID tag reader.
7.6.3  LPDAAs as Reader Antennas
Figure 7.54 shows the use of a LPDAA to measure a retransmission based chipless 
RFID tag. Results similar to those of Figure 7.53 were achieved at a reading dis­
tance of up to 30 cm with the LPDAA reader antenna. 
7.6.4  Horns as Reader Antennas
At Monash University the broadband horn antennas are also frequently used to 
read various chipless RFID tags. The experimental setup used to read retransmis­
sion based tags is detailed in [45] and hence not reproduced here.
7.7  Conclusion
The chapter presented a comprehensive study of various chipless RFID reader an­
tennas. Classification of the form factors of the antennas based on nonplanar and 
planar antennas resulted in five varieties of broadband antennas for the chipless 
RFID reader systems. All of these antennas were developed at the Monash Uni­
versity RFID and Antenna Laboratory for their in-house chipless RFID reader sys­
tems [51]. The developed antennas cover the UWB microwave and millimeter-wave 
frequency bands. Before, introducing the actual design of these reader antennas, 
basic antenna parameters were defined. These parameters not only helped in de­
veloping fundamental understandings of antenna characteristics but also helped 
in deriving the design specifications for the antennas.  In this regard, antenna gain

and directivity, radiation patterns, bandwidth, polarization, antenna driving point 
impedance, and array factor were defined.
The low-profile and planar antennas are high-Q passive devices hence the input 
impedance bandwidth is much smaller than the radiation characteristic bandwidth. 
Therefore, the antenna design process was initiated with the target of achieving the 
required input impedance return loss bandwidth. Once the return loss bandwidth 
was achieved, the radiation characteristics of the antenna were investigated. The 
surface current investigation using CAD design tools helped our understanding of 
the radiation mechanism of these antennas. It is not a trivial task to design a low-
profile, compact, PCB based antenna with an octave bandwidth. In this regard, 
a practical design guideline for broadband antenna development was presented 
before introducing various developed RFID reader antenna types.
The various planar and nonplanar antenna types discussed were disk- and cres­
cent-loaded monopole antennas, high-gain UWB elliptical-shaped dipole antenna 
arrays, moderate gain compact LPDAs and LPDAAs, and tapered ridged horn an­
tennas. All designed antennas were developed from scratch. A thorough under­
standing of the characteristics of these antennas was achieved through parametric 
studies. These exercises helped in obtaining the optimum design for these antennas. 
Finally, the applications of these developed antennas to the task of reading various 
chipless RFID tags were presented. 
An understanding of the diversity and appropriateness of antenna types for chi­
pless and even conventional RFID readers will benefit design engineers and enrich 
the new field.

Microwave and Millimeter-Wave Active 
and Passive Components
8.1  Introduction
In previous chapters we have discussed chipless RFID technology, principles of op­
eration, and system-level designs. Chapters 2 and 3 described the state of the art 
of chipless RFID tags and chipless RFID readers. In Chapter 4, two reader designs 
were presented that operate in the frequency domain, whereas Chapter 5 presented 
a concept that operates in the time domain. All of the chipless RFID systems de­
scribed so far in this text use a range of passive and active components that operate 
in the microwave or millimeter-wave frequency bands.
This chapter presents information on various passive and active microwave 
and millimeter-wave components used in chipless RFID systems. The chipless RFID 
system is a collection of passive and active microwave components that is arranged 
to perform wireless characterization of a passive tag operating in the microwave or 
millimeter-wave frequency bands. In this chapter the basic operations of different 
microwave and millimeter-wave components are introduced and the applications 
of those components to chipless RFID systems are discussed. Many books provide 
in-depth knowledge about the various microwave passive and active components, 
so the purpose of this chapter is not to impart complete and thorough knowledge 
about these types of components, but to introduce how to use them in chipless 
RFID systems.
Figure 8.1 shows a classification of different passive and active components 
used in chipless RFID systems. The classification is done for chipless RFID tags 
as well as readers. As mentioned in previous sections, the chipless RFID tags used 
in this research work are fully passive and use no active microwave or millimeter-
wave components. A detailed description is given for each component mentioned 
in the figure.

8.2  Passive Components
8.2.1  Antennas
Antennas are used in chipless RFID tags as well as readers. Almost all chipless RFID 
tags or readers described in this book use either one or more antennas. Based on the 
requirements of the chipless RFID system, the properties of the antenna may change 
from one antenna to another. However, the function is still the same: either receiv­
ing or transmitting electromagnetic waves from or onto the free space. As discussed 
in Chapter 7, an antenna is a passive component that converts a wave propagating 
on a transmission line or a cable into a plane wave propagating in free space and

receives waves propagating in free space and converts back to propagation in a 
transmission line.
A wide variety of antennas with varying properties are available. A detailed 
description of several tag and reader antennas that operate in the microwave and 
millimeter-wave frequencies and are used in chipless RFID tags and readers was 
given in Chapter 7. Several designs for antennas that can be used in chipless RFID 
tags and readers were also presented in Chapter 7. 
8.2.2  Filters
Microwave filters are two-port networks used to control the frequency response at 
a certain point in a microwave system. The frequency range that is allowed to travel 
through the filter is called the passband and the other frequencies, which are attenu­
ated, are called the stopband of the filter. The filters have four typical frequency 
responses [1]:
••
Lowpass
••
Highpass
••
Bandpass 
••
Band-reject (band-stop) filters. 
One or more of these types of filters are used in almost all microwave systems. 
Filters are used in both chipless RFID tags and readers. More information on the 
types of filters used in chipless RFID tags can be found in Chapter 2. This section, 
therefore, provides information mainly on the filters that are used in chipless RFID 
readers.
Filter design involves many theoretical approaches: network theory and syn­
thesis, distributed circuit theory, which describes the operation of planar filters, 
and electromagnetic theory. As well as the theory, both practical and technological 
aspects must be considered. The limited space of this chapter is sufficient only to 
introduce the basic operation of different filter categories and the application of 
filters.
The theoretical foundation of the filter design method is derived from the the­
ory of lumped electrical networks. This approach supplies the methods to identify 
the physically realizable networks together with the mathematical formulas to syn­
thesize them. The general representation of a filter is shown in Figure 8.2. Here, 
the filter is considered to be a two-port, loss-free device placed between resistive

loads and a source with an internal resistive impedance of RL and RS, respectively. 
The filter has a function of frequency-dependent transfer of power. As mentioned 
earlier, the frequency band that provides high attenuation is called the stopband, 
and the frequency band that provides low attenuation is called the passband. The 
filter can be characterized by means of the forward transmission coefficient or scat­
tering parameter S21 [2]. The four types of filters classified according to the filter 
responses are described next. 
8.2.2.1  Lowpass Filters
The ideal lowpass filter has zero attenuation in the passband and infinite attenu­
ation in the stopband. In other words, in the passband, the filter provides 0-dB 
power gain and -∞-dB gain in the stopband. Five functions can be used to ap­
proximate this ideal filter function mathematically: Butterworth, Chebyshev, Cauer, 
Bessel, and inverse Chebyshev approximations [2]. Each type of approximation has 
its advantages and disadvantages, which have been well described [1, 2]. Once a 
suitable filter function has been selected, the synthesis is done either using lumped 
elements or distributed inductors and capacitors with pieces of transmission lines.
The lumped element filter design generally works for low frequencies because 
the lumped elements such as inductors and capacitors are available in a limited 
range of values (Figure 8.3). Generally, they are difficult to implement in micro­
wave frequencies as well. In addition to that, in microwave frequencies, the dis­
tances between filter components are comparable with the wavelengths of the op­
erating frequencies. Richard’s transformation [1] is one technique used to convert 
lumped elements into transmission line sections in a microwave circuit. Kuroda’s 
identities are used to separate filter elements by using transmission line sections [1, 
2]. Therefore, the difficulties that arise when attempting filter implementation in 
the higher frequencies of the microwave frequency band can be avoided using this 
technique.
Using this technique, lowpass filters are implemented using pieces of trans­
mission lines as shunt stubs or stepped-impedance techniques. Lowpass filter 
implementation using shunt stubs involves loading a series of stubs in a piece of 
microstrip transmission line section [2, 3] as shown in Figure 8.4(a). The stepped-
impedance method of lowpass filter implementation uses alternating transmission 
line sections with very high and very low characteristic impedance. The stepped-
impedance method of implementation of lowpass filters is more popular than the 
shunt-stub method because it consumes less space in the RF PCB. Figure 8.4(b) 
shows an example layout for a stepped-impedance lowpass filter.

Figure 8.5 shows a lowpass filter [4] implemented with lumped elements that 
has a cut-off frequency of 800 MHz. The figure shows a filter chip on a chipless 
RFID reader board. The measured forward transmission coefficient of the filter 
(S21 parameters) is shown in Figure 8.6.
Other types of filters can be achieved by applying different frequency trans­
formation to the lowpass filters. The application of frequency transformation to 
lowpass filters has been described extensively [2, 3]. The following sections present 
brief discussions about other types of filters.
8.2.2.2  Highpass Filters
By applying highpass transformation to the lowpass filter design equations, we can 
achieve highpass filters as described in [2, 3]. The equivalent lumped element cir­
cuit of a highpass filter is shown in Figure 8.7. Figure 8.8 shows a lumped element 
implementation of a commercially available highpass filter that has a lower cut-off 
frequency than the similar lowpass filter of 730 MHz [5]. The filter is implemented 
on a package similar to the one shown in Figure 8.5.

8.2.2.3  Bandpass Filters
Similar to the highpass filter implementation using the frequency transformation 
method, we can also achieve bandpass filters [2, 3]. The lumped element equiva­
lent circuit of a bandpass filter is presented in Figure 8.9. Similar to the previous 
two types of filters, for lower frequencies, it is possible to achieve the required fre­
quency bands and performance with lumped inductors and capacitors. When the 
frequency increases, it is difficult to achieve satisfactory performance of the filters 
with lumped element implementations.
To address this issue, similar to the lowpass filter implementations with pieces 
of transmission lines, coupled lines and coupled resonators are used. Narrow band­
pass filters can be made using coupled transmission lines. Layouts of two coupled 
line narrow bandpass filters are shown in Figure 8.10. Coupled line filters are very 
popular in RF PCBs, since the same PCB substrate can be used to implement the 
filter without any lumped element. Figure 8.11 shows the measured transmission 
coefficient of a lumped element implementation of a commercially available band­
pass filter [6]. The filter has a passband of 4.2 to 4.7 GHz as shown in Figure 8.11. 
The filter is packaged in a manner similar to that for the other lumped element 
lowpass and highpass filters [4, 5]. 
In microwave receiver sections, sometimes a particular frequency band or a 
single frequency must be selected from the received signal. Therefore, bandpass 
filters are widely used in microwave receivers. 
8.2.2.4  Band-Reject Filters (Band-Stop Filters)
Band-stop filters are used to filter out a particular frequency band from an RF 
signal. The lumped element equivalent circuit of a band-stop filter is shown in 
Figure 8.12. Similar to the highpass filters and bandpass filters, it is possible to 
design band-stop filters by applying a frequency transformation to the lowpass 
filter design equations. Typically, band-reject (band-stop) filters are used to remove 
narrowband interferences in RF or microwave systems. Band-stop filters are exten­
sively used in some chipless RFID tag designs. The multiresonator based chipless 
RFID tags discussed in this book use narrowband band-stop filters to encode data.
As described in previous chapters, the band-stop filter is implemented by load­
ing a microstrip transmission line with a planar spiral. The equivalent circuit for

the spiral loaded microstrip line can be found in [7, 8]. Because the measured trans­
mission coefficient of multiresonator based chipless RFID tags are presented many 
times in various places of this book, the measured results of a band-stop filter is not 
presented in this section. Figure 8.13 presents a spiral loaded microstrip band-stop 
filter section used in a multiresonator based chipless RFID tag.
8.2.3  Couplers
Couplers are another passive microwave component that is used for power divi­
sion. There are three-port and four-port couplers. Directional couplers and hybrid 
couplers [1] can be made to be three or four port according to the requirements of 
the application. Directional couplers are widely used in applications where unequal 
or arbitrary power division is needed. Hybrid couplers have equal power division 
but the phase of the two outputs differs in 90° or 180°. Waveguide-type couplers 
are also available and used in a wide variety of applications. However, in chipless 
RFID systems, waveguide-type devices have very limited or no usability due to the 
requirement of planar circuits or compact size. Therefore, waveguide-type couplers 
are not discussed here and only planar couplers are described in this section.
Commonly used circuit symbols and the basic operation of a directional cou­
pler are shown in Figure 8.14. The port notation and the naming of the ports 
denote the flow of power supplied to the coupler and its basic operation. Power 
supplied to the port is divided among the “through port” and “coupled port.” The 
coupled port has a portion of its power supplied to port 1 and it is denoted as a 
coupling factor. The remainder passes through port 2, the “through port.” In an 
ideal directional coupler, there is no power delivered from port 1 to port 4. There­
fore, it is referred to as the isolated port. In practice, however, the isolated port has 
isolation of –40 dB or less. When the directional coupler is used for unequal power 
division, the isolated port is usually terminated with a matched load. Then only 
Figure 8.13  Spiral loaded microstrip line band-stop filter section used in a multiresonator based 
chipless RFID tag.

Microwave and Millimeter-Wave Active and Passive Components
three terminals are available for use. In most of the commercially available direc­
tional couplers, this isolated port is not accessible and it is terminated internally 
with a matched load as mention before. 
These kinds of couplers are reciprocal and are used to isolate the forward and 
reflected signal paths of RF systems. When the coupler is fed from port 2, port 1 
becomes the through port and port 3 becomes the isolated port. Therefore, port 4 
becomes the coupled port for the input power from port 2, and the power input 
from port 2 is not coupled to port 3. Therefore, a directional coupler can be used 
to identify two signals that travel in opposite directions in a signal path such as 
a forward traveling signal and a reflected signal. In practice, however, due to the 
limitations in isolation between ports 1 and 4, it is difficult to separate very weak 
reflected signals. 
A hybrid coupler is a special type of directional coupler that has a coupling 
factor of 3 dB. However, the coupled port has a 90° phase shift with respect to the 
through port.
Figure 8.15 shows a photo of a coupler used to extract a portion of a trans­
mitted signal in the chipless RFID reader discussed in Chapter 4. The input port 
is connected to the output of the VCO. The through port is directly connected to 
the RF out SMA connector. The isolated port is terminated with a 50Ω resistor as

8.2.4  Circulators
A circulator is a three-port passive device. The circuit symbol of a circulator is 
shown in Figure 8.16(a). The signal entering at port 1 is transferred to port 2. The 
signal entering at port 2 is transferred to port 3. As shown in Figure 8.16(b), in 
an ideal circulator, port 3 is isolated from port 1 and there is no signal flow in the 
direction of port 2 to port 1. In a real-world circulator device, however, typical 
isolation levels are on order of 20 to 30 dB between the ports. 
The most common application of a circulator is to use it in RF transceivers to 
share a single antenna between a transmitter and a receiver section. As shown in 
Figure 8.17(a), the transmitter and receiver sections are connected to port 1 and 
port 3, respectively. The transmitted signal travels toward the antenna as shown in 
the figure. The received signal that travels from the antenna toward the circulator 
is transferred to port 3. In practice, however, using a circulator to share a single 
antenna works for systems that have strong transmitted and received signals. Due 
to the limited isolation levels between ports 1 and 3, the weak received signals that 
are transferred from port 3 to 2 are suppressed by the signals coupled from port 
1. An example application of a circulator that shares a single antenna between the 
transmitter and receiver of a chipless RFID reader is shown in Chapter 4, Section 
4.3.3. Another application of a circulator is shown in Figure 8.17(b). As shown in 
the figure, when port 3 is terminated with a matched load, the circulator acts as 
an isolator that blocks the reverse transmission of the signal from port 2 to port 1.

8.2.5  Power Divider/Combiner
In RF transceiver systems, performing a linear combination of different signals is a 
common practice. The subdivision (into equal or unequal parts) of a signal into dif­
ferent components or the combining of signals from different sources into a single 
one are considered to be linear combinations of signals. The most common power 
dividers (or splitters) or combiners are the Wilkinson power splitter/combiner and 
the T-junction power divider/combiner. In this section, the operation of these two 
types of power dividers and their applications in chipless RFID systems and other 
systems are discussed.
8.2.5.1  Wilkinson Power Divider
The Wilkinson power divider [9] was invented by E. J Wilkinson. The simplest form 
is a three-port passive circuit that is capable of dividing the power incident from 
port 1 into two equal portions between ports 2 and 3 such that all three ports are 
matched. The most important salient property of the Wilkinson power divider is the 
high isolation between output ports 2 and 3. However, the T-junction power divider 
suffers from low isolation at the output ports. Therefore, one output port does not 
affect the other port due to mismatch or any other phenomenon such as signals 
traveling in an opposite direction due to other components attached to the ports. 
Wilkinson power dividers can be further classified into single-section and mul­
tisection dividers. As shown in Figure 8.18(a), the simplest form of the Wilkinson 
power splitter consists of two quarter-wavelength (λ/4) sections and one resistor 
connected between two output ports. The single-stage power splitter has narrow­
band operation since the design is done based on the quarter-wavelength at a par­
ticular frequency. As shown in Figure 8.18(a), just after the input port there is a 
T-junction splitter that divides the RF power into two equal parts, and the imped­
ance of output lines is kept at 2Z0 to obtain good power division and better input 
matching. Using the quarter-wavelength transformer lines, the 2Z0 load impedance 
is transformed into Z0. All three ports are matched and the 2Z0 resistor is applied 
to provide good isolation between output ports and to minimize reflections [9].
The main problem with the single-stage Wilkinson power divider is its narrow 
bandwidth performance, which is not suitable for the operating frequency of UWB 
chipless RFID applications. Several techniques have been used for improving the

bandwidth of Wilkinson power splitters. Parad and Moynihan [10] suggest using 
one fixed resistor and two quarter-wavelength sections of strip lines with different 
impedances. The results of adding stubs to the quarter-wavelength transformer sec­
tion have been reported [11,12]. Using even-mode and odd-mode analysis, Cohn 
[13] shows that the use of multiple fixed resistors with multiple sections of quarter-
wavelength strip lines can improve the bandwidth of operation to a greater degree. 
A schematic diagram of his suggestion for the N-section Wilkinson power divider is 
shown in Figure 8.19. Design equations are given up to the two-stage splitter; due 
to the complexity of the system when the number of stages is greater than two, the 
method to be followed to calculate design parameters is shown and the calculated 
values are given in Table 8.1. An extract of the design impedance and resistance 
values for a three-stage Wilkinson power divider is also given in Table 8.1. In this 
table, normalized resistance and impedance values are given, and f1 and f2 are the 
lower and higher frequencies of the operating bandwidth, respectively.

Z1 = 1.213Z0 and Z2 = 1.639Z0.
Power dividers are often required for feeding antenna array elements. Figure 
8.20 shows a fabricated one- to four-way feed network used to feed a 2 × 2 dipole 
array antenna. As shown in the figure, single-stage Wilkinson power dividers are 
used to feed the four dipole elements. It can be seen that the equal power division 
(–6 dB in S21 parameters) occurs in the frequency band of 5.0 to 5.6 GHz. The frac­
tional bandwidth of proper operation of the power divider network is about 15%, 
can be considered narrowband operation.
Figure 8.21(a) shows a one- to four-way power divider designed to feed a 2 × 
2 dipole array antenna with three-stage Wilkinson power dividers. The measured 
proper bandwidth of operation with –6-dB power division at each port is 2.9 to 6.9 
GHz, as shown in Figure 8.21(b). The fractional operating bandwidth is ~82% and 
it shows the wideband behavior of the multisection Wilkinson power dividers. By 
increasing the number of sections of the Wilkinson power divider, it is possible to 
achieve further wideband operation. However, wideband operation with multiple 
sections is achieved at the cost of the increased area occupied by the power divider.
8.2.5.2  T-Junction Power Divider
T-junction power dividers generally show broadband operation. However, output 
ports are not matched with the input port impedance [1]. The matching of the out­
put ports needs an impedance transformation technique. Quarter-wavelength trans­
formers can be used for narrowband applications. Wideband applications, however,

require different impedance transformation techniques. Using multiple quarter-
wave impedance transformers is the wideband impedance matching method used to 
achieve wideband operation [1]. However, the use of multiple quarter-wavelength 
transformers at the output ports increases the occupied area of the T-junction. The 
use of tapered arms at the output ports is the most efficient method for reducing the 
area occupied by the circuit [14]. In addition to the use of tapered arms, by using an 
array of vias, through the substrates and with stepped microstrip lines, a very large 
enhancement of the bandwidth is possible [15]. In [16] a different approach is taken 
by using a slotted ground plane to improve the bandwidth of operation.
Figure 8.22(a) shows another one- to four-way feed network designed to feed 
the 2 × 2 dipole array antenna. The feed network was designed on Taconic TLX-8 
substrate (εr = 2.4, tan δ = 0.0019, h = 0.17 mm). Tapered arms are used to achieve 
the proper impedance transformations at each arm. As shown in Figure 8.22(b), 
the simulated performance of the feed network shows proper operation in the 2- 
to 14-GHz bandwidth. Since the output port is 75Ω, it was unable to measure the 
transmission coefficients of each port. However, the broadband matching of the 
input port could be observed with the S11 measurement, which is shown in Figure 
8.22(c).
8.2.6  Resonators
Resonators of various forms are used in active and passive microwave design. Reso­
nators are used in filter design, matching networks (e.g., a quarter-wave transformer 
is also a resonant circuit in that sense), oscillator circuits, tuned amplifiers, and 
frequency meters. A detailed description and analysis of various resonator types 
can be found in [1]. Figure 8.23 shows a few microstrip resonators used in chipless 
RFID applications. These resonators are mainly used to characterize the polymer 
and dielectric substrate materials for chipless RFID tags and many passive compo­
nents designs. Some of the passive components are presented in this chapter. As can

be seen in Figure 8.23(a), a line resonator of width W and length L is gap coupled 
with two transmission lines. Usually, the length of the line is an integer multiple 
of the guide wavelength. Figure 8.23(b) shows a circular resonator of diameter D 
gap coupled with two transmission lines. The lines are coupled with the input and 
output ports of a network analyzer to measure the resonant frequency and quality 
factor of the resonators. These parameters yield dielectric properties such as rela­
tive permittivity (dielectric constant), attenuation, and loss tangent of the substrate 
materials. Once the material properties are known, they are used in the CAD tools 
for passive and active circuit design on the materials. Figures 8.23(c) and (d) show 
a parallel gap coupled line resonator and an annular ring gap coupled resonator, 
respectively. Dielectric disk resonators are very high Q devices. A dielectric disk-
loaded transmission line is shown in Figure 8.23(e). This type of high-Q resonator

dimensions and a coaxial line coupled waveguide launcher, respectively. The ta­
pered and rectangular launchers for use with UWB horn antennas were presented 
in Chapter 7. Detailed definitions and the analytical procedure for these resonators 
can be found in [1, 17].
8.2.7  Mixers
A mixer is a nonlinear three-port network. The two input ports are the RF and lo­
cal oscillator (LO) ports; the output is typically called the intermediate frequency 
(IF) signal. Basically, a mixer produces the product of the two input signals at the 
output port. Figure 8.24(a) shows a typical schematic symbol for a mixer. The two 
input ports are fed with signals as shown, and the output port generates the prod­
uct of the two input signals. Figure 8.24(b) shows the basic operation of a mixer. 
As shown in the figure, the signal generated at the IF output port contains the 
frequency components of the sum and the difference of the frequencies of the two 
input signals. In an RF transmitter and receiver, mixers are used for two purposes: 
frequency up-conversion and frequency down-conversion, respectively.
Based on the purpose of the mixer, the out-of-band frequency components gen­
erated at the IF port of the mixers are filtered out. For the frequency down-conver­
sion, a lowpass filter or a bandpass filter is used to filter out high-frequency com­
ponents. For frequency up-conversion, a highpass filter or bandpass filter operating 
over a suitable frequency band is used to filter out the high-frequency components 
of the generated output signal.

Figure 8.25 shows how two mixers are used to down-convert the RF signals 
into a lower frequency signal in a chipless RFID reader RF section. The complete 
block diagram of the reader is shown in Figure 4.5. Here only the RF section is 
shown. The LO signal is divided into two equal portions with a power divider 
and fed into the mixer LO ports. The received signal is amplified and fed into the 
Mixer-1 RF port and a portion of a transmitted signal extracted with a coupler is 
fed into the Mixer-2 RF port. As shown in the figure, two LPFs are used to filter 
out the high-frequency components from the IF output signal. Figures 8.26(a) and 
(b) show two RF mixers operating in the 3.7- to 10.0-GHz frequency range with 
coaxial connector and surface mount packages, respectively. The mixer with the 
surface-mount package as shown in Figure 8.26(b) [18] is used in chipless RFID 
readers, which are discussed in Chapter 4.

Microwave and Millimeter-Wave Active and Passive Components
Two kinds of mixers are available: active mixers and passive mixers. Typi­
cal schematics for these two types of mixers are shown in Figure 8.27. For active 
mixers, an external power supply is required and they are transistor based cir­
cuits. Passive mixers do not require an external power supply and the operation 
is based on diodes. The passive mixers have advantages such as low noise figure, 
wide bandwidth, and low number of components compared to the active counter­
part. However, active mixers have the advantages of low cost, low LO power, and 
higher conversion gain. Therefore, when choosing a mixer for a particular design, 
all of these advantages and disadvantages should be taken into account to achieve 
a better design. 
There are a few important parameters that require the attention of a designer. 
LO injection is the amount of power that should be supplied at the LO port of a 
mixer [2]. As mentioned earlier, active mixers require lower LO injection than pas­
sive mixers. Passive mixers have negative conversion gain and, using active mixers, 
positive conversion gains are possible. The other two important parameters of a 
mixer are the noise figure (NF) and the operating bandwidth. The part counts and 
the cost of the mixer are also important factors that need the attention of a designer.

8.3  Active Components
The components discussed so far have been linear and nonlinear passive compo­
nents. Because their operation does not require an external power supply they are 
referred to as passive components. The components that require an external power 
supply are called active components. Active microwave components can be used for 
many purposes such as detection, mixing, amplification, multiplication, switching, 
and as sources. The list is not limited to these tasks; active microwave components 
and circuits can do much more. Active microwave components are essential in 
building microwave systems. This section presents the basic concepts and operating 
principles for commonly used active microwave and millimeter-wave components 
in chipless RFID systems.
8.3.1  Voltage-Controlled Oscillators
An oscillator produces a periodic output. An oscillator that produces high-fre­
quency signals, which are in the RF range, converts DC power into RF power. It 
produces the high-frequency signals that the other microwave components process. 
Therefore, oscillators are very important in a microwave or millimeter-wave sys­
tem. Various types of oscillators are used in various microwave and millimeter-wave 
systems.
Some of the oscillators are designed to generate a fixed frequency output, 
whereas others are designed to be tuned according to the requirements. Because 
most of the chipless RFID systems operate in a very wide frequency band and 
they encode data in frequency signatures, generation of swept frequency signals 
is required to interrogate the tags. The generation of swept frequency signals re­
quires an electronically tunable oscillator. A voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is 
a tunable oscillator that is used in many applications requiring generation of swept 
frequency signals. A VCO produces a variable frequency output depending on a 
suitable control voltage. The control voltage is sometimes called the tuning voltage. 
In most of the low-cost, compact VCOs, the junction capacitance of a semiconduc­
tor diode (or varactor) is used as the tuning device to control the output voltage 
with the input tuning voltage.
Various oscillator topologies and techniques are used to implement VCOs for 
different applications. The different types of oscillator topologies and techniques 
used to implement VCOs are described in [1, 2]. The other, less frequently used 
techniques are piezoelectric-controlled reactive elements (such as capacitor and in­
ductors) and ferrite resonators (such as YIG resonators) to implement the VCOs. 
In this section only varactor based and YIG resonator based VCOs are discussed 
briefly.
Figure 8.28 shows typical schematics for a varactor tuned transistor VCO. 
The capacitance of the semiconductor junction changes with the applied tuning 
voltage. Therefore, the series RLC circuit changes and results in a change in the 
resonance frequency. The main drawbacks of varactor based VCOs are low tem­
perature stability, low phase noise performance, and less accurate output frequen­
cies. However, low-cost, less complicated implantation and operation and a wide 
tuning bandwidth are advantages of these types of oscillators.

228 
�����������������������������������������������������������
Microwave and Millimeter-Wave Active and Passive Components
Figure 8.29 shows a typical schematic for a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) VCO 
circuit [20]. A YIG sphere is kept inside a magnetic field and the magnetic field is 
changed electronically with the control or tuning voltage of the oscillator. As the 
magnetic field varies, the resonance frequency of the YIG sphere changes. The YIG 
sphere is coupled to transmission lines of the oscillator circuits, and the changes in 
resonance frequency of the YIG sphere result in a varying output frequency with 
the control voltage. 
YIG tuned VCOs consume higher power than varactor tuned VCOs. In par­
ticular, the generation of a varying magnetic field to tune the resonant frequency 
of the YIG sphere requires special driving circuitry that consumes high current and 
several voltage levels. In addition to the higher current consumption, YIG oscil­
lators should be powered up with several voltages levels. Therefore, YIG tuned 
VCOs require complex power supplies. In addition to those disadvantages, YIG 
oscillators require a certain time after the initial power up to warm up the internal 
resonant circuitry. However, YIG oscillators have better phase noise performance 
and better temperature stability of the output frequency signal than do the varactor 
tuned VCOs. High linearity and very wide tuning capability are the most important 
properties of the YIG oscillators. However, they are more expensive and bulky than 
the varactor based VCOs.
The YIG and varactor tuned VCOs have been used in several chipless RFID 
reader designs [21, 22]. The next section presents some measured results for the 
YIG and varactor tuned VCOs used in several chipless RFID reader prototypes by 
the authors.

8.3.1.1  VCOs Operated at Microwave Frequencies
Figure 8.30(a) shows a Richardson RVCD6000F varactor based wideband VCO 
used in a chipless RFID reader [23]. As shown in this figure, the VCO is slightly 
larger than a hermetically sealed transistor. The operating frequency range of the 
VCO is 4 to 8 GHz. The VCO heats up during operation, so a heat sink should be 
mounted for the protection of the device. The full assembly of two VCOs with heat 
sinks is shown in Figure 8.30(b). The variation of frequency with the applied tun­
ing voltage is shown in Figure 8.31. The VCO should be powered up with a 15V 
DC power supply. The tuning voltage range is from 0 to 20 V for the generation of 
4- to 8-GHz frequency output. Based on the experimental results, once the tuning 
voltage is changed to a different value, VCO requires about a 2-ms time to settle 
down and to produce the proper frequency output corresponding to the new tuning 
voltage value.
Figure 8.32(a) shows a Teledyne YIG tuned VCO that is used in the chipless 
RFID readers discussed in [21, 22]. The bunch of wires in the bottom part of the 
photo provides the several voltage levels required for the operation of the VCO. 
Figure 8.32(b) shows the variation of output frequency versus input tuning voltage.
8.3.1.2  VCOs Operated at Millimeter-Wave Frequencies
The generation of millimeter-wave signals is primarily done in two ways. Directly 
using oscillators that generate millimeter-wave frequencies is one method. It is not 
easy, however, to find oscillators that operate in millimeter-wave frequencies and 
they are more expensive. Therefore, to generate millimeter-wave frequencies, the 
technique shown in Figure 8.33 is widely used in millimeter-wave RF systems. 
The output of a suitable oscillator that operates in microwave frequencies is con­
nected to a frequency doubler. Then the output of the frequency doubler provides 
millimeter-wave frequencies. A Hittite HMC733LC4B VCO and Hittite HMC576 
frequency doubler are attached together in a millimeter-wave VCO as shown in 
Figure 8.30  Richardson RVCD6000F varactor based VCO: (a) mounted on a test board before con­
necting the heat sink and (b) two VCOs mounted with heat sinks on a chipless RFID reader RF board.

wave chipless RFID application. The VCO generates a frequency band of 10 to 20 
GHz. With the use of a frequency doubler, the 20- to 30-GHz frequency band is 
constructed. Figure 8.34 shows the variations in the output frequency with the tun­
ing voltage of the setup. Figure 8.35 shows the variations in output power of the 
setup with the frequency. Note that this frequency doubler is an active device and 
it requires a power supply. 
Due to the high output power there is no need for a power amplifier to be 
added at the output of the active doubler. However, when using a passive frequency 
doubler, the conversion loss must be considered. The conversion loss of a passive

frequency doubler may be as high as 10 dB. In such a situation, a power amplifier 
is required at the output of the doubler. It addition to the output power, the har­
monic levels of the output signal of the frequency doubler are very important. If the 
harmonic levels are high at the output frequency, a bandpass filter may be required 
to filter out harmonics. However, in wideband systems, such as the 20- to 30-GHz 
band, sometimes it may not be practical to use a bandpass filter to cover the whole 
frequency band. In such cases a frequency doubler with low output levels should 
be chosen for the design.
Figure 8.33(b) shows the UWB millimeter-wave RF section circuit. The VCO 
and frequency doubler of the interrogation signal generation section are marked in 
the figure. The output of the frequency doubler is directly attached to the output 
RF connector. Figure 8.34 shows the plot of millimeter-wave frequency output 
versus tuning voltage of the setup shown in Figure 8.33(a). As can be seen, linear 
swept frequencies from 20 to 29.5 GHz are generated with variations in the tuning 
voltage (0V to 8V). Figure 8.35 shows the output power spectrum of the millime­
ter-wave frequency generation section of the RF section. As shown in the figure, it 
generates quite stable power that averages 13 dBm over the UWB millimeter-wave 
frequency band of 22 to 26.5 GHz.
8.3.1.3  Phase Locked Loop
In many RF systems, accurate generation of frequencies is essential to meet wire­
less communication regulations and to keep up the performance of the system. In 
a VCO the output frequency generated is defined by the device parameters of the 
circuits for a given tuning voltage. Therefore, a VCO driven only by a tuning volt­
age can be considered to be a free-running oscillator, and the output frequency is 
defined with internal component parameters. The internal component parameters 
change due to factors such as temperature, supply voltage changes, and noise in­
duced by the surrounding environment. Using an external control loop, it is pos­
sible to compensate for the drifts of the frequencies and achieve accurate frequency

generation [24]. A phase locked loop (PLL) is such a negative feedback control loop 
introduced to control the VCO and achieve accurate frequency generation. 
A block diagram of a digitally controllable PLL is shown in Figure 8.36. As 
shown, the output of the VCO is divided with a frequency divider and compares 
the phase of the signal with a reference signal at the phase frequency detector 
(PFD). The output of the PFD is sent through a lowpass filter called a loop filter 
to drive the VCO tuning voltage. Thus, accurate frequency signal generation is

possible. There are chips available such as Texas instruments TRF3785 and Ana­
log devices ADF4350 that have integrated VCOs with a PLL. In such devices it is 
possible to configure the feedback loop by setting different divisions of the output 
frequency of the VCO and the reference signal. Using this digital interface it is 
possible to change the output frequency in discrete steps with accurate frequency 
outputs. In most of the VCOs a digital interface is provided to configure the value 
of the frequency output. Therefore, it is possible to achieve a frequency sweep 
by incrementing the output frequency setting by configuring the PLL periodically 
with suitable time intervals. However, it is difficult to achieve very short frequency 
sweeps due to the time required to lock to the proper frequency output by the PLL 
and the speed limitations of the digital programming interface. 
8.3.2  Low-Noise Amplifiers
Because the received signal is the weakest RF signal in a typical RF system, am­
plification of the signal is required. The performance of an RF system depends 
very much on the performance the RF front-end. Therefore, the amplification of 
these weak signals requires more attention if we are to achieve a receiver that pro­
vides better performance. A general block diagram of a high-frequency amplifier is 
shown in Figure 8.37. There is an input impedance matching network before the 
active device: the transistor. Then before the output another matching network is 
placed to interface the rest of the circuit with the amplified signal. In addition, there 
are input and output biases to keep the transistor in the linear region of operation. 
However, in many real cases matching and biasing circuits share one or more com­
ponents, making it difficult to separate the impedance matching and bias sections.
In any RF receiver front-end, the low-noise amplifier (LNA) is the first circuit 
block after the antenna and bandpass filter if there is any. It is well known that am­
plifiers may add noise to the amplified signal. Since the front-end of the RF system 
deals with relatively weaker signals than are found in other areas, special attention 
should be given to the noise performance of the amplifiers. The LNAs are designed

to add noise as low as possible due to the low strength of the input signals men­
tioned earlier. The amount of noise added by a particular component is given by 
the value of the noise figure. The LNAs should have a low noise figure to perform 
well in the front-end of the RF section. In addition to the low noise figure, the gain 
of the amplifier is also important in amplifying the signal. Generally it is not pos­
sible to achieve the best noise figure and best possible gain at the same time in an 
amplifier design [1]. Therefore, in a LNA circuit some sort of compromise is made 
between gain and noise figure. Most of the chipless RFID systems discussed in 
this book operate in very wide frequency bands. Therefore, LNAs used in chipless 
RFID applications must meet the requirement of being wideband as well. Several 
techniques are used to design wideband LNAs such as compensated matching net­
works, resistive matching networks, balanced amplifiers, and distributed amplifier 
topologies. 
There are many commercially available amplifier ICs for popular frequency 
bands in the market. For applications such as chipless RFID readers, it is conve­
nient to use a suitable IC rather than designing an amplifier from scratch. The Gali 
2+ amplifier IC was used as the LNA in the chipless RFID readers described in 
Chapter 4. Figure 8.38(a) shows the biasing circuit required for the amplifier, and 
Figure 8.38(b) shows an evaluation board and some of the essential components in 
the biasing circuit. The amplifier works up to 8 GHz and provides a gain of 12.8 
dB over the operating band. The noise figure is 4.2 dB. 
In summary, when selecting an amplifier for chipless RFID applications, the 
important parameters that should be considered are operating bandwidth, gain, 
and noise figure. The cost of the device and the size of the device are also important 
factors that must be considered in many applications.
8.4  Discussion and Conclusions
This chapter has presented definitions and basic operating principles for the impor­
tant passive and active components used in microwave and millimeter-wave chipless 
RFID readers. The commonly used microwave and millimeter-wave components in 
chipless RFID systems are resonators, antennas, filters, couplers, power dividers, 
mixers, VCOs, and LNAs. Selection of suitable components for a system is very 
important to achieve the required performance. After deriving the specifications of

the whole system, the next step is selection of the components. When selecting the 
components, designers must pay attention primarily to the following two things:
1.	 Individual performance of the component. Individual performances of the 
components are specific to that component. However, sufficient operating 
bandwidth, insertion, and return losses are common performance indica­
tors for most of the components. In addition to these parameters, other 
specific parameters of different components such as gain, noise figure, and 
phase noise should be considered as mentioned in the text.
2.	 Integration of components into a system. In addition to the individual per­
formance of each component, it is essential to consider the interconnec­
tions of each component. Some components or devices may have limita­
tions in accepting minimum input power or delivering maximum output 
power. If the preceding component is not providing the minimum input 
power or if it exceeds the maximum input power, then the system does not 
work although the individual performances of the components meet the 
specifications of the overall system. Therefore, it is important to select the 
components to meet the requirements of other components while meeting 
the individual performance criteria.
The summarized component selection process for a chipless RFID system is 
shown in Figure 8.39. As shown in the figure and explained earlier, the individual 
performance as well as the interconnectability of the selected components must be 
considered when building a chipless RFID system. This will reduce the number of 
times costly revisions of the design will be required. Because a chipless RFID reader 
comprises RF and digital control sections, the overall performance of the system 
depends on both modules. If the performance of the RF section is not satisfactory, 
even with the highest performance digital hardware, the overall performance of the 
reader system will not be satisfactory. In other words, even with very powerful digi­
tal hardware and signal processing algorithms, if the performance of the RF section 
is poor, the total system performance becomes poor. Most of the time, the perfor­
mance of the RF section has more limitations than the digital section. Very low cost 
digital signal processing hardware with decent performance is now available in the

Digital Module for Chipless RFID Readers
9.1  Introduction
In the preceding two chapters, reader antennas and microwave active and passive 
design considerations were discussed. These two fundamental building blocks form 
the analog physical layer of the chipless RFID reader. However, these two blocks 
have no functional capability or intelligence of their own. The third block is the 
digital control module, which controls the microwave components such as voltage-
controlled oscillator (VCO) and provides the biasing voltages to the active compo­
nents of the RF transceivers such as amplifiers. In this chapter the digital control 
section of the chipless RFID reader is presented. The next chapter discuss the inte­
gration of these fundamental building blocks into a complete chipless RFID reader. 
The digital module of a reader controls the entire operation of the reader. The 
operation could be divided into three functions: (1) transmitter control, (2) receiver 
control, and (3) signal processing and data decoding. The design of the digital 
control section consists of two parts: hardware design and firmware (also called 
middleware) development for controlling the operation of the reader and for de­
coding data.
Several different types of chipless tag designs were reported in Chapters 4, 5, 
and 6. They have a different number of encoded bits varying from 4 to 35 bits. 
Therefore, the digital control section was designed to adapt the reader for read­
ing different types of tags having a different number of encoded data bits without 
changing its hardware configuration. Using this design, 4- and 9-bit tags have been 
successfully read, ad discussed in Chapter 4.
As stated in Chapter 1, the overall chipless RFID system comprises three major 
components: (1) a chipless tag, (2) an RFID reader, and (3) a back-end database 
system or enterprise software. Figure 9.1 illustrates the generic chipless RFID tag-
reader-enterprise software system [1]. Chipless tags are passive and do not have 
any power source of their own. The reader sends an interrogation signal to illumi­
nate the chipless tag. The tag receives the signal through its receiving antenna and 
passes it through its modulation circuit. In a bistatic radar mode, the transmitting 
antenna of the tag sends the encoded signal back to the reader. The reader receives 
this tag-encoded signal and processes it to decode the tag information. Finally, the 

240 
����������������������������������������
Digital Module for Chipless RFID Readers
reader sends the processed tag information to the back-end database system for 
specific applications. 
As stated in Chapters 4, 5, and 6, chipless RFID systems are classified into 
three types based on their techniques of encoding bits in passive tags. The three 
types are (1) time domain based tags [2–8], (2) frequency domain based tags [9–
19], and (3) their hybrids [20]. Time domain based tags are interrogated by sending 
a short-duration pulse and observing the received trains of pulses reflected from 
the chipless tag. Data are encoded in the tag using the time domain reflectometry 
(TDR) principle. Perturbations in the signal flow path at prescribed delays cause 
prescribed modifications of the transmitted pulse shapes at different times.
In frequency domain based tags, data bits are mostly encoded based on the 
absence or presence of resonances originating from the resonating elements located 
within the tag. The tag responds to a broadband interrogation swept-frequency 
signal.
In addition to the two main categories of chipless tagstime domain tags and 
frequency domain tagsanother type is the chipless RFID tag in which two or 
more dimensions such as frequency-phase, frequency-time, and frequency-polar­
ization are used for larger bit encoding in hybrid domain tags. Chapter 6 covered 
these hybrid domain tags. Different reader types are also used to read these tags. 
Chapters 4, 5, and 6 covered various reader architectures for these three types of 
tag reading. All readers use digital control modules to interrogate the chipless tags 
and receive and process the backscatters of the tag into meaningful ID information. 
This chapter covers the detailed design of the digital module of the chipless RFID 
tag reader.  
Figure 9.2 illustrates the detailed functional blocks of a digital control module 
in a chipless RFID reader system [21–23]. As shown in the figure, the digital mod­
ule consists of three parts: (1) digital control board, (2) digital signal processing 
(DSP) board, and (3) middleware. The middleware is a set of instructions installed 
in an FPGA or a microcontroller to control the digital board and the DSP board. 
The functions of the digital module are as follows:
1.	 The digital control section generates the tuning voltage (also called the 
VCO control voltage) and feeds into the VCO to generate swept-frequency 
interrogation signals. The VCO is the heart of the RF transmitter of the 
reader system. The RF transmit (RF-Tx) module comprises a VCO as the 
signal generator, followed by a circulator to protect the VCO from un­
wanted reflection from the reverse path of the transmitter chain, a power

amplifier, and an antenna. The intended interrogation signal is transmitted 
through the reader’s transmit (Tx) antenna. Therefore, the digital control 
section provides the intelligence and control of the transmitter. In addition, 
the bias voltages for the power amplifier in the transmit chain and the 
low-noise amplifier in the receive chain are also obtained from the digital 
module’s power supply unit. This is discussed in detail in a later section.
2.	 The DSP board performs the signal processing of the encoded data that is 
carrying signal that comes back from the tag. This backscatter of the tag is 
received in the receiver (Rx) antenna of the reader. The RF receiver (RF-Rx) 
module performs some operations in sequence such as low-noise amplifica­
tion and down-conversion of the RF backscatter to a baseband signal so 
that the signal can be sampled and processed in the DSP board. The DSP 
module samples the down-converted signal coming from the RF-Rx and 
implements a signal processing algorithm for denoising and tag identifica­
tion on its on-board FPGA or microcontroller. 
3.	 In the case of a mobile chipless tag, the reader antenna needs to track the 
chipless tag during the tag reading process. In such a scenario the antenna 
needs to steer the beam electronically toward the tag so that the tag re­
mains in the reading zone all the time. The digital beamforming network of 
the smart antenna comprises a set of digital phase shifters [23–27]. In this 
case, the digital control section also incorporates the switching electronics 
that digitally control the phase shifters of the antenna array. 
4.	 As shown in Figure 9.2, middleware implemented in an FPGA or a micro­
controller liaises instructions (control and command) between the back-
end database system and the digital control section of the RFID reader. 
In the uplink, from the reader to the tag communication, the middleware 
receives the user’s instructions from the back-end database system and then 
generates control and command instructions for the digital control section. 
In the downlink, from the tag to the reader communication, the middle­
ware receives a tag ID from the DSP module and forwards the ID data of 
the tag to the backend database system for further processing and use.

Digital Module for Chipless RFID Readers
These four steps complete the function of a complete chipless RFID tag-reader-
back-end system for an enterprise application. 
Figure 9.3 shows the organization of this chapter on the digital module. As can 
be seen, the control board that is covered in Section 9.2 is further comprised of 
four submodules: (1) power supply unit (covered in Section 9.2.1), (2) infrared (IR) 
sensor module (Section 9.2.2), (3) RF power supply switching electronics (Section 
9.2.3), and (4) VCO tuning voltage control unit (Section 9.2.4). Section 9.3 covers 
the DSP board. Section 9.4 covers middleware, Section 9.5 covers the performance 
of the digital control section, and Section 9.6 presents conclusions. 
9.2  Digital Control Board
As seen in Figure 9.2, the digital control board has interfaces with middleware in­
stalled in the FPGA and RF module of the reader system. The functional schematic 
of the digital board is shown in Figure 9.4. It consists primarily of the following 
three parts:
••
Power supply unit;
••
IR tag sensor;
••
RF power supply control switch;
••
VCO control voltage generator.
The power supply unit takes a ±12V external power supply and generates all 
necessary power supplies (±12V, ±5V, 3.3V, and GND) for various components of 
the digital control board. The IR based tag sensor senses the presence of a tag in 
the reading zone of the antenna and produces digital 0/1 output. The tag sensor’s 
digital output is used by the power control switch unit to turn on the power sup­
ply of the RF module as well as the VCO control voltage generation part of the

digital control board. The VCO control generation part takes digital input from 
the middleware FPGA and generates one or more VCO control voltages based on 
the RF board architecture.
9.2.1  Power Supply Unit 
In the power supply unit, a switching voltage regulator is preferred instead of linear 
regulators. The operation of linear regulators generates a huge amount of heat, 
which requires large heat sinks for heat dissipation. Furthermore, the large heat 
sinks also occupy a large area of the PCB and increase the overall weight of the 
digital board. The high efficiency of switching regulator removes the need for heat 
sinks for the reader system and thus reduces the overall size of the digital board. 
The chosen switching regulator (see Figure 9.5) will be used to generate 5V DC 
voltage directly from the initial stage 12V DC supply. The 3.3V DC will still be sup­
plied using a linear regulator but no heat sink will be required because the regulator 
only needs to source a small amount of current (maximum: 300 mA). In addition 
to the regulators, proper bypass capacitors are included to the power supply of the 
digital-to-analog converter in order to improve its performance.
9.2.2  IR Tag Sensor 
The digital control board consists of an IR tag sensor interface to sense the pres­
ence of the tag. Figure 9.6(a) shows a Sharp IR sensor. The sensor has a detection

range of up to 80 cm. It generates an output analog voltage corresponding to the 
distance of the object that is being detected. Figure 9.6(b) shows the output voltage 
of the sensor in volts versus the distance of the reflected object in centimeters. As 
can be seen in the figure, the performance is almost invariant for the two cases of 
reflective objects white paper with a reflectance ratio of 90% and gray paper with 
a reflectance ratio of 18%.  
For an RFID tag reader, detecting the presence of a chipless tag within the 
vicinity of the reader is of great interest. Sensing the presence of a tag triggers the 
reader to initiate the reading process, whereas the absence of a tag keeps the reader 
in standby mode thus saving power. Figure 9.7 illustrates the schematic of the IR 
tag sensor circuit. As can be seen in the figure, a comparator along with a potenti­
ometer at the output of the sensor converts the sensor analog output voltage (0V 
or 3.3V) to digital binary data (0/1). The RF supply power control switch uses the 
control output to turn the reader electronics on and off. The potentiometer adds 
a degree of flexibility because it allows the operator to modify the measuring dis­
tance to the reading range of the reader that is of greatest interest. For example, 
if the potentiometer is tuned to yield a 1V output to the noninverting side of the 
comparator, a tag within 28 cm [refer to the graph in Figure 9.6(b)] of the sensor 
will provide a digital “0” (tag present) at the output of the comparator. Any tag 
outside this range will output a digital “1”(no tag present). This decision-making 
capability of the IR sensor provides an additional feature of security to the RFID 
reader. For example, people carrying chipless RFID tagged banknotes would not 
like to be tracking them outside of a definitive distance.

Digital Module for Chipless RFID Readers
9.2.3  RF Power Supply Control Switch 
The RF module consumes a significant portion of the overall supplied power to the 
RFID reader system. Therefore, turning on the power supply of the RF module only 
at the instance when the tag comes within the vicinity of the reader would minimize 
the power rating of the overall reader system significantly. The power supply of the 
RF board would be controlled by using an integrated high-side switch FDC6330L. 
Its schematic is shown in Figure 9.8. As can be seen in the figure, the input power 
supply voltage Vin will be transferred to output voltage Vout if switch control input 
(On/Off port) is on; otherwise, GND will be connected to Vout. The FDC6330L 
switch is capable of sustaining up to 20V of input voltage across its terminals and 
up to 2.3A 
The schematic for the RF power supply control circuit is shown in Figure 9.9. 
The input power supply VCC5 is transferred to the RF module as RFVCC5 only if 
switch control input SENSOR_D is on (output from the IR tag sensor); otherwise, 
GND is connected to the RF VCC5 line and the RF board does not get any supply 
voltage and, hence, goes into the power-saving standby condition.
9.2.4  VCO Control Voltage Generator 
The most significant task for the digital control board is to generate the VCO con­
trol voltage for the RF module. The generated VCO control voltage, also called 
VCO tuning voltage, determines the operating frequency of the RF board. The 
digital control board takes digital input as instructed by middleware that is installed 
in the FPGA and generates analog output voltage corresponding to the digital in­
put with the digital-to-analog (DAC) converter. The analog outputs from the DAC 
are passed through an OP-AMP circuit for noise filtering and isolation to protect 
against any unintended surge propagation between the digital and RF parts of the 
reader system. In this implementation a serial input DAC is used and interfaced

through its output terminals. The output current handling capability of the switch suffices also as the 
current rating of the RF transceiver board. The RF board uses approximately 500 mA of current for 
its successful operation.

with Altera FPGA general-purpose input/outputs (GPIOs). The schematic of the 
middleware installed FPGA pins and DAC is shown in Figure 9.10 and the OP-
AMP implementation of the DAC output is shown in Figure 9.11.
9.3  Digital Signal Processing Board
As shown in Figure 9.2, the DSP board interfaces with the digital control board, 
RF board, and FPGA-based middleware. The digital control board informs the DSP 
board about the presence of the tag, so that the ADC present in the DSP board can 
sample the RF channel coming from the RF board. If the reader uses a beamforming

smart antenna, then the digital control board also sends beam direction information 
to the DSP board, which can be useful for further processing of digital samples from 
the RF tag signal received from the RF board. However, beam-steering smart anten­
nas are not being used in the current chipless RFID readers. Therefore, this aspect 
of the digital control module is not covered in this chapter. 
The functional block diagram of the DSP board is shown in Figure 9.12. Here 
a two-channel ADC (ADS2807) capable of sampling up to 50 MSPS in each chan­
nel individually is used. The ADC takes only one clock and internally synchronizes 
the sampling of two channels simultaneously. This is a very important feature that 
would be very useful for sampling the I and Q components of an IQ modulator 
based RF system. In an IQ modulation scheme, both the amplitude and phase of the 
RF signal can be captured. The sampled data are passed through the buffer before 
the connection to the FPGA GPIO pins to protect the FPGA from external surges. 
A 50-MHz crystal oscillator is used for the FPGA clock, and PLL is implemented in 
Figure 9.11  OP-AMP circuit for VCO control voltage generation.

the FPGA to generate the clock for the ADC. The DSP board consists of a SRAM 
to store sampled data from the ADC before processing, in case the internal FPGA 
flash memory is not sufficient to store a large number of samples. The DSP board 
also consists of a 52-pin IO header, which would be used for running the switching 
electronics (options for beam-steering antennas). JTAG, AS, and EPCS16 inter­
faces are provided for programming the FPGA to implement signal processing and 
switching electronics control algorithms.  The switching electronics will only be 
used if the reader uses a beam-steering smart antenna.
A custom DSP board is designed and developed as shown in Figure 9.13 and, 
in summary, incorporates the following components: 
••
Altera Cyclone II 2C20 FPGA device;
••
Altera EPCS16 serial configuration device;
••
8-Mbit SRAM;
••
ADS2807 dual-channel ADC, 50 MSPS;
••
Two SMA connectors for receiver interface with ADC;
••
Two user pushbuttons and one reconfiguration pushbutton;
••
50-MHz oscillator for clock source;
••
One 40-pin expansion header and two 10-pin expansion headers for GPIOs
••
Powered by 7.5V with 5V, 3.3V, and 1.2V regulators on board;
••
Two 10-pin expansion headers for external USB Blaster programming and 
user API control: one for JTAG and one for Active Serial (AS) programming 
mode;
••
Three indicator LEDs and two user LEDs.
9.4  Middleware
As mentioned earlier, middleware is a set of instructions that provides all of the 
control and command requirements for a chipless RFID system. The operation of 
the firmware can be divided into two phases: the data acquisition phase and the 
Figure 9.13  PCB implementation of the DSP board.

data decoding phase. During the data acquisition phase, the output frequency of 
the VCO is varied from 4.0 to 6.0 GHz in 1024 steps as described in Section 4.3. 
Then, at each voltage step, the output of the gain/phase detector is sampled using 
the ADC of the digital control section, and sampled values are stored in the RAM.
This procedure for sampling gain and phase voltage data is illustrated in Figure 
9.14. First, a retransmission chipless tag with all shorted spirals is scanned and the 
gain and phase voltage data are recorded on the RAM. This procedure is called 
calibration of the reader. Then the chipless tag to be read is placed and the data 
acquisition phase is repeated to store the sampled voltage values into the RAM. 
During the data decoding phase, a new sample set is generated by taking the dif­
ference of the sampled values of the tag data and calibration data. This new data 
set is then further processed with a simple denoising technique, the moving average 
filtering technique, to smooth the waveform [28]. This filtering technique enhances 
the accuracy of the readings as well as the reading range of the reader. Then the 
firmware starts to search for peaks in the areas according to the number of encoded

9.5  Performance of Digital Control Section

bits and corresponding places to the resonance frequencies of the spirals of the tag. 
Then the peak value is compared with a threshold value and the threshold value is 
determined experimentally. If a voltage peak is found, it is identified as a logic “0,” 
and if there is no voltage peak at the searched range, it is identified as a logic “1.” 
Finally, the result is displayed on the LCD screen and sent to the PC connected to 
the reader. The flowchart for the firmware is shown in Figure 9.14. The firmware 
was developed using the C language and programmed into the microcontroller.
9.5  Performance of Digital Control Section
This section presents some important results on the performance of the digital con­
trol section. Figure 9.15 shows the measured voltage ramp generated by the DAC, 
which is applied to the tuning voltage of VCO or YIG oscillator. Measurements 
were made using an oscilloscope. Figure 9.16 shows the amplitude spectrum of 
the swept frequency interrogation signal generated by the VCO. Measurements 
were taken with an Agilent E4408 spectrum analyzer. As shown in the figure, the 
solid line represents the measured data and the dotted line is the ideal flat output 
expected from the VCO. These two results confirm the accurate generation of an 
interrogation signal by the transmitter. Two retransmission chipless RFID tags hav­
ing 4 and 9 data bits were successfully read with the digital control section. In 
the reading process only the number of sampling points (N) was changed in the 
firmware. Figure 9.17 shows the plot of sampled 10-bit voltage data correspond­
ing to the 4-bit tag-encoded data bits “0000” and “0011.” Sampled voltage data 
for the 9-bit tag obtained from the digital control section are shown in Figure 9.18 
for encoded data bits “000000000” and “010101010.” These results confirm the 
multibit reading capability of the reader.

9.6   Conclusion
This chapter briefly introduced the overall reader structure of the chipless RFID 
system and then explained how middleware controls the reader firmware and inter­
faces the reader with the back-end enterprise software. Detailed descriptions of the 
functional blocks of the digital module of the chipless RFID reader were provided. 
The digital module has three main components: (1) the digital control board, (2) the 
digital signal processing board, and (3) FPGA-based middleware.
The digital control board identifies tag arrival, controls the power supply to 
the RF transceiver module of the reader, and generates the VCO control voltages 
required by the RF module to generate tag interrogation swept-frequency signals. 
In addition, the digital module can have switching electronics in case the reader

uses digital beamforming smart antennas for tracking a moving chipless tag. The 
digital signal processing board receives tag backscatter from the RF receiver mod­
ule, samples it, and processes it for tag identification. It also implements the switch­
ing electronics control FPGA program on its on-board FPGA. The FPGA-based 
middleware controls both the digital control board and the digital signal processing 
board. The middleware also interfaces the reader electronics with the back-end 
user application (enterprise software) that uses tag data. 
The modular design approach to the chipless RFID digital architecture present­
ed in this chapter can be adopted to various chipless RFID reader developments. 
Finally, the design has the potential to handle moving tags or readers or both si­
multaneously with a digital beamforming smart antenna if switching electronics 
are implemented.

RFID Reader System Integration and 
Applications
10.1  Introduction
This chapter describes an integrated chipless RFID reader that can be used for com­
mercially viable applications. Up to this point, the book has described various mod­
ular components and reading methods for chipless RFID readers. The organization 
of chapters of this book is illustrated in Figure 10.1. Chapters 1, 2, and 3 provided 
a general overview of chipless RFID systems, their significance over conventional 
RFID systems, and the different types of chipless RFID tags and readers that have 
been proposed so far in the open literature [1–10]. The reading methods of chipless 
RFID tags can be divided into frequency domain, time domain, and hybrid domain 
reading techniques. These reading techniques are associated with their reader archi­
tectures, which were described in detail in Chapters 4, 5, and 6. The physical layer 
development of chipless RFID readers involves various UWB antennas [13–16], RF 
and microwave components, and analog and digital electronics. To augment the 
reader architecture, Chapter 7 described various types of UWB antennas that can 
be used in chipless RFID readers. The design, fabrication, and measured results of 
the antennas were also provided. Chapter 8 described the design specifications and 
performance evaluation of various active and passive RF components currently 
available on the market. It also presented some in-house designed and fabricated 
passive microwave components and performance evaluations. The digital section 
of the reader was covered in Chapter 9. The digital section of the reader includes 
a digital control board and the digital signal processing board. Both boards are 
loaded with in-house developed control algorithms. DSP algorithms will be pre­
sented in a companion book titled Chipless RFID Reader Signal Processing. This 
chapter discusses how to integrate the components and building blocks that were 
presented in the preceding chapters. 
A chipless RFID system comprises two main components: the chipless tags and 
a reader. Optionally the reader may be connected to a central database system for 
continuous updating of the information. Because RFID technology is an applica­
tion-specific technology, the limitations and constraints of system implementation 
are defined by that application. Even technology wise, the commercially available

RFID Reader System Integration and Applications
chipless tags—RF-SAW, TFTC, SAR-based tags, and radar arrays—are very dif­
ferent from each other. Therefore, the implementation of these tag-reader systems 
should be addressed carefully during the design process of the system. Further, 
there are many constraints due to the limitations imposed by technology or by the 
application itself that should be taken into consideration during the design phase 
of the system as well. This chapter describes the integration of the total chipless 
RFID reader system, design considerations in using different technologies, antenna 
selection, design considerations for chipless tags, and case studies that illustrate the 
type of applications in which chipless RFID tags can be used.
The chapter is organized as follows. A brief introduction of the components 
of a chipless RFID system is presented first. The special requirements, limitations, 
and operating constraints of each component in a RFID system are explained. Then 
two case studies based on probable commercial application scenarios are present­
ed. In the first case study, a short-range, near-field integrated reader with a chipless 
tag is described. For this near-field reader, a maximum reading range of 10 cm is 
targeted. The second case study discusses a long-range RFID reader. A high-gain 
reader antenna with a high-sensitivity RF board is used for achieving the longer 
operating range.

259
10.2  The Integrated Chipless RFID Reader
The components of a generic chipless RFID system essentially consist of four parts:
1.	 Chipless RFID tag
2.	 Reader antennas
3.	 Reader device consisting of an RF section and a digital control section
4.	 Application software or a user interface.
Figure 10.2 illustrates the hierarchy of these main components of a chipless 
RFID system.
As mentioned in Chapter 8, the individual performance of the selected com­
ponents as well as their interconnectability must be considered when building a 
chipless RFID system. This will reduce the number of iterations required for system 
integration and yield the most efficient system. 
10.3  Specifications of a Generic Chipless RFID Reader
This section describes the requirements and constraints of different components of 
a generic chipless RFID system. It also provides some examples of requirements and 
limitations of the chipless RFID reader prototypes described in Chapters 4 and 5. 
Table 10.1 shows the specifications for a chipless RFID reader. The reader operates 
within the UWB frequency band (3.1 to 10.7 GHz) with the FCC power spectral 
density regulation. Depending on the number of data bits and bandwidth require­
ment, a portion of the UWB band can be used. Because UWB interrogation with 
circular polarization over the UWB band is hard to achieve, the system is designed 
based on linearly polarized (LP) antennas. This makes the reader orientation-de­
pendent like an LP RFID system. However, for reading the retransmission chipless 
tag, two orthogonal linearly polarized reader antennas are required. The gain of the 
antennas depends on the reading range of the reader.

RFID Reader System Integration and Applications
10.3.1  Chipless RFID Tag
Chapter 2 provided a comprehensive review of various types of chipless RFID tags. 
Except RF-SAW tag, all tags are in the research phase. Commercial success of these 
RFID tags will need some time. Monash University–developed retransmission based 
chipless RFID tags comprise two orthogonally polarized antennas connected to a 
section of multiresonator as the data encoding device. Although this tag is bulky, 
it provides supreme performance with a good reading range (60-cm reading range 
with10-dBm power). It has been used to demonstrate the operation of the inte­
grated chipless RFID tag reader. 
10.3.2  Reading Techniques
Antennas are used in two components of the chipless RFID system. Tags use one or 
more antennas to receive and transmit the interrogation signal and data encoded 
signals. Reader devices require antennas for transmitting (Tx) and receiving (Rx) 
signals from the tags being interrogated. The most important required feature is the 
operating bandwidth of the antennas. The operating bandwidth of both tag and 
reader antennas should cover the entire bandwidth of the data encoding circuits 
of chipless tags to utilize the full capacity of the tag. The radiation pattern is also 
important depending on the application. An omnidirectional radiation pattern is 
preferred for tag antennas so that the placement of reader antennas is flexible. A 
directional antenna is preferred for a reader antenna to achieve a large reading dis­
tance and less interference from the surrounding environment and tags. However, 
these specifications may vary with the application.
For time domain based RF front-ends, the reader antennas used should be 
capable of transmitting ultra-short-duration RF pulses with minimal distortion to 
pulse shapes [13, 14]. A linear phase response and constant gain are two desirable 
properties of an antenna used for the transmission of ultra-short-duration pulses. 
Conical antennas, TEM horns, and monopole antennas are some of the commonly 
used antennas for the transmission and reception of time domain RF impulses. For 
short-distance applications that require a higher degree of freedom in tag place­
ment, such as tap-and-go credit card applications where the embedded RFID tag 
can be placed in front of the reader antenna at a random orientation by a user, 
antennas having a wider 3-dB beamwidth are required. The wider beamwidth is 
particularly useful in rectifying the ill effects caused by the shorter distance to the 
object being interrogated; that is, a small linear translation of the object causes 
a large angular deviation at the reader. For applications demanding large range, 
directive antennas need to be employed. High-gain antennas such as horns and 
patch antenna arrays can be used for long-range applications. The high directivity

of these antennas, however, reduces the dimensions of the readable zone of the 
reader, so the reader will be unaware of an RFID tag placed outside of this zone. 
As a solution to this problem, the Tx and Rx antenna setup, which gives rise to this 
readable zone, needs to be mechanically or electronically steered. This will move 
the readable zone, enabling the reader to scan for chipless RFID tags in its vicinity. 
Aspects of Tx and Rx antenna design were introduced in Chapter 7.
In addition to the operating bandwidth, beamwidth, and gain of the reader an­
tennas, proper alignment is also essential to achieve proper reading of chipless tags. 
The requirement for proper alignment of tags arises from the type of polarization 
that the tag and reader antennas have. The basic requirement for proper reading 
of a tag is that the tag should be placed in a polarization-matched condition in the 
zone of the 3-dB beamwidth of the Tx and Rx antennas. Furthermore, the proper 
use of polarization in the Tx and Rx antennas is required for the proper interroga­
tion process. For example, most of the tag designs discussed in this book use linear­
ly polarized antennas. Therefore, the best pair of Tx and Rx antennas is a linearly 
polarized antenna pair. When using linearly polarized antennas, the polarization of 
both tag and reader antennas must be known and the antennas aligned accordingly.
Figure 10.3 shows a possible alignment for chipless RFID reader antennas with 
a tag that has separate Tx and Rx antennas to achieve the best tag reading results. 
Figure 10.4 shows the reading setup of the tag. Two tea leaf shaped dipole reflec­
tor array antennas are placed in parallel with the orthogonally polarized antennas 
of the tag [13]. Thus, both tag and reader antennas ensure the lowest possible 
polarization losses between the Tx and Rx chain of them and improved cross-talk 
between the two.
In the experimental setup for the dual-planar arrangement as shown in Figure 
10.4, two dipole reflector array antennas were attached to the two ports of the 
Agilent E8361A PNA vector network analyzer. The frequency signatures of the chi­
pless tags were recovered successfully as shown in Figure 10.5 for two different tag 
IDs: “000000000” and “100110101.” The maximum read range with this setup 
was 15 cm in the interference environment. 
Figure 10.6 shows a second alignment of a tag and two monopole reader 
antennas. This arrangement can be termed a uniplanar reading alignment. Here

orthogonally polarized reader antennas can be placed on the same plane for com­
pact reader design (i.e., a paralleled reader). Although the disk-loaded monopole 
antenna yields omnidirectional radiation in parallel with the feed line, the two 
reader antennas do not directly couple signals between the two antennas since they 
are kept perpendicular to each other to achieve maximum isolation.
Figure 10.7 shows the reading of chipless RFID tags with monopole antennas. 
The alignment of tags with reader antennas as shown in Figure 10.6 was used with 
reader type 2 (uniplanar setup) in this setup. The recovered amplitude and phase 
responses of the 9-bit chipless RFID tags with the chipless system with two mono­
pole reader antennas are shown in Figures 10.8 and 10.9, respectively.
Another chipless RFID system configured to read printed chipless RFID tags is 
shown in Figure 10.10. Here two monopole antennas were used as reader antennas

and connected to the reader as shown in the figure. The interaction between the 
two antennas is minimal since the gain is low, and above the circular disk of the 
monopole antenna, there is a null in the radiation pattern. Because the printed tag 
antennas have very low gain, it is not possible to read larger read ranges. A read 
range up to 5 mm with transmitted power of 10 dBm (10 mW) is possible with this 
setup, and this system is suitable for applications where touch card–type reading is 
required. Figure 10.11 shows the comparison of amplitude response measurements 
for a 1-bit printed chipless tag taken from the Agilent E8361A PNA and type 1 
reader. The reader is capable of identifying the proper resonant frequency. Due 
to the lower sampling frequency resolution used in a type 1 reader, the measured 
result does not provide the proper shape for the amplitude response. This can be

However, after digitization and display, correct detection of the tag was achieved.
10.3.3  Reader Device
As mentioned in previous chapters, reader devices comprise two major sections: 
an RF section and a digital control section. There should be good interconnectivity 
between the sections to achieve the desired output. The following description of 
these two sections provides information on important parameters that should be 
considered during the integration of the modules into a system.

10.3.3.1  RF Section
The RF front-end should be well separated and shielded from the other sections of 
the reader in order to minimize the interference and the noise affecting it. The RF 
front-end consists of colocated Tx and Rx sections that, respectively, transmit an 
interrogation signal to illuminate the chipless RFID tag and receive backscattered 
signals from the tag. The theory behind the reader’s RF front-end was introduced 
in detail for frequency domain and time domain RFID readers in Chapters 4 and 
5, respectively.
The technology of the RF section plays an important role in the performance of 
the chipless RFID system. The frequency domain reader design, which is presented

in Chapter 4, uses a frequency-swept continuous wave for interrogating the tags. 
This reader architecture requires a large time for the interrogation process com­
pared to a time domain based system, which transmits an ultra-short-duration burst 
of RF energy for interrogating the tag. On the other hand, the time domain reader 
design requires careful synchronization and timing together with complex digital 
processing algorithms in order to implement high-speed acquisition and digitiza­
tion of the received time domain backscattering signal. Therefore, the time required 
for processing the acquired signal may be longer in a time domain reader system 
than in a frequency domain reader. Generally, even compared with a fast signal 
processing unit to digitize analog signals in the frequency domain, a time domain 
reader would still prove to be faster than a frequency domain reader. This is due to 
the advantage gained through the quick tag interrogation process in the UWB-IR 
system. In a frequency domain system, the settling time of the voltage-controlled 
oscillator (VCO) proves to be a bottleneck that slows the interrogation process. 
The process can be speeded up by using a VCO with a lower settling time; 
however, this would increase the cost of the overall reader design. Depending on 
the application, the time constraints involved in reading a tag change. For example, 
the time available for reading a chipless tag embedded within a document using a 
handheld reader is longer than the time available for reading moving items on a 
conveyer belt. Therefore, system designers need to consider these constraints when 
choosing the type of technology used for the reader’s RF front-end design.
Another fact that should be taken into account is the data encoding techniques 
used in the tags of the chipless RFID system. If it is essential to obtain both am­
plitude and phase information for the tag to decode data. The best option for the 
RF section is frequency domain based interrogation because it provides an accu­
rate and low-cost method to derive both amplitude and phase information. The 
time domain interrogation technique introduced in Chapter 5 provides only the 
amplitude information and does not provide phase information. If there is a re­
quirement to consider only the amplitude information of tags, either the frequency 
domain or the time domain interrogation technique could be considered for the 
implementation. 
10.3.3.2  Digital Control Section
The digital control section of a chipless RFID reader is explained in detail in Chap­
ter 9. The digital section operates at very low frequencies compared to the RF front 
end. The high-frequency signals received at the RF front-end are ultimately de­
modulated and down-converted to the baseband before they are presented for pro­
cessing in the digital section. The down-converted signals are first analog to digital 
converted in the digital section. Once the analog signals have been digitized into 
binary data bytes, DSP algorithms can be applied to them to extract the frequency 
content of the backscattered signals as mentioned in Chapter 9. 
The fast Fourier transform (FFT) is a commonly used algorithm for this pur­
pose. Other functions for enhancing signal quality such as windowing functions 
that window and separate signals in the time domain, noise filtering functions, and 
computation of statistical averages can also be easily performed with DSP algo­
rithms. In addition to these traditional signal processing techniques, special signal 
processing functions may be required for decoding data as described in previous 

10.3  Specifications of a Generic Chipless RFID Reader 
267
chapters. The digital section can be implemented using either an industrial micro­
controller, microprocessor unit, or a field programmable gate array (FPGA). These 
devices have limited processing capabilities and processing speeds. Therefore, for 
applications that require high computational speed and computationally intensive 
algorithms, the digital section can simply be extended into a digital signal process­
ing board, single board computer, or a personal computer. In such a scenario, the 
digital section residing in the RFID reader system simply does the analog-to-digital 
conversion of the raw analog signal with some basic noise filtering and forwards 
the processed data to a larger computer for further processing through an interface 
such as a wireless adapter, Ethernet, USB connection, and serial cable.
In addition to the operating speed and processing power, the architecture of 
the digital section and performance of the analog and digital components used in 
the digital section are important in a system design. The digital section should be 
able to generate analog and digital control signals for the RF section with sufficient 
speed as well as within the required range. The digital section also requires suf­
ficient dynamic range for the analog front-end for data acquisition and a suitable 
sampling rate for proper baseband signal acquisition. Therefore, when designing 
the digital section, certain parameters such as maximum update rates of the DAC, 
achievable sampling rates of the ADC, and speed of the internal buses such as SPI 
and I2C need consideration. These parameters are used by the microprocessor or 
FPGA to send control signals that are also properly matched with the desired per­
formance of the overall system. As stated earlier, a chipless RFID reader with time 
domain based interrogation needs a more powerful digital section than a frequency 
domain interrogation based system. Therefore, careful selection and a comprehen­
sive analysis of the cost and performance are required when integrating a chipless 
RFID system.
10.3.4  Application Software
RFID readers are often connected to a host computer or similar host computing 
device. The host computer can optionally be connected to a central database system 
for continuous updating of tag information. To interface the reader with the host 
computing device, application software is used and sometimes this application soft­
ware is called middleware. The application software maintains the software proto­
col between the reader and host computing device. Usually, the reader is connected 
to the host computer using standard input/output ports such as RS232, parallel, 
or USB ports. However, the software protocol used for data transfer between the 
application software and the reader is decided by the manufacturer or designer of 
the RFID system to suit their needs. Depending on the application, the reader can 
be configured to upload the fully decoded tag ID or the raw data received from the 
tag. The application software can be used for additional signal processing in cases 
where a reader is configured to upload raw data. 
For the two reader prototypes—dual-planar (type 1) and uniplanar (type-2)—
discussed in Chapter 4, two types of application software have been developed and 
the screen captures of these two are shown in Figures 10.12 and 10.13, respectively. 
The first type of software (see Figure 10.12) was developed using Microsoft Visual 
Basic .NET and it receives data from the reader via a USB port. This application 
software is capable of receiving raw data as well as fully decoded tag IDs from the 

268 
�����������������������������������������������

reader device and it supports only reader type 1. The software shown in Figure 
10.13 was developed using Matlab and it is capable of further processing of raw 
tag data. This software works with both type 1 and type 2 readers. Because the 
microcontroller of the digital section is not powerful enough for the signal process­
ing functions required for reader type 2, the software acquires raw data from the 
reader and the decodes the data. Figure 10.13 also shows an ADC output plot of 
backscatter.
Figure 10.14 summarizes the design flow for implementing a chipless RFID 
reader. It is clear that the application requirements and specifications plays vital 
roles in the selection of key elements and integration involved in the RFID system 
design process.
10.4  Applications 
As already discussed, like conventional RFID systems, chipless RFID is applica­
tion specific as well. Modifications to the RFID infrastructure are needed based on 
application scenarios. Chipless RFID has the potential to be adopted in different

application areas such as slot-card readers, touch-and-go type systems, retail, smart 
library, airport luggage tracking and handling, and vehicle entry systems. However, 
in this section two types of readers are described: a short-range conveyer belt ap­
plication and a long-range vehicular tracking application.
10.4.1  Conveyer Belt Application
Document authentication is generally considered a near-field reading application 
in which the tagged item will be within 10 cm of the reader. The time available to 
perform a tag read, however, depends on each specific application scenario. For 
example, in a case where the tagged documents are being read over a counter when 
being handled by human operators, more time is available for a tag read. Consider 
a scenario, however, in which the documents are in a printing facility and in the pro­
cess of being printed and tagged. Now consider that the integrity of each tag in each 
item needs to be checked while the items are still in the production process. Here, 
the tag reading needs to be performed while the documents are still in their uncut 
state as sheets of paper or polymer moving along the printing process [10, 11]. In 
such a situation a very small amount of time is available for a single tag read opera­
tion. Therefore, depending on the application the interrogation technology used in 
the RF front-end of the reader needs to be enhanced. The frequency of operation of 
the reader is dictated by the chipless RFID tag design, which is in turn determined 
by the space allowed in a document for the tagging.
Figure 10.15 illustrates an application scenario in which documents embedded 
with chipless RFID tags are printed on polymer/paper. Multiple pairs of Tx and Rx 
antennas are used in order to interrogate more than one tag simultaneously. Since 
the strength of the backscattered signal from the chipless tag printed on the paper/
polymer is very low due to the low conductive properties of the ink used and due to 
the loss introduced by the polymer substrates, high-gain antennas need to be used 
to enhance the signal quality. The dipole reflector arrays (14-dBi gain) presented in 
[13, 14] are suitable for this type of application.

10.4.2  Vehicle Tracking
This section details the use of chipless RFID for long-range mobile applications 
such as vehicle tracking. RFID has been widely used in tracking applications rang­
ing from tracking vehicles to wildlife. Long-range applications usually make use of 
the conventional chipped passive, semipassive, or in some cases active RFID tags for 
tagging items. Chipless RF-SAW tags are also gaining popularity in toll collection 
applications in the United States in recent years. These chipped and chipless RFID 
tags perform very well and operate up to several tens of meters in the case of active 
tags. We will now look at how a chipless RFID system can be utilized for long-range 
applications as a cheaper alternative to chipped RFID. 
10.4.2.1  Long-Range Chipless RFID Tag Design
Most of the chipless RFID tag design considerations discussed in the previous sec­
tion for authentication and anticounterfeiting applications are generally applicable 
to many other chipless RFID applications. For longer range applications typically 
backscatter based chipless RFID tags [15] are chosen as opposed to retransmis­
sion based tags. This is because retransmission based chipless RFID tags are more 
constrained in the degree of freedom available for tag placement with respect to

the reader than backscatter based tags. The retransmission based tag consists of 
two antennas that need to be polarization matched and aligned properly with the 
respective Tx and Rx antennas at the reader as shown in Figure 10.16(a). There­
fore, the tag is constrained both vertically and horizontally, where a small rotation 
or translation would cause a polarization mismatch and missed alignment, result­
ing in a degradation of the signal quality received at the reader. With the increase 
of distance, these effects become more severe. A backscatter based chipless tag is 
more relaxed in terms of tag positioning constraints since it does not contain a 
retransmission signal path (via a receiving tag antenna, data encoding filter, and a 
transmitting tag antenna) and only relies on antenna mode backscatter signal [10] 
produced by each individual antenna element in the tag. Hence, it provides a greater 
degree of freedom in the tag reading process. Figures 10.16(b) and (c) show the 
interrogation of a backscatter based chipless RFID tag. 
For long-range chipless RFID tags, maximizing the radar cross section (RCS) 
of a chipless tag is very important. Techniques for enhancing the RCS  of a chipless 
tag design include use of the following:
1.	 Increased reflective area for the chipless tag;
2.	 High conductivity of low-loss ink;

rogation. The letters h and v denote, respectively, horizontally and vertically linearly polarized elec­
tromagnetic waves.

3.	 Low-loss laminates.
Using arrays of reflective patches [15] enhances the RCS many-fold compared 
to a single reflective patch. As an example, Balbin and Karmakar [15] used a four-
element rectangular patch array as a reflective surface to enhance the RCS fourfold 
compared to a single patch reflector. Use of high-conduction inks [11, 12] also 
improves the RCS. Choosing a low-loss substrate material is also important in en­
hancing the backscatter from the tag [1, 2]. 
Another important consideration for long-range chipless RFID tag design is 
ensuring an orientation-invariant tag performance. This is because when the object 
being tracked is several meters away from the reader it is very difficult to control 
and restrict the orientation of the chipless tag placed on the object. Therefore, the 
reader needs to be able to read the information contained in the tag regardless 
of the orientation of the tag in 3D space. To ensure this orientation-invariant tag 
performance, circularly polarized (CP) resonating elements and antenna elements 
need to be employed in the chipless tag design. Designing UWB CP backscatterers, 
however, is a nontrivial task. Some UWB CP antennas can be found in the open 
literature [16].
10.4.2.2  Reader System and Reader Antenna Design
Figure 10.17 illustrates a vehicle tracking application. In such an application the 
typical distance between the target and the reader is more than 2m. The backscat­
tered energy coming from a tag at such a large distance is very small due to (1) 
FCC UWB-IR regulation of low-power transmission, (2) limited antenna gain, and 
(3) the path loss between the tag and the reader. Furthermore, this weak signal 
is affected by unwanted stray reflections caused by the environmental clutter. To 
enhance the signal captured by the reader and also to boost the transmitted signal, 
high-gain Tx and Rx antennas need to be designed. High-gain patch antenna ar­
rays or high-gain horn antennas are suitable reader antennas for these long-range 
applications. Chapter 7 details such high-gain antennas.
Vehicular applications present numerous challenges in the implementation of 
a chipless RFID system. The mobile environment causes the RCS to vary with 
movement. This dynamic RCS of the tag needs to be tracked, acquired, and pro­
cessed. The metallic body of a vehicle results in a large amount of unwanted stray

10.5  Conclusion 
273
reflections that interfere with the backscatter due to the chipless tag. The reader 
signal processing needs to cancel these spurious signals and enhance the wanted 
tag backscatter contained in the total received signal at the reader. Signal pro­
cessing techniques such as wavelet based processing and noise filtering need to be 
implemented in the reader digital section firmware for this purpose. Given that the 
backscattered signal is very weak and is heavily contaminated with interference 
and noise, many computationally intensive algorithms such as the matrix pencil 
algorithm [17] will be required to suppress the noise and extract the resonance 
information contained in the backscattered signal. The processing capabilities of 
an embedded reader system designed using microcontrollers or FPGAs might not 
be adequate to perform these complex numerical computations both in terms of 
speed and memory resource requirements. Therefore, the digital section of the 
RFID reader would simply forward data that are being processed to some extent 
via a communication link, such as Wi-Fi or Zigbee, to a centralized processing unit 
implemented using a computer server for further processing and to apply advance 
algorithms in order to extract tag information.
10.5  Conclusion
The key advantage of chipless RFID technology is the low-cost, printable tags that 
can be printed on paper or flexible substrates with conventional printing techniques 
with a fraction of the cost of a chipped tag. Therefore, chipless RFID is creating im­
mense interest among researchers and investors. Chipless RFID has enormous pros­
pects for being widely accepted for item-level tagging, document authentication, 
and automatic identification. However, for commercial applications an integrated 
reader that is available at a reasonable cost is required. 
In this chapter the design considerations for a complete chipless RFID reader 
system were discussed. Antenna configurations required for different types of ap­
plications were tested and the proper operation was verified with a PNA and two 
reader prototypes. The selection of an RF front-end technology, digital signal pro­
cessing requirements, and user interface requirements for an RFID reader system 
according to application specifications and requirements were discussed.
The application-specific design considerations for chipless tags and chipless 
RFID readers used for short-range applications, such as document authentication, 
and long-range applications, such as vehicle tracking, were discussed in detail. 
These case studies demonstrate the potential of chipless RFID technology in ubiq­
uitous applications. Once fully developed and deployed, chipless RFID technol­
ogy will penetrate the mass market for low-cost item-level tagging, authentication, 
security, surveillance, access control, logistics, toll collection, inventory controls, 
smart logistics, and many more sectors.
