PREFACE
The purpose of mathematical modeling is to find out what questions to
ask next.
Bill Steen
______________________________
The initial aim of this book is to describe the physical principles that
need to be taken into account in modeling various aspects of laser
material processing, and to formulate them in mathematical terms.  The
main purpose, however, is to show the way in which they can then be
used to obtain insight into a number of processes by the construction of
simple models whose underlying principles are easy to see.  The
immediate applications of the general principles considered here are
welding, surface treatment, drilling, forming, and cutting, but the
general principles have a very wide application. Many aspects of the
theory are relatively independent of the material under study, which
could be a simple metal, a complicated alloy (such as those used in the
aerospace industry), concrete, or plastic.  Although all the examples
considered in this book have the common feature that the source of
power is a laser, and the power of the laser is relatively high, the
principles and methods are very general and apply to thermal modeling
in many different fields, from microtechnology to laser medicine.
The emphasis is on the construction of simple models.  This book is
only concerned with those that can be solved to obtain worthwhile
insights using analytical methods backed up with relatively simple
numerical calculations that can be performed using standard general-
purpose computer packages.  Specific specialist software or the writing
of long programs are not required; their use is a complementary skill to
the kind presented here.  Availability of general-purpose software
capable of handling the routine numerical aspects of algebra and
calculus and the evaluation of special functions is assumed, although it
is not essential.  It simplifies calculations very greatly, however.
Computationally oriented modeling is a different kind of skill and is not
addressed, but an understanding of the underlying physical ideas
described should be helpful.  Although the idea is not heavily
emphasized, this book hopes to show how valuable it is to identify the
© 2001 by Chapman & Hall/CRC  

relevant (as opposed to the irrelevant!) principles underlying the
phenomena under investigation.
The book is intended primarily for engineers and material scientists
at the Masters or first year Ph.D. level.  It should also be of help to
research workers coming to mathematical modeling of thermal
processes in this area for the first time, whatever stage they have
reached in their career development, or to mathematicians who have
developed an interest in technological problems.  The level of
mathematical sophistication in modeling of this kind can vary a great
deal.  Some of the modeling described is relatively unsophisticated,
some of it less so.  The contents of the book are ordered by subject
matter rather than mathematical sophistication, but as a rough guide, the
degree of sophistication increases as each chapter progresses.  The level
of difficulty at the start of each new chapter is, however, considerably
less than that at the end of the previous one.  The exception is the first
two sections of Chapter 2, which may be omitted at a first reading.  The
final section of that chapter summarizes the most important results
required later on.
I would like to thank all those students, colleagues, and friends
around the world who have encouraged me in the study of problems in
modern technology.  They have proved to contain a richness of interest
for the mathematician that I had not expected.  In particular, my
appreciation goes to Phiroze Kapadia of Essex University and Bill Steen
of Liverpool University.  Phiroze has been a most stimulating colleague
and collaborator with an extraordinary breadth of knowledge and depth
of understanding of physics, and his determination and cheerfulness in
the face of crippling illness is a continual inspiration.  In the same way,
Bill Steen’s insight and enthusiasm for the problems of modern
technology have been complementary driving forces.  Between the two,
I have been sure that, although I will be encouraged to see the heights of
abstraction, I will never be allowed to lose sight of the practical goals of
mathematical modeling.
Finally, I would like to thank my friends and family for their
encouragement and forbearance during the writing of this book.

CHAPTER 1
THERMAL MODELING
______________________________
1.1 INTRODUCTION
The availability of lasers as a source of thermal energy has led to
their use in a variety of situations in many diverse fields, such as laser
material processing and laser surgery.1  They have the advantage that
they can deliver known levels of power into small regions remarkably
accurately; although a powerful laser is itself not small, its output can be
delivered relatively simply in a manner that can be very accurately
controlled.  This feature makes lasers very suitable for automated
processes.  The fact that the absorbed power level can be estimated
fairly accurately means that the effects of the thermal input, both the
desired ones and the undesirable side-effects, can, in principle, be
estimated relatively accurately.  This is another advantage in work
where precision is important, and is a principle reason why thermal
modeling is valuable; but it has many aspects.  It can be used, for
example, to gain a fundamental understanding of the processes
involved, or it can be used to demonstrate which effects are important
and which are of lesser importance in a given context.  It can be used to
analyze situations where undesirable side-effects are discovered, or to
save development time by means of elaborate computational models
that have been shown to be capable of producing accurate numerical
agreement with the results of earlier experiments.
It is a feature of mathematical modeling that has long been
recognized, that many apparently very diverse phenomena can be
modeled by essentially the same mathematics, and so it is here.  The
general approach to the modeling of laser surgery is not so very
different to the use of lasers in the manufacturing industries.  The power
levels are dramatically different, but the underlying ideas are those of
thermal conduction.  There are, of course, other important differences,

but they can generally be handled in similar ways; experience in one
area can be helpful in tackling problems in another. There is one point,
however, that cannot be emphasized too much.  When entering a new
field, it is crucial for someone who wishes to apply their expertise to
talk at length with experts in the field.  Every field has its special
interests and concerns as well as its own vocabulary.  To interact with
those in the area, a modeler must address problems of concern in a
language the practitioners can understand, and must take account of the
special features of the discipline concerned.  A mathematician will be
rewarded and often surprised by the diversity and interest of the
mathematical problems that the approach will bring to light.
In the same way, people who come to mathematical modeling
because of a prior interest in a particular area of application need a grasp
of mathematics sufficient to do whatever job is of interest to them.  In
doing so they will learn how to use aspects of mathematics that they will
later find useful in contexts other than the original one.  The cross-
fertilization that can occur in the process is one that can be immensely
stimulating to all involved.2
The purpose of this book is not so much to catalog simple
mathematical models as to try to give some idea by means of examples
of why one should attempt to construct them in the first place.  It is
helpful to recognize what sort of considerations go into making
something that will hopefully give greater insight, or to recognize what
is the value and what are the dangers of approximations – and, indeed,
to recognize approximations even when they come as accepted wisdom.
There are a substantial number of sophisticated computer programs
available that are dedicated to such things as the analysis of welding
problems, or more generally in the fields of thermodynamics and
computational fluid dynamics.  Such programs can be of enormous use,
but they need to be employed with understanding.  Generally, they
incorporate a great many aspects of the problems they address.  For a
proper understanding of the results the user needs to have some kind of
feel, not only for the type of results to be expected of an experiment, but
also the assumptions built into the program.
The situation with such tools is no different from that of the hand
calculator for doing arithmetic: press the wrong buttons – or use the
wrong algorithm – and you get the wrong answer.  Users need to have
                                                          
2 See, for example, Tayler, 1986.

enough understanding to press the right buttons in the first place, and to
recognize a nonsensical answer when they see it.  Computer programs
are automated versions of what are usually very sophisticated models;
they differ from analytical models only in the way in which they obtain
their answers.  It is, however, often much easier to understand which
mechanisms are important and which are not, and the kinds of results to
be expected, from the study of simple examples.  It is here that
analytical models can so often be helpful.
Mathematical models can be developed at many different levels, and
most people benefit by gaining experience with simple ones before
trying more sophisticated examples.  Not surprisingly, the mathematics
needed vary enormously with the degree of sophistication of the model
and the innate complexity of the problem to be studied.  In problems of
keyhole welding, for example, a familiarity with the cylindrical co-
ordinate system is essential in a way that is not necessarily the case for
other problems.  The need for different levels of mathematical
experience for different types of problems poses a difficulty for both the
reader and the writer of a book such as this.  The approach that has been
adopted is to include some revision of the mathematics needed for the
models studied in context.  It is assumed that anyone who studies a
given model has sufficient background, but may be unfamiliar or
unpracticed in the use of the most advanced mathematics needed for the
given example.  The explanations given, therefore, are at the level
appropriate to potential users of the given model, and are supplemented
by references to standard mathematics texts.  Such an approach results
in an apparent unevenness in the background knowledge expected, but it
is hoped that it results in a book that contains something of interest for
people at a number of different levels of mathematical experience.  It is
perhaps worth pointing out that, although the material is ordered by
subject matter rather than level of mathematical difficulty, it should be
possible to read the book selectively, starting with the topics that
involve the best-known mathematics.  This should give confidence to
the reader before moving on to those topics that require less familiar
mathematics.
Logically, the equations of heat conduction, fluid dynamics, and the
linear theory of thermoelasticity and the boundary conditions
appropriate to them underlie all the material discussed.  For that reason
they are covered first, in Chapter 2.  Any reasonably satisfactory
account necessarily involves some discussion of the physical
© 2001 by Chapman & Hall/CRC  

fundamentals and the way in which these can be converted to a suitable
mathematical form.  The process needs mathematics of a kind that tends
to be little used outside contexts of this kind, and will appear to many to
be unfamiliar.  There are many ways of dealing with the problem, and
the one adopted here is to try to present the arguments as economically
as possible; the development of these ideas is not the main purpose of
the book, necessary as it is.  Some people may prefer to read other
accounts, and a number of references are provided.  Almost everyone
will already be familiar with at least some parts of the theory.  The
results needed in the rest of the book are summarized in Section 2.3, and
the two previous sections can be omitted at a first reading.
1.2  DIMENSIONS AND DIMENSIONLESS NUMBERS
A feature that can at first be bewildering when people try to
understand a mathematical model, or to construct one themselves, is the
large number of quantities needed to describe a given problem.  These
can be genuine variables, such as the position in space of different
points within a workpiece in which the temperature distribution is to be
calculated, or properties of the material under consideration such as its
density, thermal conductivity, etc.  It is tempting at first to put in known
numerical values for all those quantities that are just constants of the
problem, just to reduce the number of symbols in use.
Consider, for example, the following problem.  A very thick sheet of
steel has its underside cooled to a fixed temperature.  Its surface stays at
an average temperature of 
C
15°
 as a result of periodic heating with a
nonzero mean part.  It is known that the reflection coefficient is 50%
and that the intensity of the incident power varies sinusoidally between
0 and 10 kW m−2 with a period of 1 minute.  The problem is to find out
what the highest temperature reached in the sheet is, at what time in the
cycle this occurs, and at what temperature the underside must be
maintained if the thickness of the sheet is 20 cm.  (See Figure 1.1.)
If z is the distance below the surface of the sheet and t is the time
from the minimum value of the incident intensity, an approximate
solution of this problem (with suitable values for the material properties
of steel) is

The symbols used are as in the notation in Section 2.3 with the addition
of   for the reflection coefficient, T0 for the mean surface temperature,
I0 for the average incident intensity (so its value is 
2
m
kW 
 
10
− for the
numerical example above), and t0 for the period.
What are the advantages?  The following are just a few.
• 
At the most basic level, it is easier to check that you have done the
algebra and calculus correctly.  You only need to follow the
symbols through, not redo all the arithmetic.
• 
There may well be simple intermediate checks – always valuable
when expressions get complicated.
• 
The number of symbols can nearly always be reduced, sometimes
very dramatically, and that is always an advantage if the algebra
gets at all involved.
• 
It is possible to apply the same theory with different numbers, or in
different contexts.  In this example, suppose a different heating
intensity or reflection coefficient were used, or suppose a different
metal were chosen?  The same theory applies, and it is just a matter
of changing the numbers in the formula for the answer.
• 
It will usually be easier to see whether the approximations used in
the construction of the model are worthwhile; there are inevitably
some at one level or another, even though they may not be easily
recognized.
• 
The nature of the answer obtained, when seen in a general form,
may suggest ideas about problems that are mathematically similar
but entirely different in terms of their origins in the real world.
In the above example it would not have been sensible to use the
method employed to get the solution (1.2) if the plate had been only 5
mm thick, a result that is clear from the formula.  The exponential
multiplier of the periodic part of the solution would still be quite large
when 
005
.0
=
z
 m, a result that could have been predicted in advance
from a consideration of the length scales in the problem, using
dimensional analysis before any calculus had been used.
Dimensional analysis is based on the idea that, for example, a length
is fundamentally different from a time; to speak of a rod as being 1
second long is simply not allowed.  Although it is common usage in the
U.S. to say that a town 50 miles distant is 1 hour away, there is an
underlying assumption that the traveler’s speed is 50 miles per hour or
© 2001 by Chapman & Hall/CRC  

thereabouts.  This means that distance d (1 mile) is related to time t (1
hour) by the relation d = vt, where v is the speed of travel (50 miles per
hour). The result is a dimensionally valid relationship since the product
of a velocity and a time is a distance.  In scientific work, however, it is
advisable to avoid verbal shortcuts of this kind.
It is possible to introduce separate symbols for the dimensions of
dimensional quantities, but it is perfectly safe to use the symbols
associated with the base units of the SI system.  That is what will be
done here, although the idea can be extended to entirely different
contexts.  The fundamental dimensional quantities needed are
          Quantity          Symbol
length
m
time 
s
mass
kg
temperature
K.
Because it is convenient to do so, and there is no risk of confusion,
some of the main derived symbols of the system will be used, such as
N = kg m s−2for force,
J = N m = kg m2 s−2 for work,
W = J s−1 for power,
Pa = N m−2 = kg m−1 s−2 for pressure.
The structure of the problem of the heated plate is really very simple,
even though the answer does not appear so at first sight.  The use of
dimensionless variables can help in a number of ways.  The following
table lists the various quantities in the problem and their dimensions
expressed in the base units of the SI system.  Here, at least, there is no
need to make a distinction between units and dimensions, although,
strictly they are not the same thing.

The rules for dealing with dimensional quantities are
© 2001 by Chapman & Hall/CRC  

• 
all quantities combined by addition or subtraction must have the
same units;
• 
the units of quantities formed by multiplication or division are
obtained by treating the units as if they, too, can be multiplied or
divided;
• 
standard functions should have dimensionless arguments.4
It is always safest to employ consistent sets of units; the SI base units
are internationally accepted and are easy to use.  All that is necessary is
to keep track of powers of 10 – remember, for example, that 1 kW is
actually 1000 W when doing arithmetic.
If h is the thickness of the plate, you can (if you really want to) add κ
and 
0
2 / t
h
, whose units are both m2 s−1, but not I0 and 
h
λ
, whose units
are W m−2 and W m−2  K−1, respectively.
These rules mean that at any stage in the construction of the formula,
all terms in any given expression must have the same dimensions, and
that includes the final formula itself.  That provides a very simple check
if symbols are used, as the dimensions of an expression obtained can be
verified at any stage.  If the check is satisfactory it will not, of course,
guarantee that the expression is right; but if it fails, then you have made
a mistake at some point and to continue without finding the mistake first
would be a waste of time.  If you substitute numbers at the start, such
checks cannot be carried out.
Consider Equation (1.2).  There is one term on the left, T, whose
units are K, as are those of the first term on the right, T0.  The second

4 The logarithm function, to whatever base, is an exception in a formal sense.  It
is, however, much safer to adhere to the rule in its case as well.  If you define
your own functions, it is also worth adhering to the rule in your definitions.
Not to do so runs the risk of causing confusion as to the units in which
quantities in your formulas should be measured, as there will probably be an
implicit preferred system with the danger that an unwary user may use the
wrong units.  Your formula will look very different depending on the units
employed.

Remember that , π, and the standard functions exp and cos are
dimensionless.  All terms in the equation therefore have the dimensions
of temperature; it only remains to check that the arguments of exp and
cos are themselves dimensionless.  Clearly the first and second terms in
the argument of cos are, so it only remains to check the third argument
of cos and the argument of exp.  They are, in fact, the same:

Consider what happens if dimensionless variables are introduced in
the given problem.  Here, there is not very much choice about the way
in which it can be done.
The natural time-scale is t0, whose dimensions are s.
A little less obvious is the length scale.  At first sight, h might seem
the obvious choice, but if we are really interested in thick workpieces, it
is not central and another choice has some advantages.  From the fact
that  
κ

has the dimensions of a length and would provide a satisfactory length
scale. There is no need at all to include the factor involving π, but the
resulting expressions will be a little bit simpler so there is perhaps an
advantage.

T0 has the dimensions of temperature, K, but is very much an
irrelevance in this particular problem.  It has no bearing on the answer
other than to provide a baseline (and just to confuse things it was given
in C
°
, as a more familiar unit in everyday use).  It is therefore not a
good choice.  There is an alternative, as can be seen from (1.2); the

The problem as stated imposes the two surface boundary conditions
explicitly, but a third condition is also given, that the underside of the

Finally, a periodic solution is required so that there is no need to discuss
transients.  This requirement was not explicitly stated in the original
description, but has been inferred from the absence of any reference to
initial conditions.  The inference might be incorrect!  Whenever a
mathematical model of some process is required, a major part of the
process is working out what is actually of interest to the person making
the request.  It can sometimes be the most difficult part of the problem;
there may well be all kinds of hidden assumptions that do not get
mentioned since a person working every day in the field either regards
them as obvious or is so used to them that they go unnoticed.  The
process of constructing the model will often throw a lot of light on
hidden assumptions.
There are a number of points arising from the formulation of the
problem in dimensionless terms.  The problem was originally posed in a
way that could arise quite naturally, but it does not correspond to the
way in which one would go about finding the solution.  To solve the
problem, it is more natural to regard the temperature of the underside as
given but not known, and then find the mean value of the surface.  Since
this is what is given, the temperature at which the underside must be
held can then be inferred.  The problem actually contains one
dimensionless number, 
κ
π
0t
h
h =
′
.  It is, however, the only parameter
in the formulation in dimensionless terms, demonstrating how
economical the technique is in terms of notation.  Dimensionless
numbers can be very useful in deciding the kinds of approximations to
be used, and relating problems from different contexts to one another.
With a solution obtained for one value of the dimensionless number, a
whole class of problems has been solved, not just one particular one.
The results are then easy to transfer.  Here we have, for example, solved
the same type of problem for other metals, and perhaps even for a layer
of ice on salt water (though one would have to examine the assumptions
carefully in that case to be sure how relevant the solution was). Other
© 2001 by Chapman & Hall/CRC  

advantages of the dimensionless form are that the individual stages in
the derivation will be notationally much simpler, and that it may be
much easier to spot general results.  In this example, it is now
immediately obvious that the highest surface temperature occurs one-
eighth of a period later than the maximum incident intensity.  Perhaps
this suggests an explanation of why it always seems hotter in the middle
of the afternoon than at midday in hot weather (although, again,
assumptions would have to be examined and the model would need to
be modified somewhat to be satisfactory).  Surface cooling, for
example, especially at night, is clearly important.
The phase lag is interesting and characteristic.  Figure 1.4 shows the
variation of temperature with depth relative to the mean value at time
intervals of one-eighth of a cycle.  The scales are those for Equation
(1.1), but the pattern is similar for any solution of the form of (1.4).  It
will be seen how the amplitude of temperature about the mean value at a
given depth oscillates with rapidly decreasing amplitude at greater
depth, but the oscillations lag behind the values nearer the surface.

The scalings used to obtain (1.4) were suggested by the answer, but
they could easily have been determined beforehand.  The choice of t0 is
immediate, while the length scale can be deduced as follows.  Rejecting
T0 and h as irrelevant, λ is the only remaining quantity involving K and
so must be rejected; I0 is then the only quantity left involving kg and
cannot be used to construct a length scale.  That leaves only κ (units, m2
s−1) and t0 (units, s).  The only combination of these with the dimensions
of length is 
κ
0t
 and dimensionless multiples of it.  Similarly, the
temperature scale must involve λ; that involves kg, so I0 must also be
involved.  To remove time and length scales from it, κ and t0 also have
to be present.  A very useful technique for finding the appropriate
powers can be illustrated by this example.  Suppose the necessary
powers are a, b, c, and d, respectively.  The units of λaI0

The use of the value of h′, which can seem important before the
solution is obtained, can be a useful guide to the kind of approximations
that might legitimately be used.  In the problem as stated, the value of
h′ is nearly 10, which is reasonably large, especially as it appears in a
negative exponential in the answer.  If, however, the thickness had been
5 mm instead of 20 cm, h′ would have been about 4
1 , which would
have required a more complete solution; if it had been only 1 mm thick
one might have been able to try a thin sheet approximation.

The purpose of the example was to illustrate how to use dimensional
analysis, the use of dimensionless variables, and the value of
dimensionless numbers.  It is, however, a solution of the equation of
heat conduction, so a brief indication will now be given as to how it can
be obtained.  The same kind of technique will be used in connection
with pulsed heat sources in later chapters.
Perhaps the simplest way of finding the solution is to guess the form.
Since there is a nonzero mean input, there has to be a mean vertical
temperature gradient that must be linear to satisfy the time-independent
conduction equation,

equation obtained by substitution of this form into the conduction
equation and its derivative at the surface.5  The value of the mean
temperature gradient must satisfy the surface condition.
The same method can be used to find the solution when h′ is of
order 1.  It is strongly recommended that the dimensionless formulation
of the problem should be used when finding it, otherwise there is a
danger of becoming lost in a bewildering forest of symbols.
1.3 TWO EXAMPLES
Thermal modeling can be applied to a great many industrial
processes. As an illustration of its potential value, consider the cases of
heat hardening of a metal workpiece and laser keyhole welding.6
CO2 lasers have a high power density and, as a result, they are very
suitable for some types of use in industry.7  For example, it is possible to
weld metal sheets of substantial thickness in a single pass.  The energy

can be placed very accurately, and so the thermal distortion of the work-
piece is much less than by conventional means.8  Similarly, they can be
used for surface treatment of metals; lasers can produce surface
hardening by martensitic transformation, for example, or overlay and
diffusion coatings.9  Because of the high power densities that can be
achieved with lasers, a thin layer of the surface can be raised to
temperatures well over 
C
1000 °
 very quickly so that very little thermal
energy is absorbed per unit area.  Heat distortion is therefore less, and
sufficiently high rates of quenching can be achieved by conduction
alone.
The technique is well established and empirical relations have been
obtained between the process parameters.10  Very general numerical
models of the process have been constructed.11  The problem was
studied by analytical models from its inception.12
It is a characteristic of a laser beam that it can supply power at a very
high intensity in a narrow beam.  As a result, it is particularly suitable
for penetration welding.  Repeated passes are unnecessary if the laser
beam is powerful enough, and since no material has to be removed to
reach the bottom of the seam, filler rods are not needed.
There are other advantages to laser welding as well when contrasted
with conventional welding techniques.  For example, there is no
physical contact with the workpiece so contamination problems are
much less severe.  Electron beam welding is in some respects rather
similar, but normally has to be carried out in a vacuum.  By contrast,
laser welding can be carried out in the atmosphere.  Furthermore, the
heat affected zone is very small, unlike the situation with standard
methods, though whether this is an advantage or a disadvantage will
depend on the application.  It is often possible to perform the welds in
places that would normally be inaccessible, for example inside an
enclosed vacuum tube.  A number of materials that are otherwise
difficult to weld can be processed.  Titanium is not easy to weld with a
TIG welder, for example.  Probably the most serious disadvantages are
the fact that the sizes of the pieces to be welded must be relatively
small, and that the capital cost of the equipment needed is high.

Metal is vaporized when the laser is first directed at the material to
be welded, while a hole forms through the material.  Usually the hole
penetrates to the far side of the workpiece but sometimes, either
deliberately or accidentally, incomplete penetration occurs.  This hole is
referred to as a “keyhole;” when penetration is incomplete the keyhole
is often said to be “blind.”  The workpiece is usually mounted on a
moving table so that it can be moved relative to the laser.  As it does so,
the keyhole advances through the material.  Welding will not occur if
the power supplied is too high relative to the speed of translation.  If the
rate of absorption of energy by the workpiece is correct, however, only
small amounts of material will be vaporized.  The keyhole will then be
surrounded by a region of liquid metal, known as the “weld pool.”  It is
the resolidification of the molten metal that forms the weld.  The hole
itself is kept open by a combination of factors, but probably the most
important are a combination of the pressure of the plasma that forms in
the keyhole and the ablation pressure of the evaporating metal.  Most of
the material flows past the keyhole in the molten region and solidifies
downstream of the laser, as shown schematically in Figure 1.5, though
the details of the flow can be very complex.13

For 
electron 
beam 
welding, 
it 
has 
been 
demonstrated
experimentally14 that there can be a displacement of the elements of the
material being welded when their final position in the workpiece is
compared with their original position.  In all probability the same is true
of laser welding.  The amount by which the material is shifted will
depend on the relative sizes of the molten region and the keyhole.
Not a great deal of material is vaporized, but it is almost certainly
very important in keeping the keyhole open, and perhaps also in
determining the rate at which energy is transferred from the laser beam
to the molten metal.  As a result of the loss of material and differential
stresses induced by the thermal cycle, the process may result in
deformation of the workpiece, metallurgical changes with resulting
changes in the properties of the material in and around the weld when
compared to the surrounding material, or the production of residual
stresses frozen into the material.  Some of these factors could have
important consequences for the strength and durability of the weld, and
all of them are appropriate subjects for study using suitable physical and
mathematical models.
A characteristic of laser welds is that liquid material is forced
outward so that it forms a raised surface on the completed weld.  On this
there is superimposed solidified ripples in a pattern somewhat similar to
herring bones in appearance, the regularity of which is sometimes taken
as an indication of a good weld.  The keyhole is at a pressure that will
not normally be exactly the same as that of the atmosphere in which the
welding operation takes place, with the result that metal vapor is forced
out at either end.  Since it could damage the optical system of the laser,
it is usual to provide a jet of gas coaxially with the laser beam.  The
nozzle through which this flows is indicated in Figure 1.5.  The type of
gas used and the flow rate can affect optimal operational parameters and
the quality of the weld.  Two commonly used gases are helium and
argon.
If the speed of translation of the workpiece is gradually increased
various possibilities can occur.  For example, the depth of the weld may
decrease and penetration of the workpiece may be incomplete.  When
this happens, the depth achieved is often taken as the maximum depth of
weld possible with this set of parameters.  There is some ambiguity here
since the phenomenon of “spiking” can occur in which there are sudden
                                                          
14 Basalaeva and Bashenko, 1977.
© 2001 by Chapman & Hall/CRC  

variations in the depth of penetration of the keyhole.  These departures
are usually of short duration, however.  A slightly different concept,
which is often taken to be the same, is the thickness of metal that can be
reliably welded with a given set of parameters.  Because the lower
boundary of the workpiece affects the flow of thermal energy parallel to
the laser beam, this depth is not the same as the maximum depth that
can be achieved in a very thick workpiece.  In the case of a blind
keyhole, one that does not penetrate right through the workpiece, the
actual depth of the weld is slightly greater since it is the depth of the
molten region that defines the weld depth, not the length of the keyhole.
In a great many models of keyhole welding all these concepts are
considered to be the same, usually without discussion, for the simple
reason that within experimental error they give effectively the same
values.  In transitional cases, however, for example between keyhole
welding and conduction welding,15 it is sometimes necessary to be
aware of the distinctions.
A second transition phenomenon is that of "humping."  If the
translation speed is too high, the ripples on the surface of the weld pool
may grow in amplitude to the point where they are so large that welding
is no longer taking place in parts of the seam.  Large solidified droplets
may form on parts of the seam with no material in others; undercutting
and voids can also occur.  A different parameter zone is represented by
the related technique of laser cutting, in which the molten material is
removed entirely instead of being allowed to remain.

CHAPTER 2
PHYSICAL PRINCIPLES
______________________________
The first two sections of this chapter use more sophisticated
mathematics than the rest of the book.  The results obtained here, which
are summarized in Section 2.3, are used in the rest of the book, but the
derivations can be omitted at a first reading.
2.1  GOVERNING EQUATIONS
2.1.1  Conservation equations
Many ideas in the physical sciences can be considered as examples
of conservation processes in which some quantity is neither created nor
destroyed.  The most familiar example of such an idea is perhaps the
notion of conservation of mass.  An extension of this idea occurs when a
quantity is generally conserved but is also capable of being created or
removed from the system.  It may be worth remarking that these ideas
often merge into one another and depend on the exact definitions of the
quantities under consideration.  An example might be the dissipation of
mechanical energy into heat.  In this instance mechanical energy is not
conserved.  Nevertheless, if the total energy is considered, consisting of
both thermal and mechanical energy, and a sufficiently global view is
taken, a conservation statement can be formulated.  For reasons of this
sort, all equations expressing ideas of this kind will be referred to as
conservation equations. The convention will be followed even if, in a
narrow sense, the principal quantity is only conserved in a global sense,
or if it is more normally thought of as being generated by another type
of quantity.  An example of the latter is the way that force is related to
the rate of change of momentum.
This chapter is concerned only with physical processes that are to be
analyzed in terms of quantities that can be adequately described using
continuous functions.  Examples are the temperature distribution inside
a solid body, or the body’s density.  Quantities that need to be studied in
this connection are not necessarily scalars like the temperature and
density examples just mentioned.  The velocity at a point in a fluid in
© 2001 by Chapman & Hall/CRC  

motion, for example, is a vector, while the stress in an elastic solid is
described in terms of the stress tensor.  Most of the underlying
equations considered in this book are mathematical statements of these
ideas of conservation, generation, or destruction.  They will be
expressed in a form appropriate to representations of the physical
quantities, in terms of mathematical functions that are sufficiently
continuous for the techniques of differential and integral calculus to be
used.  Strictly speaking, physical quantities are not usually infinitely
divisible in this way.  The physical statements have to be made in terms
of finite-sized regions, and a limit to zero size taken as a mathematical
extrapolation.  Such an approach is used because of the power and
convenience of the techniques that are then available for the solution of
problems of interest.  A simple example is the continuum approximation
of fluid mechanics.  It is not possible to construct derivatives of the
density of a fluid.  The limiting process will pass through volumes in
which the number of atoms is so small that it is not possible to talk
meaningfully of a density.  Mathematically, therefore, the density on
these scales is a downward extrapolation of the values at bigger sizes.
The same kind of idea applies to many other quantities.
All three cases, conservation, generation, and destruction, can, in
these circumstances, be analyzed in the same way.  It is possible to
describe such ideas in terms of a simple partial differential equation. For
simplicity all such equations will be referred to as conservation
equations, even if they include generation or destruction terms.  It is
worth noting that generation and destruction can be included as a single
effect differing only in its sign.  A term sometimes used for equations of
this type is balance equations.
Suppose there is some quantity, call it Q, that is defined at every
point in some region of space D, and is associated with elements of the
underlying material occupying D.  The underlying material will often be
the workpiece.  Suppose
1. there is a flow  of Q defined at each point of D so that the
direction of flow is that of the unit vector ˆ  and the magnitude is
  units of Q  per unit time;
2. there is a density   units of   per unit volume defined at each
point of D;
© 2001 by Chapman & Hall/CRC  

3.  units of  are generated per unit time per unit volume of D.  If
there is destruction of Q, then adopt the convention that  is
negative;
4. at any element of surface with unit outward normal n, there is a rate
of generation of Q of 

n.
 units of Q per unit area of S per unit
time, where  will be assumed to be independent of the orientation
of the surface element.
The first three of these assumptions are reasonably self-explanatory,
but the fourth needs some explanation.  In the simpler examples that
will be considered here there is no such effect that needs to be
investigated.  Newton’s second law of motion, however, shows that
force generates momentum and can therefore be discussed in terms of a
conservation condition; among the various types of force that can occur
are pressure forces between material elements.  These depend on the
orientation of the surface elements in contact, and hence on n.  In the
simpler cases such as the dynamics of a Newtonian fluid, the remaining
features of these forces can be described in a way that is compatible
with Point 4, however.  A similar situation occurs in the linear theory of
elasticity.
Now consider any fixed volume V that will be taken to include its
bounding surface S.  It can be chosen in any way one wishes, provided
that it lies in D.  For the purposes of the following argument V, can be
defined in a purely hypothetical way – it need not have physically
observable boundaries.  For the most part, such regions of material need
exist only in the mind.  For a great many quantities in physics there is a
fundamental balance for the property Q in any such material volume V,
given by the following statement.
See Figure 2.1.
The net rate of increase of Q in V is equal to the total rate of
generation of Q inside V and on its surface S, less its net rate of
outward flow across S.

The net rate of increase of Q in V is simply the rate of change of the

Rather more difficult to calculate is the net rate of flow out of V
across its surface S.  Consider a small element in the surface of V whose
area is dS and which is perpendicular to the unit vector n.  It is usual to
adopt the convention that n points out of a closed surface such as S, as
illustrated in Figure 2.2.  Suppose, also, that the angle between the
normal n and the flow vector   in that region is θ .  The only
contribution to the flow out of V across dS is that part of   that is
perpendicular to dS; the part parallel to it does not contribute.  The
magnitude of the rate of loss is then

and it is true for any volume V inside D. This is the most general form
of a conservation or generation law and is expressed in predominantly
integral form.  The arbitrariness inherent in the choice of V is a very
important aspect of the equation, but it is much easier to investigate the
properties of the system if this arbitrariness is removed.  That can be
done by converting the system into a partial differential equation by the
following technique. Gauss’s theorem, sometimes known as the
divergence theorem, states that if a differentiable vector field G is

the form it takes when the conventions of Cartesian tensor notation3 are
employed and use is made of Einstein’s summation convention.
Cartesian tensors employ a notation in which all components of tensor
or vector quantities are expressed in terms of a rectangular Cartesian co-
ordinate system, and the components are distinguished by numerical
subscripts.  The summation convention implies summation from 1 to 3
in any multiplicative expression in which the same subscript indicated
by a letter appears exactly twice, so that here, for example,

for any volume V contained in D.  The arbitrariness of V means that the
integrand itself must vanish.  For many people the result is intuitively
obvious, but for others it is not.  The way to see it formally is to assume
that the integrand is continuous, divide the integral by the magnitude of
the volume V, and allow the volume to tend to zero.  The limit must be
taken in such a way that V always contains an arbitrarily specified point
of D and its overall dimensions also tend to zero.
The consequence of the argument is that

at each point in D, a generalized form of the conservation equation.
It is now possible to use all the methods of differential and integral
calculus to investigate the properties of a system that possesses such a
conservation law.
2.1.2  The equation of conservation of mass
Probably the simplest example of a conservation equation is that of
the equation of conservation of mass in the form used in the study of the
motion of a fluid when an Eulerian description of motion is employed.
Suppose that the material under consideration has a velocity u (m s−1) at
a point whose position vector is r, and that its density there is ρ (kg
m−1).  In that case,  in Equation (2.2) is replaced by ρ,  by 0,   by 0,
and  by ρ u since the flow of mass is entirely convective.  The
equation of conservation of mass is therefore

An important special case is that of an incompressible fluid in which
there is no change of density following the motion of the fluid.  If a
small volume of fluid is labeled, then the fluid bearing that label always
has the same density wherever it is in the future, although its neighbors
may have different densities.  The idea can be expressed in
mathematical form by considering a short interval of time tδ ; the idea
of incompressibility means that

2.1.3  The equation of heat conduction
The quantity that is conserved, generated, or lost in the theory of heat
conduction is thermal energy.  The thermal energy density per unit mass
of a material such as a solid or liquid workpiece, of density ρ and
specific heat at constant pressure cp, is ∫
dT
c p
ρ
 (J m−3).  This,
therefore, is the quantity to be substituted for  in Equation (2.2).  The
rate of flow vector  is given partly by Fourier’s law as 
T
∇
−λ
(W m−2 s−1), where λ is the coefficient of thermal conductivity, and
partly as a convective component.  The latter results from the motion of
the underlying material.  Heat is carried with the material as it moves
with a flow rate

 are not constants.  They may depend on
position in space, on time, and on T.  In material processing problems it
is usual to neglect the contribution to q that results from the working of
viscous stresses, for example, as such contributions are usually very
small compared to other heat sources.
A transformation that is sometimes useful when the thermal
conductivity λ is a function of T only is to put

If conditions are entirely steady, the time derivative is missing from
the equation above.  It is important to be clear that the absence of
dependence on t only indicates that conditions in the frame of reference
of the coordinate system are steady.  Such a frame of reference is often
convenient from the mathematical point of view, even though the
properties under investigation depend on the thermal history of
individual material elements.  A case in point occurs when the

2.1.4  Dynamics of a continuous medium
The same kind of technique can be used to establish the equations of
motion of a continuous medium from Newton’s laws of motion.  The
first law is a conservation law of the most basic kind.  The third law
tells us how a composite body can be aggregated as a whole rather than
having to consider it permanently as a collection of discrete parts.  The
fundamental quantity then becomes momentum. The derivation of
© 2001 by Chapman & Hall/CRC  

Equation (2.2) was explained as if Q were a scalar quantity, although
that is not essential.  It could be, for example, the ith component in a
Cartesian tensor description of some more general tensor quantity.  Here
we will take it to be the ith component of momentum.  In that case, take
 to be 
iu
ρ
 (kg m−3 s−1) and  to be the rate of flow of this quantity,
u
iu
ρ
.  Newton’s second law then shows that the volume rate of
generation  of Q is given by 
iF
ρ
 where F  (N kg−1) is the total body
force per unit mass acting on an element of the medium.
The forces in a continuous medium can be of three types, internal
forces between pairs of particles within V, body forces, and surface (or
contact) forces.  Examples of internal forces are mutual gravitational
forces or electrical forces between elements within V.  By Newton’s
third law these are equal and opposite and therefore sum to zero over the
whole of V.  They make no net contribution to the total force acting on
material in V.  Body forces are those such as gravitational forces caused
by external material, and it is their total that is described by F.
It is now necessary to analyze the surface forces4 in order to identify
the form of .  They are the result of one body of material acting on an
adjacent body, by processes such as frictional contact or pressure.  It is
usual to assume the Euler-Cauchy stress principle, which asserts that the
effect of material outside V is equivalent to the existence of a force
acting on each element dS of the surface of V.  Its form is taken to be
(
)dS
t,
,n
r
τ
 where n is the outward unit normal at dS and τ (N m−2) is
the surface traction or stress vector.  It can be shown5 that there exists a
stress tensor p , whose components in a Cartesian coordinate system

The summation convention applies and all indices run from 1 to 3. A

There is a special property possessed by p  that can be deduced in
the same way.  It is possible to take moments of Newton’s second law
of motion about any specified point a.  The law then becomes a
statement about the way in which moment of momentum (angular
momentum) is generated by couples.  Again, the account will be given
using the notation of Cartesian tensors.  Some further notation needs to
be introduced, however.  First, it is convenient to introduce the

In other words, the stress tensor is necessarily symmetric.
It is sometimes useful to consider the orientation of a surface in the
material that corresponds to a maximum or minimum value of the
normal component of the traction on it.  Suppose the surface has a unit
normal n with components ni.  What is required is the stationary value
of τini = nipijnj, as the orientation of n is varied.  Such a variation has to
be performed subject to the constraint that 
1

n
.  The easiest way to
find the values of n is to use the method of Lagrange multipiers.7  The

in other words, there are in general three such directions n, which are
the eigenvectors8 of the matrix corresponding to p  with eigenvalues p.
The values of p are called the principal stresses.  A positive value of p
corresponds to a tensile stress, and a negative value to a compressive
stress on the element of surface whose normal is n.  The tractions in
these special cases are, in fact, normal to the surface element since they
are proportional to n.

An ideal fluid is one in which all surface stresses are perpendicular
to the surface, so that

 where I  is the unit diadic, or

where

This is known as Euler’s equation for an ideal fluid and has to be solved
with the equation of conservation of mass, either in the full form (2.3) or
the form appropriate to an incompressible fluid, (2.5).
A quantity that is often employed in the discussion of fluid
phenomena is the vorticity, 
u
×
∇
. If the body force F is conservative,
so that it can be derived from a potential (i.e., there exists V such that
V
−∇
=
F
), it is possible to show that
(i) an incompressible ideal fluid started from rest always has zero
vorticity
(ii) under some circumstances the vorticity of a viscous fluid decays.
For both reasons the assumption is frequently made that the vorticity
of the fluid is zero.  Since the equation 
0
u =
×
∇
 implies the existence
of a velocity potential φ such that 
φ
∇
=
u
,9 obtaining the solution of
problems in ideal fluids is much simplified, and so such an assumption
is frequently made.  In particular, for an incompressible fluid, it follows
that the velocity potential satisfies Laplace’s equation

Although it is extremely convenient, it should nonetheless be
regarded with a great deal of caution in the modeling of industrial
processes of the kind to which thermal modeling is often applied.
Frequently, the fluid motion may not be started from rest in the
conventional sense, and the time scales are frequently too short for the
damping effects of viscosity to have a major effect.
For a fluid of uniform, constant density in steady motion under the
influence of body forces derivable from a potential V, the scalar product
of Equation (2.17) with u shows that

The operator

C is a constant for any given stream line under those circumstances.
This result is Bernoulli’s equation and can be useful in determining the
pressure at different points in the fluid.  The constant C is, in general,
different for each stream line, although when the motion is also
irrotational it is the same for all.  It is worth noting that in the special
case when the constitutive equation of the fluid takes the form that the
pressure is a function of the density only, Bernoulli’s equation takes the
form

a way that is symmetric in order to satisfy condition (2.16), while p is

Here, µ is the (dynamical) viscosity of the fluid and Equation (2.22)
gives the stress/rate-of-strain relations for a Newtonian fluid.  It will be
noticed that if the fluid is incompressible, the last term in the bracket
vanishes by Equation (2.5).  These relations were obtained by Saint-
Venant (1843) and Stokes (1845) in essentially the way described here,
but had already been derived by Navier (1822) and Poisson (1829) by
consideration of the molecular mechanism of internal friction.13

the structure of the equations, the ratio 
ρ

 appears very frequently
with the result that it is often given the name kinematic viscosity and the
symbol ν.  The word “kinematic” is often omitted, but it will usually be
clear from the context whether µ or ν is intended.  If necessary, the term
"viscosity," represented here by µ but often by η, can be prefixed by the
word “dynamic” or “dynamical” to avoid confusion.
2.1.7  Equations of linear thermoelasticity
Suppose the underlying material considered is an elastic solid that is
capable of expansion on being heated.  Initially, it is at a uniform
temperature 
0
T  and is at rest.  The assumption will be made that under

these conditions it has no internal stresses.  If that is so, then the stress
tensor 
0
p ≡
.  Its elements are then subject to small displacements
(
)t,r
ξ
 from their original positions as the result of the application of
external forces or the existence of a temperature distribution 
(
)t
T
,r
.
Either of these effects will produce a stress distribution, the first as a
result of Hooke’s law14 and the second because of changes in volume as
a result of thermal expansion.  If the displacements and the temperature
difference 
0
T
T −
 are sufficiently small, the relation between stress and
the displacements and temperature field will be linear and additive.
Any additional quantities that appear will be either constants or linear
isotropic tensors if the underlying material is itself isotropic – that is to
say, its properties are independent of orientation.  A material for which
that would not be the case can be illustrated by any attempt to construct
a global model of a reinforced concrete structure.  The reinforcing rods
would result in the material behaving differently when forces are
applied in one direction from the way it would behave if the same forces
were applied in another direction.  The two effects, distortion and
thermal expansion, can be considered separately and then added as a
result of the linearity assumption.
Consider first the effects of distortion.  Hooke’s law states that the
extension of a spring is proportional to the force applied.  In the case of
a continuous body of material, this is equivalent to saying that the
relative degree of deformation of adjacent elements of the material
depends linearly on the resultant stresses.  These relative deformations
are measured by the space gradients of the displacement vector ξ, not by
ξ itself.  To see this, consider the case of a body that is moved rigidly a
small amount: no internal stresses are needed to maintain this new
position since all elements are still in the same position relative to each
other.  Thus, there must be a linear isotropic relation between 
j
i
x
∂
∂ξ  and
p  that is symmetric, as required by Equation (2.16).  The most general

The constant E is Young’s modulus (

the right-hand side of (2.25) is defined is for consistency with the
standard definition of Young’s modulus for the extension of a uniform
elastic rod of cross-sectional area A.  See Figure 2.3.

 as a dilation, or change of volume per unit

volume V contained inside the hypothetical surface S with no
displacement.  Its volume is simply V.  Now suppose that its elements
are displaced by an amount ξ.  So long as the displacements are small,

the change in volume of the material can be estimated by finding the
new position of the material surface, estimating its thickness at each
point, and summing over the whole surface.  The new volume is then

there is no dilation (the second group of terms).

Equation (2.25) is the stress-strain relation of the classical theory of
linear elasticity.  Although they can be used with a suitable version of
Equation (2.14), they have to be solved for p .  Before this is done the
effect produced by a temperature distribution must be considered.
A change of temperature alone can introduce a stress distribution,
even if there is no displacement at all.  It is clear that this is so if one
considers what would happen to a body of material that is confined in a
rigid container whose shape does not change with temperature.  Suppose
the material is raised from one uniform temperature to another.  Since it
is confined within a fixed volume and conditions are uniform, no
movement is possible.  Because of the tendency to thermal expansion of
© 2001 by Chapman & Hall/CRC  

material when unconfined, however, its elastic compressibility must
compensate for this tendency, resulting in an internal stress distribution.
The analysis, however, is more easily performed in relation to the
strain tensor than the stress tensor since there is a direct connection
between displacement and thermal expansion.  Suppose all effects are
small enough for the linear approximation to be valid and the material
is isotropic. The connection between the strain tensor and the
displacement is then most easily considered in a situation where stress is
absent and free expansion is allowed.  In that case, the strain tensor must
be expressible as an isotropic function of the temperature change, so

This form of the relations is useful for many purposes and is preferred in
many engineering contexts.   However, it is not the most convenient
way of writing them when they need to be used in conjunction with
some form of the governing dynamical Equation (2.14).  From the form
of the equation it is clear that it would be preferable to have the stress
tensor given explicitly in terms of the strain tensor.  Such an expression
can be obtained by the following method.  First of all, contract the
suffixes i and j to obtain the dilation, from which it follows that

λL and µL are the Lamé constants.  The symbols λ and µ are
conventional, but the subscript L will be used here to avoid confusion
with the thermal conductivity, λ, and fluid viscosity, µ.
With the stress-strain relations in the form given by (2.33) it is now
possible to write down the equation of motion derived from (2.14) for
the case of linear thermoelasticity.  If it is assumed that the
displacements are all small, the nonlinear convective terms must be
neglected, and the velocity u is given by

This is Navier’s equation in a form generalized for thermoelastic
problems.
The discussion of the stress-strain relations was presented in terms of
small displacements.  However, the argument depends only on the stress
and strain tensors being small, so it is possible to superimpose a
global translation and rotation without changing the value of the strain
tensor. These may be time dependent, but if a displacement

 is superimposed there is no change in the strain
tensor. In a great many applications in the theory of material processing,
it is more convenient to use a frame of reference for the co-ordinates
that is fixed relative to the power source rather than to the workpiece.
In that case, the same theory applies so long as the displacements

relative to the specified global displacement of the work-piece are small.
In a fully time-dependent problem, the connection between velocity at a
particular point, and the displacement of the material element that would
be at that point if the motion were that of a rigid body, is somewhat
complicated. However, if these displacements are small and the velocity
of the element to a first approximation is U(t) with no superimposed
rotation, then to the next approximation it is

In most applications, the first term can be neglected since the
acceleration of the workpiece is usually small, but in advanced
applications such as laser deposition it might have to be taken into
account.  It is worth pointing out that in a great many applications the
terms on the left can be ignored, although this must always be verified
by consideration of orders of magnitude.  Thus, for example, in a
process described in a coordinate system in which conditions can be
considered as steady, the ratio of the inertial term (second on the left) to
the elastic terms (second and third groups on the right) is
E
U 2
ρ
.
Typical values for ρ and E for a number of materials can be found in the
table in Appendix 1.  For example, for the scabbling of concrete with a
scanning speed of 10 cm s−1 this ratio is of the order of 10−10, and for
steel at the same speed it is also of this order of magnitude.  Under such
circumstances, the inertial term can be neglected entirely.

These are the Beltrami-Michel equations and, in general, have to be
solved in conjunction with (2.38).  They allow problems to be solved
directly in terms of the stress tensor, which is often the quantity of more
fundamental interest in material processing problems.  The alternative is
to use the Navier Equation (2.36) for the displacements, and then derive
the stress distribution from the stress-strain relations and the definition
of the strain tensor.
A particularly simple form is taken in the case of a steady problem in
which the components of the stress and strain tensors and the
temperature have no dependence on the x2 coordinates.  Then,

The cases of plane strain and plane stress are appropriate to rather
different circumstances.  Quasi two-dimensional models in which a lack
of dependence on a coordinate perpendicular to the plane defined by the
direction of motion, and the normal to the surface of the workpiece, are
usually approximations to three-dimensional models in which the
relative configuration is constrained globally.  Lateral strain can then
only occur with difficulty; in order to maintain the configuration, a
lateral stress distribution is needed so that 
0
22 ≈
e
 and 
0
22 ≠
p
.  In this
case the plane strain model is appropriate.  By contrast, a thin plate
unconstrained on its surfaces may be assumed to have very little
variation in the stresses perpendicular to its plane, but there may be non-
zero strains so that the plane stress approximation might be more
appropriate.
2.1.8  Plasticity
Normally, the deformation of a material such as a metal satisfies the
theory of infinitesimal elasticity for sufficiently small values of the
strain.  So, if a cylindrical rod is extended longitudinally in the manner
shown in Figure 2.2, the elastic behavior for sufficiently small
extensions obeys Hooke’s law 
Ee
p =
.  In such experiments e is usually
defined as 
h
h
δ
, where h is the length of the rod and 
h
δ  is the
extension from its original length.  Then, p is defined as 
A
F
 where F
is the force applied and A is the area of cross-section of the rod.  The
law only holds however if the strain e remains below a critical value, e*,
say.  The value of e*, which depends on the material in question, is of
the order of 
3

 for hardened steels but can be smaller; for
annealed metals, for example, it is nearer 
3
10−.  For

 where, however, the stress increases more gradually
than Hooke’s law would allow.  The value of the stress corresponding to
ey is known as the yield stress, py. For even greater values of e
permanent extension occurs and the stress reaches a limiting value.
When the strain reaches a critical value ef  corresponding to the
fracture stress pf , failure occurs and the rod breaks.  The value of ef
depends on the metal but can have any value up to about 0.4.   Figure
2.5 shows a schematic diagram of such a stress-strain relation for a
simple material.  It is characteristic that

If the rod is extended beyond ey to ec, for example, where

 and the extending force is then gradually removed, the rod
contracts following a stress-strain relation that is nearly linear.  It can be

.  When the extending force is removed
there is a permanent or residual plastic strain ep.  On repetition of the
cycle the new law is followed so long as 
ce
e <
.  Once greater values of
e are reached, either the rod fractures or a new value of ec is defined
with a new value for ep.
Similar properties hold when the rod is subject to compression.  For
most metals the complete curve is nearly antisymmetrical.
The stress-strain relation is typical of the particular material and
depends on a number of features. One such factor is the chemical
composition, but it will also depend on such things as heat treatment and
the way in which the object was manufactured.  It is therefore not

always easy to produce reliable models of industrial processes in which
plasticity occurs.
Various simplified models of plasticity have been proposed in the
past.  One of the simplest is to approximate the kind of stress-strain
relation shown in Figure 2.5 by a series of straight line segments as in
Figure 2.6.

For some purposes it may even be adequate to approximate the
relation by the step function shown in Figure 2.7.  The generalization of
these ideas into three dimensions is not unique, and some additional
assumptions are needed.  There are two main problems.  The first is a
suitable criterion for the initiation of yield, and the second is to find an
appropriate equation for plastic deformation once yield has occurred.
2.2  BOUNDARY CONDITIONS
This section also uses rather more sophisticated mathematics and the
most important results are summarized in Section 2.3.
2.2.1  General considerations
The boundary conditions and initial conditions associated with a
particular problem are essential parts of its specification and are every
bit as important as the differential equation itself.  The number and
nature of the conditions normally depends on the type of equation.  A
full discussion of the problem is beyond the scope of this book, but
some mention of the types of conditions associated with particular types
of problems is essential.
Conditions to be imposed in problems of the kind studied are of three
types.  The first is associated with initial value problems.  These are
problems in which all quantities are in an initial state that is specified.
Usually all this requires is the initial values of the dependent variables
and perhaps their rate of change in the region occupied by the material
that is under study.  The exact specification of what these variables are
may need some care.  For example, an initial value problem for the
equation of heat conduction

where the subscript t indicates the time derivative.
The majority of the problems considered, however, are either
specified in a frame of reference in which a steady state is assumed to
be possible, with the result that all the unknowns are independent of
time, or else only periodic solutions are considered.  A function

periodic if there is a number

T
 with the property that
(
)
( )t

 for all t.  The smallest such number T is called its
period, and such functions are said to be periodic.  The simplest
examples of periodic functions are the sine and cosine functions since

 and 
(

;  they have period 
π
2
.
Often, more complicated periodic solutions are constructed by adding
together combinations of these with other sine and cosine functions,
with periods that are integer multiples of π
2
, to give solutions in terms
of Fourier series.19
The second type of condition is a boundary condition at a fixed
boundary.  An example of such a condition is provided by a solid slab of
metal whose faces are maintained at specified temperatures.  The most
important feature of this kind of condition is that the location of the
boundary is known in advance.
The last type of condition is that which occurs on a boundary whose
location is actually a part of the solution of the problem.  Typically,
there will be more conditions at such a boundary than there would be if
it were known in advance.  A characteristic example is provided by the
boundary that separates the molten material in the welding process from
the solid metal.  Finding this boundary is an essential part of the
problem of determining the width of the weld.  It is often not at all a
simple matter to specify the conditions or to find the boundary.  One
only has to consider the problems posed by a eutectic alloy.  It may not
be at all clear how to define such a boundary.  In the case of a simple
problem of melting, typical conditions might be that the temperature
should be equal to the melting temperature of the metal, and that there

should be a discontinuity in the heat flow across the boundary given by
the latent heat of fusion.
The discussion that follows looks at the main kinds of boundary
conditions that have been employed in the past in the modeling of laser
processes.  It is certainly not complete, and it has to be recognized that,
like the choice of a differential equation, all such conditions represent
some level of approximation.  The skill of the modeler lies in choosing
the level of approximation that makes for a problem that can be solved
with the available techniques without excessive difficulty, and yet
provides the kind of insight, or the kind of accuracy, that was the
original purpose of the model.  The kinds of approximations used will
depend on the objectives.
2.2.2  Thermal boundary conditions
Suppose that the boundary between two adjacent layers of material
can be described as a member of the family of surfaces
(
)
C
t
S
=
,r
.
Without any loss of generality, the boundary itself can be taken to be
that particular member for which 
0
=
C
.  Then suppose t is a unit vector
parallel to the surface.  In that case there is no variation in S in the direct
of t, so that (
)
0
=
∇S
t.
.  Rewrite this as (
)
0
=
∇S
t.
.  It can be seen from
this equation that 
S
∇ is perpendicular to any vector t tangential to the
surface.  Consequently, the unit normal to the surface can be written as
S
S ∇
∇
=
n
(2.45)
at any point at which 
0
≠
∇S
.
The conservation statement in Section 2.1 remains true even if there
are discontinuities in the variables concerned.  A change of phase is a
particular example of such a discontinuity and can be studied from the
same point of view as that embodied in the integral statement, Equation
(2.1).  This time, however, it is not possible to reduce the statement to
the form of a partial differential equation.  The discontinuity is usually
in the density  of the property Q, and sometimes in .  The statement
then becomes a relation between the values of quantities on the two

sides of the discontinuity.  Suppose that the surface on which the
discontinuity occurs is given by 
(
)
0
,
=

S r
.  Suppose further that the
surface S enclosing the volume V of the integral statement (2.1) is a
(temporarily)20 fixed but small and fairly thin layer of surface area A and
thickness h.  It contains a part of the surface of discontinuity at both
time t and time 
t

interface are required to be perpendicular to the normal n.  See Figure

Now consider the consequences of the integral statement (2.1).
Suppose the transition is between phases F1 and F2 with the normal n
directed from F1 to F2.  Use subscripts 1 and 2 to distinguish between
conditions on the two sides of the interface.  Consider each of the terms
in (2.1) separately.  The principal contribution to

reference temperature.  They are defined in such a way that any
discontinuities of the integrand are finite; the contribution from latent
heat therefore appears only in the term in L.  The integrals themselves
are continuous across the interface with the same value on each side.

Since the temperature integral has the same value on each side of the

There is a difficulty associated with the condition at the boundary
between the solid and the liquid phase.  The boundary may not be
clearly defined; since the solid and liquid states are different phases of
the same material, it is possible for there to be a region in which solid
and liquid forms exist together in thermodynamic equilibrium.  The
problem is particularly acute in the case of an alloy (as will nearly
always be the case in practice) if it is allowed to cool slowly.  Some
form of separation will occur on freezing, and this can give rise to an
intermediate “mushy” zone in which liquid and solid material can
coexist in what can be a region of substantial size.  The dendritic
freezing of a eutectic mixture is a case in point.22
In many of the problems considered here, the change of phase is
brought about by an input of energy from a laser beam.  This is usually
the case when the boundary is one at which boiling takes place.  If the
absorbed normal incident intensity is I, then I needs to be added to the
right-hand side of (2.47) since I is, in effect, an addition to the definition
of 


the absence of relative motion between the two states.

2.2.3  Dynamical boundary conditions

To find the right-hand side it is necessary to consider further the
form that

 takes.  In this instance the generating quantity is surface
tension.  Suppose the surface tension is γ and consider the force on an
element S in the surface whose perimeter is C.  See Figure 2.9.

where dr is the length of an element of C and b is a unit vector

usual convention is employed that the direction of description of C is in
a right-handed sense relative to the normal n of S.  The direction must,
of course, be consistently defined over the whole of S; arbitrary
exchanges of direction from one part of S to another are not allowed.  It
will be assumed that S can be described as a member of a family of
surfaces in the manner described above.  See Figure 2.10.

2.2.4  Other conditions
There are some further conditions that are not of conservation type.
Thus, the usual condition at an interface between two different
phases is that the temperature should be continuous.  So, for example,

The same is true at a boundary between different solid phases, as in
steel, for example.  Some caution is needed, however, in the case of a
strongly evaporating boundary where the presence of a Knudsen26 layer
can affect the result.
In the case of a viscous liquid, there will be a no-slip condition on
the tangential component of velocity.  This will apply whether the
interface is between a solid and a fluid region, or between two fluid
phases.  Thus

2.2.5  Comments on the fluid boundary conditions
There are at least two particular problems when it comes to
constructing simple analytical models of processes such as welding
when a deliberate attempt is made to include a reasonably realistic
allowance for fluid motion.  One is the difficulty raised by the fact that
the location of the boundary between different phases of the metal is
itself a part of the solution of the problem; the other is the fact that
liquid phases satisfy the equations of fluid dynamics.  These, in all but
their simplest forms, are nonlinear and are capable of very complicated
flows that are not easily described in analytical terms, and are indeed
hard to obtain by computational methods.  The flow in the vapor phase
is often at or near the turbulent regime, and the motion in the weld pool
is known from observation to be complicated.28

It can be argued that a linearized version of the Navier-Stokes
Equation (2.23), which includes the effects of viscosity, can sometimes
be usefully employed.  An alternative approach might be to use an
adaptation of classical boundary layer theory.29  A very fruitful
approach to the solution of fluid dynamical problems in the past has
been to use the Euler Equation (2.17) in which viscous effects are
entirely ignored.  This approximation is generally used in fluid
dynamics in connection with the assumption that the flow is irrotational
and incompressible, so that there exists a velocity potential φ satisfying
Laplace’s Equation (2.18).  A problem with this approximation is that in
welding problems, for example, the fluid in question is metal that has
only just become molten.  The time scale of its subsequent motion may
be so short that there is no reason to suppose that viscous forces can
damp out any vorticity present.  At first sight it might seem plausible
that, since the material melts from a state in which the motion is parallel
and uniform and thus has no vorticity, then the molten flow will also
have no vorticity.  That, however, is not necessarily the case.  Because
most of the material in the molten zone actually flows around the
keyhole, there has to be a transverse flow that must be generated by a
pressure gradient in the molten region.  A simple example will serve to
show the appropriate boundary conditions, and it will be seen that the
liquid does not clearly satisfy an irrotational condition on melting.

incompressible liquid across a channel in which there is a transverse
pressure gradient, as shown in Figure 2.11.

Thus, the natural conditions to apply in such problems are that
(i)
the normal component of mass flux and the tangential
component of velocity are continuous at a melting
boundary,
(ii) the normal component of the mass flux is continuous at a
freezing boundary.

These conditions may lead to irrotational flow in special
circumstances, but in general will not.  If the irrotational approximation
is nonetheless used as a worthwhile simplification of an otherwise
intractable problem, it is therefore advisable in principle to estimate the
error introduced to check that it is small enough not to invalidate the
main conclusions of the particular investigation.
2.2.6  Elastic boundary conditions
Thermoelastic problems in material science can usually be divided
into two parts, one with a response time scale of the thermal problem,
and one with a purely elastic character and a much more rapid response.
Only problems in which conditions are quasi-steady will be considered,
so that a representation is used in which there is no explicit dependence
on time.  Typical boundary conditions are then the same as those for
steady, purely elastic problems.
One type of problem is that in which the surface tractions are
specified on part or all of the boundary.  This constitutes a condition on
the stress tensor, so that typically
i
j
ijn
p
τ
=
(2.60)
on the boundary.  The normal to the surface is n, and the specified
surface traction is τ.  On a free boundary, for instance, 
0
.n
p
=
.
Sometimes, however, the displacement on the surface may be given
so that the condition on those parts of the surface is
0
ξ
ξ =
(2.61)
where 
0
ξ  is the specified displacement.  So, for example, a portion of
the boundary that is rigidly fixed will satisfy the condition 
0
=
ξ
.
In some problems, however, a mixed condition may be more
appropriate.  In laser welding, for example, the workpiece may be
clamped.  This is necessary for various reasons.  One might be to attach
it to the work table so that it can be accurately moved relative to the
© 2001 by Chapman & Hall/CRC  

laser; another might be to attempt to minimize deformations.  The forces
involved can be very substantial so that, although it may be possible to
prevent deformations far from the treatment area normal to the work-
piece, the clamps may not be able to prevent small but significant lateral
deformation.  The whole effect of clamping a workpiece does not
appear to be well understood, but it may be that a more appropriate set
of conditions under some circumstances, rather than (2.60) or (2.61),
might be
0

 for all

(2.62)
This last condition represents no deformation in the direction held by
the clamps, but no effective constraint on lateral motion.
2.3  SUMMARY OF EQUATIONS AND CONDITIONS
2.3.1  General
The purpose here is to list those equations that are most used in the
rest of this book.  They are not the most general versions of the
equations in question.  Unless stated otherwise, the forms given are
time-independent and the material parameters, such as thermal
conductivity, for example, are taken to be constants.  The meanings of
the symbols employed in each context are given.  There really are not
enough letters in the Greek and Roman alphabets, however.  It is
inevitable that some symbols will be used to mean several different
things, and different authors may use symbols in different ways.  For
example, the Greek letter ν is commonly used for the kinematic
viscosity of a liquid and for the Poisson’s ratio of an elastic solid, and in
some fonts is almost indistinguishable from italic v – as here.  A further
complication is provided by the fact that more than one symbol may be
used for the same quantity; σ is also often used for Poisson’s ratio, for
instance.  It should be clear from the context what is intended, but the
reader needs to be aware of the problems of notation, and to be clear
what conventions are being used by the author of the work being read.
Under each heading, standard forms for the equations and boundary
conditions are given that are suitable for the kinds of problems
considered.  Also listed are the symbols used, their SI base units, and
their names, together with related and derived symbols.  After their

square brackets.

CHAPTER 3
THE TEMPERATURE IN BLOCKS AND PLATES
______________________________
3.1 THE TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION
In many forms of laser technology the coherent light from the laser
forms a spot that can be a concentrated source of heat or, in laser surface
treatment, for example, a rather more diffuse region of heating.  Some
of the techniques used in the simpler mathematical models that first
found use in welding problems in fact prove to be of considerable value
in more general contexts.  In particular, the point and line source
solutions associated in the context of welding with the name of
Rosenthal,1 but also very well described from a rather different point of
view by Carslaw and Jaeger,2 have proved to be extremely useful.  They
will be derived first before considering specific applications, after which
they will be used to obtain simple descriptions of the temperature in a
workpiece.  More elaborate models can be developed later.
From these elementary solutions it is possible to build up more
complex solutions to describe different incident intensity distributions at
the surface of the workpiece.  They can be extended to cover time-
dependent situations.  The line solution can be applied to a plate of
finite thickness as well as an infinite or semi-infinite workpiece.  The
point solution in its basic form only applies to an infinite or semi-
infinite workpiece, but it can be extended very simply to cover other
cases, such as a plate of finite thickness, for example.
In various ways it is therefore possible to solve more complicated
problems in terms of these simple analytical solutions, an approach that
can lead to better understanding before resorting to more complicated
computational methods.
Whatever approach is used for the power of the incident radiation

and the energy transfer mechanisms, the result is a prediction for the
temperature distribution in the workpiece.  It can then be used as the
basis for further calculation to obtain such quantities as
• the thermal history of individual points in the workpiece;
• metallurgical properties deduced from the thermal histories;
• more accurate solutions for the temperature distribution, using the
point and line source solution as the first stage of an iterative
scheme, which might be analytical or, more usually, numerical;
• the consequences of varying the absorption models in order to test
their validity and reliability;
• the distribution of thermal stress in the workpiece;
• the deformation of the workpiece resulting from thermal stress.

In most problems that occur in the theory of material processing,
there is no additional heat input.  The remainder of the workpiece acts
as a heat sink and the value far from the origin is expected to tend to T0.
If we look at the exponential multiplying B, we see that

, so that the coefficient of B tends to infinity as x tends to infinity,
far downstream of the heat source.  Since this is inconsistent with the
normal conditions of such problems, the coefficient B must be zero.
It is now only necessary to provide an interpretation of A.  A certain
amount of care is needed at this point since the interpretation depends
on whether the origin is at the surface of a workpiece or in the interior.
The following discussion assumes that it is in the interior.  Consider a
small sphere Σ of radius a centered on the origin and estimate the flux of
heat out of the surface of the sphere (see Figure 3.2).  As much thermal

energy flows into the sphere across its boundaries as flows out across
them.  Hence, the only contribution to the flux is the part due to
Fourier’s law, and this has to be summed over the surface of the sphere;
i.e., the total power flowing across the surface is

The second argument in this generalized notation for "point," written
here as uˆ , is a unit vector in the direction of translation and can usually
be omitted since, in any given problem, it will always be the same.
There is a difference, however, if the point source is at the surface of
a semi-infinite workpiece defined only in 
0
≥
z
 (see Figure 3.4).

3.2.2  Applications of the point source solution
The point source solution can be very useful in the construction of
solutions to problems in which there is a specified incident intensity
distribution.  The reason for this is because x, y, and z do not appear
explicitly in the equation of heat conduction;

the surface of the workpiece, not its interior.  See Equation (3.7).  But in
that case all that is needed is to use the linearity of the equation of heat
conduction (when the coefficients are all constants) to add the
individual contributions together for each such small element of area in
the surface, giving a temperature distribution that is approximately

The total power in both cases is P.  Figures 3.5 and 3.6 show graphs
of these intensities together with the corresponding contour maps.
Variation of the ratio a:A:B affects the aspect of the fall-off region
around the edge of the basic rectangle, with a small value of a giving a
sharply-defined edge, and a larger value a less well-defined boundary.
In general, the integrations will have to be performed numerically to
find the temperature below the surface.
Equation (3.12) can be obtained from (3.11) by integrating it over the
rectangle using the same power for each individual elementary Gaussian
source.  The same integration technique can be used to study the effect
of arrays of other shapes.
Care must be taken, however, in the use of (3.10) if the incident
intensity is discontinuous, as would be the case of the "top-hat" intensity
distribution

and a double numerical integration is usually necessary.  There is one
circumstance where a worthwhile approximation is sometimes
available.  Suppose that the intensity distribution is characterized by a

If the Péclet number is large, the exponential falls very rapidly from
the maximum value as θ  departs from zero and the integrand is
effectively zero.  What this means is that if

The advantage here is that only a single integral needs to be
evaluated rather than a double one.  Figure 3.8 shows a graph of the
surface temperature that results from a Gaussian surface intensity
distribution (3.11), while Figure 3.9 shows the graph of temperature at
the surface from the quasi-rectangular distribution given by (3.12).  In
both cases the parameters chosen for the purpose of the numerical
examples are those typical for the laser scabbling of concrete;
qualitatively, however, the results are typical when the Péclet number is
high.
From (3.14) it follows that when the Péclet number is high, the order
of magnitude of the temperature rise is

In the case of concrete, for example, it leads to a maximum temperature
of 331 K above ambient in the case of the given Gaussian beam, and
621 K in the case of the quasi-rectangular beam.

3.3 THE TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION IN PLATES
The techniques discussed so far for finding the temperature
distribution have assumed that there is a heat input at the surface z = 0
of a semi-infinite workpiece that occupies the region 
0
≥
z
.  It has also
© 2001 by Chapman & Hall/CRC  

been assumed that there is no heat loss from the surface, either by
evaporation from any region of liquid metal (if the temperature is high
enough for there to be one), by radiation, by convective cooling, or,
indeed, by any other mechanism.  In that case, the surface condition on
the temperature is simply that
0
=
∂
∂
z
T
,
(3.16)
except on those parts of the surface where there is a known power input,
in which case the z derivative of T is known.  In most of the problems
considered, most of the mechanisms neglected result in only very small
heat losses.  The one exception is the case of convective heat loss,
which can sometimes be significant.  A simple model is to assume that
it is proportional to the excess temperature of the surface.  This
contribution is very often neglected when it is not the principal subject
of the investigation for which the model is being constructed, but in
practice it can be significant.
The solutions considered so far assume that the workpiece is very
thick – thick enough, that is, for the effect on the temperature
distribution of the lower boundary to be negligible.  From the solution
for the point source in the form given in Equation (3.5) it is clear that
there is a length scale in the problem equal to 
U
κ
2
.  This is in addition
to the length scale, a, of the incident intensity and of the thickness of the
workpiece itself, h.  From the expression for the temperature in the
interior of the workpiece given by the convolution in Equation (3.8) it
follows that the temperature tends to zero in a manner that depends
primarily on that length scale.  Consequently, if
U
h
κ
2
>>
,
(3.17)
the presence of the bottom boundary does not play a significant role.  If,
however, the condition is not satisfied some account must be taken of it.
In the same way that heat loss at the surface has been ignored, only
the case where there is no heat loss from the bottom will be considered
so that condition (3.16) also applies at 
h

Because of the way in which the solution is built up by means of
reflections, it is often known as the "method of images",6 especially
when used in conjunction with the point and line source solutions.  It
can be generalized to other boundary shapes.
For example, the temperature distribution in a semi-infinite work-
piece given by a point source at the surface is given by Equation (3.7) as

Since the point source solution satisfies the conditions necessary for
the application of the method of images, a solution constructed from the
point source solution by the method of Section 3.2 also satisfies the
conditions.

3.4  FRESNEL ABSORPTION
Energy absorption by the workpiece from the laser can involve a
direct process7 with the laser light incident on a surface as well as other
indirect processes.  There exists a simple electromagnetic model for
absorption at a metal surface that is widely used, especially in the
context of keyhole modeling at the wavelength of a CO2 laser.  At that
wavelength the assumptions of a simple model of electromagnetic
interaction involving resistive dissipation are justifiable as a useful
approximation, 
although 
at 
shorter 
wavelengths 
it 
becomes
progressively more suspect.  The model does not make allowance for
surface impurities and must therefore be used with an understanding of
its limitations.
This direct absorption process is usually referred to as Fresnel
absorption. A formula for the reflection coefficient  that is frequently
quoted,8 and which applies to circularly polarized light, is

It will be seen that there is a strong dependence on the angle of
incidence with a marked minimum close to 
π
θ
2

, indicating that
absorption is strongest at near-grazing incidence.  For normal incidence,
however, as much as 85% of the incident power can be reflected.  This
figure can be very greatly modified by surface impurities or other
additives introduced as part of the process.
3.5 THE LINE SOURCE SOLUTION
The line source solution can be obtained in essentially the same way
as the point source.  The difference is that a solution is sought that
depends only on the coordinate in the direction of translation x and
distance from the z-axis, but is independent of distance in the z-
direction.  As before, it is assumed that the workpiece is moving
steadily parallel to the x-axis with velocity U, and that all the material
parameters are constants.  Consequently, the temperature satisfies
Equation (3.1); Figure 3.14 shows the relative geometry and the co-
ordinate system.  Once again, look for a solution of the form given by
Equation (3.2) so that S is given by (3.3).

In order to make use of this solution it is helpful to understand the
character of the two functions I0 and K0.  Figure 3.15 shows the graphs
of each of them on the same axis.  The most important points to notice
are the following.
• 
I0 increases indefinitely as s′ increases;
• 
K0 tends to zero as s′ increases;
                                                          
9 It should be remembered that the use of r to mean both radial distance from
the origin of spherical polar coordinates and the distance from the axis in
cylindrical polars is very common.  The symbol s is used here to avoid
confusion, but the usage is not standard.

The condition that there is no additional heat input to the remainder

Looking at the multiple of A, notice that 
0

x
 if 
0

, so that
the coefficient of A tends to infinity as x tends to infinity far from the
heat source; consequently, the coefficient A must be zero.
An interpretation of B is possible in the same way as before; once
again some care is needed depending on whether the z-axis is in the
surface of a semi-infinite workpiece or in the interior of an infinite one.
The following discussion assumes that it is in the interior.
Consider a small cylinder C of radius a centered on the axis and
estimate the flux of heat from its surface per unit length; see Figure
3.16.  As much thermal energy flows into the cylinder across its
boundaries as flows out across them.  The only contribution to the flux
is the part due to Fourier’s law, and this has to be summed over the
surface of the cylinder; i.e., the total power flowing across the surface
per unit length is

As before, the symmetry of the isotherms ensures that the solution is
still a valid temperature distribution so long as no account is taken of
heat loss by radiation, convective cooling, or any other means across the

slab.
Just as the point source solution can be used to construct further
solutions by adding together individual solutions or, in the limit,
integrating over them, so, too, the line source solution can be used in
exactly the same way.  Suppose it is desired to find the temperature
distribution in a semi-infinite block whose surface

 is subject to an
incident intensity, whose absorbed value is

TIME-DEPENDENT SOLUTIONS IN BLOCKS
______________________________
4.1  TIME-DEPENDENT ONE-DIMENSIONAL SOLUTIONS
Consider the problem of the semi-infinite rod in 
0
>
x
 that is
initially at temperature T0 everywhere along its length.  At time 
0
=
t
the end at 
0
=
x
 is raised to temperature T1.  A solution can be found
using dimensional analysis because there are so few dimensional
quantities involved in the problem.  A temperature scale is provided by
the difference 
0
1
T
T −
.  The only other dimensional quantities in the
problem are the thermal diffusivity κ  (units, m2 s−1), the length x, and
the time t.  Only one independent dimensionless ratio can be formed
from these, namely 
t
x
κ
2
.  This can be seen by considering 
c

can be whatever is most convenient, 1 mm, 10 cm, or any other scale;
the solution always has the same shape but is stretched out to a greater

A point source-type solution at the origin can be obtained for Equation
(4.7) in exactly the same way as for the time-independent case studied
in Section 3.1.  Even the argument that provides the multiple
corresponding to the power of the source is the same provided the
power is replaced by its Laplace transform.  It has the form

Simon, Gratzke, and Kroos in their study of a cylindrical keyhole with a

The functions given by (4.12) and (4.13) are appropriate for one
Fourier component of a time-dependent point source, while Equation
(4.14) applies in the same way to a line source.  It is then possible to
construct solutions of time-dependent problems in terms of these point
and line source solutions employing all the same techniques that apply
to the steady-state case, with the aid of Fourier analysis.
As an illustration of the way in which these solutions can be
employed to find the temperature distribution for a time-dependent heat
source, consider the problem posed by a heat source at the origin
(0,0,0)  of Cartesian coordinates.  Suppose its absorbed power is
periodic with period t0 and is given in the interval

The solution given here for the periodic time-dependent point source
can be used as the starting point for the construction of periodic
solutions for other incident beam shapes.  The method is the same as the
one demonstrated in Section 3.2 for the steady case.  Equations (3.9)
and (3.10) still apply, with the substitution of the periodic solution given
© 2001 by Chapman & Hall/CRC  

by (4.13) in place of the point source solution.  From this, Fourier
analysis can be used to obtain the solution when there is a given time
dependence within the cycle.  The procedure is no more complicated
than it is for the examples worked here, but the resulting expressions
tend to be lengthy.

feature is that the Bessel function has a complex argument.  Definitions
and formulae for the evaluation of Bessel functions with complex
arguments can be found in the literature,9 and the latest versions of some
numerical algebra computer packages are capable of evaluating them.
They do not lend themselves, however, to solutions that can be written
in terms of standard real-valued functions in the way that the point
source solution does.  There is no simple equivalent, for example, to
Equation (4.18) as an alternative to (4.17) as there is for the point
source.

4.4 THE THERMAL HISTORY OF A MATERIAL ELEMENT
In a great many problems in material processing it is extremely
convenient to use a coordinate system that is fixed with respect to the
power source.  The reason is that after a time, conditions may become
quasi-steady if the power of the source remains constant, as is the case
for a laser in a cw mode of working.  Dependence on time can then be
dropped from the problem once a steady state has been reached, and that
leads to a great deal of simplification in the mathematical models.  In
such a coordinate system, any function of the coordinate vector r and
time t is the value of the function at that particular point and that
particular time.  This is true irrespective of what particular material
element happens to be there at the time, even when conditions have not
reached a steady state.  Thus, for example, (
)

u
 and (
)
2
,t

 will in
general refer to the velocity of entirely different elements, even though
they are measured at the same position in space relative to the heat
source.  Such a description is usually referred to as an Eulerian
description and has a great many advantages.  It does, however, have the
disadvantage that it is hard to track such things as the thermal history of
a fluid element.
An alternative way of describing what happens is to use a co-
ordinate system that refers everything to the initial position of each
material element.  Such a description is called a Lagrangian description.
Suppose that at time 
0
=
t
 a particular material element is at the point
whose coordinates in a fixed Cartesian frame of reference are
(

condition

)
0,
(
; the velocity of this element at time t is then (
)t,a

where the dot indicates differentiation with respect to time.  Suppose the
velocity in an Eulerian description of the motion is (
)t,r
u
 and this is
regarded as known (from a solution obtained in the Eulerian frame of
reference, for example).  It is then possible to find (

 by solving the

In general, this is not a particularly simple matter, and normally requires
a computed solution rather than an analytical one.
Matters are rather simpler, however, if every element of the work-
piece moves with a constant velocity, as will be the case to a good
degree of approximation if the workpiece is solid and is moved steadily
past the power source.10  Then

Unlike the case of the steady state considered in the previous examples,

As an example of the kind of use to which this can be put, expression
(4.24) could be used to find the maximum temperature experienced by
each material element. This is a relatively difficult operation.  For each
a,b,c the maximum value of the temperature experienced by that
particular element has to be found, either by investigating the zeros of
its t-derivative or numerically.  It is then possible to draw graphs or
contour plots of the maximum temperature experienced by the elements
of the workpiece.  One could consider cross-sections perpendicular to
the laser in figure 4.15, which shows a simple graph of the temperature
in the workpiece on the surface.  With this particular example, the
maximum temperature is infinite but the graph has been truncated.
Such information could be used to see which parts of the material reach
melting temperature or some other critical phase transition.  Other
quantities, such as the maximum rate of change of temperature, or more
complicated criteria can be investigated in the same way.  Numerical
examples such as this show how useful such methods can be.

way in which the maximum temperature experienced by any element of

surface is shown for the example of (4.24).  The input power is pulsed
and the graph is spatially periodic.  With a suitable value for the melting
isotherm (with the parameters used in the given example, the melting
isotherm corresponds to a value if 1.67 for steel) it is possible to
construct this isotherm.

CHAPTER 5
MOVING BOUNDARY PROBLEMS
______________________________
5.1  STEFAN PROBLEMS
There are special effects at any change in phase of a material that
require the input or release of heat.  Familiar examples are the additional
energy needed to melt water, or the scalding caused by the condensation
of steam as it releases its latent heat.  The same may be true at less
obvious transitions between different metallurgical states.1  From the
point of view of thermal modeling these are all very similar, involving
as they do the solution of a problem in heat conduction with an internal
boundary (drilling problems are similar,2 as is laser cutting.3)  The
location of the boundary is not known in advance, and is, in fact, a part
of the solution of the problem. Problems of this kind are often referred
to as Stefan problems.
As an illustration, consider a long uniform column of cross-sectional
area A thermally insulated from its surroundings.  The top is filled with
water whose surface is at 
( )t
Z
z
B
=
.  Its surface is being boiled away by
an incident intensity I  kW s−1.  It will be assumed constant and that all
of it is absorbed.  Below is a layer of water, and below that again a layer
of ice whose temperature very far down has the constant value

(t

=
.  Since the ice is cooler than the water it can conduct heat
away from the interface between the two and, consequently, there is a
moving boundary of melting water advancing into the ice.  See Figure
5.1 for a diagram of the geometry of the problem.

In general, this is a relatively complicated initial value problem, but
if time is allowed to elapse sufficiently, a quasi-steady state can occur in
which both the boiling and melting boundaries move downward with a
constant velocity U.  Suppose that the surface is at

The second of each pair of conditions express the requirement that the
latent heat LV released on boiling and LM released on freezing are
conducted away entirely into the ice.  Notice that there are two more
conditions than one would normally expect for a second-order equation.
The additional conditions are necessary since neither the location of the
boiling surface nor the melting interface is known in advance.

Although the example has been presented in terms of water and ice,
the same idea is directly applicable to a simple model of laser drilling in
which lateral conduction is ignored.  It also illustrates the way in which
the location of the boundary between different phases is a part of the
solution of Stefan problems.  This is also entirely characteristic of
welding problems.  A further point to notice is that the latent heat has a
central part to play.  By way of illustration, we can consider the same
problem but ignore the latent heat of melting.  This is equivalent to
setting it equal to zero in the above analysis.  The solution for the
temperature is then given by

It will be seen that there are differences from the solution in which
latent heat is included.  It is quite common in simple analytical models
of welding processes or thermal treatment, for example, to ignore the
contribution due to the latent heat of melting or other phase changes.
There is often some justification for the approximation, but it is
necessary to be aware that it is an approximation and its accuracy
should be verified in the given context.

The same technique can be applied once a steady state has been
reached when the material constants of the different phases are not the
same, or when there are more than two phases.  The problem becomes
more complex notationally, but the general principles are the same.

the problem is reduced to one in which there is no latent heat at the two

therefore exactly as above, but with L1 and L2 set zero and the thermal

An example of a problem such as this is the melting of a solder wire
by a hot soldering iron, although the boundary conditions are somewhat
different.  The end to which the iron is applied is at a fixed temperature
that is higher than the temperature of the wire.  The melting zone then
moves gradually along the length of the wire.  It is not to be expected
that its velocity is independent of time, and a somewhat different
technique is necessary for its solution.
The first solution to be found for problems of change of state was of
this type.  It is known as Neumann’s problem.

5.2 NEUMANN’S PROBLEM7
Neumann’s solution exploits the properties of the time-dependent
solution (4.3) of the equation of heat conduction in one dimension,
Equation (5.1), which is a special case of Equation (2.6).  The error-
function solution has special properties that make it very useful for
problems of this type.

CHAPTER 6
SIMPLE MODELS OF LASER KEYHOLE WELDING
______________________________
6.1  LASER KEYHOLE WELDING
Some of the techniques used in the simpler mathematical models that
have been found to be of use in laser welding will be introduced in this
chapter.  In particular, it will be shown how the point and line source
solutions introduced in Chapter 2 and associated with the name of
Rosenthal can be used to obtain simple descriptions of the temperature
in a workpiece.  From these, more elaborate models can be developed to
obtain insight before more complicated models need to be constructed.
We shall then look at some more advanced but useful analytical models
of the solid and liquid phases, and consider features of the dynamics of
the keyhole.
In laser welding, as in surface heat treatment and laser cutting, for
example, coherent light from the laser forms a spot that can be a
concentrated source of heat or perhaps a rather more diffuse region of
heating.   It is often helpful in some of these applications to model the
action of the laser as a point source on the surface of the workpiece.  In
the case of keyhole welding, however, a line source solution and
modifications of that idea can be useful for simulating the penetration of
the laser into the workpiece.
The line source simulates a laser-generated keyhole.  It can be either
partially or fully penetrating.  It can be of variable length in practice and
either constant or varying in strength with depth, but in that case a
modification to the basic theory is needed.  More complicated sources
can be constructed.  The standard models treat the case of a workpiece
that translates with a uniform velocity U with respect to the laser, as in
laser welding.
Energy absorption by the workpiece from the laser can involve a
direct interaction with the laser light incident on a surface.  This process
is usually referred to as Fresnel absorption (see Section 3.4); the
© 2001 by Chapman & Hall/CRC  

absorbed laser light can, however, vaporize material to form a keyhole
that may contain ionized vapor. Indirect absorption then occurs by the
following two-stage process.  Primary absorption takes place in the
vapor in the keyhole, which is then transmitted to the walls of the
keyhole by thermal conduction in the vapor and other processes.
The laser energy enters the workpiece from the walls of the keyhole,
which to a first approximation can be thought of as a circular cylinder,
and melts the material by the process of heat conduction forming a weld
pool.  Complicated motion of the material usually occurs in this weld
pool. The three regions are shown schematically in Figure 6.1.  The
boundary of the molten region of the weld pool is identified by the
melting isotherm of the material.  Beyond this lies the solid material.
Heat can be transported in the liquid molten region by both convection
and conduction processes; in the solid region heat is transported relative
to the material of the workpiece by conduction processes only.

Here ρ is the density, U is the velocity of translation, cp is the specific
heat of the material of the workpiece at constant pressure, and λ is the
thermal conductivity of the workpiece; κ is the thermal diffusivity.  In
this expression   is a characteristic length scale of the process.  It might
be the beam radius of the laser, for example, or one of the principal
dimensions of the weld pool.  The relevant scale is likely to depend on
the particular aspect of interest in the process being studied.  Low
translation speeds of the workpiece are usually associated with small
values of the Péclet number.  It is a dimensionless measure of the
relative importance of convected to conducted heat.

problems of convective heat transfer.  The equation of heat conduction
is central, and from Equation (2.6) is

 is the velocity of its translation relative to the laser beam.  It is
customary, though not essential, to use a frame of reference in which the
laser beam is stationary. The full set of equations governing the motion
of the solid and liquid phases of the workpiece, and the transfer of
thermal energy within it, are given by Equations (2.6) and (2.24).  A
number of simplifying assumptions are commonly made, however.  One
© 2001 by Chapman & Hall/CRC  

of these is that all material parameters are constant.  In reality, such
things as the density, the conductivity, etc. will depend on temperature
T, but inclusion of this feature is often not justified by the degree of
accuracy of information required or available.
An additional approximation is to assume that in a frame of reference
stationary with respect to the laser, a steady state has been achieved.
Yet another approximation is to ignore the complicated fluid
mechanical motion in the weld pool and thermally induced changes of
volume in the solid phase of the workpiece, and assume that all the
material is moving unidirectionally with the same velocity U.
A further set of assumptions often made is to suppose that the latent
heat of fusion does not play a major role in determining such things as
the weld width, and that the parameters of the material have the same
values in the liquid and solid states.
These are very substantial assumptions, but nonetheless their use can
lead to helpful insights and results that are not necessarily quantitatively
very wrong if carefully used.  The equation of heat conduction under
assumptions of this kind then takes the relatively simple form

6.2  POINT AND LINE SOURCE MODELS
The point source and line source solutions of Rosenthal1 introduced
in Chapter 3, Equations (3.5) and (3.22), are two very simple exact
solutions of the equation of heat conduction.  They give the temperature
field in the workpiece when the source of power is in steady relative
motion and a steady state has been achieved.  From the time of their
discovery, they have been very influential as simple models that give
the temperature and the power absorption of a uniform, infinite, or semi-

infinite workpiece.  The point source can be used as a model of a simple
conduction weld, and the line source as a model of keyhole welding.
There are, however, limitations to them.  A particularly obvious
example in the context of the use of lasers for welding is the failure of
the line source to describe the “nail-head” shape of the cross-section of
the fusion zone in the case of the keyhole weld, as illustrated by the
examples shown in Figure 6.2.  A line source model by itself could lead
only to a parallel-sided weld of infinite extent, while a point source
model would lead to a weld that is approximately semicircular in cross
section.  The weld in Figure 6.2(a) has a distinct nail-head section at the
top, a feature that is clearly present, though to a much less extent, in the
weld of Figure 6.2(b).  In neither weld is the continuation downward
parallel-sided.

in 1.25 cm-thick C-Mn microalloyed low-oxygen steel plate with a laser
power of 6 kW and a speed of 0.58 cm s−1.
The insight that has allowed the development of simple ideas such as
this into more realistic tools for the description of welding was the
suggestion that a superposition of a point and a line source might
provide a more satisfactory description of a keyhole weld.  The idea
proved to be extremely successful and has led to numerous adaptations
and elaborations.  For example, multiple point sources can be included
to represent absorption occurring preferentially in other parts of the
© 2001 by Chapman & Hall/CRC  

work-piece than just at the surface.  A nonuniform but continuous
distribution of sources can be used to model the variation of width of the
fused material of the weld, and the same idea can be extended to allow
for curvature in the keyhole.2  Similarly, they can be used to describe a
nonuniform input over a region of the surface.  It is even possible to
extend the idea at any of these levels of sophistication to describe time-
dependent phenomena, and pulsed welding in particular.  The virtue of
these models is their simplicity compared to the full formulation of such
problems in theoretical form, which normally requires the use of
sophisticated software.  It is possible to gain valuable qualitative insight
by these methods.  Such ideas can be used to describe the power
absorption characteristics of a given weld as a function of depth or,
alternatively, with the aid of simple models of the absorption process, to
predict the cross-section of the weld.  The temperature field obtained
from them can be used to identify the heat-affected zone, or to estimate
metallurgical properties.
In the point and line source models of laser keyhole welding, there
can be a basic uniform line source with the addition of further point
sources.  There could be one on the surface whose effect is given by
Equation (3.7), one or more in the interior of the workpiece, using
formula (3.2), or even a  point source above the surface of the work-
piece, a modification that has been used, for example, to describe the
modeling of the laser welding of copper.3  See Figure 6.3.

it has been necessary to introduce the fourth term on the right of (6.3),
which is in fact the image of the third term.  Note that the axis of the
line source is perpendicular to the plate.
Figure 6.4 shows isotherms of this in the case when P1 = 400 W,
P2 = 0, and Q1 =  2.3 kW cm−1 with U = 5.8 mm s−1 , so that the formula
represents a keyhole weld with the "nailhead" feature.  The section
shown is about 0.3 mm behind the axis of the laser and corresponds
approximately to the widest part of the molten region.  The parameters
are roughly those appropriate to the example of Figure (6.2b).  The
values for the thermal conductivity and diffusivity used were those for
the liquid rather than the solid phase.  It will be seen that the total power

 W, is a good deal less than the
nominal laser power.  This figure does not include the power needed to
ablate material from the keyhole wall or power lost from the ends of the
keyhole.  There is a general qualitative similarity on the assumption of
an absorption coefficient of the order of 0.5.  The nail-head feature is
not represented too well however, and the parallel-sided bottom part of
the keyhole is very unrealistic.

The original application was to welds in thick specimens with a point
source at the surface and a uniform line source.  For this purpose the
condition of zero heat loss from the bottom of the workpiece was
unimportant.  As a qualitative description it was excellent, but there
were quantitative discrepancies, the most notable of which was the fact
that the lower part of the weld is not parallel-sided.  The addition of a
point source in the interior can be useful in an attempt to describe the
welding of zinc-coated steel sheets.4  For this purpose a second point

source in the interior of the weld is a natural extension to the original
idea to represent the absorption and ablation of the zinc coatings
between the two layers.  The problems posed by both features can be
overcome in the same way.  The constant line source is clearly
inappropriate but can be replaced by a continuous distribution of point
sources whose strengths vary with position along the line, giving rise to
a line source of varying strength.  A problem, however, is that the
boundary conditions at the surface and bottom of the workpiece are not
satisfied.  On the assumption that no heat is lost through these surfaces,
the difficulty is easily overcome by employing image sources.  For each
point source and each of its images there must be a reflection in each
boundary, leading to a complete infinite image system that can be
represented schematically as in Figure 6.5.  All the images are of the
same strength in the heat theory examples considered here, in which the
boundaries are parallel planes.

sided metal sheet, here oriented vertically.  The black spot represents the
real point source, the shaded region the workpiece, the hollow circles the
image sources and the thin lines the image boundaries of the workpiece.
It will be noticed that a point source at the surface can be regarded as
the limiting case when a point source just below the surface and its
image just above the surface are forced to coincide.  This is another way
of understanding the origin of the factor 2 in Equation (3.7).  If the

It will be noticed that the function inside the summation sign in this
solution is of exactly the same kind as the function S of Section 2.3 and
that the resulting expression for the temperature is then the same as
Equation (3.18).  Exactly the same principle can be extended to a
continuous distribution of point sources along a curve C in the thickness
of the workpiece.  Suppose that the power absorbed per unit length of

This function S has exactly the properties required of S in Section 3.3.
Consequently, the temperature distribution in a plate caused by the
variable line source consisting of the distribution of sources along C is
again given by (3.18) with S given by (6.4).
The same principle can also be applied to distributions of point
sources over a surface.  Normally however the surface will be the
© 2001 by Chapman & Hall/CRC  

surface of the workpiece and will have to be flat for the method to
apply.
These ideas can be extended to regions with more complicated
boundaries consisting of suitable straight-line sections or circles.
The idea has been applied to models of laser lap-welding of thin
sheets of zinc-coated steel.5  Two point sources were used, one located
at the surface and one at the point of interface of the two sheets, together
with a line source whose strength varied with position.  The latter is
constructed as a continuous distribution of point sources combined by
integration. The boundary conditions were satisfied using the image
technique just described.  Figure 6.6 shows some examples.  It will be
seen that a degree of realism is possible with this representation that is
not achievable with a single point source and a line source of constant
strength.  By making a guess at the forms for the individual elements it
is possible to deduce likely distributions for the absorption at different
depths in the weld.  It should be noticed, however, that this is a difficult
inverse problem and it is not easy to use it to draw accurate inferences
about the power absorption characteristics of the process, helpful as
such a procedure might be. All the same, in the long run it may be that
use as a diagnostic tool proves to be the most useful application of the
point and line source idea.

The entire problem of studying the welding process in principle
requires the solution of systems of partial differential equations in a
minimum of three separate regions (the solid, liquid, and vapor phases).
There are interfaces between them that have to be determined as part of
the solution of the problem (an example of what is known as a Stefan
problem). It is conventional, therefore, to make assumptions about those
parts of the process that are not the immediate subject of study.  If what
is required is a reasonably accurate knowledge of the temperature
distribution far from the keyhole, as would be needed for example to
determine the boundary of the weld itself, the heat affected zone, or the
variation of metallurgical properties with position, it is an unwanted
complication to have to perform detailed keyhole modeling in order to
obtain the absorption profile of the keyhole.  Such a process even
involves the necessity of finding the keyhole size and shape. All this is
necessary as well as the solution of Equation (6.1) in a region whose
boundary is itself the keyhole wall that is determined by the heat
balance condition.  The process seems unduly cumbersome.  What is
required is information at a substantial distance from the keyhole, where
the influence of its detailed shape and absorption characteristics might
be assumed to be relatively unimportant.
It is in circumstances such as these that the strengths and weaknesses
of the point and line source idea might profitably be exploited. The
strengths are obvious in that the temperature distribution can be
approximated without having to resort to obtaining special solutions of
the equation of heat conduction.  If the power distribution along the line
source can be determined, the superposition principle can then be used
to obtain the temperature far from the keyhole.  The principal weakness
is the way in which power absorbed in the walls of the keyhole is
related to the radius of the keyhole when considered as part of the
solid/liquid phases of the problem, and by absorption and transmission
processes (inverse bremsstrahlung, Fresnel absorption, conduction, re-
radiation, etc.) when the vapor phase is considered.  There are two
aspects to this: the inadequacy of these solutions near to the keyhole and
the problem of determining the power absorbed from the laser beam by
keyhole processes.  Many different approaches have been adopted to
overcome these problems.
Analytical approaches involve the use of formulae for specific
absorption mechanisms; the Linking Intensity concept6, Fresnel

absorption,7 or alternatively empirical formulae can be employed to give
the power absorbed per unit depth.8  Whatever model is used for the
power of the point sources and the absorption characteristics of the line
sources, the result is a prediction for the temperature distribution in the
workpiece.  This can then be used as the basis for further calculation to
obtain such quantities as
• 
the thermal history of individual points in the workpiece;
• 
the metallurgical properties (which can be deduced from the
thermal histories);
• 
more accurate solutions for the temperature distribution, using the
point and line source solution as the first stage of an iterative
scheme, which might be analytical or, more usually, numerical;
• 
the consequences of varying the absorption models in order to test
their validity and reliability;
• 
the distribution of thermal stress in the workpiece;
• 
the deformation of the workpiece that results from thermal stress.
It is characteristic of point and line source models that the nail-head
is not as clearly defined as is often the case in practice.  This is very
clear when a comparison is made with the weld shown in Figure 6.2(b)
above.  Even the introduction of a variable line source model does not
entirely solve the problem; see Figure 6.7, which shows that the weld of
Figure 6.2(b) can be much more successfully represented.  The shapes
obtained are characteristically more like a wineglass than a nail-head,
and therefore do not describe weld 6.2(a) at all well.  Many reasons are
possible, among them being the likelihood that there is strong
convective motion in a large weld pool so that, in effect, power is being
absorbed throughout the weld pool rather than at an isolated point.  This
can therefore be modeled by a volume distribution of point sources
with, of course, the associated image system.
A related cause, at least in the case of the smaller nail-heads, is the
possibility that the coupling of the beam into the hole in the workpiece
is poor, so that a significant amount of power is absorbed over its upper
surface.  In that case a surface distribution of point sources could be
used.

In the same way, the fact that the keyhole is usually curved rather
than straight can be taken into account.  The method is to integrate point
sources with an appropriate source density along a curve in the interior
of the material,9 rather than along the straight line employed in the
variable line source models described above.  Again, an associated
image system is required.10

and the calculated profiles as solid lines.
The applications of the idea of point and line sources can range from
very simple models to a tool that can be used in the analysis, evaluation,
and prediction of extremely complex problems of great industrial
importance.11
The periodic point and line source solutions are given in Section 4.3
by Equations  (4.12) to (4.14).  The way in which the periodic time-
dependant point source can be used to construct solutions for periodic
surface heating, such as might occur in treatment with a pulsed laser, is
described there.  Clearly, the same mathematical strategy could be used
with the time-dependent line source solution.  Caution is needed since

problem by means of methods based on the use of an appropriate Green’s
function; see Morse and Feshbach, 1953.

the solution ignores the presence of a keyhole that may collapse and
then be redrilled if the interval between pulses is sufficiently long.  In
that case a careful evaluation of the relevance of the approach is needed
in any given application.
6.3  THE RELATION BETWEEN POWER ABSORBED AND
KEYHOLE RADIUS
6.3.1  The line source as a model of the keyhole
The line source has proved to be very useful as a simple model of the
temperature distribution in keyhole welding, but it has a number of
drawbacks.  For example, the temperature it predicts is above the
vaporizing value sufficiently close to the axis, but it makes no
allowance for that.  It is possible, however, to use it to find an estimate
of the keyhole radius.  Such an estimate can be found by requiring the
mean temperature on a circle of radius a to be the boiling temperature,
TB.  From Equation (3.21) it means we require that

Figure 6.8 gives a graph of a′  as a function of 1/τ  on a logarithmic

of 0.93.  Interestingly, over the range shown the relation is nearly linear;

this is not a coincidence since the values of a′  in the range are small
enough for asymptotic approximations to be used for the Bessel
functions.  The approximations that are useful in this instance are13

Approximations such as this are often useful, but it is important to
remember the circumstances under which they are valid.  Figure 6.8

shows both curves.  From there it can be seen that the approximate
relation is useful if τ is less than about 0.5 or a′  less than about 0.2.
For 
1
=
τ
, the error in using the approximate relation is already about
20%.
Relationships such as these have to be used with an understanding of
the context. Since they are a description of just a part of a much wider
set of interrelations, it can be difficult, or even meaningless, to
distinguish between cause and effect.  The keyhole size and absorbed
laser power are connected.  The beam diameter is one of the main
determining factors, but the relationship between it and the keyhole size
is not necessarily straightforward, except at the keyhole mouth where
(6.5) does not apply.
6.3.2  The Davis-Noller solution
One reason why the line source might be considered unsatisfactory
as a model for the keyhole boundary is as follows.  The high intensity of
the laser beam incident on the keyhole wall forces the wall to have a
radius that is closely connected to the beam radius.  If the keyhole
surface is taken to be the boiling isotherm, the line-source model could
be used more accurately if that isotherm is identified; that, however, is
not entirely a simple matter, as Figure 3.17 shows.
A similar but rather more sophisticated solution of the two-
dimensional equation of heat conduction exists that gets around that
particular problem at the expense of introducing some others.   The
basic requirement is that the temperature distribution

Here, r is the distance from the axis and θ is the angular coordinate in
polar coordinates as shown in Figure 6.9. All quantities are assumed
independent of the z coordinate.  T must satisfy the equation of heat
conduction.
To solve the problem, make the same substitution as in the
discussion of the point and line sources given by Equation (3.2).  Once
again, S must satisfy Equation (3.3).  This time, however, look for a
solution for S that depends on both of the cylindrical polar co-ordinates

The two estimates obtained from (6.5) and (6.10) are shown for
comparison in Figure 6.10, and it will be seen that there is little
difference for sufficiently small values of a′ .  The asymptotic relation
for small values of a′  is applicable to both.
6.3.3  Other two-dimensional thermal models for the solid and
liquid phases
The Davis-Noller solution tries to extend the line source idea to
cover the case of a circular isothermal keyhole of nonzero radius.  It
suffers, however, from one serious departure from reality.  The material
elements all move in a straight line, and all those within a distance equal
to the radius of the keyhole cross the boiling isotherm into the keyhole.
They then cross back on the downstream side of the keyhole.  While it is
true that some material is vaporized and then escapes axially along the
keyhole, it is not believed to recondense.  A far better approximation
would be to ignore the vaporization entirely and require the keyhole
boundary to be a streamline as well as an isotherm.
Various approaches have been tried.  For example, if the workpiece
is regarded as entirely liquid and that this liquid is in irrotational flow
around the keyhole, a solution has been found for the temperature
distribution.25  An alternative approach is to tackle the problem in the
case of very slow relative motion.   It is then possible to obtain an
approximate solution that identifies the boundary between the solid and
liquid phases and can test hypotheses about the importance of such

things as the latent heat of melting or the viscosity of the molten
phase.26
A different use of the Davis-Noller solution is to use it to describe
the temperature distribution in the solid phase when the solid/liquid
boundary is on an isothermal circular cylinder.

6.4  THE LIQUID/VAPOR INTERFACE
A subject that has been investigated fairly extensively by means of
simple models is the shape of the keyhole in deep-penetration welding.
The subject is, however, by no means closed, and it is worth looking
briefly at some of the individual considerations that have to be taken
into account.
Important questions to ask are, What forces keep the keyhole open?
How much energy is needed to do this?  A complete attempt to answer
such questions leads to a system of linked nonlinear partial differential
equations.  Order of magnitude calculations, however, suggest that the
keyhole is kept open against surface tension forces mainly by "ablation
pressure."  Suppose the components of velocity normal to the interface
and the density are u and ρ, with their values on the two sides
distinguished by subscripts L and V, respectively, as indicated in Figure
6.11.

Use has been made of Equation (6.12). By Newton’s Second Law
such a momentum deficit has to be balanced by appropriate forces.
There are two of these, provided by pressure and surface tension.  If the
keyhole has a radius a, viscous forces are ignored and the coefficient of
surface tension for the molten metal is γ, then the sum of the forces per
unit area at the boundary in the direction of the arrows in Figure 6.11 is

27 This, however, must be regarded as contentious.  It is possible to analyze the
pressure at the keyhole wall in a number of different ways.  Some approaches
suggest that the pressure in the keyhole may differ substantially from the
ambient pressure and the pressure in the liquid. See, for example, Kroos et al.,
1993a,b; Gillies, 2000.

Here, T is temperature with subscripts 0, M, and V indicating ambient

while TB is the boiling temperature. The accurate determination of the
vapor density 
V
ρ  theoretically or experimentally presents considerable
difficulties (see Section 7.3).  Order of magnitude calculations can be
made on this expression showing that, for typical beam sizes, the
amount of power needed to keep the keyhole open is a fairly small part
of the power absorbed.  For this reason it tends to be ignored in simple
models.
Something that is believed to have a profound effect on the shape of
the weld pool is the variation of surface tension with temperature,
resulting in what is known as the Marangoni effect or thermocapillary
action.  Once again, mathematically, this is a part of the boundary
conditions.  On the inside walls of the keyhole the temperature is at or
near the boiling temperature of the metal, but on the surface of the weld
pool away from direct incidence by the laser beam there can be a
surface tension gradient.  Its form is

28 and it is a
tangential surface force per unit area.  It has to be included in the
tangential component of the momentum balance condition in the same
way that the ordinary surface tension force has to be included in the
normal component of the momentum balance.
The transfer of energy from the laser beam to the workpiece takes
place through two main mechanisms.  The first is direct absorption at
the keyhole wall, often referred to as Fresnel absorption.  See Equation
(3.19).  The second is a more complicated process that begins with
inverse bremsstrahlung absorption in the ionized vapor.  This process

transfers energy from the laser to the plasma.  It is then transferred
through the plasma by a number of mechanisms, of which thermal
conduction, reradiation, and absorption are a few, to the keyhole walls.
It is there absorbed into the liquid phase of the workpiece, or else used
to ablate the material necessary to keep the keyhole open.
A formula widely used for the reflection coefficient  in Fresnel
absorption is given by Equation (3.19).  It applies to circularly polarized
light.  It is probably appropriate for wavelengths equal to and greater
than that of a CO2 laser, but it is questionable how appropriate it is for
shorter wavelengths.

6.5  THE KEYHOLE
The keyhole is by far the most controversial part of the system to
model effectively; a few of the considerations involved, however, are as
follows.
A partially ionized vapor exists in the keyhole.  The degree of
ionization depends on the pressure and temperature in the keyhole if
local thermodynamic equilibrium is assumed.  Reasonable assumptions
can be made about the pressure in the laser-generated keyhole so that,
for local thermodynamic equilibrium, the keyhole temperature can be
deduced. Before considering any nonequilibrium theories it is
reasonable to study the system on the assumption that local
thermodynamic equilibrium exists.  This can be done using the Saha29
equation that relates the number densities of the different species in the
plasma to its temperature.  The number densities are important since the
absorption coefficient for inverse bremsstrahlung30 depends strongly on
their values.
Saha’s equation and the absorption coefficient for inverse
bremsstrahlung, with graphs of their temperature dependence, are
discussed in more detail in Section 7.3.
A complication is that at an ablating boundary the distribution of
particles cannot be Maxwellian since it is necessarily one-sided, that is,
velocities can only be away from the liquid region, not into it.  As a
result, there is a very thin adjustment layer present, the Knudsen layer.31
For CO2 laser light,32 a substantial plasma is likely to occur in the
keyhole (though much less so for CO laser light), and for assumed local

thermodynamic equilibrium, the plasma formation for Nd:YAG laser
light should be negligible.  Experiment shows the presence of some
ionized vapor when a Nd:YAG laser33 is used, however.
Experimental measurements for keyhole plasma temperatures are
very difficult to obtain because of the presence of a plasma plume above
the keyhole; as a result, it is very difficult to access the keyhole directly.
Measurements by reliable experimental groups tend to range from about
5000 K to 18000 K, suggesting that the assumption of local thermo-
dynamic equilibrium in the keyhole plasma may be incorrect.  It may be
that a nonequilibrium rate process with other complicating effects is a
more appropriate description.
In spite of all these reservations, however, simple models can
provide useful information – it is just that it is as well to be aware that
there are reservations that need to be made.
The electromagnetic propagation problem that determines the
distribution of electromagnetic power in the keyhole poses some
difficulties.  The keyhole is often not many wavelengths in diameter,
suggesting that, in principle at least, Maxwell's equations should be
solved.  The geometry is nonuniform and there is an inhomogeneous
atmosphere, a problem that has not been successfully solved.  It is more
usual to treat the problem by the method of rays.  The technique has
been found to be useful34 but normally requires elaborate computational
procedures, as the rays are traveling in a variety of directions and are
reflected as well as absorbed at the keyhole walls, with absorption
taking place in the plasma.
A contribution to the absorption of the laser energy is that due to
inverse bremsstrahlung, for which accurate modeling is difficult for the
reasons given above.  In outline, the laser power is absorbed in the
partially ionized vapor in the laser-generated keyhole and transferred to
the walls of the keyhole by thermal conduction processes.  The laser
power is related to the average value across the keyhole, and the mean
intensity of radiation is averaged over all directions.  This, in turn, is
related to the energy absorbed in the plasma that acts as a source term in
the heat conduction equation in which the thermal conductivity of the
plasma is a function of temperature.  The heat conduction equation can

be solved to determine the temperature of the plasma in the keyhole.
The concept of a linking intensity  has been introduced35 and has been
found to be a useful though approximate concept.  Originally, it was
obtained in the case where the vapor in the keyhole is fully ionized, but
the general idea can be seen as follows. Suppose the power absorbed by
the workpiece per unit thickness by this mechanism is QB (W m−1) and
the laser power averaged at each cross-section of the keyhole is P (W).
Then suppose there is an intensity of available incident power 
(W m−2) at the keyhole wall that depends solely on these two quantities
for given materials.  Dimensional analysis then shows that
2
B
Q  =  P.
(6.18)
The value of  also depends on the wavelength in use.  As a
generalization, it will be shown in Section 7.3 that if a number of
reasonable assumptions are made, there is a relationship of the form

but does depend on the mean values of the pressure and the total power
at a given cross-section of the keyhole, as well as on numerous physical
constants, properties of the materials involved, and the operating
frequency of the laser.
As such, this relation, like Equation (6.17), constitutes a part of the
boundary conditions on the liquid region.  They cannot be considered in
isolation and need to be considered in the context of the energy balance
in the keyhole itself.
As an illustration of the way in which ideas such as these can be used
to construct a simple model of the keyhole, consider the following.  It is
possible to write down two simple energy balance equations in the
keyhole.  These are

Equation (6.19) expresses the condition that the decrease in power in
the keyhole P crossing a plane perpendicular to the axis at a given depth
z is due partly to the direct absorption at the keyhole wall by
mechanisms such as Fresnel absorption, and partly due to indirect
transfer by processes such as inverse bremsstrahlung and thermal
conduction in the plasma.  Formulae (6.17) and (6.18) might be used for
this purpose.  Equation (6.20) states that this power goes either into the
ablation of material from the keyhole wall QA or into the absorption of
thermal energy in the workpiece, QTh.  QA was discussed above and is
frequently neglected.  QTh has to be obtained from whatever solution is
used for the solution of the equations of heat conduction, etc., in the
liquid and solid regions. A simple way is to employ the line source
model, a procedure that is not strictly accurate unless conditions are
independent of z, but might be used as an approximation if they only
vary slowly.  If the approximation is accepted, then Q in Equation (3.21)
is the quantity QTh.  Assume that the keyhole wall is an isotherm, as will
be at least approximately the case if the boiling is not too vigorous; it
has already been noticed that this only needs to be sufficient for the
ablation pressure to keep the keyhole open against surface tension.  In
that case, the keyhole wall is given by setting the right-hand side of
(3.21) equal to TV with r = a and x = cos θ ; this, then, has to be solved
for a.  It will be seen that the result is not exactly a circular keyhole.  It
is, however, possible to use an estimated average value for a, and the
easiest way to obtain it is to average Equation (3.21) so that it is given

6.6  NUMERICAL EXAMPLES
Some simple calculations follow to illustrate the way in which the
line source solution can be used for simple estimates of such things as
the weld width.  For example, if the numerical values for the constants
of stainless steel given in Appendix 1 are used, Equation (3.21) can be
used to estimate the width of the weld.  Figure 6.15 shows the
geometrical relationship between the weld width and the melting
isotherm.  It should be noticed that the maximum width of the molten
region does not necessarily occur for the same value of x as the axis of
the laser.  At low translation speed the difference is not likely to be
great.  Figure 6.16 shows the numerical relationship in dimensionless
form.  Lengths are scaled with

So, for example, if a given keyhole weld absorbs 3 kW at a
welding speed of

the weld.  The value of τ is approximately 0.5.  The corresponding value
for w from the graph in Figure 6.16 is 0.35 in dimensionless units, or
equivalently 2.6 mm.  This width is roughly the same as that of the
lower part of the weld whose profile is shown in Figure 6.2b.  Note that
this is the width of the stem part of the weld, not the nail-head.

It is this relationship that is plotted in Figure 6.15.
If the speed of translation is sufficiently small for the approximation
given by (6.26) to be valid, the power absorbed per unit depth in the
stem of the weld can be found.  It is given in terms of the weld width W
where

when these approximations are valid.  The absence of Q from this is less
surprising than at first appears, since a in the stem itself depends on Q
and on all the absorption processes that occur higher up the keyhole.  It
can only be regarded as loosely related to the spot size of the laser.
Equation (6.6) could be used to express W in terms of Q instead, if
desired.  In that way, both the value of a and the approximate value of Q
could be inferred from measurements of the weld width in the stem of
the weld.  The value at the surface will be wider as a result of the nail-
head feature, and the theory would have to be extended to cover that
part of the weld.
If the relationship between surface tension pressure and the rate of
ablation given by Equation (6.15) is accepted, it is possible to estimate
the power needed per unit depth to keep the keyhole open from equation
(6.16).  If, for example, the keyhole diameter is taken to be 0.1 mm, so
that a is 0.05 mm, and the vapor density is taken to be

QA has a value of about 1 kW cm−1.  This amount then has to be added
to the other contributions to the total power needed for the welding
process.  It can be seen that although the figure is not big, it is not
altogether a negligible fraction of the power absorbed by the workpiece
in the form of heat.

CHAPTER 7
THE FLUID REGIONS IN KEYHOLE WELDING
______________________________
7.1 FLOW IN THE WELD POOL
The molten metal in the weld pool is usually in vigorous fluid
motion;  there are several reasons why.  One is that the molten metal has
to flow past the keyhole or other surface depression rather than through
it, as is implicitly assumed by the simpler models based on Equation
(3.1).  It is true that vaporization takes place on the keyhole wall, but
only sufficient vaporization is needed to maintain the shape of the
keyhole.  Most of the fluid flows around it, although the flow can have a
component parallel to the laser beam as well as perpendicular to it.
Another driving mechanism is the variation of surface tension with
temperature.  Mathematically, the surface tension condition generates a
boundary condition on the equations of fluid motion.  The fact that there
is a strong fluid motion means that the temperature distribution itself is
affected.  The fluid motion simply cannot be ignored in the way that it is
in the simple models discussed in Chapter 6.
It is usual to describe the velocity field u in the liquid region by
means of the equations of incompressible fluid dynamics, assuming that
the density and kinematic viscosity are constant.  These equations are

numerically.  Nonetheless, there are some general considerations
relating to boundary conditions on these equations that are important.
The following points have to be borne in mind and need mathematical
representation in a form appropriate to the given context.  At a boundary
between phases
(i) mass is conserved;
(ii) momentum is conserved in the absence of surface forces or
modified appropriately in their presence (consider, for example, the
effects of pressure or surface tension);
(iii) internal energy is conserved, making due allowance for latent
heat effects.
These considerations apply whether or not there is a transfer of matter
between the phases, although they tend to take much simpler forms
when there is not.
Although some of molten metal is vaporized at the surface of the
keyhole, most of it flows around.  In general, the motion is very
complicated, but some understanding of it can be obtained by studying
simple analytical models.  The most basic is to ignore the change of
phase and treat the whole motion as if it were that of an inviscid fluid of
constant density in irrotational motion, and to ignore vaporization at the

keyhole wall.  It is true that this is unsatisfactory on the level of detail,
but it gives a useful approximation that can be employed to gain insight
at a general level.
Assume that the fluid motion is independent of the z coordinate and
that it has no component of velocity parallel to the keyhole’s axis.
Assume also that the keyhole is a circular cylinder of radius a.  It is
useful to employ cylindrical polar coordinates, (

keyhole axis.  They are shown in Figure 7.1 in relation to the normal

notational simplicity.
There are a number of ways of representing a fluid flow graphically.
For example, one can plot the particle paths; these have to be obtained
by solving Equation (4.20), which is often not a simple matter. An
alternative is to construct the stream lines of the flow.  These are a
family of lines that are everywhere instantaneously parallel to the
velocity vector.  In steady flow, the stream lines and the particle paths
are the same, but the stream lines are frequently much easier to obtain
and tend to be preferred as a result.  In unsteady flow, though, the two

are not the same.  Yet another way of representing the flow is by means
of a vector plot in which vector line elements are drawn at the vertices
of a mesh of points in the flow domain.  Figure 7.2 is a vector plot of
the velocity for the particular problem under discussion.

required that no liquid should cross the surface, so the flow there has to
be tangential to it, and the stream lines are parallel to the velocity by
definition.
Consider now the particle paths.  Although these are the same as the
stream lines in steady flow, the stream lines can give no information
about the relative history of material elements.  That can only be found
by solving Equation (4.20).

Even for such a simple example as this, one is forced to solve the

Many analyses have been made of varying degrees of complexity.  It
is, for example, possible to analyze the problem at low Péclet numbers,3
where the keyhole and weld pool are both essentially circular in section,
but with the weld pool slightly displaced.  It is possible to include such
features as the latent heat of melting and investigate the level of
significance it has in determining the width of the weld.

7.2  INTERACTION OF MOTION IN THE WELD POOL WITH
THE KEYHOLE
It has been known for a long time4 that there are flows in the weld
pool parallel to the axis of the laser as well as perpendicular to it, and,
indeed, that the keyhole itself is in violent unsteady motion.  The flow is
illustrated schematically in Figure 7.6.

It cannot be said that the cause is well understood, and although there
have been theoretical investigations of it,5 it is often ignored in models
of keyhole welding.  This is in contrast to the position in models of
conventional welding techniques where it is usual to take proper
account of it.  Part of the problem is that it is not easy to identify the
prime cause.  There are almost certainly several different effects that
contribute, but one possibility is convection induced by variation in the
surface tension with temperature on the surface of the weld pool.  The
effect is known as thermocapillary flow or the Marangoni effect.  The
size of the effect can make a considerable difference in the

characteristics of conventional welds.6  Even the direction of the flow
can depend critically on whether the gradient of surface tension is
positive or negative, a difference that can be affected by surface-active
impurities such as sulfur. Experimental and theoretical evidence lends
support to the idea that differences in surface properties of melts
account for variable weld penetration in conventional welding
processes.7
The effects of thermocapillary flow have been investigated
theoretically,8 but the evidence that it is the main cause of flow parallel
to the laser beam remains inconclusive, and other causes can be
postulated.9  The matter is not of trivial importance and is directly
relevant to thermal modeling, since fluid convection in the weld pool
will affect the way in which heat is redistributed within it.  The width
and depth of the resulting weld are therefore affected.
In a careful analysis of the problem, Matsunawa9 listed four
mechanisms that are known to induce circulation in the weld pool in arc
welding, namely electromagnetic forces, buoyancy forces, surface
tension, and aerodynamic drag at the surface of the workpiece.  It
should be remembered that a keyhole is not a normal feature of arc
welding.  It is known that bead formation in laser welding can be greatly
influenced by an external magnetic field,10 but in general
electromagnetic effects are not important.  The other causes remain as
possibilities however.  Matsunawa’s list includes two other possibilities
that can occur in keyhole welding that are not normally applicable in arc
welding.  These are the existence of humps that form on the keyhole
wall11 so that metal flow may be induced by the recoil force of
evaporation, and liquid flow induced by the metallic vapor jet in the
keyhole.
This last mechanism is clearly plausible, but is no easier to quantify
than some of the others.  In order to illustrate the techniques of
theoretical investigation, a simple model will be constructed here, in the
course of which it will become apparent that flow parallel to the axis of

the laser is an essential consequence of the existence of the keyhole.
There is no attempt at detailed numerical agreement; the purpose of the
investigation is to identify underlying mechanisms, and qualitative
agreement is the most that can be hoped for.  Detailed numerical
comparisons would require quite elaborate numerical simulation using
the techniques of computational fluid dynamics.
The main problem in the construction of a model of something like
this is how much to simplify.  The keyhole and the molten region must
be included, and it seems likely that the presence of the boundary
represented by the solid part of the workpiece provides a constraint that
may influence the pattern of flow. A large melt pool may result in a less
tight circulation than a small one, making the effects of this flow less
obvious.  On the other hand, the thermal conditions that determine the
size of the weld pool are not central to the problem under investigation,
even though they are, in fact, consequences of the solution.  Similarly,
the thermal transfer mechanisms that determine the radius of the
keyhole are not central, only its radius, so these two features can be
regarded as given in advance.  It would make analytical investigation
easier if the two boundaries were regarded as concentric circular
cylinders.  The fact that they are not will accentuate the differences
between the region in front of the keyhole and the region behind, but
will not affect the qualitative features, so there is no obvious advantage
in the very considerable complication that would result from including
it.  Suppose, therefore, that the keyhole is on the boundary

The central feature is the keyhole, which has to be kept open
principally by the back-pressure of material ablating at its surface (see
figure 7.7).
It is clear that the conditions at the interface between the liquid
region and the vapor in the keyhole or the surrounding atmosphere at
the surface of the molten portion of the workpiece is crucial.  It is
therefore necessary to look more closely at the fluid dynamics interface
conditions discussed in Section 2.2.  Since it is known that the boundary
is not steady but is in vigorous motion, and is probably best described as
being turbulent, there is nothing to be lost and perhaps quite a lot to be
gained by considering the full time-dependent version of the conditions.

Essentially, Equation (7.9) relates the surface tension pressure, the term

(7.10)
Thus, there are two conditions on the tangential components of stress
and velocity given by (7.7) and (7.10).  These conditions hold whether
the flow is steady or unsteady.  For discussions of turbulent flow they
could, for example, be replaced by their averages, although it is then
necessary to remember that t and n are also fluctuating quantities, as
well as u and p .  They show quite clearly that there are three things
involved in the generation of tangential (and hence axial) flow in the
© 2001 by Chapman & Hall/CRC  

weld pool.  One is the no-slip condition (7.7), although this does not in
itself imply the existence of tangential motion.  Equation (7.10) shows
that existence of a surface tension gradient is a powerful generator of
tangential flow when taken in conjunction with viscous forces.  That,
however, does not necessarily lead to axial flow in the liquid region
adjacent to the keyhole, since the walls of the keyhole are likely to be at
or close to isothermal conditions.  In consequence, the surface tension
gradient is likely to be very small.  That leaves the tangential condition
in the very simple form

.
(7.11)
This condition (7.11) makes it clear that the primary driving force is
the transmission of tangential motion by the viscous forces in the two
regions, the keyhole and the weld pool.  To ignore viscous forces in the
keyhole, for example, would lead to a zero-tangential-stress condition.
That could be compatible with a zero-velocity condition at the keyhole
wall, which, in turn, would lead to no axial flow, contrary to the
experimental evidence.
A full solution of the problem involves the solution of linked fluid
dynamical problems in each of the liquid and vapor regions.  The two
are connected by the boundary conditions (7.7), (7.9), and (7.11) and are
beyond the scope of this book.  It is, however, worth a partial
investigation to see what the implications of the analysis might be, and
whether they could be compatible with the evidence.  It is much
simpler, therefore, to separate the problem into two part, and investigate
them separately, so far as that is possible.
Neither region is simple if it is true that the motions in them are
fundamentally turbulent, but if the intention is a qualitative
investigation, not a quantitative one, there are some simplifications
possible.  A simplifying assumption is to assume that the keyhole
penetrates right through the workpiece and that the mean geometry is
effectively cylindrical (see figure 7.8).
One is forced to the conclusion that the very existence of the keyhole
necessarily leads to axial motion in the weld pool that may be very

state of turbulent motion.

Experimental observations tend to confirm the supposition.  A fact
that is almost certainly related is that the keyhole is not a simple feature,
stationary relative to the laser beam, but a twisting, writhing object
whose position is strongly time-dependent.  The same observations
show, most remarkably and perhaps counter to initial expectations, that
material close to the keyhole boundary moves down and away from the
keyhole in blind keyholes.  The experiments also note differences
between behavior at the front and the rear of the weld pool, but this
model relies on symmetry for the purposes of simplification, and so
cannot be expected to imitate all such differences.  It is easy to see how
a tendency such as this, with flow in the weld pool towards the center of
the workpiece parallel to the laser beam, can lead to the formation of
pores.  The same experimentalists found that pores could be avoided if
the welding took place in a vacuum.  In that case, flow in the weld pool

parallel to the laser beam took place in the same direction as the ejected
vapor of the plume.
The magnitude of the fluid motion that can be induced by such
effects has significant consequences for thermal modeling, although
they are not easy to cope with, either analytically or computationally.
Nonetheless, it is important to be aware of the problem.  The reason is
that if the fluid velocities are high relative to the speed of welding, the
convection terms in the equation of heat conduction (2.6) result in
strong mixing of fluid elements of different temperatures.  If, in
addition, the fluid motion is turbulent, these mixing effects can be very
widely distributed throughout the molten region, amplifying the effect
of the thermal conductivity very considerably.  Exactly the same
argument applies to the viscosity of the fluid whose effect is also
increased, although the relation between the two different mechanisms
is not straightforward.
Because of the way that turbulence can amplify the effects of
conductivity and viscosity, and by analogy with the statistical dynamical
derivations of the equations of conduction and viscous fluid motion, a
simple way of taking account of turbulence is to introduce the concepts
of "eddy viscosity" and "eddy conductivity."  In the most basic form of
such approximations, the ordinary viscosity µ is replaced by a constant
eddy viscosity 
E
µ , and the thermal conductivity λ by a constant eddy
conductivity 
E
λ .  While it must be recognized that these are very simple
approximations, and that there are no simple rules for determining
appropriate values for them, they are approximations that can be used to
test qualitative hypotheses or produce qualitative models as guides prior
to more detailed numerical modeling.  An excellent example of the
latter procedure is provided by their use in early models of the Gulf
Stream.13
Introduce eddy viscosity and conductivity coefficients to describe the
mean effect of the complicated turbulent motions of the keyhole.
Assume that they are sufficiently large that the inertial terms in the
equations can be ignored in the region of molten metal.
To decouple the two regions, consider a simple description of the
liquid region in which the normal component of velocity at the keyhole

 is taken to be independent of z and directed radially inward.
This is an approximation to condition (7.9).
For the moment, ignore condition (7.7), which is part of the link
between the motion in the weld pool and the flow in the keyhole.
Condition (7.11), then, has two parts.  If t is in the azimuthal
direction, that is to say, in the direction of increasing θ, there is unlikely
to be a significant contribution in that direction from motion in the
keyhole.  The corresponding component

 of the rate of strain tensor
in the liquid region will then be effectively zero.  The axial component
however will not be zero, being given by (7.11) with t approximately zˆ
and n approximately rˆ .  Approximately at least, the stress from the
vapor in the keyhole may be expected to be an odd function about the
central plane

The first of these is from (7.9), while the second and third are

 as
occurs if the welding is performed in a vacuum.  The result depends on
the fact that material is changing from the liquid to the vapor phase.  In
the latter state it has a high axial velocity outward from the keyhole,
whereas in the liquid phase it has a much smaller velocity.
There are similarly three boundary conditions to be satisfied at the
solid/liquid interface at 
b
r =
; they are simply conditions on the
continuity of velocity at this boundary if the density of the two phases is
taken to be the same.  In connection with these and the first of the
conditions (7.12), it is clear that there is a problem to be faced if the
model is to remain simple.  There is a loss of mass from the keyhole so
that either the resolidified material does not fill the whole of the region

, or else there is deformation of the solid material reducing
the overall width of the workpiece – or, indeed, a combination of both.
In either case, the simplicity of the geometry is lost, leading to increased
difficulties in the solution of the problem.  These difficulties are not
central to the original purpose of the model, which was to look at
vigorous fluid motion in the axial direction in the keyhole.
Since the radial velocities given by (7.12) are at most comparable to

There are also surface conditions to be imposed at the top and
bottom of the melt pool.  In principle, there are both velocity and stress
conditions, and all of them together will determine the exact location of
the molten surface.  It is known in practice that it is at least
approximately level with the surface of the solid part of the workpiece.
Consequently, a reasonable approximation is to regard its location as
being known, i.e., at 
0

 at the surface and at

at the bottom.  In

The normal component of the stress condition could then be used to
estimate the deviation of the actual surface from the assumed flat
surface.
If the eddy viscosity is sufficiently high for the inertial terms to be
ignored, the equations satisfied are Stokes’ equations15 and the equation
of conservation of mass.  In cylindrical polar coordinates16 they are

that

inhomogeneities are in the boundary conditions (7.15), and are multiples
of either

 or

two parts, one of which depends on θ ; the other has no axial velocity
and is axisymmetric. Use the symmetries of the problem to seek a

The presence of the boundary represented by the interface between
the solid and liquid phases of the material of the workpiece provides an
important constraint on the possible motion of the fluid, especially
ahead of the laser.  To ignore it reduces the dramatic effect of the
circulation implied by (7.28).  It represents a downward flow near to the
keyhole with a return upward flow far away.  If the ratio of a to h is
small, the velocities near the keyhole wall are very high compared to the
return velocities.  The effect, however, is present but is smaller than it
would be when proper account is taken of the presence of the boundary

h

 is 0.1 and 
b

 small.  The
vectors are all normalized to the same length, and the arrows show the
direction of flow with the keyhole wall on the left.
For the purposes of comparison, Figure 7.10 shows a vector diagram
for that part of the flow in a plane perpendicular to the laser axis.  The
lengths of the vectors are normalized relative to the welding speed, and
the case shown corresponds to 
10
/
=
a
b
.  It will be seen that the motion
is almost rectilinear until quite close to the keyhole wall.  The velocity
vector is tangential to the wall but not actually zero except at the front
and rear stagnation points.
The complete motion in the weld pool is therefore a combination of
the motions shown in these two diagrams, and will depend strongly on
how close a particle gets to the keyhole wall.  In that region it may, in
general, be expected to be convected downward very rapidly and then
emerge to take part in a more gentle upward motion as it moves past and
away from the keyhole.
The full solution has now been obtained in principle for the flow in
the weld pool.  It consists of the sum of the velocities given by (7.13)
and  (7.18) with the component functions given by (7.22), and the sum
of terms of the form of (7.23) with the component functions given by
(7.27) and the individual constants given by, for example, (7.28).  It will
be noticed that if 
a
h
is not especially large, as might be the case in the
welding of thin sheets, but that 
a
b
 is fairly large, the solution given by
(7.28) falls off rapidly away from the keyhole wall compared to that
given by (7.20).  In consequence, (7.28) can still be used as an
approximation.   The resulting solution is thus given by

Since the particle paths are given by
(
)t
dt
d
,r
u
r =
,
all that is necessary to find typical particle paths is to solve the system
of equations for a given initial position for the particle.  Some typical
results are shown in Figure 7.11 on the assumption that 
0
τ  is positive.
The positions of the starting points are shown schematically in
Figure 7.12.  It will be noticed that, although they are quite close
together, the particle paths can be very different and remarkably
complicated for a model that is, in fact, entirely linear in the molten
region.  It seems scarcely surprising, therefore, that observed paths can
be very intricate indeed, and show such variety, when they are simply
portraying the complexities of turbulent motion.
The flows associated with these examples all have a velocity at the
keyhole wall that is toward the central plane.  Condition (7.7) implies
that there must be a region of reversed flow in the keyhole near the
walls as a result.  It is therefore natural to ask if this is in fact ever
possible. To investigate the possibility it is necessary to have some kind
of model for the flow in the keyhole.  This, too, is not simple; the
magnitude of the axial flow suggests that it is predominantly in the
© 2001 by Chapman & Hall/CRC  

direction of the axis and is very vigorous indeed.  It has already been
shown that the viscous component is important, at least so far as the
coupling with the molten region is concerned.  It is more likely,
however, that most of the bulk flow will be not unlike an inviscid
motion and that it will have a strongly nonlinear character. The
following model exploits the idea and also assumes that the
compressibility of the vapor is not a critical factor, so that qualitative
insights can be gained, but not quantitative agreement.

boundary.  Superscript or subscript V will be used to indicate the vapor

assumption that

u  is effectively constant since the keyhole radius
varies little with z,  this means that the radial velocity is independent of
position in the keyhole parallel to the laser axis.
There is no reason to suppose that velocities in the keyhole are small,
so that a nonlinear model is needed in it.  As already suggested, suppose
that the viscous terms are ignored, conditions are assumed to be steady,
the density is taken as constant, and the velocity is assumed to have

The two boundary conditions given by (7.34) are clearly not satisfied

is done, however, it is necessary to study the solutions of Equation

It is now possible to investigate the best possible choice of the
parameters A, B, and C to approximate the pressure condition (7.34) at
the two ends of the keyhole.  On the grounds of symmetry, take A = h so

radius of the plume at the exit.  Consequently, it is necessary to have

The remaining constant c, and hence C, has to be chosen to give the
best approximation possible to the pressure over the rest of the keyhole
outlet.  It turns out that there are important qualitative differences
depending on the criterion chosen, indicating that the nature of the
solution, and hence of the flow on the weld pool, can be quite sensitive
to ambient conditions.  It also has to be noticed that this choice may be
affected by implication in the satisfying of the interface conditions at the
keyhole wall when the full viscous version of the problem is studied.
Perhaps the most obvious choice is to minimize the mean square
deviation at each end across the keyhole, i.e., choose c to minimize

The
corresponding stream lines are shown in Figure 7.14.  The magnitude of
the reversed velocity is quite small compared to the exit velocity of the
plume, but is still relatively high, corresponding to fairly high tangential
velocities in the liquid region of the weld pool.  There are other minima
in the range 
1
>
C
 (not shown), and indeed for a given value of C there
may be many solutions. The case when 
1
<
C
 increases monotonically
with c to an asymptotic value of 1 and so does not provide a satisfactory
solution to the problem; in addition, these correspond to solutions in
which the axial velocity is predicted to be greatest at the keyhole wall.
This is the region where friction effects with the surrounding liquid
region might be expected to be greatest, so it is to be expected that the
axial velocity is a minimum there.  All those corresponding to 
π
2
1
≥
c
include regions of reversed axial flow in the keyhole.
The value of c1 found by the above argument is one such solution, so
it can be seen that reversed flow near the keyhole wall is indeed
possible.  Whether or not it occurs is likely to be strongly influenced by
external conditions.
The example just considered is lengthy, but it illustrates the way in
which a worthwhile model of a complicated set of interactions may be
built up from simpler components.  Such a model can then be used to
test ideas about mechanisms that are not properly understood, or to
illustrate the way in which alternative mechanisms from the accepted
ones can describe observed phenomena.  It is clear from the model that
the result is sensitive to extraneous circumstances.  The strength of the
flow predicted by the model, irrespective of the direction, shows that
fluid motion induced by the motion of the vapor in the keyhole must be
considered very seriously.  The situation is clearly complex and needs
detailed investigation.  Mathematical modeling in this instance does not
solve any problem, but it identifies features that require further
investigation.
This particular example is important to thermal modeling, although
that aspect has not been dwelt on at length.  The mechanism
investigated, one of several, drives strong liquid motion in the direction
parallel to the keyhole axis.  It results in strong mixing that manifests
itself in a way that is not unlike an increase in the conductivity of the
liquid metal.  The idea of an eddy viscosity was useful in the model, and
© 2001 by Chapman & Hall/CRC  

the same idea can be applied to the conductivity.  An increase in the
value of the conductivity, by the introduction of an eddy conductivity,
will increase theoretical estimates of the size of the weld pool.  In the
present example, the consequence is a larger value for b, the half-width
of the melt pool, than would be expected from the value of the
molecular conductivity.  As a result, it can be seen that the thermal and
fluid flow aspects of the problem are indeed linked.

numerically, as a rule.  The general considerations relating to boundary
and interface conditions on these equations referred to in Section 7.1 are
important, and it is advisable to read more advanced literature on fluid
dynamics in depth.19  At a boundary between phases, the important
points to remember in connection with the interface conditions are that,
firstly, mass is conserved, a condition that is easily overlooked,
fundamental as it is.  Secondly, momentum is conserved in the absence
of surface forces; it will have to be modified appropriately in the
presence of such features as pressure, surface tension, or viscous forces.
Thirdly, internal energy is conserved, making due allowance for latent
heat effects.  To these must be added appropriate extra conditions such
as the isothermal condition at a melting/freezing boundary or a
boiling/condensing one.  Some modification to these may be necessary,
depending on circumstances.  Lastly, there will be conditions on the
fluid motion such as the no-slip condition.
The location of the boundary is usually a part of the solution of the
problem, so more conditions are to be expected than would be the case
if the position of the interface were known in advance.

7.3.  LASER HEATING OF THE VAPOR IN THE KEYHOLE
Energy from the laser light not only vaporizes the material in the
keyhole wall, but it can also ionize the resulting vapor.  As a result, a
substantial interchange of energy is possible under some circumstances,
indirectly from the laser beam to the molten material of the workpiece,
and independently of the process of Fresnel absorption at the keyhole
wall.  Electrons are released and the vapor forms either a partially
ionized vapor or a fully ionized plasma.  The various volume elements
of the plasma (if they are chosen to be large enough relative to the
Debye length) tend to be electrically neutral overall.  In the presence of
electrons in the ionized vapor, laser light can be absorbed by a process
known as inverse bremsstrahlung.  Suppose that the absorption cross-
section of the free electrons in a plasma is σ  (m2 ), then the rate of
energy absorption per unit volume q (W m−3 ) is given by

the frequency of the laser and the temperature in the appropriate range.
Formulae are available for the classical and quantum mechanical
factors,22 and further information in some situations not covered by
these is also available.23  All these estimates suggest that a value of the
order of unity is a reasonable estimate here with only a weak
temperature dependence.

σ  does not show all the features of the
dependence of σ on temperature, since it also depends on the number
density of ions, ni, which is itself dependent on T.  From (7.38) it is clear
that the power absorbed by the vapor also depends on the number
density of electron, ne.  In any model of thermal processes in the vapor
that sets out to calculate the temperature, it is necessary to relate these to
the temperature.  Again, on the assumption of local thermodynamic
equilibrium, such a relation is given by Saha’s equation,24

An additional problem that has to be faced in any attempt to model
the temperature in the vapor is that the equation of heat conduction
requires a formula for its thermal conductivity, and this itself is strongly
temperature dependent.  For example, in a fully ionized gas the effective

.  The vapor in the
keyhole, however, is unlikely to be fully ionized, and indeed the degree
of ionization may be quite low.

The values of the constants and the detailed functional forms cannot
be regarded as accurate or reliable in the complicated situation
prevailing in the keyhole,28 so any calculations based on this equation
can only be regarded as a rough guide.  The temperature distribution on
the axis must be finite and a suitable condition must be satisfied at the
keyhole wall, 
1
=
′r
.  Since the wall is an ablating boundary, the
distribution of molecular velocities cannot be Maxwellian, with the
result that there is a thin layer, known as a Knudsen layer, present on the
boundary.  It should be taken into account in a full description.29  An
approximate boundary condition, however, is that the temperature of the
vaporizing metal should be at the boiling point, under atmospheric
pressure, of the metal of the workpiece.
                                                          
28 The situation is far more complicated than is suggested by the account given
here.  There are many other aspects to the keyhole processes and the
appropriate functional forms associated with them.  For a thorough discussion
of the problem see Gillies, 2000.

Equation (7.54) is a special case of a more general form that would
apply with the underlying assumptions of the model, even if the detailed
values of the numerical constants need to be modified. Even if it is
necessary to use different formulae for the conductivity of the vapor30
and for the absorption coefficient, it is possible to make some general
remarks.  These concern the relationship between the inverse
bremstrahlung contribution to the absorbed power in the workpiece, QB,
and the laser power.
Suppose that these functions depend solely on temperature and
operating pressure, and that the latter does not vary substantially across
the keyhole at any given depth.  Since

In other words, QB depends on the power at a given cross-section and
the (mean) pressure at that section, as well as the numerous parameters
of the materials involved and a substantial number of fundamental
constants.  It does not depend directly on the radius of the keyhole and,
hence, on the spot size or the welding speed.
An example is shown in Figure 7.19.  It corresponds to atmospheric
pressure in the keyhole and a power of 5 kW at the given cross-section.
The temperature at the keyhole wall is the boiling point of iron.  The
temperature on the axis necessary to maintain this state is 0.216
dimensionless units, corresponding to a temperature of 19600 K.  The
dimensionless value of the power at the wall is

corresponding to a power per unit depth of 3.9 kW cm−1
A remarkable feature of Equation (7.55) is that, for a given power,
there are three solutions if the power is sufficiently high.  One solution
is that in which the temperature is almost uniformly equal to the

ionization.  In some circumstances it might be more appropriate to use a
generalized formula that could incorporate high ionization effects as well.

temperature at the keyhole wall.  With the values used for the case of
iron, there is no other solution for a power P of less than about 0.82 kW.
For greater values there is an upper solution with temperatures rising
rapidly to the range 11-20 kK, and a middle branch with temperatures in
the range 7-11 kK.  In the first case the power absorbed, QB, rises with
the power, but in the second case it falls very slowly.  It is interesting
that experimental evidence is divided on the question of keyhole
temperatures.  It is a very difficult quantity to measure.  Most
measurements favor low values, around 5000K, but some workers have
observed higher values, up to 16-18 kK.  Most theoretical work has
tended to predict values in the highest range, and it is interesting that the
analysis provided here does not exclude either possibility.  A stability
analysis in which the time dependence of the conduction equation is
taken into account would, however, indicate which of these solutions
are stable, and therefore more likely to occur.  At low powers when no
other solution exists, the near-isothermal solution is undoubtedly stable,
so it is probable that the intermediate temperature-range solution is
unstable and the high temperature-range solution is stable.

It will be seen that this temperature is reached on the axis in the power
range under consideration.  It is known that the transition from one
formula to the other is extremely complicated.  However, if the
solutions are recalculated using the low ionization formula for
temperatures below 15 kK and the high ionization formula for
temperatures above it, the results are not very different.  Figures 7.19 to

where H is the Heaviside step function.  Only the upper branches of the
curves in Figures 7.20 and 7.21 are affected, and then only for values of
P greater than about 2 kW.  The maximum temperatures are slightly
lower by an amount that increases gradually to about 10% at 20 kW.
The value of QB is slightly less at the top of the range but slightly
greater between about 4 kW and 8 kW.  The differences cannot be
regarded as significant in view of all the uncertainty in the factors and
formulae used in constructing the equation.
The general result given by (7.56) is of interest in itself.  The specific
results depend on fairly substantial assumptions about the constants
appropriate to the specific materials involved.  In general, however, the
relationship has the properties that
• 
it depends on the properties of the constituents of the workpiece, the
shielding gas, or any surrounding atmosphere that might become
entrained in the keyhole;

• 
it depends on the pressure in the keyhole, which will normally be
close to the ambient pressure;33
• 
it depends on the frequency of the laser employed;
• 
it does not depend on axial convection in the keyhole, which is
assumed to be entirely dominated by radial conduction;34
• 
it does not depend on the radius of the keyhole or the welding
speed.
The form of F in (7.56), the linking intensity in its original form
given by (6.18) or its modified form given in (7.57), must all be
regarded as quantities that have to be determined empirically at present.
The procedure described here can provide values in principal.  There is,
however, a very complex mixture of materials and states of ionization in
any real keyhole.  Uncertainties in the correct numerical values to use
and in determining precisely which formulae are appropriate suggest
that any such formulae are best regarded as no more than indications of
orders of magnitude and general form.

CHAPTER 8
THERMOELASTIC PROBLEMS
______________________________
A very simple example can be used to show the way in which
changes in temperature can produce distortion as a result of changes in
volume.  The example that follows shows a number of ways in which
the linear theory of thermoelasticity can be used to investigate unusual
problems.
8.1  THERMAL EXPANSION
Consider the following very simple model for the melting of a solder
wire on a soldering iron.  The wire is fed steadily and continuously onto
the surface of the soldering iron, which melts it.  The molten metal
drains rapidly away.  If the wire is at temperature T0 far away and TM at
the soldering iron, and the speed at which the wire is fed to the iron is
U, then the temperature 
( )
x
T
 of the wire as it approaches the iron is
given by the equation of heat conduction.  In this case it has the very
simple form

U

(8.1)
where κ is the thermal diffusivity of the solder.  If conditions are steady,
figure 8.1 shows the basic configuration and the coordinate system.
Suppose the wire has a coefficient of linear expansion αL so that a
short length of wire, whose temperature is   at temperature T0, has a
length

 at temperature T.  Then, bearing in mind that

 where α is the volume coefficient of expansion,1 the relation
between the stress tensor, which describes the forces in the wire, and the
local displacement of elements at a given point relative to their positions
if the wire is unheated, is given by Equation (2.25).  In this instance the

In this example, it is more than likely that convective cooling of the

assuming a Newtonian cooling law in which the rate of removal of heat

Notice that the mathematical model allows any positive value for U,

melt the solder, whatever the rate of delivery.  It is therefore somewhat
different from typical problems of the kind in which an incident laser

By way of contrast, consider a second example in which it is
assumed that the wire is somehow confined so that it cannot expand
along its length.  The thermal conditions, however, are assumed to be

would still represent a force of about 103 N.  The calculation provides a
warning that the forces in a heated workpiece can be very substantial
and cannot necessarily be ignored.  In applications such as welding they
can present a problem, but in such processes as laser forming they can
be turned to advantage.  That is the case with the process described next,
in which the existence of such forces is all-important for the success of
the technique.
8.2  THE SCABBLING OF CONCRETE
A major problem in the decommissioning of nuclear power stations
is to remove the large concrete shields installed around the radioactive
portions of the plant.  A process known as scabbling is used.  The word
“scabble”3 is a stonemason’s term meaning to work without finishing so
that a block has the same appearance as stone does before it has left the
quarry.  By extension, it is now used to mean producing a rough surface
on a piece of worked stone or concrete, and in the present context is
used to describe the removal of the surface layer.  In the
decommissioning of a nuclear power plant4 all that is necessary is to
remove the radioactive surface layer.  This is an expensive and
potentially hazardous operation, but it only requires the removal of a
few centimeters of material.  Afterwards, the remaining bulk of the
                                                          
3 Or “scapple.”

material, a meter or more thick, can be removed by relatively
inexpensive traditional techniques.  At the time of writing, the technique
for removal of the surface layer is purely mechanical and involves bulky
and expensive machinery to be present in the radioactive area.   That,
itself, becomes radioactive, and its disposal then also becomes a
problem. It has been shown, however, that a laser can be used to
produce the same effect5 (see Figure 8.3 for an example).
Figure 8.3.  An example of the laser scabbling of concrete.
The virtue of a laser system is that the laser power can be generated
remotely and delivered to the operational area using relatively
inexpensive components in the immediate vicinity of the radioactive
material.  There is a much reduced problem of disposal of valuable
equipment that has become radioactive as a result.  The process has
been evaluated experimentally in the laboratory and it was found that it
is not wavelength dependent, both CO2 and Nd-YAG lasers proving
successful in the surface removal of concrete.  An alternative technique
based on the use of lasers, with application to both lasers and metals, is
to use higher intensities with the intention of ablating the surface
material.6 The removal regime is substantially different and results in

particles being melted in the process of removal and the neat cement
mix being ablated.  The scabbling technique uses a fairly low intensity
beam applied for a short time over a large area in the form of a laser
beam moving relative to the workpiece.  Material is removed as solid
flakes of concrete; these are ejected from the surface explosively.  If the
surface of the material becomes hot enough to melt, the efficiency of the
process is dramatically reduced, so there is a fundamental difference
between this technique and the ablation technique.  Experiments also
showed that if the workpiece were allowed to cool and the treatment
repeated, the process did not result in significantly more material being
removed.  For all these reasons it is important to understand the
mechanisms involved and to find what process parameters will optimize
the depth of removal.
Although the way in which the scabbling takes place is not entirely
certain, one way to proceed in understanding it is to propose a
mechanism and study its consequences theoretically.  If the results are
clearly at variance with experiment, then the mechanism must be
rejected.  Agreement with experimental results, initially qualitative and
hopefully at a later stage quantitative as well, does not necessarily prove
that the mechanism is correct, but at least lends credence to it and shows
that it is worth further consideration.  As an illustration of this approach,
consider the suggestion that the mechanism is based on the assumption
that the laser beam causes the surface layer of the concrete to expand as
it is heated.  Only a very thin layer is directly caused to expand by the
heating, but it results in large internal stresses in the concrete.  Not all
such stresses are compressive; very considerable tensile stresses can
occur in the region under the surface layer.  Concrete is relatively weak
to tensile stress in comparison with its very considerable ability to
withstand compressive stresses.  A consequence is that stresses can be
relieved by subsurface fracture, followed by ejection of the material
above the fracture.  An irregularly shaped crater is then left in the
surface of the workpiece.
To study the process theoretically, it is possible to construct a
mathematical model on a small number of physical principles.  First,
one can assume that the temperature distribution induced by the laser
beam incident on the surface of the concrete gives rise to thermally-
induced stresses.  Second, assume that the linear theory of elasticity can
be used to find the stress distribution in the block, from which it is
possible to deduce the regions of maximum tensile stress.  One can then
© 2001 by Chapman & Hall/CRC  

use an appropriate criterion for the onset of fracture to find the
circumstances under which fracture might occur.  From such
information, one can make estimates for the likely depth of scabbling.
It is important to be able to establish this depth, as it is known
experimentally that, in practice, only a single pass is possible, and that
the shape of the incident beam is critical.
The method described becomes particularly simple in connection
with laser scabbling of concrete, but the approach can be applied much
more generally.  For example, the stresses induced during surface heat-
treatment of metals can be studied in this way or, at a certain level of
approximation, their occurrence in welding problems.  In the case of the
scabbling of concrete, there is only a very thin thermal layer at the
surface, resulting in a simplification of the analysis.

In order to solve Equation (8.8) it is necessary to have the solution of
Equation (8.5) for the temperature.  Suppose that there is an incident
intensity distribution 
)

 on the plane surface at z = 0 of a semi-
infinite concrete block.  Some order of magnitude calculations are
helpful at this point.  The process can be modeled using a thin-layer
approach for the thermal surface layer.   In the layer, the vertical scale
for variation in χ  is the same as that for T; in that case the ratio of the
vertical to horizontal length scales is 
Pe
/
1
, where Pe is a Péclet
number based on the horizontal length scale.  With a typical value for U
of 10 cm s−1 and a horizontal length scale for the incident radiation of 5
cm, this ratio is of the order of 
2
10− or less.  It seems likely, therefore,
that the contribution from χ  at depth is relatively unimportant.  In that
case it is only necessary to find 
 at depth.  The fact that the vertical
length scale is so small in relation to the horizontal length scale means
that the approximation discussed in Section 3.2 can be used to calculate
the temperature distribution.  It is therefore possible to find the value at
the surface of the temperature and its derivatives.
The stress tensor 
}
{

 can then be found from its form (2.33) given
in terms of the displacements.  From Equation (8.8), bearing in mind the
surface conditions (8.9), it follows that, with typical operational values,
the stress components have magnitudes of the order of

In principle, these equations can be solved by taking the Fourier
transform in x and y of the surface intensity.  It is simpler, however, to
construct the appropriate point distribution for the displacement and so
find the solution for the displacements for a specific problem in terms of
a double convolution over the surface S.  The surface stress condition
(8.9) must be used in the process.  The detailed formulae for the point
© 2001 by Chapman & Hall/CRC  

functions, and the resulting convolutions giving the solution for any
given incident intensity, will be found in Appendix 2.
The same approach is equally useful in other contexts, such as the
study of stress distributions produced by heating a semi-infinite metal
workpiece.
8.3 TWO-DIMENSIONAL MODELS
Experimental experience has shown that a relatively broad scanning
beam or array of beams is far more effective than a smaller one.  An
incident region of perhaps a couple of centimeters from front to back
and several centimeters wide has proved to be effective.  Compare the
intensity profiles for the circular Gaussian beam shown in Figure 3.5
with the model distribution for an array given by Equation (3.12) and
shown in Figure 3.6.  It is clear that the wide beam leads to a region that
is correspondingly wide with little variation in temperature or intensity
across it.  By way of contrast, in the case of the Gaussian beam there is
substantial variation.  In effect, most of the region affected by the
induced thermal stresses is affected in a way that may be expected to be
largely independent of the lateral coordinate x2.  This leads to the
possibility of simplifying the model very considerably by using a two-
dimensional approximation in which the stresses and strains are
regarded as independent of the x2 component.  The simplification is
considerable, all the more so in that it is possible to work in a very
simple manner directly in terms of the stresses without needing to solve
for the displacements.  Their values, in this problem at least, are largely
irrelevant.
There are in fact a couple of two-dimensional approximations
available in the linear theory of elasticity: the plane stress model and the
plane strain model.   They are appropriate to different circumstances and
it is necessary to decide which is the more appropriate one for use in
any given case.  They both apply in the case of a steady problem in
which three conditions apply.  The first is that the components of the
stress and strain tensors and the temperature have no dependence on the
x2 coordinates, the second is that 
0

, and the third is that the
body forces are derivable from a potential so that 
Ω

also has no dependence on x2.  In problems considered here, however,
there is no separate body force F.
The two approximations are
• 
Plane strain in which the assumption is made that 
0
22 ≡
e
.
• 
Plane stress in which it is required that 
0
22 ≡
p
.
In the situation considered here, the surrounding concrete is
constraining the heated region so that it is difficult for displacements to
take place transversely relative to the direction of the scanning beam.
Consequently, e22 may be expected to be zero, but not p22 since it is this
component of stress that prevents lateral displacement.  The plane strain
model is therefore the one that is appropriate here.10
The plane strain approximation makes it possible to solve directly for
the stress components in terms of the Airy stress function, χ. In the
absence of any body forces, it follows from (2.41) that χ has the

The stress tensor {
}

=1 3  at any depth can now be found from the
equation.  Regard its components as the components of a matrix P.  In
order to study what happens it is necessary to note that concrete is very
strong indeed to compressive stress but relatively weak to tensile stress.
To identify these regions, consider the tractions on a unit disk in the
material perpendicular to the direction of a unit vector n as its
orientation is allowed to vary.  The direction of n in which this has the
largest value is the direction of maximum stress, measured positive
when it is tensile and negative when it is compressive.  The method of
Lagrange multipliers shows very simply11 that n is the eigenvector of P
corresponding to the largest eigenvalue p which, for the stress to be
tensile, must be positive, i.e., 
n

From analysis of this kind, it is possible to predict the orders of
magnitude of the surface temperatures and the internal stresses in the
concrete. For concrete with limestone aggregate the tensile strength is of
the order of

.  The glazing temperature is about 1300°C , so
the intensity must be low enough, or the speed high enough, not to cause
glazing.  On the other hand, the intensity must be high enough, or the
speed low enough, for a sufficiently high tensile stress to develop in the
interior of the workpiece.  These limits provide constraints on the
operating parameters.  The model predicts surface temperatures of about
400-800 K above ambient and internal stresses of the order of 107 N
m−2.  It is thus consistent with experiments, and that suggests scabbling
can occur without glazing under these conditions.  It is more difficult to
predict the regions in which fracture might occur.  It is, however,
possible to obtain exact analytical solutions of Equation (8.13) for

quasi-Gaussian. Its form and the resulting stress distribution are very
similar in qualitative terms to the Gaussian case, but the solution is very

numerically.  Such an example, even if unrealistic at first sight, can be
very useful in gaining experience, as it is much easier and quicker to
investigate it.

Differentiation of (8.10) makes it possible to find the stress
components in their dimensionless forms.  Numerical investigation
shows in all three cases that there can be regions of tensile stress.

Figure 8.6.  Contours of the maximum tensile stress for the top hat case.
Contours are at intervals of 0.1 units and the line segments are
perpendicular to the direction of the maximum tensile stress.
Figures 8.6 to 8.8 show, respectively, contours of the greatest tensile
stress for each of these; the contours are at intervals of 0.1 units.
Superimposed are line segments indicating the plane perpendicular to
the direction of greatest tensile stress.  These directions are
perpendicular to the eigenvectors of the stress tensor.  The absence of a
line segment at the left-hand end of 8.6 and 8.7 indicates that the stress
at that point is entirely compressive.  These line segments correspond to
planes of likely local fracture.  The actual direction of fracture is
difficult to determine as it will also be guided by the strength of the
tractions.  When the line of high tension coincides with the possible
local plane of fracture, it is probable that the actual direction of fracture
will follow this line.  If they are roughly in the same direction as the
regions of maximum tensile stress, it is plausible to suppose that
fracture will be relatively smooth.  If their directions are considerably at
variance with each other, fracture may well be more jagged.
Comparison of the contour diagrams reveals a number of things.
The first feature to notice is that the maximum tensile stress is
immediately under the surface thermal layer (and thus at the top of the
contour maps), and that it occurs immediately under the region of
maximum decrease of intensity.

Figure 8.7.  Contours of the maximum tensile stress for the Gaussian
case.  Contours are at intervals of 0.1 units and the line segments are
perpendicular to the direction of the maximum tensile stress.
It is clear that
(i) the maximum tensile stress is greater, the greater the gradient of I
at this point;
(ii) the scale for variation of stress with depth is the same as the
horizontal scale, which is two dimensionless units in these three cases.
In order to achieve a high maximum stress, it is necessary to have a
sharp rear edge to the beam.  To achieve substantial penetration the
horizontal length scale of the beam must be comparable to the depth of
material required to be removed.  So, for example, to remove material to
a depth of 2 cm, a beam of width at least 2 cm in the direction of
translation is needed.  It is not entirely clear how the beam width should
be defined for the purpose.  The contours suggest that perhaps it should
be the distance between the greatest rate of increase of intensity and the
greatest rate of decrease of intensity.  Further investigation of the
solutions incidentally shows that the former point corresponds to the
region of greatest compressive stress.

Figure 8.8.  Contours of the maximum tensile stress for the quasi-
Guassian case.  Contours are at intervals of 0.1 units and the line
segments are perpendicular to the direction of the maximum tensile
stress.
In all three cases the line segments indicating the direction of the line
of maximum tension are inclined downward under the irradiated region,
rather than under the region that has already completely passed the
beam.  Perhaps this indicates a tendency for a fracture to break forward
from the point at which the tensile stress first reaches its fracture value,
removing the surface layer under the beam itself.  It is not clear how far
this will travel before breaking back to the surface, as the tensile stress
decreases quite rapidly in this direction.  A more detailed analysis of
this aspect of the problem needs a study of fracture mechanics, but it is
clear that the general direction tends to be downward.
The diagrams make it clear that the width of the beam determines the
depth of penetration, and so it is important to have a broad beam rather
than a tightly focused one.  The fact that the line segments on the
leading edge and bottom of a fracture are not horizontal suggests that
the bottom of the region of removed material may have been subject to
substantial tensions.  These would be caused by cracks that had a
tendency to continue downward but were prevented by global
considerations.  Perhaps this is an explanation for the appearance of
micro-cracks in the bottom of the removed region.  A possible
speculation is that the crack is more likely to return to the surface

reasonably well ahead of the incident beam, in a region where the
compressive stresses are still relatively low.  If that is so, it would also
appear preferable to keep the intensity as low as possible.  Although the
fracturing value of the tensile stresses is reached, it happens relatively
near the trailing edge of the incident beam.
In practice, the beam will have a finite width, and it is reasonably
clear that the wider this is, the better it will achieve as much removal as
possible in a single pass.  A question that arises very naturally concerns
the role played by the water content of the concrete.  A model such as
this can give some rough indications.  Experiments show that if the
concrete is heated to remove the water content, scabbling does not
occur.  Perhaps this is because the coefficient of expansion is reduced.13
It has also been shown that a concrete with a higher coefficient of
expansion is less resilient to temperature changes.  Such a difference
results in lower stresses in the interior of the material.  It is an idea that
can be examined with the help of a model of this kind.  Equation (8.11)
shows that the stresses in the concrete are directly proportional to the
coefficient of expansion, so halving it halves all the stresses.  If this
brings them below the critical stress, then no damage occurs.  Similarly,
if either the incident intensity is doubled (with the beam profile
unchanged) or the scanning speed is halved, then scabbling should
occur, all other things being equal.  It is, however, important that the
surface should not reach glazing temperature.
The effect of treating the concrete for tests such as these may
introduce greater complications, with other parameters of the material
being affected.  The model still provides an indication of what might
occur if the changes could be properly quantified.  Clearly, the specific
values of the properties of the concrete become critical in determining
the optimum values of such things as the incident intensity and scanning
speed.  A mathematical model such as this one allows a means by which
such effects can be studied.
8.4  STRESSES IN A METAL WORKPIECE
The underlying theory for the stresses in a semi-infinite metal work-
piece is exactly the same as for the problem of the scabbling of concrete
studied in the last section.14  The only difference is that it is no longer

true that the thermal layer is thin compared to the region affected by the
induced stresses.  The solution for ξ can nevertheless be separated into
two parts.  One part is directly expressed in terms of the temperature
distribution, 
χ
∇
 in the notation of Appendix 2.  The other part satisfies
the equations of the theory of linear elasticity without the thermal term,
but must satisfy a boundary condition derived from χ.15 
                                                          
15 In the two-dimensional solution in Section 8.2, the corresponding quantities
are χ1 and χ2 , respectively, for the two parts of the solution.
8.5 CONCLUSION
The example of the scabbling of concrete, studied at length in this
final chapter, shows particularly clearly the way in which the act of
trying to construct a mathematical model of a process can help to clarify
perceptions of what is involved.  Thus, it may provide a guide as to
what is important and what, perhaps, is not.  Finally, it poses questions
about the process itself, and in doing so can suggest new directions for
investigation which may, in turn, lead to yet more new insights into the
problem.

VALUES OF MATERIAL PROPERTIES
______________________________
Some typical values of the properties of a number of materials are
included.  They are intended as no more than a guide, and any reader
who wishes for good numerical agreement between a model and
experiment should try to obtain the best values possible for the
particular material under study.  Orders of magnitude, however,
especially of dimensionless parameters such as the Péclet number, are
frequently invaluable guides to the nature of the approximations that are
appropriate in the construction of an analytical model.  Sources include
Lide and Frederikse (1997), Neville (1995), and Smithells (1962).

differentiation with respect to the corresponding component of the co-
ordinate vector.
Because of the thin layer approximation that is appropriate in this
problem, the right-hand side of the z-component of the boundary
condition can be taken as zero.  Consequently, from (A2) the

, the incident intensity distribution.
Unlike the general thermoelastic problem, it will be seen that it is not
necessary to find the temperature distribution in order to solve Equation
(A3).
The solution of the equations of the linear theory of elasticity can be
expressed in terms of point solutions when the normal stress is specified
at the surface 
0
=
z
 of a semi-infinite domain 
0
≥
z
 if it is assumed that
all stresses tend to zero at infinity; it first obtained by Boussinesq.1  The
appropriate point source solution is required to have a delta-function
behavior for the normal stress at the surface (at a point that is most
conveniently chosen to be the origin), and to tend to zero far from the
boundary.  It can be obtained without undue difficulty by the following
method.  Construct the Fourier transform in x and y of the problem to be
solved.  This results in a set of coupled ordinary differential equations.
They can, in principle, be solved by hand, but are more conveniently
solved using a computer algebra package such as Maple®2.  When the

boundary conditions at the surface and at infinity have been imposed,
the terms can be regrouped into relatively simple forms.  The inverse
Fourier transforms of some of the terms are readily identifiable, and the
remainder can be inferred from these.  This procedure lacks rigor, but
having obtained the solution it is easily verified (using a computer
algebra package for preference) that they do indeed satisfy the equation.
The delta function behavior can be checked by direct analytical means
backed by the use of a package to obtain the stress components from the
displacements.  An alternative approach is that described by Landau and
Lifshitz.
The stress distribution is then given in
