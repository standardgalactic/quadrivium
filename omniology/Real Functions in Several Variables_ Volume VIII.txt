Real Functions in Several Variables: Volume 
VIII Line Integrals and Surface Integrals
1157 
Preface
Preface
The topic of this series of books on “Real Functions in Several Variables” is very important in the
description in e.g. Mechanics of the real 3-dimensional world that we live in. Therefore, we start from
the very beginning, modelling this world by using the coordinates of R3 to describe e.g. a motion in
space. There is, however, absolutely no reason to restrict ourselves to R3 alone. Some motions may
be rectilinear, so only R is needed to describe their movements on a line segment. This opens up for
also dealing with R2, when we consider plane motions. In more elaborate problems we need higher
dimensional spaces. This may be the case in Probability Theory and Statistics. Therefore, we shall in
general use Rn as our abstract model, and then restrict ourselves in examples mainly to R2 and R3.
For rectilinear motions the familiar rectangular coordinate system is the most convenient one to apply.
However, as known from e.g. Mechanics, circular motions are also very important in the applications
in engineering. It becomes natural alternatively to apply in R2 the so-called polar coordinates in the
plane. They are convenient to describe a circle, where the rectangular coordinates usually give some
nasty square roots, which are diﬃcult to handle in practice.
Rectangular coordinates and polar coordinates are designed to model each their problems.
They
supplement each other, so diﬃcult computations in one of these coordinate systems may be easy, and
even trivial, in the other one. It is therefore important always in advance carefully to analyze the
geometry of e.g. a domain, so we ask the question: Is this domain best described in rectangular or in
polar coordinates?
Sometimes one may split a problem into two subproblems, where we apply rectangular coordinates in
one of them and polar coordinates in the other one.
It should be mentioned that in real life (though not in these books) one cannot always split a problem
into two subproblems as above.
Then one is really in trouble, and more advanced mathematical
methods should be applied instead. This is, however, outside the scope of the present series of books.
The idea of polar coordinates can be extended in two ways to R3. Either to semi-polar or cylindric
coordinates, which are designed to describe a cylinder, or to spherical coordinates, which are excellent
for describing spheres, where rectangular coordinates usually are doomed to fail. We use them already
in daily life, when we specify a place on Earth by its longitude and latitude! It would be very awkward
in this case to use rectangular coordinates instead, even if it is possible.
Concerning the contents, we begin this investigation by modelling point sets in an n-dimensional
Euclidean space En by Rn.
There is a subtle diﬀerence between En and Rn, although we often
identify these two spaces. In En we use geometrical methods without a coordinate system, so the
objects are independent of such a choice. In the coordinate space Rn we can use ordinary calculus,
which in principle is not possible in En. In order to stress this point, we call En the “abstract space”
(in the sense of calculus; not in the sense of geometry) as a warning to the reader. Also, whenever
necessary, we use the colour black in the “abstract space”, in order to stress that this expression is
theoretical, while variables given in a chosen coordinate system and their related concepts are given
the colours blue, red and green.
We also include the most basic of what mathematicians call Topology, which will be necessary in the
following. We describe what we need by a function.
Then we proceed with limits and continuity of functions and deﬁne continuous curves and surfaces,
with parameters from subsets of R and R2, resp..

Preface
Continue with (partial) diﬀerentiable functions, curves and surfaces, the chain rule and Taylor’s for-
mula for functions in several variables.
We deal with maxima and minima and extrema of functions in several variables over a domain in Rn.
This is a very important subject, so there are given many worked examples to illustrate the theory.
Then we turn to the problems of integration, where we specify four diﬀerent types with increasing
complexity, plane integral, space integral, curve (or line) integral and surface integral.
Finally, we consider vector analysis, where we deal with vector ﬁelds, Gauß’s theorem and Stokes’s
theorem. All these subjects are very important in theoretical Physics.
The structure of this series of books is that each subject is usually (but not always) described by three
successive chapters. In the ﬁrst chapter a brief theoretical theory is given. The next chapter gives
some practical guidelines of how to solve problems connected with the subject under consideration.
Finally, some worked out examples are given, in many cases in several variants, because the standard
solution method is seldom the only way, and it may even be clumsy compared with other possibilities.
I have as far as possible structured the examples according to the following scheme:
A Awareness, i.e. a short description of what is the problem.
D Decision, i.e. a reﬂection over what should be done with the problem.
I Implementation, i.e. where all the calculations are made.
C Control, i.e. a test of the result.
This is an ideal form of a general procedure of solution. It can be used in any situation and it is not
linked to Mathematics alone. I learned it many years ago in the Theory of Telecommunication in a
situation which did not contain Mathematics at all. The student is recommended to use it also in
other disciplines.
From high school one is used to immediately to proceed to I. Implementation. However, examples
and problems at university level, let alone situations in real life, are often so complicated that it in
general will be a good investment also to spend some time on the ﬁrst two points above in order to
be absolutely certain of what to do in a particular case. Note that the ﬁrst three points, ADI, can
always be executed.
This is unfortunately not the case with C Control, because it from now on may be diﬃcult, if possible,
to check one’s solution. It is only an extra securing whenever it is possible, but we cannot include it
always in our solution form above.
I shall on purpose not use the logical signs. These should in general be avoided in Calculus as a
shorthand, because they are often (too often, I would say) misused. Instead of ∧I shall either write
“and”, or a comma, and instead of ∨I shall write “or”. The arrows ⇒and ⇔are in particular
misunderstood by the students, so they should be totally avoided. They are not telegram short hands,
and from a logical point of view they usually do not make sense at all! Instead, write in a plain
language what you mean or want to do. This is diﬃcult in the beginning, but after some practice it
becomes routine, and it will give more precise information.
When we deal with multiple integrals, one of the possible pedagogical ways of solving problems has
been to colour variables, integrals and upper and lower bounds in blue, red and green, so the reader
by the colour code can see in each integral what is the variable, and what are the parameters, which

do not enter the integration under consideration. We shall of course build up a hierarchy of these
colours, so the order of integration will always be deﬁned. As already mentioned above we reserve
the colour black for the theoretical expressions, where we cannot use ordinary calculus, because the
symbols are only shorthand for a concept.
The author has been very grateful to his old friend and colleague, the late Per Wennerberg Karlsson,
for many discussions of how to present these diﬃcult topics on real functions in several variables, and
for his permission to use his textbook as a template of this present series. Nevertheless, the author
has felt it necessary to make quite a few changes compared with the old textbook, because we did not
always agree, and some of the topics could also be explained in another way, and then of course the
results of our discussions have here been put in writing for the ﬁrst time.
The author also adds some calculations in MAPLE, which interact nicely with the theoretic text.
Note, however, that when one applies MAPLE, one is forced ﬁrst to make a geometrical analysis of
the domain of integration, i.e. apply some of the techniques developed in the present books.
The theory and methods of these volumes on “Real Functions in Several Variables” are applied
constantly in higher Mathematics, Mechanics and Engineering Sciences. It is of paramount importance
for the calculations in Probability Theory, where one constantly integrate over some point set in space.
It is my hope that this text, these guidelines and these examples, of which many are treated in more
ways to show that the solutions procedures are not unique, may be of some inspiration for the students
who have just started their studies at the universities.
Finally, even if I have tried to write as careful as possible, I doubt that all errors have been removed.
I hope that the reader will forgive me the unavoidable errors.

Introduction to volume VIII,
The line integral and the surface integral
Introduction to volume VIII,
The line integral and the surface integral
This is the eighth volume in the series of books on Real Functions in Several Variables.
We investigate in Chapter 26 the line integrals in space, i.e. there is given a curve K in space and
a continuous function f : K →R. For mathematical reasons we assume that f is continuous on a
slightly larger closed and bounded set A, which contains K. Then we deﬁne the line integral

K
f ds,
and set up some theorems and procedures of how to calculate the actual value of this symbol. We
can visualize this by attaching to each point of the curve the value of f at this point as a density,
and then we stretch out the curve and lie it down following the x-axis in the plane. This gives us a
function ˜f : B →R, where B ⊂RR, which can be integrated in the well-known way. The price of
this straightening out the curve is – not surprisingly – a weight function, which is added as a factor to
the integrand. This weight function is speciﬁed by the curve. It usually contains a square root, which
means that applications of mathematical programs like MAPLE and MATHEMATICA may be more
diﬃcult, and one should use special packages. Since the examples have been designed as simple as
possible, such that one can calculate everything by hand, we have not put much labour into MAPLE
in this volume. One always ﬁrst has to perform a geometrical analysis, before one can set up the
integral, and before one can apply MAPLE, and then it does not make sense to emphasize the use of
MAPLE, because it is not in focus here.
In Chapter 27 we go a step further, by replacing the line above by a surface F in R3. If f is a
continuous function deﬁned on F (or on a slightly larger set), then we introduce the surface integral

F
f dS,
and analyze the area element dS in order to obtain a reduction formula to e.g. a double integral in
the parameter domain E ⊂R2. Again the prize for this straightening out the surface to a subset of
the plane is the introduction of a weight function as a factor. Given describing parameters (u, v) of
the surface these deﬁne two systems of parameter curves, by which we construct a ﬁeld of normal
vectors to the surface. The weight function at a point is then the length of the corresponding normal
vector. Since the length in R3 always involves a square root, we are in the same situation as above
for the line integral. Programs like MAPLE do not like these problems, unless we use some special
extra packages. In order not to focus too much on MAPLE problems we shall only occasionally apply
MAPLE.

The line integral
26.1
Introduction
The idea of replacing an abstract integral over a set by an ordinary rectangular integration over some
parameter space at the cost of adding a weight function as a factor to the integrand can also be applied
in other situations.
We start with the 1-dimensional case, i.e. consider a C1-curve K in the general space Rm. We shall
in this Chapter 26 explain the line integral, notated by

C
f(x) ds.
We shall ﬁnd the weight function in the chosen parameter domain, when the type of coordinate system
has been chosen.
This idea is then extended in Chapter 27 to surfaces in two dimensions, i.e. we want to deﬁne the
abstract surface integral

F
f(x) dS,
where S is some 2-dimensional C1-surface, typically in R3, but higher dimensional spaces Rm are not
excluded. We ﬁnd in the chosen parameters (u, v) used in the description of the surface the relevant
weight function, which is used in the reduction theorem.
More general, we consider in Chapter 28 the problem of how to change variables in the previously
considered plane and space integrals. The structure is the same as above. We ﬁrst ﬁnd the relevant
weight function and then integrate in the new variables.
Finally, we add for completeness Chapter 29 on improper integrals, where the domain is either not
bounded or closed.
26.2
Reduction theorem of fhe line integral
Let C be a C1-curve of parametric description
C :
{x ∈Rm | x = r(t), t ∈[a, b]} ,
r ∈C1.
Any m ∈N is possible here, but we shall mostly only consider m = 2 (plane curves) and m = 3 (space
curves).
Then (cf. Figure 26.1)
r(t + ∆t) −r(t) ≈r′(t)∆t,
which is a small vector. The corresponding inﬁnitesimal length (the line element) at the point x = r(t)
must therefore have the structure
ds = r′(t) dt.
It should not come as a surprise that this can indeed be proved (we shall of course skip the proof
here), so we can formulate the following

The line integral
One can visualize the process above as if we are straightening out the curve C to a straight line,
represented by the interval [a, b] and the additional weight function r′(t). The latter has the same
structure as if we were changing variables in R, only this is not taking place between two line segments,
but between a curve and a line segment. If we use the curve length as a parameter, then the picture
becomes even more clear. Form the curve by some wire and then stretch it out, before it is laid down
on the x-axis, and let the function values follow this stretching. Clearly, we must therefore introduce
the curve length, so we put f(x) ≡1 above to get
Theorem 26.2 The length of a curve.
Let C be a piecewise C1-curve of parametric description
r : [a, b] →Rm, where r is injective almost everywhere. Then the length of C is given by
ℓ(C) =
 b
a
r′(t) dt.
Of special importance are the plane curves, where m = 2, so for later reference we here include an
overview of the line elements, when the parametric description is given by either a function (i.e. graph)
in rectangular coordinates (x, y), or a function (i.e. a graph) in polar coordinates (̺, ϕ) in the plane.
1) Rectangular coordinates. The curve is given as the graph of the function
y = Y (x),
x ∈[a, b],
Y ∈C1.
Then the line element is
ds =

2) Polar coordinates, ﬁrst version. The curve is in polar coordinates given as the graph of the
equation
̺ = P(ϕ),
ϕ ∈[α, β],
P ∈C1.
The line element is given by
ds =

{P(ϕ)}2 + {P ′(ϕ)}2 dϕ.

equation

26.2.1
Natural parametric description
Let C be a curve as above wiith the parametric description x = r/t), r ∈C1. Choose some ﬁxed
t0 ∈[a, b], and deﬁne
S(t) :=
 t
t0
r′(τ) dτ
for t ∈[a, b].
Then the signed length of the curve C measured from r (t0) is deﬁned as the function
s = S(t),
t ∈[a, b],
where S′(t) = r′(t) .
If r′(t) > 0 for all t ∈[a, b], then the function S(t) has an inverse function, so there exists a (unique)
function T , such that
s = S(t),
if and only if
t = T (s),
Then by insertion,
x = r(t) = r(T (s)) := rN(s),
i.e. rN := r ◦T.
We call x = rN(s) the natural parametric description of the curve C, and the curve length s iis called
the natural parameter of the curve. In spite of its name, one shall in practice not use the natural
parameter, because the expressions in general become more complicated than in other descriptions.
It is mentioned here for historical reasons, and anyway, the geometric interpretation of the natural
parametric description is very nice.

Remark 26.1 We see that the square root is quite natural here. Since even programmable pocket
calculators are not too happy with square roots, they will usually stop, when they are not given some
help from the user. Therefore, we cannot expect to get any ﬁnal result by applying pocket calculators
to problems of this type. Note in particular that

g(t)2 = |g(t)|.
(In other words: Remember the numerical signs!) ♦

A. Let a, h > 0. Consider the helix
r(t) = (x, y, z) = (a cos t, a sin t, h t),
t ∈R.
This is lying on the cylinder x2 + y2 = a2.
Find the natural parametric representaion of the curve from (a, 0, 0), corresponding to t = 0.
D. Find the arc length s = s(t) as a function of the parameter t. Solve this equation t = t(s), and
put the result into the parametric representation above.

Alternative. The computation above was a little elaborated. However, the line integral
is independent of the chosen parametric description, and C is a circle with the exception of
the point (−1, 0), which is of no importance for the integration. Therefore, we can apply the
simpler parametric description
r(t) = (cos t, sin t),
t ∈] −π, π[,
where
r′(t) = (−sin t, cost)
and

D. First ﬁnd the line element ds expressed by means of ϕ and dϕ.
We shall here meet a very unpleasant integral, which we shall calculate in four diﬀerent ways:
1) by a substitution,
2) by using partial integration,
3) by using a pocket calculator,
4) by using MAPLE.

The line integral
I. Since ̺ = P(ϕ) = a ϕ, and since we have a description of the curve in polar coordinates, the line
element is
ds =

{P(ϕ)}2 + {P ′(ϕ)}2 dϕ =

(a ϕ)2 + a2 dϕ = a

1 + ϕ2 dϕ.

1 + ϕ2 dϕ.
1) Since 1 + sinh2 t = cosh2 t, we have

1 + sinh2 t = + cosh t, because both sides of the equation
sign must be positive. Thus we can remove the square root of the integrand by using the
monotonous substitution,
ϕ = sinh t,
dϕ = cosh t dt,
t = Arsinh ϕ = ln

ϕ +

1 + ϕ2

.
Since t can be expressed uniquely by ϕ, the substitution must be monotonous.

3) This is an example where a pocket calculator will give an equivalent, though diﬀerent answer,
so it is easy to see, whether a pocket calculator has been applied or not. It is here illustrated
by the use of a TI-89, where the command is given by
a ⋆

(

(1 + t^2), t, 0, b),
because neither ϕ nor α are natural. Then the answer of the pocket calculator is
(26.1) a ·

,
followed by writing α again instead of b.
However, if one does not apply a pocket calculator, but instead uses the standard methods of
integration, one would never state the result in the form (26.1). The reason for this discrepancy

1199 
The line integral
is that the programs of the pocket calculator are created from specialists in Algebra, and
they do not always speak the same mathematical language as the specialists in Calculus or
Mathematical Analysis. In Calculus the priority of the terms would be (b = α)
a
2

α

α +


,
because one would try to put as many factors as possible outside the parentheses and then
order the rest of the terms, such that the simplest is also the ﬁrst one. Obviously, this is not
the structure of (26.1).
The morale of this story is that even if a pocket calculator may give the right result, this result
does not have to be put in a practical form. It is even worse by applications of e.g. MAPLE
where the result is sometimes given in a form using functions which are not known by students
of Calculus.
Note also that pocket calculators in general do not like the operations | · | and √·, and cases
where we have got two parameters. The latter is not even one of the favorites of MAPLE
either, and it is in fact possible to obtain some very strange results by using MAPLE on even
problems from this part of Calculus. I shall therefore give the following warning: Do not use
pocket calculators and computer programs like MAPLE or Mathematica uncritically! Since they
exist, they should of course be applied, but do it with care. ♦
4) For completeness we include an application of MAPLE. Without further help we just get
Int

a ·

1 + t2, t = 0..α

 α

t2 + 1 dt
Apparently one should use some additional package from MAPLE in order to get this right
and not like here just use the most “obvious”.
Example 26.12
A. Find the value of the line integral I =

C |y| ds, where C is the cardioid given in polar coordinates
by
̺ = P(ϕ) = a(1 + cos ϕ),
−π ≤ϕ ≤π.
Examination of dimensions: Since ̺ ∼a, we get

C · · · ds ∼a, and since y ∼a, The result must
be of the form c · a · a = c · a2.
Due to the numerical sign in the integrand we must be very careful.
In particular, a pocket
calculator will be in big trouble here, if one does not give it a hand from time to time during the
calculations.
D. First ﬁnd the line element ds.

Without using some additional help MAPLE does not return the result.
C. Weak control. The result is of the correct dimension a2. Furthermore, the integrand is positive
almost everywhere, so the result must also be positive, which it is here. ♦

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

where we let the plane of the curve be the (X, Y )-plane in the space.
2. Prove that κ is proportional to s for C.
The curve under consideration has many names: the clothoid, Euler’s spiral, Cornu’s spiral.
Remark. “Clothoid” means in koin´e, i.e. Ancient Greek: κλωθω = I spin. ♦

The surface integral
27.1
The reduction theorem for a surface integral
Given a two-dimensional (piecewise) C1-surface F in R2. We shall in this chapter see, how we can
integrate a continuous function f, deﬁned on F, over the surface F. We shall use the notation

F
f(x) dS
for this surface integral. In the following we make sense of this abstract symbol.
Roughly speaking, the introduction of the surface integral should in some sense follow that of the
line integral in Chapter 26. The present complication is of course that we are now dealing with two
dimensions instead of just one, and two-dimensional connected sets may have a far more complicated
boundary than a one-dimensional connected set, the boundary of which only consists of at most two
points. Furthermore, if F is a C1-surface (of dimension 2) in R3, then clearly F does not have interior
points in R3, and yet we have a sense of the existence of an intrinsic boundary of F, which we shall
denote by δF. Obviously, δF must not have a too complicated geometrical structure.
Besides the geometry of the surface the area and the area element also play key roles in the deﬁnition
of the surface integral. For later use we denote the area of the surface F by area(F), though we still
have not given the slightest clue of how to ﬁnd area(F).
We shall ﬁrst analyze the area element dS. In order to do that we assume that F is a C1-surface in
R3, given by
F =

x ∈R3 | x = r(u, v) for (u, v) ∈E

,
where E ⊆R2 is a parameter domain in the usual plane, and r : E →R3 is of class C1.
The idea is to approximate a small surface area element ∆S by a small parallelogram in the neighbour-
hood, because we can calculate the area of the parallelogram. The price is that this parallelogram does
not have to lie in F, and seldom does, with the exception of the reference point. This construction is
done by introducing the parameter curves through the point P under consideration.
Let P ∈F be the point corresponding to the parameters (u, v) ∈E◦, i.e. in the interior of E. Since
E◦is open, we have for small ∆u, ∆v = 0 that (u + ∆u, v), (u, v + ∆v) ∈E, and we can deﬁne the
two small vectors
U := r(u + ∆u, v) −r(u, v)
and
V = r(u, v + ∆v) −r(u, v),
cf. Figure 27.1, where the parallelogram spanned by U and V approximates the small area element
∆S lying on F.
We note that
U ≃r′
u(u, v)∆u
and
V ≃r′
v(u, v)∆v.
Since U and V are vectors in R3, we can form the vector product N = U × V, which is perpendicular
to both U and V, hence a normal to the surface F at P. Furthermore, it is well-known from Linear
Algebra that the length N = U × V is equal to the area of the parallelogram deﬁned by the two
vectors U and V. We therefore get
∆S ≃U × V ≃N(u, v)∆u∆v = r′
u × r′
v ∆u∆v.

Figure 27.1: Approximation of the area element ∆S.
Hence, we may expect that we in the limit may write
dS = N(u, v) du dv = r′
u × r′
v du dv.
This is correct in all the cases we shall consider in the following. Here we only mention that it is
possible to create some geometric examples where this construction fails. These unexpected examples
will not be relevant in this series of books.

The surface integral
We formulate without proof
Theorem 27.1 The reduction theorem for a surface integral Assume that F is a C1-surface in R3
of parametric description r : E →R3, where the parameter domain E ⊂R3 is bounded and closed.
We assume that r is injective almost everywhere, and also that
N = r′
u × r′
v = 0
almost everywhere.
Let F ⊆A ⊆R3, and assume that f : A →R is a continuous function. Then the surface integral is
reduced to an ordinary plane integral by the formula

F
f(x) dS =

E
f(r(u, v))N(u, v) du dv.
Theorem 27.1 reduces a surface integral to an ordinary plane integral at the cost of an additional
factor, the weight function N(u, v), which is the length of the normal vector with respect to the
given parametric description r : E →R3. This (abstract) plane integral is then again in the next step
reduced to a double integral by using some of the previous reduction theorems from Chapter 20. So
in principal we calculate a surface integral by the following scheme,
surface integral →plane integral →double integral.
If we choose f ≡1, we of course get the area of F,
Theorem 27.2 The area of a surface F. Let F be a C1-surface of parametric description r : E →R3,
where E ⊂R2 is a closed and bounded domain, and r is injective almost everywhere, as well as the
normal N = 0 almost everywhere. Then the area of F is given by the weighted plane integral
area(F) =

E
|N(u, v) du dv.
In the following sections we shall give reduction formulæ in some important special cases.

The integral over the graph of a function in two variables
Consider a surface F which in rectangular coordinates is the graph of the equation
z = Z(x, y),
for (x, y) ∈E,
where Z ∈C1(E). Then the parametric description of F is given by
x = (x, y, z) = r(x, y) = (x, y, Z(x, y)),

t ∈[a, b],
z ∈[Z1(t), Z2(t)] .
Then the normal N with respect to the given parametric description r is given by
N(t, z) = (Y ′(t), −X′(t), 0).

The surface integral
27.1.3
The integral over a surface of revolution
For convenience we assume that the surface O of revolution has the z-axis as its axis. The meridian
curve is denoted M. We use that
r(t, ϕ) = (P(t) cos ϕ, P(t) sin ϕ, Z(t)),
t ∈[a, b],
ϕ ∈[0, 2π],
is a parametric description of O.
The meridian curve M is in semi-polar coordinates given by
̺ = P(t)
and
z = Z(t)
for t ∈[a, b].
We have previously found – or it is easy to calculate again – that the normal vector is then given by
N(t, ϕ) = P(t){−Z′(t) cos ϕ, −Z′(t) sin ϕ, P ′(t)}.
Then the reduction formular for the surface integral becomes

O
f(x, y, z) dS =
 b
a
 2π
0
f(P(t) cos ϕ, P(t) sin ϕ, Z(t)) dϕ

P(t)

{P ′(t)}2 + {Z′(t)}2 dt.
If we instead use spherical coordinates, then the meridian curve M is given by
r = R(t)
and
θ = Θ(t)
for t ∈[a, b].
Since
̺ = r sin θ
and
z = r cos θ,
we get
P(t) = R(t) sin Θ(t)
and
Z(t) = R(t) cos Θ(t),
so the reduction formula for the surface integral in spherical coordinates is given by

Cf(x, y, z) dS =
 b
a
 2pi
0
F(t, ϕ) dϕ

R(t) sin Θ(t)

{R′(t)}2 + {R(t)Θ′(t)}2 dt,
where we for short have written
F(t, ϕ) := f(R(t) sin Θ(t)cos ϕ, R(t) sin Θ(t)sin ϕ, R(t) cos Θ(t)).
The latter equation is also written in the following more compact (and abstract) form

C
f(x, y, z) dS =

M
 2π
0
f(̺ cos ϕ, ̺ sin ϕ, z) dϕ

All these formulæ may at a ﬁrst glance look scaring, but in practical applications it is usually easy
to see what we should do. The worst complication is probably that when we take the length of the
normal vector, then we almost always will get a square root in the new integrand, and functions like
square roots and absolute values are always diﬃcult to integrate.

Procedures for reduction of a surface integral
We consider 2-dimensional surfaces imbedded in R3. The idea is to pull the integration over the
surface F back to a plane integral over the parameter domain E, where we can use one of the methods
from Chapter 20. This procedure has its price because we must add some weight function as a factor
to the integrand.

Procedure:
1) Write down a rectangular parameter representation of the surface F:
(x, y, z) = r(u, v),
(u, v) ∈E.
The parameter domain E  R2 is then identiﬁed and sketched (a set lying in the plane).
Remark 27.1 It is not always possible to sketch F in the space, but this does not matter much,
because the real calculations are taking place in the parameter domain E. ♦
2) Determine the weight function: Calculate the vectors

applying one of the methods from Chapter refch20,

E
f(r(u, v)) N(u, v) du dv.
If f(x, y, z) ≡1, the surface integral is interpreted as the area of the surface F. In this case we get
Theorem 27.6 Surface area:

It is of course possible also to use some known area formulæ instead of calculating the cumbersome
integral above. If for instance F is the surface of a sphere of radius r, then it is well-known that
area(F) = area(∂B[0, r]) = 4πr2.
Special cases:
In the following special cases we reduce 2) in the procedure by inserting the given area element dS.

D. The usual procedure is to consider F as a graph of the function
z = f(x, y) = xy,
(x, y) ∈E.
We shall not do this here, but instead alternatively introduce a rectangular parametric represen-
tation (x, y, z) = r(u, v). Then afterwards we shall ﬁnd the weight function N(u, v).
I. The parameters u and v are for obvious reasons not given above. They are introduced by duplicating
(x, y) by the trivial formula

The surface integral
i.e. we choose the parametric representation
r(u, v) = (x, y, z) = (u, v, uv),
0 ≤u ≤
√
3,
0 ≤v ≤

1 + u2,
so we can distinguish between (x, y) as the ﬁrst two coordinates on the surface in the 3-dimensional
space, and (u, v) ∈E in the parametric domain. By experience it is always diﬃcult to understand
why we use this duplication, until one realizes that we in this way can describe two diﬀerent aspects
(as described above) of the same coordinates. This will be very useful in the following.
Since
∂r
∂u = (1, 0, v)
and
∂r
∂v = (0, 1, u),
the corresponding normal vector becomes
N(u, v) = ∂r
∂u × ∂r
∂v =

= (−v, −u, 1).
Hence
N(u, v) =

1 + u2 + v2.
When dS denotes the area element on F, and dS1 denotes the area element on E, then we have
the correspondence
dS =

1 + u2 + v2 dS1.
The abstract surface integral over F is therefore reduced to the abstract plane integral over E by

F
z dS =

E
u v

1 + u2 + v2 dS.
Then we reduce the abstract plane integral over E in rectangular coordinates, where the v-integral
is the inner one,

Then calculate the inner integral by means of the substitution

Example 27.3
A. A surface of revolution O is obtained by revolving the meridian curve M given by
r = a(1 + sin θ),
0 ≤θ ≤π
2 ,
a > 0,
where θ is the angle measured from the z-axis and r is the distance to (0, 0) (an arc of a cardioid,
cf. Example 26.12). Calculate the surface integral

The ﬁnal result must therefore be of the form c · a, where c is the constant, we are going to ﬁnd.
D. When we look at surfaces (or bodies) of revolution one should always try either semi-polar or
spherical coordinates. Since the parametric representation of the meridian curve M is given in a
way which is very similar to the spherical coordinates, it is quite reasonable to expect that one
should use spherical coordinates.

VIII Line Integrals and Surface Integrals

The surface integral
There is no t in A, so we must start by introducing the parameter t in a convenient form. Then
we shall identify the transformed function F(t, ϕ) as well as the weight function, and ﬁnally we
shall carry out all the integrations.
I. 1) The introduction of the parameter t. The most obvious thing is to put θ = t, i.e. M is described
by
r = R(t) = a (1 + sin t),
θ = Θ(t) = t,
0 ≤t ≤π
2 .
By doing this we split the diﬀerent aspects: θ belongs to the curve M, and t belongs to the
parametric interval

0, π
2

= [a, b].
2) Identiﬁcation of F(t, ϕ) and the weight function. Since
z = R(t) cos Θ(t) = a(1 + sin t) cos t
on M,
and
x2 + y2 + z2 = r2 = R(t)2 = a2(1 + sin t)2
on M,
we obtain the integrand
f(x, y, z) =
z
x2+y2+z2 = a(1+sint) cos t
a2(1+sint)2
=
cos t
a(1+sint) = F(t, ϕ),
which is independent of ϕ. Since the weight function and the boundaries of do not depend on
t either, the ϕ-integral becomes trivial, and we can put  2π
0
dϕ = 2π outside the integral as a
factor.
Then we calculate the weight function,
R(t) sin Θ(t)

{R′(t)}2 + {R(t)Θ′(t)}2
= a(1 + sin t) · sin t ·

{a cos t}2 + {a(1 + sin t) · 1}2
= a(1 + sin t) · sin t · a

cos2 t + (1 + 2 sin t + sin2 t)
= a2(1 + sin t) · sin t ·

2(1 + sin t)
=
√
2 a2(1 + sin t)
3
2 · sin t.
3) Integration by reduction. First we note that the parametric domain is 2-dimensional,
D =

(ϕ, t)
 0 ≤ϕ ≤2π, 0 ≤t ≤π
2

.
In fact, dimension corresponds to dimension, and since F is a C∞-surface, the parametric
domain D must necessarily be 2-dimensional. (If not we have made an error, so start from the
very beginning!)

The surface integral
Example 27.8 Calculate in each of the following cases the given surface integral over the surface
given by a parametric description
F =

x ∈R3 | x = r(u, v), (u, v) ∈E

.
First ﬁnd the normal vector of the surface N(u, v).
1) The surface integral

F xz2 dS, where the surface F is given by
x = r(u, v) = (u cos v, u sin v, hv),
for 0 ≤u ≤1, 0 ≤v ≤2π.
2) The surface integral

F z2 dS, where the surface F is given by
x = r(u, v) = (√u cos v, √u sin v, ev)
for 1 ≤u ≤2, ln u
2
≤v ≤ln(2u)
2
.
3) The surface integral

F(x2 + y2) dS, where the surface F is given by
x = r(u, v) =
√u cos v, √u sin v, v
3
2

for 1 ≤u ≤2, 0 ≤v ≤u.
4) The surface integral

F(x3 + 2z −3xy) dS, where the surface F is given by
x = r(u, v) = (u + v, u2 + v2, u3 + v3)
for u + v ≤0, u2 + v2 ≤5.
A Surface integrals, where the surface is given by a parametric description.
D First ﬁnd the normal vector N(u, v). Then compute the weight function N(u, v) as a function
of the parameters (u, v) ∈E.
I 1) The normal vector is
N(u, v) = ∂r

= (h sin v, −h cos v, u),
and we ﬁnd accordingly the weight function

h2 + u2.

=
(6uv(vu), 3(u + v)(u −v), 2(v −u)) = (v −u)(6uv, −3(u + v), 2).
Hence the weight function
N(u, v) = |v −u|

36u2v2 + 9(u2 + 2uv + v2) + 4.
This expression looks very impossible, so we can only hope for that some factor of the integrand
cancels the unfortunate square root.
The integrand is given in the parameters of the surface by
x3 + 2z −3xy = (u + v)3 + 2(u3 + v3) −3(u + v)(u2 + v2)
= u3 + 3u2v + 3uv2 + v3 + 2u3 + 2v3 −3u3 −3u2v −3uv2 −3v3
= 0.
Luckily, the surface of integration F is a zero surface of the integrand, so there is nothing to
worry about,

F
(x3 + 2z −3xy) dS = 0.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

The surface integral
A similar symmetric consideration shows that if g(x, y, z) is a homogeneous polynomial of odd
degree, then

F
g(x, y, z) dS = 0.
Split F into the eight surfaces occurring by the intersections by the three coordinate planes. By
assuming that g(x, y, z) is odd, it follows by the symmetry of the sphere that the surfaces can be
paired in such a way that the sum of the surface integrals over each pair is zero. (The details are
left to the reader).
Since x f(x, y, z), y f(x, y, z) and z f(x, y, z) all are homogeneous of degree 3, we conclude that
P = 0.
Remark. We shall for obvious reasons skip the traditional variants which give a lot of tedious
computations. The reason for including this example is of course to demonstrate that one in some
cases may beneﬁt from the symmetry. ♦
Example 27.10 Let F be the sphere given by r = a and let R denote the distance from the point
(x, y, z) on the sphere to the point (0, 0, w) on the Z-axis. Calculate
U(w) =

F
1
R dS.
One may assume that w ≥0. The cases w = a and w = 0, however, must be treated separately.
A Surface integral.
D We may for symmetric reasons assume that w ≥0. We shall ﬁrst check where 1
R is harmonic. To
this end we use the mean value theorem, whenever possible. Then proceed by calculating U(w)
directly. We get some special cases, when either w = a or w = 0. We have an improper integral in
the former case and lots of symmetry in the latter one.
I Clearly,
1
R =
1

x2 + y2 + (z −w)2 =

x2 + y2 + (z −w)2−1
2 .
It follows immediately for w = 0 that
U(0) =

F
1
a dS = 1
a area(F) = 4πa.
Remark. It can be mentioned aside that we get by using a so-called Riesz transformation that
U(w) = U(0) = 4πa
for −a < w < a.
However, Riesz-transformations cannot be assumed for most readers, so we shall here give a straight
proof instead. ♦
It follows from the expression of 1
R that U(−w) = U(w), and we have again explained why we can
choose w ≥0.

4) The curve M is a part of an hyperbola, cf. 1), and the axis of rotation intersects the foci of
the hyperbola. We therefore conclude that O is a subset of an hyperboloid of revolution with

2. Show that the curve has a tangent at the point corresponding to t = 0.
3. Find the length of K.
The curve K is projected onto the (X, Y )-plane in a curve K∗. Let O denote the surface of revolution
which is obtained by rotating the curve K∗once around the X-axis; and C denotes the cylinder surface
which has K∗as its leading curve and the Z-axis as its direction of generators, and which is lying
between the curve K and the plane z = −x.
4. Find the area of O.
5. Find the area of C.
A Length of a space curve; area of a surface of revolution and a cylinder surface.
D Calculate r′(t) and show that r′(t) = 0 in

Finally, calculate the surface areas.
I 1) We get by a diﬀerentiation
r′(t)

−3 sin t + 6 cos2 t sin t, 6 sin2 t cos t, −3 sin t

=
3 sin t

2 cos2 t −1, 2 sin t cos t, −1

=
3 sin t (cos2t, sin 2t, −1).
Clearly, r′(t) = 0 for t ∈

0 , π

, hence the curve has a tangent in each of the points corre-
sponding to t ∈

that the curve has a tangent (actually a “half tangent”) at the point corresponding to t = 0.

Formulæ
Some of the following formulæ can be assumed to be known from high school. It is highly recommended
that one learns most of these formulæ in this appendix by heart.
28.1
Squares etc.
The following simple formulæ occur very frequently in the most diﬀerent situations.
(a + b)2 = a2 + b2 + 2ab,
a2 + b2 + 2ab = (a + b)2,
(a −b)2 = a2 + b2 −2ab,
a2 + b2 −2ab = (a −b)2,
(a + b)(a −b) = a2 −b2,
a2 −b2 = (a + b)(a −b),
(a + b)2 = (a −b)2 + 4ab,
(a −b)2 = (a + b)2 −4ab.
28.2
Powers etc.
Logarithm:

Exponential, ﬁxed base:

(extensions for some x, y),
(ax)y = axy, a > 0
(extensions for some x, y),
a−x = 1
ax , a > 0,
(extensions for some x),
n√a = a1/n, a ≥0,
n ∈N.
Square root:
√
x2 = |x|,
x ∈R.
Remark 28.1 It happens quite frequently that students make errors when they try to apply these
rules. They must be mastered! In particular, as one of my friends once put it: “If you can master the
square root, you can master everything in mathematics!” Notice that this innocent looking square
root is one of the most diﬃcult operations in Calculus. Do not forget the absolute value! ♦

28.3
Diﬀerentiation
Here are given the well-known rules of diﬀerentiation together with some rearrangements which some-
times may be easier to use:
{f(x) ± g(x)}′ = f ′(x) ± g′(x),
{f(x)g(x)}′ = f ′(x)g(x) + f(x)g′(x) = f(x)g(x)
f ′(x)
f(x) + g′(x)
g(x)

,
where the latter rearrangement presupposes that f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 0.
If g(x) = 0, we get the usual formula known from high school
f(x)
g(x)
′
= f ′(x)g(x) −f(x)g′(x)
g(x)2
.
It is often more convenient to compute this expression in the following way:
f(x)
g(x)

= d
dx

f(x) ·
1
g(x)

= f ′(x)
g(x) −f(x)g′(x)
g(x)2
= f(x)
g(x)
f ′(x)
f(x) −g′(x)
g(x)

,
where the former expression often is much easier to use in practice than the usual formula from high
school, and where the latter expression again presupposes that f(x) = 0 and g(x) = 0. Under these
assumptions we see that the formulæ above can be written
{f(x)g(x)}′
f(x)g(x)
= f ′(x)
f(x) + g′(x)
g(x) ,
{f(x)/g(x)}′
f(x)/g(x)
= f ′(x)
f(x) −g′(x)
g(x) .
Since
d
dx ln |f(x)| = f ′(x)
f(x) ,
f(x) = 0,
we also name these the logarithmic derivatives.
Finally, we mention the rule of diﬀerentiation of a composite function
{f(ϕ(x))}′ = f ′(ϕ(x)) · ϕ′(x).
We ﬁrst diﬀerentiate the function itself; then the insides. This rule is a 1-dimensional version of the
so-called Chain rule.

exponential like. The derivatives of the inverse trigonometric and inverse hyperbolic functions are
power like, because we include the logarithm in this class. ♦

28.5
Integration
The most obvious rules are dealing with linearity

{f(x) + λg(x)} dx =

f(x) dx + λ

g(x) dx,
where λ ∈R is a constant,
and with the fact that diﬀerentiation and integration are “inverses to each other”, i.e. modulo some
arbitrary constant c ∈R, which often tacitly is missing,

f ′(x) dx = f(x).
If we in the latter formula replace f(x) by the product f(x)g(x), we get by reading from the right to
the left and then diﬀerentiating the product,
f(x)g(x) =

{f(x)g(x)}′ dx =

f ′(x)g(x) dx +

f(x)g′(x) dx.
Hence, by a rearrangement
The rule of partial integration:

f ′(x)g(x) dx = f(x)g(x) −

f(x)g′(x) dx.
The diﬀerentiation is moved from one factor of the integrand to the other one by changing the sign
and adding the term f(x)g(x).
Remark 28.3 This technique was earlier used a lot, but is almost forgotten these days. It must
be revived, because MAPLE and pocket calculators apparently do not know it.
It is possible to
construct examples where these devices cannot give the exact solution, unless you ﬁrst perform a
partial integration yourself. ♦
Remark 28.4 This method can also be used when we estimate integrals which cannot be directly
calculated, because the antiderivative is not contained in e.g. the catalogue of MAPLE. The idea is
by a succession of partial integrations to make the new integrand smaller. ♦
Integration by substitution:
If the integrand has the special structure f(ϕ(x))·ϕ′(x), then one can change the variable to y = ϕ(x):

f(ϕ(x)) · ϕ′(x) dx = “

f(ϕ(x)) dϕ(x)′′ =

y=ϕ(x)
f(y) dy.

Formulæ
Integration by a monotonous substitution:
If ϕ(y) is a monotonous function, which maps the y-interval one-to-one onto the x-interval, then

f(x) dx =

y=ϕ−1(x)
f(ϕ(y))ϕ′(y) dy.
Remark 28.5 This rule is usually used when we have some “ugly” term in the integrand f(x). The
idea is to put this ugly term equal to y = ϕ−1(x). When e.g. x occurs in f(x) in the form √x, we put
y = ϕ−1(x) = √x, hence x = ϕ(y) = y2 and ϕ′(y) = 2y. ♦

There is an error in the programs of the pocket calculators TI-92 and TI-89. The numerical signs are
missing. It is obvious that
√
x2 −1 < |x| so if x < −1, then x +
√
x2 −1 < 0. Since you cannot take
the logarithm of a negative number, these pocket calculators will give an error message.

Trigonometric formulæ
The trigonometric formulæ are closely connected with circular movements. Thus (cos u, sin u) are
the coordinates of a point P on the unit circle corresponding to the angle u, cf. ﬁgure A.1. This
geometrical interpretation is used from time to time.

Figure 28.1: The unit circle and the trigonometric functions.
The fundamental trigonometric relation:
cos2 u + sin2 u = 1,
for u ∈R.
Using the previous geometric interpretation this means according to Pythagoras’s theorem, that the
point P with the coordinates (cos u, sin u) always has distance 1 from the origo (0, 0), i.e. it is lying
on the boundary of the circle of centre (0, 0) and radius
√
1 = 1.
Connection to the complex exponential function:
The complex exponential is for imaginary arguments deﬁned by
exp(i u) := cos u + i sin u.
It can be checked that the usual functional equation for exp is still valid for complex arguments. In
other word: The deﬁnition above is extremely conveniently chosen.
By using the deﬁnition for exp(i u) and exp(−i u) it is easily seen that
cos u = 1
2(exp(i u) + exp(−i u)),
sin u = 1
2i(exp(i u) −exp(−i u)),

Moivre’s formula: We get by expressing exp(inu) in two diﬀerent ways:
exp(inu) = cos nu + i sin nu = (cos u + i sin u)n.
Example 28.1 If we e.g. put n = 3 into Moivre’s formula, we obtain the following typical application,
cos(3u) + i sin(3u) = (cos u + i sin u)3
= cos3 u + 3i cos2 u · sin u + 3i2 cosu · sin2 u + i3 sin3 u
= {cos3 u −3 cosu · sin2 u} + i{3 cos2 u · sin u −sin3 u}
= {4 cos3 u −3 cosu} + i{3 sinu −4 sin3 u}
When this is split into the real- and imaginary parts we obtain
cos 3u = 4 cos3 u −3 cosu,
sin 3u = 3 sin u −4 sin3 u.
♦
Addition formulæ:
sin(u + v) = sin u cos v + cos u sin v,

Hyperbolic formulæ
These are very much like the trigonometric formulæ, and if one knows a little of Complex Function
Theory it is realized that they are actually identical. The structure of this section is therefore the same
as for the trigonometric formulæ. The reader should compare the two sections concerning similarities
and diﬀerences.
The fundamental relation:
cosh2 x −sinh2 x = 1.
Deﬁnitions:
cosh x = 1
2 (exp(x) + exp(−x)) ,
sinh x = 1
2 (exp(x) −exp(−x)) .
“Moivre’s formula”:
exp(x) = cosh x + sinh x.
This is trivial and only rarely used. It has been included to show the analogy.
Addition formulæ:
sinh(x + y) = sinh(x) cosh(y) + cosh(x) sinh(y),
sinh(x −y) = sinh(x) cosh(y) −cosh(x) sinh(y),
cosh(x + y) = cosh(x) cosh(y) + sinh(x) sinh(y),
cosh(x −y) = cosh(x) cosh(y) −sinh(x) sinh(y).
Formulæ of halving and doubling the argument:

Magnitudes of functions
We often have to compare functions for x →0+, or for x →∞. The simplest type of functions are
therefore arranged in an hierarchy:
1) logarithms,
2) power functions,
3) exponential functions,
4) faculty functions.
When x →∞, a function from a higher class will always dominate a function form a lower class. More
precisely:
A) A power function dominates a logarithm for x →∞:
(ln x)β
xα
→0
for x →∞,
α, β > 0.
B) An exponential dominates a power function for x →∞:
xα
ax →0
for x →∞,
α, a > 1.
C) The faculty function dominates an exponential for n →∞:
an
n! →0,
n →∞,
n ∈N,
a > 0.
D) When x →0+ we also have that a power function dominates the logarithm:
xα ln x →0−,
for x →0+,
α > 0.
