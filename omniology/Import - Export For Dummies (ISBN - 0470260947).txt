Dedication
I would like to dedicate this book to those family members and friends who
were always there to support me in my personal and professional endeavors.
A special thanks to my parents, who are missed and will always be part of my
life; my sons, John and Christopher; my “Cioci” Mary and Uncle Johnnie; and
Fred and Greg who guided me into my career in international business.
I would finally like to add a special thanks to Kathleen for showing a lot of
patience in putting up with me during the past several months while I was
working on this project.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I would like to thank Mike Baker, my acquisitions editor at Wiley, for his efforts
in finding me and providing me with this opportunity. I have always had a
passion for international business — I’ve been involved with importing or
exporting since 1970, having started out as an export assistant, then an
import assistant, an international traffic manager, director of international
operations, an entrepreneur, a seminar leader, and teacher — so writing this
kind of book is truly something I’ve always wanted to do. If it weren’t for Mike
finding me, I would never have had the opportunity to complete something
that was on my to-do list.
I would also like to express my thanks to the other members of the editorial
staff at Wiley, including my project editor, Elizabeth Kuball. Many thanks to
my good friend for many years, George Haber, who served as the technical
editor.
Finally, I would like to thank all those students who, over the past 20 years,
have sat through my “Build and Start Your Own Import/Export Business”
seminar. Their enthusiasm has always inspired me, and I have referred to
them and many of their stories throughout this text.

Import/Export For Dummies

Introduction
T
he global marketplace is a fast-growing and rapidly changing field.
International business is exploding as a direct result of changes in tech-
nology, rapidly expanding economies, and international trade agreements —
the United States imports $1.2 trillion and exports $772 billion in goods per
year. If you want to start your own international business, or diversify the
activities of your existing firms, you’ve come to the right place.
About This Book
Import/Export For Dummies is a reference book — something you can keep 
on your desk and turn to when you have questions, as well as something 
you can read through from beginning to end if you like. Either way, this book
helps you determine whether the business of international trade is for you. 
In this book, you
 Explore how to set up an office for international trade
 Find products to import and export
 Identify target markets and find customers
 Make sense of applicable rules and regulations
 Find out how to complete the necessary licensing application and 
shipping documents
Finally, Import/Export For Dummies gives you know-how and up-to-date info
that you need in order to enter or advance in the challenging and highly
rewarding world of importing and exporting.
Conventions Used in This Book
I don’t use too many special conventions in this book, but you should be
aware of the following:

 Italics are used for emphasis and to highlight new words or terms, which
I define shortly thereafter, often in parentheses.
 Boldface is used to indicate the action part of numbered steps.
 Monofont is used for e-mail and Web addresses.
Note: When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to
break across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that we haven’t
put in any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. So, when
using one of these Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see in this

What You’re Not to Read
The great thing about the For Dummies series is that you can choose what to
read and what to skip. You aren’t going to be quizzed on anything in this
book.
If you’re looking for guidance on exactly what the most skippable text is, keep
this in mind:
 Sidebars (text in gray boxes) are for topics that are interesting but not
essential to your understanding of the material, so if you’re in a hurry,
skip them.
 Anything marked with a Technical Stuff icon is safe to skip, too. (For
more on this icon, see “Icons Used in This Book,” later in this
Introduction.)
Foolish Assumptions
I don’t make many assumptions about you as the reader of the book, but I do
assume the following:
 You may be an entrepreneur or an owner of a small to medium-size busi-
ness, and you’re looking to get involved in importing and exporting.
 You may be an employee of a business that’s planning to get involved in
importing and exporting, and you want to be in the know.
 You have some business experience, but you may never have imported
or exported before.
 You may be a college or business student taking an import/export
course, and you want information in plain English.

Import/Export For Dummies 

How This Book Is Organized
I divide Importing/Exporting For Dummies into six parts. You don’t have to
read all the parts, and you don’t have to read them in order.
Here’s the lowdown on what to expect.
Part I: Breaking into the 
Import/Export Business
Before you can put together a plan, you have to identify objectives and set
goals. This part helps you determine how much money you need to invest,
and how much can you earn in an import/export business. I cover the vari-
ous approaches available to you in import/export business opportunities. 
I also help you identify the rules and regulations that are applicable to firms
importing products into, or exporting products from, the United States.
Finally, every business owner must make decisions in setting up a business.
Chapter 4 addresses issues such as deciding on a trade name, forms of orga-
nization, registration, bank accounts, office equipment, addresses, telephone
numbers, Web sites, and e-mail addresses.
Part II: Selecting Products and Suppliers
In this part, I turn to selecting products and finding firms to supply you with
those products. I provide guidelines that enable you to narrow that infinite
number of products, and make the selection of the products you want to
import or export. If you’re already in business and want to go global with
your product, skip Chapter 5 and head straight for Chapter 6 or Chapter 7.
Part III: Identifying Your Target Market
and Finding Customers
In this part, I fill you in on selecting a target market and finding customers for
the products that you’ve selected. I review the process of creating and deliv-
ering goods and services to customers. I share the importance of knowing
your company’s target customers’ needs, demands, and wants; offering the
products and services that will satisfy those needs, demands, and wants; and
providing customers with quality, service, convenience, and value so that
they continue being your customers. Then I help you develop a marketing
plan focusing on the customer and build a strategy leading to success for
your business.

Introduction

Part IV: Completing the Transaction:
International Trade Procedures 
and Regulations
After you’ve identified the applicable rules and regulations, selected your
products, identified your target markets, and developed a marketing plan,
you need to deal with procedural issues, such as negotiating a price and
arranging for payments.
This part identifies the various terms of sale that are used in all international
transactions. I also cover the alternative methods of payments that are 
used when dealing with overseas suppliers or customers. Issues relating to
documentation, logistics, insurance, packing, Customs brokers, and freight
forwarders are also covered in this part.
I end the part with a general explanation of import requirements, in case
you’re interested in going into an importing business or you want to import
something for personal use and not for resale. Chapter 16 provides info on
the process and documents required to import goods into the United States,
the methods used in determining the dutiable value for the goods being
imported, and what Customs is looking for when the goods are examined.
In addition, this part covers import quotas, which can limit your ability to
import specific products from specific countries. Finally, I focus on the role 
of international trade agreements and their effect on import/export business
opportunities.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In the Part of Tens, I give you reminders, hints, observations, and warnings
about what to do and not to do as you strive to be a successful importer
and/or exporter.
Part VI: Appendixes
This part is all about references. You’ll find a glossary of international 
business terms, resources that can help you in the import/export business,
and a guide for developing a distributor agreement or agency agreement 
with another company.

Icons Used in This Book
Icons are those little images in the left-hand margins of the book, designed to
draw your attention to certain kinds of information. Here’s what they mean:
When you see the Tip icon, you can be sure to find a helpful piece of 
information that’ll save you time or money or just make your life as an
importer/exporter easier.
Ouch! You may get burned if you don’t heed these warnings.
You don’t have to memorize this book, but occasionally, I tell you something
that bears repeating or that you’ll want to commit to memory. When I do, I
flag the info with this icon.
Sometimes I tell you more information than you really need on a particular
subject, and when I do, I flag that info with this icon. If you just want the
basics, skip anything marked with this icon.
Where to Go from Here
If you’re the kind of person who never missed a homework assignment in
your life and did every extra credit assignment possible, you’ve probably
already read the copyright information and table of contents. In that 
case, keep on reading until you hit the very last page of the book, and you’ll
be happy.
If you’re more interested in getting the information you need, the table of
contents and index are your new best friends. Use them to locate just the
information you need, without having to read anything you don’t.
Still not sure where to go? Here’s a quick guide: If you’re trying to decide
whether importing/exporting is right for you and how doing business 
internationally is different, turn to Chapter 1. If you’re interested in finding
out whether you need a license or permit before you can import or export a
product, turn to Chapter 3. If you want to find suppliers, turn to Chapters 6
and 7. If you want to find customers, turn to Chapters 11 and 12. If you want
to figure out how to pay or get paid from individuals or firms from other
countries, turn to Chapter 14. And if you want to clear a shipment through
U.S. Customs, turn to Chapter 16.

Breaking into the
Import/Export
Business

In this part . . .
T
he opportunity to conduct import/export business is
everywhere. The global marketplace is a fast growing
and rapidly changing field. International business is explod-
ing as a direct result of changes in technology, expanding
economies, and international trade agreements.
In this part, I fill you in on the different environmental
forces that you encounter when doing business with other
countries. I explain the various approaches to exporting
and importing, together with some of the qualities that
you need in order to be successful. I help you consider
your motivations for wanting to start your own import/
export business and tell you why someone with an exist-
ing business may consider moving into the international
business arena.
I offer guidelines that you can use to determine how much
money you need to invest and how much you can earn. I
tell you who to contact to identify the rules and regulations
when importing goods into, or exporting goods from, the
United States. Finally, I help you organize for your export
and import operations.

t’s hard to imagine a more exciting time for international trade than 
the present. The opportunities for exporting and importing are growing at
an impressive rate — and with those opportunities come challenges. Many
factors have contributed to this growth: the establishment of the World
Trade Organization (WTO), the implementation of trade agreements such as
the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Dominican
Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA), the continued
economic integration of Europe, and the growth of emerging markets such as
India, China, Turkey, and more.
You’re living in an exciting time! In the past, opportunities for many small
businesses ended within the borders of their own country, and international
trade was only for large multinational corporations. Today, the global market-
place provides opportunities not just for the multinational corporation, but
also for small upstart companies. The Internet, affordable changes in technol-
ogy, and increased access to information have all made it easier for firms of
all sizes to engage in international trade.
Defining the Import/Export Business
Exporting is sending goods out of your country in order to sell them in
another country. Importing is bringing goods into your country from another
country in order to sell them.

Most companies begin their initial involvement in international business by
exporting or importing. Both of these approaches require minimal invest-
ment and are, for the most part, free of any major risks. They provide individ-
uals and companies with a way of getting into international business without
the commitment of significant financial resources (like the kind that would be
required to actually set up shop overseas).
Exporting: Do you want what I’ve got?
Exporting comes in two major forms:
 Direct exporting is a business activity occurring between an exporter
and an importer without the intervention of a third party. This option is
a good one for existing businesses that are looking for ways to expand
their operations.
 Indirect exporting is simpler than direct exporting. It involves exporting
goods through various intermediaries in the producer’s country. Indirect
exporting doesn’t require any expertise or major cash expenditures, and
it’s the type of exporting used most often by many companies that are
new to exporting.
As you gain experience in doing business internationally, you may want
to move from indirect exporting to direct exporting.
Indirect exporting
Indirect exporting can include the use of an export management company or
something called piggyback exporting, both of which I cover in this section.
Export management companies
An export management company (EMC) is a private company based in the
United States that serves as the export department for several manufactur-
ers, soliciting and transacting export business on behalf of its clients. EMCs
normally take title to the goods and assume all the risks associated with
doing business in other countries. Using an EMC is helpful when you’re new
to exporting or you don’t have a distributor or agent in a foreign country.
Many entrepreneurs not interested in manufacturing can get involved in
exporting by setting up an export management company. If you have a net-
work of overseas contacts, some general product knowledge, and a desire to
start an export business, contact American manufacturers who aren’t
actively exporting and offer your services.
10
Part I: Breaking into the Import/Export Business 

For example, I was employed in the healthcare industry selling goods interna-
tionally. During that period, I identified customers in various countries. With
that knowledge in hand, I decided to establish an EMC. So I contacted med-
ical products manufacturers who weren’t actively involved in exporting. I
identified several manufacturers who had products that would be of interest
to my client. I offered my services to these firms and found that they were
interested in exploring a business relationship with me. They wanted to open
up new markets, but they’d been hesitant because they didn’t want to deal
with many exporting issues (payment, documentation, shipping, and so on).
Piggyback exporting
Piggyback exporting is a foreign distribution operation where your products
are sold along with those of another manufacturer. This form of exporting is
used by companies that have related or complementary but noncompetitive
products.
For example, let’s say that you have a company that manufactures hair-
brushes. You’re not yet exporting, but you’re interested in selling your hair-
brushes in Italy. You just don’t want to assume any risks or deal with major
headaches. Across town is a company that makes shampoos. It’s a well-
established manufacturer and exporter of a line of shampoo products — 
and it’s currently selling its entire product line to the Italian marketplace. In
piggyback exporting, you approach the shampoo company and offer to allow
that company to represent and sell your hairbrushes in Italy.
Why would the shampoo company be interested in such a deal? Because 
this enables the shampoo company to offer a more complete line of products
to its distributors with little to no additional investment. The shampoo com-
pany will profit either by purchasing the hairbrushes and adding on a markup
or by coordinating a commission arrangement with you.
Direct exporting
In this case, you do your own exporting. Companies usually only export
directly after having exported indirectly for a while. If you’re interested in
direct exporting, you can choose one of three routes:
 Use an agent. An agent is a company that acts as an intermediary but,
unlike an EMC (see “Export management companies,” earlier in this
chapter), it does not take title to the goods. You can appoint an agent 
in each market (or country), and the agent solicits orders, with goods
and payment for the goods happening directly between you and the 
customer in the other country.
 Appoint a distributor. You can appoint a distributor in another country
who will purchase goods, take title, and service the customers on 
your behalf.
11
Chapter 1: Introducing Import/Export

 Set up an overseas sales office. You can go over to another country,
perhaps rent a warehouse, set up an office, and distribute the goods to
customers. In practice, you’re exporting to yourself overseas.
Importing: Can I sell 
what you’ve got?
Importers are the reverse of exporters. They purchase goods in foreign mar-
kets and sell them domestically. An importer can be a small company that
buys goods from distributors and manufacturers in foreign markets, or it can
be a global corporation for which importing components and raw materials
valued at millions of dollars is just one of its functions.
Because many businesses are facing intense price competition, more compa-
nies will look into the global marketplace to source products. Many other
nations have a well-educated and skilled workforce earning salaries less than
comparable workers in the United States. So in a desire to remain competi-
tive, U.S. companies import goods from suppliers in countries where costs
are lower than they are domestically. This is true for both low-cost items and
luxury items.
Before getting involved in importing, you may have trouble determining
whether the item you want to import is produced in foreign markets and, if
so, where to find them. Start by looking for similar products that are already
being sold in the market. By examining the product, you can learn where it’s
made and, often, by whom. The U.S. Customs service requires that all goods
be labeled with the country of origin on each product or on its container if
product marking is not feasible. After you have the product, you can use
many of the resources located in this book to identify suppliers.
Environmental Forces That Make
International Business Different
Doing business in a global environment is very different from doing business
domestically. When you move across your own borders, you have to deal
with a variety of dynamic environmental forces, conditions that will have an
impact on the operations of a company. Environmental forces are either inter-
nal (within the company) or external (outside the company). Internal forces
are the ones you can control, and external forces are the ones you can’t.
12
Part I: Breaking into the Import/Export Business 

Forces you can control
Let me start off with the good news: When you’re in business — any busi-
ness, whether domestic or international — certain factors are within your
control. These include things such as availability of capital, finances, raw
materials, personnel, and production and marketing capabilities. Your job 
is to coordinate these controllable forces so that you can adapt to the 
uncontrollable forces (see the following section).
Forces you can’t control
You can’t control everything in business, but you’ll be way ahead of the com-
petition if you recognize what you can’t control and figure out a way to adapt.
Economic and socioeconomic conditions
The economic and socioeconomic conditions in other countries are definitely
factors you have no control over. And yet, when you’re considering doing
business internationally, you have to closely examine those conditions,
because they may affect the attractiveness of the market. If you want to
export goods, a potential market must have enough people with the means 
to purchase your products. If you want to import goods, you need to 
understand the country’s labor costs.
Even after you’ve decided to do business in a particular country, your busi-
ness can be impacted by the country’s exchange rate, inflation, and interest
rates, all of which change over time.
Physical conditions
The impact of geography and natural resources is an important factor to be
considered. You need to be aware of the country’s location, size, topography,
and climate. The location of a country will also explain its trading relation-
ship and political alliances.
Political and legal conditions
When you’re importing or exporting, the primary political considerations 
are those having to do with the stability of the governments and their 
attitudes toward free trade. A friendly political atmosphere permits busi-
nesses to grow even though a country is poor in natural resources. The 
opposite is also true — some countries blessed with natural resources are
poor because of government instability or hostility.
13
Chapter 1: Introducing Import/Export

Regulations in other countries can often be quite different from those in the
domestic market. When you’re evaluating business opportunities around the
world, determine whether the country is governed by the rule of law, and
eliminate those countries that are political dictatorships. Look at a country’s
laws and how they interpret and enforce them.
You can find this information at www.stat-usa.gov and www.export.gov
(see Chapter 9).
Prior to finalizing any purchase or sale agreement, make sure that you under-
stand the warranties and service included. You and the company you’re
doing business with must agree about how defective or unsold products will
be handled. Confirm who will register trademarks, copyrights, and patents, if
applicable, and in whose name it will it be. Finally, make sure that any agree-
ment includes a provision for termination and settlement of disputes.
When you conduct business in the United States, domestic laws will cover 
all transactions. However, questions of the appropriate law and courts of
jurisdiction may arise in cases involving different countries. When a commer-
cial dispute arises between individuals from two different counties, each
person would prefer to have the matter adjudicated in his own courts and
under his own laws. Insert a clause in any agreement stating that each party
agrees that the laws of a particular country — preferably, for you, the 
United States — governs.
Cultural conditions
If you’re reading this book, you must have at least some interest in doing
business in a country other than your own. But importing/exporting isn’t just
about business — you also need to study the cultures of the countries you
want to work with.
Culture affects all business functions, including marketing, human resource
management, production, and finance. Culture is the total of the beliefs,
values, rules, techniques, and institutions that characterize populations. In
other words, it is the thing that makes individual groups different. In the 
following sections, I cover the aspects of culture that are especially impor-
tant to international businesspeople.
Aesthetics
Aesthetics is a society’s sense of beauty and good taste. In particular, you
want to pay attention to color and the messages that different colors may
convey. Color can mean different things in different cultures. For example,
black is the color of mourning in the United States and Mexico, while white is
14
Part I: Breaking into the Import/Export Business 

the color of mourning in Asia, and purple is the color of mourning in Brazil.
Green is the color of good luck in the Islamic world, so any item featuring
green is looked upon favorably there.
For more information on the uniqueness of cultures around the world and
how to apply the skills of cultural understanding to become more successful
in the global business environment, go to www.cyborlink.com and www.
executiveplanet.com.
Attitudes and beliefs
This includes predispositions — either favorable or unfavorable — toward
someone, someplace, or something. These attitudes and beliefs can influence
most aspects of human behavior, because they bring order to a society and
its individuals. The better you understand these differing attitudes and
beliefs, the better you’ll be able to deal with people from other countries.
Here’s an example: Attitudes toward time can create problems for many
Americans in other countries. Although Americans tend to think that time
equals money, people from the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America may feel
just the opposite. Arabs typically dislike deadlines, and when faced with one,
an Arab may feel threatened or as though he’s being backed into a corner.
Religion
Religion is one of the most important elements of culture. An awareness of
some of the basic beliefs of the major religions of the world will help you
understand why attitudes vary from country to country. As an importer/
exporter, keep in mind that religion influences all aspects of business. If you
don’t understand and adapt to a culture’s different religious beliefs, you’ll 
fail — that’s the bottom line.
For example, a company called American White Cross manufactured a variety
of first-aid products and sold them throughout the United States and around
the world. Because its corporate logo and packaging included a cross, it was
unable to market its product line in the Islamic world, because the cross is a
symbol representing Christianity.
For a primer on the major religions of the world, check out Religion For
Dummies, by Rabbi Marc Gellman and Monsignor Thomas Hartman (Wiley).
Material culture
Material culture consists of technology (how people make things) and eco-
nomics (who makes what and why). The aspects of culture and technology
apply not just to production, but also to marketing, finance, and manage-
ment. If you want to do business with other countries, and you’re using new
production methods and products, that may require changes in a society’s
beliefs and lifestyle — and change is never easy.
15
Chapter 1: Introducing Import/Export

Language
Language is probably the most obvious cultural distinction that newcomers
to international business face. Even though businesspeople all over the world
speak English, if you can communicate in the local language, you’ll have an
advantage. Plus, you’ll convey a sense of respect to your potential associates.
Although being able to communicate in the local language is a positive, you
can always use a translator — and not speaking the local language isn’t a
reason not to do business there.
The spoken language is important, but nonverbal communication is often
equally so. Gestures are a common form of communication and can have dif-
ferent meanings from one country to the next. For example, Americans and
most Europeans understand the thumbs-up gesture to mean that everything
is all right; however, in Southern Italy and Greece, it conveys the message for
which Americans reserve the middle finger. Making a circle with the thumb
and forefinger is the okay sign in the United States, but it’s a vulgar sexual
invitation in Greece and Turkey.
For more information on nonverbal communication and gestures, go to www.
cyborlink.com and www.executiveplanet.com.
Financial conditions
Values of currencies do not remain fixed — they change, sometimes 
rapidly, as they are traded in the world’s financial centers. Fluctuating 
currency values can result in major losses if a currency trader’s timing is
wrong. As an importer/exporter, you need to be able to read and understand
foreign exchange quotations, and recognize and understand currency
exchange risks.
Many newspapers list the foreign exchange table in their finance sections.
There you may see, among others, a quote like the one shown in Table 1-1.

This means that at close of business on Monday, the British pound cost in
U.S. dollars was 1.8412, and at the same time on Friday, the pound cost in U.S.
dollars was 1.8498. It also means that at close of business on Monday, the 
U.S. dollar was valued at 0.5431 British pounds, and at the same time Friday,
the U.S. dollar was valued at 0.5406 British pounds.
The spot rate is the exchange rate between two currencies quoted for deliv-
ery within two business days. The forward rate is a currency for delivery in
the future, usually 30, 60, 90, or 180 days down the road.
For the sake of example, let’s say 1 U.S. dollar equals 100 Japanese yen.
You’re selling an item to a client in Japan for US$10,000. The item would then
cost the client in Japan ¥1,000,000. If the rate of exchange fluctuates to ¥125
to the dollar, the same item would now cost your client ¥1,250,000.
In this example, the dollar is getting stronger. So, it’s making your product
more expensive and, hence, more difficult for you to export. On the other
hand, a strong dollar enables you to import more goods, because the dollar
has a stronger buying power.
You need to have a keen awareness of exchange rates and use them as a
factor in deciding when and with which country you may consider doing
business.
As a value of a currency increases in relation to the currency of another coun-
try, exports will decrease and imports will increase. On the other hand, as
the value of the currency decreases in relation to the other country, imports
will increase and exports will decrease. Exporters like a strong currency, and
importers like a weak currency.
The risk due to the fluctuation in the exchange rate is always assumed 
by the individual who is either making or receiving the payment in a foreign
currency. In other words, as an exporter, if you don’t want any risks, when
you invoice your client always do so in U.S. dollars; as an importer, always
request that the supplier quote to you in U.S. dollars.

works, check out Currency Trading For Dummies, by Mark Galant and Brian
Dolan (Wiley).

Import/Export Business
In This Chapter
 Looking at why you want to get involved in import/export
 Explaining different trade agreements and their impact on business
 Going global with your small business
 Determining how much money you need to invest
 Figuring out how much money you can expect to earn
P
eople get involved in the business of international trade for a variety 
of reasons:
 Foreign goods are everywhere. Next time you’re in a store, take a look
around: Almost everything is made overseas.
 The U.S. dollar is weak. The value of the dollar is (as of this writing) at 
a very low point, and a weak dollar is a positive for exports, because it
makes U.S. products cheaper in foreign markets.
 The U.S. dollar is strong. Although the dollar isn’t strong as of this 
writing, it has been very strong in the past and it’ll likely be strong again
in the future. When the dollar is strong, that’s a positive for imports,
because it makes foreign products cheaper in the United States.
 What happens in one part of the world has an immediate impact on
the rest of the world. Technological advancements, advancing
economies, and trade agreements have combined to make this the case.
Countries really do need each other — each nation relies on other
nations to exchange goods and services.
In this chapter, I help you identify why you’re interested in import/export, 
see what you can get out of adding import/export to your business, and
determine the costs — and rewards! — you can expect.

The Benefits of Import/Export
Existing businesses go abroad for one or both of the following reasons:
 To increase profits and sales
 To protect themselves from being eroded by competition
Some businesses make their initial entry into a foreign market by exporting.
Then they set up foreign sales companies. Finally, if the sales volume 
warrants it, they establish foreign production facilities.
Other businesses decide to get involved in importing to take advantage of
lower manufacturing costs, protect themselves from lower-priced imports
being sold in the United States, and remain competitive with other companies
doing business in the United States.
Businesses that are not exporting to sell products, importing to reduce costs,
and competing on a global basis will have difficulty surviving.
In the following sections, I cover the benefits of going global with your 
existing business.
Increasing sales and profits
Managers are always under constant pressure to increase sales and make
their companies more profitable. After a while, most businesses reach a point
where they can only sell so much (the market is saturated with the product),
and when a business reaches this point, it needs to look for new people to
sell its products to. When this happens, businesses often begin looking for
ways to sell their products overseas.
You can earn greater profits either by generating additional revenues or by
decreasing your cost of goods sold. Exporting allows you the opportunity to
increase sales and generate the desired additional revenues, and importing
enables you to identify alternative low-cost sources of supply.
Taking advantage of expanding 
international economies
New foreign markets are starting to appear and, in some instances, are 
growing at a faster rate than the United States. Today, U.S. businesses are
20
Part I: Breaking into the Import/Export Business 

seeing increases in exports to developing countries, especially those in Latin
America, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Growing
exports to these and other markets demonstrate that exporting is a viable
strategy for increasing sales. Companies also go overseas to obtain lower
manufacturing costs and protect themselves from lower-priced imports being
sold in their own country; importing enables them to be competitive with
other companies doing business in their country.
If you want to be an importer, you may want to start by looking at countries
like China, Mexico, Malaysia, Thailand, and Brazil, because they’re the largest
exporters of goods to the United States. If you want to be an exporter, look at
China, Mexico, Malaysia, Thailand, India, and Turkey — the largest importers
of American products.
Economies expand because:
 They offer a favorable business climate.
 Regulations to do business there are not insurmountable.
 They have an already established transportation infrastructure.
 As these economies continue to grow, they begin to produce and export
more, making available foreign exchange (money) to pay for exports
from the United States. A country earns foreign exchange by exporting
its products. As the country grows and exports more goods to the
United States, it has more money that it can use to purchase goods from
the United States.
Making use of trade agreements
Trade agreements involve a small group of countries getting together to
establish a free trade area among themselves, while maintaining trade restric-
tions with all other nations. These agreements provide improved market
access for U.S. consumer, industrial, and agricultural products.
Trade agreements also can help your business enter and compete more
easily in the global marketplace. They help level the international playing
field and encourage foreign governments to adopt open rulemaking proce-
dures, as well as laws and regulations that do not discriminate. Free trade
agreements help strengthen business climates by eliminating or reducing
tariff rates, improving intellectual property regulations, opening government
procurement opportunities, and easing investment rules.

These agreements provide the following benefits to small and medium-size
exporters:
 They lower the cost of selling to customers overseas by reducing high
tariffs on U.S. exports.
 They maximize small-business resources by eliminating inconsistent
Customs procedures and improving and reducing burdensome 
paperwork.
 They minimize risks in foreign markets by providing certainty and 
predictability for U.S. small-business owners and investors.
 They enforce intellectual property rights to make protection of rights
more easily accessible to small-business owners.
 They promote the rule of law so that small businesses know what the
rules are and that they’ll be applied fairly and consistently.
U.S. importers also benefit from such trade agreements. Just as the 
countries with whom the United States has a trade agreement have to pro-
vide improved market access for American goods, the United States must
also provide similar considerations to the countries with which the U.S. has
an agreement. So if you’re an importer and you deal with the countries the
United States has agreements with, you’ll also experience the elimination or
reduction of tariff rates.
Currently the United States has trade agreements with the following countries:
 Australia, under the United States–Australia Free Trade Agreement
 Bahrain, under the United States–Bahrain Free Trade Agreement
 Canada, under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
 Chile, under the United States–Chile Free Trade Agreement
 Colombia, under the United States–Colombia Trade Promotion

You can access complete details on each of these trade agreements at www.

In order for an importer to take advantage of the preferential duty rates
offered by free trade agreements, the following conditions must apply:
 The goods must be imported directly from the beneficiary country
(the country that has signed and is part of the agreement) into the
United States.
 The goods must be manufactured in the beneficiary country. This con-
dition is met if the goods are wholly produced or manufactured in the
country or if the goods have been substantially transformed into a new
article in the country.
For example, let’s say a company in Mexico imports absorbent gauze
from China. Upon receipt of the gauze, the Mexican company cuts the
gauze into pieces and sews the pieces into medical sponges used in the
operating room. Then the Mexican company washes, wraps, and steril-
izes the sponges. Now, even though the initial gauze came from China, it
has been redefined as a product from Mexico, and a U.S. importer of
those sponges would be able to benefit from preferential duty rates.
In order for an item to change its country of origin, the value added in
the beneficiary country needs to be 35 percent. So, in the example given,
the sponges are now a product of Mexico as long as it can be shown 
that 35 percent of their value was added during the production process
in Mexico.

Lowering manufacturing costs
Most businesses go overseas to obtain lower manufacturing costs and pro-
tect themselves from lower-priced imports being sold in their own country. 
It enables them to be competitive with other companies doing business in
their country.
There are many arguments for and against sourcing goods from overseas 
suppliers. Sourcing products from overseas may help you to:
 Reduce costs: A company can go abroad and enjoy the benefits of lower
labor and material costs.
 Access products and technologies not available domestically:
Overseas suppliers may enable you to access products that may not be
readily available from a domestic supplier.
 Provide product variety: A foreign supplier may be able to offer a
greater variety because he has lower carrying costs (lower warehousing
and storage costs), and he can keep in stock a much more extensive
product line.
 Offer better-quality products: In some instances, the perception of
many buyers is that foreign products are of a higher quality.
 Overcome domestic shortages: Having alternative sources of supply is
important, in case domestic suppliers are not able to satisfy your
requirements (for example, because of labor or equipment problems).
 Reduce dependency on a limited domestic supplier base: At times, 
the number of domestic suppliers for a particular good may be limited.
Sourcing from overseas may not only give you better prices, but also
serve as a backup and put you in a better situation when negotiating
with your domestic supplier.

Diapers: More than just doo-doo
Softee Supreme Diaper Corporation, located in
Decatur, Georgia, is a manufacturer and mar-
keter of quality disposable baby diapers. The
Commercial Service in Central America and the
Atlanta Export Assistance Center helped intro-
duce the company to potential buyers in the DR-
CAFTA region. Softee Supreme has benefited
from the tariff reductions as a result of DR-
CAFTA — the 15 percent tariff in Central America
for baby diapers was eliminated immediately for
some countries and is being phased out for the
rest. The company has reported export sales 
in 2006 of several hundred thousand dollars to
distributors in DR-CAFTA markets.

Importing is not without its risks. If you’re considering importing as a way to
lower your manufacturing costs, keep in mind the following:
 Currency exchange rates fluctuate. What may work in your favor today
because of the exchange rate may not work in your favor next year.
Remember: A weak U.S. dollar is a positive for exports, because it makes
U.S. products cheaper in foreign markets. Importers, on the other hand,
benefit from a strong U.S. dollar.
 Trade barriers (in the form of tariffs) may make importing difficult or
impossible.
25
Chapter 2: Figuring Out Your Role in the Import/Export Business
Starting from scratch: The 
entrepreneurial approach
What if you haven’t yet started a business and
you’re interested in import/export? You stand to
gain all the benefits that an existing business
gains by going global. And you don’t have to be
a huge business to make a go of importing or
exporting. According to the U.S. Department 
of Commerce, big companies make up about 4
percent of U.S. exporters, which means that 96
percent of exporters are small companies.
Still, starting a new business — any new busi-
ness — is a challenge. Throw in the complexi-
ties of international trade, and you’re in for 
an even bigger challenge. If you’re up for the
challenge, here’s what you need:
 Knowledge: In addition to finding out what
it takes to start a business, you need to be
up on everything from documentation to
shipping to communications and govern-
ment regulations. I cover all these issues in
this book. But you’ll also want to be sure to
check out other books like Small Business
For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Eric Tyson,
MBA, and Jim Schell (Wiley), and Business
Plans Kit For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by
Steven D. Peterson, PhD, Peter E. Jaret, and
Barbara Findley Schenck (Wiley).
 Enthusiasm: You need to be an enthusiastic
salesperson, someone who likes to spend
time tracking things like invoices and ship-
ping receipts. You need to get excited at the
thought of seeing where new ideas and
products will take you. And you need to
enjoy working with people from different
cultures. Your enthusiasm will carry you
through some of the challenges along the
way, so the more you have, the better.
 Consideration: Establishing a solid relation-
ship with your supplier or buyer is important
in any business, but it’s even more important
in the import/export business. Cultural differ-
ences play a huge part in buying or selling
and in establishing ongoing relationships.
The hard sell that may be effective in the
United States may not produce the same
results in foreign markets.
 Commitment: You won’t be successful in
any venture unless you’re personally com-
mitted to its success. As with most busi-
nesses, you’ll encounter peaks and valleys,
good times and bad. People who are suc-
cessful in the import/export business are
willing to work their way through the valleys.

 Goods can arrive late or damaged.
 Negotiations can fail or be delayed because of language and cultural
barriers.
Determining Your Place in the Food
Chain: Import, Export, or Both?
You know you’re ready for international trade. But do you know whether 
you want to import or export? The answer that’s right for you depends, in
large part, on why you want to go global in the first place.
Importing makes sense when
 The value of the U.S. dollar is strong — the stronger the dollar, the
cheaper it will be to purchase goods overseas.
 You’re faced with increased competition, and the only way to remain
competitive is to source goods at lower costs for suppliers overseas.
 You want to identify new products or expand you additional product
offerings.
 You can’t access products or technologies from domestic suppliers.
 Another country can produce a product more efficiently because of
available resources.
 You’re a good negotiator and enjoy selling.
Exporting makes sense when
 The value of the dollar is weak — the weaker the dollar, the cheaper
your U.S.-manufactured products will be.
 You want to increase sales and profits — rising income levels in 
many developing countries are creating opportunities for them to 
purchase goods.
 You want to serve a market that either doesn’t have, or has only limited,
production facilities.
 Your existing business wants to test a foreign market to see if a product
is accepted before you consider investing in a local production facility.
 You want to use your excess production capacity to lower per-unit 
fixed costs.
26
Part I: Breaking into the Import/Export Business 

 You want to extend your product’s life cycle by exporting to markets
that are currently not being served.
 When you enjoy selling and dealing with people from other countries
and cultures.
Being both an importer and an exporter makes sense when:
 Countries negotiate preferential trading arrangements.
 You want to remain price competitive at home — many businesses
import labor-intensive components produced in foreign countries, 
or export components for assembly in countries where labor is less
expensive and then import the finished product.
 You enjoy buying and selling, dealing with people from different 
cultures, and traveling.
 You’re comfortable dealing with the numerous uncontrollable environ-
mental forces involved in importing and exporting (see Chapter 1).
Deciding Whether to Become 
a Distributor or an Agent
After you’ve decided to get into the import/export business, you have to
decide how you want to set up your business. You have two options:
 Be a distributor (an intermediary who purchases and takes title to
the goods). For example, you purchase sweaters from a manufacturer in
Japan and import them into the United States. If you’re a distributor, you
take title to the sweaters, store them, and then look for customers, even-
tually selling them to Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s, Nordstrom, and so on.
 Be an agent (a firm that brings two parties together but does not take
title to the goods). For example, you know the sweater manufacturer in
Japan and you know that Macy’s, Bloomingdale’s, and Nordstrom are
interested in buying the sweaters. You can bring the sweater manufac-
turer and the U.S. department stores together, without ever taking title
to the goods.
In both cases, you’re involved in setting up an import/export business. The
choice that’s right for you depends on how much money you have to invest
and the amount that you hope to earn. A distributor has higher risks and
greater expenses than an agent has, but a distributor also has more control
over the process.
27
Chapter 2: Figuring Out Your Role in the Import/Export Business

If you’re working as an agent, you run the risk that, after you set up that 
initial contact, the seller (that sweater manufacturer in Japan) may go right
past you and deal directly the buyers (the U.S. department stores).
In the following sections, I explain what a distributor is, what an agent is, and
help you decide which path is right for you.
Distributor
A distributor is an independently owned business that is primarily involved
in wholesaling and takes title to the goods that are being distributed. A dis-
tributor is a middleman who handles consumer or business goods that may
be manufactured or not manufactured (such as agricultural products),
imported or exported, and then sold. Figure 2-1 illustrates the distributor’s
relationship to the seller and buyer.
Distributors typically purchase goods on their own account and resell them
at a higher price, accepting the risks and the rights that come with ownership
of the goods. For example, ABC Importing in New York imports women’s
sweaters from XYZ International in Japan. If ABC Importing is acting as a dis-
tributor, it purchases the goods from XYZ in Japan and arranges to have the
goods transported to New York and cleared through Customs. After the
goods are cleared, ABC stores the goods in its warehouse and makes arrange-
ments to sell and deliver them to its customers, including Big-Name
Department Store.
A distributor
 Is independently owned.
 Takes title to the goods being distributed. (Ownership passes from the
seller to the buyer upon purchase.)
 Is often classified by product line (such as medical, hardware, or 
electronics products).

Part I: Breaking into the Import/Export Business 

In the import/export business, there are two main types of distributors:
 Full-service distributors: A full-service distributor provides the 
following services to its customers and suppliers:
• Buying: The distributor acts as a purchasing intermediary for its
customers.
• Creating assortments: The distributor purchases goods from a
variety of suppliers and maintains an inventory that meets the
needs of its customers.
• Breaking bulk: The distributor purchases in large quantities and
resells to its customers in smaller quantities.
• Selling: The distributor provides a sales force to its suppliers.
• Storing: The distributor serves in a warehousing capacity for its
customers, delivering the goods to its customers at the customers’
request.
• Transporting: The distributor arranges for delivery of goods to its
customers.
• Financing: The distributor provides credit terms to its customers.
 Drop-shipping distributors: A drop shipper is a distributor who sells
merchandise for delivery directly from the supplier to the customer, and
does not physically handle the product. The distributor does take title to
the goods before delivery to its customer, however.
If you’re an importer and you’ve received a significant order from one of
your customers, because of the size of the order it may be more efficient
to ship the goods to the client directly from the overseas supplier. In this
case, you’re acting as a drop shipper. For example, ABC Importing in
New York receives an order for 300 dozen sweaters from its customer
Big-Name Department Store. ABC Importing purchases the sweaters
from XYZ International in Japan. The 300 dozen sweaters will be enough
product to fill a complete 20-foot shipping container. When ABC places
the order, it provides shipping instructions to XYZ International, telling
XYZ that when the goods are ready for shipment, they should be placed
into the container, invoiced to ABC Importing, and shipped directly to
Big-Name Department Store.
There are pros and cons to both situations. When you’re operating as a full-
service distributor, you have a greater level of control. On the downside, you
will have a greater level of risk and need for working capital, because of the
significant additional expenses.
If you’re concerned about the possibility of future direct contact between 
the supplier and customer, you can instruct the supplier to have the goods
packed in neutral shipping containers, have the complete shipment sent to a
shipping agent (a Customs broker), and give the shipping agent the specific
delivery instructions.

Chapter 2: Figuring Out Your Role in the Import/Export Business

Agent
An agent is similar to a distributor in that he is a middleman. However, an
agent does not take title to the goods and provides fewer services than a dis-
tributor does. The agent’s role is to get orders and (usually) earn a commis-
sion for his services. Export agents work in the country in which the product
is produced; import agents are based in the country where the product will
be sold. Figure 2-2 illustrates the relationship between the agent, the supplier,
and the buyer.
For example, CADE International is an import/export agent headquartered in
New York. CADE is aware that XYZ International is a manufacturer of quality
women’s sweaters in Japan, and that Big-Name Department Store is inter-
ested in acquiring sweaters to sell to its customers. CADE is a middleman,
bringing the seller and buyer together, but not taking title to the goods and
not providing any of the services that might be performed by a distributor.
An agent
 Is independently owned.
 Does not take title to the products being purchased and sold.
 Is actively involved in the negotiations for either the sale or purchase 
of the products.
The rate of commission, when working as an agent, depends on the nature
and type of product, the nature of the market you’re selling to, and the level
of competition. (See “Pondering Profit Potential,” later in this chapter, for
more on typical commission rates.)
In the import/export business, there are two main types of agents:
Supplier

Payment for Goods

Part I: Breaking into the Import/Export Business 

 Traditional import-export agents: An export agent works in the country
in which the product is produced. For example, you might identify a pro-
ducer in the United States and work toward representing that producer
(the seller) in foreign markets as the export agent. Or you may work as
an import agent based in the country where the product will be sold,
and in this case you represent the buyers. For example, you may know a
company in the United States that is looking to buy a certain kind of
product overseas. You would identify sellers of that product overseas
and represent the buyer in foreign markets as the import agent.
 Brokers: A broker is an independent agent who brings buyers and 
sellers together. For the most part, brokers work for sellers, although
some brokers do represent buyers. A broker differs from the traditional
import/export agent in that he does not usually represent a company.
Instead, he is traditionally hired to bring together one-of-a-kind or 
non-recurring deals.
For example, a broker is contacted and advised that Company A in New
York has an excess inventory of a soon-to-be-discontinued product. This
is a one-time deal, because as soon as the goods are purchased, they’ll
no longer be available. The broker identifies Singapore Electronics, a
potential customer in Singapore for these items. So, the broker brings
Company A and Singapore Electronics together for this one-time deal,
and, in return for his effort, the broker receives a commission from
Company A.
One of the benefits of the agent option is the reduced startup costs and the
limited working capital you need. The initial investment and costs of doing
business as an agent are significantly lower than those that come along with
operating as a distributor. On the downside, when you’re doing business as
an agent, you run the risk that the parties may bypass your firm and deal
directly on any future transactions.
To minimize the risk of being eliminated from future transactions you need to
understand that an agent is not someone who makes a call and brings people
together just to earn a commission. The key is to develop a sound relation-
ship with your connection, and continually work toward increasing sales and
improving the relationship.
If you bring a buyer from one country together with a seller from another
country, can you earn a commission from both parties? The answer is no.
Why? Because, as an agent, you’re representing someone. If you represent
the seller, you have an obligation to sell that company’s products at the high-
est possible price. On the other hand, if you’re representing the buyer, you
have an obligation to secure the products for the buyer at the lowest possible
price. Obviously, drawing a commission from both parties would create an
ethical dilemma.
31
Chapter 2: Figuring Out Your Role in the Import/Export Business

Think of it like a real estate agent. The buyer has an agent, and the seller has
an agent, but the same agent doesn’t represent both the buyer and the seller.
If you choose to set up your business working as an agent, you need to
decide who you’re going to represent and then work at nurturing that rela-
tionship. The greater the effort you make in developing that relationship and
representing the company, the more likely it’ll be to maintain the relationship
(and not want to eliminate you on future transactions).
Analyzing Start-Up Costs
Capital is the money that you’ll need to start and run your import/export
business. There are three types of capital:
 Initial/fixed capital: This is the money you use to purchase fixed (per-
manent) assets (such as office space, equipment, machinery, furniture,
and so on) and any money needed to start the business. Additionally,
you need funds to cover initial legal fees, deposits with public utility
companies, licenses, permits, office equipment, advances for rental of
premises, and so on. Finally, you need to allocate funds for your opening
promotion, which is sometimes referred to as promotional capital.
 Operating/working capital: This is your business’s temporary funds. 
It’s the money you use to support the business’s day-to-day operations,
such as salaries, office supplies, utility expenses, and so on.
 Growth/reserve capital: This is the money you need, as an existing
business, in order to expand or change the primary direction of the 
business, as well as to cover your own personal living expenses.
When you’re trying to figure out how much money you need to get started,
you need to forecast the sales volume you expect your business to reach
during your initial year of doing business. This forecast will help you deter-
mine your overall capital requirements. Make your forecast as accurate as
possible, and make sure it’s a fair appraisal of what you anticipate sales 
will actually total.
Forecasting is a projection. It isn’t a science — it’s just a guess. If you want
more information on sales forecasting, check out Excel Sales Forecasting 
For Dummies, by Conrad Carlberg (Wiley).
With your projected sales volume and any information you can secure from
trade associations and competitors (such as market potential and market fac-
tors), you can project other information, such as operating expenses, size of
32
Part I: Breaking into the Import/Export Business 

the facility required, and miscellaneous overhead expenses. Market potential
is the total sales volume that all companies can project to sell during a period
of time in an industry under normal situations. Market factors are in some way
related to demand for the product (for example, birth rate could be related to
the demand for baby cribs).
In the import/export business, your capital requirements are affected by
whether you’re an agent or a distributor. The capital requirements in being a
distributor are higher, and the profit potential would also need to be higher,
due to the higher operating expenses. On the other hand, an agent, because
he doesn’t take title to the goods, has lower operating expenses, but can
have a limit on profit potential.
Pondering Profit Potential
Profits in importing and exporting are a function of the choice between 
operating as an agent or as a distributor.
If you want to work as a distributor, your profit potential has to be higher,
because you have higher operating expenses. A full-service distributor 
has significantly more expenses than an agent — including purchasing ware-
housing, inventory, financing, transportation, and so on.
Your final profit level is based on your expenses — but as a general rule, the
gross margin as a percentage of sales will be a minimum of 40 percent. To get
the gross margin as a percentage of sales, start with this formula: sales – 
cost of goods sold = gross margin dollars. Then gross margin dollars ÷ sales =
gross margin as a percentage of sales. Say you have $250 in sales, and the
cost of goods sold was $150. That makes your gross margin $100. Take your
gross margin ($100) and divide that by your sales ($250), and you get 0.40, or
40 percent.
An agent earns a commission. Because the agent doesn’t take title to the
goods, he has lower operating expenses, but he also has a limit on profit
potential. If an item is high volume with a low unit price (such as conve-
nience goods), the rate of commission can be in the 4 percent to 5 percent
range. On the other hand, if the item has a high unit price and low volume 
of sales (such as medical equipment), that rate of commission can range
from, say, 12 percent to 15 percent. If the product falls somewhere in the
middle (something that is purchased every few years but not regularly, and
that has a moderate unit price), the commission would be between 6 percent
and 7 percent.

Rules and Regulations to Consider
before You Get Started
In This Chapter
 Determining whether you need an export license
 Reviewing export regulations
 Discovering Customs benefits available to exporters
 Identifying items that may carry import restrictions
 Getting import assistance from U.S. Customs
 Obtaining a ruling on imports
W
hether you’re looking for a way to start your own import/export 
business or you’re thinking about expanding the operations of your
existing business, this chapter is important. You need to determine whether 
a license, permit, or authorization is needed before you import a product 
into or export a product out of the United States.
Say you want to import ceramic cookie jars from China. The first question in
your mind should be, “Do I need someone’s permission or authorization to
get cookie jars from China into the country?” What about wine from Italy? 
Are the rules different for importing Italian wine? What if you want to export
adhesive bandages to Saudi Arabia?
Before you can import or export anything, you need to find out whether
you’re required to secure an authorization from someone before those items
can be shipped. In this chapter, I help you answer these questions.
For the most part, import and export rules and regulations are fairly straight-
forward. Developing an understanding of the requirements before you spend
too much time on your project is a good idea. In this chapter, I help you 
identify the applicable rules and regulations, and I also provide you with
resources where you can find answers to questions regarding your particular
product and market.

If You’re Exporting
Before you start exporting, you need to consider things like licensing and
other regulations. No one likes thinking about these technicalities, but if 
you don’t address these issues now, you’ll run into problems later. In this 
section, I fill you in on the initial issues that anyone wanting to export needs
to consider.
Export licensing
An export is any item that is sent from one country (in this case, the United
States) to a foreign destination. An item can be a commodity, computer 
software, or technology. It doesn’t matter how you transport the item to 
the other country (via ocean vessel, air cargo, mail, hand, and so on). An
export could be a set of schematics sent via fax, software uploaded or 
downloaded from a Web site, or information transmitted via e-mail. All these
items can be considered exports, and they may be subject to export licensing
requirements.
Export licensing is a basic and important first step in the exporting process.
Initially, it may appear complex and confusing, but in the vast majority of
cases it’s a very simple and straightforward process. There are only two 
categories a product can fall into:
 No license required (NLR): The vast majority of items exported from
the United States do not require a validated export license.
 Validated export license required
Violations of licensing regulations carry both civil and criminal penalties. So,
you can’t assume that your product doesn’t require an export license — you
need to do your homework. The exporter is responsible for determining that
the item to be exported is properly designated as an NLR. In the past, some
exporters have been sentenced to fines totaling more than $125,000, several
years’ probation with a period of home detention, and dozens of hours of
community service when they’ve been found guilty of exporting without a
license.
Previously, the U.S. government controlled the export and re-export of 
goods through the granting of two types of licenses (which you may still
occasionally run into):
 General license: A broad grant of authority by the government to
exporters for certain categories of products that did not require a 
formal application
36
Part I: Breaking into the Import/Export Business 

 Individually validated license (IVL): A specific grant of authority from
the government for a particular exporter to export a specific product to
a specific country
The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) in the U.S. Department of
Commerce is responsible for implementing and enforcing the Export
Administration Regulations (EAR), which regulate the export and re-export 
of the majority of commercial items. If you have any questions about these
regulations, you can contact your local Department of Commerce official for
assistance.
The starting point for these requirements is the Office of Export Services,
Outreach and Educational Services Division of the BIS (www.bis.doc.
gov). You can reach export counselors in Washington, D.C., by phone at
202-482-4811 or in California at 949-660-0144. The detailed list of regulations 
is available through the online EAR database on the Government Printing
Office Web site (www.gpo.gov/bis).
Determining whether you need a license
The percentage of items being exported requiring an export license issued 
by the BIS is very small. The United States issues export licenses for reasons
of national security, foreign policy, or short supply. In determining whether
an item requires an export license, you need to consider the questions in the
following sections.
What are you exporting?
The key in determining whether an export license is required from the
Department of Commerce for a given product is whether the item has a 
specific Export Control Classification Number (ECCN), which is simply a five-
digit, export-control classification code.
You have three options to determine whether a given item has an ECCN:
 Figure it out yourself. You can find these codes listed in the Commerce
Control List (CCL), available at www.gpo.gov/bis.
 Ask the manufacturer. The manufacturer may know whether the prod-
uct has an ECCN, if the company has exported the item in the past.
 Get an official classification from the BIS. You can make this request in
two ways:
• Use the Simplified Network Application Process Redesign (SNAP-R),
the electronic licensing system. When filing electronically, you
must obtain a personal identification number (PIN) before submit-
ting this request. You can get a PIN by visiting www.bis.doc.gov

Chapter 3: Rules and Regulations to Consider before You Get Started

What will the item you’re exporting be used for?
The items that the BIS regulates are those classified as dual-use items
because they have both commercial and military applications. So, for exam-
ple, if you exported polygraphs, arms, ammunition, gas masks, telecommuni-
cation equipment, navigational equipment, and so on, you would have to
secure a license before these goods could be exported.
The EAR also makes an allowance for commodities in short supply and
makes them subject to export licensing. These restrictions are supposed to
protect the economy in the United States from an excessive drain of scarce
materials and to reduce any inflationary impact due to satisfying foreign
demand.
As of this writing, products on this list include petroleum and petroleum
products, unprocessed western red cedar, and horses exported by sea for
slaughter. (You can find information on licensing requirements for your 
product at www.export.gov; click on “Regulations and Licenses” for
updated information on products and country restrictions.)
Where are you exporting to?
Restrictions vary from country to country and from item to item. The princi-
pal restricted destinations are embargoed countries and those designated as
supporting terrorist activities. As of this writing, the list includes Cuba, Iran,
North Korea, Sudan, and Syria.
To make sure that exports from the United States go only to legally autho-
rized destinations, the U.S. government requires a destination control 
statement on all shipping documents. The destination control statement is
important because it’s a notification to the carrier and all foreign parties that
these goods cannot be diverted to another country contrary to U.S. law.
Exporters must place the destination control statement on commercial
invoices and bills of lading for most export sales. The only exception to 
the use of this statement is shipments to Canada that are intended for 
consumption in Canada.
Violations may be subject to both criminal and administrative penalties.
Criminal penalties can reach up to ten years’ imprisonment and $1 million
per violation. Administrative penalties can reach $11,000 per violation, and
$120,000 per violation in certain cases involving national security issues.
Who will receive your item?
Certain individuals and organizations are also prohibited from receiving 
U.S. exports, and others may only receive goods if the exporter has received
a license. This may also apply to goods that do not normally require a
license. The list can be accessed from the BIS Web site (www.bis.doc.gov).
Included in this list are people engaging in the development of weapons of
mass destruction and those involved in terrorism or drug trafficking.

Applying for a license
If you determine that an export license is required for your product, the
fastest and easiest way to submit your application for a license is to use the
online SNAP-R. You can get more information on signing up to be a SNAP-R
user by visiting the SNAP-R page of the BIS Web site (https://snapr.bis.
doc.gov).
You can also take the hard-copy approach to submitting an application by
using Form BIS-748P, the Multipurpose Application Form. You can request a
copy of this form by phone at 202-482-4811, by fax at 202-482-2927, or online
at www.bis.doc.gov.
If you submit the form by mail (Express Mail or a commercial courier service
like FedEx or DHL is recommended), be sure to avoid some common errors
that may delay the processing of your application, such as:
 Forgetting to sign the application.
 Handwriting the application, instead of typing it.
 Inadequately responding to Section 21 of the application, which asks
the exporter to describe in detail the specific end use of the product. If
you aren’t specific, the application process will likely be delayed or the
application may be rejected.
 Inadequately responding to Section 22 (j) of the application, which
calls for a detailed description of the item being exported. Attach any
available additional material to fully explain the product.
You can follow up on your export license application via an automated voice
response system by contacting the BIS System for Tracking Export License
Applications (STELA) at 202-482-2752.
Other export regulations
Licensing isn’t the only regulation that you need to consider when you first
enter the world of exporting.
Anti-boycott requirements
The United States has a policy of opposing restrictive trade practices
imposed by countries against other countries friendly to the United States.
The Arab League boycott of Israel is the principal foreign economic boycott
that U.S. companies have to be concerned with today.
So what does this mean to you? You would be in violation of these laws if 
you agreed not to do business with Israel as a precondition to doing business
with another country.
39
Chapter 3: Rules and Regulations to Consider before You Get Started

The following are a few examples of boycott requests or conditions that
would be in violation of U.S. law if you agreed to the terms. (For more 
information on the export documents in question, see Chapter 15.)
 “In the case of overseas suppliers, this order is placed subject to the
suppliers not being on the Israel boycott list published by the central
Arab League.” You may see this language on a purchase order.
 “Goods of Israeli origin not acceptable.” You may see this language on
the importer’s purchase order.
 “We hereby certify that the beneficiaries, manufacturers, exporters, and
transferees of this credit are neither blacklisted nor have any connection
with Israel, and that the terms and conditions of this credit in no way
contravenes the law pertaining to the boycott of Israel and the decisions
issued by the Israel Boycott Office.” You may see this language on a
letter of credit.
These are just some examples of the kind of language that, if you agreed to
the terms, would get you in trouble.
Want a real-world example? On May 20, 1999, the Commerce Department
imposed a $5,000 civil penalty on the SABRE Group, a Texas provider of
travel-related products and services, to settle allegations that, in a 1998 con-
tract with a company in Pakistan, SABRE agreed to refuse to subcontract any
work to Israeli-based businesses or individuals. Additionally, the Commerce
Department alleged that SABRE failed to report promptly its receipt of the
request to make this agreement. SABRE voluntarily disclosed the transaction
that led to the allegations and fully cooperated with the Commerce
Department’s investigation.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
Under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), it is illegal for a U.S. com-
pany to offer, pay, or promise to pay money or anything of value to any 
foreign official for the purpose of securing or retaining business.
Here’s a case study for you: In 2007, Chiquita Brands International pled guilty
to making payments to a designated terrorist organization and agreed to pay
a $25 million fine. The plea agreement arose from payments that Chiquita had
made for years to the violent, right-wing terrorist organization United Self-
Defense Forces of Colombia — an English translation of the Spanish name of
the group, Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (commonly known as the AUC).
The AUC had been designated by the U.S. government as a Foreign Terrorist
Organization on September 10, 2001, and as a Specially-Designated Global
Terrorist on October 31, 2001. These designations made it a federal crime for
Chiquita, as a U.S. corporation, to provide money to the AUC. In April 2003,
Chiquita made a voluntary self-disclosure to the government of its payments
to the AUC, and this disclosure gave rise to the investigation.

Food and Drug Administration requirements
It is the responsibility of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
through regulations, to ensure American consumers that foods are pure and
wholesome and that drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics are safe. The FDA
requires U.S. manufacturers to go through rigorous testing and inspection.
Many countries have their own version of the FDA. If you’re exporting 
products covered by the regulations of the FDA, you must also comply with
the laws of the country to which the goods are being shipped and make 
sure that the product is properly labeled and meets the specifications of the
foreign purchaser.
Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the importer to comply with his local 
regulations; otherwise, the shipment will arrive and he won’t be able to clear
the goods through his country’s Customs organization.
Environmental Protection Agency notification requirements
The Environmental Protection Agency’s involvement in exports is limited to
hazardous waste, pesticides, and toxic chemicals. The EPA cannot prohibit
the export of these substances, but a notification process has been estab-
lished, which is designed to inform the receiving foreign government that
these materials will be entering their country.
Exporters of hazardous waste should contact either the EPA’s Office of
Compliance, Import/Export Program at 202-564-2290 or the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Hot Line at 800-424-9346 or
703-412-9810 (www.epa.gov/rcraonline/).
Customs benefits available to exporters
As an exporter, you need to be aware of the U.S. Customs benefits that are
available to you. These benefits are designed as a way of encouraging U.S.
exporters, by enabling them to be competitive in other countries without
having to include in their sales price any duties paid on imported items.
Here’s a rundown of the benefits you may be able to take advantage of:
 Drawback of Customs duties: Drawback is a form of tax reduction in
which duties collected on imported goods are refunded to the importer, 
if these goods are exported from the United States. The refund is on all
duties paid on the imported goods, less 1 percent to cover Customs
costs.
41
Chapter 3: Rules and Regulations to Consider before You Get Started

 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA): Drawback restricts the
ability of NAFTA countries to provide export incentives, such as refunds
of import duties in connection with exports to other NAFTA countries.
This restriction also impacts all other free trade agreements in place or
to be negotiated in the future.
 U.S. Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs): FTZs are sites in the United States 
that are considered outside the United States for Customs purposes. 
As long as the goods remain in the FTZ, they aren’t subject to payment of
any Customs duties. While in the zone, the goods may or may not 
be processed; after the goods leave the zone, they’re subject to duties. 
If the goods are exported out of the country, no duty payments are
required.
For a list of the contact information for each FTZ project, go to http://
ia.ita.doc.gov/FTZPAGE/letters/ftzlist.html. You can also
get information on FTZs by calling 202-482-2862 or e-mailing
ftz@ita.doc.gov.
 Foreign Free Port and Free Trade Zones: These are similar to the U.S.
Foreign Trade Zones (see the preceding bullet), but they’re located in for-
eign countries, usually in or near seaports and airports. U.S. companies
use these ports or zones for receiving shipments of goods that are
reshipped in smaller lots to customers in the surrounding areas.
 Bonded warehouses: These are public warehouses, under the supervi-
sion of the U.S. Customs Service, which are located in many different
places around the United States. Goods can be stored in them with no
assessment of duties, but after the goods are released, they’re subject to
Customs duties.
The difference between a bonded warehouse and an FTZ is that bonded
warehouses are simply used to store goods prior to exporting them,
whereas an FTZ is a place where the goods not only can be stored but
also can undergo some manufacturing process.
Bonded warehouses are privately owned. For more information on 
how they work, go to www.cbp.gov/linkhandler/cgov/toolbox/
publications/trade/bond_warehouses.ctt/bonded_20wh2.doc.
If You’re Importing
You need to be aware of licensing requirements, restrictions, prohibitions,
standards, and procedures when importing specific products. In this section,
I fill you in.
42
Part I: Breaking into the Import/Export Business 

Import licensing, restrictions, 
and prohibitions
As a general rule, the U.S. Customs Service does not require an importer to
have a license or permit to import goods into the United States. However, you
may be required to have a license, permit, or other certification, depending
on the commodity.
The importation of certain classes of merchandise may be prohibited or
restricted. These prohibitions and restrictions have been put in place by U.S.
Customs and specific government agencies (such as the Department of
Agriculture, the FDA, and so on) to protect the economy and security of the
United States, protect American consumers, and preserve plant and animal
life. Some items are also subject to quantity limits on imports (called quotas)
or trade agreements.
My editor wouldn’t let me publish this book at a thousand pages, so I don’t
have room to list each product. But in the following list, I provide various
classes of articles for which you need a license or permit from the responsi-
ble agency. You can find the name of the agency by talking to the commodity
specialist teams (see the “Getting import help from commodity specialist
teams” section, later in the chapter).

A diamond may not be a girl’s best friend
Conflict diamonds are rough diamonds sold by
rebel groups in Africa or their allies for the spe-
cific purpose of financing uprisings against legit-
imate, internationally recognized governments.
Rebel, military, and terrorist groups in parts of
Africa have used conflict diamonds to finance
unlawful insurrections against legitimate gov-
ernments. Conflict diamonds are so called
because of the atrocities committed on civilian
populations during these insurrections. The
United States played a key role in forging 
an international consensus to curb this 
trade and has, therefore, strongly supported
the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme
(KPCS), which is an international initiative
aimed at breaking the link between the legiti-
mate diamond trade and trade in conflict dia-
monds by documenting and tracking all rough
diamonds that enter participating KPCS coun-
tries and by shipping them in tamper-resistant
containers.
Conflict diamonds were the primary story 
line behind the movie Blood Diamond (2006),
starring Leonardo DiCaprio.

Part I: Breaking into the Import/Export Business 

Even if restrictions and prohibitions are not in place, products such as tex-
tiles, clothing, automobiles, boats, radios, television sets, and medical
devices are subject to special standards, declarations, certification, marking,
or labeling requirements. Additionally, merchandise can be inspected for fit-
ness of use or freedom from contamination, and items can be subject to
quotas. (For more information, turn to Chapter 16.)
Getting import help from commodity 
specialist teams
U.S. Customs has groups of import specialists who can help you get started
in importing. Import specialists are organized according to commodity spe-
cialist teams, which are assigned specific types of goods and are available to
respond to any question you may have about U.S. importing rules and regula-
tions. Import specialists provide information about proper classification of
goods for the purpose of charging duties, as well as information regarding
specific agency permits, licenses, or certifications. Table 3-1 lists each com-
modity specialist team and its corresponding types of goods.

up with commodity specialists assigned for each group. (Appendix B has 
contact information for each district Customs office.)
Say you’re interested in importing seafood from Thailand. Looking at this list,
you would contact team 201. If you want to import paper clips from South
Korea, you might look through the list and say to yourself, “Great, there’s no
team for paper clips or office supplies.” If you can’t find your item specifically
on the list, determine what the primary component of the item is. So, if your
46
Part I: Breaking into the Import/Export Business 

paper clips are made of steel, you would contact team 227, which handles
articles of iron or steel. On the other hand, if it’s a plastic paper clip, you
would contact team 212, because it handles plastic and rubber products.
When talking to the commodity specialist team, be sure to provide it with the
complete product description and the country where the goods are coming
from. This information is important, because the same product coming from
two different countries can have different rates of duty and different rules
and regulations.
Figuring out the tariff classification 
of your imports
When goods arrive at the port, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) makes
its decision as to the dutiable status of the merchandise — the appropriate
tariff classification code, as found in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule for the
United States (HTSUS). The HTSUS is the primary resource for determining
duty classifications. You can use the HTSUS to determine the appropriate
tariff classification number, Customs duty (tariff), and any applicable rules 
or regulations for the item you’re importing.
Most importers want to know the dutiable status of their products before
they arrive at the port. You have two options for finding this information —
informal tariff classifications and binding decisions. I cover these options 
in the following sections.
Informal tariff classifications
Every item entering the United States has been assigned a tariff classification
number, which is the basis for all decisions relating to that item. You can
identify the tariff classification number of your product by
 Discussing the product with a commodity specialist: See the “Getting
import help from commodity specialist teams” section, earlier in 
this chapter.
 Accessing the HTSUS: You can find the HTSUS online at www.usitc.
gov/tata/hts/bychapter/index.htm.
 Contacting the port director where your merchandise will be entered.
 Writing to U.S. Customs and Border Protection: The address is
Director, National Commodity Specialist Division, U.S. Customs and
Border Protection, 1 Penn Plaza, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10119.
The information provided by any of these methods is informal and not 
binding.
47
Chapter 3: Rules and Regulations to Consider before You Get Started

Binding decisions
A binding ruling enables you to get binding pre-entry classification decisions
prior to importing a product and filing entries with CBP. A binding ruling also
allows you to get binding guidance about other CBP regulations pertaining to
marking the country of origin.
Binding classification advice can only be given by the Office of Regulations
and Rulings. Here’s how it works: You submit a letter to Director, National
Commodity Specialist Division, U.S. Customs and Border Protection,
Attention: CIE/Ruling Request, 1 Penn Plaza, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10119.
And you generally get a response within 30 days.
The following information is required in ruling requests:
 The names, addresses, and other identifying information of all 
interested parties
 The name(s) of the port(s) at which the merchandise will be entered
 A description of the transaction (for example, “A prospective importa-
tion of paper clips from South Korea”)
 A statement that there are, to your knowledge, no issues on the 
commodity pending before CBP or any court
 A statement as to whether you’ve previously sought classification
advice from a CBP officer, and if so, from whom, and what advice 
was rendered, if any
A request for a tariff classification should include the following information:
 A complete description of the goods: Send samples, if practical,
sketches, diagrams, or other illustrative materials that will be useful in
supplementing the written description.
 Cost breakdowns of component materials and their respective quanti-
ties shown in percentages, if possible.
 A description of the principal use of the goods, as a class or kind of
merchandise, in the United States.
 Information about commercial, scientific, or common designations, 
as may be applicable.
 Any other information that may be pertinent or required for the 
purpose of tariff classification.
Tariff classifications are binding, but duty rates are not. The program pro-
motes compliance, uniformity, and accuracy, and you can rely on it when
placing or accepting orders or for making any other business-related 
decisions.

A
fter you decide to start your import/export business, one of the first
things you have to do is decide on a name and a form of ownership.
Choosing the form ownership is important because it affects you and how
your business will operate. There is no single best form of ownership — in
order to pick the right form for you, you need to understand the characteris-
tics of each.
In this chapter, I also fill you in on the appropriate state or local agencies that
you need to contact to register your business. I end the chapter with a review
of your options when it comes to where your office will be located, its mailing
address, telephone, e-mail address, fax number, and Web site.
Selecting a Company Name
One of the first decisions you’ll make (and one that you can have a little 
fun with) is finding the right name for your business. When you’re starting a

business, it’s a little bit like having a baby: It’s something brand new that
developed from your own idea, and as it gets established it’ll begin to
develop its own identity (by having its own bank account, phone number,
e-mail address, and so on).
You’ll probably spend a lot of time deliberating over potential names for your
business. Choosing a name is one of the more challenging aspects of starting
your new import/export business — and you have to do it without the help of
all those name books that new parents have.
Your company name will serve as your initial identification to your cus-
tomers. If you don’t have a business name, you come across as inexperienced
and unreliable. No matter what you name your business (no matter how good
or bad the name is), the name has been established, you are a company, and
people will be more interested in dealing with you. That said, you want to
choose a name that has some kind of meaning to you and that projects the
right image to your customers.
When deciding on a business name, focus on the product or service that
you’ll be selling and your intended customer. You may want to include words
like international, trading, import, export, or global in your name.
The name you choose automatically becomes a tool you can use in marketing
your business, so make sure to land on a name that will help you in your 
marketing efforts. On the other hand, you may want to wait to finalize your
business name if you tend to direct your efforts and deal with a specific 
product or category of products (see Chapter 5) — including a product 
in your name may tie your hands and work against you as your business
grows.
When you’re thinking about names, be sure to check phone books and do an
Internet search to see if any other businesses are using a name similar to the
one you’re considering. Finding another company using the same name in a
similar business may create problems if you want to register or trademark
your company name.
Here are some of the desirable characteristics for an effective company
name:
 The name should suggest something about the company, its products,
or services.
 The name should be easy to spell and pronounce. Your customers
should be able to remember it and spell it correctly.
50
Part I: Breaking into the Import/Export Business 

 The name should be capable of registration. What’s the point of start-
ing any company or marketing campaign if you can’t have full rights in
the name? Your best defense is a registered trademark (designed by ® in
the name), which only can be issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office (USPTO). The USPTO won’t issue a registration certificate if it
judges the name to be generic, or if someone else is already using the
name. Be sure to trademark your business name through the USPTO 
and registering it through the secretary of state where your business 
is located.
If your business operates on the Internet, be aware that domain names
are not registered through state or local governments. Just registering
your domain name (such as mybusinessname.com) is not enough to 
protect your great business name. (For more on domain names, see
“Registering your domain name,” later in this chapter.)
Choosing a Form of Organization
Every business owner must choose a form of organization for her business.
The owner has three basic choices — sole proprietorship, partnership, or
corporation — together with two other slightly modified alternatives: the 
S corporation and a limited liability company.
Each option has certain advantages and disadvantages. Prior to choosing a
form of organization, ask yourself the following questions:
 How much revenue do you anticipate that this business will generate?
 How much money will you need to invest? What are the startup and
future capital requirements?
 Are you lacking any skills or experience in the operations of the 
business?
 Are you willing to share your ideas and profits with others?
 What are the tax implications for the various organization options? What
do you envision as projected earnings?
 Do you have other sources of income?
 In the event of failure, to what extent will you want to be personally
liable for the debts of the business?
Jot down your answers to these questions and refer back to them as you read
this section.
51
Chapter 4: Organizing for Import and Export Operations

Sole proprietorship
The sole proprietorship is the simplest of the three primary forms of organi-
zation and the form used by the majority of new businesses. There are 
usually no setup costs if you decide to do business under your own name.
If you want to operate your business under a trade name, you need to 
register with the local county clerk office in your state of residence. The
requirements differ from one place to the next, but most counties require 
you to complete and file a business certificate form, which can also be
referred to as a certificate of doing business under an assumed name (or just
a DBA for short).
Pros
Here are some of the advantages to a sole proprietorship:
 A sole proprietorship is simple and easy to create. If you choose to
operate under your own or an assumed name, all you need to do is com-
plete a form similar to the one shown in Figure 4-1. (Note: Each county
has its own form, and you can get the form you need from your county
clerk’s office.) You have to sign the form and get it notarized; then it has
to be certified by the office of the county clerk. You can do all this in 
one day.
 A sole proprietorship is the least costly form of ownership. You don’t
have to create or file any legal documents, as may be required with 
corporations. You just have to complete the form, visit the local office 
of the county clerk, and pay a nominal fee, which can range from $35 to
$125, depending on where you live.
 A sole proprietorship has a profit and tax incentive. After all expenses,
you get to keep all the remaining profits. You report the net income on
Schedule C of IRS Form 1040, and the income is then taxed at your per-
sonal tax rate. This form of organization does not require the business 
to pay any separate taxes. Because you’re self employed, this income is
also subject to the self-employment tax, which currently is 15.3 percent.
 A sole proprietor has decision-making authority. Because you’re the
sole owner, you have complete control over any decision, giving you 
the ability to respond immediately to any changes.
 There are no special government regulations regarding sole propri-
etorships. A sole proprietorship is the least regulated form of business
organization, but it does have to follow all the laws that may apply 
to the business.
 A sole proprietorship can easily be dissolved. You don’t need the
approval of co-owners or partners. However, you’re still personally
liable for any outstanding debts that haven’t been paid by the business.

Cons
Here are the disadvantages of a sole proprietorship:
 Sole proprietors face unlimited personal liability. There is no separation
between personal and business assets. The company’s debts are your
debts. A creditor can force the sale of your personal assets — such as
your house or car or other assets — to recover any unpaid or outstanding
debt. This is the primary disadvantage of this form of organization.
 A sole proprietorship is limited to whatever capital you’ve contributed
or whatever you’ve personally borrowed. A sole proprietorship may
find it difficult to obtain additional funding because of lack of collateral.
And it pays higher interest rates because it’s a greater risk than a corpo-
ration is.
 The sole proprietor may lack the complete range of skills that would
be required in running a successful business. You must be able to 
perform a wide variety of functions in areas such as management, mar-
keting, finance, accounting, and human resources. If you can’t do all this
yourself, you’ll need to hire employees to do it for you.
 If you die or become incapacitated, the business will cease to exist.
Partnership
If you can’t come up with enough money to make your new business a suc-
cess, or if you lack some of the skills needed, you should consider a partner-
ship. A partnership is an association of two or more persons engaging in a
profit-making business as co-owners.
A partnership is similar in many respects to a sole proprietorship — with the
exception of sharing responsibilities and profits.
Although there is no legal requirement for a formal partnership agreement, 
it is in the best interest of all partners to have an attorney develop one that
clearly details the status and responsibilities of each partner. A standard
partnership agreement should include the following:
 The name of the partnership
 The purpose of the business
 The domicile of the business (where the business will be located)
 The duration of the partnership (how long the agreement will be 
in effect)
 Names of all partners and their legal addresses
 Performance requirements of the partners (a statement of each 
partner’s individual management role and duty)
54
Part I: Breaking into the Import/Export Business 

 Contributions of each partner to the business: This includes each 
partner’s investment in the business. You may also want to include 
contributions such as experience and sales contact.
 An agreement as to how the profits or losses of the partnership will 
be distributed
 An agreement on the salaries or drawing rights against profits for
each partner (how much money each partner will take from the 
business as a salary)
 An agreement as to how the partnership might expand, through the
addition of a new partner
 How the assets of the partnership will be distributed if the partners
agree to dissolve the partnership
 What steps would be required if a partner wanted to sell his interest
in the partnership
 What happens if one of the partners is absent or disabled
 What procedures will be necessary to alter or modify the partnership
agreement
In a partnership, a person can be classified as either a general partner or a
limited partner. Each partnership agreement must have at least one general
partner, who has unlimited personal liability and plays an active role in the
management of the business. A limited partner, on the other hand, has lim-
ited liability and can only lose the amount of money she has invested. There
is no restriction as to the number of limited partners, but they cannot play 
an active role in the management of the business.
Pros
Here are the advantages of a partnership:
 A partnership is easy to establish. Similar to a sole proprietorship, a
partnership is easy and inexpensive to establish. In most states, the
owner must file a business certificate for partners (similar to the one
shown in Figure 4-2) with the local authorities and obtain any necessary
business licenses.
 In a successful partnership, the skills and abilities of each partner 
will usually complement each other, making for a much stronger 
organization.
 A partnership has access to a larger base of capital and credit. Each
partner’s assets increase the available pool of capital, and the ability to
borrow funds is enhanced.
 A partnership is flexible. Although not as flexible as a sole proprietor-
ship, partners can generally react quickly to changes.
55
Chapter 4: Organizing for Import and Export Operations

 A partnership comes with certain tax incentives. The partnership itself
is not subject to federal taxation. Similar to a proprietorship, the profits
or losses that a partnership earns or incurs are personal income, and
taxes are paid on their personal tax rates. Each partner must be pro-
vided with a Schedule K-1 from the partnership, showing her share of
the income or losses. Note: Partners are required to pay taxes on the
share, even if none of that income is distributed to them.
BUSINESS CERTIFICATE FOR PARTNERS
Pursuant to General Business Law § 130, the undersigned do hereby certify that they 
intend to or are conducting or transacting business as members of a partnership in the

Part I: Breaking into the Import/Export Business 

Cons
Here are the disadvantages of a partnership:
 At least one partner faces unlimited liability. Every partnership must
have at least one general partner and, similar to a sole proprietor, a 
general partner has unlimited personal liability for the debts of the busi-
ness. In addition, a general partner’s liability is joint and several, which
means that creditors can hold all general partners equally responsible
for the partnership’s debts, or they can collect the entire debt from just
one partner. This disadvantage is eliminated for the limited partner,
because his liability is limited to the amount of money he has invested 
in the business.
 A partnership is terminated when a partner dies or withdraws from
the agreement. The sale of a partnership interest has the same effect 
as the death or withdrawal of a partner. Usually it’s difficult to come up
with a fair value for the business that everyone can agree on, but it’s
easier if the partnership agreement specifies a method of valuation.
 In a partnership, the partners may have personality conflicts that
affect the success of the partnership. Even if you’re best friends 
when you start the partnership, that may change as you work together.
Conflicts between partners can be the undoing of an otherwise 
successful venture.
Corporations
The third form of business ownership is the corporation. A corporation
exists as a separate entity apart from the owners and may engage in busi-
ness, make contracts, and sue and be sued. The corporation pays its own
taxes. Incorporation involves the filing of a charter or a certificate of incorpo-
ration with the secretary of state in the state where you want to transact
business and where the principal office of the business is located, as well as
payment of a fee.
A corporation can be publicly or privately owned. A public corporation is
one whose stock is openly traded on public stock exchanges, and anyone can
buy or sell shares of stock he owns in the company. A private corporation is
owned by one or a few people who are actively involved in managing the
company.
For more information on what’s required to incorporate in the state where
you want to do business, go to www.statelocalgov.net/50states-
secretary-state.cfm and select the state. You’ll find links to business
organizations and be able to find all the steps required to incorporate your
business.

Chapter 4: Organizing for Import and Export Operations

Typically, businesses hire an attorney when filing to form a corporation.
However, several businesses online will process the paperwork necessary to
form a corporation. Two worth looking at are
 The Company Corporation, 2711 Centerville Rd., Suite 400, Wilmington,
DE 19808 (phone: 800-818-0204; Web: www.corporate.com)
 My Corporation Business Services, Inc., 27520 Agoura Rd., Calabasas,
CA 91302 (phone: 888-692-9560; Web: www.mycorporation.com)
For more information on corporations, check out Incorporating Your Business
For Dummies, by The Company Corporation (Wiley).
Pros
The advantages to a corporation include the following:
 Liability is limited. Because a corporation exists as a separate entity,
there is a distinct separation of the business assets and the personal
assets of the shareholders. If the business fails, the stockholders are not
personally responsible for the debts of the firm; their liability is limited
to the amount of their initial investment.
 Transfer of ownership is easy. Ownership changes hands when stock-
holders sell or trade shares of stock.
 A corporation can continue indefinitely. The existence of the 
corporation doesn’t depend on the fate of any one individual. Unlike a
proprietorship or partnership, which ceases to exist on the death or
withdrawal of an owner, a corporation has perpetual life.
Cons
Here are the disadvantages to a corporation:
 The process of incorporation involves time and money. Plus, maintain-
ing a corporation can be costly and time consuming. Incorporating can
require a variety of fees that are not applicable when forming a sole pro-
prietorship or partnership. Corporations are chartered by the state; the
registration process is the responsibility of the office of the secretary of
state, and fees can vary from one state to the next.
 Because a corporation is a separate legal entity, it is responsible for
paying federal taxes, and possibly state and local taxes, on its net
income. These taxes are due on the amount of income even before any
distribution of dividends. Earnings distributed to shareholders in the
form of dividends are then also subject to taxation. In other words, the
income of the business is taxed, and then the dividend is distributed to
the shareholders; shareholders need to report their dividends as income
on their personal taxes. So, the profits of the business are taxed twice.
58
Part I: Breaking into the Import/Export Business 

 Corporations are subject to more legal, reporting, and financial
requirements than either a sole proprietorship or a partnership.
 When shares of stock are sold in a corporation, the owners give up
some control.
S corporations
An S corporation is a special form of corporation that allows the earnings 
of the corporation to be taxes only as individual income rather than as the
corporation itself. Additionally, it also preserves the right of the owners to
enjoy the advantage of limited liability.
A corporation can elect to be an S corporation under the following conditions:
 It must be a domestic corporation with only one class of stock, which
means that all shares must share the same rights (dividends).
 It can have no more than 100 shareholders.
 It cannot have a nonresident alien as a shareholder.
 It must be eligible for S status for the entire year.
 All shareholders must give the approval to the firm’s choice of 
S corporation status.
 It must file a Form 2553 (Election of Small Business Corporation) with
the IRS within the first 75 days of the corporation’s fiscal year, if the 
corporation wants to make the election of S status effective for the 
current tax year.
The majority of these restrictions are not likely to be a concern for most
small businesses, many of which have five or fewer individual shareholders.
It should be noted that S corporation earnings are not subject to the self-
employment tax requirement of sole proprietorships or partnerships.
One potential problem with an S corporation is the way that profits and
losses are allocated among owners for income-tax purposes. The IRS states
that shareholders in an S corporation must pay taxes on profits in proportion
to their stock ownership. So if you have five shareholders, each of whom
holds 20 percent of the corporation, each shareholder must pay taxes on 20
percent of the corporation’s profits.
Limited liability companies
A limited liability company (LLC) brings together two benefits that can be
valuable to many business owners:
59
Chapter 4: Organizing for Import and Export Operations

 Limited liability: The members of an LLC enjoy the same limits on their
personal liability as a corporate shareholder does (see “Corporations,”
earlier in this chapter). They aren’t personally liable for the company’s
debts.
 Pass-through taxation: The business entity itself pays no federal income
tax. Instead, just like a partnership or sole proprietorship, each member
of an LLC simply pays tax on his share of the profits or uses his share of
losses to offset other income.
An LLC is very similar to an S corporation. The significant advantage of the
LLC is flexibility. An LLC permits its members to divide income (or losses) 
as they see fit, and the allocations don’t have to be based on percentages of
ownership as they are with an S corporation.
For more information on limited liability companies, check out Limited
Liability Companies For Dummies, by Jennifer Reuting (Wiley).
Setting Up Your Business
Setting up a business involves all kinds of little details that are easy to over-
look. In this section, I cover everything you need to think about in the early
days of your business, from registering it to setting up a phone line and more.
Registering your business
Depending on the type of business you operate, you need to take one or two
steps for your business to be properly registered in most states:
1. If your business is a legal entity such as a corporation, limited part-
nership, or limited liability company, you must file formation or
authorization documents for the public record.
General partnerships and sole proprietors are not subject to this step.
2. You must register for tax purposes.
To find the specific requirements in your state, go to www.statelocalgov.
net/50states-secretary-state.cfm and click on the link for your state.
Opening a bank account
During the startup process, be sure to open a business checking account.
When you’re initiating your discussion with potential suppliers and 
60
Part I: Breaking into the Import/Export Business 

customers, you’ll need to pay by check, and it’s far more professional if 
these transactions are completed using a company check rather than your
personal checks with the cute little kittens or pretty sunsets on them.
Selecting an office location
When you’re starting a business, you need to choose a location. Most 
entrepreneurs initially look at starting a business from home. The cost of 
setting up a separate office can be far too costly, and the home-based option
is a good alternative. Just be sure to look at your local community zoning
requirements — depending on where you live and the kind of business you’re
running, you may not be able to operate your business out of your home.
If you decide to use your home, remember that you need to use it mostly 
for the administrative aspects of your business, and that if you choose the
distributor approach (see Chapter 2), you need to arrange for outside 
warehousing or storage facilities.
As you begin the process of forming your own import/export business, you
need to consider what address you’re going to put on your letterhead, busi-
ness card, and so on. You may not be able to spend the money to rent an
office, using a post office box can seem unprofessional, and you may be 
hesitant about using your own home address. Another option is to consider
getting a mailbox at a UPS Store. The benefits of mailbox services at a UPS
Store include
 A street address (not a post office box), which provides a professional
image for your business
 The ability to pick up your mail when it’s convenient for you
 Someone to accept packages from all carriers and advise you of arrival,
so you don’t have to be home to sign for it
 Someone to hold your packages in a secure location for pickup at your
convenience or forward them to you, wherever you are
You can access information about this service from the UPS Store at www.
upsstore.com/products/maiandpos.html. To find the UPS Store nearest
you, go to http://go.mappoint.net/ups/PrxInput.aspx.
Getting connected
Communication is important in any business. You need to be able to interact
with potential suppliers and customers at all times. In my early days in
61
Chapter 4: Organizing for Import and Export Operations

importing and exporting, almost all communication was done using a telex
machine, which involved underwater cables. Today the process is easier, 
and far more effective and efficient.
Telephone
When you’re setting up your business, you need to create a sense of profes-
sionalism. Even during your early stages as you begin to explore ideas,
search for product ideas, conduct market research, contact potential suppli-
ers, and interact with prospective customers, you need to have a phone line
that is separate and apart from your personal home number — even if you’re
running a home-based business.
When someone contacts you about your business, you need to be able to
answer the phone in a professional manner — you don’t want your 8-year-old
picking it up, his mouth full of Oreos.
If you don’t want to pay for an entirely new phone line, get a cellphone that
you use only for business purposes or use the distinctive ringing service 
provided by many telephone companies. In the latter, you have one phone
line, but the phone company provides you with two phone numbers, each 
of which has a different ringing pattern so you can tell which phone line is
ringing before you answer the call.
Internet and e-mail
Access to the Internet is a must. In the past, many home users were able to
accomplish this through a dial-up service through an Internet service
provider (ISP). Today, though, dial-up is virtually obsolete, especially when
you’re relying on the Internet to do research or conduct business. What you
need is high-speed Internet access — either in the form of DSL (which runs
through your phone line) or cable (which runs through the same kind of con-
nection as your cable TV). Both of these options are available through
numerous ISPs, and which one you get really depends on what’s available in
your area and what the ISP charges. Check your local Yellow Pages under
Internet Service Providers and see what options are available in your area.
After you have Internet access, set up an e-mail account. At a minimum, 
you should set up an account with a free service like Yahoo! Mail (http://
mail.yahoo.com), Hotmail (www.hotmail.com), or Gmail (http://mail.
google.com). The form for the address could look like this business
name@yahoo.com. Another option is to set up an e-mail account through
your company’s Web site (see the following section); the advantage of this is
that your e-mail address looks more professional: yourname@business
name.com, sales@businessname.com, and so on.
In every e-mail you send, be sure to include your name, title, company name,
mailing address, and phone number.

Part I: Breaking into the Import/Export Business 

Opting for a Web Site
When you’re deciding whether to set up a company Web site, you need to
look at the cost of setting up the site and the benefits you’ll gain from the
site, and then ask yourself whether that’s the best use of your financial
resources.
Web pages, like almost all promotional materials are designed to communi-
cate some specific message to a target audience. In this case, the target 
audiences would be either prospective suppliers or customers.
You may want to use the Web site to inform potential suppliers about your
business operations. These can be suppliers in the United States for goods
you want to export, or suppliers from other countries for goods that you
want to import into the United States. You can use the site as a marketing
tool, giving prospective suppliers the information they need to decide if 
they want to work with you.
The Web site can also be used to inform, persuade, influence, or remind 
your customers about your firm and the products that you’re offering. Is the
site going to be a tool for communication or an electronic brochure? Do you
want to sell products through the site, or just to educate them about your
products?
You can use the site to sell or promote your services as either an export man-
agement company (see Chapter 1) or an import buying office, assisting busi-
ness with limited resources in connecting with suppliers in other countries.
Plus, you can use the site to sell or promote a specific product to your target
market (see Chapter 8).
In the following sections, I cover the basic issues you need to consider when
opting for a Web site.
Planning for the kind of site you want
Before you hire a Web designer, you need to know why you want a Web site
and what your site will look like. A well-designed site takes your visitors
where you want them to go, and eventually convinces them to do business
with you. Think about the following:
 What is the purpose of the site? To make a sale? To inform someone
about your business?
 What information will you provide to gain visitors’ attention? The
information provided must be something that they want, and it must be
provided in a manner that’s easy for them to follow.
63
Chapter 4: Organizing for Import and Export Operations

 What is the message of the site? You may want to show the visitor that
you have the experience and knowledge to be able to sell or represent
his products. Or you may want to show off a product or service that
you’re trying to sell.
 Who are you attempting to reach with your message? You have to
know your target audience so that you can design the site to meet 
their needs.
Registering your domain name
Your domain name is your address on the Internet. For example, this book’s
publisher, Wiley, has the domain name wiley.com, and the For Dummies
series is at dummies.com — both of those are domain names.
Put as much time and effort into coming up with your domain name as you
put into coming up with your business name. Keep it short. It needs to be
something people can remember and won’t mind typing in. For example, the
publisher of this book registered wiley.com, not johnwileyandsons
incorporated.com.
After you find the domain name that you like, you need to register it so that
no one else can use it. You can check the availability of a particular domain
name by visiting www.checkdomain.com.
Finding a Web host
In order to publish a Web site online, you need a Web host. The Web host
stores all the pages of your Web site and makes them available to computers
connected to the Internet. In other words, it keeps your Web site up and 
running.
When you register your domain name at one of the myriad domain name reg-
istrars out there — including places like Register.com (www.register.com)
and Network Solutions (www.networksolutions.com) — you’ll likely be
given the option to sign up for Web hosting as well. You’ll usually have to pay
a monthly fee that varies depending on how much disk space and bandwidth
your site uses. Ongoing hosting fees can range from $30 to $100 per month. If
you pay by the year instead of by the month, you can often get a discount.
Make sure the Web host you choose offers technical support and has little or
no downtime.
64
Part I: Breaking into the Import/Export Business 

Considering content
The most obvious — and oftentimes most overlooked — component of a suc-
cessful Web site is its content. You want visitors to your site to get the maxi-
mum amount of information, in as little time as possible. To do this, you need
to make sure that all the content on your site is relevant, adds value to your
site, and attracts visitors. The content needs to be consistent and credible.
At the same time, you want to avoid communications overload — transmit-
ting too much information.
Because you may be dealing with visitors to your site from other countries,
pay special attention to semantics (the different meanings of words) and eti-
quette. Check out www.cyborlink.com for more on international business
etiquette and manners, and information on the do’s and don’ts of greetings,
introduction, conversational, and communication guidelines for countries
around the world.
Working on Web design
You need to make your site appealing and easy to find. The design issues
include the look and feel of the site, how the information is presented, and
how the site visitors will navigate their way around the site. Web design
includes things like the colors used, the style of the text, the size and location
of graphics, and so on.
Here’s a list of Web site design resources:
 Communication Arts (www.commarts.com): Identifies design trends
and teaches what does and does not work on the Internet
 Cool Home Pages (www.coolhomepages.com): Provides links to some
of the better designed Web sites on the Internet by category
 Page Resources (www.pageresource.com): A Web development and
tutorial site
 Web Pages That Suck (www.webpagesthatsuck.com): Provides 
examples of well-designed and poorly designed Web sites
 Web Style Guide (www.webstyleguide.com): Offers suggestions
related to Web page design, page layout, site organization, navigation,
and content
If you have the skills, time, expertise, and desire to design and develop your
own site, go for it. But if you don’t know enough about Web design to make
your site look professionally done, hire a professional. Having a poorly
designed Web site can be worse than having no Web site at all.
65
Chapter 4: Organizing for Import and Export Operations

Be sure to find someone whose other Web sites you like — and look at sev-
eral examples of the person’s work. Contact the people whose sites she’s 
created and ask what it was like to work with the designer. Some designers
are creative geniuses, but they’re not great at meeting deadlines — if time
matters to you, you want someone who can do it all.
Promoting your site
A successful business uses every opportunity to reach out to its market and
promote its Web site. Contact old clients and reach out to new ones, telling
them about your new site. You can also use direct mail, postcards, e-mail, 
and so on.
Be sure to talk to your Web designer about site optimization (setting up your
site so that the most people find it). Designers can use keywords and other
tools to make sure people find you online.

Selecting Products
and Suppliers

In this part . . .
I
n this part, I cover the products you can deal in and how
to find and negotiate with suppliers. I start by explaining
why any initial movement into the import/export business
requires a focus on a specific product category, and that
the more product-focused you are, the more likely you’ll 
be to succeed.
I also show you how to use various Web sites, periodicals,
and foreign trade offices to identify suppliers from other
countries for goods that can be imported into the United
States. I show you how to use online and library resources
to identify firms in the United States for products that you
may want to export.
I explain how to approach a supplier with your proposal,
and provide you with a checklist covering the key points
of agreement to be included when negotiating a purchase
contract.

Chapter 5
Selecting the Right Products
In This Chapter
 Understanding the importance of choosing the right product
 Determining which product you’ll deal in
 Assessing a product’s potential in the marketplace
Your business exists to 1) satisfy customers while 2) making a profit, and
the product that you choose to import or export has to fulfill this dual
purpose. Choosing the right product is critical to your success.
In this chapter, I fill you in on the keys to selecting the right product. Two
paths diverge in the woods: One leads toward being a generalist, and the
other leads toward being a specialist. Which path is your best bet? I tell you
the answer and explain why. I also give you three criteria that need to be met
with whatever product you’re thinking about selling.
Choosing Whether to Be a 
Generalist or a Specialist
The number of products that can be imported into or exported from the
United States is seemingly infinite. The key to success is to identify your
niche or area of specialization. Most individuals starting an import/export
business stand a better chance of succeeding if they specialize in a 
particular area instead of trying to make it as a generalist.
Say you’re interested in being an exporter, and you have a contact in another
country. You call the contact and say one of the following. Which will give
you the best results?
 I’m the owner of ABC International, an export management company. 
If you tell me what you want, I can arrange to get it.

 I’m the owner of ABC International, an export management company
that works with a variety of manufacturers of disposable medical 
supplies. If you’re interested, I should be able to find products of 
interest for you.
The second statement is the one that’ll help you reap the greatest rewards
(in the form of customers). The more specific you can be about what 
you want to sell, the greater your odds of clearly communicating to your 
customers and making a sale.
Introducing the Three E’s 
of Product Selection
When you’re selecting a product, you need to be personally and emotionally
committed to its success. Begin the selection process by asking yourself the
following questions:
 Do you like the product that you’re planning to offer for sale? If you
don’t like it, you’ll have a hard time selling it.
 Can you see yourself getting excited about it? Sometimes you choose a
product based on data, but you can tell that it’s something you’ll get
excited about. If you can’t see yourself getting jazzed about the product,
move on to another one.
 Would you buy and use it yourself? If you wouldn’t buy and use the
product, what makes you think other people will buy and use it?
 Would you sell this product to an immediate family member or
friend? If you don’t think the product is good enough for your family
and friends, it’s not good enough for your customers either.
 Who would you be selling this product to? Who would be your target
market? If you can’t identify your target market for this product, you
need to go back to the drawing board.
 Is there a real need for the product in today’s market? If the market
doesn’t need the product, you don’t want to be selling it.
 What are the product’s advantages and disadvantages as compared to
similar product in the market? No product is perfect. Even if you’re
excited about the product, you need to be honest with yourself about its
pros and cons so you can properly position it in the marketplace.
After you’ve answered these preliminary questions, you’re ready to look at
the three E’s of product selection: experience, education, and enthusiasm.
The three E’s will help you narrow that infinite set of product options to a
much more manageable list, and eventually to a successful business venture.
I cover the three E’s in the following sections.
70
Part II: Selecting Products and Suppliers 

Experience
The key to being successful with a product is having experience with that
product. The more you know about the product, the greater the chances 
that you’ll be successful.
When I left the corporate setting and decided to form my own import/export
trading company, I decided to focus initially on health and beauty aids and
disposable medical supplies. I made this choice because of my experience 
in the industry. (I had just spent ten years working in that area, and it was
something that I knew a lot about.)
You have an infinite number of product choices. Start by reviewing your 
own background. Look for areas in which you may have some specific 
experience — this experience can come from your employment background,
a family contact in another country, or simply a hobby.
The key when trying to introduce a product into a market is knowledge, and
experience is that link that will provide you with the knowledge that you
need to be successful.
Education
Many people fail because they think they know it all. There will always be
new things to learn, and the sooner you learn that, the more successful you’ll
be. Product knowledge is important, and education is the key to gaining that
knowledge. Use education to expand and develop your base of experience.
Reading this book is a good place to start, but don’t stop here. Take business
classes, visit the country you’re interested in exporting to or importing from,
meet with your prospective customers — you can never have too much edu-
cation or too much information about your product and your business.
Enthusiasm
You must enjoy selling your product. If you aren’t enthusiastic about your
product, you’ll have a hard time convincing someone else that she should
buy it from you. You can have the experience and use education to fill in the
blanks, but if you aren’t enthusiastic about the product, it simply won’t work.
One of my colleagues was awarded a one-year academic fellowship in the
Czech Republic. While he and his family where abroad, his wife became very
interested in crystal giftware items that were designed and produced there.
She used her time overseas to meet with manufacturers, selected a category
that she was particularly fond of, and negotiated some prices and selling
agreements.
71
Chapter 5: Selecting the Right Products

After they returned home to the United States, she continued to express her
interest in starting her own business importing this line of crystal glassware.
Her next step was to learn about the process of importing and figure out 
what she needed to do to set up such a business. On the advice of her hus-
band, she attended my seminar and learned all the specifics of dealing with
suppliers, customers, and U.S. Customs regulations.
Working on her own, she started to realize that she enjoyed going out there
meeting and introducing clients to the products that she really loved. She
enjoyed sharing the stories of her visits to the factories and the devotion that
many of these craftsmen had toward the quality of their products. She
enjoyed the challenge and that was a result of her personal enthusiasm for
the product that she selected.
She had the experience (product knowledge). She used education wisely. And
she had enthusiasm — the final key in evaluating and selecting a product.
Assessing a Product’s Potential
Whether you’re assessing a product you plan to sell in your hometown or one
you hope to sell halfway around the world, what matters is that the product
matches the needs of the market. So how can you tell what your product’s
potential is?
When you’re importing, take a look at how the product is doing in interna-
tional markets to try to gauge whether it could be successful in the United
States. If the product is successful overseas, it could also do well in the
United States, as long as the United States has similar needs and conditions.
(That last point is key — there may be a huge market for snowshoes in
Siberia, but if your target market is Florida, you probably won’t find many
buyers.)
If you’re exporting, one way to gauge overseas market potential is to look at
sales in the domestic market. If a product is selling well in the United States,
it may do well abroad in a market that has similar needs and conditions.
Even if the sales of a product in the United States are declining, you may still
be able to find a growing market internationally. This is especially true if the
product had done well in the United States but is now losing sales to more
advanced products. A new state-of-the-art technology may not be required in
a developing country, because it may not be able to afford the more sophisti-
cated product. These markets may offer opportunities for products that are
considered outdated by U.S. market standards. For example, sales of brooms
72
Part II: Selecting Products and Suppliers 

in the United States may be declining as vacuum cleaners have become a
staple in every American household. But in a developing country where elec-
tricity isn’t as widespread, there may still be a huge market for high-quality
brooms.
Products may differ from market to market. Because of these differences —
which can be economic, cultural, environmental, political, legal, or financial —
some products offer limited potential in some markets. (Turn to Chapter 1
where I discuss why international business is different from domestic 
business.)
For more information on assessing a market for exporting, turn to Chapter 9;
for importing, turn to Chapter 10.

Connecting with Overseas
Suppliers for Your Imports
In This Chapter
 Figuring out which countries have the products you want to import
 Finding the names of prospective suppliers of products from other countries
 Requesting samples and testing products
 Coming to agreement with an overseas supplier
A
fter you decide on a product to import (see Chapter 5), the next step is
to find and contact the people overseas who manufacture those items,
get product samples, and negotiate an agreement. In this chapter, I show you
how to do exactly that.
Identifying Countries That 
Have What You Need
When you’re looking to be an importer, one of the first things you have to do
is identify countries that have the products you want. Depending on what
you want to import, you may be limited in your choice of countries — not
every country has every product.
In Chapter 9, I fill you in on some online research sources, including Back-
ground Notes (www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/) and country commercial
guides (www.buyusainfo.net/adsearch.cfm?search_type=int&
loadnav=no). You may want to scan these resources to see what items coun-
tries are primarily importing and exporting. In this context, because you’re
looking for suppliers for goods to be imported into the United States, also
look at what a country is producing and then exporting to other countries
(such as the United States).

As you make and narrow down your list of countries that have the product
you’re importing, consider the following:
 Labor costs: Wage rates in many developing countries are lower, which
means you’ll be able to source goods at lower costs.
 Exchange rates: Exchange rates fluctuate, but importing is most 
favorable when a currency is strong.
 Transportation costs: Additional costs in moving the cargo from the
point of manufacture to the ultimate destination need to be factored 
in. These costs include shipment of the cargo from the overseas factory
to the point of shipment, loading costs onto the vessel, overseas ship-
ping, unloading, Customs, and inland freight to the destination. (See
Chapter 13 for more information on the various terms of sales used in
international transactions.)
 Whether the United States places any restriction on the import from
that country: The number of countries with restrictions is extremely
limited. You can determine whether there are any restrictions or con-
straints from specific countries by dealing with a commodity specialist
(see Chapter 3) and by talking to your Customs broker (see Chapter 16).
 Whether the country has a preferential trade agreement with the
United States: These agreements include the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA), the Dominican Republic–Central America Free
Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA), the Generalized System of Preferences
(GSP), and others. (See Chapter 2 for a current list of countries with
which the United States has trade agreements.)
 Your familiarity with the country: Knowing your target country and
having contacts there make doing business easier.
 Your understanding of the local language: If you or your employees
don’t speak the local language, make sure that English is widely spoken
by businesspeople or, if not, that translators and interpreters are 
available.
 Level of development: Trading with developed countries is generally
easier than trading with those that aren’t yet developed.
Expect a trade-off between prices and levels of regulation and protec-
tion. Suppliers in developing countries may be cheaper, but resolving
any problems that occur may be more difficult.
 Location of the supplier: The supplier’s location affects shipping costs,
transit/lead time, and the ease with which you’ll be able to visit suppli-
ers, if necessary. The farther away a supplier is, the higher the shipping
costs will be. Plus, it’ll take longer to get the shipment and it may be
more difficult to visit and meet face to face.
 Existing trade with the United States: A high trade volume suggests that
other businesses have successfully chosen the route you’re considering.
76
Part II: Selecting Products and Suppliers 

Because the U.S. government is more interested in promoting exports, infor-
mation on imports is not readily available, and you have to rely on direct 
contact with foreign governments or go through U.S. embassies, consulates,
foreign chambers of commerce, and foreign trade commission offices.
Finding Overseas Suppliers
After you’ve identified the countries that can supply the products you want
to import, the next step is to find a specific supplier. Choosing a supplier is
an important decision — suppliers have the power to make or break you. If
you end up with one who isn’t reliable or who makes a poor-quality product,
it can be a disaster for your import business.
Before finalizing an agreement to purchase, spend time evaluating the poten-
tial supplier. Check the supplier’s reputation, reliability, and financial status.
Ask for references of other companies that the supplier has done business
with in the United States, and then contact them to confirm quality and 
reliability.
The International Company Profile is a program of the U.S. Commercial
Services of the Department of Commerce. It checks on the reputation, relia-
bility, and financial status of prospective trading partners. You can use this
program as a primary source of information in finalizing an agreement to 
purchase with a foreign supplier. (See Chapter 11 for information on where 
to get this report.)
Subscribing to trade publications
One of the ways that you can identify potential suppliers is to subscribe to 
a variety of trade publications. These publications enable prospective over-
seas manufacturers and agents to advertise their products. They’re a great
resource that you can use to make initial contact (writing, e-mailing, or faxing
a request for additional information, such as a catalog or price list). Some of
the publications are both regional and product specific, so you don’t have to
wade through a lot of information that doesn’t apply to your situation.
In the following sections, I cover the major publications you’ll want to 
look into.
Global Sources
If you’re interested in finding suppliers from the Far East — Burma,
Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Macau, Malaysia,
Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, or Vietnam — one 
of the better trade publications is Global Sources (formerly called Asian
77

Alibaba.com
Alibaba.com (www.alibaba.com) is an online marketplace for global and
domestic Chinese trade. The site connects small and medium-size buyers and
suppliers from around the world.
Recently, I’ve met more and more participants at my seminars using this site
with success. One of the more interesting stories involved someone who had
an idea for marketing a unique line of very small products. He had an idea
and created the site www.teenieweenieproducts.com. His initial product
idea was a Teenie Weenie Pen. He designed this telescoping pen and went to
Alibaba.com to search for suppliers of telescopes. After several communica-
tions, he identified a manufacturer who was able to produce the product,
placed a purchase order, and a business was born.
Hong Kong Trade Development Council
The Hong Kong Trade Development Council (http://sourcing.tdc
trade.com) enables you to buy and sell products from Hong Kong, Mainland
China, and Taiwan. It also provides information on Hong Kong trade events
(exhibitions and conferences) and market intelligence for specific industries
(banking and finance, electronics, garments and textiles, gifts and house-
wares, information and communication technology, timepieces, jewelry, 
optical products, toys, and sporting goods).
UPS and WAND
UPS (www.ups.com) offers some links for businesses looking to find suppli-
ers. Go to www.ups.com/content/us/en/resources/advisor/expand/

(www.wand.com) features an advanced directory indexing system that can
help match buyers and sellers in every industry and country around the

World Network of Chambers of Commerce
World Network of Chambers of Commerce (WNC; www.worldchambers.
com) is an online network of more than 10,000 chambers of commerce and
trade promotion organizations throughout the world. WNC includes a data-
base of products and services; national and international company profiles;
chamber membership directories; and information on Customs regulations
and international and local business, trade, and economic conditions.
Attending a trade show
Trade shows provide all kinds of opportunities for individuals to meet inter-
national buyers, distributors, or representatives. Foreign Trade On-Line
(www.foreign-trade.com/exhibit.htm) provides you with a searchable
database (by country, industry, show name, or show date) of international
trade shows, conferences, and exhibitions. (For more information on attend-
ing trade shows, check out Chapter 10.)
Contacting foreign governments
Just as the United States has offices around the world to promote the sale of
American goods, many foreign countries have set up their own offices in the
United States to promote the sale of their goods in the United States. These
offices can be great resources when you’re looking for sources for your 
products.
My favorite approach for connecting with overseas suppliers is using a coun-
try’s trade commission offices. These offices are normally separate and apart
from the country’s consulate, and they provide guidance to U.S. companies
looking for suppliers in the selected country. In Appendix B, I provide a com-
plete list of these offices throughout the United States. You can request free
publications from these trade commission offices or, in many cases, you can
access the same information on their Web sites.
Trade with other regions of the world is a vital element of the economy of the
United States. International trade is complicated by numerous restrictions,
licensing requirements, trade barriers, and regulations of other countries.
Because these regulations can affect trade with these countries, consular
offices (where representatives of a foreign government represent the legal
interests of their nationals) are responsible for providing information on
entering the country and consignment or shipment of goods. They can even
give you suggestions on consumer needs and preferences.
The Office of the Chief of Protocol publishes a complete listing of the foreign
consular offices in the United States. You can get the list at www.state.gov/
s/cpr/rls/.
84
Part II: Selecting Products and Suppliers 

Requesting Product Samples
After you’ve identified potential suppliers and specific products, you may 
feel like your work is done. But before you buy anything, you need to request
product samples. You can use these samples to verify the product’s quality,
as well as to make presentations to prospective customers. Product samples
can also be used in identifying the designated Harmonized Tariff Classifi-
cation Code and are required in a request for a binding ruling (see Chapter 3).
Finally, if you decide to make a purchase, and you decide that you want to
have the product inspected by an independent inspection company (because
you can’t visit the country and inspect the goods yourself), you’ll need sam-
ples to present to the inspection company. The cost of the services of the
inspection company vary based on the value of the shipment and which
country the goods are coming from.
SGS, 42 Broadway, New York, NY 10004 (phone: 212-482-8700; Web: www.sgs.
com), is the world’s leading inspection, verification, testing, and certification
company. SGS inspects and verifies the quantity, weight, and quality of traded
goods. Here’s how it works: You contact SGS and provide it with:
 Information on the product (specifications)
 The point of shipment
 The name and address of the supplier
 The intended ship date
Once the goods are ready for shipment, the SGS representative in that coun-
try visits and inspects that cargo prior to and during the loading process.
After the inspection, and if everything is in order, SGS issues a certified cer-
tificate of inspection, confirming that the goods are, in fact, as ordered. If the
goods arrive and they aren’t what you ordered, you can file a claim. If the
cargo is correct, but arrives in a damaged condition, you have a claim against
the cargo insurance company (see Chapter 13 and Chapter 15).
Hammering Out an Agreement 
with Your Overseas Supplier
You’ve chosen your supplier and you’re ready to buy. To make sure that the
transaction is smooth, you need to come up with a contract that spells out 
all the pertinent information.
85
Chapter 6: Connecting with Overseas Suppliers for Your Imports

Many potential sources of confusion exist between an importer and an 
overseas supplier, from language difficulties to differences in business prac-
tices — that’s why a clear written contract is so important. If disagreements
do arise, you’ll have an easier time resolving them if you have a written 
contract than you would if you relied solely on a verbal agreement.
Your contract should make all aspects of the trading process — what will
happen, when it will happen, and exactly what each party is responsible for
at each stage — as clear as possible. The following are the key points of
agreement between an overseas supplier and a U.S. importer:
 The products: You must specify what goods you’re buying, being sure to
note the exact specifications with which the products must comply.
 Sales targets: This includes how much you’re ordering and the 
frequency of shipments.
 Territory: You need to spell out the territory in which the distributor
(importer) may sell and whether the distributor (importer) will have
exclusivity there.
 Price: How much will you pay? In which currency? At which exchange
rate?
 Payment terms: You need to specify when and how payments will be
made. For example, will the terms be letter of credit, sight draft, open
account, 30 days, or consignment (see Chapter 14)?
 Shipping terms: Specify exactly who is responsible for shipping costs,
duties, and Customs-related formalities. Use internationally accepted
INCOTERMS, such as FOB, FAS, C&F, CIF, and so on (see Chapter 13), so
you’re on the same page as the supplier.
 Level of effort required of the importer: How hard must you work to
sell the products? This entails a minimum order commitment and long-
term order commitments. Basically, the supplier wants to make sure
you’re not going to place one order and then bail on his product if it
doesn’t work out.
 Delivery: How will the goods be transported to you?
 Insurance: Be clear about who bears what risks — for example, loss or
damage — at each stage of the process.
 Sales promotion and advertising: Who will do it? Who will pay for it?
How much will be invested in it?
 Warranties and service: How will defective or unsold products be 
handled?
86
Part II: Selecting Products and Suppliers 

 Order lead time: Include the procedures that would be implemented if a
dispute were to arise — for example, if one party’s error causes delays
or losses for the other.
 Trademarks, copyrights, and patents: If applicable, who will register,
and in whose name will it be?
 Provision for settlement of disputes: If there is a dispute, where will
legal proceedings be heard?
 Provision for termination of the agreement: If you negotiated an agree-
ment for a particular territory, and you aren’t happy with the product
and want to discontinue that relationship and find a new supplier, you
need to know how to get out of the agreement.
The contracts you have with a supplier will evolve as your trading relation-
ship evolves. Early contracts may be on a shipment-by-shipment basis, but
longer-term contracts may follow as familiarity and trust develop between
the parties.

for Your Exports
In This Chapter
 Identifying manufacturers and distributors
 Approaching suppliers with your proposal to export
 Facing a supplier’s rejection
 Identifying elements to be included in an agreement to sell
A
fter you’ve decided on a product to export, the next step is to find the
supplier who manufactures or distributes that item, contact the sup-
plier, and negotiate an agreement. You can locate suppliers by reading trade
magazines or newspapers or by using library and online references and 
specific industry trade directories. After you identify prospective suppliers,
you have to contact them, determine their level of involvement in exporting,
request specific product information and costs, and eventually negotiate an
agreement to purchase and sell their products in other countries.
A key to success in the exporting business is providing your customers with
quality products and faster service at competitive prices. You need to work
hard to develop a core group of reliable suppliers in order to make this
happen.
Researching Potential Suppliers
A good way to locate suppliers such as manufacturers or distributors is 
to conduct a search using library or online resources. These information
resources are readily available and, for the most part, free — though in 
some cases, you may be required to complete a registration form.

Thomas Register
The Thomas Register, a comprehensive directory of American manufacturers
and distributors, has been connecting suppliers and buyers for the past 100
years. It lists the addresses, locations, telephone number, fax numbers, e-mail
addresses, Web sites, and online catalogs.
The Thomas Register is a publication of the Thomas Publishing Company, 
5 Penn Plaza, New York, NY 10017-0266.
In the past, you had to visit the reference section of your local library to
browse through the 20 or so volumes of oversized green books that make 
up the Thomas Register. Today, you can access all this material online at
www.thomasnet.com.
The site also provides the following additional resources:
 Thomas Global Register: Here you can search the most complete, 
up-to-date directory of worldwide industrial information from more than
700,000 suppliers in 11 languages and 28 countries. (You can also use
this resource to find suppliers from other countries for goods that can
be imported — see Chapter 6.)
 Industrial Market Trends: This is a comprehensive, daily industrial blog
with a biweekly newsletter that publishes the latest industrial develop-
ments, best practices, market trends, and opinions of the editors and
readers.
 The Industrial Marketer: This is a free monthly e-newsletter produced
by ThomasNet especially for industrial marketers (businesses that 
purchase goods for sale to another business for the purpose of produc-
ing another product, reselling it, or using it in the operations of their
business).
WAND.com
WAND.com (www.wand.com) is an international business-to-business 
directory featuring one of the Internet’s most advanced product category 
systems for matching buyers and sellers in every industry.
Buyers visiting the site can search for a list of qualified suppliers for specific
products. After you’ve identified a supplier, you’re able to send requests for
quotations via e-mail or fax to inquire about making a purchase.
90
Part II: Selecting Products and Suppliers 

The listing for companies on the site can include the following information:
 Company name
 Mailing address
 E-mail
 Company Web site
 Online product catalog
 Company information page (information on the history and background
of the company)
Lists of suppliers are available in the following product categories:
 Agriculture and forestry
 Arts, crafts, and hobbies
 Automotive
 Books, music, and video
 Building and construction
 Chemicals, inorganic
 Chemicals, organic
 Clocks and watches
 Communications

 Plastics and rubber
 Safety and security
 Science and technology
 Services
 Sports and recreation
 Textiles and leather
 Toys and games
 Transportation
Industry trade directories
Trade associations or independent publishers make available industry trade
directories, which provide lists of firms involved in that particular industry.
You can use these directories to identify potential suppliers. They’re an 
alternative to the online resources in the previous two sections.
For example, say you’re looking for a manufacturer of foodservice equipment
and supplies. Using the Encyclopedia of Business Information Sources (see the
following section), you look up the foodservice industry. Then you look at 
the listings of available directories for that industry, and you see that Reed
Business Information annually publishes the Foodservice Equipment and
Supply Guide, which lists nearly 1,700 manufacturers of food service equip-
ment and supplies for $35.
The key to this piece of information is that you can use this approach to find
a directory for any industry in which you’ve decided to work.
Encyclopedia of Business Information Sources
The Encyclopedia of Business Information Sources (GALE Research Company)
is an industry reference guide providing listings of available directories,
handbook/manuals, online databases, statistical sources, periodicals,
92
Part II: Selecting Products and Suppliers 

newsletters, and listings of trade/professional associations for an extensive
list of industries and topics. It’s a valuable resource with many different uses
related to finding suppliers and customers.
This reference book costs several hundred dollars, but it’s available in the
reference section of most local libraries. Just visit your local library and 
photocopy the pages for the industries you anticipate working in.
Business Reference Service, U.S. Library of Commerce
The Business and Economic Research Advisor (BERA) has made available
online a series designed as reference and research guides for subjects related
to business and economics. These resources have been compiled by special-
ists in the Business Reference Services of the Science, Technology, and
Business Division of the Library of Congress.
You can access the site by going to www.loc.gov/rr/business/ and then
clicking on the “Internet Resources” link. (Or you can get there directly by
going to www.loc.gov/rr/business/beonline/subjectlist.php.)
Bookmark this site. It’s an excellent resource that provides information on
many other areas — not just lists of companies in various industries. The site
also provides links to detailed import/export resources, country information,
international trade, ecommerce, trade shows, and more.
The Directory of United States Exporters
The Directory of United States Exporters (Commonwealth Business Media, Inc.)
provides a geographical and product listing of U.S. exporters. You can locate
an exporter by product, company name, or geographic region. The listings
provide information about the products and countries with which these
exporters are currently doing business.
You can use this list to identify a company that may have a product that
you’re interested in but that isn’t yet exporting to a country that you may
have a client in. This kind of a company can be a good resource, because the
people there are knowledgeable about exporting and may be interested in
working with you (as opposed to another supplier that does no exporting).
The Directory of United States Exporters and its sister publication — The
Directory of United States Importers — are very expensive. Visit your 
local library to check them out — you may be able to find a copy in the 
reference section.
93
Chapter 7: Finding U.S. Suppliers for Your Exports

The directories are annual publications. You can often find used copies for
sale at used bookstores (including Amazon.com). In 2007, I bought the 2005
edition for $20. (The new version retails for $850.)
Building a Relationship 
with Your Supplier
After you select a supplier, you have to work at building a solid relationship.
Although it can take time and planning to build a solid relationship with a
supplier, doing so makes it more likely that you’ll do even more business 
with them.
Initially, your first orders with a new supplier will be on a shipment-by-
shipment basis. As the relationship develops, you may move to longer and
possibly exclusive agreements.
Communication is important in developing this relationship. Face-to-face
meetings may be difficult, but they can be vital to this trust-building process.
Pay attention to your supplier relationships, and look for areas for improve-
ment. Schedule periodic reviews, and if there are any problems, work
together to resolve them. On the other hand, if things are going well, look 
for ways to expand the relationship.
Dealing with Rejection
One of the more frustrating aspects of searching for suppliers is spending a
lot of time to find a supplier, only to be rejected.
Gaining access to major branded products is almost impossible, because,
more than likely, they already have an extensive network of exclusive 
overseas distributors. For example, you may want to export Johnson &
Johnson Band-Aid brand plastic strips, but they have factories and exclusive
distributors all over the world. If you go through the various reference
sources listed earlier in this chapter, however, you’ll find names of private-
label manufacturers that manufacture a comparable product and do not 
have those agreements — and you’ll probably find some that are excited
about the prospect of doing business with you.
If you encounter a supplier who is not interested in doing business with you,
be sure to explain the many benefits of doing business internationally. You
can link doing business with other countries to the desire to increase profits
94
Part II: Selecting Products and Suppliers 

and sales or protecting them from losing market share to their competitors.
They may talk about the risks and headaches involved with doing business
internationally. Assure them that they’ll be dealing with you, and that you’ll
handle all the paperwork involved with exporting.
Be patient, don’t give up, and keep searching. Always keep your eyes and
ears open, and if a supplier rejects your overtures, keep looking.
Drafting an International 
Sales Agreement
When you’re figuring out your role in this business, you have two main
options: You can structure your business as one of the following:
 Distributor: A distributor is an independent company that purchases
products from a supplier, takes title to them, and resells them. A distrib-
utor purchases products at a negotiated price and is compensated by
selling them at a higher price.
 Sales agent: A sales agent does not purchase goods from the supplier.
Instead, the agent finds customers and solicits offers to purchase the
product from the supplier. An agent does not take title to the goods. 
And an agent earns a commission.
If you’re set up as a distributor, the provisions of your international sales
agreement should include the following:
 Territory and exclusivity (if possible): The agreement should specify
the countries in which you’ll be allowed to sell the goods. The supplier
can set limits on where you may be able to sell.
 Pricing: What price the supplier will charge, the terms and conditions of
sale, and what the method of payment will be.
 Minimum purchase quantities: In most distributor agreements, the 
supplier will expect a commitment for a significant quantity to be pur-
chased, so prior to a distributor providing an exclusive arrangement in a
territory, a provision for minimum purchase quantities will be included
in the distributor agreement.
 Restrictions on handling competing products: Normally, a supplier in a
distributor agreement will want to include a provision where the
appointed distributor will not handle competing products. This is 
especially true if the supplier grants an exclusive right of distribution.
95
Chapter 7: Finding U.S. Suppliers for Your Exports

 Effective date: The agreement should specify the date it will become
effective, as well as the expected duration of the agreement and the 
procedures for modifying, extending, or terminating the agreement.
 Use of trade names, trademarks, and copyrights: The agreement needs
to clarify when and how these may be used and who will have the
responsibility of registering them in the foreign country.
 Warranties and product liability: The agreement should specify how
defective or unsold products will be handled. It should also clarify the
responsibilities concerning product liability insurance.
If you’re set up as a sales agent, provisions should include the following:
 Commissions: A sales agent is paid a commission for his efforts in solic-
iting orders that are accepted by the supplier. Generally, commissions
are paid only when the supplier receives payment from the ultimate 
customer.
 Prices: Because there is no sale directly between the supplier and 
the agent, the supplier usually requires that the agent quote only 
agreed-upon prices.
For more on drafting such an agreement, check out Appendix C.

n this part, I explain the importance of developing a
marketing plan and conducting market research. I give
you lots of information on online, library, and industry
trade resources — all of which you can use to identify cus-

and customers in the United States for goods that you

 Selecting your target market
 Understanding how to develop a marketing plan
 Conducting marketing research and studying buyer behavior
You’ve established your business, chosen a product, and identified a sup-
plier. Now you need to find customers for those products. And that’s
where marketing comes in. In this chapter, I show you how to develop a com-
prehensive marketing program that will get your imports and exports into
the hands of the users.
Entire books have been devoted to the topic of marketing, with much more
detailed information than I can provide in this chapter. If you want to take
your marketing up a notch, be sure to check out Marketing For Dummies, 2nd
Edition, by Alexander Hiam, MBA (Wiley), or Small Business Marketing For
Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Barbara Findlay Schenck (Wiley).
What Is the Market?
A market is a particular group of people who have a need for a product, along
with the authority, willingness, and desire to spend money on the product.
There are two main types of markets: the consumer market and the business-
to-business market. I cover each of these in the following sections.
Considering the consumer market
The consumer market is a particular group of people who have the authority,
willingness, and desire to take advantage of the products that you’re offering
for their own personal use or for use within their household. For example, if I

were importing crystal giftware items from the Czech Republic, selling them
on eBay or through my own store, and I’m selling the items directly to 
consumers, I would be dealing with the consumer market.
The consumer market is large and dynamic. The challenge in dealing with
this market is understanding what the market for your particular product
looks like and how it’s changing. Anticipating what marketing strategies may
work with the consumer market can be difficult — what worked yesterday
may not work today.
Boning up on the business-to-business
market
The business-to-business market consists of businesses that have a need, along
with the authority, willingness, and desire to acquire the products that you’re
offering, for use within their business. It’s selling directly to other businesses
instead of to individuals.
The business-to-business market consists of businesses that purchase goods
for one or more of the following purposes:
 In order to produce other goods: For example, you may be importing
yarn that you will sell to sweater manufacturers in the United States.
Those sweater manufacturers will use the yarn to produce sweaters.
 To resell them to other businesses (such as wholesalers or retailers) or
individual customers: For example, maybe you’re importing yarn that
you’ll sell to yarn stores, which then turn around and sell the yarn to
their knitting-needle-wielding customers.
 To use them in the operations of the organization’s business: For
example, maybe you’re importing office supplies and selling them to a
business that will be using those supplies in the day-to-day operations of
its business.
The distinction between a consumer or business product is not about the
product — it has to do with the reason the product is purchased.
If you’re exporting, governments make an interesting business-to-business
market. Many foreign governments have large requirements, and they issue
government tenders (requests for quotations), which offer interesting busi-
ness opportunities. For example, annually, the Ministries of Health from many
Middle Eastern countries publish a request for bids on a wide variety of 
supplies — usually requests to purchase significant quantities, with very
competitive pricing. When I was an exporter, I received a copy of these 
tenders and submitted a bid. I once received an order for 52,000 bolts of
absorbent gauze measuring 36 inches by 100 yards. The selling price for 
each bolt was about $15, giving me an order for $780,000.
100
Part III: Identifying Your Target Market and Finding Customers 

What Is Marketing?
Most people, when asked to define the term marketing, relate marketing with
a number of its functions — functions that really are only a part of marketing.
For example, some people say that “Marketing is advertising” or “Marketing
is promotion” or “Marketing is selling.” Marketing is all these things, but none
of them exclusively.
A textbook-style definition of marketing says that it is:
 The process of creating and delivering goods to customers
 A system designed to plan, price, promote, and distribute products 
to individuals or businesses, in order to satisfy the objectives of an 
organization (such as profits, sales, or market share)
Marketing starts with an idea (an idea that has been initiated by either a 
manufacturer or a marketer). That idea is transformed into a product and
ultimately acquired by the end user. Between the idea and the end user, you
need to:
1. Transform the idea into a product.
2. Price the product.
3. Promote the product.
4. Select the place where you’re going to put the product so that it can
end up in the hands of the end user.
101
Chapter 8: Looking at Marketing
Market relationships in action
Still not clear on the difference between a con-
sumer relationship and a business-to-business
relationship? Here’s an example:
Paper Stick Company sells white rolled paper
sticks to the ABC Lollipop Company. The rela-
tionship between Paper Stick Co. and ABC
Lollipop Co. is a business-to-business market
relationship, because ABC is purchasing the
sticks to produce another product (lollipops).
ABC Lollipop sells the lollipops to Super Saver
Supermarkets. The relationship between ABC
and Super Saver is a business-to-business
market relationship, because Super Saver is pur-
chasing the lollipops from ABC for the purpose
of reselling them to consumers.
Kathleen goes into the local Super Saver
Supermarket and purchases a bag of lollipops
and takes them home. The relationship between
Super Saver and Kathleen is a consumer market
relationship because Kathleen is purchasing the
lollipops for her own personal use or use within
her household.

You can learn all about the rules and regulations, you can find the products,
but without understanding the marketing process, you’ll never get the 
products into the hands of customers.
Identifying Your Target Market
A target market is a more specific group of customers than those found in the
market as a whole. The target market is the group of consumers whose needs
you’ll focus your marketing efforts on. The first step in marketing is identify-
ing your target market, the consumers you’re going to market to. In order to
identify your target market, you need to
 Research the market. This involves identifying the market, the needs of
the market, and customer expectations, as well as finding out what cur-
rent and potential customers are doing.
 Segment the market. This involves identifying groups within groups.
You need to find groups of customer within a general market who have
different wants and needs, identify the characteristics that distinguish
one segment from another, and identify how current suppliers are 
satisfying the needs of these segments.
 Explore buyer behavior. This involves determining what factors influ-
ence the way the market behaves when making decisions about what,
where, when, from whom, how often, and, most important, why to buy
the product.
In this section, I cover these three steps to identifying your target market.
Researching the market
Market research consists of all the activities that help you get the information
you need when making decisions about your product, its price, and promo-
tion and distribution strategies for your customers. It involves the collection,
analysis, and interpretation of data about your market and competitors. (In
Chapters 9 and 10, I cover market research issues pertinent to exporting and
importing, respectively.)
The primary objective of market research is to help you identify your target
market and provide you with competitive product information. You need to
know everything you can about the people who have the authority, willing-
ness, and desire to take advantage of the products that you’re offering. You
also need to know everything you can about your competition.
In market research, there are two types of data: primary and secondary.
102
Part III: Identifying Your Target Market and Finding Customers 

Primary data
Primary data are facts that you’re collecting for yourself based on your own
research. There are three methods used to gather primary data:
 Observational research: Collecting data by watching someone’s
actions. Internet cookies are one type of observational research. A
cookie records a person’s activities when visiting a Web site — it 
keeps track of the pages a visitor views and the time he spends on 
those pages.
 Survey research: Gathering data by interviewing people. You can 
interview them in person, by mail, over the phone, or via the Internet.
 Experimental research: Gathering data by observing the results of
changing one variable, while holding another variable constant. For
example, maybe I want to measure the impact that a product’s location
on a shelf has on sales. The dependent variable will be sales, and the
variable that I will manipulate is the shelf the product is located on —
top, middle, or bottom.
The first week, I put the product on the top shelf and record sales. 
The next week, I move the product to the middle shelf and again record
sales. In week three, I move the product to the bottom shelf and again
record the sales. I’ve conducted experimental research, and the informa-
tion I’ve gathered is the effect on sales of the shelf the product is 
located on.
Secondary data
Secondary data are available facts that have been gathered by someone else
for some other purpose. Secondary data sources include
 Business and marketing publications and directories: References that
can be used to gain information about what may be going on in an indus-
try or a list of firms within an industry or business. You can identify the
availability of such publications using the Encyclopedia of Business
Information Sources (Gale).
 Marketing and research company Web sites: These include sites 
such as Gallup (www.gallup.com), ACNielsen Retail Index (www.
acnielsen.com), or Fuld & Company Internet Intelligence Index
(www.fuld.com/fuld-bin/f.wk?fuld.i3.home).
 Government agencies and publications: Check out
www.house.gov/house/govsites.html for a directory of all U.S.
government agencies.
 Professional association sources: To identify specific industry trade
associations, visit the reference section of your local public library and
ask the reference librarian for a copy of the Encyclopedia of Business
Information Sources, which offers a detailed list of trade and professional
associations for a wide variety of industries and subjects.
103
Chapter 8: Looking at Marketing

Segmenting the market
Market segmentation is a process where you divide the total market for a 
particular product into several smaller groups that have certain similarities.
A market segment is a set of individuals or businesses that share a common
characteristic and have similar needs and desires.
Manufacturers often segment the market. Next time you’re in the drugstore
or supermarket, check out the toothpaste aisle and pay attention to all the
different kinds of toothpaste offered for sale just by Crest alone. Toothpaste
isn’t just toothpaste anymore. You can get pastes, gels, toothpastes with
whiteners, toothpastes for tartar control, and more. Crest is using a segmen-
tation strategy — it makes slight variations to the product, enabling its 
product to appeal to a different target market.
One of the benefits of segmentation is that all businesses, but especially
those that are smaller and have limited resources, are able to compete more
effectively by directing their resources to specifically selected markets. It
also benefits medium-size firms in that it enables them to develop a strong
position in specialized segment.
An extreme form of segmenting the market is referred to as niche marketing.
Niche marketing is an approach that divides the market segments into even
smaller subgroups. The benefit of this approach is that you can tailor your
products and marketing strategies even more precisely to appeal to this
smaller segment. Plus, because many of these markets are very small, you
face fewer competitors.
The product that you choose to import or export can be targeted to either or
both the consumer or business-to-business market. But these two markets
have distinctively different needs, wants, purchasing procedures, and buying
patterns. In the following sections, I fill you in on how to segment the con-
sumer market and how to segment the business-to-business market.
Segmenting the consumer market
You can segment the consumer market in four ways:
 Geographic segmentation is the process of dividing the market on the
geographic distribution of the population. Different geographic areas
have distinctive characteristics, which may require adjustments to the
different marketing strategies. For example, are you looking at marketing
your goods in rural areas, urban areas, or suburban areas?
 Demographic segmentation is the process of dividing the market
according to variables such as age, gender, family size, income, educa-
tion, and so on. Demographics are the most common basis for segment-
ing the consumer market.
104
Part III: Identifying Your Target Market and Finding Customers 

For example, let’s say a company manufactures a line of disposable
razors. When the company markets the products to men, the razors
have a yellow handle. But the company can take the same disposable
razor, change the handle from yellow to pink, and market it to women.
When you’re evaluating different products, keep an open mind. Always
looking at the product and how, with modifications, you can make 
it appeal to different markets based on any of these demographic 
variables.
 Psychographic segmentation involves identifying attributes to what 
a person things or feels. You look at the entire market and divide it 
on the basis of personality characteristic, motives, and lifestyle. For
example, bottled-water companies package their goods in a variety of
different bottles to satisfy different lifestyles and motives — they may
produce a bottle with a flip-top lid for athletes or people on the go.
 Behavioral segmentation is the process of dividing the market on the
basis of how the consumer behaves toward the product. This usually
involves some aspect of product use (light, moderate, or heavy users).
Segmenting the business-to-business market
The process of segmenting the business-to-business market is different
because there are fewer customers. A more focused marketing effort
designed to meet the specific needs of a group of similar customers is far
more efficient, and will likely be more successful.
The bases that you can use to segment the business-to-business market are
 Customer location: Some industries are geographically concentrated
(for example, computer companies in Silicon Valley).
 Customer type: You can market your goods to a variety of industries.
For example, if you’re importing some form of small electronic motors,
your market could be spread over several different industries.
 Size: Many sellers can divide the market into small and large accounts,
potentially using different pricing and distribution strategies for 
different accounts.
 Buying situation: The situation surrounding the transaction can also be
a basis for segmenting a market. You may have to modify your marketing
efforts to deal with different buying situations:
• New task: A situation in which a company considers purchasing a
given item for the first time. It usually involves a significant initial
investment, and the company will spend lots of time evaluating 
different alternatives (such as a lollipop company considering the
purchase of a new lollipop machine).
105
Chapter 8: Looking at Marketing

• Straight rebuy: A routine, low-involvement purchase that involves
minimal information needs and no major involvement in evaluating
alternatives (such as purchasing cleaning supplies for a manufac-
turing facility).
• Modified rebuy: A situation somewhere in between new task and
straight rebuy. A buyer needs some information and will spend
some time evaluating alternatives (such as a lollipop manufacturer
that is evaluating different suppliers of paper sticks).
Exploring buyer behavior
Behavior is the way someone acts. If you’re going to develop a marketing
plan, you need to understand and identify how the buyers will act when
making decisions about what, where, when, how often, from whom, and, 
most important, why they’ll purchase the goods that you’re offering. In other
words, you need to know the factors that will influence the way the buyer
behaves.
These factors influencing buying behavior are different for the consumer 
and business-to-business markets. I outline both in the following sections.
Buyer behavior in the consumer market
Before making a purchase, consumers go through a decision-making process.
This decision-making process is similar to the process they would use to
solve a problem:
1. The consumer identifies that something is lacking or that a situation
needs to be dealt with.
2. The consumer identifies the alternative product or products that will
address the problem, and then seeks out alternative brands and 
gathers information about them.
3. The consumer identifies the benefits and drawbacks of each of the
alternative products.
When evaluating each of the alternatives, the consumer considers each
of the following questions:
• Is it feasible? Can he afford it?
• To what extent is the alternative satisfactory, and does it actually
address the problem?
• What are the possible consequences of the alternative?
4. The consumer decides to buy or not to buy, and if the consumer
decides to buy, makes other decisions relating to the purchase 
(including where and when to make the purchase).
106
Part III: Identifying Your Target Market and Finding Customers 

5. The consumer looks for assurance that he’s selected the correct 
alternative.
The amount of time the consumer spends on each of these steps depends 
on the category of the product. If the product is a convenience good (an 
item that has a low unit price, such as a gallon of milk or a loaf of bread), 
the amount of time spent on each stage would be minimal. If the product is a
big-ticket item (such as a computer, a television, or a car), the consumer may
spend more time evaluating alternatives before making the decision.
So what factors influence the consumer’s decision-making process? In the
consumer market, behavior is influenced by three kinds of factors:
 Personal factors: These include
• Motivation: Consumers look for products that will satisfy their
needs, whether those needs are physiological (food, drink, and
shelter) or psychological (affection, belonging, self-esteem).
• Attitudes: These are predispositions (either favorable or unfavor-
able) toward something, someplace, or someone. The consumer
has already made up his mind that he either likes or dislikes some-
thing, someplace, or someone.
• Personality: These are traits such as self-esteem, the extent to
which he believes that he can control events affecting him, the
rigidity of his beliefs, and so on.
• Perception: Consumers gather information before making a choice,
and perception is the process of receiving, organizing, and assign-
ing meaning to that information. It’s how the consumer goes about
interpreting and understanding the situation, and it plays a role in
the stage where the consumer identifies alternatives (Step 2).
Consumers pay attention to and remember things that are impor-
tant to them; they ignore and forget those things that may be
inconsistent with their beliefs and attitudes.
 Interpersonal or social factors: The way that consumers think, believe,
and act are usually determined by their interaction with other individu-
als. Friends, families, and households can influence consumer attitudes,
values, and behavior. If the whole family prefers Coke to Pepsi, the
person doing the shopping may be swayed more to Coke than to Pepsi,
regardless of what she likes.
 Situational factors: Situations can play a large part in determining how
consumers behave. Things like the surroundings, terms of purchase, and
the moods and motives of consumers can influence their behavior. For
example, you may not have given much thought to which brand of soda
you buy, but as you’re walking down the aisle of your grocery store, you
see that Pepsi is on sale, and you buy it.

Part III: Identifying Your Target Market and Finding Customers 
Buyer behavior in the business-to-business market
The business-to-business market consists of individuals and organizations
that purchase goods for the purpose of production of other goods, resale, or
use in the operations of their business. Buyer behavior in the business-to-
business market is more rational and logical than it is in the consumer
market; it’s not influenced by the personal or interpersonal factors you find
in the consumer market.
To better understand business-to-business buyer behavior, you need to
understand the characteristics of demand in the business-to-business
market:
 Demand is derived. The demand for the business product is generated
from the demand for the consumer products in which the business prod-
uct is used. For example, the amount of rolled white paper sticks that I
sell to Lolly’s Lollipop Company is derived from the consumers’ demand
for Lolly’s Lollipops. If Lolly’s sells no lollipops, then I won’t be able to
sell Lolly’s Lollipop Company any rolled white paper sticks.
 Demand is inelastic. Demand for a business product responds very 
little to changes in price. For example, any major changes in prices for
my sticks to Lolly’s Lollipop Company will not influence the amount of
sticks it purchases, simply because, if Lolly’s isn’t selling any lollipops 
to its customers, it doesn’t need to purchase the sticks from me.
 Demand is widely fluctuating. Businesses are worried about being low
on inventory when consumer demand increases and, at the same time,
they don’t want to have too much inventory if consumer demand
declines.
 Buyers are well informed. Business-to-business buyers are knowledge-
able and aware of alternative sources of supply and competitive prod-
ucts. Buyers tend to specialize in certain items, and the costs are
extremely high if they make a mistake. For example, if they order the
wrong goods or pay too high a price, they may have to close their 
production line and raise prices.
The decision-making process for a buyer in the business-to-business market
is pretty much the same as it is in the consumer market (see the preceding
section). However, there are some differences in business-to-business buying
behavior:
 The business buyer is more practical, rational, and unemotional.
 The business buyer is primarily concerned with issues such as price,
quality, service, and delivery.
 The business buyer is under intense quality and time pressure.

Chapter 8: Looking at Marketing
In the consumer market, usually the decision of what, were, when, from
whom, and why a person is going to buy something is made by that one
person. On the other hand, in the business-to-business market, the decisions
are usually made by a variety of different individuals, known as the buying
center. The buying center includes all those individuals who are involved in
the purchase decision-making process. The members of this unit may serve
in one or more of the following roles:
 Users: The individuals who are using the product. For example, when I
sell rolled white paper sticks to Lolly’s Lollipop Company, the produc-
tion supervisor and some operators need to be concerned about the
product. They want to make sure that the product meets their specifica-
tions and that they won’t have any problems while they’re running the
equipment and producing the product.
 Influencers: The individuals in the organization who have expertise or
financial positions that can be used to influence product and purchase
specifications. These people, using their positions in the organization,
develop the specifications and identify acceptable suppliers.
 Deciders: The individuals who actually make the buying decision 
about the product and supplier. In some cases, the decider may be the
purchasing agent.
 Gatekeepers: The individuals who control the flow of purchasing infor-
mation within and outside the organization. This could be the reception-
ist or department secretary who may schedule appointments.
 Buyers: The individuals who interact with the vendors, coordinate the
terms of sales, and process the actual purchase orders.
Say you import ceramic giftware from Italy and you want to sell the products
to a department store such as Target. You need to realize that the final deci-
sion to purchase from you may be made by many different individuals within
the organization. You need to identify all the individuals who may be part of
this buying center.
Developing Product Strategies
Product strategies help create the value the customer sees in the product.
This part of the marketing plan focuses on the uniqueness of your product,
and how the customer will benefit from using the products you’re offering.
Benefits can be intangible as well as tangible. For example, if you’re selling a
nontoxic cleaning product, your customers will benefit by having a cleaner
house, but they may also benefit by enjoying better health. Identify as many
benefits as possible for the product, and then choose to emphasize the bene-
fits that your targeted customers will most appreciate in your marketing plan.

The key issues involved in developing product strategies include the 
following:
 What products or services should you offer? What should be the
breadth and depth of your product mix? How many different product
lines will you carry and what sort of variety will you provide for each
product line?
 How should the products be branded or otherwise identified?
 How should the products be packaged?
 What will be your policies when it comes to warranties and 
guarantees?
I cover each of these in the following sections.
Product mix
One of the first product strategy decisions that you have to make is identify-
ing the product lines and mix of products that you’re going to offer to your
customers. A product mix is a listing of all products that you’ll be offering for
sale, and a product line is a group of products that are intended for similar
uses and have similar characteristics.
110
Part III: Identifying Your Target Market and Finding Customers 
My own experience with a buying center
I was selling products to pharmaceutical manu-
facturers in Puerto Rico, and I had a new source
of supply for the goods using a local manufactur-
ing facility on the island. In the past, I had been
supplying them with products from the main 
factory in Connecticut. But I was able to offer 
them the locally produced item at a savings of 40
percent to 50 percent (mainly due to reduced
shipping costs).
I was very confident that, when I made the offer
to the buyer in the purchasing department, 
I would be able to get all the business and 
eliminate my competitors. But to my surprise, 
the buyer had a nominal say in changing 
the source of supply. In addition to getting the
buyer’s approval, I also had to get the approval 
of the production supervisor, the marketing
department, and the pharmaceutical company’s
quality-control department.
The facility based in Connecticut had been
inspected and approved as a source of supply. As
soon as I changed the production facility to
Puerto Rico, they needed to come and inspect the
plant, putting it through the complete approval
process. Without this approval, I couldn’t provide
them with products from this facility at the 
lower cost.
So, even with the lower price, I still had to devote
the time to getting the new facility approved.
Eventually, I was able to get the business, but
there was a delay of six months while we waited
for all the parties to visit, inspect, and approve 
the facility.

For example, let’s say you’re importing giftware from the Far East. The 
product mix is a list of all the items that you’re offering for sale; it may be
made up of a variety of ceramic, crystal, wood, pewter, and glass giftware
items. Ceramic, crystal, wood, pewter, and glass represent the different 
product lines.
A product mix has both breadth and depth. Breadth is the number of product
lines you’re carrying (in the example in the preceding paragraph, that would
be five — ceramic, crystal, wood, pewter, and glass). Depth is the variety of
items offered within each product line (for example, in your pewter product
line, you may offer cups, trays, candlesticks, goblets, and so on). You need to
decide how narrow or wide your product mix will be, and whether the prod-
uct line offerings are going to be shallow or deep.
Initially, you’re probably better off starting with one limited line of products.
After your business evolves and starts to grow, you may extend the product
line or expand the product mix. For example, you may start off selling pewter
giftware. After you experience some success, you could expand your product
mix by adding crystal or ceramic giftware items. Or you could extend your
product line by going from selling cups, goblets, and trays to selling cups,
goblets, trays, and candlesticks.
Branding
The next product-related decision is how you want your products to be iden-
tified. A brand is a name or mark that is used to identify the products of one
seller and to differentiate them from competing products.
111
Chapter 8: Looking at Marketing
Pondering the product life cycle
There are four stages in the life cycle of a 
product:
 Introduction: During the introduction stage,
you usually have a low level of sales and
profits.
 Growth: The growth stage entails a rapid
increase in sales and profits.
 Maturity: The maturity stage shows a con-
tinued increase in sales, but at a declining
rate.
 Decline: The sales volume decreases 
significantly during the decline stage.
Bottom line: Nothing lasts forever. When a prod-
uct starts to have a significant decline in sales,
it’s in the decline stage. When that happens to
your product, you have three options for extend-
ing the life of the product. You can
 Modify or improve the product. This could
be something as simple as changing the
packaging.
 Identify new uses for the product.
 Identify new markets for the existing 
product.

You can use the brand names and marks of the manufacturer, develop your
own brand, or offer a private label (store brand) for your customers.
If you decide to develop your own brand, you may have to make minimum
quantity commitments with your suppliers. These minimum purchase quanti-
ties may prove to be expensive, so initially, as a startup, selling the products
using the manufacturer’s brand may be more cost-effective.
If you’re not willing to assume the responsibilities and costs with developing
and promoting a brand, developing your own brand may not be for you. Or,
you may decide not to develop your own brand because your products
cannot be physically different from the products from other companies.
Packaging and labeling
After you’ve developed and branded your product, the next step is to
address the features of packaging and labeling. Packaging is intended to:
 Protect the product as it moves between the producer and final customer
 Protect the product from the time it is purchased until the time it is used
 Assist the customers in considering the purchase of the product
 Promote the product
Here are some packaging factors that are somewhat unique to international
marketing:
 Changes in climate across countries may require protective packaging
against cold or heat.
 Because of possible lengthy transportation times, packaging needs to 
be able to protect the goods against breakage or damage.
 Smaller packages may be required in low-income countries.
 Smaller packages may be more common in countries where shoppers
make frequent trips.
Labeling, in its most basic form, provides information to the customers. You
can use a brand label applied to your product to differentiate your products
from competitive offerings. A descriptive label provides information about
how the product is used or manufactured and/or other relevant features.
If you’re exporting products that are ultimately going into the consumer
market, be sure to offer bilingual labeling. (Remember: Canadian products
should be labeled in both English and French.)
112
Part III: Identifying Your Target Market and Finding Customers 

Warranties and guarantees
The purpose of a warranty is to assure the buyer that the product will 
perform up to reasonable expectations.
Say you decide to import lamps from Italy, and you sell them to retail furni-
ture stores in the United States. When you make the sale to the retailers, you
provide them with a guarantee that the product will perform as expected.
Mary visits the store, purchases the lamp, and takes it home. When she
arrives home, she realizes that the lamp is defective. She returns the lamp to
the store for credit. The store contacts you, the importer, and asks for a
credit or requests that the product be repaired.
At the time you purchase the lamps from the supplier in Italy, you must have
an agreement as to how you’ll handle defective products. You need to have
an agreement in place with your supplier stating that if the product is defec-
tive, credit will be issued to you (and explaining how). Will you have to return
the product back to the supplier in Italy? If the product can be repaired, will
it be repaired in the United States, or does it have to be returned back to Italy
for repair?
Make sure that you have this understanding in place, before you place the
order and coordinate payment with the exporter.
Pricing Your Products
Price is the amount of money that the customer will need in order to acquire
your product. When you’re setting the price for your product, you need to do
so with one of three objectives in mind:
 Profit: There are two profit-oriented goals: Maximize sales or achieve a
target return or desired profit level.
 Sales: The pricing objective may be to set the price to increase or maxi-
mize sales volume or to maintain or increase your share of the market.
 Image: You have to decide whether you want to you want to convey an
image of prestige or discount.
To accomplish your objective, you have two possible strategies:
 Penetration is the strategy employed when you want to go into the
market with a low price and place the emphasis on the sales objective.
 Skimming is when you enter the market with a high price, placing an
emphasis on the profitability objective.
113
Chapter 8: Looking at Marketing

Several factors will influence your decision when it comes to setting a price:
 The nature of the market: You need to look at the demographic charac-
teristics of the market (such as age, income, level of education, socioe-
conomic class, and so on), together with the physical location of the
market.
 The nature of your product: Would the product be categorized as a con-
venience good (low unit price, purchased with little effort), a shopping
good (for which customers compare products on the basis of price,
quality, style, and so on), or a specialty product (one that the consumer
will make a special effort to secure).
 Your competition: When you evaluate or set a price, you need to look at
what others are charging for similar products. Unless your products are
unique, competition pays a role in the setting of the price.
 Your costs: You need to charge a price that covers your costs. No busi-
ness can stay in business for any period of time, if it continued to sell
product below cost for any period of time.
 Economic forces: You have to consider what’s going on with the econ-
omy. What is the interest rate? What is the value of the dollar in relation
to the currency of another country? Is it a period of inflation? Is a 
recession on the horizon?
 Political forces: If you’re selling goods in a politically risky country, the
greater the risk and the higher the price.
Specific issues and questions you need to address include the following:
 What should be the basic price? This is your standard price, sort of the
same as the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) or list price.
 What discounts (or extras) will you allow? For example, will you offer
trade discounts (price reductions given to members of the trade, such as
wholesalers and retailers), quantity discounts, promotional discounts
(price reduction given to the buyer for performing promotional services,
such as prominently displaying products), or seasonal discounts (dis-
count offered when customers place orders during a low season).
 How should the price relate to cost? Almost everyone agrees that prices
should cover costs. However, not every product must be priced to cover
its own individual costs each time it is sold. You may choose to sacrifice
profits on one item to support the sale of other more profitable items.
 When and under what conditions should a price be changed? You
have to decide when you want to increase or reduce prices. For exam-
ple, if you note that economic forces are raising interest rates, you may
decide to lower prices, or vice versa.
 Should you charge different prices to different customers? Will you
offer one price to a small mom-and-pop store and another price to a
retail chain like Wal-Mart?
114
Part III: Identifying Your Target Market and Finding Customers 

Laws (such as the Robinson-Patman Act) do prevent price differentials,
but not all price differentials are illegal under the act. Price differentials
are only against the law if the effect is to reduce competition. Note:
You’re still allowed to give quantity discounts.
The correct way to price an import product is to first set its price point in the
market and then work back to a free on board (FOB) factory value. Table 8-1
is a hypothetical shipment of wooden toys from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, to
New York. The shipment is 108 dozen toys, packed 27 dozen per case. Each
case measures 36 inches by 36 inches by 36 inches and weighs 80 pounds. If
you’re importing these items and selling them in the United States, you would
start by filling out the top line (your retail price point), and work your way
down the list, filling in the Cost per Piece column for every step.

Promoting Your Product
Promotion is anything that you do to inform, persuade, influence, and/or
remind your target market about the products that you’re offering. Promotion
includes all types of marketing activities designed to stimulate demand. The
promotion mix consists of advertising, personal selling, publicity, and sales
promotion:
 Advertising: Advertising is any nonpersonal communication that you
pay for in order to inform, persuade, influence, or remind the target
market about the products that you’re offering. Advertising can consist
of the electronic media (radio or TV), print media (magazines or news-
papers), or other categories (such as the Internet, direct mail, transit
advertising, and so on).
116
Part III: Identifying Your Target Market and Finding Customers 

Trade publications that target businesses in particular industries often
have classified ads at the back of the magazine. These classifieds can be
an effective and inexpensive way to let people know about the products
you’re selling. Go to the Encyclopedia of Business Information Sources
(see “Researching the market,” earlier in this chapter), search for your
desired industry catalog, and identify a trade periodical for that industry
or product category.
 Personal selling: Personal selling is a personal communication of infor-
mation between a buyer and seller. A salesperson (you or someone you
hire) makes a presentation, trying to inform, persuade, and influence 
the buyer about your products.
If you’re an exporter, keep in mind that personal selling is often more
important in the international market than it is in the domestic market,
because media (TV, radio, newspapers, and so on) may not be available,
and wages are lower in many developing countries.
 Publicity: Publicity is an unpaid-for communication through the media
about you and your products. For example, if you’re an importer, you
could donate to charity a product that you’re importing and get some
publicity.
 Sales promotion: Sales promotions are devices (such as product sam-
ples, coupons, point-of-purchase displays, and so on) that are used to
stimulate demand for your product. You can also use sales promotions
to support advertising and personal selling.
A promotion strategy aimed at middlemen is called a push strategy, while a
promotion strategy directed at end users is called a pull strategy. For example,
a typical channel of distribution may look like this:
Importer/exporter →wholesaler →retailer →consumer
A push strategy is when the importer or exporter targets her promotional
effort toward the wholesaler or retailer. For example, the importer or
exporter offers the wholesaler or retailer free goods. The free goods are an
attempt to influence that wholesaler or retailer to purchase more goods for
the purpose of pushing them through the channel of distribution.
A pull strategy is when the importer or exporter targets her promotional
efforts to the consumer, in the form of advertising. The intent is for the 
consumer to see the advertising and be pulled in to the store to look for the
products.
Push is the primary promotion strategy used by most small to medium-size
import/export businesses.
117
Chapter 8: Looking at Marketing

When you’re coming up with your promotion strategies, consider the 
following:
 Is there a promotional opportunity? An opportunity is anything exter-
nal to the organization that have a positive impact on the organization.
You can identify them by monitoring the environment and trying to iden-
tify those factors (a competitor going out of business, special discounts
offered from your suppliers, and so on).
 Who should you target with your promotion? Will it be the consumers
or the intermediaries (wholesalers/retailers/industrial distributors)?
 What should your promotional message be? How are you going to get
the attention of your market and influence them? The message has two
elements — the appeal (the benefit that the customer will get for accept-
ing your message) and the execution (how you’re going to get the 
attention of that person with your appeal).
 What promotional media should you employ? Will it be radio, televi-
sion, magazines, newspaper, direct mail, Internet? You need to select the
media that will best reach your target market.
 How much should you spend on promotion? The best approach for
developing a promotion budget is to figure out the objectives you want
to achieve with the promotion program. Then you need to figure out
what that will cost.
Distributing Your Product
The final piece in your marketing plan is distribution — how you get the 
product in the hands of the end user. During this stage, you have to identify
the distribution channel, the people and businesses involved in the transfer 
of title of a product as the product moves from the producer to the consumer
or the business user. You want to use a distribution channel that meets 
the needs of your customers, but also provides you with a competitive
advantage.
Agents are marketing intermediaries who bring buyers and sellers together,
but who do not take title to the goods. Wholesalers and retailers are market-
ing intermediaries who bring buyers and sellers together and who do take
title to the goods. (See Chapter 2 for more information on agents and 
distributors.)
If you’re selling to the consumer market, you can select any of the following
channels of distribution:
118
Part III: Identifying Your Target Market and Finding Customers 

 You →consumer
 You →retailer →consumer
 You →wholesaler →retailer →consumer
 You →agent →retailer →consumer
 You →agent →wholesaler →retailer →consumer
If you’re selling to the business-to-business market, here are your distribution
channel options:
 You →business user
 You →industrial distributor →business user
 You →agent →business user
 You →agent →industrial distributor →business user
When it comes to distribution, you need to consider questions such as:
 Should you sell direct or use middlemen? Will you be using a direct
channel of distribution, selling directly to the consumer or will you 
use wholesalers or retailers as part of the channel? In the business-
to-business market, you have to determine whether you want to deal
directly with the business user or engage the services of an industrial
distributor.
 What types of distribution channel components should you use? For
example, will you sell your product in department stores, discount
houses, mail-order establishments, variety stores, drugstores, and 
so on?
 Should you use multiple channels of distribution or just one? In some
cases, you may want to deal direct; in others, you may want to use a
middleman like a wholesaler who will sell to the retailer.
The channel of distribution that’s right for you will depend on a number of
factors:
 Number of customers: The fewer customers you have, the more likely
you’ll deal direct. The more customers you have, the more likely you’ll
be to lengthen the channel of distribution and use intermediaries.
 Geographic location of the customers: The more concentrated the 
customers are in a geographic area, the more likely you’ll be to choose 
a short channel of distribution and deal direct. On the other hand, the
more spread out your customers, the more likely you’ll be to choose a
longer channel.
119
Chapter 8: Looking at Marketing

 Size of the order: When the orders are large, direct distribution makes
sense.
 Value of the product: A product with a low unit price typically has a
long channel of distribution and you’ll use intermediaries like whole-
salers. On the other hand, if you’re selling a high-value item, you may
want to eliminate the middleman and deal direct.
 Product perishability: If the product has a short shelf life, you’ll be
more likely to deal direct. If the product has a long shelf life, you may
want to use intermediaries and have a longer channel of distribution.
 Technical nature: The more complex a product, the more likely you’ll be
to use a short channel of distribution and deal direct. If the item is non-
technical and you won’t need specially trained representatives, you may
have a longer channel of distribution and use the intermediaries.

Researching Export Markets
In This Chapter
 Knowing how to get started
 Screening and assessing potential target markets
 Finding more information
I
f you want to be a successful exporter, you need to research your poten-
tial markets before you get into the game. Market research is the process of
collecting data and putting that data into a format that can be used to iden-
tify opportunities and limitations within those individual foreign markets.
Sure, you can begin exporting without doing any research, but research
reduces uncertainty. It gives you the information you need to decide which
countries will offer the best opportunities for success. In this chapter, I guide
you through the process of conducting market research for your export 
business, so you have the best chance to succeed.
A Step-by-Step Approach to 
Export Market Research
When you’re starting to think about exporting a product to other countries,
you may have visions of conquering the world: “My product will be on every
store shelf in every country in the world!” Just as you need to choose the
product that’s right for you (see Chapter 5), you need to choose the market
(or the country) that’s right for your product.
In this section, I walk you through a step-by-step approach that’ll help you
identify the more desirable markets while eliminating those that are less than
desirable.

Screening your potential markets
When you’re screening potential markets, you need to pay attention to the
needs of the markets, as well as which markets are growing and offer you the
greatest potential for success. In the following sections, I show you how to do
exactly that.
Step 1: Focus on needs
A logical first step is to conduct an initial screening based on need. A need is
a lack of something. If a market doesn’t need your product, no amount of
effort on your part will allow you to successfully market goods in that coun-
try. For example, if your product is air conditioners, you likely wouldn’t find
much of a market for them in Iceland.
Try locating statistics on current product exports to the countries you’re
considering. With this information, you can identify what products are being
sold where and by whom. If a product is being sold in the market, you’ll be
able to identify whether a need or demand exists for your product.
To get export statistics, check out the following:
 International Trade Administration (ITA): The ITA promotes trade and
investment and ensures fair trade and compliance with trade laws and
agreements. On the ITA Web site (www.ita.doc.gov), you can access
information and services on U.S. international trade policy.
 U.S. Exports of Merchandise Report: The U.S. Department of Commerce
publishes the U.S. Exports of Merchandise Report on the National Trade
Data Bank (NTDB), which is available online at www.stat-usa.gov
for a subscription fee of $75 per quarter or $200 per year. The report is
extremely valuable, because it provides information on both units and
dollar values on all exports, allowing you to compute the average price
of the unit exported.
 U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services Report: The U.S.
Department of Commerce also releases trade statistics in its U.S.
International Trade in Goods and Services Report (referred to as FT900).
To access and download this report, visit www.census.gov/foreign-
trade/www/press.html.
 Foreign Trade Report: The U.S. Department of Commerce provides sta-
tistics on all U.S. imports and exports in a monthly Foreign Trade Report
(referred to as FT925), which is accessible at your local district office 
of the Department of Commerce (www.commerce.gov/Services/
index.htm), as well as at the National Trade Data Bank (www.stat-
usa.gov).

Step 2: Narrow the list of countries
Narrow the list of countries by identifying five or so of the fastest growing
markets for your product. Determine whether this growth has been consis-
tent over the past few years.
You can do this by looking at sales over the past two to four years. Try to
identify those markets where the growth has been consistent from year to
year. Also, try to figure out whether there were any economic conditions
(such as inflation or recession) that could have impacted these trends.
Step 3: Develop a secondary list
Come up with a secondary list of countries — ones that may not be as large
as your top five, but that may provide opportunities for future growth. Look
for markets that are beginning to grow and with fewer competitors than
those in your top five. If an emerging market is beginning to open up, you
may find the number of competitors less than you may find in established
markets. The countries representing these up-and-coming markets should
also have higher growth rates, thus offering some exciting potential.
Step 4: Narrow the list to the most promising markets
Narrow the list to what you consider the most promising markets. Consult
with the trade consultant at your local district office of the Department of
Commerce, Small Business Development Centers (www.sba.gov/sbdc),
freight forwarders, business associates, and others before moving on to the
assessment stage.
Assessing your target markets
A market is a particular group of people who have the authority, willingness,
and desire to take advantage of the products that you’re offering. The target
market is that specific segment to which you’ll direct your marketing 
strategies.

Chapter 9: Researching Export Markets

After going through the initial screening and identifying countries that have 
a basic need for your product, you have to evaluate each of these options in
relation to the environmental forces — financial, economic, political, legal,
socio-cultural, competitive, and so on (see Chapter 1 for more on environ-
mental forces).
Step 1: Focus on financial and economic forces
Your first step is to look at factors such as trends in inflation rates, exchange
rates, balance of payments, and interest rates. Credit availability and the
paying habits of customers are other factors to consider.
A country’s balance of payments (BOP) is a summary of all economic trans-
actions between that country and the rest of the world over a given period of
time. It measures the movement of money into and out of a country. If more
money is leaving the country (through imports) than is coming into the coun-
try (through exports), the country has a deficit. If more money is flowing 
into a country than leaving it, the country has a surplus.
So if a country has a surplus, you may see more potential to export goods
into that country. On the other hand, if the BOP were running at a deficit, this
may not be an attractive market in which to export your goods — but you
may find some interesting importing opportunities there.
Another financial force to consider is fluctuations in the exchange rates. A
strong U.S. dollar makes American goods more expensive in foreign markets,
while a weak U.S. dollar makes American products more affordable. In other
words, a strong U.S. dollar hurts U.S. exporters but benefits U.S. importers.
Step 2: Pay attention to political and legal forces
Next you need to look at elements such as entry barriers to the market,
exchange rate controls, and other barriers such as political instability, tax
laws, safety standards, price controls, and so on.
Entry barriers can hinder your ability to export goods to a country. Examples
of some entry barriers you may encounter are tariffs and quotas. A tariff (or
duty) is a tax on goods being imported into a country. A high tariff may make
a product too expensive, eliminating a country from your consideration. 
A quota is a limit on the amount of goods from a specific country over a 
specified period of time, which can restrict your ability to sell as well.

five-character number for every export product that identifies the cate-
gory, product group, type of control, and country group level of control
as specified in the U.S. Commerce Control List. The ECCN Finder helps
exporters match Schedule B numbers with ECCN numbers to help find
items that have been flagged by the U.S. government for export control.
A Schedule B number is a U.S. Census Bureau publication based on the
Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System.

business over the next five years. International Country Risk Guides
(ICRGs) and related publications monitor 161 countries, rating a wide
range of risks to international businesses and financial institutions.
 Business Environment Risk Intelligence (http://beri.com): Business
Environment Risk Intelligence provides clients with individual country
risk reports.
Step 3: Suss out socio-cultural forces
Culture is the sum total of all the beliefs, values, rules, techniques, and insti-
tutions that characterize populations. You need to be aware of the compo-
nents of a culture (see Chapter 1), in order to make sure your product and
the country in question are a good match.

Go to www.cyborlink.com for brief descriptions of various countries’ 
populations, cultural heritages, languages, and religions. You can also find
information on do’s and don’ts when it comes to appearance, behavior, and
communication for an extensive list of countries.
Another interesting site to explore is www.countryreports.org, which
provides country information on a wide range of topics including cultural
information, customs and culture (including eating, recipes, fashion, family,
socializing, religion, sports and recreation, and holidays), geography, history,
national symbols, economy, population, and government. Costs to gain com-
plete access to the entire site are $4.75 for 5 days, $8.75 for 60 days, or $18
for one year.
Step 4: Consider competitive forces
Considering competitive forces means looking at the following:
 The number and size of competitors
 Competitors’ marketing strategies relating to promotion, pricing, and
distribution
 The quality levels of competitors’ products
 Whether competitors’ products are imported or locally produced
 The extent to which competitors’ cover the market
These are just some of the questions that management needs to evaluate per-
taining to the presence of competition in a potential market, and being able
to understand the competitor and its operations is critical in this success.
You can identify sources of competition, along with domestic production in
targeted countries, by using the Industry Sector Analysis Reports prepared
by the Department of Commerce and available at www.export.gov/
tradedata/exp_tda_trade_analysis.asp.
Making conclusions
After reviewing all the data, you have to decide which markets will allow you
to make the most effective and efficient use of your resources. In general, if
you’re new to exporting, one or two countries may be enough to start with.
Analysis is important, but there is no better option than a personal visit to
the market that appears to offer the best potential. Here are two Department
of Commerce programs that can assist you in making your initial visits to a
foreign market:
126
Part III: Identifying Your Target Market and Finding Customers 

 Matchmaker Trade Delegations: The U.S. Department of Commerce will
“match” U.S. firms with prospective agents, distributors, and other kinds
of business contacts overseas. Trade specialists evaluate the potential
of a U.S. firm’s product, find and screen contacts, and handle logistics.
This is followed by an intensive trip filled with meetings with prospec-
tive clients and in-depth briefings on the economic and business climate
of the countries visited.
 Gold Key Service: This is a program of the U.S. Commercial Service,
which assists U.S. companies in securing one-on-one appointments with
prescreened agents, distributors, sales representatives, and other strate-
gic business partners in targeted export countries. Fees for this service
can vary depending on the scope of the work and the country. As an
example, the cost for Gold Key Service for Saudi Arabia is $765 for the
first day and $385 for subsequent days.

Researching Import Markets
In This Chapter
 Researching the market at home
 Understanding your competitors and their marketing strategies
 Recognizing the benefits of trade shows, merchandise marts, and exhibition centers for
research
I
f you want to succeed as an importer, you need to understand the charac-
teristics of the buyers and the strengths and weaknesses of your competi-
tors. You need to compile data on the competition’s products and alterna-
tive marketing strategies that they’re using to satisfy the needs of their 
customers.
You can begin the process of importing without research, but research can
reduce uncertainty, providing information that you can use to make decisions
as you get started.
After you’ve identified the product that you’re going to import (see Chapter
5), you need to understand how those products are marketed in the United
States. You also need to identify who your target market is going to be and
try to identify which other business are selling similar products to your
selected market. You need to use research to determine what the competi-
tors are selling, how they’re selling it, the pricing programs they’re using,
how they’re promoting the product, and what distribution channels they’re
using (see Chapter 9).
The purpose of this chapter is to show you how to take your import product,
and use available research tools to better understand your customers and
the competitive forces in the market. I show you how to identify your target
market for your import, how you can go about looking for either a trade show
or merchandise mart in your area, and what sort of data you need to collect.

Identifying the Characteristics 
of Potential Buyers
Market research starts with identifying the target market (see Chapter 8). The
target market is a part of the market as a whole — it’s the particular group of
people you’re going to focus your attention on.
A market is comprised of individuals or organizations with needs to satisfy,
who have the authority, willingness, and desire to take advantage of the 
product that you’re selling. There are two different markets — the consumer
market and the business-to-business market. The consumer market consists
of individuals who buy goods for their own personal or household use; the
132
Part III: Identifying Your Target Market and Finding Customers 
A case study: Pewter giftware from Bolivia
I was once approached by a firm in Bolivia that
manufactured pewter giftware items. The man-
ufacturer presented me with information about
the product line and preliminary pricing levels.
Before I could decide whether I was interested
in handling the products, I had to determine how
this category of products was marketed in the
United States, as well as whether this manu-
facturer’s products were competitive and fit into
the marketplace.
My starting point with this project was to iden-
tify my target market. I decided that I would
target either gift wholesalers or some of the
larger retail stores selling giftware products.
My next step was to conduct research to deter-
mine what other firms were acting as suppliers
of pewter giftware items to my selected target
market (gift wholesalers and larger gift retail-
ers). I needed the names of these companies,
the mix of products that they were offering
(such as cups, goblets, wine glasses, candle-
stick holders, and so on), and their wholesale
and suggested retail prices.
I identified a merchandise mart in New York that
specialized in giftware items being sold to the
trade. I identified myself as the owner of a firm
involved in the giftware business and was given
a listing of exhibitors at the merchandise mart.
In the index, I identified all the firms in the build-
ing that were offering pewter giftware items in
their showrooms. Then I visited each of these
showrooms. During my visit to a showroom, I
looked at the different types of pewter it was
selling. I tried to identify whether they were
imported (and if so, what country they came
from) or manufactured domestically. During the
visit, I collected brochures and noted the
wholesale prices and suggested retail prices.
After making the rounds, I returned to my office
with a far better understanding of how the gift-
ware market worked, what sort of pewter items
were being sold, and how they were being sold.
With this data, I was able to go back to my con-
tact in Bolivia and develop an import program,
narrowing his product offerings and deciding to
focus on those items where research showed
me that he could be competitive with the com-
parable items currently in the market.

business-to-business market consists of those organizations that buy goods
for the purpose of producing another product, to resell the items to other
businesses or to consumers, or to use the goods in the operations of their
own business.
All customers in the consumer and business-to-business markets have these
three essential characteristics:
 They have a particular need. People have all kinds of needs including
basic survival needs (food, shelter), rational needs (dependability, 
durability), and emotional needs (security, friendship, acceptance).
 They have enough money to buy what you’re selling. Just because
someone wants something doesn’t mean he has enough money to buy it.
 They have decision-making power or the authority to make the 
purchase. You need to take your time and find the person who has 
the actual authority to make the choice of buying your product.
Based on these characteristics, your job as an importer is to answer the 
following three questions:
 What need does my product or service satisfy?
 Who needs and can afford what I’m offering?
 Who has the authority to say “yes” to the product or service I’m 
offering?
Your answers to these questions form the foundation of what you need to
learn from your marketing research efforts. When you know who your target
market is, you can find out more about the specific characteristics of the cus-
tomers you’re targeting by looking at their interests, ages, heritage, income
level, education, sex, family status, and occupations.
Researching Your Competitors
A critical part of market research is knowing who your competitors are. Being
aware of the strengths and weaknesses of specific competitors can help you
identify problems or opportunities that you may want to address in your own
business. Knowing what the competition does right (and wrong), what they
charge for their products or services, and where they seem to be headed can
give your business a significant boost.
You need to examine the markets on the basis of a variety of elements of
competition such as:
133
Chapter 10: Researching Import Markets

 The number and size of competitors: If you find a market that includes
a large number of competitors, you may have second thoughts and
decide to change focus or look for another product. In addition, the size
of the competitors could also a factor — if a market is dominated by one
or a few large companies, you may decide not to enter the market.
If you find the market dominated by many or a few large firms, an alter-
native strategy may be to focus on a particular niche, one that might not
be as large but may be more profitable. For example, I could decide to
import a sari, which is the traditional female garment in India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka — as opposd to focusing on women’s
clothing, a much broader category.
 The competitors’ market share (the proportion of total sales of a
product during a particular period of time in a particular market con-
trolled by a particular company): This will tell you whether the market
is dominated by key players. If a few companies control the bulk of the
market share, you may decide to direct your efforts to other products 
or markets. Or you may discover that customers are looking for another
choice because they may be unhappy with the firms that are currently
controlling the market.
 The competitors’ marketing strategies: You need to identify their 
product, pricing, promotion, and distribution strategies.
 The effectiveness of your competitors’ promotional programs:
Promotion is anything that the firm uses to inform, persuade, influence,
or remind the target market about the product it’s offering.
 The quality of your competitors’ products: How does your product
compare? Is quality a factor, and if it is, can you charge a higher price for
a higher-quality product? If the quality of your products is lower, what
will be your approach? Will you have lower prices?
 Your competitors’ pricing policies: Are they using a skimming or pene-
tration strategies? Skimming involves entering the market with high
prices placing an emphasis on profits, while penetration involves selling
the goods with low prices, placing a focus on sales volume.
 Your competitors’ distribution policies: What channels of distribution
are your competitors using? Are they dealing direct with consumers or
business buyers, or are they using intermediaries (wholesalers, retailers,
or industrial distributors)? Are your competitors offering any trade 
discounts, consignment merchandise, absorbing freight expenses, or
extending payment terms?
 The extent to which your competitors cover the market: This review
may show you that they are missing something, and it can then in turn
offer an opportunity to you.
134
Part III: Identifying Your Target Market and Finding Customers 

When you’re researching the competition, follow these steps:
1. List your key competitors.
2. Rank the competitors according to their overall strength.
3. Identify which of the companies from Step 1 is your most vulnerable
competitor.
4. List the competitive changes you anticipate in the future.
5. For each competitor in Step 1, identify the following:
• Its principal competitive strength
• Its overall marketing strategies
• The products it offers and the strengths and weaknesses of those
products
• How it is selling its products (Is it using its own sales force, or
employing the services of manufacturers’ agents?)
• The market segments it’s selling to
• The form type and amount of advertising or sales promotion it
uses
• Its pricing approach
• Any reason for customer preferences of products from a specific
company
• Whether the competitor poses any specific opportunities or
threats
Some secondary research sources that can assist you in performing this 
competitive analysis include the following:
 Trade associations and business directories: You can locate a trade
association and business directories for any industry by using the
Encyclopedia of Business Information Sources or the Encyclopedia of
Associations, both published by Gale Research. Also, The American
Wholesalers and Distributors Directory includes details on more than
18,000 wholesalers and distributors.
 Direct-mail lists: You can purchase these mailing lists for practically any
type of business. The Standard Rates and Data Service (SRDS) Directory
of Mailing Lists is a good place to start looking. This is a catalog and
directory of every commercially available mailing list, including source
details and references to the list broker and/or manager, by category.
135
Chapter 10: Researching Import Markets

This is where everybody should begin a search for the best direct-
mail lists. Most major public libraries have a current or year-old set 
of SRDS directories; some have it on computer. You can access SRDS 
at www.srds.com and, for an annual subscription fee, use all the 
SRDS directories and updates on an unlimited basis.
 Market research: Someone may already have compiled the market
research that you need. The FINDex Worldwide Directory of Market
Research Reports, Studies and Surveys (Cambridge Information Group)
lists more than 10,600 studies available for purchase (www.market
research.com). Other directories of business research include
Simmons Study of Media and Markets (Simmons Market Research
Bureau, Inc.) and the A. C. Neilsen Retail Index (A. C. Neilsen Co.).
Researching at Trade Shows 
and Merchandise Marts
Whether you’re an existing company looking for ways to expand your opera-
tions, or you’re an entrepreneur looking to start your own import business,
your company is in a precarious position. The marketplace is constantly
changing. Companies are always introducing new products or implementing
new marketing strategies. If you’re going to succeed, you need to know
what’s going on within your chosen industry segment.
As an importer, you can accomplish a lot by attending trade shows, visiting
local merchandise marts, and talking to prospective customers. At these
events and locations, companies are trying to sell products similar to the
ones that you’re interested in importing. There is no better place to access
the kind of competitive data you need — this kind of research is not time 
consuming, complex, or expensive.
A trade show is an exhibition organized so that companies in a specific 
industry can showcase and demonstrate their products and services. 
A merchandise mart is a permanent trading center or marketplace housing
manufacturers or regional wholesale showrooms, whose main goal is to 
join legitimate buyers with manufacturers and wholesalers.
I’m not suggesting that you make an investment by renting space, setting up 
a booth, and attempting to sell your products at these shows. I’m saying that
visiting a trade show as a guest and becoming a sort of detective is the best
approach. There is nothing illegal, immoral, or unethical about visiting the
booth of a company that’s currently selling a product you’re thinking about
importing yourself.
136
Part III: Identifying Your Target Market and Finding Customers 

Where to find one
You can find trade shows all over the world. Two resources you’ll want to
check out are available at most local libraries. Ask the reference librarian 
if your library has either of these books:
 Trade Shows Worldwide: An International Directory of Events,
Facilities, and Suppliers (The Gale Group) provides detailed informa-
tion from more than 75 countries on more than 10,800 trade shows and
exhibitions.
 The Directory of Business Information Resources: Association,
Newsletters, Magazines, and Trade Shows (Grey House Publishing)
provides concise information on associations, newsletters, magazines,
and trade shows for each of 90 major industry groups.
If your library doesn’t carry these books, don’t run out and buy them.
They’re very expensive, and odds are, your library has another trade show
directory that you can use instead.
In addition to checking at your local library, you can find all kinds of 
information online:
 Global Sources Trade Show Center (http://tradeshow.global
sources.com/TRADESHOW/TRADESHOW.HTM): This is a free Web site
that provides current, detailed information on more than 1,000 major
trade shows worldwide, including events within the United States, with
an emphasis on “Asia and Greater China.” You can search for a trade
show by product, supplier, country, and month of the year.
 The Javits Center (www.javitscenter.com/events/default.asp):
Located in New York City, the Javits Center is home to many trade
shows. This Web site lists upcoming shows at the center.
 biztradeshows (www.biztradeshows.com): An online directory of
trade fairs and business events brings you a detailed list of exhibitions,
trade shows, expositions, conferences, and seminars for various indus-
tries worldwide. You can search for trade shows by industry, country,
city, and date, and get information on individual trade events, along 
with their event profile, organizer, exhibitor and visitor profile, venues,
and dates.
 TSNN.com (www.tsnn.com): This is an online database that allows you
to search for trade show events by the event name, industry, city, state,
country, and date.
 Tradeshow Week (http://directory.tradeshowweek.com/

Merchandise marts are kind of like permanent trade shows. A particular
trade show is usually held once or twice a year, whereas the merchandise
marts are open year-round — possibly on a specific schedule program. If you
miss a trade show because of scheduling conflicts, a merchandise mart is a
great alternative.

What to do when you get there
When you visit a trade show or merchandise mart, you want to gather 
as much data as possible about the items you’re considering importing.
Remember: You aren’t attending the trade show to exhibit products — 
you’re there to learn about the items you want to import and how they’re
being marketed and distributed in the United States.
You want to identify exhibitors that are selling products similar to yours and
during your visit:
 Identify their marketing strategies. What is their product mix? How are
they pricing the items? What are some of their promotional programs?
How are the products being distributed?
 Determine the quality level of competitive products. How can the
products being presented at the show or in the mart compare? Is quality
a factor when the customer is making the decision to purchase?
When you visit a trade show or merchandise mart, make note of any differ-
ences between the products you want to import and those that are already in
the marketplace. You may be able to identify opportunities in the market-
place that you can take advantage of (for example, lower prices, improved
quality, unique product features, and so on).
When you’re talking to people at trade shows and merchandise marts, be
subtle. You don’t want to come right out and say, “Hey, I’m thinking of import-
ing a product like this.” You need to be a detective of sorts. In some cases,
you may get the most information by saying that you’re interested in pur-
chasing the exhibitor’s products. They won’t be eager to give away valuable
industry information, but if you say you’re a buyer, they’ll be more open to
respond to your questions.
139
Chapter 10: Researching Import Markets

Here are some questions you may want to ask:
 What are the features and/or specifications of this product?
 Where was this product made?
 What are your most recent product introductions?
 Where are your goods distributed from?
 What are your pricing policies? Do you offer credit terms, discount 
policies, promotional incentives?
Ask for brochures, catalogs, and price lists.
If after your initial conversation, you feel comfortable with the people you’ve
been talking to and if they seem comfortable with you, you may want to take
a risk and ask a more intrusive question, such as:
 Who are your suppliers and are you satisfied with them?
 Would you consider switching vendors? You might even say, “I have a
similar product that could be imported from <country name>. I’d like 
to make a sales presentation to you at your office sometime, if that’s 
possible.”
 What factors do you consider when making a decision to purchase 
an item?
Don’t overstay your welcome or take up too much of the person’s time. Be a
keen observer of her body language and tone of voice. The goal is to get
information, not annoy people.

Chapter 11
Making Export Contacts 
and Finding Customers
In This Chapter
 Finding customers in other countries
 Understanding the value of the International Company Profile
 Participating in trade missions and meeting potential customers one on one
I
n this chapter, I explain how to make contacts and find customers in other
countries for the goods that you’ve decided to export. After you’ve identified
the most promising markets and the strategies to enter them, the next step is
to actually locate the customers. If that customer is the end user of your product,
the result may be a simple transaction. On the other hand, you may need a
representative or distributor in that country to reach the eventual user.
You may be able to identify customers through attending trade shows, partic-
ipating in trade missions, or engaging in alternative promotional programs such
as direct mail. When you’re identifying contacts and developing sales leads, you
need to know who the potential buyers are, what trade shows will be most effec-
tive, and which marketing techniques will work the best.
Here I guide you through the various sources that you can use to locate cus-
tomers and evaluate trade shows and missions. Your job will be to take advan-
tage of these sources and match them with your selected products and markets.
Department of Commerce 
Business Contact Programs
The U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) assists exporters in identifying and
qualifying leads for potential customers, distributors, agents, joint venture
partners, and licensees, using both private and public sources. The DOC has 
an extensive network of foreign commercial service officers posted in countries

142
Part III: Identifying Your Target Market and Finding Customers 
around the world. These officers are product, country, and program experts in
countries representing more than 95 percent of the markets for U.S. goods.
The officers provide these services at U.S. embassies and consulates around
the world. If these offices aren’t staffed, the economic officer from the U.S.
State Department in the embassy or consulate can provide these services.
In this section, I cover the various DOC business contact programs you can
take advantage of. These programs will provide critical information about
international markets and targeted marketing services to help you evaluate
your export potential and assist you in making contacts and finding prequali-
fied buyers overseas.
If you have any questions, contact a trade specialist at the nearest DOC
Export Assistance Center (go to www.buyusa.gov/home/us.html and
enter your zip code to find the center nearest you) or call the Trade
Information Center at 800-872-8723. Information on DOC programs is also
available at www.export.gov.
International Partner Search
The International Partner Search is a customized search for qualified agents,
distributors, and representatives on behalf of a U.S. exporter — a search that
doesn’t require the exporter to travel overseas. Commercial officers based in
the consulates and embassies around the world prepare a report and deliver
detailed information on up to five prescreened international companies that
have expressed an interest in representing you after a review of your product
literature. You’re given the contact information for the agent or distributor
expressing interest in representing you, as well as some general comments
(about the reputation of the agent/distributor, his reliability, and so on).
You can get an International Partner Search application form by contacting
the trade specialist at your local Export Assistance Center. The fees will
depend on the scope of the work involved, but you should expect to pay
around $700 or $800 (possibly more, possibly less).
Commercial News USA
Commercial News USA is the official export promotion magazine for the DOC.
It provides worldwide exposure for U.S. products and services through an
illustrated magazine and Web site (www.thinkglobal.us). The magazine,
which is published in both English and Spanish editions, serves as a showcase
for American-made products and services. Each issue reaches an estimated
400,000 readers worldwide in 176 countries. You can download a PDF of the
latest issue from the Web site.

Trade leads generated by Commercial News USA can help you identify export
markets and contacts that can lead to direct sales, representation, or distrib-
utorship agreements. If you’re interested in advertising in Commercial News
USA, call 800-581-8533. Listings in Commercial News USA describe the features
of your export product or service, together with your name, address, phone
number, and e-mail address.
Commercial News USA also covers an extensive variety of industry cate-
gories, including:
 Agriculture
 Automotive/aviation and marine products
 Business services
 Consumer goods
 Electrical/electronics
 Environmental
 Franchising
 Health and beauty/fashion
 Hotel and restaurant services and suppliers
 Information technology/telecommunications
 Materials
 Medical/scientific
 Safety and security
 Sports and recreation
Pharmaceuticals, medicines, agricultural commodities, sexually oriented
products, alcoholic beverages, and arms and ammunitions are excluded from
Commercial News USA. Any items listed in the publication must be at least 51
percent U.S. content.
Customized Market Research
The Customized Market Research Program is generated by the U.S. Commercial
Service, which is the trade promotion unit of the International Trade
Administration. The U.S. Commercial Service has trade specialists in 107 U.S.
cities and in more than 80 countries that will work with your company to help
you get started in exporting or increase your sales to new global markets. The
Customized Market Research Report is an individualized response to questions
and issues related to your specific product or services. Interviews and surveys
143
Chapter 11: Making Export Contacts and Finding Customers

are conducted and provide information on the overall marketability of the
product, main competitors, competitive pricing, distribution and promotion
practices, trade restrictions, and potential business partners. Fees for such
research are subject to the scope of the work but can range from $1,000 to
$5,000 per report per country.
The Video Market Briefing service also provides market research for specific
products, together with an evaluation of alternative market entry strategies
and a formal written report. Additionally, you’ll participate in a videoconfer-
ence with local industry professionals so that you can get immediate answers
to any questions you may have.
For information on the Customized Market Research program and the Video
Market Briefing service, contact the trade counselor at your local Export
Assistance Center.
International Company Profile
The International Company Profile is a program of the U.S. Commercial Services
that checks the reputation, reliability, and financial status of a prospective
trading partner. It provides information on the type of organization, the year 
it was established, the size of the business, the business’s general reputation,
and the territory covered by the business, as well as the business’s product
lines, principal owners, preferred language, and financial/trade references. It
also provides the commercial officer’s comments regarding the suitability of
the company as a trading partner.
Many businesses use this program as their main source of information in the
final process of qualifying potential foreign clients. It can also be beneficial in
evaluating the creditworthiness of companies in the international marketplace.
For example, suppose a U.S. exporter receives a significant order from a German
importer that he knows nothing about. Or, suppose a U.S. exporter needs infor-
mation on a potential overseas sales agent, or needs to know the current product
lines of a prospective foreign distributor. Because of long distances and unfamil-
iar business practices, you need as much information about a potential partner
as possible. Before accepting this order, appointing an agent, or working with a
distributor, sound business practices require you to minimize your risks —
which you can do by acquiring an International Company Profile.
Fees for the International Company Profile depend on the scope of the work.
Contact the trade counselor at your local Export Assistance Center for an
application.

Part III: Identifying Your Target Market and Finding Customers 

Trade Opportunities Program
The Trade Opportunity Program (TOP) provides timely sales trade leads from
international companies and government agencies seeking to buy or represent
U.S. products or services that are identified by U.S. Commercial Services (USCS)
and directed to American companies electronically. The objective of TOP is to
expand U.S. exports by providing U.S. suppliers with credible, complete, and
timely trade leads gathered from reputable firms around the world. Trade leads
may be requests for manufactured goods, services, representation, investment,
joint ventures, licensing, or foreign government procurement bids. TOP is
designed to provide U.S. exporters with low cost, specific market opportunities
from overseas buyers with serious intent and the information necessary to
follow up on the leads.
All U.S. firms capable of exporting, trade associations, banks, state trade and
development agencies, chambers of commerce, export trading/management
companies, information vendors, newsletters, and other trade information
distributors are current clients of this program. TOP is promoted through the
U.S. Commercial Services and at Export Assistance Centers through their
counseling services and seminars.
Here’s how it works: U.S. and Foreign Commercial Services (US&FCS) person-
nel in overseas posts gather private and public trade leads through routine
activities such as trade shows, seminars, market research studies, International
Partner Searches (covered earlier in this chapter), and personal contacts. The
leads may be for a one-time sale or for a continuing source of supply. All trade
leads are free of charge and available through www.export.gov/tradeleads/
index.asp. If you’re interested in exploring the posted trade opportunity, you
can reply directly to the requester/buyer cited as the contact in each lead. The
trade specialists at the local Export Assistance Center will advise you of any
leads that may be of interest and provide assistance in responding to them; they
can also help you in following up to facilitate sales.
You can get access to this program by contacting your local DOC Export
Assistance Center. Go to www.export.gov/eac/index.asp for a list of
these centers.
National Trade Data Bank/Global 
Trade Directory
The National Trade Data Bank/Global Trade Directory is a service provided
by the DOC that provides market research reports, country commercial
guides, overseas contacts, trade statistics, policy and trade practices, legal
145
Chapter 11: Making Export Contacts and Finding Customers

issues relating to exporting, and so on. It’s available and updated monthly on
CD-ROM as well as online at www.stat-usa.gov. You can purchase it on a
subscription basis or use it for free at more than 1,000 federal depository
libraries throughout the country.
To find a federal depository library near you, go to www.gpoaccess.
gov/libraries.html or go to www.gpoaccess.gov and click on the
“Locate a Federal Depository Library” link in the GPO Services column.
Gold Key Service
Gold Key Service is a program that helps U.S. businesses secure one-on-one
appointments with potential prescreened business partners. The services
also include market research, on-site briefings, interpreter services for meet-
ings, and assistance in developing follow-up services.
This service is especially beneficial to firms that have an interest in expand-
ing the operations of their existing organization. The service is costly (fees
depend on the scope of the work), but the DOC will do all the preliminary
work, making sure that the time and funds spent during the visit will be used
effectively and efficiently.
Video Gold Key Service is an alternative approach to Gold Key Service. It also
includes scheduled meetings with potential business partners and an indus-
try briefing with trade professionals; however, all meetings take place
through videoconference.
You can get more information on both services by contacting the trade
specialist at your local Export Assistance Center.
Platinum Key Service
Platinum Key Service is a level above Gold Key Service (see the preceding
section). It’s a customized service that provides support on a much wider
range of issues for which you may need a more sustained level of assistance.
The services provided can include, but are not limited to, identifying markets,
introducing new products, and identifying major project opportunities.
Platinum Key Service also provides some unique options, including the
following:
 Government tender support: Many foreign governments announce
requests for quotations on a wide variety of goods. Often, these requests
come from government agencies (such as the Ministry of Health) and are
awarded through a competitive bidding process. These requests for
146
Part III: Identifying Your Target Market and Finding Customers 

quotations are a major source of business, and one of the benefits of
Platinum Key Service is that it identifies areas in which your company
may be able to participate in the bidding process.
 Assistance in the reduction of market access barriers: Many countries
decide to impose barriers to trade, to protect their domestic industries,
or to improve their balance of trade and/or payment positions. These
barriers take the form of tariffs (taxes on goods being imported into a
country), quotas (limits on the amount of a specific good that a country
will allow to be imported), or subsidies (government assistance programs).
Platinum Key Service works with the authorities to reduce these barriers
and create sales opportunities.
 Assistance on regulatory and/or technical standards matters: When
you’re doing business with other countries, you soon find out that all
countries have almost as many regulatory agencies to deal with as you
find in the United States. Platinum Key Service guides you through this
process, making you aware of all the detailed requirements that you
need to comply with in your attempt to do business internationally.
Platinum Key Service is best suited for existing businesses that are looking to
expand their operations abroad. The fees for this program are subject to the
scope of the work and the desired length of assistance (six months, one year,
and so on).
Department of Commerce 
Trade Event Programs
Depending on the nature of your product, you may have trouble selling it to a
buyer just by writing and presenting sales literature. Many buyers want to be
able to examine the product in person — in many cases, there’s just no
substitute for an actual presentation. You can make such a presentation by
participating in trade shows, trade missions, matchmaker delegations, and
catalog exhibitions.
Participating in trade fairs is a very expensive option, one that should only
be considered if you’re looking to expand the operations of your existing
business. If you’re an entrepreneur, you can also use these fairs to do some
product and market research (as opposed to exhibiting).
Many private and government-sponsored trade fairs exist. Because of the
expense involved, if you’re new to exporting you may want to consider partici-
pating in a Department of Commerce–U.S. Pavilion. Go to www.export.gov
and click on the “Trade Events” link to find information on all future DOC-
sponsored trade events or shows.
147
Chapter 11: Making Export Contacts and Finding Customers

Trade Fair Certification Program
The U.S. Commercial Service’s Trade Fair Certification Program is a cooperative
arrangement between private-sector trade-show organizers and the U.S. gov-
ernment to encourage U.S. businesses to promote their products through
participation in overseas trade shows.
Trade-show organizers may apply for Trade Fair Certification in order to offer
U.S. exhibitors the export assistance services provided by the U.S. Commercial
Service. Certified organizers are permitted to manage a U.S. Pavilion at the
trade show. These organizers focus their efforts on attracting new-to-export
small and medium-size firms, and can provide assistance on issues like freight
forwarding, Customs clearance, exhibit design, and onsite services.
Trade associations, trade-fair authorities, U.S. show organizers, U.S. cham-
bers of commerce, U.S. agents of overseas fair organizers, and other private-
sector entities that organize and manage international fairs overseas are
eligible to seek certification to organize a U.S. Pavilion.
Trade Fair Certification tells you the following about a trade fair:
 The show is an excellent opportunity for U.S. firms to market their
goods and services abroad.
 The U.S. show organizer/agent is a reliable firm capable of effectively
recruiting, managing, and building a U.S. Pavilion or organizing a group
of U.S. firms at a particular fair.
 The U.S. government is supportive of the event to potential exhibitors
and visitors, to the host country government and business community
leaders, and to foreign buyers/attendees.
You can get a description of the program, benefits, guidelines, and an application
by going to www.export.gov/static/doc_TFC_tradeevents.asp. (You
can also go to www.export.gov, click on the “Trade Event” link in the “Find
Opportunities” section, and then click on the “Trade Fair Certification” link.)
International Buyer Program
The International Buyer Program (IBP) provides support to major U.S.-based
trade shows that feature products with export potential. The U.S. Commercial
Services based in foreign consulates recruits foreign buyers to attend selected
trade shows. These trade shows are publicized through newsletters, magazines,
chambers of commerce, government agencies, and so on.
148
Part III: Identifying Your Target Market and Finding Customers 

If you’re an exporter, your chances of finding the right international business
partner is greatly increased by participating at a trade show that’s part of the
IBP. You’ll not only meet more buyers, representatives, and distributors, but
your products and services will be listed in the Export Interest Directory that
will be distributed to all international visitors.
You’ll also benefit from:
 Access to hundreds of current international trade leads in your industry
 Hands-on export counseling, marketing analysis, and matchmaking ser-
vices by country and industry experts from the U.S. Commercial Service
 Use of an onsite International Business Center, where your company can
meet privately with prospective international buyers, prospective sales
representatives, and business partners and obtain assistance from our
experienced U.S. Commercial Service staff
You can get more information on this program by going to www.export.gov,
clicking on the “Trade Event” link in the “Find Opportunities” section, and
then clicking on the “International Buyer Program” link. For a complete listing
of the U.S.-based trade shows that the commercial service officers are
recruiting foreign buyers to attend, go to www.export.gov/ibp/ibp.
asp?ReportID=IBP.
Certified trade missions
A trade mission is a group of individuals who meet with prospective overseas
customers. These missions are scheduled in specific countries to assist par-
ticipants in finding local agents, representatives, or distributors in the country.
The DOC certifies these trade missions, which are organized by state or pri-
vate trade promotion agencies. The missions can include market briefings,
appointments with prospective buyers, and opportunities to meet with high-
level government or industry officials.
You can access a current list of trade missions by product category and country
by going to www.export.gov/eac/trade_events.asp, selecting Trade
Mission from the Search by Event drop-down list, and clicking the View
Events button.
The Virtual Trade Mission service provides meetings with prescreened inter-
national firms via videoconferencing. It allows you to meet with partners with-
out the expense of traveling overseas. This program enables companies to get
149
Chapter 11: Making Export Contacts and Finding Customers

answers to their market questions in an interactive, two-hour video conference.
The program offers the following benefits to exporters:
 Opportunities to explore international markets without leaving the
United States
 Independent evaluations of your product or service
 Face-to-face meetings via video conferencing with prescreened business
partners
To set up a Virtual Trade Mission, contact the DOC Export Assistance Center
near you. To locate the nearest DOC Export Assistance Center, go to www.
export.gov/eac/index.asp.
Multistate/Catalog Exhibition Program
This program is uniquely well suited to individuals and small businesses
because it requires a much smaller investment than a trade mission or
personal visit. It presents product literature to invited interested business
prospects. If someone expresses an interest in a product, the trade lead is
forwarded directly to the U.S. exhibitor/participant.
The fees for participating in the program are nominal and include the cost of
the literature and the appropriate shipping expenses. You can get information
on the program by contacting the trade specialist at your local Export
Assistance Center.
The Export Yellow Pages
The Export Yellow Pages is a reference tool used by foreign buyers to locate
U.S. goods and services. It’s basically an electronic matchmaking or trade
contact program. The program is a public-private partnership between the
DOC’s Manufacturing and Services Unit and Global Publishers of Milwaukee,
Wisconsin.
The Export Yellow Pages lets you present your products to foreign buyers at
no cost. If you’re a manufacturer, you can register your business profile for
free at www.myexports.com. Non-manufacturers, such as freight forwarders,
sales agents, or other service firms, can register their business profiles for
free in the U.S. Trade Assistance Directory at www.myexports.com, which is
available online as a supplement within the Export Yellow Pages.

Business Information Services for 
the Newly Independent States
Business Information Services for the Newly Independent States (BISNIS) is
the DOC’s primary market information center for U.S. companies exploring
export and investment opportunities in Russia and Eurasia. BISNIS provides
U.S. companies with the latest market reports and tips on developments,
export and investment leads, and strategies for doing business in Russia and
Eurasia. You can find more information on BISNIS at www.bisnis.doc.

use by foreign firms and U.S. businesses seeking U.S. suppliers for trade-related
activities. You can find more information on these services at www.sba.gov/
tmonline or, by contacting the U.S. Small Business Administration Office of
International Trade at 202-205-7720 or www.sba.gov/oit.

Each state provides services to local firms who produce products and are
interested in exporting. Services can range from supporting trade missions to
providing counseling services.
You can locate your state-sponsored export assistance centers by going to
www.sidoamerica.org/directory/directory.aspx and clicking on
your state on the map.

Locating Customers 
for Your Imports
In This Chapter
 Taking advantage of library and online resources
 Looking at trade directories and associations
 Identifying the role of a manufacturers’ representative
 Locating representatives who can assist you in identifying 
prospects and selling products
I
n this chapter, I outline an approach you can use to identify prospective
customers in the local marketplace for the goods you’re importing. After
you’ve identified the most promising markets and identified the strategies to
enter them, the next step is to actually locate the customers. If the customer
is the end user of your product, you can have a simple transaction. If not, you
may have to reach the eventual user through an agent or distributor.
Industry Distributor Directories
After you’ve identified your target market (see Chapter 8), you need to identify
lists of prospective customers for the items you’re importing. One of the quick-
est and easiest ways to do this is through industry trade directories. Directories
are lists of firms that are involved in a particular business. They’re usually com-
piled and published by various industry trade organizations and are available
for a small fee.
So how do these directories work? Here’s an example: I had a client in Canada
who manufactured white rolled paper sticks. He manufactured and marketed
these sticks to health and beauty aid firms that manufactured cotton swabs
(such as Q-tips). My client was looking for ways to expand his business and
generate increased sales, because the cotton swab market was very stable
and potential for growth was, for the most part, nonexistent.

154
Part III: Identifying Your Target Market and Finding Customers 
My approach was to look at the product and see if I could identify a new and
different market for his product. After giving it some thought, I realized that
those rolled white paper sticks are also used in the manufacture of lollipops.
The task at hand was to identify lists of lollipop manufacturers and contact
them. But the first step was to find the names of all these manufacturers.
The Candy Buyers’ Directory (http://shop.gomc.com/Merchant2/
merchant.mv?Screen=CTGY&Store_Code=TMC&Category_Code=cbdir),
a publication of the Manufacturing Confectioner Publishing Company, is a
comprehensive reference source of candy, chocolate, confectionery, cough
drops, and so on in North America. This directory is published once a year
and lists manufacturers, sellers, and importers of these items including brand
names and products. Also included is a listing of candy brokers and specialty
brokers. Using this directory, I was able to identify all the lollipop manufactur-
ers in North America.
Almost every industry or product category has a directory. In the following
sections, I steer you toward distributor directories you can use no matter
what product you’re importing.
Encyclopedia of Business 
Information Sources
One of the best resources available in the reference section of most public
libraries is the Encyclopedia of Business Information Sources, published by GALE
Group, Inc. (www.gale.com). This publication identifies print and electronic
sources of information listed under alphabetically arranged subjects — both
industries and business concepts and practices. The listings are arranged by
type of resource (directories, online databases, periodicals, newsletters, and
trade and professional association) within each subject. Many entries also pro-
vide e-mail and Web addresses. For business managers and information
researchers, there isn’t a more targeted source for business information by
industry than the Encyclopedia of Business Information Sources.
Using my candy manufacturer example from earlier in the chapter, I went to
the library, asked the reference librarian for the Encyclopedia of Business
Information Sources, opened it up to the candy industry, scrolled down to the
listing of directories, and noted the following:
Candy Buyers’ Directory. Manufacturing Confectioner Publishing
Company. Annual. Lists confectionary and snack manufacturers by cate-
gory and brand name.
You can do this for any industry. The encyclopedia includes listings of more
than 1,100 business, financial, and industry topics. So, you won’t have any
difficulty finding any industry directory for the products you’ve chosen to
deal in.

The Directory of United States Importers
The Directory of United States Importers is a publication of Commonwealth
Business Media, Inc. It provides a geographical and product listing of U.S.
importers. You can locate an importer by product, company name, or
geographic region.
The listings provide information on the products, as well as the countries with
which these importers are currently doing business. You can use this list to iden-
tify companies that are currently importing products that you’re interested in
but that aren’t importing them from a country where you’ve identified a supplier.
Here’s an example: I was contacted by a firm in Bolivia that was able to supply
me with Alpaca fiber, which is used for making knitted and woven blankets,
sweaters, hats, gloves, scarves, textiles, sweaters, coats, and bedding. My next
task was to find customers for this product. Using the product index of The
Directory of United States Importers, I was able to identify firms in the United
States importing Alpaca and all the other wool products. The company lists in
the directory include information not just on the products being imported, but
where they’re importing from. So after I developed the list of wool importers
from The Directory of United States Importers, I eliminated those firms that were
doing business with Bolivia. All the remaining firms on the list were potential
customers that I could contact with my offering.
You can use this process for any product that you want to import. It’s a
simple and easy way to find customers, and you’ll find that many times
people who are importing are also always actively seeking alternative
sources of supply.
This and its sister publication — The Directory of United States Exporters —
can be found in the reference section of many public libraries.
The directories are annual publications. You can often find used copies for
sale at used bookstores (including Amazon.com). In 2007, I bought the 2005
edition for $20. (The new version retails for $850.)
Encyclopedia of Associations
Companies that manufacture similar products or offer similar services often
belong to industry associations. These associations help resolve problems
between their member companies and consumers. Most also provide consumer
information and education materials through publications and on their Web
sites.
155
Chapter 12: Locating Customers for Your Imports

If you’ve selected a product to import, and you’ve identified the type of com-
pany that you would target, you can contact the industry association and try
to get your hands on the membership roster, which can serve as your list of
prospective customers.
You can identify the industry association, simply by using the Encyclopedia of
Business Information Sources (earlier in this chapter), or you can visit the
local library and ask the reference librarian if she has the Encyclopedia of
Associations, published by GALE Group (www.gale.com).
I had to source information about a solar energy product called Photovoltaic
Systems. I didn’t have much information on the product or the industry, so I
used the Encyclopedia of Associations, went to the solar energy listing, and
scrolled down to the trade/professional associations. I identified several
alternatives, including the Solar Energy Industry Association in Washington,
D.C. When I contacted them, I found a wealth of very valuable information.
You can do this for any industry.
Salesman’s and Chain 
Store Guides Directories
If you’re an importer, you can also find buyers through the Salesman’s Guides
and Chain Store Guides. These directories are available either in a print or CD
version through Forum Publishing Company, 383 E. Main St., Centerport, NY
11721 (phone: 800-635-7654; Web: www.forum123.com). These guides are
detailed lists of customers for a wide variety of products that can be imported.
Salesman’s Guides
Salesman’s Guides enable you to
 Identify prospects most likely to buy, as well as discover price ranges of
the products carried by these prospects.
 Customize your products offerings and presentations to potential
customers based on geographic location, product specialty sales
volume, size, or price range.
 Coordinate a successful product mix (see Chapter 8) by conferring with
your target buyers. This type of customer feedback will then let you
build a catalog of items the market prefers.

Manufacturer’s Agents 
National Association
A manufacturer’s agent or manufacturer’s representative is an independent
agent wholesaling organization, responsible for selling all or part of a firm’s
products in an assigned geographical territory. The firms are independent and
not employees of the manufacturer. They’re used extensively in the distribution
of products and usually have contractual arrangements with the companies
they represent. An agent will usually represent several noncompeting manufac-
turers of related products.
Many new firms have limited financial resources and don’t have the ability to
hire their own sales force. Using these representatives can be a cost-effective
alternative, because they’re paid a commission only for what they actually sell.
Even if you’re an importer, not a manufacturer, these individuals still can 
represent you if you have products that are comparable to their current 
representations.
159
Chapter 12: Locating Customers for Your Imports

With a little bit of research, you’ll be able to locate agents or representatives
who can work with you. There are several options, one of which is to use the
previously mentioned Encyclopedia of Business Information Sources, go to
your chosen industry classification, and look at available resources, either
directories or periodicals, as in many instances agents will be listed in direc-
tories or trade periodicals.
Another online resource is the Membership Based Manufacturer’s Agent
National Association (MANA). You can learn more about their services at
www.manaonline.org. MANA is an online source of information for compa-
nies that want to outsource their sales effort. The organization is member-
ship based, and requires you to complete an application for associate
membership. The annual dues are $399 and include access to the member
area of the Web site where you find the online directory, the contracts pack-
age, commission survey results, and an archive of Agency Sales magazine arti-
cles sorted by subject. Membership also includes the counseling benefit and
discounts on the seminars, ads, and printed publications. The online direc-
tory is a searchable database that allows you to identify agents either by ter-
ritory, product, and customers served.
How It Works
Let’s say you’re interested in importing foodservice supplies from Korea.
You’ve identified a supplier in Korea that can provide a quality line of products
used in the foodservice industry (which includes restaurants, supermarkets,
convenience stores, and so on). After you’ve developed a list of products that
you’ll be importing, you have to figure out how and from whom these goods
are purchased by the restaurants, supermarkets, and so on.
Your first visit is to the library, where you’ll look at The Encyclopedia of Business
Information Sources. You look there for the foodservice industry listings. You
identify that there is a Directory of Food Service Distributors, published by Chain
Store Guides. The publication is available both in a print and online format and
includes an exhaustive list of distributors of food and equipment to restaurants
and other foodservice establishments. You acquire this directory, select a
region, and do a direct-mail campaign offering your products. (Direct mail is
one option. Having a sales representative contact them and make formal
presentations is even better.)
Wanting to learn more about the industry, you go back into The Encyclopedia
of Business Information Sources, now looking under periodicals. You see that
Reed Business Information publishes the Food and Equipment Supplies
Magazine. You’re thinking about subscribing, so you call the publisher and
ask for a sample copy.
160
Part III: Identifying Your Target Market and Finding Customers 

When reviewing the magazine, you’re able to identify in its classified section
an organization referred to as Manufacturer’s Agents for the Food Service
Industry (MAFSI; www.mafsi.org). MAFSI is not-for-profit association for
independent manufacturers’ representative agencies and the manufacturers
they represent in the foodservice equipment and supplies industry.
You contact MAFSI and purchase a copy of its membership directory avail-
able in a printed or online format. You review this membership roster and
identify agents who are already representing noncompeting manufacturers of
your products.
When you’ve developed a list of prospective agents, you can contact them
either by phone or mail and try to determine their interest in acting as a rep-
resentative. To make it more interesting for them to evaluate your proposal,
you design an introductory commission-based incentive package that they
should find appealing.
You can do this for almost any industry.

A
fter you’ve decided what to sell and where to sell it, you have to set a
price for your product. The price of your product must be high enough
to generate an acceptable profit (after all, that’s why you’re in business), but
low enough to be competitive (otherwise, no one will buy what you’re selling).
Pricing your product properly is key — and so is submitting the quotation to
your client in the correct format. If your quotation is haphazardly completed,
it may lead to an immediate rejection — and a loss not just to the current sale
but also future ones.
When you’re preparing an export quotation, you need to select the term of
sale and the appropriate method of payment. Plus, you need to understand
international shipping terms. I cover pricing, terms of sale, and pro forma
invoices (the invoices used to quote your price to the prospective seller) in
this chapter. For more on methods of payment, turn to Chapter 14.

Pricing Your Exports
When you’re trying to determine the price for your product in other countries,
answer the following questions:
 Are you trying to penetrate a market for long-term growth, or are you
looking for an outlet for excess inventory or outdated products? Do you
want to develop the market for the long term, or are you just looking to
make a one-time sale? If you’re in it for the long run, you may want to
follow a more aggressive pricing approach. If you have some excess or
outdated inventory, you may consider selling them at reduced costs, just
to move the goods and reduce warehousing expenses.
 At what price should you sell your product in the foreign market? If
you’re also selling the products locally, what relation will the export
price have in relation to the domestic price? You have to decide whether
the price will be higher, lower, or the same as the domestic price. If
you’re in it for the short term, you may want to focus on a higher price;
if you’re in it for the long run, attempting to develop the market, you
may want to pursue a more aggressive or lower pricing approach.
 What type of image do you want to convey to your customer in relation
to competitive products and other products that you may be offering?
You need to decide what image you want your product to have relative to
your competitors. You can decide to present a high-quality image (which
would be reflected in a higher price) or you may want to be seen as a
lower-cost alternative (which would be reflected with a lower price).
 What price accurately reflects the level of the product’s quality? If
you’re selling a higher-quality product than your competitors are, that
should be reflected in the price.
 Is the price competitive? You need to be realistic with your price.
Remember: When you’re exporting, competition will come from local
manufacturers in the country you’re exporting to, from other U.S. manu-
facturers also exporting products to that country, and from exporters
from countries other than the United States.
 Will you place a greater emphasis on the profit or the sales volume?
You have to decide what’s the more important objective, profits or sales.
If you’re more interested in profit, you’ll pursue a skimming strategy; on
the other hand, if you want to place an emphasis on sales, a penetration
strategy is in order (see Chapter 8 for more on skimming and penetration
strategies).
 Should you include any discounts or allowances to the customer? Will
you give consideration to offering cash, quantity, seasonal discounts, or
trade discounts?
166
Part IV: International Trade Procedures and Regualations 

 To what extent will changes in prices affect the demand for the product?
The consumer market demand is affected by changes in prices — the
lower the price, the more the consumer will buy. In the business market,
changes in price rarely impact the level of demand.
The consumer market is that particular group of people who have the
authority, willingness, and desire to take advantage of the product that
you’re offering for their own personal use. The business market is one
business selling goods to another business; the business is purchasing
those goods to produce another product, to resell it, or to use it in the
operations of their business. (See Chapter 8 for more on the consumer
and business-to-business markets.)
Consider any additional costs that are the responsibility of the importer,
such as duties, Customs fees, and possible currency fluctuation costs. The
keys to a successful quotation are understanding the relationship of the
domestic price to the export price, and understanding the corresponding
terms of sale that are used in international transactions (see “Setting the
Terms of Sale,” later in this chapter).
If your price is too high, your product won’t sell. On the other hand, if your
price is to low, it’ll create a loss. The key elements of selecting the proper
price are costs, market demand, and competition, all of which I cover in the
following sections.
Costs
If you’re a manufacturer, an accurate computation of your costs of goods is a
key element in determining whether exporting is a viable option. However,
when many manufacturing firms that are new to exporting add on the additional
administrative costs, freight forwarding, shipping and Customs charges, and so
on, they realize that their price is no longer competitive.
The key for many manufacturers is to not use this cost-plus approach, but to
look at exporting as an opportunity to open up new markets for additional
sales, generating revenues, and spreading the fixed costs over a larger base
of sales.
On the other hand, if you aren’t a manufacturer, and you’re operating as an
export management company (see Chapter 1), your costs will be based on
negotiations with a manufacturer. When you’re negotiating a price with the
manufacturer, you must stress the importance of being competitive. Tell 
the manufacturer that this will be an opportunity for the manufacturer to
generate new sales in areas it may have previously ignored. In other words,
keeping the costs down benefits not just you, but the manufacturer as well; if
the manufacturer, buys into this idea, you have a better chance of getting
your products for a competitive price.
167
Chapter 13: Making the Sale: Pricing, Quotes, and Shipping Terms

When contacting suppliers (see Chapter 7), negotiate with several firms, and
don’t stop negotiating after you get an initial offer from your first contact. You’ll
always find more than one company that can manufacture your product, and
some manufacturers take a more competitive approach in negotiating with you.
The price you negotiate ultimately reflects your quotation to your client.
Market demand
Demand for your product is a function of the number of consumers; the con-
sumers’ tastes, attitudes, and ability to pay; and whether competitive prod-
ucts exist. These factors won’t be identical in any two markets — each
market is unique. For this reason, you’ll likely need to charge different prices
in each market in which you sell.
When dealing in consumer goods, per capita income is a gauge of what the
customer can pay.
Some popular items (for example, major branded items) may create a
stronger demand than anticipated by the characteristics of the market and
may not have an effect on prices (even low-income markets will not affect the
selling price). However, keeping products simple (offering alternatives to
name-brand items) to reduce your selling price may be an answer to selling in
some of these lower per capita income markets.
The affordability of your products is also a function of the fluctuations in the
exchange rates. As the value of a currency increases in relation to the currency
of another country, the price of the exported product will increase. A decrease
in the value of the currency will reduce the price to the foreign customer.
Competition
In setting prices, take note of competitors’ prices. The number of competitors
and the way they compete will differ from country to country, so you need to
evaluation each market separately. In addition to competing with other firms
from your own country, you’re likely also competing with local companies
(that is, companies that are located in the market where you want to do busi-
ness) as well as other multinationals from places like Europe and Asia.
If there are multiple competitors in a foreign market, you may have no alter-
native but to reduce your export price to match the price of your competi-
tion. However, if your product is new to the market, you may be able to
charge a higher price.
168
Part IV: International Trade Procedures and Regualations 

Setting the Terms of Sale
In any sales agreement, you need to provide not only the price but also a cor-
responding term of sale. Terms of sale are the conditions of sale that clarify
who is responsible for what expenses, as the goods move from the seller to
the buyer. Terms of sale are an area of concern for many businesses that are
just beginning to export, because international terms of sale can differ from
those used in domestic sales.
As an exporter, you need to become familiar with Incoterms, the universal
trade terminology developed by the International Chamber of Commerce
(ICC). These terms were created to describe the responsibilities of the
exporter and importer in international trade. Understanding and using these
terms correctly are important, because any misunderstanding may prevent
you from living up to your contractual obligations and make you accountable
for shipping expenses that you had initially intended to avoid.
A complete list of important terms and their definitions is provided in ICC
Guide to Incoterms 2000. You can order it online for $82.50 at www.icc
booksusa.com or by calling 212-703-5066.
In the following list, I cover shipping terms that are common in all interna-
tional transactions. You’ll use these terms when making quotations as an
exporter or receiving quotations as an importer. The terms will identify what
specific expenses are the responsibility of the buyer and seller. (See Figure
13-1 for a graphical representation of terms of sale.)
The terms in international business transactions often sound similar to those
used in domestic business, but they can have very different meanings.
Confusion over terms of sale can often result in either a loss of a sale or a loss
on a sale. So make sure you know the meaning of the terms you’re using.
 Cost and freight (C&F): Cost and freight means that the exporter is
responsible for all costs and freight expenses necessary to bring the cargo
to the destination named in the shipping term. The importer would then
simply be responsible for any unloading charges, Customs clearance fees,
and inland freight expenses as the cargo moves from the pier to the
importer’s warehouse. Title (risk of loss or damage) is transferred from
the exporter to the importer as the goods pass the ship’s rail in the port
of shipment.
 Cost, insurance, and freight (CIF): Cost, insurance, and freight is similar
to C&F (see the preceding bullet) with the exception that the exporter is
responsible for procuring marine cargo insurance against loss or damage
as the goods are transported from the point of origin to the point of
destination.
169
Chapter 13: Making the Sale: Pricing, Quotes, and Shipping Terms

 Delivered duty paid (DDP): Delivered duty paid, followed by the words
naming the importer’s premises, means that the price includes all
expenses as the cargo moves from the seller’s factory to the buyer’s
warehouse. With this term, the exporter bears the full cost and risk
involved in moving the cargo from the factory to the destination.
This term represents the maximum obligation for the exporter.
 Ex-quay: Ex-quay means that the exporter is required to make the goods
available to the importer on the quay (wharf or pier) at the destination
named in the sales contract. At that point, title transfers from the
exporter to the importer.
 Ex-works (EXW): The term ex-works means that the exporter’s only
responsibility is to make the good available at the edge of the loading
dock of its facility. For a price quoted using this term, the exporter is not
responsible for the loading of the good onto a truck provided by the
importer, unless doing so is otherwise agreed to. The importer bears the
full cost and risk involved in moving the cargo from the factory to the
destination. EXW represents the minimum obligation for the exporter.
Whenever, you provide the EXW term of sales, all expenses in moving
the cargo from the point of origin to the destination is the responsibility
of the importer. The additional costs could include transportation of the
cargo to the point of shipment, loading charges, ocean or air freight
charges, unloading at the destination, Customs fees, and inland trans-
portation expenses to the destination. These charges will either go for-
ward and be collected by the carrier at the destination, or they can be
additional charges added to the invoice.
 Free alongside ship (FAS): Free alongside ship is the term used to indi-
cate that the exporter is responsible for all expenses as the goods are
transported from the factory to edge of the ship’s loading dock. Any
expenses beyond that point are the responsibility of the importer.
 Free on board (FOB): Free on board is the term used to indicate that the
exporter is responsible for all expenses as the cargo is transported to
the pier and then loaded onto the vessel at the point of shipment named
in the sales contract. Any expenses beyond that point are the responsi-
bility of the importer.
 Free on board (FOB) airport: Under free on board airport, the exporter
is responsible for all expenses in transporting the cargo from the factory
to the carrier at the airport of departure, and risk of loss or damage is
transferred from the exporter to the importer when the goods have been
delivered to the carrier. Any additional expenses from the airport to the
destination are the responsibility of the importer.
170
Part IV: International Trade Procedures and Regualations 

When quoting a price, make the term meaningful to the importer. For example,
don’t quote your price on a product as “Ex-works Smithtown, New York,” which
may be meaningless to a prospective foreign buyer. The prospective buyer
would probably find it difficult to compute the total costs and then may hesitate
in placing an order. Whenever possible, quote C&F, because it shows the buyer
the cost of getting the product near the destination. To compute the C&F price,
you need to know the specific quantities that will be purchased. If that informa-
tion isn’t available, then you should quote using the term FAS or FOB.
A freight forwarder can provide assistance in computing freight expenses.
Filling Out the Paperwork: Quotations
and Pro Forma Invoices
Many international inquiries begin with a request for quotation, and the pre-
ferred form that an exporter uses to submit a quotation is referred to as a pro
forma invoice, which is a quotation in invoice format. (You can see a sample
of this invoice at www.unzo.com/basicguide/figure11.html.) Pro
forma invoices are used by importers when applying for an import license,
arranging for financing, or applying for a letter of credit.
The quotation on the pro forma invoice form should include the following:
 Names and addresses of the exporter (seller) and importer (buyer)
 Any reference numbers
Exporter
Ex-works
Importer
Ocean
FAS
FOB Airport
C&F
CIF
Ex-Quay
FOB

 Listing and description of products
 Itemized list of prices for each individual item being sold
 Net and gross shipping weights (using metric units when appropriate)
 Dimensions for all packages (total cubic volume, again using metric unit
when appropriate)
 Any potential discounts
 Destination delivery point
 Terms of sale
 Terms of payment

 Total to be paid by the importer
 Estimated shipping date
 Currency of sale
 Statement certifying that the information found on this pro forma
invoice is true and correct
 Statement that provides the country of origin of the goods
The pro forma invoice must be clearly marked pro forma invoice. If a specific
price is being guaranteed, the period during which the offer remains valid
must be clearly stated. Also, the quotation should clearly state that prices are
subject to change without notice. For example, increases in fuel costs may
cause unanticipated increases in freight rates on the part of the carriers.

f you’re an exporter, and you want to be successful in today’s global
marketplace, you have to offer your customers attractive sales terms (see
Chapter 13) and appropriate methods of payment to secure their business.
You want to make sure that you’ll get paid, at the same time that you minimize
your own risk and accommodate the needs of your buyer.
If you’re an importer, you need to negotiate a payment term that minimizes
your risk, with assurances that the goods received are exactly as ordered, on
time, and in good condition.
The exporter wants payment as soon as possible, ideally as soon as the order
is placed and before the goods are shipped to the importer. The importer wants
to receive the goods as soon as possible, while delaying payment as long as
possible, ideally until after he’s sold the goods.
In this chapter, I fill you in on the various methods of payment and let you
know which options are best for you if you’re an exporter and which are best
for you if you’re an importer.

and Analyzing Their Risks
Any international transaction involves risk. You need to understand what
those risks are and what actions you can take to minimize them. The primary
payments used in international transactions are
 Cash in advance: This means that the exporter will receive his money in
advance of making the shipment.
 Letter of credit drawn at sight: This is a document issued by the
importer’s bank guaranteeing that the exporter will get paid, just as long
as he presents required documents to the bank before an expiration date.
 Time letter of credit: This is the same as the letter of credit drawn at
sight except that the exporter will get the money a certain number of
days after the documents have been presented and accepted.
 Bill of exchange (documentary collections): This is like buying some-
thing using cash on delivery (COD) except the importer makes the pay-
ment when the required documents are presented, instead of when the
goods are received. There are two types of bills of exchange:
• Sight draft documents against payment: The importer pays when
the documents are presented.
• Sight draft documents against acceptance: The importer makes the
payment a certain number of days after he has accepted the
documents.
 Open account: With this method, no bank is involved in the transaction.
The exporter sends the documents to the importer and trusts that the
importer will send him the money.
 Consignment: The exporter ships the goods, and the importer only has
to remit payment for them after the goods have been sold and the
importer gets paid from his customer.
Figure 14-1 illustrates the relationship of these payment methods to the amount
of risk for buyers (importers) and sellers (exporters). For the exporter, cash in
advance is the most favorable, and consignment is the least favorable. On the
other hand, for the importer, consignment is most favorable, and cash in
advance is the least favorable.
In the following sections, I cover each of the main methods of payment in
more detail.
174
Part IV: International Trade Procedures and Regualations 

Cash in advance
Cash in advance is the most desirable method of payment from the point of
view of the exporter, because he has immediate use of the money and no
problems coordinating collection with the banks or shipping companies. This
is particularly true if the payment is made by wire transfer; if the payment is
made by check, delays may be involved as the check clears.
If you’re an importer, you may hear the exporter from another country
request terms of “TT.” This stands for telex transfer, and it’s the same thing as
a bank-to-bank wire transfer (or cash in advance).
Cash in advance creates cash-flow problems and increased risk for the importer.
So, although cash in advance looks great from where the exporter is standing,
it’s probably not going to be competitive — the importer will likely refuse to
make a payment until the merchandise is received and inspected.

Chapter 14: Methods of Payment

Letter of credit
Importers may be concerned that if they make a payment in advance, the
goods may not be shipped, or the quality of the goods may be inferior, and
they’ll be left holding the bag. To protect the interests of both parties, letters
of credit are often used.
Before you start talking with overseas suppliers or customers, you need to be
aware of some of the terminology that’s used when it comes to letters of credit:
 Confirmed letter of credit: A confirmed letter of credit is one whose
validity has been confirmed by a bank in the exporter’s country. After
the letter of credit is confirmed, the exporter is guaranteed payment
even if the foreign buyer or bank defaults. From the exporter’s point of
view, foreign political risk is also eliminated, because the seller receives
the payment as soon as the documents are presented.
 Irrevocable letter of credit: An irrevocable letter of credit cannot be
amended or canceled without the agreement of all parties — the benefi-
ciary (exporter), the applicant (importer), the issuing bank, and the con-
firming bank, if the letter of credit is confirmed. A credit should clearly
indicate whether it is revocable or irrevocable; however, in the absence
of such indication, the credit is deemed to be irrevocable.
If you’re an exporter, always start negotiations by asking that payment
be made by a confirmed and irrevocable letter of credit. This will protect
you against all commercial and political risks. If you’re an importer, keep
in mind that, unless the supplier has a long-term relationship with you,
almost all initial transactions will require that you make payment by a
confirmed and irrevocable letter of credit.
 Revocable letter of credit: As an importer or exporter, you’ll almost always
encounter the term irrevocable when someone mentions letter of credit pay-
ment terms. Still, a revocable letter of credit does exist. A revocable letter of
credit may be amended or canceled by the issuing bank at any time without
prior notice to the beneficiary, up to the moment of payment. It is generally
used when the applicant and the beneficiary are affiliated parties or sub-
sidiary companies.
If you’re an exporter, do not accept a revocable letter of credit as a
method of payment. If you do, the importer has the option of canceling
the transaction at any time.
 Transferable letter of credit: A transferable letter of credit is one that
allows the beneficiary to request that the issuing bank or another bank
authorized by the issuing bank make the funds from the credit available
in whole or in part to one or mort other parties. Funds can only be trans-
ferred when the bank issuing the letter of credit designates it as a
transferable letter of credit.
176
Part IV: International Trade Procedures and Regualations 

 Back-to-back letter of credit: A back-to-back letter of credit is a method
of financing used when an exporter is not supplying the goods directly.
In other words, the exporter is not a manufacturer but is acting as an
export management company (see Chapter 1) or as an export agent (see
Chapter 2). The exporter, upon receipt of the irrevocable letter of credit
drawn in his favor, arranges to have the advising bank issue a second
irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the supplier from whom the goods
are being purchased. In other words, the exporter is using a portion of
the proceeds due from the letter of credit as collateral for the second
letter of credit.
Say you’re selling (to a client in Saudi Arabia) $20,000 of disposable
medical supplies, which you’ll be purchasing from Medical Products
Manufacturer in Boston for $15,000. The client in Saudi Arabia has agreed
to open up a $20,000 letter of credit in your favor for the purchase of
these supplies. The manufacturer in Boston won’t extend personal credit
to you — it wants guarantees that it’ll get paid. So, you can instruct the
advising bank in New York, using the initial credit as collateral, to open
up a second letter of credit in the amount of $15,000 in favor of the manu-
facturer in Boston. You ship the goods, and all required shipping documents
are presented to the advising/confirming bank. Upon acceptance of these
documents by the bank, the bank remits $15,000 to the manufacturer in
Boston and the balance of $5,000 to you.
An exporter can only do this if the advisee has initially designated the
letter of credit as transferable.
There are two main types of letters of credit: the letter of credit drawn at sight
and the time letter of credit. I cover each of these in the following sections.
Letter of credit drawn at sight
A letter of credit drawn at sight is a document issued by the importer’s bank, in
which the bank promises to pay the exporter a specified amount when the
bank has received certain documents stipulated in the letter of credit before
a listed expiration date. Figure 14-2 illustrates the process of a letter of credit
drawn at sight.
For the sake of explanation, here’s the situation I’m using as an example: The
importer in New York, called ABC Importing, is interested in purchasing 300
dozen sweaters from a supplier in Japan, as detailed on purchase orders 1234
and 1235. The supplier (exporter) in Japan is XYZ International, based in Tokyo.
The value of this purchase is $30,000. The terms of payment are going to be
FOB Japan (see Chapter 13).
ABC Importing completes the application for a commercial letter of credit
from its bank and is called the applicant; the exporter in Japan, XYZ
International, is called the beneficiary.
177
Chapter 14: Methods of Payment

Here’s how the transaction plays out:
1. ABC Importing applies for the letter of credit with its bank in New
York (see Figure 14-3).
Looking at the application, note the following:
• The letter of credit number assigned by the importer’s 
bank in New York.
• The advising bank in Tokyo, Japan.
• The name and address of the applicant, ABC Importing Company,
New York.
• The name and address of the beneficiary of the proceeds of this
letter of credit in Japan, XYZ International.
• The amount of the letter of credit (US$30,000).
• The last date for presentation of documents for payment to the
bank in Japan (May 15, 2008).
• The last date for presentation of documents at the bank in New
York (May 15, 2008).

Part IV: International Trade Procedures and Regualations 

• A request by the importer to issue an irrevocable letter of credit in
favor of the beneficiary (XYZ International), and the methods by
which the letter of credit will be delivered.
• A description of the merchandise must be described as it must
appear on the invoice (300 dozen of women’s sweaters as detailed
on order numbers 1234 and 1235).
• Terms of sale, listed as FOB Japan.
• A listing of documents accompanying the draft submitted. These
will be documents that will be required to be presented to the con-
firming bank in Japan: (1) a commercial invoice (original and three
copies), and (2) a full set of original onboard ocean bills of lading
marked “Freight Collect.”
• The fact that the importer has the right to either permit or prohibit
partial shipments or transshipments. If you prohibit partial ship-
ments, the exporter must ship the entire order at one time; if you
prohibit transshipments, the exporter must place the goods on the
vessel that will deliver the goods to the port of destination — in
other words, the goods cannot be unloaded and placed on another
vessel for shipment to the destination.
• Latest date for shipment from the port in Japan.
The applicant (ABC Importing) takes this completed application and
$30,000 to its bank in New York. ABC is giving the money to its bank for
the purchase of the sweaters, together with instructions that the funds
are to be released to the beneficiary (XYZ International) when the listed
required documents are presented to the bank, prior to the expiration of
the letter of credit. The required documents are the commercial invoice
and the full set of onboard ocean bills of lading marked “Freight Collect.”
Today, all banks allow you to complete this application process online.
2. The bank accepts this application and the proceeds for the letter of
credit, and sends the irrevocable letter of credit to the bank in Japan,
requesting a confirmation.
Figure 14-4 shows a copy of the negotiable letter of credit. The information
on the application (refer to Figure 14-3) has been transferred to the

3. The bank in Japan presents the negotiable letter of credit to the bene-
ficiary (exporter), XYZ International.
XYZ International is now in possession of a negotiable document that
states that it will receive US$30,000 when the shipment of sweaters has
been forwarded to the shipping company and placed onboard the
vessel, and when all required documents are presented to the bank in
Japan before the expiration date. XYZ is a very happy exporter, because
it knows that the money is in the bank.
4. The exporter (XYZ) reviews all the conditions listed on the letter of
credit.
XYZ contacts its freight forwarder to confirm that the goods can be
shipped prior to the expiration date. If XYZ is not able to comply with
one or more of the conditions, it will alert the importer (ABC) immedi-
ately, with a request to have the letter of credit amended.
5. The exporter (XYZ) arranges with the freight forwarder to deliver the
goods to the appropriate port of shipment.
When transferring the cargo to the freight forwarder, the exporter will
usually prepare the shipper’s letter of instructions. The shipper’s letter
of instructions is just that — a letter from the shipper instructing the
freight forwarder on how and where to send the export shipment. The
instructions consist of the following:
• The name and address of the exporter.
• The exporter’s IRS employer identification number (EIN) or Social
Security number (SSN), if no EIN has been assigned.
• The name and address of the person or company to whom the
goods are shipped (known as the ultimate consignee).
• The name and address of the authorized forwarder acting as the
forwarding agent for the exporter.
• The name of the transportation company responsible for moving
the cargo from the loading dock of the exporter to the point of
shipment (known as the inland carrier).
• The country in which the merchandise is to be consumed, further
processed, or manufactured (known as the final country of destina-
tion or the country of ultimate destination).
• The shipper’s reference number with the freight forwarder.
• The date the shipment is sent to the forwarder.
• The method of shipment required.
• The numbers and kinds of packages (boxes, barrels, or cases) and
any descriptive marks, numbers, or other identification shown on
the packages.
182
Part IV: International Trade Procedures and Regualations 

• The gross shipping weight (in pounds) of the commodities being
shipped, not including the weight of the shipping container.
• The selling price, or cost if not sold, of the number of items
recorded in the quantity field when they were sold by the vendor
to the purchaser.
• Whether the shipper (prepaid) or consignee (collect) will pay
freight charges. If the shipment is to be paid for cash on delivery
(COD) by the consignee, specify the amount.
• Any special instructions, such as a specific carrier to be used, spe-
cial electronic mail notification, required certifications, and so on.
• Instruction to the forwarder on how to dispose of the shipment in
the event it proves to be undeliverable abroad.
• An indication of whether the shipper wants to use an insurer
chosen by the freight forwarder, if insurance is required. The insur-
ance amount is usually 110 percent of the shipment value.
6. After the goods are loaded and placed onboard the vessel for ship-
ment to New York, the freight forwarder completes the necessary doc-
umentation and receives the necessary documentation from the
shipping carrier.
The key document returned to the forwarder is the original set of
onboard ocean bills of lading, consigned to the order of the bank, and
marked “Notify Applicant — ABC Importing Company, New York.”
The bill of lading is the key document in this transaction. It serves as a
receipt issued by the shipping company that a shipment has been received
and loaded onboard the vessel for shipment to the port of destination
(in this case, New York). The bill of lading will also be required by the
importer (ABC Importing) in order to clear the goods through Customs
and receive them from the shipping company.
7. The exporter (or the freight forwarder) presents the documents, evi-
dencing full compliance with the terms of the letter of credit, to the
exporter’s bank in Japan.
8. The bank reviews the documents to make sure they are in order and
have been presented prior to the expiration date. If everything is in
order, the bank releases the moneys to the exporter, XYZ
International.
If the bank finds any discrepancies, this will cause a delay in the exporter’s
receipt of the money. If the discrepancies are not corrected, the confirming
bank in Japan is not allowed to release the funds. Here are the discrepancies
that can cause such delays:
• Documents presented after the expiration date
• Documents presented more than 21 days after shipment or other
date as noted in the letter of credit
183
Chapter 14: Methods of Payment

• Missing documents (such as bills of lading, inspection certificates,
and so on)
• A difference between the description of the merchandise on the
invoice and the description noted in the letter of credit
• A difference in the shipping terms from those specified in the letter
of credit
• Unauthorized transshipment
• Shipment made after the date specified in the letter of credit
• Problems with the onboard bills of lading (for example, improperly
endorsed, improperly consigned, or stating that the goods or ship-
ping containers are damaged)
• Drafts and invoices not made out in the name of the applicant as
shown on the letter of credit
9. The documents are returned to the importer (the applicant — ABC
Importing) via its bank.
10. The importer (ABC Importing) submits the documents to a Customs
broker (an individual who is licensed to transact Customs business on
behalf of others).
The Customs broker’s responsibilities include the coordination of clear-
ing the goods through Customs and arranging to have the goods deliv-
ered to the importer.
11. In order to have the shipping company release the goods to the
Customs broker, the broker must return the original bill of lading
back to the shipping carrier.
The shipping company will only release the cargo when the bill of lading
is returned to them. Without the onboard ocean bill of lading, the shipping
company will not release the cargo.
12. After the Customs broker receives the goods, the goods are transported
and delivered to the importer (ABC Importing).
This payment term is called a letter of credit drawn at sight, because the bank
releases the funds to the exporter upon seeing the documents. Bank fees are
the responsibility of the importer and are usually a percentage of the amount
of the letter of credit. The percentage charge is based on the bank’s policy
and relationship between the exporter and the bank.
184
Part IV: International Trade Procedures and Regualations 

When you’re considering the letter of credit drawn at sight as a method of
payment, keep in mind that it’s extremely favorable to the exporter, because
the exporter faces no risk. The exporter is guaranteed to get the money as
long as the cargo is delivered to the carrier and documents are presented to
the bank prior to the expiration date.
So, you may be wondering, using this method of payment, what are the risks
to the importer? The key is in the documents. The shipping company issues
the bill of lading upon receipt of the goods. The goods arrive in a shipping
container and are not individually inspected by the shipping company. The
bill of lading will probably identify receiving one 20-foot container, which is
said to contain 300 dozen women’s sweaters. So, it’s possible that when the
importer opens the container with the shipment, he could have received
men’s instead of women’s sweaters, for example.
To minimize this risk, the exporter could arrange to have the goods inspected
by an independent inspection company. Inspection typically takes place at the
manufacturer’s or supplier’s premises, at the time of loading, or at the destina-
tion during discharge or offloading. The inspection service would then issue a
certified certificate of inspection. The importer would then add a third required
document to the letter of credit, which would be this certificate of inspection.
Societe Generale Surveillance (SGS), 42 Broadway, New York, NY 10004 (phone:
212-482-8700; Web: www.sgs.com), is one of the major inspection services.
Time Letter of Credit
A time letter of credit is similar to the letter of credit drawn at sight with just
one exception: With a letter of credit drawn at sight, the bank releases the
funds to the exporter upon seeing the documents, but with a time letter of
credit, the credit states that the payment is due within a certain time period
after the documents have been accepted by the bank (for example, 90 days
after acceptance).
Using my example of ABC Importing in New York and XYZ International in
Japan, let’s say the terms of payment are now a 90-day letter of credit. The
process remains the same until you get to the point where the forwarder
and/or exporter presents the original documents to the bank. After the con-
firming bank accepts the documents, the bank is required to remit payment
to the exporter in 90 days.
What if the exporter doesn’t want to wait the 90 days for the money — can
the exporter access the funds earlier? And what happens if the shipment
arrives in New York 60 days after shipment, and the importer inspects the
goods and realizes that the incorrect merchandise was shipped — can the
importer instruct the bank not to remit payment? The answer to the first
question is yes, and the answer to the second question is no.
185
Chapter 14: Methods of Payment

The letter of credit that was issued was irrevocable, which means that it cannot
be cancelled and the importer cannot stop the payment from being made.
On the other hand, because the money is guaranteed to the exporter in 90
days, the exporter has the right to go to the bank and borrow the money
using the letter of credit as collateral. This process is referred to as discount-
ing — the exporter discounts the letter of credit. Say the annual rate of inter-
est on a secured loan is 12 percent (or 1 percent per month). In this case, the
bank, upon request of the exporter, will remit the proceeds of the letter of
credit minus the interest that would be due on the loan (3 percent).
Discounting is used when the importer has an established line of credit with
the bank. This approach may be used as an alternative to posting the original
proceeds with the application for the letter of credit.
186
Part IV: International Trade Procedures and Regualations 
Exporter letter of credit checklist
Upon receiving the letter of credit, the exporter
needs to carefully compare the credit terms
with the terms of the original quotation,
because the terms must be met or the letter of
credit may be rendered invalid and the exporter
may not get paid. If you’re the exporter, and you
aren’t able to meet the terms or you note any
errors, you must immediately contact your cus-
tomer and request that the credit be amended.
The following are points that you (as the
exporter) need to evaluate when the credit is
received and when the documents are being
prepared:
 Check to see if the names and addresses of
the buyer and seller are correct.
 Make sure that the bank that issued the
letter of credit is reputable and acceptable
to you.
 Make sure the terms of the letter of credit
are in accordance with your agreement.
Will you be able to meet all of the deadlines
noted? Check with your freight forwarder to
make sure that no unusual condition may
arise that could delay shipment.
 Check to make sure that you and the
buyer/importer are in agreement about par-
tial shipments and transshipments. You may
want to request that the letter of credit
allow partial shipments and transship-
ments, as a way of preventing some unfore-
seen last-minute problems.
 Make sure the descriptions of the mer-
chandise, price, and quantity are correct.
 Make sure the terms of sale as noted are
the same as in your original agreement.
 If you aren’t a manufacturer, make sure that
the letter of credit is transferable. A trans-
ferable letter of credit is one that allows the
beneficiary to request that the issuing bank
or another bank authorized by the issuing
bank makes the funds from the credit avail-
able in whole or in part to one or mort other
parties. Funds can only be transferred when
the bank issuing the letter of credit desig-
nates it as a transferable letter of credit.

Bill of exchange (or draft)
A bill of exchange, also called a draft, is similar in many respects to a check
issued by a domestic buyer. As with checks that are used in day-to-day busi-
ness situations, bills of exchange carry some of the similar risks (the check
could bounce). The bill of exchange is an alternative method of payment to a
letter of credit, and it’s more advantageous to the importer, while increasing
risks for the exporter.
The process of using a bill of exchange is normally referred to as a documen-
tary collection. It’s a transaction where the exporter entrusts the collection of
payment to the exporter’s bank, which sends documents to the importer’s
bank along with instructions for payment. Funds are received from the
importer and remitted to the exporter through the banks involved in the col-
lection in exchange for the documents.
This method of payment involves the use of a draft that requires the importer
to pay the face amount either on sight-draft documents against payment or
on a specified date in the future (known as sight-draft documents against
acceptance).
The key parties in a documentary collection are the:
 Collecting bank: Any bank, other than the remitting bank, involved in
obtaining payment or acceptance from the importer (drawee).
 Drawee: The party, also known as the buyer or importer, that is presented
with financial and/or commercial documents for the purpose of either
payment or acceptance, in accordance with the collection instructions.
 Drawer: The party, also known as the seller or exporter, that authorizes
a bank (the remitting bank) to handle documents on its behalf.
 Presenting bank: The collecting bank that presents the documents to
the importer (drawee); usually the importer’s bank.
 Remitting bank: The bank that the exporter authorizes to carry out the
collection on its behalf.
Documentary collections are less complicated and less expensive than letters
of credit. The importer is not obligated to pay for goods prior to shipment.
The exporter retains title to the goods until the importer either pays the full
amount of the draft or signs a letter of acceptance and agrees to pay at some
specified future date. Similar to a letter of credit, the bank is responsible for
controlling the flow of the documents, but the bank does not verify them or
take any risks.
187
Chapter 14: Methods of Payment

The bill of exchange is only recommended for use when the buyers and sellers
have an established trade relationship. If you’re an exporter, you need to be
aware that you’ll be taking on greater risks under this method of payment.
The bank assists in obtaining payment, but it doesn’t guarantee payment or
verify the accuracy of the documents.
In the following sections, I cover the two main types of bills of exchange.
Sight draft documents against payment
When a sight draft documents against payment (SD/DP) is used, it is similar
to cash on delivery (COD) used in domestic transactions — except, instead of
it being cash on delivery, it is cash on documents.
Here’s how a sight draft documents against payment works. (Figure 14-5 pro-
vides a visual representation of these steps.)
1. The importer forwards a purchase order to the exporter.
In the example from earlier in this chapter, ABC Importing in New York
forwards an official purchase order, requesting the purchase of 300
dozen women’s sweaters from XYZ International in Japan.

2. The exporter (XYZ) confirms receipt of the order and prepares and
ships the goods to the freight forwarder for loading onto the vessel
for shipment to the port of New York.
3. After the goods have been loaded onto the vessel for shipment to New
York, the shipping company issues the original onboard ocean bill of
lading.
4. The exporter (XYZ) and freight forwarder present the original docu-
ments to the exporter’s bank with instructions for obtaining payment.
Using the documents against payment collection method, the exporter
(XYZ) gives the documents to its bank, which forwards them to the
exporter’s branch or correspondent bank in New York, along with
instructions as to how to collect the money from the importer.
In this arrangement, the collecting bank only releases the documents to
the importer upon payment for the goods. Upon receipt of payment, the
bank transmits the funds to the exporter (XYZ).
5. The importer (ABC) presents the documents (the original bill of
lading) to the shipping company through its Customs broker in
exchange for the goods.
Although this method is more advantageous to the buyer, in this example, the
exporter has increased risk. Even though the importer cannot have access to the
goods without payment, the exporter’s risk is that, if the draft is unpaid (that is,
ABC Importing does not have the funds and rejects the shipment), the goods
would have to be returned or forwarded to another customer, and the exporter
has to pay for that.
If you’re an exporter, this approach is a high-risk one. I only recommend it for
use when you and the importer have an established trade relationship and
you’re doing business with a buyer in a country that is politically and eco-
nomically stable.
If you’re the importer, keep in mind that the bank and the shipping company
do not inspect the goods. Their responsibilities are only to issue, accept, and
deliver the original documents. As with the letter of credit, you’re taking a
risk concerning the nature and quality of the goods. If you have any con-
cerns, consider working with an inspection company (see “Letter of credit
drawn at sight,” earlier in this chapter).
Sight draft documents against acceptance
With sight draft documents against acceptance (SD/DA), the exporter
extends credit to the importer through the use of a time draft. In other words,
the exporter is requesting that payment be made at some time in the future
(for example, 90 days).
189
Chapter 14: Methods of Payment

In this situation, the documents are released to the importer upon acceptance
of the draft and a promise by the importer to make the payment at the desig-
nated future date. By accepting the draft, the importer becomes legally oblig-
ated to pay the invoice at a future date. At the due date, the collecting bank
contacts the importer and, upon receipt of payment, the funds are transmitted
to the exporter. (Figure 14-6 provides a visual representation of the process of
a sight draft documents against acceptance.)
In the earlier example, the exporter (XYZ International) agrees to sell the
sweaters to the importer (ABC Importing) with payment terms of 90 days
sight draft against acceptance. The process is similar to the documents
against payment approach (see the preceding section) with one major differ-
ence: When the documents are presented to the importer (ABC), the
importer does not have to give the bank the money. Instead, the importer has
to sign a letter of acceptance, agreeing to make the payment at some agreed-
upon future date.
If you’re an exporter, this approach is an extremely high-risk option. If the
buyer doesn’t have the funds when approached by the bank for the payment,
it just becomes another bad debt, and you’re left with nothing.

Part IV: International Trade Procedures and Regualations 

Open account
The open-account payment method is a convenient alternative to the other
methods. However, the importer must be well established, have a long and
favorable payment history, and have been deemed to be very credit worthy
in order for this to work. Under the open-account option, the banks are elimi-
nated from the process, and the exporter bills the importer, who is expected
to pay under agreed-upon terms at some future date.
This approach poses significant risk, and the lack of official documents and
banking involvement make it difficult to legally enforce any claims. If you’re
an exporter, the process of pursuing these collections may be difficult and
costly.
Consignment
International consignment sales follow the same procedures as consignment
in a domestic transaction. If you’re an exporter, you ship the goods to a for-
eign distributor, who is responsible for paying the exporter only if the goods
are sold. You, as the exporter, retain title to the goods until they’re sold, and
payment is only forwarded to you after the goods have been sold and the dis-
tributor has received payment.
In the earlier example, XYZ International in Japan would forward the
sweaters to ABC Importing in New York. ABC Importing would only be oblig-
ated to remit funds to XYZ if and when the goods are sold. And XYZ would
retain title to the goods until ABC sells them.
The exporter has the greatest risk with this method, with very limited control
over the goods and a long wait before getting paid.
If you’re thinking to yourself, “What exporter in his right mind would agree to
such a thing?”, you’re not alone. Consignment is not widely used, but it is an
option. Here’s a situation in which it might be feasible: Let’s say that the
sweaters I talk about throughout this chapter are some really old, pre–World
War II–style sweaters. The exporter in Japan knows he’ll probably never sell
them, so he might take a chance, send them to ABC in New York, and tell ABC,
“Give it a try, and if you sell them, send me the money.” The exporter may make
some money, and at least he doesn’t have any inventory or holding costs.
191
Chapter 14: Methods of Payment

Factoring in Foreign Currency 
Risks Due to Fluctuations
By definition, in any transaction, the importer and exporter always come
from different countries and rarely use the same currency. Payments are usu-
ally made in either the exporter’s currency or the importer’s currency. In
some rare situations, payment is made in some mutually agreed-upon cur-
rency that is foreign to both parties.
One of the risks involved with foreign trade is the fluctuation of exchange rates
between currencies. If you’re an exporter and you’ve agreed to accept payment
in a foreign currency, and that currency is devalued, you’ll lose money in the
transaction. On the other hand, if the foreign currency increases in value, you
would make more money on the deal than you anticipated.
As the value of a currency increases in relation to the currency of another
country, exports decline, and imports increase. On the other hand, as the
value of a currency decreases in relation to the currency of another country,
imports increase, and exports decline. Exporters like a strong currency (in
their own country) while importers like a weak currency.
The risk due to the fluctuation in the exchange rate is always assumed by the
individual who is either making or receiving the payment in a foreign currency.
In other words, if you don’t want any risks as an exporter, when you invoice
your client, always do so in U.S. dollars. If you’re an importer, always request
that the supplier quote its prices to you (and invoice you) in U.S. dollars.
If you’re asked either to make a payment or to receive a payment in a foreign
currency, consult an international banker before negotiating the sales contract.
She can offer advice on exchange rate risks and make recommendations as to
how you may be able to minimize some of these risks. (To find an international
banker, just go to your bank and ask for the international division.)
Noting Non-Cash Methods of Payment
A number of poor and developing countries want to acquire goods and prod-
ucts for which they don’t have the convertible currency to pay for them. If
you’re an exporter, there are two main approaches to non-monetary trade:
 Barter: Barter is the direct exchange of goods or services between two
parties, with no money changing hands. Basically, instead of receiving
cash for the products you send to the less-developed country, you
would receive products that are equal in value.
192
Part IV: International Trade Procedures and Regualations 

 Countertrade: Countertrade is a non-cash method of payment that isn’t
normally encountered by small to medium-size exporters. A counter-
trade contract may say that the U.S. exporter will be paid in a convert-
ible currency as long as the U.S. exporter (or an entity designated by the
exporter) agrees to export a related quantity of goods from the import-
ing country.
A convertible currency (also referred to as a hard currency) is one that’s
accepted by both residents and nonresidents for the payment of goods
and services. A nonconvertible currency (also referred to as a soft cur-
rency) is one that usually has no value outside of the country that has
issued it, and more than likely will not be accepted by nonresidents for
the payment of goods and services.
For example, let’s say that South Africa wants to purchase US$500 million
dollars’ worth of aircraft from Boeing, a U.S. company. The purchase may
include a contractual agreement whereby Boeing would receive the US$500
million, as long as it agrees to identify customers for the equivalent
quantity of goods to be exported from South Africa.

Packing and Shipping — with 
the Right Documentation
In This Chapter
 Understanding the role of a freight forwarder
 Identifying packing and labeling requirements for exports
 Obtaining cargo insurance on export shipments
 Identifying the documents required for exports
A
fter you’ve received and accepted your export order, you need to coor-
dinate shipment and get the goods into the hands of your customer.
Sounds simple enough. But when you’re getting your orders ready for ship-
ment, you have to follow certain rules and regulations on packing, labeling,
documentation, and insurance. If you want your goods to arrive in good 
condition and on time, following these requirements is essential.
In this chapter, I fill you in on all these requirements and help you get your
products where they need to be when you need them to be there.
This chapter is mainly for exporters. If you’re an importer, turn to Chapter 16,
which addresses the issue of getting your goods through Customs.
Recognizing the Benefits 
of a Freight Forwarder
A freight forwarder is an independent company that acts as your agent in
moving the cargo from its point of origin (in the United States) to its overseas
destination. Freight forwarders provide a valuable service to exporters. They
coordinate the shipment of the goods from the factory, arrange to have the
cargo loaded onto the vessel, and process the documentation on the ship-
ment. Especially when you’re new to exporting, having a freight forwarder
you can trust helps ease the stress of sending your first shipments overseas.

196
Part IV: International Trade Procedures and Regulations 
Freight forwarders are familiar with U.S. export regulations (see Chapter 3),
import rules and regulations of the countries where the goods are being
shipped to, alternative methods of shipping, and all the applicable docu-
ments connected with foreign trade. Whether you’re shipping a small parcel
via air, large crates by ocean vessel, or full container loads of goods, a freight
forwarder can assist you in moving your cargo anywhere in the world at any
speed that you need.
Freight forwarders also assist exporters by advising them about freight costs,
port charges, consular fees, cost of special documentation, and handling fees.
They do this as part of their price quote process for their prospective cus-
tomers. So you don’t have to worry about getting slammed with a charge you
hadn’t expected. Every charge you pay should be spelled out ahead of time,
allowing you to budget and plan accordingly.
Freight forwarders can recommend proper packing so that the goods arrive
in good condition, and they can also arrange to have the cargo export packed
at the point of shipment or coordinate the packing of goods into a container.
When the order is ready for shipment, the freight forwarder coordinates the
preparation of all shipping documents required by the foreign government,
as well as those required as part of the payment process (see Chapter 14).
They ensure that everything is in order.
Freight forwarders also arrange to have the goods delivered to the carrier in
time for loading, prepare the bill of lading and any special required documen-
tation, and forward all documents directly to the customer or to the paying
bank, if applicable.
Export freight forwarders are licensed by the International Air Transport
Association (www.iata.org) to handle airfreight and the Federal Maritime
Commission (www.fmc.gov) to handle ocean freight.
If you’re exporting small parcels, using the services of UPS International or
Federal Express may be an easier option than working with a freight forwarder.
In these situations, international shipping companies are basically providing
the services that would normally be provided by a freight forwarder. Only use
this option, however, when you’re exporting small parcels, because the associ-
ated freight costs can be pretty high.
The documentary requirements imposed by foreign governments can, at
times, be overwhelming. Just to get an idea, go to www.export.gov, click
the I Want To link on the right-hand side of the page, click Find Country
Information, click Trade Information Center–Country Database, select a
region, and select a country. You’ll be able to identify all Customs information
and import documentation required in making shipments to the country you
chose. A freight forwarder takes care of all of this information and documen-
tation for you.

Freight forwarders are located in most metropolitan areas. Local business
telephone listings often feature a freight forwarder or transportation section.
Additionally, the National Customs Brokers and Forwarders Association of
America, 1200 18th St. NW, Suite 901, Washington, DC 20036 (phone: 202-466-0222;
Web: www.ncbfaa.org), provides exporters with information on its members.
Privately operated forwarder listing services, such as the following, can also
help you identify a local forwarder:
 Directory of Freight Forwarding Services: www.forwarders.com
 FreightGate.com: www.freightgate.com/directories/
directories.tet
 FreightNet.com: www.freightnet.com
 1800miti.com: www.1800miti.com/links/warehouse/logistics/
usa_dis_log.html
The criteria for choosing a freight forwarder are the same as for selecting a
Customs broker (see Chapter 16). You want to identify a freight forwarder
who has experience in the country where you anticipate doing business.
When you’re establishing your relationship with a freight forwarder, it’ll pro-
vide a contract that specifies the services that it’ll perform and the terms and
conditions of the relationship. You’ll be appointing it as an agent to prepare
documentation, so you’ll have to provide it with a power of attorney for that
purpose. Any mistakes that the freight forwarder makes will be your responsi-
bility as far as customers or government agencies are concerned.
Ask your attorney to review the agreement and make any appropriate modifi-
cations before you sign it.
Packing and Labeling Your Shipment
When you’re packing a shipment for export, you need to be aware of the
demands that may be placed on the package. These demands include every-
thing from weight and moisture to breakage and pilferage.
If your customer doesn’t specify any packing requirement, you need to keep
the following considerations in mind:
 Pack goods in a strong, sealed, and filled package when possible.
 If you can, pack and put your goods on pallets to ensure ease of handling.
197
Chapter 15: Packing and Shipping — with the Right Documentation

 Make sure that packages and packing filler are made of moisture-resistant
materials.
 Don’t list the contents or brand names on the packages — you want to
avoid possible pilferage.
Shipments via air require less heavy packing than ocean shipments. However,
they still need to be protected, especially if the items are packed in domestic
containers, because they may still be subject to pilferage.
Marking and labeling on export shipments need to meet shipping regulations,
ensure proper handling, conceal the identity of the contents, and assist your
customers in identifying shipments. Your customer will usually specify export
marks that need to appear on the cargo for easy identification. In addition to
meeting your customer’s requirements, you need to make sure the following
appears on each carton you ship:
 Your shipper’s mark: This is sort of like a return address. It’s a mark
that identifies the exporter, which can then be used by the buyer for
easy identification.
 Country of origin: If you’re shipping from the United States, just put
“Made in the U.S.A.”
 Weight marking (in pounds and in kilograms): For a quick and easy
conversion calculator, just go to www.google.com, and type in X
pounds to kilograms (where X is the number of pounds of your ship-
ment). It’ll tell you exactly how many kilograms your shipment weighs.
 The number of packages and size of cases (in inches and centimeters):
For a quick and easy conversion, go to www.google.com, and type in X
inches to centimeters (where X is the number of inches). It’ll tell you
exactly how many centimeters your shipment measures.
 Handling marks: These are international pictorial symbols that are 
standard on shipments. For a complete list of them, go to www.
inamarmarine.com/pdf/LossControl/Marks%20and%20Symbols.
pdf.
 Precaution markings: This includes stickers saying things like, “This
Side Up” or “Use No Hooks.”
 Port of Entry: This is the city where your product will arrive in the
country you’re shipping to.
 Labels for any hazardous materials
Freight forwarders can supply you with the necessary information regarding
these specific packing regulations.
198
Part IV: International Trade Procedures and Regulations 

Covering Your Assets with 
Cargo Insurance
Ocean or air export shipments need to be insured against loss, damage, or
delay in transit by cargo insurance. With international shipments, the car-
rier’s liability is limited by international agreements (such as the Warsaw
Convention and the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act). The person responsible
for making arrangements for cargo insurance — either you or the buyer —
depends on the term of sale (see Chapter 13). Consult with an international
insurance carrier or freight forwarder for more information on insurance.
If you’re a small company, or you’re new to export and the terms of sales
make you responsible for insurance, it’ll probably be easier for you to insure
the cargo under a freight forwarder’s policy for a fee than it would be to
arrange to have your own personal policy with an insurance company.
If the terms of sale make the foreign buyer responsible for the insurance,
make sure that the buyer has obtained adequate insurance. If the buyer
neglects to obtain coverage or doesn’t have enough, damage to the cargo
may force you to have to absorb a significant financial loss.
Nailing Down the Documentation
The actual purchase order you receive from your overseas customer is the
most important document you’ll receive, but there are many other docu-
ments you have to become familiar with before exporting your goods.
Because the processing of these documents can be a formidable task, you
should seriously consider having a freight forwarder handle this portion of
the transaction.
Even if you hire a freight forwarder, you’re responsible for the content of the
documents that are prepared and filed. The freight forwarder will prepare 
the documents based on information you provide.
The following documents are commonly used in exporting. Which of them
you’ll need to use depends on the situation, product, and government regula-
tions, both of the United States and the importing country. If you have ques-
tions about filing the correct documents for your specific situation, talk to a
freight forwarder.
199
Chapter 15: Packing and Shipping — with the Right Documentation

Commercial invoice
A commercial invoice (like the one shown Figure 15-1) is the first interna-
tional document that you’ll prepare as an exporter. It provides details that
are included in many of the other documents.
The commercial invoice serves as a bill for the goods from the importer to the
exporter, and it also serves as evidence of a transaction. Additionally, the
importer uses the commercial invoice to classify the merchandise, so that he
can get the shipment cleared expeditiously through Customs and make sure
that all duties and taxes have been accurately assessed.
A commercial invoice must include all the following required information:
 Complete name, address, and phone for both the exporter and consignee
(the person actually receiving the shipment)
The consignee is usually the importer, but the importer could have the
goods shipped to another address or individual. The consignee is the
person or company named in the contract as the person or company
that the goods are being turned over to.
 Terms of sale (see Chapter 13)
 Reason for export
 A complete description of the item:
• What is the item?
• What materials is the item made of?
• What is the item used for?
 Harmonized Tariff Codes, if known (This information is used by Customs
to determine applicable duties and clearance requirements.)
 Country of origin (where manufactured) for each commodity
 Number of units, unit value, and total value (purchase price, in whatever
currency the quote was made) of each item (If your shipment is just a
sample shipment or one that has no commercial value, you still must
state a nominal or fair market value on the commercial invoice.)
 Number of packages and total weight (in both pounds and kilograms)
 Shipper’s signature and date

Consular invoice for exports
In some instances, certain countries require a consular invoice to control and
identify goods. Consular invoices are normally purchased from the consulate
of the country to which the goods are being shipped and usually have to be
prepared in the language of that country. They also need to be signed by a
representative of the importer’s country at that country’s embassy or con-
sulate located in the United States. The consul charges a fee for this service.
You can get information about consular invoices and whether they’re required
in your particular situation by talking to your freight forwarder. You can also
determine if there is a specific consular invoice required for any country by
going to www.export.gov, clicking on I Want To on the right-hand side of
the page, clicking on Find Country Information, clicking on Trade Information
Center–Country Database, selecting the region, and selecting the country.
Shipper’s letter of instructions
The shipper’s letter of instructions (like the one shown in Figure 15-2) is a
letter from the shipper/exporter instructing the freight forwarder how and
where to send the shipment. The information provided in this form enables
the freight forwarder to process the shipment and prepare the required docu-
mentation. The information you provide on the form outlines the details of
the agreement between the exporter and the importer for the specific sale.
Bill of lading
A bill of lading is a contract between the owner of the goods (normally the
exporter) and the carrier of the goods. There are two types of bills of lading:
 A non-negotiable straight bill of lading: The straight bill of lading is
issued by the exporter. It pertains to the shipment of the cargo from 
the point of origin to the port of shipment. This document serves as 
evidence that the shipping carrier has received the goods and will be
transporting them to the destination listed on the document.
To see a copy of this form, you can go to www.nebs.com and, in the
Product Search box, type 6225 and click Go.

Part IV: International Trade Procedures and Regulations 

 A negotiable shipper’s order bill of lading: The negotiable shipper’s
order bill of lading (like the one shown in Figure 15-3), which can also be
referred to as a marine or ocean bill of lading, is prepared by the freight
forwarder and issued by the steamship company. It covers ocean trans-
portation. The importer needs this document as proof of ownership to
take possession of the goods (see Chapter 14).

Part IV: International Trade Procedures and Regulations 

When I say that this is a negotiable bill of lading, I mean that the goods
being shipped can be bought, sold, or graded while they’re in transit.
The bill of lading is endorsed, just like a check that can be endorsed
from one party to another, a negotiable bill of lading can be 
endorsed from one party to another.
Air waybill
The air waybill is a bill of lading for cargo being shipped by air. It is a non-
negotiable document, issued by the air carrier, that specifies the terms under
which the air carrier will be transporting the goods to their destination.
Certificate of origin
Certain countries require a signed statement as to the origin of the goods
that are being exported. You can usually obtain a certificate of origin (see
Figure 15-4) through organizations such as your local chamber of commerce.
This certificate may be required even though the commercial invoice may
state that the goods have been made in the United States.
Inspection certificate
Some importers and foreign countries may require that the goods be inspected
by an independent inspection company prior to shipment. The purpose of 
the inspection is to attest that goods are what you’re specifying they are.
Inspection certificates are issued by and obtained from the independent testing
organization.
Dock and warehouse receipt for exports
The dock and warehouse receipt is a receipt to transfer accountability after
the goods have been delivered by the domestic carrier to the port of ship-
ment and left with the international carrier (vessel or airplane) for export. In
other words, this is the receipt issued by the international shipping company
after the goods have been delivered by the ground carrier to the dock.
If you work with a freight forwarder, he’ll prepare the dock receipt. When the
goods are delivered, the receipt is signed by the shipping company and
returned to the freight forwarder, who then returns the receipt to the
exporter with the documentation and the freight forwarder’s invoice for his
services.

that diversion contrary to U.S. law is prohibited. The destination control
statement can be as simple as, “These goods are licensed by the Department
of Commerce for export to <Name of Country>.”
Insurance certificate
If the terms of sale on the transaction were cost, insurance, and freight (CIF),
the exporter is responsible for providing cargo insurance against loss or
damage while the goods are in transit from the point of origin until they
arrive at the destination. The exporter issues a certificate of insurance that
states the type and amount of coverage.
For a sample certificate of insurance, go to www.unzco.com/basicguide/

Shipper’s export declaration for exports
The shipper’s export declaration (see Figure 15-5) is a form used by the
Department of Commerce to control exports and compile trade statistics.
The exporter must prepare and submit this form to the Customs agent for
shipments by mail valued at more than $500 and for shipments by any other
means valued at more than $2,500. It’s required regardless of value for any
shipments being made under a validated export license (see Chapter 3).
This form is usually prepared and submitted to the authorities by the freight
forwarder.
Export license
The export license is a document that is required by the U.S. government for
those items requiring a Validated Export License (see Chapter 3). The Bureau
of Industry and Security (BIS) in the U.S. Department of Commerce is respon-
sible for implementing and enforcing the Export Administration Regulations
(EAR), which regulate the export and re-export of the majority of commercial
items.
If you have any questions about these regulations, you can contact your local
Department of Commerce official for assistance (see Chapter 3).

Getting Your Goods: 
Customs Requirements 
and the Entry Process
In This Chapter
 Understanding the process required to clear a shipment through U.S. Customs
 Looking at the role of a Customs broker
 Knowing which documents are required
 Dissecting how Customs inspects and values your imported goods
 Making sure your shipments arrive properly packed and labeled
 Understanding how import quotas may limit your ability to import certain items
You’ve selected the products you want to import, identified the relevant
rules and regulations, located a supplier, identified your target market,
and found customers for the products. Now all that’s left is getting the goods
through the Customs maze and delivered to your customers.
When your shipment arrives in the United States, you (or your authorized
agent) file the applicable entry documents for the goods with Customs at the
port of entry. Imported goods are not legally entered into the United States
until after the shipment has arrived, delivery of the merchandise has been
authorized by Customs, and duties have been paid. Your job is to coordinate
the examination and release of the goods by U.S. Customs (or hire someone
to do that for you). In this chapter, I tell you how.
Understanding U.S. Import Requirements
The U.S. Customs import requirements are short and sweet, but navigating
them is anything but easy. For your reference, here are the requirements:

212
Part IV: International Trade Procedures and Regulations 
 An individual may make his own Customs clearance of goods imported
for personal use or business.
 The U.S. Customs Service does not require an importer to have a license
or permit. Other agencies may, however, require a permit, license, or
other certification, depending on the commodity.
 All merchandise coming into the United States must clear Customs and
is subject to Customs duty unless specifically exempt.
 Customs duties are, generally ad valorem (a percentage rate is applied
to the dutiable value of the imported goods). Some articles, however, 
are dutiable at a specific rate of duty (so much per pound, gallon, and 
so on), or a combination (ad valorem and specific).
 The dutiable value of merchandise is determined by Customs. It is basi-
cally the transaction value, the price the buyer actually pays the seller.
 Unless the item is free of duty, the tariff schedules provide three rates of
duty for an item:
• The normal trading relations (General Column)
• The rate for less-than-favorable countries (Column 2)
• The rate for least developing countries, which show a duty rate
lower than that presently accorded most favored nations 
(These would be Items under the Generalized System of
Preferences, Caribbean Basin Initiative, Israeli Free Trade 
Act, North American Free Trade Agreement, and Dominican
Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement.)
Providing Evidence of 
Right to Make Entry
The bill of lading is required as evidence of ownership of the goods in order
to enter them into the U.S. Shipments arriving by air use an air waybill instead
of a bill of lading.
In most instances, entry is made by the owner of the goods (or his representa-
tive). The bill of lading is the document that serves as this proof of ownership.
In order to make the entry and get the goods through Customs you need to
present the bill of lading. In some instances, the carrier can issue a document
for this purpose is known as a carrier’s certificate, which provides the particu-
lars of a shipment and designates who may make a Customs entry on that
shipment. (See https://forms.customs.gov/customsrf/getform
harness.asp?formName=cf-7523-print.xft&preference=PDF for a
sample of this certificate.)

When the goods are not imported by a common carrier (that is, you’re hand-
carrying them from a trip), possession of the goods by the importer at the
time of arrival is deemed sufficient evidence of the right to make entry.
You can provide evidence of right to entry yourself, or you can hire a Customs
broker to do so on your behalf. In the following sections, I provide more info
on each option.
Note: Every entry that is posted with U.S. Customs must come with a guaran-
tee that any potential duties, taxes, and Customs penalties that may accrue
will be paid. This guarantee is referred to as a surety bond. A surety bond also
includes a provision for the payment of any increased duty that may be found
after the goods have cleared Customs. You can obtain a surety bond through
a U.S. surety company, or you can post it yourself in the form of U.S. money
or government securities. If you hire a Customs broker to make the entry, the
broker will use his surety bond to provide the required coverage.
Having the broker take care of the surety bond on your behalf is one of the
primary reasons why using a Customs broker makes more sense than trying
to handle the entry yourself.
Making entry yourself
As an importer, you can make your own Customs clearance. What this means
is that you aren’t required to use the services of a licensed Customs broker —
you can visit Customs and arrange to personally clear the goods yourself.
Entering your own goods may save you money, because you won’t have to
absorb the broker’s fees. But you’ll still have to pay applicable duties and
arrange for shipment. And you’ll probably spend a significant amount of time
going through the process — when you’re new to the process, it’s time-
consuming.
Entry made by others on your behalf
You’re allowed to designate another individual to arrange for Customs clear-
ance on your behalf. People who do this for a living are known as Customs
brokers. In order for a Customs broker to perform that function, you must
provide him with a U.S. Customs Power of Attorney. You have to prepare and
sign a Customs Form 5291 (see Figure 16-1), or a document using the same
language as this form.

214
Part IV: International Trade Procedures and Regulations 

A licensed Customs broker named in a Customs power of attorney may make
entry on behalf of the importer. The Customs broker, on your behalf, pre-
pares and submits documentation, and sorts and releases the imported
goods through Customs after paying the required sum of import duty. (For
more on Customs brokers, see the following section.)
Working with a Customs Broker
Customs brokers are the only people authorized by the tariff laws of the
United States to act as agents for importers in the transaction of their
Customs business. Brokers are private individuals or firms licensed by 
the Customs Service to
 Prepare and file the necessary Customs entries
 Arrange for the payment of duties
 Take steps to effect the release of the goods in Customs custody
 Represent the importer in Customs matters
The fees charged for these services vary according to the Customs broker
and the extent of services performed, but a general price range would be 
$75 to $100 for a routine entry.
In addition to assisting in the entry process, Customs brokers can also:
 Help you decide which shipping routes are best, to get your goods in the
shortest possible time
 Tell you which method of shipment is best for your goods and advise
you on packing requirements for those goods
 Guide you on matters relating to international payments
When you’re choosing a Customs broker, consider the following questions:
 Do you have a specialized product line or type of import? You may
want to find a broker who either specializes or has a great deal of exper-
tise in clearing your type of products. For example, fruits and vegetables
have numerous Department of Agriculture regulations that apply to their
importation, and they’re also perishable. Not every broker is experienced
in handling these products.
215
Chapter 16: Getting Your Goods: Customs Requirements and the Entry Process

 How many ports will you be using for your imports? If you’re import-
ing through a large number of ports, you’ll want to hire a broker who has
offices in those ports.
 How connected is the broker? You want to identify a broker who is fully
automated with full connectivity not only to U.S. Customs but also to
various Web portals and cargo tracking sites. Consider using a firm that
participates in the Automated Broker Interface (ABI), which is a system
that permits transmission of data pertaining to merchandise being
imported into the United States.
 What is the broker’s general reputation? The best source of information
about a broker’s reputation comes from the broker’s own customers. Ask
for references — and be sure to contact them!
Looking at the Documents Required to
Enter Goods into the United States
To make or file a Customs entry, the following documents are generally
required:
 A bill of lading, airway bill, or carrier’s certificate (naming the consignee —
the person to whom the goods will be turned over — for Customs pur-
poses) as evidence of the consignee’s right to make entry
 A commercial invoice obtained from the seller, showing the value and
description of the merchandise
 Entry manifest (Customs Form 7533 — see Figure 16-2) or entry/immedi-
ate delivery (Customs Form 3461 — see Figure 16-3)
 Packing lists, if appropriate, and other documents necessary to determine
whether the merchandise may be admitted
These forms are usually prepared and submitted to U.S. Customs by the
Customs broker. If you’re not using a broker, you’ll have to do it yourself —
all the more reason to hire a Customs broker.

Part IV: International Trade Procedures and Regulations 

Immediate delivery
An immediate delivery entry is an alternative that provides for immediate
release of a shipment. It’s used when an importer applies for a special permit
for immediate delivery, filing a Customs Form 3461 (refer to Figure 16-3) prior
to the arrival of the merchandise. If this application is approved, the shipment
is released to the importer immediately after arrival.
This type of release is only available for the following types of merchandise:
 Merchandise arriving from Canada or Mexico
 Fresh fruits or vegetables arriving from Canada or Mexico
 Articles for a trade fair
 Tariff rate quota merchandise and, under certain circumstances, mer-
chandise subject to an absolute quota, although an item that is under an
absolute quota will also require that a formal entry be posted (For more
information, turn to “Identifying Import Quotas,” later in this chapter.)
You can arrange for an immediate entry with a Customs broker.
Warehouse entry
If you want to delay the payment of duties and entry of goods, you can arrange
to have the goods stored in a bonded warehouse under a warehouse entry. 
A bonded warehouse is a facility under the control of Customs. Technically,
while the goods are stored in the warehouse, they haven’t been entered into
the commerce of the United States. If the goods are removed from the ware-
house and exported out of the United States, the importer will not have to
pay any duty. However, if the importer removes the goods from the ware-
house and enters them into the commerce of the United States, the importer
is required to pay the duty rate that is applicable on the date he removes the
goods from the warehouse.
While the goods are stored in the warehouse, they can, under Customs super-
vision, be cleaned, sorted, repacked, or changed in condition by a process
that does not amount to manufacturing. After the goods have been changed
and modified, if the items are then exported, no payment of duty is required.
If the items are modified and entered into the commerce of the United States,
the importer is responsible for the payment of duty applicable to the goods
in their modified condition at the time of withdrawal.
Goods can be stored in a bonded warehouse for up to five years.
219
Chapter 16: Getting Your Goods: Customs Requirements and the Entry Process

Foreign trade zones
A U.S. foreign trade zone (FTZ) is an alternative to a bonded warehouse with
one exception: Goods stored in a foreign trade zone can be modified, and
actual manufacturing operations can occur; further manufacturing is not 
permitted in a bonded warehouse.
Similar to using a bonded warehouse, goods in the zone that are exported
before entering the commerce of the United States require no duty to be paid.
Goods modified or remanufactured in the zone and released into the com-
merce of the United States for consumption are subject to the payment of
duty applicable on the final product in effect on the date of withdrawal. Also,
there is not time limit on goods stored in a foreign trade zone.
You can get more information on U.S. foreign trade zones from the Foreign
Trade Zones Board, Department of Commerce, 1401 Constitution Ave. NW,
Room 2111, Washington, DC 20230 (phone: 202-482-2862; Web: http://
ia.ita.doc.gov/ftzpage/). You can view the Foreign Trade Zones Manual
on the Customs Web site at www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/import/cargo_
control/ftz/. For the contact information for each FTZ project in the
United States, go to http://ia.ita.doc.gov/FTZPAGE/letters/
ftzlist.html.
Mail entry
In some circumstances, it’s to the importer’s advantage to use a country’s
mail system, rather than a courier service (such as FedEx, UPS, or DHL) to
import merchandise into the United States. You’re allowed to import via the
postal system shipments not exceeding $2,000.
Note: The following products are limited to imports of just $250:
 Billfolds and other flat goods
 Feathers and feather products
 Flowers and foliage, artificial or preserved
 Footwear
 Fur, articles of
 Gloves
 Handbags
 Headwear and hat braids
 Leather, articles of
220
Part IV: International Trade Procedures and Regulations 

 Luggage
 Millinery ornaments
 Pillows and cushions
 Plastics, miscellaneous articles of
 Rawhides and skins
 Rubber, miscellaneous articles of
 Textile fibers and products
 Toys, games, and sports equipment
 Trimmings
Here’s how it works: The exporter packages the goods and encloses a copy of
the invoice in the package or securely attaches the invoice to the parcel. The
exporter also attaches a Customs Declaration Form to the outer wrapping of
the package, giving an accurate description of the contents and their value.
Upon the package’s arrival in the United States, a Customs officer prepares 
an entry for importations, and a letter carrier at the destination delivers the
parcel to the addressee upon the payment of duty. A Customs process fee of
$5 is assessed for each parcel for which documentation is prepared.
You can also send yourself goods from overseas. For example, let’s say you’re
visiting Italy and you’ve found a manufacturer of quality costume-jewelry ear-
rings. You purchase the earrings from the manufacturer and get a copy of the
invoice. You then take the parcel to the nearest post office. Making sure that
you enclose a copy of the invoice in the parcel, you seal the parcel, address it
to yourself in the United States, and secure a Customs declaration form to the
package. The declaration form says: “This package contains 1,500 pairs of
costume-jewelry earrings. Value for Customs purposes: US$1,500.” When the
package arrives at the mail depot at the international airport where the
goods arrive, the parcel is inspected by a Customs officer. The officer pre-
pares a mail entry form and assesses any applicable duties. The parcel is
given to the postal service for delivery and collection of duty. In addition to
the duty, you’re assessed a $5 processing fee.
Mail entry offers some benefits to importers:
 Clearing goods through Customs is easy.
 You don’t have to pay a Customs broker.
 You don’t lose time trying to clear the parcel yourself.
 Shipping charges are less expensive than the cost of a courier service.
 No formal entry is required on duty-free merchandise, as long as the
merchandise does not exceed the $2,000 limit.
221
Chapter 16: Getting Your Goods: Customs Requirements and the Entry Process

They’re Here! The Arrival of Your Goods
Imported goods are not legally entered into the United States until the ship-
ment arrives within the limits of the port of entry and U.S. Customs has
authorized the delivery of the merchandise. This is normally accomplished
when the importer (or his Customs broker) files the appropriate documents.
To expedite this process, you can present Customs entry papers before the
merchandise arrives, but entry won’t take place until the merchandise
arrives within the port limits.
The U.S. Customs Service doesn’t notify you of the arrival of your shipment.
Notification of arrival is usually made by the carrier of the goods. It’s your
responsibility to make sure that you or your Customs broker are informed
immediately, so that you can file the entry and avoid any delay in obtaining
the goods. Stay in touch with the exporter and ask for an estimated time of
arrival.
Imported merchandise not entered through Customs within five days after its
arrival (exclusive of Sundays, holidays, or any authorized extension) is sent
by Customs to public storage or a general order warehouse to be held as
unclaimed. The importer is responsible for any storage charges that may be
incurred while the unclaimed merchandise is held at the warehouse. If the
goods remain unclaimed at the end of one year, the merchandise is sold at
auction. If the goods are perishable, they may be sold sooner.
You can go to www.treas.gov/auctions/treasury/gp/ for more infor-
mation on these auctions. The site provides a list of items along with dates
and locations of upcoming auctions. You can also review the bid results of
previous auctions.
Open Wide: U.S. Customs 
Examination of Goods
Prior to the goods’ release, the port director designates representative sam-
ples of the goods being imported so that they can be examined by a Customs
inspector under conditions that will safeguard the goods. The goods need to
be examined to make sure that you’ve met all of the requirements on import-
ing merchandise (see Chapter 3 for information on restricted merchandise
and specific agency requirements.) For example, if you’re importing fruits or
vegetables, the goods would be subject to inspection by the Department of
Agriculture to make sure the items are safe for human consumption.
222
Part IV: International Trade Procedures and Regulations 

Textiles and textile products are also considered trade-sensitive items. 
They may be subject to a higher percentage of examinations than other 
commodities.
In simple situations involving small shipments or certain classes of goods
such as bulk shipments, examination may be made on the docks, at the con-
tainer stations, at the cargo terminal, or at the importer’s premises. The
goods are then released to the importer. In other shipments, representative
packages of the merchandise may be retained by Customs for appraisement
purposes and the remainder of the shipment released. The packages that are
withheld are released to the importer after the Customs examination has
been completed.
Examination of goods is necessary to determine
 The value of the goods for Customs purposes and their dutiable status.
 Whether the goods are marked with the country of their origin. The goods
must be marked in a conspicuous place and in a legible and indelible
manner to indicate the English name of the country of origin to the 
ultimate purchaser in the United States.
 Whether the goods have been correctly invoiced.
 Whether the shipment may contain prohibited articles.
 Whether requirement of other agencies have been met.
 Whether goods in excess of the invoice quantities are present or a short-
age exists.
In the following sections, I cover how Customs determines the dutiable status
of the goods that you’re importing to the United States.
Determining the dutiable 
value of your goods
All merchandise coming into the United States must clear Customs and is
subject to a Customs duty unless specifically exempt. The dutiable value of
your merchandise is determined by Customs. The dutiable value is basically
the transaction value — the price actually paid or payable for the merchan-
dise when it is sold for exportation to the United States, plus amounts for the
following items if they are not included in the price:
 The packing costs incurred by the buyer
 Any selling commission incurred by the buyer
223
Chapter 16: Getting Your Goods: Customs Requirements and the Entry Process

 The value of any goods that are free of charge or at a reduced cost, for use
in the production or sale of merchandise for export to the United States
 Any royalty or license fee that the buyer is required to pay as a condition
of the sale
 The proceeds, accruing to the seller, of any subsequent resale, disposal,
or use of the imported merchandise
The amounts for the above items are added only to the extent that each is not
included in the price actually paid or payable and information is available to
establish the accuracy of the amount.
If the transaction value cannot be used, there are four alternative methods
for determining dutiable value:
 Transaction value of identical merchandise: When the transaction
value cannot be determined, the Customs value of the imported goods
being appraised is the transaction value of identical merchandise.
 Transaction value of similar merchandise: If merchandise identical to
the imported goods cannot be found or an acceptable transaction value
for such merchandise does not exist, then the Customs value is the
transaction value of similar merchandise. The transaction value of simi-
lar merchandise would be a previously accepted Customs value.
Similar merchandise is merchandise that is produced in the same coun-
try and by the same person as the merchandise being appraised. It must
be commercially interchangeable with the merchandise being appraised.
The identical or similar merchandise must have been exported to the
United States at or about the same time as the merchandise that is being
appraised.
 Deductive value: The deductive value is the resale price in the United
States after importation of the goods, with deductions for certain items.
Generally, the deductive value is calculated by starting with a unit price
and making certain additions to and deductions from that price. The
additions would be costs associated with packaging, and the deductions
would be for commissions or profit and general expenses, transporta-
tion and insurance costs, and Customs duties or federal taxes.
 Computed value: If Customs is unable to determine valuation based on
any of the preceding methods, computed value is considered. The com-
puted value consists of the sum of the following items:
• Materials, fabrication, and other processing used in producing the
imported merchandise
• Profit and general expenses
224
Part IV: International Trade Procedures and Regulations 

• Any free goods, if not included in the preceding two bullets
• Packing costs
Deciphering your goods’ dutiable status
The dutiable status is determined by Customs. All merchandise that comes
into the United States must clear Customs and is subject to Customs duty
unless it’s specifically exempt because of its classification in the Harmonized
Tariff Schedule of the United States.
The Harmonized Tariff Schedule is a technical document used to classify
imported merchandise for rates of duty and statistical purposes. You can buy
a copy from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office,
Washington, DC 20402 (phone: 202-512-1800; Web: www.gpo.gov). You can
also access the document for free online at www.usitc.gov/tata/hts/
bychapter/index.htm or download a PDF of the full document at http://
hotdocs.usitc.gov/docs/tata/hts/bychapter/0800htsa.pdf. (For
more on the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, turn to Chapter 3.)
When goods are dutiable, the following rates may be assessed:
 Ad valorem: An ad valorem rate, which is the type of rate most often
applied, is a percentage of the value of the merchandise — for example,
10 percent ad valorem. (If the item had a dutiable value of $10, and the
rate was 10 percent ad valorem, the duty would be $1.)
Ad valorem is Latin for “by value.”
 Specific: A specific rate is a specified amount per unit of weight or other
quantity, such as 5.9¢ per dozen.
 Compound: A compound rate is a combination of both an ad valorem
rate and a specific rate, such as 0.7¢ per kilo plus 10 percent ad valorem.
Rates of duty for imported merchandise may also vary depending upon the
country of origin. Most merchandise is dutiable under the most-favored-
nation status, now referred to as normal trade relations (NTR). The applica-
ble duty rates appear in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule in the General
column under Column 1. (For a sample of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule,
check out Table 16-1.)

Merchandise from countries to which NTR rates have not been extended is
dutiable at the full rates found in Column 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule.
(You may hear these countries referred to informally as the “least-favored
nations.”)
Duty-free status is also available under various conditional exemptions, which
are reflected in the Special column under Column 1 of the Harmonized Tariff
Schedule. This column is for least developing countries and shows a duty rate
lower than those assigned NTR status. These are rates that are assigned under
certain programs such as the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), the
Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), the Israeli Free Trade Act, the North America
Free Trade Act (NAFTA), and the Dominican Republic–Central American Free
Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA). It’s your responsibility to show that the item
you’re importing is eligible for preferential duty treatment (if that is, in fact,
the case).
In the following sections, I cover the various preferential duty rates.
226
Part IV: International Trade Procedures and Regulations 

Generalized Systems of Preferences
The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) is a program providing for duty-
free status for certain merchandise from less-than-developed independent and
dependent countries and territories. The purpose of the GSP is to encourage
the economic growth of these countries and territories. It was enacted by the
United States in the Trade Act of 1974. (The act occasionally expires and must
be renewed by Congress to remain in effect. The Customs Service provides
the trade community with notification of these expirations and renewals.)
You can find out whether an item is eligible under the GSP by identifying the
Tariff Classification Code for the item found in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule
of the United States.
Items that qualify under the GSP are identified by either an A or A* in the
Special column under Column 1 of the tariff schedule. Items designated in
this manner may qualify for duty-free status as long as the goods are being
imported from the designated country. Certain countries listed with the A*
may be excluded from the exemption — you’ll see these exceptions as you
browse through the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, or you will be advised when
you contact a commodity specialist team (see Chapter 3).
The list of countries and exclusions, together with the list of eligible items,
can change from time to time. You need to make sure that if you’re looking at
the tariff schedule, you’re viewing the latest edition. (If you’re reviewing the
version at www.usitc.gov/tata/hts/bychapter/index.htm, it will
always be current.)
You can also verify a country and product’s participation in the program by
asking the appropriate commodity specialist team at your local Customs
office (see Chapter 3).
Here are the independent countries that can participate in the GSP: Albania,
Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Bahrain, Bangladesh,
Benin, Bhutan, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Bulgaria,
Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African
Republic, Chad, Chile, Colombia, Comoros, Costa Rica, Côte d’Ivoire, Croatia,
Czech Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Dominica,
Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea,
Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea,
Guinea Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Jamaica,
Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kiribati, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Lesotho,
Lithuania, Macedonia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius,
Moldova, Mongolia, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria,
Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines,
Poland, Republic of Congo (Brazzaville), Romania, Russia, Rwanda, St. Kitts
and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, Sao Tome and
Principe, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Slovakia, Solomon Islands,
227
Chapter 16: Getting Your Goods: Customs Requirements and the Entry Process

Somalia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Swaziland, Tanzania, Thailand,
Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, Tuvalu, Uganda, Ukraine,
Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, Venezuela, Yemen, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.
And here are the non-independent countries and territories that can partici-
pate in the GSP: Anguilla, British Indian Ocean Territory, British Virgin
Islands, Christmas Island (Australia), Cocos (Keeling) Island, Cook Island,
Falkland Island (Islas Malvinas), French Polynesia, Gibraltar, Hear Island and
McDonald Islands, Montserrat, New Caledonia, Niue, Norfolk Island, Pitcairn
Island, St. Helena, Tokelau, Turks and Caicos Island, Wallis and Funtuna, West
Bank and Gaza Strip, and Western Sahara.
Some products coming from a listed country may not be eligible to partici-
pate in the program. Check the Harmonized Tariff Schedule or contact the
appropriate commodity specialist team at Customs if you’re unsure.
Caribbean Basin Initiative
The Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) is a program similar to the Generalized
System of Preferences (see the preceding section), except that this program
is targeted toward countries that are part of the Caribbean Basin.
You can identify whether an item is eligible by identifying the Tariff Classifica-
tion Code for the item found in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United
States. Items that are identified by either by an E or E* in the Special column
under Column 1 of the tariff schedule may qualify for duty-free status as long
as the goods are being imported from the designated country. Those items
listed with the E* may be excluded from the exemption.
Here is a list of countries that participate in the CBI: Antigua and Barbuda,
Aruba, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, British Virgin Islands, Dominica, Grenada,
Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Montserrat, Netherlands Antilles, Panama, St. Kitts
and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and
Tobago.
Some products coming from a listed country may not be eligible to participate
in the program. Please check the Harmonized Tariff Schedule or contact the
appropriate commodity specialist team at U.S. Customs if you’re unsure.
U.S.-Israeli Free Trade Area Agreement
The United States and Israel have implemented a free trade agreement
intended to stimulate trade between the two countries. The agreement was
amended in 1996 to add goods produced in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and
qualifying industrial zones.
Items identified by an IL in the Special column under Column 1 of the
Harmonized Tariff Schedule may qualify for duty-free status as long as 
the goods are produced in Israel, the West Bank, Gaza Strip, or qualifying
industrial zones.
228
Part IV: International Trade Procedures and Regulations 

NAFTA and DR-CAFTA
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Dominican
Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) are agreements
designed to stimulate trade between member countries.
NAFTA creates free trade between the Canada, Mexico, and the United States.
DR-CAFTA creates a free trade area including Costa Rica, the Dominican
Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the United
States.
In the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, items designated with CA or MX in the
Special column under Column 1 qualify for participation in NAFTA. Items
designed with P or P+ in the Special column under Column 1 quality for 
participation in DR-CAFTA.
Looking at duty liabilities: 
Who owes what and when
The liability for the payment of duty becomes fixed at the time an entry for
consumption (immediate delivery) or for warehouse (warehouse entry) is
filed with Customs. (See “Deciphering the Different Types of Entry,” earlier in
this chapter, for more on both of these types of entry.) The person or firm 
in whose name the entry is filed assumes the obligation for the payment of
duties — normally, this is the importer.
When goods have been entered for bonded warehouse, liability for paying
duties may be transferred to any person who purchases the goods and wants
to withdraw the goods in his own name.
Paying a Customs broker doesn’t get you off the hook when it comes to your
liability for Customs charges (duties, taxes, and other debts owed to Customs).
If your broker fails to pay those charges on your behalf, you’re still liable for
them.
If you pay the broker by check, give the broker a separate check, made payable
to “U.S. Customs Service” for those Customs charges. The broker will then
deliver the check to Customs.
Considering Country-of-Origin Markings
U.S. Customs laws require that each imported item produced abroad be
marked with the English name of the country of origin. The marking should
be legible and located in a conspicuous place so as to indicate to the pur-
chaser the country in which the article was produced.
229
Chapter 16: Getting Your Goods: Customs Requirements and the Entry Process

If the article is not properly marked at the time the goods are imported, a
marking duty equal to 10 percent of the Customs value of the article will be
assessed unless the article is exported, destroyed, or properly marked under
supervision by U.S. Customs.
For a detailed list of items for which country-of-origin markings are not
required, go to www.usitc.gov/trade_remedy/731_ad_701_cvd/
investigations/customs_importation_guidelines.pdf and go to
pages 123 through 125. Or contact the U.S. Customs commodity specialist
team (see Chapter 3).
Packing and Commingling: Making Sure
Your Exporter Follows the Rules
When you import goods, the seller must pack the goods in a way that will
permit a U.S. Customs officer to examine, weigh, measure, and release the
goods to you promptly.
In order to speed up the clearance of your goods through Customs, you 
need to:
 Receive from the seller an invoice or packing list that shows the exact
quantity of each item of goods in each box, case, or other package
 Make sure that the seller marks and numbers each package
 Make sure that the marks or numbers appear on your invoice or packing
list opposite the itemization of goods contained in the package that bears
those marks and numbers
Your goods will get through Customs faster if the packages contain goods of
one kind only, or if the goods are imported in packages with uniform contents
and values.
You don’t want to try to import a package that contains articles that are sub-
ject to different rates of duty and are packed in such a way that the quantity
or value of each category cannot be easily determined. In this situation, the
commingled articles will be subject to the highest rate of duty applicable to
any part of the shipment, unless you manually segregate the goods under
Customs supervision.
Your segregation of a commingled shipment is done at your own risk and
expense. You have to do it within 30 days of the date of personal delivery or
the date that Customs mails a notice to you telling you that the goods are
commingled (unless Customs grants an extension). Bottom line: Do every-
thing you can to avoid commingled goods.
230
Part IV: International Trade Procedures and Regulations 

Identifying Import Quotas
An import quota is a limit on the amount of merchandise that can be imported
(into the United States) for a certain period of time. The quota system is
administered by U.S. Customs, but Customs does not have any authority to
change or modify any quota, because they’re set by Congress.
There are two types of quotas:
 Absolute quotas: An absolute quota is a specific amount of a particular
product that may be entered during a quota period. Some absolute
quotas can be global (meaning a limit of a particular good coming from
all countries), while others are allocated to specified countries (for
example, the U.S. government may impose a quota of 1 million silk ties
from Thailand during the first six months of a particular year). If goods
arrive after the quota is closed, those imports in excess may be
exported or warehoused for entry in a subsequent quota period.
 Tariff rate quotas: Tariff rate quotas allow for a specified quantity of
goods to be entered into the country at a reduced rate of duty during a
given period. However, quantities entered in excess of the quota for the
period are subject to a higher rate of duty. For example, the U.S. govern-
ment might impose a quota of 1 million silk ties for the first six months
of the year at a duty rate of 5 percent; any quantities in excess of that
would be allowed to enter the country, but they would have a duty rate
of 40 percent.
You can get information on commodities subject to quota by contacting the
Quota Staff, U.S. Customs Service, 1300 Constitution Ave. NW, Washington, DC
20229 (phone: 202-927-5850; Web: www.customs.gov/xp/cgov/import/
textiles_and_quotas/quota_restrict.xml), or you can contact a
commodity team specialist (see Chapter 3).
The one category of articles that most start-up importers should be con-
cerned about are textiles. If you decide to import certain textile product
(such as cotton, wool, man-made fiber, silk blend, or other vegetable-fiber
articles), be careful: If the quota period is closed, you won’t be able to enter
the goods into the United States. They’ll either have to be returned to the
seller or warehoused, at great expense.
Being Aware of Anti-Dumping 
and Countervailing Duties
Anti-dumping duties are taxes assessed on imported merchandise that is sold
to purchasers in the United States at a price less than the merchandise would
be sold in the manufacturer’s home market.
231
Chapter 16: Getting Your Goods: Customs Requirements and the Entry Process

Countervailing duties are taxes assessed to counter the effect of subsidies pro-
vided by foreign governments on goods that are exported to the United States.
A subsidy is financial assistance provided by a country to a manufacturer in
that country, which causes the price of the merchandise to be artificially low;
because of the artificially low prices, U.S. manufacturers cannot be competi-
tive. If a U.S. manufacturer is a competitor in this kind of situation, it typically
asks the government to impose countervailing duties to counter the effects of
the subsidy.
Before agreeing to purchase products, confirm whether that product is sub-
ject to any anti-dumping or countervailing duty order issued by the U.S.
Department of Commerce. The rates of duty imposed on goods that are 
subject to one of these orders can be much greater than the normal rate 
of duty. For more information, contact your local office of the Department of
Commerce or go to www.usitc.gov/trade_remedy/731_ad_701_cvd/
index.htm.
When you negotiate a price with a foreign supplier, make sure you know the
price that the supplier is selling the goods for in its own country. This infor-
mation will help you evaluate your potential risk for punitive duties.

M
any small to medium-size manufacturing or services companies want
to identify overseas suppliers so that they can lower their cost of
goods sold and increase their profits. Entrepreneurs are excited by the
thought of looking across international borders for business opportunities —
many people see it as an exciting opportunity to travel and experience the
satisfaction of working with people from all over the world.
Importing is not as easy as it may initially appear — in fact, it’s a real challenge.
You have to take the time to select the right product, understand the applica-
ble rules and regulations, identify your customers, find out about different 
payment and shipping alternatives, and deal with the bureaucracy known as
U.S. Customs. In order to do all these things successfully, you have to be aware
of the ten keys to becoming a successful importer.
Familiarizing Yourself with Import
Control and Regulatory Requirements
To avoid any problems in clearing your merchandise and getting it through
Customs, you need to be familiar with U.S. Customs policies and procedures
before actually importing your goods. U.S. Customs and Border Protection
(CBP) does not require an importer to have a license or permit; however,
other agencies — such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (USDA), or the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and

Firearms (BATF) — may require a license or permit to import a specific prod-
uct. Make sure you know what kind of license may be required to import your
merchandise into the United States.
You also need to figure out whether the item you’re importing is subject to any
special requirements in terms of product specifications, testing, certification,
marketing, labeling, packaging, and documentation.
The CBP Web site (www.cbp.gov) contains valuable information for new
importers. Click the Import tab on the CBP home page and review the topics
found on the CBP import page. You can also get assistance by contacting the
appropriate commodity specialist team at your local district office at the U.S.
Customs Service, or by asking your Customs broker (a person you hire to
assist you in clearing your shipments through Customs). For more informa-
tion on working with commodity specialist teams, check out Chapter 3.
Knowing How to Classify 
Your Products for Tariffs
The United States subscribes to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United
States (HTSUS) to classify goods for the purpose of assessing duties. The
schedule’s assigned tariff classification code impacts the rate of duty applied.
Because duties can vary from product to product, you need to make sure that
you know the proper classification to minimize duties and eliminate prob-
lems at the time your goods enter the United States.
You can get assistance in finding the right code by talking to the commodity
specialist team (see the preceding section). You can also request a written,
binding ruling from CBP for the proper HTSUS classification and rate of duty
for your merchandise. For more information on binding rulings, check out
Chapter 3.
Checking to See Whether You Qualify 
for Preferential Duty Programs
You may be eligible to benefit from preferential duty programs such as the
Generalized System of Preferences, the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA), the Dominican Republic–Central American Free Trade Agreement
(DR-CAFTA), the Caribbean Basin Initiative, and so on. As an importer, if you
don’t take advantage of these programs, you may be subject to duties that
236
Part V: The Part of Tens 

you otherwise could have avoided, which makes the transaction more expen-
sive for you. (For more information on preferential duty programs, turn to
Chapters 3 and 16.)
Researching Quota Requirements
Before you import certain commodities into the United States, you need to
research general quota information and quota requirements. An import quota
is a limit on the amount of a certain commodity that can be imported into the
United States during a specific period of time (see Chapter 16). There are two
types of quotas:
 Absolute quotas: Absolute quotas usually apply to textiles but can, in
some instances, apply to other goods. They limit the amount of goods
that may enter into the commerce of the United States during a specific
period. When that limit has been reached, no additional goods are
allowed into the United States.
 Tariff rate quotas: Tariff rate quotas permit a specified quantity of an
item at a reduced rate of duty during the quota period. After that quota
has been reached, the goods can still enter the country but at a higher
rate of duty.
If the item you’re importing is under an absolute quota, and the quota has
been closed, the goods that you import will not be allowed into the country.
They’ll either have to be returned to the seller or placed, at your expense,
into a Customs-controlled warehouse until a new quota has been opened.
For more information on how to access quota information, turn to Chapter 16.
Checking the Reputation 
of Your Foreign Seller
You need to check the reputation, reliability, and financial status of your
prospective trading partner. If your foreign seller has a questionable reputa-
tion, you’ll want to select the method of payment that will protect the import
against the sellers’ nonperformance. (For more on methods of payment and
their impact on you, check out Chapter 14.)
You can access information on the foreign seller through a U.S. Commercial
Services program called the International Company Profile (www.export.
gov/salesandmarketing/ICP.asp). Also, be sure to ask a prospective
foreign seller for references and follow up with them over the phone.
237
Chapter 17: Ten Keys to Becoming a Successful Importer

Understanding INCOTERMS
As an importer, you have to understand the costs, responsibilities, rights, and
obligations that accompany the use of a specific INCOTERM (see Chapter 13).
Every time a supplier submits a quotation for goods to you, the quotation
must include a term of sale. If you don’t understand the specific INCOTERM,
you may overestimate or underestimate the costs associated with the goods
that you’ll be importing.
Analyzing Your Insurance Coverage
Make sure to analyze the amount of insurance on your import transaction.
Weather, rough handling of cargo by carriers, long distances, and other
common hazards make it important that you determine the type, amount,
and extent of coverage required. You need to make sure that you identify
who’ll be responsible for insurance against loss or damage while the goods
are in transit.
If the foreign seller quotes using the term CIF (short for cost, insurance, and
freight), the seller/exporter will be responsible for obtaining the insurance. If
any other shipping term is used, insurance is your responsibility; contact an
international insurance carrier or your Customs broker for more information
(see Chapters 14 and 15).
Don’t assume, or even take the seller’s word, that adequate insurance has
been obtained. If the seller neglects to obtain adequate coverage, damage to
the cargo may cause you a major financial loss, so make sure that exporter/
seller includes a certificate of insurance with all the other required shipping
documents.
Knowing What’s in the 
Purchase Contract
The purchase contract should include any issue deemed significant by either
the buyer or the seller. Any purchase contract must deal with issues such as
product acceptance, product warranties, and dispute resolution procedures.
(For more on purchase contracts, turn to Chapter 6.)
If you enter into an import transaction without a formal written purchase
contract, you can be exposed to many significant risks over which you won’t
be able to exercise much control.
238
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Hiring a Customs Broker
Although you have the right as an importer to file a Customs entry on your
own behalf, if you’re a first-time importer you’ll want to consult a licensed
Customs broker (a private business that handles the clearance of imported
goods for you). Customs brokers are licensed by U.S. Customs and Border
Protection (CBP). Importing procedures can be very complicated, and hiring
a Customs broker can facilitate this process and minimize any potential
future problems (see Chapter 16).
You can view a list of Customs brokers licensed to conduct business in a spe-
cific port by visiting the CBP Web site (www.cbp.gov). Click the Ports tab on
the CBP home page; select the state and port where your goods will enter the
United States; and scroll down and click the “Brokers: View List” link.
Staying on Top of Recordkeeping
You have to comply with all recordkeeping requirements of Customs. This
includes keeping all documents relating to imports for a period of five years.
Customs has the right to inspect the documents, to determine if you have
complied with U.S. Customs laws. (For more on the kinds of records you need
to keep, check out Chapter 16.)

In This Chapter
 Identifying the keys to becoming a successful exporter
 Understanding some of the major mistakes to avoid
 Knowing the pitfalls to watch out for
You can get involved in exporting in numerous ways — from filling orders
for a domestic supplier (such as an export management company) to
exporting your own products. Many businesses — small, medium, or large —
are excited about the idea of doing business internationally as a way to
increase your sales and profits. Remember: Every U.S. manufacturer that
does not currently sell its goods overseas can be a potential client for you.
Exporting is a challenge, and it isn’t as easy as it may initially appear. You
have to take the time to select the right product, understand the applicable
rules and regulations in both the United States and the importing country,
identify your customers, and find out about the different payment and ship-
ping alternatives. However you choose to export, developing a detailed and
thorough strategy is an important part of the planning process.
In this chapter, I cover the ten keys that are critical to becoming a successful
exporter.
Identifying Your Market
If you’re interested in exporting, you need to identify foreign export markets
for your products. Without the right market, you won’t be able to do any
business. Thorough market research also helps you understand the eco-
nomic, political, and cultural factors that will impact your ability to success-
fully sell your product. This kind of information is readily available through

government agencies and business-related organizations such as foreign
trade associations, chambers of commerce, and trade commission offices.
(You can find more information on identifying your market in Chapter 8.)
Visit www.export.gov and register to become part of the user community.
The site provides a wealth of readily accessible data at no cost, and can
assist you in identifying overseas markets for U.S. goods and services. The
advantage of these resources is that they come from trade experts located in
countries around the world. Because their expertise comes from hands-on
involvement (as opposed to second-hand information), you can be assured
that the data that they provide is good.
Each individual market has different demands, and these demands can change.
Changes in technology, lifting of trade barriers, and adjustments in import/
export regulations are all factors that may impact the level and direction of
international trade. These factors can have an influence, and you may need
to consider adjusting your marketing and export strategies for the current
situation.
Assessing Product Potential
As an exporter, you need to focus on what your product does and identify
what needs it will satisfy in the foreign market. You also need to identify the
strengths and weakness of your product in comparison to available competi-
tive products. Take a look at Chapters 5, 8, and 9 to get more information
about selecting a product, assessing its potential, and developing an overall
product strategy targeted toward your customer.
A product may be successful in the United States, but that isn’t any guarantee
that it’ll be just as successful in a foreign market. There may be no need for
the product in the foreign country, or the product may need to be modified.
Preparing a product for export requires not just knowledge of the product,
but also an awareness of many unique characteristics for each of the differ-
ent markets you may be targeting. Cultural differences and local customs
may also require product modifications in areas such as branding, packaging,
and labeling. Awareness of and sensitivity to cultural differences are critical
to a successful product introduction.
Different countries can have different product standards, and you need to
understand the need to conform if you want to do business internationally.

Information (NCSCI) provides this information for nonagricultural products;

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Familiarizing Yourself with Export
Controls and Licensing Requirements
Exporting can expose your business to laws and regulations that you may not
be familiar with. All kinds of different rules can impact your ability to suc-
cessfully do business in foreign markets. One of these is U.S. export controls,
which take the form of prohibitions, restrictions, and licensing requirements.
A key to being a successful exporter is being aware of these issues. Violation
of these laws can have significant repercussions, from the government seizing
your products to a denial of your privilege to export to fines and imprison-
ment. (For more information on export rules and regulations, see Chapter 3.)
Investigating Import Controls
Before exporting your product to a foreign market, you need to identify
whether the country you’re exporting to has any import controls related to
the sale of your product. These controls can include prohibitions, restric-
tions, or import licensing requirements, and they can be based on country 
of origin, product type, or product characteristics. Products that violate
these controls are generally not allowed to enter the importing country.
Import documentation requirements and other regulations imposed by foreign
governments vary from one country to the next. You need to be aware of the
regulations that apply to your own operations and transactions. (For addi-
tional information, see Chapter 3.)
Understanding U.S. Export Laws
You have to be aware of your responsibilities when it comes to U.S. export
laws. These laws are designed to make sure that U.S. exports go only to
legally authorized destinations. For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act prohibits a U.S. exporter from offering to pay a commission to a foreign
government official, friend, or relative to get the business. The Anti-Boycott
Act prohibit Americans from participating in foreign boycotts or taking actions
that further or support such boycotts against other countries friendly to the
United States. (For more on these laws, check out Chapter 3.)
243
Chapter 18: Ten Keys to Becoming a Successful Exporter

Making Sense of INCOTERMS
As an exporter, you need to understand the costs, responsibilities, rights, and
obligations that accompany the use of a specific INCOTERM (see Chapter 13).
Every time you prepare a quotation for a customer, the quotation must
include a term of sale. If you fail to clearly identify the specific INCOTERM to
your customer, that can lead to an overestimatation or underestimation of
costs associated with the goods that you’ll be selling, which can ultimately
lead to the loss of a sale.
Making Sure You Have the Right
Insurance Coverage
You need to analyze the amount of insurance on your export transaction.
Weather, rough handling of cargo by carriers, long distances, and other
common hazards make it important that you determine the type, amount,
and extent of coverage required. Also, make sure that you identify who’ll 
be responsible for insurance against loss or damage while the goods are in
transit (see Chapter 15).
If you quote to your customer and use the term CIF (short for cost, insurance,
and freight), you’re the one responsible for obtaining the insurance, and you
must make sure to include a certificate of insurance with all the other required
shipping documents that you send to the importer. If you’re quoting with a
term of CIF and you don’t have an international insurance carrier, contact
your freight forwarder (see Chapter 15) and discuss the option of using its
cargo insurance policy.
If any other shipping term is used, the importer is responsible for securing
the insurance.
Focusing on Foreign Market Risk 
and Methods of Payments
When you’re selecting a method of payment in an export transaction, you
need to identify the primary risk factors and then evaluate them to choose
the one that’s best for you. Remember: Getting an order is only one step in
the process. You also have to make sure that you’re going to get paid. Being
paid in full and on time is critical to success, and the level of risk in extending
credit is a major consideration (see Chapter 14).
244
Part V: The Part of Tens 

There are two primary risk factors that you need be aware of:
 Country risks: Country risk factors include economic and political sta-
bility, the legal system, and the foreign exchange rate.
 Commercial risks: Commercial risk factors include company ownership/
management, financial performance, market share, and payment history.
Keeping Track of Documentation
Even though the actual purchase order you receive from your overseas cus-
tomer is the most important document that you’ll receive, you have to get
familiar with many other documents before exporting your goods. A wide
variety of documents are used in exporting; which of them is required in 
specific transactions depends on the requirements of the U.S. government
and the government of the importing country (see Chapter 15).
Because the processing of these documents can be a formidable task, consider
having a freight forwarder handle this portion of the transaction. Freight for-
warders are specialists in this process. (See the following section for more on
freight forwarders.)
Hiring a Freight Forwarder
An international freight forwarder acts as an agent on your behalf and assists
in moving the cargo from the point of origin to the ultimate overseas destina-
tion. Freight forwarders are familiar with the import rules and regulations of
foreign countries, U.S. export regulations, methods of shipment, and required
documents relating to foreign trade.
A freight forwarder can assist you in preparing price quotations by advising
on freight costs, port charges, consular fees, costs of special documentation,
insurance costs, and handling fees. They recommend the packing methods
that will protect the merchandise during transit or can arrange to have the
merchandise packed at the port or put in containers. (For more information
about the benefits of working with a freight forwarder, and how to go about
locating and choosing one, go to Chapter 15.)
If you use the services of a freight forwarder, you won’t have to deal with
many of the details involved with the exporting of your goods. Fees charged
by forwarders are modest, plus they have access to shipping discounts. The
experience and constant attention to detail provided by the forwarder is a
good investment and a key to success.

against the risk of loss or damage while the goods are in transit.
countertrade: A trading arrangement in which the seller/exporter is required
to accept goods, services, or other instruments of trade, in partial or whole
payment for his products. It usually requires the exporter to find markets for

Government Assistance Programs
Several federal, state, and local agencies offer programs to assist U.S.
exporters. Some are guarantee programs that require the participation of a
lender, while others may provide direct loans or grants. All programs aim to
improve the exporters’ access to credit by providing guarantees to financial
institutions to reduce their risk associated with loans to exporters.
The Export-Import Bank 
of the United States
The Export-Import (Ex-Im) Bank of the United States is an independent U.S.
government agency that facilitates the U.S. export of goods and services by
providing loans, guarantees, and insurance programs to exporters. The Ex-Im
Bank provides financing both pre- and post-export:
 Pre-export financing: Through the Ex-Im Bank’s Working Capital
Guarantee Program, lenders can provide financing to exporters for the
purpose of purchasing or producing a product for export. If the exporter
defaults on the loan, the Ex-Im Bank reimburses the lender the guaran-
teed portion of the loan.
 Post-export financing: The Ex-Im Bank provides commercial and politi-
cal risk insurance. If the buyer fails to pay, Ex-Im Bank reimburses the
exporter in accordance with the terms of the policy.
You can get specific information about the Ex-Im Bank’s programs by contact-
ing the Business Development Group, Export-Import Bank, 811 Vermont Ave.
NW, Washington, DC 20571 (phone: 202-565-3946; Web: www.exim.gov).

Department of Agriculture
The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) provides several programs in financing the export 
of U.S. agricultural products:
 Export credit guarantee programs: The USDA administers export credit
guarantee programs for commercial financing of U.S. agricultural exports.
These CCC programs encourage exports to buyers in countries where
credit is necessary to maintain or increase U.S. sales, but where financ-
ing may not be available without CCC guarantees.
 Export Enhancement Program (EEP): The EEP helps products produced
by U.S. farmers meet competition from subsidizing countries, especially
the European Union. Under the program, the USDA pays cash to exporters
as bonuses, allowing them to sell U.S. agricultural products in targeted
countries at prices below the exporter’s costs of acquiring them. Major
objectives of the program are to expand U.S. agricultural exports and to
challenge unfair trade practices.
You can find more information on USDA programs by contacting the USDA,
Foreign Agricultural Service, 1400 Independence Ave. SW, Washington, DC
20250 (phone: 202-720-3224; Web: www.fas.usda.gov).
Small Business Administration
Small Business Administration (SBA) programs provide financial assistance
to businesses interested in exporting but that may not be able to obtain trade
financing. All applying firms must qualify as a small business under the SBA’s
size standards. The SBA defines a small business as any independently owned
and operated business that is not dominant in its competitive area and does
not employ more than 500 people.
 Export Working Capital Program: Under this program, a business can
get a loan guarantee to finance the working capital (money needed to
meet day-to-day operating expenses) needs associated with processing
an order for a single- or multiple-export transaction. The purpose of this
program is to assist businesses that are able to generate export sales,
but need financial assistance to support these sales. The goal of the 
program is to ensure that qualified small-business exporters don’t lose
viable export sales due to a lack of working capital.
 Export Express Program: The Export Express Program assists small
businesses in developing or expanding their export markets. The pro-
ceeds of these loans may be used to finance export development activi-
ties such as:
262
Part VI: Appendixes 

• Standby letters of credit when required as a bid bond, performance
bond, or advance payment guarantee.
A standby letter of credit is a letter of credit issued by the bank on
behalf of its customer (the exporter) to serve as a guarantee to the
beneficiary of the letter of credit (the importer) that the bank’s
customer will perform a specified contract with the beneficiary
(that is, to make the shipment of the goods) and, if the customer
defaults, the beneficiary may draw funds against the letter of credit
as penalties or as payments. A standby letter of credit is also
referred to as a performance bond.
• Participation in a foreign trade show.
• Translation of product brochures or catalogs for use in overseas
markets.
• General lines of credit for export purposes.
• Service contracts from buyers located outside the United States.
• Transaction-specific financing needs associated with completing
actual export orders.
• Purchase of real estate and equipment to be used in the produc-
tion of goods or services for export.
• Term loans and other financing to enable small businesses, includ-
ing export trading companies and export management companies,
to develop foreign markets.
• Acquisition, construction, renovation, modernization, improvement,
or expansion of productive facilities or equipment to be used in the
United States in the production of goods or services for export.
For more information on SBA programs, contact the SBA at 800-827-5722 or
visit www.sba.gov. You can also contact your local SBA field office; look in
the government pages of your local phone book or visit www.sba.gov/

Appendix C
Distributor and Agency 
Agreement Outlines
W
hen you decide to go into the import/export business, you have to
decide whether to organize your business as a distributor (a middle-
man who purchases goods and takes title to them) or as an agent (a 
middleman who does not take title to the goods). (For more on distributors
and agents, check out Chapter 2.) With either option, you’re developing a
business relationship with another company, and understanding the obliga-
tions and responsibilities of all parties is important.
In this appendix, I provide two outlines — one for distributors, and another
for agents — that you can use in your discussions with other companies.
These outlines are not a substitute for professional legal advice, so be sure to
consult an attorney if you have any questions about an agreement.
Agreements can be written, verbal, or implied by the actions of the parties
involved. The best approach is always to get it in writing. A written agreement
clarifies the terms, conditions, and duties of the parties involved, and, if nec-
essary, provides strong legal protection if a misunderstanding arises.
International Distributor 
Agreement Outline
Large businesses can afford to set up branches in distant markets and handle
their own distribution. Most other importers or exporters, including those
who are just starting out in the business, have to rely on independent distrib-
utors to buy and then distribute their products.

You can use the distribution agreement outline in this section in two situations:
 When you decide to export and do business in another country, you may
want to appoint a distributor to handle the distribution of the products
in that country. You can use the outline in this section in developing an
agreement between you (a U.S. exporter) and your distributor in
another country.
 When you decide to import products from a particular supplier, you may
eventually want to ask the overseas supplier if you can be appointed a
distributor of that product in the United States. You can use the outline
in this section in developing an agreement between a foreign supplier
and you (a U.S. importer and distributor).
The selection of an independent distributor may be the most critical decision
an exporter makes. Exporters must carefully check a prospective distributor
before entering into a relationship with that distributor. So whether you’re
the exporter, and you’re finding an international distributor to work with, or
you’re the distributor working with an overseas exporter, you should expect
to ask and answer lots of questions.
A distribution agreement is the basic legal contract that an exporter has with
a distributor. The essential ingredients of all distribution agreements are the
same:
 Territory: The distributor’s territory.
 Exclusive or nonexclusive: Whether the distributor has exclusive or
nonexclusive distribution rights.
 Performance: Minimum performance requirements that the distributor
must achieve.
 Products: The products covered by the distribution agreement.
 Price and payment terms: A detailed price schedule and payment terms.
 Shipping terms, risk of loss (see Chapter 3): These are an integral part
of the sales agreement, because the different terms will provide informa-
tion about which expenses are the responsibilities of each party in the
transaction, and also will indicate where title will pass from the exporter
to the importer.
 Restrictions on the distributor carrying competitive products: This
part of the agreement will clearly explain what may be considered a
competitive product and an understanding as to whether a distributor
can handle a competitive line of products.
 Term of the distribution agreement: No agreement should be open
ended. Every agreement should provide the conditions under which it
can be terminated or it should specify that the agreement is valid for a
certain agreed to period of time (for example, one year).
296
Part VI: Appendixes 

Most disputes between an exporter and a distributor arise out of different
expectations about their obligations to each other. This distribution agree-
ment outline details each party’s expectations and reduces the possibility of
any future surprises.
Part 1: Details about the Distributor 
This part of the agreement includes information about the distributor such as
the formal name of the business, the list of principals, the mailing address,
the e-mail address, and the phone and fax numbers.
1.1. Name (of the company).
1.2. (Hereinafter referred to as the “Distributor”).
1.3. Address.
1.4. Telephone.
1.5. Facsimile.
1.6. E-mail.
1.7. Name of Principal (the owner of the company).
Part 2: Territorial Limitations
This part of the agreement covers whether there will be any limitation as to
where and to whom the distributor may sell the products. For example, let’s
say I’m a U.S. manufacturer of disposable medical supplies and I manufacture
a line of products that may be sold over the counter (adhesive bandages,
cotton balls, and so on) as well as a similar line of products that may be tar-
geted to hospitals. I could appoint a distributor in, for example, Saudi Arabia,
and I could specify that this distributor in Saudi Arabia will be my distributor
for sales to hospitals. Then I could appoint a different company to be my dis-
tributor in Saudi Arabia for sales to supermarkets, drugstores, and so on.
This part of the agreement is where all this would be spelled out.
2.1. By geographic area.
2.2. By type or class of customer.
2.3. A combination of 2.1 and 2.2 above.
297
Appendix C: Distributor and Agency Agreement Outlines

Part 3: Exclusivity
This part of the agreement outlines whether the producer of the product can
appoint other distributors in the area. Let’s say a pewter giftware manufac-
turer in Bolivia has given me products to sell in New York. The issue that
needs to addressed in this part of the agreement is if my agreement with the
Bolivian manufacturer is exclusive or if the Bolivian manufacturer can sell
goods to someone else in New York.
Also covered in this part of the agreement is whether the distributor can sell
outside of the territory. If I’m a distributor and I’m given pewter giftware to
sell in New York, and I get a call from a customer in Connecticut, will the
agreement allow me to sell the goods outside of the territory?
3.1. Can the Client (the business appointing the distributor) appoint
other distributors in the same territory?
3.2. Can the Distributor sell outside the territory?
3.3. Can the Client sell direct to certain “house accounts”? (These might
be accounts in the Distributor’s territory that were obtained directly by
the Client through the Client’s own marketing efforts.)
3.4. Client shall refer all inquiries from potential customers within the
Distributor’s territory.
3.5. Can the Client license someone else to manufacture the products? In
and/or outside the territory?
Part 4: Minimum Performance
Requirements
This part of the agreement covers whether the distributor has to meet any
minimum sales targets. For example, if I’m the distributor in the United States
appointed by the Bolivian pewter giftware manufacturer, will I be required to
meet certain sales targets during the term of the agreement, and what hap-
pens if I don’t meet those sales targets?
4.1. The Distributor should be required to meet certain purchase targets
during the term of the agreement. Specify the minimum purchasing
requirements.
4.2. Determine the consequences of failing to meet those targets.
4.2.1. Option to terminate contract.
4.2.2. Loss of exclusivity.
298
Part VI: Appendixes 

4.2.3. Reduction in size of territory.
4.2.4. Other penalty (specify).
Part 5: Products Covered by Agreement
This part of the agreement provides a complete list of the products that will
be covered by the agreement. Will it be the entire product line or will the
agreement be limited to certain products?
5.1. What products of the Client are covered?
5.2. What about other products manufactured by the Client?
5.3. What about new products?
Part 6: Price of the Products
Any agreement should also include a price list and the corresponding terms
of sale (see Chapter 13). The term of sale indicates who will be responsible
for what expenses as the product moves from the manufacturer to the dis-
tributor, and also says who will be responsible for shipping, forwarding fees,
Customs, and so on.
6.1. Attach a current price schedule to the agreement.
6.1.1. Note any volume discounts.
6.2. What are the terms of sales (INCOTERMS — for example, ex-works,
FAS, FOB, C&F, CIF)?
6.3. Does the price include these items?
6.3.1. Customs brokerage.
6.3.2. Demurrage and storage charges.
6.3.3. Inland freight.
6.3.4. Inland freight insurance.
6.3.5. Applicable taxes.
6.3.6. Any other costs and expenses associated with the Customs clear-
ance procedure.
6.4. Mode of shipment: Air, sea, or land?
6.5. Will prices be quoted in U.S. dollars or in the currency of some other
country?
6.6. How much advance notice of price changes?
299
Appendix C: Distributor and Agency Agreement Outlines

Part 7: Risk of Loss
When you designate the term of sale in a transaction (see the preceding sec-
tion), that indicates where title will pass from one party to the other, which
indicates who is responsible for loss or damage while the goods are in transit.
7.1. When does the risk of loss pass from the Client to the Distributor?
Part 8: Maintenance of Stock and Parts
The agreement can also provide information as to whether or how much
inventory a distributor should have on hand at all times to meet demand and
provide service to the distributor’s customers. The meaning of adequate is
subject to negotiation, but it should be an amount of stock to satisfy demand
plus safety stock, which may serve as a buffer for any unexpected or
unplanned sales.
8.1. The Distributor shall maintain an adequate level of stock and spare
parts to service its customers. Be sure to define what constitutes an “ade-
quate” level.
Part 9: Payment Terms
This part of the agreement outlines the payment terms. Turn to Chapter 14
for complete information on alternative methods of payment that are
common in international transactions.
9.1. Cash in advance, letter of credit drawn at sight, time letter of 
credit, Letter of credit, bill of exchange (sight draft documents against
payment, sight draft documents against acceptance), open account, or
consignment?
Part 10: Ordering Procedure
This part of the agreement outlines how orders will be placed. Will they be
mailed, faxed, or electronically submitted? Will you use a standard purchase
order? Make sure to note that every purchase agreement must be signed and
include the order number, date of order, description of product, quantity,
price, payment terms, shipping instructions, recommended delivery date,
and any other special instructions.
300

Payment details.
Shipping instructions.

order by the Client and its shipment.

10.5. Stipulate a maximum order size predicated upon existing capacity
limitations.
10.6. Stipulate whether split deliveries and partial shipments shall be 
permitted.
10.7. Will the Distributor place an initial order simultaneously with the
execution of this Agreement?
Part 11: Promotional Strategy
This part of the agreement outlines the distributor’s responsibilities when it
comes to promotion. (For more on marketing and the development of a pro-
motion strategy, check out Chapter 8.)
11.1. Specify exactly what the Distributor will do in terms of promoting
products manufactured by the Client.
301
Appendix C: Distributor and Agency Agreement Outlines

11.2. Will such promotional efforts be paid for by the Distributor, or is the
Client expected to contribute?
11.3. Will the Client be providing any promotional materials? If so, at what
cost?
Part 12: Anticipated Purchase
Requirements
This part of the agreement provides a sales projection or forecast. The dis-
tributor needs to tell the producer of the goods about how much of the prod-
uct the distributor will need and when. This is only an estimate, but it’s a
guide that the producer can use in setting up a production schedule to meet
requirements.
12.1. The Distributor should provide the Client with its anticipated for-
ward requirements updated on a quarterly basis.
12.2. The Distributor will keep the Client abreast of important market
developments within the Territory including, without limitation:
12.2.1. Information about competitors, their products and prices.

12.2.3. Opportunities for further market development.
12.2.4. Upcoming trade shows.
12.2.5. Market research.
12.2.6. Any other market intelligence.

used to generate sales (such as advertisements, salespeople, travel, enter-
tainment, and so on). It includes what expenses the distributor will be reim-
bursed for.
13.1. Define what, if any, expenses of the Distributor are to be reimbursed
by the Client.

the drafting of an agency agreement. You can use this outline in the following
situations:
 You’re a U.S. exporter who would like to formalize an agreement with a
U.S. manufacturer relating to the rights to represent that company in
selling its products in specified foreign markets.
 You’re a U.S. exporter who would like to formalize an agreement with 
an agent and his representation of the sale of your products in foreign
markets.
 You’re a U.S. importer who would like to formalize an agreement with a
supplier overseas relating to the representation of the sales of the sup-
plier’s products in the United States.
Part 1: Brief Overview

following:
1.2.1. It shall pay the Agent an agreed to rate of commission for all sales
generated.
1.2.2. It shall reimburse the Agent for various expense items, as hereinafter
detailed in this agreement.
Optional:
