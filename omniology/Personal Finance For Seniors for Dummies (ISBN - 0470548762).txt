Praise for Eric Tyson
“Eric Tyson is doing something important — namely, helping people at 
all income levels to take control of their fi nancial futures. This book is a 
natural outgrowth of Tyson’s vision that he has nurtured for years. Like 
Henry Ford, he wants to make something that was previously accessible 
only to the wealthy accessible to middle-income Americans.”
 
— James C. Collins, coauthor of the national bestseller 
Built to Last; former Lecturer in Business, Stanford 
Graduate School of Business
“Personal Finance For Dummies is the perfect book for people who feel guilty 
about inadequately managing their money but are intimidated by all of the 
publications out there. It’s a painless way to learn how to take control.”
 
— National Public Radio’s Sound Money
“Eric Tyson . . . seems the perfect writer for a For Dummies book. He 
doesn’t tell you what to do or consider doing without explaining the 
why’s and how’s — and the booby traps to avoid — in plain English. . . . 
It will lead you through the thickets of your own fi nances as painlessly 
as I can imagine.”
 
— Chicago Tribune
“This book provides easy-to-understand personal fi nancial information 
and advice for those without great wealth or knowledge in this area. 
Practitioners like Eric Tyson, who care about the well-being of middle-
income people, are rare in today’s society.”
 
— Joel Hyatt, founder of Hyatt Legal Services, one of the 
nation’s largest general-practice personal legal service 
firms
“Worth getting. Scores of all-purpose money-management books reach 
bookstores every year, but only once every couple of years does a 
standout personal fi nance primer come along. Personal Finance For 
Dummies, by fi nancial counselor and columnist Eric Tyson, provides 
detailed, action-oriented advice on everyday fi nancial questions. . . . 
Tyson’s style is readable and unintimidating.”
 
— Kristin Davis, Kiplinger’s Personal Finance magazine
“This is a great book. It’s understandable. Other fi nancial books are too 
technical and this one really is different.”
 
— Business Radio Network

Dedication
Eric: This book is hereby and irrevocably dedicated to my family 
and friends, as well as to my counseling clients and customers, who 
ultimately have taught me everything that I know about how to 
explain fi nancial terms and strategies so that all of us may benefi t.
Bob: To the many readers of my newsletter, Retirement Watch. 
They are an intelligent, educated, hardworking, and practical 
bunch. Over the years they shared with me their problems, issues, 
and insights and inspired many of the ideas and recommendations 
in the newsletter. In many ways, we’ve worked together to develop 
the best ideas for our retirement plans.

Introduction
W
e’re all getting older, together.
Aging presents opportunities for increased wisdom and broader 
perspective as well as some increased challenges. One of those 
challenges that doesn’t get much discussion has to do with 
finances. The new, and sometimes more complex, financial deci-
sions that confront folks in their later working years and then in 
retirement can be tough to work through.
For example, consider the types of questions we, your humble 
authors, have been asked from folks in our advisory businesses:
 
✓ Can we afford to retire? How much can we comfortably spend 
per year given our assets?
 
✓ My employer is offering me pension options. How do I choose 
among them?
 
✓ I just left my employer (by choice or through layoff) and have 
some money in a retirement account. What should I do with it?
 
✓ How should I manage my investments now and in the years 
ahead?
 
✓ When should I begin collecting Social Security benefits?
 
✓ What’s the process for withdrawing money from my retirement 
accounts, and how can I minimize my tax hit from doing this?
 
✓ Should I buy an annuity? If so, what type?
 
✓ Are reverse mortgages a good idea?
 
✓ What types of additional medical insurance — long-term care 
insurance, Medicare supplement, and so on — do I need pre- 
and post-retirement?

2
Personal Finance For Seniors For Dummies 
 
✓ An agent is telling me to buy more and different life insurance. 
How much do I need and what type of life insurance should 
I buy?
 
✓ Do I need a will?
 
✓ Do I need an estate plan, and what should I do to protect my 
spouse, children, or significant other?
We wrote this book to answer these questions and many more that 
face you as you age and grapple with your finances during your 
senior years. We hope to not only answer your questions but to 
also make you aware of important issues you may not be aware of 
so you have plenty of time to consider them and make decisions 
that enhance your financial independence.
About This Book
As you can see from the title of this book, we use the term seniors 
to identify the intended audience. Book titles tend to be short and 
therefore have the potential to be misunderstood and misinter-
preted. Please allow us to explain here what we mean by Personal 
Finance For Seniors For Dummies.
Everyone needs to make financial decisions. Whether you’re rich, 
middle class, or poor, 48 or 84 years old, retired or still working 
two jobs, money passes through your hands every day. You spend 
money, need insurance, pay for housing, and probably have invest-
ments. Even if you wanted to, you couldn’t avoid money. As with 
your health, it’s better to do the best you can with your money 
(without becoming obsessed) to maximize your options and mini-
mize how long and hard you have to keep working for it.
No matter your situation, we’re excellently positioned to give you 
sound financial advice on the range of issues presented in this 
book. We each have decades of professional experience in the 
financial services industry. And, we have extensive training and 
background to provide expert personal financial and retirement 
advice.

What You’re Not to Read
We’ve written this book so you can find information easily and 
effortlessly understand what you find. And although we’d like to 
believe that you want to pore over every last word between the 
two yellow and black covers, we make it easy for you to identify 
“skippable” material. This information is the stuff that, although 
interesting, isn’t essential for you to know:
 
✓ Text in sidebars: The sidebars are the shaded boxes that 
appear here and there. They include helpful information and 
observations but aren’t necessary reading.
 
✓ Anything with a Technical Stuff icon attached: This informa-
tion is interesting but not critical to your understanding of the 
topic at hand.
Foolish Assumptions
When writing this book, we made some assumptions about you, 
Dear Reader:
 
✓ You’re age 50 or older and are approaching or are in retirement.
 
✓ You’re still in the workforce and have no plans to retire, which 
is fine and compatible with our approach in this book too.
 
✓ You want expert advice about important financial topics — 
such as getting out of high-interest consumer debt, planning 
for major goals, or investing — and you quickly want easy-to-
understand answers.
 
✓ You want a crash course in personal finance and are looking 
for a book you can read to help solidify major financial con-
cepts and begin thinking about your finances in a more com-
prehensive way.
 
✓ You’re just tired of picking up scattered piles of bills, receipts, 
and junk mail every time the kids chase the cat around the 
den, so you plan to use this book as a paperweight.

 Introduction
Throughout this book we offer many resources including Web 
sites and online tools to help you. For those of you who aren’t 
computer savvy, rest assured that we also provide plenty of alter-
native off-line resources and assistance.
How This Book Is Organized
Personal Finance For Seniors For Dummies is organized into five 
parts, and each part covers a major topic area. Within each part 
we include multiple chapters; each one delves into a particular 
issue in detail. Here’s an overview of what you can find in each 
part.
Part I: Working toward Retirement
You’ll make better financial decisions and have more attrac-
tive options in your golden years if you think ahead and plan in 
advance. Procrastination creates more long-term stress and prob-
lems. So in this part, we discuss the importance of balance in your 
life and keeping finances and money in perspective. While you’re 
still working, you also need to protect your employment income, 
so this part addresses that vital issue too.
This part also discusses the many important financial (and non-
financial) preparations for a successful and happy retirement. 
Even if you plan on working for many years to come (or even for 
the rest of your life), you should have a financial plan in place. 
Furthermore, a major issue that just about everyone needs to 
address is how to invest your money for growth, income, and 
safety as you approach retirement and hit your retirement years. 
The final chapter in this part deals with understanding the many 
complicated and conflicting rules governing retirement accounts. 
In addition, as you approach your retirement, evaluating and con-
trolling your spending takes on increasing importance.

Personal Finance For Seniors For Dummies 
Part II: Making Money Decisions 
in Retirement
After you’re retired (and even if you’re still working in your golden 
years), you have myriad financial issues to tackle. The first chapter 
in this part deals with why your annual expenses and budget are 
so important and how to best manage them. Next we discuss how 
to handle retirement account distributions so you have enough 
to live on now and in the years ahead and so you can minimize 
the government’s tax take. We also tackle housing issues, includ-
ing relocation, trading down, second homes, reverse mortgages, 
retirement communities, and more. Finally, we cover insurance 
issues such as determining whether you need life insurance and 
long-term care insurance.
Part III: Dealing with 
Government Programs
Whether you’re the independent sort or not, you’re bound to 
encounter government programs requiring some decisions 
and forms. So in this part, we discuss the major programs. For 
example, Social Security is a big kahuna that provides retirement 
income and some insurance protections. This part also discusses 
the details of the retiree health benefits provided at the federal 
level by Medicare and at the state level by Medicaid.
Part IV: Estate Planning: 
It’s More than Just Dead 
People and Lawyers
Death and taxes are certain and unfortunately come together at 
one’s passing. These and other reasons drive the importance of 
planning your estate no matter how large or modest it may be. 
In this part, we cover the basics of estate planning — we explain 

7
 Introduction
what you need to do and why. We also cover wills and other legal 
documents, such as living wills and medical powers of attorney as 
well as beneficiary designations on retirement accounts and life 
insurance policies. We devote a chapter to handling larger estates, 
including how to reduce their tax burdens and pass more of your 
money along to heirs and desired charities. Finally, we discuss the 
many different kinds of trusts and what each is good and not so 
good for.
Part V: The Part of Tens
No For Dummies book would be complete without the Part of Tens, 
which includes shorter chapters each summarizing ten important 
concepts. The chapters in this fun part cover the following topics: 
common mistakes made with retirement and estate planning, 
things to know about working during retirement, and tips for indi-
viduals caring for older parents.
Icons Used in This Book
The icons in this book help you find particular kinds of informa-
tion that may be of use to you. Here’s a rundown of what each icon 
means:
 
This target flags strategy recommendations for making the most of 
your money (for example, paying off your credit card debt with 
your lottery winnings).
 
When you see this icon, you’ll know the text next to it points out 
information that you definitely want to remember.
 
This icon marks things to avoid and points out common mistakes 
people make when managing their finances.

8
Personal Finance For Seniors For Dummies 
 
This icon alerts you to scams and scoundrels who prey on the 
unsuspecting.
 
The investigate icon tells you when you should consider doing 
some additional research. Don’t worry — we explain what to con-
sider and what to look out for.
 
This nerdy-looking guy appears beside discussions that aren’t 
critical to your understanding of the topic at hand. You can safely 
ignore these bits of text; however, reading them can help deepen 
and enhance your personal financial knowledge. This stuff also can 
come in handy if you’re ever on a game show or find yourself stuck 
on an elevator with a financial geek.
Where to Go from Here
This book is organized so you can go wherever you want to find 
complete information. Want advice on managing and tracking 
your expenses in retirement? See Chapter 6. If you’re interested in 
investing strategies and developing a retirement plan, cruise on 
over to Part II. If you’re not sure where you want to go, you may 
want to start with Part I. It gives you all the basic info you need to 
assess your financial situation and points to places where you can 
find more detailed information for improving it.
This book is basic enough to help a novice get his or her arms 
around thorny financial issues. But advanced readers also will be 
challenged to think about their finances in a new way and identify 
areas for improvement. Check out the table of contents for a chapter-
by-chapter rundown of what this book offers. You also can look 
up a specific topic in the index. Last but not least, you can turn to 
Chapter 1 and begin reading for a complete and thorough crash 
course in personal finance during your golden years.

Part I
Working toward 
Retirement

In this part . . .
W
hether you’re in your senior years or not, 
you should be planning ahead. In this 
part, we explain how to best plan for a secure 
financial future. And for the benefit of the remain-
der of your working years, we discuss how to pro-
tect a valuable asset — your employment income.
Furthermore, while most people don’t have a 
retirement plan, everyone should. So in this part, 
we explain how to develop a stellar plan, includ-
ing coverage of the best retirement investments 
and strategies. We also explain all the challenging 
retirement account rules.

Chapter 1
Looking Ahead to Your Future
In This Chapter
▶ Taking charge of your long-term plans
▶ Implementing retirement planning strategies
F
rom a young age, various adults in our lives tell us to plan 
ahead. Although it may be sunny and clear outside this morn-
ing, they tell us to take rain gear for this afternoon’s possible 
heavy rain. When packing for a day at the beach, they suggest sun-
screen and money for lunch. And do your best in high school, they 
say, because your transcript will in part determine which colleges 
accept you.
Although some parents provide guidance to their children on the 
topic of long-term financial planning, most don’t because they 
aren’t sufficiently knowledgeable or are reluctant to explain these 
things to their kids. And therein lays a pretty significant problem 
concerning finances for your senior years.
And retirement has its own set of trials. Unexpected life events 
(such as a loss of a job, the death of a loved one, or a major medical 
problem) and economic challenges can throw a wrench in the best 
plans. The severe recession and stock market decline in the late 
2000s — both of which were the worst in decades — highlighted 
other potential planning obstacles. Many near retirees and recent 
retirees caught off guard face the possible need to keep on working 
beyond typical retirement age, the need to reduce spending and 
make do with less (for example, one car rather than two), and the 
need to cope with diminished investment portfolios and declining 
home values.

12
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
These challenges can occur at any time during life, but they’re 
especially challenging when they happen when you’re in or near 
retirement. You have less time to make up for setbacks (and any 
mistakes you make) as you age. At some point in most folks’ lives, 
working longer or going back to work no longer are viable options. 
That’s why planning and regularly reviewing and re-evaluating 
your plans is essential.
We know many of you are reading this book having done little or 
no planning to this point. Although the ideal scenario is to start 
retirement planning as soon as you start work, we realize that’s 
not possible given the fact you’ve been in the workforce for a few 
decades. Don’t worry though. It’s never too late to start planning. 
Studies of retirees show those who are most content in retirement 
are those who did some amount of planning, even if it was a small 
amount. Planning is how you match your resources with your 
goals and expectations and identify where adjustments need to be 
made. Even if you’re already retired, planning now can improve 
the rest of your retirement. 
This chapter discusses important themes that run throughout the 
book: the value of planning ahead and getting on the best path as 
soon as possible, the importance of taking personal responsibility, 
and the significance of taking a long-term perspective to make the 
most of your senior years. We also discuss how to keep the right 
focus to optimize your retirement planning.
Planning for the Longer Term
Planning doesn’t sound fun and for many people, it isn’t one of 
life’s most enjoyable activities. But, nearly everyone values the 
benefits of proper planning: peace of mind, financial security, more 
options and choices, improved health, and a better lifestyle. 
During your senior years you have many choices about different 
financial issues. You can change some of the decisions after you 
make them, but others can’t be changed. If you do decide to make 
changes, you have fewer years to benefit from the new choices. 
That’s why as you approach your senior years, planning your 
finances is more important than it was earlier in life.

13
 Chapter 1: Looking Ahead to Your Future
In the following section, we discuss the important issues that war-
rant your planning attention, explain why you should be the person 
to take the most responsibility for making that happen (even if you 
hire some help), and quantify the value of your taking our advice.
Identifying long-term 
planning issues
What’s on your mind (or should be on your mind) regarding your 
financial future? Consider how many of the issues in the following 
sections require long-term planning.
Choosing among an employer’s pension options
You need to look not just years but decades into the future to 
determine which pension option may best meet your needs and 
those of your loved ones. A pension is an employer-provided 
retirement benefit from money that your employer puts away on 
your behalf, wherein you receive a monthly payment based on 
your years of service and earnings. A pension typically is just one 
of several sources of retirement income you may have (the others 
typically being Social Security and personal savings), so you must 
consider how these will fit together over many years. 
Pensions (check out Chapter 7 for more info) differ from other 
sources of income, such as 401(k)s, IRAs, profit-sharing plans, and 
employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs), mainly in that only pen-
sions guarantee you a fixed payment backed by your employer. 
With other types of retirement savings, the amount you receive in 
retirement depends on the amount you contribute and how you 
invest the account. See Chapter 5 for more info on other retire-
ment accounts.
Leaving an employer and deciding what to 
do with your retirement account money
When you change jobs, get laid off, or retire, you often are faced 
with choices about when and how to withdraw money from retire-
ment accounts — such as 401(k)s or 403(b)s — and minimizing the 

14
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
tax hit from doing so. Moving money is a decision you have to make 
today, but don’t make light of this decision because the decision 
affects how much money you’ll have in the decades to come.
 
Some employer plans allow you to keep retirement money in place 
even if you’re no longer employed with the company. You may 
choose to accept the offer to keep money in place if it’s a plan 
with good investment options and low costs. Planning retirement 
account withdrawals requires long-term tax planning if you want to 
make the withdrawals in the best way possible. For more informa-
tion on handling retirement accounts, see Chapter 5.
Determining whether you can afford to retire 
and how much you can safely spend per year
To assess whether you can afford to retire and how much you’ll 
be able to spend after you do retire, you have to do some analysis 
relating to your spending habits and investing holdings and tem-
perament. And, to be sure that you don’t run out of money or come 
close to running out of money, you also need to consider a wide 
range of scenarios for how your investments may perform in the 
years ahead. You can’t assume investments will return their historic 
averages each year. In fact, we’ve seen some stock indexes generate 
low returns or even negative returns over periods of a decade or 
more. See Part II for more information on each of these issues.
 
As with other aspects in life, differentiate between the things you 
can control and the things that you can’t. The economy will go 
through recessions and the stock market will decline. Predicting 
their timing, depth, and duration is beyond anyone’s control. 
Although you can’t control these events, you can be prepared for 
them. Your plan should reflect that by having some flexibility and, 
if possible, a cushion. For example, you can control some of your 
spending and how much risk you take investing.
Deciding when to begin collecting Social Security
Deciding when to begin collecting your Social Security is a com-
plicated decision that’s impacted by many factors, including tax 
laws, your earnings and your spouse’s earnings, and marital status, 

15
 Chapter 1: Looking Ahead to Your Future
among others. As we discuss in Chapter 10, you have to look years 
and decades ahead to make an appropriate and successful decision.
Considering a reverse mortgage
Reverse mortgages are becoming increasingly popular to provide 
supplemental retirement income to cash-poor (and relatively 
house-rich) elderly. With a reverse mortgage, you receive payments 
(or a lump sum) from the lender. Interest on the loan (and fees) 
compounds, but the debt doesn’t have to be paid until the home 
is sold. When you consider taking out this type of mortgage, you 
should do plenty of long-term analysis to compare your options 
and be sure you’re getting the right one for your situation. See 
Chapter 8 for the details.
Contemplating additional medical insurance
Health insurance is always a prickly issue to deal with because it’s 
difficult to know what medical issues you may be facing 5, 10, 20, 
or more years from now. Sure you can gain a general sense from 
your parents and from the types of medical issues that seniors 
confront, but only time will tell what unique issues you’ll confront. 
Different options you have to consider pre- and post-retirement 
are long-term care insurance (see Chapter 9 for more info) and 
Medicare supplements (refer to Chapter 11).
Weighing the option to buy more 
or different life insurance
When others are dependent on your employment income, you may 
need some life insurance coverage. And, depending on your spe-
cific assets, the type of life insurance you may most benefit from 
may change over the years. 
 
To determine your life insurance needs, you should have a good 
sense of your current financial assets and current and future obliga-
tions. Refer to Chapter 2 for more information on evaluating your 
need for life insurance.

16
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
Developing your estate plan
Your financial circumstances of course will change in the years 
ahead, and so too will tax and probate laws. Planning your estate 
involves many issues, including ensuring your own financial secu-
rity, taking care of your affairs in the event you’re unable to do so 
yourself, and protecting and providing for your heirs. Head to Part 
IV to find out more.
Be aware of and involved in your investments
Keeping a close eye on your investments 
and knowing what’s going on with your 
money is important, particularly during 
your senior years. You should never 
blindly trust someone with your money.
Consider the victims who lost tens of 
billions of dollars to hedge fund Ponzi-
schemer Bernard Madoff, many of whom 
were near or in retirement. The prime 
targets of the Madoff scam (and of most 
financial scams) were people in their 50s 
and older who worry about their standard 
of living and income, though they’re what 
most people consider financially com-
fortable. Within this group was another 
target group: Entrepreneurs and suc-
cessful professionals. Risk-taking usu-
ally is part of their personal profiles, and 
risk-takers often are attracted to unique 
and little-known strategies. That’s why 
con artists seek them. 
Madoff investors lost so much money 
in such a total fraud primarily because 
of a lack of homework. Victims failed to 
conduct proper research (or even any 
research) on Madoff’s claimed returns. 
They simply invested with Madoff due to 
the recommendations of others investing 
with him. With a private money manager 
like Madoff, investors should have been 
far better educated regarding his invest-
ing options and conducted lots of due 
diligence. They should have insisted on 
knowing what his investment strategy 
was and how it was supposed to work. 
They should have reviewed audited 
statements of the amount of assets he 
claimed to be managing. If they had, they 
would have noticed that the market for 
the stock options he claimed to be trad-
ing wasn’t big enough to support his port-
folio, much less all the other investors’ 
trading options.
Interestingly, it has come out that Madoff 
largely refused to provide much informa-
tion to inquisitive prospective investors 
and essentially blew them off and turned 
them away. In retrospect, such behavior 
makes sense because Madoff wasn’t 
interested and didn’t need to accept 
money from investors who were asking 
too many questions. After all, they may 
have uncovered his enormous fraud.

 Chapter 1: Looking Ahead to Your Future
Taking personal responsibility 
for your financial future
Our lives are filled with responsibilities — jobs, family obligations, 
bills, household maintenance, you name it. We all try to make time 
for friends, fun, and recreation as well.
With all these competing demands, it’s no wonder that many folks 
find that planning for their financial future continually gets pushed 
to the back burner. Most people don’t have the time, desire, or 
expertise to make good financial decisions. But, you’ve taken a 
huge step to erase those obstacles in buying this book. We provide 
sound counsel and advice, and now you’re investing the time and 
energy to get on a better path toward retirement.
 
From this point forward, we urge you to always remember that 
you — and only you — can take full responsibility for your financial 
future. Of course, you can hire advisors or delegate certain issues 
to a willing and competent spouse or other beloved relative. But, 
at the end of the day, it’s your money on the line, and you had 
better take an interest in it! Delegating your responsibilities without 
knowledge, understanding, and some involvement is a recipe for 
disaster. You could end up without vital insurance, be taken advan-
tage of in terms of fees, or even defrauded among other unsavory 
outcomes. Check out the nearby sidebar for an example.
Saving and planning sooner 
and smarter pays off
Throughout this book, we discuss financial strategies and tac-
tics for making the most of your money over the coming decades 
of your life. The sooner you get control over and optimize your 
finances, the bigger your payoff will be.
 
You should never rush into making changes that you don’t under-
stand and haven’t had time to properly research. Procrastination 
comes with many costs, including lost financial opportunities. 

18
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
Creating a financial plan and sticking to it is so important 
when planning for retirement. Chapter 3 helps you make your 
own plan.
Consider, for example, something that nearly everyone wants to 
do: save and invest for future financial goals such as retirement. 
Take the case of the Fuller family, who came to Eric for financial 
counseling years ago. The Fuller’s enjoyed a healthy and relatively 
stable income yet they saved little, if any, money annually. They 
knew how to spend money!
In terms of savings, they had about $100,000, which sounds like a 
lot but given their annual income ($150,000) and ages (late-40s), 
they still hadn’t accumulated savings equal to a year’s worth of 
income. The money they had wasn’t well invested — nearly all of it 
was in low-interest bank accounts and a pricey life insurance policy 
that provided just $500,000 of coverage (not near enough given 
their incomes and the fact that they had dependent children). Of 
course, they could have done worse (at least the money was grow-
ing slowly). However, they weren’t going to reach their retirement 
goals unless their money started working harder for them.
Over a number of months, the Fullers worked with Eric and were 
able to implement the following changes, which they stuck with for 
the years that followed:
 
✓ They increased their savings rate. They were able to consis-
tently save about 15 percent of their annual incomes (about 
$22,500 per year), which was up from just 4 percent ($6,000). 
They accomplished this through a combination of reduced 
spending and reduced taxes by directing their savings into tax-
advantaged retirement accounts including a 401(k) and SEP-IRA.
 
 “Cutting our expenses was easier than I thought. We were 
wasting money on things we didn’t really need or even use in 
some cases,” said Mrs. Fuller. Her husband added, “We felt 
much more relaxed and less stressed by cutting our expenses 
and boosting our savings.”
 
✓ They improved their investment returns. Rather than earn-
ing a meager 2 percent per year by having their money in low-
interest bank accounts, the Fuller’s enjoyed 8 percent annual 

19
 Chapter 1: Looking Ahead to Your Future
returns by investing in a diverse mix of stocks around the 
world along with some high-quality bonds.
 
✓ They purchased better insurance coverage. The Fullers 
needed about $1.5 million of life insurance coverage — triple 
the amount they had been carrying. They were able to buy 
that increased level of coverage along with some additional 
needed disability insurance by raising their deductibles on 
some other insurance policies and by switching to lower-cost 
(but still high-quality) providers.
So what were these changes worth to the Fullers? As they them-
selves said, they had much more peace of mind and comfort with 
their new financial situation. In the remaining part of this sec-
tion, we briefly examine the true financial value to them over the 
decades following the changes.
If the Fullers had continued saving as they had been (saving just 
4 percent of their incomes yearly and earning a paltry 2 percent 
return on their investments), in 10 years (when they reached their 
late-50s), they would have accumulated $188,000. This would have 
put them in a relatively poor situation for their future retirements 
given their annual income of $150,000.
On the other hand, the changes (saving 15 percent annually and 
instead earning an average investment return of 8 percent yearly) 
would lead the Fullers to have more than $541,000 in 10 years — 
nearly triple what they would have had if they hadn’t made changes. 
The differences are even more dramatic looking 20 years out. Check 
out Table 1-1 to see the calculations.

Part I: Working toward Retirement 
By making sensible changes, the Fullers are well positioned to 
retire with a hefty nest egg. (In fact, they could consider retire-
ment sooner.) In the absence of those changes, however, they 
would have a small amount and be unable to even come close to 
maintaining their lifestyle during retirement.
Eyeing Keys to Successful 
Retirement Planning
Although you may like to consider other factors — such as your 
health, relationships with friends and family, and interests and 
activities — as more important than money, the bottom line is that 
money and personal financial health are extra-important factors to 
your retirement lifestyle.
 
Getting caught up in planning the financial part of your future is 
easy. After all, money is measurable and so much revolves around 
the money component of retirement planning. So what can you do 
to successfully plan for retirement? You could simply work really 
hard and spend lots of time making as much money as possible. But 
what would be the point if you have little free time to enjoy yourself 
and others? Fortunately you can implement the following strate-
gies when planning for retirement. We weave discussions on these 
important issues throughout the book.
Saving drives wealth
You may think a high income is key to having a prosperous retire-
ment, but research shows that the best way to retirement bliss 
is to save. Research demonstrates that wealth accumulation is 
driven more by the choice to save (rather than spend) than it is by 
a person’s income.
For example, professors Steven Venti and David Wise examined 
nearly 4,000 households across an array of income levels that chal-
lenges the notion that many households lacking high incomes don’t 
earn enough money to both pay their bills and save at the same time.

21
 Chapter 1: Looking Ahead to Your Future
Venti and Wise examined these households’ current financial 
statuses and histories to explain the differences in their accumu-
lations of assets. Their findings showed that the bulk of the differ-
ences among households, “ . . . must be attributed to differences 
in the amount that households choose to save. The differences in 
saving choices among households with similar lifetime earnings 
lead to vastly different levels of asset accumulation by the time 
retirement age approaches.”
 
It’s not what you make but what you keep (save) that’s important 
to building wealth. Of course, earning more should make it easier 
to save, but most folks allow their spending to increase with their 
incomes.
Keeping your balance
Most people we know have more than one goal when it comes to 
their money and personal situations. For example, suppose Ray, 
age 50, wants to scale back work to a part-time basis and spend 
more time traveling. He reasons, “I don’t want to wait until my 60s 
or 70s, because what if my health isn’t great or I don’t make it!” But, 
Ray also wants to help his adult children with some of the costs of 
graduate school and possibly with buying their first homes.
Ray’s situation — of having multiple goals competing for limited 
dollars — is often the norm. Thus, a theme we discuss throughout 
this book is how to trade off competing goals, which requires per-
sonal considerations and balance in one’s life.
 
Unless you have really deep pockets and modest goals, you need to 
prioritize and value each of your goals.
Understanding that planning 
is a process
The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association has a slogan: “A good 
pilot is always learning.” Likewise, to have a good retirement you 
almost always need to be planning. Financial planning is a process. 

22
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
Too many people develop financial plans and then think they’re 
finished. Taking this route is a good way to run into unpleasant 
surprises in the future.
A plan is based on assumptions and forecasts. However, no plan — 
no matter how carefully it’s developed — gets all the assumptions 
and forecasts correct. Even your best, most careful guesses may 
miss the mark. So, every few years, you need to review your plan.
As you’re reviewing, assess how much reality differed from your 
assumptions. Sometimes, you’ll be pleasantly surprised. Your 
portfolio may earn more than you expected, or you may spend less 
than you estimated. 
Other times the review won’t be as pleasant. The markets may 
have dragged down your portfolio returns. Or your spending may 
have exceeded your estimates. In either case, you aren’t reaching 
your goals.
Even if you do meet the mark in most instances, you still are 
never really done planning and revising. You’re bound to experi-
ence changes in your life, the economy, the markets, tax law, and 
other areas. You may come across new opportunities that weren’t 
available a few years ago or that weren’t right for you then but 
make sense now. You need to continually adapt your plan to these 
changes. You may need to adjust your spending or change your 
investment portfolio.
 
You don’t have to be obsessive. Daily, or even quarterly, changes in 
your portfolio that are different from the plan aren’t a reason to go 
back to the drawing board. But every year or two (or when you have 
a major change in your personal situation) take a fresh look. Review 
the plan and your progress. Figure out what went right and what 
went wrong. Decide whether your goals or situation have changed 
and whether any adjustments are needed. Finally, implement the 
new plan and enjoy life. After all, that’s what the money is for.

Protecting Your Employment 
Income and Your Health
In This Chapter
▶ Evaluating your need for life insurance
▶ Seeing why most working people need disability coverage
▶ Making the most of your health
D
uring your working years, especially your earlier working 
years, your future income earning ability is probably your 
most valuable asset. Consider that the typical person in his 20s 
and 30s has many years (decades, in fact) ahead of him to earn 
money to feed and clothe himself and make other expenditures 
(for example, transportation, taxes, medical bills, and vacations) 
and save for the future. Unless you’re independently wealthy (or 
have a deep-pocketed relative ready to provide long-term care for 
you if you hit hard times), you should carry the proper type and 
amounts of insurance to protect yourself and your family if some-
thing occurs to you that would affect your ability to earn a living. 
In this chapter, our focus is on protecting income you’re earning 
while employed.
Insurance isn’t free, of course. And, like other companies, insur-
ance companies are in business to turn a profit. So you want to 
make sure you obtain proper insurance protection at a good price 
and buy only the coverage you need.
In this chapter, we dive into the details regarding life and disability 
insurance you may need. Here we also discuss your employment 
income and how best to protect it. Finally we also cover the impor-
tance of making the most of your health to minimize the chances 

24
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
of future insurance claims. If your health isn’t good as you enter 
retirement, you’re going to have more issues to face than just 
those dealing with your personal finances. So getting your health 
in order is important.
Assessing Your Need 
for Life Insurance
Needing insurance is kind of like needing a parachute: If you don’t 
have it the first time you need it, chances are you won’t need it 
again. Regarding your need for life insurance, of course, you don’t 
get second chances. (Unless you’re considering near-death expe-
riences; and the life insurer doesn’t pay out for those!) So, if you 
“need” life insurance, you should get it as soon as possible.
The following sections explain what life insurance can do for you. 
They also help you determine whether you need insurance, and if 
you do, how much you need.
Understanding the purpose 
of life insurance
The primary reason to consider buying life insurance is to pro-
vide financially for those who are dependent on your employment 
income. However, just because you have a job, earn employment 
income, and have dependents (children, a spouse, and so on) 
doesn’t mean that you need life insurance.
So how do you know whether you need life insurance coverage? 
Your current financial situation is an important factor in determin-
ing your need. If you haven’t already assessed your retirement plan 
and tallied your assets and liabilities, be sure to read Chapter 3.
 
If you’re still working, aren’t financially independent, and need your 
current and future employment income to keep up your current 
lifestyle — and you’re saving toward your financial goals — life 
insurance probably is a good choice. If you have others depending 

25
 Chapter 2: Protecting Your Employment Income and Your Health
on your employment income, you generally should get term life 
insurance coverage (which we discuss in the later section “Figuring 
out what type to buy”).
On the other hand, you may find that even though you’re still 
working, you’ve achieved financial independence. In other words, 
you’ve accumulated enough assets to be able to actually retire and 
no longer need to earn employment income.
For example, consider one extreme: Microsoft founder Bill Gates 
has dependents and he doesn’t need life insurance to protect his 
current income. That’s because he has billions in investments and 
other assets to provide for his dependents. Of course, the rest of 
us aren’t Bill Gates! But we bring up this enormously successful 
entrepreneur in this discussion to drive home the crucial point 
that if you’ve accumulated significant enough assets compared to 
your annual living expenses, you may not need life insurance.
Determining your life 
insurance need
Each person’s circumstances vary tremendously, so in this section 
we don’t tell you specifically how much life insurance to get. Instead, 
we show you the factors you need to look at in order to determine 
that amount. We’re not fans of general rules like getting ten times 
your annual income in coverage, especially for those approaching 
or already in their senior years. The reason? Each person’s circum-
stances can vary tremendously among many factors such as:
 
✓ Your assets: Generally speaking, the more you have relative 
to your income and obligations, the less life insurance you need.
 
✓ Your debts: Of course, not all debts are created equal. Debts 
on real estate or small businesses tend to have lower interest 
rates, and the interest is tax-deductible. But the more of this 
type of debt you have, the more life insurance you may need. 
On the other hand, consumer debt — such as credit card and 
auto loan debt — tends to be at higher interest rates, and the 
interest isn’t tax-deductible. But again, the more of this debt 
you have, the more life insurance you’re likely to need.

26
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
 
✓ Your health and the health of your family members: If you 
have major medical problems or have a family member who’s 
ill or who has special needs, you may need more coverage.
 
✓ The number of children you need to put through college: A 
four-year college education, especially at private schools, is 
a big expense. So, if you have kids to put through school — 
and they may attend costly schools — you could be talking 
some really big bucks. And you face even bigger bucks if you 
want to help them through graduate or professional school 
after college.
 
✓ Whether you’ll have elderly parents to assist: Of course, this 
factor is difficult to predict, but you should have some sense 
of your parent’s physical and financial health. If you don’t, try 
to broach the topic in a sensitive fashion with them.
 
After completing your retirement planning (see Chapter 3), you 
should have the current financial information you need to begin 
your calculations for how much life insurance you need. Here’s a 
quick and simple way to determine how much life insurance to con-
sider buying:
 
1. Determine your annual after-tax income (from working, not 
investments).
 
 You can find this number on your tax return or W-2 form from 
the past year. (The reason you work with after-tax income is 
because life insurance death benefit payouts aren’t taxed.)
 
2. Determine the amount of money you need in order to 
replace your income for the appropriate number of years.
 
 You can find this amount by simply using the information in 
Table 2-1.
 
3. Consider your overall financial situation and whether you 
need to replace all your income over the time period you 
chose in Step 2.
 
 High income earners who live well beneath their means may 
not want or need to replace all their income. If you’re in this 
category and determine that you don’t need to replace all your 
income, apply an appropriate percentage.

Assessing your current 
life coverage
Before you rush out to buy life insurance, make sure you first 
assess how much coverage you may have through your employer 
and through Social Security. The amount of coverage you have 
could reduce the amount you need to purchase independently. 
Employer-based life insurance coverage is an easier issue to 
deal with compared to Social Security survivor’s benefits, so we 
address it first.
Employer-based life insurance
Some employers offer life insurance coverage. If it’s free, by 
all means factor it into your calculations for how much addi-
tional coverage you may need. (Refer to the preceding section, 
“Determining your life insurance need,” for more on calculating the 
coverage you need.)
For example, if your employer gives you $50,000 in life insurance 
without cost — and in Table 2-1 you calculated you should have 
$300,000 of coverage — simply subtract the $50,000 your employer 
provides to come up with $250,000 of life insurance you need to 
get on your own.

28
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
Keep in mind, however, if you leave the employer, you’ll most likely 
lose the provided insurance coverage. At that time, if your needs 
haven’t changed, you’ll need to replace the employer coverage.
 
If you need to pay out of your own pocket for employer-based life 
insurance, it’s generally not worth paying for. That’s because group 
life plans tend to cost more than the least expensive individual life 
insurance plans.
 
Here’s one important caveat: You must be in good health to get life 
insurance on your own. If you have health problems, group cover-
age may be your best bet.
Social Security survivor’s benefits
Social Security can provide survivor’s benefits to your spouse and 
children. However, if your surviving spouse is working and earning 
even a modest amount of money, she’s going to receive few to no 
survivor’s benefits.
Prior to reaching Social Security’s full retirement age, or FRA, your 
survivor’s benefits get reduced by $1 for every $2 you earn above 
$14,160 (the limit for 2010). This income threshold is higher if you 
reach FRA during the year. For example, for those reaching FRA 
during 2010, their Social Security benefits are reduced by $1 for 
each $3 they earn above $37,680 until the month in which they 
reach FRA. (Check out Chapter 10 for more on FRA and Social 
Security benefits.)
If you or your spouse anticipate earning a low enough income 
to qualify for Social Security survivor’s benefits, you may want 
to factor them into the amount of life insurance you calculate in 
Table 2-1. For example, suppose your annual after-tax income is 
$30,000 and Social Security provides a survivor’s benefit of $12,000 
annually. You calculate the annual amount of life insurance needed 
to replace like this: $30,000 – $12,000 = $18,000.
 
Contact the Social Security Administration (SSA) to request Form 
7004, which gives you an estimate of your Social Security benefits.

 Chapter 2: Protecting Your Employment Income and Your Health
Figuring out what type to buy
When looking to buy life insurance, you basically have two 
choices: term life insurance and cash-value insurance. The follow-
ing sections outline these two and their differences and help you 
determine which may be better for your circumstance.
Term life insurance
Term life insurance is pure life insurance protection. It’s 100 per-
cent life insurance protection with nothing else, and, frankly, in 
our opinion, it’s the way to go for the vast majority of people. 
Agents typically sell term life insurance as temporary coverage.
Remember that the cost of life insurance increases as you get 
older. You can purchase term life insurance so that your premium 
steps up annually or after 5, 10, 15, or 20 years. The less frequently 
your premium adjusts, the higher the initial premium and its incre-
mental increases will be.
The advantage of a premium that locks in for, say, 10 or 20 years is 
that you have the security of knowing how much you’ll be paying 
over that time period. You also don’t need to go through medical 
evaluations as frequently to qualify for the lowest rate possible. 
Policies that adjust the premium every five to ten years offer a 
happy medium between price and predictability.
 
The disadvantage of a term life insurance policy with a long-term 
rate lock is that you pay more in the early years than you do on a 
policy that adjusts more frequently. Also, your life insurance needs 
are likely to change over time. So, you may throw money away 
when you dump a policy with a long-term premium guarantee 
before its rate is set to change.
 
Be sure that you get a policy that’s guaranteed renewable. This 
feature assures that the policy can’t be canceled because of poor 
health. Unless you expect that your life insurance needs will disap-
pear when the policy is up for renewal, be sure to buy a life insur-
ance policy with the guaranteed renewable feature.

30
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
Cash-value coverage
Cash-value coverage, also referred to as whole life insurance, com-
bines life insurance protection with an investment account. For a 
given level of coverage, cash-value coverage costs substantially 
more than term coverage and some of this extra money goes into 
a low-interest investment account for you. This coverage appeals 
to people who don’t like to feel that they’re wasting money on an 
insurance policy they hope to never use.
Agents usually sell cash-value life insurance as permanent protec-
tion. The reality is that people who buy term insurance generally 
hold it as long as they have people financially dependent on them 
(which usually isn’t a permanent situation). People who buy cash-
value insurance are more likely to hold onto their coverage until 
they die.
 
Insurance agents often pitch cash-value life insurance over term life 
insurance. Cash-value life insurance costs much more and provides 
fatter profits for insurance companies and commissions to the 
agents who sell it. So don’t be swayed to purchase this type unless 
you really need it.
Cash-value life insurance can serve a purpose if you have a sub-
stantial net worth that would cause you to be subject to estate 
taxes. Under current tax law (which could, of course, change), you 
can leave up to $3.5 million — free of federal estate taxes — to 
your heirs. Buying a cash-value policy and placing it in an irrevo-
cable life insurance trust allows the policy’s death benefits to pass 
to your heirs free of federal estate taxes.
Choosing where to buy 
life insurance
If you’re going to purchase life insurance, you need to know where 
to go. You can look at the following two places:

31
 Chapter 2: Protecting Your Employment Income and Your Health
 
✓ Your local insurance agent’s office: Many local insurance 
agents sell life insurance, and you certainly can obtain quotes 
and a policy through them. As with any major purchase, it’s 
a good idea to shop around. Don’t get quotes from just one 
agent. Contact at least three. It costs you nothing to ask for a 
quote, and you’ll probably be surprised at the differences in 
premiums.
 
 As we discuss earlier in this chapter, many agents prefer to 
sell cash-value policies because of the fatter commissions on 
those policies. So don’t be persuaded to purchase that type of 
policy if you don’t really think it’s right for you.
 
✓ An insurance agency quote service: The best of these ser-
vices provide proposals from the highest-rated, lowest-cost 
companies available. Like other agencies, the services receive 
a commission if you buy a policy from them, but you’re under 
no obligation to do so.
 
 To get a quote, these services ask you your date of birth, 
whether you smoke, some basic health questions, and how 
much coverage you want. Services that are worth considering 
include

Shielding Your Employment 
Income: Disability Insurance
Long-term disability (LTD) insurance replaces a portion of your 
lost income in the event that a disability prevents you from work-
ing either permanently or temporarily for an extended period of 
time. For example, you may be in an accident or develop a medical 
condition that keeps you from working for six months or longer. 

32
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
During your working years, your future income earning ability is 
likely your most valuable asset — far more valuable than a car or 
even your home. Your ability to produce income should be pro-
tected or insured.
 
Even if you don’t have dependents, you probably still need disabil-
ity coverage. After all, aren’t you dependent on your income?
The following sections point out why you need to have disability 
insurance and help you determine the type of coverage you need 
to protect your income.
Why most people lack disability 
insurance and why you need it
Most folks lack long-term disability insurance. The two main rea-
sons people don’t obtain this important type of insurance are as 
follows:
 
✓ Their company doesn’t offer it. Just three in ten workers are 
offered access to an LTD plan. Only 19 percent of those work-
ing for smaller employers — those employers with fewer than 
100 employees — have access to an LTD plan. And just 6 per-
cent of part-time workers have access to LTD insurance.
 
✓ They don’t enroll. Even among those in the minority who 
have access to LTD, many people don’t enroll. A common 
reason folks bypass coverage is that they believe their 
chances of disability are rare. Another perception is that 
only old people become disabled. Both of these perceptions 
are wrong.
 
So why should you spend money and buy LTD? The answers are 
simple. If you want to protect your future employment income, an 
LTD plan is one of the best ways to do so. Here are some reasons 
you should get LTD:

 Chapter 2: Protecting Your Employment Income and Your Health
 
✓ Life is uncertain. You can’t know when and what type of dis-
ability you may suffer. That’s because many disabilities are 
caused by medical problems (arthritis, cerebral palsy, diabetes, 
glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, stroke, and 
so on) and accidents (head injuries, spinal injury, loss of limb, 
and so on). Although older folks are at greater risk for more 
severe medical problems, plenty of people in their 20s, 30s, and 
40s suffer major medical problems leading to disability.
 
✓ Most applicants for Social Security disability benefits cover-
age are turned down. You can receive payments only if your 
disability will result in death or if you aren’t able to perform 
any substantial, gainful activity for more than a year.
 
✓ Even if you do qualify, your state’s disability plan and Social 
Security insurance programs won’t provide you with suf-
ficient coverage. Many people are mistaken in thinking that 
their state’s disability plan and the Social Security disability 
insurance program will take care of them if they become dis-
abled. Unfortunately, those programs don’t provide adequate 
coverage. State programs typically only pay benefits for one 
year or less, which isn’t going to cut it if you truly suffer a 
long-term disability that lasts for years. While one year of cov-
erage is better than none, the premiums for such short-term 
coverage often are higher per dollar of benefit than through 
the best private insurer programs.
 
 Similarly, although Social Security disability benefits can 
be paid long term, remember that these payments are only 
intended to provide for basic subsistence living expenses. 
Those earning more than $20,000 per year find that less than 
half of their income is replaced by Social Security disability 
payments. As Table 2-2 shows, the higher your income, the 
smaller the portion of your income will be replaced by Social 
Security disability.
 
✓ Worker’s compensation, if you have coverage through your 
employer, won’t pay benefits at all if you get injured or 
become sick away from your job. Such narrow coverage that 
only pays benefits under a limited set of circumstances isn’t 
the comprehensive insurance you need.

Identifying needed 
disability coverage
Unless you’re already financially independent, you need long-term 
disability insurance during your working years. Generally speak-
ing, you should have LTD coverage that provides a benefit of 
approximately 60 percent of your gross income. Because disability 
benefits payments are tax-free if you pay the premium, they should 
replace your current after-tax earnings.
 
If you earn a high income and spend far less than that, you may be 
fine purchasing a monthly benefit amount less than 60 percent of 
your income.
 
We recommend that your disability policy contain the following:
 
✓ An “own occupation” definition of disability: This definition 
allows you to collect benefits if you can’t perform your regular 
occupation. For example, if you work as an accountant, your 
disability policy shouldn’t require you to take a job as a brick 
layer or retail worker if you no longer can perform the duties 
of an accountant.

35
 Chapter 2: Protecting Your Employment Income and Your Health
 
✓ A noncancelable and guaranteed renewable clause: This 
clause guarantees that your policy can’t be canceled if you 
develop health problems. If you purchase a policy that 
requires periodic physical exams, you could lose your cover-
age when you’re most likely to need it.
 
✓ A financially appropriate benefit period: Obtain a policy 
that pays benefits until an age at which you would become 
financially self-sufficient. For most people, that would require 
obtaining a policy that pays benefits to age 65 or 67 (when 
Social Security retirement benefits begin).
 
 If you’re close to being financially independent and expect 
to accomplish that or retire before your mid-60s, consider a 
policy that pays benefits for five years.
 
✓ A high deductible/waiting period: The waiting period is the 
“deductible” on disability insurance. It’s the time between 
your disability and when you can begin collecting benefits. We 
recommend that you take the longest waiting period that your 
financial circumstances allow, because doing so will greatly 
reduce your policy’s premiums. We generally recommend a 
waiting period of at least 90 or 180 days.
 
✓ Residual benefits: This feature pays you a partial benefit if 
you have a disability that prevents you from working full time.
 
✓ Cost-of-living adjustments: This provision automatically 
increases your benefit payment after you’re disabled by a set 
percentage or in step with inflation.
Shopping for disability coverage
After you understand the importance of having good disability 
insurance, hopefully you’ll be motivated to close the deal and buy 
it. Here are some ways to shop and compare so you end up with 
good coverage at a competitive price:
 
✓ Check with your employer. Group disability plans can greatly 
accelerate your shopping process and generally offer decent 
value. Unlike with life insurance plans, group disability plans 
tend to offer more bang for your buck.

36
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
 
✓ Peruse professional associations. For many self-employed 
people, if you find the associations that exist for your occupa-
tion or profession, you may well discover a fine disability plan. 
Just be sure to compare their offerings to whatever individual 
policy proposals you find.
 
✓ Avail yourself of agents. Get referrals to insurance agents 
in your area who specialize in disability insurance. Using the 
policy guidelines in the preceding section, “Identifying needed 
disability coverage,” solicit and evaluate proposals.
Finding a career you love
Most folks spend decades working. And 
getting caught up in the financial end 
of your career is easy and tempting. Of 
course, all other things being equal, 
you should earn more rather than less 
money! However, you should manage 
your career with an eye toward protect-
ing and enhancing your earnings and 
your happiness.
We know folks who have been doing the 
same type of work for decades and love 
what they do. But they are the exception, 
not the norm.
A survey conducted by the Society for 
Human Resource Management found 
that when employees are younger (35 
and under), their primary concerns 
are compensation and benefits. Older 
workers (over the age of 55) are more 
concerned with issues like job security, 
feeling safe at work, having the opportu-
nity to use their skills and abilities, enjoy-
ing the work itself, and communication 
between employees and management. 
So the financial aspects of work become 
less important for most workers as they 
get older.
Remember, you only live once. Take 
advantage of the opportunity to dream 
about alternative careers. Go back to 
school, take some continuing education 
classes, or go to an interesting seminar. 
For example, an insurance agent dis-
satisfied with the sales aspect of his job 
may move into public school teaching 
and then become a school administrator.

small business, check out these books:

The insurance company you choose should have strong financial 
health with the leading credit rating agencies, such as A.M. Best, 
Fitch, Moody’s, Standard & Poors, and Weiss Research.
Investing In and Protecting 
Your Health
Your health is probably one of the most important components 
of a quality life. So, as you enter your senior years, if you’re not 
healthy, squaring away your personal finances can be much more 
difficult. After all, if you’re facing serious health issues and costly 
doctor and hospital bills, your finances probably won’t be as 
healthy either.
 
In order to make wise choices about your health — so you’re in 
good shape to deal with your finances during your senior years — 
you need to make sure you’re informed. The good news is that 
knowledge and information about healthy living is readily available 
so you can make smart, health-conscious choices.
The following sections give you an overview and pointers about 
what you can do to ensure that your health is in order now and 
in the years ahead. With your good health in check, you can then 
enjoy retirement and be in a better financial situation. In these 
sections, we rely on Dr. Mehmet Oz and Dr. Michael Roizen for 
some help. They’ve coauthored numerous personal health books 
that we have found informative and helpful when consulting with 
seniors.
Take care of your ticker
One of the most important aspects of healthy living is ensuring that 
your heart is in tiptop shape. You can start by choosing to eat the 
following foods, which have heart-healthy and anti-inflammatory 
properties:

38
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
 
✓ Alcohol: You must be careful with the amount (and type) of 
alcohol you drink. Women can drink one drink per day while 
men can partake of two. The benefits of alcohol? It raises 
levels of healthy HDL cholesterol and also helps you to wind 
down so your blood pressure can do the same. (Just be sure 
not to drink too close to bedtime, because alcohol can disrupt 
sleep in some folks.) The best alcohol to choose is red wine 
with its abundant antioxidants.
 
✓ Dark chocolate: Eating dark (not milk) chocolate may lower 
blood pressure, increase good HDL cholesterol, and lower 
nasty LDL cholesterol. Interesting fact: The Kuna Indians (who 
live near Panama) drink more than five cups of flavonoid-rich 
cocoa a day. They have little age-related hypertension.
 
✓ Extra-virgin olive oil: Extra-virgin olive oil contains healthy 
phytonutrients and monounsaturated fats, which boost good 
HDL cholesterol. The docs recommend that about 25 percent 
of your diet come from healthy fats (for example, olive oil, 
avocados, and nuts).
 
✓ Fish: Fatty fish, such as mahi-mahi, catfish, flounder, tilapia, 
whitefish, and wild, line-caught salmon, are rich in omega-3 
fatty acids that reduce triglycerides in your blood. High 
triglycerides can cause plaque buildup in your arteries. 
Omega-3s also help reduce the risk of arrhythmia (irregular 
heartbeat) after a heart attack, decrease blood pressure, and 
make platelets less sticky, which reduces clotting. The docs 
recommend three portions of fatty fish per week.
 
✓ Fruits and veggies: Many fruits and vegetables — for example, 
red grapes, cranberries, tomatoes, and onions — contain pow-
erful antioxidants called flavonoids and carotenoids.
 
✓ Garlic: A clove a day is believed to be beneficial to help thin 
your blood and lower blood pressure. You can take 400 milli-
grams in pill form (called allicin) if you don’t care for the taste 
of garlic or its affects on your breath.
 
✓ Magnesium-rich foods: Whole-grain breads and cereals, soy-
beans, lima beans, avocado, beets, and raisins help lower 
blood pressure and reduce arrhythmias by expanding the 
arteries. Strive to get 400 milligrams of magnesium each day 
from your food.

39
 Chapter 2: Protecting Your Employment Income and Your Health
Exercise (and sweat)!
Exercise makes you feel (and look) better. To keep your heart 
healthy, try to walk about 30 minutes daily and get at least one 
hour of sweaty activity, such as an aerobics class (ideally you’d 
break that hour into three 20-minute sessions).You should get 
your heart pumping up to about 80 percent of its age-adjusted 
maximum (220 minus your age) for extended periods of time, 
according to the docs.
 
If you like to jog, keep the following pointer in mind: Besides having 
to dodge SUV-driving lunatics yammering on cell phones, running 
on hard asphalt isn’t good for your body. The older you get, the 
more careful you should be about the stresses and strains you’re 
placing on your joints. You should go for low-impact activities, such 
as swimming, cycling, or using an elliptical trainer to elevate your 
heart rate without stressing your joints.
Exercise also has other benefits. As you age, your sense of (and 
ability to) balance slowly declines. Falls are one of the leading 
causes of injury and death among the elderly. More than one in 
three adults age 65 and older fall each year in the United States. 
Among older adults, falls are the leading cause of injury deaths. 
They’re also the most common cause of nonfatal injuries and 
traumatic hospital admissions.
Naturally, many people who fall develop a fear of falling. This fear 
may cause them to limit their activities, leading to reduced mobil-
ity and physical fitness and increased risk of falling.
To improve your balance and develop some strength, try the 
following activities:
 
✓ Crunches: Performing crunches on an unstable surface, such 
as on a stability ball, forces your body to balance.
 
✓ Light weight lifting: Use dumbbells instead of weight 
machines, because dumbbells force you to balance the 
weights better.

40
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
 
✓ Standing exercises on one leg at a time: Doing these exer-
cises helps you develop better balance.
 
✓ Step-type moves: Activities such as lunges or step-up moves 
require you to balance your weight.
Hydrate with good-quality H2O
You want to drink plenty of water to realize a variety of health 
benefits, especially for your digestion and intestines. Drinking 
water, preferably filtered, lubricates everything, allowing food to 
more easily slide through your system. It also quells hunger and 
fights bad breath. Furthermore, you need to regularly drink water 
as you age because your body’s ability to detect thirst weakens 
as you get older.
 
The more active and larger you are, the more water you’ll need to 
drink. The best indicator for whether you’re drinking enough water 
is the color of your urine; drink enough water that your urine is 
light yellow. (Note: If you take vitamins, they may turn your urine 
bright yellow even if you are drinking enough water.)
Eric’s Web site (www.erictyson.com) has a summary of research 
on bottled water quality and demonstrates how most bottled 
waters are a waste of money. Your most effective and healthy 
avenue is to install a water filtration system at home to improve 
the virtually free tap water you’re already receiving.
Include fiber in your diet
If you’re eating healthy foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, 
oats, and beans, you’ll also be eating valuable fiber. (Some cereals 
have a decent amount of fiber as well.) The combination of fiber 
and water helps move food easily through your system without 
putting too much pressure on your intestines. Doctors recommend 
that men get 35 grams a day and women 25 grams.

41
 Chapter 2: Protecting Your Employment Income and Your Health
 
The other often-overlooked benefit of eating fiber-rich foods and 
being well hydrated is that the combination makes you feel full. 
Eating too much in general and eating too much of the wrong foods 
lead to obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and a variety of related 
problems.
Manage your stress
Stress does horrible things to your body. You can’t eliminate all 
stress, of course (and, besides, doing so would make life dull). 
However, you can do plenty to minimize it and turn it to your 
advantage. You can make the following health-conscious choices 
to keep stress under control:
 
✓ Identify the sources of your stress. You can’t manage stress if 
you’re not clear on the real sources.
 
✓ Focus on the moment. Spend time every day thinking about 
the here and now and not brooding over yesterday or worrying 
about tomorrow. Also, notice the things that most people tend 
to ignore — like breathing, bodily sensations, and emotions.
 
✓ Take good care of your health. Make sure you have the other 
aspects of your life in order, such as getting enough sleep, 
eating well, and exercising. When you don’t, you’re more vul-
nerable to the stress.
 
✓ Get moving. Exercise is one of the best stress (and depres-
sion) busters ever invented. See the earlier section “Exercise 
(and sweat)!” for more information.
 
✓ Do the opposite. Whenever people feel negative emotions, 
such as fear or anxiety, they tend to avoid them and withdraw. 
If you try experiencing the opposite emotions, you can start to 
feel better. So, for example, if you’re upset with someone, try 
to be empathetic instead of lashing out.
 
✓ Focus on and relax your muscles. Tense and then relax the 
muscles in one part of your body (such as your legs, your 
arms, your face, and so on) at a time. Doing so reduces stress 
that you’re storing in your body.

42
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
 
✓ Take some deep breaths. Take ten deep breaths in the morn-
ing and another ten at night — and as many as needed in 
between for stress relief. Find a position that helps you relax. 
For example, lie on the floor, flat on your back, with one hand 
on your chest, and another on your stomach. Breathe in 
deeply and slowly, picturing your lungs filling with air. When 
your lungs feel full, slowly breathe out.
Get your calcium
Most people don’t get enough calcium for optimal bone density. 
Most folks need about 1,500 milligrams daily from foods or supple-
ments. So to reach your optimal health, make sure you’re taking 
in calcium. Foods plentiful in calcium include whole grains, leafy 
green vegetables, and nuts. It’s also often helpful to get some cal-
cium from chewable calcium-citrate tablets.
 
Along with your calcium, take 1,000 international units (1,200 for 
women over age 65) of vitamin D daily. Doing so helps your body 
absorb the calcium you take in. In addition, if you aren’t getting it in 
your diet, you want to add 400 milligrams of magnesium daily to 
prevent the constipation that calcium can cause. We provide a list 
of foods that are particularly high in magnesium in the earlier sec-
tion “Take care of your ticker.”

M
any folks dream about retiring. No more racing to catch 
the commuter train or beat the worst of rush hour traffic. 
Say goodbye to long, endless meetings about topics for which you 
have little or no interest. Instead you’ll have plenty of free time to 
do the things you can rarely find the time and energy to do while 
you’re working. It sure sounds appealing, doesn’t it?
Although many folks dream about retiring, few are preparing. 
A recent survey conducted by the Employee Benefit Research 
Institute regarding Americans’ planning for retirement found that:
 
✓ Only about 65 percent of working adults surveyed are actually 
saving for retirement.
 
✓ Of those who are saving, 65 percent have a nest egg of less 
than $50,000.
 
✓ About half of survey participants simply guess at the amount 
of their retirement needs.
We think your future plans are important enough to deserve more 
than a guess! But, we understand that your free time is valuable to 
you and that you have more interesting things to do than number

crunching to determine your retirement needs. So, in this chapter, 
we promise to provide plenty of retirement planning insights and 
tips without spending gobs of your time. Before we dig into the 
financial part of planning retirement, though, we discuss some gen-
eral retirement topics that are as important or even more impor-
tant. You need to have a firm grasp of these items as well.
Deciding When to Retire
Retiring sounds so appealing when you’ve had a frustrating stretch 
at a job you’re not particularly enjoying. But, some folks really 
enjoying working and aren’t eager to have wide-open daily sched-
ules day after day, week after week. Deciding when to retire and 
what to do in retirement is an intensely personal decision. For 
sure, there are many financial and personal considerations and 
questions, and we thoroughly address them in this chapter.
Even when you’re healthy, the job market may not be. Your 
employer could suffer financial hardship and reduce its workforce. 
Or maybe you’ll be lucky enough to retire early (even though it’s 
unplanned) because your employer offers you a buy-out package 
that’s too good to turn down. Or worse, you may lose your job 
with little notice and few benefits.
Ideally, when caught in one of these situations you would obtain 
another job and continue it until your planned retirement age. 
Unfortunately, events may not unfold that way. The economy, the 
job market, and your age could work against you. Finding another 
job, at a compensation level you’re willing to work for, may not be 
possible.
Even when you leave a full-time career voluntarily, you may plan to 
work part time for a few years. Or you may assume that if the first 
years of retirement are more expensive than planned, you could 
return to work at least part time. Yet, a part-time job you assumed 
would be easy to find may not be available at all or may be avail-
able at a much lower level of pay than you expected.

45
 Chapter 3: Developing a Retirement Plan
Knowing How Much You Really 
Need for Retirement
Most people have a long-term financial goal of retiring someday. 
For some, doing so means leaving work entirely. To others, simply 
cutting back on work or doing something completely different on a 
part-time basis is most appealing. 
What focus groups say about 
planning for retirement
The Society of Actuaries conducted 
some interesting focus groups with folks 
early in their retirement years. They 
honed in on people who had invest-
ment portfolios of at least $100,000 and 
who needed that money along with their 
Social Security and pension benefits to 
meet their retirement expenses.
Most of these people didn’t consult 
advisors and plan all that much for their 
retirement. Instead, they were more con-
cerned with quitting work by a particular 
age. A number of focus group partici-
pants commented that their retirement 
decision came down to a “feeling” that 
they could swing it. Consider these com-
ments from three different retirees:
 ✓ “I thought you were supposed to 
retire when you are about 65, and 
thought I would try it.”
 ✓ “I never sat down and thought I am 
59, and in 30 years I’ll be 89. Have I 
allocated enough for 30 years? I never 
did that. Theoretically I should have.”
 ✓ “We take it day by day. I can’t worry 
about what is going to happen 
tomorrow.”
The focus groups also found that retirees 
were spending more than they expected 
on entertainment and travel, prescription 
drugs, and gas. It also wasn’t unusual for 
retirees to overlook inflation. And finally, 
although retirees were concerned about 
the potential for high medical and long-
term care expenses, they did little plan-
ning around those expected expenses.
The lesson to be learned from all this is 
that you must have realistic expectations 
and proper assumptions when planning 
for your retirement. For more about man-
aging your expenses in retirement, see 
Chapter 6.

46
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
If you don’t plan to work well into your golden years, you need a 
reasonable chunk of money in order to maintain a particular life-
style in the absence of your normal employment income. (If you do 
plan on working some during retirement, check out Chapter 18 for 
some helpful hints.) The following sections help you get started on 
determining how much money you need and coming to grips with 
those numbers.
Figuring out what portion 
of income you need
If you’re like most people, you need less money to live on in retire-
ment than during your working years. That’s because in retirement 
most people don’t need to save any of their income and many of 
their work-related expenses (commuting, work clothes, and such) 
go away or greatly decrease. With less income, most retirees find 
they pay less in taxes too.
 
On the flip side, some categories of expenses may go up in retire-
ment. With more free time on your hands, you may spend more on 
entertainment, meals out, and travel. The costs for prescription 
drugs and other medical expenses also can begin to add up.
So what portion of your income do you really need as you make 
your retirement plan? The answer isn’t simple. Everyone’s situa-
tion is unique, so examine your current expenditures and consider 
how they may change in the years ahead. Check out Chapter 6 for 
more information on budgeting and managing your expenses in 
retirement.
To help figure out how much money you need, keep the following 
statistics in mind. Studies have shown that retirees typically spend 
65 to 80 percent of their pre-retirement income during their retire-
ment years. Folks at the lower end of this range typically
 
✓ Save a large portion of their annual earnings during their work-
ing years
 
✓ Don’t have a mortgage or any other debt in retirement

47
 Chapter 3: Developing a Retirement Plan
 
✓ Are higher-income earners who don’t anticipate leading a 
lifestyle in retirement that’s reflective of their current high-
income lifestyle
Those who spend at the higher end of the range tend to have the 
following characteristics:
 
✓ Save little or none of their annual earnings before retirement
 
✓ Still have a significant mortgage or growing rent to pay in 
retirement
 
✓ Need nearly all current income to meet their current lifestyle
 
✓ Have expensive hobbies that they have more time to pursue
 
We can’t offer a definitive answer as to how much you need to have 
for your retirement. Just make sure you carefully look at all your 
expenses and figure out how they may change (see Chapter 6).
Grasping what the numbers mean
When determining how much money you need for your retirement 
plans, you want to think in terms of your goals and how much you 
need to save per month to reach your desired goal given your cur-
rent situation.
In Eric’s previous work as a personal financial planner and 
lecturer, he came across many folks who had done some basic 
number crunching or had consulted a financial advisor. Far too 
often, these folks got a number — a big, bad number like $3.8 
million — stuck in their heads. That number was the size of the 
nest egg they needed to achieve a particular standard of living 
throughout their retirement.
 
Rather than obsessing about a large number, you need to examine 
your own standard of living that can be provided by the assets 
you’ve accumulated or will likely accumulate by a preferred retire-
ment age. You can then begin to put the numbers into perspective 
for your own individual case. We get to that task in the later sec-
tion, “Crunching the Numbers.”

48
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
Eyeing the Components of 
Your Retirement Plan
In order to meet your retirement needs, you need a firm grasp of 
what resources are available to help you. In addition to govern-
ment benefits such as Social Security, company-provided pensions 
and personal investments round out most people’s retirement 
income sources. This section takes a closer look at these elements.
Social Security retirement benefits
Social Security is intended to provide a subsistence level of 
income in retirement for basic living necessities such as food, 
shelter, and clothing. However, Social Security wasn’t designed to 
be a retiree’s sole source of income. When planning for retirement, 
you’ll likely need to supplement your expected Social Security 
benefits with personal savings, investments, and company pension 
benefits. If you’re a high-income earner, you particularly need to 
supplement your income — unless, of course, you’re willing to live 
well beneath your pre-retirement income. (Refer to Chapter 10 for 
more discussion on Social Security.)
 
If you’re still working, you can estimate your Social Security retire-
ment benefits by looking at your most recent Social Security bene-
fits statement, which the federal government sends each year to 
adults age 25 and older. Statements usually are mailed a couple of 
months before your birthday. If you can’t locate your most recent 
statement, you can get one fairly quickly either by requesting it 
online at www.ssa.gov (click on the Your Social Security Earnings 
Statement tab on the home page) or by calling 800-772-1213 and 
requesting form SSA-7004 (“Request for Social Security Statement”).
 
Like many people, you may be concerned about your Social 
Security. You may be afraid that it won’t be there when you retire. 
Although you may have to wait until you’re slightly older to collect 
benefits or endure more of your benefits being taxed, rest assured. 

49
 Chapter 3: Developing a Retirement Plan
Congress has been reluctant over the years to make major negative 
changes to Social Security, because doing so would risk upsetting a 
large and highly active voting bloc of retirees.
With your Social Security benefits statement in hand, you can see 
how much Social Security you’ve already earned and review how 
the Social Security Administration (SSA) determines these num-
bers. With this information in hand, you can better plan for your 
retirement and make important retirement planning decisions.
Looking at your estimated benefits statement
Your Social Security benefits statement can give you important 
information about your estimated retirement benefits. On Page 2 
of this annual statement, you see information like the following 
(unless you don’t have enough work credits, which are awarded for 
every year you earn money):
You have earned enough credits to qualify for benefits. At your 
current earnings rate, if you continue working until:
Your full retirement age (67 years), your payment would be about 
$1,543 a month
Age 70, your payment would be about $1,924 a month
If you stop working and start receiving benefits at age 62, your 
payment would be about $1,064 a month
These statements are pretty self explanatory. (We explain in 
Chapter 10 how the credit-earning part of Social Security works.)
Assumptions: Discovering how 
your benefits are estimated
Along with your benefits estimates, the SSA also discloses the 
assumptions used to come up with your numbers and some impor-
tant caveats. You should understand the assumptions behind the 
estimates we talk about in the preceding section. Why? These are 
projections, and depending on your earnings in the years ahead, 
your expected benefits may change. Here’s what the SSA says:

50
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
Generally, the older you are and the closer you are to retirement, 
the more accurate the retirement estimates will be because they 
are based on a longer work history with fewer uncertainties such 
as earnings fluctuations and future law changes.
 
If you stop and consider this assumption, it does make sense and is 
true of about any forecast or estimate. The further into the future 
you try to project something, the more likely it is that the estimates 
may be off base.
To understand what could throw off future estimates, keep 
the following in mind as you dig a little deeper into the SSA’s 
assumptions:
If you have enough work credits, we estimated your benefit 
amounts using your average earnings over your working lifetime. 
For 2010 and later (up to retirement age), we assumed you’ll 
continue to work and make about the same as you did in 2008 or 
2009. We can’t provide your actual benefit amount until you apply 
for benefits. And that amount may differ from the estimates stated 
above because:
(1) Your earnings may increase or decrease in the future.
(2) After you start receiving benefits, they will be adjusted for 
cost-of-living increases.
(3) Your estimated benefits are based on current law. The law 
governing benefit amounts may change.
In other words, the SSA assumes that your future earnings will 
annually be about the same as your earnings in the most recent 
couple of years. Therefore, as their own cautions highlight, if you 
expect your future work earnings to change from your most recent 
years’ employment earnings, your expected Social Security retire-
ment benefits also will change.
Don’t get hung up over expected cost-of-living increases. When we 
walk you through the retirement number crunching later in this 
chapter, these increases are incorporated into the analysis. The 
third point about future benefit law changes is worth considering, 
so we cover that in detail in Chapter 10.

Pensions
When putting together your retirement plan, you also want to con-
sider any pensions you have available to you. You may have pre-
viously worked for an employer offering pension benefits or you 
may currently work for a company with such a plan. Also known 
as a defined benefit plan, a company pension plan is one that your 
employer actually is contributing to and investing money in to 
fund your future pension payments.
In a typical plan, the employer may be putting away about 8 to 
10 percent of your salary (this money is actually in addition to 
your salary, because the money isn’t taken from your income as it 
would be if you were contributing to a retirement plan such as a 
401(k) plan). The money is then invested mostly in a mix of stocks 
and bonds (as it is in a balanced mutual fund).
 
Two terrific attributes of pension plans are
 
✓ The savings happen automatically. Unlike a retirement sav-
ings plan like a 401(k), you don’t have to think about your 
pension plan. You don’t have to cut back on your spending or 
complete any forms. Your employer is putting away money on 
your behalf month in and month out.
 
✓ You don’t experience any investment hassles or challenges. 
The pension fund manager does all the heavy lifting with 
regard to investing the money. So there’s no need for you to 
research or monitor financial markets or investments.
 
If your current or previous employers have a pension plan and you 
may have accumulated benefits, request a copy of each plan’s ben-
efit description and a recent statement of your earned benefits. 
(When we get to crunching the numbers for your retirement plan, 
you need your pension benefit statements.)

52
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
Based on your years of service, your benefits statement will show 
you how much of a benefit you’ve earned. Your current employer’s 
statement or the person or department that works with benefits 
may also be able to show you how your pension benefits will 
increase based on working until a certain future age.
Investments
The many types of investments you may have are an important 
component of your retirement plan. These investments may come 
in various forms, such as bank accounts, brokerage accounts, 
mutual fund accounts, and so on. Your investments may or may 
not be in retirement accounts. Even if they aren’t, they still can be 
earmarked to help with your retirement.
 
Take an inventory of your savings and investments by gathering 
recent copies of your statements from the following types of 
accounts or investment options:
 
✓ Bank accounts — checking (especially if it holds excess 
savings), savings, CDs, and so on
 
✓ IRA accounts
 
✓ Taxable accounts at brokers and mutual funds
 
✓ Employer retirement accounts, including
 
• Profit-sharing plans
 
• Employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs)
 
• 401(k)s, 403(b)s, and so forth
 
✓ Investment real estate
We provide numerous bits of information elsewhere in this book 
about how to invest your retirement money as well as where to 
save it. At this point, you simply need to take an inventory of your 
current assets and use that information in the “Crunching the 
Numbers” section to determine where you stand regarding retire-
ment planning.

 Chapter 3: Developing a Retirement Plan
Your home’s equity
If you’ve owned a home over the years, and it has a decent amount 
of equity in it (the difference between its market value and the 
mortgage debt owed on it), you can tap into that equity to provide 
for your retirement. In order to tap into your home’s equity, you 
have two primary options:
In good hands: Knowing your 
pension is protected
Many people don’t realize how safe their 
pension benefits actually are. Even if the 
company goes under, pension assets are 
held separately and are backed up by the 
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation 
(PBGC). The PBGC is a federal agency 
created by the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act of 1974 (also known 
as ERISA) to protect pension benefits in 
private-sector pension plans, also known 
as defined benefit plans. PBGC guaran-
tees basic pension benefits earned, sub-
ject to limits, including
 ✓ Pension benefits at normal retirement 
age
 ✓ Most early retirement benefits
 ✓ Disability benefits
 ✓ Annuity benefits for survivors of plan 
participants
PBGC doesn’t guarantee health and wel-
fare benefits, vacation pay, or severance 
pay. The maximum benefit amount that 
PBGC guarantees is quite substantial. 
According to the PBGC:
  PBGC’s maximum benefit guarantee 
is set each year under provisions of 
ERISA . . . For 2009, the maximum guar-
anteed amount is $4,500.00 per month 
($54,000.00 per year) for workers who 
begin receiving payments from PBGC 
at age 65. The maximum guarantee 
is lower if you begin receiving pay-
ments from PBGC before age 65 or 
if your pension includes benefits for 
a survivor or other beneficiary. The 
maximum guarantee is higher if you 
are over age 65 when you begin 
receiving benefits from PBGC.

Part I: Working toward Retirement 
 
✓ You can sell your home. After you sell your home, you can 
either buy a less costly one or rent.
 
✓ You can take out a reverse mortgage. With a reverse mort-
gage, you draw income against your home which is accu-
mulated as a debt balance to be paid once the home is sold 
(check out Chapter 8 for more info).
If you’re pretty certain you’d like to tap your home’s equity to help 
with retirement, consider how much equity you would use.
When Setting Up Your Plan
When beginning your retirement planning, make sure you sit 
down with your spouse and coordinate each person’s plan 
together. Doing so may seem obvious, but it’s an important step. 
Discussions about retirement plans need to begin long before 
retirement. Even when one spouse is doing most of the financial 
planning for retirement, both spouses need to have a meeting of 
the minds over the nonfinancial aspects of their senior years. And 
the spouse who is not doing as much of the financial planning still 
needs to know the overall financial situation.
There are some topics couples should begin discussing at least 
five years before retirement.
 
✓ Should each of you retire? If so, when would each prefer to 
begin retirement? 
 
✓ Would retirement be complete, or is part-time work a possibil-
ity for either spouse?
 
✓ Where will you live during retirement?
 
✓ How will each of you spend nonworking time during retire-
ment? What things will you do together and which will you do 
separately? 
 
✓ Have you estimated how much money you will need to sup-
port your retirement plans? If so, how much will you need and 
how close are you to having it?
 
✓ What is the plan for spending your retirement funds, and what 
is the plan for investing the funds?

55
 Chapter 3: Developing a Retirement Plan
 
✓ What assets and accounts do you own, where are they, and 
how are they invested?
 
✓ What legacy do you hope to leave? Is there a plan for fulfilling 
that goal?
 
✓ What is your estate plan and where are the documents?
 
✓ What role will children and parents play in the rest of your 
lives? Will you move to live near either adult children or aging 
parents? Do you plan to help or support either of them if 
needed? If this is a second marriage for either spouse, what 
are the plans for any children of the prior marriage?
 
✓ What is the attitude of each of you to aging, and how do you 
expect to react to it?
Crunching the Numbers
For purposes of retirement planning, what matters most is where 
you stand today as far as reaching your goal. So you need to 
crunch some numbers to get a handle on your situation. One of 
the best ways to do so is to use available retirement calculators, 
either online or with a hard copy workbook. These resources can 
walk you through the calculations needed to figure how much you 
should be saving to reach your retirement goal. The information 
you collect and the questions you answer earlier in this chapter 
allow you to hit the ground running with the number crunching.
Among the mass market Web site tools and booklets, we like the 
ones from T. Rowe Price. Visit www.troweprice.com for the 
online version, or call 800-638-5660 for the work booklets.
 
The T. Rowe Price Web-based Retirement Income Calculator is a 
user-friendly tool, and the Web site says it takes about 10 minutes 
to complete. If you’re organized and have your documents handy, 
you may cruise through it that quickly, but otherwise you’ll more 
than likely need 20 to 30 minutes.
In the following sections, we walk you through steps for using the 
T. Rowe Price retirement planning tools to get a better assessment 
of your financial numbers as you prepare for retirement. 

56
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
We use T. Rowe Price as an example, but please note that you can 
select another company’s tool if you prefer.
Understanding assumptions 
and how they work
Whether you use a retirement calculator online or via a workbook-
let, make sure you’re aware of the different assumptions used. This 
section details those assumptions.
In this section, we specifically look at the T. Rowe Price assump-
tions and online calculator. In order for you to be able to make 
the best use of this site, we review the following important key 
assumptions. If you choose not to use this online tool, you can use 
the discussion of the assumptions that follow for other retirement 
planning tools including the T. Rowe Price workbooklet.
 
✓ Asset allocation: The calculator asks you to enter your cur-
rent allocation (mix of major investment classes) and then to 
select an allocation for after you’re retired. For the retirement 
allocation, you can choose a fixed 40 percent stock, 40 percent 
bond, 20 percent money fund, or you can have the mix gradu-
ally shift away from stocks each year that you’re in retirement. 
Either choice is fine, but we have a slight preference for the 
latter of the two options.
 
 The calculator doesn’t include real estate as a possible asset. 
If you own real estate as an investment, you should treat those 
assets as a stock-like investment, because they have similar 
long-term risk and return characteristics. You should calculate 
your equity in investment real estate.
 
✓ Age of retirement: For this assumption, you plug in your pre-
ferred age of retirement, within reason of course. (For example, 
plugging in age 53 is pointless if you’ve selected that age know-
ing that the only way to accomplish that date is by winning the 
lottery.) Depending on how the analysis works out, you can 
always go back and plug in a different age. Sometimes folks are 
pleasantly surprised that their combined accumulated resources 
provide them with a decent enough standard of living that they 
can actually consider retiring sooner than they thought.

57
 Chapter 3: Developing a Retirement Plan
 
✓ Social Security: The T. Rowe Price calculator asks whether 
you want to include expected Social Security benefits. We’d 
rather that the calculator didn’t pose this question, because 
you definitely should include your Social Security benefits in 
the calculations. Don’t buy into the nonsense that the program 
will vaporize and leave you with little to nothing from it. For the 
vast majority of people, Social Security benefits are an impor-
tant component of their retirement income, so do include them.
 
 Based on your current income, the T. Rowe Price retirement 
program will automatically plug in your estimated Social 
Security benefits. So long as your income hasn’t changed or 
won’t change dramatically, using their estimated number 
should be fine. Alternatively, you could input your own number 
using a recent Social Security benefits statement if you have one 
handy. Or use the Retirement Estimator at the Social Security 
Web site (www.socialsecurity.gov/estimator).
 
 If you select a retirement age younger than age 62, the T. Rowe 
Price calculator won’t include Social Security benefits in the 
calculations. This is one aspect of their calculator with which 
we aren’t enamored. (If you’re in a position to retire sooner 
than age 62, there are other calculators, such as Schwab’s 
Retirement Savings Calculator at www.schwab.com, that can 
better assist you.)
After you enter your personal information and decide on the preced-
ing assumptions, you’re ready to finish the calculations on the T. 
Rowe Price Web site. The calculator assumes that you want to replace 
70 percent of your pre-retirement income through age 95. So Price’s 
completed analysis shows how much you can live on per month and 
then compares that with what you’re projected to need to maintain 
70 percent of your current income. The calculations include doing 
1,000 market simulations, and it works 70 percent of the time. (See 
the nearby sidebar “Monte Carlo retirement simulations” for a more 
detailed explanation of this type of modeling, if you’re interested.)
 
The T. Rowe Price analysis allows to you make adjustments, such 
as your desired age of retirement, rate of savings, and to what age 
you’d like your savings to last. So, for example, if the analysis 
showed that you have much more than enough to retire by age 65, 
try plugging in, say, age 62 and, voila, the calculator quickly shows 
you how the numbers change.

58
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
Making the numbers work
After you crunch the numbers, you may discover you need to save 
at a rate that isn’t doable. Don’t despair. You have the following 
options to lessen the depressingly high savings you apparently need:
 
✓ Boost your investment returns. Reduce your taxes while 
investing: While you’re still working, be sure to take advantage 
of retirement savings accounts, especially when you can gain 
free matching money from your employer or you’re eligible for 
the special tax credit from the government. When investing 
money outside of retirement accounts, take care to minimize 
taxes. For more on investing strategies, see Chapter 7.
 
✓ Work (a little) more. Extend the number of years you’re will-
ing to work, or consider working part time for a few years past 
the age you were expecting to stop working. Refer to Chapter 
18 for more information regarding working during retirement.
 
✓ Reduce your spending. The more you spend today, the more 
years you’ll have to work in order to meet your savings goal. 
See Chapter 6 to find out how to manage your spending in 
retirement.
 
✓ Use your home’s equity. If you didn’t factor using some of 
your home’s equity into your retirement nest egg, consider 
doing so. Some people are willing to trade down into a less 
costly property in retirement. You also can take a reverse 
mortgage to tap some of your property’s equity. We talk more 
about home equity and reverse mortgages in the earlier sec-
tion “Your home’s equity.”
Dealing with excess money
When Eric was working as a financial counselor, one of his favorite 
parts of the job was going over the retirement analysis with clients 
who had accumulated more than they needed to achieve their 
desired lifestyle. Often, this was a surprise to the client, so some 
folks had a hard time believing the good news.

59
 Chapter 3: Developing a Retirement Plan
If you find yourself with extra money, the good news is at least 
you don’t have to worry about making sure you can continue your 
current standard of living during retirement. In this situation, con-
sider taking either of the following actions:
 
✓ Enhance your retirement. We’re not suggesting that the only 
way to a happy retirement is to spend money, but don’t be 
afraid to enjoy yourself. While you’re still healthy, travel, eat 
out, take some classes, and do whatever else floats your boat 
(within reason, of course). Remember that come the end of 
your life, you can’t take your money with you.
Monte Carlo retirement simulations
When you start doing number crunch-
ing for retirement planning, you begin to 
realize that the outcome is dependent 
on many variables, which we discuss 
in the “Understanding assumptions and 
how they work” section in this chapter. 
In addition, other factors, such as how 
investment returns change over time, 
can have a significant impact, especially 
over the short term, on your retirement 
plans.
Over the past century, the rate of infla-
tion has averaged about 3 percent per 
year. Growth-oriented investments, such 
as stocks, have returned about 9 to 10 
percent per year historically. Bonds and 
other fixed-income investments have 
returned about 5 to 6 percent per year.
Those are long-term averages, which 
are all well and good, but suppose a 
worker decided to retire around the year 
2000, and, like most retirees early in their 
retirement, he still had a healthy chunk 
of his investments in stocks. Because the 
stock market experienced severe down-
turns both early and late in the 2000s, his 
standard of living and ability and comfort 
with taking withdrawals from his retire-
ment funds may be impacted.
A Monte Carlo simulation runs many dif-
ferent scenarios and calculates the like-
lihood (percentage of the time) that you 
will accomplish your retirement goal. The 
T. Rowe Price retirement calculator we 
walk you through in this chapter does 
Monte Carlo simulations and tests about 
1,000 market scenarios to see how your 
retirement plans will work out in many 
different market conditions.

60
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
 
✓ Earmark a portion of your assets for your beneficiaries. You 
may want to leave something for your family members as 
well as other beneficiaries, such as your place of worship and 
charities. If so, you need to determine the approximate dollar 
amount for each of the beneficiaries. Estate planning is so 
important that we devote Part IV to it.
 
Of course, life can throw you unexpected curve balls that could 
cause you to incur higher than expected expenses. But, if you’re 
always preparing for rainy day after rainy day, you may lead a 
miserly, unenjoyable retirement.
Making Plans for Nonfinancial 
Matters
Although our focus in this book is clearly on all matters financial 
in your senior years, you should know that we take a holistic 
approach to your finances. Getting caught up in the climb up the 
career ladder, burning the midnight oil, and accumulating wealth 
and possessions is easy in a capitalist society. In your pursuit, 
losing sight of some areas — the ones not about money — is also 
easy. These areas are just as important — if not more important — 
than your finances, which is why you should be working just as 
hard at planning them. That’s what we discuss in this section.
Personal connections
A lot of research shows that those individuals who have strong 
and healthy connections in their later years tend to be happier, 
enjoy better health, live longer, and live longer independently. As 
you’re preparing for retirement, make sure you spend time making 
and maintaining healthy personal relationships. Doing so is an 
investment that pays dividends by improving the length and qual-
ity of your life.

61
 Chapter 3: Developing a Retirement Plan
 
If you have children of your own (and perhaps they give you grand-
children), you’ve got a built-in network of younger folks to keep you 
actively involved. If you don’t have any children or grandchildren, 
or if you want more personal connections, you can forge friend-
ships with people younger than you through your activities, hob-
bies, fellowship, and so forth.
Personal health
Your health is much, much more important than your financial 
net worth. Just ask folks who have major medical problems — 
especially those they could have avoided — if they wish they had 
taken better care of their health. Although anyone can experience 
bad luck or bad genes when it comes to health, you can do a lot 
to stay healthy and enjoy enhanced longevity and the best pos-
sible quality of life. Chapter 2 can help you take action and plan 
ahead for health.
Activities, hobbies, interests
For folks who have had full-time jobs, retiring and having no job to 
occupy their days sounds alluring. However, some retirees feel a 
lack of purpose and miss the satisfaction that comes from meeting 
the challenges of work. A fringe benefit of most people’s work is 
the human interaction that comes along with it.
 
When planning for your future, consider the following as good sub-
stitutes for work, because they provide challenges and foster 
friendships and connections with others:
 
✓ Activities and hobbies: Exercising is a good choice to include 
in long-term plans; it provides vast health benefits and oppor-
tunities to meet new friends and hang out with old ones. If 
you’re not into exercising, perhaps you can look at different 
hobbies you like, such as collecting something. You can meet 
interesting people and make new friends by going to auctions, 
garage sales, and such. People like to collect all sorts of things; 
just be careful you don’t spend too much money.

62
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
 
✓ Part-time work: Working part time, especially when you have 
more flexibility in setting your hours, can be an excellent 
part of a retirement plan. It can provide enjoyments and a 
challenge — not to mention some extra dough. Check out 
Chapter 18 for more on continuing to work during retirement.
 
✓ Volunteering: Giving something back to society pays many 
dividends. You can find a zillion volunteer opportunities. 
Your place of worship, organizations that support a cause you 
believe in (for example, fighting cancer or heart disease), and 
schools are super places to start looking. Stumped for ideas? 
Try a service like VolunteerMatch (www.volunteermatch.org).

Chapter 4
Identifying Retirement Investments 
and Strategies
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding how investments differ
▶ Preparing to select and modify your investments
▶ Reviewing commonly used investments and their strengths and weaknesses
▶ Separating the best investments from the rest
▶ Evaluating and changing your current portfolio
L
ife, at least in a capitalistic economy, is full of choices. And, is 
that ever true when it comes to investments. You have more 
investments to choose from than you’ll ever have time to research. 
As you approach and then enter retirement, making smart decisions 
is even more important than ever because you’ll likely be living off 
of your investments. Most folks live on their investment income 
and eventually tap into some of the investment principal especially 
later in their retirement years.
In this key chapter, we discuss your best investment options for 
retirement money and help you understand the differences among 
investments. We discuss some of our favorite investments for you 
to consider. And, last but not least, we explain how to evaluate, 
make changes to, and monitor your portfolio.

64
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
Defining Investments
As you construct and manage an investment portfolio for your 
retirement, you must consider numerous factors. You shouldn’t, 
for example, simply chase after investments that historically have 
posted higher rates of return because those investments tend to 
be riskier, especially in the shorter-term. Also, investments differ 
from one another in their income-producing ability; how they 
are taxed at the federal, state, and local level; and their sensitivity 
to inflation, among other factors.
Before we dive into the dimensions on which investments differ 
from one another, we need to start with something far more basic. 
We first define what an investment is. An investment is something 
into which you choose to put your money in the hopes of earning 
some return and protecting what you’ve invested. All money, 
therefore, is in some sort of investment, even what’s put in bank 
accounts, low-return short-term treasury bills, money market 
funds, and so on.
Understanding risk
When you make investments, even low-return ones, you have a 
potential for risk. The risk, of course, is that seemingly attractive 
higher-return-producing investments can and sometimes do 
decline in value. 
During good economic times like the 1990s, some people make 
the mistake of feeling as if their money is wasting away or not 
“invested” if it’s in low-return, safer money investments. As a 
result, they may rush to invest the money elsewhere with the hope 
of earning a higher return. In the late 1990s, we saw more and 
more conservative folks putting funds they intended to stash away 
for a rainy day into the stock market to get quick returns. Safe 
investments were derided with the expression, “Cash is trash.”

65
 Chapter 4: Identifying Retirement Investments and Strategies
Some investments are riskier, which is to say that they fluctuate 
more in value and can produce greater losses over the short term. 
That’s why when you make investments, you need to completely 
understand what potentially could happen to your money. You 
need to consider two important points when considering risk:
 
✓ Risk is fine as long as you understand what you’re getting 
yourself into. There’s nothing wrong with taking risk. In fact, 
an investor needs to accept risk in order to have the potential 
for earning a higher return. Just make sure you’re educated 
on the options and understand the risks you’re choosing to 
accept with your choices.
 
 You need to protect certain types of funds and take little 
or no risk with them. For example, your emergency reserve 
fund (which you can tap for unexpected expenses) money 
shouldn’t be in an investment subject to fluctuations in value, 
such as the stock market. Instead, you should invest this 
money in someplace stable and accessible, such as a savings 
account or money market fund.
 
✓ Not taking any risk is risky. You want to select those 
investments that suit your particular goals and your desire 
and necessity to take risk, in terms of producing sufficient 
returns to help pay for your retirement. The trick is to carefully 
balance the return you require against the risk that you may 
be exposed to in seeking a higher return investment. You need 
a certain amount of money saved to maintain a desired standard 
of living during retirement. If the money you’re accumulating 
is invested too conservatively and grows too slowly, you may 
need to work many more years or save at a much higher rate 
before you can afford to retire. That’s why you should do the 
number crunching for retirement planning that we discuss in 
Chapter 3.

Part I: Working toward Retirement 
The 2000s wake-up call about risk
The 2000s was a decade that contained 
several wake-up calls for investors 
concerning risk. The 1990s was one 
of the best ever for U.S. stock market 
investors, especially those who loaded 
up on technology and Internet stocks. So 
some investors were complacent about 
the risks in the stock market. 
There were two severe bear markets 
of the 2000s: the first occurring in the 
early 2000s and the second occurring in 
the late 2000s. Folks nearing retirement 
with too large a portion of their 
portfolios in stocks were shocked to 
see their retirement plans altered by 
unexpected events.
The early 2000s bear market punctured 
the bubble in technology and Internet 
stocks, which by any reasonable measure 
were grossly overvalued in the late 1990s. 
Many investors, however, blindly bought 
them because the successful companies 
in this space were growing fast. These 
investors neglected looking at valuation 
measures (such as price-earnings ratios, 
book value, cash flow, and so forth). 
When these companies’ earnings began 
to decline, their stocks got clobbered 
with many falling 70, 80, even 90 percent 
or more. Because technology stocks 
comprised a large share of popular 
stock market indexes like the S&P 500, 
investors who thought they were being 
conservative by investing in index funds 
also absorbed part of this decline.
The terrorist attacks of September 11, 
2001, also surprised many investors 
and added to financial market turmoil 
especially as wars were fought in Iraq 
and Afghanistan. 
The financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 
brought a new set of problems. Instability 
and risk in the banking system and 
investments held by that sector shook 
the foundations of many countries’ 
economies including America’s. Some 
large, blue-chip companies previously 
thought to be safe went under and others 
needed government assistance. The 
U.S. stock market suffered its largest 
percentage decline since the 1930s. 
Investments in real estate and other 
assets also declined sharply during the 
crisis. So, even investors with diversified 
portfolios learned a new lesson about 
risk.
The stock market bounced back 
after both of the 2000s bear markets. 
But, some damage was still done to 
investors’ portfolios with too large a 
percentage invested in stocks. Those 
who suffered the most were those who 
panicked and sold at depressed prices 
and those who were poorly diversified 
and overweighted with hot sectors that 
came plummeting back to Earth. And, it 
was a nerve wracking period for older 
investors and a reminder to understand 
the risks in various investments and the 
value of proper diversification.

 Chapter 4: Identifying Retirement Investments and Strategies
Eyeing your returns
In order to fully understand investments, you must keep in mind 
that investments differ from one another in terms of their returns. 
Returns are basically the total profit you earn on your investment. 
Investments generally come in two forms: current income and 
appreciation. We detail both in the following sections.
Current income
Investments may produce current income, typically in the form of 
interest or dividends, which are profits distributed to corporate 
stockholders. If, for example, you place your money in a bank 
certificate of deposit that matures in one year, the bank may pay, 
say, 2 percent interest. Likewise, if you invest in a treasury note 
issued by the federal government, which matures in two years, 
you may be paid 3 percent interest.
 
Income-oriented investments, such as treasury bills, don’t allow 
you to profit when the company or organization profits. When you 
lend your money to an organization, such as by purchasing bonds, 
the best that can happen is that the organization repays your 
principal with interest.
Appreciation
Some types of investments are more growth oriented and don’t 
pay much, if any, current income. A growth investment is one that 
has good potential to appreciate (increase) in value in the years 
and decades ahead. 
 
Investments that are more growth oriented, such as real estate 
or stocks (investments in companies), allow you to share in the 
success of a specific company or local economy in general. Some 
stocks offer dividends as well as the opportunity to participate in 
the appreciation of stock prices. Although the yield on a good stock 
from its dividend typically is well below the interest rate paid on a 
decent corporate bond, some stocks do offer reasonable dividend 
yields.

68
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
Considering how investments 
are susceptible to inflation
Some investments are more resistant to inflation, or increases 
in the cost of living.The purchasing power of money invested in 
bonds that pay a fixed rate of interest, for example, is eroded by a 
rise in inflation. The value of investments such as real estate and 
precious metals like gold and silver, by contrast, often benefits 
from higher inflation (although we must note that precious metals 
have generated poor long-term returns). Stocks, over the long 
run, have proven to be a good inflation hedge and have produced 
long-term returns well above the rate of inflation.
Being aware of tax consequences
When researching investments, you need to be clear about the 
possible tax consequences you face with the different investments 
you may make. Apart from investments in tax-sheltered retirement 
accounts, the interest or dividends produced by investments are 
generally taxable in the year they’re earned. The profits (known as 
capital gains) from selling an investment at a higher price than it 
was purchased for also are taxable.
 
If you invest without paying attention to taxes, you’ll likely overlook 
ways to maximize your returns. Two simple yet powerful moves 
can help you to invest in a tax-wise way:
 
✓ Contribute to your retirement accounts so that less of your 
money is taxed in the first place. Doing so reduces your taxes 
both in the years you make your contributions as well as each 
year your money is invested. Consult Chapter 5 for more 
information on retirement accounts.

69
 Chapter 4: Identifying Retirement Investments and Strategies
 
✓ With money that you invest outside retirement accounts, 
choose investments that match your tax situation. If you’re 
in a high tax bracket, you should avoid investments that pro-
duce significant highly taxed distributions. For example, you 
should avoid taxable bonds, certificates of deposit and other 
investments that pay taxable interest income, and those that 
tend to distribute short-term capital gains (which are taxed at 
the same high tax rates as ordinary income). Instead, consider 
growth-oriented investments, such as stocks, real estate, or 
investments in yours or someone else’s small business. Long-
term capital gains, which are gains from investments sold after 
a holding period of more than one year, are taxed at lower 
rates. Keep in mind that growth-oriented investments gener-
ally carry more risk.
 
 If you’re in a high tax bracket and would like to invest in bonds 
outside a retirement account, consider municipal bonds that 
pay federally tax-free interest. The interest on municipal 
bonds is free of state taxes if the bond was issued in the state 
in which you live. 
Monitoring sensitivity to currency 
and economic issues
Not all investments move in concert with the health and performance 
of the U.S. economy. Investments in overseas securities, for instance, 
allow you to participate directly in economic growth internationally 
as well as diversify against the risk of economic problems in the 
U.S. However, even international securities are susceptible to 
currency-value fluctuations relative to the U.S. dollar.
 
Because foreign economies and currency values don’t always move 
in tandem with those in the U.S., investing overseas may help to 
dampen the overall volatility of your portfolio. Investing in U.S. 
companies that operate worldwide serves a similar purpose.

What You Need to Do Before You 
Select and Change Investments
We understand that you already may have money invested. Even 
so, you can still use the information we provide in this chapter to 
improve upon your holdings and learn from past mistakes.
In this section, we discuss the importance of matching your 
financial needs, now and in the future, against the riskiness of 
your investments. Lastly, we discuss how to whip up the best 
investment mix — or asset allocation — for your situation.
Knowing your time horizon
A critical issue to weigh when investing a chunk of money toward 
a specific goal like retirement is knowing your time horizon, or the 
length of time you have in mind until you need the money.
 
The potential problem with timing is this: If you invest your money 
in a risky investment and it drops in value just before you need to 
sell, you could be forced to take a loss or a much lower gain than 
you anticipated. So you should be concerned about matching the 
risk or volatility of your investments with the time frame that you 
have in mind.
Suppose you’re investing some money that you plan to use for 
some one-time expenses in a few years. With a short time frame 
in mind, investments such as stocks or real estate wouldn’t be 
appropriate, because they can fluctuate a great deal in value from 
year to year. These more growth-oriented (and volatile) investments, 
on the other hand, can be useful in working toward longer-term 
goals, such as retirement, that may be a decade or more away. 
(Chapter 3 provides information on how to figure out when you 
can afford to retire.)

71
 Chapter 4: Identifying Retirement Investments and Strategies
Factoring some risk into 
your investment plan
In addition to the time horizon we discuss in the preceding 
section, your need to take risk also should be factored into your 
investment decisions. If the money that you’re investing for 
retirement grows too slowly, which may happen if you stashed 
it all in bank accounts and treasury bills, you may not be able to 
retire when you want or live the lifestyle you desire. To reach your 
retirement goals, you may need to take more risk.
 
Although your retirement goals may require you to take more risk, 
you don’t necessarily have to. Retaining a balanced portfolio of 
stocks and bonds where you have appreciation potential from the 
stocks and more income and less volatility from bonds sounds 
good in theory. But, if you’re going to be a nervous wreck and 
follow the stock market’s every move, it may not be worth it for you 
to take as much risk. In that case, you need to consider rethinking 
your goals. Also, if you’re in the fortunate position of not needing 
to take much risk because you’re well on your way toward your 
retirement savings goal, taking more risk than necessary may cause 
you to lose what you have accrued. (Chapter 3 provides more on 
retirement planning.)
Keeping the bigger picture in mind
When purchasing a new investment, make sure you consider your 
overall financial plan. Investors often read articles or get tips from 
colleagues and wind up buying the recommended investments. 
Investing without doing sufficient homework leads to a hodgepodge 
portfolio that’s often not properly diversified, among other problems. 
Failure to make an overall plan usually results in a recipe for failure, 
not success.

72
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
For example, when Eric worked as a financial planner/counselor, he 
was surprised at how often he’d meet with clients who had excess 
cash in low-interest money market funds or savings accounts while 
they carried high-cost debts, such as auto loans and credit-card 
balances. He was able to convince many of them to pay down the 
high-cost debt after he showed them how much they could save or 
make by doing so. (This same logic holds for older, more conserva-
tive investors who need to pay down mortgages.)
Likewise, Eric found that investors who preferred individual stocks 
would fret when one of their holdings fell. Because such investors 
wouldn’t examine their overall portfolio’s performance, too 
frequently they would unnecessarily dump a stock currently in the 
hole. They’d dwell on that stock’s large decline and overlook how 
little impact this one holding had on their overall portfolio.
 
This strategy is particularly dangerous if you fail to consider the 
big picture and overinvest in employer stock. You may think you’re 
being a loyal team player, but watch out. This strategy is hazardous 
because a company that falls on hard times may not only lead to 
the loss of a job but also to the loss of retirement assets when the 
stock takes a permanent nose dive. Investing more than 10 percent 
of your financial assets in your employer’s stock is usually too risky.
Allocating your assets
When you’re investing for longer-term financial goals such as 
retirement, be sure to invest in an array of different investments. 
Diversified investments may include such things as stock mutual 
funds (both U.S. and international), bonds, and, perhaps, real estate.
How you divide your money among these different types of 
investments is known as asset allocation. Asset allocation need 
not be complicated or intimidating. As a general rule, you should 
conduct asset allocation for money invested for the longer term — 
that is, at least more than five years, though preferably ten or 
more years. See our advice and recommendations for determining 
an appropriate asset allocation in Chapter 3.

73
 Chapter 4: Identifying Retirement Investments and Strategies
Before you begin the process of allocating your assets, make sure 
you have an emergency cash reserve of three to six months of 
living expenses. Set aside even more if your income and job are 
unstable and you don’t have family or friends you could tap for 
help. Three months’ worth of living expenses, on the other hand, 
is sufficient if your income is safe and stable or you have other 
resources you can easily tap.
Other investments that you hold outside of retirement accounts, 
such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds that invest in stocks and 
bonds, can quickly be converted into cash. However, the problem 
with considering these investments for emergencies is that 
because they fluctuate in value, the selling price may be much less 
than what you paid originally.
Surveying Different Investments
If you’re ready to take a closer look at which investments are best 
for you or if you want to modify your investments to better meet 
your needs, you’ve come to the right place. Getting your investment 
portfolio in order with your money in the right vehicles is an 
important step to prepare for retirement. To help you settle on the 
best investments for your situation, we discuss the major types of 
investments and when you should consider using them.
Comparing lending investments 
to ownership investments
Investors are often bewildered at all the investment options from 
which they can choose. But, we can simplify things for you. All the 
investments you may choose from fall under one of the following 
two categories:

74
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
 
✓ Lending investments: A lending investment, as the name 
suggests, is an investment where you lend your money, 
typically to an organization. For example, when you place your 
money in a bank account, such as a savings account, you’re 
essentially lending your money to a bank for an agreed upon 
interest rate.
 
 Bonds, which are IOUs issued by companies, are another 
common lending investment. When you buy a newly issued 
ten-year bond from Verizon at 6 percent, for example, you’re 
lending your money to Verizon for ten years in exchange for 6 
percent interest per year. If things go according to plan, you’ll 
get your 6 percent interest annually, and you’ll get your 
principal (the original investment) back when the bond 
matures in a decade.
 
✓ Ownership investments: With ownership investments, by 
contrast, you own a piece of an asset that has the ability 
to produce profits or earnings. Stocks, which are shares of 
ownership in a company, and real estate are ownership 
investments.
 
 In a capitalistic economy, individual investors build greater 
wealth by being owners, not lenders. For example, say Verizon 
doubles in size and profits over the next seven years. As one 
of their bondholders, you won’t share in the growth. As a 
stockholder, however, you would benefit from a stock price 
driven higher by greater profits. Ownership investments can 
also produce income, such as the dividends paid on some stocks 
or the rental income produced when you rent out real estate.
Over the past two centuries, U.S. stock market investors (owners) 
have earned an average of 9 to 10 percent per year whereas bond 
investors (lenders) have earned just 5 percent per year.
 
As we mention in the earlier section “Understanding risk,” risk and 
return generally go hand in hand. If you seek safe investments — 
investments with low volatility and low likelihood of the value of 
the investment declining — you’ll usually have to settle for lending 
investments with relatively low returns. If you seek higher returns 
well ahead of the rate of inflation, on the other hand, you must use 
investments that provide an ownership stake and could either rise 
or fall in value.

75
 Chapter 4: Identifying Retirement Investments and Strategies
Looking into stocks
Investing in stocks is one of the most accessible ways you can 
invest for long-term growth. Stocks, which are shares of ownership in 
companies, historically have produced returns averaging about 9 
to 10 percent per year. At that rate of return, even without adding 
to your investment, your money should double every seven to 
eight years. Thank the rule of 72 for this doubling. The rule of 72 
says that if you divide 72 by your annual return, you’ll determine 
about how many years it takes to double your money.
When companies go public, they issue shares of stock that can be 
bought on one of the major stock exchanges, such as the New York 
Stock Exchange. As the economy grows and companies grow with 
it and earn greater profits, stock prices generally follow suit. Stock 
prices don’t move in lock step with earnings, but, over the years, 
the relationship is pretty close. In fact, the price-earnings ratio — 
which measures the level of stock prices relative to (or divided by) 
company earnings — of U.S. stocks has averaged approximately 15 
during the past century. Although the ratio has varied and crept 
above 30 and went as low as 6, it tends to fluctuate around 15 (it 
has been slightly higher during periods of low inflation and low 
interest rates).
 
Be forewarned that the U.S. stock market, as measured by the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average, has fallen more than 20 percent about 
every six years (the declines in the early and late 2000s were much 
worse). That’s the bad news. The good news is that these declines 
lasted, on average, less than two years. So if you can withstand 
declines over a few years, the stock market is a terrific place to 
invest for long-term growth.
 
If you’re investing in stocks, keep the following two suggestions in 
mind to help you build wealth faster in the stock market:
 
✓ Reduce fees and commissions while investing. Not only 
does excessive trading lead to your possibly being out of the 
market on the best days and reduce your returns, it also can 
increase your transaction costs and taxes. A simple way to 
stack the stock market odds in your favor is to minimize fees 
and commissions when investing. That means after you make 

76
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
an investment, you must resist the urge to buy and sell, which 
raises your fees and commissions. All things being equal, 
lower commissions and fees paid to purchase and hold 
investments increase your investment returns.
 
✓ Regularly save and invest. Thanks to the miracle of 
compounding, if you save and invest $5,000 per year in a 
tax-deferred account returning an average of 10 percent per 
year, you’ll have about $440,000 in 20 years.
Don’t fall into the trap of timing 
the stock market
A big mistake that novice investors make 
is trying to time the stock market; that 
is, they jump in when they think prices 
will rise and jump back out when they 
believe prices will fall. Even for the best 
professional investors, market timing is 
difficult, if not impossible, to do. It’s far 
more important and valuable to regularly 
save and invest than attempt to time the 
market. Inevitably, those who try to time 
the markets earn inferior returns.
Professors Geoffrey Friesen and Travis 
Sapp examined 14 years worth of 
money flows for more than 7,000 mutual 
funds. They found that timing decisions 
by investors reduced their annual 
returns by about 1.6 percent per year 
below what those investors would have 
earned through buying and holding. This 
underperformance persisted and was 
consistent through both up and down 
markets.
The professors found that investors made 
worse timing decisions when it came 
to withdrawals (selling) than they did 
with purchases (buying). The investors’ 
selling decisions led to an annual 
underperformance of about 1.8 percent 
per year versus underperformance of 
just 0.7 percent per year with buys. These 
numbers make sense because, more 
often than not, folks who panic and sell 
during a stock market decline tend to sell 
nearer the end of the decline and then 
fail to get back in before the rebound, 
which is usually sharp.
It’s the rare market timer who beats the 
market average returns. Many of these 
folks actually underperform a “buy and 
hold” approach. The reason for the 
underperformance is quite simple: The 
stock market can move up quickly, and if 
you’re sitting on the sidelines during one 
of these high moves, you miss out. That’s 
exactly what happened to many folks 
during the strong stock market rebound 
that ensued after the steep decline of 
2008 and early 2009.

77
 Chapter 4: Identifying Retirement Investments and Strategies
Investing in mutual funds and ETFs
Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are ideal investment 
vehicles to help you carry out your investment plans. The three 
main advantages of the best mutual funds and ETFs are
 
✓ Diversification: Mutual funds and ETFs typically invest in 
dozens of securities. A truly diversified stock fund invests in 
stocks in different industries and different stocks within an 
industry. The same logic works for bond funds too.
 
✓ Efficiency: Good money managers don’t come cheaply. 
However, because funds buy and sell large blocks of securities 
and typically manage hundreds of millions or billions of 
dollars, the cost of their services is spread out.
 
✓ Professional oversight: Unless you have lots of money and 
free time on your hands, researching investments will, at best, 
be a part-time hobby for you. A fund manager and his or her 
team of analysts are devoted full time to selecting investments 
and monitoring them on an ongoing basis.
 
The best mutual funds offer a low cost, professionally managed way 
to diversify your investment dollars. Index funds, which are a type 
of mutual fund, invest to follow a specific stock or bond market 
index and usually have the advantage of low costs, which helps 
boost your returns. ETFs are generally index-like funds that trade 
on a stock exchange. (See the section “Index and exchange-traded 
funds” later in this chapter for more details on those types of 
funds.)
Several different types of funds exist. Which ones work for you 
depends on the level of risk you desire and are able to accept. 
Here’s a list of the types you may choose:
 
✓ Money market funds: These funds are the safest types of 
mutual funds. Money market funds seek to maintain a fixed 
share price of $1 per share. They invest in short-term debt of 
companies and governments. You make your money from the 
dividends, just like you would with a bank savings account’s 
interest. The main difference and advantage that the best 

78
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
money market funds have over bank savings accounts are 
that the better ones generate a higher yield or rate of return. 
Because there’s little, if any, risk of bankruptcy, money funds 
aren’t insured the way bank accounts are.
 
✓ Bond funds: The attraction of bond funds, diversified portfolios 
of bonds, is that they pay higher dividends than money market 
funds. So, for retirees who want more current income on 
which to live, bond funds can make sense.
 
 The drawback or risk of bonds is that they fluctuate in value 
with changes in interest rates. If the overall level of interest 
rates rises, the market value of existing bonds decreases. This 
occurs because with new bonds being issued at higher interest 
rates, the price of existing bonds must decrease enough 
that the resulting yield or interest rate is comparable to that 
offered on new bonds. Longer-term bonds are more volatile 
with changes in interest rates because your principal is being 
repaid more years down the road.
 
 The value of bonds issued by corporations also may fluctuate 
with the financial fortunes of the company. When a company 
hits a hard patch, investors question whether their bonds will 
be repaid and drive the price down. When investors fear 
bankruptcy is a real possibility, the bonds may sell for only a 
fraction of the original debt or principal.
 
✓ Stock funds: Stock funds invest in shares of stock issued 
by companies. Most funds invest in stocks of dozens of 
different companies. Funds typically focus on either U.S. or 
international companies.
 
 Stock funds are the most volatile of mutual funds and ETFs, 
but they also hold the promise of higher potential returns. On 
average, stocks have returned investors about 10 percent per 
year over the decades. Over short periods, however, stocks 
can drop significantly in value. Drops of more than 10 or 20 
percent aren’t uncommon and should be expected. So don’t 
commit money to stock funds that you expect to need or use 
within the next five years. Although they’re completely liquid 
on a day’s notice, you don’t want to be forced to sell a stock 
fund during a down period and possibly lose money.

79
 Chapter 4: Identifying Retirement Investments and Strategies
 
 You can choose to invest in stocks by making your own 
selection of individual stocks or by letting a mutual fund 
manager do the picking and managing. Researching individual 
stocks can be more than a full-time job. And, if you choose to 
take this path, remember that you’ll be competing against the 
pros who do it full time.
Over the years, increasing numbers of investors have turned to 
mutual funds for their stock market investing rather than picking 
and choosing individual stocks on their own. While there’s plenty 
of debate about the merits of these two investment strategies, 
plenty of sources are pushing investors to individual stocks. For 
instance, many Web sites, financial magazines, and television 
programs advocate for individual stocks. For more information on 
mutual funds including ETFs, check out the latest edition of Mutual 
Funds For Dummies by Eric Tyson (Wiley).
Beware of mutual fund detractors
Private money managers inevitably bash 
mutual funds because these funds often 
are their competition. Some financial 
newsletter writers and book authors 
even mislead investors into thinking 
that picking their own stocks is the best 
approach to investing in the market. 
Among the arguments made by advo-
cates of stock picking are the following:
 ✓ Most mutual funds underperform 
the market indexes. Most mutual 
funds do indeed underperform 
their corresponding market index. 
This underperformance is due to 
expenses. Most of the studies we 
have reviewed on this topic typically 
show that about two-thirds of funds 
underperform their relevant market 
index. However, you can’t consider 
this an argument for picking your 
own stocks. The fact of the matter is 
that even more individual investors 
underperform the market indexes 
(see next point in this list). Also, you 
have a few simple and powerful ways 
to increase your mutual fund returns: 
avoid costly funds and use index 
funds and actively managed funds 
run by the best managers.
 ✓ You make higher returns picking 
your own stocks. Professors Brad 
Barber and Terrance Odean reviewed 
investment club participants’ 
trading records and discovered 
that the average club actually 
underperformed the broad stock 
market average by more than 3 
percent per year.

Comparing investments and risks
When considering how you want to invest or when studying your 
current investments, take a close look at the breakdown of the 
different types you have and their associated risks. Different 
combinations can give you different results. Consider these points:
 
✓ Bonds and savings-type vehicles, such as money market 
mutual funds, deserve a spot in your portfolio. For money 
that you expect to use within the next couple of years or for 
money that you need to earn a relatively high current income 
from, bonds and money market funds can make great sense. 
Historically, such investments have produced returns about 
the same as to a bit more than the rate of inflation (3 percent).
(continued)
  An investment club from Beardstown, 
Illinois, wrote the book, The 
Beardstown Ladies’ Common-Sense 
Investment Guide: How We Beat 
the Stock Market — And How You 
Can, Too. In it, the club members 
claimed that returns were averaging 
nearly 24 percent per year, far ahead 
of the stock market averages of that 
period. Not until years after their 
best-selling book was published 
did it come out that the club really 
only earned a 9 percent annualized 
return, which placed their returns 
far below the market averages. The 
book’s publisher, Hyperion, lost a 
class-action lawsuit brought on 
behalf of defrauded book buyers.
 ✓ You can control tax-related issues, 
such as when you when buy and sell 
securities and recognize taxable 
gains or losses. This argument has 
some truth to it, but you can find tax-
friendly funds, including tax-managed 
funds, index funds, and exchange-
traded funds. We discuss index funds 
and exchange-traded funds in this 
chapter.

81
 Chapter 4: Identifying Retirement Investments and Strategies
 
✓ Although stocks and real estate offer investors attractive 
long-term returns, they can and do suffer significant short-
term declines in value. Just consider what happened in the 
late 2000s severe stock market and real estate decline. So, 
these investments aren’t suitable for money that you may 
want or need to use within the next five years.
 
✓ Money market and bond investments are good places to 
keep emergency money that you expect to use sooner. 
Everyone should have a reserve of money that they can 
access in an emergency. Keeping about three to six months’ 
worth of living expenses in a money market fund is a good 
start. Shorter-term bonds or bond mutual funds can serve as 
an additional, greater (than money funds) income-producing 
emergency cushion.
 
✓ Bonds can provide useful diversification for longer-term 
investing. For example, when investing for retirement, placing 
a portion of one’s money in bonds helps to buffer stock market 
declines. When investing for longer-term goals, however, some 
younger investors may not be interested in a significant stake 
(or any stake at all) in boring, old bonds. The reason: They have 
decades until they will tap their money and are comfortable 
with the risks of higher returning investments like stocks and 
real estate. 
Take a look at Figure 4-1, which shows the historic returns (over 
the past 83 years) and risks of a portfolio made up of a 50/50 mix 
of bonds and stocks compared with an all-stock portfolio. While 
the all-stock portfolio produced higher average annual returns 
(9.6 percent versus 8.1 percent), it did so with more down years 
(25 versus 17) and with far worse down years (–43.1 percent 
versus –22.5 percent). A balanced portfolio produces solid long-
term returns with quite a bit less risk than an all stock portfolio.

Managing Investment Portfolios
When saving money for your retirement, ultimately you must 
select investments into which you place that money. Plenty of 
folks find selecting investments stressful and challenging. We’re 
here to remove the anxiety and help you assemble an all-star 
investment portfolio that will build and protect your wealth over 
the years ahead.
Earlier in this chapter, we discuss the spectrum of available 
investments and highlight the important differences among them. 
Ownership investments, including stocks around the world, real 
estate, and small business, offer the greatest potential returns but 
also higher risk.

83
 Chapter 4: Identifying Retirement Investments and Strategies
We don’t explicitly discuss real estate and small business in more 
detail in this section except to say that for asset allocation purposes 
they can fulfill a role similar to investing in stocks. For a detailed

Investing For Dummies (Wiley).
In this section, we discuss core funds — such as funds of funds, 
target-date funds, index funds, and exchange-traded funds — that 
make sense for you to consider. We also present some methods for 
assessing and managing your investment portfolio.
Funds of funds and 
target-date funds
Most fund investors feel overwhelmed by having so many choices. 
They understand the need to hold a diversified portfolio but 
they’re not sure how to assemble one. Enter fund of funds and 
target date funds. Both of these types of funds give you exposure 
to numerous funds within a single fund. And, target-date funds 
gradually adjust the risk of its portfolio as you approach a particu-
lar retirement date. 
Examining funds of funds
Decades ago the mutual fund industry was beginning to reach critical 
mass and developing and expanding its fund offerings. The large 
fund companies soon had dozens of funds, and increasing numbers 
of investors found choosing among them a bit overwhelming.
Informed individual investors understood the concept of diversifi-
cation and knew they should invest in a variety of funds that gave 
them exposure to different types of assets. And fund company 
representatives often found themselves being asked by investors 
for advice about what basket of funds they should invest in. So, 
fund companies created funds of funds — that is, single funds 
comprising numerous companies’ funds.

Part I: Working toward Retirement 
For example, consider the Vanguard Star fund, which was created 
in 1985. It’s made up of 11 Vanguard funds, including domestic and 
foreign stock funds, bond funds, and a money market fund. Stocks 
comprise about 62.5 percent of the fund (and about one-fourth 
of those are foreign), bonds about 25 percent, and money market 
assets about 12.5 percent. Of course, one size doesn’t fit all, but 
for investors seeking global diversification and an asset allocation 
similar to this fund’s, Star offers low costs (its annual operating 
expense ratio is just 0.32 percent) and relatively low minimum 
investment amounts ($1,000).
 In addition to the asset allocation, expenses, and riskiness of any 
fund of funds you may consider, also be sure to consider the tax 
appropriateness of the fund. Funds of funds that invest in bonds 
usually aren’t very tax friendly because they hold taxable bonds. 
Therefore, such funds generally only make sense inside of a 
retirement account or for lower-tax-bracket investors investing 
outside of a retirement account.
Understanding target-date funds
Target-date funds are funds of funds with a twist. Rather than 
maintaining a generally fixed asset allocation, especially between 
stocks and bonds, target-date funds adjust their mix over time. 
For example, the T. Rowe Price Retirement 2030 Fund is designed 
for investors expecting to retire around the year 2030. It invests 
in about 16 different T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds. Over 
time (and as you approach the retirement date of 2030), the fund 
reduces its stock exposure and increases its bond exposure. Thus, 
it reduces the riskiness of the portfolio.
The risks of target-date funds are similar to funds of funds. The 
only additional risk of a target-date fund is if the fund manager 
tries to time the markets in his moves into and out of stocks and 
bonds and guesses wrong. The funds we recommend in this 
chapter don’t suffer this flaw.
 
Among the better target-date funds we’ve reviewed include

Index and exchange-traded funds
A simple, low-cost way to invest in stocks or bonds is to invest in 
what’s known as an index fund. These are passively managed funds 
that mechanically follow an index, such as one of the following:
 
✓ Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index: A broad index 
that tracks the U.S. bond market.
 
✓ Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 Index: Tracks 500 large U.S.-
headquartered companies’ stocks.
 
✓ MSCI U.S. Broad Market Index: This index follows small, 
medium, and large U.S.-company stocks.
 
✓ MSCI Europe Index, MSCI Pacific Index, MSCI Emerging 
Market Index: These three indexes respectively track the 
major stock markets in Europe, the Pacific Rim, and in 
emerging economies, such as Brazil, China, India, and so on.
 
✓ FTSE All-World Index: A global stock market index.
 
All index funds aren’t created equal. How so? They do have these 
differences, so make sure you closely investigate any funds before 
you make an investment:
 
✓ Some have higher expenses than others. Lower costs, of 
course, are generally better when comparing index funds that 
track the same index (as long as the lower-cost index fund 
tracks its index well).
 
✓ Some indexes are likely to produce better long-term returns 
than others. For example, we aren’t fans of investing in the 
S&P 500 index because it’s a capitalization-weighted index. 
With this type of index, stocks hold a weighting in the index 
based on their total market value.

86
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
 
 For instance, during the 1990s, the technology sector’s stock 
weighting in the S&P 500 index ballooned from about 6 percent 
in 1990 to 29 percent by 1999. So, investors buying into an S&P 
500 at the end of 1999 had nearly 30 percent of their investment 
dollars going into pricey technology stocks. The financial 
sector experienced a similar ballooning in weighting before its 
steep price drop in the late 2000s.
In addition to traditional index funds, some index funds invest 
in value-oriented stocks, which are those selling at relatively low 
valuations compared to the companies’ financial positions. 
Value-oriented stocks are far less likely to hold hot sector stocks 
destined to crash back to Earth. You also can use index funds that 
invest in equal weights in the stocks of a given index.
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are index-like funds that trade on a 
major stock exchange. The best ETFs have even lower costs than 
index funds. But, plenty of ETFs have flaws, such as higher costs 
or a narrow industry or small-country investment focus.
 
Here’s a list (in order from bond funds, U.S. stock funds, and then 
foreign funds) of index funds and ETFs that are our favorites:
 
✓ iShares Barclays Aggregate Bond (AGG): This ETF invests in 
investment-grade bonds and follows the Barclays Aggregate 
Bond Index.
 
✓ Vanguard Total Bond Market Index (VBMFX): An index 
mutual fund that follows the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index.
 
✓ Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities (VIPSX): This mutual 
fund, while technically not an index, largely follows the 
Barclays U.S. TIPS Index of inflation-protected bonds.
 
✓ Vanguard Small Cap Value (VBR): This ETF tracks the value 
companies of the MSCI U.S. Small Cap 1750 Index.
 
✓ iShares Russell 2000 Value Index (IWN): This ETF follows the 
Russell 2000 Value index, an index of small company stocks.
 
✓ iShares Russell 1000 Index (IWB): An ETF that invests in the 
larger company stocks that comprise the Russell 1000 Index.

87
 Chapter 4: Identifying Retirement Investments and Strategies
 
✓ iShares Russell 1000 Value Index (IWD): This ETF follows the 
Russell 1000 Value Index, a larger-cap value index.
 
✓ Vanguard Total Stock Market (VTI): An ETF that invests in 
small, medium, and large U.S. stocks.
 
✓ Vanguard REIT (VNQ): This ETF follows the MSCI U.S. REIT 
Index, which invests in real estate investment trusts.
 
✓ Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US (VEU): An ETF that invests 
globally per the FTSE All-Word ex-US Index, which includes 
about 2,200 stocks of companies in 46 countries, from both 
developed and emerging markets around the world.
 
✓ Vanguard Total International Index (VGTSX): This index 
mutual fund tracks the MSCI EAFE Index and the Select 
Emerging Markets Index.
 
✓ iShares MSCI EAFE Index (EFA): An ETF that invests to 
replicate the performance of the MSCI EAFE Index.
Assessing and changing 
your portfolio
Although we advocate doing your homework so you can buy and 
hold solid investments for the long haul, we do at times support 
selling when it’s appropriate. If you have investments that seem to 
be doing badly over an extended period of time, try determining 
why they’ve done so poorly and look at making changes to your 
portfolio.
However, when assessing your current holdings be careful that 
you don’t dump a particular investment just because it’s in a 
temporary slump. Even the best investment managers have periods 
as long as a year or two during which they underperform. 
Sometimes this happens when the manager’s style of investing 
is temporarily out of favor. But remember, our definition of 
“temporary” isn’t measured in days or months; instead, we mean 
one to two years.

88
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
 
A useful way to evaluate your portfolio once a year or once every 
few years is to imagine that everything that you currently own is 
sold. Ask yourself whether you’d choose to go out and buy the 
same investments today that you were holding. This is an especially 
good question to ask yourself if you own lots of stock in the 
company you work for. Determine whether your reasons still are 
valid for holding your investments.
 
When you find something inherently wrong with an investment, 
such as high fees or sub-par management, take the loss and make 
doing so more palatable by remembering the following:
 
✓ Losses can help reduce your income taxes. You can see 
immediate tax relief/reduction for nonretirement losses.
 
✓ Consider opportunity cost. Consider what kind of future 
return that money could be providing you with if you switched 
into a better investment.
As you manage your portfolio:
 
✓ Don’t become attached to your investments. Over the years, 
Eric has worked with many clients who have difficulty being 
objective with and letting go of investments. Just as we get 
attached to people, places, and things, some investors’ 
judgments may be clouded due to attachment to an investment. 
Even if an investor makes the decision to sell an investment 
based on a sound and practical assessment, their attachment 
to it can derail the process, causing them to refuse to part 
with it at the current fair market value. Attachment can be 
especially problematic and paralyzing with inherited assets.
 
✓ Don’t let inertia become a problem for you. It wasn’t unusual 
for Eric to work with clients who have accumulated tens or 
hundreds of thousands of dollars in checking accounts. Folks 
who amassed their savings from work income were often 
fearful of selecting an investment that may fall in value. These 
people knew how long and hard they had to work for their 
money, and they didn’t want to lose any of it.

O
ne of the virtues and drawbacks of living in the United States 
is that you have plenty of choices . . . sometimes too many. 
And, that’s certainly the case with the numerous types of retirement 
accounts and variety of investments; far more options exist here 
than in just about any other country in the world.
With so many choices you may be confused about which option is 
best for you. Selecting the best ones is important because you can 
end up saving yourself more tax dollars and making more after-tax 
money in the long run. And whether you’re entering retirement or 
still a decade (or more) away, you need to understand the nuances 
and rules of each type of account so you can not only make good 
decisions but also comply with the myriad tax rules.
In this chapter, we discuss the common types of retirement 
accounts to which you may contribute. We also discuss early 
withdrawal penalties, beneficiary decisions, transfer and rollover 
rules, and borrowing from or against retirement accounts.

90
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
Eyeing the Characteristics 
of Retirement Accounts
Before you can use retirement accounts to your benefit, you first 
need to know the 4-1-1 on these accounts, including the advantages 
to using them and the potential drawbacks. We lay out these pros 
and cons in the following sections. Keep this important information 
in mind as you consider the different types of retirement accounts 
available. (We discuss your options in the section, “Identifying the 
Different Types of Retirement Accounts” later in this chapter.)
Focusing on the tax benefits
The main attraction of any retirement account is the tax savings 
it provides. You generally receive upfront tax breaks on your 
contributions up to a certain limit. For example, suppose you’re 
able to contribute $1,000 per month ($12,000 per year) into a tax-
deductible retirement savings plan. Assuming that between federal 
and state taxes you’re paying about 35 percent in taxes on your 
last dollars of income, you should see your federal and state tax 
bills decrease by about $4,200 ($12,000 × 0.35). This immediate 
savings is usually enough of an incentive to encourage folks to 
build wealth by funding retirement accounts.
Because the money contributed to the retirement account isn’t 
taxed at the federal or the state level in the years in which the con-
tributions are made, your take-home pay shrinks by much less than 
the $1,000-per-month contribution. Unfortunately, directing money 
into retirement accounts doesn’t allow you to avoid current Social 
Security and Medicare taxes on wages you earn during the year.
 
These upfront tax breaks are just part of the value derived 
from using retirement accounts. You also can reap these other 
tax-related benefits when you invest in a retirement plan:

91
 Chapter 5: Grasping Retirement Accounts and Their Rules
 
✓ Your investment returns accumulate without taxation. 
After you contribute money into a retirement account, any 
accumulated investment returns aren’t taxed in the year 
earned. So, in addition to reducing your taxes when you make 
your contribution, you save from this tax-deferred compounding 
of your investment over time. In other words, all the taxes you 
would have owed over the years compound in your account 
and make your money grow faster. You pay tax on this 
retirement account money only when you make withdrawals.
 
✓ When you invest, Uncle Sam ends up with less of your 
money. If you don’t invest money in a retirement account, you 
start with less dinero in your pocket because Uncle Sam and 
your state’s government immediately siphon off some taxes. 
The longer the money is invested, the more you profit by 
investing inside a retirement account.
 
Some people are concerned that if their tax rate in retirement 
is higher than it is during their working and saving years, then 
funding retirement accounts could lead to higher taxes. Although 
this scenario is possible, it’s unlikely. Because of the tax-deferred 
compounding, you should come out ahead by funding your 
retirement accounts. In fact, your retirement tax rate could 
increase and you’d still come out ahead.
Income tax rates need to rise significantly from current levels 
to eliminate the tax-deferral benefits. Even though income tax 
rates for some individuals may rise in the future, the benefits of 
tax-deferred contributions and investment income should outweigh 
the increased tax burden you may face when these funds are 
withdrawn. For example, say your tax rate at the time of contribution 
is 35 percent. Table 5-1 shows how high your tax rate would need 
to increase to wipe out all your tax-deferral benefits over the 
years.

92
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
Table 5-1 
Retirement Tax Rates that Would 
 
Negate Tax-Deferral Benefits

Compounds

56 percent
20
61 percent
25
66 percent
30
70 percent
35
74 percent
40
77 percent
As you can see from the table, the longer your money is invested, 
the higher your tax rate would have to rise to wipe out the tax-
deferred compounding benefits. After the money is in the account 
for 30 years, your tax rate would have to double (from 35 percent 
to 70 percent) to eliminate the tax-deferred compounding benefits.
 
If your employer matches your contributions or contributes addi-
tional money to your account, such as with a company-sponsored 
401(k) plan, you’ll be even better off. Free employer money further 
enhances the upfront tax benefits by giving you more money 
working for you. Even if you unexpectedly need to withdraw your 
contribution, you should still come out ahead — the penalties for 
early withdrawal are only 10 percent and whatever penalty, if any, 
your state charges. You’ll also owe regular federal and state income 
tax on withdrawals. (Check out the next section for more detail 
about possible penalties.)
Being aware of restrictions 
and penalties
Some people contribute little or no money to retirement accounts 
because of worries about having access to their funds. Although 
investing your money in a retirement account may limit your 
access to the money in the short term, overall the investment is a 
smart move for your retirement in the long run.

93
 Chapter 5: Grasping Retirement Accounts and Their Rules
 
If you do have to withdraw your money from a retirement account 
prior to reaching 591⁄2, you may incur a tax penalty. The penalty is 
10 percent in federal taxes plus whatever penalty your state 
assesses. This penalty tax is in addition to the regular income tax 
that’s due in the year you make the early withdrawal.
 
Some exceptions do allow you to withdraw retirement account 
money before age 591⁄2 without penalty (though you’ll still owe 
income taxes):
 
✓ Five years of withdrawals: You may withdraw retirement 
account money early as long as you make withdrawals for 
at least five consecutive years or until age 591⁄2, whichever is 
greater. The withdrawals must be substantially equal each 
year and be based on your life expectancy according to 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assumptions and reasonable 
interest rates. IRS rulings provide details for computing the 
annual distributions.
 
✓ Health problems: If you suffer a disability or incur significant 
medical expenses, you may be allowed to withdraw money 
early from your retirement account without penalty. See IRS 
publication 590 for more information.
 
✓ Borrowing: Your employer’s retirement plan may allow you 
to borrow from your plan without incurring a penalty. We 
generally aren’t fans of doing this, especially if you seek the 
money for current spending, such as buying furniture, taking 
a vacation, and so on. It can make sense, for example, if you 
need some down payment money to buy a home. But, be sure 
that you understand the repayment rules and terms, because 
if you’re unable to repay the loan, the unpaid money is treated 
as a retirement account withdrawal and subject to current 
federal and state income taxes as well as penalties unless you 
withdrew the money after age 591⁄2.
 
The best solution for short-term money needs is to ensure that 
you maintain an emergency reserve of money (three to six months’ 
worth of living expenses) outside your retirement account. If you 
don’t have an emergency reserve account, you may be able to 
borrow money from other sources, such as a family member or 
through a line of credit or lower-interest credit card.

Identifying the Different Types 
of Retirement Accounts
Different employers and employment situations present unique 
retirement account options. In this section, we explain the 
common retirement accounts you’ll confront and how they work.
Employer-sponsored retirement 
accounts
When you work for a company or organization, you may have 
access to an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan. In this 
case, the company provides access to an investment firm through 
which you can contribute money via payroll deductions. Plans 
have rules specifying, for example, how long after becoming an 
employee you must wait to begin participating in the plan, company 
matching contributions, and the overall limits of how much you 
may contribute to your account.
The good news with this type of plan is that your employer has 
done the legwork and maintenance for the plan. The potential bad 
news is that you’re at their mercy if they don’t have a good plan.
For-profit companies may offer 401(k) plans. Nonprofit organizations 
can offer 403(b) plans. Government employees may have their own 
plans such as a 457 plan for state and local government workers 
and the Thrift Savings Plan for federal government employees. 
These plans are similar in that contributions into them from your 
employment earnings aren’t taxed at either the federal or state 
level.
 
For tax year 2010, the annual contribution limits for these retirement 
accounts are the lesser of 20 percent of an employee’s salary to a 
maximum of $16,500. If you’re 50 or older, your contribution limit is 
$22,000.

95
 Chapter 5: Grasping Retirement Accounts and Their Rules
Self-employed retirement 
savings plans
Another type of retirement plan is the self-employed retirement 
savings plan. One of the biggest benefits of earning self-employment 
income is the ability to establish a tax-sheltered retirement savings 
plan. These plans not only allow you to contribute more than you 
likely would be saving on a tax-deferred basis for an employer, but 
they also can be tailored to meet your specific needs.
As with other retirement savings plans, your contributions to 
self-employed savings plans are excluded from your reported 
income and are thus exempt from current federal and state income 
taxes. The earnings that accumulate on your savings over time 
also are exempt from current income taxes. You pay taxes on your 
contributions and earnings when you withdraw them, presumably 
in retirement, which is when you’re likely in a lower tax bracket.
A couple different versions of self-employed retirement plans are 
available. The following list explains which plan may be right for you:
 
✓ Keogh plan: This type of retirement plan is of potential interest 
to business owners who have employees to be covered 
by a plan, because you may be able to contribute more to 
your account relative to contributions for your employees’ 
accounts. Speak with a tax advisor or an investment manage-
ment company for more information.
 
 You must establish a Keogh plan by the end of the tax year 
(usually December 31), but you have until the filing of your 
federal tax return to make your actual contribution to the plan.
 
 The drawback to a Keogh plan is that it requires slightly more 
paperwork than a SEP-IRA plan to set up and administer. 
However, the no-load mutual fund “prototype” plans simplify 
the administrative burden by providing fill-in-the-blank forms.
 
✓ A Simplified Employee Pension Plan, Individual Retirement 
Account (SEP-IRA): This type of plan cuts through much of a 
Keogh plan’s red tape and is somewhat easier to set up and 
administer. Remember: As with a Keogh plan, when you as the 
employer establish a SEP, you must offer this as a benefit to 
employees if you have them.

96
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
With both of these plans, you may contribute up to the lesser of 20 
percent of your self-employment income to a maximum of $49,000 
for tax year 2010. In order to determine the exact maximum amount 
that you may contribute from self-employed income, you need to 
have your completed Schedule C tax form so you know your 
business’s net income for the year. To find out more about setting 
up these types of accounts, see the nearby sidebar “Establishing 
and transferring retirement accounts.”
Individual Retirement 
Accounts (IRAs)
What if you work for an employer that doesn’t offer a retirement 
savings plan? You can certainly lobby your employer to offer a 
plan, especially if it’s a nonprofit, because little cost is involved. 
Absent that, you can consider contributing to an Individual 
Retirement Account, or IRA. You may contribute up to $5,000 per 
year as long as you have at least this much employment (or alimony) 
income. Those folks who are age 50 and older may contribute up 
to $6,000 annually.
 
Whether you can deduct your IRA contribution from your annual 
taxes depends on whether you participate in another plan through 
your employer. If you do and your adjusted gross income, or AGI, 
on your tax return exceeds $56,000 if you file as a single person or 
$89,000 if you’re married filing jointly, the tax deductibility of your 
IRA is reduced or eliminated.
 
If you can’t take the tax deduction for a regular IRA, consider the 
newer Roth IRAs, which allow for tax-free withdrawal of investment 
earnings in your later years. For tax year 2010, you may contribute 
up to maximum limits, which are the same as on a regular IRA, 
so long as your modified adjusted gross income doesn’t exceed 
$105,000 if you’re a single taxpayer or $167,000 for married couples 
filing jointly.

 Chapter 5: Grasping Retirement Accounts and Their Rules
Rolling Over Retirement Balances
One of the most important decisions you’ll make with your 
retirement accounts is what to do with your money in your 
accounts when you retire. Make the right choice and do the 
transaction properly, and your after-tax retirement income will be 
greatly increased. Make a mistake, and you’ll pay far more taxes 
than you need to.
Establishing and transferring 
retirement accounts
Retirement accounts that you establish, 
such as a SEP-IRA or Keogh (if you’re 
self-employed) and Individual Retirement 
Accounts (IRAs), can be set up through 
mutual fund companies, brokerage firms, 
and other financial firms. You choose 
what investments you’d like in these 
accounts. You also can transfer these 
accounts to different firms. Simply call 
the company that you want to move your 
account into and ask them to send you 
their account application and transfer 
forms. You may be able to do this online 
at the firm’s Web site. (See our recom-
mended investment companies and 
funds in Chapter 4.)
For retirement accounts that your 
employer maintains, such as a 401(k) 
plan, you’re limited to the investment 
options that the plan offers. When you 
leave this employer, you can elect to roll 
over your account balance into an IRA. 
Simply contact the investment company 
that you’d like to use for the IRA, and 
ask them to send you their account 
application forms (or complete them on 
the firm’s Web site). Then instruct your 
previous employer on the name and 
contact information for your chosen 
investment company where you’d like 
your money sent. Don’t take possession 
of your money from the 401(k); otherwise 
you’ll get hit with a 20 percent federal 
income tax withholding. For more help 
with investing, see the latest edition of 
Eric’s book, Investing For Dummies.

98
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
The most common rollover is from a 401(k) plan to an IRA. There 
are other types of rollovers, however. Money can be moved from 
one 401(k) to another, from one IRA to another, and from a defined 
benefit pension plan to an IRA, to give three common examples. 
But the 401(k)-to-IRA rollover is the most common and probably 
the most important. In this section, as an example, we focus on 
the important (and common) decision of how to handle a 401(k) 
account balance when leaving an employer.
Deciding what road to take
You should begin planning what to do with your 401(k) account 
balance well before you leave the sponsoring employer to ensure 
that you have sufficient time to research and get comfortable with 
what you’re going to do with your money. Too many people make 
their plans for travel and other activities for the first six months of 
retirement, but then they give no thought to what to do with their 
401(k) balances until presented with their options as they’re leaving 
the job.
Most 401(k) plans offer several options for handling an account 
balance when you leave your employer. Here, we discuss those 
options and the issues to consider for each one:
 
✓ Leave the balance in the plan until distributions begin. This 
option can be a good idea when you like the plan because of 
its investment options, low costs, or other features. The plan 
also may allow you to take loans from the account, which 
could make the plan a source of emergency cash.
 
 However, depending on your circumstances, you may not 
want to leave your money in the plan for several reasons. For 
example, you will have more investment options by rolling the 
balance into an IRA. In addition, the employer could increase 
fees and change plan offerings between the time you quit 
and the day you begin receiving distributions. As a former 
employee, you’ll be out of the information loop and may learn 
about important changes long after current employees. Due to 
rules and restrictions, most 401(k) plans also are less flexible 
about post-retirement distributions than IRAs.

99
 Chapter 5: Grasping Retirement Accounts and Their Rules
 
✓ Look into annuity options. The plan may offer an annuity 
option, making fixed, guaranteed payments to you for life 
or for a period of years, which can be attractive. Look at all 
your options though; you may find higher payments available 
through commercial annuities purchased through an IRA. (For 
more on annuities, check out Chapter 7.)
 
 When your employer offers an attractive annuity but you 
don’t want the entire account turned into an annuity, you can 
purchase the annuity with part of the account. The annuity 
portion can be distributed directly to you, and then taxes are 
paid only as annuity payments are received. The rest of the 
account can be rolled over to an IRA.
 
✓ Take the account balance in a lump sum payment. The entire 
lump sum would be included in gross income, but the tax law 
provides a special ten-year income averaging treatment that 
reduces the tax. You may choose this option when you need 
or anticipate needing the cash to pay expenses within a few 
years. Otherwise, you probably should take advantage of tax 
deferral by leaving the balance in the 401(k) plan or rolling it 
over to an IRA.
 
✓ Roll over the balance to an IRA. A rollover basically is taking 
the money from the 401(k) account and moving it to an IRA. 
The rollover transfers the account to the broker or mutual 
fund company of your choice for the best combination of fees, 
investment choices, and other services.
Choosing a custodian and rolling 
over your balance to an IRA
After deciding that you want to roll over your 401(k) balance to an 
IRA, determine who will be the IRA custodian. The custodian is a 
broker, mutual fund firm, bank, insurance company, or other 
financial services company that offers IRAs. When considering 
which custodian to choose, consider the following (check out 
Chapter 4 for more details):

100
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
 
✓ Research the fees, services, and investment options. Look for 
an IRA custodian that has the features and services you desire. 
You should have an idea of how the account will be invested 
initially and which types of investments are most important 
to you.
 
✓ Decide how you will transact most of your business. Do you 
prefer talking on the telephone? Doing transactions in person? 
Mailing information? Or using the Web? Most large custodians 
offer all these options but smaller ones may not.
After you select your custodian, you basically have two ways to 
rollover a retirement account balance:
 
✓ Option 1: The trustee for your employer’s plan can issue a 
check to you or make a direct deposit into your bank account. 
You have 60 days to deposit the check (or an equivalent 
amount) into an IRA or other qualified retirement plan. If you 
fail to make the transfer within 60 days, you’ll owe income 
taxes; and if you’re under age 591⁄2, you may owe a 10 percent 
early distribution penalty.
 
 This type of rollover has a trick. When the check is made out 
to you, the trustee must withhold 20 percent of the account 
balance for income taxes. The taxes will be refunded to you 
after you file your tax return and show that you rolled over the 
account balance within 60 days. But you must deposit in the 
IRA the entire 401(k) account balance, not only the amount 
distributed to you. As a result, you must come up with an 
amount equal to the 20 percent that was withheld and roll that 
into the IRA along with the amount that was distributed.
 
✓ Option 2: The other form of rollover is the trustee-to-trustee 
transfer. The 20 percent withholding isn’t required when the 
distribution check is made payable to a specific IRA custodian 
instead of to you.
 
 Here’s how this easy transaction works:
 
1. You open an IRA with the custodian of your choice.

101
 Chapter 5: Grasping Retirement Accounts and Their Rules
 
2. You complete a rollover form giving the details of the 
account you want the balance rolled over from.
 
3. The IRA custodian contacts the trustee of your 401(k) 
plan and ensures that the 401(k) trustee transfers your 
account balance to the custodian.
 
 This method is the easier and safer way to roll over your IRA, 
because it avoids the possibility of missing the 60-day deadline 
of the other method. All you have to do is be sure the 401(k) 
balance is transferred to your IRA. Sometimes a mistake is 
made and the transfer is made to a taxable account instead of 
an IRA. If this isn’t corrected promptly, you will owe income 
tax on the entire amount.
Why would anyone choose Option 1 when they can avoid the 
hassle of rounding up the extra cash by choosing Option 2? Some 
employees choose inferior Option 1 because they don’t know 
better and their employers don’t warn them before issuing the 
check. You’ve now been informed and won’t make that mistake!
 
No matter which of the preceding options you choose, to be tax 
free, a rollover must qualify as a lump sum, which means that the 
entire account must be distributed within the same calendar year. 
Sometimes a rollover doesn’t qualify as a lump sum because some 
late dividends or other distributions aren’t distributed until after 
December 31. In addition, the employee must be either separated 
from service of the employer (in other words, no longer working for 
the employer) or over age 591⁄2.
 
If your 401(k) account contains employer stock, don’t transfer the 
entire account to an IRA. Doing so causes you to lose a valuable 
tax benefit. When the employer stock is distributed to a taxable 
account, taxes are generally deferred on it until the stock is sold 
from that account. In this situation, you maximize tax benefits 
by splitting off the employer stock from the retirement account. 
Have the employer stock distributed to a taxable (nonretirement) 
account and the rest of the account rolled over to an IRA.

102
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
Choosing Beneficiaries for 
Your Retirement Accounts
When you create a retirement account, you need to make sure 
you select the beneficiaries who receive the proceeds. Your will 
doesn’t determine who inherits your IRA and other qualified 
retirement plans. The account is inherited by whoever is named 
beneficiary on the beneficiary designation form on file with the 
plan custodian or trustee.
When choosing your beneficiary, take the time to select the person 
(or persons) you want to receive your money. Oftentimes people 
don’t give much thought to this important designation. Most folks 
simply write down an obvious beneficiary when they open the 
account and don’t give much thought to it again. In the meantime, 
they may have been married or divorced, or had children or 
grandchildren. The account probably has grown into a significant 
asset over time, yet the beneficiary choice hasn’t been reconsidered 
through all these changes.
 
You need to give some thought to your beneficiary choice as part 
of your overall estate plan, and you must review that choice every 
couple of years. Here are some guidelines to follow:
 
✓ Take care of your spouse first. Retirement accounts are a 
significant part of most estates. Married people whose priorities 
are taking care of their spouses name their spouses as the 
primary or sole beneficiaries of their accounts. Of course, you 
also should name contingent beneficiaries (those who get the 
account if the primary beneficiary has passed away) in case 
your spouse doesn’t survive you or passes away while assets 
are still in the IRA. For most people, the contingent beneficiaries 
are their children in equal shares. But you can name other 
contingent beneficiaries, such as other relatives or friends.
 
✓ Be careful about naming a trust. A trust is an arrangement in 
which a trustee manages property for the benefit of someone 
else. You may want to name a trust as beneficiary to ensure 

103
 Chapter 5: Grasping Retirement Accounts and Their Rules
that, for example, your sibling who knows something about 
investing manages the IRA until your teenagers are older. A 
trustee also can control how much is distributed. A trust also 
allows you to control who receives the amount left after the 
initial beneficiary passes away. However, you have the potential 
of losing the tax deferral for the IRA if the beneficiary isn’t a 
natural person. Certain types of trusts carry a limited exception 
to this rule about natural persons. In this case, however, the 
trust must be carefully written by an experienced estate 
planner to avoid losing the tax deferral.
 
✓ Consider splitting your IRA. When you have children but no 
surviving spouse (or your spouse will have significant non-IRA 
assets), your children likely will be named equal beneficiaries of 
your IRA. When children inherit IRA funds, annual distributions 
are required based on the life expectancy of the oldest 
beneficiary. The children also must agree on investments and 
distributions that exceed the minimum required distributions.
 
 Your children have the right to split the IRA into separate IRAs 
for each of them. You may want to split the IRA now instead 
of waiting for the kids to work things out. This split gives you 
more control over the amount of assets each child inherits. It 
also allows you to name different contingent beneficiaries for 
each IRA. If you want a trust to control the inheritance of only 
one beneficiary, splitting the IRA makes this easier. Otherwise, 
the other beneficiaries have to coordinate their management 
of the IRA with the trustee.
 
✓ Make charitable gifts with the IRA. All your beneficiaries 
could receive more after-tax wealth when charitable gifts are 
made with the IRA and other heirs inherit other assets. We 
discuss this in detail in Chapter 15.
 
Don’t name your estate as a beneficiary. A natural person must be 
beneficiary in order for the IRA to retain its tax deferral. Name 
your estate as beneficiary, and the IRA must be distributed on an 
accelerated schedule. Also, don’t fail to name a beneficiary; 
otherwise your estate will be considered the beneficiary.

104
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
Taking Required Minimum 
Distributions, or RMDs
The main purpose of investing in an IRA or other qualified retirement 
plan is to help you financially during your retirement years. As a 
result (and because he wants to collect taxes), Uncle Sam requires 
that you start taking distributions at a certain age. You must begin 
annual required minimum distributions (RMDs) from IRAs and other 
qualified retirement plans by April 1 of the year after you turn 
age 701⁄2.
The following sections help you calculate your RMD with an IRA 
and with other types of retirement accounts.
 
The RMD is a floor, not a ceiling. You’re free to withdraw as much 
in excess of the RMD as you want. An excess distribution doesn’t 
result in any credit the following year. The adjustment is automatic 
because the next year’s RMD is computed using the account balance 
as of the end of the current year.
Calculating your RMD for an IRA
To calculate your RMD, you can do the following:
 
1. Start with your IRA balance as of December 31 of the year 
before you turn 701⁄2.
 
2. Divide this amount by your life expectancy.
 
 The result of dividing your IRA balance by your life expectancy 
is your RMD for the year. The good news is you don’t have to 
do the math regarding your life expectancy. Instead you must 
consult the life expectancy tables in IRS Publication 590 (avail-
able free at www.irs.gov). Most people use the “Uniform 
Lifetime Table.”
 
 You use a different life expectancy table, the “Joint Life and 
Last Survivor Expectancy Table” if you’re a married IRA owner 
whose spouse is the primary beneficiary of the IRA and is 
more than ten years younger.

105
 Chapter 5: Grasping Retirement Accounts and Their Rules
 
3. Repeat the calculation each year.
 
 For the first RMD, use the IRA balance as of December 31 of 
the year before you turned 701⁄2, not the year before the April 
1 deadline. The first RMD, though delayed until April 1 of the 
year after turning 701⁄2, really is the RMD for the previous year. 
If you wait until April 1 to take the distribution, you’ll have to 
take two distributions in that year: the previous year’s dis-
tribution, and the current year’s distribution that’s due by 
December 31. Taking two distributions in one year could push 
you into a higher tax bracket. Overall taxes may be lower if the 
first distribution is taken by December 31 of the year you turn 
age 701⁄2.
 
 So, for example, if Rick turned 701⁄2 in January 2009 and Corrine 
turned 701⁄2 in December 2009, each must take his or her first 
RMD by April 1, 2010. Subsequent RMDs must be taken by 
December 31 of each year. If you fail to take an RMD, the 
penalty is 50 percent of the distribution that should have been 
taken. Ouch!
When you own more than one IRA, add all the balances together as 
one to compute the RMD. You can withdraw that amount from the 
IRAs in any combination you want. Take it all from one account, 
equally from the different accounts, or in any other way you want. 
Just be sure that by December 31 your distributions equal (or 
exceed) the RMD.
 
If a traditional IRA is converted into a Roth IRA, a new RMD is 
required for the year of the conversion, using the traditional IRA 
balance as of December 31 of the preceding year. A new RMD also 
is required for the year of the IRA owner’s death, no matter when 
during the year that occurred.
Computing the RMD for 
other retirement plans
All qualified retirement plans — profit-sharing, 401(k), and pension 
plans — must make RMDs. The basic calculation is the same as 
for IRAs, but there are some important differences with employer 
plans.

106
Part I: Working toward Retirement 
For employer-sponsored plans (but not for IRAs, SEP-IRAs, and 
SIMPLE IRAs), the required beginning date is delayed when you’re 
still working for the employer and don’t own more than 5 percent 
of the employer’s stock. The first RMD is delayed until April 1 of the 
year after the year in which you retire. Also, for money contributed 
to a 403(b) plan before 1987, RMDs may be delayed until age 75.
 
The calculations for employer plans can be a bit different from IRA 
calculations. For instance, when you have multiple employer plans, 
such as a profit-sharing plan and a 401(k) plan, you compute the 
RMDs separately for each plan instead of totaling them. Check IRS 
Publication 590 for details (see www.irs.gov).
 
An employer-sponsored plan can impose stricter rules than the 
IRS imposes. For example, some employer plans require retired 
employees to withdraw or roll over their account balances within 
five years. They may have other stringent restrictions as well. 
These rules are in the documents describing the employer plan. 
You’re supposed to receive these periodically and can request 
them at any time from your employer or plan trustee.

B
y the time most people reach their retirement years, they’ve 
been managing money for several decades. That’s a good 
thing. Between the knowledge acquired over time and the valuable 
lessons learned in the school of hard knocks, people enter retirement 
a lot wiser and more money savvy than they were as young adults.
Making the most of your senior years and your money requires 
you to plan ahead and be prepared for some surprises. At the 
same time, you can learn from others’ experiences and put many 
worries to rest. This chapter looks at some potential fears you 
may have about entering retirement and helps you manage your 
expenses and spending throughout your retirement to make the 
transition as easy as possible.
Pointing Out Some Retirement 
Worries You May Have
What are the worries and fears of retirees and senior citizens? 
Thanks to research and studies, we know what folks are concerned 
about, and we discuss everything you need to know in this section. 

110
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
Knowing this information helps you plan ahead and prepare. The 
challenge for most people is this: Retirement is financially unlike 
any other period in their lives because retirees generally are
 
✓ Working less (or not at all): Retirees have more free time in 
which to spend money and less earned income coming their 
way. If you do decide to work during retirement, check out 
Chapter 18.
 
✓ Living off investments and monthly benefit checks: During 
most wage earners’ working years, their income exceeds their 
spending, and psychologically they get used to that. For many 
retirees, on the other hand, spending exceeds income.
 
✓ Using more medical services: Retirees use more medical 
services even if they have comparably good health within 
their peer group. They need more medical tests, spend more 
on prescription and over-the-counter drugs, and have more 
medical problems.
Many seniors and near-seniors we speak with understand these sea 
changes, which is why they worry about money and other retirement 
issues. Many fears revolve around concerns about running out of 
money. In the following sections, we discuss these specific anxieties, 
why they exist, and what you can do to address them.
Running out of money
In Eric’s prior work with near retirees and retirees, one worry far 
exceeded all others among the folks he worked with: The fear of 
running out of money. Even people who possessed what seemed 
like to most folks plenty of money worried about having enough. 
Later in this section we enumerate the sources of this fear and give 
you our take on what you can do about it.
 
One way some seniors deal with the problem of running out of 
money is that they continue to work during retirement. You may 
need to make some slight adjustments and work part-time during 
retirement or even start a small business to help make ends meet. 
Check out Chapter 18 for more info about working during retirement.

111
 Chapter 6: Managing Budgets and Expenses
Supporting others
For sure, plenty of seniors are concerned about making ends meet 
for the duration of their retirement. But, seniors aren’t egocentrically 
focused on their own finances. In fact, to the contrary. They’re also 
concerned about other family members that they’re taking care of 
financially. More than four in ten (44 percent) retired Americans 
support one or more people living outside their home. Among 
those receiving support are
 
✓ Adult children (53 percent)
 
✓ Grandchildren (37 percent)
 
✓ Elderly parents (12 percent)
Before hitting retirement, plenty of near-seniors get “sandwiched” 
providing for their own children and helping their aging parents. 
How can near-seniors who then end up retiring accomplish all of 
this? In Eric’s previous work as a financial counselor, he saw 
firsthand how and why folks manage. Consider the following 
reasons (and try applying them to your own life if you’re in a 
pickle and being sandwiched):
 
✓ They continue to be frugal. Folks who saved and invested 
during their working years generally continue their frugality 
in retirement. As Eric witnessed with his clients, the best 
savers often have trouble learning to live off their money in 
retirement. In those types of cases, he had to prod retirees to 
understand that it was okay to spend a little more!
 
✓ They have a desire to help loved ones. Most seniors adore 
their offspring (not always and not all the time, of course)! And 
nothing makes most seniors happier than helping their kids, 
grandkids, and extended families. Sometimes you also have 
to help your aging parents (check out Chapter 19 for more 
information).
 
✓ They have fears about outliving their available funds and 
becoming a burden to others. There’s great uncertainty about 
how long any one person or couple will live as well as what 
will happen to their personal health. So most people assume 

112
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
that they’ll live longer and perhaps need extensive medical 
care later in life, and as a result they keep more money saved. 
However, retirees often overlook the fact that Social Security 
and monthly pensions keep paying benefits as long as you live. 
Money left invested also will continue compounding and 
growing over the long-term — so long as it’s invested intelligently 
(see Chapter 7 for details).
 
✓ They spend less on many things later in retirement. 
Qualitatively, as soon as folks cut back on work, they spend 
a lot less on work-related expenses — from clothing to 
commuting to buying fewer services — compared with when 
they had far greater demands on their time. Even among active 
seniors, as mobility is reduced later in retirement, travel and 
shopping also are reduced. Yes, people may spend more on 
some things (like health care) as they age, but in general, they 
spend less, which leads to folks having more of their money 
last longer than they may have guessed. Check out “How 
Spending Really Changes in Retirement” later in this chapter 
for the specifics of retiree spending patterns and behavior.
 
✓ They live in a wealthy country with an economic bounty. 
Notwithstanding the severe recession of the late 2000s and the 
associated financial market turmoil, America is still a wealthy 
nation and provides a relatively high standard of living for the 
vast majority of people. Yes, in the years and decades ahead, 
the United States will likely be sharing its economic superpower 
status with some other emerging, higher-growth economies, 
but its economy should continue to grow.
Addressing your worries
Dr. Frank Luntz, author of What Americans Really Want . . . Really 
(Hyperion), is a prolific pollster and focus group organizer who 
has studied retirees through focus groups and research surveys. He 
developed a list of “The Seven Most Frequently Asked Questions 
About Retirement” by people age 60 and older. As we introduce 
the questions, we include explanations on how to address your 
worries and feel better about each of them.

113
 Chapter 6: Managing Budgets and Expenses
The first six of these seven items deal with a senior’s ability to 
manage his cash flow and match up his income to his expenses. 
And the last item on the list — concerning maintaining independence 
and mobility — is partly related to income and expenses, too. Here 
are Dr. Luntz’s questions, along with our explanations:
 
✓ Will I be able to afford health care when I get too old to 
work? Am I one medical emergency away from bankruptcy 
and ruin? Yes, you should be able to afford health care in 
retirement, and, no, a medical emergency or major illness 
doesn’t have to bankrupt you. As we discuss in Chapter 11, 
Medicare is a pretty comprehensive major medical insurance 
plan that can include prescription drug coverage. You also can 
buy long-term care insurance, which we discuss in Chapter 9, 
and a Medicare supplement.
 
✓ Is Social Security going to be there for me? Yes, it should be. 
We discuss this worry at length in Chapter 10, and show you 
why you shouldn’t be worried about it.
 
✓ Will prescription drugs be so expensive that I’ll be forced to 
choose between medications and food? No. The vast majority 
of prescription drugs have been in the market for many years 
and have competition from generics, which keeps costs down. 
You also can purchase prescription drug coverage through 
Medicare (see Chapter 11).
 
✓ Will I run out of money before I run out of years? No. Social 
Security benefits, which increase annually with inflation, 
continue for your life. The same is true for company pension 
benefits, if you elected the lifetime payment option. To ensure 
that your invested dollars stretch for as long as possible, be 
sure to follow our investing advice in Chapters 4 and 7. Finally, 
if you’re a homeowner, equity in your home provides another 
financial safety net in case you need additional resources later 
in your retirement.
 
✓ Will I be a financial and physical burden on my spouse or 
my children? Will I lose my independence and mobility? 
These last two questions are the hardest to answer and 
address. As we discuss in our answers to the first five 

114
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
questions, financially, you should be fine in the long term with 
the advice provided in this book. However, you can’t predict 
your health. As you age later in your elderly years, you’ll 
experience an inevitable reduction in mobility and ability to 
do some things you’ve historically been able to do. You can 
make the most of your health for as many years as possible 
by taking sensible steps to maintain your good health. See 
Chapter 2 for details.
Spending Your Nest Egg
A day will come when you have to consider how much of your 
retirement nest egg you can spend each year. For some retirees, 
that day happens right when they retire; for others it occurs years 
into retirement. And for a small minority, they actually never tap 
into their nest egg in retirement. The following sections discuss 
important considerations as you decide when and how to spend 
your nest egg.
Considering the 4 percent rule
The vast majority of retirees need to live off at least a portion of 
their investment portfolio’s returns. If you’re in this majority, a 
logical concern you may have is determining how much of your 
portfolio and its returns you can use each year, while still having 
some reasonable expectation that your portfolio will last throughout 
your retirement. That’s where the 4 percent rule comes into play.
 
Analyses and studies have found that if you withdraw about 4 percent 
of your nest egg in the first year of retirement and then bump that 
amount up by a few percent per year for increases in the cost of 
living, your portfolio should last at least 30 years.
Here’s an example to illustrate: Suppose you retire with about 
$500,000 invested in a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds. The 
4 percent rule would suggest that you plan on taking about $20,000 
from this retirement nest egg in your first year of retirement. If you 
assume a 3 percent rate of inflation, in the second year you would 
take $20,600.

115
 Chapter 6: Managing Budgets and Expenses
Naming the factors affecting 
your use of retirement assets
In the preceding section, we explain that 4 percent withdrawals are 
a starting point to consider for typical folks planning retirement and 
expecting to maintain a balanced portfolio. However, 4 percent may 
not be the ideal number for you based on the amount of money 
you have in savings. For example, if you want to ensure that your 
money lasts even longer, you could try 3 percent withdrawals 
rather than 4 percent withdrawals.
 Here are some important factors affecting whether you should use 4 
percent or a slightly different number:
 
✓ Actual expenses relative to your income: You may find early 
in your retirement that you don’t need 4 percent from your 
financial assets to make ends meet. This occurs perhaps 
because you still have some employment income coming in 
or your monthly checks from Social Security and pensions are 
sufficient for your spending needs. If that’s the case and you 
can delay tapping into your investment returns or income, 
then by all means do so.
 
 One challenge of planning ahead is that you can’t predict 
unexpectedly large expenses; you only can make intelligent 
guesses. Be sure to see our discussion later in the chapter for 
which types of expenses may give your budget some stress in 
the years ahead.
 
✓ Health and life expectancy: If you come from a family where 
folks routinely live a long time, you want to ensure that your 
money lasts as long as you do. You may have to use an 
investment withdrawal rate of less than 4 percent, such as 3
to 3.5 percent.
 
✓ Investment performance: If you’re an investor who’s less 
willing to be reasonably aggressive with asset allocation (say 
a 50/50 mix between growth investments like stocks and 
real estate and lending investments like bonds), consider 
using a retirement withdrawal figure of less than 4 percent. 
Conversely, if you’re willing to be more aggressive, you could 
use 4.5 to 5 percent. However, be aware of the potential 

116
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
downside of the financial markets producing lower-than-
expected returns over a number of years.
 
✓ Risk tolerance: How comfortable are you with taking risk? If 
you’re a nervous wreck about putting even a small portion of 
your money in something other than bank accounts or Treasury 
bonds, using 4 percent withdrawals is too high a number.
How Spending Really Changes 
in Retirement
Seeing how much other retirees spend can help you plan your own 
retirement better. Our fine federal government actually collects 
and collates consumer spending data that can be sliced and diced 
many ways. With this information, we analyze here how people’s 
spending habits change after age 65, an age by which many people 
retire or are close to retiring.
We noticed that the average number of people in the “consumer 
unit” (household) changes over time. As we were analyzing 
how spending changed in retirement compared with the years 
immediately before retirement, we noted the following changes in 
average household size:
Age
Average Number of People in Household
55–64
2.1
65–74
1.8
75+
1.5
The primary reason for the decline in the average number of 
people in a household after age 65 and 75 is because of the 
passing of an elderly spouse. These figures got us thinking that 
you have to make adjustments for changes in the number of 
people in the household to make better sense of some of the 
numbers. For example, you would expect a smaller number of 
people to eat less food.

117
 Chapter 6: Managing Budgets and Expenses
The first column in Table 6-1 shows the average expenditures 
for households that fall into the 55-to-64-year-old age bracket. Of 
course, these are national averages and may differ greatly from 
how much and where you spend your own money. (Remember: 
Taxes weren’t accurately captured by this survey and thus are 
omitted; though we do discuss them briefly later.)

Here are the highlights of what’s shown in the data from Table 6-1:
 
✓ Overall expenses per person decline significantly as do the 
vast majority of the individual expense categories, which are 
ranked in order of their overall amounts (at ages 55–64).
 
✓ Note how expenses drop even more later in retirement 
(age 75+). This decrease makes sense given that many folks 
downsize their housing and become less mobile. Notice the 
big drops in transportation and entertainment as well.
 
✓ Later in retirement, apparel expenses drop. That’s because 
most older retirees shop less and are more content to wear 
what they have rather than to keep buying more.

118
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
 
✓ Spending on food declines due to eating out less. Spending on 
food consumed at home rises a little.
 
✓ Health care spending per person goes up significantly, which 
is no big surprise.
 
✓ Cash donations went up too, especially at age 75+. From his 
previous counseling work, Eric agrees that this makes sense, 
because as folks with excess money approach the end of their 
lives, they become more interested and motivated to give 
away money to loved ones and favorite charities.
We think it’s also useful to look at the household level changes in 
expenditures (refer to Table 6-2) that aren’t adjusted for changes 
in household size, because they reflect an average or typical 
household’s changes in expenditures over the retirement years.

Consider these highlights from the data in Table 6-2:
 
✓ Large, overall reductions occur in total expenditures and in 
most of the individual expense categories. These reductions 
raise an interesting issue for your planning purposes as a 
couple and consideration of how your individual health and 
expected longevity affects your household’s spending. If both 
you and your spouse have and expect to maintain excellent 

119
 Chapter 6: Managing Budgets and Expenses
health, you should probably use the per person changes in 
spending from Table 6-1.
 
✓ Note the bigger declines in housing expenses. Unlike food 
costs, for example, which are driven by the number of people 
in a consumer unit, housing costs are more fixed, so these 
bigger declines would be more typical of what an average 
retiree experiences. To realize these housing cost reductions 
though, older retirees downsize their homes or take advantage 
of property tax breaks available through many towns and cities.
 
✓ Although taxes weren’t accurately captured in this survey, 
they clearly would have shown a significant reduction in the 
retirement years when most people earn far less income and 
also are paying much less in Social Security and Medicare 
taxes, which applies only to employment earnings.
Managing Your Expenses
Most folks do a decent job managing their expenses in retirement. 
After all, by the time people reach retirement, they have decades of 
experience managing their finances and spending. That said, we’ve 
seen plenty of people make mistakes and worry about things they 
shouldn’t worry about while overlooking issues that they should 
have paid closer attention to. That’s what this section is all about. 
Bigger-picture issues
 
Before we dig into specific expenditures, we want to first discuss 
some overarching retirement spending issues and concerns. Here 
are the important points to keep in mind:
 
✓ After you retire and stop earning employment income, one 
of the cash outflows that should go away is saving more 
money. Some folks early in retirement continue to effectively 
save by not using all the money coming in (for example, from 
Social Security, pensions, and so on). They scrimp and save 
and do without when they don’t need to. If your retirement 
analysis shows that you don’t need to save anymore, then don’t!

120
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
 
✓ Throughout your retirement, you need to consider inflation. 
When you examine your spending now or next year, remember 
that you’re examining a snapshot or point in time. Over the 
years, most (but not all) items increase in price (3 percent per 
year is a good average to use, because that is what consumer 
price inflation in the U.S. has averaged over many years). So 
plan accordingly by considering not just your current spending 
but also your spending in the years and decades ahead.
 
✓ Remain optimistic about your retirement. One study from a 
large accounting firm ominously warned that about 60 percent 
of middle-class retirees would probably run out of money if 
they maintained their pre-retirement lifestyles. Technically 
that may be true, but an important detail the study failed to 
mention is the vast majority of retirees spend less — in some 
cases quite a bit less — when they retire in comparison to 
their pre-retirement spending.
In the sections that follow, we go through important expense 
categories and discuss what typically happens to retirees regarding 
those expenses and offer money-saving opportunities.
Taxes
One fringe benefit of ceasing work and getting over the financial 
impact of losing that income is the associated and often dramatic 
reduction in income taxes — both federal and state — as well as 
in FICA (Social Security and Medicare) taxes and possibly local 
taxes. However, even though you’re retired, some of your taxes 
may actually increase or stay the same. So keep close tabs on the 
following taxes:
 
✓ Taxes on Social Security benefits: One tax issue worth paying 
close attention to in retirement is the triggering of taxes on 
Social Security benefits if your income exceeds particular 
thresholds. You also may get socked with higher taxes if you 
begin collecting Social Security benefits before full retirement 
age and you’re still earning income above a specific threshold. 
If you can reduce your income below the thresholds, you can 
save a lot on taxes. We discuss these issues fully in Chapter 10.

121
 Chapter 6: Managing Budgets and Expenses
 
 If you’re working part-time in retirement, you may want to 
consider contributing to a retirement account to reduce your 
taxable income. You can establish a Keogh plan to allow 
contributions from self-employment income (see Chapter 5).
 
 When investing your money, be sure to pay close attention to 
your tax situation and select investments that match your tax 
status. Chapter 4 can help you with that.
 
✓ Property taxes: If you’re a homeowner, these taxes are a 
significant item. Many communities offer some seniors the 
ability to postpone property tax payments and offer reduced 
tax rates for lower-income seniors. To qualify, you typically 
have to present a copy of your completed Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) Form 1040 each year. Here are the options of one 
town’s property tax assistance program for homeowners age 
65 and older:
 
• Abatement (reduction): This option is available for those 
with annual household incomes of less than $49,000 
(which consists of all income, including Social Security 
benefits and investment income) and a net worth of no 
more than $1,000,000, including equity in your home. 
This particular town abates 75 percent of a senior’s 
property tax on the first $400,000 of assessed housing 
value for those with incomes of less than $32,000 annually 
and abates 60 percent for those with incomes between 
$32,000 and $49,000.
 
• Deferment: Those with incomes of less than $125,000 
per year may defer property taxes (on the first $400,000 
of assessed value) for up to 15 years. Each year, the 
taxes deferred as well as the interest at a reasonable rate 
(recently 4 percent) accumulate as a lien on the property.
 
• Freeze: To take advantage of this option, you must be a 
town resident for 10 years and have an annual income 
of less than $100,000. This option of the program allows 
for an interest-free deferral for up to 15 years on future 
increases in the property taxes on as much as $800,000 
of assessed property value. A lien is placed against the 
property for the amount owed. The amount of taxes paid 
in the year prior to application must still be paid annually 
after the freeze.

122
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
Housing
Many retirees are able to enjoy and benefit from the fact that they 
no longer have mortgage payments in retirement. To manage and 
even reduce your housing expenses during retirement, you have 
several options (check out Chapter 8 for more in-depth discussion 
about your options for housing during retirement):
 
✓ You may choose to downsize or move to a lower-cost area. If 
you live in a high-cost urban or suburban area, after the kids are 
grown and out in the world, you may choose not to pay higher 
property taxes and have so much money tied up in a home.
 
 Before you call the moving company, don’t resign yourself to 
being forced to move for financial reasons. If you want to 
stay in your current home because you like the community, 
neighbors, local service providers, and area amenities, see 
what property tax reduction/deferment programs your town 
or city offers to seniors. We discuss these program options in 
the prior section on taxes.
 
✓ You may reduce household expenditures for services. With 
more free time in retirement, you may be able to reduce some 
expenditures for services such as a gardener, housekeeper, 
and household maintenance and repair worker.
 
 Don’t underestimate the expertise or physical demands of 
particular jobs. Servicing your furnace unit may not sound like 
rocket science, but you can damage the unit or hurt yourself 
if you don’t know what you’re doing. Likewise, climbing up a 
ladder to clean out your gutters may sound like an easy way to 
save some money until you fall off and break some bones.
 
✓ You may consider taking on a tenant to bring in rental 
income. A tenant can help you reduce some of your housing 
expense burdens. Bringing in a tenant is easier and less 
intrusive if the proposed rental quarters have a separate 
entrance and are completely separate from the rest of your 
living quarters.

123
 Chapter 6: Managing Budgets and Expenses
 
 It may be worth making a modest investment to configure your 
living space to allow for such a rental unit. Just be sure not to 
undermine the property’s value by changing it in such a way 
that makes the home unappealing to potential buyers. Consult 
some local real estate agents on your proposed project. Also, be 
sure to check local zoning laws, building codes, and community 
association rules for limits on renting part of your home.
Renters and owners with mortgages face different issues, unless 
the renters have a rent-controlled apartment they’re able and 
willing to stay in for the long term. The long-term downside to 
renting is that your rent is exposed to inflation. Don’t allow the 
late 2000s real estate market softness and decline fool you — rents 
do rise over the years and decades. Here are some strategies for 
reducing your housing costs as a long-term renter in retirement:
 
✓ Consider shared housing. Living with others can improve your 
social life and reduce your costs. Check with your local senior 
center or senior’s group for information, ideas, and contacts.
 
✓ If you’re a lower-income senior, explore rent-subsidized 
senior housing. The government gives funding directly to 
apartment owners who lower the rents they charge to 
low-income tenants. The U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development can help you in your search for a rent-
subsidized apartment and with understanding the income 
restrictions to qualify. (Visit www.hud.gov/apps/section8 
for more information.) Low-rent apartments are available 
for senior citizens and people with disabilities as well as for 
families and individuals. Your state or locality also may have 
additional programs providing affordable housing to seniors. 
Many localities have an Area Office on Aging to help seniors 
identify programs for which they’re eligible.
Utilities and communication
When energy prices seemed to be spiraling out of control and were 
ever higher in the mid- to late-2000s, folks on relatively low, fixed 
incomes — as some seniors are — really felt the pinch. Thankfully 
and predictably, that bubble broke and prices came back down.

124
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
 
Changing the energy and communication sources you’re using in 
your home or car isn’t a simple matter of course for everyone. 
However, that doesn’t mean you’re powerless to reduce your utility 
bills. Here are some steps you can take:
 
✓ Get an energy audit of your home. Especially if you’ve lived 
in your home for many years, odds are it’s not as energy 
efficient as it could be. Contact your local utility company for 
an energy audit, which you generally can have done for free. 
Many local utilities offer special incentive programs for energy 
upgrades.
 
✓ Improve your home’s insulation. If you own an old home, you 
probably can improve its insulation at a modest cost.
 
✓ Take advantage of tax credits. A number of state-specific 
and federal tax credits are available for energy efficiency 
improvements. For up-to-date information, check out the 
Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency Web 
site (www.dsireusa.org), which includes links to all state-
based and federal incentives.
 
✓ Upgrade energy-wasting appliances. You’ll have to spend 
some money on these upgrades, but the payback from energy 
savings can be quite rapid for the worst energy-guzzling 
appliances.
 
✓ Reduce your garbage bill. You may be able to reduce the 
money you spend on garbage services. By recycling more of 
your household’s trash at your local recycling center and 
creating a compost pile for biodegradable trash, you may 
be able to reduce your garbage bill. Comparison shop for 
sanitation services.
 
✓ Slim your water bill. Unless you have a well on your property, 
you have a water bill that you can lower. Consider taking 
water-saving actions such as installing water flow regulators 
in shower heads and faucets. If you buy bottled water or have 
it delivered, consider instead installing a water purification 
system. Eric’s analysis has found a 100 percent return on the 
investment from making such a move. (See www.erictyson.
com for more details.)

125
 Chapter 6: Managing Budgets and Expenses
 
✓ Address telephone costs. Over the years and decades, phone 
service costs have declined. However, some folks can get 
carried away with the increasing numbers of communication 
devices, including cell phones and smart phones. Be careful 
about dropping your home phone service and simply going 
with cell phone service. Cell phone service tends to have less 
reliable connections and may not be as easily referenced by 
local emergency responders when you call 911. Landline 
service immediately communicates your physical location 
when you place a 911 call.
 
 For sure, having a simple and easy-to-use cell phone can be 
helpful when you’re out and about. To minimize cell phone 
costs, consider one of the increasing numbers of service 
providers that charge you only for the calls you make and 
receive as opposed to a monthly fixed-rate plan that offers a large 
number of calling minutes you may not come close to using.
 
✓ Try to bundle your television and Internet with your phone 
bill. Most folks find that service providers in their area offer 
both of these services along with others like phone service. 
Bundling with one provider can lead to the best deals and pric-
ing. Just be careful not to get locked into a long-term plan you 
may not be happy with or that has hefty early-termination fees.
Food
During retirement you want to manage how much you spend on 
food. To avoid spending too much, we offer the following suggestions 
to help you save money:
 
✓ Prepare more meals at home. With the extra free time 
afforded by leaving behind full-time work, some folks find they 
have the time and energy to prepare more meals at home. An 
added benefit of eating at home is that you can eat healthier 
and plan ahead. For example, you can cook a casserole and 
then eat the leftovers for a couple meals.

126
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
 
✓ Buy store brands. The quality and ingredients of store brands 
are often the same as higher-cost name brands at a much 
lower price.
 
✓ Eat out for lunch. Prices usually are less expensive than 
dinner.
 
✓ Eat out early for dinner. If you eat dinner earlier, you can 
qualify for early-bird dinner specials.
 
✓ When you eat out, make two meals out of your purchase. 
Most regular servings in restaurants are large enough that 
you can eat the leftovers at home. Ask the server to put half of 
your meal in a take-out container; you can eat it for lunch or 
dinner the next day.
 
✓ Order off the seniors menu. Some restaurants offer a 
discounted seniors menu with smaller portions.
 
✓ Split your meal with a friend. Some restaurants serve gigantean 
portions, so ask your server for an additional plate and split 
your meal with a friend or loved one.
 
✓ Order take-out. If you enjoy someone else preparing your 
food without spending a fortune, pick up your meal from your 
favorite local restaurants.
Transportation
Another benefit of leaving the workforce and retiring is the 
elimination of work-related transportation expenses. You no longer 
have a commute and the associated expenses, including gasoline, 
maintenance, tolls and public transit fees, parking charges, and so 
on. Your car should last longer too, because you likely won’t drive 
as much.
You can further reduce your expenses related to transportation 
by possibly reducing the number of cars you own. Because you no 
longer have the burden of daily commutes, you may even be able 
to make do without a car at all and rely on public transportation. 
When you need a car for a weekend or other excursion, you can 
just rent one. Some areas also have rent-by-the-hour car rental 
services for local driving. Getting rid of your car also reduces your 
auto insurance expenses.

127
 Chapter 6: Managing Budgets and Expenses
Personal care and fashion
Spending on clothing, shoes, jewelry, dry cleaning, and other 
amenties also takes a tumble when folks retire from jobs, 
especially those who worked in more formal office settings. You 
also will likely spend less on haircuts and salon treatments.
 
Don’t skimp on taking care of your health and being physically 
active. Consider joining a health club or gym that’s user friendly 
for folks of your age and interests. Of course, you don’t need a 
gym membership to be active. Walking, hiking, and other outdoor 
activities are low cost and generally healthy. Just be careful about 
falls, which become increasingly common as we age.
Travel and fun
One aspect of retirement you may be looking forward to is the 
opportunity to travel more. However, be aware that traveling and 
entertainment aren’t cheap. Consider what type of person you are 
and how your recreation desires may change once you retire.
You may end up spending a bit more on travel and entertainment 
during your early retirement years compared with later in your 
retirement years. Most folks don’t travel much later in retirement 
due to reduced mobility and increased health issues. Keep that in 
mind in the earlier years of retirement and be sure to take advantage 
of your mobility and money while you’re able.
 
During your retirement years, you can save money on entertainment 
and travel expenses in a couple easy ways:
 
✓ Travel during off-peak times. You probably have more 
flexibility as a retiree, so you can travel during the nonbusy 
times and take advantage of cheaper airfares, hotel rooms, 
and car rental fees.
 
✓ Benefit from reduced senior prices. You usually can find 
discounted senior rates at movie theaters, hotels, public golf 
courses, and other venues. Don’t be shy about asking for a senior 
discount. If you’d rather not inquire when you’re at a venue, call 
in advance and ask about senior rates and who qualifies.

128
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
Health care
Most people end up spending more on health care during retire-
ment. The average American over the age of 65 spends about 
$7,000 per year, and costs keep rising faster than the overall rate 
of inflation. Check out Chapter 9 for more details. In your elderly 
years, even if you remain in good health, you’ll probably visit the 
doctor more and undergo more frequent routine and preventative 
testing. You also may be unpleasantly surprised at the increase in 
how much you spend on prescription drugs and dental and vision 
care visits and procedures.
Insurance
Being able to retire financially is a major milestone. The fact that 
you’re sufficiently financially independent should enable you to 
reduce and eliminate some insurance, including life and disability 
insurance. Note: One insurance you may need more of is umbrella 
or excess liability coverage. As your net worth has grown over the 
years, your need for this coverage grows too. This insurance pro-
tects your assets against lawsuits and other liability claims arising 
from your home and cars.
Children and grandchildren
Having kids grow up and move out of the nest dramatically reduces 
expenditures related to your kids. Think about all the money par-
ents spend on diapers, day care, toys, sports, music lessons, activi-
ties, braces, and so on. If you had kids later in life, or have a special 
needs child, you may still have some expenses into your senior 
years. The same may hold true with helping to pay off your kid’s 
student loans. So factor these expenses into your financial plan.
 
Your grown children and their offspring (your grandkids) may need 
or want your financial assistance sometime during your retirement 
years. If you can afford to help them, consider doing so. But be 
mindful of keeping them from taking responsibility for their own 
lives; if they learn that they can always get more money from the 
First Bank of Mom and Dad, they’ll always come around.

▶ Managing your investment mix over time
▶ Funding and annuitizing annuities
▶ Selecting your best pension options
▶ Reviewing helpful withdrawal strategies
A
s you approach and enter retirement, you’ll have plenty of 
decisions and issues to deal with regarding your investments. 
Although some of these are straightforward, others can be quite 
complex and stressful because you’re making decisions that are 
irrevocable and have long-term consequences.
This chapter should help you minimize that stress and maximize 
the financial results from these important decisions. In this 
chapter, we explain how to adjust your investment mix over the 
years, estimate your investment income, keep your portfolio in 
balance, assess what roles annuities should play in your retirement 
plans, choose among your pension options, and plot your retirement 
account withdrawal strategies.

130
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
Guiding Your Investments 
through Retirement
In Chapter 4, we discuss the importance of developing an overall 
investment plan known as your asset allocation. Although this is 
important, coming up with a plan isn’t enough because you need 
to manage and adjust your allocations over the years, too. And, 
then, as you approach retirement, you’ll likely need to assess 
how to live off your investments, such as through receiving the 
investment income from your portfolio. To help you figure out how 
to manage your allocations and figure out how much you need to 
live comfortably, the following sections come to the rescue.
Estimating your investment income
Most near-retirees are at least a little frightened at the prospect 
of losing their employment income and having to live off of their 
investments and monthly benefit checks (such as Social Security 
and their pension, if they’re lucky to have one). Even if you don’t 
have to withdraw money from your financial assets at the beginning 
of your retirement, you may need to later.
 
Be careful to understand that your investment income may vary. 
For example, in a severe economic downturn (like the one in the 
late 2000s), stock dividends and bond interest may be reduced, so 
give yourself some wiggle room.
Making the calculations
When estimating your investment income, make sure you examine 
your current investment holdings to determine about how much 
annual income (not capital gains distributions) those investments 
are throwing off. Tally that income with your other income to 
see whether you’ll have enough to meet your anticipated annual 
spending desires or needs. Note: Most folks don’t feel comfortable 
tapping into their investment principal, so they seek to use the 
income from their investments. If you have sufficient assets and 
those assets are properly diversified, you may be able leave your 
investment principal intact.

131
 Chapter 7: Guiding Investments and Distributions in Retirement
The good news: You can figure out all the numbers and estimate 
how much money you have by using the relatively simple guidelines, 
such as the 4 percent rule, that we provide in Chapter 6. These 
guidelines can help you determine how much of your assets you 
can safely use each year and have confidence that your money will 
last as long as you do.
Determining whether to modify your investments 
to earn more income now
 
In Eric’s work as a financial counselor, he saw some folks who 
were so opposed to using their investment principal that they were 
willing to dramatically overhaul their portfolios to be able to live off 
of the income for a significant number of years. Generally, this isn’t 
a good idea.
Consider, for example, the case of the Dannons, who worked with 
Eric on some retirement plans. They were insistent that they live 
off of investment income. Eric informed the Dannons that to be 
able to do so, their portfolio would have to produce about 8.5 
percent investment income per year. Consistently achieving that 
level of income would have required them to invest nearly everything 
in junk bond funds. Doing so would have enabled them to meet 
their income objectives in the short-term, but over the long-term 
their portfolio would have had no real growth potential.
You may, however, want to modify your holdings if you’re coming 
close to realizing your investment income desires. For example, 
suppose you have about 65 percent in stocks and 35 percent in 
bonds. You crunch some numbers and realize that a 50/50 mix will 
boost your investment income enough to close the gap. As long 
as that mix makes sense given your overall goals and situation, 
making a modest shift like this may make sense. Realize, though, 
the trade-off is that reaching for more current income will likely 
reduce the longer-term appreciation potential of your portfolio.
Rebalancing your investments
Rebalancing is a rather clever system that disciplines you to buy 
low and sell high. It forces you to get your portfolio’s asset allocation 
back to where it should be. For example, suppose you had a 

132
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
50/50 mix between stocks and bonds. And, then suppose stocks 
do poorly while bonds do well so now you’ve got a 40/60 mix 
with bonds now in the majority. Rebalancing would have you sell 
enough bonds and buy more stocks to get back to the original 
50/50 mix. In the following sections, we show you why balancing is 
so beneficial and then illustrate its success with an example.
Understanding the benefits of rebalancing
Now, you may ask why anyone would take money from an investment 
that’s doing well (bonds) and put some of that into an investment 
that’s doing poorly (stocks). The reasons are twofold:
 
✓ It helps get your investment plan back on track. You developed 
an asset allocation plan and should stick to it unless you have 
a compelling reason — such as a change in your personal 
situation — to alter your plan.
 
✓ It allows you to take advantage of the inevitable rebound 
that stocks should eventually enjoy. Asset classes, like 
stocks, that suffer setbacks don’t stay down forever.
Here are some important tips to make the most of and be smart 
about rebalancing:
 
✓ Beware of tax consequences. If you’re selling investments 
outside retirement accounts and those sales trigger realized 
profits, you’ll owe taxes on those profits. That’s why rebalancing 
is best done with money inside retirement accounts where 
you don’t need to be concerned with tax consequences on 
transactions.
 
✓ Beware of transaction costs. When you buy and sell certain 
investments, such as individual stocks and bonds, you may 
incur fees.
 
 With most exchange-traded funds and no-load mutual funds 
(see Chapters 4 and 5, respectively), this isn’t an issue, but it 
will cost you to trade most other investments. That doesn’t 
mean you shouldn’t rebalance if you have to pay some 
transaction costs; it simply means you should fully understand 
trading fees before you take action. You may want to rebalance 
a little less frequently than you would if no transaction costs 
are involved.

133
 Chapter 7: Guiding Investments and Distributions in Retirement
 
✓ Find ways to rebalance by not making unnecessary trades. 
You can avoid transaction and tax costs through rebalancing 
with distributed investment income (interest and dividends), 
new contributions, and planned withdrawals.
 
✓ Select a sensible rebalancing period/trigger. Numerous 
studies have shown that the benefits don’t outweigh the costs 
when rebalancing is done frequently — such as monthly and 
quarterly. Those studies, along with our experience, suggest 
that the best approach is to review your portfolio at least 
one or two times per year and rebalance if your investment 
allocations have moved off base by at least 5 percent. Say, 
for example, you have 60 percent in stocks and 40 percent in 
bonds. If the stock allocation gets to 55 or 65 percent or the 
bond allocation gets to 35 or 45 percent, you should rebalance.
Taking a look at a rebalancing example
Consider the following example that shows rebalancing in action: 
Suppose you currently have $100,000 invested for your retirement 
in an asset allocation of 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds. 
And further suppose that over the next two years the stocks drop 
50 percent in value while your bonds produce a total return of 10 
percent. Table 7-1 shows what will happen to your asset allocation 
in the absence of any changes from you.
Table 7-1 
Allocation Changes
Starting Mix
Mix after Two Years
Stocks
$60,000
$30,000
Bonds
$40,000
$44,000
As you can see from Table 7-1, after two years, instead of having 60 
percent in stocks and 40 percent in bonds, you now have about 41 
percent in stocks and about 59 percent in bonds. To return to your 
original chosen allocation, you would need to move about $14,400 
out of bonds and into stocks. Refer to Table 7-2 to see what the 
numbers would look like after the rebalance.

Looking Closer at Annuities
As we discuss in Chapter 5, you can channel contributions into 
numerous types of retirement accounts. By directing money into 
such accounts, you may derive significant tax benefits.
Annuities provide an additional vehicle for saving and investing 
money in a tax-sheltered fashion. And compared with traditional 
retirement accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s, annuities offer a unique 
way of tapping the money within them through annuitizing 
(receiving monthly payments). We discuss these issues in this 
section.
Annuities: A cross between a 
retirement account and insurance
Annuities are a bit of a quirky investment vehicle in that they 
have similarities to some retirement accounts but also have some 
elements of insurance. Although annuities don’t offer upfront tax 
breaks for contributions, the investment earnings accumulate 
without taxation, as they do in retirement accounts, until withdrawn.
 
This is how the insurance feature of an annuity works: If the annuity 
holder passes away and the annuity account value is lower than the 
original amount invested, the beneficiaries of the annuity get back 
the original investment amount.

135
 Chapter 7: Guiding Investments and Distributions in Retirement
Here’s an example to illustrate: Suppose Alan invested $100,000 
in 2007 in a variable annuity (which is discussed in the following 
section) and directed much of the money into stock mutual funds. 
His stock fund investments dropped significantly along with the 
rest of the global stock markets during the late 2000s recession 
and bear market. When his investments were beginning to bounce 
back in 2010, Alan died. His annuity’s account value was $85,000, 
or $15,000 less than he invested. In this case, his beneficiaries get 
$100,000 from the annuity, not just $85,000.
Contributing in your working years
If you’ve maximized contributions to retirement accounts through 
your employer and an IRA, and you want to put away more money 
to compound without taxation during your working years, you can 
consider an annuity. You have a couple options when investing in 
annuities:
 
✓ Variable annuity: With this type, you may invest in mutual 
funds inside the annuity.
 
✓ Fixed annuity: This type of annuity pays you a set rate of 
interest, which is typically adjusted annually at the discretion 
of the annuity issuer.
People who have been comfortable with investing in mutual funds 
should be fine using a variable annuity. On the other hand, if you 
prefer knowing your return in advance and are willing to accept a 
likely lower long-term return in exchange for eliminating the 
downside risk, consider a fixed annuity.
 
During your working years, be careful not to assume that 
contributing more money into annuities is always better. Some folks 
contribute more to their retirement accounts than makes good 
financial and tax sense. For example, it may not make sense for a 
taxpayer who’s temporarily in a low tax bracket (or owing no tax at 
all) to contribute to retirement accounts. That person could end up 
paying a much higher tax rate when receiving the investment earn-
ings in retirement. Similarly, folks who already have a large estate 

136
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
and have significant money inside retirement accounts that could 
get walloped by estate and income taxes upon their passing should 
be cautious about investing in an annuity. Few people, of course, 
have this perhaps enviable “problem.”
 
When in doubt, especially if you have reason to believe you should 
scale back on retirement account contributions, consult with a 
competent financial or tax advisor who works for an hourly fee and 
doesn’t sell products or manage money. You also can refer to the 
latest edition of Eric’s Personal Finance For Dummies (Wiley) for 
more details.
Annuitizing in your 
retirement years
With fixed or variable annuities, you can annuitize the assets. In 
other words, you can convert them into a monthly income stream 
during your retirement years. When you annuitize, you’re entering 
into an agreement to receive monthly payments in exchange for 
the total balance in the account.
Under this agreement, you receive monthly payments in one of the 
following ways:
 
✓ Variable payments: The monthly income you receive varies 
with the performance of the investments.
 
✓ Fixed payments: Under this option, you receive the same 
amount per month for a certain period of time.
 
✓ A combination: With this option, a portion of your payment is 
fixed and a portion can be variable.
A few annuities offer monthly payments that are indexed for 
inflation. The trade-off with an inflation-adjusted payment is that 
the initial payment is much lower than for a fixed payment annuity.

137
 Chapter 7: Guiding Investments and Distributions in Retirement
 
If you currently don’t have money in an annuity and are approaching 
retirement, you can immediately put funds into a lifetime income 
annuity, also called an immediate annuity. In other words, with your 
contribution, you immediately annuitize and begin receiving 
monthly payments. As with annuitizing an existing annuity, lifetime 
income annuities can provide fixed, variable, or inflation-adjusted 
monthly income. The choice is up to you.
 
When you annuitize, you generally have a lot of payment options. 
The options may vary a bit by annuity provider and by state, but 
the following are the most common:
 
✓ Period certain: In this case, you choose a certain number of 
years (for example, a minimum of 5 years to a maximum of 
30 years) over which you’re guaranteed to receive monthly 
payments. Obviously, the longer the period over which you’d 
like to get payments, the lower those payments will be. In the 
event that you pass away before the end of the designated 
period, your beneficiary receives your remaining payments.
 
✓ Lifetime annuity: With this option, you receive a monthly 
check for the rest of your life. Payments cease when you pass 
away.
 
✓ Lifetime annuity with period certain: This option provides 
payments for life, but you’re also guaranteed payments for a 
particular period of time (for example, between 5 years and 30 
years). If you pass away before the completion of the period 
certain payments, your designated beneficiary receives your 
remaining payments.
 
✓ Joint and survivor annuity: In this case, monthly payments 
continue as long as you or your designated annuitant (for 
example, your spouse) are alive. You have options for the 
survivor’s payments. You may continue their payments at 100 
percent, 75 percent, or 50 percent of your amount. The higher 
the percentage you desire, the lower your initial payments will 
be, however.

138
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
Choosing Your Pension Options
A pension plan certainly simplifies the process of saving for 
retirement. With such a plan, the employer puts away money on 
your behalf and invests it on your behalf. Couldn’t get much easier 
than that, could it?
Some employees, especially those who work for larger organizations, 
earn pension benefits. Slowly but surely, however, such plans are 
being phased out and replaced by plans like 401(k)s where the 
employee must elect to save their own money from their paycheck 
and direct the investment of it over the years. Head to Chapter 5 
for more on 401(k)s.
 
If you’re fortunate enough to have a pension plan, you want to 
make the right decisions to receive distributions during your 
senior years. With pension plans, you typically face two important 
decisions:
 
✓ You have to decide whether to take the pension as a monthly 
retirement payment or a lump sum distribution.
 
✓ Those who opt for the monthly pension payment usually have 
a second decision among several payment plan options.
We deal with each of these in turn starting with the first and 
biggest issue — lump sum or monthly payments.
Selecting between a lump sum 
or monthly payments
The first question you should contemplate when considering 
your pension options is whether to take a lump sum payment or 
monthly payments. With a lump sum payment, you get one large 
payment, and with monthly payments, you get a set amount per 
month over an extended period of time.

139
 Chapter 7: Guiding Investments and Distributions in Retirement
Like the sticker price on a house, a lump sum sounds like a big 
number. However, pension plans offering a lump sum option 
generally are structured to provide about the same expected value 
to employees. That’s why it’s usually difficult to decide based 
on financial factors; the decision hinges more on qualitative 
considerations, for example, such as your desire to control and 
invest the money yourself and have money leftover for heirs 
should you pass away prematurely in retirement.
 In making this important decision, beware of financial planners’ 
and brokers’ advice when they aren’t paid hourly or with a fixed 
fee. If you take a monthly pension, there’s no lump sum for them to 
manage.
Taking stock of your situation
When making the decision between a lump sum and a monthly 
payment, start by surveying your progress with retirement planning 
and determining how much risk you can take with your pension 
money. Prospective retirees should conduct a retirement analysis 
to determine how the standard of living likely to be provided by 
their assets compares with their expected retirement expenses.
As an example, consider the case of Walter and Susan. When Eric 
reviewed their situation, Walter was 56 years old and ready to 
retire from his employer of the past 27 years. He had to decide 
whether to take a $20,000 annual pension, with no cost-of-living 
allowance (COLA) and a 50 percent survivor’s annuity, or a lump 
sum of $265,000.
The couple surveyed their finances, and they seemed to have 
quite a bit of money earmarked for retirement already. They had 
expected Social Security benefits totaling $2,650 per month at age 
62, Susan’s pension of $1,500 monthly (with a COLA), and their 
traditional retirement savings plans — his was worth $255,000 and 
she had about $70,000 in hers. However, the standard of living that 
these assets could provide was only about 50 percent of their 
current annual combined salaries of $130,000.

140
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
Walter did an analysis through the investment company managing 
his firm’s 401(k), and the results suggested they had enough to 
retire. However, this presumed he worked to age 60, and Walter 
didn’t recall specific numbers detailing how much wiggle room 
he may have. Because he was trying to call it quits by age 56, he 
needed to update the analysis.
The bottom line was that the income from Walter’s pension was of 
great importance. If they took the lump sum and managed it badly 
or simply had bad investment luck, it would affect their living 
standard. The good news: They didn’t live lavishly. Their modest 
ranch home had no mortgage, and Walter’s long and costly commute 
would vanish when he retired.
Walter’s $20,000 annual pension payment is greater than the 
expected income from the lump sum would be for about the first 
18 years of Walter’s retirement (when he reached age 74). So they 
determined that the monthly payments would make more sense 
for their situation.
Considering key issues regarding 
your pension decision
 
After you take stock of your financial situation, you have a few 
additional key considerations to think about when weighing a 
pension versus a lump sum. Keep these in mind as you make your 
decision:
 
✓ How adept are you with managing money? A major benefit 
of a pension is that the investment responsibility rests with 
professional pension managers who are far less likely to make 
dramatic moves. The best way to answer this question is to 
reflect on your historic experience managing money. If your 
track record is problematic or you simply lack such experience, 
lean toward the monthly pension and steer clear of the 
lump sum.
 
 Walter’s investment management history (see the preceding 
section for Walter’s story) showed evidence of being emotionally 
driven. He sold most of his stock holdings when he was worried 
about the economy and gas prices. He also admitted to getting 
jumpy the closer he got to retiring.

141
 Chapter 7: Guiding Investments and Distributions in Retirement
 
✓ What’s your health situation and family longevity record? If 
you have a major medical problem or reason to believe that 
your genes destine you to fewer golden years, one advantage 
of the lump sum is that you get all the money to use and use 
sooner if you choose — and you can leave the remainder to 
your heirs. A monthly pension lasts only as long as you do 
(with reduced benefits as long as your spouse survives 
after you).
 
✓ How comfortable will you be tapping into principal? Many 
retirees are fine with living off investment income, but it’s 
psychologically difficult for most to use principal. Thus, 
pension checks, which are more comfortably spent, can 
indeed provide a higher standard of living.
 
✓ What’s the safety of your pension benefits? Retirees often 
fear that a pension benefit also may last only as long as a 
company does. But you don’t have to worry; pensions are 
backed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), 
an independent government agency.
Table 7-3 shows the 2010 annual and monthly maximum PBGC 
benefit guarantees for retirees from age 75 to 45. The maximum 
amount is lower for benefits commencing at ages below 65, 
reflecting the fact that younger retirees receive more monthly 
pension checks over a longer expected remaining life span. The 
maximum amount is higher for benefits commencing at ages above 
65, reflecting the fact that older retirees receive fewer monthly 
pension checks over their expected remaining life spans.

 Chapter 7: Guiding Investments and Distributions in Retirement
As you can see from the table, Walter (from the preceding section’s 
example) is covered. His $20,000 annual pension payments are safe 
under the PBGC. However, pessimists who feel the PBGC is woefully 
underfunded would argue that he may take a haircut should his 
employer fail in the years ahead.
 PBGC is a federal corporation created under the Employee 
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). It currently guarantees 
payment of basic pension benefits earned by 44 million American 
workers and retirees participating in over 29,000 private-sector 
defined benefit pension plans. The agency receives no funds from 
general tax revenues. Operations are financed largely by insurance 
premiums paid by companies that sponsor pension plans and 
investment returns.
Deciding among monthly 
payment options
If you opt for a monthly check, some plans offer different options 
that basically differ from one another the way that investments do 
in terms of risk and return.
 
Here’s a rundown of the most common options:
 
✓ The 100 percent joint and survivor option: The “safest” 
option, with the lowest payment, is the 100 percent joint and 
survivor option. This payment continues as long as either 
the pensioner or his or her spouse is still living. This option 
makes sense for risk-averse retirees who are dependent on the 
pension check (and perhaps aren’t in the best of health) and 
whose spouses also are dependent on that pension check.
 
✓ The two-thirds joint and survivor plan: The two-thirds joint 
and survivor plan is intermediate in risk and payment amount. 
With this plan, after the death of the pensioner, the survivor 
receives two-thirds of the pension amount paid to the pensioner 
before his or her passing.

144
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
 
✓ The single-life option: The riskiest option but the one that 
maximizes payments now is the single-life option. This option 
only makes payments as long as the pensioner is living. We 
would only advocate selecting this option if you’re in good 
health, have plenty of assets, and your spouse could afford to 
live without the pension check.
 After you decide you want a monthly check instead of a lump sum, 
don’t automatically take the pension offered by your employer. 
You may find a better deal from an insurance company annuity. 
For instance, you can take the lump sum from your employer and 
use the funds to buy an annuity. Find out the monthly check you 
would receive from some insurance annuities purchased with the 
lump sum that you’re eligible for. Compare those with the monthly 
payments offered by your employer. Before opting for an insurance 
annuity, however, keep financial security in mind. An insurance 
annuity is backed only by the insurer and perhaps a limited 
guarantee from a state insurance fund. Your employer annuity is 
backed by both the pension fund and the PBGC.
Eyeing Withdrawal Strategies 
for Your Investment Accounts
To make the most of your money, you should understand the 
rules and your options regarding withdrawing money from various 
accounts, both retirement and regular, in your golden years. This 
section provides some suggestions and tips for you to keep in 
mind regarding your investment accounts.
If you haven’t already done so, be sure to read Chapter 5 where 
we discuss the rules, early withdrawal penalties, and required 
distributions that apply to retirement accounts. In Chapter 6, we 
cover issues pertaining to how much of your nest egg you could 
spend annually. And, throughout this chapter, we discuss your 
options for tapping your annuity and pension.

145
 Chapter 7: Guiding Investments and Distributions in Retirement
Here are some additional and general tips to keep in mind 
regarding tapping your investment accounts:
 
✓ Tap nonretirement account money first. All other things 
being equal, it’s generally better to tap your nonretirement 
holdings first — if you’ll experience less of a tax bite by doing 
so. However, don’t assume that you’ll pay more taxes to tap 
money inside retirement accounts. That may not be the case 
if some of that money already has been taxed and if selling 
nonretirement assets would trigger a big tax bill.
 
 An exception is when your nonretirement accounts are 
invested to earn much higher returns than your retirement 
accounts, especially when the returns in the nonretirement 
accounts will be taxed at favorable long-term capital gains 
rates. When the nonretirement accounts earn 4 percent or 
more annually than the retirement accounts, it’s better to tap 
the retirement accounts first.
 
✓ Let tax-free accounts, such as Roth IRAs, compound as long 
as possible. Spend from your other accounts before tapping a 
Roth IRA. You’ll maximize your long-term returns by keeping 
more money in accounts that provide for tax-free accumulation 
and withdrawal of money.
 
✓ Tap your nonretirement accounts efficiently. Sell investments 
with paper losses (those that have gone down in value versus 
their purchase price) first. Next, sell assets that will incur the 
lowest tax bill as a percentage of their value. These steps defer 
taxes as long as possible and maximize the amount of after-tax 
wealth available during retirement.
 
✓ Understand bigger picture tax issues. In addition to income 
taxes, you may have estate tax issues to consider regarding 
which of your assets you should use. Spend the money to 
consult with a competent tax advisor as needed.
 
✓ Use your money! Too often, retirees who were good savers 
during their working years have great difficulty enjoying and 
using their money in retirement. See our discussion in 
Chapter 6 to calm your fears and worries about possibly 
running out of money.

Y
our housing needs change during your life, but they can really 
change in your retirement years. Life changes — such as 
ceasing work, kids growing up and moving out, divorce, death of a 
spouse, and so on — can have a dramatic impact on your housing 
wants and requirements and ability to afford housing.
In particular you face significant housing choices during your 
golden years. Most retirees grapple with moving, possibly down-

health care. This chapter addresses these decisions you have to 
make and how the choices you make can potentially affect your 
finances. Additionally, we cover the key tax issues you need to 
understand to make the most of your housing decisions. Finally, 
we discuss an emerging area: reverse mortgages as a way to partly

Analyzing Moving
When Laura and Rick Idealists (a real couple but obviously not 
their real names) were in their middle-age years and still working, 
they imagined a slower-paced life in a less-crowded and lower-cost 
area for their retirement. Like many folks dreaming about and 
envisioning retirement, the Idealists believed that once unchained 
from needing to work, they would have much better choices for 
places to live.
As they neared and finally entered retirement, the Idealists didn’t 
move. Upon reflection, they better realized and appreciated the 
joy brought to them by their local friends, favorite restaurants, 
and service providers (including their medical providers). When 
confronted with the reality of moving from their local area, they 
realized that they’d lose a lot of personal connections that meant 
so much to them.
We know of folks who did move when they retired and who were 
motivated largely or in part by the attraction of reducing their 
expenses. Some did lower their living costs and some didn’t. Their 
happiness varied with their new locations as well. In this section, 
we discuss the appeal and realities of moving and the issues to 
weigh and contemplate.
Considering the pros 
and cons of moving
Although many folks are content to and prefer to stay put when 
they retire, others wish to move. Among the primary motivations 
we’ve seen for retirees moving include the following:
 
✓ Being closer to family and good friends: Because jobs and 
careers take folks to locations that may not be their first or 
even second or third choices location-wise, it’s no surprise 
that some retirees find themselves geographically isolated 
from their closest relatives and even best friends. Especially 
if you have adult children and possibly grandchildren living 
elsewhere, the pull to move closer to them can be strong.

149
 Chapter 8: Making Important Housing Decisions 
 
 Clearly, moving closer to family and friends may have little or 
nothing to do with your finances, but that doesn’t mean you 
should take the decision lightly. At a minimum, you should 
discuss your feelings and possible plans with the folks to 
whom you’d be moving near. Also, consider the possibility 
that someday these relatives may need or want to move 
somewhere else.
 
✓ Living in a better climate: With all the free time that retirement 
generally entails, climate escalates in importance for some 
people. Many older people prefer more temperate climates — 
that is fewer days of extreme heat or cold. Think locales 
near Santa Barbara and San Diego rather than Houston or 
Minneapolis. Some folks with particular health conditions 
such as allergies or asthma find that moving to a temperate 
climate helps improve their symptoms and health.
 
✓ Reducing their cost of living: During their working years, 
many people live in more congested urban or near-urban areas 
with pricey housing and property taxes. If you have kids, you 
probably also are paying a premium to live in an area with 
better public schools. No longer constrained by where work 
is located or the need for access to good schools, you can 
consider moving to lower-cost areas.
 
✓ Selecting housing that’s user-friendly for the elderly: As 
people age, their mobility and coordination inevitably decline 
albeit at different rates for different people. So the housing 
you choose to live in during your younger years may no 
longer make sense. Steep driveways, stairways to the house 
and in the house, and other design issues may be decidedly 
unfriendly and potentially dangerous to your aging body.
 
Moving does have its downsides, however. And people often 
overlook them in the excitement and allure of believing the grass is 
greener elsewhere. Check out these downsides to moving:
 
✓ Living costs may not decrease enough or at all. The mistake 
all too many folks make is that they assume their overall living 
costs will be lower after a move to an area that attracts them 
with, for example, lower-cost housing. You must and should 
examine all your living expenses and how they may change 
with a proposed move. 

150
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
 
✓ You may introduce other negatives. You may be successful in 
reducing your living costs with a move, but you also may find 
yourself in an area with other problems — more crime, traffic 
congestion, higher insurance costs on your home and car, and 
so on. Minimize your chances for disappointment by doing 
sufficient research before you make a decision to move.
 
✓ Moving is costly. Although you may be able to save money 
after your move is complete, be sure to make realistic estimates 
of your likely moving costs and how many years it will take 
to recoup them. The biggest expenses include real estate 
transaction costs and moving company costs.
 
Here’s the bottom line: To make an informed decision, do all 
your homework and research concerning the topics discussed in 
this section. Don’t focus on one reason to move. And don’t make 
assumptions, such as your living costs will be lower because housing 
costs less in a new community. Get the facts on how all your living 
costs will change with a move. The best sources are people you 
know who already live there. You can consult official sources, 
such as chambers of commerce and realtors, but they may not be 
objective.
Eyeing the options for 
where you can move
Traditional retirement living and housing choices are changing. 
New generations of retirees are looking for new living experiences, 
and developers are obliging, giving older Americans more choices 
for living arrangements than ever before. These new choices 
involve more than simply relocating outside the traditional 
retirement Sunbelt havens like Florida and Arizona. They also 
involve different types of housing and living arrangements and 
different types of activities in the communities.
One reason for the new senior living choices is that people are 
retiring earlier. At some adult communities, about one-third of 
residents are under age 65. Those under age 55 can make up 10 
percent or more of the residents in some communities.

 Chapter 8: Making Important Housing Decisions 
Another reason for the changes is that today’s longer retirements 
have more stages than in the past, generally up to three stages. 
Each stage has a range of living choices. And, of course, not 
everyone goes through all these stages or even any of them. The 
following sections identify some specific choices you have if you 
decide to move during retirement.
 
Retirement housing decisions are more complicated than ever, 
because you have more choices. Review all your options so you’ll 
be happy with the choice you make until you’re ready to move to 
the next stage.
Stage No. 1: Downsizing
When folks downsize — that is, move to a smaller home — the 
goal is usually to maintain the same contacts and activities while 
shedding the labor and costs of maintaining a larger home. When 
you hit this stage, you’ve decided it’s time to stop mowing the 
lawn, raking leaves, checking the gutters, and maintaining the 
mechanical systems. You also don’t want to pay for rooms you 
aren’t using.
 
You have several options for downsizing. You can move to a smaller 
house, townhouse, or condominium in a regular development. In this 
case, your neighbors will consist of those from all the age groups. 
Or you can move to a planned senior community (or age-restricted 
community) where people are similar in age, such as those we 
discuss in the next section.
Stage No. 2: Looking at retirement communities
You may consider moving into a retirement community after you 
retire. Oftentimes these communites are in warmer locations, such 
as sunny Florida or Arizona. If you’re considering moving into a 
retirement community, make sure you look at the following factors:
 
✓ The demographics of the community and how that appeals 
to you: Some seniors prefer to be around people their own 
age; others prefer more diversity. If you’re a young retiree, 
you may want to check the average age in a senior community, 
because in some the average age is 75 or older. An adult 
community also may make you feel isolated from your family 

152
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
and friends, though you do have the opportunity to make new 
friends. A community that includes all ages may be noisier, 
less well-kept, and keep later hours. You may want to visit at 
different times of the day and week to get a good flavor of the 
lifestyle.
 
✓ The types of activities offered on-site and in the surrounding 
community: Each type of community will have its own activities, 
plus the activities in the surrounding community. A development 
built for seniors may provide services that are helpful to 
seniors, such as laundry, housecleaning, and on-grounds 
restaurants. Many newer senior communities also have 
amenities such as spas, golf courses, health clubs, and Internet 
centers. They can be more like resorts or country clubs than 
traditional adult communities or regular developments. Also, be 
sure to consider how your current activities would be affected.
 
The adult communities outside Florida and Arizona tend to have 
younger residents than those in the traditional retirement states. 
Some university towns also are courting retirees and seniors. You 
may have more variety in your lifestyle by choosing a senior 
community located in an area that isn’t a traditional senior haven. 
Newer communities also have up-to-date features such as wiring for 
high-speed Internet.
Stage No. 3: Housing that’s near 
family and has healthcare
The third stage of retirement often involves moving near friends 
and family, especially grandchildren, and moving into traditional 
senior housing with some health care facilities on premises. This 
stage has four basic choices when it comes to housing:
 
✓ Independent living: This essentially entails living in an 
apartment or condo complex for seniors. As part of your 
monthly rental you get some basic services, such as 
housekeeping, transportation, activities, and some meals.
 
✓ Assisted living: This type of housing offers additional services 
and is for someone who needs help with two or more of the 
basic activities of daily living (bathing, dressing, walking, 
and so on). You may be able to avoid or delay this option by 
having in-home care at your existing residence.

153
 Chapter 8: Making Important Housing Decisions 
 
✓ Nursing home: This option is for someone who needs daily 
medical care help.
 
✓ Continuing care retirement community (CCRC): This option 
bundles all the preceding living arrangements into one. You 
can start in independent living or assisted living, and then as 
your needs change, you’re guaranteed a place in the other 
types of care. You only have to move to another location in 
the same community instead of having to look for a different 
facility and moving there. CCRCs are becoming very popular 
and are being built all over the country.
 
There’s no one right answer in terms of housing. Each person’s 
situation and preferences are unique so we advise that you explore 
your options and select the choice that feels right for your situation. 
Your doctor or other medical professional may direct you to one 
of the options. You also may find objective advice from your local 
Area Office on Aging or other local government sources.
The ups and downs of community 
associations
When you move into a planned commu-
nity at any of the stages of retirement 
(see the earlier section “Eyeing the 
options for where you can move” for 
more information), you also have to face 
the issue of community association. This 
group makes and enforces the rules for 
the community. It also can set dues and 
determine the amount of spending on 
common areas.
The associations and people involved 
in community associations sometimes 
make living in a community unpleasant. 
Some people abuse the power of the 
association. Others in the community 
may want dues as low as possible and 
oppose spending for almost anything. 
As you can imagine, conflicting person-
alities can get involved and matters can 
escalate. In the worst case, lawsuits are 
filed by all sides while the community 
deteriorates.
Your best bet if you’re new to the 
area is to review past minutes of the 
association’s meetings and back issues 
of any newsletters it publishes. Interview 
residents who will candidly discuss the 
status of things. These are definitely 
things you won’t hear from the sales 
personnel, but they’re things you should 
know before making a decision.

Tapping Your Home’s Equity: 
Reverse Mortgages
If you own the same home during most of the decades of your 
adult life, you probably will have some decent equity accumulated 
in it. You may wish to tap that equity to supplement your retirement 
income. For example, you can sell your home, buy a smaller, less 
costly property, and use the profit you make to finance your 
retirement.
Another way to tap into your equity is through a reverse mortage, 
also known as a home equity conversion mortgage, which enables 
you through a loan to receive tax-free income on your home’s 
equity while still living in the home.
Reverse mortgages fill a void and are just beginning to tap into 
growing demand. The first reverse mortgage was actually done 
generations ago — in 1961 to be exact. Clearly it took many years 
for them to really begin to take hold, but now we’re seeing more 
than 100,000 done on an annual basis.
The following sections outline the specifics of reverse mortgages, 
including how they work and how to determine whether one is 
right for you.
Defining terms and costs
With a reverse mortgage, the lender pays you (via lump sum, 
monthly payments, or a credit line), and the accumulated loan 
balance and interest is paid off when your home is sold or you 
pass away. The typical borrower is a widow who’s 70+ years old 
and running out of money, wants to stay in her home, and needs 
money for basic living expenses or for important home-maintenance 
projects such as replacing a leaky roof.

155
 Chapter 8: Making Important Housing Decisions 
 
So are you wondering whether you qualify? Here are the basic 
standards of eligibility:
 
✓ You, the homeowner, must be at least 62 years of age. 
 
✓ You must use the home as your principal residence. 
 
✓ You must have any outstanding debt against the home 
paid in full. (When we say “home,” we must add that co-op 
apartments generally aren’t eligible for a reverse mortgage.)
Retirees we speak with who have taken a reverse mortgage 
generally say it has been a good experience for them. They often 
cite that the extra income allowed them to keep up a home’s 
maintenance, pay medical and other costs, avoid having to scrimp 
so much on things like eating out sometimes, and gain peace of 
mind not having to make house payments.
 
Reverse mortgages aren’t free of their downsides. Keep the 
following in mind:
 
✓ The effective interest rate can vary greatly. With their high 
upfront costs, the effective interest rate (which factors in all 
the fees and interest you pay relative to the number of years 
you actually keep the loan) on most reverse mortgages easily 
jumps into the double-digit realm if you only stay a few years 
into the loan.
 
✓ They can be complicated to understand and compare. Your 
effective interest rate varies greatly depending on how long 
you’re in the home and using the loan, the timing and size of 
payments you receive, and your home’s value over time. One 
unknown that you can’t control is if an extended nursing home 
stay keeps you out of your home for 12 months and forces the 
sale of your home. In such a situation, at least the proceeds 
from the sale could be used toward the nursing home.
 
On the flip side, some aspects to qualifying for and having a reverse 
mortgage are actually easier than with a traditional mortgage. 
Consider the following:

156
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
 
✓ You don’t need to have any income. Income isn’t important 
because you’re not making any payments. The loan balance is 
accumulating against the value of your home, and it gets paid 
when the home is sold.
 
✓ You don’t need good credit. You’re not borrowing money, so 
your credit score doesn’t matter.
 
✓ You can’t lose your home for failing to make payments, 
because there are none. Reverse mortgages are non-recourse 
loans, which means that the lender can’t take your home if you 
default on the loan.
Determing whether a reverse 
mortgage is right for you
To consider whether a reverse mortgage may make sense for you, 
consider the following:
 
✓ Start with nonfinancial considerations. Do you want to keep 
your current home and neighborhood? What’s your comfort 
level with the size of your home and the associated upkeep? 
Consider whether you want to stay in your home for the 
foreseeable future or would rather tap into your home’s equity 
by moving and downsizing to a smaller home or by simply 
renting.
 
✓ Discuss your explorations and concerns with your family. 
Make sure everyone is aware of the range of options. 
Discussion and brainstorming may lead you to a better 
solution.
 
✓ Understand what a reverse mortgage can do for you compared 
to a home equity loan. Part of the appeal of a reverse mortgage 
is the lack of attractive alternatives if you’d like to stay in your 
home. For example, with a home equity loan, the big challenges 
are qualifying for a loan when you have limited income and 
making the required payments when you do get a loan. Home 
equity loans are recourse loans, which means that if you’re 
unable to keep up with payments later in retirement, the 
lender can foreclose.

157
 Chapter 8: Making Important Housing Decisions 
 
 Also know that any money invested generating investment 
income would be taxed. Most seniors don’t like taking risks 
with their investments, so invested home equity money would 
be unlikely to generate high enough returns to cover the loan’s 
interest costs.

Looking At Tax Issues Regarding 
Your Housing Decisions
Whenever you approach the decision as to what to do with your 
home, you should explore your options and be aware of important 
tax issues that come into play. That’s what we discuss in this 
section.
Being aware of capital 
gains exclusion rules
When you sell your home, you may be able to shelter a substantial 
amount of capital gains (the difference between your home’s 
selling price and what you paid for it plus improvements over the 
years) that you have in the property.

158
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
How much? You can avoid capital gains taxes on up to $250,000 
of profit if you own the property as a single person and up to 
$500,000 for married couples who file their taxes jointly. Profits 
that exceed these amounts are taxed at the relatively low long-term 
capital gains tax rates, which max out at just 15 percent at the 
federal level. (Beware, however, that Congress can bump this rate 
up in their efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit.) You may 
use this tax exclusion once every two years. And, you must have 
used the home as your principal residence for at least two of the 
previous five years in order for it to qualify.
Converting your home 
to a rental: Yes or no?
Selling your home may take longer than you expected, particularly 
if you try to sell during a slumping real estate market as many 
parts of the country experienced in the late 2000s. If you overprice 
your home, you also may experience some delay in selling your 
home.
To help improve their cash flow if their house is sitting vacant, 
some home sellers rent the home while trying to sell it. Tread 
lightly here, because this tactic can cause you major tax trouble.
 
If you stop trying to sell your home and continue renting it, the 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers that you’ve converted 
your home into a rental property. If you then sell the property, it 
no longer will be eligible for the home ownership capital gains tax 
exclusion (see the previous section) when it wasn’t your principal 
residence during at least two of the five years preceding the sale. In 
this case, your profit from the sale will be taxable.
 
You may be able to shelter your rental property sale profits from 
capital gains taxation. You need to do a so-called like-kind, 1031 
Starker exchange. Check out Eric’s book Real Estate Investing 
For Dummies (Wiley) for more details, and be sure to consult a 
competent tax advisor as well.

Insurance Needs and Options
In This Chapter
▶ Discovering long-term care and your options for financing it
▶ Looking at long-term care insurance
▶ Financing your long-term care with personal assets
▶ Choosing a combination policy
M
any Americans in or nearing retirement have two great 
fears according to surveys: running out of money and need-
ing long-term care (LTC) if they’re unable to care for themselves. 
These fears are related. After all, long-term care can be expensive, 
causing you to run out of money and placing a financial burden on 
your loved ones.
Fortunately, running out of money because of your need for long-
term care isn’t inevitable. With a better understanding of long-term 
care and some planning, you can dramatically reduce the possibil-
ity of either of these fears coming true. Many people don’t plan 
properly, because long-term care financing options can be confus-
ing. Also, long-term care insurance (LTCI) seems expensive, so 
folks put it off.
In this chapter, we define long-term care and explore the different 
ways to finance it. We also examine long-term care policies and 
show you how to reduce their cost by adjusting their terms.

160
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
Understanding Long-Term Care
Long-term care may mean something different to every person. 
Basically the term covers any assistance you may need with your 
day-to-day living. The forms of long-term care depend on the level 
of assistance you need, which we cover in the upcoming section. 
Planning for LTC is an important decision you need to consider 
when you’re putting together your retirement plan. The follow-
ing sections help by looking at when you may need LTC and how 
much it can potentially cost.
The evolution of long-term care
The concept of long-term care (LTC) is 
relatively new and still evolving. The first 
nursing homes in the United States prob-
ably were formed in the 1950s. Nursing 
home care and LTC used to be inter-
changeable. Later in the 1980s, assisted 
living facilities took root in the U.S.; home 
care became more structured about the 
same time. Long-term care insurance 
(LTCI) didn’t become a mainstream con-
sumer product until the 1980s.
LTCI policies have been around only a 
few decades. The early policies earned 
a bad reputation because limited defini-
tions of coverage, a high percentage of 
declined policyholder claims, and sub-
stantial premium increases turned off 
consumers. As a result, a small percent-
age of those age 50 and older own LTCI.
Things have changed for the better, 
however — at least among insurers 
that have been offering LTCI for years. 
Among the major insurers, existing 
policyholders face much less risk of 
confusion about covered care and 
less likelihood of significant premium 
increases.
The most widely-used definition of long-
term care focuses on the activities of 
daily living (ADL). The ADL are dress-
ing, bathing, eating, walking, and using 
the bathroom. A widely-used standard 
states that a person needs LTC when 
they require assistance with two or 
more of the ADL. As you can see, LTC 
isn’t restricted to medical care. It usu-
ally is a combination of medical care and 
personal assistance. LTC can range from 
cooking, cleaning, and dressing to physi-
cal therapy, skilled nursing care, and 
administering medication. The phrase 
“long-term care” can be misleading, 
because a person could need help with 
ADL for a relatively brief period while 
recovering from an injury, illness, or 
surgery.

161
 Chapter 9: Considering Your Long-Term Care Insurance Needs and Options 
Naming the types of long-term care
Depending on your needs, you can receive LTC in a number of 
environments. In this section, we discuss the main ways of receiv-
ing LTC. The following four types show different levels of care, 
from least to most care:
 
✓ Independent living: These facilities don’t offer LTC, but 
they’re considered by those who no longer want to live com-
pletely on their own. The facilities generally are apartments 
for those seniors who can live on their own and whose only 
needs are light housekeeping. Independent living facilities 
often offer a number of group activities, activity rooms, rec-
reation facilities, and transportation to local shopping malls, 
doctors’ offices, and other locations. With independent living, 
you don’t receive any medical care and only receive minimal 
services.
 
✓ Home care: Most people want to stay in their homes for as 
long as possible. In home care, an agency often assigns its 
employees to people needing care. Many people, however, 
receive home care from family and friends who provide 
unskilled assistance, often without compensation. Home care 
may be provided for anywhere from a few hours weekly to 24 
hours a day, seven days a week.
 
 When using home care, you need to be confident that the 
agency is screening employees before they’re hired and moni-
toring them to be sure proper care is being delivered.
 
✓ Assisted living: Assisted living often is confused with nursing 
home care. Many people think they’re interchangeable, but 
they aren’t. Assisted living usually is delivered in an apartment-
like building that has on-site services such as dining, physical 
therapy, and limited nursing care, along with a range of social 
and recreational activities. Assisted living is for those who 
need some help with only one or two activities of daily living 
(ADL), not for someone who needs skilled nursing care or a lot 
of help, attention, or rehabilitation. (See the nearby sidebar 
“The evolution of long-term care” for more on ADL.)

162
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
 
 In most states, assisted living facilities usually are loosely reg-
ulated and aren’t required to have significant nursing or other 
medical care on the premises.
 
✓ Nursing homes: A nursing home provides a wide variety of 
services ranging from feeding, dressing, and bathing residents 
to monitoring medical conditions and providing significant 
medical care. They also provide physical therapy. In addition 
to support staff, a nursing home has a large number of health 
care workers, ranging from nurse’s aides to registered nurses. 
Nursing homes usually are heavily regulated and are inspected 
annually by state regulators.
After considering the type of care you need and want, you also can 
look at the different ways care is provided. The following are three 
frequent ways of providing the care:
 
✓ Continuing care communities: These multipurpose com-
munities offer several different kinds of senior care facilities 
in one location, usually independent living, assisted living, 
and a nursing home. You pay a large fee when entering the 
community, plus monthly charges. As you age and more care 
is needed, you can shift from independent living to assisted 
living to a nursing home. Admission at each level of care is 
guaranteed when you need it.
 
 A big advantage of continuing care facilities to married couples 
is that if one spouse needs to move to a higher level of care, the 
other is living a short walk away in the same community.
 
✓ Group homes: For those who don’t want an institutional-like 
setting, a group home provides assisted living services (or 
less) in a single-family home or similar structure. In most 
states, these types of homes undergo a very low level of regu-
lation when the number of residents stays below a maximum 
level, usually from 5 to 15.
 
✓ Stand-alone facilities: These tend to be large facilities that 
provide one type of care, such as a nursing home or assisted 
living facility. When you need a different type of care, you have 
to move to a different facility. For example, you may start in an 
assisted living facility and after a period of years need a higher 
level of care. You would have to move to a nursing home.

163
 Chapter 9: Considering Your Long-Term Care Insurance Needs and Options 
Predicting who will need 
long-term care
You may not need LTC, and if you do ultimately need it, LTC usu-
ally isn’t a stereotypical multiyear stay in a nursing home. In fact, 
the odds of needing extended, extensive LTC in a nursing home 
are lower than most people think — but not negligible. Yet, care 
at home or in an assisted living facility is more likely and will last 
longer than most nursing home stays. In fact, the use of these ser-
vices is growing.
However, with life expectancies increasing, some experts expect 
that a higher percentage of today’s 65-year-olds will need exten-
sive LTC in their lifetimes than their predecessors. The theory is 
that people will live longer and will need assistance during the 
later and traditionally frail years.
 
The statistics regarding long-term care are useful but they’re only 
averages and probabilities. If you’re among the minority who do 
need extended LTC, the cost could rapidly deplete your savings 
and your estate and the averages won’t matter. So, to avoid deplet-
ing your savings and other assets, you need to plan for how to 
finance potential LTC costs.
As averages and probabilities for the population as a whole, the 
numbers on long-term care needs can be misleading because they 
don’t tell how likely it is that you will need LTC. Also, the surveys 
have different ways of defining LTC. Often, a few days in a facil-
ity to receive rehabilitation or physical therapy after surgery is 
counted as LTC when your real concern is an extended need for 
care. However, statistics can still provide you with important infor-
mation. Consider the following statistics:
 
✓ Only about 1 million to 1.5 million Americans are in nursing 
homes, and many of those need only short-term stays for 
rehabilitation after an injury, illness, or surgery. One widely-
reported statistic is that about half of those age 65 today will 
need LTC at some point. So, in a married couple in which both 
partners are age 65, the odds that at least one spouse will 
someday need LTC are about 75 percent.

164
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
 
✓ One study in the health care journal Inquiry (that also was 
reported in the Wall Street Journal) concludes that during their 
lives 69 percent of those who reach age 65 would need LTC. 
The study also concludes, however, that much of the need will 
be for assistance with only one ADL and could be provided by 
a family member at home. (The five ADL are dressing, bath-
ing, eating, walking, and using the bathroom.) The study also 
states that while 37 percent of 65-year-olds will need long-term 
care in either a nursing home or assisted-living facility, most of 
those stays will be for no more than two years. Only 8 percent 
of the group will incur the dreaded and potentially financially 
ruinous stay of five years or more.
 
✓ Over the years, the length of the average stay in a nursing 
home has declined. About half of nursing home stays now are 
for 90 days or less because they’re for short-term rehabilita-
tion after an injury or illness. About three-quarters of nursing 
home stays are estimated to be for less than one year. Even 
those numbers don’t tell the whole story, however. Though 
the average stay in a nursing home is declining, those who 
stay in a nursing home beyond a short-term stay tend to be 
there for a while. The average extended nursing home stay 
lasts more than two years. Even though two years is the aver-
age, many long-term residents are in nursing homes for longer 
than two years. About 9 percent of nursing home stays are for 
five years or more. Women dominate this group by a ratio of 
three to one.
 
✓ Although little data is available on the use of home care 
and assisted living, experts do know that the use of these 
services and facilities seems to be increasing while nursing 
home use is declining. Assisted living and home care also 
tend to last longer than nursing home care for those who 
need them. For example, nonrehabilitative home care lasts 
an average of more than four years. The information also 
doesn’t include people who are cared for by family members 
and friends using their own time and resources instead of 
professional LTC.

165
 Chapter 9: Considering Your Long-Term Care Insurance Needs and Options 
Estimating how much long-term 
care will cost
The potential cost of LTC is a mystery to most Americans. They 
think that it’s expensive, but they don’t know how expensive. So 
when considering and planning for LTC, you want to have a good 
idea of how much it costs in case you (or your spouse) need it 
one day.
In the following sections, we provide you with some average 
annual costs and show you why these estimates should be used 
only as a starting point. We also explain some strategies and tools 
that can help you make informed decisions based on your own 
situation and location.
Looking at average data with a discriminating eye
The good news is that an abundance of research on the cost of 
LTC is available to help you with this calculation. The bad news is 
that these average national figures are of little assistance in your 
final LTC planning. That’s because several factors can affect the 
costs in your situation. In this section, we first show you the aver-
ages, and then we remind you of the factors you need to keep in 
mind when making the final calculations.
On average, a couple in which each partner was 65 years old in 
2009 should expect to spend about $85,000 on LTC during their 
lifetimes, according to estimates in a study done for Fidelity 
Investments. Of course, some couples will spend more and some 
less. About 11 percent of those 65-year-olds will incur long-term 
care costs of $100,000 to $250,000, according to the study. About 5 
percent will incur more than $250,000. Remember: These esti-
mates aren’t entirely out-of-pocket costs; they include amounts 
paid by the government and insurers.
Annual studies of the national average cost of different types 
of LTC also are available. The most-cited studies are done for 
Genworth Financial, a leading provider of LTC insurance. For 

166
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
example, in its 2009 study, Genworth found the average semi-
private nursing home room cost $183 per day, which came to 
about $5,500 per month and $66,000 per year. For assisted living 
the national median monthly cost was approximately $2,825 or 
$33,900 per year. Keep in mind that these are only average esti-
mates for the entire country. Other studies, with similar results, 
are published by John Hancock and Prudential Insurance.
 
Now that you’ve seen the average numbers, we discuss the factors 
that can affect them — and your LTC planning. If you don’t keep the 
following factors in mind, you can come up short, reserve too 
much, or buy too much insurance:
 
✓ You may incur additional costs. The averages we provide 
earlier in the section include only the basic daily rate. These 
daily rates aren’t likely to add up to the final cost. That’s 
because many residents in assisted living facilities and nursing 
homes incur additional costs beyond the basic charge. Typical 
additional costs are for medicines, physical therapy, medical 
care, and personal care expenses. On average, an LTC resident 
incurs additional costs equal to about 20 percent of the basic 
daily rate. Some of these costs may be covered by Medicare or 
other insurance.
 
✓ Costs vary greatly around the country. If you plan for the 
national median cost but incur LTC costs in a high-cost area, 
you won’t have enough money. If you incur LTC costs in a 
low-cost area but plan for the national median, you will have 
diverted too many resources to LTC financing. Plan for LTC 
costs in the area you’re likely to incur them.
 
 Keep this in mind as you determine the area in which you 
plan for LTC: The choice of facility usually is made by an adult 
woman related to the LTC recipient, such as a daughter or 
daughter-in-law. The LTC provider is likely to be located near 
the decision maker. If you don’t live near your adult children 
and don’t determine ahead of time where you would like to 
receive any needed LTC, the costs are likely to be incurred 
near one of your family members. The costs in that area may 
be very different than the costs where you’re living now.
 
✓ Costs rise over time. Most people who plan for LTC do so 
years before they’re likely to need the care. And LTC costs 
have been rising for some time at a rate that’s about double 

167
 Chapter 9: Considering Your Long-Term Care Insurance Needs and Options 
the rate of consumer price inflation. So if your LTC plan relies 
on national averages from years ago, you could be in trouble 
when you have to pay for long-term care later. If the rate of 
cost increases isn’t factored into your plan, it will cover only a 
fraction of the potential costs, and you may run out of money 
to pay for these costs.
Using tools and strategies to calculate 
costs for LTC in your area
Calculating LTC costs according to your situation and where you 
anticipate having any needed long-term care is an important part 
of your financial plan. So, in this section, we provide you with 
some tools and strategies for doing so:
 
✓ Call and visit different types of LTC providers in the area of 
your choice. Narrow down the options to the ones you would 
prefer, and then use their actual costs and anticipated future 
increases in your planning. Ask about the room choices avail-
able (private and semiprivate, for example) and the cost dif-
ferences. Inquire how often rates increased in the past and by 
what percent. Get details of services not included in the daily 
rate and your options for them. For example, does medication 
have to be purchased from their pharmacy, or can you choose 
the pharmacy? Can you select a physical therapist or must 
you use the therapist selected by the facility? Ask how much 
the typical resident pays in addition to the daily rate, and get 
some examples of regular charges.
 
✓ Use Genworth Financial’s annual Cost of Care Survey. In 
2009, Genworth provided a printed version of the survey and 
an interactive Web site with similar information (visit www.
genworth.com). The survey breaks down the cost of long-
term care not only by state but by different regions and cities 
within each state. You can compare the costs of nursing home 
care (private and semiprivate rooms), assisted living, adult day 
health care, and home care. The survey also shows the five-year 
annual growth rate (or inflation rate) for each of these categories.
 
 The Web site also has a couple of useful calculators. One 
allows you to estimate the future cost of care in a particular 
location years from now. You also can compare — on one 
screen — the cost of care, both now and in some future year, 

168
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
in up to four different regions. The Choice and Affordability 
Index shows the median daily rate for each state and where 
the state ranks in affordability and choice (number of facilities 
compared to population age 65 and over).
 
 Our recommendation of this survey isn’t a comment on the 
company’s LTC policies. Also, the point of this discussion isn’t 
to recommend that you purchase a long-term care policy from 
Genworth or any other insurer.
Planning to Pay for LTC
Putting together a clear plan for how you’re going to finance LTC is 
an important decision. You basically have four ways you can pay 
for any LTC you may need:
 
✓ Medicare: Medicare is the health care financing program for 
those age 65 and over. Its LTC coverage is limited to short-
term stays needed for rehabilitation and for some services 
provided in an LTC facility. Details about Medicare are in 
Chapter 11.
 
✓ Medicaid: Medicaid is a program for the poor and will pro-
vide nursing home coverage only for seniors with limited 
income and assets. It doesn’t cover assisted living. We review 
Medicaid in detail in Chapter 12.
 
✓ Private insurance: An LTCI policy can be an individual policy 
or a group policy, which usually is purchased through your 
employer. We discuss these in the next section.
 
✓ Personal funds: These are your (and your family’s) savings 
and investments. Using this source to pay for LTC often is 
called self-financing. Any LTC not paid for by the other three 
sources will be paid from personal funds. We review invest-
ments in Chapter 7 and self-financing later in this chapter.
In the rest of this chapter, we examine private insurance and 
self-financing.

169
 Chapter 9: Considering Your Long-Term Care Insurance Needs and Options 
Considering LTC Insurance
One option you have to pay for LTC is through private LTC insur-
ance (LTCI). This insurance is fairly standardized; the policy 
covers care under one of two events:
 
✓ Some policies cover LTC after a licensed medical professional 
certifies the insured needs LTC.
 
✓ Other policies require a certification stating that the insured 
needs assistance to perform at least two of the five ADL, which 
are dressing, bathing, eating, walking, and using the bathroom. 
Certification usually comes from the insured’s doctor.
An LTCI policy can be expensive, and premiums rise steadily as the 
insured ages. For example, a 40-year-old probably will pay $1,000 
annually in premiums, a 50-year-old would pay about $1,500. For a 
married couple in their 60s, the total cost to insure each spouse is 
likely to be about $2,000 or more annually. However, cost shouldn’t 
be the only issue you consider. The premiums for an LTCI policy, 
after all, are a small share of the potential cost of LTC.
In this section, we discuss the key policy provisions of LTCI and how 
you can adjust them to get the coverage you need at the best price.
Knowing the basic features of LTCI
In order to get a firm grasp on LTCI, you need a good understand-
ing of what policies usually cover. The following list outlines 
important core features of most LTCI policies:
 
✓ Care needed as a result of Alzheimer’s disease or other forms 
of dementia is explicitly covered in standard policies.
 
✓ Coverage kicks in even when you didn’t stay in a hospital 
before applying for coverage.
 
✓ LTC is covered whether it’s received at home, in an assisted 
living facility, or in a nursing home.
 
✓ Adult day care usually is covered.

170
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
Insurers that have been in the business for years generally limit 
the premium increases imposed on existing shareholders; how-
ever, no limits are set in the policies. After a policy is purchased, 
premium increases aren’t imposed on an individual based on age 
or changes in medical condition. Instead, premiums for an entire 
class of policyholders may be increased based on the insurer’s 
claims experience or other factors.
 
Most people initially are asked to consider “gold-plated” policies. 
With these policies, coverage is broad, but premiums are high. 
Don’t automatically assume they’re the best option for you. They 
may offer more coverage than you need or can afford. Luckily, 
many of the key policy terms can be adjusted. By adjusting the 
terms, you can obtain solid coverage at a reasonable cost. Your 
insurance agent or broker can show you how changing the terms 
changes the premium.
The following sections look at key policy provisions and how you 
can use them to adjust both your coverage and premiums.
Daily benefit
The coverage on an LTCI is stated as a daily benefit or reimburse-
ment, such as $150 per day of covered care. The policy usually has 
separate daily benefit levels for the different types of care: adult 
day care (if it’s covered), home care, assisted living, and nursing 
home care. (Refer to the earlier section “Naming the types of long-
term care.”) Nursing home care has the highest daily rate, and the 
others have lower rates. Sometimes the other types of care have a 
specified daily rate. Other times their rates are expressed as a per-
centage of the nursing home rate.
 
After doing your research on the likely cost of LTC (see the earlier 
section “Estimating how much long-term care will cost”), you’ll 
have a target amount in mind. Don’t forget that you’re likely to 
incur additional costs on top of the basic daily room rate. And be 
sure to consider cost inflation. After all, the cost of LTC has been 
rising faster than general price inflation for some time. We discuss 
inflation protection in more detail later in the chapter.

171
 Chapter 9: Considering Your Long-Term Care Insurance Needs and Options 
The insurer usually allows you to choose from a range of daily 
benefit amounts in increments of $25 or $50 per day. To obtain 
full coverage, choose a daily benefit that equals or exceeds your 
estimate of the likely standard daily care rate plus extra costs not 
included in the daily rate, as discussed earlier in this chapter. 
Doing so ensures that the insurer covers the entire cost of care 
once the policy’s coverage kicks in. Unfortunately, insuring for the 
likely full cost of care is often expensive.
 
Your premium can be reduced by choosing a lower daily benefit. 
For example, your estimated cost may be $150 per day. You could 
choose a daily benefit of $125, meaning the insurer would pay that 
amount, leaving your personal income and assets to cover the 
other $25 per day as long as care is needed. You would choose this 
route if it appears that your income or assets could pay for that 
much of the care or if the premiums for a higher level of coverage 
are too high for you to afford.
To reduce the cost of inflation protection, you could insure for a 
higher daily benefit than you’re likely to incur. Insurers tend to 
charge more for inflation protection than for a higher daily benefit. 
We discuss this method in more detail later in the section on infla-
tion protection.
Waiting period
The waiting period provision of a policy, which also is known as 
the deductible or elimination period, is the length of time for which 
you pay for your own LTC before the policy starts paying ben-
efits. For example, suppose your policy has a waiting period of 90 
days. You receive certification from your doctor that you need 
LTC as defined in the policy. You begin LTC, whether at home, in 
an assisted living facility, or in a nursing home. After you pay the 
full cost of the care for 90 days, the LTCI begins coverage, paying 
whatever the daily benefit is.
Most insurers offer waiting periods from 0 to 365 days, though 
a few offer longer waiting periods. The most frequently selected 
waiting period appears to be 90 days.

172
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
 
Selecting a long waiting period is similar to selecting a high deduct-
ible on an auto or homeowner’s insurance policy. The longer the 
waiting period, the lower your premiums will be. If you want a low-
cost policy that protects you only from a long-term catastrophic 
claim, select a waiting period of 365 days. In this case, your per-
sonal assets and income must be able to pay for all your required 
care in the first year. A long waiting period also can be used to 
enhance the other policy terms, such as the daily benefit or lifetime 
benefit limit, without dramatically increasing premiums.
Benefit period
The benefit period is the length of time the insurer will pay the 
daily benefit, which we describe earlier in the chapter. A “gold-
plated” LTCI policy guarantees to pay the daily benefit for life. This 
type of policy is a tremendous solace for those unfortunate folks 
who end up spending many years in LTC. But only a minority of 
people need lifetime LTC or even LTC longer than five years (see 
the earlier section “Predicting who will need long-term care”), so 
choose wisely.
 
An unlimited lifetime benefit period drives up the cost of premiums 
and could make LTCI unaffordable. For example, with most insurers, 
reducing the benefit period from unlimited to five years cuts the 
premium by 25 percent annually. A three-year benefit period makes 
the premium about half of the unlimited lifetime benefit period.
The potential disadvantage of the shorter benefit period is that 
you may end up being in the minority of those needing extended 
LTC. If so, after the LTCI benefits are exhausted, personal and 
family income or assets must be used to pay for the care. The 
only consolation in this situation is that after exhausting personal 
assets, you would qualify for Medicaid, as described in Chapter 12.
 
One strategy is to coordinate your LTCI with Medicaid. You must 
give away or transfer assets more than five years before applying 
for Medicaid if you want to preserve them for your family instead of 
spending them on LTC (check out Chapter 13 for more information 
on this strategy). You can select a five-year benefit period and 
assume you would be able to rearrange your assets about the time 
you begin LTC. Then, when the policy benefits are exhausted, you 
can apply for Medicaid.

173
 Chapter 9: Considering Your Long-Term Care Insurance Needs and Options 
Inflation protection
The cost of LTC rises steadily, and for years it increased at a rate 
about twice that of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Fortunately, 
LTCI policies offer inflation protection clauses, and they’re key to 
making the policies valuable.
 
The younger you are, the more important strong inflation protec-
tion is. Some policies today offer inflation protection tied to the CPI, 
but in the end this may not be the right choice for you. This type of 
inflation protection reduces premiums, but it’s also likely to pro-
vide less protection. Instead, the inflation protection should be 
pegged to changes in the cost of LTC or medical expenses.
LTCI policies generally offer the following two types of inflation 
protection:
 
✓ Simple interest protection: This method is cheaper, but it’s 
much less effective, especially for younger people. Suppose 
you have simple interest protection and inflation is 5 percent 
each year. Your daily benefit limit is $100. Because 5 percent 
of $100 is $5, your daily benefit increases by $5 each year. The 
cost of LTC, however, increases at a compound rate. If the 
$100 daily charge increases by $5 each year, the cost is $105 
after one year, $110.25 after two years, $115.76 after three 
years, and so on. After a number of decades, the difference 
becomes significant.
 
✓ Compound interest protection: This method is more expen-
sive but more beneficial, because it matches the compound 
increases in actual costs.
 
Although the difference between simple and compound interest is 
small initially, after many years the difference amounts to thou-
sands of dollars annually in potential benefits.
 
Most insurers limit inflation protection to a maximum of 5 percent 
annually. You can select a lower inflation cap to reduce premiums, 
but you shouldn’t unless you anticipate being able to make up the 
difference with your personal assets or income or want to bet that 
cost increases in LTC will slow down.

174
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
A better way to enhance inflation protection may be to increase 
your daily benefit limit. This is especially true if you’re older, say 
around age 70. Have your broker compare the cost of inflation 
protection to a higher daily benefit — around the daily cost you 
expect in 10 or 15 years. With some insurers, you’ll find that a 
significantly higher daily benefit limit is cheaper than compound 
inflation protection.
Covered care and expenses
You’re likely to find that most types of LTC are covered and that 
the definitions of covered care are less subjective than a decade or 
two ago. Even so, you still need to understand what’s covered and 
what’s excluded. When comparing policies, you should review the 
coverage sections for important differences.
The good news: The coverage limitations tend to be similar among 
the major insurers now. Make sure your policy covers the following:
 
✓ Medically necessary care: You want to ensure that the policy 
you choose covers medically necessary long-term care. The 
term medically necessary basically means that a doctor or 
other health professional certifies that the insured needs help 
with two or more of the five ADL. A written plan of care also 
may be required for coverage to kick in.
 
 You don’t want a policy that lists the specific diseases or con-
ditions that result in coverage. In such policies, too often care 
is needed but not covered; or sometimes it’s easy for the 
insurer to decline coverage and force the insured to appeal 
the decision.
 
✓ Skilled and custodial care: You want to be sure the policy 
covers both skilled and custodial care. The need for LTC may 
be the result of a physical or medical condition, which would 
require the skilled care of health care professionals. However, 
most of the care needed is nonmedical, so it doesn’t require 
skilled nursing care. Instead, the person may need help with 
ADL or may simply need to be observed to prevent accidents 
and injuries. These types of care are custodial.

175
 Chapter 9: Considering Your Long-Term Care Insurance Needs and Options 
 
✓ Adult day care: This type is a relatively new covered care. It 
generally gives adults a place to be during the day where they 
are fed, have activities available, and are observed. Usually no 
medical and limited custodial care is offered. Decide whether 
you want this coverage.
 
✓ Home care: This care is standard in today’s policies; however, 
if possible, try to avoid a policy that limits home care to “pro-
fessional home-care services” or something similar. Someone 
who needs custodial care that can be provided in the home 
likely needs help with basic daily chores such as cooking and 
cleaning, as opposed to medical services.
 
 A member of your family or a trusted person outside the 
family may be able to provide nonmedical home care. If the 
policy doesn’t limit the source of care, the family member or 
friend can be paid from the insurance for the services. But if 
the policy limits covered care to that which is provided by a 
professional, only someone with a professional certification, 
such as a nurse’s aid or registered nurse, can be reimbursed.
 
✓ Alzheimer’s and dementia care: People used to run into prob-
lems receiving coverage for care resulting from Alzheimer’s 
disease or other forms of dementia. Policies either didn’t 
cover the care or required a hospital stay before any care was 
covered. Now, LTC needed as a result of Alzheimer’s or other 
dementia is specifically covered in most policies — and a hos-
pital stay isn’t required before coverage.
Checking out two more 
important LTCI factors
When you’re thinking of obtaining an LTCI policy, you also need 
to contemplate two additional factors that aren’t part of the policy 
but need careful consideration before choosing a policy. The fol-
lowing sections explain.

176
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
The insurer’s financial stability
An LTCI policy is a long-term commitment. You want to be confident 
that the insurer will be able to pay for covered care when you need 
it — even if that means decades from now. Theoretically you can 
switch policies if the insurer has financial problems, but you can’t 
rely on that option. Changes in your health status or the market 
may make it difficult to obtain a new policy (or at least an affordable 
one). Instead of taking those risks, choose an insurer that appears 
to be financially stable, even if the policy doesn’t have the lowest 
premiums.
So what can you do to ensure that an insurer is financially stable? 
Examine the following about the insurer:
 
✓ The insurer’s ratings from major ratings firms: Five firms are 
recognized for their ratings of the financial stability of insur-
ers: A.M. Best Company; Fitch IBCA, Duff & Phelps; Moody’s 
Investor Service, Inc.; Standard & Poor’s Insurance Rating 
Services; and Weiss Ratings, Inc. Each of these firms has a Web 
site. Any agent or broker offering you a policy also can pro-
vide the financial ratings. Ratings often are available in public 
libraries and from state insurance commissioners. The ratings 
aren’t guarantees or free from error, but they’re the best tool 
you have. Each firm has its own rating scale, so you have to 
understand each firm’s system to know what a rating means. 
Make sure the insurer has only top ratings from more than one 
service.
 
✓ The insurer’s underwriting process: The underwriting pro-
cess is the medical screening process that the insurer uses to 
assess eligibility. Experienced LTC insurers conduct a medical 
review and don’t offer policies to people with health condi-
tions or histories that indicate high or early claims. Other 
insurers that have little experience or that are trying to boost 
market share conduct superficial or no medical screenings. 
Those are the insurers who are most likely to run into finan-
cial trouble or to significantly increase premiums because 
claims are higher than they anticipated. If the insurer doesn’t 
conduct a meaningful medical screening before offering you a 
policy, consider that a red flag about the quality of its under-
writing process.

177
 Chapter 9: Considering Your Long-Term Care Insurance Needs and Options 
 
 Of course, if you desire an LTC policy but have some medical 
issues, you may be able to only get coverage from an insurer 
that does a less thorough screening. (Another option is 
group policies through your employer, which are required to 
take everyone regardless of current health conditions.) That 
said, answer all questions honestly because if the insurer 
can show that you lied on your application, you can be later 
denied coverage.
 
✓ The insurer’s premium compared to other insurers: 
Significantly lower premiums than the competition are most 
likely the result of inexperience or an effort to boost market 
share. Expect significant future premium increases on policies 
with low initial premiums. It isn’t unusual for the premiums to 
become so high that most policyholders let their policies lapse.
 
Most insurers who have been issuing LTCI for a while are financially 
sound. Even in the financial crisis of the late 2000s, the insurance 
companies issuing LTCI policies didn’t run into trouble paying 
claims. That’s because insurers must have reserves of a certain 
level available to pay claims, and state regulatory agencies inevita-
bly step in to merge failing insurers into healthy ones.
The history of premium increases
Some of the long-time LTC insurers boast that they haven’t 
increased premiums or rarely increase them. What they mean is 
they don’t increase premiums on individual shareholders because 
they’re older or their health has changed. They generally do 
increase the premiums on an entire class of policyholders, how-
ever. The better LTC insurers keep these increases low.
 
If the increases are frequent or large, it means the insurer isn’t good 
at estimating its future claims experience or is mismanaging its 
investment portfolio. Insurers that do poor jobs in those two areas 
have a history of inflicting double-digit percentage premium 
increases on their LTC policyholders.
 
You don’t want to let an LTC policy lapse because the premiums 
become so high they’re unaffordable. To avoid this situation, check 
the premium increase history of the insurer. You want to see the 
history both for the class of policy that you’re buying and for the 

178
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
portfolio of LTC policies the insurer has in force. The insurance 
company or broker should provide a history of rate increases for 
the type of policy being considered. The state insurance depart-
ment also can provide a premium increase history.
Financing LTC Yourself
If you don’t finance LTC with government programs, such as 
Medicare or Medicaid, or private insurance, your other option is 
self insurance. Self insurance means paying for all the care out of 
your income and assets as the costs arise. Financing your own LTC 
isn’t for everyone though. The following sections identify whether 
this option is right for you, and, if so, a couple options you may 
consider.
Figuring out whether you can 
finance your own LTC
Before you drop large amounts of money to pay for your own LTC, 
make sure doing so is a wise decision. We create two broad catego-
ries of people in this section to help you make this determination:
 
✓ Individuals of very modest means: If you’re in this group, 
paying for your own LTC probably isn’t feasible and isn’t the 
best way to spend your limited amount of funds. The cost of 
LTCI would take too much of your annual income for it to be 
affordable. The good news: Medicaid was created to provide 
LTC for this group. The members of this group will spend their 
modest assets until they qualify for Medicaid, and then they 
rely on the government to pay for the rest of their care.
 
✓ Individuals on the opposite end of the wealth spectrum: 
The wealthy may not need LTCI, because they can pay for any 
needed LTC comfortably out of income and assets.
Of course, life isn’t as black and white as these two categories, 
so you may find yourself somewhere in the middle. Where are 
the dividing lines for these two groups? That’s a tough question. 

179
 Chapter 9: Considering Your Long-Term Care Insurance Needs and Options 
You need to look at the following factors when considering 
whether you can self-finance your LTC:
 
✓ Where the LTC will be received: The cost of care differs 
greatly between New York City and Wichita, for example. A 
person worth $2 million may be able to fund several years of 
LTC easily in Wichita but not in New York City.
 
✓ The type of assets you own: A significant portion of your wealth 
should be easily converted to cash for self insurance to be feasi-
ble. Someone who owns a business or some types of real estate 
has valuable assets, but these assets aren’t easy to convert to 
cash. The person’s liquid assets may be relatively low and may 
be depleted quickly when LTC is added to the other demands 
on the budget. In order to pay for the care in this situation, the 
person may be forced to sell the business or real estate — and 
sell it in a hurry. Selling in a hurry often means selling for less 
than full value. An alternative is to assume debt.
 
✓ Inflation: During retirement years when most folks are invest-
ing more conservatively, the cost of LTC likely is rising faster 
than your net worth. You may be able to finance LTC today 
without much of a problem, but what about 15 years from 
now? If the cost of LTC increases at recent rates, it could be 
a much higher percentage of your net worth than it is today. 
(Refer to the earlier section “Estimating how much long-term 
care will cost” for more information.) After the investment 
market downturn of the late 2000s, you should realize your 
current net worth may not be a floor amount. Events out 
of your control could cause a decline in your assets over a 
number of years. The declines could be temporary, but that 
doesn’t help if you need LTC when asset values are low.
 
Because of these factors, financial advisors differ on who should 
consider self insurance. Self insurance means deciding to retain risk 
instead of shifting it to an insurer. If you decide to retain risk 
instead of buying an LTCI policy, you need to do the following:
 
1. Consider how much LTCI would cost.
 
 Review the previous sections of this chapter about estimating 
the cost of LTC. After estimating the daily cost, compute how 
much a year or two would cost. Then, consider inflation over 

180
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
5, 10, and 15 years. Are these amounts you’re comfortable 
self insuring?
 
2. Assess the probability of needing LTC and its total cost.
 
 Maybe you could easily absorb the entire cost of one year 
of LTC without significantly damaging your net worth or 
diminishing what’s left for your loved ones. But what if you’re 
among the relatively small number of people who need LTC 
for five years or more?
 
 Some advisors believe a wealthy person always should buy 
LTCI instead of self insuring, because the cost of the insurance 
is so low compared to the potential damage extended LTC 
could do to his or her net worth.
 
 Regardless of which end of the wealth spectrum you’re nearest 
to, read Chapter 12 carefully before choosing self insurance. 
In that chapter, we explain how to qualify for Medicaid. We 
also give some reasons you may not want to rely on Medicaid 
to fund your LTC. Also, be sure to head to Chapter 3 to 
determine how long your assets may last in retirement.
Deciding when to buy LTCI
People interested in buying LTCI understandably have trouble 
deciding the best age to buy a policy. Trade-offs abound in this 
decision, so it’s difficult to quantify the differences between them. 
In this section, we offer the main points to consider when making 
the decision.
 
The basic trade off is this: The younger you are, the lower your 
annual premiums will be; but the younger you are, the longer you’ll 
pay premiums before receiving any benefits. An early purchase 
increases the lifetime cost of the insurance because of the many 
years spent paying premiums.
Another reason to consider waiting is you may be able to invest 
the money that would have been paid on premiums to earn a 
return higher than the increases in premiums — or at least a high 
enough return for the delay to make sense.

181
 Chapter 9: Considering Your Long-Term Care Insurance Needs and Options 
Having said all that, the following points favor buying a policy 
sooner rather than later:
 
✓ Each year you wait, the initial premiums are higher simply 
because you’re older and more likely to need LTC.
 
✓ Each year you wait, you risk paying higher premiums for other 
reasons. Insurers change and modify their policies every few 
years. The changes tend to result in higher premiums for 
the same level of benefits as the previous policies. So, you 
pay higher premiums not only because you’re older but also 
because insurers paid higher claims than expected on older 
policies and make up for it by raising premiums on new policies.
 
 Advisor Insurance Resource, an insurance broker, estimates 
that the product life cycle increases costs about 3 percent 
every three to five years. As the Baby Boomers age, if insurers 
find they’re paying substantially more in claims than they esti-
mated, premiums for late purchasers could soar.
 
✓ Each year you wait, you take the risk that an adverse change 
in your health makes you uninsurable or insurable only at a 
substantially higher premium.
 
✓ Each year you wait, you risk developing a need for LTC with-
out having a policy in place.
 
✓ Each year you wait also means that because of inflation you’ll 
be buying a higher daily benefit limit than you would have in 
the past. This increase in the daily benefit limit raises the ini-
tial premium.
 
You can construct a matrix or spreadsheet to quantify most of 
these factors. Advisor Insurance Resource has done exactly that, 
and the analysis is on the company’s Web site at www.advisor
insuranceresource.com. The analysis found that in most cases, 
if you’re 50 or older and won’t be able to invest the premium money 
to earn at least 5 percent annually after taxes, it makes sense to buy 
the policy now rather than waiting. Even if you’re able to invest the 
money profitably, it still makes sense most of the time to buy now. 
The analysis doesn’t include the nonquantifiable factors, such as 
higher than historic premium increases and insurability.

182
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
Comparing tax-qualified and 
nonqualified policies
When buying individual LTCI, you can choose between tax-
qualified and nonqualified policies. The following highlights these 
two types of policies:
 
✓ Tax-qualified policy: Under a 1996 law, premiums on tax-
qualified policies became deductible as medical expenses up 
to an annual limit that’s indexed for inflation. The law, which 
still holds today, clearly states that any benefits received 
under a tax-qualified policy are tax free. A policy must have 
certain terms and provisions to be tax-qualified. Key terms are 
discussed later in this section.
 
✓ Nonqualified policy: This is any LTC policy that doesn’t meet 
the definition of a tax-qualified policy under the 1996 law. The 
1996 law didn’t clear up the tax status of nonqualified policies. 
The ongoing assumptions of most advisors are that premiums 
on nonqualified policies aren’t deductible as medical expenses 
but that benefits probably are tax free.
Tax-qualified policies provide a few advantages not generally avail-
able through nonqualified policies. Tax-qualified policies were 
only just created in 1996, so we don’t have a lot of experience with 
them. However, here are some factors you want to consider about 
qualified policies:
 
✓ The tax deductions are limited by the insured’s age. In 2010 
the maximum premium deductions were as follows:
 
• Age 40 and under: $330
 
• Ages 41–51: $620
 
• Ages 51–60: $1,230
 
• Ages 61–70: $3,290
 
• Age 71 and over: $4,110
 
 The amounts are indexed for inflation, and the most recent 
amounts can be found in IRS Publication 502 each year.

183
 Chapter 9: Considering Your Long-Term Care Insurance Needs and Options 
 
✓ The premiums are deductible only by those who itemize 
expenses on Schedule A. The premiums also are lumped in 
with other medical expenses, meaning that only the total medi-
cal expenses exceeding 7.5 percent of adjustable gross income 
are deductible.
 
✓ Qualified policies have less flexibility. They have certain 
required terms and provisions. A qualified policy must pay 
benefits only if the insured can’t perform at least two of the 
five ADL (dressing, bathing, eating, walking, and using the 
bathroom) or is suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. In addi-
tion, a doctor must certify that care will be needed for more 
than 90 days. A nonqualified policy, on the other hand, may 
pay benefits if the insured has a “medical necessity,” and a 
minimum need period of 90 days isn’t required.
 
 Because of the restricted terms of qualified policies, a non-
qualified policy generally costs 5 percent to 20 percent more 
than a comparable qualified one. Insurers supposedly expect 
to pay 20 percent to 40 percent fewer claims under the tax-
qualified policies, so they charge lower premiums.
 
You must decide whether the trade-offs make a tax-qualified policy 
or a nonqualified policy the better choice. Our advice is to shop for a 
policy with the terms you want and buy it. If it’s tax-qualified, that’s a 
nice bonus. But you may find you want a nonqualified policy because 
of its broader coverage and freedom to choose all the terms.
Opting for life insurance 
instead of LTCI
Self insuring doesn’t necessarily mean that your loved ones will 
be left without an inheritance if you need extended LTC. You can 
choose to buy life insurance instead of LTCI. Life insurance is 
much cheaper than LTCI for most people, even when you buy per-
manent insurance instead of term insurance.
 
One advantage of life insurance for many people is they know it will 
pay benefits. LTCI pays only if you need LTC that’s covered by the 
policy. You may pay premiums for decades and never file a claim. 

184
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
On the other hand, you know that someday the life insurance policy 
will pay benefits to your beneficiaries. If you don’t have LTCI, end 
up needing LTC, and the cost depletes your estate, your loved ones 
inherit the life insurance benefits. If you don’t need LTC, your loved 
ones inherit both your estate and the life insurance benefits. 
(Chapter 2 provides more information on life insurance.)
 
Think twice about this strategy of buying life insurance instead of 
LTCI if you’re married. LTC could dissipate your income and assets, 
leaving your spouse in financial difficulty before any life insurance 
benefits are received. Another possibility, though a slim one, is that 
you could spend all your assets on LTC, recover, and be able to live 
independently. Then, at that point you would have no assets and 
would depend on welfare, Medicaid, and your loved ones.
Taking advantage of 
the reverse mortgage
Another way you can finance your own LTC is with your home 
equity. Home equity can pay for LTC without your having to move 
or sell the home. In a reverse mortgage, also known as a home 
equity conversion mortgage, a homeowner who has little or no debt 
on the residence receives a loan. The loan can be a lump sum, 
annuity, or line of credit. No payments are due during the owner’s 
lifetime as long as they own the home. After the home is sold or 
the owner dies, the lender is paid from the proceeds of the sale. 
(See Chapter 8 for a deeper discussion of the reverse mortgage.)
After beginning LTC, you can take out a reverse mortgage to pay 
for the care. In this case, your home wouldn’t be available for your 
heirs to inherit, but it could mean your other assets are preserved. 
Reverse mortgages can be guaranteed by Fannie Mae and the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development. Private, nonguar-
anteed reverse mortgages also are available.
 
Although reverse mortgages may help finance your LTC, they’re 
quite expensive. The fees and other expenses are steeper than for 
conventional mortgages and home equity loans. Because the 
lender doesn’t know how long you’ll live, it estimates your life 

185
 Chapter 9: Considering Your Long-Term Care Insurance Needs and Options 
expectancy plus a cushion when deciding how much to lend. As a 
result, the older you are, the greater the percentage of the home’s 
value you’re able to borrow. The expenses and interest will com-
pound during your lifetime, limiting the amount of the loan you 
receive in cash.
 
If you’re a homeowner considering a reverse mortgage, wait until 
you’re in your late 70s or older. (The typical reverse mortgage bor-
rower is a single woman in her late 70s.)
Evaluating Employer 
and Group Coverage
Another option you may have for obtaining LTCI is to look at what 
your employer offers. Some employers offer group long-term care 
policies. Employers rarely pay the premiums for you, but they use 
their purchasing power to negotiate favorable terms and premi-
ums. If your employer offers this option, carefully compare the 
employer or other group policy with individual policies before 
choosing.
The following are some advantages of going with an employer-
sponsored plan:
 
✓ You’re less likely to be denied coverage for health problems 
under a group policy. Usually requirements of the plan are 
that all employees who apply must be accepted and must pay 
the same premium (or the same premium as everyone in their 
age group).
 
✓ Premiums for an employer or group policy are likely to be 
lower than for comparable individual policies. That’s the 
advantage of group buying power and lower sales costs for the 
insurer.
 
✓ The employer checks out the insurer and negotiates the 
basic policy provisions. The employer also negotiates prices 
for optional terms and riders. You’re saved a lot of work, and 
the employer probably can negotiate better terms.

186
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
Group policies aren’t without disadvantages, though:
 
✓ Your choices are limited. Earlier in this chapter we examine 
policy terms you can change to reduce premiums or fit your 
needs (see the section “Knowing the basic features of LTCI”). 
Those options usually are limited in a group policy. The lim-
ited choices are one way the cost of group policies is reduced. 
The reduced choices aren’t a problem unless you want or 
need a term that isn’t available.
 
 For example, the group LTC policy offered (at one time, at 
least) to federal government employees automatically set a 
reimbursement rate for home health care of 75 percent of 
the nursing home daily rate. That may not accurately reflect 
the differential between home care and nursing home care in 
your area.
 
✓ Group policies aren’t always less expensive. All applicants 
must be accepted. A work force may have higher risks than 
the general population, or the group policy may attract people 
who have difficulty qualifying for individual policies. Those 
factors can raise the premiums. A healthy or younger person 
may be able to get cheaper rates through an individual policy.
 
Employees who are offered LTCI through an employer’s group 
policy will be accepted without any evidence of insurability. This 
means that even if you have a terminal illness, you can’t be denied 
coverage. This is extremely valuable for those with serious or 
chronic illnesses because such individuals would not be able to get 
LTCI through an individual LTCI policy.
 
A married couple buying two individual policies from the same 
insurer often gets a premium discount of up to 20 percent. That dis-
count isn’t available under most group plans.
Examining Combination Policies
Despite marketing efforts, sales of LTCI are relatively low. Fewer 
than 5 percent of Americans age 50 and older own LTCI. A major 
objection of potential buyers is that they could pay premiums for 
years, even decades, and not receive any benefits from the policy if 

187
 Chapter 9: Considering Your Long-Term Care Insurance Needs and Options 
they don’t need extended LTC. After all, if half of those currently age 
65 will need LTC at some point in their lives, that means half won’t. 
As a result, you have a 50 percent chance that you’ll pay the high 
premiums of LTCI with no direct benefit. Also, as we report earlier 
in this chapter, most LTC needs are for reasonably short times. Only 
a small percentage of people need LTC for extended periods.
 
To overcome the objection, insurers combine LTCI with other forms 
of insurance that will pay benefits, such as life insurance and annui-
ties. Congress enhanced the attractiveness of these policies with the 
Pension Protection Act of 2006. This act provides the following:
 
✓ Funds withdrawn from the policies in 2010 or later to pay for 
LTC won’t be taxable, regardless of when the policies were 
purchased.
 
✓ Life insurance will retain its tax advantages even when com-
bined with LTCI.
The issue for you as a potential consumer is how to evaluate one 
of these combination policies when evaluating stand-alone LTCI 
is complicated enough. The following sections point out what you 
need to know.
Reviewing the new policies
The combination policies may be a way to obtain LTCI when a 
person’s health makes it difficult to qualify for a traditional LTCI 
policy. Many versions of these combination policies are available, 
but they all have some common frameworks. Here we outline the 
basics you may come across:
 
✓ Life insurance/LTCI combination: When a life insurance 
policy is combined with LTCI, it’s a permanent life policy and 
not a term life policy. The LTCI is a rider that provides that a 
portion of the death benefit is available as an accelerated ben-
efit during the insured’s life if LTC is needed. Usually insurers 
place a limit on the amount that can be withdrawn to pay for 
LTC. Any amount used to pay for LTC is subtracted from the 
death benefit. The premiums for the LTCI rider can be paid 
either as a lump sum or periodic premiums.

188
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
 
✓ Annuity/LTCI combination: When an annuity is combined 
with LTCI, it’s known generically as a life care annuity and is 
purchased with a single premium. One common version pays a 
fixed monthly payment for life, but the payment is increased if 
LTC is needed. Another version doesn’t make lifetime payments. 
Instead, the annuity owner takes distributions to pay for LTC 
as it’s needed, and the beneficiaries receive annuity payments 
if LTC isn’t needed or doesn’t exhaust the annuity. Life care 
annuities have many variations, so these are only a couple of 
examples. Life care annuities usually offer choices of the amount 
of LTC coverage, inflation protection, and the benefit period.
 
LTCI when purchased as part of a combination policy may be less 
expensive than a traditional policy. An individual LTCI policy may 
cost an individual $1,000 annually in premiums, but an LTCI rider to 
a life policy costs only a few hundred dollars.
When LTCI is a rider to a life insurance policy, the insurer focuses 
on the life insurance risks of the applicant. A life insurance company 
is concerned about the possibility of premature death, but an LTCI 
underwriter is concerned about the need for chronic care. The two 
standards can be very different. A physical condition that increases 
the potential for needing LTCI may not have a higher potential of 
premature death, so it won’t bother a life insurance company. 
Evaluating the new policies
When LTCI is combined with another type of insurance, it comes 
with added costs and restrictions and less flexibility. In other words, 
there are trade-offs when you purchase the coverage together 
instead of separately. Before purchasing a combination policy, con-
sider the following questions:
 
✓ Are both coverages needed? An LTCI rider to a life insurance 
policy costs about 20 percent of an individual LTCI policy. So, 
for example, an LTCI policy with an annual premium of $1,300 
compares to an LTCI rider with a premium of $300 annually.
 
 The combination policy may not be the bargain it seems, how-
ever. Permanent life insurance needs include paying estate 
taxes, providing estate liquidity, equalizing inheritance among 

189
 Chapter 9: Considering Your Long-Term Care Insurance Needs and Options 
children (such as when one child will inherit the family busi-
ness but others will not), and increasing your legacy. If you 
have a permanent life insurance need or can’t qualify for a 
straight LTCI policy, a combination policy may be a good deal. 
But if you don’t need the life insurance, you’re buying 
unneeded coverage to get a lower rate on the LTCI rider.
 
✓ Is there enough coverage? The LTCI portion of a combination 
policy generally has lower maximum benefits than stand-alone 
LTCI. The limit is determined by the amount of life insurance 
you buy or your deposit for the annuity. You can spend on 
LTC only a portion of those amounts. First, determine the 
amount of LTC coverage you need, and then evaluate whether 
that coverage is available through a combination policy at a 
reasonable cost.
 
✓ Is there inflation protection? Inflation protection generally 
isn’t available in a combination policy. You need to know this 
information when deciding whether the combination policy 
will provide sufficient coverage and to properly compare 
it to a stand-alone LTCI policy. Refer to the earlier section 
“Knowing the basic features of LTCI” for more on this type of 
protection.
 
✓ Is each segment of the policy satisfactory? When LTCI is a 
sideline, quality could suffer. A good life insurance policy 
may be coupled with an LTC rider with less flexibility and less 
robust features than an individual LTCI policy. Compare the 
features of a combination policy to those of separate policies.
 
✓ Is obtaining LTCI a problem for you? If so, the combination 
policy may be a good option for you to obtain LTCI.
 
✓ How often are premiums paid? Purchasers of LTCI need to 
consider the potential for premium increases. A life insurance 
policy with an LTCI rider often permits either a lump sum pre-
mium or annual premiums. When you pay annual premiums 
for the LTCI rider, the premiums can be adjusted each year. 
If the insurer underestimates how many claims it will pay, it 
will raise premiums in future years. If the insurer doesn’t have 
experience with LTCI, substantial premium increases are likely 
over the years. (See the earlier section “Checking out two 
more important LTCI factors” for more information.)

190
Part II: Making Money Decisions in Retirement 
Combining LTCI and Self Insurance
A good strategy for many people is a combination of LTCI and self 
insurance. Many people don’t have enough current income to pay 
for a benefit-rich LTCI policy. They also usually don’t have enough 
assets and income to self insure all the potential costs of LTC. If 
you’re in this situation, using both strategies can help you cover 
your needs in most cases.
Here are two ways to decide how to combine LTCI and self 
insurance:
 
✓ You can decide the amount of LTCI you can afford or are 
willing to pay for. Adjust the policy terms to receive the best 
coverage for your premium dollars. After you determine the 
coverage, you’ll know how much of your assets and income 
must make up the difference in the cost of LTC.
 
✓ You can estimate how much you would have in assets and 
income to pay for LTC. Project your savings, investment 
returns, and other sources of income. After you make your 
estimations, you try to structure an affordable LTCI policy that 
will cover the LTC that couldn’t be covered by your personal 
resources.
 
Your insurance and assets don’t have to cover all possible LTC 
expenses. Remember that Medicaid is a possibility after assets and 
insurance are exhausted. Chapter 12 gives details of how to qualify. 
Generally, if LTCI and personal assets have paid for five or more 
years of LTC, Medicaid will take over.
 
One strategy used by some married couples is to purchase LTCI 
only for the wife. Statistics indicate that most wives are likely to out-
live their husbands and more likely to need extended LTC. These 
couples decide that the best strategy with limited resources is to 
self insure for the husband and purchase LTCI covering the wife.

S
ocial Security is one of the least understood components of 
senior Americans’ personal finances. Traditionally, income 
during retirement comes from a combination of three sources, 
often referred to as legs of a three-legged stool. The three legs are 
employer pensions, personal savings, and Social Security. Many 
Americans generally take the Social Security leg for granted and 
don’t give it much thought.
However, this leg is quite important as you attempt to get a firm 
grasp on your personal finances. Too few people take the time to 
understand the options and the effects of their decisions about 
Social Security. And, most financial advisors know little about 
Social Security retirement benefits.
That’s why we’re here: To help you get a better grasp of how 
Social Security can affect your finances. This chapter focuses 
on the important decisions involving Social Security retirement 
benefits and how you can make them. We explain how benefits 
are calculated, how to determine the best age at which to begin 
taking benefits, and how having a spouse may affect that decision. 

194
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
Although the benefits once were tax free, an increasing number 
of beneficiaries pay taxes on their benefits each year. So, we also 
explain how to minimize income taxes on your Social Security 
benefits as well. You also can review how working while receiving 
Social Security benefits may cause your benefits to be reduced.
Furthermore we examine the financial condition of Social Security. 
A number of people say they don’t include Social Security benefits 
in their planning, because they don’t expect to receive any ben-
efits. We take a look at the program’s solvency and whether that’s 
a reasonable way to view Social Security benefits and plan your 
retirement finances.
 
Although the Social Security program also offers disability and sur-
vivor benefits, this chapter focuses primarily on retirement benefits 
with some attention paid to the survivor benefits of a spouse.
The Lowdown on Social Security
Most Americans think that Social Security simply is an automatic 
payment that begins at retirement and that they have little or no 
influence over the amount of the payment. In truth, Social Security 
is a fairly broad and complex program that provides retirement, 
survivor, and disability benefits. Retirement benefits are not 
automatic. You choose when they begin, and the choice affects 
the amount of benefits you receive. The amount of benefits you 
receive also can depend on your spouse’s benefits. You even can 
change your mind after starting to receive benefits.
The original intent of Social Security’s retirement benefits was to 
provide a basic, minimum income for retired workers. The lower 
your working years’ income was, the greater the percentage of that 
income Social Security would replace. However in recent years, 
Social Security has undergone some changes, and employers are 
steadily eliminating defined benefit pension plans (those that guar-
antee a fixed monthly retirement payment for life), shifting the risk 
of saving and investing to employees. As a result, for many people, 
Social Security retirement benefits are the only source of retire-
ment income that’s both guaranteed and indexed for inflation. 
(Refer to Chapter 1 for more in-depth discussion about this topic.)

195
 Chapter 10: Making Your Best Choices under Social Security
 
When you decide to begin receiving Social Security benefits deter-
mines the amount of the benefits. Other issues also decide the 
amount of your benefits. The key issues that determine the amount 
of benefits you receive are
 
✓ The age at which you (and your spouse, if you’re married) 
begin receiving retirement benefits
 
✓ Whether your benefit payments are based on your work 
record or your spouse’s
 
✓ Whether you should change from receiving benefits based on 
your spouse’s earnings record to benefits based on your earn-
ings record, or even change the age at which you begin receiv-
ing benefits
 
✓ Whether your marital status changed over the years — which 
could lead to additional choices
You (and other beneficiaries) have several opportunities to make 
choices about your retirement benefits, and the choices greatly 
influence the amount of payments you’ll receive. Because Social 
Security continues for life, the choices you make can alter lifetime 
income by tens of thousands of dollars or more. The decisions you 
make also affect the amount of survivor benefits received by your 
Eyeing the other Social Security benefits
In this book we focus on Social Security 
retirement benefits and survivor benefits 
for spouses. But it’s worth noting that of 
the total amount of Social Security ben-
efits paid each year, just over 60 percent 
are retirement benefits. The rest of the 
payments are for disability and survivor 
benefits. 
To qualify for disability benefits, the worker 
must be completely disabled and unable 
to engage in any kind of employment. 
If a worker dies, the spouse or children 
may be eligible to receive survivor ben-
efits. Children under age 18 (or 19, if full-
time high school students) generally are 
eligible for a monthly survivor benefit of 
up to 50 percent of the deceased’s ben-
efits. We don’t discuss these benefits 
at any depth in this book; just be aware 
that these benefits are part of what you 
receive for your Social Security taxes.

196
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
spouse. Your financial security is enhanced if you search for ways 
to increase the guaranteed income from Social Security retirement 
benefits.
Many people believe decisions about Social Security retirement 
benefits are final, but that’s not the case. You can change your 
mind and restart benefits in at least two situations. We explore 
those situations in this chapter. See the sections “Understanding 
the choices for spousal benefits” and “Ensuring spouses are taken 
care of: Survivor’s benefits.”
Determining When You’re 
Eligible for Benefits
You’re eligible for Social Security retirement benefits after earning 
40 work credits. You earn a work credit for each quarter year (three 
months) in which your earned income, subject to the Social Security 
tax, exceeded a minimum level. The minimum income level is 
indexed for inflation and was $1,120 for 2010. Therefore, you’re enti-
tled to retirement benefits if you work a total of at least 40 quarters 
(ten full years) during your lifetime in which you earn more than the 
minimum amount of income covered by Social Security.
After you know you’re eligible to receive benefits, determining the 
level of benefits you use isn’t quite as clear. The benefits are based 
on the highest 35 years of earnings before beginning benefits. The 
earnings from prior years are indexed for wage inflation as part 
of the computation. The result is a figure called average indexed 
monthly earnings, which is used to determine your benefits. This 
computation is quite technical, but we cover the essentials here; 
if you’re interested in more of the fine details, go to the Social 
Security Web site (www.ssa.gov).
 
What you need to know is that in general the higher the income 
you post for your highest 35 years of working, the higher your ben-
efits will be. However, remember that there’s a limit on the amount 
of income subject to Social Security taxes during your earning 
years. The benefit computation doesn’t include income earned 
above that limit.

197
 Chapter 10: Making Your Best Choices under Social Security
Even though higher income earners receive more benefits than 
lower income earners, the benefits for higher income earners 
replace a smaller proportion of earnings than for lower income 
earners. In other words, individuals with lower lifetime earnings 
have a higher replacement ratio than those with higher incomes. 
The replacement ratio is the percentage of working income that’s 
paid in retirement benefits. Lower income retirees can receive 
Social Security benefits equal to about 90 percent of their pre-
retirement income. The benefits of high income retirees are about 
15 percent of pre-retirement income.
So how can you figure out when you can start receiving distribu-
tions from Social Security and what the benefits would be at dif-
ferent ages? The following two sections can help you make those 
determinations. If you’re not at retirement age yet, your first 
resource is the annual earnings history report you receive from 
the Social Security Administration (SSA). You also need to know 
what Uncle Sam has defined as the age you can retire to receive 
your full benefits.
Reviewing your earnings history
The SSA sends everyone with an earnings history an annual state-
ment of estimated benefits a few months before his or her birth-
day. The statement shows the earnings history in Social Security’s 
records and estimates the retirement benefits that would be 
received if benefits were to begin at ages 62, 70, and full retirement 
age (which for most people still working is around age 66 or 67). 
Other information and estimates also are included.
 
The earnings history in the annual statement is critical. If the his-
tory is incorrect, the benefits eventually paid to you will be incor-
rect. You have three years to correct an error in a year’s earnings 
amount. We suggest that you at least review the recent earnings 
history when the statement is received and decide whether it needs 
to be corrected. If you do need to correct it, you can call the SSA at 
800-772-1213 from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. every business day. Or you can 
take your records to your local SSA office. To correct your earnings 
record, you need to give your name, Social Security number, the 
year or years which contain erroneous earnings, and the business 

198
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
name and address of your employer in those years. Helpful items to 
have are your W-2 forms (or tax returns if you’re self-employed) for 
the incorrect years.
 
An examination of the earnings history can provide you with useful 
information to decide what may be a good age for you to retire. 
Most people have low earnings during the early years of their 
careers and mostly steadily rising earnings after that. Workers suf-
fering extended layoffs, however, may have low income earning 
years at other times in their work histories. Remember that the 
benefits calculation uses only your highest 35 years of earnings, so 
working a few extra years could remove the lowest earning years 
from your “high 35” and ultimately increase your Social Security 
retirement benefits. And keep in mind that an increase in the ben-
efits means a higher payment every month for the rest of your life, 
so it could amount to a large sum over time.
Defining when you can retire
The federal government has set the benchmark for retirement ben-
efits, called full retirement age (FRA), or normal retirement age. If you 
begin retirement benefits at this age, you receive full retirement ben-
efits (FRB), also known as normal retirement benefits. Begin benefits 
earlier, and you receive lower monthly benefits. Delay receiving ben-
efits after FRA, and you receive a higher annual payment.
For many decades FRA was 65. The reforms of 1983 phased in a 
higher FRA for anyone born after 1937 (anyone who turns 65 after 
2002). When fully phased in, the schedule creates a new FRA of 67 
for anyone born after 1959. Check out Table 10-1 for a schedule of 
FRAs to see where you fall.

Note: If you were born on January 1 of any year, you should refer to the 
previous year. If you qualify for benefits as a survivor, your full retirement 
age may be different.
There’s an annual limit on the amount of retirement benefits, 
regardless of pre-retirement income. The limit is indexed for infla-
tion. So, for example, someone retiring at full retirement age in 
2009 received no more than $2,323 monthly regardless of how high 
her lifetime earnings are. (For comparison, the average monthly 
retirement benefit paid in 2009 was $1,153.)
 
You can begin receiving Social Security retirement benefits as 
early as age 62, and you don’t have to be retired from work to 
receive them. You can choose the starting date. However, note 
that if you begin the benefits before FRA, the amount of benefits 
will be reduced below the FRB. The benefit is reduced by a per-
centage for each month you begin benefits before FRA. The 
amount of the reduction depends on the year of your birth. The 
reduction in benefits for early retirement is a little complicated. 
The beneficiary loses 5⁄9 percent of the full benefit for each month 
of the first 36 months before FRA, and 5⁄12 percent of the full benefit 
for each additional month before FRA that benefits begin. We 
discuss this penalty in the later section “Noting How Working 
Reduces Benefits.” Table 10-2 shows the reduced benefit for taking 
benefits at 62 for each age group.

Note: If you were born on January 1, you will be treated as if born the previous year. If you were born on the first of the 
month, the benefit is figured as if your birthday was in the previous month. You must be at least 62 for the entire month 
to receive benefits. Percentages are approximate due to rounding. The maximum benefit for the spouse is 50% of the 
benefit the worker would receive at full retirement age. The % reduction for the spouse should be applied after the 
automatic 50% reduction. Percentages are approximate due to rounding.

 Chapter 10: Making Your Best Choices under Social Security
The law provides an incentive, known as delayed retirement cred-
its, to delay receiving benefits after FRA. The credits are a rate of 
increase in your benefits for each month you postpone receiving 
benefits, and the rate of increase depends on the year you were 
born. So, your age and the number of months you delay receiving 
benefits determine how much benefits increase when you wait. A 
third factor is the salary you receive if you continue to work before 
receiving benefits. Because your highest 35 years of earnings are 
used to calculate benefits, working more years may increase your 
FRB if later higher-earning years push lower-earning years out 
of the top 35. Table 10-3 shows the rate at which FRA increases. 
There are no increases for delaying benefits past age 70.

Taking a Closer Look at Spouses’ 
and Survivor Benefits
Many seniors consider more than themselves in financial deci-
sions. They also have spouses to be concerned about, and benefits 
for a spouse are among the least understood aspects of the Social 
Security program. Here are the two dimensions to incorporating a 
spouse in decisions on Social Security benefits:

202
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
 
✓ A married person can receive either spousal benefits based on 
the other spouse’s earnings record or retirement benefits based 
on his own work record, whichever results in higher benefits.
 
✓ A surviving spouse can receive survivor benefits based on the 
earnings record of the deceased spouse. Keep in mind that the 
decision of when to begin receiving your own benefits can affect 
the amount of survivor benefits received by your spouse.
 
Note the important difference between the spousal benefit and sur-
vivor’s benefit: While the higher-earning spouse is alive, the lower-
earning spouse’s retirement benefit is half of the higher-earning 
spouse’s benefit at FRA (or his own retirement benefit, whichever is 
higher), regardless of when the higher-earning spouse decided to 
begin benefits. But after the higher-earning spouse passes away, the 
lower-earning spouse’s survivor benefit is equal to the retirement 
benefit that the higher-earning spouse was receiving. The amount 
of the survivor benefit depends on the age when the higher-earning 
spouse chose to begin benefits. If the higher-earning spouse began 
receiving benefits before FRA, the surviving spouse will receive less 
than the FRB as a survivor benefit, and that reduction will continue 
for the rest of the surviving spouse’s life.
We explore these dimensions in detail, because the age at which 
you decide to begin benefits affects the benefits received by a 
spouse, a surviving spouse, and even by an ex-spouse. If you’re not 
married and have never been married, you can skip this section. 
We begin with some simple strategies and build to some more 
sophisticated strategies.
Understanding the choices 
for spousal benefits
One way you can enhance your personal finances as a senior is 
to take advantage of the spousal benefit. The spousal benefit is 
the amount of retirement benefits a married person is entitled to 
based on the earnings record of the other spouse. This benefit is 
different from the retirement benefit you’re entitled to based on 
your own earnings history. You may receive either the spousal 
benefit or the retirement benefit, but not both.

203
 Chapter 10: Making Your Best Choices under Social Security
 
The Social Security Administration is supposed to automatically 
compare the spousal benefit to the earned retirement benefit and 
automatically pay the higher of the two. No action is supposed to 
be required by a beneficiary to receive the higher benefit. But mis-
takes can be made, so you should know the benefit you’re entitled 
to and be sure that is what you’re receiving. If you aren’t, contact 
the SSA.
If you’re the lower-earning spouse, you can start receiving spousal 
benefits when your higher-earning spouse begins receiving retire-
ment benefits. The two of you have some important decisions to 
make before the lower-earning spouse takes benefits, however. 
Note: To help you grasp what you and your spouse can do, we 
assume one spouse has higher lifetime earnings than the other. 
We refer to the spouses as the higher-earning spouse and the lower-
earning spouse.
 
In general the spousal benefit is one-half of the benefit at FRA 
earned by the other spouse, if the lower-earning spouse doesn’t 
begin receiving benefits until her own FRA or later. However, note 
that it doesn’t matter whether the higher-earning spouse begins 
benefits at age 62, age 70, or somewhere in between. The spousal 
benefit is one-half the benefit that the higher-earning spouse would 
receive by beginning benefits at FRA. Also, when the lower-earning 
spouse receives the spousal benefit, it doesn’t affect the amount of 
benefits received by the higher-earning spouse.
So what choices does the lower-earning income spouse have? The 
following sections explain your options along with some examples.
Choice No. 1: Lower-earning spouse 
retires first, takes own benefits
When the higher-earning spouse hasn’t begun receiving retirement 
benefits, the lower-earning spouse’s only option is to begin receiving 
retirement benefits based on her earnings history. A spousal benefit 
can’t begin until the higher-earning spouse actually begins receiv-
ing benefits. If the lower-earning spouse wants to begin benefits but 
the higher-earning spouse is delaying benefits, the lower-earning 
spouse’s only option at that point is to receive benefits based on her 
own earnings record. After the higher-earning spouse begins receiv-
ing benefits, the lower-earning spouse can shift to the spousal benefit.

204
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
Choice No.2: Higher-earning spouse retires, 
boosts lower-earning spouse’s benefits
After the higher-earning spouse begins retirement benefits, the 
lower-earning spouse can choose either a spousal benefit or his 
own retirement benefit. When the lower-earning spouse already 
is receiving benefits based on his own earnings history, he can 
switch to the spousal benefit after the higher-earning spouse 
begins retirement benefits.
If a lower-earning spouse decides to take benefits based on the 
higher-earning spouse’s earnings record, the lower-earning spouse 
receives half of the higher-earning spouse’s FRB, but only if the 
lower-earning spouse waits until his own FRA to begin any benefits. 
If the lower-earning spouse decides to begin benefits (whether 
his own retirement benefit or a spousal benefit) before his own 
FRA, the spousal benefit will be less than half of the higher-earning 
spouse’s FRA. The benefit will be reduced on a sliding scale. If the 
lower-earning spouse selects age 62, he will receive a benefit that’s 
35 percent of the higher-earning spouse’s FRA benefit.
For example, say each spouse is age 62. The lower-earning 
spouse’s earned retirement benefit is $900 monthly at FRA or $500 
at 62. The higher-earning spouse is entitled to $1,900 monthly at 
FRA. The lower-earning spouse wants to begin receiving benefits 
now. The higher-earning spouse continues to work and delays 
benefits. The lower-earning spouse begins receiving $500 at 62. 
The higher-earning spouse finally begins receiving benefits at FRA 
of $1,900. The lower-earning spouse now can switch to receive 
half of the higher-earning spouse’s benefit. Normally the spousal 
benefit would be $950 (half of the higher-earning spouse’s FRB), 
but because the lower-earning spouse began receiving benefits at 
62 the benefits are reduced by 35 percent. By beginning his own 
retirement benefits early, the lower-earning spouse permanently 
reduces monthly benefits, even if he later switches to the spousal 
benefit.
 
If the lower-earning spouse begins retirement benefits before FRA 
based on his earnings record and later shifts to spousal benefits, 
the spousal benefit will be reduced based on the age at which the 
lower-earning spouse began receiving the retirement benefits based 
on his earnings record.

205
 Chapter 10: Making Your Best Choices under Social Security
Choice No. 3: Claim and suspend
You have a third option as a lower-earning spouse. Social Security 
allows a person to file for retirement benefits and then suspend 
receipt of them. The suspension is treated as though the person 
never applied for benefits during the suspension period. The 
monthly reductions for claiming benefits before FRA aren’t applied 
and delayed retirement credits accumulate during the suspension 
period. Once a beneficiary suspends benefits, they can have the ben-
efits resume at any time. If the benefits are applied for at age 62 but 
suspended until age 70, the maximum benefit may be received at 70.
This is known as the claim-and-suspend strategy. The claim-and-
suspend strategy can be used to allow the lower-earning spouse 
to begin receiving a spousal benefit now while the higher-earning 
spouse effectively delays receipt of benefits and receive higher 
benefits in the future. 
If you’re younger than FRA and you continue working for an 
income exceeding the earned income limit, you don’t need to file 
to suspend the benefits. The adjustment process automatically is 
done through the earnings test (we discuss this later in the section 
“Noting How Working Reduces Benefits”). Benefits are reduced 
if you earn too much money while receiving benefits before FRA, 
but the reduction increases benefits received later. But at FRA and 
later, a beneficiary must apply to suspend the benefits.
Ensuring spouses are taken 
care of: Survivor’s benefits
If you’re the higher-earning spouse, you want to make sure your 
lower-earning spouse is taken care of — at least we hope so. In that 
case, you, the higher-earning spouse, need to consider survivor’s 
benefits when deciding the age to begin retirement benefits. A 
Social Security survivor’s benefit is the benefit payable to a surviving 
spouse after the other spouse passes away. The survivor’s benefit 
is 100 percent of the benefit the deceased spouse was receiving. 
This section identifies some strategies you can use to ensure your 
spouse receives the maximum benefits after you’re gone.

206
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
 
As the higher-earning spouse, you have to figure out how your deci-
sion regarding taking benefits affects your lower-earning spouse. 
Your goal should be to maximize the lifetime income of your spouse.
Strategy No. 1: Delay retirement benefits
You can increase the lifetime income of your lower-earning spouse 
if you delay retirement benefits, but only if you, the higher-earning 
spouse, die first. Delaying benefits is a form of free life insurance 
that provides extra income to the lower-earning spouse.
 
When both spouses are alive, the lower-earning spouse can receive 
the higher amount of his earned benefit or 50 percent of the higher-
earning spouse’s benefit at FRA. When the higher-earning spouse 
dies, the lower-earning spouse can’t receive retirement benefits and 
a survivor’s benefit. When someone is eligible for both types of 
benefits, he receives only the higher of the benefits. If the higher-
earning spouse passes away, the surviving spouse either continues 
to receive his own earned benefit or receives 100 percent of the 
benefit that the higher-earning spouse was receiving before passing 
away. In other words, when both spouses were receiving benefits 
and one passes away, the household’s income will be reduced by 
the lower of the two benefits the spouses were receiving.
The survivor’s benefits rules should influence the age at which 
a higher-earning spouse decides to begin retirement benefits. 
For example, say the higher-earning spouse is eligible for $1,800 
monthly at FRA, while the lower-earning spouse is eligible for 
an earned benefit of $700. If the lower-earning spouse chooses 
to take the spouse’s benefit while the other spouse is still alive, 
he will receive $900 monthly, half of the higher-earning spouse’s 
FRA benefit. The amount received by the higher-earning spouse 
(and the lower-earning spouse) will depend on the age her ben-
efits began. Suppose she delayed benefits past FRA and receives 
$2,200 monthly. If the higher-earning spouse passes away first, 
the lower-earning spouse would then receive $2,200 monthly as a 
survivor’s benefit. If the lower-earning spouse passes away first, 
the higher-earning spouse continues to receive only her earned 
benefit. Suppose instead the higher-earning spouse began benefits 
before FRA and was receiving $1,500 monthly. If the higher-earning 
spouse passes away first, the surviving spouse will receive $1,500 
monthly.

207
 Chapter 10: Making Your Best Choices under Social Security
Strategy No. 2: Begin benefits twice
The Social Security law allows married couples to use a strategy 
we coin “beginning your benefits twice,” which can increase life-
time benefits. With this strategy, a spouse initially begins benefits, 
either his own earned benefit or a spousal benefit. After a few 
years, he switches to the other benefit. The strategy can maximize 
lifetime benefits, depending on which spouse earned more income 
and when each begins receiving earned retirement benefits.
For instance, consider the example in the earlier section 
“Understanding the choices for spousal benefits,” where the 
lower-earning spouse began benefits based on his own earnings 
record because the higher-earning spouse hadn’t yet begun receiv-
ing benefits. After the higher-earning spouse began benefits, the 
lower-earning spouse switched to spousal benefits based on the 
higher-earning spouse’s earned benefit at FRA. In this case, the 
lower-earning spouse began benefits twice.
Similarly, a high-earning spouse can choose to receive spousal 
benefits based on the lower-earning spouse’s benefits — even if 
that results in a lower monthly benefit — and then later switch to 
a benefit based on her own earnings record.
Suppose, for example, the lower-earning spouse would be entitled 
to $1,000 monthly at FRA and the higher-earning spouse would 
receive $2,000 at FRA. They’re both 62 years old. The lower-
earning spouse begins benefits now, receiving $750 monthly. The 
higher-earning spouse wants to delay retirement benefits until age 
70 to maximize lifetime benefits and also the survivor’s benefit. 
To generate cash flow before then, at her FRA the higher-earning 
spouse applies for spousal benefits equal to one-half the lower-
earning spouse’s earned benefits at FRA, or $500. Then at age 70, 
the higher-earning spouse can apply for retirement benefits and 
begin receiving $2,000 monthly.
 
A higher-earning spouse who opts to receive spousal benefits based 
on her lower-earning spouse’s benefits doesn’t receive a reduction 
in her retirement benefits, because retirement benefits weren’t 
applied for early. At the earlier age, only spousal benefits were 
applied for — and only at her FRA or later.

208
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
 
The rule that allows this strategy is that a married person who has 
reached FRA is eligible for a benefit based on either his earnings 
record or the spouse’s earnings record. If both retirement and 
spousal benefits are applied for, the higher benefit automatically is 
paid. But the person has the option to apply only for spousal bene-
fits. If the application isn’t made until after FRA, beginning spousal 
benefits at that age doesn’t reduce the eventual retirement benefits. 
If a person applies for benefits before FRA, he’ll be treated as apply-
ing for both spousal and retirement benefits. Beginning the benefits 
will trigger a reduction based on the person’s age, and that reduc-
tion will be permanent.
Either spouse or both spouses can use this strategy. If both 
spouses wanted to use the strategy, each would receive half of 
the other’s FRA benefit until choosing to begin retirement ben-
efits based on his or her own earnings record. For example, say 
a husband and wife are the same age and has reached FRA. The 
higher-earning spouse is entitled to $2,000 monthly and the lower-
earning spouse to $900 monthly on their own earnings records. 
The higher-earning spouse applies for spousal benefits, receiving 
$450 monthly. The lower-earning spouse applies for retirement 
benefits, receiving $900 monthly. At age 70, the higher-earning 
spouse applies for retirement benefits, which now are $2,700. The 
lower-earning spouse applies for the higher of retirement ben-
efits and spousal benefits. The spousal benefit is half of what the 
higher-earning spouse was entitled to at FRA, $1,000 monthly, and 
is likely to be the higher benefit.
Identifying When You May 
Need to Receive Benefits
Social Security is an asset. It’s a stream of income the government 
owes you. Like any asset, you need to manage Social Security in 
order to maximize lifetime income in a way that’s consistent with 
your other goals and needs. When considering the time to begin 
drawing benefits, answer the questions in the following sections.

209
 Chapter 10: Making Your Best Choices under Social Security
We address both a case of an individual deciding when to take 
benefits and also a case when a spouse is involved. The situation 
with a couple is a little more complicated. The couple can decide 
either to maximize lifetime benefits or to ensure that the lower-
earning spouse receives the highest possible benefits if he sur-
vives the other spouse.
What are your cash flow needs?
If you need access to your benefits to pay expenses before you’re 
eligible for full benefits, you probably have no choice but to begin 
receiving benefits early. If you’ve left the workforce — whether 
through choice or circumstances — you may have limited sources 
of income. You may need to begin Social Security retirement ben-
efits in order to pay living expenses as early as 62. Someone who 
still is in the workforce but on a part-time basis or at a reduced 
income also may need to begin benefits to meet expenses. If, how-
ever, you can continue to work and have investments or pensions 
that generate enough income to support your standard of living, you 
can afford to hold off on receiving benefits until your FRA or later.
Will waiting pay off?
When you don’t have immediate need for retirement benefits 
before FRA, you may want to receive benefits based on the age 
that will generate the largest lifetime income. You can estimate 
this age by considering a simple trade off: Begin retirement ben-
efits early and you receive benefits for a longer period of time. 
Delay benefits and you receive a higher benefit. At some point, 
waiting to receive the large benefit is worth while.
So how do you know really when you’ve reached this point? A 
simple way to decide is to calculate the rough break-even point. The 
break-even point is the year when the total lifetime benefits received 
from beginning benefits at a time other than FRA equals the benefits 
that would be received from beginning benefits at FRA.

210
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
For example, say your benefit at FRA (age 66) is $1,400 per month. 
If you start benefits at 62, the benefit is reduced by 25 percent to 
$1,050, or $350 less per month. But, you receive the benefits for 
an extra 48 months. The total benefits received between 62 and 
FRA would be $50,400. Divide that by $350, and the result is 144. 
That’s the number of months you would have to live beyond FRA 
to receive the same lifetime benefits as would be received by start-
ing benefits at age 62. If you divide 144 by 12, you get 12 years. You 
would have to live to age 78 to reach the break-even point. If you 
live longer than the break-even point age of 78, you would come 
out ahead by $1,050 for each additional month lived.
Now, consider yourself in the same position but drawing benefits 
later. The benefit at age 70 would be $1,820 monthly, or 130 per-
cent of the FRA benefit. Beginning benefits at 66 means receiv-
ing benefits for 48 extra months for a total of $67,200 of benefits 
received by age 70. Waiting until age 70 would result in an extra 
$420 per month. Divide the total benefits that would be received 
between ages 66 and 70 by the extra amount received by waiting 
until age 70. The result is 160. So it would take 160 months after 
age 70 for the lifetime payments received by beginning benefits 
at 70 to equal those received by beginning benefits at 66. If you 
divide 160 by 12, the result is 13.33 years. That means you would 
have to live another 13.33 years (until age 83 and a third) to reach 
the break-even point of receiving the same amount of lifetime ben-
efits. If you live longer than 13.33 years, the lifetime benefits are 
higher by waiting.
After you calculate the break-even point, review the later section, 
“What’s your life expectancy?” Doing so can give you a good idea 
of the probability you’ll reach the break-even point should you 
choose to delay benefits.
 
In either of the preceding cases, you come out ahead by waiting to 
receive benefits if you live past the break-even point. If you pass 
away earlier, your lifetime benefits would be higher by taking ben-
efits early.
The break-even calculation is very simple. It can be made more 
complicated and precise by considering alternative uses of money 
and investment options as we discuss briefly in the next section.

211
 Chapter 10: Making Your Best Choices under Social Security
What other income do you have?
If you have an investment portfolio or other income capable of 
paying living expenses, you have discretion over when to begin 
Social Security retirement benefits. By beginning benefits early you 
have the option of leaving money invested instead of taking it out 
to pay expenses. Or you can invest the Social Security benefits as 
received and continue spending the other sources of income.
Under either scenario you have an investment side fund that 
compounds until it’s needed. You can assume an after-tax rate of 
return on this fund and estimate whether the fund would com-
pound enough to justify taking lower benefits early instead of wait-
ing for the higher benefits. If your side investment fund does well, 
the break-even point from waiting to begin benefits is pushed fur-
ther into the future. (Refer to the preceding section “Will waiting 
pay off?” for more on break-even points.)
 
The problem with considering the results of an investing side fund 
is the uncertainty of investment returns. You can’t assume a long-
term average rate of return, because you won’t be investing for the 
long term. The projections of how well the side fund would perform 
would depend on your assumptions about investment returns and 
taxes. This area is where consulting with your accountant or finan-
cial planner can be helpful.
Do you want to continue to work?
Another factor to consider is any penalty for earned income 
received while receiving Social Security benefits. If you won’t be 
working when receiving benefits, this isn’t an issue for you. It also 
isn’t an issue after FRA. But if you plan to work full- or part-time 
before FRA, you may earn so much that your benefits are reduced. 
In that case, it may not make sense to begin receiving benefits 
before FRA or until you stop working. Check out the section, 
“Noting How Working Reduces Benefits” later in this chapter for 
more details.

212
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
What are the potential income 
taxes on benefits?
You need to consider income taxes when deciding your begin-
ning date for benefits. The general rule is that Social Security 
benefits are excluded from gross income when computing federal 
income taxes. But as income rises, a portion of the benefits may 
be included in your gross income. If your income is high enough 
to trigger taxes on the benefits after 62 but the income is likely to 
decline later, it may make sense to delay benefits until a smaller 
portion of them are taxed. Refer to the later section, “Being Aware 
of Potential Income Taxes on Your Benefits” for more info on the 
income taxation of Social Security benefits.
What’s your life expectancy?
The key to choosing the best date to begin Social Security retire-
ment benefits is by estimating how long you’ll live. The benefit 
levels for different ages were calculated so a person who lives to 
life expectancy receives the same lifetime benefits regardless of 
when the benefits were begun. Life expectancy for an age group 
means half the people in the group will live longer and half will live 
shorter lives.
Of course, you don’t have a crystal ball you can rub to tell how 
long you will live (and you may not want to know either). But here 
are a couple factors you can keep in mind when considering the 
issue:
 
✓ Your personal health: If you have a strong probability of living 
less than life expectancy (for example you know that you have 
a chronic disease that will shorten your life), receiving ben-
efits as early as possible makes sense. Otherwise you may want 
to assume you’ll be in the group that lives to life expectancy or 
longer.

213
 Chapter 10: Making Your Best Choices under Social Security
 
✓ Your family history: If your family has a history of long life 
spans and you’re in good health, you may consider delaying 
benefits to maximize lifetime payments.
 
The good news for you: The schedule used for determining life 
expectancies is outdated, and life expectancies have increased. 
About half of men turning age 65 today will live beyond age 85. 
More than half of women age 65 today will live beyond 85. The 
bonus for delaying benefits probably is higher than it should be 
under current life expectancies. So more than half of an age group 
is likely to live beyond the life expectancy used in the benefit calcu-
lations, and more people will benefit from delaying benefits. Of 
course, if personal or family history raises doubts about living to 
life expectancy, you should consider taking benefits early.
Noting How Working 
Reduces Benefits
If you receive Social Security retirement benefits from age 62 to 
your FRA, you face a limit on the amount of income you can earn 
while receiving those benefits. The limit and amount of the penalty 
for earning more than the limit depend on your age. You can check 
out the limits on the Social Security Administration Web site at 
www.socialsecurity.gov. Note: The limit is applied monthly 
and applies until you reach FRA.
Earned income is income from a job or self-employment. It includes 
most sources of income from providing personal services or sell-
ing goods or services. Earned income doesn’t include investment 
income and passive income such as interest, dividends, capital 
gains, pensions, and IRA distributions. Self-employment income is 
net self-employment income, which is gross income from the busi-
ness minus business-related expenses.

Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
Taking the penalty for exceeding 
the annual income limit
If you’re still working, you tell the SSA before the start of each 
year how much income you expect to earn for the year. When 
your estimated income will exceed the earned income limit, the 
SSA then computes the penalty and withholds the appropriate 
amount from your benefits check each month. If your earned 
income changes in either direction you must notify the SSA so it 
can adjust the withholding.
Between age 62 and the year FRA will be reached, benefits are 
reduced $1 for every $2 earned over the limit. The limit is $14,160 
for 2010 and is indexed for inflation each year. For example, 
62-year-old Sally is due $7,200 in benefits, but because she’s earn-
ing $30,000 in 2010 she would lose all Social Security benefits for 
the year. If Sally actually earned only $20,000 that year, $2,920 of 
her benefits would be withheld. (The income of $20,000 minus 
the limit of $14,160 shows an excess income of $5,840. Divide the 
excess by two, and she loses $2,920 of benefits.) The SSA would 
withhold her January through June benefits. The $600 monthly 
benefits would be paid July through December. In January 2011, 
Sally would be paid the $440 that was withheld in June 2010.
In the year you reach FRA, retirement benefits are reduced $1 for 
every $3 earned over a dollar limit. The limit, which is indexed 
for inflation, is $37,680 in 2010. The limit applies on a monthly 
basis until the month you reach FRA. Beginning with that month, 
full retirement benefits are received no matter how much income 
is earned.
For example, say that Bobby Beneficiary hasn’t yet met FRA at the 
beginning of 2010, but he reaches it in November 2010. The retire-
ment benefits are $600 per month, or $7,200 for the year. Bobby 
earned $39,000 in the 10 months from January through October. The 
SSA would withhold $440 ($1 for every $3 earned above the $37,680 
limit). To implement the limit, the SSA would withhold the January 
check of $600. Beginning in February 2010, Bobby would receive the 
$600 benefit monthly, and this amount would be paid each month 
for the remainder of the year. The SSA would pay Bobby the remain-
ing $160 from his January 2010 check in January 2011.

215
 Chapter 10: Making Your Best Choices under Social Security
Determining the penalty 
on a monthly basis
When someone begins Social Security benefits during a calendar 
year (versus at the beginning of the year), income earned before 
the benefit beginning date doesn’t count in applying the penalty. 
Instead, the annual earnings limit is computed on a monthly basis, 
and only the monthly earnings after the date retirement benefits 
begin count toward the penalty. For example, in 2010 the monthly 
earnings limit for someone younger than FRA is $1,180 ($14,160 
divided by 12).
For example, imagine a man begins retirement benefits at age 62 
on October 30, 2010. He had $45,000 of earned income through 
October. He leaves that job and takes a part-time job beginning 
in November earning $500 per month. His earnings for the year 
substantially exceed the limit of $14,160, but only the monthly 
earnings after October count. Because each month after October 
he will earn less than $1,180, he won’t experience any reduction in 
benefits in November and December. Beginning in 2011, only the 
annual limit will apply for this beneficiary if he continues to work 
the entire year.
 
Special rules apply to the self-employed. In addition to the net 
income, the SSA looks at the amount of time spent on the business. 
In general, if someone works more than 45 hours a month in self-
employment, that person isn’t considered retired and will lose all 
or some of her benefits. Someone who works less than 15 hours a 
month is retired and faces no penalty. Someone who works 
between 15 and 45 hours a month isn’t considered retired if the job 
requires a lot of skill or the person is managing a sizeable business.
The penalty isn’t always bad
The loss of benefits from the earned income limit may not be per-
manent. After FRA is reached, benefits will be recomputed to give 
you credit for the lost benefits. But credit is allowed only for the 
months when the entire benefit was withheld.

216
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
Continuing to work may actually increase your benefits after FRA. 
Your highest-earning 35 years will be used to determine the ben-
efits. Each year the SSA reviews the records of beneficiaries who 
receive earned income. If the most recent year is one of the top 35 
earnings years, the benefits are automatically recalculated. The 
higher benefit should begin in December of the year after the earn-
ings year. For example, suppose your 2010 earnings would result 
in a recalculation of benefits during 2011. The additional benefits 
would be retroactive to January 2011 and would be paid in a lump 
sum in December 2011.
Preserving Your Benefits
You may be able to plan and manage your income to avoid losing 
Social Security retirement benefits before reaching FRA. But you 
also need to be wary of any strategies that people suggest because 
if the Social Security Administration doesn’t like what it sees, your 
strategy could be a mistake that costs you money. If someone 
recommends a strategy to you, check it out with a knowledge-
able, objective advisor or contact the SSA. The good news: We’re 
on your side, and in this section we look at a few ways you may 
be able to earn some income legally without having your Social 
Security retirement benefits reduced.
 
The rules for earned income have many nuances and technical 
terms and a lot of misinformation and fraudulent strategies, some-
times recommended by unscrupulous individuals, are floating 
around. So if your earned income and Social Security benefits are 
high enough to merit the investment, before choosing a strategy, 
get the advice of an attorney, accountant, or financial advisor who’s 
familiar with the rules.
Deferring income
One strategy you may be able to take to preserve your Social 
Security retirement benefits is to defer some of your income. 
Income deferral means you perform services this year but payment 

217
 Chapter 10: Making Your Best Choices under Social Security
for the services is not due until a future year. The classic case of 
income deferral is a pension. You work for 30 years or more and 
part of your earnings are not paid until you retire. Income can be 
deferred for shorter periods, even from one year to the next, and 
you can defer income outside of a retirement plan.
 
In most cases, earned income is applied against the limit in the year 
it’s earned, not in the year it’s paid. So you can’t avoid the earnings 
limit simply by agreeing to have your employer pay it in a future 
year. If you have the legal right to receive the income, it must be 
included in your earned income for Social Security purposes in the 
year you earned it.
Here are a couple options to defer your income that help you 
avoid the earned income limit:
 
✓ Defer it under a retirement plan in which employer contri-
butions aren’t vested. If you work and employer contributions 
are paid into a retirement plan but aren’t vested, the employer 
contributions aren’t considered earned income. They haven’t 
been paid to you, and you don’t have a legal right to them yet.
 
 However, the earnings limit applies if you work and earn 
retirement benefits that are vested or not at risk of forfeiture. 
Also, although the money deferred may avoid federal income 
taxes this year, it’s included in earned income to determine 
the earned income limit.
 
✓ Defer it under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. 
This type of plan is a contract between you and your employer. 
To avoid having the money considered earned income for the 
year, there must be a risk that you would lose or forfeit the 
money before receiving it. The money can’t be payable to the 
employee until the future. The employer can’t place the money 
in a trust for the worker’s benefit or purchase an annuity in the 
employee’s name. If the employer goes bankrupt, the employee 
must have the status of a general creditor with no secured inter-
est in an asset that would pay the income.
 
 The rules are complicated, and an experienced lawyer should 
be used to draft the agreement. The expense and trouble may 
not be worth the amount of benefits at stake.

218
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
Using your corporation
If you own a business through a corporation, you may be able to 
use the corporation to avoid the earned income limit on Social 
Security benefits. You set your salary so it’s under the earned 
income limit.
 
Be careful. There’s a right way and a wrong way to do this, and cor-
porate owners often get caught doing it the wrong way. You really 
shouldn’t try to use this strategy without the advice of a tax expert 
who knows this area of the law. You can’t simply cut your salary 
the year Social Security benefits begin, especially if you take the 
same amount of cash out of the business through dividends and 
other distributions that don’t qualify as salary or bonus. Both the 
IRS and the SSA state a salary must be reasonable in light of the 
work done and qualifications of the employee. If the salary is set at 
an artificially low level, the SSA considers it fraud. Both the IRS and 
SSA have litigated and won cases against corporate owners who set 
unreasonably low salaries to avoid either payroll taxes or the 
earned income limit.
 
To successfully avoid the earned income limit, you have to estab-
lish the new salary as reasonable for the work done and your level 
of expertise. If your salary declines sharply the year benefits begin, 
your hours worked also should change. The corporate minutes 
should document why the salary level is reasonable. Some advisors 
believe you also should transfer voting control of the corporation 
or set up an independent board or committee that sets the salary.
Considering exempt income
When trying to preserve your Social Security benefits, you may 
want to take a closer look at ways to earn exempt income. Exempt 
income is income that doesn’t count toward the earnings limit. As 
a general rule, compensation that’s tax-free under the tax code 
isn’t counted as wages or earned income for purposes of the Social 
Security earnings limit.

219
 Chapter 10: Making Your Best Choices under Social Security
For example, you may be able to work with your employer to maxi-
mize medical expense coverage and other tax-free benefits and 
minimize cash compensation. Your employer, for example, may 
be able to restructure things so it pays more of your insurance 
premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. These generally are exempt 
income. In return, the employer reduces your cash compensation. 
You should check with the SSA to verify that a form of compensa-
tion doesn’t count toward the earnings limit.
Relying on special income
To preserve your Social Security benefits, you can rely on other 
types of income that are taxable but that the SSA doesn’t consider 
earned income. Examples of special income include the following:
 
✓ Employer reimbursements for travel or moving expenses
 
✓ Jury duty pay
 
✓ Lottery and prize winnings
 
✓ Pension and IRA distributions
Finding additional information
The Social Security Administration (SSA) 
Web site has a great deal of information 
about the different aspects of retirement 
benefits. In addition, you can estimate 
retirement benefits at different ages 
using the calculators on the Web site. 
The calculators allow you to change 
different assumptions and factor a 
spouse into the estimates. The site also 
enables you to download or view SSA 
publications.
The SSA Web site allows you to conduct 
many transactions online. You can apply 
for benefits, change your address or tele-
phone number, check your information or 
benefits, start or change direct deposit, 
and more. You can visit the site at www.

Being Aware of Potential Income 
Taxes on Your Benefits
Originally Social Security retirement benefits were exempt from 
federal income taxes. However, in 1986, Congress made some ben-
efits subject to income taxes. In 1993, more of the benefits paid 
to higher-income beneficiaries became subject to federal income 
taxes. The result is that the marginal tax rate (the tax rate on the 
last dollar of income earned) for some Social Security beneficia-
ries can be 70 percent or higher. Lower-income beneficiaries still 
receive all their benefits tax free, but higher-income beneficiaries 
can have up to 85 percent of benefits included in gross income.
As a result, you need to know when your Social Security retirement 
benefits may be subject to income taxes. This section explains 
how the taxes are calculated on your benefits and what you can do 
to lower yours.
Understanding how modified 
adjusted gross income works
The level of taxation of Social Security benefits depends on your 
modified adjusted gross income, or MAGI. MAGI is adjusted gross 
income (AGI) from your income tax return (before considering tax-
able Social Security benefits) plus one-half of your Social Security 
benefits and some types of exempt income (such as interest from 
tax-exempt bonds).

221
 Chapter 10: Making Your Best Choices under Social Security
Your AGI is the amount left after subtracting from gross income 
deductions such as IRA contributions, self-employed health insur-
ance premiums, and a few other expenses. Itemized expenses 
(such as mortgage interest and charitable contributions) and the 
standard deduction aren’t subtracted to arrive at AGI. (Tip: You 
can find your AGI on the bottom of the first pages of Forms 1040 
and 1040A and line 4 of Form 1040EZ.)
The main type of excluded income that’s added back is tax-exempt 
interest income. This type of income is interest earned on debt 
issued by states and localities. Other types of exempt income to 
add back are interest from qualified U.S. savings bonds, employer-
provided adoption benefits, foreign-earned income or foreign 
housing assistance, and income earned by bona fide residents of 
American Samoa or Puerto Rico.
So, if you’re married and filing a joint return, Social Security ben-
efits are taxed as follows:
Up to 50 percent of benefits are included in gross income when 
MAGI is between $32,000 and $44,000.
Up to 85 percent of benefits are included in gross income when 
MAGI is more than $44,000.
If you’re unmarried, Social Security benefits are taxed as follows:
Up to 50 percent of benefits are included in gross income when 
MAGI is between $25,000 and $34,000.
Up to 85 percent of benefits are included in gross income when 
MAGI is more than $34,000.
Benefits are included in gross income on a sliding scale. In other 
words, if you’re married and filing jointly and your MAGI is $33,000, 
you don’t include a full 50 percent of benefits in gross income. You 
include a portion of the benefits in income, but 50 percent of ben-
efits isn’t included in gross income until your MAGI equals $44,000.
 
IRS Publication 915, “Social Security and Equivalent Railroad 
Retirement Benefits,” contains details about the taxation of bene-
fits. It also has examples and worksheets to help you estimate the 
amount of benefits that are taxable. The publication is available 
free on the IRS Web site (www.irs.gov).

222
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
 
The SSA doesn’t withhold income taxes on your benefits. You must 
make quarterly estimated tax payments to avoid incurring a penalty 
for underpayment of estimated taxes. You can find details of how 
much to pay and how to pay estimated taxes in Publication 505, 
“Tax Withholding and Estimated Tax,” which also is available free 
on the IRS Web site. However, if you’re taking IRA distributions or 
receiving a pension, you can request that the payor withhold 
income taxes. If enough is withheld, you’ll avoid penalties for 
underpayment of income taxes without having to make quarterly 
estimated tax payments.
You also need to check with your state Department of Taxation or 
your tax advisor about how your state taxes Social Security benefits. 
Some states completely exempt Social Security benefits. Others pig-
gyback on the federal system or tax the benefits at a different rate.
Reducing taxes on benefits
If your MAGI is in the range at which some of your benefits will be 
included in gross income, you may be able to take steps to reduce 
the taxes on your benefits.
 
Be careful: You may encounter financial gurus and other people 
recommending strategies that don’t comply with the tax law. If 
you’re advised to use a strategy not recommended here, you 
should have it verified by an objective, experienced tax advisor.
For a married couple, the amount of benefits included in gross 
income is determined by the joint MAGI. The tax on benefits isn’t 
avoided or reduced by filing separate returns. In fact, for married 
couples filing separately, the benefits will be included in gross 
income when MAGI exceeds $0. On a joint return, it’s the joint 
MAGI that determines the level of benefits taxed. The taxes aren’t 
computed separately on the benefits of each spouse. The joint 
income can cause benefits to be taxed even if only one spouse is 
receiving them.
 
If MAGI is significantly above the threshold at which benefits are 
taxed, planning strategies probably won’t reduce the amount of 
benefits included in gross income. The changes would have to dra-
matically reduce MAGI to bring it close to or below the threshold.

223
 Chapter 10: Making Your Best Choices under Social Security
Strategies to reduce taxes on your benefits
Almost all regular tax planning strategies that reduce MAGI can be 
used to reduce the amount of benefits included in gross income. 
These strategies include reducing gross income and increasing 
deductions for AGI. Remember that increasing itemized deduc-
tions, such as mortgage interest and charitable contributions, 
doesn’t reduce MAGI. Here are strategies that are most likely to be 
valuable to you when reducing the taxes on your benefits:
 
✓ Minimize distributions from IRAs, pensions, and annuities. 
Don’t take money from one of these vehicles unless you need 
it. Every dollar distributed to you is included in gross income 
and AGI. Consider tapping other sources, such as taxable 
investment accounts first. If you have scheduled regular dis-
tributions from one of these vehicles, determine whether you 
can reduce the distributions. After age 701⁄2, when required 
minimum distributions from IRAs and pensions are imposed, 
this strategy is more difficult. Before then, limiting distribu-
tions to those needed to pay expenses may reduce the amount 
of benefits that are taxed.
 
✓ Change investment strategies in taxable accounts to mini-
mize gross income. Reduce trading in the account so capital 
gains are recognized less frequently. When gains are realized, 
sell investments in which you have losses to offset the gains. 
If the accounts hold mutual funds that frequently have high 
annual distributions, consider switching to funds with lower 
distributions.
 
✓ Consider using taxable accounts to purchase deferred annui-
ties. Income earned within an annuity is tax deferred; it won’t 
increase MAGI as long as it remains in the annuity. In addition, 
annuities aren’t subject to the required minimum distribution 
rules. For more information on annuities, see Chapter 4.
 
 This strategy probably isn’t worth using simply to avoid taxes 
on benefits. You need to consider a wide range of issues (such 
as whether an annuity fits with the rest of your portfolio and 
helps you meet your investment goals) before deciding an 
annuity is appropriate for you. Furthermore if you do decide 
to go this route, many different types of annuities are avail-
able, so make sure you know what you’re getting.

224
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
 
✓ Switch from taxable bonds to tax-exempt bonds. This move 
doesn’t directly reduce the amount of Social Security ben-
efits that are taxed. Tax-exempt interest is added back to AGI 
to reach MAGI. But the switch may indirectly reduce the tax 
on benefits, because tax-exempt bonds usually, though not 
always, pay lower interest rates than taxable bonds. When the 
tax-exempt interest is added back to AGI, it results in a lower 
MAGI than if the investments still were in higher-yielding tax-
able bonds.
 
✓ Shift income to family members other than your spouse. You 
don’t want to shift assets that are needed to maintain your 
standard of living. But when assets and the income from them 
exceed your needs, consider transferring income-producing 
investments to other family members. This transferring should 
be done only as part of a comprehensive estate planning strat-
egy with the reduction in taxes on Social Security benefits a 
side advantage.
Reducing your MAGI: Deduction strategies
The list in the preceding section includes ways you can reduce 
income and reduce MAGI. You also can take some deductions from 
gross income that can reduce MAGI. Even though itemized deduc-
tions (such as mortgage interest and charitable contributions) 
don’t reduce taxes on Social Security benefits, the following deduc-
tion strategies may help:
 
✓ Sell capital assets that have paper losses. Many investors 
don’t like to sell losing investments because the sale locks in 
the losses. A capital loss, however, can be used to your advan-
tage. One advantage is that the loss reduces MAGI and there-
fore the amount of Social Security benefits included in gross 
income. Capital losses first are deducted against capital gains 
dollar for dollar. Each dollar of loss offsets a dollar of gains 
and reduces MAGI by a dollar. If the losses exceed the gains 
for the year, up to $3,000 of the losses are deducted against 
ordinary income. If you still have excess losses, they’re carried 
forward to be used in future years in the same way.

225
 Chapter 10: Making Your Best Choices under Social Security
 
✓ Examine your portfolio for investments with paper losses. 
Sell those investments and make the losses deductible. If you 
still like the long-term prospects for the investments, you can 
repurchase them. If they’re securities (stocks, bonds, mutual 
funds), you have to wait more than 30 days to repurchase the 
same or substantially identical investments. If you don’t wait, 
the loss deductions are deferred. If you don’t want to wait to 
be back in the market, you can purchase investments that are 
similar but not substantially identical.
 
✓ Look for deductions for business losses. Eligible losses include 
those from partnerships, S corporations, and proprietorships. It 
may be possible to turn a hobby into a business that generates 
deductible losses. The losses are deductible if a profit is made 
in at least any three out of the last five consecutive years. The 
losses also can be deducted if the operation never earns a profit 
but is managed in a professional manner with the intention of 
making a profit. Remember: The rules for deducting business 
losses can be complicated, so you want to study the rules or 
receive qualified advice before deducting them.
Changing Your Mind: A Do-Over
Social Security benefit decisions generally are permanent, but some 
exceptions do exist. For example, a spouse can switch from retire-
ment benefits to spousal benefits or vice versa under some circum-
stances. You also can switch to survivor’s benefits after a spouse 
dies. You can begin retirement benefits and then suspend them as 
well (we discuss these three options earlier in this chapter).
Finally, you can change your mind with your Social Security ben-
efits in one other way — when you realize you may have made a 
mistake. Suppose you already are receiving Social Security retire-
ment benefits and decided you should have waited to a later age to 
begin benefits. Believe it or not, you may get a “do-over.” You may 
be able to change the beginning date of your benefits.

226
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
Deciding whether you 
should take a do-over
So how do you know whether you should consider changing your 
benefits with a do-over? You may find yourself in one of the follow-
ing situations:
 
✓ You elected to receive benefits without much thought and 
then realized you didn’t need them. This scenario is probably 
the most typical. You then believe your spouse would be better 
off if your benefits had a later starting date. You have enough in 
your investment portfolio to repay the benefits. At this time you 
may decide to file the do-over and pay back the benefits.
 
✓ Changed circumstances or a fresh review indicate later ben-
efits are better. People who began receiving benefits before 
age 70 should review their decision as they near FRA, or age 
70. It may make sense for them to repay the benefits received 
and apply for benefits at a later age.
 
 You may consider taking benefits at age 62 and then investing 
each benefit check in something relatively safe, such as CDs 
or high-grade, short-term bonds. Sometime by age 70 you’ll 
then complete Form 521 and send a check for the amount of 
benefits received (as described in the later section “Doing the 
do-over”). You keep the investment earnings and apply for the 
higher level of benefits you’re now due. You could invest for 
higher returns, but you take the risk of losing part of the prin-
cipal and having to use other resources to repay the benefits.
 
 Choosing benefits at an early age with the intention of repaying 
them later to earn the higher benefits can be risky. The SSA 
reports that about 100,000 people annually repay benefits to 
obtain higher benefits. It considers this a manageable and insig-
nificant number. But if more people use the strategy or 
Congress objects to it, the repayment option could be elimi-
nated. You may find yourself locked into the lower benefit with 
no way out. But for those who made the early benefits decision 

227
 Chapter 10: Making Your Best Choices under Social Security
and now believe higher benefits would be worth the expense, 
this procedure is available to increase their benefits. Check with 
your financial advisor for help before taking any action.
Before you decide to take a do-over, you need to consider a few 
points to make sure you don’t make another mistake. Think of the 
following:
 
✓ Your heirs: The money taken from your investment portfo-
lio to repay the benefit would be available to your heirs if it 
remained in your portfolio. When it’s shifted to Social Security, 
it buys you higher lifetime benefits and perhaps your spouse 
higher survivor’s benefits, but none of it is available for your 
children or charity.
 
✓ Income taxes: Your Social Security benefits may be subject to 
income taxes. We discuss this possibility in the earlier section 
“Being Aware of Potential Income Taxes on Your Benefits.” 
When annuity payments are received, part of each payment 
is a tax-free return of principal and part is taxable ordinary 
income. The ratio of tax-free to taxable portion of the pay-
ments depends on your age. For example, for a 70-year-old 
married couple, 64 percent of a joint annuity’s payments 
would be excluded from gross income. When Social Security 
benefits are received, from 0 percent to 85 percent of the 
benefits are included in gross income, with the percentage 
depending on your level of income.
 
✓ The opportunity cost of repaying Social Security: The money 
you repay wouldn’t be in your portfolio to invest. This doesn’t 
seem like a steep cost when markets are in decline and inter-
est rates are low (as they were during a good part of the 
2000s). But remember that good investment markets may 
offer higher returns than either the annuity or Social Security. 
There is great uncertainty about market returns, however.
 
✓ No additional benefits after age 70: If you already have 
passed age 70, the payoff from trading up declines. Social 
Security benefits don’t increase after age 70, regardless of how 
long after age 70 you wait to begin benefits. In addition, you 
would be required to repay more months of early benefits in 
order to receive the higher benefits.

228
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
Doing the do-over
To complete a Social Security do-over, just follow these steps:
 
1. Complete Social Security Form 521, “Request for Withdrawal 
of Application.”
 
 Filling out this form is simple. You can find a copy of the form at 
any Social Security office or online at www.socialsecurity.
gov.
 
2. Submit the form with repayment of all the benefits paid to 
date.
 
 Repaying may seem like a stiff price for a change, but keep in 
mind that no interest is charged. You return only the amount 
received, even if you invested the money and earned a good 
return on it. In return, after repaying the benefits you can 
change the start date of your benefits so you receive higher 
benefits every month for the rest of your life. Your spouse may 
receive higher survivor’s benefits as well.
Looking at What the Future 
Holds for Social Security
Each year, usually in May, the trustees of Social Security and 
Medicare issue reports on the financial status of the programs. 
The reports have worsened over the years. As the Baby Boom 
generation approaches normal retirement age (the first Boomers 
turn 65 in 2011), the financial strain on the system is expected to 
increase because the Boomers aren’t being replaced in the work-
force at the same rate they’re expected to retire.
The 2009 report estimates that in 2016 Social Security will begin 
paying out more in benefits than it receives in taxes; it also pro-
jects that the trust fund will be exhausted in 2037. Although this 
may paint an unhappy picture, it doesn’t mean you should write 
off Social Security and assume no benefits will be available to you. 
If you’re already a senior American, the government is likely to 

229
 Chapter 10: Making Your Best Choices under Social Security
find a way to pay you the full benefits you expected. It would be 
difficult politically to reduce promised benefits to a large, finan-
cially vulnerable and politically powerful part of the population.
Most people overlook one positive factor from the report. Each 
year the trustees estimate that annual Social Security tax revenues 
will finance 70–75 percent of scheduled benefits almost indefi-
nitely. This means Social Security will be able to pay most of the 
promised benefits for many years. Congress will make changes, 
but those changes won’t include a complete cessation or dramatic 
reduction of benefits. Rather than eliminating Social Security 
retirement benefits, Congress is likely to take a combination of the 
following actions:
 
✓ Means-testing of benefits: Benefits may be reduced or elimi-
nated for higher-income seniors. Another form of means-
testing is to include more Social Security benefits in gross 
income. What’s unknown at this point is the income level at 
which means-testing may be imposed.
 
✓ A change in the replacement ratio: The replacement ratio is 
the percentage of your working years’ income received in Social 
Security benefits. For example, someone earning less than 
$20,000 is likely to receive Social Security benefits equal to 90 
percent or more of that income. The replacement ratio declines 
as income rises. The formula may be changed so that those 
with higher incomes in their working years have their replace-
ment ratios reduced. It’s possible that people at some income 
levels will receive no Social Security retirement benefits.
 
✓ A change in the index to determine initial benefits: The 
initial benefit payment is determined by taking a worker’s 
lifetime wages earned and inflating them based on average 
U.S. wage growth over the worker’s career. Historically, the 
Consumer Price Index (CPI) has risen at a lower rate than 
wages. In the future, the inflation adjustment may be based 
on increases in the CPI or a fixed rate instead of the growth in 
wages. This would lower initial benefits, but few people would 
notice and no one would see an actual reduction in benefits 
already being received. The change also could apply only to 
those age 50 and younger.

230
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
 
✓ A change in the formula that indexes the benefits for 
inflation: Beneficiaries could receive less than full inflation 
indexing on their benefits.
 
✓ A rise in payroll taxes: Those still working would pay more 
to fund their own benefits and the benefits of those already 
retired. The tax increase wouldn’t have to be across the 
board. Instead, the earnings limit on which Social Security 
taxes are imposed ($106,800 in tax year 2010) could be raised 
or eliminated.
Social Security’s solvency also may be improved by actions of 
beneficiaries. If fewer Baby Boomers are financially prepared for 
retirement, they may work longer and delay benefits. Because 
they would pay more taxes into the program during those addi-
tional working years, the financial condition of the program would 
improve. The improvement isn’t likely to be enough to prevent any 
future changes to the program, but it would extend its life for some 
years and allow other changes, such as higher taxes and reduced 
benefits, to be less extreme. The program’s financial health also 
could be improved if the young working population increases 
faster than expected.
Although we don’t expect the elimination or dramatic reduction 
of Social Security benefits, we do recommend that you make plans 
for possible changes in benefits. Those with higher retirement 
incomes should leave a cushion in their retirement budgets to 
accommodate possible means-testing. Those not already retired 
should plan for the possibility of lower retirement benefits than 
currently promised and higher taxes at some point during their 
working years.

Getting the Most Out of Medicare
In This Chapter
▶ Surveying the four parts of Medicare coverage
▶ Deciding whether to buy a Medicare supplement policy
▶ Reviewing some sticky coverage situations
M
edicare, a government-run medical expense insurance 
program, is the program used by most Americans ages 
65 and older. Fewer and fewer retirees receive coverage through 
employers or union plans, leaving most seniors without an afford-
able alternative to Medicare. Medicare (www.medicare.gov) 
covers most medical services and supplies received in hospitals, 
doctors’ offices, and in other health care settings. The coverage 
is split among several parts of Medicare, and you may choose 
which of those parts to use. You also have choices within some 
of those parts. Medicare doesn’t cover all the medical care a 
senior needs. Some seniors who have Medicare buy supplemen-
tal insurance to fill gaps in Medicare coverage.
All the options Medicare offers can make the program confusing, 
but in this chapter, we sort out the choices and show you how 
to make the best decisions. To muddy the waters even further, 
Medicare has exhaustive regulations explaining what it covers and 
how much it will pay. We review the essentials to give you a good 
idea of what’s covered and what you’ll have to pay from your per-
sonal assets (or obtain other insurance to cover).
In this chapter, we explore Medicare’s four parts:

232
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
 
✓ Part A: This part provides hospital coverage.
 
✓ Part B: Also called Original Medicare, this part covers outpa-
tient medical services such as visits to doctors.
 
✓ Part C: Also called Medicare Advantage, this part is offered 
by private insurers as an alternative to Original Medicare and 
usually provides broader coverage.
 
✓ Part D: This part provides prescription drug coverage.
We also review Medicare supplemental insurance policies, which 
cover some or all the care and supplies not covered by Medicare. 
The supplemental policies are offered by private insurers.
Our goal in this chapter is to help you sort through the choices to 
make decisions that provide the coverage you need while keep-
ing out-of-pocket outlays low. Simply selecting the option with the 
lowest premium often isn’t the best choice.
 
Even if you have been in Medicare for a while and are happy with 
your choices, don’t skip this chapter. Costs and options in plans 
change frequently, and Medicare has an open enrollment period 
each year that allows beneficiaries to change plans. You should 
take a fresh look at the options annually. You may find that you can 
do better that year.
Starting Medicare: A Broad 
Overview of Enrollment Deadlines
You don’t want to miss the first date to sign up for Medicare. 
Except for in a few circumstances, you may have to pay a cost 
if you miss the deadline. Some people are confused about the 
sign-up deadlines, because the deadlines vary depending on the 
Medicare part. Good news: We’re here to help sort everything out.
 
We devote a section of this chapter to each of these Medicare 
parts. So, because this is an overview of the enrollment deadlines, 
you can find more information regarding each part in the respective 
sections in this chapter. The following lists the Medicare part with 
its respective deadlines and penalties:

233
 Chapter 11: Getting the Most Out of Medicare
 
✓ Part A: This part has no premium for those meeting eligibil-
ity requirements, and you’re automatically enrolled if you 
qualify. So, you don’t have any deadlines to meet. Those 
who don’t qualify may enroll and pay a premium. The initial 
enrollment period for those who want to pay is three months 
before your 65th birthday, the month of your birthday, and 
the three months following your 65th birthday. There also is a 
general enrollment period each year from January 1 to March 
31. Finally, there are special enrollment periods for those 
who delayed signing up because they had employer coverage 
during the initial enrollment period.
 
✓ Part B: You have a seven-month window for initial enrollment 
in this part of Medicare. The window is three months before 
your 65th birthday, the month of your birthday, and the three 
months following your 65th birthday. You’re exempt from 
the initial sign-up deadline and penalties for delay if you have 
retiree health coverage from an employer. But beware: Many 
employer retiree plans require eligible members to sign up for 
Part B and cover only items Part B doesn’t. These plans don’t 
qualify for the exception.
 
 If you miss the initial enrollment deadline, you can sign up 
during the six-week enrollment period that begins November 
15 each year, but you’ll pay a higher premium. The amount of 
the penalty depends on how long you waited to enroll. (You 
must sign up for Part B to enroll in a Part C plan.)
 
✓ Part D: The eligibility date and initial enrollment periods for 
this part are the same as for Part B. And if you buy a Part D 
policy after the initial eligibility periods, a penalty increases 
your premium. The penalty is 1 percent of the national base 
premium amount for each full month you delayed enrolling. 
The penalty can increase each year as the base premium 
changes. You avoid the penalty if you delayed enrolling in Part 
D because you had creditable coverage.
 
✓ Medigap plans: You’re guaranteed an opportunity to buy 
a Medigap policy during the six months that begin on the 
first day of the month in which you’re both 65 or older and 
enrolled in Part B. (Some states have other open enrollment 
periods.) Under Medicare law, you won’t incur a premium pen-
alty for enrollment after this period, but you won’t be guaran-
teed an opportunity to buy a policy.

234
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
Understanding Part A
Part A covers hospitalization and similar services and is the sim-
plest part of Medicare. In general terms it covers the following:
 
✓ Inpatient care in hospitals (including critical access hospitals 
and inpatient rehabilitation facilities)
 
✓ Inpatient stays in skilled nursing facilities (but not custodial or 
long-term care)
 
✓ Hospice care services
 
✓ Home health care services
 
✓ Inpatient care in a religious nonmedical health care institution 
(a facility providing nonmedical, nonreligious health care 
items and services to people who need hospital or skilled 
nursing facility care that wouldn’t be in agreement with their 
religious beliefs)
 
Part A is free, which means that unlike other parts of Medicare, 
most beneficiaries don’t pay premiums. Of course, it’s not really 
free; you paid for the coverage with taxes while working.
In the following sections, we provide everything you need to know 
about Part A, including who’s eligible and what coverage you can 
expect to have.
Seeing who’s eligible and 
signing up for Part A
For most people, eligibility for Part A depends on being eligible 
for Social Security. To receive Part A premium-free, you must be 
eligible for Social Security. That means you must have paid taxes 
into the system for at least 40 quarters (10 years) while either an 
employee or self-employed. (See Chapter 10 for more information 
on Social Security.)

235
 Chapter 11: Getting the Most Out of Medicare
Most people who are eligible for Part A are automatically enrolled. 
Here’s the lowdown on automatic enrollment for the different 
groups:
 
✓ Anyone receiving Social Security benefits or Railroad 
Retirement benefits is automatically enrolled on the first day 
of the month he turns age 65. Your Medicare card should 
arrive in the mail three months before your 65th birthday.
 
✓ If you’re under 65 and received disability benefits from Social 
Security (or in some cases Railroad Retirement disability ben-
efits) for 24 months, you’re automatically enrolled after those 
24 months. You should receive your Medicare card during 
your 25th month of disability.
 
✓ If you have ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease), you’re automatically 
enrolled in Part A the month disability benefits begin.
 
If you don’t qualify for Part A but want to be covered under it, you 
may be able to enroll and pay premiums. In order to do so, you 
must still meet one of the following criteria:
 
✓ You must be 65 or older, entitled to enroll or be enrolling in 
Part B, and be a citizen or resident of the United States.
 
✓ You’re under 65, disabled, and premium-free Part A coverage 
ended because you returned to work.
If you choose to pay for Part A, you also must enroll in Part B and 
pay its premiums. The premiums change each year. The premiums 
for Part A in 2010 are $461 monthly for those with less than 30 
quarters of Medicare covered employment and $254 monthly for 
those with 30 –39 quarters of Medicare covered employment. The 
premiums for Part B are $110.50 per month in 2010 for most mem-
bers. Your state may help pay the premiums if you meet its income 
and asset limits. 
 
If you don’t sign up for Part A when you’re first eligible, your 
premium will increase by 10 percent for a period of time. If you 
delayed signing up for two years, for example, you’ll pay the higher 
premium for four years.

236
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
If you aren’t eligible for free Part A and want to buy it, you can 
enroll only during the following periods:
 
✓ Initial enrollment period: This is the period you’re first eli-
gible for Medicare, which is three months before you turn 65 
to three months after the month you turn 65.
 
✓ General enrollment period: This period extends from January 1 
to March 31 each year.
 
✓ Special enrollment period: This special period is available to 
you if you delayed enrolling because you or your spouse was 
employed and had a group health plan from work. It’s also 
available if you are disabled but delayed enrolling because 
you or your spouse was working and had a group health plan. 
In either case, you can enroll in Part A anytime while working 
and under the group health plan or during the eight-month 
period that begins when either the employment or the group 
coverage ends.
 
✓ Special enrollment for international volunteers: Generally, 
if you delayed signing up for Part A because you had health 
insurance while volunteering in a foreign country for a tax-
exempt organization for at least a year, you can enroll in Part 
A during the six-month period that begins the first month any 
of the following happened: 
 
• You stop volunteering outside the United States.
 
• You’re still outside the U.S. but no longer have medical 
coverage outside the U.S.
 
• When the sponsoring organization is no longer tax 
exempt.
 
Folks who aren’t receiving Social Security benefits but are eligible 
for them and for premium-free Part A need to sign up for Part A by 
contacting the Social Security Administration (SSA) three months 
before turning 65. For example, you still may be working or decided 
to wait until a later age to receive Social Security. (See Chapter 10 
for discussions of when you may want to delay Social Security ben-
efits. We also provide SSA contact info there.)

237
 Chapter 11: Getting the Most Out of Medicare
Defining Part A coverage
Part A of Medicare generally covers hospital stays and similar 
inpatient care and services. But the coverage isn’t unlimited. The 
types of covered care and the dollar amounts are restricted.
Coverage limits for Part A are based on the benefit period. Under 
Medicare, a benefit period begins the day you enter a hospital or 
skilled nursing facility. It ends when you haven’t received inpatient 
care in such facilities for 60 days in a row. If you need inpatient 
care after that, a new benefit period begins.
Medicare’s coverage and payment limits for the three main types 
of inpatient care are described in the following sections. Keep 
in mind that the dollar amounts we include are for 2010; they’re 
adjusted each year.
 
In addition to the following three types of inpatient care, Part A also 
pays for hospice care and the cost of blood after the first three 
pints in a calendar year.
Hospital stays
Coverage in this category is for a semiprivate room, meals, general 
nursing, drugs as part of your inpatient treatment, and other hos-
pital services and supplies. Places where these inpatient services 
are covered include acute care hospitals, critical access hospi-
tals, inpatient rehabilitation facilities, long-term care hospitals, 
and inpatient care as part of a qualifying clinical research study. 
Inpatient mental health care also is covered.
Items and services that Part A doesn’t cover include private-duty 
nursing, a television or telephone in your room, or personal care 
items like razors or slipper socks. A private room isn’t covered 
unless it’s medically necessary.
 
Note that services delivered by doctors while you’re in the hospital 
aren’t covered by Part A. They may be covered by Part B or other 
insurance. Otherwise you must pay for them with your personal 
resources.

238
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
Part A doesn’t pay the full cost of all these services. For hospital 
stays during days 1 through 60 of the benefit period, you pay a 
deductible of $1,100. For days 61 through 90 you pay $275 per day. 
After 90 days, you start using lifetime reserve days. Lifetime reserve 
days are days when you need inpatient hospital or skilled nursing 
facility care beyond 90 days in a benefit period. You get 60 lifetime 
reserve days during your lifetime. Coverage for inpatient mental 
health care in a psychiatric hospital is limited to 190 days in a life-
time. These amounts are for 2010, and are adjusted each year.
 
Medicare pays all covered costs except for a daily coinsurance 
amount of $550 for each lifetime reserve day. So, you pay $550 per 
day for each day after 90 days in a benefit period, until your lifetime 
reserve days are used. You pay all hospitalization costs after using 
all the lifetime reserve days.
Skilled nursing facilities
This coverage includes a semiprivate room, meals, skilled nurs-
ing and rehabilitative services, and other services and supplies 
for up to 100 days in a benefit period. But the coverage kicks 
in only after a minimum three-day inpatient hospital stay for a 
related illness or injury. So only care needed for rehabilitation or 
recovery from an illness or surgery qualifies. Your doctor must 
certify that you need daily skilled care like intravenous injections 
or physical therapy. Medicare doesn’t cover long-term care or 
custodial nursing home care.
 
The first 20 days of the skilled nursing facility stay are fully covered 
and then you pay $137.50 per day for days 21 through 100 of the 
benefit period. You pay all costs after day 100 in the benefit period.
Home health care
As with skilled nursing care, home health care is covered only 
after a hospital stay. Home care is limited to the first 100 home 
health visits following a hospital stay, and you must be home-
bound to be covered. The care must be medically-necessary 
part-time or intermittent skilled nursing care or physical therapy, 
speech-language pathology, or a continuing need for occupational 
therapy. Care also must be ordered by a doctor and provided by 
a Medicare-certified home health agency. Home health services 

239
 Chapter 11: Getting the Most Out of Medicare
also may include medical social services, part-time or intermittent 
home health aide services, durable medical equipment, and medi-
cal supplies for use at home.
 
Medicare-approved home health care services are fully covered 
and you pay 20 percent of the Medicare-approved amount for dura-
ble medical equipment.
Exploring Parts B and C
Seniors use Part B or C of Medicare the most, whichever one they 
choose. Parts B and C are considered together, because they’re 
alternatives; the other parts of Medicare stand alone.
 
Here’s the process for signing up for Parts B and C:
 
1. You first must join Part B and pay the Part B premium.
 
2. You then choose to be covered by either Original Medicare 
under Part B or a Medicare Advantage plan under Part C.
 
 If you join an Advantage plan, the sponsor may pay all or part 
of your Part B premium.
Part B is a fee-for-service plan run by the government (though it 
contracts with insurance companies that administer the details). 
Part C is offered by private insurers and includes the coverage of 
both Parts A and B and often additional coverage.
About three-quarters of enrollees choose Part B, but Part C has 
been growing rapidly since being introduced in 1997. In the follow-
ing sections, we review Part B first and then Part C. In each discus-
sion we review the main features of each plan and the factors to 
consider when making a choice.
Scoping out Part B
Part B, which is also referred to as Original Medicare, helps cover 
medical care received outside a hospital or similar facility. It covers 
medically-necessary services like doctors’ services, outpatient care, 

240
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
and other medical services. Medically-necessary services are services 
or supplies needed for the diagnosis or treatment of a medical con-
dition and that meet accepted standards of medical practice. Part B 
also covers some preventive services, which are to prevent illness or 
detect it at an early stage.
Part B is a fee-for-service plan. Under a fee-for-service plan, you 
pick the doctor or other medical provider. The doctor must 
choose to participate in Medicare and must be accepting new 
Medicare patients, however. You don’t need a referral for a spe-
cialist or approval from Medicare before incurring an expense. If 
the care is covered by Medicare, the program pays its share of 
the cost. You pay any deductibles, copayments, or other amounts 
for the covered care. (These costs are discussed in the section 
“Paying for Part B.”)
 
The list of care covered by Part B is extensive, but still many medi-
cal services aren’t covered. Services not covered include the follow-
ing: most care needed when traveling outside the U.S., acupuncture, 
most chiropractic services, cosmetic surgery, custodial care, most 
dental care, eye exams and eyeglasses, foot care, hearing aids, long-
term care, many laboratory tests, orthopedic shoes, most routine 
physical exams (except for a one-time “Welcome to Medicare” exam 
in the first year of enrollment), most prescription drugs (though 
these may be covered under Part D or a Medicare Supplement 
policy), many procedures in ambulatory surgical facilities, and 
syringes or insulin. You must pay for noncovered care with your 
own funds or by purchasing other coverage, such as a Medicare 
Supplement policy.
 
A summary of covered and noncovered services under Part B is in 
the book Medicare & You, which is available free online at www.
medicare.gov or by calling 800-MEDICARE (800-633-4227). You 
also can obtain this book through your local Medicare office or area 
Office on Aging.
Signing up for Part B
If you want to be covered by Part B, you generally don’t have to 
take action. If you’re receiving Social Security benefits or Railroad 
Retirement benefits, you’re automatically enrolled in Part B on the 
first day of the month you turn age 65.

241
 Chapter 11: Getting the Most Out of Medicare
You’ll receive a Medicare card in the mail about three months 
before your 65th birthday. Instructions accompanying the card tell 
you what to do if you don’t want Part B, including returning the 
card. If you keep the card, you’ll be enrolled in Part B. Your pre-
miums will be deducted from Social Security benefits.
 
You may be eligible for Part B even though you aren’t receiving 
Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits. In that case, you 
need to sign up for Part B during the initial enrollment period that 
begins three months before your 65th birthday and ends three 
months after your 65th birthday.
If you missed the initial enrollment period, you have other oppor-
tunities to sign up:
 
✓ General enrollment period: Between January 1 and March 31 
each year, any eligible person can enroll in Part B.
 
 You’ll incur a penalty for missing the initial enrollment period 
and signing up during this period. Your premium will increase 
10 percent for each 12-month period you didn’t sign up for 
Part B after you could have. The penalty usually lasts as long 
as you’re enrolled in Part B. You may avoid the penalty if you 
qualify for the special enrollment period.
 
✓ Special enrollment period: You may delay signing up for Part 
B without penalty if you or your spouse was working at the 
time of your initial eligibility and was covered by a medical 
plan through work. You may sign up for Part B any time while 
you’re covered under those circumstances or during the eight-
month period beginning the earlier of when the employment 
ends or the group medical coverage ends.
 
✓ Special enrollment for international volunteers: Generally 
if you delayed signing up for Part A because you had health 
insurance while volunteering in a foreign country, you can 
enroll in Part A during the six-month period that begins the 
first month any of the following happens:
 
• You stop volunteering outside the United States.
 
• You no longer have medical coverage outside the U.S.
 
• When the sponsoring organization is no longer tax-
exempt (whichever comes first).

242
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
 
Medicare reduced its reimbursements to doctors in recent years. 
As a result, a number of doctors won’t accept new Medicare 
patients; some won’t accept any Medicare patients at all. Before 
deciding to join Original Medicare under Part B, check with any 
doctors you like to verify that they participate in Medicare and will 
accept you as a Medicare patient.
Paying for Part B
Part B shares most covered costs with the beneficiary — it pays 
about half the medical costs of its beneficiaries. Part B has three 
expenses: monthly premiums, a deductible, and copayments. The 
following sections outline them. The specific amounts generally 
change annually.
Premiums
Part B has a monthly premium that’s deducted from your monthly 
Social Security benefits. If you’re a Part B member not receiving 
Social Security benefits, you’re billed for the premium. The basic 
premium, which is determined each year, is set so that it covers 25 
percent of the actual cost of Part B. In 2010 the basic premium was 
$110.50.
Medicare became a means-tested program beginning in 2007. 
Instead of everyone paying the same premium, those with higher 
incomes pay higher premiums. (The higher premiums also are 
called a surtax.) The premiums are based on a person’s modified 
adjusted gross income, or MAGI. Modified adjusted gross income 
is the adjusted gross income on your tax return increased by any 
tax-exempt interest, EE savings bond interest used for education 
expenses, and excluded foreign earned income you earned.
 
The higher premiums begin for single taxpayers with a MAGI of 
$85,000 and for married taxpayers filing jointly with a MAGI of 
$170,000. The premiums increase on a sliding scale as the MAGI 
rises; beneficiaries in the highest income bracket are estimated to 
pay 80 percent of the per capita cost of Medicare for the year.
You’ll notice a two-year lag between when your income is earned 
and when it affects your Medicare premiums. For example, the 
2008 income tax returns are used to determine 2010 Medicare 

243
 Chapter 11: Getting the Most Out of Medicare
premiums. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) receives your tax 
return and transmits the information to the SSA. Then, the SSA 
processes the information and sends you a letter sometime after 
mid-November listing your monthly Medicare premium for the fol-
lowing year. You can choose to have the higher premium withheld 
from your Social Security benefits as with the regular premiums, or 
you can pay the amount separately. Table 11-1 lists the premiums 
and surtaxes for different income levels in 2010.

$320,001–$428,000
$353.60
Above $214,000
Above $428,000
You can avoid higher Medicare premiums in two different ways. 
The following list spells out your two options:
 
✓ Plan your finances to minimize MAGI. Most basic tax plan-
ning strategies that reduce adjusted gross income (AGI) also 
will reduce MAGI. The exceptions are for the items that are 
added back to AGI:
 
• Tax-exempt interest
 
• EE savings bond interest used for education purposes
 
• Foreign-earned income
 
 You can limit withdrawals from retirement plans and annuities 
to only the amounts needed for spending and required by law 
or contract. Avoid selling assets to recognize capital gains in 
taxable accounts, or sell assets with losses to offset the gains. 
Losses from business activities also will reduce MAGI.

244
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
 
 Itemized deductions on Schedule A of the tax return, such as 
mortgage interest and charitable contributions, don’t reduce 
MAGI.
 
✓ Appeal the decision. Because the income used to determine 
the premiums is two years old, you can appeal the premium 
if your financial situation has changed. Changes that result in 
lower premiums include
 
• Divorce
 
• A spouse’s death
 
• Job loss
 
• Reduced working hours
 
• Retirement
 
• Bankruptcy
 
 Details about the factors that will be considered regarding the 
appeal and how to file it are included with the letter announc-
ing your premium.
Deductible
Medicare Part B doesn’t begin paying benefits until you pay the 
annual deductible, which was $155 in 2010. In other words, you 
pay the first $155 of covered care, and then Part B’s coverage 
kicks in after that. The deductible may be adjusted annually as 
Medicare’s costs change.
Coinsurance
Many services covered by Part B carry a coinsurance or copayment. 
The coinsurance usually is a percentage of the Medicare-approved 
amount for the service. A copayment is a fixed amount you pay per 
treatment or service. The Medicare-approved amount is the price 
Medicare sets for the service. For most covered serv-ices, you pay 
20 percent of the Medicare-approved amount as coinsurance.
 
Ask your doctor or other provider whether she accepts the 
Medicare assignment. If she does, that means she agrees to charge 
you no more than the Medicare coinsurance or copayment after 
Medicare pays its share. Providers that don’t accept the assignment 

245
 Chapter 11: Getting the Most Out of Medicare
can charge you a higher amount than the coinsurance percentage of 
the Medicare-approved amount. The additional charge, however, is 
limited to an additional 15 percent of the Medicare-approved 
amount.
Probing Part C: Medicare Advantage
Part C is better known as Medicare Advantage. Medicare benefici-
aries choose between Part B and Part C. The main difference 
between the two is this: With Part C, rather than the government 
offering a plan, many private insurers, both for-profit and nonprofit, 
offer different plans. You choose which plan to join. The number of 
plans offered depends on where you live. Areas with a large number 
of Medicare beneficiaries offer dozens of plans. Some sparsely-
populated rural areas offer few or no Medicare Advantage plans.
The plans offered under Part C, including their costs, are approved 
by Medicare before they’re offered. Plans must meet certain guide-
lines for coverage and other features before receiving approval. 
The plans receive a fixed amount per Medicare member from 
Medicare every month.
Most Advantage plans charge a monthly or annual premium. It 
could be the same or less than the monthly premium for Part B. 
Clarify whether the premium is in addition to the Part B premium 
or in lieu of it. (Even though you aren’t in Part B Original Medicare 
when you join a Part C plan, you still must enroll in Part B and pay 
the Part B premium. Either you pay the premium, or the plan pays 
it on your behalf.)
We give you the rundown of the Part C details in the following sec-
tions, including the coverage you can expect, how to change plans, 
and the best ways to research the different plans.
Becoming familiar with the Part C plans
All Medicare Advantage plans must provide at least the same 
coverage as Original Medicare, both Parts A and B. However, one 
appeal of Medicare Advantage plans is that they usually cover 

246
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
more than Original Medicare and at a lower out-of-pocket cost to 
most members. They often have additional coverage such as pre-
scription drugs, dental, vision, hearing, and health and wellness 
programs. The Advantage plans set their own deductibles, copay-
ments, and coinsurance. Often you pay a fixed amount or percent-
age for a doctor’s visit or other treatment.
Most Medicare Advantage plans are a version of managed care in 
the following two forms:
 
✓ Health maintenance organizations (HMOs): If you belong 
to an HMO and want to use a doctor or other provider who 
doesn’t belong to the network, you pay the full cost. HMOs 
often must approve certain types of care and treatment by 
specialists before they’re covered.
 
✓ Preferred provider organizations (PPOs): If you’re covered 
by a PPO and want to see an out-of-network professional, you 
pay a higher cost than you would for seeing an in-network 
provider. 
 
You have a few other choices with the different Advantage plans 
available. The following also are options, although they’re less 
common:
 
✓ Private fee-for-service (PFFS) plans: This type is the fastest-
growing Part C plan. It’s similar to Part B in that you’re 
covered for treatment by any Medicare-approved medical pro-
vider, and you don’t need advance approval for treatment by a 
specialist. You may find, however, not all providers will accept 
the PFFS plan. (The plan has its own reimbursement rates and 
policies, and the provider doesn’t have to accept them.) So 
before signing up for a PFFS plan, be sure any doctors, hospi-
tals, and other medical providers you like will accept the plan. 
Beginning in 2011, PFFS plans have to form networks similar 
to PPOs in any area in which at least two Medicare Advantage 
plans are offered.
 
✓ Medical savings accounts (MSAs): These plans combine 
a high-deductible insurance policy and a bank or savings 
account. Medicare pays the plan a fixed amount annually for 
each member, and the plan deposits a portion of this money 

247
 Chapter 11: Getting the Most Out of Medicare
into your MSA. You pay for all your care until you reach the 
deductible for the year, using both money from the MSA and 
personal funds. The amount deposited in your MSA is likely to 
be less than the deductible for the year. If you don’t use the 
entire MSA during the year, the balance is carried forward to 
the next year. After your medical spending for covered serv-
ices reaches the deductible, the plan pays for any care that 
would be covered under Part B. You pay for any medical care 
you receive that isn’t covered by Medicare. Keep in mind that 
you may need to pay copayments for some care.
 
✓ Special needs plans (SNPs): These plans are for people who 
live in institutions such as nursing homes, who are eligible for 
both Medicare and Medicaid, or who have certain chronic con-
ditions such as diabetes or congestive heart failure. Members 
generally have a primary doctor who coordinates all their 
care. Treatment generally must be by doctors and hospitals in 
the plan’s network.
 
Before choosing an Advantage plan, make sure you investigate the 
following two important issues:
 
✓ Verify limits on service providers. Verify that primary doc-
tors and specialists you like are in the network and, if not, 
what your cost would be to use them. Most HMOs and PPOs 
limit specialist treatment and referrals. Be sure you under-
stand the rules and are comfortable with them. Also, ask 
which hospitals in the area participate. This information is 
especially important in areas where some hospitals have 
better reputations than others.
 
✓ Estimate your out-of-pocket costs under different levels of 
care. The array of copayments and deductibles in some plans 
is confusing. Estimate how much you’re likely to pay in a 
typical year. Add up the copayments for your typical annual 
doctor visits, medications, and any other medical services you 
normally receive. Assume that your health will change and 
you need more care. Estimate your out-of-pocket costs for dif-
ferent types of care and treatment. Compare the out-of-pocket 
costs of an Advantage plan with Original Medicare.

248
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
 
A predecessor to Medicare Advantage plans, known as 
Medicare+Choice plans, was very popular. Congress then reduced 
the amount it paid the plans for each member. Some insurers 
decided the plans would be unprofitable and discontinued them. 
Other insurers raised plan prices or reduced benefits to the point 
that many members returned to Original Medicare. If you sign up 
for an Advantage plan, be aware that such changes could happen 
again. If an Advantage plan is discontinued, the sponsor will send 
you a letter stating your options. Usually you’re automatically 
transferred to Original Medicare unless you choose another 
Advantage plan by a certain date.
Joining or changing Advantage plans
You have freedom to join or change membership in Advantage 
plans or switch from traditional Medicare to an Advantage plan, 
but you can take the actions only at certain times. You can make 
your moves during the following times:
 
✓ Initial enrollment period: When you’re first eligible for 
Medicare, you can join either Original Medicare or an 
Advantage plan during the usual Medicare sign-up period of 
three months before the month you turn 65 through three 
months after turning 65.
 
✓ Annual open enrollment season: Medicare has an annual six-
week enrollment period from November 15 through December 
31. During this period, you can switch from Part B to Part 
C, from Part C to Part B, or from one Part C plan to another. 
When you missed your initial enrollment period, you can join 
a plan during this period. The coverage under your new plan 
begins January 1 of the following year.
 
✓ General enrollment period: An enrollment period for Part C 
takes place between January 1 and March 31 each year. You 
can join, switch, or drop a plan during this period, but the 
change won’t be effective until July 1. During this period, there 
are a few actions you can’t take. During this period, you aren’t 
allowed to join, switch, or drop a Medicare MSA plan. Also, 
you can’t join or switch to a plan with prescription drug cover-
age unless you already have prescription drug coverage under 
Part D.

249
 Chapter 11: Getting the Most Out of Medicare
 
Generally a choice under Medicare is fixed for the calendar year. 
You can’t change until the next enrollment period — and that 
change isn’t effective until January 1 of the following year. At other 
times, you can change only under the following exceptions:
 
✓ When you move out of a plan’s service area
 
✓ When you’re covered under both Medicare and Medicaid
 
✓ When you live in an institution, such as a nursing home
 
✓ When you qualify under Medicare’s program for help to those 
with limited income and resources
Researching Part C plans
Medicare reviews and approves all Part C plans and has most of 
the information about them. Medicare offers the following two 
ways for you to find out about and compare the plans offered in 
your area:
 
✓ You can visit the Medicare Web site. This site (which can be 
found at www.medicare.gov) has a feature called “Medicare 
Options Compare.” This feature does the following:
 
• Provides a summary of each plan and lets you dig deeper 
into the details of individual plans
 
• Estimates annual out-of-pocket costs if you enter informa-
tion about your health and medications
 
• Allows you to compare up to three plans on one screen 
and to sort the plans for certain features that are priori-
ties for you
 
 The Medicare Web site also has contact information for each 
plan, so you can get any information you don’t find on the 
Web site.
 
✓ You can call 800-MEDICARE (800-633-4227). If you’re not 
computer savvy, don’t worry. The operators at this toll-free 
number have the information from the Web site available to 
them, so they can discuss all the options with you.

250
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
You may be able to enroll in the Medicare Advantage plan of your 
choice directly from the Medicare Web site. Otherwise, you con-
tact the plan through the mail, telephone, or its Web site. Most 
plans allow you to enroll through any of these media.
 
As you’re researching the different plans, don’t automatically 
choose the policy with the lowest premium. Check the other costs 
and estimate your total out-of-pocket costs for the year. Also, look 
at the details of the plans, not just the summaries. Examine the cov-
erage for hospital stays and skilled nursing facility care. Check out 
limits on items such as chemotherapy, blood transfusions used in 
transplants or other major surgery, and elective treatments such as 
hip replacement. Under some plans, if you need these types of care 
you could pay more than you would under Original Medicare.
Qualifying for Prescription Drug 
Coverage with Part D
You can get prescription drug coverage under Medicare two 
ways. We discuss one way earlier in this chapter: Join a Medicare 
Advantage plan under Part C that covers prescription drugs. The 
other way, for those who chose Original Medicare coverage under 
Part B, is to buy a prescription drug coverage policy under Part D 
of Medicare. We discuss Part D in this section.
Don’t buy Part C or Part D by phone
The law contains some protections to 
consumers considering the purchase 
of Part C Medicare Advantage plans 
and Part D prescription drug plans. 
Sellers and sponsors of these plans 
aren’t allowed to initiate sales contact 
by telephone or by visiting your home. 
Anyone who contacts you in these ways 
representing an insurer or selling these 
policies is violating the law unless you 
contacted them first. Make sure you 
don’t buy a policy from them.

251
 Chapter 11: Getting the Most Out of Medicare
Examining Part D plans
Medicare prescription drug plans have similarities to Medicare 
Advantage plans under Part C. Consider the following details about 
Part D plans:
 
✓ They’re offered by private insurers or other companies.
 
✓ The plans are reviewed and approved by Medicare before they 
can be offered to the public.
 
✓ Coverage, premiums, and other features of each plan differ.
 
✓ In areas with many Medicare-eligible people, dozens of plans 
are available. In rural areas, few plans are available.
Unlike Part C plans, however, some national Part D plans are 
available to every Medicare beneficiary in the country. Medicare 
requires the plans to provide a minimum level of coverage, and it 
can ask for other changes and terms in the plans. Providers are 
free to add coverage beyond the minimum.
In the following sections, we outline how Part D works, explain 
how to get the coverage you want at the lowest cost, discuss 
how to deal with Part D’s coverage gap, and show you how to 
compare plans.
Reviewing premiums and other costs
The following list outlines the different costs associated with Part 
D plans. As with other medical expense plans, make sure you esti-
mate your total out-of-pocket costs when comparing prescription 
drug plans. With Part D plans, this means comparing several pos-
sible types or tiers of expenses. Keep these costs in mind:
 
✓ Premiums: Many plans charge a premium, or a monthly fee, 
that varies depending on the plan sponsor and the amount of 
coverage. Generally speaking, the more coverage under the 
plan, the higher the premium. The median monthly premium 
has been around $35 in recent years. As we advise with other 
plans and policies, don’t choose a policy primarily based 
on the monthly premium. Consider all your potential out-of-
pocket costs.

252
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
 
 You have several options for the way you pay your premiums. 
You can use one of the following:
 
• Automatic drafts from a checking or savings account
 
• Automatic charges to a credit or debit card
 
• Monthly billing statements
 
• Deductions from Social Security benefits
 
✓ Deductibles: The deductible is the annual amount you have 
to pay before insurance kicks in. You pay all prescription 
drug costs up to the deductible each year. After you incur the 
deductible, the plan coverage kicks in. The deductible often is 
around $250.
 
✓ Copayments or coinsurance: On prescriptions covered by 
the policy, you may have to pay part of the cost of each pre-
scription. Often this copayment or coinsurance is a relatively 
small amount, such as $5 per prescription. A copayment is 
a flat dollar amount per prescription, and coinsurance is a 
percentage of each prescription. The difference is important, 
especially if you’re prescribed an expensive drug. With a 
copayment, you pay the same amount regardless of the cost of 
the drug. With coinsurance, you pay a percentage of the cost; 
so, the more expensive the drug, the more you pay.
 
 This factor is important because of the doughnut hole or cov-
erage gap we discuss later. If you aren’t responsible for a 
copayment or coinsurance for most prescriptions, it’s unlikely 
you’ll spend enough to reach the coverage gap.
 
✓ Doughnut hole or coverage gap: Part D is set up as a cata-
strophic coverage plan. That means the bulk of its coverage 
kicks in only after your out-of-pocket payments exceed several 
thousand dollars. Policyholders are expected to make a signifi-
cant contribution to the cost of their medicines to that point, 
and then the coverage pays most of the costs. That’s why Part 
D has a provision often known as the coverage gap or doughnut 
hole. After your total prescription costs for the year equals a 
floor amount, you pay all the prescription costs between that 
amount and the top of the coverage gap (unless your income 
is less than a minimal level, which changes each year). A few 

253
 Chapter 11: Getting the Most Out of Medicare
plans offer some coverage in the gap. When yours doesn’t, you 
aren’t allowed to buy separate insurance to pay for the cover-
age gap. The levels of the coverage gap are indexed for infla-
tion each year. In 2010, the floor of the gap was $2,830, and the 
top of the gap was $4,550.
 
 For example, Sandy Senior enrolls in a Part D plan for 2010. 
She pays all of the first $310 of her prescription drug costs for 
the year (the deductible). For ensuing prescriptions she makes 
only a copayment (set by her plan) for each prescription. 
This continues until the total paid by both Sandy and her plan 
(including her $310 deductible) equal $2,830. Now, Sandy has 
to pay for all of her prescriptions until she has spent a total 
of $4,550 for the year. After Sandy’s out-of-pocket expenses 
for the year equal $4,550, the catastrophic coverage kicks in. 
For the rest of her prescription for the year, Sandy pays only 
the plan’s copayment until the end of the year. In 2011, Sandy 
starts over, though the deductible and coverage gap floor and 
ceiling will be adjusted for medicine inflation.
 
 Part D policies, however, are allowed to pay for all or some of 
the drugs in the coverage gap, but less than one-third do. In 
most states, about 15 plans are available to offer some level of 
coverage in the doughnut hole. National plans that offer cover-
age in the gap usually cover only generic drugs. Only about 5 
percent of plans offer both brand name and generic drug cov-
erage in the gap. (These numbers change each year, because 
insurers review and restructure their plans annually.) A plan 
that offers doughnut hole coverage usually has higher pre-
miums than other plans. For ways to handle the doughnut 
hole, check out the “Dealing with the doughnut” section later 
in this chapter.
 
✓ Catastrophic coverage: After your prescription payouts 
exceed the limit of the coverage gap for the year (the amount 
changes with drug costs each year; it is up to $4,550 for 2010), 
you pay only a small coinsurance or copayment amount for 
subsequent prescriptions. You generally will pay only 5 per-
cent of covered costs above the coverage gap.
The costs you pay under a policy are important, but so too are 
other features. We explore these other features in the next section.

254
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
Looking at other terms
Out-of-pocket costs may seem low when you examine only the 
premiums and other costs. However, other policy terms can boost 
your costs or restrict coverage if you don’t examine them closely. 
When determining which plan is right for you, check out these 
other policy terms:
 
✓ The formulary: The formulary is a fancy term for the drugs 
the policy will cover. A plan doesn’t cover all the prescription 
drugs you order just because it’s a prescription drug policy. 
The plan will only pay for covered drugs. When several brand 
name drugs compete, the plan may cover only one of them. 
And, when they’re available, sometimes only generic drugs 
may be covered. New, experimental, or expensive drugs may 
not be covered or may require you to pay heftier coinsurance 
or copayments. The plan may exclude certain drugs or drugs 
in certain categories.
 
 If you currently take medication, be sure it’s covered under 
the plan you’re looking into. If you aren’t taking prescriptions, 
review the formulary to get an idea of how restrictive the plan 
is. You can see whether the drugs used by friends or relatives 
are covered.
 
✓ Step therapy: Some plans have a preferred drug in one or 
more treatment categories. Other competing drugs are cov-
ered only if the preferred drug is ineffective for you or you 
have an adverse reaction to it. A number of plans also may 
require you to first try a generic drug if one is available.
 
✓ Authorization: Your doctor may need to get approval from the 
plan administrator before a prescription is covered.
 
✓ Quantity limits: Some plans limit the quantity of a medicine 
you can order at one time and the frequency with which you 
can order. This policy term can be more than inconvenient. 
If you’re charged a copayment for each order, a limit on the 
quantity of an order means you make more orders and incur 
more copayments.

255
 Chapter 11: Getting the Most Out of Medicare
 
✓ Inpatient care: Often a plan doesn’t cover drugs received in an 
emergency room or in other inpatient situations. These drugs 
are supposed to be covered under other parts of Medicare. Or 
your plan may cover them but only after you pay for them out 
of pocket and seek approval and reimbursement.
 
✓ Pharmacy restrictions: Some plans limit the pharmacies from 
which you can order medications if you want them covered.
 
✓ Mail order only: For medications used regularly, many plans 
require mail order, and usually from a specific pharmacy. 
Although this term may seem like a limitation, most folks enjoy 
the convenience and cost savings.
 
Under some plans, a prescription that isn’t covered won’t be paid 
for at all by the plan. You pay the full cost. The plan may only par-
tially cover other drugs, such as by imposing higher copayments 
on you.
Dealing with the doughnut
A concern of some seniors considering Part D policies is what to 
do about the coverage gap. This gap is the range of your annual 
drug expenses in which Medicare or your plan pays no share of. A 
few plans cover some or all drugs in the gap. When a plan doesn’t 
offer coverage in the gap, the law prohibits you from buying a sep-
arate policy specifically to provide coverage in the gap. You have 
only a few courses of action available:
 
✓ Buy a Part D policy that covers the gap. A minority of Part 
D policies provide full or partial coverage for expenses in the 
doughnut hole. Because Medicare isn’t covering any of these 
expenses, the insurer charges higher premiums to offer this 
coverage. You have to decide whether the higher premiums 
are worth the coverage. For most people, it’s not.
 
✓ Economize in the gap. You can take several actions that may 
reduce medicine expenses. Some options include the following:
 
• You can buy generic drugs whenever they’re available.

256
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
 
• Your doctor can prescribe a 40 milligram pill when you 
need only a 20 milligram dose. The more potent dose 
often is cheaper than the less potent dose. Then, you can 
split the pills in half. Discuss this fully with your doctor, 
however, because some pills can’t be split safely.
 
✓ Self insure for the gap. Congress intended that Part D be 
primarily for catastrophic, or expensive, prescription drug 
coverage. Seniors are supposed to save for the bulk of their 
medicine coverage below the top of the gap. You could do 
what Congress expects and factor this level of medication 
expense into your retirement spending plan.
Comparing plans
Medicare has all the information you need about Part D plans. You 
can research all this information and compare plans in the follow-
ing ways:
 
✓ On Medicare’s Web site: The site has a feature listing all the 
Part D policies available in your area. You can read summary 
descriptions of each policy to narrow your choices. You also 
can search by policy features. Detailed descriptions of any 
policies that interest you are on the site. A policy comparison 
feature allows you to compare several policies on one screen.
 
✓ By calling the helpline: If you aren’t comfortable using com-
puters, keep in mind that Medicare’s telephone operators 
have the same information that’s on the Web site. You may 
call 800-MEDICARE (800-633-4227) to receive the information 
you need.
Enrolling in a Part D plan
You can join a Part D Medicare prescription drug plan when you 
first become eligible for Medicare. If you decide to do so, you can 
sign up for it during the same period you can sign up for the rest of 
Medicare: the three months before the month of your birthday and 
the three months after the month of your birthday. You also can 
sign up for a plan in the annual enrollment period from November 
15 through December 31. Most plans allow you to enroll over the 
phone, through the Web, or mail.

257
 Chapter 11: Getting the Most Out of Medicare
The membership period is the same as for Medicare Advantage 
plans. Your enrollment begins January 1 of the year following the 
enrollment period (except when you’re first eligible for Medicare 
and it begins soon after you enroll), and you’re enrolled in that 
plan for a year. The exceptions to the one-year enrollment period 
are when you move out of the coverage area, live in an institution 
such as a nursing home, or need financial assistance to afford the 
plan. You can change when any of these events happen, and cov-
erage begins shortly after you complete the paperwork. Medicare 
will send you a letter stating when the new coverage begins.
 
The Medicare law encourages you to join a Part D plan when you’re 
first eligible. Its encouragement comes in the form of a penalty that 
increases your premium when you enroll in Part D after the initial 
enrollment period. The penalty is 1 percent of the national base 
premium amount for each month you delayed signing up for Part D. 
The national base premium amount basically is the average pre-
mium nationwide and usually is $30 to $35 per month. In 2010 the 
penalty was $0.32 per month for each of the full months you 
delayed joining. The penalty continues as long as you have a Part D 
policy and can increase or decrease each year as the base premium 
changes.
 
The main way to avoid the penalty is if you delayed in enrolling in 
Part D because you had creditable coverage. Creditable coverage is 
prescription drug coverage offered by a former employer, a union, 
or the Department of Veterans Affairs. Plans that offer prescription 
drug coverage are supposed to send letters to their Medicare-
eligible members telling them the coverage is creditable. If you 
don’t have such a letter, ask your plan sponsor for one. Without a 
letter, assume you don’t have creditable coverage.
This issue is tricky, so don’t make assumptions. For example, if 
you’re employed when eligible for Medicare Part D, the employ-
ment coverage isn’t creditable. Only retiree coverage from a 
former employer is creditable. You have to sign up for a Part D 
policy while employed to avoiding being hit with the penalty after 
you retire and sign up for Part D.
 
Here’s a simple, low cost way to deal with the penalty. Suppose 
you become eligible for Part D and don’t have a big need for pre-
scription drugs. But you want to preserve the option to buy a 

258
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
comprehensive Part D policy in a few years without incurring the 
penalty for waiting. To avoid the penalty, buy the most basic Part 
D policy that carries the lowest premium. You always can switch 
to another Part D policy during a future annual enrollment 
period, and you won’t pay the penalty because you bought a 
basic policy when first eligible.
Eyeing a Medicare Supplement
Parts A and B of Medicare don’t pay all your medical expenses. 
You have to pay for premiums, deductibles, copayments or coin-
surance, and care that simply isn’t covered. Medicare pays about 
half the medical expenses of the typical beneficiary, and a benefi-
ciary on average spends around $7,000 out of pocket on medical 
care. Some seniors pay much more for medical care and some 
much less, depending on how healthy they are.
Depending on your financial situation, you may not want the risk 
that comes with your noncovered medical expenses being close 
to $10,000 per year. If you’re enrolled in Original Medicare, you 
can buy a Medicare supplement policy, or Medigap policy, from a 
private insurer. In this section, we analyze Medicare supplement 
insurance so you can determine whether it’s appropriate for you.
Understanding Medigap policies
Medicare supplement policies, which are often referred to as Medi-
gap policies, are so named because they cover the gaps in Medi-
care’s coverage — the expenses not covered by Medicare. The 
coverage can include monthly premiums, deductibles, copayments, 
and care not covered by Medicare.
 
You need to be aware of the rules associated with these supplement 
policies. They’re subject to some basic federal rules, but the states 
also regulate them, and your state may have additional rules. The 
states also regulate the financial condition of the insurers. Because 
states can vary so much, and we have only limited space, we 

259
 Chapter 11: Getting the Most Out of Medicare
concentrate on the federal rules. Questions about state rules and 
regulations can be answered by the state insurance commissioner. 
You also may get information from your Area Office on Aging.
A Medicare supplement policy must be clearly identified as 
Medicare Supplement Insurance. To purchase it, you generally 
must be enrolled in Parts A and B of Original Medicare (not Part 
C, Medicare Advantage). The policies are sold by private insurers, 
and you pay premiums directly to the insurers. The policies aren’t 
reviewed or approved by Medicare. State insurance regulators are 
the primary regulators of the insurers and the policies.
Standardizing Medigap policies
Medicare law makes comparing Medigap policies somewhat easier 
than you would expect given the wide range of policy options. A 
policy must fall into one of the categories defined by Medicare and 
designated by letters of the alphabet. Note: The categories and 
choices will change effective June 1, 2010. Before that date, there 
were ten categories, identified by the letters A through L. After 
that date, previous plans E, H, I, and J will no longer be available. 
(If you had one of these plans before June 1, 2010, you can keep it 
if the insurer continues to offer it.) New plans M and N are added. 
This section gives you an overview of these plans.
Plan A, the basic plan, covers the fewest items, and coverage items 
are added on each of the higher-letter categories. Plans F through J 
cover many types of services, copayments, and deductibles. Plans 
K and L offer similar benefits to the others but have higher deduct-
ibles enabling insurers to offer lower monthly premiums. Under 
these plans, you pay all your medical costs for the year until you 
have equaled the deductible, which is around $2,000. Insurers also 
are allowed to offer high-deductible versions of Plans F and J that 
carry lower premiums in return for annual deductibles of around 
$2,000. The deductibles may increase over the life of the policy. 
The most frequently purchased policies are probably Plans C and 
F, according to the Medicare Rights Center, because most people 
seem to like their trade-offs between higher but still affordable pre-
miums and broader coverage.

260
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
Basic benefits
The following basic benefits must be offered by all the Medigap 
plans from A through L:
 
✓ Hospital coinsurance coverage
 
✓ An additional 365 days of full hospital coverage
 
✓ Payment of the 20 percentage coinsurance under Part B for 
doctors’ charges and other Part B services. Under Plans K and 
L, this coverage kicks in only after you have met the deduct-
ible for the year
 
✓ First three pints of blood needed for the year (full coverage 
except for plans K and L)
There are modest changes in the basic benefits as of June 1, 2010. 
These include the deletion of at-home recovery care and some pre-
ventive care benefits and the addition of a hospice benefit.
Building on basic benefits
Additional coverage varies by plan. Here we list the different types 
of coverage available under Medigap plans and the plans that offer 
each of these services. Keep in mind that plans F and J are allowed 
to offer higher deductibles than the other A through L plans, so 
they cover something only after you’ve met the higher deductible 
for the year. The same applies to plans K and L, which have even 
higher deductibles.
 
✓ Hospital deductible: Plans B through L
 
✓ Skilled nursing facility coinsurance: Plans C through L
 
✓ Part B deductible: Plans C, F, and J
 
✓ Foreign emergency care: Plans C through J
 
✓ At-home recovery: Plans C, G, I, and J
 
✓ Excess doctor charges under Part B: Plans F, G, I, and J. These 
are amounts that doctors who don’t participate in Medicare 
charge you above the Medicare-approved reimbursement 
amount.

 Chapter 11: Getting the Most Out of Medicare
Introducing the new plans
The lineup of standardized Medigap plans changes June 1, 2010. 
Plans E, H, I, and J will disappear for new customers. Those who 
already have one of those plans and like it can continue them as 
long as their insurers offer them. The main reason for the changes 
is those plans initially were offered with prescription drug ben-
efits. The drug coverage under Part D is considered better, and 
new versions of these plans don’t offer prescription coverage. 
Without the drug coverage, these plans differ little from other 
plans. (If you purchased one of the plans before 2006, you can con-
tinue its prescription drug coverage as long as you want.)
The new plans are M and N. Plan M covers the basic benefits 
included in Plan A plus half of the Part A deductible and some 
emergency medical care during foreign travel. Plan N covers the 
basic benefits, except you will have a $20 copayment for each 
office visit and $50 copayment for each emergency room visit. Plan 
N also will cover the full Part A deductible and emergency medical 
care during foreign travel.
 
The standardization of these policies forces each insurer to offer 
essentially the same benefits for competing policies. The insurers 
compete on price, service, financial stability, and other factors. 
(The standardized policies are different in Massachusetts, 
Minnesota, and Wisconsin.) In some states Medicare SELECT 
policies are available that in return for lower premiums require 
policyholders to use only select hospitals and doctors to receive 
coverage.
Choosing a Medigap policy
Selecting a Medigap policy is a four-step process:
 
1. Decide whether you want a policy to cover Medicare’s gaps 
or whether you want to self insure for any costs that aren’t 
covered.

262
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
 
 Self insuring is lower cost in the short term. You save the 
higher premium and keep your money until you actually incur 
costs. A Medigap policy provides some certainty. You pay the 
premium and know that if you incur covered expenses, the 
insurer will pay for them. Your annual fixed costs are higher 
with a Medigap policy. But if you can afford the higher pre-
miums, you may want the certainty of having additional 
medical expenses covered.
 
2. Narrow the standardized policies to one or two that 
interest you.
 
 Coverage differs under each policy. When you aren’t concerned 
about the cost or probability of incurring an expense, you prob-
ably don’t want to pay premiums to cover it, For example, you 
probably don’t need emergency care covered while traveling 
overseas if you don’t travel overseas much. Buying an indi-
vidual policy whenever you make a trip would be cheaper. Of 
course, when you’re trying to hold down premium costs, you 
would gravitate toward policies with less coverage.
 
3. Compare the premiums offered by different insurers for the 
standardized policies that interest you.
 
 These are easily available on the Medicare Web site or by call-
ing Medicare.
 
4. Consider other factors in order to get the best value.
 
 With Medicare’s standardized policies, insurers compete on 
cost, service, history of premium increases, and financial 
stability. Information on each of these is available from most 
state insurance departments, and the insurer offering a policy 
also should have the information.
These factors may help you decide which plan to go with:
 
✓ Plans F, G, I, and J pay the difference when a doctor doesn’t 
accept Medicare’s rates. A growing percentage of doctors 
won’t participate in Medicare or accept its reimbursement 
rates. However, these policies may cover only care from doc-
tors in their networks. Don’t assume the policies will let you 
see any doctor at Medicare’s rates.

263
 Chapter 11: Getting the Most Out of Medicare
 
✓ You aren’t allowed to have drug coverage under both a 
Medigap policy and a Part D prescription drug program.
 
✓ If you don’t travel much outside the U.S., a policy covering 
foreign travel emergencies won’t be cost efficient. Instead, pur-
chase an individual policy when you travel overseas.
 
After determining which Medigap plan you want, be sure to shop 
among insurers. The premiums differ significantly among insurers 
for the same policies.
Obtaining quotes for 
Medigap insurance
After selecting a plan you want, the next step is to get premium 
quotes from insurers. Medicare has details about each plan avail-
able, including premiums, on its Web site or through its toll-free 
telephone service. The plan comparison feature on the Web site is a 
good way to evaluate both features and premiums at the same time. 
 
Be sure to look beyond the quotes for additional details before 
choosing an insurer. You want to know the history of premium 
increases for your type of policy from each insurer. Some insurers 
initially underprice their policies, either to gain market share or 
because they underestimate costs. An affordable policy today may, 
through steep future price increases, be unaffordable in a few years.
You also want to know the method used to calculate premiums. 
Insurers can use three main methods to calculate premiums:
 
✓ Community rating: This method charges everyone the same 
premium regardless of age. With these policies, younger, 
healthier policyholders essentially are subsidizing older poli-
cyholders. The advantage of these policies is that the pre-
mium may be more stable over time.
 
✓ Issue age: This type of premium is computed based on the 
insured’s age when the policy is issued. After that, premiums 
are increased based only on increases in medical costs and 
the insurer’s claims and investment experience.

264
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
 
✓ Attained age: This type of premium is based on the insured’s 
current age. The premium rises as you get older. Premiums 
using this method are likely to be the lowest when a policy is 
purchased, but they’ll rise the most as you age. This can be an 
advantage when you first buy the policy, but increases can be 
steep as the years pass. A policy that was affordable at 65 may 
be significantly more expensive at 75 or 80.
 
Not all states allow all these methods to compute premiums. Some 
allow only two, and some states require all insurers to use one 
method. You should find out how the insurer determines premiums 
to get an idea of how premiums are likely to change over the years. 
Doing so can help you avoid having the policy become a financial 
burden in the future.
Resolving Some Sticky Issues
Some issues regularly cause confusion or problems for Medicare 
beneficiaries. These issues don’t have to be a problem for you if 
you check out the following sections in which we provide some 
quick pointers to guide you.
Changing plans
Medicare provides a number of choices and flexibility. It also gives 
you the ability to change your plan choices. Making a change, how-
ever, can have unintended consequences if you aren’t careful.
 
You’re allowed to change your Medicare choices during the annual 
enrollment period from November 15 to December 31. However, 
doing so can create problems for you if you switch between 
Original Medicare (Part B) and Medicare Advantage (Part C), espe-
cially if you bought Part D prescription drug coverage or a Medigap 
policy to go with your Original Medicare. Consider these changes 
and the issues they raise:
 
✓ Start with Part C and purchase a Part D plan: Prescription 
drugs usually are covered as part of an Advantage plan under 
Part C. If you’re enrolled in a Part C plan and purchase 

265
 Chapter 11: Getting the Most Out of Medicare
prescription drug coverage under Part D, Medicare auto-
matically drops you from the Part C plan and enrolls you in 
Original Medicare. You lose the additional coverage you may 
have in Part C and also may lose access to doctors who work 
only under the Part C plan. Your premiums, copayments, and 
other features also all change.
 
✓ Start with Parts B and D and switch to Part C: Suppose you’re 
in Original Medicare with Part D prescription drug coverage. 
The next year you switch to an Advantage plan with prescrip-
tion drug coverage. You let the Part D policy lapse, because it 
duplicates your Advantage coverage. In a subsequent enroll-
ment period you decide to switch back to Original Medicare. 
You can purchase a Part D prescription drug policy at that 
point, but you’ll pay the premium penalty on your future Part 
D premiums. The amount of the penalty will depend on how 
long you went without a Part D policy.
 
 Switching between Original Medicare and Medicare Advantage 
also can affect your Medigap policies. In most cases, if you 
drop a Medigap policy after joining an Advantage plan, you 
may not be able to get the Medigap policy back. You may get 
the old Medigap policy back or be able to buy a new one if this 
is the first time you joined an Advantage plan and you choose 
to leave the plan within the first 12 months of joining. But the 
new Medigap policy can’t include prescription drug coverage. 
Under other circumstances, you aren’t guaranteed a right to 
buy a Medigap policy. If the insurers decide you’re medically 
unqualified for a policy, you won’t be able to buy one. Your 
state may offer additional protections, but check it out before 
you make any changes.
Monitoring changes at work
Changing your employment or your employer medical coverage 
can cause some confusing situations. Suppose you’re still work-
ing when you turn 65, and you plan to continue working. If your 
employer has a medical plan covering you, you need to ask the 
employer whether turning 65 changes the plan coverage. Under 
many employer plans, when an employee turns 65 Medicare 
becomes the primary plan and the employer plan only backs it up. 
In that case, you have to sign up for Part B (Original Medicare).

266
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
 
However, some employer plans in this situation remain the primary 
health plan. If that describes your plan, you don’t have to sign up 
for Medicare Part B as long as the employer plan is primary. You 
won’t incur a penalty for waiting to sign up for Part B until after the 
employer coverage ends.
When you work past age 65, the situation for Part D is different. 
You incur the penalty for waiting to sign up for Part D unless your 
employer or union had a prescription drug plan Medicare consid-
ers creditable coverage. (Creditable coverage is drug coverage 
that Medicare considers similar to its own.) You need a letter from 
your employer stating that the coverage is creditable. Otherwise, 
when you try to join Part D later you’ll pay a penalty. Don’t make 
assumptions or rely on verbal assurances. If you didn’t have cred-
itable coverage and you buy a Part D policy after your initial eligi-
bility period, you’ll pay the premium penalty.
Making a foreign move
If you move overseas any time after age 65, you face difficult deci-
sions. Medicare Parts A and B don’t cover most care received 
overseas, whether you’re traveling or a resident overseas; though 
some care received in Canada and Mexico may be covered. A 
Medigap policy may cover care received when traveling outside 
the U.S., but you aren’t eligible to take out a Part D policy when 
you’re a resident overseas.
You could withdraw from Part B while overseas. But if you move 
back to the U.S. and re-enroll in Part B, you would owe a re-
enrollment penalty that could reach 10 percent for each 12-month 
period you could have been enrolled but weren’t. You may find it 
cheaper to continue paying Part B premiums while overseas even 
though Part B won’t cover you for any care received there.
 
Part D is more generous to overseas residents. After you return to 
the U.S., you can purchase a Part D policy during a special enroll-
ment period and won’t owe any penalty. The enrollment period 
begins when you return to the U.S. and continues for two months.

267
 Chapter 11: Getting the Most Out of Medicare
Answering your Medicare questions
Medicare is administered and enforced 
by the federal Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid. You can ask ques-
tions and order publications by calling 
800-MEDICARE (800-633-4227). You also 
can find a wealth of information at the 
Web site www.medicare.gov. Two 
of the best sources of information are 
the publications Medicare and You and 
Guide to Health Insurance for People 
with Medicare. These, and other publi-
cations, may be downloaded free from 
the site or ordered free by calling the 
toll-free number.
States also offer help and information 
about Medicare. Each state has an 
Office on Aging (or its equivalent), which 
offers free counseling, seminars, and lit-
erature. Most state agencies regulating 
health insurers publish a booklet listing 
the premiums charged on policies by dif-
ferent insurers in the state and offer this 
information on their Web sites. A state’s 
corporation commission or insurance 
department usually is the appropriate 
agency to contact. The agencies also 
should have information on the financial 
condition of insurers selling policies in 
the state.

Backup: Medicaid
In This Chapter

▶ Qualifying for both Medicaid and Medicare
▶ Understanding why you may not want to qualify for Medicaid
I
f you ever get to a point in your life where you may need a 
number of years’ worth of nursing home care, you may wonder 
exactly how you’ll pay for the costly expense. Some people are 
wealthy enough to pay out of pocket, while others may be able 
to rely on purchased long-term care insurance (see Chapter 9). 
However some folks don’t have those resources available. 
You may be able to rely on Medicaid (www.cms.hhs.gov) to help 
pay these expenses. Medicaid is the only government program that 
pays for a significant 
amount of nursing home care. Yet Medicaid has some major 
restrictions; eligibility is limited, and many people don’t meet the 
requirements. 
In this chapter, we discuss the qualifications for Medicaid coverage of 
long-term care. We also explore strategies you can use to become 
eligible for Medicaid. Because specific rules vary from state to 
state, we focus on the federal rules. 

270
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
Discovering What Medicaid Is
Medicaid is one of the largest government programs, weighing 
in with about $350 billion in annual spending (and over the next 
decade, it’s expected to consume $5 trillion). Medicaid covers 
most types of medical care needed by its beneficiaries. We don’t 
cover the full Medicaid program in this book. Instead, we focus on 
what’s relevant for you, which is its coverage for long-term care 
for seniors.
 
Medicaid is the only significant source of government financing for 
two areas that seniors rely on:
 
✓ Nursing home care: Medicaid pays about 45 percent of total 
nursing home expenses in the United States, depending on 
eligibility (see the next section to figure out eligibility).
 
✓ Long-term home care: Medicaid covers only some long-term 
home care, and it doesn’t cover assisted living care, the most 
popular and fastest-growing type of long-term care. (Assisted 
living care is for someone who needs help with only one or 
two activities of daily living but doesn’t need the skilled care 
of a nursing home.)
 Medicaid is perhaps the most confusing and least understood 
program for financing the medical expenses of seniors. The major 
reason for the confusion is its unique structure as a joint federal-state 
program. The federal government sets the basic rules and provides 
a portion of the funding. Each state designs and administers its own 
version of the program within the broad guidelines of the federal 
rules. In addition, a state can apply for a waiver of certain rules or 
establish a pilot or test program with the approval of the federal 
government. A state isn’t required to participate in Medicaid, but 
all 50 states have elected to participate. The amount of funding 
provided by the federal government is based on a formula that 
uses the relative per capita incomes of the states. The federal 
share ranges from a minimum of 50 percent of a state’s Medicaid 
expenses up to 78 percent.

271
 Chapter 12: The State Health Care System Backup: Medicaid
Considering Medicaid Eligibility
Many Americans have a misconception about who’s eligible for 
Medicaid. After all, the program has strict eligibility rules, and 
many people who counted on Medicaid to pay their nursing home 
or long-term home care expenses find it’s not available to them. In 
order to understand how you may be able to use Medicaid during 
your senior years, you first need to know whether you’re eligible 
for this program. (Check out the “Examining Planning Strategies” 
section later in this chapter for ways you can restructure your 
finances to qualify for Medicaid.)
 
To be eligible for Medicaid, you first must meet these general 
requirements:
 
✓ Be age 65 or older or permanently disabled or blind
 
✓ Meet U.S. citizenship or immigration rules
 
✓ Be a resident of the state in which you apply
In addition, to receive Medicaid nursing home or long-term home 
care coverage you must meet two Medicaid eligibility tests:
 
✓ Functional test: Under the functional test, a medical exam 
conducted by a Medicaid-authorized professional must show 
you need this type of care. (Refer to the next section for more 
information.)
 
✓ Financial tests: Under the financial tests, your income and 
assets must be less than the Medicaid limits. This generally 
means you must be impoverished by Medicaid standards. 
(Check out the “Meeting Financial Requirements” section later 
in this chapter.)

272
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
Establishing Functional Eligibility
The first eligibility test you have to meet for Medicaid is a functional 
limitations test performed by a medical specialist. Each state 
decides who performs the functional eligibility test. If the person 
is in a hospital at the time, a hospital screening committee usually 
decides whether you meet this requirement. Otherwise, a nurse 
from the local department of social services agency or similar 
agency usually gives the tests. The tests vary among the states but 
generally cover two categories of activities:
 
✓ Activities of daily living (ADL): These are bathing, dressing, 
eating, getting around inside the home, toileting, and 
transferring from a bed to a chair.
 
✓ Instrumental activities of daily living (IADL): These are tasks 
necessary for independent community living, such as shop-
ping, light housework, money management, meal 
preparation, and using the telephone.
 
The evaluation may conclude that you receive home- or 
community-based services instead of nursing home or other 
long-term care. The tests and standards vary from state to state 
and cover nonfinancial matters, so we don’t discuss the functional 
eligibility standards further.
Meeting Financial Requirements
Medicaid is a means-tested program. In other words, to qualify, 
your income and assets must be below certain amounts. In general 
a person must be eligible for welfare to be eligible for Medicaid, 
but the states are allowed to set higher limits for seniors (those 
over age 65). States also have some flexibility in their definitions of 
income and assets. Because each state sets its own Medicaid rules, 
you may find yourself eligible for Medicaid in one state but ineligible 
for coverage in another state. To help you better understand 
this program, the following sections highlight the broad federal 
requirements and how the states can vary the standards. We first 
review the income limits, which are fairly simple. Then we dive 
into the more complicated limits on asset ownership.

273
 Chapter 12: The State Health Care System Backup: Medicaid
Understanding income limits
Each state sets its income limit for covering nursing home and 
long-term home care within guidelines set by the federal government. 
When a state has an income limit for any type of care, it bases it on 
one of two standards:
 
✓ The Supplemental Security Income (SSI), generically known as 
welfare. A state can set an income limit for seniors as high as 
300 percent of the SSI benefit.
 
✓ The federal poverty level.
A state also may have a waiver or trial program that allows it to set 
a different income limit.
 
The income limit isn’t always what you would expect. For nursing 
home and long-term home care, about half the states don’t have a 
formal income limit and some others won’t declare a person with 
an income above its limit to be ineligible for Medicaid. Instead, 
in these states people are required to spend all or most of their 
income on their care. The state then pays any additional cost. 
Other states do have an income limit and deny Medicaid coverage 
to a person whose income exceeds the limit. In these states in 2009, 
the income limit generally was $2,022 per month.
In the next few sections, we discuss items that are counted as 
income. We also discuss some allowances, which are amounts of 
income that don’t count against the income limit.
Defining income
Although income is broadly defined when determining Medicaid 
eligibility, income is basically anything that can be used to purchase 
food and shelter. Income includes regular payments such as Social 
Security, veterans’ benefits, pensions, salaries, wages, interest 
from savings or checking accounts, or income from investments. 
Income also includes payments to which you’re entitled but don’t 
receive or decline to receive, such as money a relative or employer 
owes but you ask them not to pay it while you’re applying for 
Medicaid.

274
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
 
When the applicant needs nursing home care, only the applicant’s 
income is counted. The spouse’s separate income isn’t included in 
the applicant’s income, regardless of the amount of the spouse’s 
income. The spouse can earn a salary or receive Social Security or 
a pension, and the income still wouldn’t be included in the appli-
cant’s income. When long-term home care is needed, however, the 
rules may be different. Some states count all of the spouse’s 
income in the applicant’s income, and some count a portion or 
none of the spouse’s income.
Income from trusts or property owned jointly with others has 
special rules. Income earned by a trust of which you’re a beneficiary 
is counted as yours, even if you don’t receive it. Suppose you’re 
the beneficiary of a trust, and the trustee has discretion over the 
amount of money to distribute to you. If the trust earns $1,000 
monthly, you’re counted as having $1,000 of monthly income 
regardless of how much the trustee actually distributes to you. 
The rule for jointly-owned property is similar. Suppose you own a 
rental property jointly with someone. Half of the property’s rental 
income counts as yours even if it isn’t distributed to you.
Retaining income
When your income exceeds the state’s limit, for Medicaid eligibility, 
four separate allowances permit you to keep additional income:
 
✓ Maintenance monthly needs allowance: If the spouse who 
doesn’t need nursing home or long-term home care has a low 
income or no income, the applicant may be allowed to keep 
some income to support the spouse. This amount is known 
as the maintenance monthly needs allowance. The amount 
is adjusted for inflation each year. For 2010 the maximum 
monthly allowance for the spouse was $2,739, and the minimum 
was $1,750. (Each state chooses an allowance within that range.)
 
✓ Monthly personal needs allowance: A monthly personal needs 
allowance is a modest amount that can be spent on goods 
or services not provided by the nursing home, including taxi 
fares, movie tickets, and personal care items or services. The 
federal government sets the allowance at $60 per month but 
allows each state to change the amount. As a result the 
personal needs allowance among the states in general ranges 
from $40 to $100 per month.

275
 Chapter 12: The State Health Care System Backup: Medicaid
 
✓ Medical cost allowance: Applicants also may be allowed to 
keep income that’s needed to pay for medical costs that aren’t 
covered by other sources, including insurance premiums.
 
✓ Certain types of trusts: You may be able to set up a trust that 
goes by several names; qualifying income trust, supplemental 
needs trust, or Miller trust. This trust allows you to be eligible 
for Medicaid while receiving income. The income is paid to 
the trust and can be used for your expenses. Suppose you 
receive regular payments such as Social Security or an annuity. 
This income is deposited into the trust. That income isn’t 
counted as yours for determining Medicaid eligibility, meaning 
the trust could help you be eligible for Medicaid. (See the 
“Supplemental needs trusts” section later in this chapter for 
more info.)
 
 There are two important limits on this type of trust:
 
• Trust income and principal generally must be spent only 
on your care.
 
• The state must be named as a remainder beneficiary of 
the trust. This means the state will receive the trust’s 
remaining assets after you pass away, reimbursing the 
state for its Medicaid expenditures for your care. Your 
chosen beneficiaries receive only trust assets that exceed 
what the state spent on your care.
Understanding asset limits
The asset, or resources, limit is more strict than the income limit 
(which we discuss in the preceding section). The asset limit test 
often is called the impoverishment test. The general rule is that you 
can’t own assets worth more than $2,000 (or $3,000 for a married 
couple).
Medicaid exempts certain assets; they don’t count against the 
asset limit and are known as exempt assets or non-countable assets. 
The exemptions mean a person may own valuable assets and still 
be eligible for Medicaid. Any nonexempt assets that exceed the 
$2,000 limit must be spent before you qualify for Medicaid.

276
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
The states have some flexibility when defining exempt assets, 
setting dollar limits, and in other administrative details. Because 
the limits vary among states, here we focus on the federal rules 
and general framework of the asset test. You need to check the 
details of your state’s rules to determine whether you’re eligible 
for Medicaid.
 
All assets owned by the applicant initially are included when 
performing the impoverishment test. In addition, unlike under the 
income test, the assets of a spouse are included for nursing home 
care. The amount of exempt assets may be increased because the 
applicant has a spouse. We discuss the treatment of a spouse’s 
assets in more detail in a later section “Seeing how marriage can 
change your assets.” Jointly-owned assets and assets held in trust 
also are counted as the applicant’s.
Loans you made to others may be counted as your assets. The 
general rule is that most loans, mortgages, and other debts 
people owe to you are considered either part of your assets or a 
transfer by you of an asset for less than fair market value (what an 
independent buyer would pay), with the value being the amount 
of the outstanding balance. (We discuss the consequences of gifts 
and transfers in the section “Using gifts and trusts to change 
eligibility.”) 
A debt owed to you is an exempt asset only if payments are 
required in equal amounts during the term of the loan with no 
deferred payments or balloon payments. A balloon payment is a 
payment of a loan’s entire balance a few years after payments were 
begun. Plus, the duration of the loan must be actuarially sound 
in light of your life expectancy. A loan extending beyond your life 
expectancy is not actuarially sound. In addition, the debt can’t be 
cancelled on the death of the lender if it is to be exempt.
After totaling all the assets counted as owned by the applicant, the 
exempt assets are subtracted. The exempt assets under the federal 
framework are:

277
 Chapter 12: The State Health Care System Backup: Medicaid
 
✓ An individual’s home, of any value, as long as it’s the applicant’s 
principal residence and is in the same state in which the 
applicant is applying for Medicaid. The state may require a 
reasonable likelihood that the applicant will be able to return 
to the home. Further, only equity up to $500,000 can be 
excluded, though the state has the option to increase that to 
$750,000.
 
✓ One automobile of any value if it’s used for transportation of 
the applicant or a household member. An additional automobile 
may be excluded if it’s equipped for use by a handicapped 
person, if it’s needed to go to work or to perform essential 
daily activities due to distance, climate, or terrain, or if it’s 
used to obtain regular medical treatment.
 
✓ Up to $2,000 of household goods and personal effects. This 
basically covers your furniture, clothing, and other personal 
items in the home.
 
✓ Life insurance policies with a total face value of $1,500 or less 
per person.
 
✓ Burial funds not in excess of $1,500 each for an individual and 
spouse (plus accrued interest).
 
✓ Property essential to self-support, including property used in 
a trade or business or on the job if the individual works for 
someone else.
 
✓ Resources set aside to fulfill a plan to achieve self-support.
 
✓ Annuities, but only in some cases. (Refer to the nearby sidebar 
for more about how federal legislation changed whether 
annuities are exempt assets.)
 
In general, after excluding a residence and furnishings, personal 
belongings, and a motor vehicle, in most states a person can have 
only $2,000 of assets and a married couple can have only $3,000 of 
assets to qualify for Medicaid.

278
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
Seeing how marriage can change your assets
If you’re married and applying for Medicaid, take note that the 
pool for exempt assets is both expanded and limited. The general 
rule for a married couple is that all assets owned by either spouse 
or owned jointly by the couple are included in the assets of the 
spouse applying for Medicaid. That means under this general 
Annuities no longer a clear-cut exempt asset
Although annuities used to be an exempt 
asset, they’re now more likely countable 
assets after the Deficit Reduction Act 
of 2005. In the past, people commonly 
sold most of their assets and used the 
proceeds to purchase an annuity. The 
annuity’s value and its income were 
exempt from the income and asset tests 
regardless of their amounts. Annuities 
under qualified employer retirement 
plans continue to be exempt, but other 
annuities must pass several hurdles to 
avoid being countable assets.
To avoid being counted as an asset, 
an annuity must be purchased after 
February 8, 2006, by you or by someone 
on your behalf and must be an 
immediate annuity. (An immediate 
annuity is a contract under which the 
buyer transfers money or property to an 
insurance company, and the insurance 
company begins a series of regular 
payments, usually monthly, to the 
contract holder. The payments last either 
for life or for a period of years.)
The annuity is an exempt asset if it meets 
the following five (admittedly restrictive) 
requirements:
 ✓ It’s irrevocable, which means the 
contract holder can’t cancel it and 
have any of the money returned. 
It also means after payments are 
begun, they can’t be suspended.
 ✓ The contract holder can’t with-
draw money exceeding the regular 
payments.
 ✓ The contract or income payments 
can’t be transferred to another 
beneficiary.
 ✓ Its actuarially sound, meaning the 
payment terms aren’t longer than the 
contract holder’s life expectancy and 
the total estimated payments to be 
received are equal to the cost of the 
annuity.
 ✓ The state is the remainder beneficiary 
(the one who receives the trust 
balance after the original or income 
beneficiary passes away) of the 
annuity, up to the amount the state 
spends on Medicaid benefits for the 
annuity owner.

279
 Chapter 12: The State Health Care System Backup: Medicaid
rule the spouse not needing long-term care may have to spend 
down assets to $3,000 or less for the other spouse to qualify for 
Medicaid.
 
To avoid impoverishing the spouse who will remain at home, some 
additional assets are exempt or protected and may be kept by that 
spouse. Under this rule, either spouse may request that the state 
assess the couple’s combined countable assets, and nursing homes 
must advise families that the assessment is available. In this 
examination, the following items are exempt:
 
✓ The couple’s home of any value: The home is only exempt if 
the non-applicant spouse lives there.
 
✓ Household goods: These include furniture and other 
furnishings, kitchen items, and similar property.
 
✓ Personal effects: These include clothing, accessories, 
personal care items, and the like.
 
✓ Community spouse resources allowance: This is the amount 
states are allowed to exempt. Federal law provides a minimum 
and maximum amount the state can set for the allowance, and 
the amounts are adjusted for inflation each year. The maximum 
amount was $109,560 in 2010, and the minimum was $21,912. 
When the couple’s total nonexempt assets are less than the 
allowance, the state has an option for dealing with the situation.
Here’s an example to help you better understand what we’re 
saying: Suppose a husband is entering a nursing home and is 
applying for Medicaid. The wife is allowed to keep the home, 
household goods, and personal effects. In addition, she can keep 
half the other assets, up to a maximum amount. The state uses the 
maximum federal allowance of $109,560. If half the excess assets 
is less than $109,560, the husband can transfer assets to the wife 
until her total equals $109,560 or all the husband’s assets are 
exhausted. If half the value of the excess assets exceeds $109,560, 
the wife can keep only $109,560 of excess assets. The remaining 
balance must be spent on the husband’s care.
Suppose half the assets is less than $109,560. In that case, some 
states allow the spouse to keep all the couple’s assets. Other states 
allow the spouse to keep only half the assets. In those states, federal 

280
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
law imposes a minimum amount the spouse is allowed to keep, 
which was $21,912 in 2010. The spouse would keep either half the 
assets or all the assets up to $21,912, whichever amount is higher.
For couples who aren’t legally married (such as common law 
spouses or same-sex couples), the two individuals must equally 
split the value of the assets. The same applies for assets owned 
jointly with any non-spouse. For example, suppose you own a 
rental property jointly with someone other than your spouse. Half 
the property’s value will be counted as yours.
Dealing with excess assets
When your asset ownership exceeds the limit, your Medicaid 
application is denied. The state tells you the amount by which 
your assets exceed the limit. You can appeal the decision if you 
believe it was incorrect. Or you can try to reduce assets by doing 
the following:
 
✓ Converting some excess assets to exempt assets
 
✓ Paying existing bills/debts such as insurance and taxes
 
✓ Spending the extra money on your medical needs and the 
day-to-day maintenance needs of yourself and your spouse
 
This is an asset test, not a net worth test. A person who holds title to 
valuable assets can be technically bankrupt if they owe a significant 
amount of debt and still be ineligible for Medicaid. The person may 
become eligible for Medicaid by using the assets to pay debts.
Using gifts and trusts to change eligibility
For years, the standard strategy to qualify for Medicaid was to give 
assets to family members or trusts for the benefit of family members 
(for example, parents giving assets to their adult children). After 
the transfers, the applicant owned no more assets than were 
allowed by Medicaid. The assets were still in the family and 
preserved for the spouse and heirs instead of being spent on 
nursing home care.

281
 Chapter 12: The State Health Care System Backup: Medicaid
Congress decided this was an abusive strategy, because it enabled 
relatively well-off families to keep their wealth while taxpayers 
(Medicaid) paid the long-term care of their loved ones. Now, 
the general rule, called the look-back rule, states that all assets 
that you give away in the 60-month period before you apply for 
Medicaid are considered part of your assets.
Of course, the look-back rule is anything but easy, so we explain 
what this law means to you in the following two sections.
Getting to the bottom of the look-back rule
Before this 2005 law, the look-back period was 36 months (3 years) 
for outright gifts and 60 months (5 years) for gifts in trusts. Now, 
all gifts face the 60-month look-back period. Because of the look-
back test, a person must be impoverished at least five years before 
entering the nursing home to have Medicaid cover the charges 
from the first day.
The five-year look-back rule applies to any transfer of property 
for less than its value. It applies whether the transfer is directly to 
an individual or through a trust. It applies to transfers of income, 
real property, and personal property to which you or your spouse 
were legally entitled, whether or not you actually received the 
asset. There are exceptions for transfers made to a spouse or to a 
disabled or blind child (see the later section “Identifying exempt 
transfers”).
 
The look-back period and penalty apply even to gifts that weren’t 
made to make you eligible for Medicaid and were made before you 
even anticipated needing nursing home care. Suppose you give 
money or property to your children or grandchildren each year as 
part of an estate planning strategy or merely for generosity’s sake. 
Then, you have a stroke or heart attack and need to enter a nursing 
home. If you apply for Medicaid, the gifts you made in the previous 
five years will be counted among your assets and may possibly 
subject you to the waiting period penalty even though you made 
them without any intention of becoming eligible for Medicaid. (We 
explain the waiting period penalty in further detail in the upcoming 
section.)

282
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
Being aware of the waiting period
Any assets that are transferred during the look-back period result 
in a waiting period, which is a penalty for transferring assets. 
Here’s how the waiting period is determined: The average monthly 
cost of a nursing home in your area is divided into the amount of 
gifts and transfers you made in the five years before applying for 
Medicaid. The result is the number of months you must wait to 
receive Medicaid coverage after you become eligible for Medicaid.
Suppose, for example, an elderly man is entering a nursing home 
and had transferred $300,000 to his adult son within the look-back 
period. Suppose the average monthly cost of a nursing home in 
the area is $10,000. The $300,000 is divided by $10,000 to arrive 
at 30. After the man enters the nursing home and meets Medicaid 
eligibility requirements, he will have to wait another 30 months 
before he can enroll in Medicaid.
 
In some states each month of expenses paid by the applicant 
or a family member reduces the waiting period by one month. 
Suppose the waiting period initially is calculated at 30 months. If 
the son in the preceding example begins paying for the nursing 
home, each month he pays reduces the penalty by one month. 
Also, the father has spent a month in the nursing home, which also 
reduces the penalty by a month. As a result, after the son has paid 
for 15 months, the waiting period ends and the man is eligible for 
Medicaid. 
 
A key question is this: When does the waiting period begin? The 
waiting period doesn’t begin until all of the following have occurred:
 
✓ The person who made the gifts has moved to a nursing home.
 
✓ He has applied for Medicaid coverage.
 
✓ He’s approved for coverage except for the transfer and waiting 
period.
Suppose you transferred $100,000 on April 1, 2009, moved to a 
nursing home on April 1, 2010, and spent enough assets to be 
eligible for Medicaid on April 1, 2011. The waiting period will begin 
on April 1, 2011. If the waiting period is 20 months, you won’t be 
eligible for Medicaid coverage until December 1, 2013.

283
 Chapter 12: The State Health Care System Backup: Medicaid
Identifying exempt transfers
You can make some transfers of assets that are exempt from the 
waiting period penalty that we explain in the preceding section. 
You can even make these transfers after entering a nursing home 
without jeopardizing eligibility for Medicaid. They are transfers to:
 
✓ Your spouse
 
✓ Your child who’s blind or permanently disabled
 
✓ A trust for the sole benefit of anyone under age 65 who’s 
permanently disabled
Your home also may be part of an exempt transfer if it’s transferred 
to one of the following:
 
✓ Your child under age 21
 
✓ Your child who lived in your home for at least two years 
before you moved to a nursing home and who provided you 
with care that allowed you to stay at home during that time
 
✓ A sibling who already had an equity interest in the home for at 
least a year before you moved to a nursing home.
Applying for an appeal
When the maze of Medicaid rules determines that you made an 
improper transfer of assets and the penalty is imposed, you may 
believe the rules unfairly penalize you. For those situations, you 
have a couple of options:
 
✓ You can apply for a hardship exception and waiver of the 
rules. With the hardship exception, you must demonstrate that 
enforcing the penalty would deprive you either of medical care 
necessary to maintain your health or life, or of food, clothing, 
shelter, or other necessities of life.
 
 Each state administers its own program and sets its own 
standards for granting the hardship exceptions. Federal law 
requires that when a hardship exception is asserted, the state 
agency must approve or deny the application within a reasonable 
time and must let you know that you can appeal the decision 
along with the specifics of the appeal process. A nursing home 

284
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
also can pursue a hardship appeal on an applicant’s behalf, 
with the permission of the applicant.
 
✓ You can show that you intended to dispose of the asset at 
fair market value. Another ground for appeal when you’re 
treated as making a transfer of an asset is to show that you 
intended to dispose of the asset at fair market value, and the 
asset either was transferred for a purpose other than to 
qualify for Medicaid or was returned to you.
Preparing for estate recovery
Even after you meet eligibility and the state begins paying for your 
care, your assets still may not be safe. The government may make 
Medicaid payments and allow you to keep exempt assets, but 
those may be only as loans. Federal Medicaid law requires a state 
to attempt to recover from a person’s estate the amounts spent by 
Medicaid for that person’s long-term care.
 
Under the estate recovery rules, an asset that was exempt from 
Medicaid’s asset limits during your lifetime isn’t exempt from 
recovery of Medicaid expenditures after your death. This basically 
means that the state can seek reimbursement or recovery of its 
expenditures from any and all assets in your estate. If the recovery 
involves your house, the recovery is delayed until your spouse has 
passed away and until any blind or disabled child of the beneficiary 
is at least age 21, if he or she is living in the house.
When you die, your assets are transferred to the next owner 
through the state’s probate court process. This is known as the 
probate estate, and it also includes the estate owner’s liabilities. 
(Check out Part IV for more information on estate planning and the 
different types of estates.)
Federal law requires the states to try to recover their Medicaid 
expenditures from a beneficiary’s probate estate. The states are 
permitted, however, to seek reimbursement from the non-probate 
assets (assets that avoid the probate process, such as annuities, 
life insurance, and trusts). States vary in their level of aggressiveness 
in seeking recovery from the estates of deceased Medicaid 
beneficiaries. Check your state law to determine which of your 
assets have the potential of being recovered by the state.

285
 Chapter 12: The State Health Care System Backup: Medicaid
You’re allowed to keep your home as an exempt asset while 
receiving Medicaid in most cases. However, the state also is 
required by federal law to place a lien on a home owned by a living 
Medicaid beneficiary unless certain dependent relatives are living 
in the property: a spouse, a disabled or blind child, a child under 
age 21, or a sibling with an equity interest in the property. The lien 
is supposed to be removed after the beneficiary’s death, but the 
rule is applied differently in each state.
 
If you sell your home while you, the owner, is receiving Medicaid 
payments, you may become ineligible for Medicaid if you receive 
all or part of the proceeds from the sale and the proceeds aren’t 
exempt assets (refer to the “Understanding asset limits” section 
earlier in this chapter). You can retain Medicaid eligibility by using 
the cash to reimburse Medicaid for the care already paid, and the 
lien against the home would be satisfied. If your spouse is living 
in the home, he or she can sell the house a year or more after you 
begin receiving Medicaid benefits and wouldn’t be required to use 
the proceeds to reimburse Medicaid.
Keeping more of your assets (in some states)
In some cases, a state can apply less 
strict eligibility rules and not have to seek 
recovery from the estate of a deceased 
beneficiary. These states participate in a 
program known as the Long-Term Care 
Partnership Program. The purpose of 
the program is to encourage people to 
purchase private long-term care 
insurance that meets requirements 
established by the state.
The individual receives several benefits 
after purchasing a qualified long-term 
care policy and keeping it in force. 
The program increases the amount of 
exempt assets an individual can own 
and still be eligible for Medicaid. Also the 
beneficiary’s estate may be exempt from 
the estate recovery process.
Suppose you live in a state that partici-
pates in the Long-Term Care Partnership 
Program and you purchase a long-
term care insurance policy providing 
maximum lifetime benefits of $100,000. 
You enter a nursing home and after a 
couple of years use up the insurance 
benefits and apply for Medicaid. The 
state will allow you to keep up to $100,000 
of assets in addition to other assets 
allowed under Medicaid (see the section 
“Understanding asset limits” earlier in 
this chapter for more information). In 
addition, all or part of your estate may be 
exempt from the recovery process.

286
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
 
Even if the state recovers its costs from the sale of a house or from 
other assets, using Medicaid to pay for nursing home care may not 
be a bad deal financially. The state reimburses nursing homes at a 
rate far less than private patients pay. That means the eventual 
reimbursement to Medicaid would be lower than paying the nursing 
home out of pocket at its private pay rates. The estate may pay 
Medicaid $90 per day of care instead of the $200 or more pay day 
you would have paid as a private patient without Medicaid coverage.
Examining Planning Strategies
The look-back rule, waiting period penalty, and definitions of 
countable assets are all designed to limit Medicaid’s payments for 
nursing home care. Yet, you can still restructure your finances in a 
few ways to ensure eligibility for Medicaid while protecting some 
assets for your spouse or heirs. In this section, we review some of 
those strategies.
 
The specifics of the rules vary from state to state. Consult with 
an elder care attorney, tax advisor, or other expert in your state’s 
Medicaid’s rules before implementing a strategy.
Spending down
When determining Medicaid eligibility, some of your assets are 
excluded or exempt. So one strategy for becoming eligible for 
Medicaid is to convert nonexempt assets into exempt assets. In 
effect, you spend money and nonexempt assets to acquire exempt 
assets, which is referred to as spending down. Some examples of 
spending down are:
 
✓ Paying down or paying off a mortgage
 
✓ Buying a more expensive home without exceeding your state’s 
exempt amount of equity

287
 Chapter 12: The State Health Care System Backup: Medicaid
 
✓ Making repairs or improvements to your home, again keeping 
your state’s exempt amount for home equity in mind
 
✓ Replacing an old automobile with a new one (in most states a 
first auto of any amount is exempt)
 
✓ Paying for home care before needing nursing home care
 
✓ Prepaying funeral expenses within your state’s limit
 
✓ Updating home furnishings if you’re married
 
Within a married couple, the spouse not entering a nursing home 
receives a community spouse resource allowance that’s exempt 
from the Medicaid spending requirement. Before the spouse 
needing care enters a nursing home, only the assets above the 
community spouse resource allowance should be spent down. 
(Check out the earlier section “Seeing how marriage can change 
your assets” for more on this allowance.)
Creating a life estate
Another strategy you can take to restructure your assets to ensure 
Medicaid eligibility is to create a life estate. A life estate is the right 
to use a property for the rest of your life. After that, the property 
automatically is owned by whoever was designated the next in 
line, known as the remainder owner. When you have a life estate in 
a home, you can act as the owner of the home for the rest of your 
life, except you can’t sell it without the permission of the other 
owners. In addition, your equity in the home is only the value of 
the life estate. Most of the value is in the remainder interest. The 
older you are, the less valuable the life estate is.
 
You create a life estate by filing a deed to the property that 
reserves a life estate to you and creates a remainder interest for 
whatever person or persons you designate. The other owners 
are known as remaindermen. After your death, the remaindermen 
immediately take full ownership. This strategy works best with a 
residence but can be viable with almost any asset.

288
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
So if the state launches a recovery action against your estate for 
reimbursement of its Medicaid expenses on your behalf, the house 
will not be in the estate. The state could argue that your creation 
of the life estate was invalid as a fraudulent transfer or for some 
other reason. In fact, some states that aggressively seek estate 
recovery may change their laws or seek court decisions invalidat-
ing the life estate. However, in most states the life estate protects 
property.
 
Keep in mind that the full value of the house will be included in 
your taxable estate if you owned a life estate in it. For tax purposes 
the life estate would be a gift to the remaindermen, so you may 
owe gift taxes or use up part of your lifetime estate and gift tax 
exemption by creating the remainder (check out Chapter 13 for 
more information about the lifetime estate and gift tax exemption). 
In addition, the transfer is treated the same as any other gift for 
Medicaid eligibility purposes. That means you must make the 
transfer more than five years before you apply for Medicaid if you 
want to avoid any delay in eligibility.
Setting up trusts
Trusts used to be a common way for seniors to preserve their 
assets while becoming eligible for Medicaid to pay their nursing 
home expenses. After the five-year look-back period and waiting 
period penalty for transferring assets were enacted, the use of 
trusts became less frequent. (Refer to the earlier section “Using 
gifts and trusts to change eligibility” for more information.) Yet, 
several types of trusts can still be useful if you’re seeking to 
become eligible for Medicaid. We explain them in the following 
sections.
Irrevocable trusts
You can create an irrevocable trust, which means you, the creator, 
or grantor, can’t change the trust. After you set up an irrevocable 
trust and the assets are transferred to it, the trustee is in control 
of the assets, within the confines of the trust agreement and state 
law. You’re no longer treated as owner of the assets if you can’t 

289
 Chapter 12: The State Health Care System Backup: Medicaid
benefit from them. (A revocable trust is the other broad category of 
trusts; a grantor can change this type of trust at any time.)
The irrevocable trust is used to preserve the assets for your heirs 
while qualifying you for Medicaid. The standard trust to meet these 
goals states the trustee will pay you no more than the income from 
the trust for your life. The trust principal (the assets held by the trust 
that are not current income) can’t be spent for your benefit or for the 
benefit of your spouse. After your death, the principal of the trust 
is distributed to your children or other beneficiaries you designate, 
other than your spouse. Medicaid won’t treat the trust principal as 
your asset or your spouse’s asset. The income will be counted as 
yours, and you’ll have to use that to pay for nursing home expenses.
The trust terms can be varied, depending on your needs and state 
law. One alternative wording of the trust is the trustee isn’t able 
to pay anything, even income, to you or your spouse. In that case, 
Medicaid wouldn’t include any income or property of the trust 
among your resources. This variation preserves both the income 
and principal of the trust for your heirs.
The irrevocable trust strategy is only for someone who has sufficient 
assets outside the trust to pay for living expenses. Remember 
transfers of this sort must occur more than five years before 
applying for Medicaid to be immediately eligible for Medicaid. The 
trust preserves the assets for your heirs, ensuring they won’t be 
used to pay for your long-term care. To do that, you won’t be able 
to benefit from the trust principal during your lifetime, so you 
need other means to support yourself.
 
To avoid the penalty for transferring assets to trusts, you have to 
create the trust and transfer assets to it more than five years before 
needing long-term care. Retaining the right to receive the income 
can make it easier to create the trust and fund it before you need 
long-term care. Keep in mind that to ensure Medicaid eligibility you 
can’t have access to the trust principal or have the assets returned 
to you. That must be clear in the trust terms, and the trust must be 
irrevocable so you can’t change its terms. For those reasons, you 
want to transfer only a portion of your assets to such a trust. You 
want to retain enough assets in your name and your spouse’s name 
to maintain financial independence.

290
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
Testamentary trusts
You can establish a testamentary trust to exempt assets you leave 
for the benefit of your surviving spouse. A testamentary trust is a 
trust created in your will. This strategy helps the surviving spouse 
qualify for Medicaid after the other spouse has passed away. It 
has no effect if one spouse needs nursing home care while both 
spouses are alive.
The following two scenarios explain how these trusts work.
 
✓ In the first scenario, your will leaves the entire estate outright 
to your spouse. A few years after your demise, your spouse 
needs long-term care. If he or she applies for Medicaid, the 
money inherited from you counts among your spouse’s assets. 
Those assets will have to be spent on long-term care before 
Medicaid will pay any nursing home expenses.
 
✓ In the second scenario, your will establishes a testamentary 
trust with your spouse as the beneficiary. The trust receives 
all the assets of your estate. The trust doesn’t obligate the 
trustee to use trust assets to pay for your spouse’s support. 
Instead, the trustee has discretion to distribute income and 
principal to your spouse as he thinks is appropriate. Under 
Medicaid rules, the assets of such a trust aren’t included in 
your spouse’s resources when determining Medicaid eligibility. 
Yet, the trustee can use the trust income and principal to 
support your spouse before long-term care is needed. After 
nursing home care is needed, the trust can pay some expenses 
of the spouse while Medicaid pays the main nursing home 
expenses. The trust can pay for expenses not covered by 
Medicaid as well as nonmedical expenses such as legal fees 
and visits by family members.
 
The testamentary trust strategy provides no benefits while both 
spouses are alive. You need another plan to pay for long-term care 
for one spouse while both spouses are living. 

291
 Chapter 12: The State Health Care System Backup: Medicaid
Supplemental needs trusts
You can create a supplemental needs trust as a strategy to be 
eligible for Medicaid. A supplemental needs trust provides income 
for someone under age 65 without affecting their Medicaid eligibility. 
The trusts can fund the care of a child, relative, or even an 
unrelated person who’s disabled and under 65. A supplemental 
needs trust pays expenses not covered by Medicaid. After the 
beneficiary of the trust dies, however, the trust assets are used to 
reimburse the state for its Medicaid expenses.
Buying an immediate annuity
Married couples may be able to preserve assets if the spouse who 
doesn’t need nursing home care purchases an immediate annuity. 
An annuity is best purchased after the other spouse has entered a 
nursing home.
 
This strategy may not be the best one for you because a number of 
states are trying to limit the use of annuities to qualify for Medicaid. 
Make sure you know the details of your state law before pursuing 
this strategy.
Under some circumstances annuities are exempt assets and don’t 
count when determining Medicaid eligibility. Check out the sidebar, 
“Annuities no longer a clear-cut exempt asset” for more specifics.
Unlike assets, the income of the spouse not applying for Medicaid 
isn’t counted as income of the other spouse. The spouse not 
seeking Medicaid can earn any amount of income without affecting 
the other spouse’s eligibility for Medicaid. Purchasing an annuity 
with nonexempt assets is one strategy to consider. But keep in 
mind that if the annuity makes payments for a period of years 
(instead of for life), and you die before that term has expired, the 
state will be beneficiary of the annuity for the rest of the term.

292
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
Here’s an example that shows how these rules can make immediate 
annuities appealing to someone whose spouse needs nursing 
home care and is applying for Medicaid. Suppose you live in 
a state that has a spouse community resource allowance of 
$109,560 in 2009. Your spouse is in a nursing home and applying 
for Medicaid. You and your spouse have $300,000 of nonexempt 
assets. You can purchase an immediate annuity with the difference 
of $190,440 ($300,000 – $109,560). The annuity would be an exempt 
asset, so your spouse would qualify for Medicaid, and you would 
receive and be able to spend the income from the annuity for the 
rest of your life. If you choose payments to be made over a period 
of years, the state must be named the beneficiary in case you die 
before the term of years.
Going the spousal refusal route
Some states allow an unusual and extreme strategy known as 
spousal refusal or the “just say no” strategy. With spousal refusal, 
the spouse not applying for Medicaid simply may refuse to support 
the other spouse. In a state that allows the strategy, the spouse 
declares a refusal to contribute any personal income or resources 
toward the care of the other spouse. The state then must evaluate 
the eligibility of the applying spouse based solely on that spouse’s 
income and assets.
Spousal refusal isn’t a widespread strategy. It’s most likely to be 
used by a second or subsequent spouse of the Medicaid applicant. 
Second spouses tend to want to preserve their assets for children 
of their prior marriages and or more likely to keep assets they 
brought into the marriage separate from joint assets.
 
Simply refusing doesn’t end the process, however. If the state 
decides that the applying spouse is eligible for Medicaid, it can sue 
the other spouse to force support. The states have a mixed record 
of success in these suits, and they don’t always pursue this course 
of action. The state still has an alternative action. It can wait until 
the spouse who refused support dies, and then initiate an action for 
reimbursement against the estate.

293
 Chapter 12: The State Health Care System Backup: Medicaid
Recognizing the downsides of 
Medicaid eligibility strategies
 
When considering the preceding strategies, you need to be aware 
of some potential disadvantages when planning for Medicaid 
eligibility. Keep the following downsides in mind before executing 
any strategy:
 
✓ You have to decide between ensuring your standard of living 
and preserving assets for your children. Most of the strate-
gies involve giving assets away, either directly or through 
trusts, before you need long-term care. For these transfers 
to be effective, they must be real, complete gifts. That means 
whoever you give the assets to (usually your children) are the 
legal owners and can do whatever they want with the assets. 
They’re under no legal obligation to use the assets for your 
care or benefit if you need it. For this reason, you probably 
want to retain enough assets to ensure your standard of living, 
even if that means you won’t be eligible for Medicaid when you 
first need care.
 
✓ After assets are transferred to your children or others, 
those assets are subject to the claims of creditors of the new 
owners. Your children could lose the assets in bankruptcy, 
divorce, lawsuits, substance abuse, gambling, bad investments, 
or excessive spending. Even if your children are trustworthy 
and well-meaning, the assets could be lost through divorce or 
a lawsuit. The assets could be protected if the assets are 
transferred to a trust instead of given directly to individuals, 
but that means incurring the costs of creating a trust and 
perhaps hiring a trustee.
 
✓ Transferring assets to your children could jeopardize the 
amount of financial aid they or your grandchildren receive 
for higher education. The rules can be complicated, but 
generally it’s assumed that parents will spend a certain 
percentage of their net worth on their child’s higher education 
and that the student will spend a greater percentage of 
personal assets on higher education. So transferring assets to 
them to qualify you for Medicaid could mean they must spend 
more on higher education.

✓ When you transfer assets by gift, whether directly or 
through a trust, the tax basis of that property remains the 
same as your tax basis. Whoever eventually sells the property 
will pay capital gains taxes on all the appreciation that 
occurred since you purchased it. If you held the property and 
they inherited through your estate, the basis of the property 
would be increased to its fair market value. In other words, 
no one would pay capital gains taxes on the appreciation that 
occurred during your ownership.
Using Both Medicare and Medicaid
Medicare and Medicaid are two very different programs, though 
many people confuse the two. The good news for you is that you 
may be eligible to receive benefits from both programs. Here’s the 
lowdown on each so you can easily compare them:
 
✓ Medicare: This program, which we discuss in Chapter 11, is 
the primary program to finance medical care for Americans 
age 65 and older. It covers hospitalization and some basic 
medical services. Almost anyone can join Medicare at age 65. 
Upon joining, each beneficiary pays a monthly premium along 
with deductibles and copayments. Medicare pays the rest 
of covered services. Many medical services aren’t covered, 
however. The biggest gap in coverage is for long-term care. 
Medicare generally only pays for brief stays at long-term care 
facilities that are for rehabilitation or recovery after an illness, 
surgery, or injury. It pays only about 15 percent of nursing 
home expenses nationwide and lower percentages of the cost 
of assisted living and home health care.
 
✓ Medicaid: This program is an entitlement program that provides 
medical assistance for those who are deemed unable to afford 
it. It’s for people who have low incomes or who have depleted 
their income and assets. Established in 1965, the program 
now is the largest single payer of long-term care services for 
the elderly and disabled. Nearly 60 percent of nursing home 
residents are Medicaid beneficiaries, according to the National 

295
 Chapter 12: The State Health Care System Backup: Medicaid
Conference of State Legislatures, and the program pays almost 
half the nation’s total nursing home bill. Long-term care 
accounts for about 35 percent of Medicaid budgets. Medicaid 
also pays for a high percentage of home care spending.
If you paid Medicare taxes while working for at least 40 quarters, 
you’re eligible for Medicare simply by reaching age 65 and 
applying. Medicaid, on the other hand, is a means-tested program. 
Eligibility depends on income and asset levels and other factors. 
Because of the differences, it’s possible to be eligible for 
both Medicare and Medicaid. (Check out the earlier section 
“Considering Medicaid Eligibility” for further details.)
 
When someone is eligible for both programs, Medicare pays first 
and Medicaid then pays any expenses not covered by Medicare. 
So for eligible seniors and for care covered by both programs, 
Medicaid may pick up all the costs Medicare doesn’t cover, such 
as deductibles and copayments. Medicaid also has broader 
coverage than Medicare. Medicaid, for example, covers dental care, 
transportation to and from doctor’s offices, and of course long-term 
nursing home care.
Eyeing Reasons Not 
to Seek Medicaid
Depending on your personal finances, you may not want to seek 
coverage by Medicaid. In the following list, we cover major reasons 
you may not want to receive Medicaid benefits to pay your long-
term care expenses:
 
✓ Ethics: Medicaid is a program to provide medical services for 
impoverished people who otherwise couldn’t afford them. 
Anyone who rearranges his finances to qualify for Medicaid 
is someone who could afford the services for at least a while 
but prefers not to pay for them. Instead, he wants his assets to 
go to his spouse, children, or others while taxpayers provide 
for his nursing home care. Some people think this behavior 

296
Part III: Dealing with Government Programs 
is unethical or at least poor citizenship. Others believe it’s 
ethical and proper to take any action permitted by the laws 
and regulations to establish eligibility for the program just as 
people take steps to legally minimize and reduce their taxes.
 
✓ Quality of services: Compared to the rates levied on private 
pay patients, Medicare provides relatively low reimbursement 
rates to nursing homes for the care of eligible members. In 
2009, most state Medicaid programs reimbursed nursing 
homes around $100 per day of residence of a covered 
beneficiary. Some nursing homes say they can’t provide 
quality services at the Medicaid reimbursement rate, and 
most of the higher-quality nursing homes either don’t admit 
Medicaid beneficiaries or limit the number of Medicaid 
beneficiaries they will admit.
 
 Before deciding to let Medicaid pay for any nursing home care 
you need, research some local nursing homes. Compare those 
with primarily Medicaid residents to those that limit their 
Medicaid admissions. Decide whether you want to be a resident 
in the facilities that primarily have Medicaid residents.
 
✓ Limited coverage: A major gap in Medicaid coverage is in 
assisted living care, which is the level between home care and 
nursing home care. This is the preferred level of care for many 
seniors who need help with some daily living activities. Most 
long-term care insurance policies cover assisted living and 
home care, but Medicaid has limited home care coverage and 
doesn’t cover assisted living.
Some people don’t have enough resources to pay for much long-
term care. They have little choice but to depend on Medicaid. 
Others have a choice, especially if they plan early and take out 
long-term care insurance.
 
For most people, the best solution is to plan to pay for long-term 
care for up to five years through a combination of insurance and 
personal resources. If care beyond five years is needed, Medicaid 
may be a necessary option after other resources are exhausted. 
The five-year strategy also can mesh neatly with Medicaid’s five-
year look-back rules. Planning to become eligible for Medicaid in 
five years can begin shortly before or after nursing home care is 
needed. For most people, Medicaid should be a backup plan instead 
of the primary source of long-term care funding.

297
 Chapter 12: The State Health Care System Backup: Medicaid
Finding additional information 
about Medicaid
Medicaid is a complicated program, 
and the specific rules vary from state 
to state. The best source of information 
is your state’s Medicaid agency. You 
can find the contact information on your 
state’s Web site or on the Web site of the 
federal agency, the Centers for Medicare 
and Medicaid Services, at www.cms.
hhs.gov. You also may want to consult 
an estate planner or an elder law 
attorney who’s familiar with your state’s 
laws and policies. Medicaid doesn’t offer 
a toll-free number. If you’re not Web 
savvy, we suggest you call directory 
assistance and ask for the local office of 
your state’s Medicaid agency.

In this part . . .
E

possessions, you should have an estate 
plan. In this important part, we explain the basics 
of estate planning, wills, and other legal docu-
ments. We also discuss how to best plan your 
estate, including a discussion of trusts, should 
you have the “problem” of too much money. We 
round out the part with information on estate

E
state planning is bewildering, confusing, and intimidating to 
most people. To complicate matters, many people encounter 
quite a bit of misinformation and misunderstanding. The result: 
Few people have estate plans.
However, an estate plan is an essential part of life because it 
determines what happens to your assets after you die. An estate 
plan isn’t simply a will or life insurance policy. And estate plan-
ning involves much more than avoiding taxes. You need an estate 
plan even if your estate isn’t valuable enough to be hit with 
estate taxes.
In this chapter, we define estate planning and review the basic ele-
ments of a plan. We discuss how to go about developing a plan and 
how to work with an estate planning professional. In the following 
chapters in Part IV, we discuss wills, trusts, probate, taxes, and 
other estate planning subjects in more detail.

302
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers  
Understanding Estate Planning
Many people think estate planning is only for those rich enough to 
be hit with federal estate taxes and probate. Others believe joint 
ownership of property or owning life insurance is the only estate 
planning they need. These notions are wrong. Everyone needs an 
estate plan, and it should include several important documents 
regardless of how wealthy you are.
 
Estate planning is the process of planning for the transfer of owner-
ship of your assets to the recipients of your choice in the most effi-
cient way possible — minimizing the taxes, other expenses, and 
time involved. The recipients could include your spouse, significant 
other, children, grandchildren, other loved ones, and charity. A 
good estate plan also ensures that your estate has enough cash to 
pay immediate (such as burial) and ongoing expenses, that any 
trusts you create are properly managed, and that your assets are 
managed and sold competently. Another feature of an estate plan is 
the designation of who will manage your assets, pay your bills, and 
make medical decisions if you’re unable.
From a big-picture standpoint, the estate planning process has two 
important steps: deciding on your goals and deciding which legal 
tools to use to accomplish those goals.
However estate planning isn’t quite so simple. Here are the more 
detailed steps of the process:
 
1. List all your assets and debts.
 
 Regardless of your financial situation, this step is the start-
ing point for an estate plan. Be sure to include all assets. The 
estate tax broadly defines assets. Assets include not only prop-
erty you own (or partly own) but also rights you have such as 
in trusts, annuities, pension, and life insurance. In Chapter 15 
we discuss some assets people frequently overlook. Your list 
of debts (your legal obligations to pay money or property to 
others) also is important. Heirs inherit only net assets (gross 
assets less debts and other liabilities), and the estate won’t be 
processed through probate until debts are paid. So an estate 
plan must include a debt payment plan.

303
 Chapter 13: The Basics on Estate Planning
 
 The more work you do to compile a complete list of assets and 
liabilities and prepare other information, the less your estate plan 
will cost. Most estate planning attorneys can provide you with a 
questionnaire or worksheet to help list your assets and debts. 
Books and Web sites on estate planning also often have similar 
questionnaires. (Check out the later section “Answering Key 
Questions to Gather Critical Information” to help you after you 
create your list and before you meet with your estate planner.)
 
2. Prepare an income statement.
 
 An income statement (also called a cash flow statement) is a 
list of the income and expenses you expect during the cur-
rent year. If you prepare a monthly or annual budget, you 
already have this. It can be as formal or informal as you like. 
Its purpose is to give your estate planner and executor a clear 
picture of your cash inflows and outflows. Preparing this type 
of statement can help you develop a plan for the estate to pay 
bills and debts.
 
3. Decide how you want the assets to be distributed.
 
 An estate planner can help develop your goals based on expe-
rience with other estates. Usually the estate planner is an 
attorney who specializes in this area. When a valuable or com-
plicated estate is involved, a team of financial professionals 
could be working on the plan, including a financial planner, an 
accountant, an insurance agent or broker, and a financial plan-
ner or other investment professional. Usually one professional 
is the leader or “quarterback” in charge of the big picture and 
coordination while the others concentrate on specific areas. 
(See the later section “Using an expert: Yes or no?” for more 
details on finding and selecting an estate planner.)
 
 In your plans, make sure you develop initial goals for dividing 
assets among your spouse, children, grandchildren, charities, 
and others. Key issues to consider are whether children should 
receive equal shares, how much your spouse should inherit out-
right, and how much you want to give to charity. We provide 
more specific help with this step in the later section “Answering 
Key Questions to Gather Critical Information.” If you have a 
blended family (are married to your second spouse and have 
stepchildren), the decisions can be more complicated and may 
require you to talk them through with your estate planner.

304
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers  
 
4. Consider secondary goals.
 
 Examples of secondary goals include placing controls or 
restrictions on inheritances instead of giving property 
directly. An estate plan often involves trade-offs, because fully 
reaching all your goals may not be possible. You may have to 
decide that some goals are more important than others.
 
5. Resolve how much property to give now and how much to 
give later.
 
 You can reap both tax and nontax benefits if you make lifetime 
gifts instead of waiting to make bequests through your estate. 
We discuss these benefits and other aspects of lifetime giving 
in Chapter 15.
 
6. Work with one or more estate planning professionals to 
develop your estate plan.
 
 After you assess your assets and liabilities, cash flow, and 
goals, it’s time to work with one or more professionals to 
develop a plan. A typical middle-class family usually needs 
to work only with an estate planning attorney or an attorney 
and a financial planner or accountant. Wealthier individuals, 
especially those who own businesses or other complicated 
assets, may need a team that includes one or more attorneys, 
an accountant, a life insurance broker, a business appraiser, a 
trustee, and other professionals.
 
7. Understand your estate plan.
 
 Be an active participant in developing your plan, and be sure 
you understand it. Don’t be afraid to ask questions if you don’t 
understand something. A couple surveys by Private Wealth 
magazine revealed that a high percentage of estate plans 
aren’t implemented because clients didn’t understand them, 
and the attorneys didn’t adequately explain the plans.
 
8. Implement the plan.
 
 You had an estate plan created for good reasons, and you spent 
lots of time and money on it. So be sure to implement it; other-
wise, your estate may be in jeopardy later. Your will, trusts, and 
any other documents need to be legally executed (signed and 
witnessed or notarized as required by your state’s law). Legal 
ownership of assets needs to be transferred to trusts. If the plan 
is to make gifts to loved ones or charity, be sure the gifts are 

305
 Chapter 13: The Basics on Estate Planning
made as scheduled. After a plan is developed, your estate plan-
ner should provide a checklist of actions you need to take. Be 
sure to follow through and take those actions.
 
9. Explain the general idea of the plan to your heirs.
 
 The top reason for estate disputes probably is surprise. When 
one or more heirs are surprised by the details of the estate 
plan, hurt feelings can lead to disputes. You can reduce the 
potential for disputes by telling family members, in general, 
what the plan is, especially any terms that may surprise some-
one. Doing so gives your loved ones a chance to absorb the 
news, ask questions, and hear your explanation.
 
 Most estate planners don’t recommend that you give family 
members (other than the persons picked to be executors or 
trustees) copies of the will or other estate planning docu-
ments. They don’t need to see every detail in advance. 
Besides, you’ll likely need to modify the plan every few years, 
resulting in the need to circulate copies after every change. 
Finally, you also don’t want multiple copies of your will circu-
lating. When it comes time for the will to be probated, dis-
putes could arise over which is the latest valid version.
 
10. Review and update the plan.
 
 An estate plan isn’t fixed and permanent — your situation 
evolves. The tax law, financial environment, and other factors 
change. Every two years or so, meet with your estate plan-
ner to review the plan, compare it to changes in your life, and 
decide whether adjustments should be made. You also should 
meet with the estate planner after major changes in your 
family, such as births, deaths, marriages, and divorces.
Studying Some Strategies Before 
Starting Your Estate Plan
Estate planning can be overwhelming at first. Attorneys use their 
own language, and many of them can’t translate it for regular folks. 
Some attorneys and estate planners also like to use a cookie-cutter 
approach, offering the same basic estate plan to almost everyone 

306
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers  
without explanation or consideration for the person’s situation. 
Even when an attorney explains things well, the plan can be con-
fusing because a wide range of strategies is available and each has 
different advantages and disadvantages.
Despite some of the confusing messages you may receive, you 
should know some basic rules and guidelines that apply to every 
estate plan. That’s because although strategies and tools differ 
between plans, some key principles apply whether an estate is 
worth $50,000 or $50 million. Study the principles in the following 
sections before meeting with an estate planner and diving into the 
details of will clauses, trusts, probate, and the like.
Finish your plan no matter what
Many people don’t start or don’t finish estate plans, because they 
can’t resolve certain issues. Their estate plans get stalled for any 
number of reasons. Don’t let such issues leave you with no estate 
plan.
Some of these issues may include the following:
 
✓ Spouses may not agree on who should be guardians of their 
children or whether to restrict the control children have over 
their inheritances.
 
✓ An estate owner may be uncertain whether to give equally to 
the children or how much to give to charity.
 
✓ In large or complicated estates, the owner may be unable to 
choose from among different strategies offered by the estate 
planner.
 
You don’t need to complete an estate plan in one step; creating it in 
phases is actually a smarter move. That’s because some things can 
be changed easily while others are irreversible. For example, you 
may start with a basic will and powers of attorney. (These are dis-
cussed in more detail in Chapter 14.) Over time, goals can be devel-
oped and refined, disagreements resolved, and the rest of the plan 
(such as trusts, gifts, and business succession plans) put in place.

307
 Chapter 13: The Basics on Estate Planning
Keep track of your estate
When putting together your estate plan, keep detailed records 
and maintain a complete list of your assets and liabilities (and the 
estate administrator and estate planner need to know where to 
locate that list). The list should include the following information:
 
✓ Account names and numbers
 
✓ Balances as of a certain date
 
✓ Contact information
 
✓ Internet passwords and usernames
 
Your estate administrator may be able to locate all your assets in a 
reasonable time and be able to process your estate without a list 
of assets and liabilities. However, searching for the information 
drives up the expense and time involved in processing the estate, 
delaying the settlement and distribution. Also, the recommended 
estate plan may have been different if the overlooked assets were 
known earlier.
 
To help your estate administrator and heirs, prepare a notebook 
that includes statements of your assets and liabilities and cash 
flow. Include copies of recent account statements, income tax 
returns, and other ownership information (or at least note where 
this information can be found). Update the notebook annually, and 
let your administrator know where it can be located.
There’s a story that the late comedian W.C. Fields didn’t trust 
banks, so he had small amounts of money stashed in banks all 
over the country. He didn’t keep a master list of the banks, so 
his heirs never were sure they found all the money. They spent 
money trying to track down all the accounts. Fields probably 
knew how to find everything, but he never gave anyone else all 
the information.
We see different versions of these events play out in estates all the 
time. Here are just a few examples:

308
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers  
 
✓ Estate owners may open a number of investment accounts 
over the years and then do little with them.
 
✓ Balances may be left in the retirement plans of former employers.
 
✓ Life insurance policies and annuities may be purchased and 
left in drawers or files.
Estimate cash flow
Estates need cash for all these reasons and more:
 
✓ If you have dependents, their expenses must be paid while the 
estate is being processed.
 
✓ The expenses of maintaining your estate, especially the costs 
of running your home and other properties, need to be paid.
 
✓ The expenses of the estate, such as lawyer’s fees, probate 
court costs, and taxes, need to be paid.
 
✓ Your debts must be paid.
A number of estates, unfortunately, are asset rich and cash poor. 
The estate owners reduced taxes and decided how to divide their 
assets, but they didn’t ensure that their estates had enough cash 
(or assets that could easily be converted to cash).
 
Your estate can’t be processed and distributed to heirs until all 
the debts and expenses are paid. If enough cash isn’t available to 
make payments, assets must be sold. In this case, you risk having 
assets sold in a hurry and at distress prices simply to raise cash. 
To avoid this unpleasant outcome, be sure cash flow planning is 
part of your estate plan.
Don’t wait for the perfect plan
Estate planning involves trade-offs. Among the trade-offs are those 
relating to your goals, estate taxes, the needs and wishes of your 
family, charitable inclinations, and the economy and financial 

309
 Chapter 13: The Basics on Estate Planning
markets. Don’t expect an estate plan to be perfect, and don’t 
expect there to be one right plan for you.
Except for simple, basic estates, estate planners present choices 
and alternatives. Each has advantages and disadvantages. As the 
estate owner, you decide the plan features that have the best 
trade-offs among the many factors.
Carefully choose executors 
and trustees
Make sure you take your time to select the right executors and 
trustees for your estate. Executors and trustees are the people 
who implement your estate plans. The executor (or administrator) 
is the person who manages the estate, shepherds it through pro-
bate court, and distributes the assets. A trustee controls any prop-
erty that was put in a trust and manages it according to the trust 
agreement and state law.
The executor and trustee don’t have to be the same person. In 
fact, it may be a good idea to name different people. A trustee, 
for example, is likely to manage property for much longer than an 
executor, and the responsibilities of the two jobs are different.
Often the selection of executors and trustees is an afterthought. 
The executor usually is the oldest adult child of the estate owner; 
it also can be the estate planning lawyer. The trustee is a bank sug-
gested by the lawyer. These may or may not be good choices; if 
better choices are evident for you, go with those. Too often good 
estate plans are ruined because the wrong people are selected for 
these jobs. These folks may not be suitable for the positions or 
may not understand what the estate owner wanted.
 
When deciding who will be your executor and trustee, consider per-
sonal skills, time commitment, cost, and knowledge of your family 
and your wishes. For some, the best compromise is to name both a 
family member and a lawyer or other professional to share the posi-
tions as coexecutors or cotrustees. You can either divide their 
duties or require them to agree on each item before taking action.

310
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers  
 
No matter who you decide on for these positions, make your 
choices known to family members. Early notice gives them an 
opportunity to get used to the decisions and gives you an idea of 
whether it will work.
Anticipate conflicts
Most estate problems occur because of conflicts. When planning 
your estate, consider the potential conflicts and structure the plan 
to avoid or minimize them.
You may encounter different types of conflicts, such as from the 
following:
 
✓ Family members: They sometimes have personality conflicts. 
For example, maybe two or more members simply don’t get 
along. You won’t be around to mediate the disputes or keep 
people in line. With money at stake — and the death of a loved 
one charging relatives’ emotions — don’t expect these mem-
bers to suddenly be able to manage property jointly or share 
the property. A better solution may be to give each of them 
sole ownership of different assets. If that means directing the 
executor to sell assets and distribute the cash, you probably 
should do that.
 
 Or suppose your plan for dividing the personal property of the 
estate is to let the children decide among themselves. In some 
families this method works. In other families, the children argue 
over the process and ultimately how the assets are divided.
 
✓ The actual estate plan: Suppose you put most of your estate 
in a trust and name your spouse trustee. That trust is intended 
to support your spouse for life, and the remainder of it goes 
to your children. The children may decide the trust should be 
invested more for long-term growth, while your spouse may 
invest it to maximize income. The situation could lead to hard 
feelings and perhaps litigation (even though your spouse is 
named trustee).

311
 Chapter 13: The Basics on Estate Planning
 
You know your family. Do your best to assess how the members 
may react to different parts of the plan, and change the plan if you 
foresee conflicts and disputes. Also, benefit from the guidance and 
input of a competent planning professional who has witnessed 
firsthand what works and what causes conflicts in similar family 
situations. You may be uncomfortable or embarrassed at the 
thought of discussing some family situations with a stranger, but 
your estate planner likely has seen or heard it all before. (Refer to 
the section “Using an expert: Yes or no?” for more information on 
working with a professional.)
Answering Key Questions to 
Gather Critical Information
A major reason that people don’t have estate plans is they don’t 
know how to begin. As we state earlier in this chapter, the best 
starting point is developing a list of your assets and debts. After 
you do so, you can put the list aside and ask yourself some impor-
tant questions before completely developing your plan.
 
Your estate planner won’t be able to do much without the answers 
to the questions we discuss in the following sections. Consider 
these questions before meeting with an estate planner. The planner 
will discuss them with you, help you refine the answers, and 
develop a plan consistent with the answers. Even when your estate 
is small, you need to decide who will be in charge of your estate, 
how your personal property will be distributed, and other key 
issues. You may not need to spend a lot of time with an attorney to 
resolve the issues, but they should be resolved.
In this section, we review the key estate planning questions relat-
ing to who should receive the wealth, how much each recipient 
should receive, when the wealth should be transferred, and how 
the wealth should be transferred.

312
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers  
Who’s in charge?
Your estate needs at least one executor or administrator (depend-
ing on the term your state uses). Also, every trust you create needs 
at least one trustee. The right choices depend on your family and its 
dynamics. Check out the earlier section “Carefully choose executors 
and trustees” for help with this decision.
How much should I give now?
An important decision you have to consider before developing your 
plan is whether you’ll bestow gifts now. If you give away property 
now by making a lifetime gift, the current value isn’t included in 
your estate. Future appreciation also is excluded. There are some 
good reasons to make lifetime gifts instead of waiting for loved ones 
to receive them through your estate. Here they are:
 
✓ You may receive a tax incentive. When your estate is subject 
to estate or inheritance taxes, the federal estate tax provides 
an annual gift tax exemption and a lifetime gift tax exemption. 
In addition, as explained earlier, the gift and any future appre-
ciation are out of your estate.
 
✓ You may have personal reasons for making lifetime gifts. 
You may want to see loved ones enjoy the benefits of the 
wealth. Or, you may want to use lifetime gifts to help your 
loved ones learn how to handle more money or to let you see 
how they’ll use the wealth. When you don’t like the way they 
handle the wealth, you may decide not to make further lifetime 
gifts. You also may decide to reduce the amount they receive 
in your will or leave it in trust instead of directly to them. Or 
you may decide they need some kind of instruction on how to 
manage money.
 
✓ Lifetime charitable giving may be more satisfying. You get to 
see the benefits of your gifts, the money reaches the charity 
sooner, and you receive income tax deductions.
For more on lifetime gifts, see Chapter 15.

313
 Chapter 13: The Basics on Estate Planning
Should I apply controls 
and incentives?
Estate owners always have been concerned that gifts to their loved 
ones would be wasted or make the recipients lazy, spoiled, or 
worse. Starting in the 1990s, more people began acting on these 
concerns by creating trusts called incentive trusts that distribute 
money only under certain conditions, such as when the benefi-
ciary reaches certain goals or behaves certain ways.
Here are the two general types of restrictions that incentive trusts 
are based on:
 
✓ Age: This restriction is a classic one that limits distributions 
of income and principal until the beneficiary reaches a certain 
age. Until then, the trustee has discretion over how much to 
distribute each year or distributes only the income but keeps 
the principal in the trust.
 
✓ Meeting a milestone: With this type of restriction, the benefi-
ciary receives a distribution only after achieving a milestone, 
such as attaining a certain academic degree, holding a job for 
a minimum time, reaching a certain income level, attending 
church, getting married, or whatever other goals the parents 
establish. The incentives are limited only by the trust creator’s 
imagination and goals.
 
 The trustee determines whether the milestones are met. In the 
event that the designated beneficiary fails to ever reach des-
ignated milestones, the trust should have named contingent 
beneficiaries who receive the wealth when the initial benefi-
ciary doesn’t meet the milestones.
Some folks are critical of incentive trusts, and some lawyers won’t 
even draft them. They view the trusts as an attempt to control 
loved ones from beyond the grave. Also, they think the incentives 
can be too detailed and restrictive.
 
A tightly written trust doesn’t allow for changing times and 
circumstances (and keep in mind that the trust could be in effect 
for decades). If an incentive trust is used, it should have some 

314
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers  
flexibility. An alternative approach is to give the trustee discre-
tion over distributions and leave the trustee a letter of instruc-
tions outlining your goals and intentions.
Should heirs get equal shares?
Most parents leave each of their children equal shares of their 
estates, but you may need to ask yourself whether you have rea-
sons to consider unequal shares in your plan. Why would you con-
sider giving unequal shares? Consider the following reasons:
 
✓ An offspring is irresponsible. You may leave an offspring a 
smaller share if you believe the funds will be wasted or mis-
managed. An alternative way to avoid waste or mismanage-
ment of the wealth is to leave it in a trust with restrictions on 
the distributions or discretion by the trustee.
 
✓ One offspring is more financially successful. You may leave 
less money to a child who’s more successful financially than 
the others. In this case, you need to make your intentions 
known and understood ahead of time.
 
✓ An offspring isn’t involved in a family business. When all 
the children aren’t involved in the business on a daily basis, it 
may be best not to leave an interest in the business to those 
not involved in it. Otherwise the children could experience 
conflicts over distributions of profits and other decisions. 
You can avoid these problems by leaving shares to only those 
involved in the business. The others can inherit other assets. 
If you don’t have enough assets to equalize the inheritances, 
life insurance may be a way to avoid unequal inheritances.
 
When deciding how much to leave each heir, don’t forget any lifetime 
gifts and assistance you made to them. One child may have received 
more lifetime assistance than the others. The children aren’t likely to 
forget that even though you may have. To ensure that inheritances 
really are equal, subtract significant lifetime gifts from inheritances. 
In fact, some wills state each heir’s inheritance will be reduced by 
lifetime gifts. For this method to be effective, however, you must 
keep an updated list of the gifts you want subtracted.

315
 Chapter 13: The Basics on Estate Planning
Should I exclude someone?
Most states won’t let you completely disinherit a spouse, unless you 
have a premarital or postmarital agreement. But anyone else, even 
children, can be completely excluded from the will. Many families 
have at least one child who is estranged, is a substance abuser, 
or has other problems. When the child is well into adulthood and 
shows no sign of changing, you can consider disinheriting the child.
Disinheriting a family member can potentially backfire. The child 
may challenge the will or demand money from the other family 
members in return for not challenging the will. Even if the disin-
herited person doesn’t have a strong legal case, the challenge may 
delay settlement of the estate, cost the estate money, and disrupt 
everyone’s lives.
 
Rather than completely excluding someone from your will, you 
have a couple alternative options:
 
✓ Leave the inheritance in a trust with restrictions. We discuss 
this option in the “Should I apply controls and incentives?” 
section earlier in this chapter.
 
✓ Leave the “black sheep” something in the will, but make it 
less than a full share. In addition, include a clause stating any 
beneficiary who unsuccessfully challenges the will forfeits 
whatever they were left in the will. The trick is determining the 
amount that’s meaningful enough to deter a will challenge but 
that’s not more than you want to give.
How should my blended 
family be handled?
How you handle a blended family is up to you and your own cir-
cumstances. The key is to decide on a plan and communicate it to 
those individuals involved.
A blended family is something other than the traditional family 
of parents who have been married only to each other and had 
children only with each other. Some people are married to second 

316
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers  
(or subsequent) spouses. They may have both their own children 
and stepchildren. They may have biological children from more 
than one marriage or relationship. A number of possibilities exist, 
and they can all complicate estate planning.
 
There’s no right or wrong plan for blended families. Some people 
provide for only their spouse and biological children. Other people 
decide their adult children from a first marriage are already on 
their own and provided for, and then decide to leave most of their 
estate to children from the second marriage. Sometimes the second 
spouse is secure financially and doesn’t share in the estate.
Should I leave only money?
Some of the biggest estate problems and headaches are caused by 
nonfinancial assets. For example, some assets, such as personal 
property, collections, and mementos, often trigger disputes among 
family members. More than one family member will want an asset 
and be willing to fight over it. Some valuable assets also have emo-
tional value, such as your residence or vacation home. You need 
to develop a way to distribute these items without triggering a 
major conflict. You can handle it in a couple of ways:
 
✓ Your can set up a lottery or other system that decides who 
inherits the items. You can choose from many types of lot-
teries. One simple system is for each child to draw a number 
from a hat. The child with the lowest number first picks any 
item from the estate. The rest of the children pick items in 
order of the numbers they selected. In the second round of 
selections, the order is reversed. This continues until all the 
property is selected. Your estate planner may have other 
ideas, or you can come up with your own.
 
✓ You can leave the decision to the executor or have family 
members agree on a distribution. These are the most fre-
quent ways property is distributed. However, you need to 
decide whether they’ll work for your family. Will your children 
trust the executor to be fair, or will they complain one child 
was favored? Will the children be able to work out a distribu-
tion or argue over the property?

317
 Chapter 13: The Basics on Estate Planning
Each of these approaches has the potential to cause problems. No 
system is always right. When either of these methods is likely to 
cause problems in your family, seek another method. Your goal 
should be to choose a selection system that minimizes the con-
flicts among family members.
 
To avoid these problems, you may direct your estate executor to 
sell all the potential problem assets and distribute only cash to ben-
eficiaries. Even though estate professionals have experienced many 
problem situations, you know your family better than the estate 
planner. Get the best advice you can, and then decide whether sell-
ing the assets is better than trying to distribute them.
Should my wealth stay 
in the family?
You may want to leave some of your estate to charity or even to 
people outside the family, which, of course, is your personal pref-
erence. The issue is that you’ll be deciding to give part of your 
wealth to the charity instead of to family. You should consider 
whether loved ones will have to reduce their living standards 
because of the gift to charity and whether they arranged their 
affairs in expectation of receiving that part of your estate. If you 
decide to leave part of your estate to a person or organization out-
side the family, your estate planner can help decide the best way 
to do so. We offer several options regarding charities in Chapter 
15. It’s important that you tell your loved ones about the decision 
and why you made it.
Knowing How Estate Taxes Work
The impact of the federal estate and gift tax on most American 
families has declined since the 2001 tax law was enacted. The law 
gradually increased the value of estates excluded from the estate 
tax. The federal estate tax was repealed in 2010 and is scheduled 
to be reinstated (at 2001 levels) in 2011.

318
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers  
As we write in early 2010, it’s likely that something similar to the law 
that was in effect in 2009 will be made permanent. That means estates 
worth less than $3.5 million will be exempt from the federal estate tax, 
and the top tax rate will be 45 percent. The lifetime gift tax exemp-
tion will remain at $1 million. It’s possible a higher exempt amount 
and lower tax rate will be enacted, perhaps a $5 million exemption 
and 35 percent maximum tax rate. Always be sure to check the cur-
rent law early in your estate planning process (see Eric’s Web site, 
www.erictyson.com, or Bob’s, www.retirementwatch.com, for 
updates).
 
The estate and gift tax exemptions and tax rates will determine part 
of your estate planning. When your estate is below the exempt 
amount and not likely to rise above it in the next few years, you can 
ignore federal estate taxes in your planning. If that describes your 
estate, skip this section and the next chapter, and focus your plan 
on the best ways to transfer your wealth to those you want to 
receive it. But if your estate is valuable enough to be taxed, you 
need to read this section. Your plan is likely to need ways to trans-
fer wealth to your loved ones at the lowest tax cost.
In this section, we review the basics of the federal estate and gift 
tax and state taxes. In Chapters 15 and 16 we discuss tax reduction 
strategies in detail for those whose estates may be hit with the tax.
Reviewing the estate tax
The federal estate and gift tax is what lawyers call a unified tax. 
You’re taxed on transfers of your property to others whether 
they’re made during life (gifts) or through your will (bequests). 
When your executor calculates the estate tax, the estate receives 
credit for gift taxes paid during your life. The estate and gift tax is 
imposed on the value of the assets you either gave away or owned 
at your death.
In a nutshell, here are the steps your executor will take to compute 
the tax on your estate tax return. (You can get more details on this 
calculation in Chapter 15.)

319
 Chapter 13: The Basics on Estate Planning
 
1. List all the assets you own and value them.
 
 The result is your gross estate.
 
2.  Subtract deductions from the gross estate.
 
 The key deductions are the marital deduction (any property 
inherited by your spouse) and the charitable contribution 
deduction (any property donated to charity). Expenses of 
administering the estate also are deductible. The result is the 
taxable estate.
 
3. Compute the tax and apply the lifetime credit. The credit 
effectively exempts part of the estate from taxes.
 
The estate tax should be considered with the gift tax, because the 
two taxes are “unified” in the tax code. You’re supposed to pay a 
transfer tax whether you give assets away during your lifetime or 
through your estate. That transfer tax is factored into the estate tax 
computation.
Gifts to others are supposed to be taxed, but the gift tax has sev-
eral key exceptions that allow you to remove assets from your 
estate without incurring any gift or estate taxes:
 
✓ Each person can give a certain amount tax free per year as 
gifts. This annual gift tax exclusion is indexed for inflation and 
was $13,000 in 2010. Suppose you have three children. You 
can give each of these children up to $13,000 of gifts each year 
without triggering gift tax issues. You can make exempt gifts to 
as many people as you want (and can afford to). Spouses can 
make gifts jointly. In those cases, they double the exclusion. 
In 2010 a married couple can give each child up to $26,000 of 
exempt gifts. The exclusion applies to gifts to anyone, not just 
your family members.
 
✓ Each person can give a certain amount in his/her lifetime 
exempt from the lifetime gift tax. Gift taxes still aren’t due 
after the annual exclusion is exhausted. Each person also has 
a lifetime gift tax credit that effectively exempts $1 million 
of gifts from the tax. When a gift exceeds the annual gift tax 
exclusion, the gift tax is computed on the excess amount, and 
the lifetime credit is applied against the tax. You pay gift taxes 
only after making more than $1 million of lifetime gifts that 
exceed the annual exclusion.

320
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers  
 
 The estate tax credit is reduced by the amount of the lifetime gift 
tax credit used. When no taxable gifts are made during your life-
time, the estate tax credit shields up to $3.5 million in assets 
from the estate tax. But if the full lifetime gift tax credit was used, 
only the first $2.5 million of the estate avoids the estate tax.
Considering state taxes
You should be aware that state estate and inheritance taxes could 
be an issue for you, and they could be higher than the federal tax. 
Be sure that your estate planner discusses the issue with you or 
that you check your state’s taxes with either the department of 
taxation or a local tax or estate expert.
Each state is allowed to impose its own taxes on the assets of the 
deceased. Some states don’t impose taxes. Others impose one 
of the following two, which usually have the same effect but are 
referred to differently:
 
✓ Estate tax: Like the federal estate tax, these taxes are owed by 
the estate of the deceased and are based on the value of its 
assets after considering deductions and credits.
 
✓ Inheritance tax: An inheritance tax also is based on the value of 
assets, but it’s imposed on the person who inherits an asset.
Usually the estate pays an inheritance tax before distributing 
assets to the beneficiaries. But both taxes reduce the after-tax 
wealth that can be distributed to beneficiaries.
 
The state taxes used to be considered insignificant. However 
because of the federal estate tax cuts, state taxes can be much more 
significant than federal taxes. That’s why you must consider state 
taxes in your estate plan. The taxes in some states start to be 
imposed on relatively small estates. In these states, taxes can signifi-
cantly deplete a person’s estate, especially if it’s small to begin with.
You may owe taxes in a state in which you don’t live, so your 
executor may have to deal with several states when processing 
your estate. Real estate is subject to estate or inheritance taxes 
in the state where it’s located. Personal property (anything other 

321
 Chapter 13: The Basics on Estate Planning
than real estate) is taxed in the state of your residence. So if you 
own a second property in a state other than your primary state of 
residence, your executor or heirs have to consider the tax laws in 
the two states.
 
You may be able to avoid the two-state tax problem. You can trans-
fer ownership of the real estate to a trust, partnership, limited lia-
bility company, or corporation. Then, you technically don’t own the 
real estate. The trust or other entity owns the real estate. You own 
shares in an entity such as the partnership. Those shares are per-
sonal property and are taxed and probated in the state in which 
you live. The value of the real estate determines the tax, but the tax 
won’t be imposed by the state in which the real estate is located.
Finding Good, Affordable Advice
When putting together your estate plan, you can access a number 
of tools and sources of advice whether you’re going it alone or 
getting help from an estate planning professional. The size of your 
estate affects the level of advice and assistance that you need 
when drafting your estate plan. The following sections give an 
overview of the types of advice you can use and how to find them.
Doing it yourself
When your estate is well below the taxable level and the terms of 
your will are straightforward, you may be able to turn to technol-
ogy and forego an attorney (check out the next section for using 
an attorney). Several Web sites and different types of software can 
help you prepare a basic will.
In general, with these tools you complete a questionnaire and the 
Web site or software presents a valid will and other documents 
that conform to your answers. These sources are an affordable 
way to prepare a valid, effective estate plan. They can be used in 
uncomplicated situations, such as when all or most of the estate 
will be left to your spouse (with the estate going to your children if 
your spouse already is deceased).

322
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers  
 
You must investigate any Web site or software you use. The only 
source we have reviewed and are comfortable recommending is 
Nolo Press (visit www.nolo.com). Many others are available, and 
some of them may be fine, but we haven’t reviewed their services 
or products.
 
If your situation goes beyond the basic, uncomplicated one, you 
still have ways to get quality, affordable estate planning advice. 
Suppose, for example, you have a straightforward estate plan with 
just a couple of twists, and you think a Web site or software pro-
gram helped you produce valid documents that do what you want. 
But you aren’t quite sure. You could ask an estate planning attor-
ney to review your documents and offer a second opinion. Because 
the attorney will do less work, this method should cost less than 
having him prepare the plan. The attorney will meet with you to 
get an understanding of your situation and goals, and then he’ll 
review the documents. Most likely he’ll tell you that the docu-
ments don’t need to be changed. If anything, he may recommend 
some small changes.
Using an expert: Yes or no?
If your estate is closer to the taxable level, or you’re just not com-
fortable taking on planning your own estate by yourself, you may 
want to consult an expert for help. Estate planning experts usually 
are attorneys.
 
Although using an attorney is more expensive than going on your 
own, you can reduce the cost by doing a fair amount of work in 
advance. You should collect and put in a clear format all the infor-
mation the attorney will need. This information includes your 
assets and liabilities, your cash flow, and details about your family. 
You also should spend time considering the questions we present 
in the earlier section “Answering Key Questions to Gather Critical 
Information.” These steps can save a few hours of the estate plan-
ner’s time, and that saves you money.
In the following sections, we provide information on sources that 
can help you find an estate planning expert and how to choose one.

323
 Chapter 13: The Basics on Estate Planning
Finding prospects
If you want to use an estate planning attorney, you may wonder 
where you find one. Consider the following sources:
 
✓ State and local bar associations: These associations usually 
have lists of attorneys who market themselves as estate 
planners.
 
✓ Estate planning Web sites: Several sites are available. As we 
note in the previous section, we recommend www.nolo.com.
 
✓ Professional organizations of estate planners: One example 
is the National Association of Estate Planners and Councils 
(www.naepc.org). You also can type “estate planning pro-
fessional organizations” into your favorite search engine for 
other options.
 
✓ Other resources: Any trade, business, or professional associa-
tions you belong to may have lists of attorneys who specialize 
in working with people in your business or profession.
 
✓ Referrals: The best way to find a good, affordable estate plan-
ner is through a referral or recommendation from someone 
you know and respect. Ask friends and colleagues if they have 
estate plans. If they do, ask the following questions:
 
• Which attorney did you use?
 
• Were you satisfied?
 
• Would you use the attorney again?
 
• Could you understand the attorney and his 
recommendations?
 
• How much did it cost?
 
• Do you recommend the person?
 
✓ Other financial professionals you work with: Tax advisors, 
insurance agents, investment professionals, and financial plan-
ners usually maintain active referral networks of estate planners.
 
 Be cautious with these professional referrals. Some profes-
sionals refer others based primarily on the amount of referrals 
they receive in return. Of course, this referral criterion doesn’t 
interest you or help you.

324
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers  
 
 Often other professionals can tell whether someone has good 
technical knowledge and skill in estate planning. But they can’t 
know how well the estate planner works with clients. An attor-
ney may be able to communicate well with other professionals 
who know the basic language and concepts of estate planning. 
But the estate planner may not communicate these ideas well 
to those outside the field. As a result, he may not be able to 
explain the estate plan well.
Selecting an expert
When you’re ready to choose an expert, prepare to have introduc-
tory meetings with several estate planners before choosing one. 
Most estate planners offer a free or low-cost introductory meeting.
As you meet, keep in mind that estate planning isn’t a one-time 
event; you want to develop a continuing, long-term relationship 
with the person you choose. You should review the plan with your 
estate attorney every few years and adjust it for any changes in 
your family situation, your goals, your finances, and the law. Invest 
some time early to select an estate planner who’s a good fit for you 
and can result in a long-term relationship.
 
Here are the most important factors when choosing an estate 
planner:
 
✓ The planner must communicate well with you, and you must 
be comfortable with the planner. Communication and com-
fort are important because you must be open with the planner 
about your financial situation, your family, and your goals. 
You’ll be revealing information and thoughts that are shared 
with few others (or maybe with no one else).
 
✓ The planner must be technically competent and up to date. 
It will be tough for you as a layman to assess this. That’s one 
reason it’s good to get referrals from other professionals or 
satisfied clients.
 
✓ The attorney must be able to explain legal and technical 
issues in terms you can understand. When an attorney is 
unable or unwilling to discuss planning options in layman’s 
terms, look for another planner who meets your needs.

R
egardless of the value of an estate, every estate plan needs 
a few key documents. The will, of course, is a key part of the 
plan. But you may need other documents to complete your plan, 
including a financial power of attorney, a living will, beneficiary 
designations, and more. We discuss the essential documents in 
this chapter.
Writing Your Will
A will is the most important document you need in your estate 
plan because it states who will inherit your assets. Without a will, 
state law determines the inheritance, which may not be what you 
want. Most states give one-third to two-thirds of the estate to 
the surviving spouse. The rest goes to any children of the estate 
owner (known as a testator). A will also is your opportunity to 
decide a number of other issues, such as who will be the guard-
ian of any minor children, who’s responsible for paying taxes, and 
other topics we discuss in this chapter.

326
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
You may not think you really need a will. We beg to differ. You need 
a will. You need a will even when your estate is small. You need a 
will even when your assets are held in a living trust or in joint ten-
ancy. You need a will to protect your assets and your loved ones.
 
Before you actually create a will, make sure you gather the informa-
tion you need. Hold off on using lawyers, Web sites, and any other 
technical stuff for the time being. Instead, consider the questions 
we pose in Chapter 13 and then write the answers in your own 
words. State who you want to inherit the property, any order of the 
inheritance (spouse first, children second), who will be the executor 
(the person who administers the estate and takes it through the 
probate process), and so on. After you answer the questions and 
get an idea of what you want your will to look like, you can then 
take the statement to a lawyer, fill in any details, and have the 
lawyer put your language into an actual will. Taking these steps first 
is likely to save you time and money. It’ll also be more likely that 
the final plan meets your goals, because you’ll have put the plan in 
your own words before it was transferred to the legal documents.
 
A will isn’t set in stone. You can change it as needed, so don’t avoid 
making a will just because you haven’t decided certain issues. If 
you’re not sure about a few details, have a basic will prepared now 
and then change it as needed.
Pointing out some important details
Your main objective when writing a will is to state who will inherit 
your property. However, you also need to consider other impor-
tant points that affect you and your loved ones. You should have a 
good grasp of the issues in the following sections.
Limiting specific-dollar bequests
When you plan your will, we suggest you avoid or limit specific-
dollar bequests and instead designate percentages. (A bequest is 
a disposition of property in your will. When your will says your 
spouse inherits the entire estate, that’s a bequest.) Otherwise, 
because of shifting market values, your spouse or other residu-
ary beneficiary (the person who inherits everything left after the 

327
 Chapter 14: Eyeing Wills and Other Legal Documents
specific bequests have been distributed) will inherit less than 
you intended both in dollars and as a percentage of the estate. If 
you do make specific bequests, be sure the language adjusts the 
bequests with changes in the value of the estate.
As an example, consider an estate that has a $500,000 portfolio in 
addition to the principal residence. The will leaves $50,000 to a 
favorite charity of the owner, $50,000 spread among other benefi-
ciaries in relatively small amounts, and the home and remaining 
$400,000 to the spouse. Suppose the portfolio is invested primarily 
in stocks or stock-based mutual funds, and the market is in a steep 
decline while the estate is being settled. After a 25 percent decline, 
the portfolio is worth only $375,000. The charity and other beneficia-
ries still get a total of $100,000 because the will gave them specific 
bequests; those are distributed first. The spouse inherits the home 
and the residuary estate (the amount left over after specific bequests 
are made), which is only $275,000. The spouse inherits far less than 
intended as both a dollar amount and a percentage of the estate.
A better approach is to limit specific-dollar bequests or qualify 
them with a formula. The bequest to the charity could be stated as 
the lower of $50,000 or 10 percent of the estate, excluding the resi-
dence. It may be further qualified to say that the charity receives 
nothing if the estate’s value sinks below a stated level. The 
bequests to other beneficiaries could be rewritten the same way.
 
To successfully limit specific-dollar amounts, stick to these simple 
steps:
 
1. Decide how to divide your estate as it exists today.
 
2. Consider how the estate may change because of fluctuations 
in the value of its assets.
 
 Look at the types of assets in your estate. Consider how much 
their values could change (either up or down) over the years 
between your estate plan revisions. You could take a look at 
how the prices of those assets have changed over the past few 
decades. How would you alter the distribution of the estate in 
the new circumstances?
 
 For example, suppose you have three children and designate 
each of them to inherit separate assets that are currently 
worth about the same amount. But the relative values of those 

328
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
assets are likely to change over time. If your will is unchanged 
for ten years or the markets are volatile, the relative value of 
the bequests to the children are unlikely to be equal or near 
what you intended.
 
3. Work with an attorney to modify the language of the 
bequests to fit these changes.
 
 In most cases you want to use formulas instead of simply 
naming specific amounts or assets to be inherited. Otherwise, 
the alternative is to revise the will each time one or more 
assets has a significant change in value.
Determining who pays taxes
Your estate could face federal estate taxes and state inheritance or 
estate taxes on the value of its assets as well as both federal and 
state income taxes on income it earns. Someone has to pay these 
taxes, so your will should have a tax apportionment clause that 
specifies who pays the taxes.
 
When the will is silent on the issue, usually the residuary estate (the 
amount left over after specific bequests are made) pays the taxes. 
Usually the residuary estate goes to the spouse (or to the children if 
there is no spouse). So when the residuary estate pays all the taxes, 
your main beneficiary could inherit less than you intended.
 
An alternative is to have a tax apportionment clause that states that 
a bequest will pay all the allocable taxes. For example, if you leave 
$5,000 to a nonfamily member and provide that each bequest pays 
its own share of the taxes, that person will inherit less than $5,000. 
The executor will deduct the taxes before making the distribution. 
Discuss a tax apportionment clause with your attorney to protect 
your loved ones.
Deciding who pays the debts
As with taxes, your debts must be paid by the estate before the 
executor is allowed to distribute the assets. For many estates these 
days, paying debts is a bigger issue than paying taxes (see the pre-
ceding section). You can allocate the debt payments however you 

329
 Chapter 14: Eyeing Wills and Other Legal Documents
want in your will; just don’t forget to consider the issue and make 
a decision. Otherwise, some of your beneficiaries may receive less 
than you intended.
Avoiding multiple estate fees
The estate settlement process costs money. There are attorney’s 
fees, probate court costs, taxes, and sometimes other costs. 
Married couples have the risk of incurring these costs twice if 
spouses pass away in a short span.
However, you can avoid these duplicate fees. If you’re married, 
you need to include the simultaneous death clause in your will. 
The simultaneous death clause states that if spouses die within a 
certain time of each other, each will be treated as having prede-
ceased the other. The clause is a bit technical, but including it is 
important to reducing costs and taxes in those rare cases when 
spouses die within a short time of each other.
 
You can set the time period in the simultaneous death clause. 
Couples frequently use 90 days as the time period in their clause. 
In this case, the clause would state that if you and your spouse die 
within 90 days of each other, you’ll be treated as predeceasing 
each other.
Here’s what could happen without the simultaneous death clause: 
Suppose a husband dies, and a few weeks later his wife dies. 
Without the clause, most states assume each spouse survived 
the other. Each spouse would inherit the other spouse’s assets as 
directed by their wills. That means at least some assets go through 
the probate process twice before being distributed to heirs. The 
result is higher costs, perhaps higher taxes, and a delay in the 
final settlement of the estates. (Refer to the later section “Looking 
Closer at Probate” for more on the probate process.)
Dividing personal property
One of the more difficult tasks in some families is dividing the 
personal property and mementoes. Often one or more family mem-
bers have emotional attachments to some of the items that aren’t 
related to the financial values of the items. Personal items are 

330
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
at least as likely as major assets to cause hurt families and even 
estate disputes. So you need to consider whether any personal 
items will have such an effect on your family and, if so, develop a 
plan to avoid problems.
 
You can take some actions that may eliminate difficulties over the 
distribution of personal property. Select from the following list the 
method, or combination of methods, you think will work best for 
your family:
 
✓ Require the executor to sell or give to charity all personal 
items. Doing so avoids distribution of the items, but it also 
means no one in the family gets them — unless they are able 
to buy the items.
 
✓ Have family members select the items they want to inherit 
later. This can be done by attaching labels with their names 
somewhere on the items, such as on the backs of artwork or 
the bottoms of furniture.
 
✓ Have family members work out a method for distributing 
the items when the estate is being settled. This is what most 
people do, and it leads to disputes when the family can’t agree.
 
✓ Let the executor decide. For this to work, the executor must 
be someone who isn’t part of the family but who knows the 
family or has a sense of fairness and is trusted by the family 
members. This approach rarely works.
 
✓ As part of your estate plan, include a letter to your execu-
tor directing how specific items of personal property are to 
be distributed. This may not completely solve the problem, 
because you’re unlikely to cover all the items. In addition, you 
have to update the letter as you add and subtract items from 
your ownership or change who should receive an item.
 
✓ Set up a lottery system. You can choose from many possible 
lottery systems, which are limited only by your imagination. 
One example is to have each family member select a number 
from a hat. In the first round, each family member selects an 
item in the order of their numbers. In the second round, the 
selection order is reversed. For the third round, return to the 
original order.

Facing the limits of wills
While a will is a potentially powerful document, there are limits to 
what you can do through one. In this section, we look at the major 
limits of wills and help you consider other ways to meet your 
objectives.
 
The following are outside the reach and control of your will:
 
✓ The ownership of jointly-held property: The disposition of 
some assets is controlled by law. When you own property with 
someone as joint owners with right of survivorship, for exam-
ple, your will has no role in what happens to that property. 
State law dictates that the joint owner automatically receives 
your share of the property upon your death.
 
✓ Assets controlled by other documents: These include retire-
ment plans, annuities, and life insurance. The beneficiary des-
ignation form for each of these assets determines who inherits 
them or benefits from them. We discuss the beneficiary desig-
nation for qualified retirement plans, such as IRAs and 401(k)s, 
later in this chapter.
 
✓ Assets in a trust: A will doesn’t influence these assets unless 
the trust agreement specifically gives you the power to change 
the terms of the trust through your will or some other means. 
If you set up a living trust to avoid probate (something we dis-
cuss later in this chapter), the terms of that trust determine 
who receives ownership of the assets.
 
✓ Your funeral and memorial arrangements or the disposition 
of your body: In most states a will doesn’t control decisions 
about arrangements after you die. You can make suggestions 
in either the will or a separate document, but generally the 
final decisions are up to others.
Excluding family members
You may want to exclude a natural object of your affection from 
your will. That person could be a child or even your spouse. 

332
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
(However, keep in mind that a spouse can’t be disinherited in 
most states, absent a premarital or postmarital agreement; see 
Chapter 13.) Children, both natural and adopted, and anyone else 
can be disinherited.
Yet, there are right ways and wrong ways to disinherit a person if 
you want to limit problems and fallout. To effectively disinherit a 
child, for example, you should state the child’s name and that you 
specifically intended not to leave him or her anything. You don’t 
have to give a reason, but you can if you want.
 
Here are a few things to remember if you’re disinheriting someone 
in your will:
 
✓ You shouldn’t disinherit a child by simply not mentioning 
him or her in the will. In this case, the child could argue that 
you or the lawyer made a mistake and that the child was sup-
posed to receive an equal share with the others.
 
✓ You can’t prevent a disinherited child from suing the estate, 
but you can limit the potential for a suit through an in terro-
rem clause. With this clause, you don’t completely disinherit 
the child. You leave him or her an amount that you think will 
matter but that’s much less than a full share of the estate. The 
in terrorem clause, which is permitted in most states, holds that 
if any beneficiary unsuccessfully sues the estate they lose what-
ever inheritance they were scheduled to receive in the will.
Avoiding things you can’t 
do with your will
The general rule about wills is that you can do anything that isn’t 
“against public policy,” no matter how unwise or crazy it may 
seem to others. In most states, the only restrictions that are clearly 
against public policy are those that are racially discriminatory.
So, you can make gifts contingent on the beneficiary’s being mar-
ried, staying married, or being employed. Occasionally someone 
writes a will requiring a beneficiary to belong to a certain club or 
organization or to go to church regularly if they want to receive or 

333
 Chapter 14: Eyeing Wills and Other Legal Documents
retain their inheritances. While these restrictions are for the most 
part legal, in Chapter 13 we discuss the pros and cons of putting 
such limitations in estate plans.
 
As a practical matter, the provisions generally are enforced initially 
by your executor. He can liberally construe terms or simply ignore 
them. The probate court judge is the ultimate enforcer but is 
unlikely to disagree with the executor unless a beneficiary to the 
will sues. In a few rare cases, a state attorney general may get 
involved if a will term is particularly disagreeable.
Assigning a Financial 
Power of Attorney
One of the most important documents in a good estate plan (other 
than a will, which we discuss in the preceding section) is the finan-
cial power of attorney (POA). This document designates someone 
(or several people) to take financial actions when you are unable. 
They can pay bills, change investments, and make other necessary 
moves. They even can make estate planning gifts, if you provide 
that in the document.
 
Unlike the will, the financial power of attorney takes effect while 
you’re alive but unable to act because of a temporary or permanent 
disability.
The POA is a document we hope you don’t ever need, but like 
insurance, you need to prepare it ahead of time to ensure you have 
it if you ever need to use it. The following sections look at why you 
need a POA and how you can choose the one that’s right for you.
Recognizing the importance 
of a POA
Without the POA (or a living trust, which we discuss later in this 
chapter), your finances can’t be managed without your approval. 
Any property solely in your name, including your business, legally 

334
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
can’t be sold or managed by anyone else. Bills can’t be paid, and 
your portfolio can’t be managed. Loans can’t be taken out against 
your assets.
 
Joint ownership eliminates some, but not all, of these problems. 
With joint ownership of a checking account, the joint owner usu-
ally can write checks to pay bills. But joint owners of property 
generally can’t sell assets or borrow against them, though the 
rules vary from state to state and also can be altered by a joint 
ownership agreement.
To manage your financial affairs when you’re unable to and don’t 
have a POA, your family must go to court and obtain an order stat-
ing that you’re not competent to manage your affairs. This process 
takes time and money and can be very unpleasant for all involved. 
In addition, by drafting a POA, you determine who manages your 
finances. Without it, a court decides, and the person appointed 
may not be the one you would prefer to handle your financial 
affairs.
The person named in the POA to act on your behalf is known as 
an agent or an attorney in fact. This person legally may do in your 
name anything you can do. If you sign an unlimited power of attor-
ney, the agent has authority to act in your name in all matters. 
Under a limited power of attorney, the agent has the power to act 
only on matters that you specify. You may revoke a POA any time 
you have legal capacity (such as when you aren’t considered inca-
pacitated).
 
Whether you choose an unlimited or a limited POA, you also want 
to sign a durable power of attorney. Under the durable POA, the doc-
ument remains in effect even after you’re incapacitated. A POA, on 
the other hand, is canceled when you’re unable to handle your own 
affairs. A potential drawback to the durable POA is that it’s valid as 
soon as you sign it — even though you aren’t incapacitated. It’s 
possible that an attorney-in-fact who isn’t trustworthy could take 
actions at any time.
Some states recognize the springing power of attorney. Under 
the springing POA, the agent has power only after a disability 
occurs. A disadvantage to the springing power of attorney is that 

335
 Chapter 14: Eyeing Wills and Other Legal Documents
it must have a definition of disability and a process for having 
you declared incapacitated. These requirements could make the 
document less effective than the durable POA, and disagreements 
could lead to the same court action that the power of attorney was 
partly created to avoid. In addition, only a few states recognize it.
Choosing the right POA
Of course you want to carefully select your attorney in fact. 
Naming a spouse or adult child as the agent is tempting — and it 
may work well in many cases — but it can be risky if those folks 
don’t have the same ideas about things as you do or aren’t capable 
of managing your assets effectively.
Consider situations when more than bill paying is required. For 
example, if the stock market experiences a sharp decline while 
you’re incapacitated, do you want someone who’s going to panic 
and sell all your depressed investments or do you want someone 
who will adhere to your long-term plan? Choose someone who can 
judge when to change a long-term plan and when to stick with it.
In selecting a POA, you want someone who’s trusted and reliable. 
You also want someone who’s likely to be around and have the 
time to take on the position when needed. The person should 
understand your views and philosophy on managing your finances 
and have good judgment on financial matters. You may have a 
simple estate and require someone who’s simply organized and 
reliable to pay bills. Or you may have a complicated estate and 
need someone who’s fairly sophisticated or at least wise enough to 
consult with your advisors and make good decisions.
 
Be sure to name at least one alternate attorney in fact, because 
something could happen to the original designee. You can even 
name more than one attorney in fact and require them to act 
jointly. Doing so protects against both fraud and bad judgment. It 
also means they have to be located near each other and meet regu-
larly. These requirements could impede decision making.
After you select your POA, you’ll likely have to prepare and sign 
many documents. Consider the following:

336
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
 
✓ Most financial services companies have their own forms and 
will accept only their forms when someone asserts a power 
of attorney. They also want copies of the form on file before 
you’re disabled.
 
✓ When you live in more than one state, you may need to pro-
vide a different document for each state.
 
Review the POA as part of your regular estate plan review. Consider 
whether the attorney in fact is still the best choice, and review the 
scope of the powers. When you open new financial accounts, be 
sure the account custodians have copies of a POA they will accept.
Delegating Medical Decisions
Most of your estate plan concerns money, property, and other 
financial issues. But it’s generally accepted that a complete estate 
plan should have at least one nonfinancial document. You should 
have a financial power of attorney empowering someone to 
manage your finances when you can’t. But, you also need one or 
more documents to cover decisions about your medical care when 
you’re unable to make such decisions.
An essential document is the medical care directive. When creat-
ing this document, make sure you prepare multiple versions if you 
travel regularly to other states. You want to make sure the docu-
ments are enforceable in those states as well as in your home state.
Several different types of medical directive documents are avail-
able. You need to understand their differences and decide which 
are right for you. That’s where this section comes into play.
 
A good estate planning attorney will include these in your plan. 
Software that helps prepare wills usually has these documents, too. 
Many states have official versions authorized by law and have 
sample versions available on their Web sites, usually under the 
Department of Health or a similar agency. You also can locate the 
forms through www.caringinfo.com. Other documents are avail-
able at www.agingwithdignity.org. We don’t endorse all the 

337
 Chapter 14: Eyeing Wills and Other Legal Documents
statements and philosophy on these sites. We refer to them only as 
places to find sample documents. As always, you’ll find many 
nuances in these documents, so it’s safest to have an estate plan-
ning attorney prepare them.
Understanding living wills
The living will is the best-known medical directive document. This 
type of will states that in certain circumstances you want or don’t 
want certain types of care. The most basic living will states:
“If I have a terminal condition, and there is no hope of recov-
ery, I do not want my life prolonged by artificial means.”
Some living wills span many pages, prescribing the treatment 
to use or not use in different situations. Creating a living will is 
simple. Most states recognize living wills and even have autho-
rized sample forms available on their Web sites.
 
Despite its popularity, the living will has some important disadvan-
tages you need to be aware of:
 
✓ Applying the living will’s simple principles can be difficult 
in real-world situations. Medical professionals, for example, 
may disagree over whether you have hope of improvement. 
But even when the experts agree, your family members may 
disagree. If a person’s living will prohibits artificial means of 
life support, there may be disagreement over whether main-
tenance care (such as feeding and hydration tubes) is consid-
ered artificial life support.
 
✓ Adding specific details to a custom living will doesn’t elimi-
nate all problems. Even detailed documents can’t cover all 
possible scenarios, leaving decision-makers uncertain of 
what to do. Also, technology and medical knowledge change. 
Conditions that couldn’t be treated a few years ago can be 
treated now. Also, people may disagree over the facts, such 
as the diagnosis, probability of improvement, and whether a 
person is in a vegetative state.

338
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
 
✓ Perhaps most important, in many cases, living wills simply 
aren’t effective. Studies reveal that medical professionals 
often don’t see the documents until after treatment decisions 
are made. Some ignore the documents, because they fear sur-
viving family members will sue for failure to treat. In addition, 
a doctor can interpret a document to approve treatment in a 
circumstance when others interpret it to withhold treatment. 
Even when a doctor believes the living will prescribes non-
treatment in a situation, treatment still is likely to be given if 
one or more key family members request it.
 
Some people disparage living wills because of these drawbacks. 
Others say these disadvantages are relatively rare occurrences. 
Because of the uneven performance of living wills, we suggest you 
not rely solely on them. Instead, your estate plan should include 
more than one medical care document. We discuss additional docu-
ments to consider in the following sections. Some estate planning 
attorneys prepare all these documents as part of their clients’ plans.
Signing DNRs
A simple document called the do not resuscitate (DNR) or do not 
hospitalize (DNH) order can be helpful for delegating medical deci-
sions. DNR and DNH orders state that the person isn’t to be resus-
citated (such as by using CPR) or hospitalized. These documents 
are becoming common among much older people who are frail, 
especially those in nursing homes.
Some people sign these documents because they believe addi-
tional treatment for new ailments or developments won’t prolong 
their lives or improve their quality of life. They decline CPR or 
hospitalization (or both) in advance, instead opting to be kept 
comfortable in their residences. Advocates of the orders say 
CPR rarely helps these individuals recover and often makes their 
deaths violent and painful.
 
DNR and DNH documents need to be kept in your medical chart 
with each of your care providers, and any medical personnel who 
treat you regularly should be made aware of them.

339
 Chapter 14: Eyeing Wills and Other Legal Documents
Assigning a health 
care proxy or POA
The health care proxy or health care power of attorney document 
appoints one or more people to make medical decisions when 
you’re unable. Most states recognize this document, which is simi-
lar to the financial power of attorney. The health care POA should 
be in every estate plan.
With the health care POA, the agents discuss your situation with 
your medical providers and make a treatment decision. You may 
use the other medical care directive documents in this chapter as 
statements of your wishes to guide the decision-makers. (In the 
living will and DNR/DNH orders, you state the care you want or 
don’t want in certain situations. With those documents, you try to 
make decisions in advance, though you won’t know what all the 
facts and circumstances will be.)
 
Naming more than one proxy or agent may be a good idea because 
it takes some of the responsibility off one person and may ensure a 
more complete consideration of all the factors. When more than 
one person is appointed, you may want to require that all agree 
before treatment can be withheld or given. Some people appoint 
only family members; others believe at least one proxy should be a 
person who knows the family but isn’t a part of it.
 
The people you appoint as health care POAs must be likely to be 
available when medical decisions are needed. Someone who 
doesn’t live nearby, travels a lot, or generally isn’t easy to get in 
touch with may not be a good choice.
Authorizing HIPAA
In recent years the HIPAA authorization document was added to 
the estate planning package. This document authorizes medical 
providers to release information to the named persons without 
violating the privacy provisions of the Health Insurance Portability 

340
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
and Accountability Act of 1996. Without this document, medical 
professionals won’t generally share information about your medi-
cal situation even with your family members or holders of POAs.
Combining documents
One estate planning innovation is to combine all the medical care 
directive documents discussed in this chapter into one called an 
advanced health care directive.
In addition to combining the living will and health care power of 
attorney, the directive can include more detailed explanations 
of your philosophy and preferences in different situations. The 
document also can include information such as how you want to 
be made comfortable and be treated as well as other nonmedi-
cal decisions. Some directives even have instructions regarding 
music, grooming, fresh flowers, and other aspects of your environ-
ment while receiving care.
 
Sample all-in-one documents are available, as a package titled Five 
Wishes, from Aging with Dignity (www.agingwithdignity.org; 
888-5-WISHES). The organization charges modest fees for the docu-
ments and has versions for most states.
Passing Other Assets
Your will doesn’t control how every asset you own is distributed 
(as we discuss earlier in the “Facing the limits of wills” section). As 
a result, ensuring that you address these assets in your estate plan 
and naming beneficiaries is important to make sure that the correct 
people receive the correct assets. A number of key assets are dis-
tributed by law or contract. The most common of these assets are
 
✓ Qualified retirement plans, such as IRAs, 401(k)s, and other 
employer pension plans
 
✓ Annuities
 
✓ Life insurance

341
 Chapter 14: Eyeing Wills and Other Legal Documents
In the following sections, we explain how to name beneficiaries for 
each of these assets. We also explain the particulars about passing 
IRAs, which have their own special rules, to your heirs.
Naming beneficiaries 
for your assets
The process for naming a beneficiary for assets such as retire-
ment plans and annuities is simple. Usually the initial contract or 
account opening form has a space for listing beneficiaries. Be sure 
to name at least one beneficiary. Contingent or secondary benefi-
ciaries, who would receive the asset in the event the primary ben-
eficiary died, should also be named. When a change is needed or 
desired, you’ll likely have to complete a second form naming the 
new beneficiary.
 
Keep track of your assets that require beneficiary designations on 
their own forms instead of in your will. Review the beneficiary des-
ignations as part of your regular estate plan reviews and change 
them as needed. Keep a copy of each beneficiary designation form, 
and be sure your executor knows where to find the forms.
Examining the special case of IRAs
The beneficiary designation of IRAs is especially important to 
your estate planning. The choice you make, or fail to make, greatly 
affects the tax treatment of the IRAs after your death. We explain 
everything you need to know about dealing with IRAs in the follow-
ing sections.
Taking a look at the basics of IRA inheritances
When an individual inherits your IRA, distributions from the IRA 
are included in gross income and are taxed as ordinary income 
just as they would be during your lifetime. The beneficiaries keep 
only the after-tax amount of the IRA. (When non-IRA assets are 
inherited, their tax basis is increased to their current fair market 

342
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
value. The heirs can then sell them at current value and not owe 
capital gains taxes on any appreciation that occurred during your 
lifetime. As a result, they benefit from the full value of the assets.)
 
If you don’t name an individual as the beneficiary of your IRA (or 
other qualified retirement plan), your estate is the beneficiary. With 
non-IRA assets, you rarely experience tax consequences because of 
this. However, with an IRA, the tax deferral available to the next 
generation of owners is cut short. When the estate is the benefi-
ciary, the IRA must be distributed in full no later than the fifth year 
after the year of the owner’s death. The distributions are included 
in gross income of either the estate or a beneficiary of the estate.
The tax results are different when the beneficiary is one or more 
individuals instead of the estate. In this case, the beneficiary has 
choices. That person can take distributions of the entire IRA within 
five years of the owner’s death or even right away. Or she can take 
advantage of the IRA’s tax deferral by spreading annual distribu-
tions over her life expectancy (or the life expectancy of the oldest 
beneficiary if the owner named more than one beneficiary). Life 
expectancy tables issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are 
used to determine the life expectancy. Another option when an 
owner named more than one beneficiary is to split the IRA into a 
separate IRA for each beneficiary. Each beneficiary then sets the 
distribution schedule using her own life expectancy.
 
Don’t name a trust as the beneficiary of an IRA without the help of 
an experienced estate planning attorney. The trust must have spe-
cific language to minimize taxes and take advantage of the IRA’s tax 
deferral. In most cases, a natural person must be named beneficiary 
to avoid losing the tax deferral.
Using your IRA to make charitable gifts
When charitable gifts are part of your estate plan, consider using 
your IRA to make those gifts. Doing so allows your charities (and 
heirs) to have more after-tax money than if the contributions were 
made through non-IRA assets. All you do is name a charity as the 
beneficiary for all or part of the IRA.

343
 Chapter 14: Eyeing Wills and Other Legal Documents
So what exactly happens when you make charitable gifts through 
your IRA? When a charity is named beneficiary of an IRA, the 
charity takes a distribution of the IRA. As a tax-exempt entity, it 
owes no income taxes. The distribution isn’t included in the gross 
income of your estate or any of its beneficiaries. The charity ben-
efits from the full value of the IRA. In addition, the portion of the 
IRA inherited by the charity qualifies for a charitable contribution 
deduction under the estate tax.
On the other hand, when an individual is the beneficiary of an IRA, 
all distributions from the IRA are included in the individual’s gross 
income and taxed at ordinary income tax rates. The beneficiary 
really only inherits the after-tax value of the IRA. The IRS “inherits” 
the rest. When other assets are available in the estate, it’s better to 
make charitable gifts through the IRA and let noncharities inherit 
other assets.
Filling out IRA custom beneficiary forms
When you name one or two beneficiaries and plan to have co-
beneficiaries share equally in the IRA, the beneficiary designation 
form provided by the IRA custodian is adequate. In other cases, 
however, you may want an estate planner to draft a customized 
beneficiary form.
 
A custom form is a good idea when you name more than one 
beneficiary — especially if you don’t want them to share equally in 
the IRA. You also may want to use a custom form when you name 
contingent beneficiaries (individuals who receive assets when the 
primary beneficiary dies). Contingent beneficiaries are a good idea, 
because you never know when something may happen to your pri-
mary beneficiary. Contingent beneficiaries also can be part of a 
sophisticated planning strategy in which the primary beneficiaries 
refuse, or disclaim, their inheritances and allow others to inherit it. 
This allows younger generations to continue the tax deferral of the 
IRA and makes the IRA last longer.
 
A custom beneficiary form requires more work and expense. Your 
estate planner must draft it and submit it to the IRA custodian for 
approval. It may go through a few drafts before it’s acceptable to 
the custodian. But if you want to do something special with your 

344
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
IRA (such as provide for more than a couple of beneficiaries or in 
unequal shares), and it’s large enough to be worth the expense (at 
least a couple hundred thousand dollars), a custom beneficiary 
form is a good idea.
Looking Closer at Probate
Probate is a process that each state sets up for estates. Probate 
establishes and clears title to assets, makes sure creditors are 
paid, and transfers assets to beneficiaries according to the terms 
of the will or state law. Your estate executor or an attorney hired 
by your executor does most of the work during probate. The pro-
bate court oversees the process and must approve everything 
before payments are made or assets are distributed.
A person’s probate estate includes only assets whose ownership 
can be transferred by the probate court. It doesn’t include assets 
that change owners by operation of law or contract. Assets not 
included in the probate estate include life insurance, annuities, 
property held jointly with right of survivorship, and qualified 
retirement plans, such as IRAs and 401(k)s. These assets generally 
are included in your gross estate for federal estate tax purposes 
but not in the probate estate. (We talk more about life insurance, 
retirement plan, and annuity inheritances in the earlier section 
“Passing Other Assets.”)
The following sections examine whether avoiding probate is right 
for you, and, if so, what you can do to avoid it.
Avoiding probate: Yeah or nay?
During probate the executor files the will and other documents 
with the court. These documents become a public record unless 
the court orders them to be sealed, which is rare. Besides put-
ting your information out there for everyone to see, probate also 
can be expensive and time consuming. Because of the cost, time, 
and public nature of probate, a goal of your estate plan may be to 
avoid probate for most of your assets.

345
 Chapter 14: Eyeing Wills and Other Legal Documents
 
You need to carefully decide whether you want to avoid probate. 
Discuss your state’s probate process with your estate planner. You 
want to know whether your state adopted the modern, streamlined 
probate code or still has the old process.
The good news is that many states established a streamlined pro-
bate process in recent decades, at least for estates that aren’t large. 
Probate with the new process costs far less and is much faster than 
under the traditional process. If you live in a state with a stream-
lined, low-cost estate process, you may decide that having the 
estate go through probate is better than dealing with a living trust 
or the other methods of avoiding probate we discuss in this section.
Other states, however, retain the old system. Probate in these 
states is expensive, and even simple estates can be tied up in the 
process for more than a year. If you live in one of these states, 
avoiding probate is a great gift to your heirs and will save a mean-
ingful part of your estate.
In the remaining two sections we look at the different ways of 
avoiding probate.
Considering joint tenancy
Joint ownership with right of survivorship is the simplest and oldest 
form of estate planning. Lawyers often call it a “will substitute” and 
“the poor man’s will.” Assets avoid probate if ownership is “joint 
tenancy with right of survivorship” or “tenancy by the entirety.” 
When one co-owner dies, the other automatically takes full title 
under the law. Probate isn’t required to establish legal title. (Only a 
few states recognize “tenancy in the entirety.”) These forms of own-
ership also provide some protection of the assets from creditors.
Joint tenancy is simple. Each state has “magic words” required 
in the deed or other title document. Usually the owners must be 
listed along the lines of “John Smith and Jane Smith, as joint ten-
ants with right of survivorship.” Usually a deed can be filed listing 
the survivor as sole owner by bringing it and a death certificate to 
the courthouse.

346
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
 
Some assets — such as checking accounts, small savings accounts, 
and the principal residence — can be held jointly by spouses, but 
often it’s best for other assets to be owned separately.
 
You probably shouldn’t use joint tenancy to avoid probate with 
most of your assets. Your spouse or other joint tenant automati-
cally gets full title to the property after your death. That prevents 
you from passing the assets to your children or other beneficiaries; 
it also stops you from using part of the lifetime estate tax exemp-
tion (see Chapter 13). Aggressive use of joint tenancy could waste 
your entire lifetime exemption and leave the entire estate in your 
spouse’s estate, where only one lifetime exemption can be used.
Joint tenancy also limits what you can do with the property during 
your lifetime, such as the following:
 
✓ You can only make significant moves with the property 
with the consent of both owners. When the owners disagree, 
nothing can happen. As you can imagine, you can run into 
major problems if the co-owner becomes disabled or legally 
incompetent.
 
✓ You can’t change your mind about who inherits the prop-
erty once joint tenancy is established. After some years have 
passed and your estate changes, it may make more sense to 
name the children or someone else to inherit the property and 
let your spouse inherit other property. To do that, you first 
have to disentangle the joint title.
 
When the estate is large enough to be taxable, joint tenancy may 
increase taxes. One-half the value of property jointly-owned by a 
married couple is included in the estate of the first spouse to die. 
When the joint owner isn’t a spouse, the entire property is included 
in the estate of the first joint owner to die, unless the other owner 
can show she paid for her share.
Making use of living trusts
Today, the most frequent way to avoid probate is to use the living 
trust (also known as the revocable living trust or revocable inter 
vivos trust). The living trust is a trust you create, serve as initial 

347
 Chapter 14: Eyeing Wills and Other Legal Documents
trustee of, and are the beneficiary of. Married couples may have 
separate living trusts, or they can create one living trust in which 
they’re co-trustees and co-beneficiaries.
Your attorney should draft the trust agreement, spelling out the 
terms of the trust and naming the trustee and beneficiary. By estab-
lishing the trust, you’re considered its creator or grantor. You’re 
named (and perhaps also your spouse) as both trustee and benefi-
ciary. You then transfer ownership of your property to the trust.
 
One key term of the trust is that it’s revocable, which means you 
may change any of the trust terms and even may revoke the entire 
trust and have the assets returned to you.
The living trust has both pros and cons, which we discuss in the 
following sections.
The advantages to a living trust
Making a living trust part of your estate plan offers some impor-
tant benefits, including the following:
 
✓ You have no tax consequences with the living trust. When 
you’re both grantor and beneficiary, the IRS treats you as 
owner of the trust assets. You’re also treated as owner 
because the trust is revocable. Because you’re treated as the 
owner, all income, deductions, gains, and other tax attributes 
of the trust are passed through to you and included on your 
income tax return. All assets of the trust are considered yours 
and included in your gross estate on the income tax return.
 
✓ You don’t own the assets in the eyes of the probate court. 
The trust is the owner. The assets don’t go through probate 
and aren’t affected by your will. Instead, the terms of the trust 
decide who inherits the assets. You can put clauses in the 
trust that resemble will clauses in order to distribute property 
to your children and other heirs. Or in the trust agreement, 
you can name the heirs as successor beneficiaries of the trust.
 
✓ You gain some privacy from a living trust. The trust agree-
ment isn’t filed with the probate court or other court, so its 
terms aren’t part of the public record.

348
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
 
✓ You benefit from easier disability planning. You don’t need 
a financial power of attorney. Instead, the trust agreement has 
a clause naming a successor trustee who takes over automati-
cally if you become disabled. If you have a co-trustee, such as 
your spouse, you may not need a successor trustee to declare 
you disabled. Your co-trustee simply manages the trust assets 
as the trust agreement allows.
The downsides to a living trust
 
The living trust does have some disadvantages, including the 
following:
 
✓ For it to be effective, you must transfer the title to your 
assets to the trust. Many living trusts are ineffective because 
the grantors didn’t complete the transfer process. You must 
change the deed to your home and other real estate, the titles 
to your cars, and the names on all your financial accounts. Any 
asset you want covered by the living trust must be officially 
transferred to the trust.
 
✓ The living trust may make things more difficult on your 
heirs, at least initially. When you create a living trust, finan-
cial institutions often change the title of existing accounts 
to indicate ownership by the trust without much hassle. 
But when the successor trustee tries to begin managing the 
accounts, the institutions may require more documentation 
about the death of the original trustee and how the succes-
sor trustee was named. It may take a while to change trustees 
and begin transacting business. Your heirs may decide that 
probate would have been less of a hassle and time waster than 
the transition under a living trust.
 
✓ You still need a will when you have a living trust. You proba-
bly won’t be able to transfer title of all your assets to the trust. 
A will is needed as a backup to cover other assets and also to 
cover issues other than transferring ownership of assets.
To ensure that a living trust is properly executed and handled, 
make sure you consult an attorney.

H
aving too much money is a pleasant problem to have but 
nevertheless a problem. When you’ve been successful or 
fortunate and accumulated a valuable estate, a potentially large 
estate tax bill stands between your heirs and the wealth. And while 
most estates are exempt from the estate tax, taxes can take a big 
piece of those estates subject to the estate tax. At times, busi-
nesses, real estate, and other valuable assets are sold to pay taxes. 
Family fortunes have been dissipated by estate taxes.
Fortunately, the problem can be reduced and even solved. The 
estate tax sometimes is referred to as the voluntary tax, because it 
can be reduced or eliminated with proper advice and planning. Your 
estate, no matter how valuable, doesn’t have to pay a lot of estate 
taxes. In this chapter, we show you how the estate tax is calculated 
and how to estimate the potential tax burden on your estate. Then, 
we show you legal strategies for reducing or eliminating the tax.

350
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
Tax reduction used to be the focus of almost all estate planning. 
After the 2001 tax law changes, however, fewer and fewer estate 
owners need to worry about taxes. Those of you with more valu-
able estates, however, still need to make estate tax reduction a 
focus of your planning.
 
Congress let the estate tax expire at the end of 2009. As we write in 
early 2010, Congress is expected to reinstate the tax, so we’re going 
to assume an estate tax will be in effect when you read this book. 
Most likely, the 2009 estate tax laws will be made permanent. That 
means taxable estates of $3.5 million or less will be exempt from 
the tax, and the top estate tax rate will be 45 percent. It’s possible 
that a higher exemption of $5 million or more will be created, and 
the exemption will be indexed for inflation. The top estate tax rate 
also may be reduced to as low as 35 percent. To find out the latest 
on the estate tax, visit our Web sites at www.retirementwatch.com 
or www.erictyson.com.
Understanding the Estate Tax
Uncle Sam calculates your federal estate tax on the value of the 
assets you owned at your passing. In 2009, only taxable estates of 
$3.5 million or more paid estate tax. But don’t skip over this chapter 
because you believe that your estate isn’t that valuable. Because of 
the way the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) calculates your estate, you 
could be richer than you realize. This section gives you an overview 
of the federal estate tax, including how it’s calculated.
Examining how your estate 
tax is calculated
The best way to understand the estate tax and how to beat it is 
to simply dive in and examine how it’s calculated. Having a basic 
grasp of this calculation is important as you develop your estate 
plan to reduce estate taxes.

351
 Chapter 15: Tackling the Federal Estate Tax When You Have Too Much Money
 
The lifetime estate tax credit often confuses people. Everyone is 
entitled to a credit that reduces their estate tax bills dollar for 
dollar. In 2009 the credit was $1,455,800. The credit works differ-
ently than an exemption. Many people like to say estates worth up 
to $3.5 million are exempt from the tax. This statement isn’t techni-
cally precise. The first $3.5 million of property isn’t excluded from 
the gross estate. Instead, taxes are computed on your entire 
estate, and then the estate tax credit is subtracted from the tax 
bill. The credit effectively eliminates taxes on taxable estates up to 
$3.5 million. However, the tax tables and credits are applied after 
deductions from the estate are taken. Because these deductions 
are taken before the credit is applied, an estate worth more than 
$3.5 million can be tax free.
The following list shows how the IRS taxes your wealth, and it 
includes the steps that the executor (or the accountant he hires) 
works through in the estate tax return to derive the final estate 
tax bill. Note: You probably don’t need to know how to do all this 
math; your tax advisor or executor will handle this information, 
but having a basic knowledge of this tax is important because 
knowing how the tax is determined makes it easier to understand 
how to reduce it.
 
1. Begin with your gross estate.
 
 To do so, list all the assets you own and estimate their values. 
The total of the values is your gross estate (everything you own).
 
2. Subtract your deductions.
 
 The result after subtracting your deductions is your taxable 
estate. The deductions you may subtract include administra-
tive expenses, funeral expenses, losses, debts, charitable 
contributions, the marital deduction, and state inheritance or 
estate taxes.
 
3. Add the lifetime taxable gifts you made to the taxable estate.
 
 The estate and gift tax combined are what lawyers call a 
unified transfer tax on both lifetime and postmortem gifts. 

352
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
To make the taxes consistent, lifetime gifts that were large 
enough to be taxable are added back to your estate. The gift 
taxes you paid are subtracted later.
 
4. Look up the tax in the IRS estate tax table.
 
 Just as you use IRS income tax tables to find the income tax 
you owe each year, the IRS estate tax table is used to compute 
the estate tax. The tax table is in the instructions to Form 706, 
the estate tax return. The result of applying these tables is the 
tentative estate tax.
 
5. Subtract gift taxes paid during your lifetime. This again is 
part of the unified transfer tax. Earlier your lifetime taxable 
gifts were added to the estate. Now, the taxes paid on those 
gifts are subtracted. The result is your estate tax before credits.
 
6. Subtract your Unified Estate and Gift Tax Credit.
 
 Doing so effectively exempts an estate of up to $3.5 million 
from taxes. If you get a positive number after subtracting the 
estate and gift tax credit from your estate tax before credits, 
that number is your estate tax payable.
 
 You may wonder why lifetime taxable gifts are added to the 
estate’s value, and then the lifetime gift taxes paid are sub-
tracted from the tax due. You’re supposed to pay the same tax 
whether property is transferred during your life as a gift or 
afterward as a bequest. But some gifts may be made tax free 
with the annual gift tax exclusion (discussed in Chapter 13). 
Gifts that exceed the exemption amount may be tax free 
because of the lifetime gift tax credit, which essentially allows 
everyone to make $1 million of lifetime gifts tax free. To the 
extent the lifetime gift tax credit is used, the estate tax credit 
is reduced.
 
7. If applicable, add any generation skipping transfer tax to get 
the final amount due.
 
 The generation skipping transfer tax (GSTT) is an extra tax 
imposed on gifts or bequests directly from you to someone in 
a grandchild’s (or later) generation. The GSTT is a penalty for 
trying to avoid an estate tax on your children’s generation. We 
discuss this tax in more detail in the later section “Avoiding 
the Tax on Gifts to Grandkids: The GSTT.”

353
 Chapter 15: Tackling the Federal Estate Tax When You Have Too Much Money
Decreasing your estate taxes
After you understand how estate taxes are computed, you’re ready 
to see how to reduce these taxes. You can choose from the follow-
ing three basic strategies for dealing with estate taxes:
 
✓ Reduce the gross estate. An asset isn’t subject to the estate 
tax if it’s never included in your gross estate. That’s why life-
time gifts are an important part of most estate plans. But you 
must be careful to avoid paying gift taxes or inadvertently 
reducing your standard of living.
 
✓ Increase the estate’s deductions. The deductions with real 
planning possibilities are the marital deduction and chari-
table contribution deduction. Check out the section “Taking 
Deductions” later in this chapter for more information about 
these deductions.
 
✓ Buy life insurance. Don’t worry about the amount of estate 
taxes; worry about paying them. The most popular strategy for 
paying estate taxes without reducing the estate is to buy life 
insurance. Your loved ones inherit the assets in your estate while 
the life insurance benefits pay the taxes. This strategy frequently 
is used when an estate consists of valuable assets you don’t want 
heirs to have to sell, such as a family business or real estate.
We discuss using these strategies in more detail in this chapter in 
the section “Contemplating Life Insurance” and in Chapter 16.
Tallying Your Assets
Many people don’t plan their estates because they mistakenly 
think that estate taxes won’t affect them. They hear that estates up 
to $3.5 million are exempt from taxes and believe that means their 
estates won’t be taxed. However, you need to add all your assets 
together to ensure that you don’t own more than you think and get 
whacked by the estate tax. In the following sections, we help you 
keep the big picture in mind so you don’t forget any assets.

354
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
Making sure you don’t overlook 
certain factors
Oftentimes people mistakenly overlook two factors that can affect 
the size of their estate. Make sure these factors don’t come back 
and bite you:
 
✓ The way the tax law defines your gross estate: Many people 
own more than they realize — at least the IRS considers them 
to own more than they realize. We review the assets included 
in your gross estate (versus your probate estate) in the next 
section.
 
✓ The value of assets changes over time: You may be com-
fortably below the taxable estate tax amount now. Over the 
coming years, however, your assets could appreciate and 
your income could increase enough to make estate taxes an 
issue. The estate tax laws also can change over the years and 
decades. There have been plenty of changes, and it would be 
foolish to think the future will be any different!
 
Because of these factors, a number of people are what estate plan-
ners refer to as “modest millionaires.” They don’t think they’re rich, 
and they don’t live the lifestyles generally considered of those who 
are rich. But the tax code says they’re wealthy enough for their 
estates to be taxable.
Assessing included assets
The obvious items that are included in your gross estate include 
your home, any additional real estate, investment accounts, autos, 
home furnishings, art and collections, and any other assets you own.
 
However, you may own more assets under the estate tax code than 
you realize. That’s because your gross estate under the tax law is 
different from the probate estate. A number of assets that avoid 
probate are included in the gross estate and are potentially subject 
to taxes.

355
 Chapter 15: Tackling the Federal Estate Tax When You Have Too Much Money
Probate is a state process designed to clear title to property and 
transfer it to the owners designated by the deceased. (See Chapter 
14 for more information on probate.) The estate tax is designed to 
tax the transfer of any property you controlled or benefited from.
Your gross estate includes any property over which you had an 
incident of ownership on the date of your death. It’s a broad term 
with a broad definition. The result is that many people own “hidden 
assets” that are included in their gross estates. You know about 
the physical assets and investments you own. Those definitely are 
included in your gross estate. However, you also may own some of 
the following hidden assets that are included in your gross estate:
 
✓ Jointly-owned property: You may own property with your 
spouse or someone else as joint owners with right of survivor-
ship or tenants in the entirety. (See Chapter 14 for more details 
on these types of ownership.) These assets avoid probate but 
are included in your gross estate.
 
 Under the estate tax, one-half the value of property jointly 
owned by a married couple is included in the estate of the first 
spouse to die. When the joint owner isn’t a spouse, the entire 
property is included in the estate of the first joint owner to 
die — unless the other owner can show she paid for her share 
of the property. When the second joint owner dies, the prop-
erty is included in that estate when the person still owns it.
 
✓ Pensions and annuities: These assets also avoid probate but 
often are part of your gross estate. For example, the balances 
in IRAs, 401(k)s, and similar accounts are included. Any pen-
sion or insurance annuities that will continue payments to a 
beneficiary after your passing also are included. Some compli-
cated rules determine the value of the annuity for estate tax 
purposes, but it’s included in the estate.
 
✓ Revocable living trusts: These trusts are used to avoid pro-
bate for many assets (see Chapter 14). Avoiding estate taxes 
isn’t an advantage of these trusts, however. When you create a 
trust and can change most of its terms or are the beneficiary, 
all the trust assets are treated as yours for estate tax pur-
poses. To exclude assets in a trust from the gross estate, the 
trust must be irrevocable and you can’t retain an interest in it. 
We discuss this in more detail in Chapter 16.

356
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
 
✓ Life insurance: No income taxes are imposed on life insurance 
benefits, but they may be included in your gross estate. If you 
had any incidents of ownership over the policy during life, the 
policy benefits are part of the gross estate.
 
 Life insurance benefits are excluded from your gross estate 
when you don’t pass the ownership test. For example, you can 
put the insurance policy in an irrevocable trust, have it owned 
by family members, or transfer it to an entity such as a part-
nership that’s controlled by other family members. See 
Chapter 16 for more details.
 
✓ Power of appointment: You may be the beneficiary of a trust set 
up by you or someone else. You may have the right to decide 
who receives the property or income after you die by naming 
the beneficiary in your will or some other document. This right 
is known as a power of appointment, because you can appoint 
the next beneficiary. It isn’t unusual, for example, for a parent to 
put assets in a trust that pays benefits to an adult child for life. 
The adult child has the power to name the next beneficiary.
 
 Determining whether a particular power of appointment is 
included in your gross estate and calculating its value is tricky 
and technical. You need an estate planner’s advice.
 
✓ Incomplete gifts and revocable trusts: To exclude property 
from your gross estate, you need to give the entire legal right 
to the property and its income to the person who receives it. 
Gifts with some strings attached, such as the right to get the 
property back, cause the property to be included in your gross 
estate. A common example is putting property in a trust that 
pays you income for life; the beneficiaries receive only the 
remainder interest after you pass away. Another example is 
giving someone the right to income from a property for a period 
of years, and then having full property rights returned to you.
 
✓ Gifts within three years of death: This hidden asset used to 
be a bigger issue than it is now. Because the rule is limited 
now, only certain types of property are included in your gross 
estate when you give them away within three years of your 
passing. Life insurance policies are the most likely assets to be 
included in the gross estate under the three-year rule.

357
 Chapter 15: Tackling the Federal Estate Tax When You Have Too Much Money
 
When calculating your current gross estate, don’t forget to project 
it forward a few years. How much appreciation in value do you 
expect? Could you receive an inheritance or other windfall? Don’t 
conclude estate taxes aren’t a problem until considering these 
questions.
Reducing Your Estate
The good news: Reducing your gross estate appears relatively 
easy. You simply have to give away assets. However, at a closer 
examination, giving may not be as easy as it first seems. The fol-
lowing sections outline the different strategies you can take, what 
to do when using these strategies and when to use them.
Considering strategies to 
lower your estate’s value
To reduce your estate, you have three different strategies you can 
implement to give gifts. You can use each of them in your plan, 
using different strategies for different assets. When selecting a 
strategy, you need to consider how much control you want the 
donee to have over the gift. Here are the three strategies:
 
✓ Give money or property directly to someone. When you’re 
comfortable giving the donee full control, a direct, complete 
gift is the easiest solution.
 
✓ Make indirect gifts by transferring property to a trust, lim-
ited partnership, or other entity. The donee benefits from the 
property or its income but doesn’t have direct control over 
it. This option works especially well when the donee is young 
or for some other reason you don’t want him to have full con-
trol right away. These vehicles also are useful when you want 
several people to benefit from the property and need a way to 
share the management and benefits of the property.

358
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
 
✓ Pay a third party who provides benefits to your loved one, 
such as a school or medical provider. Payments to a third-
party provider for medical or education expenses are a way 
to maximize tax-free gifts and also give you maximum control 
over how the gift is used.
We discuss different ways to use these strategies in this chapter 
and in Chapter 16. After you decide which of these strategies to 
take to reduce your estate, you have to ask yourself three impor-
tant questions. The following three sections outline them.
How much do I give?
To begin lowering your estate value, you first must decide how 
much in total to give over time. After estimating your potential 
estate tax (refer to the earlier section “Examining how your estate 
tax is calculated”), you know how much needs to be removed from 
your estate to eliminate estate taxes or bring them down to a level 
with which you’re comfortable.
You also need a financial plan or retirement plan. This plan esti-
mates the minimum amount of assets you need to keep to maintain 
your financial independence and standard of living. (We explain 
this plan in Chapter 3.) The estate plan estimates the maximum 
amount you want to keep. Whichever is higher is the amount of 
assets you should keep. If your estate’s value exceeds that amount, 
you can give the excess assets.
 
Be sure to factor in a margin of error to provide protection against 
surprises such as higher inflation or expenses, lower income, and 
declines in asset values.
When do I give it?
After comparing your retirement plan and estimates of estate 
taxes, you may conclude that your estate tax problem is minor. 
When your estate is a bit over the exempt amount (or even a bit 
below it), you may decide that taking steps to reduce the size of 
the estate isn’t worth the effort. Instead, you plan to let the estate 
pay the tax and then leave the rest to your loved ones.
You also may rationalize your decision by noting that the estate 
tax and gift tax rates are the same and that any use of the lifetime 

359
 Chapter 15: Tackling the Federal Estate Tax When You Have Too Much Money
gift tax credit reduces the estate tax credit. So, you say, what dif-
ference does it make whether I give now or later?
Many people fall into this trap in the estate tax. Remember that the 
estate tax is based on the value of the estate, and values change. 
Though you can’t tell it from the late 2000s decline in the values of 
most stocks and real estate, asset values generally rise over time. 
When property (or your estate) is appreciating, your heirs get 
more property free of tax if you give regularly.
 
To determine when to give, consider not only the current value of 
each asset but the rate at which the value is likely to appreciate. 
Keep in mind that when you give away an asset today you remove 
from the estate not only its current value but also all that future 
appreciation.
Consider the following example to see how giving now can help. 
Suppose you own a vacation home worth $250,000. The home gener-
ally appreciates at a 3 percent annual rate. You may think the home 
takes $250,000 of the tax-free $3.5 million of your estate (under the 
2009 law). But, really, in five years you estimate that the house would 
be worth $290,000; in 10 years, $336,000; and in 15 years, $390,000. 
This same appreciation could be happening with most of your 
assets, so in a future year you may have a big estate tax problem.
You have a couple options to give away your assets:
 
✓ Give some of your appreciating assets now, either directly 
or through a trust. Doing so removes the current value of the 
property from your estate and also eliminates all the future 
appreciation. Giving the vacation home to your children now 
removes $250,000 from your estate plus an estimated $140,000 
of appreciation over the next 15 years. The appreciation is 
removed from your estate at no tax cost.
 
✓ Consider giving shares of stock or a mutual fund now. As the 
shares appreciate, you may be able to give away 500 shares 
today and remain safely under the annual gift tax exclusion. 
In another few years, you may be able to give only 400 shares 
tax free. A few years after that, perhaps only 300 shares could 
be given tax free, and so on. By giving now, your heirs receive 
more shares tax free.

Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
Filing gift tax returns
Many gifts must be reported to the IRS 
on Form 709, the gift tax return. The gift 
tax returns filed over time track your 
use of the lifetime credit, and taxes are 
due when the lifetime gift tax credit is 
exhausted.
Gifts must be reported on Form 709 in the 
following situations:
 ✓ When they exceed the annual exclu-
sion amount ($13,000 in 2010) — even 
if they aren’t taxed (because of the 
lifetime gift tax exclusion or for 
another reason).
 ✓ When a married couple makes a joint 
gift that qualifies for the annual exclu-
sion. Each spouse must file a return 
consenting to the split gift. When 
each spouse makes separate gifts 
that don’t exceed the annual exclu-
sion, no return is required. (Though, 
as we discuss later in this sidebar, 
you probably want to file a return 
anyway.)
 ✓ When a gift is made that’s less than 
the annual exclusion amount but 
isn’t of a “present interest” (and as 
a result doesn’t qualify for the annual 
exclusion).
When parents or guardians spend for the 
legal support obligations of minors, these 
aren’t reportable or taxable gifts. Such 
expenses include food, shelter, medical 
care, and clothing.
You may want to file a gift tax return even 
when one isn’t required. It provides you 
peace of mind that you won’t later be 
audited for valuing your property or assets 
incorrectly. Suppose, for example, you 
give property. You must place a value on 
that property to determine whether the 
gift is taxable. When you give a publicly-
traded security (for example, stock), 
assigning a value is easy. After all, a public 
price is published for that day. When the 
gift is of other property, such as owner-
ship of a small business or real estate, the 
value is debatable. The IRS likes to chal-
lenge values placed on such gifts, argu-
ing they’re worth more and are taxable. 
So, filing gift tax returns for gifts of non-
publicly-traded property is audit insurance.
The IRS has three years after a gift tax 
return is filed to challenge the value 
placed on a gift. The statute of limitations 
is six years if the value is understated by 
25 percent or more. When you don’t file 
a gift tax return, the IRS has no time limit. 
The value of the gift can be challenged 
at any time, even after your death. And 
keep in mind that with estate audits, the 
IRS often looks at all lifetime gifts. When 
the statute of limitations isn’t running, the 
IRS can challenge a lifetime of gifts and 
assess much higher estate and gift taxes.
You should file gift tax returns any time 
the value of a gift is estimated. Keep 
copies of all your gift tax returns and the 
documentation of how the values were 
determined.

 Chapter 15: Tackling the Federal Estate Tax When You Have Too Much Money
Giving now can be valuable even when gifts exceed the annual 
gift tax exclusion and use part of the $1 million lifetime gift tax 
exclusion (which in turn uses part of the $3.5 million estate tax 
exclusion). The exclusion amounts aren’t indexed for inflation or 
asset appreciation (as of 2009; that could change). The purchasing 
power of the exclusions declines over time, so it’s better to use 
them now rather than later.
 
Don’t forget to always retain enough assets to ensure your financial 
independence. You should use only lifetime gifts for assets that 
would be taxable in your estate and aren’t needed to maintain your 
standard of living even under extreme scenarios. Don’t let the 
estate tax tail wag your financial dog.
To whom do I give?
You need to consider whether to give only to family members or 
also to those outside the family. When you give to children and 
grandchildren, do you want to give equally or do you want to give 
one more help than the others? Perhaps you don’t trust a particu-
lar family member with any of your wealth. You also may have 
charitable interests. You can give to them now or make a bequest 
in your will. Either way provides a tax deduction. More issues to 
consider on this question are in Chapter 14.
Maximizing tax-free gifts
Many people who make estate planning gifts leave money on 
the table. They don’t give in the most effective or efficient ways. 
Following a few simple rules lets you maximize the amount of 
wealth transferred to your loved ones over time at little or no tax 
cost. Keep these sections in mind as you plan your gifts.
Reviewing gift tax rules
The annual gift tax exclusion allows you to give wealth each year 
without owing taxes, using the lifetime credit, or filing a gift tax 
return. The rules aren’t overly complex; just make sure you keep 
track of them:

362
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
 
✓ You can give up to $13,000 annually tax free per person 
to as many people as you want. The annual exemption is 
adjusted for inflation and was $13,000 in 2010. Under the 
exclusion, in 2010 you can give up to $13,000 annually tax free 
per person. So, if you have three children, each can receive 
$13,000 annually tax free.
 
✓ You can make gifts under the annual exclusion to anyone. 
The donees don’t have to be relatives.
 
✓ Spouses can give separately or jointly. When a joint gift is 
made by a married couple, the exclusion is doubled. So you 
and your spouse can give $26,000 to each child.
 
✓ If you give a gift that exceeds the exclusion amount each 
year, those gifts are potentially taxable. You have to file a gift 
tax return for the year they’re given. But after the gift tax is 
computed, the lifetime gift tax credit is applied against the tax. 
The gift tax exclusion is equivalent to excluding up to $1 mil-
lion worth of gifts from taxes. However, keep in mind that any 
use of the lifetime gift tax credit reduces the estate tax credit.
 
To qualify for the annual exclusion, a gift must be of a present inter-
est, which means you can’t have a legal right to a return of the prop-
erty or oblige the donee to use it in a certain way. The use and 
ownership by the donee also can’t be delayed or restricted.
Gifts in trust generally don’t qualify for the exclusion, because 
they aren’t present interests. They can be made to qualify for the 
exclusion by adding a Crummey power to the trust. (The Crummey 
power is named after the court case sanctioning it.) After a gift 
is made to a trust, the Crummey power allows the beneficiary to 
request withdrawal of the gift within a certain time after being noti-
fied of the gift. If the beneficiary doesn’t request withdrawal within 
the time period (most estate planners recommend 30 days), the 
property remains in the trust subject to its terms.
 
The IRS doesn’t like the Crummey power and periodically chal-
lenges its use or asks Congress to prohibit it. So, to help avoid 
issues, it’s important to notify beneficiaries in writing of their right 
to withdraw a gift and keep a record of the notices.

363
 Chapter 15: Tackling the Federal Estate Tax When You Have Too Much Money
Increasing the benefits of gifts
Some basic strategies maximize the value of property transferred 
from your estate tax free. Keep these strategies in mind:
 
✓ Make gifts early in the year. Estate planning gifts usually are 
made late in the year as part of the holiday season. People 
often rush to make the gifts final by December 31. Giving early 
in the year, however, is safer and provides more benefits.
 
 Giving early in the year ensures that any appreciation in the 
property for the year already is out of your estate tax free 
(perhaps increasing the amount of property you give tax free), 
and any income earned by the money or property won’t be 
on your income tax return. When you give income-producing 
property to someone in a lower tax bracket, it means more 
after-tax money remains in the family that year.
 
 Early-year gifts also ensure that the gifts are made. By waiting, 
you take the risk that something may happen and prevent you 
from making the gifts by December 31.
 
✓ Maximize tax-free gifts. The annual exclusion and lifetime 
credit aren’t the only ways to make tax-free gifts. Here are two 
others you may consider:
 
• Education gifts made directly to an education institution 
are tax free in unlimited amounts and may be made for any 
individual. Qualifying gifts are those for direct tuition costs, 
not for books, supplies, board, lodging, or other fees.
 
• Medical expense gifts also are tax free in unlimited 
amounts when paid directly to the medical care provider 
on behalf of any individual. Qualifying gifts are those that 
would qualify as deductible itemized medical expenses on 
Schedule A of the income tax return of the beneficiary.
 
✓ Make gifts that aren’t tax free. The gift tax credit isn’t cur-
rently indexed for inflation, so its purchasing power declines 
each year. As a result, it’s generally better to use the credit 
now rather than later. It may even be a good idea to make gifts 
exceeding the lifetime credit. Remember, estate and gift taxes 
are based on the value of property. When property will appre-
ciate and you don’t need it to maintain your standard of living, 

364
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
remove it from your estate. It can be worthwhile to pay gift 
taxes on today’s value when doing so avoids estate taxes on 
the future higher value.
 
✓ Consider potential capital gains and losses. Gifts of property 
with capital gains raise issues. When appreciated property is 
given, the donee generally takes the same tax basis you had 
in the property. Capital gains and losses on property are com-
puted by taking the amount realized on the sale of property 
and subtracting the tax basis. The difference is the gain or loss.
 
 Because the donee takes the same basis you had in the prop-
erty, the appreciation during your ownership isn’t taxed when 
the gift is made. Instead, when the donee sells the property, 
taxes will be paid on the appreciation during your ownership 
and on any appreciation during the donee’s ownership. Those 
rules lead to some key ideas for maximizing the benefit from 
tax-free gifts:
 
• Don’t give property in which you have a paper loss. 
When the property is worth less than your basis, the 
donee’s basis is the current value. No one deducts the 
loss that occurred during your ownership. So, it’s poten-
tially better for you to sell the property, deduct the loss 
on your tax return, and gift the sale proceeds (or find 
something else to give).
 
• Don’t make taxable gifts of appreciated property that will 
be sold quickly. Suppose property you plan to give has 
appreciated. You know the donee will sell the property to 
spend the cash. The donee will pay taxes on the apprecia-
tion and have the after-tax amount to spend. When you 
already maximized tax-free gifts and will be paying gift 
taxes on the transfer, you’ll pay gift taxes on the amount 
the donee will pay in capital gains taxes. Gift taxes are 
higher than capital gains taxes. As a result, it’s better to 
sell the property, pay the capital gains taxes, and give the 
after-tax amount (or give other property or cash).
 
• Give appreciating property. Many estate planning gifts 
are made in cash. That’s fine if the donee will spend the 
money right away. But when the gifts are to build long-
term financial security, it’s better to give property you 
expect to appreciate. The future appreciation is removed 

365
 Chapter 15: Tackling the Federal Estate Tax When You Have Too Much Money
from your estate, and the gift will grow over time and 
improve the donee’s financial security. It’s best to give 
property that hasn’t appreciated much while you’ve 
owned it, so there won’t be a big built-in gain that will be 
taxed when the donee sells it.
Taking Deductions
Several deductions reduce your gross estate, but only two have 
planning potential: the marital deduction and the charitable contri-
bution deduction. These deductions are unlimited in amount, and 
they’re allowed from both the estate tax and gift tax. In this sec-
tion, we review some details of these two deductions and the plan-
ning opportunities they create.
Looking at the marital deduction
The marital deduction is allowed for most transfers from one 
spouse to the other. Tax-free gifts and bequests from one spouse 
to another may be made in unlimited amounts. The deduction is 
simple: Give wealth to your spouse — either now or through your 
will — and no one will be socked with estate or gift taxes. You can 
give any amount tax free. This deduction seemingly provides an 
easy way to eliminate estate and gift taxes: Leave everything to 
your spouse. You won’t have to do any planning other than pre-
paring a simple will that leaves the entire estate to your spouse.
 
The marital deduction does have a trap, however. Suppose your will 
leaves the entire estate to your surviving spouse. Your estate won’t 
owe any taxes. But now your spouse has two estates — yours plus 
his. He has the burden of doing all the planning. More importantly, if 
the estate is valuable, he’s in trouble because your lifetime estate 
and gift tax credit is lost. The marital deduction reduced the taxable 
estate to zero, so no tax was available to apply your credit against. 
A spouse can’t transfer an unused credit to the other spouse (or to 
anyone else for that matter). So, any of the credit that’s not used 
simply expires. As a result, your spouse will have to reduce estate 
and gift taxes for two estates with the benefit of only one credit.

366
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
Some estate owners don’t want to use the marital deduction. 
They may be afraid that their spouses won’t be able to manage 
the property. Others want to ensure the property benefits certain 
people after the spouse passes away.  (Check out the later section 
“Choosing Family Estate Strategies” for more information.)
Giving charitable gifts
Leaving wealth to charity is a popular way to reduce or eliminate 
estate taxes. The estate tax encourages this type of giving with 
the unlimited charitable contribution deduction. The charitable 
contribution deduction is for gifts to charities that also qualify for 
charitable contribution deductions on the income tax return. You 
can make charitable gifts with any of the following, depending on 
your estate plan:
 
✓ Trust: Although your spouse and children may not be happy 
if you eliminate estate and gift taxes by leaving everything to 
charity, you can benefit charity and your family at the same 
time by using a trust. Certain types of trusts qualify for the 
deduction and benefit both your loved ones (or you) and char-
ity. Check out Chapter 16 for more details.
 
✓ Charitable foundation: You also can make charitable gifts 
by setting up a charitable foundation either now or through 
your will. If you decide to do so, check with an expert on 
creating and operating a foundation because they’re compli-
cated. Here’s a brief rundown of how charitable foundations 
work: You create a charitable foundation and file to get a tax 
exemption from the IRS. After the foundation is approved, you 
transfer wealth to it. You (or your estate) receive a charitable 
contribution deduction for transfers to the foundation. You 
take the deduction on your income tax return when you give 
now and on your estate tax return when you give through your 
will. Over time, the foundation makes gifts to charity.
 
 At first blush, you may think your loved ones won’t benefit from a 
charitable foundation. But that isn’t the case. They can be 
employees or board members of the foundation and receive rea-
sonable compensation for their efforts. The foundation also is a 
good way for loved ones to discover opportunities to help others.

367
 Chapter 15: Tackling the Federal Estate Tax When You Have Too Much Money
 
✓ Charitable gift annuity: A charitable gift annuity is similar to 
a commercial annuity, except the promise to pay you lifetime 
income is made by a charity instead of a commercial insurer. 
(Chapter 7 discusses commercial annuities in greater detail.) 
Also, the payments will be less than those of a commercial 
annuity. The main differences between the two are that a char-
itable contribution is deductible against either your income or 
estate taxes in the year the annuity is set up and the charitable 
annuity will pay less than a commercial annuity. The differ-
ence is your gift to charity.
 
 You can enter into the charitable gift annuity during your life-
time to provide a current income tax deduction and income 
for life. Or you can have your estate buy the annuity to obtain 
a charitable deduction and provide income to a loved one. The 
IRS has life expectancy and interest rate tables that determine 
the amount of the deduction. The charity you buy the annuity 
from also can help determine the deduction.
 
 You don’t need to shop around for the charity offering the 
best rates. Most charities agree to the same payout schedule. 
You do have to check the financial condition of the charity, 
though. After all, in this case the only thing backing the prom-
ise of future income is the charity.
Choosing Family Estate Strategies
Every family is unique, but you can choose to use some standard 
family estate planning tools. Most families find that some combi-
nation of these strategies — perhaps with some modifications — 
meets their goals. In the following sections, we review the tools and 
explain how they may be combined into an estate plan.
Earlier in this chapter, in the “Looking at the marital deduction” 
section, we discuss how you can give an unlimited amount of 
wealth to your spouse and qualify for the marital deduction. We 
also discuss some limits and potential drawbacks to the marital 
deduction and promise to show you ways to overcome these dis-
advantages of the marital deduction. We deliver those ideas in this 
section. After discussing several specific tools, we explain how 
these can be combined to form a full estate plan.

368
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
Equalizing estates
Sometimes married couples have unequal wealth. In those cases, 
title to the bulk of the assets is in the name of only one spouse. 
If the family wealth isn’t large enough to face estate taxes, that 
inequality may not be a problem. But if the joint estate exceeds 
$3.5 million, unequal estates could result in unnecessary estate 
and gift taxes.
Suppose, for example, one spouse has title to almost all the assets, 
but the other spouse dies first. The estate tax credit of that spouse 
is thus lost, and only the credit of the other spouse is available to 
shelter the joint estate from taxes. Also, the marital deduction no 
longer is available, because one spouse passed away.
 
A good estate plan tries to equalize estates and give each spouse 
ownership of some assets so that at least part of each spouse’s life-
time credit is used. To equalize your estates, you use the marital 
deduction (which we describe earlier in the chapter) to spread the 
wealth. This deduction allows unlimited tax-free gifts between 
spouses, so it’s easy and inexpensive to transfer ownership of 
assets. This way neither spouse owns most of the estate and nei-
ther spouse’s lifetime credit is wasted.
Suppose, for example one spouse owns $5 million of different 
types of assets, and the other spouse has only $500,000 worth of 
assets. The wealthier spouse can give assets to the other spouse. 
This can be done by simply changing the name on an investment 
or bank account or changing the deed on a piece of real estate.
Using the bypass trust
You can’t take advantage of the lifetime estate tax credit by leav-
ing the entire estate to your spouse. You can only use the credit 
by leaving property to someone other than your spouse. However, 
the problem for many estate owners is that while they want to 
leave property to their children or other loved ones, they don’t 
want to shortchange their spouses. They want to make sure the 
spouse is cared for first and the children receive what’s left.

369
 Chapter 15: Tackling the Federal Estate Tax When You Have Too Much Money
 
The tool for these situations is the bypass trust (also known as the 
credit shelter trust or A-B trust). The bypass trust gets its name because 
the assets bypass your spouse’s estate and aren’t taxed in it. It allows 
you to avoid estate taxes without leaving your spouse without suffi-
cient financial resources. A bypass trust basically works this way:
 
1. The trust receives assets from your estate.
 
 Your estate transfers a portion of its assets to the trust, and 
the rest goes to your spouse.
 
 The combination of the marital deduction and lifetime credit 
eliminate estate taxes while providing for your spouse. The 
assets transferred to the trust are sheltered from taxes by 
the estate tax credit. No taxes are due until the amount trans-
ferred to the trust exceeds $3.5 million.
 
2. Your spouse becomes the prime beneficiary of the trust.
 
 As the primary beneficiary, your spouse receives income and 
principal from the trust as needed to support his standard of 
living. Your children (or other loved ones you name) receive the 
remainder of the trust after your spouse passes away. An addi-
tional benefit of the trust is it ensures that the wealth in the trust 
eventually goes to your children, not the spouse or children of a 
subsequent marriage of your spouse or to any other beneficiaries.
 
When drafting your will, use a formula for the amount to be trans-
ferred to the bypass trust. For example, your will may say the 
bypass trust should receive the lesser of $3.5 million or 40 percent 
of your estate. This ensures that at least part of your estate tax 
credit is used but not at the expense of leaving your spouse with no 
assets in his own name.
Taking advantage of marital 
deduction trusts
Some folks don’t like the price of using the marital deduction. They 
like the idea of avoiding estate taxes by leaving wealth to their 
spouses, but they have concerns about leaving a lot of wealth out-
right to their spouses. Some are concerned the spouse won’t manage 
the wealth well or may spend too much. Others are happy to leave 

370
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
the wealth to their spouses, but they fear that the remaining wealth 
ultimately could go to people they didn’t intend. A surviving spouse 
may eventually be inclined to leave the money to charity, a subse-
quent spouse, or the children of another subsequent marriage.
 
You can consider the following two trusts in these situations:
 
✓ Marital deduction trust: Under this trust, the spouse receives 
income as needed and may receive principal under the terms 
you specify in the trust agreement. You can provide that your 
spouse receive the entire trust principal when needed to meet 
her needs. The trust allows your spouse to appoint in her 
will who eventually inherits the trust remainder. The entire 
trust qualifies for the marital deduction in your estate, and it’s 
included in your spouse’s gross estate.
 
 The marital deduction trust takes management of the property 
away from your spouse. You can have it managed by a family 
member, a trusted friend, or a professional. The trust also can 
prevent wasteful spending by giving the trustee guidelines 
over when principal should be distributed. However, the mari-
tal deduction trust doesn’t ensure that the trust remainder 
goes to those you want to have it. So, if that’s important to 
you, check out the QTIP.
 
✓ Qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) trust: The 
QTIP trust is a special trust specifically sanctioned in the tax 
code. To receive its benefits, your estate planner must draft 
it to meet the requirements in the tax code. The spouse must 
receive all income from the trust at least annually. You may 
allow the trustee to distribute principal to your spouse under 
guidelines you set. You also decide how the trust remainder 
is distributed. Your spouse has no role in that decision. The 
property transferred to the trust qualifies for the marital 
deduction in your estate, and the trust remainder is included 
in your spouse’s gross estate. So, it may face estate taxes in 
your spouse’s estate if the estate is large enough.

371
 Chapter 15: Tackling the Federal Estate Tax When You Have Too Much Money
Putting the strategies together
A standard estate plan using the strategies in the preceding sec-
tions can eliminate estate taxes and provide for your spouse. 
Combining these strategies may look something like this:
 
1. You transfer a portion of your estate to a bypass trust.
 
 The amount transferred depends on the size of the estate, the 
amount of assets the surviving spouse owns independently, 
and the assets the surviving spouse needs. You set the amount 
or a formula to determine the amount in your will. This por-
tion of the estate is sheltered by the lifetime estate tax credit, 
so it should be no more than the credit will protect.
 
2. You leave the rest of your estate to your surviving spouse to 
qualify for the marital deduction.
 
 This portion of the estate can be bequeathed directly to the 
spouse. Or it can be left to a trust for the spouse’s benefit, 
such as a marital deduction trust or a QTIP trust.
The combination of the bypass trust and marital deduction elimi-
nates estate taxes and ensures that the surviving spouse is pro-
vided for. The taxes on the spouse’s estate are reduced, because 
the part of the first spouse’s estate that goes to the bypass trust 
won’t be in the second spouse’s gross estate.
 
If you have a larger estate, you can build on the preceding model and 
implement other strategies. You can consider doing the following:
 
✓ You can give away more assets early either directly or through 
trusts.
 
✓ You can add charitable giving to your estate plan. The gifts 
may be made either directly or through trusts that provide 
some benefits for you or your loved ones and some benefits 
for charity.
 
When you own a business, you need to consider more sophisti-
cated strategies that are beyond the scope of this book. Business 
owners need to consider additional factors, such as who will suc-
ceed them as owners and managers, the cash flow of the business, 
and who will pay the estate taxes due on the business. They may 

372
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
need to consider family limited partnerships, employee stock own-
ership plans, recapitalization plans, and other strategies. Your 
estate planner, or estate planning team, can help evaluate the 
options and implement your choices.
Contemplating Life Insurance
Sometimes you may need to consider life insurance as part of an 
estate plan. When we refer to life insurance here, we mean the per-
manent (cash-value) life insurance and not the less costly term life 
insurance. At some point, term life insurance becomes too expen-
sive or you become too old to buy it. (See Chapter 2 for more details 
on the different types of life insurance.) That’s why so-called perma-
nent life insurance is used for estate planning purposes — because 
the need for life insurance in that case isn’t a short-term need.
Permanent insurance may not be available to everyone. Your 
health or age could make you uninsurable or make the premiums 
too high to be feasible. That’s another reason not to procrastinate 
about your estate plan. Delaying it can reduce your options.
 
Life insurance has two potential purposes in an estate plan:
 
✓ To ensure the estate has enough cash to pay taxes, debts, and 
other obligations without forcing the sale of assets
 
✓ To equalize the inheritances of different loved ones or to 
increase the overall inheritance
The following sections take a closer look at these two purposes. 
In either case it’s best for the insurance to be owned by an irrevo-
cable trust, limited partnership, or limited liability company, as we 
discuss in Chapter 16.
Paying obligations 
with life insurance
An estate may be valuable enough to cause a significant estate tax 
bill, or the estate may have debt that needs to be repaid after the 

373
 Chapter 15: Tackling the Federal Estate Tax When You Have Too Much Money
owner dies. In either case, you have a problem if the estate doesn’t 
have a lot of cash or liquid assets to pay the obligations. A perma-
nent life insurance policy can pay the obligations without disrupt-
ing ownership of the assets or forcing a sale.
For example, the primary asset in the estate may be a small busi-
ness, a piece of real estate, or a valuable collection. These assets 
are tough to sell in a hurry without cutting the price below its real 
value. They also would be difficult to borrow against while in the 
estate. Permanent life insurance fills the need.
Purchasing life insurance 
to enhance inheritances
Life insurance can ease a complicated estate planning situation. 
Your estate may have an asset that isn’t easily divided and also 
won’t be easy for your heirs to share. As a result, it’s difficult to 
leave your heirs inheritances of equal value. Or you may be look-
ing for a way to increase the amount your heirs inherit. Life insur-
ance may be the solution in either of these situations.
Suppose, for example, you own a small business and have several 
children. One child has been working in the business for years, is 
good at running it, and is the logical person to succeed you. The 
business makes up the majority of your estate. You could leave 
each child equal ownership shares in the business, but that means 
children who aren’t involved in the business will have voting rights 
and will depend on it for income. Even if you leave the other chil-
dren nonvoting interests in the business, they still have an interest 
in its income. These situations often generate conflicts among the 
sibling running the business and the others. They may disagree 
about business strategy. They also may disagree about issues such 
as the salary paid to the sibling running the business, the amount 
of money reinvested in the business, and the amount distributed 
to owners.
 
To deal with our preceding example (or one like it), you have a 
couple options:

374
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
 
✓ Buy life insurance to provide most of the inheritance of the 
children not in the business. They inherit the insurance benefits 
and nonbusiness assets, and the other child inherits the business.
 
✓ Use permanent life insurance as an investment to increase the 
size of your estate. This strategy requires a careful purchase of 
life insurance as well as the cash flow and commitment to pay the 
premiums for life (without hampering your lifestyle). Be sure you 
do an independent examination of the expected returns on the 
life insurance compared to investment alternatives.
Avoiding the Tax on Gifts 
to Grandkids: The GSTT
In the past, wealthy people gave gifts and bequests directly to 
their grandchildren (or trusts for their benefits) in an attempt to 
avoid paying estate taxes. Uncle Sam reacted to these attempts 
with the generation-skipping transfer tax (GSTT) to tax gifts and 
bequests made directly to grandchildren (or later generations).
The government’s concern (and reason for creating the GSTT) is that 
such gifts may avoid a level of estate taxes. When you leave your 
estate to your kids, the assets are taxed in your estate. When your 
kids leave the estate to their kids, the assets are taxed again in their 
estates. The government doesn’t want you to bypass that second 
level of estate taxes by leaving assets directly to your grandchildren.
The GSTT defines any person at least two generations younger than 
you as a skip person. Any gift or bequest to a skip person is taxed at 
the top estate tax rate (45 percent in 2009). Everyone has a $1 mil-
lion lifetime exemption from the GSTT. So after lifetime gifts to skip 
persons exceed $1 million, they’re taxed at the top estate tax rate.
 
Because the details of the GSTT are complicated, we suggest you not 
attempt to plan around the tax without the advice of a good estate 
planner. But here’s a general rule to keep in mind: When property will 
be included in the next generation’s estate, it won’t be considered a 
gift or bequest to a skip person. When the gift or bequest is made in a 
way that it won’t be included in an estate of someone in the next gen-
eration below you, it’s likely a generation-skipping transfer.

Focusing on Estate Taxes and 
the Many Types of Trusts
In This Chapter
▶ Recognizing the individuals involved in trusts
▶ Understanding the different types of trusts
▶ Planning your estate with trusts that fit your needs
T
rusts have been a key element of estate plans for centuries and 
began as a way to avoid taxes. Now, trusts remain central to 
estate planning for estates of all levels and serve many purposes, 
but tax reduction remains a key use of trusts for those individuals 
rich enough to worry about estate taxes.
Many types of trusts are available, and they can get complicated. 
But the simple fact of estate tax reduction is that putting an asset in 
a properly-designed trust can avoid estate taxes on that asset. When 
tax reduction is one of your estate planning goals, your estate plan-
ner will ask you to at least consider using different types of trusts. 
Although tax reduction isn’t the main goal of estate planning and 
affects fewer estates each year, when you are fortunate enough to 
have an estate that may be taxable, tax reduction is one of your top 
goals and different types of trusts may be potential solutions.
Trusts used to be the province only of the very wealthy. In the 
last few decades, however, trusts have found their way into more 
estate plans because they can solve many problems. Now, many 
people use trusts in all kinds of estates to avoid probate, ensure 
that assets are well managed, or control how and when assets are 
distributed to loved ones.

376
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
Trusts really are fairly simple, but they’re made to seem more 
complicated than they are. Our goal in this chapter is to demys-
tify them a bit so you can better comprehend what trusts are and 
how to use them in your estate plan. You should have a working 
understanding of trusts in order to be better prepared to work 
with your estate planning team to develop an effective estate plan.

Chapter 13.
Identifying the Cast of Characters
A trust simply is a legal agreement or contract among three people. 
The agreement usually concerns how money or property will be 
managed and distributed. The agreement can be fairly detailed, or 
it may simply empower the trustee to use his or her best judgment. 
In order to know what you can do with a trust, you first need a firm 
understanding of who’s involved. The three people involved are
 
✓ The grantor: Also referred to as the creator, this person cre-
ates the trust and usually transfers the assets to the trust.
 
✓ The trustee: This person takes title to the trust property and 
manages it according to the terms of the trust agreement and 
state law.
 
✓ The beneficiary: This person receives the trust income or prin-
cipal, or both. The trust was created and is managed for the 
benefit of the beneficiary. A beneficiary may be given additional 
rights in the trust agreement, such as the ability to replace the 
trustee or name who receives benefits after the beneficiary. A 
trust can have the following two types of beneficiaries:
 
• The income beneficiary, who receives the income.
 
• The remainder beneficiary, who receives the remaining 
assets after the income beneficiary’s rights end.
The same person can take more than one of these roles; in fact, 
one person can even take all three of them. Also, a group of people 
(rather than one person) can fill any of the roles. A trust can have 
co-grantors, co-trustees, and co-beneficiaries as well.

 Chapter 16: Focusing on Estate Taxes and the Many Types of Trusts
 
The terms of the trust and the rights and duties of each person are 
spelled out in the trust agreement. The trust agreement is drafted 
by the grantor (or, more likely, the grantor’s attorney). Trust laws 
provide a lot of flexibility, so the trust agreement can say almost 
anything the grantor wants regarding the management of the trust 
property and its distribution to beneficiaries. Either the grantor or 
the beneficiary can sue the trustee for violations of the trust agree-
ment or state law.
Naming the Types of Trusts
Before you can decide that a trust may be an option to include in 
your estate plan, you need to know the ins and outs of trusts to 
help you make an informed decision. Many different types of trusts 
are available. This section gives you an overview of the four broad 
categories of trusts, with two types in each category.
 
A trust isn’t operational or functional after it’s created. In other 
words, someone still needs to fund the trust by transferring money 
or property to it. Oftentimes you fund the trust by transferring assets 
to it at the time you created it or soon after. Yet, it isn’t unusual for a 
trust to be created during your lifetime and not be funded until the 
will is probated. Sometimes a trust may be created but never funded. 
All trusts are some combination of the different types of trusts we 
discuss here. Note: As we explain the different types of trusts in the 
following sections, we refer to you as the grantor.
Looking at when trusts take effect
The first category divides trusts based on when they take effect or 
“spring to life” as old-school estate planners liked to say. Here are 
two types of trusts in this category:
 
✓ Living trust: This type of trust, also called an inter vivos trust, 
takes effect during your lifetime. You create the trust and put 
assets in it now, and the trustee begins managing the assets.

378
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
 
 The term “living trust” creates some confusion at times. 
Chapter 14 discusses the fact that putting assets in a trust is a 
way to avoid probate. These trusts are properly called revoca-
ble living trusts; we discuss the importance of the revocable 
part in the next section.
 
✓ Postmortem trust: You create this type of trust through your 
will, which doesn’t take effect until after your passing.
Revoking or retaining rights
The second category of trusts is divided between those where you, 
when drafting the trust agreement, retained the right to change 
or revoke the trust and those where you give up those rights. The 
following sections take a closer look at these two types of trusts. 
Note: The tax law treats these two trusts very differently for both 
the income tax and estate tax.
Revocable trusts
Probably the most common trust is the revocable living trust, which 
is used to avoid probate (see Chapter 14). A revocable trust is one 
that allows you, as the grantor, to change terms of the trust or revoke 
the trust entirely. You transfer titles to your property to the trust, 
including homes, cars, checking accounts, investment accounts, and 
household furnishings. You and your spouse usually are the initial 
trustees and beneficiaries. The trust agreement spells out who suc-
ceeds you both as trustees and beneficiaries. All the property in 
the trust avoids probate and is distributed to heirs according to the 
terms of the trust rather than according to their wills.
 
The grantor of a revocable trust generally is treated as the owner 
for tax purposes. All income earned by the revocable trust is 
included in gross income on your income tax return, and all prop-
erty owned by the revocable trust is included in your gross estate 
on the estate tax return.
Irrevocable trusts
Irrevocable trusts are used to reduce income or estate taxes. With 
an irrevocable trust, you can’t change it after the trust agreement 
is signed. The income of an irrevocable trust isn’t included in 

379
 Chapter 16: Focusing on Estate Taxes and the Many Types of Trusts
your gross income, and trust property isn’t included in your gross 
estate. To achieve these tax savings, the trust must be truly irre-
vocable, and you can’t retain rights to receive income or property 
from the trust.
Determining how income 
is distributed
The third category is a fairly new way of defining trusts. This cat-
egory separates trusts based on how the amount to be distributed 
to an income beneficiary is determined. It introduces the concepts 
of income beneficiary and remainder beneficiary and shows how 
to resolve potential conflicts between the two. The following two 
sections give a bit more detail about these two types of trusts.
Income trusts
An income trust is the traditional trust that most folks think of 
when the term comes up. The assets of the trust are divided into 
income and principal. The annual income of the trust (interest, div-
idends, and rent) is distributed to an income beneficiary (usually 
the spouse of the grantor). After the income beneficiary passes 
away, the principal is distributed to remainder beneficiaries (usu-
ally the grantor’s children). Capital gains aren’t income. They’re 
added to trust principal.
 
The income trust creates tension between the income beneficiary 
and the remainder beneficiaries — with the trustee stuck in the 
middle. The income beneficiary naturally wants the trust invested 
to maximize current income. The remainder beneficiaries prefer at 
least part of the trust to be invested for growth so they eventually 
receive more wealth.
Total return trusts
A total return trust does away with the income and principal distinc-
tion. Either a percentage of the trust value or a fixed amount is dis-
tributed to the income beneficiary each year. The trustee invests 
in a diversified portfolio with a long-term risk and return trade-off 
rather than worrying about whether the portfolio generates enough 

380
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
income to sustain the income beneficiary’s standard of living. The 
income beneficiary may be paid from income, capital gains, or even 
principal. When a fixed amount is distributed each year, the poten-
tial exists for the income beneficiary’s purchasing power to decline 
because of inflation. This is one reason to have the trust pay a per-
centage of its value instead of a fixed amount. Or the fixed amount 
can be adjusted periodically for inflation.
In either case, the remainder beneficiaries receive whatever is in 
the trust after the income beneficiary passes. Because the trust 
was invested to generate a total return instead of income, there 
is the potential for both the income and remainder beneficiaries 
to be better off. When the trust’s investments do well, the income 
beneficiary receives higher payouts over time, and the remainder 
beneficiaries receive more than they would have if the trust 
had been invested for income.
Addressing the trustee’s powers
The fourth category of trusts separates trusts based on the extent 
of the trustee’s powers. This category has two basic types, which 
we discuss in the following sections.
Discretionary trusts
In a discretionary trust, the trustee decides when to distribute 
income and principal to the beneficiaries and how much to dis-
tribute. The trustee uses her judgment to balance factors such 
as knowledge of the beneficiaries’ needs, the grantor’s goals, the 
investment performance of the trust, and other factors. The discre-
tion may be total or partial.
An example of a trust with partial discretion is one that instructs 
the trustee to pay all the annual income to the beneficiary unless 
the trustee decides it isn’t in the best interests of the beneficiary. 
For instance, the distributions could be withheld if the beneficiary 
has a substance abuse or gambling problem, is involved in an acri-
monious divorce, or for some other reason.

381
 Chapter 16: Focusing on Estate Taxes and the Many Types of Trusts
Nondiscretionary trusts
In a nondiscretionary trust, the trustee is told to make distributions on 
a specific schedule or using a formula. The trustee may be instructed 
to distribute all the income to the beneficiary each year. When the 
beneficiary turns 25 years old, for example, the trustee distributes 
one-third of the trust principal and continues distributing income. 
The rest of the principal is distributed when the beneficiary turns 30.
Another typical nondiscretionary trust requires the trustee to pay 
all the income to the income beneficiary for life. After the income 
beneficiary passes away, the trust principal is distributed equally 
to the remainder beneficiaries.
Using Trusts in Estate Planning
Many types of trusts are available to help you achieve your spe-
cific personal finance goals during your senior years and after your 
passing. These trusts are variations of the different types of trusts 
we discuss in the previous sections.
In this section, we review some specialized trusts and help you 
determine when to use them. Many of these trusts are established 
at least in part to reduce income or estate taxes or both.
 
These trusts must meet strict and detailed tax code requirements to 
achieve the tax savings, so don’t try to establish them without an 
estate planning attorney. (Chapter 15 discusses basic estate planning 
trusts for married couples, such as marital deduction trusts and QTIP 
trusts. We also discuss irrevocable living trusts to avoid probate.)
Donating to charity with 
charitable trusts
In your estate planning, you can use trusts to make charitable 
contributions while retaining some income or wealth for you or 
your loved ones. These trusts can be created during your lifetime 
or in your will. You have two options with charitable trusts, and 
we discuss them in the following sections.

382
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
Charitable remainder trusts
If you want to give money or assets to benefit a charity, retain 
some income for you or loved ones, avoid taxes on capital gains, 
or reduce your estate tax, a charitable remainder trust may be a 
good option for you. The charitable remainder trust (CRT) is best 
used for appreciated assets (those that have risen in value) with 
substantial capital gains.
So how does a CRT work? The following steps walk you through 
the process:
 
1. You (or your estate) transfer appreciated property to the CRT.
 
2. The trust sells the transferred property at market value.
 
 Because it’s a charitable trust, it’s tax exempt and no taxes are 
due on the gains.
 
3. The trust reinvests the sale proceeds in a diversified portfolio.
 
 The trust begins to make annual distributions to you and 
any other beneficiaries you name in the trust agreement. 
The income lasts for life or for a period of years. The income 
may be a fixed amount or a percentage of the trust’s value — 
whichever you chose.
 
4. After the income period ends, the property remaining in the 
trust (the remainder interest) is distributed to the charity.
 
 The present value of the remainder interest that the charity 
eventually receives is deductible in the year property is trans-
ferred to the trust. If you transfer property to the trust during 
your lifetime, the contribution is deducted on your income 
tax. If you have your estate transfer the property, the chari-
table contribution deduction is taken on the estate tax return. 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tables using current interest 
rates and the life expectancies of the income beneficiaries 
determine the amount of the deduction. The older the benefi-
ciaries are (or the shorter the payout period), the greater the 
percentage of the property’s value that can be deducted.
Charitable lead trusts
Perhaps you want to pay income to a charity for a period of years, 
and then you want the trust to pay income and distributions to you 

383
 Chapter 16: Focusing on Estate Taxes and the Many Types of Trusts
and any other beneficiaries. If so, you may want to consider a chari-
table lead trust. The charitable lead trust (CLT) is sort of the oppo-
site of the CRT (which we explain in the preceding section). As with 
the CRT, you (or your estate) transfer property to the trust. Then 
the trust sells the property and invests in a diversified portfolio.
 
An important difference from the CRT is that the CLT isn’t tax 
exempt, because the charity isn’t the ultimate beneficiary. When 
property is sold at a gain and income is earned, the trust pays taxes 
on it. However, like the CRT, the transfer of property is considered 
a charitable contribution and creates a deduction.
A CLT basically operates in the following fashion:
 
1. After the transfer of property, the trust makes payments to a 
charity for a period of years determined by you.
 
 The payments may be either a percentage of the trust’s value 
or a fixed amount.
 
2. After the income period ends, the property remaining in 
the trust is distributed to you or any other beneficiaries you 
named.
 
 The transfer of property to the trust is considered a charitable 
contribution, so a deduction may be taken. IRS tables based on 
current interest rates and the time the charity will receive pay-
ments determine the amount of the deduction. The longer the 
charity is paid, the greater the percentage of the property’s 
value that is deductible.
Opting for retained income trusts
You may want to take advantage of some estate planning benefits 
with trusts without completely giving away property. With these 
types of trusts, known as retained interest trusts, the grantor 
receives income from the trust or eventually has the trust 
remainder returned. (Refer to the earlier section “Identifying the 
Cast of Characters” for more on who plays the role of grantor.) 
The charitable trusts we discuss in the previous section are con-
sidered retained interest trusts, but the trusts we introduce in 
the following sections don’t involve charity.

384
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
Qualified personal residence trusts
A qualified personal residence trust (QPRT) is a special trust 
involving either the principal residence or a vacation home of the 
grantor. Here’s how this type of trust works: The grantor trans-
fers the house to a trust. The trust makes the grantor the income 
beneficiary, allowing the grantor to live in the home for a period of 
years. After that period, the home belongs to the remainder ben-
eficiaries of the trust, who usually are the children of the grantor. 
Because of this last point, the QPRT generally is used for second 
homes instead of the primary residence.
The goal of the QPRT is to remove the house’s value from the 
grantor’s estate at a low tax cost. When the house is transferred 
to the trust, a gift is made to the children. The potentially taxable 
amount of that gift is the present value of the interest the children 
will receive. IRS tables using current interest rates determine the 
value of the gift. The longer the children wait to receive the home, 
the lower the value of the gift.
 
When the grantor dies during the income period, the estate tax 
effect is as though nothing had been done. The house is included in 
the estate, and the estate receives a credit for any gift taxes paid 
when the house was transferred to the trust. When the grantor out-
lives the income period, however, the house isn’t included in the 
estate. So, for the QPRT to have any tax benefits, the grantor must 
outlive the income period of the trust.
 
After the income period, the grantor has no legal rights in the 
home. When the grantor desires to live in or use the home, he has 
two options: He can rent the home from the children, or they can 
allow the grantor to live in it rent free, making a gift of the annual 
rental value. For these reasons, the QPRT frequently is used only 
after other estate tax reduction strategies have been used and with 
a house other than the principal residence.
Grantor retained income and annuity trusts
Retained income trusts that don’t involve a home include the 
grantor retained income trust (GRIT) and the grantor retained annu-
ity trust (GRAT). In each of these trusts, property is transferred to 

385
 Chapter 16: Focusing on Estate Taxes and the Many Types of Trusts
the trust, and then the trust pays income to the beneficiaries (usu-
ally the children of the grantor) for a period of years chosen by the 
grantor. After that, the property is returned to the grantor.
At first, this circular strategy seems to have no benefits. But 
nuances in the tax law make these trusts an effective way to trans-
fer wealth to others at a low tax cost. IRS tables that use current 
government interest rates are used to value the gift made to ben-
eficiaries. When the trust earns more than the government interest 
rates and transfers that income to the beneficiaries, the excess 
income is transferred free of estate and gift taxes.
 
Estate planners generally favor establishing these trusts for short 
periods of time, usually two to five years. Assets transferred to the 
trust should be those that are expected to earn income or capital 
gains exceeding the government interest rates.
 
The estate tax law is likely to be changed to require these trusts to 
last at least ten years to have tax benefits. Your estate planner 
should know the current law, but be aware of the potential for 
change when formulating your estate plan.
Taking care of special 
needs with SNTs
You may have one or more family members with chronic illnesses 
or conditions that require extra expenses, special care, or lifelong 
attention. You may be the person with the illness or condition, or it 
may be your loved one, such as a child. In either case, your estate 
plan requires the following adjustments and special considerations:
 
✓ When you, the estate owner, are the one with the condi-
tion: A revocable living trust may be more important for you 
than for others (see the earlier section “Revocable trusts” 
for more information). The advantage of the revocable living 
trust in these situations is the ability of a successor trustee 
or co-trustee to step up and manage property when the prin-
cipal trustee is unable to. The co-trustee arrangement allows 
the estate owner to supervise and be in control while the 

386
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
co-trustee performs the ministerial tasks of managing the 
property and learning about it. A revocable living trust also 
provides a smooth transition to the successor trustee.
 
✓ When a loved one, especially a child, is the one with the 
chronic condition: The concern is how to provide continuing 
care when the parents are gone. It isn’t a good idea to depend 
on government programs to provide support. Another bad idea 
is to leave assets to the other children with instructions to care 
for their sibling. Even when the other children have the best 
intentions, they may die first, or their assets could be dissi-
pated in divorce or lost through their own financial difficulties.
The solution for either of these cases usually is a special needs 
trust (SNT). This trust is drafted so it doesn’t count as part of the 
beneficiary’s income or assets under government programs such 
as Medicaid. An SNT can be set up with assets from several differ-
ent sources, including the following:
 
✓ The special needs person’s own assets: An example of this 
case may be a child who was injured in an accident and 
received a settlement. Under the law, the person could qualify 
for Medicaid during life, but Medicaid is reimbursed from the 
trust after that person’s death.
 
✓ The assets of others: In this case, the SNT may be set up with 
parents’ assets or with the benefits of a life insurance policy. 
The trust can be set up so Medicaid isn’t reimbursed from it. 
Any remainder in the trust could go to the other siblings or 
other heirs. A life insurance policy also could be used to pro-
vide for other heirs while leaving most of the estate to the SNT.
 
With a special needs child, it’s important to use an estate planner 
experienced with government programs so the will, trust, and any 
gifts don’t make the child ineligible for Medicaid or other govern-
ment programs. For example, a key term should say the trust will 
provide only supplemental care beyond that provided by the 
government and any income the child earns. Otherwise, the trust 
assets are considered the child’s assets when considering eligibility 
for government programs.

387
 Chapter 16: Focusing on Estate Taxes and the Many Types of Trusts
Spreading the wealth through 
dynasty trusts
Instead of leaving wealth to the next generation and letting them use 
it or pass it on as they wish, you can set up a dynasty trust, which 
limits the distributions to each generation. A dynasty trust basically 
benefits several generations of a family. This type of trust that once 
was restricted to the very wealthy is now being used more often.
In the typical dynasty trust, the parents set up an irrevocable trust 
(refer to the earlier section “Irrevocable trusts” for more informa-
tion). Some parents transfer a range of assets to the trust during 
their lives or through their wills. Most often, however, the only 
asset is life insurance. When life insurance is the main asset, the 
parents transfer cash to the trust annually, and the trustee uses 
the cash to pay the insurance premiums.
 
The cheapest life insurance for a married couple is a joint and last 
survivor, or survivorship, policy that pays benefits only after each 
of the spouses has passed on.
The policy benefits eventually are paid to the trust. The trustee 
invests and manages the money and also uses it to benefit the 
family members designated in the trust agreement. The distribu-
tion rates and formulas are limited only by your imagination and 
goals. For the trust to really be a dynasty trust, however, the distri-
butions should be less than the fund earns. Often family members 
begin receiving distributions only after reaching a certain age, and 
family members share in receiving a fixed percentage of the trust’s 
value each year. The trust also may make loans to family members 
to buy homes, start businesses, attend college, or for other needs.
 
A dynasty trust has more than tax benefits. The wealth is protected 
from creditors of family members as well as from mismanagement by 
family members, divorces, lawsuits, medical bills, and the like. Plus, 
assets in the trust aren’t subject to probate as family members die.
A dynasty trust usually is limited to about six generations. At that 
point the trust winds down by distributing its assets to the latest 
generation or other designated beneficiaries.

388
Part IV: Estate Planning: It’s More than Just Dead People and Lawyers 
Creating life insurance trusts
You may want to include life insurance as part of your estate 
plan. You can use it to pay taxes, to ensure the estate has enough 
cash, or to increase the inheritances of loved ones. Permanent life 
insurance is used in these situations. You also may own term life 
insurance to cover specific expenses, such as the mortgage, child 
education, and income replacement.
Chapter 15 points out that the life insurance benefits are included in 
your gross estate when you have any incidents of ownership over the 
policy. This term means you can’t be allowed to cash in the policy, 
change its beneficiary, or take any other actions the owner of the 
policy can take. To avoid having life insurance benefits reduced 
by estate taxes, the policy should be owned by an irrevocable life 
insurance trust. This type of trust has an independent trustee who’s 
empowered, but not required, to buy insurance on the grantor’s life 
with the trust as beneficiary. The trust agreement provides that any 
insurance benefits will be distributed to the grantor’s estate to pay 
the taxes and other expenses. Any additional amounts will be paid 
to other beneficiaries designated by the grantor.
 
After the trust is created, you contribute money each year to pay 
insurance premiums, and the trustee pays the premiums. The trust 
needs a Crummey clause (see Chapter 15) for the gifts to qualify for 
the annual gift tax exclusion. When these and other technical terms 
(generally limiting your ability to control or influence the trust) are 
met, the life insurance benefits are paid to the trust and not 
included in your gross estate. Your loved ones benefit from the full 
policy benefits instead of the after-tax amount.
 
You may achieve the same result without a trust. You could make 
annual gifts to your children and have them buy insurance on your 
life and pay the premiums. Of course, this setup has no legal 
requirement that they use the gifts to pay the premiums. Another 
alternative is to form a partnership to own the policy. The steps are 
similar to those for the trust. This strategy hasn’t been used as long 
as the trust, so the rules aren’t always as clear.

you should consider when contemplating working 
in retirement, and ten tips to consider when car-

Chapter 17
Ten Common Retirement and 
Estate Planning Mistakes
In This Chapter
▶ Learning from the mistakes of those who retired before you
▶ Improving the quality of your retirement by planning ahead
W
hen putting together your retirement and estate plans, you 
have many steps to take. No one’s plan is the same; every-
one’s has unique elements. The details of plans are changing as 
folks live longer and are more active. Even so, many people make 
similar planning mistakes; these mistakes may mean the difference 
between a satisfying retirement and an unsatisfying one. You can 
discover some important lessons from other people’s mistakes.
Although some information about retirement and estate planning 
is easy to find, other information isn’t — and most of the mistakes 
people make result from wrong assumptions or misinformation. In 
addition, some elements of financial planning involve as much art 
as science. Sometimes the intuitive answer isn’t always the best 
answer.
In this chapter, we discuss the recurring mistakes we’ve seen over 
the years. Correcting these actions won’t make for a complete 
financial plan. But when you avoid these mistakes, you’ll be a long 
way down the road to a satisfying retirement.

392
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Not Having at Least a 
Basic Financial Plan
Many studies of retirees have been conducted. These studies often 
contain interesting information, but one fact comes out over and 
over again: Despite the differences in retirees and what they did in 
retirement, the retirees most likely to be satisfied in their golden 
years were those who were financially prepared. 
 
Being financially prepared doesn’t mean being wealthy. It does, 
however, mean doing some planning and saving early on. Those 
who did some amount of planning, especially those who saved for 
retirement for the longest periods, tend to be those who were the 
most satisfied in retirement regardless of their net worth.
Retirement seems to be more satisfying for retirees who limit their 
financial surprises. Those who go into retirement with a decent idea 
of how much money they’re able to spend in retirement and how 
long their assets will last — and then adjust their expected lifestyle 
accordingly — aren’t likely to be disappointed. On the other hand, 
those individuals who enter retirement without aligning their expec-
tations with their finances are likely to face unpleasant surprises 
and be dissatisfied.
Procrastinating About 
Estate Planning
Thanks to higher limits on the amount exempt from taxation, fewer 
estates pay federal estate taxes than a decade ago. That doesn’t 
mean it’s safe for you to forego having an estate plan, however. 
You have plenty more to plan for than just federal taxes. And you 
don’t have to be rich to benefit from an estate plan either. A good 
estate plan is important for everyone because it:
 
✓ Helps you avoid probate: The probate process in your state 
may be expensive and time consuming. If so, you would do 
your heirs a great favor by setting up your estate to avoid the 

393
 Chapter 17: Ten Common Retirement and Estate Planning Mistakes
process, such as by putting most of your assets in a revocable 
living trust.
 
✓ Determines who inherits your assets: Without a will or living 
trust, state law makes this determination for you. The division 
of your estate is likely to be different, perhaps significantly so, 
from what you would prefer. Many states, for example, give a 
quarter to a third of the estate to your children, even if your 
spouse survives you.
 
✓ Lets you decide whether your assets are received outright or 
through a trust: Check out Chapter 15 for more information.
 
✓ Helps you reduce or avoid estate or inheritance taxes: 
In states which have estate or inheritance taxes, the taxes 
often are imposed at much lower levels than the federal tax. 
State-level taxes could take a significant part of even modest 
estates. You may need to plan to lower or avoid these taxes.
 
✓ Includes tools that may come into play during your lifetime: 
A good estate plan includes such tools as a financial power 
of attorney, which ensures someone can pay your bills and 
manage your assets when you can’t. The plan also should 
include health care documents — such as a living will and a 
medical power of attorney — that name others you trust to 
make medical decisions when you can’t. Without these docu-
ments, actions generally can’t be taken without your family 
going to court and having someone appointed to make the 
decisions. That process costs time and money and could 
result in decisions being made by someone you wouldn’t have 
chosen.
Underestimating Life Expectancy
A few decades ago, the average retirement didn’t last long. A 
person retired at 65 and, on average, died around age 70. Since 
then, life expectancy has increased while the average age at retire-
ment has decreased. What many people don’t realize is that each 
year you stay alive your life expectancy increases. At your birth 
your life expectancy may have been, say, 73. But once you made it 
to young adulthood, your life expectancy increased to the late 70s.

394
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
So, getting your life expectancy right is important because your sav-
ings must last at least the rest of your life. If you don’t understand 
life expectancy, you can have serious problems when you plan 
portfolio withdrawals for a 20-year retirement and then experience 
a 30-year retirement.
For men age 65 today, life expectancy is about 85. That means 
about half will live to 85 or beyond. A number of them will live past 
90. Should all of today’s 65-year-olds base their retirement plans 
on a life expectancy of 85, half of them will have underestimated 
their life spans and be at risk of running out of money.
Financial planners generally recommend that married couples plan 
on at least one spouse living to age 90 or 95. Those aged 80 and 
older are the fastest-growing demographic group. As an example, 
consider a married couple in which both people are age 62 today. 
There’s a 95 percent chance at least one of them will live to age 
75, and a 65 percent chance at least one will live to age 85, accord-
ing to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston University. 
There’s a 40 percent chance at least one spouse will live to 90, and 
a 15 percent chance one will live to 95 or older. 
 
A retirement of 20 years will be routine for those retiring in their 
early to mid 60s today. A significant number will be retired for 30 
years and longer. Some may even spend more time in retirement 
than they did working.
Miscalculating Inflation
Inflation is a slow, steady destroyer of wealth, and too many folks 
overlook its effects on their retirement plans. During their working 
years, most people receive regular salary increases that keep pace 
with inflation, and sometimes they’re promoted or switch jobs so 
that their incomes increase faster than inflation.
All that ends with retirement. Too often, folks estimate their living 
expenses in the first year of retirement and conclude that their 
portfolios can support that level of spending for their life expec-
tancies. They overlook how inflation will eat away the purchasing 
power of that income. They have to increase the withdrawals from 

395
 Chapter 17: Ten Common Retirement and Estate Planning Mistakes
their savings over time to maintain their standard of living. You 
may not need to increase your amount of spending each year — 
some items will rise in price while others fall each year — but over 
time prices overall are likely to rise.
 
The value of each dollar of your income declines more each year 
even with low inflation. A little time with a calculator or spread-
sheet reveals how the combination of inflation and longer life 
expectancies can cripple a retirement plan, even when inflation is 
relatively low.
For example, at an inflation rate of just 2 percent annually, after 
ten years you need more than $12,200 to have the purchasing 
power that $10,000 had at the start. After 15 years, you need about 
$13,500 of withdrawals for the purchasing power of $10,000 you 
spent at the start of retirement. Twenty years raises the equivalent 
withdrawal need to $14,850. These numbers reveal only the effects 
of the reduced purchasing power of the dollar resulting from infla-
tion. Increased withdrawals also may be needed because of new 
expenses, such as higher spending on medical care.
 
To some extent, you can compensate for higher prices by cutting 
back and making substitutions. You can drive a less expensive car 
or eat fewer restaurant meals and travel less, for example. And if oil 
prices soar as they did in 2007–2008, you can choose the least 
expensive modes of transportation for traveling or postpone trips a 
year or two until prices drop back down. But some of these acts 
reduce your standard of living, and you can cut only so much.
Believing You’ll Retire 
When You Expected To
Retirement has a lot of uncertainty, but one thing most people 
think they have control over is when, and even if, they’ll retire. 
Some people have a certain age in mind for retirement. Others say 
they’ll retire when they feel like it or are tired of their jobs. Still 
others say they’ll never retire or will shift to part-time work before 
completely retiring.

396
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The truth is that for many people the date of retirement is out of 
their control. A McKinsey & Co. survey found that 40 percent of 
current retirees had stopped working before they planned to. The 
main reasons for earlier-than-planned retirement are health and 
layoffs. (See Chapter 3 for more information.)
Today you may be healthy, like your job, and plan to work for 
a long time. But an accident or major illness could render you 
unable to continue your current job, or any job, full time. In the 
worst case, you may be unable to work at any job.
Of course, you may be able to retire sooner than you thought pos-
sible because of good fortune such as a successful entrepreneurial 
venture or the result of long-term investment returns. Some folks 
inherit more money than they expected. 
 
You need to plan for contingencies, including having to retire 
before your target date. You should expect change. You should 
have disability insurance in case your health forces early retire-
ment (as we discuss in Chapter 3). You also must be ready to 
change your spending and investment plans in case retirement 
comes early with no way to replace your paycheck.
Ignoring Nonfinancial Planning
In this book, we focus on helping you become and remain finan-
cially independent in your senior years. Financial independence 
can make retirement easier and make a satisfying retirement more 
likely. But your finances aren’t the only things to focus on during 
retirement planning — and they may not even be the most impor-
tant contributor to a successful retirement. The evidence is that 
other factors greatly influence both your happiness in retirement 
and your longevity. So don’t overlook nonfinancial matters when 
planning your retirement.
The following are the nonfinancial keys that we’ve observed to be 
key to a successful retirement:
 
✓ Relationships with other people: Maintaining relationships is 
important to your health, longevity, and happiness. Various 

397
 Chapter 17: Ten Common Retirement and Estate Planning Mistakes
medical studies and surveys of senior Americans reach that 
conclusion. People who have regular interactions and relation-
ships with others tend to be happier and live longer. The rela-
tionships can be with family, people your own age, or those of 
different ages. They can be through work, organized groups 
and clubs, or informal associations.
 
✓ Doing things you enjoy: The original prototype for retirement 
was a period of pure leisure. That may have been appropriate 
when retirement was relatively short. However, with today’s 
extended retirement and people staying active and healthy 
longer, most folks need a sense of purpose to be satisfied. 
Luckily, you can choose from a number of ways to establish a 
sense of purpose, including work, volunteering, hobbies, and 
competitive leisure activities. Being active also keeps your 
mind sharper and healthier. Activities that get you learning 
new things seem to be important to avoiding mental impair-
ments such as dementia.
 
✓ Flexibility: Your retirement is likely to last 20 years or longer. 
And, of course, your needs and interests are likely to change 
during that time. So your retirement plan should be flexible 
enough to allow you to change activities.
Financial independence is a tool to help you spend time doing the 
things you really want to do. It isn’t an end in itself and shouldn’t 
be the main focus of your time. Part of your retirement planning 
should be devoted to how you spend your time.
Failing to Coordinate 
with Your Spouse
When you’re married, you don’t retire alone, and your retirement 
plans affect your spouse as much as they do you. When one spouse 
retires, the adjustment is often as great for the other spouse as it 
is for the retiring spouse. Remarkably, many people don’t seem to 
realize this, and a number of couples don’t discuss retirement plans 
with each other in detail. Make sure you avoid this mistake and 
coordinate your retirement plan with your spouse.

398
Part V: The Part of Tens 
A Fidelity Couples Retirement Study conducted by Richard Day 
Research had some interesting findings:
 
✓ Sixty-one percent of spouses disagreed on what their primary 
income source in retirement would be.
 
✓ Forty-one percent disagreed about whether at least one 
spouse would work in retirement.
 
✓ In 39 percent of couples, the spouses had different answers 
about the amount of life insurance coverage they had.
 
✓ Thirty-five percent gave different answers about their 
expected retirement ages.
 
✓ Only 38 percent worked together on retirement financial 
planning.
 
✓ Fifty-eight percent disagreed about who the surviving spouse 
would ask for financial advice after the other spouse passed 
away.
Check out Chapter 3 for more information about discussions you 
should have with your spouse when setting up your estate plan.
Expecting to Age in Place
One of the great myths of retirement is that everyone moves to 
Florida or Arizona after retiring. The truth is that most people stay 
in the same general area they lived in during the decades before 
retirement. High percentages of older Americans say they would 
like to remain in the same home, or “age in place,” as long as possi-
ble. While understandable, the goal often isn’t practical. You need 
to consider certain issues, such as cost and effort of maintaining 
the home and the challenge of living in a larger home. Chapter 8 
has information to help you with housing decisions.
 
Aging in place is an understandable goal. But it isn’t possible for 
everyone. You must plan to make it work and realize that reaching 
the goal is likely to increase the cost of retirement.
When aging in place, you take on a couple significant responsibili-
ties with your larger home:

399
 Chapter 17: Ten Common Retirement and Estate Planning Mistakes
 
✓ The cost and effort of maintaining the home: For many people, 
the home they live in when they retire is the one in which they 
raised their families. So the home likely has a number of bed-
rooms and other rooms that are no longer used regularly. The 
extra space is nice when the kids and grandkids come for a 
visit, but that doesn’t happen often in most families. The cost 
and effort of maintaining the home at some point may exceed 
the benefits. In addition to the cost of maintaining a home that’s 
larger than needed, many seniors find that rising property taxes 
become more of a burden than they want to bear.
 
✓ The challenge of living in the home: Most homes people 
live in at retirement aren’t built for people who want to age 
in place. In other words, they aren’t senior friendly. At some 
point most people become less mobile and more prone to 
slips and falls. Also, arthritis and other conditions can make 
simple tasks such as opening doors and cabinets difficult. 
Many of these difficulties can be overcome by having the 
home refitted to be senior friendly. However, a refit can be 
expensive and time consuming.
 
 Having your home refitted for senior living before you actually 
need the changes is a good idea. You can plan the changes you 
want and shop for good prices from contractors. You also may 
be able to do a lot of the work yourself. Too many people wait 
until their physical condition changes and then they need the 
changes made in a hurry.
Thinking Most Medical Expenses 
Will Be Covered
Another of the myths that many folks believe is that most medical 
expenses in retirement will be covered by insurance or the govern-
ment. Some think their employers will continue some version of 
their medical insurance coverage into retirement. Others believe 
Medicare covers everything for beneficiaries or is similar to the 
employer coverage they’re used to.
Don’t fall into this trap and make this mistake. In retirement, 
you’re on your own for a great deal of your medical expenses and 

400
Part V: The Part of Tens 
for long-term care. A reasonable estimate of your different health 
expenditures and how they’ll be paid or insured needs to be part 
of your retirement plan.
 
Fewer and fewer employers offer any medical expense insurance or 
coverage for their retirees. Generally only large employers, espe-
cially those whose employees are unionized, offer retiree medical 
coverage. Those employers that do offer medical plans to their 
retirees have steadily reduced the coverage over the years. Almost 
all retiree medical plans reserve the right to change the terms at 
any time, no matter how long a beneficiary has been retired.
During your senior years, you need to consider the following:
 
✓ Medicare (check out Chapter 11)
 
✓ Medicaid (refer to Chapter 12)
 
✓ Long-term care (see Chapter 9)
Missing the Initial Enrollment 
for Medicare Plans
The Medicare eligibility rules can be confusing, especially regard-
ing the procedure and the timing for enrollment. The result of this 
confusion is that too many people pay penalties for signing up 
late. So you want to make sure you don’t miss any initial enroll-
ment dates for the different Medicare plans. Chapter 11 walks you 
through the entire Medicare process and what you need to know.
 
You’re eligible for Medicare when you turn 65 and are eligible for 
Social Security (see Chapter 10). This rule is one of the main causes 
of confusion. You must be eligible for Social Security to be eligible 
for Medicare. But Medicare enrollment isn’t tied to when you begin 
receiving Social Security benefits. You can begin Social Security as 
early as age 62. You should begin Social Security no later than age 
70, because you don’t receive increased benefits by delaying Social 
Security any longer. But you’re first eligible to enroll in Medicare at 
65, regardless of when your Social Security benefits begin.

Working in Retirement
In This Chapter
▶ Considering your options for working during retirement
▶ Making the most of your retirement even if you are working
Y
ou may envision a life during retirement as being one where 
you completely stop working. Then you can sit back, relax, 
and really enjoy life. 
Unfortunately this scenario is only a dream for some people. Due 
to a wide variety of reasons ranging from unexpected medical bills 
to sub-par investment returns, you may have to keep on working 
during your retirement years in some capacity — whether it be part-
time or seasonal work or even a full-time job in another career. You 
may also find that “retirement” isn’t what you bargained for and that 
you miss interacting with others and getting out of the house.
The good news is that some employers offer part-time work, which 
allows you to potentially have some of the best aspects of your 
working life (money coming in and contact with people) combined 
with some of the best aspects of retired life (more free time and 
less stress). In addition, many companies permit (even encourage) 
workers to telecommute (work from home). For those of you who 
want or need to continue to work on a full-time basis, this may be 
an attractive option.
If you find yourself in a situation where you may want to or need to 
work during your golden years, you’re not alone. This chapter dis-
cusses some important pointers for you to consider when working 
during what are normally considered retirement years.

402
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Some Work Is Good for You
If you enjoy the people you work with, continuing to work at least 
part time may be worth your while. Some research actually sup-
ports potential health benefits for those folks who stay active in 
the workforce.
Researchers Yujie Zhan, Mo Wang, Songqi Liu, and Kenneth 
Shultz, analyzed data from more than 12,000 participants in the 
national Health and Retirement Study. Their review of the health 
records of retirees, which controlled for people’s health status 
pre-retirement, found that retirees who move from a full-time job 
to part-time work enjoy better health than folks who cease work-
ing completely. Specifically, those who transition to part-time work 
had fewer major diseases and were found to function better with 
day-to-day activities than those who stop working altogether.
 
We should point out one nuance of the study: The best health as a 
group was observed in those who continued part-time work in the 
same field or line of work they had worked in full time. Workers 
who changed careers, which the study’s authors found happened 
more with retirees’ struggling financially, didn’t enjoy the improved 
health status of the part-time workers who didn’t change fields. The 
study’s authors reasoned that career changers trying to make more 
money may have had more stress than those who chose to con-
tinue with their previous line of work.
The Social Security (Tax) 
Impact Can Be Huge
Before you set out to work in your golden years, you had better 
understand the tax bite you may have to pay on your Social 
Security benefits. And these days, plenty of retirees — about one-
third — get whacked with federal income taxes on these benefits.

403
 Chapter 18: Ten Things to Know About Working in Retirement
You’ll owe federal income taxes on your Social Security benefits 
if your other income (from work including self-employment 
income, interest, dividends, and other taxable income that must 
be reported on your tax return) exceeds certain thresholds. Here 
are the guidelines to keep in mind:
 
✓ Single taxpayers with a combined income between $25,000 
and $34,000, and married couples filing jointly with combined 
income between $32,000 and $44,000, have to pay income tax 
on up to 50 percent of their benefits. (Combined income is 
defined as your adjusted gross income plus nontaxable inter-
est plus one-half of your Social Security benefits.)
 
✓ Singles with a combined income of more than $34,000, and 
married couples filing jointly with a combined income of more 
than $44,000, may pay income tax on up to 85 percent of their 
benefits.
 
The effective tax rate on that “extra” employment income can end 
up being huge if you get whacked with taxation of your Social 
Security benefits. Between regular federal and state income taxes 
on the additional employment earnings and the taxation of your 
Social Security benefits, you may see half or more of your extra 
income siphoned off to pay taxes — ouch! (For more on this impor-
tant issue and related decisions, refer to Chapter 10.)
Number Crunching Can Show You 
How Different Scenarios Work
Some folks who approach retirement short of funds resign them-
selves to continuing to work full time in their pursuit of income. 
This scenario isn’t always necessary, however. If you haven’t 
crunched some numbers and considered all your options, you may 
be missing a better approach.

404
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
For starters, be sure to examine how your expenses may change 
if you were to work part time rather than full time. Perhaps you 
would spend less eating meals out or on other services if you 
weren’t so pressed for time. Your commuting costs likely will 
decrease as well. Also, closely examine the spending side of your 
ledger. It may be easier for you to reduce your expenses than to 
work so many hours for so many more years. If you’re a home-
owner, crunch some numbers to determine whether tapping your 
home equity can help finance your retirement.
Do What You Love
Life is short, so if you have to work during your later years, make 
sure you do it in a job you enjoy. We’re not suggesting that you 
ignore financial considerations. But you owe it to yourself to do 
something you really like. Otherwise, the workdays will drag.
For example, Lloyd worked as a corporate trainer for many years, 
but the job lacked the proper spark to make him hop out of bed. 
Brainstorming with a friend one day about things he enjoyed 
doing, he spoke of his joy coaching and working with kids. Long 
story short, Lloyd became an educator in a small private school 
near his home. His pay was modest but he loved the work, sched-
ule, and vacation time the job allowed.
Investing in Education Can Boost 
Your Employment Value
Going back for some schooling can be a joy in and of itself, but fur-
thering your education also may enhance your employment value. 
Of course, with more of your career behind rather than ahead of 
you, you should compare the expected benefit to the costs of fur-
thering your education and training.

405
 Chapter 18: Ten Things to Know About Working in Retirement
Where can you find educational opportunities? Check out so 
called “adult” or “continuing” education divisions of colleges and 
universities within a reasonable driving distance of your home 
or from reputable institutions online. Targeted training seminars 
may make sense for you as well. When in doubt, ask prospective 
employers and contacts you have in the industry what education 
and training is best given your job interests.
Some Employers Are More User-
Friendly for Older Workers
If you need or want to work during retirement, look for employ-
ers that are open to older workers. You may choose to stay within 
your chosen career but change employers for any number of 
reasons. Perhaps you can be paid more, have more interesting 
responsibilities, or gain a better boss.
AARP, which is a nonprofit membership organization for people age 
50 and older publishes an annual listing of employers — called the 
“Best Employers for Workers Over 50” — that it views as providing 
the best work environment for older workers. For more information, 
visit www.aarp.org/money/work/best_employers/best_
employers_list_2009/.
Taking Some Employment 
Risk Is Important
As most individuals age, they generally take fewer risks. Quitting 
your job and doing something completely different when you’re 22 
years old and single is one thing. But it’s quite another to contem-
plate the same move at age 52, especially if you have dependents 
and are still accumulating your retirement fund.

406
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The amount and type of risk you can take with regard to work in 
your retirement years should depend on your financial situation 
and other factors, such as your health, desire to travel, and so on. 
For example, have you dreamed of changing careers your whole 
life but never could bring yourself to take the plunge? Don’t live 
your life in such a way that you’ll look back with regret at not 
having taken some chances to pursue something you really would 
rather have done.
Examine Starting/Buying 
a Small Business
Among the riskier but potentially most rewarding (emotionally and 
financially) work options would be for you to start or buy a small 
business. Older workers are successful with this venture because 
they can draw on their many years of work and life experiences as 
well as the contacts they’ve accumulated over the years.
 
Be fully informed as to what you’re getting yourself into before you 
make the final commitment. Make sure that you are willing and 
able to devote the time and effort most businesses require. And, 
be sure you can afford the required financial drain to go this route.
Your Spouse May Not 
Want What You Want
Many couples fail to adequately discuss what changes they’re 
considering in their working lives as they head into their retire-
ment years. For example, your spouse may be assuming that you’ll 
have lots of free time to travel and do other things, but you may be 
envisioning working 30 hours per week and playing more golf. You 
want to make sure you and your spouse are on the same wave-
length when it comes to retirement and whether the two of you 
will work.

407
 Chapter 18: Ten Things to Know About Working in Retirement
 
We can’t stress enough how important it is that you and your 
spouse or significant other are thinking along the same lines and 
have the same expectations regarding your retirement. To avoid 
any unnecessary stress and bickering, schedule some time to dis-
cuss your retirement expectations and dreams with your spouse. 
You may even go so far as taking some notes and to clarify your dif-
ferent points of view. Then you can use those notes at a follow-up 
discussion. At a minimum, you should extend your spouse the cour-
tesy of disclosing your intentions and hopes and know going in how 
your spouse feels about your plans.
Volunteering Makes You Happy 
and Benefits Your Community
If you have no financial need to work for income, check out volun-
teer opportunities, which can provide many of the same benefits 
that paid work provides. Plenty of organizations and people in 
your community and around the nation could benefit from your 
time, interests, and expertise.
Check out these organizations and sources to find some opportu-
nities that fit your interests:

Ten (or So) Tips to Know About 
Caring for Your Aging Parents
In This Chapter
▶ Reaching out for help when caring for your parents
▶ Prioritizing your to-do list to stay sane and keep everyone healthy and 
happy
A
s your parents age, they’ll need more of your assistance. If 
you’ve had an elderly parent with major medical problems, we 
don’t have to tell you this. We also hear about the so-called “sand-
wich generation” which refers to folks who are caring for elderly 
parents while still raising their own families. The reality is that this 
isn’t a new situation; prior generations experienced it too. Actually, 
the fact that life expectancies have increased means that some 
people finish raising their children before their elderly parents need 
high levels of assistance. Although other people (such as singles 
and childless couples) don’t face this squeeze, they still have all the 
challenges that come with their parents becoming frail.
In this chapter, we highlight tips for what you can do during retire-
ment if you find yourself planning your own retirement while 
caring for aging parents. These tips ensure that you cope without 
your efforts becoming a depressing, full-time endeavor.

410
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Leverage Off Others’ Experiences
If you find yourself in the situation of having to care for elderly 
parents, the good news is that you can take comfort from shared 
experiences. You can know that millions of others are dealing with 
or have dealt with similar issues. If you begin feeling a bit over-
whelmed, take a deep breath, and then take a few moments to get 
to know others who are sharing your challenges.
 
How can you find these folks? One terrific starting point is to 
contact the outreach coordinator or social worker at local senior 
centers. For example, suppose you have a parent suffering from 
Alzheimer’s disease or other dementia. You can join a support group 
that focuses on that issue. The local senior center may run such 
groups or may be able to refer you to them. Also, talk to others you 
know. You may be surprised how many friends and family members 
have been down the same road and are caring for elderly parents.
Ask for Professional Help
Don’t try to do everything yourself. Tap social service agencies. 
For example, check out the following professional organizations 
that can provide some help:
 
✓ The National Association of Professional Geriatric Care 
Managers: This organization can help you find an eldercare 
advocate or geriatric care manager. Visit www.caremanager.
org or call 520-881-8008.
 
✓ The Administration on Aging (AoA): This federal government 
agency is part of the Department of Health and Human Services 
and is responsible for advancing the concerns and interests of 
older people and their caregivers. AoA works with the Aging 
Services Network to promote the development of a comprehen-
sive and coordinated system of home and community-based 
long-term care. You can find out more at www.aoa.gov or by 
calling 202-619-0724. Of particular interest is AoA’s Eldercare 
Locator, which you can use at www.eldercare.gov or by call-
ing 800-677-1116.

 Chapter 19: Ten (or So) Tips to Know About Caring for Your Aging Parents
 
You can find plenty of programs at all levels of government, but the 
governments rarely advertise them. Digging a little can provide 
helpful resources you may not otherwise have found.
Invest in Their Health
Be proactive about assessing your parents’ health situation and 
what can be done to make the most of it. Also encourage your 
parents to be proactive about managing their own health rather 
than reacting after a problem is uncovered. That said, remember 
to be sensitive to their privacy and their own desires. Focus on 
your concern that their health be the best that it can be. Avoid 
taking control of their health care decisions, unless they’re truly 
incapable of doing so themselves. (If they are incapable of making 
those decisions, see our discussion in Chapter 14 about important 
health care documents that can assist you in making health care 
decisions on your parents’ behalf.)
Get Your Parents’ Affairs in Order
Most people could think of 100 things, perhaps even a 1,000 things, 
they’d rather do than get their affairs in order for their passing. 
Contemplating one’s mortality usually isn’t an enjoyable activity, 
especially if you’re in good health. This book helps you get your 
affairs in order. Why not do the same with your parents?
 
When prodding and encouraging your parents to get their affairs in 
order, be careful not to let your best intentions be misinterpreted 
by your folks or other family members. For example, perhaps your 
parents have neglected to complete a will and an estate plan. 
Although you may not have the slightest selfish interest in inherit-
ing some of their money and assets, other family members may 
have a different take on your intentions when you encourage them 
to complete an estate plan. Be sensitive to their feelings and pri-
vacy regarding their finances and what happens with their estate 
upon their passing.

412
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Examine Housing and 
Medical Care Options
As your parents age (and, ultimately, as you age), be careful not to 
quickly leap to conclusions as to what type of housing and medi-
cal care is best for the situation. Although your decisions may be 
based on years or even decades of prior observations and think-
ing, there’s no substitute for casting a wide net and considering an 
array of options and their pros and cons.
Reading this book is an excellent starting point. (Chapter 8 specifi-
cally deals with housing decisions.) You also can supplement our 
information and get more detailed, on-the-ground, local flavor by 
speaking with a range of medical professionals and other folks who 
regularly work with the elderly.
Use Caregiver Agreements
In many families, younger members help care for older members 
for at least a brief period. Care can take several forms. Each form 
that we discuss in the following list has financial and tax conse-
quences. Families should pay attention to the details and rules 
partly to ensure they receive maximum benefits and partly so each 
member will feel he or she is treated fairly. Here’s the lowdown on 
the two forms of care:
 
✓ Financial: This type of care could involve financial help for 
at-home services or residence at an assisted living or other 
facility. When financial assistance is provided, tax benefits 
may be available. For example, it may be possible to claim a 
dependency exemption for the relative or to deduct medical 
expenses paid on his behalf.
 
 Even when one family member cares for another, some type of 
financial exchange may take place. Sometimes the caregiver is 
paid directly and on a regular basis. Other times an agreement

 Chapter 19: Ten (or So) Tips to Know About Caring for Your Aging Parents
 
✓ Personal: This type of care could involve personally provid-
ing a person’s needs in either the caretaker’s home or in the 
cared-for person’s home. Because personally caring for a family 
member can get sticky, it has some special requirements. For 
this reason, we focus on this type of care in this section.
When a family member is a personal caregiver for another, you 
should create a written caregiver agreement. The agreement, which 
should be discussed with all involved parties, ensures that everyone 
in the family knows the terms and has no misunderstandings and 
that tax benefits are maximized. An agreement is important in every 
case, but it’s especially important when the caregiver has siblings.
 
While having the caregiver agreement drafted, be sure the person 
being cared for has an estate plan, including a financial power of 
attorney, medical care power of attorney, will, and other appropri-
ate documents. (See Chapter 14 for more on these documents.)
When a family member cares for another and is being financially 
compensated, the payments aren’t tax-free gifts. The written 
agreement helps stop the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from 
considering the transfers gifts. This is important because gifts 
above the annual exclusion amount ($13,000 in 2010) are tax-
able or reduce the lifetime gift and estate tax credit of the parent 
receiving care. Any payments are compensation for services and 
must be included in the gross income of the recipient. This is 
true whether the payments are made periodically like a salary, in 
a lump sum, or as an additional inheritance.
Separate Living Spaces if Parents 
Are Going to Move In
Some people choose to have a parent come to live with them. In 
the best cases, this works well and enables more frequent contact 
for shorter periods of time. Grandparents can see their grandkids 
and help care for them occasionally. In the worst cases, however,

Part V: The Part of Tens 
spouses end up at odds over the lack of boundaries and the inter-
ruption of family time by the care needs of an elderly relative.
 
Moving a parent into your own home is a big decision that all par-
ties should thoroughly discuss. At a minimum, we recommend that 
you have available separate living space, with a separate entrance 
and privacy, to help make this work.
Take Care of Your Family
Between work and other commitments, you may feel overwhelmed 
when caring for your elderly parents. But do remember to take 
care of your immediate family (spouse and dependent children). 
Neglecting a spouse may happen easily because you may feel that 
he or she doesn’t really need your assistance the way a frail parent 
does or the way a young child does. But, your spouse still needs 
and deserves your love and affection even though he or she likely 
doesn’t need your support for daily living.
Of course, there will be times, such as a hospitalization, when your 
elderly parents need more of your help and attention. Most fami-
lies expect and understand this. Your own family should be under-
standing of short-term absences and periods when you have less 
free time for them.
Take Care of Yourself
As you care for all your loved ones, don’t neglect yourself. The 
best givers often tend to really neglect their own needs and their 
own health. Think back to the last time you were traveling by 
plane and the flight attendant advised putting on your own oxygen 
mask before assisting your kids. This advice makes sense because 
you’ll be better able to help others when you’re stronger.
