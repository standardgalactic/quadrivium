About the Authors
Charlie Nardozzi has worked for more than 20 years bringing expert 
gardening information to home gardeners through radio, television, and 
the printed page. He delights in making gardening information simple, easy, 
fun, and accessible to everyone. His energy, exuberance, and love of the 
natural world also make Charlie an exciting public speaker and presenter. 
He currently is the senior horticulturist and spokesperson for the National 
Gardening Association (NGA). He also writes the National News as part of 
NGA’s online publications, conducts media interviews about gardening and 
NGA, and provides horticultural consultation to NGA programs.
For 12 years Charlie was an editor with National Gardening magazine, 
writing stories on a variety of gardening topics from roses to tomatoes. He 
also has written for national magazines such as Organic Gardening, authored 
the fi rst edition of Vegetable Gardening For Dummies in 1999 and The Ultimate 
Gardener in 2009, and contributed to other books such as Gardening All-in-
One For Dummies (2003) and the Better Homes and Gardens’ Yard and Garden 
Owner’s Manual (Meredith Books, 2004).
Charlie’s skills as a garden communicator extend beyond the printed page, 
however. In 2005, he was the host of PBS’s television program Garden Smart, 
which reaches more than 60 million households. He also has been a garden-
ing expert on many nationally syndicated television shows, such as HGTV’s 
Today at Home and Way to Grow, Discovery Channel’s Home Matters, and 
DIY’s Ask DIY. He has appeared on QVC and the Home Shopping Network as 
well. At his home in Vermont, Charlie co-hosts the program “In The Garden,” 
which offers weekly gardening tips on the local CBS affi liate television 
station, a weekly call-in gardening radio show on a local AM station, and 
gardening commentaries on public radio. He also hosts national and 
international gardening tours.
The National Gardening Association, founded in 1972, is a national not-
for-profi t leader in plant-based education, esteemed for its award-winning 
Web sites and newsletters, grants and curriculum for youth gardens, and 
research for the lawn-and-garden industry. NGA’s mission is to advance the 
personal, community, and educational benefi ts of gardening by supporting 
gardeners, communities, and teachers with information and resources. For

Dedication
I’d like to dedicate this book to everyone who has ever thought about 
vegetable gardening or tried to grow some of their own food. I particularly 
want to dedicate this book to my wife, Wendy, who is the best partner in the 
garden and in my life.
Author’s Acknowledgments
I’d like to thank Mike Baker and Stacy Kennedy for sticking with this book 
idea and pursuing it so it fi nally became a reality. A big thanks goes to 
Georgette Beatty for her keen insights when reading this book and her 
organizational ability to keep the ball rolling. I appreciated Jessica Smith’s 
thoughtful questions as the copy editor, especially because she’s a budding 
vegetable gardener herself! Jim Schmidt kept me honest in the horticultural 
realm with his suggestions as the technical reviewer. Kathryn Born provided 
excellent updated illustrations. Suzanne DeJohn, my colleague at NGA, 
provided many beautiful color photos of vegetables and gardening tech-
niques that make the words come to life.

Introduction
E
veryone loves good food. Fresh, tasty, nutritious food is our birthright. 
And what better way to have great food than to grow it yourself? You 
don’t have to be a farmer to do so either. Whether it be a plot of land in the 
yard that’s tilled up to grow vegetables, a few vegetables planted amongst 
your flowers and shrubs, or containers loaded with attractive, edible choices, 
growing your own food is a satisfying and rewarding activity.
Vegetable gardening isn’t rocket science either. Heck, people have been growing 
their own vegetables for thousands of years. Like any pursuit, you just need 
some direction, good advice, and inspiration to get started. Vegetable Gardening 
For Dummies, 2nd Edition, is for anyone who already grows vegetables or 
who has ever dreamed of growing some of their own food. All it takes is some 
resolve to get started. You’re already halfway there just by picking up this book!
About This Book
In this book, you can find all the basic information you need to grow a vege-
table garden. It’s great to read the book from front cover to back cover, but 
each section and chapter is complete in itself. So feel free to browse the vege-
tables or topics that you want to focus on first. I’ve been vegetable gardening 
my whole life, so throughout the book I try to impart some practical wisdom 
that’s easily accessible. I also include some special tips and tricks that I’ve 
learned over the years and information on hundreds of vegetable varieties, 
many of which are beautiful to look at as well as tasty to eat. Of course, none 
of this matters if you can’t grow the vegetables successfully. That’s why a 
large part of this book is devoted to building soil, starting seeds, maintaining 
the garden, controlling pests, growing through the seasons, and harvesting. 
I like to encourage happy, healthy, successful gardeners who are willing to 
experiment, make mistakes, and enjoy sharing their bounty with their friends, 
family, and neighbors.
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate this book, I include the following conventions:
 
✓ All references to temperature are in degrees Fahrenheit. As a reminder, 
I include the label with the first reference in each chapter. After that, I 
save space (and paper!) by leaving it out.

2
Vegetable Gardening For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
 
✓ Variety names for each vegetable are indicated by single quotation 
marks. These are the common names you’ll see when buying vegetable 
seeds and plants.
 
✓ Italics highlight new terms (which I define right away) and the Latin 
names of vegetables, which I use only when necessary.
 
✓ Boldfaced text highlights the keywords of bulleted lists and the action 
part of numbered steps.
 
✓ Web addresses appear in monofont.
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to break 
across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that I haven’t put 
in any extra characters to indicate the break. So, when using one of these 
Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see in this book, pretending as 
though the line break doesn’t exist.
What You’re Not to Read
I may think every word I’ve written on vegetable gardening in this book is 
intriguing, but I realize you have a life and may want to just get on with it. If you 
want only the basics, keep in mind that sidebars (in shaded gray boxes) and 
information tagged with the Technical Stuff icon aren’t necessary to your basic 
understanding of vegetable growing and can be skipped, if you really have to.
Foolish Assumptions
Before I even put one word to the page, I was thinking about who may read 
this book. Here’s what I assume about you, the reader:
 
✓ You want to create a vegetable garden that’s filled with healthy, 
nutritious, beautiful plants to eat.
 
✓ You want to understand the basics of vegetable gardening and, for 
experienced gardeners, find new tricks to help you garden better.
 
✓ You want to grow vegetables in an environmentally friendly manner.
 
✓ You want to try vegetable gardening even if you only have a deck or 
patio to grow a few plants.
 
✓ You want to share your love of gardening with friends, family members, 
and neighbors because you feel that if more people grew some of their 
own food, the world would be a better place.

 Introduction
How This Book Is Organized
Like all For Dummies books, this book is broken into parts. Each part has a 
number of chapters related to a theme. Here’s an overview to get you oriented 
with the organization.
Part I: Digging Into the Basics 
of Vegetable Gardening
Vegetable gardening is about more than just growing tasty food. You can find 
many other reasons and benefits of vegetable gardening, and I explain them 
in this part. I also cover information you need to know to plan your garden, 
such as determining the importance of sun and soil, deciding what to grow, 
and exploring some sample garden designs.
Part II: Vegging Out
Each chapter in this part explores vegetables grouped by botanical family 
(such as the squash family) or commonality (such as root crops). Each 
chapter is loaded with the best varieties to grow and specifics on how to 
grow them. I also provide information to help combat specific pests that may 
attack each crop. Chapter 12 is all about other edibles, such as berries and 
herbs. Food comes in many forms, and berries and herbs are some of the 
easiest and most reliable producers in your yard.
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty 
in Your Vegetable Garden
Now for the good stuff: building your garden and getting it growing. In this 
part, I talk about starting seeds; improving your soil; maintaining your garden 
with proper watering, fertilizing, and mulching; using some extra-cool garden-
ing techniques, such as succession planting; applying pest and disease con-
trols; growing in containers; and harvesting and storage. Whew, that’s a lot of 
great information!
Part IV: The Part of Tens
This book wouldn’t be a For Dummies book without the always-popular Part 
of Tens. The final chapters in this book look at the ten best tools to get the 
job done and nearly ten great season-extending techniques that enable you to 
garden earlier in spring and later into fall.

Icons Used in This Book
Like all For Dummies books, this book has icons that highlight great tips, 
warnings, and other specific topics. Here are the ones in this book:
 
Are you interested in growing plants in containers? If so, look for these icons 
throughout the book.
 
One of the best parts of vegetable gardening is involving kids. This icon marks 
plants that kids love or special gardening tips you can try with your little ones.
 
This icon highlights important information that helps you garden better. Don’t 
forget this stuff!
 
If you want to go a little deeper in your knowledge of a plant or technique, 
read information marked with this icon.
 
This icon highlights information that saves time and money. Even experienced 
gardeners can learn something from these tidbits!
 
Sometimes you can make mistakes in the garden, and that’s okay. To help mini-
mize your mistakes, this icon alerts you to potential pitfalls.
Where to Go from Here
Start with the basics by taking in the information in Part I about seeds, plants, 
soil, your site, and garden planning. Then dive into your list of dream vegetables 
that you want to grow in your garden. Come back to the book periodically 
throughout the growing season to find out more about pest solutions in 
Chapter 17 and season extending in Chapter 21. And don’t forget to keep 
harvesting the fruits of all your fine work.
This is just the beginning of your vegetable garden experience. Many 
resources are available for vegetable gardeners (the appendix can get you 
started). The key is to get started and keep learning. After tasting one of your 
first homegrown peas, you’ll be hooked for life.

n this part, I get your vegetable gardening juices 
flowing. You first find out the environmental, social, 
and health reasons for growing some of your own food. 
Then you delve into planning your plot; I talk about the 
right sun, soil, and growing conditions for your vegetable 
garden and provide ideas for garden designs along with 
some samples.

I
’ve been vegetable gardening my whole life. I’ve followed my grandfather 
picking stones out of the potato patch, weeded my mother’s garden, 
taught my daughter to plant her first seeds, and built cold frames to maxi-
mize the amount of food my wife and I can grow in our yard with edible land-
scaping. I can attest that once you start, vegetable gardening becomes part of 
your life. It’s not surprising that it grows on you.
In this chapter, I start you off with basics on site preparation, and I tell you 
what to grow and how to grow it. All the details that follow in subsequent 
chapters build on the information you need to know to be a successful vege-
table gardener. Along the way I hope you are inspired to get some dirt under 
your fingernails and start your own garden. Dig in!
Why Have Your Own Vegetable Garden?
Over the years people had drifted away from vegetable gardening in the spirit 
of progress and affluence. However, more recently people are once again 
realizing that growing their own food, although not as critical to survival as 
it once was, is an important part of a healthy body, mind, spirit, lifestyle, and 
community. More people are again turning to vegetable gardening as a means 
of food and as a hobby. Even the president and first lady have installed a vege-
table garden at the White House. Vegetable gardening is officially back!
Who can resist the flavor, smell, and texture of food literally picked minutes 
before you eat it? It you’ve ever sunk your teeth into a sun-warmed, ripe 
tomato and felt the juices and flavors explode in your mouth, you’ll know 
what I mean.

Part I: Digging Into the Basics of Vegetable Gardening 
 
But vegetable gardening isn’t just about taste. It’s about safe food that’s pro-
duced close to home. It’s about knowing what has been sprayed on that food. It’s 
about feeding your friends and family nutritious food that’s high in vitamins and 
antioxidants (cancer-fighting compounds). It’s about connecting with your neigh-
bors and community as you experiment with ethnic dishes using exotic ingredi-
ents grown in your not-so-exotic backyard. It’s about reducing pollution and 
global warming by not buying produce that’s shipped hundreds of miles to your 
local grocery store. Finally it’s about reclaiming your ability to grow some of your 
own food, even if it’s a container of basil, to have a little more control in your life.
If you’re interested in finding out more about the popularity and benefits of 
vegetable gardening, be sure to check out Chapter 2.
The Basics of Planning a Veggie Garden
When’s the best time to start vegetable gardening? Right now! Here are the 
basics on how to decide where to grow yours:
 
✓ Find a spot close to the house that you walk by daily so you don’t forget 
about your project.
 
✓ Find a spot that gets at least 6 hours of direct sun a day.
 
✓ Find a spot that has great soil.
 
Keep your new garden small. You can be just as productive in a small raised bed 
garden, container, or small kitchen garden as you would be if you tilled your 
whole backyard. Start small, be successful, and then get bigger (if you want).
What should you put in your new garden? Well, you have many vegetable 
options when it comes to deciding what you can grow, so it’s going to be 
tough deciding which ones to plant. The most important rule I can tell you 
is to grow what you like to eat. Yes, folks, this is all about taste. So no matter 
what people say about how easy beans are to grow, don’t grow them if you 
hate to eat them. (Of course, after tasting fresh green beans from the garden, 
you may change your tune.) Grow a mix of varieties of favorite vegetables 
that you and your family will love. Also, try a few different ones to stretch 
your imagination.
Chapter 3 has plenty of pointers to help you plan your garden wisely.
A Cornucopia of Vegetables to Grow
You can grow many different types of vegetables in your yard — and not just 
in the backyard. These days veggies are pretty enough to be front and center. 

9
 Chapter 1: Vegetable Gardening 101
The following sections describe some of the most popular to get you started. 
Hopefully you have plenty of room!
Tomatoes
Tomatoes are the most popular vegetable grown — and for good reason. 
The difference between a vine-ripened fruit and one picked green, gassed, 
and shipped hundreds of miles to your grocery store is incomparable. You 
can choose from container varieties that produce fruit the size of a pea and 
giant plants that grow to the height of a garage and produce fruits the size of 
a softball! You can even grow varieties of tomatoes with fruits every color of 
the rainbow except blue (however, I wouldn’t be surprised to see that color 
someday either).
 
Tomatoes love the heat and sun and require fertile soil and support. Unless 
you’re growing the dwarf varieties, stakes, cages, trellises, teepees, and arbors 
are essential for keeping plants growing upright and strong. You only need a 
few plants to keep your family in tomatoes most of the summer. Chapter 4 has 
the full scoop on growing tomatoes.
Peppers and eggplants
Peppers and eggplants are related to tomatoes, but they’re a little more 
homogeneous in their plant size. However, what they lack in plant variety, 
they make up in fruit uniqueness. Pepper fruits come shaped as bells or as 
long and thin tubular shapes. Some are as sweet as candy and others are hot 
enough to burn your mouth.
Pepper fruits mostly start out green and end up red, but where they go, col-
orwise, in between is amazing. You can experiment with chocolate-, yellow-, 
ivory-, purple-, lavender-, and orange-colored fruits that can be eaten raw 
or used in a multitude of cooked dishes. Eggplants also have burst onto the 
scene with varieties that produce unique-colored fruits, including white, 
purple, striped, and even orange.
 
If you can grow a tomato, you can grow peppers and eggplants. They need 
similar growing conditions. Plus, I love them as ornamental edibles. Not only 
do they look good in flower beds and containers, but you can eat them too! 
Chapter 5 has more on peppers and eggplants.
Carrots, onions, and potatoes
Get to the root of the matter by growing carrots, onions, and potatoes. (I 
know, I couldn’t resist the play on words!) Carrots, onions, and potatoes 

10
Part I: Digging Into the Basics of Vegetable Gardening 
love cool soil and cool weather conditions. Start them in spring for an early 
summer crop or in summer to mature in fall. Here are a few fun facts on each 
group (Chapter 6 has more information):
 
✓ Carrots: Carrot varieties are either short and squat or long and thin. You 
can even get colors other than orange, including red, purple, yellow, and 
white. Because their seeds are so small and take a while to germinate, 
carrots can be difficult to get started. But once they’re growing you’ll 
soon be munching on roots.
 
✓ Onions: Onions are adapted to the north and south depending on the 
variety. Some are sweet and can be eaten out of hand, but others are 
pungent and best for cooking and storing in winter. You can grow onions 
from seed, sets (bulbs), or plants.
 
✓ Potatoes: Potatoes are an easy cool-season crop to grow because you 
plant part of the potato to get new plants. If you cover the tubers with 
soil, hill them up, and keep them watered, you’ll be rolling in spuds 
come summer.
Peas and beans
Peas and beans are like brothers. They’re in the same family and share simi-
lar traits, but in some ways they’re very different!
 
✓ Peas are cool-season-loving crops that produce either plump or flat pods 
depending on the variety. With some pea varieties you eat pods and all. 
With others you eat just the peas inside.
 
✓ Beans love the heat. They’re one of the easiest vegetables to grow. They 
come in bush and twining or pole bean forms.
 
Both are great vegetables in the garden because they require little fertilizer 
and care once they’re up and running. Chapter 7 has details.
Cucumbers, melons, pumpkins, and squash
I affectionately call cucumbers, melons, pumpkins, and squash the “viners.” 
They love to ramble about the garden, taking up space and producing loads 
of fruit. But even if you’re a small-space gardener, you can still grow these 
space hogs. Newer varieties of cucumbers, squash, and melons can fit in a 
small raised bed or even a container.
One common trait of these vegetables is that they need heat, water, fertil-
ity, and bees. Bees? Yes, bees. Most of these squash family crops need to be 
cross-pollinated to produce fruit, so bees are critical to success. If you’re 

11
 Chapter 1: Vegetable Gardening 101
growing other vegetables, flowers, and herbs, you’re sure to have some bees 
flying about to do the dirty work.
 
Some members of this veggie family can be prolific, so don’t plant lots of zuc-
chinis, cucumbers, and pumpkins. Then again, if you really want to share the 
harvest you can plant a bunch to give away!
Head to Chapter 8 for plenty of pointers on growing vining veggies.
Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, 
cabbage, and cauliflower
Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower are similar in how they 
grow and what they need to grow. However, their differences come in the 
parts you eat. Here’s the lowdown:
 
✓ After you pick the heads of cabbage and cauliflower, the plant is finished 
and stops producing.
 
✓ After you pick broccoli heads, you’ll keep getting more broccoli side 
shoots to eat all season long.
 
✓ Brussels sprouts are like your crazy Uncle Louis. He looks a little 
strange, and you don’t know where he came from. Brussels sprouts 
produce cabbagelike balls all along a straight stem. Keep picking the 
sprouts starting from the bottom to the top of the stalk and working up 
until it stops producing because of the cold.
This group of veggies is productive and serves as a great addition to a cool-
weather spring or fall garden. See Chapter 9 for more information.
Lettuce, spinach, Swiss chard, 
and specialty greens
If you’re looking for quick rewards, go straight to Chapter 10 and grow 
greens: lettuce, spinach, chard, and wild greens, such as dandelions. Because 
you don’t have to wait for greens to form fruits (you’re just eating the leaves), 
you can pick them as soon as your stomach rumbles and the leaves are big 
enough to munch. They mostly love cool weather, so start early in spring and 
then keep planting and harvesting.
 
Greens are one of the best container vegetables to grow because they’re easy 
and adaptable. You can mix and match lettuce varieties to produce different 
colors and textures that look beautiful and taste divine.

12
Part I: Digging Into the Basics of Vegetable Gardening 
An assortment of other great veggies
In the previous sections, I just touch the tip of the iceberg when it comes to 
what to grow for vegetable varieties. There are so many more vegetables to 
grow; all you have to do is wander down the produce aisles at the local gro-
cery store and think, do I like to eat that? Chapter 11 describes more than 30 
other vegetables to grow — from asparagus to turnips. Watch out or you may 
get hooked and start growing so many vegetables you’ll have to open a res-
taurant. Vegetable gardening really can become that much fun.
Non-vegetable edibles
Don’t limit yourself to growing just vegetables in the vegetable garden. That 
would be silly! Berries, such as blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries, 
and herbs, such as basil, parsley, and chives, are great additions to your 
yard. They produce fruit, spice up a meal, and look beautiful. Need some 
inspiration? Here are some suggestions:
 
✓ Consider having a strawberry patch in your garden.
 
✓ Landscape your yard with blueberry bushes or a hedge of raspberries.
 
✓ Mix herb plants around vegetable plants or give them their own space in 
the garden. Herbs also grow well in containers mixed with flowers. I love 
growing rosemary in a deck planter each year for the attractive foliage 
and the enticing aroma.
Chapter 12 has plenty of details on growing berries and herbs in an edible 
landscape.
Getting Down to Growing
Are you excited to grow some of your own food? Not so fast! You need a road-
map to get a successful start. Just like driving, if you get off in the wrong direc-
tion, it takes lots of time and effort to get back on course. So you have to start 
out with a plan and stick to it. The following sections are a quick run-through 
from seed to table of growing vegetables. After you read this section, head to 
the chapters in Part II for all the nitty-gritty details that will ensure success.
Choosing between seeds and transplants
The easiest way to start a new garden is to grow those vegetables that 
can be planted from seed directly into the soil. For veggies that are best 

13
 Chapter 1: Vegetable Gardening 101
transplanted, buy the transplants locally. (Some vegetables can go both ways, 
too.) Here’s a breakdown of the two groups:
 
✓ Some vegetables that can be sown directly into the ground as seeds 
include beans, peas, carrots, beets, and sweet corn.
 
✓ Some vegetables and herbs you can find in local garden centers as trans-
plants include tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, broccoli, cauliflower, 
cabbage, lettuce, cucumber, squash, basil, and parsley.
 
If you have a small garden, go with the transplants. If you’re growing a larger 
garden, you’ll find it less expensive to grow veggies from seed.
Chapter 13 has details on growing seeds versus growing transplants.
Working the soil
 
After you have your vegetable seeds or transplants ready to go, the tempta-
tion is to simply turn the soil and then plant. However, soil building is one of 
the most important parts of your gardening experience. Your soil needs to 
be fertile, loose, dried out, and relatively weed and rock free to grow the best 
crops. If you take care of the soil in your beds, it’ll take care of you by produc-
ing healthy, productive vegetables with few insect and disease problems.
Spend some time working the soil by hand or with a tiller. Amend it every 
year with compost to keep the fertility high and make it more workable. Test 
your soil to see if it needs other nutrients. Flip to Chapter 14 for more ways 
to coddle your soil.
Keeping your garden growing 
and enjoying the rewards
When your garden is up and running, you can lower your maintenance 
time and effort and raise your satisfaction level by doing the following (see 
Chapter 15 for the full scoop on maintenance):
 
✓ Mulch your beds.
 
✓ Water your plants deeply and consistently.
 
✓ Fertilize when necessary.
No matter how well you care for your garden, pests still may attack your 
plants. It’s best to grow insect- and disease-resistant varieties when possible. 
And be sure to create barriers to block pests from attacking, clean up the 

14
Part I: Digging Into the Basics of Vegetable Gardening 
garden well to remove overwintering insects and diseases, and only spray 
as a last resort. I provide more pointers on keeping your plants healthy in 
Chapter 17.
 
Finally, after all this serious stuff, comes the fun part: harvesting. Check the 
garden daily when plants are producing, and pick even if you don’t have room 
in the refrigerator. With many vegetable plants, the more fruits you pick, the 
more you’ll get. You always can give away the fresh produce to friends, family, 
and neighbors, so don’t stop picking. Chapter 19 has details on harvesting and 
storing your veggies.
Trying tips for an even bigger bounty
 
To go further with your vegetable garden, try a few of the following techniques 
that help improve production and yield:
 
✓ Use containers. Growing in containers allows you to grow plants longer 
into the season and position your plants in the sunniest, most protected 
spots around your house. See Chapter 18 for the dirt on container 
gardening.
 
✓ Practice cool farmer tricks, such as succession planting and inter-
planting. Succession planting allows you to grow three or more crops in 
one season from the same spot. Interplanting is where you plant quick-
maturing small plants, such as lettuce and radishes, around slow-
growing larger plants, such as tomatoes and broccoli. The small plants 
are harvested before the larger plants shade them out. See Chapter 16 
for more details.

Chapter 2
The Popularity and Benefits 
of Vegetable Gardening
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding why food gardening is a booming hobby
▶ Checking out a few advantages to food gardening
I
f you’re interested in growing your own food (of course you are; you’re 
reading this book!), welcome to the club. Vegetable, fruit, berry, and herb 
gardening (collectively called food gardening) is booming across the United 
States and around the world. Why, you ask? Simply put, people enjoy the 
many benefits from food gardening. In this chapter, I paint a picture of food 
gardening’s popularity in the United States and describe a few major advan-
tages of growing your own food.
Food Gardening: It’s 
Popping Up Everywhere
While food gardening is a great activity to do in your yard, it’s also part of a 
growing trend of people wanting to eat better, grow some of their own food, 
and have more control on the quality of their food supply. What better way to 
ensure that you eat healthy food than growing it yourself?
In early 2009, the National Gardening Association (NGA) completed a survey 
that characterized food gardening in the United States. Here’s what it found:
 
✓ Approximately 23 percent, or 27 million households, had a vegetable 
garden in 2008. That’s 2 million more than in 2007. The number of food 
gardeners increases to 31 percent, or 36 million households, if you 
include those people growing fruits, berries, and herbs.
 
✓ The average person spends about $70 on their food garden every year. 
(I wish I could keep my spending that low!) The total nationwide is $2.5 

16
Part I: Digging Into the Basics of Vegetable Gardening 
billion spent on food gardening. I explain what you gain from that $70 in 
comparison to what you’d spend at the grocery store later in this section.
 
✓ The average vegetable garden is 600 square feet, but 83 percent of the 
vegetable gardens are less than 500 square feet. Nearly half of all garden-
ers grow some vegetables in containers as well.
 
✓ The typical vegetable gardener is college educated, married, female, age 
45 or older, and has no kids at home. And almost 60 percent of vegetable 
gardeners have been gardening for less than five years.
 
✓ The typical reasons for vegetable gardening in order of importance are: 
to produce fresh food, to save money, to produce better-quality food, 
and to grow food you know is safe. (I go into detail on several important 
reasons to grow food later in this chapter.)
There you have it. Lots of food gardeners are out in their crops, and the num-
bers are growing faster than corn in July. You may grow only a small food 
garden, but when all the gardens are added together, the impact is enormous. 
Need more proof? Let me show you!
The gross national garden product (GNGP) is the combined amount of money 
that can be produced from America’s food gardens. Here’s how the NGA fig-
ured it out (time for some math fun!):
 
✓ About 36 million households grow vegetables, berries, fruits, and herbs. 
The average garden size is 600 square feet. The NGA estimates that you 
can produce about 1/2 pound of vegetables per square foot of garden 
per year. That’s about 300 pounds of vegetables in the average garden. 
The average price, in season, of vegetables is about $2 per pound, so 
the average vegetable garden produces $600 worth of produce. So, 
Americans invest an average of $70 to yield $600 worth of produce every 
year. Wow! That’s a good return in my book!
 
✓ When you figure the numbers nationally, 36 million households spend 
$2.5 billion to yield a GNGP of more than $21 billion worth of vegetables 
each year. That’s a stimulus plan I can live with! (You don’t believe it? Go 
to the section “Save some cash” later in this chapter to see how you can 
save that kind of money by growing your own vegetables.)
A Few Good Reasons to 
Grow Your Own Food
It’s almost predictable: When economic times are hard, people head to the 
garden. It happened in the 1920s with Liberty Gardens, in the 1940s with 
Victory Gardens, and in the 1970s with increases in oil and food prices. 
Similarly, with current concerns about food safety, global warming, carbon 

17
 Chapter 2: The Popularity and Benefits of Vegetable Gardening
footprints, and pollution, along with a desire to build a link to the Earth and 
our own neighborhoods, food gardening has become a simple and tasty solution.
 
Food gardens aren’t just in backyards anymore. People grow food in containers 
on decks and patios, in community gardens, at schools, at senior centers, and 
even in front yards for everyone to see. Food gardens are beautiful and produc-
tive, so why not let everyone enjoy the benefits? I describe the advantages to 
growing your own food in the following sections.
Improve your health
We all know we’re supposed to eat more fruits and vegetables every day. It 
isn’t just good advice from mom. Many vegetables are loaded with vitamins 
A and C, fiber, water, and minerals such as potassium. A growing body of 
research shows that eating fresh fruits and vegetables not only gives your 
body the nutrients and vitamins it needs to function properly, but it also 
reveals that many fruits and vegetables are loaded with phytochemicals and 
antioxidants — specific compounds that help prevent and fight illness.
 
While specific vegetables and fruits are high in certain nutrients, the best way 
to make sure you get a good range of these compounds in your diet is to “eat a 
rainbow.” By eating a variety of different-colored vegetables and fruits, you get 
all the nutrients you need to be healthy.
 
While eating fruits and vegetables is generally a great idea, the quality and 
safety of produce in grocery stores has been increasingly compromised. 
Whether it’s Salmonella on jalapeño peppers or E. coli in spinach, warnings 
seem to be happening every year. Also, some people are concerned about pes-
ticide residues on their produce. A list called the “Dirty Dozen” points out the 
vegetables and fruits most likely to contain pesticide residues. Here’s the list: 
apples, bell peppers, celery, cherries, imported grapes, nectarines, peaches, 
pears, potatoes, red raspberries, spinach, and strawberries. What better way 
to ensure a safe food supply free of biological and pesticide contamination 
than to grow your own? You’ll know exactly what’s been used to grow those 
beautiful crops.
Save some cash
 
You can save big money by growing your own vegetables and fruits. In fact, 
depending on the type and amount you grow, you can save hundreds of dollars. 
By spending a few dollars on seeds, plants, and supplies in spring, you’ll produce 
vegetables that yield pounds of produce in summer. Instead of having to go to 
the grocery store to buy all that produce, you’ve got it ready for the picking for 

18
Part I: Digging Into the Basics of Vegetable Gardening 
free in your yard. It’s your own personal produce department! You’ll save hun-
dreds of dollars on your grocery bill each year by growing a garden.
Here’s just one example of how a vegetable garden can save you some cash. 
The 20-foot-by-30-foot production garden in Figure 2-1 highlights many 
favorite vegetables. I also include some plans for succession cropping and 
interplanting. (See Chapter 16 for more details on these techniques.) When I 
indicate succession crops, I’m assuming two crops in one growing season. I’m 
also assuming 8-foot-long raised beds with rows with space to walk between 
the beds down the center.
To show you how the garden in Figure 2-1 saves you money, the following list 
provides vegetable yields and the price per pound of each crop. However, 
keep in mind that these are general averages. I’ve erred on the conservative 
side with many yields. Yields, after all, can vary depending on the location, 
variety, and growth of your crops. The prices are based on national average 
prices from the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service for those vegetables 
grown organically in summer. Again, these numbers may vary depending on 
the year and location in the country. However, even with all these variables, 
you can see that you grow more than 300 pounds of produce worth more 
than $600 just by working your own garden!

pounds of vegetables in a grocery store, you’d have to pay more than $600. 
So, as you can see, you’re saving money and getting great food to eat.
Help the environment
Your tomatoes, lettuces, and melons from the grocery store cost more than 
just the price to produce them. It’s estimated that the average produce 
travels up to 1,500 miles to get from farm to grocery store, and that’s just 

20
Part I: Digging Into the Basics of Vegetable Gardening 
vegetables and fruits produced in the United States. Increasingly, produce is 
being imported from foreign countries, such as China and Chile. The fossil 
fuels used to transport these vegetables increases air pollution and global 
warming. So, one of the big-picture reasons for growing your own produce is 
to fight these effects on our planet.
Plus, by growing your own vegetables, fruits, and herbs, you also reduce 
the amount of pollution that’s created on the farm. Regardless of it being a 
conventional or organic farm, many large operations tend to use lots of fertil-
izers, pesticides, and herbicides to grow their crops. Unfortunately, some of 
these additives end up as sources of pollution (and their creation requires 
fossil fuels). By growing your own produce using a minimal amount of these 
inputs (I show you how in Chapter 15), you can reduce the amount of chemi-
cal and fertilizer pollution that ends up in waterways around the country. 
For more information on gardening sustainably, check out Sustainable 
Landscaping For Dummies by Owen Dell (Wiley).
Increase your quality of life
A less tangible (but still important) reason to grow your own vegetables is 
related to quality of life. Vegetable gardening is a great way to unwind after 
a hard day. You can achieve a simple pleasure and satisfaction in roaming 
through your garden, snacking on a bean here and a cherry tomato there, 
pulling a few weeds, watering, and enjoying the fruits of your labors. It’s an 
immediate, simple satisfaction in a world that so often is complicated and 
complex.
Also, if you garden with others in a community garden, you’ll create new 
friendships and bonds with your neighbors. According to the NGA food gar-
dening survey that I describe earlier in this chapter, more than a million com-
munity gardens exist across the country. Often community gardens become 
a focal point for neighborhood beautification, education, and development 
projects. When the gardens are sown, people start taking increased interest 
and pride in their neighborhood and how it looks. Often crime, graffiti, and 
vandalism are reduced just by creating a garden where people can gather 
together. And you thought all you were doing is growing a few vegetables!

your area, contact the American Community Gardening Association at

▶ Getting the scoop on vegetable varieties
▶ Knowing how to time your planting
▶ Mapping out your garden design
B
efore you go out and till up the whole yard to create a vegetable garden, 
you need to do a little planning. I know, I know. You’re dreaming of 
luscious melons, mouth-watering tomatoes, and crisp salad greens picked 
fresh from your garden. But as my dad used to say, “You gotta have a plan, 
Charlie.” So, in this chapter, I provide you with a basic plan for locating and 
mapping out the perfect vegetable garden to suit your yard and needs.
Deciding Where to Put 
Your Vegetable Garden
When considering where to plop down your plot, think of these three main 
elements, which are necessary for the perfect spot: site, sun, and soil. The 
following sections describe each of these and give you some things to think 
about when surveying your yard for the best possible spot for your plot. 
Figure 3-1 puts some of these ideas into visual perspective.
 
Don’t be discouraged if you lack the ideal garden spot — few gardeners have 
one. Just try to make the most of what you have.

Considering different sites
Choosing a site is the important first step in planning a vegetable garden. 
This may sound like a tough choice to make, but don’t worry; a lot of the 
decision is based on good old common sense. When you’re considering a site 
for your garden, remember these considerations:
 
✓ Keep it close to home. Plant your garden where you’ll walk by it daily 
so that you remember to care for it. Also, a vegetable garden is a place 
people like to gather, so keep it close to a pathway. (I talk about garden 
paths later in this chapter.)
 
 Vegetable gardens used to be relegated to some forlorn location out back. 
Unfortunately, if it’s out of sight, it’s out of mind. I like to plant vegetables 
front and center — even in the front yard. That way you get to see the 
fruits of your labor and remember what chores need to be done. Plus, it’s 
a great way to engage the neighbors as they stroll by and admire your 
plants. You may even be inspired to share a tomato with them.
 
✓ Make it easy to access. If you need to bring in soil, compost, mulch, or 
wood by truck or car, make sure your garden can be easily reached by 
a vehicle. Otherwise you’ll end up working way too hard to cart these 
essentials from one end of the yard to the other.

23
 Chapter 3: Planning Your Veggie Garden
 
✓ Have a water source close by. Try to locate your garden as close as you 
can to an outdoor faucet. Hauling hundreds of feet of hose around the 
yard to water the garden will only cause more work and frustration. And, 
hey, isn’t gardening supposed to be fun?
 
✓ Keep it flat. You can garden on a slight slope, and, in fact, a south-facing 
one is ideal since it warms up faster in spring. However, too severe a 
slope could lead to erosion problems. To avoid having to build terraces 
like Machu Picchu, plant your garden on flat ground.
A bit of science also is involved in choosing the right site. Microclimates are 
small areas of your yard whose temperatures and related growing conditions are 
slightly different from the overall climate of your yard, neighborhood, or town. 
These differences usually are caused by large objects, such as your house, a wall, 
or a tree. For example, the south side of your house may be hotter than the rest 
of your yard, because the sun reflects off the walls and the house blocks prevail-
ing cold winds. Or an area under a large tree may be cooler than the rest of the 
yard because of the shade provided by the tree’s canopy.
 
How big is too big for a veggie garden? If you’re a first-time gardener, a size of 
100 square feet is plenty of space to take care of; I like to tell beginning garden-
ers to start small and build on their success. However, if you want to produce 
food for storing and sharing, a 20-foot-x-30-foot plot (600 square feet total) is a 
great size. You can produce an abundance of different vegetables and still keep 
the plot looking good.
Speaking of upkeep, keep the following in mind when deciding how large to 
make your garden: If the soil is in good condition, a novice gardener can keep 
up with a 600-square-foot garden by devoting about a half-hour each day the 
first month of the season; in late spring through summer, a good half-hour 
of work every 2 to 3 days should keep the garden productive and looking 
good. Keep in mind that the smaller the garden, the less time it’ll take to keep 
it looking great. Plus, after it’s established, the garden will take less time to 
get up and running in the spring. And if you use some of the time-saving tips 
throughout this book, you may be able to cut down the time commitment 
even more.
Letting the sun shine on your plot
 
Vegetables need enough sun to produce at their best. Fruiting vegetables, such 
as tomatoes, peppers, beans, squash, melons, cucumbers, and eggplant, need 
at least 6 hours of direct sun a day for good yields. The amount of sun doesn’t 
have to be continuous though. You can have 3 hours in the morning with some 
shade midday and then 3 more hours in the late afternoon.

24
Part I: Digging Into the Basics of Vegetable Gardening 
However, if your little piece of heaven gets less than 6 hours of sun, don’t give 
up. You have some options:
 
✓ Crops where you eat the leaves, such as lettuce, arugula, pac choi, and 
spinach, produce reasonably well in a partially shaded location where 
the sun shines directly on the plants for 3 to 4 hours a day.
 
✓ Root crops, such as carrots, potatoes, and beets, need more light than leafy 
vegetables, but they may do well getting only 4 to 6 hours of sun a day.
 
If you don’t have enough sun to grow fruiting crops, such as tomatoes and 
peppers, consider planting a movable garden. Plant these crops in containers 
and move them to the sunniest spots in your yard throughout the year. I dis-
cuss this technique more in Chapter 18.
Keep in mind that sun and shade patterns change with the seasons. A site 
that’s sunny in midsummer may later be shaded by trees, buildings, and 
the longer shadows of late fall and early spring. If you live in a mild-winter 
climate, such as parts of the southeastern and southwestern United States 
where it’s possible to grow vegetables nearly year-round, choosing a spot 
that’s sunny in winter as well as in summer is important. In general, sites that 
have clear southern exposure are sunniest in winter (refer to Figure 3-1).
You can have multiple vegetable garden plots around your yard matching the 
conditions with the vegetables you’re growing. If your only sunny spot is a 
strip of ground along the front of the house, plant a row of peppers and toma-
toes. If you have a perfect location near a backdoor, but it only gets morning 
sun, plant lettuce and greens in that plot.
If shade in your garden comes from nearby trees and shrubs, your vegetable 
plants will compete for water and nutrients as well as for light. Tree roots 
extend slightly beyond the drip line, the outer foliage reach of the tree. If 
possible, keep your garden out of the root zones (the areas that extend from 
the drip lines to the trunks) of surrounding trees and shrubs. If avoiding root 
zones isn’t possible, give the vegetables more water and be sure to fertilize to 
compensate.
 
Black walnut trees pose a particular problem to vegetable gardens because 
their roots give off a substance called juglone that inhibits the growth of some 
plants, including tomatoes. Plants growing in the root zones of black walnuts 
often wilt and die. Try to leave at least 50 feet between your garden and any 
walnut trees.
Checking your soil’s drainage
After you’ve checked the site location and sun levels of your prospective 
garden, you need to focus on the third element of the big three: the soil. 
Ideally you have rich, loamy, well-drained soil with few rocks (as I describe in 

25
 Chapter 3: Planning Your Veggie Garden
Chapter 14). Unfortunately, that type of soil is a rarity. But a key that’s even 
more essential to good soil is proper water drainage. Plant roots need air as 
well as water, and water-logged soils are low in air content. Puddles of water 
on the soil surface after a rain indicate poor drainage.
 
One way to check your soil’s drainage is to dig a hole about 10 inches deep 
and fill it with water. Let the water drain and then fill the hole again the follow-
ing day. Time how long it takes for the water to drain away. If water remains 
in the hole more than 8 to 10 hours after the second filling, your soil drainage 
needs improvement.
Soils made primarily of clay tend to be considered heavy. Heavy soils usually 
aren’t as well drained as sandy soils. Adding lots of organic matter to your 
soil can improve soil drainage (I tell you a lot more about how to do that in 
Chapter 14). Or you also can build raised beds on a poorly drained site (see 
“Deciding on hills, rows, or raised beds,” later in this chapter).
But slow water drainage isn’t always a bad thing. Soil also can be too well 
drained. Very sandy soil dries out quickly and needs frequent watering during 
dry spells. Again, adding lots of organic matter to sandy soil increases the 
amount of water it can hold.
If you encounter a lot of big rocks in your soil, you may want to look for 
another spot. Or consider going the raised-bed route. You can improve soils 
that have a lot of clay or that are too sandy, but very rocky soil can be a real 
headache. In fact, it can be impossible to garden in.
 
Don’t plant your garden near or on top of the leach lines of a septic system. 
I’m sure you know why. And keep away from underground utilities. If you have 
questions, call your local utility company to locate underground lines. If you’re 
unsure what’s below ground, visit www.call811.com to have lines or pipes 
identified for free.
Understanding Veggie Varieties
Before you go drooling over the luscious veggies in catalogs, in garden cen-
ters, and online, it’s good to know a little about the varieties you can choose 
from. If you select your veggie varieties before you design your garden, you 
can ensure that you have the proper amount of space and the best growing 
conditions. (I explain how to design your garden later in this chapter.)
A variety is a selection of a particular type of vegetable that has certain pre-
dictable, desirable traits. These traits may include the following:
 
✓ Adaptation: Some varieties are particularly well adapted to certain areas 
and climates. For example, some tomato varieties produce good-tasting 
fruit in the cool, foggy coastal climates of the Pacific Northwest. And 

26
Part I: Digging Into the Basics of Vegetable Gardening 
certain bean varieties are better adapted to the hot, dry deserts of the 
American southwest.
 
✓ Appearance: You can choose from a rainbow of fruit and leaf colors, such 
as purple peppers, yellow chard, and orange tomatoes. Leaf textures and 
shapes range from frilly to smooth to puckered. The flowers of some vege-
tables, such as okra and eggplant, are attractive in their own right. You get 
the idea. The more beautiful the vegetables, the more beautiful the veg-
etable garden — and the more stunning the food.
 
✓ Cooking and storage characteristics: Certain varieties of beans and 
peas, for example, freeze better than others. Some winter squash varieties 
may be stored for months, but others need to be eaten immediately.
 
✓ Days to maturity (or days to harvest): Days to maturity refers to the 
number of days it takes (under normal conditions) for a vegetable 
planted from seed (or from transplants) to mature and produce a crop. 
This number is especially important for vegetable gardeners who live 
in short-summer climates. Average days to maturity are listed for each 
type of vegetable in the appendix. You can find specific variety informa-
tion on individual vegetables in Part II.
 
✓ Extended harvest season: A certain variety of corn, for example, may 
ripen early or late in the season. By planting varieties that ripen at differ-
ent times, you can start harvesting as early as 60 days after seeding and 
continue for 5 or 6 weeks. Seed catalogs and packages often describe 
varieties as early season, midseason, or late season in relationship to 
other varieties of the same vegetable.
 
✓ Pest resistance: Many vegetable varieties are resistant to specific dis-
eases or pests — a very important trait in many areas. Some tomato 
varieties, in particular, have outstanding disease resistance. See Chapter 
17 for more on pest control. You also can read about specific pest-
resistant varieties of individual vegetables in Part II.
 
✓ Plant size: The trend in vegetable breeding is to go small. Tomato, 
cucumber, and even winter squash varieties are available in dwarf sizes. 
These varieties are perfect for container growing or small-space gardens.
 
✓ Taste: Pick a flavor and you can find a vegetable that stars in it. You can 
grow fruity tomatoes, super-sweet varieties of corn, bitter melons, and 
spicy peppers. You’ll discover flavors for every taste bud.
 
To realize the scope of your vegetable variety possibilities, see the individual 
vegetable descriptions in Part II. It’s also important to note that you can 
categorize a variety as a hybrid, an open-pollinated, or an heirloom variety. 
Here’s what these terms mean:
 
✓ Hybrid: Hybrid seeds (also known as F-1 hybrids) are the result of a cross 
of selected groups of plants of the same kind, called inbred lines. (A cross 
is when pollen from one flower fertilizes a flower from another similar 
plant, resulting in seed.) Hybrid seeds generally are more expensive than 
open-pollinated seeds, and they can’t be saved and planted the next year 

27
 Chapter 3: Planning Your Veggie Garden
because the offspring won’t have the same characteristics as the parents. 
If you did plant them next year, you’d get a mix of characteristics — some 
desirable and some not. The plants are uniform, but they often lack a 
diversity of shapes, colors, sizes, and flavors. However, hybrid plants are 
more vigorous, productive, and widely adapted than other varieties.
 
✓ Open-pollinated: Open-pollinated varieties basically are inbred lines 
allowed to pollinate each other in open fields. They produce offspring 
that are similar to their parents. Before the arrival of hybrids, all vegeta-
ble varieties were open-pollinated. Some gardeners like these varieties 
for their flavor, their diversity, and the fact that they can save the seeds 
each year to replant. The resulting offspring are pretty predictable, but 
they don’t provide the consistency of hybrids.
 
✓ Heirloom: Any open-pollinated variety that’s at least 50 years old is generally
considered an heirloom. Heirlooms are enjoying quite a revival because 
of the variety of colors, tastes, and forms that are available. They’re worth 
trying, but keep in mind that some varieties may not have the disease 
resistance and wide adaptability that hybrids generally have.
 
One category generally available only to commercial farmers is that of the geneti-
cally modified variety. This kind of plant has a gene from a completely unrelated 
species inserted into it so that it exhibits a certain trait. For example, geneticists 
have inserted a gene of the biological pesticide Bt (see Chapter 17) into potatoes 
so that when the Colorado potato beetle (their biggest enemy) eats a potato’s 
leaves, it also eats the pesticide and dies. Many questions exist about the long-
term health risks and environmental safety of manipulating the gene pool so dra-
matically and quickly. For this reason, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) 
aren’t allowed in organic gardening.
Timing Your Planting Wisely
As my dad used to say, “Timing is everything.” This axiom is especially 
important for vegetable gardening, so file it where you can’t forget it. 
Remembering it will save you lots of heartache and disappointment. For 
example, if you plant tomatoes too early, the plants will sit there like bumps 
on a log, not growing and possibly rotting in cold, wet soil or turning mushy 
and black after they’ve been zapped by frost. Plant lettuce too late, and it’ll 
produce more flowers than leaves, and the leaves you harvest will be tough 
and bitter. I can give you examples like this for every vegetable, but I’ll spare 
you the monotony. Just know that planting at the wrong time of year is a 
recipe for disaster.
If you follow the rhythms of nature and plant when conditions are perfect for 
proper growth, growing vegetables is a breeze. But how are you supposed to 
know about these rhythms? Start tapping your foot, because the following 
sections will have you moving like Fred Astaire.

28
Part I: Digging Into the Basics of Vegetable Gardening 
Some like it cool, some like it hot
Vegetables can be divided into the following two categories based on the tem-
perature conditions in which they grow best:
 
✓ Cool-season vegetables: These vegetables, such as lettuce, spinach, 
peas, potatoes, broccoli, and cabbage, grow best in the cool weather of 
spring and fall. As vegetables go, they’re fairly hardy and survive despite 
freezing temperatures. In most areas, cool-season vegetables are usually 
planted in early spring so they mature before the onset of hot weather, 
or in late summer to early fall for maturation in the cool months of fall 
or early winter. However, in areas where summers are very cool and win-
ters are mild, such as in coastal areas of the western United States and 
the far north, cool season vegetables can be grown year-round and may 
be the only vegetables that can thrive in this climate.
 
 What happens if you plant a cool-season vegetable when it’s too warm? 
Not a lot of good. Lettuce will bolt, meaning it starts to flower before you 
get a chance to harvest it. In other words, instead of producing tender, 
crisp leaves, lettuce will send out a tall flower spike. Any leaves that are 
left on the plant will be bitter-tasting and tough. Broccoli will form loose 
clusters of yellow flowers instead of forming nice tight heads. And peas 
won’t properly fill their pods with sweet, succulent peas. You get the idea!
 
✓ Warm-season vegetables: These vegetables, such as beans, tomatoes, 
peppers, cucumbers, melons, squash, okra, and corn, like it hot and grow 
best in the warm months of summer. They need warm soil and air tem-
peratures to grow their best; if they’re planted while the weather is still 
too cool, they’ll suffer and not grow. Because freezing temperatures kill 
these vegetables, they’re usually planted after the threat of frost in spring. 
In warm areas, they also can be planted in late summer for a fall harvest.
 
 To push along warm-season veggies, wait until the soil and air are the 
proper temperature. Or consider using season extenders to trap heat 
around the plants. Season extenders also help in cool summer climates 
such as the Pacific Northwest, where the weather rarely gets warm 
enough even in summer to ripen heat-loving vegetables like melons. 
(Chapter 21 has more ideas on season-extending techniques.)
Frost dates and the length 
of the growing season
You should know two very important weather dates for your area if you want 
to grow vegetables successfully:
 
✓ The average date of the last frost in spring
 
✓ The average date of the first frost in fall

29
 Chapter 3: Planning Your Veggie Garden
These frost dates tell you several important things:
 
✓ When to plant: Cool-season vegetables are generally planted 4 to 6 
weeks before the last spring frost. Fall planting of cool-season vegetables 
is less dependent on frost dates, but it’s usually done 8 to 12 weeks 
before the first fall frost. Warm-season vegetables are planted after the 
last spring frost or in late summer in warm areas for a fall harvest.
 
✓ When to protect warm-season vegetables: Frosts kill warm-season vege-
tables. So the closer you plant to the last frost of spring, the more impor-
tant it is to protect plants. And as the fall frost gets closer, so does the end 
of your summer vegetable season — unless, of course, you protect your 
plants. I show you how to provide frost protection in Chapter 21.
 
✓ The length of your growing season: Your growing season is the number 
of days between the average date of the last frost in spring and the aver-
age date of the first frost in fall. The length of the growing season can 
range from less than 100 days in northern or cold winter climates to 365 
days in frost-free southern climes. Many warm-season vegetables need 
long, warm growing seasons to properly mature, so they’re difficult, if 
not impossible, to grow where growing seasons are short.
 
 How are you to know whether your growing season is long enough? If 
you check mail-order seed catalogs or even individual seed packets, 
each variety will have the number of days to harvest or days to maturity 
(usually posted in parentheses next to the variety name). This number 
tells you how many days it takes for that vegetable to grow from seed 
(or transplant) to harvest. If your growing season is only 100 days long 
and you want to grow a melon or other warm-season vegetable that 
takes 120 frost-free days to mature, you have a problem. The plant will 
probably be killed by frost before the fruit is mature. In areas with short 
growing seasons, it’s usually best to go with early ripening varieties 
(which have the shortest number of days to harvest).
 
 However, you also can find many effective ways to extend your grow-
ing season, such as starting seeds indoors or planting under floating 
row covers (blanketlike materials that drape over plants, creating warm, 
greenhouselike conditions underneath). Various methods of extending 
growing seasons are covered in Chapter 21.
There you have it; now you know why frost dates are so important. But how 
do you find out dates for your area? Easy. Ask a local nursery worker or con-
tact your local Cooperative Extension office (look in the phone book under 
county government). You also can look in the appendix of this book, which 
lists frost dates for major cities around the country.
 
Frost dates are important, but you also have to take them with a grain of salt. 
After all, these dates are averages, meaning that half the time the frost will 
actually come earlier than the average date and half the time it will occur later. 
You also should know that frost dates are usually given for large areas, such as 
your city or county. If you live in a cold spot in the bottom of a valley, frosts 

30
Part I: Digging Into the Basics of Vegetable Gardening 
may come days earlier in fall and days later in spring. Similarly, if you live in a 
warm spot or you garden in a microclimate, your frost may come later in fall and 
stop earlier in spring. You’re sure to find out all about your area as you become a 
more seasoned vegetable gardener and unearth the nuances of your own yard. 
One thing you’ll discover for sure is that you can’t predict the weather.
Listening to your evening weather forecast is one of the best ways to find out 
whether frosts are expected in your area. But you also can do a little predict-
ing yourself by going outside late in the evening and checking conditions. If 
the fall or early spring sky is clear and full of stars, and the wind is still, 
conditions are right for a frost. If you need to protect plants, do so at that 
time. Frost-protection techniques are covered in Chapter 21.
Designing Your Garden
After you’ve found the best spot for your plot, selected a few veggie varieties, 
and figured out when you need to plant those varieties, it’s time to map out 
your garden. Designing a vegetable garden is a little bit of art and a little bit 
of science. Practically speaking, plants must be spaced properly so they have 
room to grow and arranged so taller vegetables don’t shade lower-growing 
types. Different planting techniques fit the growth habits of different kinds of 
vegetables. You also should think about the paths between rows and plants. 
Will you have enough room to harvest, weed, and water, for example?
On the other hand, having fun with your vegetable garden design is impor-
tant too. Many vegetables are good looking on their own, but you also can get 
creative with combinations of vegetables with different flowers and herbs.
In the following sections, I give you the basics so you can start to sketch out 
a garden plan. I also provide some sample designs to get your juices flowing. 
If you stick with your plan, you’ll be a vegetable gardening wizard in no time.
 
These sections give you the nuts and bolts information you need to create a 
final vegetable garden design. Don’t stop here though. The descriptions of 
individual vegetables in Part II suggest ways to grow various types of 
vegetables — information that will probably influence your design. And the 
information on planting times earlier in this chapter, the scoop on succession 
planting in Chapter 16, and the lowdown on watering techniques in Chapter 15 
can influence the way you arrange and plant your garden.
Deciding on hills, rows, or raised beds
Before you sketch a plan, you need to decide how to arrange the plants in 
your garden. You can use three basic planting arrangements:

31
 Chapter 3: Planning Your Veggie Garden
 
✓ In rows: Planting vegetables in rows is the typical farmer technique. Any 
vegetable can be planted in straight rows, but this arrangement works 
best with types that need quite a bit of room, such as tomatoes, beans, 
cabbages, corn, potatoes, peppers, and summer squash.
 
✓ In hills: Hills are typically used for vining crops such as cucumbers, 
melons, pumpkins, and winter squash. You can create a 1-foot-wide, flat-
topped mound for heavy soil, or you can create a circle at ground level 
for sandy soil. You then surround the soil with a moatlike ring for water-
ing. Two or three evenly spaced plants are grown on each hill. Space 
your hills the recommended distance used for rows of that vegetable.
 
✓ In raised beds: Raised beds, which are my favorite, are kind of like wide, 
flat-topped rows. They’re usually at least 2 feet wide and raised at least 
6 inches high, but any planting area that’s raised above the surround-
ing ground level is a raised bed. Almost any vegetable can benefit from 
being grown on a raised bed, but smaller vegetables and root crops, 
such as lettuce, beets, carrots, onions, spinach, and radishes, really 
thrive with this type planting. On top of the raised bed you can grow 
plants in rows or with broadcast seeding (see Chapter 13 for more on 
seeding techniques).
 
 A raised bed can be a normal bed with the soil piled 5 or 6 inches high. I 
call this a temporary raised bed. Or you can build a permanent raised bed 
with wood, stone, or masonry sides, as shown in Figure 3-2.
 
Figure 3-2:

can also be used)
Temporary raised
bed made with soil
Raised beds have several advantages, including the following:
 
✓ They rise above soil problems. If you have bad soil or poor drainage, 
raised beds are for you. You can amend the garden soil in the raised bed 
with compost or the same sterile potting soil you use for containers (see 
Chapter 18). And because you don’t step on the beds as you work, the 

32
Part I: Digging Into the Basics of Vegetable Gardening 
soil is more likely to stay light and fluffy, providing the perfect conditions 
for root growth — especially for root crops such as carrots and beets.
 
✓ They warm up quickly. Because more of the soil in raised beds is 
exposed to the sun, the soil warms early and dries out faster, allowing 
for early planting and extended harvest seasons.
 
 If you’re in a hot climate and have sandy soil, raised beds may not be for 
you, because they’ll dry out and heat up too much.
 
✓ They reduce your work. By growing your vegetables in raised beds, you 
can maximize your fertilizing and watering so that more nutrients and 
water are actually used by the plants rather than wasted in the pathways.
 
✓ They’re easy on your back and knees. If you design the beds properly 
(about 18 to 24 inches high and no wider than 4 feet), raised beds can 
make vegetable gardening a lot more comfortable. You can sit on the 
edge and easily reach into the bed to weed or harvest. You can even cap 
the edge to make it more benchlike.
 
✓ They’re attractive. You can make raised beds in almost any shape you 
like — rectangle, square, triangle, circle. Your garden can take on a 
whimsical design with a little creativity. Just keep the width less than 4 
feet so you can easily reach the center of the bed without stepping on 
the soil.
Wooden raised beds should be made of rot-resistant woods, such as redwood 
or cedar, or recycled plastic timbers. I like to use two 2-x-10 boards for the 
sides, and then I anchor them with lag screws at the corners with short 4-x-4 
posts buried a foot deep. (You don’t necessarily need the posts, however.) If 
you plant several raised beds, leave at least 3-foot-wide paths between them 
for access. (I discuss garden paths in more detail later in this chapter.)
Some gardeners use pressure-treated wood or creosote-treated railroad ties 
to construct raised beds; check with your local lumberyard for these materi-
als. I prefer not to use woods treated with chemicals. They’ll last a long time, 
but research has shown that some of these chemicals leach into the soil and 
can adversely affect your plants.
 
The one downside of permanent raised beds is turning the soil. Lifting a tiller 
onto the bed can be difficult, so they’re best turned by hand with an iron fork. 
(I like to “fluff” my beds each spring with an iron fork.) You also can use a 
minitiller, which I discuss in Chapter 20.
In dry areas such as the desert Southwest, the traditional bed isn’t raised — it’s 
sunken. These waffle beds are created by digging into the soil about 6 inches 
deep and making a small wall of soil around the outside edge of the bed. This 
design allows the bed to catch any summer rains, protects young plants from 
the drying winds, and concentrates water where the vegetables grow.

33
 Chapter 3: Planning Your Veggie Garden
Spacing your plantings properly
After you know what you’re planting and how to arrange the plants, it’s time 
to talk spacing. Make a list of the different types of vegetables that you want to 
grow, and then pay attention to these columns in Table A-1 in the appendix:
 
✓ Plants/Seeds per 100 ft. of Row: This column tells you how many 
plants/how much seed you need to purchase.
 
✓ Spacing between Rows/Beds (Inches): This column includes the ideal dis-
tance you should leave between rows or beds of different vegetables. This 
is usually a little more than the distance you should leave between plants.
 
✓ Spacing between Plants (Inches): In this column, you find the ideal dis-
tance to allow between individual vegetable plants within a row or plant-
ing bed.
 
✓ Average Yield per 10 ft. of Row: This column shows you how much you 
can expect to harvest.
 
The vegetable spacing information that I provide in Table A-1 in the appendix 
is more like guidelines than hard-and-fast rules. If you’re growing on raised 
beds or growing dwarf varieties (see Part II for examples of these types of vari-
eties), you can plant a little closer together, because you’ll be concentrating 
the fertilizer and water in a smaller space.
 
Even though closer planting is possible, don’t plant so close that plants have 
to compete with each other for food, water, and light. If you do, you’ll eventu-
ally get smaller harvests or lower-quality vegetables.
Following the paths
You can get so involved in the beds, rows, hills, and vegetable varieties that 
you forget about the paths between everything. Keep the paths at least 2 to 3 
feet wide so you can easily walk on them. For larger gardens, consider a few 
main paths that are wide enough for a passing garden cart.
Be sure to use mulching materials on the paths to keep weeds at bay and 
make for easier walking. The last thing you want to do is weed your garden 
paths! Most gardeners tend to use whatever materials are cheap and widely 
available. Pine straw in the South, hay in the North, and gravel in the arid 
West are all possibilities for garden paths. I prefer organic materials (every-
thing from ground bark and straw to sawdust, leaves, and grass clippings) 
because they add organic matter to the soil, helping my garden prosper. 
Check out Chapter 15 for more information on mulching your beds.

34
Part I: Digging Into the Basics of Vegetable Gardening 
Sketching it out
After you determine the location and dimensions of your garden, you need to 
sketch out a simple garden plan. Your drawing doesn’t have to be a work of 
art, just functional. All you need is a piece of graph paper and a pencil, a list 
of vegetables you want to grow, and maybe a seed catalog or two. Then just 
grab your pencil and graph paper and start drawing. First, draw the garden 
to scale. Leave space from the edge of the paper, draw in the first row, leave 
room for a path, and then create your next row. Continue filling in the rows 
with your favorite crops, taking into account the space requirements of the 
crops you want to grow (refer to Table A-1 in the appendix); whether you 
want to plant in rows, beds, or hills; and how much of each vegetable you 
want to harvest.
 
Here are a few things to keep in mind as you sketch out your garden plan:
 
✓ You can’t plant everything. Choose your crops carefully, and only grow 
what you like to eat. And grow only how much you think you can eat. 
Eating broccoli for breakfast, lunch, and dinner can get old fast.
 
✓ Not all plants have it made in the shade. Tall crops like corn should be 
placed where they won’t shade other vegetables. The north end of the 
garden is usually best.
 
✓ These roots aren’t made for walking. Plan your garden with walkways 
so you can get to plants easily without damaging roots. (For more about 
walkways, see the previous section.)
 
Planning on paper helps you purchase the correct number of seeds or trans-
plants and use space more efficiently. It’s a good way to see the possibilities 
for succession planting (following one crop with another) and interplanting 
(planting a quick maturing crop next to a slower-maturing one and harvesting 
the former before it competes for space). For example, you may see that you 
can follow your late peas with a crop of late broccoli, and you’ll be ready with 
transplants in July. Or you may see that there’s space to tuck a few lettuce 
plants among your tomatoes while the vines are still small. You can find out 
more about these techniques in Chapter 16.
In the following sections, I provide some sample garden designs for inspira-
tion. If you’re looking for a basic veggie garden design, flip to Chapter 2. Keep 
in mind that you can alter the designs in these sections to fit the size of your 
garden; you also can substitute similar-sized vegetables for those that you 
don’t like. The options are endless!
A raised-bed greens garden
The 6-foot-x-10-foot garden in Figure 3-3 is an easy one to tuck along a house or 
garage or in a small space near your kitchen. It’s composed of four 2-feet-x-4-feet 
beds with mulched paths in between. The raised beds make this garden easy to 
access and care for.

The key to getting the most from the raised beds in this plan is to succession 
crop. For example, after the spinach crop is finished, plant summer lettuces 
or chard. Some greens, such as the loose-leaf lettuces and mesclun, can be 
cut and allowed to regrow for a second or third crop (see Chapter 10 for more 
information on cut-and-come-again lettuce). With a little forethought you can 
have fresh greens and salad fixings from spring through fall.
An edible-landscape garden
The garden in Figure 3-4 is beautiful and functional. I designed it to be around 
the front entrance of the house. It allows you to have blueberries, dwarf 
apple trees, and raspberries close to the house rather than way out in the 
backyard.
I created permanent raised beds on either side of the walkways leading to 
the front door. The paths between the beds are growing grass and are wide 
enough for a mower to pass through. In the beds are a combination of edible 
flowers, herbs, vegetables, and fruits, all selected with beauty and productiv-
ity in mind.
For example, you can grow colorful heirloom tomatoes, a combination of 
sweet and hot peppers, purple and yellow beans, basil and other herbs, cut-
and-come-again greens, strawberries, and vivid root crops. You also can try 
growing edible flowers such as nasturtiums, marigolds, calendula, and pan-
sies in their own bed and scattered throughout. See Chapter 12 for more on 
edible landscaping and growing fruits and herbs in your garden.

An ethnic pizza garden
The garden in Figure 3-5 uses the pizza garden theme from kids’ gardens, 
where each “slice” is a potential topping on a pizza. In my case, each “slice” 
of this 20-foot-diameter pizza is composed of specialty varieties of different 
ethnic vegetables. Ethnic cooking is booming as people discover cuisines 
from around the world. Many of the special varieties and ingredients in 
ethnic cooking aren’t readily available in grocery stores, but you can grow 
them at home.
The mulched pathways (each 3 feet wide) allow for 3 beds to be in each slice. 
The four cuisines are Asian, Italian, Mexican, and French/Continental. Not 
all the vegetables you need for cooking are represented in this garden, but it 
has some key ingredients that you can’t do without, such as chili pepper for 
Mexican cooking, basil for Italian dishes, and pac choi for Asian cuisines.

E
ach chapter in this part looks at the most popular 
groups of or individual vegetables. I show you lots of 
varieties you can experiment with and the best ways to 
grow them successfully to harvest. I even talk about other 
edibles, such as berries and herbs, that are easy and 
beautiful to grow in your yard or garden.

Chapter 4
Tomatoes: The King of Veggies
In This Chapter
▶ Choosing the right variety for your garden
▶ Growing your tomatoes to perfection
A
s I mention in Chapter 2, tomatoes are hands down the most popular 
vegetable grown in the garden. After you’ve picked and tasted a juicy, 
vine-ripened fresh tomato, you’ll understand why. You can’t compare the 
bland supermarket tennis balls that most people make do with to the taste 
and texture explosion of the homegrown tomato. The best news is that toma-
toes are even easy to grow! Just give them a good start and a little attention 
during the growing season, and you’ll be rewarded with more delicious ripe 
fruits than you can eat.
Tomatoes are no longer limited to the round red fruits we’re accustomed to 
seeing. Through breeding and the rediscovery of heirloom varieties, tomatoes 
now come in almost every color of the rainbow, from black to white, and in a 
variety of sizes, from as tiny as a blueberry to as large as a grapefruit. Modern 
breeding practices have created tomato varieties that are well adapted to heat, 
cold, and even containers. Great taste, disease resistance, and ease of growing 
make tomatoes the most rewarding to grow of all the vegetables.
 
Even though we all call the tomato a vegetable, botanically it’s considered a 
fruit. Any edible plant part that develops from the ovary of the plant (found 
behind the flower) after fertilization is considered a fruit, so tomatoes, cucumbers, 
squash, peppers, and eggplant are considered fruits; lettuce, carrots, onions, 
and spinach are technically considered vegetables. Of course, this discus-
sion is a moot point, because most folks categorize fruits and vegetables by 
their uses, not by their botany. (Case in point: A Supreme Court ruling in 1893 
declared the tomato a vegetable.) So be it.
Checking Out Tomato Varieties
Before deciding which tomato variety to grow, you first need to consider the 
growth habits of the different plants. Plants can grow into huge monsters or 

42
Part II: Vegging Out 
tiny pot plants. So first decide how much room you have to plant tomatoes, and 
then decide on the right variety for that space. Whether a cherry tomato, paste 
tomato, or red slicing variety, tomatoes all fall into one of these categories:
 
✓ Indeterminate: Indeterminate tomato plants keep growing and growing 
and growing. The side branches and shoots continue to grow even after 
fruit is set (in other words, after the flower has been pollinated and the 
young tomato fruits begin to grow), and they can be stopped only by frost, 
insects, disease, or an ax. Most main crop tomatoes are of this type.
 
 These tomato varieties do produce a ton of fruit, but the tomatoes tend 
to mature later in the season than those born by the shorter plant vari-
eties. Varieties such as ‘Better Boy’ and ‘Brandywine’ are good examples 
of indeterminate tomato types.
 
✓ Determinate: Unlike indeterminate varieties, determinate varieties tend 
to stop growing once the shoots set fruit. Varieties vary in the degree 
that they’re determinate, but these plants generally tend to be shorter 
and produce less fruit. However, they do mature fruit earlier than inde-
terminates. Varieties such as ‘Solar Fire’ and ‘Oregon Spring’ are good 
examples of determinate types.
 
✓ Dwarf: These stronger determinate plants tend to reach only a few feet 
tall, produce all of their fruit at once, and then stop producing for the 
season. These plants are excellent as patio or container plants, produc-
ing cherry tomato–sized fruits. The ‘Patio’ and ‘Tiny Tim’ varieties are 
examples of dwarf tomatoes.
 
✓ Dwarf-indeterminate: The best of both worlds, these plants stay dwarf, 
only reaching about 3 to 4 feet tall, but continue to produce full-sized 
tomatoes all season long. They grow well when planted in containers or 
in the garden. Some dwarf-indeterminate varieties include ‘Bush Big Boy’ 
and ‘Husky Gold’.
In Figure 4-1, you can see the differences between determinate, indetermi-
nate, and dwarf plants.
 
When in doubt about a variety’s quality, look for the All-America Selections 
(AAS) winner label in the variety’s description. This group evaluates new vari-
eties yearly by conducting trials all across the country for outstanding growth 
and flavor. A variety with this label will likely perform well in your garden.
Tomato varieties also can be classified as hybrids or open-pollinated plants 
(see Chapter 3 for more information):
 
✓ Open-pollinated refers to varieties that have the ability to cross-pollinate 
among themselves naturally and produce plants that resemble the parents. 
All heirlooms are open-pollinated and are generally considered varieties 
that were grown prior to the 1940s.

43
 Chapter 4: Tomatoes: The King of Veggies
 
✓ Hybrid varieties are the products of crosses between two varieties that 
wouldn’t necessarily naturally cross. Hybrids are an invention of post–
World War II plant breeders to make varieties more productive, uniform, 
and disease resistant.
One more way to classify tomatoes is by their color, shape, and use:
 
✓ Color: What was once exclusively a red fruit now comes in orange, 
yellow, green, black (really dark brown), white, and striped colors. The 
only color not represented is blue; however, give breeders a little time, 
and it may show up someday!
 
✓ Shape: Tomatoes have been traditionally available as a round fruit, but 
new shapes pop up all the time. Some shapes that are available today 
include oblong, egg, cherry, grape, pear, and flattened.
 
✓ Use: While I mostly like to eat tomatoes fresh off the vine, some varieties 
are better suited to sauces, canning, and drying. (Check out the later sec-
tion “Studying some saucy tomatoes” for more on varieties that are great 
for processing.)
With so many distinctions, how do you decide which varieties to plant? In 
this section, I help you decide by listing some of my favorites.

Enjoying classic red, round tomatoes
When you say the word “tomato,” most people think of red, round tomatoes. 
They’re the classic, bright red, juicy, meaty tomatoes that we all want to 
grow. You have hundreds of varieties to choose from, so deciding can be dif-
ficult. But, don’t worry! The following list includes some of my favorites that 
you may want to try:
 
✓ ‘Better Boy’: This hybrid indeterminate produces smooth 8- to 12-ounce 
fruits 72 days after transplanting that are great for slicing. This variety 
has good disease resistance.
 
✓ ‘Big Beef’: This All-America-Selections-winning, indeterminate hybrid is 
loaded with disease resistance, producing blemish-free 8- to 10-ounce 
fruits. This variety matures 70 days from transplant.
 
✓ ‘Bush Big Boy’: This hybrid dwarf-indeterminate variety produces 
10-ounce fruits on a 4-foot-tall plant 71 days after transplanting.
 
✓ ‘Cold Set’: If you’re trying to grow tomatoes in a cold climate, try this 
open-pollinated variety. The 4- to 6-ounce fruits set 65 days after trans-
planting on determinate plants that can tolerate a light frost.
 
✓ ‘Costoluto Genovese’: This Italian indeterminate heirloom is close to 
my heart and taste buds. The 8-ounce fruits are deeply ribbed, juicy, and 
have a strong tomato flavor. The plants love the heat and produce fruits 
80 days after transplanting.
 
✓ ‘Delicious’: If you want to grow “the big one,” this indeterminate heir-
loom is for you. The plant produces fruit 77 days after transplanting, and 
those fruits often weigh more than 2 pounds each. This variety holds the 
world record for the largest tomato: 7 pounds, 12 ounces.
 
✓ ‘Early Girl’: Despite being an indeterminate hybrid (which generally 
matures later in the season), this plant produces 4- to 6-ounce fruits only 
52 days after transplanting. You can experiment with the ‘Bush Early 
Girl’ version as well, which has the same characteristics except that it 
only grows 2 feet tall.
 
✓ ‘Oregon Spring’: This determinate, open-pollinated variety is bred for 
cold tolerance and relatively few seeds in each fruit. The 7- to 8-ounce 
fruits are produced only 58 days after transplanting.
 
✓ ‘Solar Fire’: This determinate hybrid was bred at the University of 
Florida, so it’s heat tolerant. The large, 7- to 10-ounce round fruits are 
disease resistant and mature 72 days after transplanting.
 
✓ ‘Stupice’: This Czechoslovakian indeterminate heirloom is an early 
and cold-tolerant variety that bears 1- to 2-ounce fruits 52 days after 
transplanting.
 
✓ ‘Super Bush’: This determinate, 3- to 4-foot tall hybrid plant is great in 
containers. Unlike many other container-adapted varieties, the ‘Super 

45
 Chapter 4: Tomatoes: The King of Veggies
Bush’ variety produces large, 8- to 10-ounce fruits on disease-resistant 
plants. Fruits are produced 85 days after transplanting.
 
When in doubt about choosing a variety to grow in your garden, ask your local 
garden center, farmer’s market, or neighbor who’s growing tomatoes for sug-
gestions about what grows best in your region.
Surveying all the other colors of tomatoes
Tomatoes of a different color (other than red that is) are very popular. The 
flavor of many of these varieties is comparable to the red varieties, but the 
colors can be outstanding in salads and casseroles, or just by themselves. 
Here are some beautifully colored varieties you might try:
 
✓ ‘Black Krim’: This indeterminate Russian heirloom has unique, 
12-ounce, dark reddish-brown fruit. Both the skins and the flesh are 
colored this way, and the fruit color darkens in hot weather. Fruits are 
produced 80 days after transplanting. This tomato is something really 
different!
 
✓ ‘Brandywine’: This Amish indeterminate heirloom has unique potato-leaf 
foliage and produces 1- to 2-pound pink fruits with red flesh — reportedly 
the most flavorful of all varieties — 80 days after transplanting. You also 
can buy a similar ‘Yellow Brandywine’ and ‘Red Brandywine’ if you’d like 
all the colors of ‘Brandywine’ tomatoes in your garden.
 
✓ ‘Cherokee Purple’: This heirloom indeterminate bears 10-ounce dusky 
rose- or purple-colored fruits with thin skins about 80 days after 
transplanting.
 
✓ ‘Great White’: This indeterminate heirloom plant produces 10- to 
12-ounce white-colored fruits 85 days after transplanting. The meaty 
fruits, whose skins and flesh are white, have a mild flavor, few seeds, and 
a creamy texture. When combined with ‘Black Krim’ it makes an interest-
ing black-and-white tomato salad.
 
✓ ‘Green Zebra’: These 3-ounce fruits are produced 75 days after trans-
planting. The skin and flesh are green even when ripe. The flavor of 
this indeterminate heirloom is tangy and sweet and makes a mean fried 
green tomato dish.
 
✓ ‘Husky Gold’: This AAS-winning dwarf-indeterminate hybrid plant only 
reaches 4 feet tall, but it produces deep golden-colored, 8-ounce fruits 70 
days after transplanting.
 
✓ ‘Lemon Boy’: The first lemon-yellow-colored tomato, this hybrid inde-
terminate produces 7-ounce fruits with lots of disease resistance 72 days 
after transplanting.

46
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
✓ ‘Long Keeper’: These determinate, open-pollinated plants produce 6- to 
7-ounce orange-red fruits 78 days after transplanting. When unblemished 
fruits are gathered before the first frost, they can last in winter storage 
for up to 3 months. (Flip to Chapter 19 for more on storing fruits and 
vegetables during the winter months.)
 
✓ ‘Striped German’: This German heirloom indeterminate variety pro-
duces 16- to 32-ounce fruits with beautiful yellow-orange skin and red 
marbled flesh 78 days after transplanting.
Sweetening the pot with cherry, 
grape, and pear tomatoes
Cherry, grape, and pear tomatoes sound like fruits, and they may as well be 
for their sweet, melt-in-your-mouth flavor. Nothing is more satisfying to me 
than going into the garden and munching on handfuls of cherry tomatoes. 
Rarely do these babies even make it to the kitchen.
The latest newcomer on the small tomato scene is the grape tomato. 
Originally from Thailand, these tomatoes have a grape shape and are smaller 
than most cherry tomatoes. However, grape tomatoes have a thicker skin and 
are less juicy, which means they squirt less when you munch down on them. 
Because they’re easier to eat, they’re often found in place of cherry tomatoes 
in salad bars and restaurants.
Pear tomato varieties have been around for years. These red- or yellow-colored 
fruits look like small pears and are flavorful, but they generally aren’t as sweet 
as cherry tomatoes.
 
Cherry, grape, and pear tomatoes can be very productive, so often, only one 
or two plants are enough to keep your family happy all season. If you’re grow-
ing dwarf, patio-type tomatoes, they do best in containers. (See Chapter 18 for 
more on growing vegetables in containers.) Cherry, grape, and pear tomato 
fruits do tend to crack more easily than larger-sized tomatoes, so make sure 
that they have plenty of water and mulch (see Chapter 15 for watering and 
mulching tips).
Here are some of my favorite small tomato varieties:
 
✓ ‘Black Cherry’: These 2- to 3-ounce black-red skinned and fleshed fruits 
have a complex flavor. The heirloom indeterminate plants produce 
cherry-shaped fruits 65 days after transplanting.
 
✓ ‘Golden Sweet’: This indeterminate hybrid grape tomato features 
1-ounce golden yellow fruits with a mild, sweet flavor and no cracking. 
Fruits mature 60 days after transplanting.

47
 Chapter 4: Tomatoes: The King of Veggies
 
✓ ‘Juliet’: This 1-ounce red, indeterminate hybrid, AAS-winning grape tomato 
is crack and disease resistant. It matures 60 days after transplanting.
 
✓ ‘Patio’: This hybrid, dwarf plant produces grape-sized red fruits all at 
once about 70 days after transplanting.
 
✓ ‘Sun Gold’: This hybrid indeterminate plant produces fruity tasting 1- to 
2-inch-diameter orange-colored cherry tomato fruits 57 days after 
transplanting.
 
✓ ‘Sweet Million’: This prolific hybrid indeterminate, 1- to 2-inch-diameter, 
red-fruited cherry tomato variety has good disease and crack resistance 
and matures early at 60 days after transplanting.
 
✓ ‘Tiny Tim’: These open-pollinated, dwarf, 18-inch-tall plants are great for 
containers. They produce 1-inch-diameter red cherry tomato fruits 60 
days after transplanting.
 
✓ ‘Window Box Roma’: This hybrid determinate plant produces 2-ounce, 
roma-type, cylindrical-shaped fruits 70 days after transplanting on 
18-inch-tall plants. This variety is perfect for producing a container of 
sauce-making tomatoes.
 
✓ ‘Yellow Pear’: This is an heirloom indeterminate that produces yellow, 
2-inch-diameter pear-shaped fruits on huge plants about 78 days after 
transplanting. Kids love the shape of these tomatoes.
Studying some saucy tomatoes
Eating tomatoes fresh from the garden is pure joy. However, you may want to 
preserve some of that fresh taste for cooking in the off-season like my mama 
used to do. If making tomato sauce, paste, salsa, and juice is for you, the 
following paste tomato varieties are bred to order. Even though any tomato 
variety can be processed, these pear- or plum-shaped types are meatier and 
thicker-walled and usually have less juice, so they’re perfect for cooking. 
Many of these varieties are now bred to be good for fresh eating in salads and 
on sandwiches as well:
 
✓ ‘Amish Paste’: These large, teardrop shaped red fruits are produced on 
indeterminate heirloom plants 85 days after transplanting. The fruits are 
meaty and flavorful, so they’re super for making pastes.
 
✓ ‘Golden Mama’: This 4- to 5-ounce, golden-yellow sauce tomato is pro-
duced 68 days after transplanting. These productive plants are inde-
terminate hybrids. The yellow sauce you can make from this beauty is 
appealing to the eye and has a sweet flavor.
 
✓ ‘Roma’: This is one of the most popular processing tomatoes around. 
This open-pollinated determinate produces 3-ounce, plum-shaped fruits 
on compact vines 78 days after transplanting.

48
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
✓ ‘Super Marzano’: A hybrid version of another popular paste tomato, this 
hybrid indeterminate has 4- to 5-ounce pear-shaped fruits that are more 
disease resistant and productive than their heirloom cousins. The fruits 
mature 70 days after transplanting.
 
✓ ‘Viva Italia’: This sauce tomato is as good fresh as it is processed. It’s a 
determinate hybrid that produces pear-shaped, 3- to 4-ounce fruits with 
great disease resistance 80 days after transplanting.
 
Elongated plum- or pear-shaped tomatoes tend to be more susceptible to 
blossom-end rot (see “Weather-related problems,” later in this chapter, for 
more on this condition). To prevent blossom-end rot, keep the plants well 
watered, and mulch with a 4- to 6-inch-deep layer of hay or straw to keep the 
moisture levels constant. Pick off and throw away any affected fruits, and the 
new ones that develop should be fine.
Introducing the tomato’s relatives
Just like in any family, tomatoes have some odd relatives. Following are 
descriptions of three of the most commonly known tomato relatives. They’re 
all grown similar to tomatoes, but the flavors are much different. Try one of 
these varieties:
 
✓ ‘Husk Cherry’ (Physalis peruviana; also known as ‘Strawberry Tomato’ 
or ‘Cape Gooseberry’): These sprawling plants produce tons of small, 
papery husks similar to Chinese lanterns. Inside each husk is a cherry 
tomato–sized fruit that matures to yellow or gold. The flavor is like a 
sweet wild berry. Kids love these fruits. And because they self-sow read-
ily, once you plant them in the garden, you’ll have them forever. They 
mature 75 days after transplant.
 
✓ ‘Tomatillo’ (Physalis ixocarpa): The standard ingredient in salsa, these 
tomato relatives produce papery husks like the ‘Husk Cherry,’ but the 
fruits inside are ping-pong-ball size and tart rather than sweet. Varieties 
come in yellow and purple fruit colors. Fruits mature 65 days after 
transplant.
 
✓ ‘Tree Tomato’ (Cyphomandra betacea-amarillo): Although technically in 
the tomato family, this tropical plant is as unfamiliar as the uncle you 
rarely see. It’s a small perennial tree native to the Peruvian Andes that 
produces tons of hen’s-egg-sized fruits that range from yellow to red 
when mature. The flavor isn’t like a tomato but more like a tropical fruit.
 
 ‘Tree Tomato’ plants need 18 months of warm weather to mature a crop, 
so unless you have a greenhouse, growing this variety is limited to gar-
deners who live in zone 10 areas. (Flip to the appendix to find out more 
about zones.)

 Chapter 4: Tomatoes: The King of Veggies
Growing Tomatoes with Ease
After you decide on and purchase your tomato varieties, it’s time to get them 
growing. In this section, I explain how to start your tomato plants; plant, 
fertilize, and maintain them; handle insects, diseases, and weather-related 
issues; and harvest them for your enjoyment.
Jump-starting tomatoes
Tomatoes require such a long season to mature that they’re best bought as 
transplants through the mail or from local garden centers. You also can start 
them from seed indoors 4 to 6 weeks before your last frost date (I cover start-
ing seeds indoors in Chapter 13; see the appendix for average frost dates in 
your area). Either way, you simply want to have a stocky, 6- to 10-inch tall, 
dark-green-leafed, flowerless transplant ready to go into the garden after all 
danger of frost has passed.
For gardeners in subtropical areas, such as southern Florida, you can plant 
two crops of tomatoes: one in the spring and another in the fall. Start seed-
lings indoors in January and February for planting outside in March and 
harvesting in May and June. For a fall harvest, start your seeds in July, or 
buy transplants for a late August or September planting. By late fall or winter, 
you’ll be enjoying ripe tomato fruits while colder areas are eating snow.
 
Tomatoes love to be patted. If you’re starting your tomatoes from seed at home, 
keep the plants short and stocky by brushing your hands over the tops of the 
seedlings ten strokes daily starting when they’re 2 ½ inches tall. Research has 
shown that this brushing strengthens the stem and causes the seedling to stay 
short and squat, suffering less transplant shock when planted in your garden.
Tomatoes (and their roots in particular) love heat. To give tomatoes a jump-
start, preheat the garden soil by covering it with dark plastic mulch. Lay the 
plastic sheet over the garden bed, pull it tight, cover the edges with soil, and 
let the plastic heat the soil for 2 weeks before transplanting. While you’re 
waiting for the soil to heat up, harden off your transplants (in other words, 
gradually make them accustomed to the outdoor growing environment) with 
the guidelines in Chapter 13.
Planting, trellising, and pruning
Tomatoes are one of the most forgiving vegetables to grow. But to get the 
best crop, you need to plant properly, keep the fruits off the ground by trel-
lising, and even prune the most vigorous bushes to keep them inbounds. I 
discuss some simple guidelines in the following sections.

50
Part II: Vegging Out 
Planting
 
Here are the basic steps for planting tomato plants:
 
1. Dig a hole twice the diameter and depth of the tomato root ball.
 
2. Place a small handful of all-purpose organic fertilizer or compost into 
the hole.
 
3. Plant the tomato transplant up to its first set of leaves.
 
 Tomatoes have a unique ability to form roots all along their stems. So 
even if you have a tall, leggy, lanky seedling, just bury the stem either 
vertically or horizontally in the ground, leaving at least two sets of 
leaves poking out (see Figure 4-2).
If you’re using plastic mulch, cut (or burn with a propane torch) a 6-inch- 
diameter hole in the plastic, and plant your tomato transplant directly 
through the plastic mulch using the same technique that I walk you through 
earlier.
 
Research has shown that red plastic mulch increases tomato yields by 20 
percent. How? The red mulch reflects specific light wavelengths back into the 
tomato plant stimulating it to produce more fruit.

Trellising
As the weather warms, tomatoes grow quickly. So soon after you transplant, 
you have to decide which trellising method you’ll use to keep your tomatoes 
off the ground. All but the dwarf and dwarf-indeterminate varieties need to be 
staked, caged, wired, or generally held off the ground to minimize the amount 
of rot and pest damage that the plants suffer. Figure 4-3 shows two basic trel-
lising methods, which work well with tomatoes (see Chapter 15 for details):

51
 Chapter 4: Tomatoes: The King of Veggies
 
✓ Staking: To stake your tomato plant, you simply drive a wooden or 
metal stake into the ground right next to the tomato transplant when 
you first plant it. Fasten the main trunk of the tomato to the stake with 
flexible rubber or plastic ties, and then continue adding ties as the plant 
grows. Staking is often combined with pruning to produce fewer, but 
larger fruits.
 
✓ Caging: To cage your tomato plant, buy a large, three-ringed metal cage 
and insert it into the soil around your tomato transplant when you plant. 
Keep any errant branches inside the cage by gently reorienting them. 
This method requires less work than staking, and unless pruned, caged 
plants produce more but smaller fruits.
Pruning
In addition to staking, another way to keep vigorous plants (especially inde-
terminates, which continue to grow all season) in bounds is to prune them. 
Removing extra side branches called suckers (see Figure 4-4) helps direct 
more energy to fruit production and less to leaf and stem production. When 
the suckers are 3 to 4 inches long, remove them from the plant by pinching 
them back to the main stem with your fingers or a pair of scissors.
 
Pruning suckers reduces the overall yield of your tomato plant, but the fruits you 
do get will be larger and will ripen slightly earlier than if you didn’t prune them.

and caging

Fertilizing and maintaining your plants
Tomatoes are generally heavy-feeding plants. They like a soil rich in organic 
matter and compost, but they also respond well to side-dressing with fertil-
izers during the growing season. Maintaining proper moisture and mulching 
also are crucial for producing the best tomatoes possible. I explain every-
thing you need to know in the following sections.
Side-dressing
Side-dressing is adding a small amount of fertilizer around or “on the side” of 
plants after they’re growing. Side-dress with a complete organic fertilizer, such 
as 5-5-5, by sprinkling a small handful of the fertilizer around each plant. Apply 
the first side-dressing when the tomatoes are golf-ball sized, and then apply 
another side-dressing every 3 weeks after that. Scratch the granular fertilizer 
into the top few inches of soil. (Refer to Chapter 15 for more on fertilizers.)
 
Use fertilizers with lower rates of nitrogen; higher rates cause tomato plants to 
sport lots of dark green leaves and produce few tomatoes. Also, try not to get 
any fertilizer on the foliage; it can burn the leaves.
If you prefer to spray your plants, treat your tomatoes to a foliar feeding by 
mixing the fertilizer with water and then spraying it on the plant foliage; this 
is a quick way to get nutrients to your tomato plants. Using fish emulsion or 
seaweed mix, dissolve the fertilizers according to the recommendations on 
the bottle and spray the plants every 3 weeks. Plants can take up nutrients 
faster through their leaves than through their roots, but the effects don’t last 
as long. Some research suggests that spraying plants with a seaweed mixture 
can also help reduce leaf diseases.

53
 Chapter 4: Tomatoes: The King of Veggies
 
Tomatoes also like Epsom salts. Research has shown that 1 tablespoon of Epsom 
salts dissolved in 1 gallon of water and sprayed on the transplants after planting 
and a month later makes for greener and more productive tomatoes.
Watering and mulching
Watering is critical if you want your tomatoes to produce the best quality 
fruits. In general, tomatoes need 1 inch of water a week, but they may need 
more in areas with hot, dry, windy summers. Chapter 15 discusses watering 
strategies in detail.
One of the best things you can do to conserve moisture is to mulch around 
your tomato plants. Plastic mulch conserves some moisture but is best used in 
conjunction with soaker hoses or the ditch watering method (see Chapter 15 
for details). The best water-conservation mulch is a 4- to 6-inch layer of hay or 
straw. The mulch is thick enough to prevent weeds from germinating and stop 
soils from drying out.
 
Hay and straw mulches keep soil cool, but tomatoes love heat. So, if you’re in 
an area that has cool summers, wait until the soil has warmed and the plants 
are thriving before mulching with these materials.
Mulching and watering evenly also prevents many fruit problems, such as 
blossom-end rot and fruit cracking. See the section “Weather-related prob-
lems,” later in this chapter, for details on these conditions.
Eliminating pests and other problems
Tomatoes grow so vigorously that they often outgrow any problems and still 
give you a harvest. But to get the most out of your plants, look out for the 
troubles in the following sections, which are caused by insects, diseases, or 
weather. (For a general description of and a plan of action against common 
insects and diseases, see Chapter 17.)
 
Spray with pesticides only as a last resort; many plants can withstand a small 
infestation of bugs or a few diseased leaves.
Insects to watch for
Here are a few insects that are a particular problem with tomatoes:
 
✓ Tomato hornworm: These huge, green caterpillars, which sometimes grow 
to 4 inches long, look like the monster that ate Tokyo (see Figure 4-5). They 
eat leaves and fruits of tomatoes, and I swear that if you’re quiet enough, 
you can hear them chewing. A few hungry hornworms can devastate a 
tomato plant quickly.

54
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
 The simplest control is to handpick the caterpillars off the plants and 
wrestle them into a can of soapy water to drown. Early morning is the 
best time to remove these pests from plants — like many people, they’re 
still sluggish at this time of day.
 
✓ Tomato fruitworm: This green, 1-inch-long caterpillar with white or 
yellow stripes feeds on foliage and fruits. They can be handpicked from 
plants as with the hornworm; however, for a severe infestation, you also 
can spray plants with Bt.
 
✓ Stink bug: A problem mostly in warmer areas, these 
1⁄2-inch-long gray or 
green shield-shaped insects primarily feed on fruits, causing hard, white 
or yellow spots on the tomato skin. To control stink bugs, keep your 
garden weed-free — the pests hide in weeds around the garden — and 
spray plants with pyrethrin.
 
Figure 4-5:

hornworm

way to a 
meal.
 
Chapter 17 discusses pests and ways to rid your garden of them, such as 
using Bt and pyrethrin, in more detail. Flip there to read more.
Got a disease?
 
Leaf diseases, such as the ones in the following list, can devastate tomatoes:
 
✓ Blights and leaf spots: The devastation starts with the lower leaves get-
ting brown spots, turning yellow, and eventually dying. The symptoms of 
leaf spot look similar to the symptoms of late and early blight. The dis-
ease slowly spreads up the plant, eventually defoliating the whole plant. 
These fungal diseases are particularly active during warm, wet weather. 
To control blight and leaf spots:
 
• Clean up and destroy all diseased foliage in the fall.
 
• Rotate crops, as described in Chapter 16.

55
 Chapter 4: Tomatoes: The King of Veggies
 
• Mulch the plants with plastic, hay, or straw after planting to pre-
vent water from splashing the spores from the ground onto the 
leaves.
 
• Before the condition gets severe, spray with an organic fungicide, 
such as copper or Bacillus subtilis.
 
✓ Verticillium and fusarium wilt: These soil-borne fungal diseases cause 
yellowing, wilting, and early death of tomato plants. Once infected, the 
plants will likely die and should be removed. The best prevention is to 
rotate your plantings and plant wilt-resistant plants (indicated by the 
letters V and F after the variety name).
Luckily, many varieties of tomatoes now are resistant to some of these dis-
eases. Use the guidelines in Chapter 17 to reduce the amount of disease in 
your garden.
Weather-related problems
 
Not all problems with tomatoes are related to insects or diseases. Too much 
or too little water, too much fertilizer, cold temperatures, and varietal dif-
ferences can all contribute to deformed fruits. Here are a few of the more 
common problems and some solutions:
 
✓ Blossom drop: Your tomatoes are flowering beautifully, but the blos-
soms all seem to drop without forming any fruit. This condition, 
called blossom drop, is caused by air temperatures above 90 degrees 
Fahrenheit or below 55 degrees Fahrenheit. At these temperatures, 
most tomato flowers will not set fruits. The solution is to grow varieties 
adapted to the heat (such as ‘Solar Fire’) or cold (such as ‘Cold Set’). Or 
you can protect the plants during flowering with floating row covers.
 
✓ Blossom-end rot: With this condition, the bottom, or blossom end, of 
tomatoes turns brown and rots. Blossom-end rot is caused by fluctuating 
moisture conditions in the soil, so the best cure is to mulch the plants 
well, plant them in well-drained soil, and keep them evenly watered.
 
✓ Fruit cracking: Many types of fruit cracking affect tomatoes, but all 
involve fluctuating moisture conditions and exposure to cold tempera-
tures early in the season. To avoid this problem, plant varieties that are 
less likely to crack (such as ‘Big Beef’), reduce nitrogen fertilization, 
mulch the plants to keep the soil moisture even, and protect flowering 
plants from cold nights with row covers (see Chapter 21).
 
✓ Sunscald: You’ll know that your tomatoes have sunscald if the top 
surfaces of the fruit skins have lightly colored patches. These patches, 
which are caused by direct exposure to the sun, eventually rot. To avoid 
sunscald, grow indeterminate varieties that have lots of foliage to shade 
the fruits (such as ‘Better Boy’), avoid pruning the leaves, and provide 
afternoon shade with shade cloths. Or you can grow the plants in cages 
instead of staking them.

56
Part II: Vegging Out 
Harvesting tomatoes
Harvest tomatoes when they’re fully colored and still firm to the touch. 
Tomatoes don’t need direct sun to ripen, just warm temperatures. Tomatoes 
will continue to ripen indoors if they’re picked too early, so it’s better to err 
on the early side when harvesting. As long as they show some color when 
picked, they’ll ripen indoors with that vine-ripened flavor.
If you want to push the harvest along, you can prune off some new branches 
and tiny fruits to redirect the plant’s energy to the larger, maturing fruits. You 
also can root-prune the plant, cutting 6 inches into the soil in a circle one 
foot away from the stem of the plant. Root-pruning severs some of the roots, 
shocking the plant and forcing it to ripen its fruits faster. It will, however, stop 
the production of new fruits, so this technique is best used at the end of the 
season.
 
If you live in an area with bright sunshine, don’t prune off tomato foliage. 
Removing too much foliage results in sunscald, a condition in which the 
tomato skin literally gets sunburned. Sunscald itself doesn’t ruin the tomato 
crop, but it opens the door for other rot organisms to attack the fruit. (See the 
previous section for more details.)

Meeting the Tomato’s Cousins: 
Peppers and Eggplants
In This Chapter
▶ Surveying sweet, hot, and ornamental pepper varieties
▶ Examining eggplant varieties for all occasions
▶ Growing peppers and eggplants in your garden
P
eppers and eggplants, which are two tomato relatives (they’re all in 
the nightshade, or Solanaceae, family), may not have the popularity of 
their big, red tomato cousins, but their varieties do have a similar diversity of 
tastes, colors, and shapes.
Peppers, in particular, are experiencing a resurgence of interest, and breed-
ers have responded to that interest by creating new and improved variet-
ies. Whether they be sweet or hot peppers, you have many new varieties to 
choose from. No longer simply green, yellow, or red, sweet pepper varieties 
come in a rainbow of colors, including orange, purple, and chocolate. The 
new varieties adapt better to cold and hot temperatures and have more orna-
mental qualities. With the popularity of salsa (which is now the number-one 
condiment in the United States, according to the U.S. government), nachos, 
and spicy foods in general, hot peppers are gaining heaps of attention as well. 
From the mildest jalapeño to the hottest 5-alarm habañero, varieties are avail-
able for all taste buds and heat tolerances.
Eggplants (named because some varieties have fruits the shape and color 
of hens’ eggs), aren’t as popular as peppers, but they have gained a lot of 
attention because of the discovery of varieties other than the traditional 
dark purple, teardrop shape. Long, thin, Oriental types make excellent grilled 
snacks, skin and all. Small, round, green, Asian eggplants are great in soups 
and casseroles. You can even find unusual round, orange, Turkish types that 
are used in specialty ethnic cooking.

58
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
Both peppers and eggplants are beautiful plants to grow in your garden, and 
they make excellent container plants if you have limited space. Some pepper 
varieties have purple stems, leaves, and fruits; eggplants have beautiful purple 
flowers, and the fruits can be a variety of colors, including white, purple, 
striped, green, and orange. So, reserve a spot in the vegetable or flower garden 
for these beautiful, edible fruits.
Producing Plenty of Peppers
An abundance of pepper varieties are available to home gardeners, includ-
ing many new varieties of hot peppers. In the following sections, I classify 
peppers into four groups: sweet bell peppers, sweet nonbell peppers, hot 
peppers, and ornamental peppers. Most of these pepper plants grow to 2 to 3 
feet tall unless otherwise noted.
Those sweet bells
Bell pepper fruits come in blocky, round, or elongated shapes. Most fruits 
start out green but mature through a variety of colors before ripening to their 
final color.
 
The days to maturity given in the following variety descriptions represent the 
time from transplant in the garden to full size. Add 2 weeks to this number to 
know when they’ll mature to their final color. Sweet bells have the sweetest 
flavor when harvested at the mature color stage, but they still can be har-
vested green and taste good.
Variety descriptions for sweet peppers frequently use words such as lobes 
and blocky. No, I’m not talking about ear shapes. When you cut a pepper 
crosswise near the stem, you’ll notice that the walls divide the pepper fruit into 
sections. Pepper experts call these sections cells or lobes. Well-defined lobes or 
cells make peppers blocky. Most bell peppers have three to four lobes. Blocky 
fruits are best used for stuffing or slicing into pepper rings. The thick-walled 
varieties are best for stuffed-pepper recipes.
Here are a few of my favorite varieties of sweet bells, all of which offer good 
disease resistance:
 
✓ ‘Ace’: This early, 3- to 4-inch-long hybrid bell matures within 50 days and 
grows well in cooler climates.
 
✓ ‘Bell Boy’: These four-lobed, thick-walled All-America Selections, or AAS, 
winners yield fruits that turn red on compact (smaller than usual) hybrid 
plants. They mature in 70 days.

59
 Chapter 5: Meeting the Tomato’s Cousins: Peppers and Eggplants
 
✓ ‘Blushing Beauty’: This AAS winning hybrid features 4-inch-long-by-4-
inch-wide blocky fruits that mature in 72 days. The fruit color is amaz-
ing. It starts out ivory white, turns to gold, turns to orange, and then 
finally turns to red. It tastes great at any stage.
 
✓ ‘California Wonder’: These classic, thick-walled, 4-inch-by-4-inch blocky 
hybrid bells mature to red in 75 days and are great for stuffing. They also 
come as a yellow-fruited variety called ‘Golden CalWonder’.
 
✓ ‘Chinese Giant’: These old-fashioned, thick-walled, huge (6 inches by 6 
inches) heirloom bell peppers mature to red and are very sweet. They’re 
good stuffing peppers and mature in 75 days.
 
✓ ‘Chocolate Bell’: These 3- to 4-inch-long hybrid bells mature in 70 days 
to a rich chocolate skin color with red flesh. The fruits have a smokey-
sweet flavor, but sorry, they don’t taste like chocolate.
 
✓ ‘Golden Summer’: These blocky, thick-walled, four-lobe hybrid fruits are 
lime green in color and mature to gold in 67 days.
 
✓ ‘King of the North’: This variety is reportedly one of the best open-
pollinated bell peppers for cool areas with short growing seasons. It 
takes only 57 days to mature the 3- to 4-inch-long, thick-walled fruits that 
start out green and mature to red.
 
✓ ‘Islander’: This unique, light lavender–skinned and pale yellow–fleshed 
hybrid bell pepper also has yellow and orange streaks before turning 
bright red at maturity. These three-lobed fruits are produced within 80 
days.
 
✓ ‘Jingle Bells’: These hybrid bells mature in 60 days. Compact plants are 
loaded with miniature (1 to 2 inches in length and width) bell peppers 
that mature to red.
 
✓ ‘Purple Beauty’: This 4-inch-long heirloom features a short, bushy plant 
with fruits that start out purple and mature to red. The thick-walled, 
sweet fruits are ready to harvest within 75 days.
 
✓ ‘Valencia’: These hybrid plants have good foliage cover and produce 
large, 5-inch-by-5-inch peppers with thick walls and sweet, orange flesh. 
They mature in 70 days.
 
✓ ‘Vidi’: These French hybrid bells mature in 70 days. The plants mature 
into red, 5- to 7-inch-long peppers that withstand less-than-ideal growing 
conditions.
 
✓ ‘Whopper Improved’: It ain’t called a “whopper” for nothin’. This clas-
sic green hybrid bell pepper that turns to red is widely adapted and 
matures in 72 days. The bushy plant has good foliage cover to reduce 
sunscald (lightly colored patches on the fruit caused by direct sun expo-
sure that eventually rot), and it produces reliably large yields of 4-inch-
long-by-4-inch-wide fruits.

Long and round sweet peppers
Sweet peppers are more than big, blocky bells. Some of the sweetest pep-
pers I’ve ever tasted have been long, tapered (or blunt-ended), thin-walled, 
Italian frying types. These types of peppers have gone through a renaissance 
of late, with more varieties available for outdoor grilling, frying, and sautéing 
than ever before. Other great sweet peppers come in round, cherry shapes 
and short, fat heart shapes. Both long and round varieties of pepper plants 
grow 2 to 3 feet tall and most mature to the color red, which is when they’re 
the sweetest. So heat up the frying pan, fire up the grill, and dive in! Here are 
some of my favorites:
 
✓ ‘Biscayne’: These 6-inch-long, 2-inch-wide, Cubanelle-type (which feature 
a blunt end) hybrid bells mature in 65 days. They’re good for frying.
 
✓ ‘Carmen’: An AAS-winning hybrid variety, these bull’s horn–shaped fruits 
are 6 inches long and 2 inches wide. Fruits turn red in 75 days and are 
very productive, making this a great variety for cool-summer gardeners.
 
✓ ‘Corno di Toro’: These bells are original Italian “bull’s horn” peppers. 
They received their name because the fruits are 8 to 10 inches long and 
are curved like the horn of a bull. Three-foot-tall plants ripen yellow or 
red fruits in 68 days. These peppers are great for frying. ‘Sweet Toro’ 
is a newer hybrid version; and now you can purchase a golden version 
called ‘Corno di Toro Yellow’.
 
✓ ‘Cubanelle’: These 6-inch-long, light green, open-pollinated fruits have 
thin walls and blunt ends, making them perfect for frying. They mature 
in 65 days.
 
✓ ‘Giant Marconi’: This AAS-winning variety, which stretches to 8 inches 
long, is known as one of the largest Italian frying peppers available. It 
matures early at 63 days and is high yielding and flavorful. It’s the per-
fect grilling sweet pepper. These hybrid plants are also disease resistant.
 
✓ ‘Gypsy’: These AAS-winners produce 4-inch-long, wedge-shaped fruits 
early in the season; the fruits mature from yellow to orange-red in 60 
days. This hybrid variety is very productive and adapts to many growing 
conditions.
 
✓ ‘Jimmy Nardello’: Okay, so I couldn’t resist a pepper close to being my 
namesake. This tasty variety features very sweet, 8-inch-long, open-
pollinated peppers that mature to red in 90 days. Long, thin, and sweet — 
just like me!
 
✓ ‘Paprika Supreme’: Care to make your own paprika powder? Well, here’s 
the pepper for you. These 7-inch-long, flattened, thin-walled hybrid fruits 
are perfect for drying after they mature; maturation takes 100 days.
 
✓ ‘Peperoncini’: These 4-inch-long, wrinkled, open-pollinated peppers are 
best known as the pickled, light green peppers served in Italian anti-
pasto. They take 62 days to mature.

61
 Chapter 5: Meeting the Tomato’s Cousins: Peppers and Eggplants
 
✓ ‘Sweet Banana’: Probably the most well-known of the long, tapered, 
open-pollinated sweet peppers, these 6-inch-long fruits, which mature 
from yellow to red, are born on compact 1 1/2-foot-tall plants. They take 
72 days to mature. ‘Banana Supreme’ is a hybrid version.
 
✓ ‘Sweet Red Cherry’: These thick-walled, 1 1/2-inch-round sweet open-
pollinated peppers are often available at salad bars and pickled. The 
plants are compact — 1 1/2 feet tall — and are very productive. They 
mature in 78 days.
Peppers that turn on the heat
At one time, the only hot peppers you’d see people eating were the dried 
flakes sprinkled on pasta in Italian restaurants. How times have changed! 
With the growing interest in cuisine from around the world — such as 
Mexican, Korean, Thai, and Indian — hot peppers are enjoying widespread 
popularity.
Speaking generally about hot peppers is difficult, because the flavor and level 
of hotness varies with each type of pepper. But, here’s one general fact to 
keep in mind: Hot pepper plants usually are easier to grow and produce more 
peppers than sweet pepper plants. And because some varieties are so hot 
that they could strip paint, you won’t need to add very many to your cuisine. 
In the following sections, I discuss the factors behind the fire, provide a chart 
for measuring a pepper’s heat, and list some popular varieties.
Understanding the fire of the hot pepper
 
Before getting into hot peppers, you need to understand the heat in hot peppers.
The active ingredient that causes all the fire is called capsaicin (the tiny, 
blisterlike sacs on the inner wall of the fruit, as shown in Figure 5-1), which 
is located on the pepper’s placental wall. You find fewer sacs at the tips of hot 
peppers, so you could bite off the tip of a hot pepper and be fooled into think-
ing it’s not that hot. If you cut into the pepper or handle it roughly, however, 
you break the inner-wall lining, releasing capsaicin throughout the fruit — even 
to the tip.
 
To counteract the hotness of hot peppers, try eating dairy products such as 
yogurt, ice cream, or milk with your hot dishes.
 
Some pepper varieties, such a habañero, are so hot that you can get serious 
burns in your mouth. If you get the capsaicin in your eyes or in a wound, you 
can get burns there also. Check out the new, less hot habañero in the later 
section “Picking some hot peppers to grow.”

Measuring heat with the Scoville scale
To help you decide how hot you want to go with hot peppers, the Scoville 
Heat Scale was developed in 1912. The scale ranges from 0 to 350,000 and 
measures pepper hotness in multiples of 100. Table 5-1 shows some of the 
most popular hot pepper types and their hotness ratings. The chart gives a 
range for each rating because weather, growing conditions, and pepper vari-
ety can all affect how hot a pepper is. This chart can help you decide how hot 
you want your peppers.

Picking some hot peppers to grow
Here are some hot pepper varieties that you can grow:
 
✓ ‘Anaheim TMR 23’: These moderately pungent, open-pollinated, 
smooth-skinned, 7-inch-long-by-2-inch-wide peppers are produced on 
3-foot-tall, leafy, tobacco mosaic virus resistant (TMR) plants. They 
mature in 75 days. You can use the dried pods to make the ristras 
(wreaths of dried peppers) popular in the Southwest.
 
✓ ‘Ancho 211’ (Poblano): These open-pollinated, red, mildly hot, 4-inch-
long, wrinkled, heart-shaped peppers often are stuffed and served as 
chile rellenos. You also can dry them and make them into wreaths or 
powder. They take 80 days to mature.
 
✓ ‘Big Chili II’: This hybrid Anaheim-type roasting pepper is 8 to 10 inches 
long and mildy pungent. Yields are high and early at 68 days.
 
✓ ‘Cherry Bomb’: These mildly hot, 2-inch-round, thick-walled hybrid 
fruits mature in 65 days to a bright red.
 
✓ ‘Habañero’ (Capsicum chinense): These are some of the hottest peppers 
known to mankind! These 1-inch-by-1-inch, lantern-shaped fruits mature 
to orange on 3-foot-tall open-pollinated plants. They thrive in the hot 
weather and take a long season to mature — 100 days. The hottest 
variety of this type is a red variety called ‘Caribbean Red,’ which tops 
445,000 on the Scoville scale.
 
 These hot peppers can be dangerous, so take care when handling and 
eating them.
 
✓ ‘Hungarian Hot Wax’: These medium-hot, 7- to 8-inch-long, tapered 
open-pollinated peppers mature from yellow to red and are great for 
pickling. They take 70 days to mature.
 
✓ ‘Jalapeño M’: The classic salsa, nacho, and pizza hot peppers. These mod-
erately hot, 3-inch-long, round-tipped open-pollinated fruits taste great 
when eaten green or red. ‘Jalapa’ is a more productive hybrid version, and 
‘Tam Jalapeño’ is a milder variety. These peppers take 75 days to mature.
 
✓ ‘Mariachi’: This AAS-winning hybrid hot pepper features high yields of 
4-inch-long and 2-inch-wide mild fruits that are very attractive. The pep-
pers start yellow and mature to red in 66 days.
 
✓ ‘NuMex Joe E. Parker’: A very productive open-pollinated variety of a 
popular breeding line from New Mexico State University. The 6- to 7-inch-
long fruits have a mild to medium spice. They mature in 65 days.
 
✓ ‘Serrano del Sol’: These candle-flame-shaped, 3
1⁄2-inch-long, hot pep-
pers are born abundantly on 3-foot-tall plants. This new hybrid ver-
sion matures 2 weeks earlier and is more productive than the original 
‘Serrano’. With the same heat as jalapeños, they’re great in salsa and 
often are used in sauces. They mature in 64 days.
 
✓ ‘Super Cayenne III’: These 3- to 4-inch-long, fiery hot hybrid fruits taste 
great when eaten green or at mature red. The attractive plants are 2 feet 

64
Part II: Vegging Out 
tall and look good in containers. These peppers take 75 days to mature. 
A similar yellow-fruited variety called ‘Yellow Cayenne’ is also available.
 
✓ ‘Super Chili’: These AAS winners produce an abundance of 2-inch-long, 
cone-shaped, hybrid hot fruits that you can dry or eat fresh. These pep-
pers take 75 days to mature.
 
✓ ‘Thai Hot’: These 1-inch-long, fiery hot peppers from Thailand mature in 
80 days. Compact 1 ½-foot-tall open-pollinated plants bear tons of fruit, 
making them attractive ornamentals as well. You also can try other vari-
eties of this pepper, including ‘Giant Thai Hot’, which produces larger-
sized fruit.
 
✓ ‘Zavory Habañero’: This open-pollinated, first-ever mild habañero pepper 
registers only 100 on the Scoville scale. Red fruits are produced abun-
dantly within 90 days. You can really eat them out of your hand!
Pretty peppers: The ornamentals
Most peppers are produced on plants that are small enough to grow in con-
tainers (see Chapter 18 for more on container gardening) or in the flower 
garden. Not only does their size make them a good fit for container growing, 
but they make an attractive addition as well. Some varieties have been spe-
cifically bred for their attractive fruits, stems, and leaf colors as well as their 
fruit shapes. The ornamentals in the following list are also edible. Here are 
some of my favorites:
 
✓ ‘Black Pearl’: This All-American Selections hybrid pepper with purple 
leaves and stems bears 3/4-inch-round fruits that start out purple and 
mature to red in 60 days. The purple color holds up well in the heat, 
making this a good variety for the South and West.
 
✓ ‘Bolivian Rainbow’: These 2- to 3-foot-tall plants have purple leaves and 
stems and beautiful 1-inch-long fruits. The fruit color starts out purple, 
but changes to yellow and orange, finally maturing to red. You’ll see all 
color stages of fruit on the plants at the same time, making this variety a 
rainbow-colored showstopper. Fruits mature within 80 days.
 
✓ ‘Pretty in Purple’: The leaves, stems, and fruits of these 2
1⁄2-foot-tall 
open-pollinated plants are dark purple. Upon maturity (which takes 75 
days), the 1-inch-long, fiery hot peppers turn red, creating a gorgeous 
ornamental effect.
 
✓ ‘Riot’: These 2- to 3-inch-long open-pollinated hot peppers sit atop short, 
compact plants and blaze from yellow to bright red when mature (70 
days). The effect looks like a riot of color.
 
✓ ‘Sweet Pickle’: Surprise — these aren’t hot ornamental peppers, but 
sweet ones! Two-inch-long, oval, thick-walled fruits on open-pollinated 
plants mature from yellow to orange, purple, and red, often having all 
three colors present on one plant. They take 65 days to mature.

Distinguishing Eggplants by Shape
Lest you think peppers are the only international travelers with variety and 
a zest for life, eggplants also come in a range of shapes, colors, and sizes. 
I arrange the varieties in this section by shape so you can choose the vari-
ety that’s right for your taste and use. The days to maturity in the variety 
descriptions represent the time from transplant to harvest.
Large and oval
Large, oval eggplants are the varieties that most people are familiar with. 
They’re the dark purple, teardrop-shaped fruits that you see in grocery 
stores. The plants grow 3- to 4-feet tall, each producing an average of eight to 
ten fruits. These eggplants are great in casseroles. Here are some of my favor-
ite varieties to grow:
 
✓ ‘Black Beauty’: These large heirloom purple-skinned eggplants grow 
best in areas with long, hot growing seasons. They mature in 75 days.
 
✓ ‘Black Opal’: This hybrid, dark purple, teardrop-shaped variety is a bit 
smaller than the ‘Black Beauty,’ but it has a similar creamy texture and 
flavor. Very productive plants have fruits produced in 65 days.
 
✓ ‘Cloud Nine’: This hybrid has pure-white skin and a delicate flavor with 
no bitterness. The fruits are best harvested when they’re 7 inches long. 
They mature in 75 days.
 
✓ ‘Florida High Bush’: This is an heirloom variety from Florida that loves 
the heat. Large, upright plants produce 10-inch-long, black-purple-
skinned fruits in 85 days.
 
✓ ‘Purple Rain’: These beautiful, white-striped, lavender-skinned hybrid 
eggplants mature early at 66 days and are productive.
 
✓ ‘Rosa Bianca’: This Italian heirloom features white fruits with lavender 
streaks. These fruits, which are best adapted to warm regions, mature in 
75 days.
Cylindrical
Traditionally called Oriental eggplants, these cylindrical fruits are long and 
thin (2 inches wide and up to 10 inches long). The plants are smaller than 
the oval-shaped varieties, reaching only 2 to 3 feet tall, and produce about 15 
fruits. They’re great grilled or used in hors d’oeuvres. These are a few of my 
favorite varieties:

66
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
✓ ‘Fairy Tale’: This early-maturing (50 days), AAS-winning hybrid variety 
features purple-and-white-striped fruits that form in clusters. They’re 
best when harvested at 3 to 4 inches long. The fruits are free of bitter-
ness, have few seeds, and are highly productive.
 
✓ ‘Hansel’: This AAS-winning hybrid variety features deep-purple, finger-
shaped fruits that can be harvested when they’re 3 to 4 inches long, 
which usually takes 55 days. This variety is very productive. A sister to 
‘Hansel’ is ‘Gretel’, which has the same characteristics except that the 
fruit has white skin.
 
✓ ‘Ping Tung Long’: These long, lavender-skinned fruits grow in areas with 
good heat and humidity. The open-pollinated plants are disease resis-
tant, and the fruits take 65 days to mature.
 
✓ ‘Raveena’: This hybrid variety features vigorous plants that yield light 
green, cylindrical fruit in clusters in 70 days. They’re best when har-
vested before they reach 9 inches long.
 
✓ ‘Vittoria’: This hybrid has purple-black skin and is best when harvested 
at 10 inches long. The fruit matures in 61 days.
Small and round
 
The plants in this category grow only 1 to 2 feet tall, making them great for 
container culture. Each plant produces 20 to 25, 1- to 3-inch-round fruits. Even 
though the following eggplants are novelties, they’re also great for skewering 
and pickling:
 
✓ ‘Calliope’: This hybrid features a heavy crop of round, 2-inch-diameter, 
purple-and-white-striped fruits in 64 days on a spineless plant.
 
✓ ‘Easter Egg’: These open-pollinated plants produce white-skinned, egg-
shaped fruits that kids marvel at. They received their name because 
they resemble chicken eggs. They turn yellow at maturity, which takes 
65 days, but they’re best when eaten white; they taste bitter if you allow 
them to mature to yellow.
 
✓ ‘Kermit’: These Thai specialty hybrid fruits have green skin with white 
stripes — very unusual. They take 60 days to mature.
 
✓ ‘Turkish Orange’ (Solanum gilo): These bushy, 2- to 3-foot-tall open-
pollinated plants have good insect resistance and produce fruits that 
mature from green to orange. The fruits are best when eaten green, 
before their skin turns orange and bitter. They take 80 days to mature.

 Chapter 5: Meeting the Tomato’s Cousins: Peppers and Eggplants
Growing Peppers and Eggplants
Many of the cultural instructions (instructions on how to grow a plant) for pro-
ducing tomatoes (see Chapter 4) hold true for peppers and eggplants as well. 
But, of course, peppers and eggplants have some of their own special require-
ments as well, as you find out in this section.
A few guidelines for starting and planting
 
Peppers and eggplants are warm-season crops, so you don’t need to rush to 
plant them until the ground has warmed up sufficiently. Here are some guide-
lines you can follow:
 
✓ In most areas, you need to start peppers and eggplants from seed 
indoors, usually 6 to 8 weeks before the last frost date for your area (see 
the appendix for first and last frost dates). You also can purchase them 
from a local nursery or through the mail as transplants. (See Chapter 13 
for seed-starting basics.)
 
✓ If you live in zone 9 or 10, you can sow the seeds directly into your garden. 
If you keep the plants healthy and have no frost in your area, peppers and 
eggplants can actually be perennials (plants that grow year-round) and 
will bear fruit all season.
However, even in cold climates, I’ve dug up pepper plants and eggplants in 
fall, placed them in pots in my greenhouse all winter, and then transplanted 
them back out in spring. Even after three years these plants remain attractive 
and healthy.
 
Peppers and eggplants are more finicky than tomatoes are about tempera-
tures, fertilization, and general growing conditions, so they’re less forgiving 
of mistakes. So, you need to be extra cautious about starting pepper and 
eggplant seedlings early indoors. Give them ample light, fertilizer, and water; 
harden them off well; and wait to plant until the soil temperature is at least 
60 degrees Fahrenheit. You should purchase or have grown a 4- to 6-inch-
tall, dark-green-leafed, stocky transplant that isn’t root-bound (roots growing 
around the container).
One handy product you may want to purchase is a soil thermometer. Usually 
costing less than $20, a soil thermometer can help you gauge when to plant 
warm-season crops such as peppers and eggplants. Place it in a shady spot 
and take readings in the morning for accuracy.

68
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
If your peppers have flowered or set fruits before you’ve transplanted them or 
when the seedlings still have only four to six leaves each, remove any blossoms 
or fruits. The plants will then send more energy to grow more leaves and roots to 
support a larger harvest later rather than maturing only a few peppers early.
Peppers and eggplants grow best in raised beds (see Chapter 3) because the 
soil warms faster and drains quicker. The following guidelines can help you 
get the soil temperature right depending on your climate:
 
✓ Cold areas: Cover the top of the beds with black or dark green plastic 
mulch to preheat the soil a few weeks before planting. (See Chapter 15 
for details on how to use mulch in your garden.)
 
✓ Warm areas: Mulch with straw, white plastic, or aluminum foil in 
summer to help keep the soil cool. Aluminum foil also reflects light back 
into the sky, confusing insects trying to find plants.
To plant eggplant and pepper transplants, use scissors to cut holes in the 
plastic mulch every 1 to 1
1⁄2 feet (wider for taller varieties) for peppers and 
every 2 to 3 feet for eggplants. If you’re using mulch that isn’t plastic, plant at 
the same distances as you would in plastic mulch. Plant eggplant and pepper 
transplants at the same soil level as they are in their containers. Cover the 
plantings with a floating row cover (a lightweight, cheesecloth-like material 
that lets air, water, and sunlight through to keep the air warm and bugs out; 
see Chapter 21).
Even though pepper and eggplant plants are usually strong enough to stand 
on their own without supports, I like to either stake or cage tall, heavy-yielding 
varieties such as ‘Carmen’ and ‘Black Beauty’. Staking or caging the plants 
keeps fruits off the ground, making them less likely to rot during wet weather. 
I find that I get heavier yields this way as well. Use small stakes or tomato 
cages to keep your plants vertical (see Chapter 15 for more supporting your 
vegetables).
Fertilizing and watering tips
 
Peppers and eggplants are sensitive to excessive fertilizer, in particular nitro-
gen. Plants fertilized with too much nitrogen will grow large but have few 
fruits. However, don’t neglect fertilizing your plants; simply avoid using high 
rates of nitrogen fertilizers. Instead, apply a 2- to 3-inch layer of compost over 
the bed and a small handful of 5-5-5 organic fertilizer around each transplant. 
(Chapter 15 has more on fertilizing.)
Water your plants well, following the suggestions in Chapter 15. Watering is 
particularly important during 90-degree weather when water stress and high 
temperatures can cause flowers to drop. Side-dress (add fertilizer around the 
plants during the growing season) around the drip line (where water naturally 

69
 Chapter 5: Meeting the Tomato’s Cousins: Peppers and Eggplants
drips off the ends of leaves) of the plant with a tablespoon of organic 
fertilizer, such as 5-5-5.
 
To give your peppers a boost, mix 1 tablespoon of Epsom salts in 1 gallon of 
water and spray the pepper plants when they’re flowering.
Pest patrol
 
If you see holes in a pepper fruit and find a small, white worm inside the fruit, 
consider it your introduction to the pepper maggot. The adult fly lays eggs on 
the fruit in midsummer. After the eggs hatch, the larvae tunnel into the fruit. 
To control these pests, do the following:
 
✓ Rotate crops
 
✓ Cover young plants with row covers
 
✓ Grow varieties such as ‘Serrano’ and ‘Jalapeño’ that are less attractive to 
the maggots
 
✓ Hang yellow sticky traps before the adult flies lay eggs. Remove rotten 
fruits that may harbor the flies before you hang the traps.
Peppers and eggplants generally have fewer pest problems than their tomato 
cousins, but they share such pests and diseases as blossom drop, sunscald, 
blossom-end rot, fruitworms (also called corn earworms), and Verticillium 
wilt (see Chapter 4). Flea beetles (see Chapter 17) and Colorado potato 
beetles (see Chapter 6) love eggplants. Chapter 17 describes other insect and 
disease problems that affect all vegetables.
Harvesting tips
Peppers and eggplants are great to grow because you don’t have to wait until 
the fruits are fully mature before you pick them. Consider your options for 
both fruits:
 
✓ Peppers: You can pick and enjoy sweet peppers green or wait until 
they ripen to orange, yellow, or red for a sweeter taste. Hot peppers 
vary in their hotness depending on stress. Stressed peppers tend to be 
hotter, so if you withhold water and fertilizer when the hot peppers are 
ripening, you can increase the heat in the peppers’ flavor. Cool, cloudy 
weather tends to make hot peppers less hot.
 
✓ Eggplants: You can pick eggplants at almost any stage. The key is to not 
let them become overmature; otherwise the texture will become soft and 
mushy. To check eggplant maturity, watch the fruit’s skin. A dull-colored 

70
Part II: Vegging Out 
skin means it’s overmature. Double-check by cutting into the fruit and look-
ing at the seeds. Brown-colored seeds are another sign of overmaturity.
 
 A simple test for maturity is to push the eggplant’s skin with your fin-
gernail. If the skin bounces back, the fruits are ready to harvest. If your 
nail indents the skin, the fruits are overmature. If your fruits are really 
mature and rotting on the vine, just pick them and throw them out; they 
won’t taste very good.
The key to harvesting is to do it often. The more often you harvest, the more 
peppers and eggplants you get. To harvest, cut peppers and eggplants with 
a sharp knife just above the top of the green cap on the fruit. The fruits will 
continue to ripen after you harvest them, so store them in a cool place. If you 
want to dry your peppers, pick them when they mature and hang them to dry 
in a warm room with good air circulation. See Chapter 19 for more tips on 
preserving your harvest.
 
Harvesting hot peppers and eggplants can be tricky, so use gloves when 
harvesting them. Hot peppers need careful handling because they contain 
capsaicin, which can easily cause burning, especially in your eyes or in open 
cuts. (Believe it or not, I’ve known of gardeners having to go to the hospital to 
be treated for burns from hot peppers.) Some eggplant varieties have sharp 
spines on their stems, so be sure to work around them when harvesting the 
fruits. Or consider growing spineless varieties such as ‘Fairytale’ and ‘Hansel’.

oot-crop vegetables are an example of those good things in life that you 
can’t actually see. Their tops are green, unassuming, and may even be 
mistaken for weeds — but oh, when you give them a yank! I can still remem-
ber the look on my daughter’s face when she first helped me dig potatoes 
and discovered that they grow underground. Digging for potatoes was like 
a treasure hunt. I think that most gardeners feel that same sense of wonder 
and excitement when they dig or pull up their root crops. The result is always 
something marvelous.
You can grow many different root crops, but the big three are carrots, onions, 
and potatoes. They aren’t botanically related like peppers, eggplants, and 
tomatoes are (see Chapters 4 and 5); what these crops do have in common, 
however, is that they’re grown for their underground parts: roots, bulbs, or 
modified stems (underground stems that expand to produce large, edible 
areas; potatoes’ stems are called tubers). I provide plenty of growing tips for 
carrots, onions, and potatoes in this chapter; I discuss other root crops in 
Chapter 11.
A Rabbit’s (and Gardener’s) 
Favorite Root: Carrots
Carrot (Daucus carota) varieties are categorized by their shape. You can 
grow long, thin carrots; short, stocky carrots; and even little, round, baby 
carrots. A few varieties are supercharged with vitamins, and many hybrids 

72
Part II: Vegging Out 
have added vigor and disease resistance. The latest trend in carrots is color-
ful roots. Roots no longer come in just orange — now you can grow varieties 
that are white, yellow, red, and purple, too!
 
If you’re trying to decide which carrot variety to grow, consider your type of 
soil as well as the use you plan for the carrots. Loose, sandy soil is good for 
growing any root crop. If you have heavy, clay soil, consider a variety that’s 
shorter in length, such as ‘Short ’n Sweet’. It’s easier for this short carrot vari-
ety to push into the heavy soil than a long, thin, tapered root variety. (Chapter 
14 has more information about soil types.)
Classifying carrots by type
Carrots often are described as a certain type, such as baby carrots. If the carrot 
type is part of a variety name, you can determine what the carrot will look like 
when it matures. Table 6-1 shows the common types of carrots and their char-
acteristics. All the types listed, except baby carrots and Imperators, range in 
size from 6 to 8 inches. Aside from eating the carrots fresh, you can best use 
certain varieties for juicing and storing; some even grow well in containers.
Table 6-1 
Carrot Types
Type
Size and Uses
Best Soil Type
Baby
Short (3 to 4 inches); early 
maturing; grows well in con-
tainers; great for salads and 
roasting.
Grows best in heavy, clay 
soil.
Chantenay
Wide shoulders (the top of the 
carrot root) and tapered to a 
point; good grated in salads 
or cooked.
Grows well in heavy soil.
Danvers
Tapered to a point; thinner 
and longer than Chantenay; 
good for storing.
Grows best in sandy, loose 
soil.
Imperator
Similar to Danvers, just longer 
(10 to 12 inches); good cooked 
and in soups and stews.
Grows best in sandy soil.
Nantes
Cylindrical shape with blunt 
end; good for juicing.
Grows well in sandy soil.
Most short varieties that you find in grocery stores are baby carrots, and 
the longer carrots may be any of the other types mentioned in Table 6-1. The 
bagged “baby-size” carrots in grocery stores are often just normal-sized 

73
 Chapter 6: Growing Underground Crops: Carrots, Onions, and Potatoes
carrots peeled down to a small, rounded size. Look for carrots with the tops 
still showing for true baby carrots. Baby carrots may be varieties that are 
naturally short or larger varieties harvested at an immature stage.
Examining some carrot varieties
Knowing what type of carrot a certain variety is can help you when deciding 
which variety to grow. With some of the most widely known carrot varieties, 
you can easily identify the carrot type because it’s part of the variety’s name; 
some examples include ‘Scarlet Nantes’ and ‘Danvers 126’. Otherwise, you 
simply read the description to find out.
The carrot varieties in the following list fall into one of the five types of car-
rots identified in Table 6-1, but they also have special characteristics that 
may make them perfect for your garden; they’re flavorful, disease resistant, 
and easy to grow. All are good for baking. The days to maturity are from seed-
ing in the ground until first harvest; however, early season carrot varieties 
are flavorful even when you harvest them before they fully mature:
 
✓ ‘Atomic Red’: This Imperator-type, open-pollinated carrot features 
9-inch-long roots that are red from skin to core. The color deepens and 
flavor becomes milder when cooked. This variety matures in 70 days.
 
✓ ‘Bolero’: This hybrid, Nantes-type carrot produces 6-inch-long roots and 
8135*has extra disease resistance and stores well. It matures in 72 days. 
‘Yaya’ is a newer hybrid Dutch variety that’s sweeter and matures earlier 
(60 days) than ‘Bolero’.
 
✓ ‘Danvers 126’: These heat-resistant, open-pollinated roots produce 
heavy yields of 7- to 8-inch-long carrots 70 days after planting.
 
✓ ‘Healthmaster’: This hybrid, Danvers-type variety grows up to 10 inches 
long and contains 30 percent more vitamin A than other carrot varieties. 
It matures in 110 days.
 
✓ ‘Kuroda’: This hybrid, 6-inch-long, Chantenay-type produces heavy 
yields of tender carrots that are good for juicing and storing. It matures 
in 79 days.
 
✓ ‘Little Finger’: This open-pollinated variety is an early (65 days), 3-inch-
long, smooth-skinned, small-cored baby carrot that’s sweet. ‘Little 
Finger’ carrots are great for planting in containers.
 
✓ ‘Merida’: This hybrid, Nantes-type, 7- to 8-inch-long carrot can be 
planted in spring for fall harvest. However, it’s most often grown as a 
fall crop and in mild-winter areas, such as the Pacific Northwest, where 
it can overwinter (live through the winter) and be harvested in spring. It 
matures in 75 days.
 
✓ ‘Parmex’: This hybrid, baby-type carrot features 1
1⁄2-inch-diameter round 
roots that are harvested in 50 days. Great for planting in shallow soils.

74
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
✓ ‘Purple Haze’: This hybrid, 10- to 12-inch-long Imperator has purple 
skin and an orange core. This sweet variety’s purple color fades when 
cooked. It matures in 70 days.
 
✓ ‘Scarlet Nantes’: This heirloom, Nantes-type variety has bright red-orange 
flesh with a small core. The 6- to 7-inch-long roots mature in 65 days.
 
✓ ‘Short ’n Sweet’: This 4-inch, open-pollinated, Chantenay-type carrot 
grows well in heavy clay soil and containers. It matures in 68 days.
 
✓ ‘Sugarsnax’: This hybrid, Imperator-type variety is as tender and sweet 
as a Nantes variety, yet it grows up to 9 inches long, is disease resistant, 
and is high in beta carotene. It matures in 68 days.
 
✓ ‘Thumbelina’: This unusual hybrid, baby-type, All-America Selections 
winner (see Chapter 4) has a round root that’s the length of a silver 
dollar; it’s especially good for baking. It grows well in containers and in 
heavy clay or rocky soil. It matures in 65 days. Kids love this variety for 
its small size and easy-growing nature.
 
✓ ‘White Satin’: This hybrid, Nantes and Imperator cross features 8-inch-
long crisp, textured white roots that grow under a wide range of soil and 
weather conditions. It matures in 68 days.
Onions: The Bulbs with Layers 
of Sweet and Pungent Goodness
The two most important factors to consider when choosing onion (Allium cepa) 
varieties are flavor of the onion and location of your garden. Although most 
people use taste as their first criterion, the old advice about “location, location, 
location” has greater relevance when growing onions. Onions are particular 
about how much sunlight they get, forming bulbs in response to the number of 
daylight hours. As a result, onion varieties are classified by day length — long 
day, short day, or intermediate day (also known as day neutral) — as well as by 
taste — sweet (which are good for eating raw or freshly cooked) or pungent 
(which are good for storing).
 
In general, short-day onions grow well in the southern United States, long-day 
onions grow well in the northern United States, and intermediate-day onions 
grow well in the in-between regions.
See the later sidebar “What a difference a day makes!” if you really want to 
get into a discussion on day length and onions. If you want to avoid the whole 
issue, try growing some fun onion relatives, such as leeks, garlic, and shal-
lots, which I discuss in Chapter 11.

 Chapter 6: Growing Underground Crops: Carrots, Onions, and Potatoes
Choosing your onion varieties
In the following lists of my favorite onion varieties, I distinguish between 
onions that are long day, short day, and intermediate day (or day neutral). 
Within each group are sweet and pungent varieties. These varieties are the 
most widely adapted (able to grow in a wide variety of geographic regions 
under various weather conditions) and easiest to grow. Keep in mind that 
pungent onions are much better for storage than sweet varieties. (You can 
read more about storage in Chapter 19.)
I also indicate whether you can purchase the variety as a set (small onions that 
have been pregrown so that they mature faster) or as a plant (or both). (Check 
out the appendix for a listing of companies that specialize in onion sets and 
plants.) The days to maturity are from either directly seeding in the garden or 
setting out (placing outdoors) sets or plants. Short-day onions are generally 
planted in fall to grow through the winter, so they take longer to mature than 
other types. Long- and intermediate-day onions are usually planted in spring. 
All the onions have yellow skin and white flesh unless otherwise noted.
Short-day onions include the following varieties:
 
✓ ‘Giant Red Hamburger’: This open-pollinated, sweet, short-day variety 
features dark red skin and red-and-white flesh. It matures in 95 days from 
seeding and can be purchased as a plant.
 
✓ ‘Granex 33’ (Vidalia): This classic hybrid sweet onion is a well-
known short-day variety. It is available as a plant and is popular in the 
Southeast. It matures in spring, 180 days after fall seeding.
 
✓ ‘Texas Grano 1015’ (Texas Supersweet): This sweet, short-day, hybrid 
variety can grow as large as a baseball and still remain sweet. It’s also 
available as a plant and is popular in Texas and in the Southwest. It 
matures 175 days from fall seeding.
Intermediate-day (or day-neutral) onion varieties include the following:
 
✓ ‘Candy’: This sweet, hybrid, intermediate-day onion is widely adapted. 
It’s also available as a plant. It matures 85 days after seeding.
 
✓ ‘Italian Red Torpedo’: This sweet, Italian heirloom, intermediate-day, 
red onion forms a bottle-shaped bulb with a mild taste and pink flesh. It 
matures 110 days after seeding.
 
✓ ‘Superstar’: This All-America Selections winning, hybrid, white-skinned, 
sweet onion produces a 1-pound, disease-resistant, uniform, mild-tasting 
bulb 109 days from planting. It’s isn’t good for long-term storage because 
of its extra sweetness.

76
Part II: Vegging Out 
Long-day onion varieties include the following:
 
✓ ‘Ailsa Craig Exhibition’: This yellow-skinned, open-pollinated variety is 
known for its sweet, 2-pound bulbs that mature 105 days after seeding. It 
tolerates cool weather well.
 
✓ ‘Borrettana cipollini’: Cipollini are unique heirloom, Italian, flat-shaped 
varieties. The ‘Borrettana’ variety produces 2-inch-diameter yellow 
sweet onions that are great braided and good caramelized and sautéed. 
It matures 110 days after seeding. ‘Red Marble’ is a good red cipollini-
type variety.
 
✓ ‘Copra’: You can store this hybrid, pungent variety until spring. It 
matures 104 days after seeding.
 
✓ ‘Purplette’: This open-pollinated, purple-skinned mini-onion is best har-
vested when 3 to 4 inches in diameter 60 days after seeding. It has mild, 
sweet pink flesh and is a good one for pickling. It also can be used as a 
scallion (see the next section).
 
✓ ‘Yellow Sweet Sandwich’: This hybrid variety actually gets sweeter 
in storage and comes in a white-skinned version called ‘White Sweet 
Sandwich’. Both versions are available as plants. The variety matures 
100 days after seeding.
 
✓ ‘Walla Walla Sweet’: This sweet, hybrid variety has light yellow flesh 
and good cold tolerance. It’s available as a plant and is popular in the 
Northwest. It matures 115 days after seeding.
 
✓ ‘Yellow Stuttgarter’: This pungent, standard, open-pollinated storage 
variety often is sold as a set. It matures in about 90 days from a set and 
120 days after seeding.
Looking at scallions and perennial onions
You may have run across some other onion types in restaurants or produce 
markets. For example, scallions (also called bunching onions, spring onions, 
or green onions) are picked for their delicate, juicy, green tops before they 
form bulbs. Scallions take up less space in your garden than regular onions 
because you can plant them closer together, and they can give you a quick 
crop when planted in spring or fall. Growing scallions is a good way for 
novice onion growers to start.
Any onion variety grown from a seed can be harvested as a scallion, but here 
a few varieties that are especially widely adapted as scallions:
 
✓ ‘Evergreen Hardy White’ (Allium fistulosum): This hardy, white-stalked 
variety is a great one for cold climates (USDA zone 5), and it can 
overwinter if protected and used as a perennial. It matures 65 days 
after seeding.

77
 Chapter 6: Growing Underground Crops: Carrots, Onions, and Potatoes
 
✓ ‘Red Beard’ (Allium fistulosum): This tender variety has unique coloring: 
a red stem with a white tip and green leaves. It matures 45 days after 
seeding.
 
✓ ‘White Spear’: This heat-resistant scallion features blue-green leaves 
and thick white stems. Good for warm climates. It matures 65 days after 
seeding.
Multiplier, or perennial, onions come back year after year and reproduce 
easily. Here are the two main types:
 
✓ Egyptian top-set onions (also known as walking or tree onions): These 
onions reproduce by forming clusters of onion sets on the tips of their 
growing stalks, as shown in Figure 6-1. As the weight pulls the stalks 
down, the clusters root wherever they land, making the onions look like 
they’re walking slowly across your garden. During the winter months, 
Egyptian top-set onions primarily are eaten as scallions, but the top-sets 
make good, small, sweet onions when you pick them in summer. They’re 
also very cold hardy.
 
✓ Potato onions: These onions form a main onion in summer from a fall 
planting. They’re hardy to USDA zone 4 and produce many smaller sets 
that you can replant after summer harvest to produce more onions the 
following year.
What a difference a day makes!
The long-day, short-day, intermediate-day onion 
issue can get confusing. Short-day onions form 
bulbs when they receive 11 to 12 hours of day-
light, while long-day onions form with 14 to 16 
hours of daylight. Generally, gardeners north of 
35 degree latitude (a line running from northern 
North Carolina through Oklahoma and Arizona 
to central California) grow long-day onions 
because their summer days are long enough 
to initiate bulb formation. Gardeners south of 
that line grow short-day onions because they’re 
closer to the equator and their day lengths are 
pretty steady at 12 hours. Gardeners in the South 
also have the luxury of planting short-day onions 
in fall, overwintering them (because of their mild 
winters), and harvesting in late spring.
Northern gardeners need to plant long-day 
onions in spring for a summer harvest. If you 
were to plant long-day onions, such as the 
‘Copra’ variety, in the South, they’d never 
receive enough daylight hours to bulb up. 
Likewise, short-day onions, such as the famous 
‘Vidalia’ onions, grown in spring in the North, 
would bulb up quickly while the plants were 
small because they’d receive the necessary 12 
hours of daylight early in the season. The end 
result would be small bulbs.
Modern plant breeders have made this whole 
task a bit easier by introducing intermediate-
day varieties that aren’t as dependent on cer-
tain amounts of daylight hours to form bulbs. 
These varieties like intermediate lengths of 
daylight (12 to 14 hours) and grow best in hardi-
ness zones 5 through 8 (see the appendix for 
more about zones).

Potatoes: No Longer a Boring Spud
If I had to vote on the most underrated vegetable in the world, I would 
choose the potato (Solanum tuberosum). Potatoes have a reputation for being 
common, widely available, inexpensive, and just plain brown and boring. 
Why bother growing them? Well, first of all, the flavor and texture of fresh 
potatoes dug from the soil is much better than the bagged spuds that sit 
on grocery-store shelves for weeks. It’s also fun to grow the many different 
varieties, including novelty potatoes such as purple-, red-, or yellow-fleshed 
varieties. You’ll surely astound your family and dinner guests with these not-
so-plain potatoes.
 
Potatoes are one of the most foolproof crops to grow. Start planting early, 
while the weather is still cool, by placing a piece of the tuber (called a seed 
potato) in a furrow, or trench. After the potatoes start growing, if you hill them 
(push soil around the plants), water them, and keep the bugs away, you’re 
almost guaranteed some great tubers. I explain more about planting potatoes 
and provide tips on growing sweet potatoes, a special kind of root crop, later 
in this chapter.
Potatoes classified
Potato varieties usually are classified as early-, mid-, and late-season from 
the time you plant the seed potato to harvest. If you have a short growing 
season, grow early-season plants. If you have a longer growing season, you’ll 
be safe with the late-season plants. If you want to have a constant supply of 
potatoes all summer, grow a few of each. Table 6-2 shows the approximate 
number of days to maturity for each category.

Selecting a few potato varieties
So many potato varieties are available that narrowing the field is often dif-
ficult. However, you may want to try some of my favorites, which I describe 
in the following list. I’ve included some fingerling varieties that are the latest 
rage; they produce an abundance of small, fingerlike tubers that are great 
roasted, fried, or steamed. Here are my favorite potato varieties in terms of 
flavor, color, and ease of growing:
 
✓ ‘All Blue’: This mid- to late-season spud has blue skin and flesh. It has 
a mealy texture, so it’s best as a mashed potato. Yes, blue mashed pota-
toes! You also can grow a similar ‘All Red’ (also known as ‘Cranberry 
Red’) variety that has red skin on the outside and pink flesh on the 
inside. Combined with ‘All Blue’ potatoes and a white variety, you can 
create a red, white, and blue mashed potato extravaganza!
 
✓ ‘Butte’: This late-season variety is the classic Idaho baking potato. It’s a 
great russetted (has rough, brown-colored skin) baking variety that fea-
tures 20 percent more protein and 58 percent more vitamin C than other 
varieties. It’s also tolerant of scab disease and late blight. (See the later 
section “Keeping Your Root Crops Healthy and Pest-Free” for more on 
these problems.)
 
✓ ‘Caribe’: This early, lavender-skinned, white-fleshed variety produces 
large tubers. A great masher.
 
✓ ‘Kennebec’: This all-purpose midseason variety with white skin and 
flesh is dependable, resists disease, and is good for almost any use.
 
✓ ‘King Harry’: This early-season, gold-skinned and white-fleshed variety 
is unique for its hairy leaves that reportedly ward off insects, such as 
Colorado potato beetles, leafhoppers, and flea beetles (see Chapter 17). 
Oh, and the spuds taste great, too!
 
✓ ‘Red Norland’: This early variety has red skin and white flesh. Harvested 
early when plants are just flowering, this variety is commonly sold in 
markets as a new red potato. It tastes best boiled or mashed.
 
✓ ‘Rose Finn Apple’: This late-maturing fingerling variety features rose-
colored skin and yellow flesh. It has a firm, moist texture and is great 
baked or boiled.

80
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
✓ ‘Russian Banana’: This late-season, fingerling-type variety has a banana 
shape with a waxy yellow skin and flesh. You’ll find it great for roasting 
and boiling.
 
✓ ‘Superior’: This early-season tuber has buff-colored skin and white flesh. 
It’s scab disease–resistant, grows under a wide range of conditions, and 
stores for a long time. A keeper!
 
✓ ‘Viking Purple’: This midseason, purple-skinned, white-fleshed variety 
can endure dry weather and stores well. It tastes great boiled or mashed.
 
✓ ‘Yukon Gold’: This very early variety with yellow skin and flesh produces 
high yields and is drought tolerant. It’s a great keeper; in fact, I’ve been 
known to still be eating this variety from storage 8 months after harvest. 
This moist-fleshed potato is best in salads or boiled. Plus it makes a 
great chip!
 
Even though most potatoes are grown from seed potatoes, you can grow 
potatoes from seeds just as you do with tomatoes and peppers. One hybrid, 
late-maturity, true-seed variety that’s currently available is called ‘Catalina’ 
(which is very similar to ‘Kennebec’). For best results, start seeds indoors a 
month before planting. You grow your crop the same way that you grow other 
potatoes. Growing potatoes from seeds is a bit trickier but less expensive than 
planting seed potatoes, and you reduce the chance of passing on any tuber-
borne diseases to your new crop. (See the later section “Keeping Your Root 
Crops Healthy and Pest-Free” for more on potato diseases.)
Growing and Gathering Root Crops
Root crops are easy to grow if you have good soil, water, and proper spacing. 
The mystery of root crops is that you can’t see the reward until you dig them 
up. But that’s half the fun of growing them.
General guidelines for all your root crops
The keys to growing great root crops are preparing the soil bed well and 
giving the plants room to grow. You also need to keep the crops clear of 
weeds and make sure they have enough water. Here are further details on 
each of these important points:
 
✓ All root crops like well-drained, loose, fertile soil. And with the excep-
tion of potatoes, which grow best in hills (as you find out later in this 
chapter), root crops grow best in raised beds (see Chapter 3 for more 
on these special beds). They also can grow if you have a gardening spot 
that gets only 4 to 6 hours of direct sun a day. Try some carrots and 
onions in that patch.

81
 Chapter 6: Growing Underground Crops: Carrots, Onions, and Potatoes
 
 To prepare the soil, add a 3- to 4-inch layer of compost or manure at 
least 2 to 3 months before you’re ready to plant. If you wait until just 
before planting to add fresh compost or manure, you’re likely to get 
poor growth. Why? Too much nitrogen fertilizer on carrots and potatoes 
in spring promotes foliage growth but not good tuber and root forma-
tion. Instead, root crops enjoy phosphorous, which promotes root 
growth, so perform a soil test (see Chapter 14), and based on the results, 
add bone meal or rock phosphate fertilizer before planting to keep your 
roots happy.
 
 Onions in particular like lots of fertilizer, and they can stand some extra 
nitrogen, which promotes leaf growth. Add extra fertilizer when the 
transplants are 6 inches tall and the bulbs begin to swell. Then add a 
complete organic fertilizer, such as 5-5-5, at 1 pound per 10 feet. (See 
Chapter 15 for more on fertilizers.)
 
✓ Root crops, especially carrots and onions, require proper spacing to 
grow at their best. Thin out the young seedlings when they’re 3 to 4 
weeks old by pulling them out or snipping them until they’re properly 
spaced (see Chapter 13 for details on thinning seedlings). Onions should 
be 4 inches apart, scallions 2 inches apart, and carrots 3 inches apart. 
Potatoes don’t need thinning and should be planted 8 to 10 inches apart 
when planted.
 
 I know that thinning your hearty crops sounds cruel, but if you don’t 
do it, the roots won’t have enough room to expand, causing you to get 
lots of plants but few roots — and fewer roots means fewer carrots and 
onions.
 
✓ You’ll be rewarded with lots of crisp roots in no time if you regularly 
weed your root crop patch. After a good thinning, hand-weed beds of 
carrots and onions; potatoes can be weeded with a hoe. Mulch the bed 
with hay or straw. You don’t have to mulch in between individual onion 
and carrot plants. Simply mulch around the beds, and keep them well 
watered.
Carrots, onions, and potatoes are root crops that like cool temperatures. 
They grow best and have the best flavor when temperatures stay below 80 
degrees Fahrenheit.
Cultivating carrots
Carrot seeds are small and take up to 2 weeks to germinate, so you run a 
greater risk of poor germination with them than with other vegetables. To get 
your carrots off on the right foot, try these tips:
 
✓ Prevent forked roots in carrots by making sure the soil is free of 
rocks, sticks, and hard pieces of soil. If carrot roots come in contact 
with a hard object as they’re growing, they fork, creating a multipronged 

82
Part II: Vegging Out 
carrot. Even though they’re interesting to look at and a conversation 
piece at dinner, forked roots are harder to clean and yield fewer carrots. 
No soil can be completely free of rocks and sticks, but when building a 
raised bed try to remove as many as possible. And be sure to amend the 
soil with compost to make the soil looser so the roots stay straight. If 
your soil is heavy clay or a rock jungle, try growing round varieties such 
as ‘Thumbelina’.
 
✓ For easier germination of small carrot seeds, try purchasing pelleted 
seeds. These seeds are covered with a biodegradable coating, making 
the seed larger and easier to handle. However, the seed germination isn’t 
affected. Sprinkle carrot seeds on the top of the soil and then cover them 
with a thin layer of potting soil or sand. Potting soil and sand are lighter 
than garden soil, enabling tender seedlings to more easily grow through.
 
✓ Keep your soil moist. If it dries, the seedlings can quickly die. (See 
Chapter 15 for more on watering.)
 
✓ Grow carrots as a fall crop, starting 1 to 2 months before your first 
frost date. They germinate faster in the warmer soil of summer, and 
their flavor is sweeter when they mature in cooler fall weather. In hot-
summer areas, you may need to shade your newly sown soil with a 
shade cloth; hot soil temperatures hinder proper seed germination. (The 
appendix has more on frost dates.)
If your carrot tops break off during harvest (some always do), use a garden 
fork to dig up their roots. Pull the largest carrot roots first to leave room for 
the smaller roots to fill out. And if you can’t eat all your carrots before the 
first freeze, lay a 6- to 8- inch-thick layer of hay or straw over the carrot bed. 
This layer of protection will keep the soil thawed, allowing you to go out on a 
winter’s day and harvest fresh carrots right until spring.
If you’re really hungry for carrots and can’t wait until they fully mature, you 
can harvest young carrots anytime after the roots have formed. They just 
won’t taste as sweet unless you grow the baby types.
Growing onions
The simplest way to grow onions is from a set or plant. But you can also 
directly sow onion seeds in spring, 2 weeks before your last frost date, or 
start them indoors 8 weeks earlier. For a fall planting of onions, start seed-
lings indoors or buy transplants. Plant the onion plants 4 to 6 weeks before 
the first frost. If you’re starting your own seeds for a fall planting, start them 
indoors 8 weeks earlier.
 
If you start onions indoors, keep the plants stocky and short; whenever they 
get long and straggly, cut the tops with scissors so the plants are 3 inches tall. 
Trimming encourages better root growth and keeps the plants at a manage-
able size. Keep the seedlings moist and grow them under lights (Chapter 13 

83
 Chapter 6: Growing Underground Crops: Carrots, Onions, and Potatoes
has more on growing seedlings indoors). Then harden off the transplants — 
gradually introduce them to the outdoor growing environment by bringing 
them outside for longer amounts of time each day for up to 1 week; then plant 
them 4 to 6 inches apart.
 
What makes onions pungent or sweet? The sulfur, not the sugar. Sweet onions 
have less sulfur than pungent varieties, so they taste sweeter. Even though the 
sulfur can make the onion more pungent, it also makes those varieties great 
storage onions. To keep your sweet onions as sweet as they can be, don’t 
apply any sulfur fertilizers. Also keep the onion plants stress free by control-
ling weeds and making sure that the plants receive enough water and fertilizer 
(such as 5-5-5). If you do so, they will thrive and be sweet.
You can harvest onions anytime if you want scallions or small, baby onions, 
but for the largest bulbs, wait until about 80 percent of the tops have naturally 
started to fall over. Pull the bulbs out on a dry day if possible and then let them 
dry out in a warm, shady spot. For more on harvesting, see Chapter 19.
Producing potatoes
Potatoes are mostly grown from seed potatoes, which are either small pota-
toes or larger ones cut so that each piece has two eyes (those small indenta-
tions on a potato’s skin). Eyes are dormant buds from which roots and shoots 
grow. Plant pieces about 8 to 10 inches apart in rows.
 
Don’t try to plant potatoes that you purchase from a grocery store. These 
spuds have been treated with a chemical sprouting inhibitor, so they either 
won’t grow any plants or the plants will be weak and not productive. It’s best 
to purchase seed potatoes from a mail-order catalog, nursery, or garden center.
In this section, I describe essential techniques for growing potatoes.
Protecting your taters with the hilling technique
If you weed your root crop patch, mulch it with hay or straw, and water it well, 
crisp roots will be yours for the taking in no time. However, potatoes do require 
one more special technique, called hilling. Hilling is the technique of mounding 
up the soil with a hoe around the plants as they grow (see Figure 6-2). Hill at 
least twice during the growing season — about 1 week after the leaves emerge 
from the soil and again 2 to 3 weeks later. Hilling promotes the production 
of bigger potatoes and more of them, kills weeds, and keeps the sun off the 
tubers.
After your final hilling, lay a 3- to 4-inch-thick layer of hay or straw around 
your potatoes. Not only will this layer reduce the amount of weeding you 
do the rest of the summer, but it also will keep the soil cool and moist — 
perfect tuber-forming conditions! This layer also helps create larger tubers 

84
Part II: Vegging Out 
with fewer problems, such as hollow heart (when the center of the potato is 
hollow due to moisture stress).
 
Figure 6-2:
Hilling 
potatoes 
encourages 
more of 
them to 
form.
 
 
Any direct sun on potatoes causes chlorophyll to form, turning the potato 
skins green and giving them an off taste. Tubers actually are mildly poisonous 
after they’ve formed chlorophyll, but you’d have to eat a truckload to really 
get sick. Keep the potatoes hilled and mulched when in the ground, and store 
them in the dark after harvest to avoid this problem. If you have a small green 
patch on your potato, just cut if off; the rest of the tuber is fine to eat.
Applying a space-saving planting technique
 
Don’t have room in your garden but want to grow potatoes? Instead of planting 
in rows, try growing potatoes vertically in potato towers (see Figure 6-3). Here’s 
how:
 
1. Place a 3-foot-diameter heavy wire cage over cultivated soil.
 
2. Add a 2- to 3-inch layer of soil to the bottom of the cage, and line the 
sides of the cage with hay. Plant four seed potatoes in the bottom of 
the cage and cover them with soil.
 
3. As the potato plants grow, continue adding soil over them and adding 
hay around the inside of the cage until you reach the top of the tower. 
Keep the soil well watered.
 
4. In the fall, open the cage and watch your tubers roll out!
Digging up the fruits (er, vegetables) of your labor
Harvesting potatoes is like going on an archeological dig. After a potato plant 
dies, use a metal garden fork and dig up the area 1 foot away from the row so 
you don’t spear the tubers. You’ll be amazed at the number of tubers you 

85
 Chapter 6: Growing Underground Crops: Carrots, Onions, and Potatoes
find — on average, 10 to 20 per plant. Dry the potatoes for an hour or so in 
the shade, and then store them in a dark, airy, 60-degree area for curing (the 
process of letting the skin toughen so the vegetables store better). After 2 
weeks, move the potatoes to a shed or room that’s 40 to 50 degrees to store 
for up to 9 months (depending on the variety). Always eat any damaged 
tubers first, because they’ll be the first to rot in storage.
 
Figure 6-3: 
You can

potatoes 
in towers 
if you don’t 
have much 
room in your 
garden.
 
 
New potatoes are just young potatoes, and with their soft skin and texture, 
they make a great summer treat. If you can’t wait until the main harvest is 
ready, steal a few new potatoes the second time you hill. Just reach into the 
soil and feel for small, round tubers. Taking a few won’t kill the plant, and 
you’ll still get some larger spuds later on.
The sweetest of tubers: Planting sweet potatoes
Sweet potatoes (Ipomoea batatas) are a root crop with a reputation for being 
grown only in the South. However, if you choose the right varieties, you 
can grow sweet potatoes just about anywhere — even in cold climates like 
Minnesota. Sweet potatoes are easy to grow and store well indoors in winter. 
The orange- or yellow-fleshed tubers can be baked, mashed, or sliced and 
deep fried for a nutritious and delicious snack. Some short-season variet-
ies (90 days) to grow are ‘Beauregard’, ‘Centennial’, and ‘Georgia Jet’. Other 
varieties that mature 1 to 2 weeks later are ‘Bush Porto Rico’, Jewel’, and 
‘Vardaman’.
To grow sweet potatoes, you don’t plant seeds. Instead, you buy small plants 
called slips. Slips are available at local nurseries or garden centers in spring 
or through the mail. You can start your own at home, but it’s better to pur-
chase certified disease-free slips from commercial growers to avoid disease. 
Sweet potatoes love the heat, so wait until the soil temperature is at least 60 

86
Part II: Vegging Out 
degrees before planting. The vines of your sweet potatoes will create a dense, 
mat-like groundcover, making this an attractive and edible plant to grow.
To plant and grow your sweet tubers follow these steps:
 
1. Create raised beds at least 6 inches tall and amend the soil with compost.
 
2. Plant the slips up to their bottom leaves, 1 foot apart in the raised beds.
 
 In cold-winter areas, consider laying black plastic over the beds, punch-
ing holes, and planting the slips through the plastic so the soil will heat 
up faster and the tubers will grow and mature sooner.
 
3. Side-dress the plants once, a month after planting.
 
 When side-dressing, use an organic fertilizer, such as 5-5-5, or a mix of 
blood and bone meal fertilizer. And be sure to keep your plants well 
weeded and watered. Keep the soil on the slightly acidic pH side to 
avoid some diseases. (Check out Chapter 15 for details on side-dressing 
and fertilizing.)
 
4. Before the first frost, or about 100 days after planting, dig under the 
plants and check for roots.
 
 Pull plants that have formed good-sized roots and cure (dry) these in a 
warm (80-degree) room for 2 weeks. The curing process not only helps 
the skin toughen, but also converts starches to sugars, giving sweet 
potatoes their characteristic taste.
 
 After curing, eat the tubers or store them in a humid, 55-degree base-
ment (or in any other cool area of your house) all winter.
Keeping Your Root Crops 
Healthy and Pest-Free
Many of the same pests and diseases that you find on other vegetable crops — 
such as aphids, flea beetles, thrips, mosaic virus, and nematodes — also occur 
on root crops. Other potentially damaging root crop pests are animals — such 
as rabbits, mice, and chipmunks — that enjoy the underground snacks out of 
sight of predators. I lost most of my potato crop one year due to an overpopu-
lation of hungry chipmunks looking for food. (I discuss insect and animal pests 
as well as common diseases in more detail in Chapter 17.)
 
Check with your local Cooperative Extension Service office or the folks at your 
local nursery or garden store to find out what specific diseases and insects 
may be problems in your area. Then, as with any vegetable, you can plant 
varieties that are resistant to those diseases and insects.

87
 Chapter 6: Growing Underground Crops: Carrots, Onions, and Potatoes
 
Besides the usual suspects that attack vegetable gardens, a few pests and dis-
eases specifically harm root crops. Here are descriptions of them as well as 
the appropriate controls:
 
✓ Blight: This fungal disease can wreak havoc on potatoes. Late blight, in 
particular, is the infamous disease that destroyed potatoes in Ireland in 
the 1840s, causing the Irish potato famine. This disease thrives in cool, 
humid weather, and infection starts in the form of water-soaked black 
spots on the leaves.
 
 Unfortunately, once blight starts, you can’t treat it; the plants can die, 
and any tuber that they produce also may be infected and inedible. To 
avoid this disease, mulch, rotate crops, pull up any volunteer potatoes 
that sprout from old tubers in the ground, and plant certified disease-
free seed potatoes.
 
✓ Carrot rust fly: If your carrots’ roots have holes bored into them, they 
may be infected with carrot rust flies. The adult flies lay their eggs on 
the soil near carrot plants, and then when the young larvae hatch, they 
tunnel into the soil to feed on the carrot roots. If your carrots have these 
holes in them, you can eat the carrots as long as the disease hasn’t 
started rotting the root.
 
 To avoid this problem, rotate crops, grow resistant varieties, and cover 
the plants with a floating row cover (a cheesecloth-like material that lets 
air, water, and sun in, but keeps bugs out; see Chapter 21).
 
✓ Colorado potato beetle: The most destructive potato pests, these 
1⁄2-inch-long, tan- and brown-striped adult beetles lay yellow eggs in clus-
ters on the undersides of potato leaves, starting in early summer. After 
the eggs hatch, the dark-red larvae feed on the leaves and can quickly 
destroy your crop (see Figure 6-4).

Part II: Vegging Out 
 
 Control these insects by growing resistant varieties, crushing their eggs 
on sight, handpicking the young beetles, mulching with a thick layer 
of hay to slow their spread, and spraying the biological spray Bt ‘San 
Diego’, which is specifically designed to kill young potato beetles but 
doesn’t harm other insects, animals, or people, on the larvae. Potatoes 
can withstand significant potato beetle leaf damage and still produce. 
You just won’t receive as large of a crop.
 
✓ Onion maggot: This pest’s larvae attack the bulbs of developing onions, 
causing holes, opening the bulb to infection from disease, and making 
them inedible. Onion maggots like cool, wet weather. To control onion 
maggots, place a floating row cover over young seedlings after the 
weather warms to around 70 degrees. Doing so prevents the adult flies 
from laying eggs on the young plants.
 
✓ Potato scab: This fungal disease causes a potato’s skin to turn brown 
with a corky texture. Tubers with potato scab are unattractive but still 
edible. Control this cosmetic disease by planting resistant varieties and 
rotating your crops.
 
✓ Wireworm: These jointed, hard-shelled, tan-colored, 1-inch worms feed 
on underground tuber roots as well as the bulbs of a number of crops. 
They’re generally a problem with recently sodded soil. Control this pest 
by setting potato traps before your root crops begin maturing. Spear a 
potato piece on a stick and bury it 2- to 4-inches in the ground; the wire-
worms should infest the potato piece. Dig up the piece after 1 week and 
then destroy it.

Sweet and Simple: 
Beans and Peas
In This Chapter
▶ Growing bean and pea varieties of different heights, colors, and flavors
▶ Planting beans and peas in your garden
▶ Caring for your beans and peas
▶ Harvesting your crop
O
ne vegetable that you can always rely on is the bean. So for ensured 
success in your first garden, plant some bean seeds. When I teach gar-
dening to beginner groups, the first plants that I talk about are bean plants — 
and for good reason. Bean seeds are large and easy to plant, they grow easily, 
and they don’t require lots of extra fertilizer or care. Within 60 days, you’re 
bound to have some beans to eat. With beans, satisfaction is as guaranteed as 
it gets in the vegetable gardening world. In fact, they’re even more forgiving 
than tomatoes!
Peas are in the same legume family as beans; other crops in this family 
include clover and alfalfa, but you don’t eat them (unless you grow sprouts!). 
Like beans, peas also have large seeds and require little care. The only dif-
ference between the two is that peas like cool weather to grow and mature, 
whereas beans like it warm. If you get the timing right for beans and peas, 
you’ll have lots of legumes rolling through your kitchen door; just use the 
guidelines in this chapter to get started. (See the appendix for a general 
planting guide for selected beans and peas.)

Part II: Vegging Out 
A Bevy of Beans: Filling Your 
Rows with Bean Family Plants
All bush, pole, and dried beans are members of the Fabaceae family. In this 
section, I classify beans according to their growth habits and usage (that is, 
whether you eat them fresh or dried). Here are the categories:
 
✓ Bush beans: These beans get their name because they grow on a bush. 
They tend to produce the earliest crops, maturing all at once (within a week 
or so of each other); you have either feast or famine with these types.
 
✓ Pole beans: These beans need staking and usually grow on poles. They 
tend to mature their crops later than bush beans, but pole beans con-
tinue to produce all season until frost or disease stops them. (Luckily, 
home gardeners generally don’t have to worry about disease resistance 
with their bean plants.)
 
✓ Dried beans: These are actually varieties of bush or pole beans. You can 
eat them fresh, like bush or pole beans, but they’re better if you allow 
them to dry and then just eat the bean seeds. Growing dried beans is 
easy: Just plant them, care for them, and harvest them when the pods 
are dried and the plants are almost dead.
Bush and pole beans actually are the same type of bean, just with different 
growth habits. Bush and pole beans often are called snap beans because 
they snap when you break their pods in half. Another name for these beans 
is string beans, because early varieties had a stringy texture. (Modern variet-
ies don’t have this texture, so this name isn’t commonly used today.) Yellow 
snap varieties mature to a yellow color and are called wax beans. Don’t get 
lost in the snap versus string discussion. Those are just names people have 
given to a bean eaten before the seeds inside begin to form.
 
Beans harvested at different stages can be called different names. Consider 
the following:
 
✓ A bean harvested when it’s young, before seeds have formed, is called a 
snap bean. They come in green, yellow, or purple depending on the variety.
 
✓ If a bean matures further and you harvest it when it’s still young but the 
bean seeds are fully formed, it’s called a shell bean.
 
✓ If the pod dries on the plant and then you harvest it, it’s called a dried bean.
 
Some bean varieties can be harvested at all stages. However, most bean varieties 
are best harvested at one particular stage — snap, shell, or dried — depending 
on their breeding (see the later section “Keep on pickin’: Harvesting your crop” 
for details).

91
 Chapter 7: Sweet and Simple: Beans and Peas
Just for fun in this section — in addition to the bush, pole, and dried beans, 
I also list some other bean relatives that are tasty and have novel colors and 
shapes (they’re unique). The days to maturity for all these beans represents 
the time from when you plant the seeds in the ground to when you harvest 
them. Bean appétit!
Bushels of bush beans
Bush bean plants generally are less than 2 feet tall and produce handfuls of 
beans at their one main harvest of the season. Depending on the variety, the 
beans are green, yellow, or purple. Most pods (the part of the bean that you eat)
are 6 to 8 inches at maturity, but you can harvest beans that are flavorful 
sooner. If you need lots of beans all at once for canning or preserving, grow 
bush beans. Selecting among the various types is really just a matter of color 
and experimentation; try one and see if you like it. Here are a few of the most 
reliable varieties to grow:
 
✓ ‘Blue Lake 274’: This big, meaty, green bean variety matures high yields 
(about 12 pounds for every 10 feet of row) in 55 days — even under 
adverse weather conditions. It also comes in a pole bean version.
 
✓ ‘Derby’: This disease-resistant green bean is an All-America Selections 
winner (see Chapter 4) and features extra-tender pods and high yields 57 
days from seeding.
 
✓ ‘Improved Golden Wax’: This disease-resistant, yellow-bean variety 
produces broad, flat golden pods 52 days from seeding.
 
✓ ‘Jade’: This heat-tolerant green bean produces huge yields of pencil-
straight beans 60 days after seeding. It produces high-quality beans later 
into the season than other green bush beans, allowing you to extend 
your harvest time.
 
✓ ‘Kentucky Wonder’: This classic green bean’s round, green pods are pro-
duced prolifically on sturdy plants 57 days from seeding. It also comes in 
a pole bean variety.
 
✓ ‘Nash’: This heavy yielding, disease-resistant variety grows well in the 
heat, so it’s a good choice in hot-summer areas. Its green pods mature 54 
days from seeding.
 
✓ ‘Provider’: This variety has great disease resistance and can grow in 
adverse weather. Its green pods mature 50 days from seeding.
 
✓ ‘Roc d’Or Wax’: This variety produces long, slender, round, bright 
yellow pods on sturdy plants in 53 days.
 
✓ ‘Roma II’: This Romano-type bush bean has tender, flat pods and high 
yields earlier than Romano (53 days after seeding). The pods are slow to 
develop seeds and strings, so they stay tender longer.

92
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
✓ ‘Romano’: This long, flat green bean is an Italian classic and also comes in 
a pole variety. The pods are known for their strong flavor and ability to stay 
tender even when they’re large. This variety matures in 60 days. ‘Romano 
Gold’ and ‘Romano Purpiat’ are yellow and purple varieties, respectively, 
that grow similar to the original just with different-colored pods.
 
✓ ‘Royal Burgundy’: This attractive purple-podded bean also has a purple 
tinge on its leaves, stems, and flowers. It matures in 55 days and turns 
dark green when cooked.
Pole beans: The long and tall crop
Many pole bean varieties share the names and characteristics of their bush 
bean counterparts. Pole beans mature more beans overall but start a week or 
so later than bush beans and produce only a handful of beans per day, which 
makes them great for small families. Pole beans keep producing beans until 
frost, in all but the hottest summer areas. You also can plant them in summer 
for a fall crop in warm areas.
In the following list, I mention the pole beans that also have bush forms, plus 
some other well-producing and attractive pole varieties:
 
✓ ‘Blue Lake’: See the bush variety in the preceding section.
 
✓ ‘Emerite’: Think of this variety as a green filet bean (see the later section 
“Other beans”) on poles. The tender, pencil-thin, 4- to 5-inch-long pods 
are produced 64 days from seeding.
 
✓ ‘Fortex’: This variety produces extra-long (11-inch) pods that are string-
less, tender, nutty, and savory. A French favorite, this productive green 
bean matures 60 days from seeding.
 
✓ ‘Goldmarie’: This early yielding, wax pole bean variety produces 8-inch 
pods 54 days from seeding.
 
✓ ‘Kentucky Wonder’: See the bush bean variety in the preceding section 
for a description. ‘Kentucky Wonder’ also is available in a wax pole bean 
variety.
 
✓ ‘Purple Pod’: This unique purple-colored variety grows on a 6-foot-tall 
plant. When you cook the bean, its color changes from purple to dark 
green. It matures 65 days from seeding.
 
✓ ‘Romano’: See the bush bean variety in the preceding section.
 
✓ ‘Scarlet Runner’: This beautiful, vigorous pole bean is actually in a dif-
ferent species than other pole beans (Phaseolus coccineus). It produces 
attractive scarlet red flowers, large hairy pods, and bean seeds that are 
edible 70 days from seeding. The pods can be eaten when young and the 

93
 Chapter 7: Sweet and Simple: Beans and Peas
bean seeds are edible when dried. This variety tastes okay, but it usually 
is grown as an ornamental for its attractive flowers and colorful red and 
black bean seeds.
The versatile shell and dried beans
Shell and dried beans are some of the most versatile beans to grow because 
you can eat them at the snap, shell, or dried stages. Eaten at the shell stage 
(fully matured seeds in the pod, but the pod is still green) or dried stage, 
you’re eating the seed inside the pod. These seeds come in colors from white 
to red and can even be striped and spotted. Dried beans are great baked and 
in soups and chowders.
Most of the varieties in the following list are grown for their dried beans but 
also taste good at their shelling stage, too. They’re the dried beans that most 
people are familiar with eating, and they’re the tastiest to grow. The days 
to maturity represent the time from seeding to dried bean harvest. Most of 
these varieties are bushy plants:
 
✓ ‘Black Turtle’: This small black bean matures 85 days from seeding and 
grows best in warmer climates. Each pod produces seven to eight beans, 
which are often baked as well as used in soups and casseroles.
 
✓ ‘Blue Speckled Tepary’: This Southwest variety grows great in hot, dry 
conditions. The brown seeds with red speckles mature 90 days from 
seeding.
 
✓ ‘Cannellini’: This famous white, kidney-shaped bean is often used in 
minestrone soups. Large plants produce beans that are best when eaten 
at the shelling stage, which is 80 days from seeding.
 
✓ ‘French Horticultural’: An old-time favorite, this tan-colored bean 
matures in 90 days. You also can eat this variety earlier as a shelling bean.
 
✓ ‘Jacob’s Cattle’: This bean gets its name from the cattle that Jacob, the 
biblical character, tended. It’s white with splashes of maroon. This bean 
is best adapted to cooler weather. You’ll find ‘Jacob’s Cattle’ great in 
baked bean dishes.
 
✓ ‘Navy’: This small, semi-vining plant produces white, oval beans 85 days 
from seeding. These beans are excellent baked.
 
✓ ‘Pinto’: A vining plant produces buff-colored, brown-speckled, dried 
beans 90 days from seeding; these beans are widely used in Mexican 
dishes. You also can grow this variety as a pole bean.
 
✓ ‘Red Kidney’: This bushy plant produces large, red, kidney-shaped 
beans 100 days from seeding. These beans are used in many baked 
dishes. ‘Red Kidney’ also comes as a white-seeded variety.

94
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
✓ ‘Soldier’: This white, kidney-shaped bean with red markings produces 6 
beans per pod 85 days from seeding. This bean is great baked and in 
stews.
 
✓ ‘Tongue of Fire’: These 6- to 7-inch, red-streaked pods can be eaten 
shelled or dried. They mature to the shell stage 70 days from seeding.
 
✓ ‘Vermont Cranberry’: This red, brown-speckled, New England classic 
dried bean is one of the most popular beans to grow. It matures 90 days 
from seeding and is widely adapted (can grow in a variety of geographic 
regions under a variety of weather conditions).
Miscellaneous beans not to be forgotten
Some variations on the common bean are exotic and fun to grow. The beans 
in this section are grown similarly to bush or pole beans but come in different 
shapes and flavors. Some of these beans aren’t even in the same species as 
bush and pole beans, but they’re grown the same way. The following sections 
show you a few of the best ones to try.
Asparagus bean
The asparagus bean (Vigna unguiculata sesquipedalis, or Yard-Long bean) is 
a pole bean that grows more than 10 feet tall and produces extremely long 
beans (up to 3 feet tall!). This variety is popular in Europe and Asia and is 
catching on in the United States. The asparagus bean takes a longer growing 
season to mature than traditional pole bean varieties, however. Most mature 
within 80 days from seeding. Some good varieties to look for include ‘Chinese 
Green Noodle’ and ‘Red Noodle’. ‘Chinese Green Noodle’ features long, thin 
green beans. The ‘Red Noodle’ variety features burgundy-colored pods that 
hold and deepen their color to purple when cooked.
Edamame
Edamame (Glycine max), or Green Vegetable soybean, started as a novelty 
bean from Japan and has turned into a favorite in many home gardens and 
kitchens. Unlike the commercial soybean that’s grown for animal feed, oil, 
and so on, this soybean is meant to be eaten at the green shell stage; it has a 
buttery, lima-bean flavor. Some varieties have green seeds and others black.
‘Envy’ is the earliest maturing of the edamame varieties (75 days from seed-
ing). ‘Black Pearl’ is smaller than other soybean seeds and has a rich and 
distinctive flavor. Maturing in 85 days, it grows up to 3 feet tall and wide, 
so it needs more room than other varieties. ‘Butterbean’, which matures 
in 90 days, is a high-yielding soybean with a sweet and buttery flavor and 
well-branched plants. ‘Sayamusume’, which is a Pacific Northwest favorite, 
produces high yields of large soybeans with 3 to 4 soybeans per pod. This 
variety matures in 85 days.

95
 Chapter 7: Sweet and Simple: Beans and Peas
 
Edamame beans are a kid-sized treat. Children of all ages love to pop these 
buttery-flavored beans in their mouths after they’re steamed.
Fava bean
The fava bean (Vigna acontifolia, or English Broad bean or Horse bean) is a 
popular English bean that grows on plants that are 2 to 3 feet tall; unlike other 
beans, the fava bean likes cold weather. You can harvest the 7-inch pods as snap 
or shell beans; they mature 85 days from seeding. Fava beans are a good 
alternative to lima beans in cold climates. ‘Windsor’ is a good variety that 
produces 3 to 5 green seeds per pod 75 days after seeding.
French filet
The French filet bean (Haricot Vert) is a classic bean from France that has 
really caught on in the United States. This bean has been bred to be tender 
and stringless. Compact bush plants produce an abundance of these thin, 
textured, “melt-in-your-mouth” beans when harvested young. Pick them when 
they’re less than 1/4-inch-thick, or they’ll have started to mature, leaving the 
pods tough and stringy.
 
You can choose from a number of varieties of French filet beans. Some of the 
best include the following: ‘Maxibel’ (high yields of 7-inch-long, round beans); 
‘Nickel’ (heat and cold tolerant plants produce 4-inch-long beans); ‘Tavera’ 
(very slender, 4- to 5-inch-long beans); and ‘Soleil’ (a unique 4-inch-long, yellow-
podded variety). All filet beans mature between 50 and 60 days from seeding.
Lima bean
Once you’ve eaten a fresh lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus, or Butter bean), 
you’ll never settle for the canned version again. Lima beans come in bush and 
pole varieties and love a long, warm growing season. Fat pods, which are 4 to 
8 inches long, produce 4 to 6 beans each that you harvest at the shell stage.
One of the best bush varieties is ‘Fordhook 242’, which matures in 75 days. 
It produces 3 to 5 white seeds per pod and is tolerant of both heat and cold. 
Another is ‘Jackson Wonder’. This “baby” lima produces 3 to 4 beans per pod 
and matures in 75 days, which makes it good for cooler climates. A good pole 
variety is ‘King of the Garden’, which matures 88 days from seeding. It yields 
4 to 6 large, cream-colored seeds per pod. ‘Florida Speckled Butter’, another 
pole bean, matures in 85 days. Each pod produces 3 to 5 light-brown seeds 
speckled with maroon. The plant is heat- and drought-tolerant, making it a 
good Southern variety.
Southern pea
Although it’s called a pea, the southern pea (Vigna unguiculata, or Cowpea) 
actually is more like a bean in growth and usage. Like limas, southern peas 
grow best in warm climates. The plants are either bush or semi-vining, and 
you harvest the pods about 60 days from seeding at the shell or dried stage. 

96
Part II: Vegging Out 
Some of the more famous types are Black-Eyed peas such as ‘Pink-Eyed Purple 
Hull’, which is named for the black speck on the seed; Crowders such as 
‘Mississippi Silver’, named for the way the seeds grow jammed in the pod; and 
Cream peas such as ‘Lady’, named for their smooth pod.
More Peas, Please!
One vegetable that’s truly a treat to grow yourself is the pea, which is Pisum 
sativum botanically. In grocery stores, peas are available for only a short 
time, and their flavor isn’t as sweet and tender as freshly picked pea pods. 
Some varieties grow to be huge and bushy, needing extra support to stand 
tall. Others are short and bushy and don’t require fencing or support. Viny 
pea plants produce a grabbing shoot called a tendril that holds onto whatever 
it comes in contact with. Some novel types don’t even bother growing leaves. 
In the following sections, I divide peas into three groups: English, snap, and 
snow. Mind your peas and take a look at some excellent varieties.
 
A pea is described by the type of pods it has. Here are the categories:
 
✓ An English, or garden, pea has a tough pod with tender peas inside.
 
✓ A snap pea has tender peas inside but also an edible, sweet pod.
 
✓ A snow pea is harvested flat (that is, harvested before the pea seeds 
inside the pod form) mainly for its tender pea pod.
English peas: The reliable standby
Sometimes called the garden pea, the English pea is the pea that gardeners 
are most familiar with and that’s most widely grown. In the following list, the 
days to maturity represent the time from seeding to harvest. Here are some 
of the most reliable varieties of English peas:
 
✓ ‘Alderman’ (Tall Telephone): This old heirloom matures in about 74 
days. Six-foot-tall vines produce a large number of 4- to 5-inch pods with 
6 to 8 peas per pod.
 
✓ ‘Blondie’: This new variety features 3-inch-long pods with 8 peas per pod. 
The yellow leaves and pale green pods and peas make this an eye-catching 
variety in the garden. It matures in 65 days and needs trellising (which I 
discuss in the later section “Spacing properly and providing support”).
 
✓ ‘Feisty’: This 30-inch-tall vine has few leaves and many tendrils, which 
makes the medium-sized pea pods with 6 to 8 peas per pod easier to 
harvest. The plant matures in 61 days.

97
 Chapter 7: Sweet and Simple: Beans and Peas
 
✓ ‘Little Marvel’: Even though it’s a dwarf plant that grows only 18 to 20 
inches tall, this pea plant produces heavy yields of 3-inch pods with 6 to 
8 peas per pod. The plant matures in 62 days.
 
✓ ‘Maestro’: A prolific early variety matures in 60 days and reaches only 2 
feet tall but produces 4- to 5-inch pods with 9 to 11 peas per pod on pow-
dery mildew–resistant plants.
 
✓ ‘Mr. Big’: This All-America-Selections-winning (see Chapter 4), disease-
resistant variety is a big producer that matures in 67 days. The 5- to 6-foot-
tall vines produce 4- to 5-inch-long pods with up to 10 peas per pod.
 
✓ ‘Petit Pois’: This novel baby pea (the pea seed inside the pod is smaller 
than the normal pea seed) is extra sweet and tender. It produces 6 to 7 
peas per pod. The plants are 20 inches tall and produce peas in 58 days.
 
✓ ‘Wando’: This very productive, warm weather variety grows 3 feet tall 
and produces 7 to 8 peas per pod in 68 days.
Sweet and tender snap peas
Snap peas were once the new peas on the block. Now they have become a main-
stay in many gardens. Snap pea pods fill out (the pea seed inside the pod forms) 
like an English pea, but they have a sweet, tender pod like a snow pea. Some 
newer varieties are considered stringless. The plants range from the original 
‘Super Snap’ that grows to 8 feet tall to the diminutive ‘Sugar Bon’ that grows 
to less than 2 feet tall. Kids love snap peas, and they’re as easy to grow as 
English peas.
Try these varieties of sweet and flavorful snap peas:
 
✓ ‘Cascadia’: These 2-foot-tall vines resist the pea enation virus disease 
(a problem in the Pacific Northwest; see the later section “Pesky pea 
problems”) and produce 3-inch, dark green peas 58 days after planting.
 
✓ ‘Sugar Ann’: The earliest maturing snap pea, this variety is ready for 
harvest in 52 days. The plants grow only 2 feet tall, producing sweet, 2- to 
3-inch pods. Because this snap pea is a dwarf variety, it doesn’t need sup-
port and can be grown in containers. ‘Sugar Sprint’ is similar to ‘Sugar 
Ann’ but doesn’t produce stringy pods.
 
✓ ‘Sugar Bon’: A 1- to 2-foot-tall snap pea, this plant matures in 56 days 
and resists powdery mildew disease. Because of its size, this variety is 
super for containers.
 
✓ ‘Sugar Lace II’: These 30-inch-tall vines have few leaves and many tendrils, 
making the 3-inch-long pods easy to see. The plant is self-supporting and 
disease resistant. It matures in 68 days.

98
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
✓ ‘Super Sugar Snap’: These vines grow to 6 feet tall, producing tons of 
sweet, long pods and peas 65 days after planting. This variety is shorter 
and more disease resistant than the original ‘Sugar Snap’, which is still 
available.
An earlier harvest: Snow peas
If you’ve eaten a vegetable dish in a Chinese restaurant, you’ve probably tried 
these sweet-tasting, flat-podded peas. Snow peas are the easiest peas to grow 
because you don’t have to wait for the pea pods to fill out to harvest them. 
They’re tender, stringless, and best when harvested before the peas inside 
begin to swell. Here are some of the best producing varieties to try:
 
✓ ‘Dwarf Gray Sugar’: This viny, 2- to 3-foot-tall plant needs support but 
produces 3-inch, dark green pods 57 days after planting. The pink flowers 
this plant produces are ornamental, so you’ll enjoy how they dress up 
your garden.
 
✓ ‘Golden Sweet’: This Indian heirloom features unique golden-colored pods 
on 6-foot-tall green vines that mature in 65 days. The pods stay golden when 
cooked, making them beautiful additions to stir-fry and salads.
 
✓ ‘Mammoth Melting Sugar’: This 4- to 5-foot-tall heirloom features 5-inch-
long pods that stay sweet longer than other varieties. It matures in 68 
days after planting.
 
✓ ‘Oregon Giant’: These large 4- to 5-inch sweet pods grow on disease-
resistant, 3-foot-tall vines 60 days after planting.
 
✓ ‘Oregon Sugar Pod II’: Another large-podded, sweet-tasting snow pea, this 
variety grows to 4 feet tall and matures its pods 68 days after planting. Like 
‘Oregon Giant’, it’s also disease resistant.
Get ’Em in the Ground: Growing 
Beans and Peas
Peas and beans are like siblings: They have a lot in common but also have 
some different preferences. For instance, both peas and beans like moderate 
moisture throughout the growing season and well-drained soil that isn’t heavily 
amended (nutrient-improved) with fertilizer. And neither is very demanding at 
all. The fundamental difference between pea and beans, however, is that peas 
like cool climates and beans prefer warm ones. If you get the timing right — by 
planting peas so they mature when it’s cool and beans when it’s hot — these 
two siblings will reward you with a bounty of legumes.

Planting legumes for an ample harvest
 
When planting legumes, choose a sunny spot with well-drained soil and create 
a raised bed (see Chapter 3). Raised beds help keep pea seeds from getting 
soggy while they germinate in cool spring soil; at the same time, raised beds 
also warm up the soil for bean seeds, which you plant in late spring and 
summer. In the following sections, I explain how to prepare the soil for your 
legumes, figure out when to plant, and discover how to give them the proper 
support.
Preparing the soil
Plants need nitrogen to grow, and most of the time they get it from the soil. 
Legumes are unique, however, in that they can use the nitrogen in the air 
through a special relationship with a type of bacteria called a rhizobium. This 
bacteria naturally occurs in soil and attaches itself to legume roots, living off the 
plants. In exchange, the bacteria takes the atmospheric nitrogen and changes 
it into a form that the plants can use. Beans and peas get the nitrogen they 
need, and the bacteria gets a home. So don’t worry about adding more nitro-
gen fertilizer to legumes; they can take care of themselves. If you see bumps 
or nodules on the roots of your plants, you know that bacteria is at work.
 
Books and catalogs often suggest that you buy your own bacteria inoculant 
powder to add to bean and pea seeds when planting. This powder really isn’t 
necessary. Soil already has bacteria in it, so usually you don’t need to add any 
extra to your seeds. The exception, however, is with very sandy or poor soil. 
These types of soil need a one-time inoculation (the mixing of powder with seeds 
at planting), which peppers the soil with bacteria and gives plants the boost they 
need. After the rhizobium is in the soil, you don’t need to add it yearly.
Even though legumes don’t need extra nitrogen, they benefit from a 2- to 
3-inch layer of composted manure worked into the soil before planting. For 
poor soils with low fertility, add an organic fertilizer high in phosphorous and 
potassium, such as 5-5-5 (see Chapter 15).
Determining when to plant
With beans, wait until the soil is at least 60 degrees Fahrenheit before plant-
ing. Beans planted in cool soil rot before germinating. Stagger your bush 
bean planting dates by planting small batches of seeds every week or so (see 
Chapter 16 for more on succession planting). By staggering the plantings, 
you’ll have a continual harvest all summer.
Peas like cool soil; in fact, they can germinate in 40-degree soil. As soon as 
the soil dries out, build your raised beds and plant your seeds. You can deter-
mine whether your soil is dried out by squeezing a handful of it; if no water 
trickles out and the soil clump feels moist and breaks up easily when poked 
with your finger, the soil is dried out.

100
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
You can plant peas 3 to 4 weeks before the last frost date in your area if the 
soil is ready. Pea seeds germinate better in 60- to 70-degree soil, but if you wait 
until the soil is warmer, the plants will get off to a late start. By the time the 
peas would begin flowering, the air temperature would be too warm (above 80 
degrees), and your plants and production would suffer.
You also can grow peas as a fall crop, which you start in summer so the 
plants mature in the cool days of autumn. I’ve had success planting snow 
peas as a fall crop. You can harvest these legumes sooner than English and 
snap peas because you can eat the flat pea pods as soon as they form and 
before the freezing weather hits.
 
To help pea seeds germinate in cold or hot soils, try pregerminating the seeds 
(see Figure 7-1). Place the pea seeds in a moist paper towel in a dark, warm 
spot for a few days. Check the seeds daily; when you see a small root begin to 
grow, plant the peas in the ground. Pregerminating helps the peas get off to a 
faster start and reduces the chance that they’ll rot in cool soil.

Spacing properly and providing support
How close you plant your legumes depends on the varieties you’ve chosen. 
The following guidelines can help:
 
✓ Bush beans grow best in rows on top of a raised bed. In rows 1 to 2 feet 
apart, plant the individual seeds within 1 to 2 inches of each other. Then 
thin the beans to 4 to 6 inches apart after they germinate and emerge from 
the soil. (Chapter 13 provides pointers on how to thin your vegetable 
seedlings.)
 
✓ Because you plant peas when the soil is cooler, the germination 
percentage may be less than with beans. So, on your raised bed, plant 
your peas less than 1 inch apart in rows 6 inches apart.

101
 Chapter 7: Sweet and Simple: Beans and Peas
 
Tall vining varieties of beans, such as pole beans, and tall varieties of peas 
need support to grow their best. The type of support needed depends on the 
plant (see Figure 7-2). Pole bean shoots spiral and wrap themselves around 
objects that they can climb, and peas attach themselves to objects with ten-
drils (grabbing shoots that hold onto whatever they come in contact with). 
Generally, beans like to climb poles, and peas like to climb fences. The height 
of your fence or pole depends on the varieties that you’re growing: A 4- to 5-foot 
fence is good for most peas, and a 6- to 8-foot pole is good for pole beans.
 
Keep your fences and poles within reach because if the plants grow too tall, 
you’ll need to use a ladder to harvest. For more information on trellises, 
fences, and teepees, see Chapter 15.
Plant both pea and bean seeds 1 to 2 inches deep. Plant pole beans around 
individual poles; you should have 4 to 6 pole beans around each pole, about 
6 inches away from the pole (see Figure 7-3). In between the pea rows, place 
your trellis or chicken wire so the peas can climb both sides of a fence (or 
whatever you have for them to climb on).

Figure 7-3:

After they start to grow, beans and peas need little attention other than regu-
lar watering and weeding. Both benefit from a layer of hay or straw mulch 
placed around the rows. The hay or straw mulch reduces the need for weed-
ing and keeps the soil moist. (See Chapter 15 for more on mulch and other 
maintenance.)
 
Be careful when weeding around peas because they have shallow root systems. 
Instead of digging in the soil around the roots, pull any weeds by hand or bury 
young weeds with soil as they germinate.
Thwarting pests and diseases
One nice thing about beans and peas is that they’re susceptible to only a 
few serious pests or diseases. However, some of the common problems that 
plague other vegetables, such as damping off, fusarium wilt, powdery mildew, 
and leaf blight, also can be problematic for peas and beans (see Chapter 17). 
You can avoid many of these problems in vegetables by rotating crops, tilling 
in the fall, and growing resistant varieties; see Chapter 16 for details. The fol-
lowing sections describe some problems specific to beans and peas.
Battles for beans
 
Here are the most troublesome of the bean problems along with some advice 
on how to solve (and prevent!) them:
 
✓ Bald heading: If your bean seedlings emerge from the soil without leaves, 
they may have a condition called bald heading. Insects can cause this 
condition and so can seed that has been damaged. It can occur when you 
plant the seeds too deep in the ground or in gravel soil, which causes the 
leaves to rip off as they try to break through the soil. To prevent this 

103
 Chapter 7: Sweet and Simple: Beans and Peas
condition, prepare the seed bed by removing rocks, sticks, and clods of 
soil before planting; and don’t plant too deep. Leafless beans don’t produce 
any crops, so if you see any leafless beans, pull them out and replant.
 
✓ Mexican bean beetle: This ladybug relative has an orange-yellow shell 
with 16 black spots on it. The adult beetles lay masses of orange eggs 
on the undersides of maturing bean plants. When the eggs hatch, the 1/3-
inch, spiny yellow young that emerge feed on the bean leaves, defoliating 
the plant. To control these pests, do the following:
 
• Plant early maturing varieties that are finished producing before 
the bean beetles become plentiful.
 
• Crush any egg masses that you see.
 
• Clean up old bean plant debris where the plants overwinter (live 
throughout the winter).
 
• Spray the adult beetles with pyrethrin (a botanical insecticide made 
from pyrethrum flowers).
 
✓ Rust: If your plants have red or orange spots on their leaves and then 
they yellow and die, you may have rust disease. This fungal disease 
overwinters on bean plant debris left in the garden and infects new 
plants in summer when the weather is right (warm temperatures and 
high humidity). To prevent rust disease, clean up plant debris and till 
your garden in fall. The next growing season, rotate bean plantings to 
another section of the garden. Also, don’t work in your garden when the 
leaves are wet; wet leaves provide the moisture that rust disease spores 
need to be able to spread.
Pesky pea problems
 
Peas don’t have many disease or pest problems, but here are a few to watch 
out for:
 
✓ Pea aphid: These pear-shaped, 1/8-inch, green insects suck the juices 
from pea leaves and stems and can stunt a plant’s growth and cause it 
to wilt. If your plants are severely affected by these insects, spray the 
plants with Safer’s insecticidal soap.
 
✓ Pea enation virus: Pea enation virus is a particular problem for peas 
grown in the Pacific Northwest. The virus, which is spread by aphids 
(another reason to control the pest), causes plants’ leaves and pods to 
be stunted and deformed. The best solution is to grow disease-resistant 
varieties such as ‘Cascadia’.
Keep on pickin’: Harvesting your crop
As you probably know, when it comes to harvesting vegetables, timing is 
everything. Keep a close eye on your beans and peas as they start to mature 

104
Part II: Vegging Out 
and pick often. Beans and peas can get overmature, tough, and stringy 
quickly, especially in warm weather. Here’s how to tell when the beans you’ve 
planted are ready for harvest:
 
✓ You can harvest snap beans when the pods are firm and crisp and the 
seeds inside are undeveloped. (If the pod is smooth and not bumpy, 
you know that the seeds haven’t developed yet.) Carefully hold the bean 
stem with one hand and pull the individual beans off with your other 
hand to avoid breaking the plants.
 
 The more beans you pick, the more you’ll get. That’s because the plant 
wants to produce mature seeds and you keep frustrating it by picking 
the pods. So be sure to harvest even if you’re not going to eat all the 
beans immediately. Remember, you can always share your crop with 
hungry friends and family.
 
✓ Harvest shell beans when the pods are full, green, and firm but 
haven’t dried out yet. You can store the beans in a refrigerator for a few 
days before cooking them.
 
✓ Let dried bean pods dry on the plant until they naturally begin to split 
and then harvest them. Break the bean seeds out of the pods by rubbing 
the pods in your hands, which shatters them. Store the beans in glass jars 
in a cool place; you can either eat them or save them to plant next year.
Peas lose quality quickly, so picking them when they’re undermature rather 
than overmature is better. Also, try to cook them the same day; they turn 
starchy quickly if you keep them for more than 1 or 2 days. Here are some 
guidelines for harvesting peas:
 
✓ You harvest English and snap peas when the pods are full and before 
they fade in color. Upon harvesting snap peas, cut off the cap (stem 
end) of the pod and take the string (along the seam) out of the pod; 
these are the only two parts of the pod that are chewy.
 
✓ You can pick snow peas anytime before the pea seeds inside the pods 
begin to form. After the peas begin to fill out, the pods get tough and 
stringy.
 
✓ You can harvest the tender shoots and tendrils of peas. Harvest from 
the end of the shoots back 2- to 3-inches including the leaves and tendrils. 
The shoots and tendrils are great sautéed or mixed raw in salads. It’s a 
way to get the pea flavor without the peas and to use more parts of the 
pea plant.

In This Chapter
▶ Choosing the best vining varieties for your garden
▶ Understanding how to grow and maintain your viners
I
f the heat is on, it’s time to grow your vining veggies. This group of veg-
etables is part of the cucumber family (Cucurbitaceae), and it includes 
cucumbers, melons, squash, and pumpkins. Gourds also are in this family, 
but I discuss them in Chapter 11.
What all these vegetables have in common is their love of heat, their ability 
to grow long stems (and vine to great lengths), and the fact that they have 
separate male and female flowers on the same plant. Unlike the other veg-
etables that I mention in this book (which have both male and female parts 
in the same flower), the viners need someone to play Cupid and bring pollen 
from the male flower to the female flower in order to produce fruit. This 
process is called pollination, and usually bees play the role of the chubby 
cherub. Of course, there are exceptions to the Cupid rule, and I discuss them 
in the sections about the individual vegetables in this chapter.
This large family of vegetables is known for producing lots of fruits and taking up 
lots of room in the process. However, modern plant breeders have responded to 
the need for smaller, space-saving vegetable plants by breeding bush (nonvining) 
varieties of some favorite cucumber-family crops. So now you have one more 
reason to grow some cucumbers and squash. Actually, if you’ve ever tasted a 
vine-ripened melon or cucumber or baked a homegrown winter squash, you’re 
probably hooked. Their flavor and texture are much better than anything you 
can buy in stores, and if you grow too many vegetables, you can always give 
them away to hungry neighbors.

106
Part II: Vegging Out 
Checking Out Cool Cukes
Cucumber varieties usually are categorized two ways: as slicers and picklers. 
Slicing-cucumber varieties are long, smooth-skinned cucumbers that tend to 
be larger, a darker shade of green, and have thicker skin with fewer bumps 
(spines) than pickling varieties, which are short and prickly. Slicing cucum-
bers are the ones you’re probably most familiar with from grocery stores; 
they’re great in salads and other recipes, but they’re also super for munch-
ing. Of course, you can use pickling varieties the same ways you use slicing 
varieties, and they’re great when eaten fresh, but if you want to make pickles, 
the pickling varieties have better textures for it.
 
The easiest cucumber varieties to grow are the hybrid bush types. These 
varieties, such as ‘Salad Bush’, are good producers, are disease resistant, and 
produce a small vining plant that can grow in a container. Bush types don’t 
produce as many cucumbers as larger vining varieties, nor do they produce 
them all summer long. But if you have a small family, a few bush varieties 
should be plenty.
 
To round out the cucumber field in this section, I describe some unusual heir-
loom (old-fashioned) varieties and some modern, seedless cucumber varieties 
that produce fruit without pollination. If you plant one of the seedless varieties 
(these varieties actually have seeds, but the seeds aren’t developed), avoid 
planting any other cucumber varieties in your garden. If a seedless variety 
gets pollinated by bees, edible but seedy fruits will result. For that reason, 
gardeners often grow these varieties in greenhouses, which protect the plants 
from bees. (See the section “Ensuring proper pollination,” later in this chapter, 
for more information.)
Before you choose: Brushing up on 
some cucumber vocabulary
When you’re reading about cucumber varieties, you may notice some words — 
such as gherkin and gynoecious (guy-NEE-shous) — that would challenge even 
the best Scrabble player. Fortunately, you don’t need to memorize these terms 
to grow good cucumbers. However, they do enable you to figure out the type of 
cucumber that you’re buying — and impress your friends! Here are some terms 
to be familiar with:
 
✓ Burpless: This thin-skinned cucumber type has a long, slender shape 
and a mild flavor that isn’t bitter. It’s said to produce less intestinal gas 
than other varieties, which clearly explains where it got its name.

107
 Chapter 8: Vigorous Vines: Cucumbers, Melons, Pumpkins, and Squash
 
✓ Gherkin: Actually, this type is a whole different species of cucumber 
(Cucumis anguria). It’s used commercially as a pickling cucumber. 
Gherkins have small, oval shapes and prickly skin. As far as the home 
gardener is concerned, this species difference has no effect.
 
✓ Gynoecious: This type of cucumber has only female flowers and 
requires the presence of a male pollinating cucumber variety to produce 
fruit. Usually, seed companies include seeds of a pollinating variety in 
packets of gynoecious cucumbers; the seeds are marked with a bright-
colored coating.
 
✓ Monoecious: This cucumber type has both male and female flowers on 
the same plant. Most cucumber varieties are of this type.
 
✓ Oriental cucumbers: This type of cucumber tends to be a thin, long-
fruited variety with ribbing on its skin.
 
✓ Parthenocarpic: This cucumber type is seedless, producing fruit without 
pollination. Varieties of this type produce only female flowers and need 
to be separated from other cucumber varieties. Otherwise, if they’re pol-
linated, they may produce misshapen fruits and form fruits with seeds. 
(You can still eat them; they’ll just look funny.) This cucumber type is 
often grown in greenhouses.
Surveying common cucumber varieties
After you know a bit of the language, take a look at some of my favorite 
cucumber varieties. Most of these varieties vine 4 to 5 feet unless I note oth-
erwise. Regular production of cucumbers is about 12 pounds per 10-foot row 
(about 10 cukes per plant). Choose varieties based on disease resistance, 
size, productivity, and adaptability. The days to maturity are from seeding in 
the ground until first harvest. Consider these varieties:
 
✓ ‘Armenian’: This unique heirloom, which also is known as the snake 
cucumber or yard-long cucumber, actually is part of the melon family (C. 
melo). ‘Armenian’ produces 5-foot-long vines and burpless, nonbitter, 12- 
to 15- inch-long ribbed slicing fruits in 60 days. It sets fruits even in high 
temperatures when cucumbers normally won’t set fruit, making it a good 
choice for hot summer climates.
 
✓ ‘Bush Pickle’: This hybrid bush pickling variety produces 4-inch pickles 
all at once on 2- to 3-foot-diameter plants that mature in 45 days.
 
✓ ‘County Fair’: This hybrid pickling variety produces 3-inch-long cukes 
on 2- to 3-foot-long vines. It’s best known for its disease resistance, espe-
cially to bacterial wilt (see “Controlling pests and diseases” later in this 
chapter). Choose this variety if cucumber beetles (which spread the 
disease) are a problem in your area. It matures in 50 days.

108
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
✓ ‘Diva’: This All-America Selections (AAS; see Chapter 4) winner is a 
hybrid bush slicing cucumber that has it all. It’s parthenocarpic, nonbit-
ter, mildew and scab resistant, and has a thin, no-peel skin. It produces 
5-inch-long cukes in 58 days.
 
✓ ‘Fanfare’: This AAS winner is a hybrid slicing cucumber that grows on a 
semi-bush plant (bigger than a bush variety, but not as rambling as other 
slicers). It vines to 4 feet, has lots of disease resistance, and produces 
8-inch fruits in 63 days.
 
✓ ‘Homemade Pickles’: This disease-resistant monoecious, open-pollinated 
pickler produces 5-foot-long vines and heavy yields of 6-inch-long fruits 
throughout the season. This variety matures in 55 days.
 
✓ ‘Lemon’: This unique monoecious, heirloom variety produces yellow, 
lemon-shaped fruits that are crisp and mild flavored. This slicer matures 
in 64 days.
 
✓ ‘Little Leaf’: This unique parthenocarpic, open-pollinated pickling 
variety has compact, multibranched vines that yield well even when 
stressed. The leaves are half the normal cucumber leaf size, making 
it easier to find and harvest the 3- to 4-inch-long fruits. This pickler 
matures 55 days from seeding.
 
✓ ‘Salad Bush’: This AAS winner is a hybrid, bush slicing variety that needs 
only 2 square feet to produce its 8-inch fruits. It matures in 57 days.
 
✓ ‘Suyo Long’: This unusual Oriental-type slicing cucumber is burpless, 
mostly seedless, and produces 15-inch fruits. It matures in 61 days.
 
✓ ‘Sweet Success’: This AAS winner is a seedless, parthenocarpic slicing 
variety with slender, 14-inch-long fruits that have tender skin and good 
disease resistance. It matures in 54 days.
 
✓ ‘Tasty Jade’: This is a vigorous-growing hybrid bush Oriental cucumber 
that produces thin-skinned, 11-inch-long ribbed, parthenocarpic fruits. 
This good greenhouse variety matures in 54 days.
Melons: The Sweet, Juicy Vining Plant
Compared to cucumbers with their various sexual combinations and vine 
lengths, melons are, well, easy. They all have separate male and female flow-
ers on each plant (which categorizes them as monoecious), and they all need 
about 6 to 8 feet of space to vine. Many different types of melons with many 
unique flavors are available. A number of melons can be harvested on the 
unripe side and left to mature off the vine while still producing their sweet 
flavor. (See the later section “Harvesting your vining crop” for more on har-
vesting melons.) In the following sections, I describe several kinds of melons 
and share some of my favorite melon varieties.

109
 Chapter 8: Vigorous Vines: Cucumbers, Melons, Pumpkins, and Squash
Distinguishing different types of melons
Most gardeners are familiar with the two most popular types of melons: 
muskmelons (also known as cantaloupes) and watermelons. But more and 
more exotic melon types continue to show up in produce markets and seed 
catalogs. These exotic types include crenshaw, honeydew, and charen-
tais. They’re similar to muskmelons, but they offer a tropical, juicy flavor. 
Watermelons come in the traditional “let’s have a picnic” oblong shape as 
well as the more compact, round shape (also called an icebox shape). Yellow-
fleshed and seedless watermelon varieties also are available. Most muskmel-
ons tend to weigh between 2 and 5 pounds, but watermelons can run from 8 
pounds to between 20 and 30 pounds. And you thought all melons are alike!
 
When is a cantaloupe not a cantaloupe? When it’s a muskmelon. The round, 
netted, tan-colored, orange-fleshed fruits that you see in grocery stores usually 
are sold as “cantaloupes.” However, true cantaloupes are tropical fruits that 
have green flesh and hard skin and are rarely seen in this country. What people 
from the United States refer to as cantaloupes technically are muskmelons.
Here’s a description of some specialty melons you might like to try:
 
✓ Charentais: This traditional French melon has modern varieties that 
look like muskmelons. It has deep orange flesh and a honeylike flavor.
 
✓ Crenshaw: This salmon-fleshed, oval-shaped melon with dark green skin 
turns mottled yellow when ripe. It needs a long season (about 4 months) 
to mature.
 
✓ Honeydew: This sweet, juicy melon has smooth tan skin and pale green 
flesh; unlike other melons, it doesn’t continue to ripen off the vine. 
These melons store longer than muskmelons.
 
✓ Mediterranean: This group of melons includes many types, such as 
Israeli, Galia, Piel de Sapo (Christmas), Canary, and Middle Eastern. This 
is a large group of tropical melons that generally have yellow skin and 
sweet, aromatic, pale green or white flesh when mature.
Perusing popular melon varieties
 
Like all cucumber-family crops, melons need warmth, water, space, and sun. 
For these reasons, they grow well in the Southeast and the Southwest United 
States. But with the right variety selection and some growing tricks (see the 
“Growing Those Vines” section later in this chapter), cool-climate gardeners 
also can enjoy these sweet, juicy fruits. The days to maturity noted in the fol-
lowing sections are from seeding in the garden until first harvest.

Muskmelons and specialty melons
Here are some popular muskmelon and specialty melon varieties:
 
✓ ‘Alaska’: This early hybrid muskmelon variety grows well in areas with 
short growing seasons. It produces 4-pound fruits in 70 days.
 
✓ ‘Ambrosia’: This 5-pound hybrid muskmelon has sweet, salmon-colored 
flesh and good resistance to powdery mildew disease. It matures in 86 days.
 
✓ ‘Amy’: This AAS-winning hybrid muskmelon is firm and deliciously 
scented. The vines tolerate poor soils and only grow 6 feet long, maturing 
3- to 4-pound fruits with white flesh and canary-colored skin in 70 days.
 
✓ ‘Early Crenshaw’: This hybrid early-maturing crenshaw-type melon pro-
duces 14-pound fruits with mild-flavored, peach-colored flesh. It matures 
in 90 days.
 
✓ ‘Earli-Dew’: This early-maturing hybrid honeydew-type melon has lime 
green flesh and produces 2- to 4-pound fruits. It matures in 85 days.
 
✓ ‘Hale’s Best’: This popular heirloom muskmelon features 3- to 4-pound 
fruits with succulent, deep salmon-colored flesh in 80 days.
 
✓ ‘Lambkin’: This hybrid AAS-winning Piel de Sapo or Christmas melon 
hails from Spain. This variety features 2- to 4-pound fruits with beauti-
ful mottled green- and gold-colored skin and honey-sweet white flesh. It 
matures quickly in 70 days.
 
✓ ‘Passport’: This hybrid Galia-type, 5- to 6-pound melon has light green 
flesh. It has good disease resistance, is widely adapted, and matures in 
73 days.
 
✓ ‘Savor’: This hybrid Charentais-type melon features 2-pound fruits with 
sweet, orange flesh. This great, small melon matures in 78 days.
 
✓ ‘Sugar Nut’: This hybrid Canary-type melon produces 2-pound fruits 
with sweet, white flesh. Because of their diminutive size, they’re perfect 
for snacking. This variety matures in 77 days.
Watermelons
The following are popular watermelon varieties:
 
✓ ‘Crimson Sweet’: This oval-shaped, open-pollinated watermelon variety 
produces sweet, red-fleshed, 25-pound fruits and has good disease resis-
tance. It matures in 90 days.
 
✓ ‘Moon and Stars’: This heirloom oblong-shaped watermelon features 25-
pound fruits with dark green skin with yellow “moon and stars” markings 
(squint and you can see them — or what passes for them) and has very 
sweet, pink flesh. The variety matures in 95 days.
 
✓ ‘Orange Sunshine’: This very sweet, oval, seedless, orange-fleshed 
variety produces 10- to 15-pound fruits in 85 days.

111
 Chapter 8: Vigorous Vines: Cucumbers, Melons, Pumpkins, and Squash
 
✓ ‘Sugar Baby’: This round, compact, open-pollinated watermelon variety 
produces icebox-size (8- to 10-pound), red-fleshed fruits with a mottled 
green skin in 85 days. Youngins love this sweet, kid-sized fruit.
 
✓ ‘Sweet Beauty’: This AAS-winning, oval-shaped, red, seedless variety 
features 5- to 6-pound fruits that mature in 80 days.
 
✓ ‘Yellow Doll’: This hybrid, oval-shaped, yellow-fleshed watermelon 
produces 4- to 8-pound fruits in 70 days.
 
Seedless watermelon varieties may germinate more slowly than other varieties, 
especially in cool soils (below 65 degrees Fahrenheit). So wait until the soil is 
warm before seeding and give them a few more days than the other 
watermelon varieties to germinate.
Unearthing the Humble Squash
Squash may not be as glamorous as their melon cousins, but boy can they 
produce. Whether you’re growing summer squash or winter squash, they’ll 
produce an abundance of fruit and flowers with seemingly little attention. 
Just ask any gardener friend who has grown zucchini before, and he or she 
will attest to how prolific these vegetables are. In the following sections, I 
define different kinds of squash and describe many popular squash varieties.
 
One way to slow squash production is to eat the flowers. They taste great 
stuffed with cheese and herbs or sautéed with olive oil and garlic, along with 
some Italian bread.
Different squash types
Before setting out to incorporate squash into your garden, the first order of 
business is to define the different types. They’re generally broken into two 
categories — summer squash and winter squash. From there you’ll find all 
sorts of different types. The following list should help:
 
✓ Summer squash are bush-type plants whose fruits are harvested when 
they’re tender and immature. Summer squash usually are separated 
into yellow, straight, or crookneck varieties; green zucchini varieties; or 
green-, white-, or yellow-skinned, scallop-shaped, “patty-pan” fruit vari-
eties, as shown in Figure 8-1. (This last group got its name because the 
fruits resemble the pie shells used in England for baking vegetable, meat, 
or fish “patties.”) Summer squash usually mature within 2 months of 
planting and continue to produce all season long. Summer squash don’t 
store well, however.

fruits look

pie pans.
 
 
✓ Winter squash have vining or bush-type plants whose fruits are har-
vested when they’re fully mature. They mature after 3 months or more of 
growing and are best harvested after the cool, fall weather sets in. You 
can store them for months in a cool basement — hence the name winter 
squash. They’re also good for baking.
 
 You can easily get lost in the maze of winter squash types, so here’s a 
quick list of the most popular types. I include the botanical names, too, 
for you Latin buffs.
 
• Acorn (Cucurbita pepo): This squash type has black, dark green, or 
white skin and an acorn-shaped, ribbed fruit. It has pale yellow flesh.
 
• Buttercup (Cucurbita maxima): This green or orange, turban-
shaped type has a “button” on the end of its fruits. It has dry, 
orange flesh.
 
• Butternut (Cucurbita moschata): This bottle-shaped squash has 
smooth, tan-colored skin and moist, orange flesh at maturity.
 
• Delicata (Cucurbita pepo): This small, green- and yellow-striped, 
zucchini-shaped squash has sweet, pale yellow flesh.
 
• Hubbard (Cucurbita maxima): This large, blue or green, oval-
shaped squash has a long neck and dry yellow or orange flesh.
 
• Kabocha (Cucurbita maxima): This buttercup-like squash has 
drier and sweeter flesh than other types. It’s the latest winter 
squash craze.
 
• Spaghetti (Cucurbita pepo): This oblong, tan-colored squash has 
yellow flesh with a stringy, spaghetti-like texture. Kids think it’s cool 
that a squash could look like spaghetti, so consider impressing your 
own children (or your neighbor’s) by growing this type.

Keep your squash areas weeded and watered, and you’ll be rewarded with 
super squash. Just remember to give the plants room to grow. Summer squash 
varieties tend to stay in a bush form, but they still need a few feet to spread 
out. And even though winter squash do come in bush forms, most of the best-
flavored varieties have at least 6-foot vines. Check out the later section 
“Planting and feeding” for the full scoop on growing squash and other viners 
with ease.
Popular squash varieties
The lists of summer and winter squash varieties in the following sections 
include some of my favorites; they’re easy to grow, produce well consistently, 
and have a sweet flavor. The days to maturity are from seeding in the garden 
until first harvest.
Summer squash varieties
The following are my favorite summer squash varieties:
 
✓ ‘Black Beauty’: This standard open-pollinated, zucchini-type variety pro-
duces tons of dark green, slender fruits on open, easy-to-harvest bush 
plants in 60 days. Zucchinis can be gold-colored as well, such as with the 
AAS-winning ‘Gold Rush’ variety. This golden variety matures in 50 days.
 
✓ ‘Magda’: This hybrid, light-green-skinned summer squash is a variation 
on the traditional straight-neck squash. It’s shorter and more blocky. It’s 
often called the cousa or Lebanese squash and has a sweet, nutty flavor. 
The fruits mature in 48 days.
 
✓ ‘Portofino’: This classic, deeply ribbed, green- and white-striped hybrid 
Italian zucchini has a crisp, nutty flesh on open plants. This variety takes 
55 days to mature.
 
✓ ‘Sunburst’: This hybrid, yellow-skinned patty pan summer squash has 
tender, scallop-shaped fruits that mature in 50 days. For a green patty 
pan variety, try the AAS-winning ‘Peter Pan’, which matures in 50 days.
 
✓ ‘Yellow Crookneck’: This heirloom, smooth, yellow-skinned crookneck 
squash has a delicate texture and flavor. (Crookneck squash have a bent 
top, or neck.) The variety takes 50 days to mature.
Winter squash varieties
Good winter squash varieties include the following:
 
✓ ‘Baby Blue Hubbard’: This scaled-down version of the typical heirloom 
12- to 20-pound ‘Blue Hubbard’ winter squash produces 4- to 5-pound 
fruits with dry, sweet, yellow flesh and a very hard shell. This variety, 
which matures in 100 days, is especially great for storage and baking.

114
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
✓ ‘Burgess Buttercup’: This 3- to 5-pound open-pollinated winter squash 
has sweet, fiberless (not stringy), orange flesh. This variety, which 
matures in 95 days, is one of my personal favorites. (Its sweet flavor and 
dry flesh taste great with a little maple syrup mixed in!) ‘Bon Bon’ is a 
good hybrid variety.
 
✓ ‘Cornell’s Bush Delicata’: This AAS-winning variety features bushy 
plants that are resistant to powdery mildew disease. The green- and 
white-striped oblong fruits mature in 100 days and have a sweet orange 
flesh. I love to eat this variety baked.
 
✓ ‘Red Kuri’: This attractive, teardrop-shaped, 4- to 7-pound open-pollinated 
‘Baby Red Hubbard’ squash has orange skin and flesh. It’s great for pies and 
purees and matures in 92 days.
 
✓ ‘Spaghetti’: This ivory-skinned, yellow-fleshed, 4- to 5-pound open-
pollinated winter squash has stringy, spaghetti-like flesh. Try this one 
baked and covered with pasta sauce! It takes 88 days to mature.
 
✓ ‘Sweet Sunshine’: This hybrid kabocha-type winter squash has bright 
orange skin and produces 3- to 5-pound fruits with sweet, dry, flaky, 
deep orange flesh. This variety takes 95 days to mature.
 
✓ ‘Table King’: This 6-inch-diameter, green-skinned, open-pollinated acorn 
winter squash grows on a bush plant. It takes 80 days to mature. A similar 
gold-colored variety is called ‘Table Gold’.
 
 A newer, smaller-sized hybrid acorn squash called ‘Honey Bear’ is great 
for single servings. It matures in 85 days.
 
✓ ‘Waltham Butternut’: This heirloom variety produces light-tan-colored, 
5-pound fruits that have smooth-textured orange flesh. It takes 105 days 
to mature.
Great Pumpkins: Counting the 
Uses for This Versatile Squash
Pumpkins are the quintessential fall crop in many areas, and most peoples’ 
favorite winter squash. (Yes, pumpkins are squashes, too. Most pumpkin 
varieties are in the Cucurbita pepo species, directly related to the acorn- and 
spaghetti-type winter squash that I describe earlier in this chapter.) Pumpkins 
are used in pies, soups, and casseroles or carved into ghoulish shapes on 
Halloween. Even their seeds are edible!
Because people are so interested in pumpkins, modern breeders have cre-
ated many different varieties. Some varieties are great for carving into jack-
o’-lanterns, some are bred for cooking, and still others are known for their 
tasty seeds. When my daughter Elena was young she loved to roast batches 

115
 Chapter 8: Vigorous Vines: Cucumbers, Melons, Pumpkins, and Squash
of ‘Triple Treat’, naked-hulled (thin-hulled) pumpkin seeds because they pop 
like popcorn. You can bake any pumpkin seeds, but in my opinion, the hul-
less types are best for flavor and crunchiness. (In case you’re wondering, the 
hull is the coat of the seed.) Other types of pumpkins, like ‘Atlantic Giant’, are 
bred to win awards; they can grow to such huge sizes that they could practi-
cally break a truck’s suspension.
Pumpkins are grown similar to winter squash and require plenty of space to 
vine. Here are a few of the most popular pumpkin varieties:
 
✓ ‘Atlantic Giant’: This is the pumpkin that sets world records. Technically, 
it’s called a Cucurbita maxima (similar to Hubbard squash). It requires lots 
of water, heat, and fertilizer to reach the mammoth 1,600-pound, world-
record size. This variety looks like a flat tire when it matures. Even though 
your pumpkin may not weigh 1,600 pounds, a few hundred pounds is still 
a lot of pumpkin. ‘Atlantic Giant’ is open-pollinated and takes 115 days to 
mature. This is one large vine.
 
✓ ‘Baby Bear’: This is the smallest pumpkin variety, so naturally kids are 
attracted to it. ‘Baby Bear’ is an AAS-winning, 2-pound, open-pollinated, 
minipumpkin that’s great for cooking. Its semi-naked (thin-hulled) seeds 
taste great roasted. This variety matures in 105 days.
 
✓ ‘Connecticut Field’: This classic 20-pound, open-pollinated, flat-
bottomed, jack-o’-lantern pumpkin is great for carving and baking. It 
matures on large vines in 115 days.
 
✓ ‘Lumina’: This unusual, white-skinned, orange-fleshed, open-pollinated, 
20-pound pumpkin can be made into a ghostly looking jack-o’-lantern. It 
takes 95 days to mature.
 
✓ ‘Rouge Vif d’Etampes’: This attractive, red-skinned, French heirloom 
pumpkin variety, which is also known as ‘Cinderella’, is in the Cucurbita 
maxima species. The 10-pound fruits are short and squat (like a wheel 
of cheese) and are good in pies. The variety takes 115 days to mature. 
Another similarly shaped variety is ‘Long Island Cheese’, which has tan-
colored skin.
 
✓ ‘Small Sugar’: Known as the pumpkin for pies, this 4- to 6-pound, open-
pollinated variety features smooth-textured flesh and a small seed 
cavity. It takes 95 days to mature.
 
✓ ‘Triple Treat’: This open-pollinated pumpkin is grown especially for its 
thin-hulled, naked seeds, which are great roasted. You also can carve 
this 8-pound pumpkin and use its flesh in a pie or bake it. This variety 
takes 110 days to mature.
 
 The seeds of this all-purpose pumpkin are slower and more finicky about 
germinating than other pumpkin varieties. So wait until the soil is 65 
degrees to plant; you may even want to start it indoors for 3 to 4 weeks 
before planting outside.

Growing Those Vines
Warmth, water, and proper pollination are the keys to growing cucumber-
family crops. In the following sections, I explain how to plant, feed, water, pol-
linate, and harvest your viners; I also provide tips on how to keep pests and 
diseases under control.
Planting and feeding
 
Because vining vegetables love the heat, you don’t need to rush the season 
and plant early. Wait until your soil temperature is at least 60 degrees at 
seeding depth before planting these vegetables. Here are some guidelines for 
starting viners, based on your climate zone (see the appendix for more about 
these zones):
 
✓ Zones 3 and 4: If you live in zones 3 or 4 and have a very short growing 
season, you may want to start cucumbers, melons, pumpkins, and 
squash indoors 3 to 4 weeks before your last frost date. Or consider 
buying transplants at a garden center. To get a jump on the season in 
cool areas such as zones 3 and 4 (though zones 5 and 6 can also benefit), 
lay black or dark green plastic mulch on your soil 1 or 2 weeks before 
planting to heat up the soil (see Chapter 15 for details).
 
✓ Any other zone: If you live in other climate zones, sowing seeds directly 
in your garden should work fine. In warm areas such as southern Florida 
and Texas, you can even start a fall crop of cucumbers or summer 
squash. Pull out the first group of plants when the summer heat, insects, 
and diseases become too intense; then plant a fall crop in August to 
mature 3 or 4 months later.
Plant seeds about 1 inch deep in the soil, and space them far enough apart so 
they have room to ramble. For vining varieties of cucumbers, melons, squash, 
and pumpkins, plant hills at least 6 to 10 feet apart. For bush varieties, plant 
seeds about 2 to 4 feet apart. Follow the spacing guidelines for individual veg-
etables in the appendix.
 
Planting in hills is really a misnomer. It means planting four or six seeds in 
a 1-foot-diameter circle. After germination, you thin these seedlings to two 
plants per hill.

117
 Chapter 8: Vigorous Vines: Cucumbers, Melons, Pumpkins, and Squash
You also can plant cucumber-family crops in rows, but the hill method is 
better with the vining types because it enables you to thin the weakest plants 
and not throw off the spacing between the remaining plants. However, if 
you’re using black plastic mulch (which is necessary in cool areas), your best 
option is to plant in rows (see Chapter 13 for details).
 
If you don’t have a lot of room in your garden (viners require 4 to 6 feet), but 
you really want to grow pumpkins, melons, and vining varieties of cucumbers 
and squash, try these space-saving techniques:
 
✓ Pinch off the tips of the vines after the fruits have set to keep them from 
extending too far (see Figure 8-2).
 
✓ Physically pick up the vines and direct them back toward the plant.
 
✓ Plant along the edge of your garden so that the vines run into your lawn. 
That way you don’t have to mow as much lawn either.
 
✓ Grow cucumbers and melons on an A-frame trellis (see Chapter 15 for 
trellising options), which helps plants grow straighter and stay cleaner. 
You may need to support melons with a nylon or fabric sling, shown in 
Figure 8-3, after they form.
 
Figure 8-2:

the ends 
of vines to

in bounds 
and mature

The cucumber-family responds better than any other vegetable family to 
extra doses of manure and compost. Cucumber-family crops love organic 
matter, so add a generous 3- to 4-inch-thick layer of compost to each plant-
ing bed. Sometimes pumpkin plants vine out of old compost or manure piles, 
which is evidence of how much this vegetable family loves manure. If you 
don’t have a source for manure or compost, work in a handful of balanced 
organic fertilizer, such as 5-5-5, around each plant. To help increase the fruit 
count and size, add a side-dressing of the same fertilizer after the plants 
begin vining. Chapter 15 discusses side-dressing and fertilizer in more detail.

Water, water, water!
 
Cucumber-family crops are like camels; they’re almost 95 percent water at 
maturity. Without a consistent supply of water, your melons won’t taste sweet, 
your winter squash and pumpkins won’t grow large, and your cucumbers 
will taste bitter. To get the best-sized and best-tasting vining crops, give your 
plants a consistent supply of water. The general rule is to water so that the soil 
is wet 6 inches deep. If you’re growing your crops with black plastic mulch, 
consider placing a soaker hose or drip irrigation hose underneath the plastic 
to ensure that the water gets to the plants. (See Chapter 15 for more watering 
ideas.) After the soil has warmed, mulch around the plants with a 3- to 4-inch-
thick layer of hay or straw to help conserve moisture and keep weeds away. 
(You don’t need to mulch with hay if you’re using black plastic, however.)
 
If you want the sweetest melons, water consistently until a week or so before 
maturity and then reduce your frequency of watering; the melon fruits will 
have less water and taste sweeter.
The great thing about this group of vining crops is that after they start growing 
and running to their hearts delight, they shade the ground, preventing weeds 
from germinating and keeping the soil moist. They’re their own best friends!
Ensuring proper pollination
Proper pollination is a key to growing successful cucumber-family crops, which 
can pose particular problems. Because most cucumber-family vegetables 

119
 Chapter 8: Vigorous Vines: Cucumbers, Melons, Pumpkins, and Squash
have separate male and female flowers on the same plant, they need Mother 
Nature’s help to pollinate the female flowers and produce fruit.
Most of the problems that I hear from gardeners — like zucchini rotting before 
it starts growing, too few fruits on squash plants, and misshapen cucumber 
fruits — are due to poor insect pollination. Bees are the solution as well as the 
problem: Honeybees, bumblebees, and many other wild bees carry out pollina-
tion, but they’re finicky. For example, bees don’t fly when the weather is cloudy 
or too cool. Also, native bee populations are declining because of a variety of 
environmental and pest problems. Fewer bees mean fewer chances that your 
flowers will be pollinated. And each cucumber-family crop flower opens for 
only 1 day.
So what’s a gardener to do? Either try to attract bees to your garden by grow-
ing a variety of bee-attractive flowers and herbs or else pollinate the flow-
ers yourself! And no, you don’t have to buzz around and dress up in a bee 
costume to fool the plants. Here’s a simple way to pollinate crops if you’re 
having trouble getting fruit:
 
1. Identify the male and female flowers on your plant (see Figure 8-4).
 
 Don’t be discouraged if you don’t see female flowers at first. Male flow-
ers form about a week ahead of the females. The female flowers will 
come along; just be patient.
 
2. Before noon on the morning that the male flower first opens, pick the 
male flower and then remove the petals to reveal the sexual parts of 
the flower (the stamen), which contain the yellow pollen.
 
 You use this male flower to pollinate a female flower from the same variety 
of plant. For example, don’t try to use a cucumber flower to pollinate a 
pumpkin plant.

3. Choose a female flower that has also just opened and swish the stamen 
around inside that flower. Repeat this process with other female flowers, 
using the same male flower for two to three pollinations.
 
 Voilà; you’ve done it. Congratulations, have a cigar!
 
If your squash and pumpkins are growing close together, and bees cross-
pollinate them, will you get a squakin? Not this year at least. Cross-pollination 
happens when the pollen from one variety or type of plant goes to a different 
variety or type of plant. Only the same species of Cucurbits can cross-pollinate 
each other. For example, a cucumber can’t cross-pollinate a pumpkin. However, 
squash (such as an acorn and zucchini type) and pumpkins in the same spe-
cies can cross-pollinate each other. (You can tell the species by looking at the 
second word in the plant’s botanical name.) However, this cross-pollination 
won’t affect your crop for this year. Your acorn squash will still look and taste 
like an acorn squash, even if it was pollinated by a pumpkin flower. However, 
if you save the squash seed and plant it the following year, you may get an 
interesting creation. But that’s why gardening is fun!
Controlling pests and diseases
Dampening the success of a good vine crop is tough. Once established, vining 
crops don’t have any more pest problems than other vegetables. Modern, 
disease-resistant varieties help ward off fungi, bacteria, and viruses. However, 
you still need to watch out for powdery and downy mildew, wilt, and viruses 
that affect all vegetables (see Chapter 17). Also, stay out of the vine crop 
patch when the leaves are wet because you can easily spread disease as you 
move. Finally, remember that common insect pests, such as aphids and cut-
worms, attack young plants.
 
Here are a few diseases and pests that particularly love vining crops:
 
✓ Anthracnose: This fungus attacks many vegetables, but it especially 
loves cucumbers, muskmelons, and watermelons. During warm, humid 
conditions, the leaves develop yellow or black circular spots, and fruits 
develop sunken spots with dark borders. To slow this disease, space 
plants a few feet further apart than normal so the leaves can dry quickly 
in the morning. Also, destroy infected leaves and fruits. You also can 
avoid this disease by rotating crops yearly.
 
✓ Bacterial wilt: This devastating bacterial disease is found mainly on 
cucumbers and muskmelons. Sure signs of the disease are well-watered 
plants that wilt during the day but recover at night. Eventually, the 
plants will wilt and die. If you cut open a wilting vine, the sap will be 
sticky and white. To control this disease, plant resistant varieties and 
control the cucumber beetle, which is the pest that spreads bacterial 
wilt in your garden.

121
 Chapter 8: Vigorous Vines: Cucumbers, Melons, Pumpkins, and Squash
 
✓ Cucumber beetle: This 1/4-inch-long, yellow- and black-striped (or spotted) 
adult beetle feeds on all cucumber-family crops. The adults feed on the 
leaves, and the young larvae feed on the roots. Cucumber beetles are the 
chief culprits for spreading bacterial wilt and virus diseases; they’re espe-
cially devastating to young plants.
 
 To control cucumber beetles, cover young plants with a floating row 
cover (a cheesecloth-like material that keeps insects out but lets in air, 
light, and water; see Chapter 21 for details) as soon as they emerge. 
After the plants flower, remove the row cover so bees can pollinate the 
flowers. You also can apply a botanical spray such as pyrethrin on the 
adult beetles.
 
✓ Squash bug: These 1/2-inch-long, brown or gray bugs love to attack 
squash and pumpkins, especially late in the growing season. The adults 
and smaller-sized young feed on leaves and stems, sucking out the plant 
juices. These insects move in packs, and their feeding can quickly stunt 
your plants. Squash bugs usually start laying eggs when the plants begin 
to vine. To control these pests, crush the masses of reddish-brown eggs 
on the underside of leaves. Also, rotate crops and clean up plant debris 
in fall where the squash bugs overwinter (live through the winter).
 
✓ Squash vine borer: This pest mostly affects squash and pumpkin plants. 
In early summer, the adult moths lay their eggs on stems near the plants’ 
bases. After the eggs hatch, white caterpillars with brown heads tunnel 
into the plants’ stems to feed. They can cause well-watered vines to wilt 
during the day and eventually die. Look for entry holes and the sawdust-
like droppings at the base of your plants to see if vine borers are pres-
ent. Consider growing butternut squash, which is less susceptible to 
vine borers.
 
 To control these pests, try one of the following methods:
 
• Slit your plant’s stem lengthwise from the entry hole toward the tip 
of the vine with a sharp razor, and physically remove the caterpil-
lar. Then cover the stem with soil; it will reroot itself.
 
• Cover the plants with a floating row cover until they begin to 
flower, which keeps the moths from laying their eggs.
 
• Inject Bt (Bacillus thurengiensis; a naturally occurring bacterium 
that attacks only caterpillar-family insects) into the stem with a 
syringe to kill any young caterpillars.
Harvesting your vining crop
One of the keys to a good cucumber-family crop is harvesting the fruits at the 
right time. Here are some guidelines for you to follow:

122
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
✓ Cucumbers: The fruits are best when harvested small — slicers when 
they’re 6 inches long and picklers when they’re 4 inches long. If they 
grow too large and begin to turn yellow, the seeds inside the cucumber 
are maturing, and the plant will stop producing flowers and fruits. Pick 
off and compost any large fruits that you missed so you can keep the 
young ones coming.
 
✓ Summer squash: Harvest summer squash as small as possible, even if 
the flower is still attached. Doing so helps you avoid the glut of zucchi-
nis that always happens by midsummer.
 
✓ Winter squash and pumpkins: Harvest winter squash and pumpkins 
after they change to the expected color of their variety and their skin 
is thick enough that your thumbnail can’t puncture them. If you want 
to store winter squash and pumpkins through the fall and winter, don’t 
let them get nipped by frost, or they’ll rot. Leave 2 inches of the stem 
attached for best storing.
Deciding when to harvest muskmelons can be tricky. After their skin color 
turns from green to tan and the netting (the ribbing on the skin that’s slightly 
raised) becomes more pronounced, gently lift the melons up. If they’re ripe, 
the fruits will slip, or easily detach, from the vine. If you aren’t sure, harvest-
ing early rather than late is better because most melons continue to ripen off 
the vine.
Watermelon harvesting is even more complicated because it’s often not obvi-
ous when the fruits are ready to harvest. Follow these tips:
 
✓ Watch for changing colors: Two signs that it may be time to harvest 
watermelons are when the skin color turns from shiny to dull and when 
the color of the spot where the watermelon rests on the ground turns 
from white to yellow.
 
✓ Thump the watermelons: I love watching the old-time gardeners thump 
watermelons with their fingers to figure out when they’re ripe. Whether 
this test is consistently accurate is another story. Here’s what to look 
for: Unripe watermelons have a sharp sound, and ripe ones have a muf-
fled sound. The rest is experience!
 
✓ Look for brown tendrils: The surest way to tell whether your water-
melons are ripe is to look at their tendrils. Tendrils are the little curli-
cues coming off the stems that attach to whatever weeds and plants 
are around. When the tendril closest to the ripening watermelon turns 
brown, it’s harvest time!

B
roccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower: All these hardy 
vegetable are in the same family, so they get lumped together in this 
chapter. Even though they may look different, they all require similar growing 
conditions. So if you can grow one, you probably will have success with the 
others. These crops love it cool, so they thrive in northern areas or when
grown in spring, fall, and even winter in southern areas. This group is often 
referred to as the “cole” crops, because cole is the German word for cabbage — 
and since all these vegetables are related to cabbage, they often are referred to 
as the cabbage family of crops.
In this chapter, I discuss the major cole crops. Other related but less popular 
cole crops, such as collards, kale, kohlrabi, and Chinese cabbage, are covered 
in Chapter 11. All fall in the Brassica oleracea botanical family.
Paying Attention to the Often-
Overlooked Cole Crops
In the beginning there wasn’t anything glamorous about cole crops. They 
weren’t as colorful, succulent, or sensuous as tomatoes or melons. Cole 
crops were simply known for being rugged, tough, good-for-you plants. Just 
look at variety names such as ‘Snow Crown’ cauliflower and ‘Stonehead’ cab-
bage, and you get the picture.

124
Part II: Vegging Out 
However, that reputation has begun to change. With the advent of interesting-
shaped heirloom and hybrid varieties and the coloring of cauliflower into 
orange, green, and purple heads, cole crops are becoming trendy. They may 
never be as sexy as the melons, but they’re getting a facelift.
Even with a new look, cole crops are still reliable staples in any vegetable 
garden. Given cool conditions, fertile soil, and proper watering, these plants 
produce lots of nutritious and delicious vegetables (as you find out in the 
later section “Growing Your Own Cole Crops”).
However, many people still haven’t warmed up to cole crops. I don’t under-
stand this aversion. Cole crops are tasty, easy to grow, and capable of pro-
ducing over long periods of time. Plus, with the exploding interest in eating 
nutritious foods and the discovery of the great potential health benefits of 
broccoli and other vegetables in its family (see Chapter 2), more and more 
people are dipping, steaming, and stir-frying their way to health with cole 
crops. In the following sections, I provide details on different varieties of 
broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower.
Easing into cole crops with broccoli
Broccoli is one of the easiest cole crops to grow, and it’s one that’s close to 
my heart. Like my ancestors, broccoli hails from Italy. My mother and I still 
enjoy a good meal of garlic sautéed in olive oil and tossed with broccoli, 
accompanied by a loaf of fresh Italian bread. She likes the smaller-headed, 
old-fashioned, sprouting broccoli varieties such as ‘DeCicco’, whose stems 
and leaves are so tender that they’re eaten along with the head.
Modern broccoli varieties have been bred to form one large main head. This 
head is simply a tight cluster of flower buds. Once the main head is cut off, 
multiple side branches and mini heads form along the plant. In most areas, 
the side branches and mini heads continue to form until the plant is killed by 
frost, insects, or disease. So from one plant, you can harvest right through 
summer, fall, and winter (if your climate is warm enough). I explain how to 
harvest broccoli in more detail later in this chapter.
 
Choosing the right broccoli variety for your garden depends on a number of 
factors, including where you live and what you plan to do with the crop. Here 
are a few guidelines to follow when choosing a broccoli variety:
 
✓ If you plan to stock up for the winter by freezing broccoli heads, choose 
a variety with large heads that mature mostly at the same time. Try 
‘Green Magic’ or ‘Premium Crop’.
 
✓ Broccoli, like all cole crops, likes cool weather. Warm weather makes the 
heads flower too quickly, resulting in a bitter flavor. Gardeners in warm 
climates should choose varieties that withstand heat or mature early, 
before the heat of summer. ‘Packman’ is a good choice.

125
 Chapter 9: Cool Weather Staples
 
✓ If you want a long, steady production of small but tender side shoots, 
choose an old-fashioned variety with good side-shoot production, such 
as my mom’s favorite, ‘DeCicco’.
 
✓ If you live in a humid climate (such as Dallas) or a coastal area that 
has lots of fog and mist (such as San Francisco), broccoli heads can rot 
before maturing. Choose varieties with added disease resistance and 
tightly clustered flower heads that shed water easily, such as ‘Arcadia’.
Here’s a list of some of the best broccoli varieties to grow. The days to matu-
rity listed for each variety refers to the number of days from transplanting 
a seedling into the garden until the harvest of the main head. If you sow the 
seeds directly into the garden, add another 20 days to estimate the maturity 
date. Of course, the actual number of days varies depending on weather and 
soil conditions. All plants listed grow to about 1 to 2 feet:
 
✓ ‘Arcadia’: A large, 8-inch-diameter, blue-green-colored head is formed 
high on stems above the foliage, making this variety easier to harvest 
than other broccoli varieties. ‘Arcadia’ is a hybrid variety (see Chapter 3 
for more on hybrids), so it’s a vigorous grower, producing uniform-sized 
heads in 63 days, and has excellent disease resistance. It’s also tender 
and tasty.
 
✓ ‘Belstar’: This hybrid is a favorite of commercial organic growers. It’s 
widely adapted, produces 6-inch-diameter heads equally well in spring 
or fall, and it also has good side-shoot production. This variety matures 
in 66 days.
 
✓ ‘DeCicco’: This heirloom, old-fashioned Italian variety produces a 3-inch-
diameter main head and multiple side shoots in 48 days and has tender 
leaves and stems.
 
✓ ‘Green Magic’: This early-maturing hybrid broccoli is very heat tolerant, 
making it a good summer and fall crop. The plant produces a 6-inch-
diameter head in 57 days.
 
✓ ‘Packman’: A hybrid, this variety produces a 9-inch-diameter main head 
earlier (52 days) than other large-headed varieties such as ‘Premium 
Crop’. It also has excellent side-shoot production and heat tolerance.
 
✓ ‘Premium Crop’: An All-America Selections (AAS) winner (see Chapter 4 
for more about this designation), this hybrid broccoli produces a large, 
9-inch-diameter head late in the season (after 62 days). However, it’s 
slow to flower, so you don’t have to rush to pick it.
 
✓ ‘Purple Sprouting’: This Italian heirloom produces a 2-foot-tall plant 
with multiple 3-inch-diameter purple heads late in the season (after 125 
days). It’s best grown in cool northern areas to mature in late fall. Or, in 
mild-winter climates, you can plant it in fall and grow it through the winter 
to mature in early spring. (Refer to the section “Giving cole crops what 
they want,” later in this chapter, for planting tips.) The head turns green 
upon cooking.

126
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
✓ ‘Small Miracle’: This early hybrid variety grows less than 1-foot- tall, so 
the plants only need to be spaced 8 inches apart, which makes this 
variety great for small gardens. It produces 6- to 8-inch heads in 55 days.
Brussels sprouts: The little cabbages
Rows of Brussels sprout stems standing tall in the garden loaded with 
sprouts are a sure sign of fall. Although the sprouts take a whole season to 
mature, they’re relatively maintenance-free, and the sprouts turn a sweet, 
nutty flavor after they’re touched by cold weather.
To the untrained eye, a Brussels sprout plant can look like a strange life-form 
from another planet. Small, cabbagelike sprouts grow in clusters along the 
3-foot-tall stem, and often gardeners remove most of the leaves so that the 
sprouts grow larger. The plants look like miniature palm trees (see Figure 9-1), 
with mini-cabbages on the stalk. In fact, if you like cabbage, you’ll love the simi-
lar flavor of the smaller and more manageable Brussels sprouts.
 
The key to growing Brussels sprouts is having a long growing season and a 
cool fall to induce the best flavor. The flavor actually benefits from a light frost.

The following varieties are widely adaptable and worth a try in any garden. 
The days to maturity are from setting out seedlings to first harvest. Add 20 
days to the maturity if direct seeding into the garden.
 
✓ ‘Diablo’: This hybrid is a standout in American and European gardens. 
The 3-foot-tall plants produce heavy crops of medium-sized sprouts later 
in the season (after 110 days). The sprouts stay firm when mature and 

127
 Chapter 9: Cool Weather Staples
hold well in the garden (can be left on the plant in the garden until you 
need them in the kitchen).
 
✓ ‘Jade Cross E’: A hybrid AAS winner, this variety’s 21/2-foot-tall plants 
produce good-sized sprouts all the way up their stalks in 90 days.
 
✓ ‘Oliver’: One of the earliest-maturing varieties, this hybrid matures in 85 
days on 2-foot-tall plants. It is well adapted to many climates.
 
✓ ‘Red Rubine’: Yes, even Brussels sprouts have color variations. This 
heirloom variety produces very tasty and attractive red sprouts on a 
hardy, purplish-red-colored 2-foot-tall plant. The red color remains even 
after cooking. This variety matures in 95 days.
Choosing cabbage: The age-old and 
dependable cole crop
When many people think of cole crops, they first think of cabbages. Broccoli 
and cauliflower may be gaining in popularity, and Brussels sprouts may be 
novel, but cabbage is a long-time, solid vegetable citizen. It has been an easy-
to-grow staple in Europe for hundreds of years and for centuries before that 
in the Middle East.
Cabbage-growing isn’t as popular as it once was, and you rarely find cabbage 
on the menus of finer restaurants, but the sweet, tender flavor of freshly har-
vested cabbage makes it worthy of a spot in your garden. With so many vari-
eties to choose from, you can have fresh and delicious cole slaw, sauerkraut, 
and boiled cabbage almost all season long — from summer into winter.
 
Cabbage requires the same conditions as other cole crops — cool weather, 
fertile soil, and proper watering — but the variety that you select is a bit more 
important to ensure a continuous harvest. By selecting early-, mid-, and late-
season varieties, you can extend your cabbage harvest season by weeks. You 
can easily get lost in the dizzying array of cabbage varieties:
 
✓ Early-, mid-, and late-season varieties
 
✓ Round, pointy, and flat-headed varieties
 
✓ Smooth-leafed and savoyed (crinkle-leafed) varieties
 
✓ Green and red-colored varieties
 
Growing two or three different varieties that mature at different times allows 
you to spread out the harvest over the growing season. And by spreading out 
the harvest, you avoid getting yourself into the “six heads of cabbage ready all 
the same week” situation. (Even the most ardent cabbage lover would have a 
hard time eating all that cabbage!)

128
Part II: Vegging Out 
To get you started on the right foot, in the following list I describe ten varieties 
that represent the universe of cabbages. (Note, however, that I cover Chinese 
cabbage in Chapter 11.) Cabbage plants can spread to 3 feet in diameter, and 
they all have green leaves and white centers unless otherwise noted. The 
late-maturing and fall-planted varieties are best for storage. (I talk more about 
storing cabbages in Chapter 19.) The days to maturity for each variety are 
from setting out seedlings in the garden to first harvest. Add 20 days to the 
maturity date if you directly seed in the garden. Without further ado, here are 
some varieties to try:
 
✓ ‘Danish Ballhead’: This old-time favorite produces 8-inch-diameter, 
round, smooth-leafed heads late in the season (after 100 days) and is 
great for winter storage. This variety is good for sauerkraut and slaw 
recipes.
 
✓ ‘Early Jersey Wakefield’: This early heirloom smooth-leafed cabbage 
with a pointed head measures 5 inches in diameter and has compact 
plants that are slow to split. (For more on splitting, see the later section 
on harvesting cabbage.) This variety matures in 65 days.
 
✓ ‘Famosa’: This hybrid midseason, round-headed crop produces 2- to 
4-pound, dark blue-green, savoyed heads with a yellow tinted interior 
and tender leaves in 75 days.
 
✓ ‘Golden Acre’: This early-maturing, open-pollinated, round-headed 
variety produces 3- to 4-pound disease-resistant heads that are great in 
salads. The leaves are smooth. It matures in 58 days.
 
✓ ‘Gonzales’: This popular European variety grows to be only 4 to 6 inches 
in diameter, making it a great selection for small spaces. This early-season 
hybrid produces round, softball-sized, smooth-leaved, aqua-green-colored 
heads in 66 days.
 
✓ ‘Late Flat Dutch’: This heirloom, late-maturing, 10-inch-diameter variety 
features a flattened head and smooth leaves. It’s excellent for sauerkraut 
and storage and matures in 100 days.
 
✓ ‘Red Acre’: This red, early-maturing, 6-inch-diameter, round, open-
pollinated cabbage with a dense interior, smooth leaves, and deep color 
has good disease resistance and is great for storage. The cabbages 
mature in 76 days.
 
✓ ‘Ruby Perfection’: This red, midseason hybrid variety produces attrac-
tive 5- to 6-inch-diameter, smooth-leaved, reddish-purple round heads in 
80 days.
 
✓ ‘Savoy Express’: This early hybrid, AAS-winning, sweet-tasting, savoy-
leafed variety produces 1- to 2-pound round heads that are perfect in 
slaw and salad. The variety matures in 55 days.
 
✓ ‘Stonehead’: This widely grown, early-maturing hybrid variety produces 
5- to 6-inch-diameter solid, smooth-leaved, round heads on compact 
plants in 60 days.

 Chapter 9: Cool Weather Staples
Considering cauliflower in 
a rainbow of colors
Think of cauliflower as broccoli’s hard-to-get-along-with brother. Both are 
from southern Europe, require similar growing conditions, and are closely 
related botanically. However, cauliflower plants produce only one head and 
no side shoots, and they have a reputation for being a bit tougher to grow. 
(See the later section “Giving cole crops what they want” for more informa-
tion.) But don’t worry! With the right varieties, proper soil conditions, appro-
priate watering, and well-timed planting, cauliflower can be a joy to grow in 
your vegetable garden. It’s especially exciting for young gardeners who are 
amazed to find a beautiful snow-white-colored head hidden under the green 
leaves. And if you’re tired of pure-white heads, purple-, green-, and even 
orange-headed varieties are now available.
 
Broccoli and cabbage plants produce heads, and Brussels sprout plants pro-
duce, well, sprouts, so what does a cauliflower plant produce? A curd. (But I’ll 
refer to them as heads throughout this chapter, because that’s what folks are 
used to.) No, it’s not a Middle Eastern ethnic group or something that Little 
Miss Muffet ate with her whey. Like a broccoli head, a cauliflower curd is com-
prised of miniature flower heads tightly clustered together.
 
On white cauliflower varieties, the heads stay white and tender only if you 
stop the sun from hitting them by covering the head. (This technique is called 
blanching; see the later section “Nurturing cole crops” for details.) If exposed 
to the sun, the heads turn yellow and develop a mealy texture.
Like cabbage, cauliflower comes in early-, mid-, and late-season varieties. All 
the varieties in the following list produce 6- to 7-inch-diameter heads. The 
days to maturity for each variety are from setting out seedlings in the garden 
until first harvest. Add 20 days to the maturity date for direct seeding in the 
garden. Consider these popular varieties:
 
✓ ‘Cassius’: A favorite among commercial organic growers, this hybrid 
variety features vigorous, sturdy plants and picture-perfect, snowy white 
heads. The variety matures in 65 days.
 
✓ ‘Cheddar’: Here’s where the cauliflower color revolution started. The 
‘Cheddar’ hybrid has orange heads that become even brighter as they 
mature; the color even holds when cooked. The orange coloring is from 
the presence of carotene (the same substance that causes carrots to be 
orange), so this variety is also high in vitamin A and has a sweet flavor. 
The heads mature in 58 days.
 
✓ ‘Fremont’: A self-blanching hybrid variety, ‘Fremont’ is known for 
dependable midseason production (after 62 days), even under adverse 
weather conditions.

130
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
✓ ‘Graffiti’: For eye-popping color, grow some purple cauliflower! The bril-
liant purple-colored head of this hybrid is great raw in salads. However, 
the color fades when cooked. This variety matures in 80 days.
 
✓ ‘Panther’: Not to be outdone by its colorful cousins, ‘Panther’ features 
lime-green-colored heads on hybrid plants. Large, uniform heads 
produce early (in 75 days) and hold well in the garden.
 
✓ ‘Snow Crown’: This is the standard white hybrid variety that’s easy to 
grow, early (60 days), widely adaptable, and dependable.
If you’re looking for a cauliflower with class, try growing the Romaneseco 
types. Originally only grown around Rome, Italy, in fall, this cauliflower is get-
ting broader play today. The heads are sweeter than white cauliflower, but 
take longer to mature (85 to 90 days). The reward for your patience is a pale 
to dark-green head consisting of mini-spirals that look like minarets. This 
variety is almost too beautiful to eat! ‘Veronica’ is a new hybrid variety, and 
‘Minaret’ is an attractive heirloom.
Growing Your Own Cole Crops
As long as the weather is cool, cole crops are a snap to grow. They thrive in 
most parts of the country as a spring or fall crop just for that reason. Start 
with a rich, fertile soil; keep them well weeded and watered; and keep pests 
such as the cabbageworm at bay. You’ll be rewarded with an abundant 
harvest. I explain what you need to know in the following sections.
Giving cole crops what they want
 
The keys to growing all cole crops are cool weather and fertile soil. Cole crops
are cool crops: They grow and taste best when temperatures are below 80 
degrees Fahrenheit, especially when the crops are maturing. Cole crops grow 
best in raised beds (see Chapter 3) and are also fairly demanding of nutrients, 
so be generous with manure and fertilizers (after you’ve done a soil test as 
indicated in Chapter 14 and know what nutrient adjustments need to be made), 
and they’ll reward you with plenty of growth and production.
Because cole crops thrive in cool weather, many gardeners can grow all of them 
to mature as a summer crop and then some as a fall crop. That’s two crops in per 
year! I explain how to plant summer and fall crops in the following sections.
 
Two caveats apply:
 
✓ Brussels sprouts may be hard to mature as a fall crop in far northern 
areas, but they’re commonly grown in fall in most other areas of the 
country.

131
 Chapter 9: Cool Weather Staples
 
✓ If the weather gets too cold or too warm when cauliflower plants 
are forming heads, all you end up with are scraggly, small heads. 
Temperatures in the 70-degree range are ideal, so it’s best to avoid 
growing cauliflower when it will mature in the heat of summer. For 
that reason, many gardeners like to grow cauliflower only as a fall crop 
started in summer to mature in the cooler, autumn weather.
Planting summer cole crops
Even though you can direct seed most summer-maturing cole crops in spring — 
that is, plant the seed directly in the garden — it’s easier to get a jump on 
the season by starting the plants indoors 6 to 8 weeks before your last frost 
date (see the appendix for first and last frost dates in your area). Then you 
can plant the seedlings in your garden 2 to 4 weeks before that date. Spring-
planted summer-maturing cole crops can withstand a light frost, and planting 
them early gives them a jump-start on growing. After the plants have at least 
four leaves, cultivate around the plants to kill any weeds and mulch with 
hay or straw. (Check out Chapter 14 for information on battling weeds and 
Chapter 15 for mulching techniques.)
 
Here’s a rule-of-green-thumb when it comes to spacing cole crops, especially 
cabbage: The closer the plants are to one another, the smaller their heads 
will be (the appendix provides plant spacing guidelines). A dwarfed crop isn’t 
necessarily bad — you may want to produce smaller, more manageable heads 
of cabbage. So, instead of planting cabbages 12 to 24 inches apart, try 8 to 12 
inches. You’ll get smaller, more manageable heads.
Planting fall cole crops
For gardeners in all but the coldest areas, a fall-maturing crop of broccoli, 
Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower may be easier to manage than a 
similar summer-maturing crop. Fall weather provides the perfect tempera-
tures to mature cole crops to their sweetest flavor.
For fall cole crops, start seedlings indoors about 3 months before your first 
frost and then transplant the seedlings to the garden 1 month later. For 
example, if your first frost is November 1, you should start seeds indoors on 
August 1 and then transplant them in your garden on September 1. (Starting 
the seedlings indoors and letting them grow until they’re 3 to 4 weeks old 
helps them withstand the shock of being planted in the garden in summer.) 
To protect the young seedlings from the harsh summer sun, mulch them with 
hay or straw immediately after planting, and shade them — especially in the 
afternoon — with a shade cloth or floating row cover (a plastic or fabric mate-
rial that lets light through but insulates the plants). (Refer to Chapter 21 for 
information on row covers.)
In very mild-winter areas such as the U.S. West coast and the Gulf coast, try 
growing overwintering varieties of broccoli (varieties that can withstand cold 
temperatures better than other varieties and need a longer season to mature) 

132
Part II: Vegging Out 
such as ‘Purple Sprouting’, which I discuss earlier in the chapter. Planted in 
fall, such varieties slowly grow all winter and mature in spring.
Nurturing cole crops
Cole crops like full sun and well-drained soil that’s built into raised beds. 
Most importantly, though, cole crops really like fertile soil. A week or so 
before planting your seedlings, work a 3- to 4-inch layer of composted manure 
into the bed. About 1 month after you transplant your cole crop seedlings, 
apply about 3 to 4 pounds of an organic fertilizer, such as 5-5-5, to every 100 
square feet of garden. (Chapter 15 has more on fertilizing.) Keep the soil 
moist, and a week or so after transplanting, apply an organic mulch such as 
hay or straw. These types of mulches keep weeds at bay and keep the soil 
cool and moist — just how cole crops like it.
 
I stress the importance of cool weather for cole crops throughout this chap-
ter, but mild temperatures can be too cool for some cole crops. Even though 
mature cole crop plants can withstand temperatures into the 20s, young 
plants may not be so hardy. If broccoli plants are exposed to several days of 
40-degree temperatures when they’re still young, they can form flower heads 
prematurely when the weather warms (which is called buttoning). Cauliflower 
does the same thing when exposed to cold temperatures or other stresses, 
such as crowding, when young. In either case, you’re left with a small plant 
and head. To avoid this premature flowering, plant in summer for a fall crop or 
cover young spring-planted crops with a row cover to keep them warm.
 
With older cauliflower varieties, such as ‘Snow Crown’, you have to wrap the 
leaves over the head and tie them with twine, as shown in Figure 9-2. However, 
many newer varieties, such as ‘Fremont’, are self-blanching (the leaves natu-
rally grow to cover the head and avoid light) as well as disease resistant. 
However, even newer varieties benefit from careful inspection to ensure that 
the leaves are tightly covering the heads once they form.
Keep the plants well watered, weeded, and mulched so they grow steadily 
through the season. Side-dress cole crops with an organic fertilizer such as 
5-5-5 about 1 month after transplanting in the garden. (For more on side-
dressing, flip to Chapter 15.) Nurture your plants, and they’ll reward you with 
a bountiful harvest.

Putting a stop to pesky pest problems
 
In general, cole crops have only a few problems that home gardeners need to 
watch out for. Many modern hybrid varieties have added disease resistance, 
so choose these varieties if diseases are a problem in your garden. I discuss 
general vegetable diseases and pests, such as cutworms, aphids, nematodes, 
flea beetles, and mildews, in Chapter 17, but the following list warns you about 
some specific cole crop pests:
 
✓ Black rot: This bacterial disease is a problem particularly with cabbage 
and cauliflower. It causes the plant or head to rot before maturing. The 
telltale signs are a foul smell, a yellowing of the lower leaves, blackening 
of the leaf veins, and triangular yellow areas on the leaf edges. You can 
control this problem by rotating crops (planting other unrelated crops 
such as tomatoes, beans, or lettuce in that area for 3 years) and remov-
ing all old cole crop plant debris.
 
✓ Cabbage maggot: If plants are stunted, pull one up and look at the roots. 
If you see small, white larvae (maggots) feeding there, you probably 
have cabbage maggots. The adult fly lays eggs on the stems at the soil 
line and then when the eggs hatch, the larvae tunnel into the soil and 
start feeding on the roots. The maggots are especially dangerous to young 
seedlings. To control the cabbage maggot, place a floating row cover over 
the young seedlings. After the weather warms, remove the row cover.

134
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
✓ Club root: If your plants are stunted, pull one up and check the roots. 
If the roots are gnarled and disfigured, a fungus called club root may be 
to blame. To prevent this disease, rotate crops and raise the soil pH to 
7.2 by adding lime (see Chapter 14 for more on acceptable pH ranges for 
vegetables).
 
✓ Imported cabbageworm and cabbage looper: These two insects are the 
number-one problem with cole crops. The adult of the cabbageworm is 
a seemingly harmless white butterfly that lays single white eggs on the 
undersides of leaves. The eggs hatch, and then green caterpillars crawl 
out and begin to feed on the leaves. The adult of the cabbage looper is a 
gray-brown moth. These pests can quickly destroy your crop. As soon as 
you see signs of feeding — including the caterpillars or their dark green 
droppings — spray the crop with a biological control called Bacillus 
thuringiensis (Bt). Bt is an effective bacteria that attacks only the larvae of 
caterpillar family insects and is safe to other insects, animals, and humans.
Harvesting cole crops
If all goes well, cole crops should be ready to eat after a few months. However, 
be sure to check the days to maturity for the varieties you choose. In this 
section, I share some tips to help you get the best harvests.
Broccoli
Harvest broccoli by cutting the main head when the flower buds are still 
tightly clustered together without any signs of blossoming. Even if the head is 
smaller than you would like it to be, cut it now. After the yellow flowers open, 
the flavor turns bitter. If you leave a few inches of the main stem on the plant, 
many broccoli varieties respond by growing side branches that produce 
little heads (see Figure 9-3). Keep harvesting, and the broccoli keeps produc-
ing! When you harvest the side shoots, cut the shoot back to the main stem. 
Doing so creates fewer, but larger side shoots that are easier to use.
Brussels sprouts
Brussels sprouts taste best after cool weather helps turn some of their carbo-
hydrates into sugars. Following a frost, pick off the marble-sized sprouts from 
the bottom of the plant first, moving up the stalk. The more sprouts you pick 
from below, the larger the sprouts above will get. Pull off the lower leaves for 
easier picking.
 
To make the sprouts mature faster, snip off the top few inches of the plant 
once sprouts have formed on the bottom 12 inches of the stalk.

135
 Chapter 9: Cool Weather Staples
 
Figure 9-3: 
Side shoots

Because Brussels sprouts tolerate temperatures into the 20s, you can harvest 
right into New Year’s in some areas. I’ve picked frozen sprouts off plants for 
Christmas, and they tasted great. The flavor actually gets sweeter with cool 
temperatures! Just cook and eat them immediately; if you try to store them, 
they’ll rot.
Cabbage
Harvest cabbage heads when they’re firm when squeezed. By periodically 
squeezing your cabbages through the growing season, you’ll be able to tell 
when they’re firm. (Don’t worry — they won’t mind!) To harvest, cut the head 
from the base of the plant with a sharp knife. When harvesting early-maturing 
varieties in summer, don’t dig up the plants. Cabbages have the ability to 
grow smaller side heads on the plant after the main head is harvested; you 
harvest these side heads the same way that you do the main head.
 
Sometimes, cabbage heads split before you can harvest them. Splitting occurs 
when the plant takes up too much fertilizer or water, especially around har-
vest time. This “overdose” causes the inner leaves to grow faster than the 
outer leaves, splitting the heads. Harvest splitting heads as soon as possible. 
To stop splitting once it starts, grab the head and give it a one-half turn to 
break some of the roots. You also can root prune the plant by digging in a circle 
about 1 foot from the base of the cabbage. Both of these methods slow the 
uptake of water and fertilizer to preserve the head.

136
Part II: Vegging Out 
Cauliflower
When heads are between 6 and 12 inches in diameter and blanched white 
(for white varieties) or fully colored (for colored varieties), pull up the whole 
plant and cut off the head. Cauliflower, unlike cabbage and broccoli, won’t 
form side heads after the main head is cut.

A Salad for All Seasons: Lettuce, 
Spinach, Swiss Chard, 
and Specialty Greens
In This Chapter
▶ Leafing through lettuce, spinach, and Swiss chard varieties
▶ Joining the green revolution: dandelions and other unusual greens
▶ Caring for your green crops
I
f you’re a beginning gardener and have never grown a vegetable in your 
life before, try greens. You’ll find no easier group of vegetables to grow 
than greens. Unlike other vegetables that require weeks or even months of 
nurturing, greens are good things that come even to those who can’t wait. 
Because you don’t have to wait for flowering and fruiting to enjoy their green 
goodness, you can just pick the leaves at any stage, and — voilà! — you have 
dinner.
In many growing areas, you can have fresh greens year-round from your 
garden with just a little planning. Sure, it’s easy to buy a head of lettuce at 
the grocery store or farmer’s market, but the pure joy of running out to the 
garden in the evening and plucking a fresh head for dinner gives you a great 
sense of satisfaction while introducing you to unusual varieties and flavors 
not readily available from most supermarkets. Plus you don’t have to push a 
shopping cart with a bad wheel or break up any arguments in the cereal aisle 
just to gather basic salad ingredients.
And speaking of salad, for most people, lettuce and salad are synonymous. 
Lettuce is definitely the number-one green, but in this chapter, I also discuss 
two other major greens crops: spinach and Swiss chard. In addition, I talk 
about my favorite unusual wild greens, including dandelions and sorrel. (Flip 
to Chapter 11 for details on other unusual yet more mainstream types of 
greens, such as arugula, collards, and endive.)

138
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
Greens, by nature, are cool, moisture-loving crops. When the weather heats up 
to above 80 degrees Fahrenheit for several days in a row and the plant is 
mature enough, annual greens such as lettuce and spinach think the end is 
near and send up a seed stalk. This process is called bolting. Bolting doesn’t 
just mean getting out of the house quickly. It’s also a term used to describe a 
greens crop gone bad. During this process, the flavor of the greens quickly 
becomes bitter, so plan to plant and harvest your greens while the weather’s 
cool or else grow varieties that are tolerant of the heat. I provide guidelines for 
growing all types of greens at the end of this chapter.
Lettuce Get Together
Originally from the Mediterranean area, lettuce (Latuca sativa) was eaten at 
the tables of Persian kings in 550 B.C. and was once thought to be an aphrodi-
siac. I can’t attest to its aphrodisiacal qualities, but I do know that lettuce is 
considered the quintessential salad crop around the world.
The four basic types of lettuce — crisphead, loose-head, loose-leaf, and 
romaine lettuce (all shown in Figure 10-1) — offer a number of tasty varieties 
to delight the palate. The most common are green-colored leaf varieties, but 
you can grow many red- and burgundy-colored leaf varieties and those with 
a mixture of colors, too. Some varieties form solid heads, but others don’t. 
Varieties have smooth, frilly, or deeply cut leaves.
The following sections describe the four basic types of lettuce along with 
their days to maturity and some of my favorite varieties. They all are best 
in cool weather conditions, but some varieties can tolerate the heat. Just 
remember that lettuce can be eaten much younger, depending on your needs 
and appetite.
Crisphead lettuce
 
The crisphead group is most widely known as the “iceberg” lettuces, so named 
because when the lettuce was shipped from California (the main lettuce-growing 
region in the United States) to the East Coast in the early 1900s, mounds of ice 
were used to keep it cool and fresh.

Loose-head
‘Iceberg’ is the most widely known variety, but many other crispheads are 
just as tasty and easy to grow. This type of lettuce forms a solid head when 
mature, with white, crunchy, densely packed inner leaves. Crispheads tend 
to take at least 70 days to mature from seeding in the garden. Following are 
some popular varieties of crisphead lettuce:
 
✓ ‘Iceberg’: Famous in grocery stores across the country, these compact 
heads have tightly-packed smooth leaves and white hearts. They’re 
best when grown in cool conditions (below 70 degrees), because then 
they form solid heads. (Find tips for growing head lettuce in the section 
“Growing Great Greens,” later in this chapter.)
 
✓ ‘Nevada’: This French crisphead features upright, bright green ruffled 
leaves with a nutty flavor. These cool-weather plants resist tip burn, rot, 
and bolting.
 
✓ ‘Summertime’: So named for its ability to form solid heads in the heat 
of summer, ‘Summertime’ has green, frilly leaves and a crisp texture.

Part II: Vegging Out 
Romaine lettuce
 
Romaine was named by the Romans, who believed in the healthful properties 
of this type of lettuce. Emperor Caesar Augustus even built a statue in praise 
of romaine lettuce, so it’s no surprise that this is the type of lettuce featured 
in Caesar salad. The alternative name, “Cos,” comes from the Greek island of 
Kos, where it’s popular.
Romaine lettuce grows tall, upright, solid heads and long, thick green or red 
leaves with solid midribs (the middle vein of the leaf). This type of lettuce 
tends to take at least 70 days to mature from seeding and can withstand 
summer heat. It can be grown as a “cut and come again” type of lettuce. Here 
are a few common varieties:
 
✓ ‘Outredgeous’: Bright red, thick, glossy, ruffle-edged leaves form the red 
color best on this open-pollinated variety when grown in partly 
shaded areas.
 
✓ ‘Parris Island Cos’: This smooth, green-leafed, open-pollinated romaine 
lettuce has 10-inch-tall, thick, green leaves.
 
✓ ‘Rouge D’Hiver’: An old French heirloom with bronze-red smooth leaves 
and a buttery texture. It tolerates cold better than heat.
 
✓ ‘Winter Density’: This variety is a green smooth-leaf lettuce that’s actu-
ally a cross between a loose-head and a romaine-type lettuce. This 
8-inch-tall plant is both heat and cold tolerant.
Loose-head lettuce
Loose-head or Butterhead lettuce features dark or medium green leaves or red 
leaves and smooth, thick outer leaves folded around a loosely-formed, yellow-
to-white head. The heads of loose-head lettuce aren’t solid like a crisphead 
type, but they’re easier to grow, especially during the summer heat. This type 
matures starting at 60 days from seeding. Here are a few popular varieties:
 
✓ ‘Bibb’: ‘Bibb’ is an heirloom, dark green, smooth-leafed, loose-head 
lettuce that dates back to the 1800s.
 
✓ ‘Buttercrunch’: A bolt-resistant, open-pollinated, loose-head type, 
‘Buttercrunch’ has thick, juicy, ruffled leaves; it’s best grown as a 
summer crop.
 
✓ ‘Deer Tongue’: This heirloom, loose-head type lettuce with tongue-
shaped, smooth-edged, green leaves is slow to bolt, making it a good 
choice in warm weather. Kids are fascinated by this variety because of 
its unique shape and name.

141
 Chapter 10: A Salad for All Seasons
 
✓ ‘Four Seasons’ (Merveille des Quatre Saisons): This heirloom has beautiful 
deep burgundy, smooth-edged, puckered outer leaves covering a creamy 
green-leaved heart. The plants are compact and sweet.
 
✓ ‘Speckles’: An unusual Amish heirloom Bibb-type lettuce with red 
speckles on olive green, smooth-edged, slightly puckered leaves and a 
blanched green heart.
Loose-leaf lettuce
Loose-leaf lettuce doesn’t form a solid head and is best harvested by picking 
off the mature outer leaves, allowing new leaves to continue growing. This 
type is often cut and allowed to “come again” (I discuss this technique later 
in this chapter) to provide multiple crops of greens from one head. You can 
start harvesting this type about 45 days from seeding. Some popular varieties 
include the following:
 
✓ ‘Black Seeded Simpson’: This widely adapted variety is an heirloom 
lettuce with crinkled, light green leaves. ‘Simpson Elite’ is a more heat-
resistant strain of this classic variety.
 
✓ ‘New Red Fire’: This unusual, open-pollinated variety has extremely frilly, 
burgundy-red puckered leaves. It’s slow growing and disease resistant.
 
✓ ‘Red Salad Bowl’: This is a red version of the classic ‘Salad Bowl’. It’s a 
loose-leaf, open-pollinated lettuce that features frilly green leaves and 
a mild, tender taste. This attractive burgundy-red-leafed version grows 
and looks best in cooler weather.
 
✓ ‘Royal Oak Leaf’: An improved version of the old-fashioned oak leaf, 
the ‘Royal Oak Leaf’ is open-pollinated, has bigger, more defined, darker 
green, deeply cut leaves and is slower to bolt, making it better for warm-
weather growing.
Popeye’s Pal: Spinach
Spinach is a Middle Eastern vegetable that has been cultivated for centuries. 
The dark green leaves of spinach (Spinacia oleracea) are nutritious (just ask 
Popeye, Olive Oyl, and Brutus of comic book fame) and stronger tasting than 
lettuce. It’s one of the first crops many gardeners plant in spring. In fact, 
when the heat comes, spinach quickly bolts. However, if you love spinach 
and want to eat it throughout the summer, you can grow warm-weather spin-
ach look-a-like crops that produce all summer, such as New Zealand spinach 
(Tetragonia tetragonioides) and Malabar spinach (Basella rubra). Though not 
in the spinach family, they have a similar look and taste.

142
Part II: Vegging Out 
You can grow two different leaf types of spinach: savoy (crinkled) and smooth. 
Which is better is a matter of personal preference. The savoy-leaf types give 
you more leaf surface to hold that salad dressing, but the smooth-leaf types 
are easier to clean.
 
Unless otherwise noted, the varieties in the following sections mature in about 
30 to 45 days from a spring planting. As with lettuce (which I describe earlier 
in this chapter), you can always harvest the young, tender greens earlier if you 
just can’t wait.
Savoy spinach
The following are popular savoy-type (crinkled-leaf) spinach varieties:
 
✓ ‘Bloomsdale Long Standing’: This heirloom variety has thick-textured, 
glossy, crinkled, dark green leaves.
 
✓ ‘Melody’: This hybrid, All-America Selections winner (AAS; see Chapter 4 
for more) features large semi-savoy leaves and good disease resistance.
 
✓ ‘Tyee’: This hybrid, slightly savoy-type is a vigorous grower. It’s a 
personal favorite because it’s easy to grow and slow to bolt.
Smooth spinach and some 
spinachlike friends
Following are a few smooth spinach varieties and a couple of good look-and-
taste-alikes that are easy to grow:
 
✓ ‘Malabar Red Stem’: Although this plant isn’t botanically related to spin-
ach, its vining red stems produce spinachlike leaves all summer. This 
heat lover grows to 6 feet tall, so it must be trellised and grown like a 
pole bean (see Chapter 7 for details on growing beans). It can be used as 
a spinach substitute raw or cooked.
 
✓ ‘New Zealand’: This 1- to 2-foot-tall plant resembles spinach in looks and 
flavor, but it’s able to withstand summer heat. It can be cut repeatedly 
and still regrow, a method called cut and come again. I talk more about 
this method later in this chapter.
 
✓ ‘Oriental Giant’: This hybrid variety produces large, smooth, 12- to 
15-inch-long leaves and yields up to three times more foliage than other 
spinach varieties.

143
 Chapter 10: A Salad for All Seasons
 
✓ ‘Reddy’: This smooth-leafed hybrid spinach variety has red stalks and 
veins that contrast nicely with its deep green, arrow-shaped leaves.
 
✓ ‘Renegade’: This smooth-leafed hybrid spinach variety is faster growing 
and more disease resistant than the similar ‘Space’ variety.
The Attractive and Hardy Swiss Chard
Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris) has finally come of age. With the recent introduc-
tion of more colorful varieties, this green is now a top specialty treat in many 
gardens. (Even Aristotle wrote about the virtues of this lovely plant!) Swiss 
chard hails from southern Europe, where it grew up next to its close cousin, 
the beet. In fact, the only differences between the two vegetables are that 
chard (sometimes known as “spinach beet”) doesn’t have the bulbous root of 
the beet, and its greens are more tender and prolific.
I’ve grown Swiss chard for years because it has so many wonderful charac-
teristics: It’s easy to grow; doesn’t bolt like spinach; has a consistent flavor, 
even in the hot summer; and has leaves that keep producing until frost. I also 
grow chard for the gorgeous color of its midribs (the middle part of the leaf). 
Varieties such as ‘Rhubarb’ and ‘Bright Lights’ make this garden green a real 
showstopper.
 
The color of the midrib is evident even at a young stage, so picking them as 
baby greens still yields the attractive look. These colorful varieties look so 
beautiful I sometimes grow them as ornamentals in my flower garden.
The following varieties all mature between 50 and 60 days from direct seeding 
in the garden, but the baby greens can be harvested as early as 1 month after 
seeding:
 
✓ ‘Bright Lights’: This AAS-winning hybrid variety features a mix of plants 
with red, pink, yellow, gold, or orange midribs on leaves that taste as 
good as they look. These leaves have a milder texture than other chard 
varieties.
 
✓ ‘Bright Yellow’: This open-pollinated variety’s yellow midrib contrasts 
beautifully with the dark green leaves.
 
✓ ‘Fordhook Giant’: This open-pollinated variety features a thick, celery-
like midrib with large, dark green savoy (crinkled) leaves. It’s a heavy 
producer.
 
✓ ‘Rhubarb’: An heirloom, burgundy-red midrib variety with dark green 
leaves, this variety is a bit smaller than other chards, but it’s still tasty 
and good looking.

Going Wild with Specialty Greens
Salad has gone through a revolution in the past 20 years. At one time, salad 
meant simply lettuce, spinach, and maybe Swiss chard. No longer. With the 
growing interest in exotic Chinese and European greens, salad palettes have 
expanded to include many ethnic greens, including arugula and mizuna (see 
Chapter 11 for more on these particular greens). Folks are even becoming 
interested in greens previously thought to be weeds, such as sorrel and — 
the scourge of lawn lovers — dandelions.
Eating these wild greens isn’t a new idea; in fact, when I was a boy, my Italian 
grandmother picked wild dandelion greens in spring to be sautéed with garlic 
and olive oil. I don’t bother cultivating these greens in the garden; I just eat 
my lawn! It’s loaded with dandelions, sorrel, and plantain. Even my cultivated 
gardens have great annual weeds that I harvest young and mix in salads, 
including lamb’s quarters, chickweed, and pigweed. I’m not alone; such culi-
nary practices are being rediscovered and embraced as the interest in ethnic 
dishes grows.
 
For many wild greens, you can just go into your garden or lawn and munch 
away, but never eat greens from lawns treated with pesticides.
You have good reason to cultivate and enjoy unusual greens. In fact, many types 
aren’t considered weeds, and you actually can cultivate them in your garden. 
Many of these are very easy to grow (some can even withstand freezing 
Mixing it up with mesclun
Mesclun is a French term that means “mix-
ture.” It caught on in the 1990s as a way to 
enliven salads by mixing in various colored 
and flavored greens and has gone mainstream 
ever since. Mesclun isn’t actually an individual 
green but a mix of different greens. The flavors 
can be mild to piquant, depending on the ingre-
dients in the mix. You can purchase mild, savory, 
and spicy individual mesclun mixes to name a 
few. Traditional mesclun may include a blend 
of lettuces, endive, arugula, cress, dandelion, 
and mache. Today the list of possibilities has 
expanded to include herbs, kales, radishes, and 
Chinese greens such as mizuna and pac choi. 
You also can get mixtures of different colored 
and shaped lettuce varieties that offer a mild 
taste. And there are even microgreen mixtures 
(greens harvested when only 1 to 2 inches tall) 
that can be quickly grown and added to salads.
The key to any of these flavorful blends is to 
harvest the greens when they’re small and 
tender — while they’re still “baby” size. This 
usually is within 3 weeks of seeding. Because 
most of these greens are cold-weather toler-
ant, mesclun is usually the first green harvested 
from my garden in spring. The greens quickly 
regrow after cutting for a number of harvests. 
The greens taste great doused with a balsamic 
vinegar and olive oil dressing.

145
 Chapter 10: A Salad for All Seasons
temperatures), they’re more nutritious than traditional lettuce, and their flavors 
are unique and sometimes quite surprising.
 
Many of the most popular and more mainstream specialty greens like endive 
are discussed in Chapter 11. But if you’re curious about growing some of the 
wild ones, try a few of the eyebrow-raising varieties listed here. Most can be 
harvested starting about 1 month after direct seeding in the garden. (Seeding 
gives you better varieties and more control than just waiting for the weed to 
pop up.) You also can find many of these varieties commercially. Check out 
some of my favorites:
 
✓ Asian greens: This catch-all phrase refers to a number of different 
greens. I cover mizuna in Chapter 11, but here are some lesser-known 
types that are great eaten on their own or tossed into mesclun mixtures 
(see the nearby sidebar):
 
• ‘Tatsoi’ produces a tight rosette of mild-flavored leaves. It’s a cool-
season green.
 
• ‘Komatsuna’ has mild, fleshy, rounded dark green leaves with 
rounded stems. It tolerates heat well.
 
• ‘Shungiku’ is an edible chrysanthemum. The leaves are harvested 
when less than 8 inches tall and used in salads, sushi, and pickles. 
This variety likes cool weather.
 
✓ Miner’s lettuce (Claytonia perfoliata): Heart-shaped leaves encircle 
a white-flowered stem. This variety grows best in cool weather and 
regrows after harvesting. It’s good planted in fall as a winter salad green.
 
✓ Dandelion: Yes, you can plant the same dandelions that dad has spent 
years pulling out or mowing over. Harvest them young during cool weather 
in spring or fall — when the leaves are about 4 to 6 inches long — so the 
greens are only slightly bitter. Varieties from France and Italy, such as 
‘Ameliore’, grow taller and are easier to harvest.
 
✓ Mache (corn salad or lamb’s lettuce): This cool-weather-loving and 
cold-tolerant green features small, dark green, tender leaves in a rosette 
shape with a mild, nutty flavor. It’s often the first green to start growing. 
Some varieties to try include ‘Vit’ (especially good for cold and wet con-
ditions) and ‘d’Etamps’, which has large, rounded leaves.
 
✓ Mustard: These beautiful, 1- to 2-foot-tall, upright-growing, spicy greens 
grow best in cool weather and make a bold statement in the garden. 
They’re great used in salad mixes. The spicy-hot, raw flavor mellows 
when cooked. Some of the best varieties include ‘Green Wave’ (heav-
ily curled, spicy green leaves), ‘Red Giant’ (large, purple-tinted, mildly 
flavored leaves), and ‘Osaka Purple’ (red, mildly flavored leaves that are 
more compact than ’Red Giant’).

146
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
✓ Sorrel (Rumex sanguineus): The 8-inch-long, arrow-shaped greens 
start growing in early spring and continue until fall. They have a distinct, 
lemony flavor that’s great in salads and soups. This green perennializes 
(comes back each year on its own) and can grow in light shade. A beauti-
ful, red-tinged variety is ‘Red Veined’ sorrel.
 
✓ Vegetable amaranth: This is a variety of the ancient grain amaranth 
that’s harvested young for its oval-shaped, coleuslike leaves. The leaves 
may be all green, green-and-red colored, or all red, depending on the 
variety. These greens germinate best in warm weather.
Growing Great Greens
Fertile soil and consistent watering are essential to growing great greens. Given 
those two factors, greens have to be one of the easiest vegetables to grow. The 
biggest problem gardeners have with greens is too much success — in other 
words, an overabundant harvest that you can’t eat! The following sections offer 
tips for getting the most out of your greens.
Timing is everything: Determining 
when to plant your greens
In areas with mild summers and winters, such as the West Coast, greens are 
easy to grow year-round. For most other areas, spring and fall are the best 
times to grow greens.
Greens can be direct sown in the garden starting in spring and, in cool areas, 
planted throughout the summer until September. If you want to get a jump 
on the season, start seeds 4 to 6 weeks before the last frost date in your area 
(see the appendix for a listing of first and last frost dates) so they can be 
planted 2 to 3 weeks later.
Gardeners in mild winter areas such as Arizona, Texas, and Florida may 
prefer a winter crop of greens because the weather is more favorable. 
Summer is too hot to germinate the seeds and grow the traditional types of 
lettuce and greens. For a winter crop, sow seeds indoors in fall to be trans-
planted into the garden a month later.
 
If you don’t have the right climate for year-round growing but love fresh 
greens, here are some guidelines for growing your own salad 12 months of the 
year in spite of cold winters and hot summers:
 
✓ Choose the right varieties. To grow a winter greens crop in cold-winter 
areas (hardiness zone 5 or 6) without season extenders (see Chapter 21), 

147
 Chapter 10: A Salad for All Seasons
plant spinach, arugula, claytonia, mizuna, and winter lettuce varieties 
such as ‘Winter Density’. To grow greens through summer in warm areas 
(hardiness zone 7 and warmer) choose greens that like the heat, such as 
Malabar or New Zealand spinach.
 
✓ Time your planting. Start heat-loving greens in late spring so they mature 
during summer’s heat. For winter greens in the cold areas, start cold-
tolerant plants in fall so they mature to full size before the bitter cold 
weather of December. The greens don’t have to grow during the short 
winter days and cold temperatures — they just need to stay alive.
 
✓ Keep the soil fertile. Successive crops of greens will take nutrients out 
of the soil, so after every crop you remove, add a 2- to 3-inch layer of 
compost to the soil and work it in well.
 
✓ Protect the plants. During the summer heat, use shade cloth to block 
the afternoon sun. In the North, protect greens through the cold winter 
by growing them in cold frames (see Chapter 21 for cold frame designs).
 
Here are a couple of other tips for planting greens at the right time:
 
✓ Stagger your plantings to avoid producing too large a supply. I remem-
ber planting a 10-foot row of lettuce all at once, watching it germinate 
and grow, and feeling very smug about my success. My satisfaction evap-
orated when I was inundated a month later with lettuce, lettuce, and 
more lettuce. I got sick of eating salads for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, 
and most of my crop eventually bolted and tasted bitter. I learned my 
lesson that year.
 
 Planting small, 2-to-4-foot patches of greens every 2 weeks throughout 
the growing season, which is referred to as succession planting (see 
Chapter 16), is the best way to ensure a manageable supply of lettuce all 
summer long. In warm areas, you may want to skip planting in midsum-
mer because lettuce will bolt from the heat.
 
✓ Give crisphead lettuce the environment it needs to thrive. Growing 
great crisphead or iceberg lettuce can be a challenge for many gardeners. 
The problem is that crisphead lettuce likes cool temperatures (50 to 60 
degrees) throughout the growing season, especially when it’s trying to 
form a head. For northern and southern gardeners, fall planting is the 
key. In warm areas, start seeds indoors in September; then place the 
seedlings in the garden in October or November. In cooler climates, 
start seeds indoors in July to plant in the garden in August or September. 
Keep plants well watered and feed them every 3 weeks with fish emulsion 
(which I discuss later in this chapter). By the cool days of fall, your iceberg 
lettuce heads should form.

148
Part II: Vegging Out 
Putting your greens to bed
Greens are easiest grown in raised beds (see Chapter 3 for more on raised 
beds). The beds are flat and smooth on top with most of the rocks and debris 
removed. Raised beds drain water well, which greens love, and they’re easy 
to work. Instead of planting in a straight row (which is okay, by the way), you 
can broadcast the seeds over the top of the entire bed. This wide row planting 
technique is described in Chapter 13. By using the wide row planting technique, 
you get more greens per square foot sooner with less weeding and watering.
 
If you don’t have room for greens with all those other gorgeous vegetables 
growing, get creative about where you plant. Because greens plants are gener-
ally small and fast growing, you can tuck them in all kinds of empty patches 
in your garden. For example, you can plant greens in between newly planted 
tomato, broccoli, or cabbage seedlings; under a pole bean teepee; between 
rows of corn; or around carrots in the carrot patch. The greens mature and are 
harvested before the other plants get too large to shade them. In the carrot 
patch, harvesting the greens gives room for these root crops to enlarge and 
mature. In summer, after your crop of beans or peas is finished, yank out the 
exhausted plants and plant a quick crop of lettuce to harvest later in late 
summer or fall.
Adding nitrogen-rich fishy fertilizer
 
Greens have simple fertilizing needs. You eat the leaves. Leaves need nitrogen 
to grow. So the soil needs to be rich in nitrogen. Any questions? That being 
said, it’s important to remember balance in all things, including fertilizer in 
your lettuce patch. So applying an organic fertilizer, such as blood meal, that’s 
high in nitrogen is a good practice. (Chapter 15 provides more information 
on organic fertilizers.) I suggest working in a 3- to 4-inch layer of compost and 
applying soluble nitrogen fertilizer, such as fish emulsion, every few weeks. By 
doing so, your greens stay lush and mature quickly.
Thin and bare it: Thinning your greens
Whether you plant in straight rows or wide rows, greens need thinning. 
Generally, spinach and loose-leaf lettuces need 3 to 4 inches between plants; 
crisphead and romaine lettuce like 6 to 10 inches. Thinning isn’t critical if 
you’re harvesting your greens when small or “baby” size.
Thin the seedlings as soon as each plant has four leaves. (Don’t throw out 
those thinnings, though. They make great “baby” greens for salad.) After the 
plants are properly spaced, mulching with a 2- to 3-inch layer of hay or straw 

149
 Chapter 10: A Salad for All Seasons
is a good way to conserve vital moisture, prevent weeds, and keep the leaves 
clean of splashing soil after rain. (Check out Chapter 13 for more information 
on thinning seedlings.)
Watering to win the war against wilt
Keeping the soil consistently moist after planting is a good way to avoid a 
common complaint with lettuces: The seeds never came up.
 
Greens need moist soil to germinate. Once growing, the plants generally have 
small root systems, so they’re the first vegetable to wilt when the soil is too 
dry. Water deeply — 5 to 6 inches deep — and mulch to keep greens crisp. 
A simple way to water is to use soaker hoses or drip irrigation (Chapter 15 
describes watering techniques). To preserve moisture, especially if it’s hot, 
lay a floating row cover (a lightweight, cheesecloth-like material that lets air, 
water, and sunlight through and keep the bugs out) over the bed until the 
seedlings emerge.
Working out the bugs (and other 
common ailments)
Greens have some of the problems that plague other vegetables. Insects such 
as aphids and white flies and diseases such as white mold and viruses can 
quickly destroy a crop. Because greens tend to have shallow and relatively 
small root systems, they can succumb easily to damage. Slugs are a threat 
to young seedlings in moist areas such as the Pacific Northwest, and rabbits 
and woodchucks are critters that love greens anywhere. All these problems 
are covered in depth in Chapter 17, but remember that fertile, well-drained 
soil that’s kept moist and fertilized is usually your best bet against any prob-
lems with your greens crop. And don’t hesitate to yank out an insect-infested 
or animal-chewed crop: Greens grow and mature so quickly, it may be better 
to start over than to nurse a sick crop.
 
Here are a few specific problems that plague greens:
 
✓ Bottom rot: This condition, caused by a fungus, makes lettuce (especially 
head lettuce) wilt and rot before maturing. It’s mostly seen in poorly 
drained soil during wet conditions. To avoid this problem, rotate crops, 
keep your soil well drained, and grow lettuce in raised beds.
 
✓ Spinach leaf miner: This small fly lays eggs on spinach and Swiss chard 
leaves. The eggs hatch, and the tiny larvae tunnel in between the leaf 
layers. Pick off and destroy tunneled leaves, and cover the crop with a 
floating row cover after germination to prevent damage.

150
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
✓ Tip burn: Tip burn causes the leaves of head lettuce to turn brown at the 
edges. This condition is seen during hot weather when soil moisture tends 
to fluctuate, creating a calcium deficiency in plants. Don’t bother adding 
calcium to the soil, but do pick off burned leaves, choose varieties that 
resist tip burn, and keep the soil evenly moist to control this problem.
Your bowl runneth over: Harvesting greens
Harvesting greens couldn’t be easier. After all, you eat the leaves. Except for 
crisphead lettuces, harvest greens while they’re young and tender to avoid a 
common complaint of lettuce growers: bitter-tasting lettuce. Bitter taste usu-
ally develops in older plants, so start picking when the leaves are 4 inches 
long. Harvest the outer leaves first to allow the inner leaves to continue to 
develop. Also, wait until you’re almost ready to prepare your meal to harvest. 
That way, the greens will be fresh and crisp in your salad bowl.
Some lettuces, such as loose-leaf varieties and Swiss chard, are examples of 
“cut and come again” greens (see Figure 10-2). You can cut these greens at 
the ground level — they’ll sprout new leaves from their bases — or you can 
just harvest the mature leaves, leaving the immature leaves to continue grow-
ing. Cutting the leaves at ground level is a great alternative to replanting, and 
you can cut the plants up to four times.
 
Crisphead or iceberg lettuce can be harvested young, before heads form. 
However, to get the solid, blanched heads seen in grocery stores, wait until full 
maturity when heads are firm when squeezed.

Sweet Corn and an A to T 
of Other Worthy Veggies
In This Chapter
▶ Planting, growing, and harvesting corn and its relatives
▶ Adding variety to your plot and your plate by planting some unusual vegetables
T
he preceding seven chapters cover the most popular and widely grown 
vegetables. But part of the fun of vegetable gardening is trying new and 
unusual crops. These “experiments” can be as commonplace as corn or as 
exotic as mizuna.
This chapter starts with one of the most popular vegetables of summer: corn. 
Corn isn’t related to any of the vegetables mentioned in Chapters 4 through 10, 
so I give it a special place in this chapter. Although corn is as traditional as apple 
pie, any vegetable that’s closely related to lawn grass has some unique qualities!
In this chapter, I also include an alphabetical listing of other fun and unusual 
vegetables to help you decide which ones to try and how to grow them. Each 
listing provides a description of the vegetable, a list of sample varieties to 
look for, and some basic growing tips. (Note: The planting times for each of 
these vegetables depend on the weather in your area. Refer to seed packages 
for planting times. See the appendix for information about hardiness zones 
and first and last frost dates.)
As a bonus, I include cooking tips with many of the vegetables. Like my mom 
used to say, “You’ll never know if you like it unless you try it.” Happy gardening, 
and bon appétit!
Sweet Corn and Its Relatives
Corn (Zea mays) has a reputation of being grown only in large fields, but you 
also can grow a great crop of corn in a small garden in your backyard. The 
satisfaction of harvesting your own fresh-picked corn and steaming it for 

152
Part II: Vegging Out 
dinner is one of the joys of summer. In the following sections, I discuss sweet 
corn along with popcorn.
Sweet corn
If all you’ve ever eaten is sweet corn from the supermarket, you’re missing 
one of summer’s true delights. Fresh-picked, steamed sweet corn has a sweet 
flavor that brings a smile to old and young faces alike. You also can roast 
corn on an open fire or grill to give it a woodsy flavor.
 
By selecting the right varieties to grow, you can have sweet corn maturing all 
summer long. And you don’t need a 10-acre field to grow it. Five to six short 
rows are all you need to get plenty of ears for your family.
Varieties
The kernels of the sweet corn plant are actually seeds. Most sweet corn 
varieties come with white, yellow, or bicolor (yellow and white mixed) kernels. 
Some heirloom varieties that are mostly used for corn flour and roasting 
feature red and blue kernels, which is where the red- and blue-colored corn 
tortilla chips come from. The color of corn that you choose depends on what 
flavor you like and what varieties grow well where you live. Varieties mature 
in 65 to 100 days, so choose a sampling that will mature over time in your 
garden. Gardeners in cold climates should stick with quick-maturing varieties, 
such as ‘Quickie’ and ‘Early Sunglow’.
As with many vegetables, corn has open-pollinated heirloom varieties as well 
as many modern hybrids (see Chapter 3 for more about open pollination and 
hybrids). The following two newer hybrid groups, which hold their sweetness 
and tenderness, are now commonly found in grocery stores, and their seeds 
are available in garden centers and seed catalogs:
 
✓ Sugar-enhanced (se) varieties have a special gene in their makeup that 
increases the tenderness and sweetness of the ears.
 
✓ Supersweet (sh2) varieties have a gene bred into the variety that makes 
the ears even sweeter than sugar-enhanced, and they can be stored for a 
week in the refrigerator without losing their sweetness. However, many 
feel that what supersweets gain in sweetness, they lose in “real corn” 
flavor.
 
Even though these newer, sweeter varieties are a bit more finicky about growing, 
especially the sh2 varieties, they do allow you to eat your corn over time 
without worrying about it getting starchy. Still, for best flavor, eat your sweet 
corn as soon as possible after harvest.

153
 Chapter 11: Sweet Corn and an A to T of Other Worthy Veggies
Following are some sweet corn varieties you may want to try:
 
✓ Some standard heirloom yellow varieties to grow are ‘Golden Bantam’ 
and ‘Ashworth’. White-kerneled standard heirloom varieties include 
‘Country Gentleman’ and ‘Stowell’s Evergreen’. One uniquely colored 
heirloom variety is ‘Black Aztec’ (black).
 
✓ A few standard sugary hybrids include ‘Early Sunglow’ (yellow), ‘Honey 
and Cream’ (bicolor), and ‘Silver Queen’ (white).
 
✓ If you’re interested in sugar-enhanced varieties, try ‘Quickie’ (bicolor), 
‘Sugar Buns’ (yellow), ‘Sugar Pearl’ (white), and ‘Ruby Queen’ (red).
 
✓ For some good supersweet varieties, grow ‘Early Xtra Sweet’ (yellow), 
‘Honey N’ Pearl’ (bicolor), and ‘Xtra Tender’ (white).
Whew, that’s a lot of choices! This list is actually only the tip of the iceberg, 
so don’t be afraid to try other varieties to see which grow best in your area.
Growing guidelines
Sweet corn is a warm-weather crop, so don’t rush to plant it. The soil 
temperature should be at least 65 degrees Fahrenheit for the best germination.
 
You may notice that some companies coat their seeds with a brightly colored 
fungicide to prevent rotting while the seed germinates — rotting during 
germination is a big problem in wet, cool weather with heavy clay soil. 
If you’re a strict organic gardener, select corn from companies that sell 
untreated or organic seed. You also can plant in slightly raised beds to hasten 
the soil in drying out and the seeds in germinating. (See Chapter 14 for more 
on raised beds.)
Corn is in the grass family, so, like your lawn, it needs plenty of nitrogen 
fertilizer to grow best. Before planting, amend the soil with composted 
manure, and then side-dress the patch with a 5-5-5 fertilizer when the plants 
are knee-high and again when silks (fine hairs on the ears) appear.
Corn was traditionally planted in hills following the Native American 
technique, but for the best production, plant corn in groups of short rows 
called blocks. Blocks consist of at least four straight rows of corn about 10 
to 20 feet long. Rows should be 2 feet apart, with walkways 2 to 4 feet wide 
between blocks so you can easily harvest. Plant the seeds 6 inches apart in a 
full-sun location in 2-inch-deep furrows. After germination, thin the plants to 
12 inches apart.

154
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
Each corn kernel needs to be pollinated by pollen from the tassel (the 
antennae-like flower at the top of the corn plant). If corn plants are grouped 
together, the wind blows the pollen down to the silks on the ears, and the 
pollen moves along the silks to pollinate the kernels. If you plant only one or 
two long rows, chances are some kernels won’t get pollinated, and your ears 
will look like mouths that are missing a few teeth. Plant only one variety in 
each block to ensure that the tassels drop pollen when the silks are ready. If 
you mix varieties within a block, you may not get proper pollination, because 
the pollen may drop when the ears aren’t ready. You can stagger the planting 
dates of your varieties by 2 weeks or plant other blocks of early-, mid, or 
late-season varieties to extend the harvest season.
 
Don’t plant supersweet varieties within 250 feet of any other corn variety. If 
non-supersweet pollen pollinates the corn, the supersweet corn will lose its 
extra sweetness.
When the corn plants are about 8 inches tall, hill them (mounding soil up to 
the lower leaves) to help kill weeds and reduce the likelihood of the tall stalks 
blowing over when older. (You can see this technique illustrated in Chapter 
6.) Keep the corn well-watered, and watch for leaf-yellowing. Yellowing leaves 
are a sign of nitrogen deficiency, so you should add more nitrogen fertilizer, 
such as fish emulsion or blood meal, to correct it.
When the husks are bright green and the silks turn brown, your ears are 
ready to check. Feel the ears to ensure they’re filled to the tips; you can even 
pull back the husk at the tip to check the kernels. If you can pinch the kernels 
and the juice is a milky color, the ear is ready to pick. For the best flavor, 
right after picking, remove the leaves and the silks and steam or boil the corn 
in water for about 5 minutes (for the whole pot); then chomp away for a true 
taste of summer.
 
Corn is notorious for attracting certain pests. Caterpillars such as the corn 
earworm and corn borer can devastate a patch, and animals such as raccoons 
and birds love sweet corn. Check Chapter 17 for tips on thwarting insects and 
animals that thrive in the corn patch.
Popcorn
 Popcorn is an educational and tasty vegetable to grow. Sure it’s easier to go 
to the local store and buy popcorn seed (kernels), but with unusual varieties 
and the opportunity to show your kids where popcorn really comes from, I 
think it’s worth growing. If you can grow sweet corn, you can grow popcorn. 
Newer varieties have unusual-colored kernels that are good in crafts as well as 
in your tummy. However, they all still pop into white kernels. Some varieties 
to try are ‘Robust 128YH’, ‘Tom Thumb’, and ‘Japanese Hulless’. All are 4- to 
8-feet tall and need 85 to 120 days to mature.

155
 Chapter 11: Sweet Corn and an A to T of Other Worthy Veggies
The only difference between growing sweet corn and popcorn occurs at 
harvest time. Leave popcorn ears on the stalk until the stalks and husks are 
brown and dry. Before the first frost, harvest and strip away the husks. Hang 
the ears in mesh bags in a warm, airy, indoor location to continue drying for 
4 to 6 weeks. Twist the kernels off the cob and store them in glass jars. You 
can do a sample pop to see if they’re dry enough. You pop them as you would 
store-bought corn — but home-grown popcorn has a fresher taste. Your kids 
will never look at movie popcorn the same way.
A Variety of Other Great Vegetables
Whether you’re interested in the tame or the exotic, the following sections 
give you information for growing a cornucopia of other great vegetables in 
your garden.
Arugula
Arugula (Eruca vesicaria) is also known as roquette or rocket salad. It’s one of 
the main greens found in mesclun mixes (refer to Chapter 10 for more about 
mesclun). Arugula is one of the easiest, most cold-tolerant, and quickest-to-
mature greens you can grow. The plant is small, with an open habit (it doesn’t 
form a head-like lettuce), and its dark green leaves have a slight peppery and 
nutty flavor. Arugula adds an interesting zip to everyday salads and is a nice 
addition to soups and stir-fries.
Most gardeners buy arugula without a named variety. However, with its 
increased popularity, a number of named varieties are now available. ‘Astro’ 
is an early, heat-tolerant selection. ‘Sylvetta’, or wild arugula, is slower 
growing with smaller, more pungent leaves.
Arugula, like most greens, grows best in cool weather. When growing it, follow 
the guidelines for growing greens in Chapter 10. In mild-winter climates, you 
can plant arugula seeds in fall, winter, and spring. In cold-winter climates, 
start arugula in spring as soon as you can work the soil; take the summer off 
and then begin sowing again in fall. Arugula will overwinter in a cold frame 
very well — even in cold climates. (See Chapter 21 for more on cold frames.)
Seed small patches every 2 weeks, and in 30 to 40 days, you can harvest the 
4- to 6-inch-long leaves. In the heat, arugula quickly bolts (forms a flower 
head with bitter leaves), but you can eat the flowers if you like a strong, 
peppery flavor. The only major pest to bother arugula is the flea beetle. Flip 
to Chapter 17 for tips on controlling this insect.

156
Part II: Vegging Out 
Asparagus
One of the joys of spring is picking fresh asparagus (Asparagus officinalis) 
spears from the garden. I give you the scoop on varieties and growing 
guidelines in the following sections.
 
Unlike most of the vegetables mentioned in this book, asparagus is a perennial 
plant: It comes back year after year from the crown (the short stem near the 
roots) and the roots. In fact, the crown actually expands with age, producing 
more spears each year. After the spring harvest, let the spears grow into 
towering ferns that feed the roots for next year’s crop.
Varieties
Asparagus has male and female plants. Female plants produce spears that 
eventually grow to produce flowers and seeds that not only take extra energy 
to produce, reducing spear production, but also sow seeds that create a 
jungle of little asparagus plants. Unfortunately, these young seedlings aren’t 
productive and are mostly just weeds. Male plants don’t have flowers and 
seeds and are therefore more productive than the female plants.
 
Older varieties of asparagus such as ‘Martha Washington’, which has both 
male and female spears, were the standards for years. In the past 20 years, 
breeders have developed new varieties that are more productive and better 
adapted to tough soil conditions. Many of these varieties are in the “Jersey” 
series from a breeding program in New Jersey. These are touted as all-male 
varieties even though they may have a few female plants mixed in. These male 
varieties are superior for production and growth:
 
✓ ‘Jersey Giant’ is one of the first Jersey introductions. It’s well adapted to 
most gardens, but it thrives in cool-temperature locations. It’s disease 
resistant and frost tolerant.
 
✓ ‘Jersey Knight’ has high-quality spears produced on disease-resistant 
plants. It’s particularly well adapted to growing in heavy soils.
 
✓ ‘Jersey Supreme’ is a new variety that matures earlier than the other 
Jersey series varieties. It’s also higher yielding and has fewer female 
plants.
For a little extra color, try ‘Purple Passion’. This variety produces 
sweet-tasting purple spears that turn green when cooked. For California and 
warm-weather gardeners, the University of California has a variety called ‘UC 
157’ that was born and raised in warm soils and performs very well.

157
 Chapter 11: Sweet Corn and an A to T of Other Worthy Veggies
Growing guidelines
 
Asparagus crowns are generally available for purchase in late winter and 
spring at garden centers or through the mail. Because asparagus is a perennial, 
you need to pay particular attention to it when planting and take special care 
when preparing the planting site. You’ll find it easier to amend the soil before 
planting rather than trying to alter it after you plant the crowns. To ensure 
planting success, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose a location with full sun, and then pay special attention to 
removing all the weeds.
 
2. Dig a trench that’s 1 foot deep and as long as you like.
 
3. Backfill the trench with 6 to 8 inches of finished compost and soil 
mixed together.
 
4. Using the added compost form volcano-like mounds (4 to 6 inches 
high) every 18 inches and lay the spiderlike crowns and roots of the 
asparagus on top of the mounds so the roots drape over the sides of 
the mounds and the crowns sit on top (see Figure 11-1).
 
5. Cover the crowns with soil and periodically backfill the trench as the 
asparagus spears grow, until the crowns are about 3 inches below the 
soil surface.
 
Figure 11-1: 
Plant your 
asparagus 
crowns in 
trenches.
 

158
Part II: Vegging Out 
Keep the bed well watered, and fertilize each year with manure or a complete 
organic fertilizer such as 5-5-5 after harvest each year. Because asparagus is a 
perennial, you start harvesting in spring when the spears emerge and stop 6 
to 8 weeks later. Here’s how to handle the harvest in the first couple of years:
 
✓ The first year: Let all the spears grow into ferns.
 
✓ The second year: Harvest only those spears whose diameters are larger 
than a pencil; your harvest window is about 2 weeks in the spring. Snap 
off the spears by hand at the soil line when they’re 6 to 8 inches tall.
 
✓ The third year: Begin harvesting only the pencil-diameter-sized spears 
for 4 to 6 weeks each spring. Stop after that and let the spears grow into 
ferns to replenish the crown and roots.
The ferns may be cut down after a hard frost in fall or winter. Weeds are 
the number-one downfall of most asparagus beds. If you keep the beds well 
weeded each year and use a light mulch, you’ll lessen the chances of disease 
and insects reducing your yields.
 
If you’ve ever been served white asparagus tips in a restaurant and loved the 
flavor, you can easily grow your own. All you need to do is blanch the spears 
(block light from the plant, stopping chlorophyll from forming and leaving that 
part of the plant white) by covering the bed with black plastic after the spears 
begin to break ground. Check them every day or so and harvest as usual. The 
blanched spears are more tender and have a milder flavor.
Beets
Beets (Beta vulgaris) are best known for their deep-red-colored roots and 
sweet flavor. However, their leaves (called greens) also are very tasty and can 
be used as a substitute for Swiss chard or spinach (see Chapter 10 for more 
about these greens). Try slicing beet roots or greens in salads or cooking the 
roots in classic beet dishes such as borscht (beet soup). In the following 
sections, I describe different beet varieties to try and provide pointers on 
growing beets.
Varieties
Beets tend to mature about 50 to 65 days from seeding. Some good varieties 
to try are ‘Red Ace’, ‘Detroit Dark Red’, and ‘Lutz Green Leaf’. For a long, thin, 
red root, try ‘Cylindra’ or ‘Forono’. These varieties are consistent producers 
and widely adapted to various growing conditions.
If you’re interested in beets of different colors, try growing white-fleshed 
‘Blankoma’, which is very sweet. Or try yellow-fleshed ‘Touchstone Gold’ or 
red-and-white-striped ‘Chioggia’, which are sweet, too, but are mostly grown 
for their looks.

159
 Chapter 11: Sweet Corn and an A to T of Other Worthy Veggies
If you’re mostly interested in beet greens, try ‘Bull’s Blood’. The blood-red 
leaves produce a baby beet. This variety is great in salads and beautiful in 
the garden.
Growing guidelines
Beets grow best in cool, moist conditions. Two weeks before the average date 
of your last frost, prepare a raised bed by working in a 2- to 3-inch layer of 
composted manure. Then sow seeds 
1⁄2 inch deep and 2 inches apart. (Even 
though you eventually thin them to 4 inches apart, it’s better to plant close in 
case the seeds don’t geminate uniformly.) Cover the seeds with soil, and keep 
them well watered. Plant seeds again every 2 weeks into summer to ensure 
a continual supply of beets. (See Chapter 16 for more on this succession 
planting technique.)
 
Beet seeds are actually tiny dried up fruits with many seeds inside. For this 
reason, one seed produces many plants. These plants really need to be 
thinned early. After the seedlings stand 2 to 3 inches tall, thin them to 2 inches 
apart; thin the seedlings to 4 inches apart a month later. Because many beet 
plants grow in the same area, try snipping off the seedlings that you don’t 
want with scissors instead of pulling them out and disturbing the roots. Use 
the thinned greens in salad mixes to add color and flavor. (Chapter 13 
provides more information on thinning seedlings.)
 
Thinning root crops is essential if you want the roots to grow into beets, 
carrots, onions . . . whatever. If they don’t have adequate space, you’ll get a 
small vegetable or no vegetable forming in the roots.
Harvest the roots when they’re golf-ball sized and the most tender. To see 
whether the beet is large enough to harvest, brush the soil off around the 
beet root; beets grow right at the surface of the soil, so it’s easy to see the 
tops of the roots. But make sure you leave some beets, especially the ‘Lutz 
Green Leaf’ variety, to experience the cool weather that produces the 
sweetest fruits.
Broccoli raab
Broccoli raab is one vegetable that I had to include in this book. My mother 
loves it, and of course she’s going to read this book, so I better write about 
it. Actually I love broccoli raab, too, not only for its quick and easy growing 
habit but also for the mustardy, broccoli taste of the greens. Unlike regular 
broccoli, you can eat the whole shoot of broccoli raab (Brassica rapa): stems, 
leaves, head, and all. It matures in about 40 days, so you can grow many 
crops throughout the year. If you still aren’t convinced about growing and 
eating broccoli raab, come visit my momma, and we’ll sit down to a plate of 
cavatelli and broccoli raab.

160
Part II: Vegging Out 
Varieties of broccoli raab come in two forms: spring raab and fall raab. 
‘Spring Raab’ is a good spring and summer variety producing large plants 
that are slow to bolt. ‘Sessantina Grossa’ is a good fall variety with thick, 
tender shoots and fat buds. Choose the variety that corresponds to your 
planting season.
Like broccoli, broccoli raab grows best in cool weather. In mild-winter areas, 
you can plant it in fall, winter, and spring. In cold-winter areas, plant in spring 
and fall. Plant every few weeks to ensure a continuous supply of these tasty 
greens. Direct seed broccoli raab in the garden and grow it as you would 
broccoli (see Chapter 9). Just before the small head containing flower buds 
opens, clip the whole plant and sauté away.
Celeriac
If you like the flavor of celery but have a difficult time growing it, try celery’s 
cousin, celeriac (Apium graveolens). Instead of growing an edible stem, celeriac 
grows a large, round, white-fleshed root. Once harvested, cleaned, and 
peeled, it reveals a creamy-white flesh with pure celery flavor. Celeriac tastes 
great in soups, stir-fries, and salads. Some of the newer varieties that produce 
consistently good-sized roots include ‘Brilliant’ and ‘Diamant’.
Celeriac likes cool weather and needs a long growing season (100+ days) to 
mature. In cold-winter climates, start seeds indoors 8 to 12 weeks before your 
last frost date. In mild-winter climates, start seeds in early summer indoors, 
and then transplant the seedlings in late summer. Plant the seedlings 8 inches 
apart in raised beds, and amend the soil with plenty of compost. Keep the 
plants mulched with hay or straw and water them well, especially during hot 
spells. When the roots are about 2 to 3 inches in diameter, you can start 
harvesting. Pull the whole plant, discard the tops, and peel and chop the root.
 
The roots develop the best flavor when they’re left in the garden until after a 
few frosts.
Celery
Celery (Apium graveolens), although found in so many dishes, is rarely grown 
by home gardeners. It can be a challenge to grow because the young plants 
can die easily and the stems often get stringy. However, growing celery can 
be very rewarding. You can use the leaves and stalks in soups or in raw veg-
etable dips. If you’re growing celery for leaves and stalks, you usually won’t 
get the seeds. Check out some celery varieties and growing guidelines in the 
following sections.

161
 Chapter 11: Sweet Corn and an A to T of Other Worthy Veggies
Varieties
Like celeriac, celery needs a long-growing season (120+ days). For some widely 
adapted varieties of celery, try ‘Ventura’, ‘Utah 52-70 Improved’, and ‘Tango’.
For a uniquely colored type, try ‘Golden Self-Blanching’ or ‘Giant Red 
Reselection’. These varieties produce either golden-yellow or red-colored 
stalks. Their flavor is more distinct than other varieties, but they aren’t as 
mild as fully blanched varieties. These varieties make a great color addition 
to salads.
 
There’s also a type of celery called “cutting celery” (Apium graveolens) that’s 
grown for its leaves rather than its stems. This celery isn’t common, but it’s 
easier to grow than regular celery.
Growing guidelines
Celery grows best in areas with moderate summers or winters — it doesn’t 
like extremes of heat or cold. Start celery seed indoors in winter in cold-
winter areas and indoors in midsummer in mild-winter areas. Transplant the 
seedlings outdoors when they’re 3 inches tall (about 10 weeks after seeding 
indoors), spacing them 6 inches apart.
Celery requires fertile soil and a constant water supply. Apply plenty of 
compost or a complete organic fertilizer, such as 5-5-5, at planting, and mulch 
the plants well. Side-dress bimonthly with the same fertilizers to ensure 
good-sized stalks (see Chapter 15 for more on side-dressing).
If temperatures get too cold (below 55 degrees) or too warm (above 80 
degrees) for weeks, celery will suffer, causing the stalks to become tough and 
stringy. After 3 months or so, begin harvesting your celery stalks, either by 
pulling up the entire plant or just selecting outer stalks.
 
Gardeners may not know that the white stalks of celery are blanched. Home-
grown, unblanched celery has a stronger flavor and better nutritional value 
than store-bought types, but if you like the white stalks, it’s easy to blanch 
your celery, too. To blanch, place an empty metal can or milk carton with the 
ends removed over the stalks 10 days before harvesting. You don’t need to 
cover the leaves.
Chinese cabbage
Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa) combines the best of two worlds. It blends 
the mild, mustardy flavor of cabbage (see Chapter 9) with the texture of let-
tuce (see Chapter 10). Chinese cabbage tastes great in stir-fries, Asian soups, 

162
Part II: Vegging Out 
sukiyakis, and salads. It likes cool temperatures and is best grown as a fall or 
winter crop. Because it takes only 40 to 55 days to mature, it’s easy to get a 
good crop of Chinese cabbage from your fall garden.
Chinese cabbage falls into two categories: heading and non-heading. The 
heading types can be tall and torpedo-shaped and called “Michihli,” or 
they can be short and barrel-shaped and called “Napa.” Some good Chinese 
cabbage varieties that mature in about 45 days include ‘Jade Pagoda’ and 
‘Monument’ (which are both Michihli type) and ‘Minuet’ and ‘China Express’ 
(which are Napa type). (I discuss the non-heading types, known as pac choi, 
later in this chapter.)
In cold-winter areas, Chinese cabbage seed of the heading type is best sown 
indoors in spring for an early summer harvest or indoors in late summer for 
an early fall harvest. In warm-winter areas, sow the seed in late summer for a 
fall harvest. Transplant 6-week-old seedlings so they’re spaced 1 foot apart, 
and fertilize them every 3 weeks with a complete fertilizer, such as 5-5-5. 
Mulch with hay or straw to keep the soil cool and moist. Start harvesting 
when the plants are 10 inches tall.
 
The biggest pest of heading-type Chinese cabbage is the flea beetle. You can 
read up on controlling these insects in Chapter 17.
Collards
Collards (Brassica oleracea) are an ancient cabbage-family crop that’s a 
stalwart in many Southern gardens. Unlike cabbages, they don’t form heads 
and can withstand heat and still grow well. The whole plant can be eaten 
at any stage, and the large, smooth oval leaves, in particular, taste great 
steamed or mixed in soups. Healthwise, they’re one of the best greens you 
can eat; they’re high in vitamin A, iron, and calcium. Some good varieties for 
production and vigor include ‘Champion’, ‘Georgia’, and ‘Flash’.
Collards like cool weather and mature quickly within 60 to 80 days after 
seeding. Sow seeds directly in the garden 4 to 6 weeks before the last frost 
date for a spring harvest, and again in mid to late summer for a fall harvest. 
Thin the seedlings to 10 inches apart. Use the thinnings in soups and casseroles. 
Fertilize, water, and mulch collards as you would cabbage, which I discuss in 
detail in Chapter 9.
Endive
Endive (Cichorium endivia), a French cool-season green from the chicory 
family, has a reputation for being bitter, but if you grow it yourself, the flavor 
is mild, and the texture is crunchy. Endive is distinguished from its sister 

163
 Chapter 11: Sweet Corn and an A to T of Other Worthy Veggies
escarole (discussed in the following section) by its deeply cut and curled 
leaves. Both mature in 45 to 55 days. You’ll find endive in many mesclun seed 
mixes (see Chapter 10 for more on mesclun) and blended with lettuce at 
restaurant salad bars. Some varieties to try are ‘Rhodos’, ‘Galia’, and ‘Neos’.
 
Growing endive is similar to growing lettuce, and endive matures in the same 
time frame (see Chapter 10). As an added benefit, if you let the heads become 
large, the centers naturally blanch, resulting in tender, mild-flavored, creamy-
white leaves. If the weather is heating up, harvest the greens young (when 
they’re about 6 inches in diameter) before the flavor becomes bitter and the 
texture becomes tough.
Escarole
Escarole (Cichorium endivia) is endive’s sister, with the only true distinguishing 
feature being the larger heads with broad, thin, smooth leaves of the escarole. 
It’s grown like endive and has the same uses, but it’s sweeter and crunchier 
than endive. Some Italian cooks, like my mom, use escarole in soups, creating 
a flavorful, sweet, and slightly bitter broth. Escarole also can be blanched by 
covering the leaves 5 days before harvest to create an even milder flavor and 
texture. Escarole matures in 45 to 50 days. A good variety to look for is ‘Full 
Heart Batavian’. For growing instructions, see the previous section on endive.
Florence fennel
Florence fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) produces a bulging area at the stem 
near the soil line called a bulb (technically it isn’t a bulb but an enlarged 
stem). There’s also a leaf-type herb called sweet fennel that’s grown for its 
ferny leaves and doesn’t produce a bulb. If you like anise flavor, you’ll love 
fennel.
This cool-season crop produces bulbs 80 days after sowing and can be grown 
as a spring or fall crop. The crunchy bulbs are great sliced in salads, marinated 
in oil and balsamic vinegar, grilled, or just eaten raw. (My fennel crop never 
makes it into the house because my daughter Elena likes to pick and eat it 
while wandering around the yard.)
 
Even though Florence fennel is grown mostly for its bulbs, you also can use 
its ferny leaves to add a licorice flavor to salads and casseroles. If you let the 
plant bolt, the flowers that form produce anise-flavored fennel seeds; you can 
then eat or cook with these great-tasting seeds. The flower heads also are 
beautiful in the garden and attract beneficial insects that can protect your 
plants from pests (more on that in Chapter 17). The best varieties are the 
newer ones, which are slower to bolt in the heat and more productive. ‘Orion’, 
‘Perfection’, and ‘Zefa Fino’ are good choices.

164
Part II: Vegging Out 
Fennel likes cool weather to mature the largest and sweetest-tasting bulbs. 
Prepare the soil, fertilize, and water as you would for lettuce (see Chapter 
10). Start fennel indoors in early spring for transplanting outdoors a month 
later, just before your last frost date. For fall planting, start seeds indoors 
in late summer. Space transplants 6 to 8 inches apart; harvest a few months 
later — when the fennel bulbs are 3 to 4 inches in diameter — by pulling the 
plants out of the ground, cleaning off the soil, and removing the roots and 
tops.
Garlic
If any vegetable has experienced a renaissance lately, it has to be garlic 
(Allium sativum). In recent history, garlic was poo-pooed as a low-class herb 
that needed to be masked on your breath, or you’d risk social embarrassment. 
Now it’s the chic ingredient in many gourmet restaurants and touted as a 
major medicinal herb to cure everything from earaches to high cholesterol. 
Garlic also is a key ingredient in some insect and animal repellents and is 
very effective at repelling vampires (just kidding, I think). These uses come 
as no surprise to anyone who knows the history of garlic. It has been used 
medically for centuries, but only recently did people rediscover its benefits.
For some unknown reason, many also believe that garlic is difficult to grow. 
That isn’t true. I describe some popular garlic varieties and explain how to 
grow garlic in the following sections.
Varieties
Even though you could grow your own garlic from bulbs bought in grocery 
stores, most of those varieties are adapted to a California climate. Unless you 
live in central California where most garlic is commercially grown, it’s best to 
select varieties from catalogs and local garden centers.
The beauty of growing your own garlic is being able to sample the selection 
of varieties now available. Choosing the variety adapted for your area is the 
first step, but then you also can try varieties from around the world. The 
flavors of these different varieties can vary from mild to spicy hot.
Garlic comes in two basic types:
 
✓ Softneck: This type of garlic produces 12 to 18 cloves per bulb in 
several layers around a main stem. Softneck varieties tend not to 
produce a flower stalk and are the best types for long-term storage and 
braiding (twisting the garlic tops in a braid so they’re easy to hang in 
the kitchen). Some varieties include ‘New York White’, ‘Inchelium Red’, 
‘Silverskin’, and ‘Early Red Italian’. ‘Susanville’ is a good variety for 
hot-summer areas.

 Chapter 11: Sweet Corn and an A to T of Other Worthy Veggies
 
✓ Hardneck: This type produces fewer cloves per stem than softneck 
garlic (6 to 12), but the cloves are larger. They grow in a single circle 
around a woody stem. The hardneck varieties also produce an attractive 
flower stalk called a scape that forms small bulblets at the end. The 
bulblets and scape are edible (see Figure 11-2). Hardneck varieties don’t 
store as long as softneck varieties, but I’ve never had any trouble getting 
the bulbs to last through winter.
 
 The hardneck group has more diversity in clove flavor and color. 
Varieties to try include ‘German Extra Hardy’, ‘Russian Red’, ‘Ajo Roja’, 
and ‘Persian Star’. ‘German Extra Hardy’ is particularly cold hardy and 
good for severe-winter areas. ‘Ajo Roja’ is particularly well adapted to 
growing in California and the South.

You may come across a third type of garlic that’s more closely related to leeks 
than garlic. Called ‘Elephant’ garlic (Allium ampeloprasum), this type is grown 
like other garlics but isn’t as winter hardy. ‘Elephant’ garlic plants produce 
huge white bulbs weighing up to a half pound, with large, easy-to-peel cloves. 
The flavor is milder than regular garlic, and you can store the bulbs for up to 1 
year.
Growing guidelines
The key to a good crop of garlic is planting at the right time for your area. 
Garlic likes cool weather conditions and requires a long time to mature its 
bulbs. For gardeners in cold areas or areas with hot summers, fall is the best 
time to plant garlic. For gardeners with mild summers and winters, garlic also 
can be planted in spring.

166
Part II: Vegging Out 
Prepare the soil as you would for onions, forming raised beds and adding 
composted manures (see Chapter 6 for details on onions). Garlic needs 
well-drained soil — if the crop fails, it’s usually due to the cloves rotting in 
wet, cool soil. Fertilize the beds as you would for onions.
Plant individual cloves a few inches deep and 3 to 4 inches apart about 4 to 6 
weeks before the ground freezes for fall planting or as soon as the ground can 
be worked for spring planting. For fall planting in cold-winter areas, wait for 
a few hard freezes and then mulch the beds with a 2- to 4-inch-thick layer of 
hay or straw to protect the cloves over winter. As the cloves start growing in 
spring, remove the mulch. Once the soil warms, apply a side-dressing of a 
soluble high-nitrogen fertilizer, such as blood meal or fish emulsion (see 
Chapter 15 for more on side-dressing). In spring- or fall-sown beds, keep the 
patch well weeded and watered; you may want to mulch in between plants 
for weed control and moisture retention. Harvest starts when most of the 
leaves have yellowed, but before the cloves begin to separate from each 
other in the bulb.
After harvest, let the bulbs cure (toughen their skins) in a warm, dry, airy 
place for a few weeks. Then braid (just like you do hair) the softneck varieties 
or remove the tops of the hardneck bulbs, and store them in a cool, slightly 
damp basement for use as needed. The bulbs last longest in a slightly damp 
area, but you can store them in a cool, dry place — they just don’t stay hard 
as long.
 
Garlic flavor is enhanced in storage; cloves often taste best after stored for a 
few months.
Globe artichokes
You don’t have to live in California (the artichoke capital of the world) to 
grow globe artichokes, which are a thistle relative. Globe artichokes are 
beautiful, bushy perennial plants that produce baseball-sized, edible flower 
buds. I love eating them steamed and dipped in melted butter. They’re a 
gourmet treat.
Globe artichokes are only hardy in warm climates, but you now can grow 
varieties that mature in one growing season (annuals), allowing northern 
gardeners a chance to grow and enjoy fresh “chokes” from the garden. Most 
varieties mature about 90 days from transplanting. ‘Green Globe Improved’ is 
a standard, widely adapted variety. ‘Imperial Star’ has been bred for annual 
production and is good for northern growers. ‘Violetto’ features violet-
colored buds.

167
 Chapter 11: Sweet Corn and an A to T of Other Worthy Veggies
To plant globe artichokes, amend the soil with a 2-inch-thick layer of compost. 
Start transplants indoors from seed 6 to 8 weeks before setting outdoors. 
In mild-winter areas, set out transplants in fall to grow through winter and 
mature next spring. Everywhere else transplant seedlings in spring. In cold 
areas, the transplants need 10 days of temperatures between 32 degrees and 
50 degrees to induce flower buds to form. Space plants in mild areas 6 to 8 
feet apart. In cold areas, space them closer, at 2 to 3 feet apart. Keep the soil 
consistently moist, but not soggy.
Fertilize with an organic product such as 5-5-5 after harvest in mild areas. In 
cold areas, fertilize when planting in spring. Always keep plants well watered 
and mulched.
Harvest the buds with a sharp knife before they open. Plants grown as 
perennials will yield two crops (spring and fall) and up to 20 buds per plant. 
Annual plants yield 6 to 8 buds from midsummer to fall. Cut back perennial 
plant stalks to the ground in fall after harvest.
Gourds
 Certain vegetables, such as gourds, are grown not for eating — because they 
taste like cardboard — but for crafts, decorations, and fun. Gourds are great 
to grow with kids because of all the fanciful creations they can make after the 
gourds are dried.
Gourds come in two general types:
 
✓ Small-fruited gourds (Cucurbita pepo): These come in a variety of 
shapes — egg, pear, apple, turban — mature in 96 days, and are used 
for decorating and crafts. Unlike large-fruited gourds, you don’t have to 
follow special drying instructions; you can use small-fruited gourds right 
after harvest.
 
✓ Large-fruited gourds: These gourds are not only decorative but functional 
as well. Some examples of functional gourds are the birdhouse gourd 
(Lagenaria siceraria), dipper gourd (Lagenaria siceraria), and luffa gourd 
(Luffa aegyptiaca). In some countries these gourds are used for making 
musical instruments! Large-fruited gourds require longer growing seasons 
(140 to 150 days) than the small-fruited gourds, and you must follow 
special drying instructions before you can use them.
Most gourds are ornamental, but some can be eaten when young and have 
unique flavors. Asian gourds grow like cucumbers (see Chapter 8) and feature 
strong flavors that are often used in Indian, Chinese, and Southeast Asian 
soups and stews. Some types to try in your garden include the bitter gourd 
and calabash gourd.

168
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
Grow gourds as you would winter squash (see Chapter 8). The seeds have 
particularly thick skins, so nicking them with a file helps water penetrate them 
and hastens germination. Because gourds love to vine, consider growing them 
on a trellis or at the edge of your garden to roam the lawn. If you’re growing 
large-fruited gourds in a cold-winter climate, start the plants indoors 4 weeks 
before the last frost date to get a jump on the season.
Wait until the fruit skins are hard and the stems are brown (but before a 
frost) to harvest. Large-fruited gourds can survive a light frost, but small-
fruited ones can’t. When harvesting, cut the vines, leaving 1 inch of stem on 
the fruit, and clean the skin.
Small-fruited gourds can be used as decorations immediately after harvest, 
but large-fruited gourds need to dry in a warm, dry, airy room for a few 
weeks. When you can shake the gourds and hear the seeds rattling around 
inside, they’re ready to carve, paint, and decorate. If you want to accelerate 
the drying process, try drilling a hole in the bottom of the large-fruited gourd.
Horseradish
Of the few commonly grown perennial vegetables, horseradish is probably 
the easiest to grow. These roots are hardy in northern climates, last for years 
in your garden, and actually can become a nuisance as they spread over 
time. The spicy-sweet flavor of horseradish is a favorite condiment. It can be 
grated and combined with vinegar to make a condiment sauce, which can be 
stored for months in the refrigerator. A good variety to try is ‘Bohemian’. It’s 
hardy and produces high-quality roots a year after planting.
Choose a location for planting that has partial to full sun, and then amend 
the soil with compost, digging the soil deeply since these roots grow best 
in loose soil. Plant horseradish roots 3 inches deep and 12 inches apart in 
spring after danger of frost has passed.
In spring, fertilize the plants with compost and mulch with hay or straw to 
keep the soil weed free and moist. Then in the fall, dig up roots taking the 
largest (6- to 12-inches long) for eating and replanting smaller roots to grow 
new plants. Roots taste sweetest if harvested after a few frosts, but they may 
take two seasons to grow large enough to eat. The dark green leaves make an 
attractive ornamental. Mulch the plants after harvest for winter protection in 
cold areas.
Kale
If there’s one vegetable to grow for purely the health benefits alone, kale 
(Brassica oleracea) is it. Kale offers the highest amount of protein, calcium, 

169
 Chapter 11: Sweet Corn and an A to T of Other Worthy Veggies
iron, vitamin A, and antioxidants (cancer-fighting compounds) of any 
cultivated vegetable. Luckily, it tastes good too! Lightly steamed or added 
to soups and casseroles, kale adds a crunch and a mild cabbage flavor to 
dishes.
Like its cousin, collards (which I describe earlier in this chapter), kale is 
technically a non-heading cabbage. It’s grown like collards, matures in 50 to 
60 days, but has smaller and more fringed leaves. Some new varieties with 
red and purple leaf coloration are now available. Just imagine: a vegetable 
that tastes good, is good for you, and looks good in the garden, too! Here are 
a few popular varieties:
 
✓ Some standard curly-leafed varieties are ‘Siberian’, ‘Winterbor Hybrid’, 
and ‘Starbor Hybrid’.
 
✓ Some of the newer flat-leafed varieties are ‘Red Russian’, with oak-
shaped, reddish-purple leaves, and ‘White Russian’, a white version of 
‘Red Russian’.
 
✓ For curly-leafed varieties with different colored leaves, try ‘Lacinato’ 
with curly, dark, blue-green leaves. It’s often called dinosaur kale. 
‘Redbor Hybrid’ has curly, reddish-purple leaves with deep purple veins. 
The color gets deeper as the weather cools.
 
Grow kale as you would collards, planting in late summer for a fall harvest. 
The flavor and sweetness of the leaves improve after exposure to near-
freezing temperatures, so I often grow it as a fall crop by planting in late 
summer, picking and eating the plants into the winter.
Kohlrabi
Now here’s something different: a vegetable that looks like a flying object 
from War of the Worlds. It’s kohlrabi (Brassica oleracea), a cabbage relative 
that’s also called a “stem turnip” because the stem near the soil line forms 
a round, turniplike globe, which you eat. Once you get over kohlrabi’s odd 
appearance, you may be won over by its taste and crunchiness. Peeled and 
sliced, it’s excellent in dips and stir-fries.
The plant is easy to grow and very hardy. Some standard varieties are ‘Early 
White Vienna’ and ‘Kolibri’, which has attractive purple skin and coloring 
in the leaves. If you fall in love with kohlrabi and can’t get enough, try growing 
‘Superschmelz’, a football-sized variety that stays tender and doesn’t get 
woody (tough) even though it’s large. The other varieties that I mention get 
woody if they grow too large or they’re exposed to excessive heat.
Like all cabbage-family vegetables, kohlrabi likes cool weather. It’s best grown 
as a spring or fall crop, avoiding the heat of summer that causes the globes 
to get woody. Start seeds indoors as you would broccoli and cabbage (see 

170
Part II: Vegging Out 
Chapter 9), and kohlrabi will mature 50 to 60 days after transplanting in the 
garden. The fertilizing, watering, and pest control are similar for cabbages. 
Harvest the globes when they’re about 2 to 3 inches in diameter (unless, of 
course, you’re growing the football-sized variety).
Leeks
Leeks (Allium ampeloprasum) haven’t received a lot of press in North 
America, but they’re considered a staple in every vegetable garden in 
England and Europe. I love them because you transplant the seedlings in 
spring, as you would onions, keep them weed-free and watered, and then 
forget about the crop until fall. They grow slowly all summer, and by the time 
cool temperatures arrive, they’ve formed thick stalks that can be harvested 
and sautéed in butter or added to soups, such as potato-leek. The flavor is 
milder than that of onions and takes on a slightly sweeter flavor after a few 
cold nights.
Some leek varieties are very cold-tolerant, so you can harvest right through 
the winter in many areas. Varieties such as ‘Bandit’ are winter hardy and have 
attractive blue-green-colored foliage that makes leeks a beautiful ornamental 
as well. Some other good varieties to try are ‘King Richard’, ‘Lancelot Hybrid’, 
and ‘Giant Musselburg’.
Leeks need a long season to mature — nearly 100 days for many varieties. 
For cold-winter areas, start seeds in early spring as you would for onions — 
about 8 to 12 weeks before your last frost date. For mild-winter areas, start 
seeds in late summer for a fall planting and winter harvest. Transplant the 
seedlings 6 inches apart into 6-inch-deep trenches filled halfway with 
compost. Fill in the rest of the trench with garden soil as the leeks grow.
 
Leeks are commonly purchased as plants, allowing you to skip the step of 
seeding them so early.
Like onions, leeks don’t compete well with weeds, so be diligent about 
weeding. Water and fertilize as you would onions (see Chapter 6). When the 
stalks have thickened and after a few cool nights, begin harvesting. Certain 
hardy varieties such as ‘Bandit’ can withstand temperatures below 20 
degrees and can be harvested and eaten all winter in mild-winter areas. Other 
varieties can be mulched with hay to allow you to keep harvesting into the 
winter, even in cold areas. Even if leeks freeze, they can still be eaten as long 
as they’re cooked right away.
 
Hilling the stalks two to three times during the growing season will blanch the 
bottom of the stems white (see Chapter 6 for more on hilling). The flavor of 
the blanched stems is milder, and the texture is more tender than the green 
stems.

171
 Chapter 11: Sweet Corn and an A to T of Other Worthy Veggies
Mizuna
Mizuna (Brassica rapa) is a leafy-type, Oriental green that’s often found in 
mesclun mixes. Mizuna has a small white stem and deeply cut leaves with a 
mild, mustardy flavor. ‘Kyoto’ is a deeply fringed, white-stemmed variety. A 
purple-fringed variety, ‘Purple Mizuna’, is now available as well.
Mizuna matures from direct seeding in about 40 days. As with lettuce, you 
can plant successive crops of mizuna to add zip to salads and stir-fries. It 
also can be cut and allowed to regrow many times. Treat it like any green (see 
Chapter 10) as far as seeding, watering, and fertilizing, and watch out for flea 
beetles eating the leaves.
Okra
Okra (Ablemoschus esculentus) is a classic southern vegetable that loves the 
heat. In fact, it’s one of the few vegetables that keeps producing during the 
dog days of summer in the South. This tall (4 to 10 feet), stalky plant produces 
attractive, trumpetlike flowers along the main stem that mature into okra 
pods, making it a beautiful addition to a flower garden. Some varieties, such 
as ‘Red Burgundy’, have colorful leaves to boot! Each flower potentially 
produces one pod. The pods can be fried, pickled, baked, boiled, and eaten 
on their own or used in soups and stews such as gumbo. Some people don’t 
like the sticky nature of the insides of the pod, but I love them broiled with a 
little oil.
The standard okra variety is ‘Clemson Spineless’, which matures in 60 days. 
But for gardeners with a short growing season, better choices are ‘Annie 
Oakley II’ and ‘Cajun Delight Hybrid’, which mature about 50 days from 
seeding.
 
‘Little Lucy’ is a small variety that has burgundy-colored leaves, pods, and 
stems and only grows 2 feet tall. The yellow flowers have red throats, making 
them a beautiful contrast to the red foliage. Because of its size, ‘Little Lucy’ is 
a great container plant.
Okra needs heat! Don’t direct seed or transplant okra until the soil temperature 
is at least 65 degrees, usually in early summer. Start seeds indoors 4 to 6 
weeks before your average last frost date. In cold-winter areas, lay black 
plastic mulch to preheat the soil and choose quick-maturing varieties. Thin 
plants to 1 to 2 feet apart. Fertilize at planting, again when the first pods 
form, and then finally in midsummer with compost or a complete organic 
fertilizer such as 5-5-5.

172
Part II: Vegging Out 
Use a knife to harvest the pods just above the cap (where the base of the pod 
attaches to the stem) when pods are 2 to 3 inches long and still tender. Check 
the plants every few days. The more you harvest, the more the plants will 
produce. Because okra seed doesn’t save well, buy fresh seed every year.
 
Okra stems and leaves have spines that can irritate your skin. Wear gloves and 
long-sleeved shirts when working and harvesting in the okra patch.
Pac choi
No Oriental stir-fry is complete without some juicy, crunchy stalks of pac 
choi (Brassica rapa) tossed in. If you see the words bok choy, pac choi, and 
pak choi, they’re all referring to the same vegetable. These greens feature 
sturdy, white, crunchy stalks and lush, large, green, flat leaves. They produce 
their vase-shaped, very open heads about 40 to 50 days after transplanting 
and, like other greens, love cool weather. Judging from their sweet, almost 
nutty taste, it’s difficult to imagine that these plants belong to the cabbage 
family.
Two great varieties are ‘Mei Qing Choi’, a baby-size head that only reaches 6 
to 8 inches tall, and ‘Joi Choi’, a standard 12- to 15-inch-tall head that tolerates 
hot and cold weather without bolting. ‘Violetta’ and ‘Red Choi’ are two 
varieties with attractive red coloring on their leaves.
To try your hand at pac choi, see the growing instructions for Chinese 
cabbage earlier in this chapter. Because it matures so quickly, pac choi can 
be succession planted in spring, summer, or fall in most areas (see Chapter 
16 for details). However, avoid summer planting in hot climates.
Parsnips
Parsnip (Pastinaca sativa) is the quintessential fall root crop. I love to grow 
these white, carrotlike roots because, like gardeners, parsnips get sweeter 
with age.
As with leeks (which I discuss earlier in this chapter), you plant parsnip roots 
in spring and forget about them until fall. Then, after a few hard frosts, you’re 
ready to start digging. The cold weather helps the carbohydrates in the roots 
turn to sugar, and boy do they get sweet! But don’t yank them all in fall. In all 
but the extremely cold areas of the United States, parsnips can be harvested 
all winter right into spring (as long as the ground hasn’t frozen) for a sweet 
spring treat. Some standard varieties to try are ‘Cobham Improved Marrow’, 
‘Harris Model’, and ‘Andover’.

173
 Chapter 11: Sweet Corn and an A to T of Other Worthy Veggies
Parsnips take a long time to germinate and mature. Most varieties take 2 
weeks or more to germinate and 100 to 120 days to produce roots. Luckily, 
they grow well in cold weather. Grow parsnips as you would carrots (see 
Chapter 6), but with one exception: When planting, place pairs of seeds in 
small holes that are 
1⁄2 inch deep and spaced 1 inch apart, and then fill the 
holes with potting soil. Because parsnips may not germinate well, the second 
seed ensures a better germination rate. When the seedlings are 3 to 4 inches 
tall, thin them to one seedling per hole.
 
When growing root crops, especially parsnips, don’t spread high-nitrogen 
fertilizer on the beds before planting. Soils rich in nitrogen produce hairy, 
forked roots.
Peanuts
The peanut is a crop you can grow that will taste good and amaze your kids 
(who may have thought that peanuts only grew in ball parks and circuses). 
The peanut (Arachis hypogaea), a warm-season crop, isn’t really a nut; it’s 
actually a legume similar to peas and beans. They grow where okra and sweet 
potatoes thrive. They like heat and a long growing season. However, even 
gardeners in cold areas can have some success with peanuts, provided they 
start early and choose short-season varieties such as ‘Early Spanish’.
Unless you grow a field of peanuts, you probably won’t get enough to make 
a year’s supply of peanut butter, but boiled in salt water, roasted, or eaten 
green, fresh peanuts are a tasty and healthy snack food. (I still remember 
when my daughter Elena and I ate almost nothing but hot, boiled peanuts 
on a vacation in Georgia one winter.) Some other varieties that have big 
pods and more seeds per pod include ‘Tennessee Red Valencia’ and ‘Virginia 
Jumbo’. They all need 100 to 120 days of warm weather to mature.
 
There are actually four different types of peanuts (runner, Virginia, Spanish, 
and Valencia). The first two are runner types with 2 large seeds per pod. The 
second two are bush types with 2 to 6 seeds per pod. Growing techniques are 
the same for each type.
Peanuts like well-drained soil and can tolerate some drought. Plant the 
seeds, with the shells removed, directly in the soil after all danger of frost 
has passed. Space plants 1 foot apart in rows 2 to 3 feet apart. The young 
plant looks like a bush clover plant. Fertilize and water the plants as you 
would beans (see Chapter 7), but side-dress with 5-5-5 organic fertilizer when 
flowers appear to help with the nut formation. Yellow flowers appear within 
6 weeks after planting. Hill the plants to kill weeds (see Chapter 6 for more 
on hilling), mulch with straw, and then watch in amazement as the fun part 
begins.

174
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
After the flowers wither, stalklike pegs emerge from the flowers and curve 
downward, eventually drilling 3 inches into the soil (see Figure 11-3). At the 
ends of these pegs, peanut shells containing the peanuts form. When the 
plants start yellowing, the peanuts growing underground are mature and ready 
to harvest. Pull the whole plant up and dry it in a warm, airy place out of 
direct sun; then crack open the peanut shells for a tasty treat. Most kids are 
fascinated by things that grow underground, and peanuts are pretty amazing 
in their own right, so watch your kids get wide-eyed at this underground 
treasure.

Radicchio
Radicchio (Cichorum intybus) is a type of leaf chicory that can be eaten as a 
lettuce or allowed to form a small, red, cabbagelike head. It’s the latter form 
that people are most familiar with in salad bars and restaurants. The heads 
form white veins and grow to the size of grapefruits. Radicchio has a slightly 
bitter, tart, and tangy flavor and adds culinary and visual pizazz to salads.
For some home gardeners, radicchio isn’t the easiest crop to grow, because 
it often doesn’t form heads. Radicchio likes it cool, and it sometimes grows 
best in spring and sometimes in fall, depending on the variety. The following 
four modern varieties more consistently form heads than older varieties: 
‘Palla Rossa’, ‘Chioggia Red Preco No. 1’, ‘Early Treviso’, and ‘Indigo Hybrid’. 
The latter two varieties are good fall and winter selections. If you grow these 
four varieties at the right time, they should form heads.

175
 Chapter 11: Sweet Corn and an A to T of Other Worthy Veggies
In cold-winter climates, start radicchio indoors, similar to lettuce transplants, 
and grow it as a spring or fall crop. In mild-winter climates, it’s best grown 
as a fall crop. Grow radicchio as you would lettuce (see Chapter 10). Most 
modern varieties, including those previously mentioned, form heads on their 
own (without being cut back) 80 to 90 days from seeding. Harvest the heads 
when they’re solid, like small cabbages. The heads are crunchy, colorful, and 
good for cooking.
 
If plants don’t start forming heads about 50 days after setting them out in 
the garden, cut the plants back to within 1 inch of the ground and enjoy the 
lettucelike greens. The new sprouts that grow will form heads.
Radishes
If you’re looking for quick satisfaction, grow radishes (Raphanus sativus). 
The seeds germinate within days of planting, and most varieties mature their 
tasty roots within 30 days. Daikon, Spanish, Chinese, and rat-tail radishes 
take 50 days to mature. When grown in cool weather and not stressed, 
radishes will have a juicy, slightly hot flavor. Of course, anyone who’s grown 
radishes knows that if radishes are stressed by lack of water, too much heat, 
or competition from weeds or each other, you end up with a fire-breathing 
dragon that people won’t tolerate. I list some popular varieties and provide 
tips for growing radishes in the following sections.
Varieties
Most gardeners are familiar with the spring-planted red globes or white 
elongated roots found in grocery stores, but exotic-looking international 
radishes are now showing up in specialty food stores and restaurants. These 
radishes require a longer season and are often planted to mature in fall or 
winter. (They’re often called winter radishes for that reason.) Here are some 
you can try:
 
✓ Japanese radishes called daikons can grow up to 2-foot-long white roots.
 
✓ Spicy-hot Spanish black radishes look like round black balls or cylinders 
and can be kept in a root cellar for 6 months.
 
✓ Chinese radishes look like turnips but are red, green, or white on the 
inside. They taste similar to the Japanese radishes.
 
✓ Rat-tail radishes are grown for the spicy-tasting seed pods that form 
after flowering.

176
Part II: Vegging Out 
The following varieties work well for the beginning gardener:
 
✓ For the classic red or white round radishes, try ‘Cherriette Hybrid’, 
‘Easter Egg II’ (a mix of red and white), and ‘Amethyst’ (purple skin, 
white flesh).
 
✓ For the elongated white or red roots, try ‘French Breakfast’ (a mix of red 
and white), ‘White Icicle’, or ‘D’Avignon’ (the top of the root is red and 
the bottom is white).
 
✓ For daikons, try ‘Minowase Summer Cross #3’, ‘Miyashige’, and ‘April 
Cross’.
 
✓ Some good black Spanish radish varieties are ‘Nero Tondo’ (round 
shape) and ‘Long Black Spanish’.
 
✓ Some Chinese varieties are ‘Red Meat’ (green outside, red inside), ‘China 
Rose’ (red outside and red inside), and ‘Misato Green’ (green all the way 
through).
Growing guidelines
The round or elongated “traditional” radishes are normally planted in early 
spring to mature while the temperatures are still cool. Daikons can be 
planted in spring or summer, depending on the variety. Chinese and black 
radishes, however, are best planted in late summer or early fall for a fall or 
winter harvest. Rat-tail radishes are planted in spring.
For all types of radishes, form raised beds, fertilize, and sow both spring and 
fall plantings as you would carrots (see Chapter 6). The keys to success with 
any radish crop are loosening the soil well, weeding, thinning the plants to 
give the roots enough room to expand (usually 6 inches apart), keeping the 
plants well watered, and growing them when it’s cool.
 
You can harvest spring-planted radish roots as soon as they start to form. 
Harvest daikon, Chinese, and black radishes when you need them (although 
they’re most tender when eaten on the small side); they can withstand light 
frosts in the fall. Harvest rat-tail radish pods once they form.
Rhubarb
Rhubarb (Rheum rhubarbarum), like asparagus and horseradish, is an 
exception in the vegetable world. It’s a perennial plant (except in zones 8 and 
warmer, where it’s treated as an annual), so once established, it will come 
back faithfully year after year. It will even spread, allowing you to dig, divide, 
and share plants with friends. Hopefully, you have many friends, because 
you’ll only need a few healthy rhubarb plants to produce plenty for pies, 
jams, and jellies.

177
 Chapter 11: Sweet Corn and an A to T of Other Worthy Veggies
 
The part of the rhubarb plant you eat is the leaf stalk that grows from the 
crown of the plant. Don’t eat the leaf itself, unless you want an upset stomach.
Depending on the variety, the stalks are green or red and taste sour. The 
most tender varieties have leaf stalks that are red all the way through, such 
as ‘Chipman’ and ‘Valentine’. Because of its tart taste, rhubarb usually isn’t 
eaten raw (even though I have fond memories of eating rhubarb as a child 
by dipping the stalks in a bowl of sugar!). It’s best used as an ingredient in 
cooking. Can’t you just smell that strawberry-rhubarb pie fresh from the 
oven?
Rhubarb is one of those “plant and forget” crops. It’s a perennial, like 
asparagus, so it comes back year after year. If it has full sun, well-drained 
soil, water, and lots of compost and manure mixed in, it will grow like a weed. 
Rhubarb does best in cool climates, so gardeners in Florida and Arizona may 
have to rely on their northern friends for fresh rhubarb. You also can buy 
plants from a local garden center or online.
For best quality, harvest the leaf stalks as soon as the leaves completely 
unfold to a flat surface. Always leave at least two leaf stalks per plant so the 
plant can rejuvenate itself. If a seed stalk forms (usually from the center of 
the plant), cut it off to extend the leaf-stalk harvesting season. The plants die 
back in fall, but they reemerge in spring from the roots.
 
Rhubarb is easy to dig and divide. In spring, just as the new shoots are 
starting to emerge, dig up the whole plant with a sharp spade and divide the 
main crown into many 3- to 4-inch-diameter sections. Plant these sections; 
within 2 to 3 years, you can harvest from these new plants.
Rutabagas
Probably the only time anyone thinks of rutabagas (Brassica napus), if at all, 
is Thanksgiving, when they’re traditionally served with turkey, stuffing, and 
all the trimmings. They also can be boiled, mashed, or used in hearty winter 
soups.
This Old World root crop is easy to grow, and any gardener can have a small 
patch to satisfy all her fall and winter rutabaga desires (once she knows 
enough about rutabagas to desire them). The flavor and growth are similar 
to those of turnips (which I cover later in this chapter). In fact, another name 
for the rutabaga is Swedish turnip, or “Swede” for short. Because the rutabaga 
is actually a cross between a cabbage and a turnip, if you like either of those 
vegetables, you may want to give rutabaga a try. The roots have either yellow 
or white flesh, depending on the variety.

178
Part II: Vegging Out 
Like turnips, rutabagas love cool weather, and you can eat the lush greens 
as well as the root. A few varieties to try are ‘American Purple Top’ (yellow 
flesh), ‘Laurentian’ (yellow flesh), and ‘Gilfeather’ (white flesh).
 
Grow rutabagas the same way that you grow turnips, except rutabagas need 
about 100 days to mature from direct sowing; turnips mature in half that time. 
Rutabagas love the cold, and the roots can get as large as softballs and still 
remain tender. Leave them in the ground until just before the ground freezes; 
then harvest them as you need them. The longer rutabagas are in the ground, 
the sweeter they’ll taste.
Shallots
If you like the taste of onions or garlic but have a hard time getting them to 
grow, consider growing shallots (Allium cepa). They look like small onions, 
but their flavor is milder than any of their allium cousins — and growing 
them is a snap.
Shallots are an indispensable part of many French dishes. Substitute three to 
four shallots for each onion in recipes. Minced, they can be sautéed in wine 
and herb butter or used in a béarnaise sauce (ooh-la-la). A little candlelight, a 
little champagne, and voilà: Shallots become romantic.
Varieties include the traditional ‘Gray’ shallots with a yellow/gray skin and 
white, creamy-colored flesh, and red shallots such as ‘French Red’ with red 
skin and pink flesh. Shallots are usually purchased as sets (similar to onion 
sets), but recently shallot seeds have become available in many varieties 
such as ‘Pikant’ and ‘Ambition’, allowing you to grow more shallots at a lower 
cost.
Plant shallot seed or sets as you would onion seed or sets (Chapter 6). They 
can be grown in spring or fall and will overwinter in all but the coldest winter 
climates. They require the same fertility and growing conditions as onions. 
About 90 days after planting in the garden, the tops will brown and die. 
Notice that 1 bulb sprouts 4 to 5 side bulbs around it. Separate the side bulbs 
and dry and store these as you would onions.
 
Save some of the largest shallots for a fall or spring planting, and you’ll never 
have to buy shallots again — that is, if you can resist eating them all.
Sunflowers
Sunflowers (Helianthus annuus) are all the rage as cut flowers in floral shops. 
To meet the need, breeders have created varieties with colored heads 
ranging from red to white and plants that are 2 feet tall to 10 feet tall. Because 

179
 Chapter 11: Sweet Corn and an A to T of Other Worthy Veggies
this book is concerned with things you eat, I focus on the giant snack 
varieties of sunflowers. Technically, all sunflowers can be eaten, but the 
snack varieties produce the largest heads containing the meatiest seeds.
Not only are the seeds good human food, but the birds love them, too. Why 
not store some seeds for your feathered friends this winter? Some of the 
best snacking varieties for both people and birds are ‘Mammoth’ and ‘Grey 
Striped’.
This may sound obvious, but sunflowers really do like the sun. As a matter of 
fact, the more sun, the better. Plant seeds in well-drained soil, 10 to 18 inches 
apart in rows, after all danger of frost has passed. To get a jump on the season, 
you can start them indoors 4 to 6 weeks before your last frost date. The eating 
varieties tend to produce a large, yellow-petaled head on a thick stalk with 
large, hairy leaves. Many of these plants can be huge (sometimes as tall as 15 
feet), so the plant needs adequate fertility to grow and produce the best seeds. 
Before planting, amend the soil with plenty of compost or manure, and side-
dress monthly with a complete organic fertilizer such as 5-5-5 (see Chapter 15 
for details on side-dressing). In about 80 days, the heads will open.
 
Sunflowers don’t like company. Their roots exude a chemical into the soil that 
inhibits the growth of other plants in the area. Therefore, plant sunflowers in 
their own section, against a fence, or as a background in your garden.
 
Once the sunflower head opens, you’ll have to be quick to get the seeds before 
the birds do. A simple technique is to cover the heads with a paper bag until 
the petals naturally wilt and the seeds mature. When you can rub off the seeds 
with your hand, cut off the head, remove the seeds, and dry them. Lightly 
roasted, sunflower seeds are a great snack food for kids and grown-ups, and 
you can save some raw seeds for your bird feeder.
Most people are familiar with eating sunflower seeds, but did you know that 
you can actually eat the unopened flower bud? To do so, cut the flower bud 
a few inches from the head with a sharp knife. When steamed and dipped in 
butter, it tastes like a globe artichoke. Who would’ve thunk it!
Turnips
All right, turnips (Brassica rapa) aren’t exactly America’s favorite vegetable, 
but I think they’ve been given a bad rap. Turnips are easy to grow, and you 
can eat the greens as well as the roots. If grown in cool weather, they have a 
slightly sweet flavor.
Like rutabagas (which I describe earlier in this chapter), turnips can be eaten 
boiled, mashed, or added to soups and stews. I’ve even eaten young roots 
raw like an apple. Just peel away the outer skin and crunch down. It’s juicy 
and refreshing!

180
Part II: Vegging Out 
The white or white-and-purple roots are smaller than rutabagas (tennis-ball 
size) and mature quicker (in less than 50 days from seeding). The greens are 
great steamed, and they walk hand in hand with collard greens as the favorite 
Southern leafy crop. Some varieties to try are ‘Purple Top White Globe’, 
‘Shogoin’, and ‘Tokyo Cross’. The latter two produce excellent, mild-tasting 
greens.
Turnips love cool weather. In most areas, you can grow spring and fall crops. 
Here’s how:
 
✓ Start in spring a few weeks before your last frost date.
 
✓ In early fall, wait until the hot summer weather has passed before planting.
 
Turnips are best directly seeded in the garden. Prepare the soil and fertilize as 
you would for any root crop (see Chapter 6). If you want roots, thin the young 
seedlings to 4 inches apart. If you’re growing them for greens only, don’t 
bother thinning them; just start clipping when the greens are 4 to 6 inches 
tall. Keep the plants well watered and mulched with hay or straw, which, 
in addition to holding in moisture and controlling weeds, helps prevent the 
roots from developing a strong flavor. Begin harvesting when the roots are 3 
to 4 inches in diameter. Turnips can take a frost, so you can harvest right into 
winter until the ground freezes.

Growing Berries and Herbs 
for an Edible Landscape
In This Chapter
▶ Growing berries and other fruits in your edible landscape
▶ Planting, harvesting, and preserving herbs
▶ Discovering flowers that you can eat
I
n previous chapters, I mostly talk about your vegetable garden as a separate 
entity in the yard. That setup is great, especially if you’re trying to grow 
lots of vegetables to reduce your food costs. However, another way to grow 
vegetables, and any other food crops for that matter, is to integrate them 
into your existing landscape. This is called edible landscaping. The concept is 
simple: Instead of planting an ornamental shrub, tree, or flower, why not grow a 
similar, attractive vegetable, fruit, or herb that can double as a food crop?
With concerns about carbon footprints, pollution, food safety, and energy 
consumption, many gardeners across the country are ripping out their lawns 
and creating edible landscapes that are both beautiful and functional. My front 
yard is made up of all fruits, veggies, and herbs. I love to look at it and eat from it.
Many vegetables such as kale, Swiss chard, eggplant, and okra are beautiful 
plants in their own right. They deserve places in both the flower garden as 
well as the vegetable garden. Start looking at your vegetables from a different 
viewpoint, and you’ll see the beauty of their flowers, leaves, and shapes. But 
why stop with veggies in an edible landscape? You may want to grow other 
foods as well. For example, in this chapter, I describe some favorite fruits, 
herbs, and edible flowers that you can grow in place of ornamentals in your 
yard; see Chapter 3 for a sample edible landscape design.
 
When substituting an edible for an ornamental, the rules of selection remain 
the same as with any plant: Pick an edible plant that suits the growing con-
ditions in the yard with respect to sun, soil, and climate (see Chapter 3 for 
details). Also, select an edible plant that grows to the proper size for the 

182
Part II: Vegging Out 
spot. For example, instead of a burning bush grow a blueberry bush. The size 
and shape of the shrub are similar, and it has great fall foliage color like a 
burning bush. However, the blueberry yields mouthwatering fruits, too.
Sweetening Your Landscape 
with Berries and Fruits
Many gardeners avoid planting fruits in the yard because they think that 
growing them is complicated. Actually, it isn’t difficult at all. If you select 
the right fruits and varieties for your location and climate, these plants can 
be low maintenance and very rewarding to grow. In the following sections, I 
describe several popular berry types and other unusual fruits that work well 
in edible landscapes.
Strawberries
Strawberry plants have a nice compact habit that fits perfectly into a raised 
bed like you use for vegetables. You can grow these perennials in a bed along 
the house, in the front of a flower garden, or in a container. They’re also a fast 
crop that provides a delicious harvest within a year of planting. And because 
you should replant the plantings every few years (they develop diseases or 
become unproductive if you don’t), you can move strawberry plants around 
if you want.
Space the plants 12 to 18 inches apart in full sun and keep them well watered. 
Strawberries spread by sending out little runners that end with new baby 
plants. After these young plants have formed obvious roots, usually in a few 
weeks, cut the runners and move these young plants around to start new 
beds. It’s important to thin the plants so the young plants don’t fill in around 
the older plants and crowd them (refer to Chapter 13 for details on thinning). 
Make sure to plant varieties adapted to your area, and mulch heavily in cold-
winter areas.
 
While most strawberry varieties are called June-bearing because they bear fruit 
in early summer, some newer varieties are day-neutral or everbearing (they pro-
duce fruit throughout the summer). One of my favorite everbearing varieties is 
the alpine strawberry. These berries don’t produce runners; they stay compact 
and bushy and produce small, sweet berries from summer until frost. They’re 
great for eating out of hand or tossing on cereal in the morning. These small 
plants make excellent container plants and often are planted in a strawberry 
barrel (a container with holes on the side for growing strawberry plants).

183
 Chapter 12: Growing Berries and Herbs for an Edible Landscape
Blueberries
I don’t know why more people don’t grow blueberries. What’s not to like? 
They thrive in full sun and grow on handsome, perennial shrubs that range in 
height from 2 to 6 feet, depending on the type that you grow. You can choose 
from low-bush (1 to 2 feet tall), half-high (2 to 4 feet tall), and high-bush 
varieties (5 to 6 feet tall) that can fit into many locations in your yard. They 
have pretty white flowers followed by large clusters of tasty, blue fruit. 
Berries appear the second year after planting. The attractive green leaves 
turn bright shades of red, orange, and yellow before dropping in the fall. 
Blueberries make an excellent foundation plant grown up against the house 
or grouped to form a hedge between properties.
 
Blueberries must be grown in acidic soil (with a pH level between 4.5 and 5.5), 
so if you don’t have that kind of soil, you need to make some adjustments. 
Amending your soil with a lot of peat moss and some sulfur is one easy way to 
lower the soil pH; see Chapter 14 for more on soil pH and amending your soil.
Plant at least two different blueberry varieties to ensure good pollination 
and fruit set. Variety selection is the key to success. Blueberries grow best 
in areas with cold winters and mild summers. In hot-summer areas of the 
South, grow blueberry types that are adapted to the heat, such as Southern 
blueberries or rabbit-eye blueberries. In cooler climates, all other blueberry 
types are fine to plant.
Blackberries and raspberries
If you’re looking for an edible plant to double as a barrier for animals and 
people, grow some blackberry or raspberry brambles. Both are fast–growing, 
thorny plants. They grow to 6 feet tall and spread wildly from suckers (new 
shoots) off their roots. If you don’t watch out, the plants can easily get out 
of control. However, if you train them to a sturdy trellis and are diligent 
about pruning them, blackberries and raspberries can be very productive, 
hedgelike plantings.
In the first year, most blackberry and raspberry canes (shoots) produce only 
leaves; they bear fruit in the second year (see Figure 12-1). Plant brambles in 
spring, spacing the plants 1 foot apart in rows in well-drained soil in a partly-
to-mostly-sunny location. Amend the soil with compost and mulch yearly 
with hay or straw. Bramble roots love it cool and moist, but not too wet.

184

varieties,

while

Even though most blackberry and raspberry varieties produce only one crop 
a year like strawberries, everbearing varieties produce a summer and fall 
crop of delicious fruits. Choose varieties that are adapted to your area and 
that produce the colored berries you want. Raspberries come in varieties that 
produce red-, yellow-, black-, and purple-colored fruits. Blackberries come in 
black-colored fruit only, but you also can find varieties without thorns.
Unusual fruits
The berries in the previous sections are the most popular fruits grown in 
edible landscapes, but you also can get a little wild and try other unusual 
fruits, too. You can experiment with a wealth of exotic fruits from around 
the world that may grow well in your edible landscape. Expand your taste 
horizons and try some exotic-flavored fruits. At the very least, they’ll be a 
conversation piece! Here are a few examples:
 
✓ Gooseberries: These woody shrubs grow 2- to 4-feet tall and wide. 
They’re widely adapted and produce green or red, round juicy fruits that 
are great eaten fresh or made into pies and preserves.
 
✓ Currants: These bushes, which are a size similar to gooseberry bushes, 
produce small red, white, or black berries depending on the variety. 

185
 Chapter 12: Growing Berries and Herbs for an Edible Landscape
The fruits are juicy and tart, so they’re primarily used for preserves, 
pies, and juices. In fact, currant juice is touted as an elixir that’s high in 
health-promoting antioxidants. (Chapter 2 has more on the health benefits 
of fruits and vegetables.) Like blueberries, these shrubs bear fruit the 
second year after planting.
 
✓ Dwarf fruit trees: While berry crops are the easiest to grow, don’t shy 
away from trying a dwarf apple or cherry tree, too. Tree fruits definitely 
require more study, but many new varieties are disease resistant and 
dwarf, making them perfect additions to an edible landscape. Fruit trees 
generally produce fruit a few years after planting, depending on the type 
you’re growing.
Some other unusual fruits to try depending on your sense of adventure and 
climate are figs, citrus, cranberry, elderberry, lingonberry, kiwi, and banana. 
For more information on where to find some unusual fruits for your landscape, 
flip to the appendix.
Spicing Up Your Landscape with Herbs
How could you plant a vegetable garden without herbs? My mamma’s pasta 
sauce wouldn’t taste half as good without fresh basil, oregano, and thyme 
from the garden; my burritos wouldn’t pop with flavor without fresh cilantro. 
Herbs are easy to grow and take up little space, and many have attractive 
foliage and flowers — the perfect edible landscape plant. Even if you don’t 
use all the herbs fresh, you can add them to vinegar and oils, or dry them for 
future use (see the nearby sidebar for details).
 
I like to plant herbs close to the house for easy access when I’m cooking. The 
best place for herbs that you often need for cooking is in a container on a deck 
or patio. Most herbs are compact enough to grow well in containers, yet still 
give you the yields for fresh eating.
Many herbs produce attractive flowers that bees and other pollinating 
insects love. A healthy garden should be a-buzz with bee activity, and herbs 
help keep our insect friends happy. I mix herbs in the vegetable garden, 
around flowers, and in containers. Creeping herbs, like thyme and oregano, 
grow great in windowboxes and containers. Taller herbs, like rosemary and 
basil, make beautiful additions to a flower garden.
 
While herbs vary in their flavors, smells, and growth habits, most require the 
same growing conditions: a minimum of 6 hours of sunlight per day, excellent 
soil drainage, and moderately rich, loose soil. If you don’t have fertile soil, 
a simple addition of compost in spring is probably enough in most cases. 
Too much fertilizer makes for a bushy plant that doesn’t produce the proper 
amount of essential oils and flavor. And that’s what you want from your 
herbs — great flavor.

186
Part II: Vegging Out 
The following sections take an alphabetical look at my favorite herbs.
Basil
My mother would kick me out of the family if I didn’t talk about one of the 
classic Italian herbs: basil (Ocimum basilicum and other species). She’s 85 
years old and doesn’t vegetable garden any longer, except for the pot of basil 
on the back deck. She and I can’t live without it!
While the ‘Genovese’ or Italian basil is essential for tomato sauces and pesto, 
you also can choose from varieties with different tastes for Greek, Thai, 
Indian, and Chinese cooking (among other cuisines). You can grow basil with 
flavors such as licorice, lemon, lime, and cinnamon. Plus, these annual plants 
grow 6 to 18 inches tall depending on the variety, making them perfect container 
plants. Some varieties have gorgeous all-purple leaves or purple and green 
leaves with ruffles, making this an attractive plant in the garden.
Even though you can’t plant basil until after the last frost date (check the 
appendix for the last date in your area), it produces abundantly in the heat 
of the summer. Start basil seeds indoors about 6 weeks before the last frost 
date or sow the seeds directly in your garden (
1⁄4-inch deep) after the last 
frost date when the soil is at least 60 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition to seeds, 
most nurseries also carry basil transplants. Set transplants or thin seedlings 
to stand at least 10 to 12 inches apart; more room (16 to 24 inches) is even 
better because it encourages low, bushy plants to develop. Plant in full sun.
Harvesting and drying herbs
Most plants benefit from being cut back, so I 
suggest that you harvest herbs throughout 
the growing season. The best time to harvest 
herb leaves is just as the plants begin to set 
flower buds — the time when they have their 
maximum flavor and fragrance.
Cut herbs in the morning when the dew has dried 
but before the sun is very bright, because many 
herb oils in the leaves volatilize (evaporate) 
into the air in the heat of the day. After cutting 
them, wash the herbs, pat them dry, and hang or 
lay them in a warm, well-ventilated place that’s 
out of direct sunlight until they’re dried (about 1 
week). Label and store the herbs in sealed glass 
or plastic containers out of direct sunlight.
To freeze herbs, wash and pat them dry, and 
then chop them by hand or in a food processor. 
Place the chopped herbs in labeled plastic 
containers and then freeze them. A quick and 
easy way to freeze herbs is to add a bit of water 
(enough to make the mixture soupy) to the herbs 
in the food processor and then pour the mixture 
into ice cube trays and freeze. When you need 
herbs for stew, soups, or sauces, just pop in an 
herb cube.

187
 Chapter 12: Growing Berries and Herbs for an Edible Landscape
After the plants have grown for 6 weeks, pinch the center stalks of the basil 
to force side growth and prevent early flowering — flowers take energy away 
from the leaves that you eat. If flower stalks do develop, cut or pinch them off 
early. Mulch the soil and maintain consistent moisture levels. Basil is generally 
pest-free.
 
Basil makes an excellent container plant. Some tall varieties, such as ‘Siam 
Queen’ Thai basil, have attractive purple coloring on the leaves and stems. 
‘Spicy Globe’ basil forms a small, compact, 8- to 12-inch-tall and round plant 
that fits easily in a small container.
The best time to harvest basil is just before the formed flower buds open. 
In the morning, snip the leaves and branches and pinch off the flower buds 
to keep the plant productive. You also can cut the entire plant about 6 to 8 
inches above the ground, leaving at least one node (where a leaf was) with 
two young shoots attached. The plant should produce a second, smaller 
harvest a few weeks later. As the plants mature, early cold weather can ruin 
your crop, so be sure to harvest if temperatures dip into the 30s.
After you harvest your basil, you can
 
✓ Store it fresh: The best way to store fresh basil is to place the stem ends 
in water like a small bouquet. You can put the leaves in the refrigerator, 
but they won’t last long.
 
✓ Freeze it: Because the leaves lose some of their flavor when dried, 
freezing is the best method for winter storage. To quick-freeze basil, 
clean and dry whole sprigs (stem pieces with 3 to 4 leaves) and pack 
them in plastic bags with the air pressed out.
 
✓ Dry it: To dry basil, pinch off the leaves at the stem, and dry them in a 
shady, well-ventilated area. Check the leaves in 3 or 4 days, and if they 
aren’t totally dry, finish drying them in an oven; otherwise, the leaves 
may turn brown and black. Use the lowest heat setting possible with the 
oven door slightly open; turn the leaves for even drying and check them 
frequently until they’re dry and crumbly. They should dry in 10 minutes.
Chives
Chives are one of the easiest plants to grow. After you plant chives in your 
garden, you always have them because they’re a hardy perennial — one of 
the first harvests each year. You can easily dig the plants up, divide them, 
and move them as your garden evolves. And you need only a few plants to 
harvest all the chives you’ll ever need.

188
Part II: Vegging Out 
Common chives (Allium schoenoprasum) grow to 1 foot tall and have narrow, 
hollow green leaves and spherical pink or purple flowers; the plants are 
quite pretty. You can use the leaves in all kinds of sauces and salads to lend a 
delicate onion flavor. And, of course, what would baked potatoes be without 
chives? The flowers, when added to white vinegar, impart a lovely pink or 
purple color. You also can add the flower buds to salads.
 
Garlic chives (Allium tuberosum) are close relatives of common chives, but 
they differ slightly in appearance and flavor. Garlic chives have flat leaves, and 
their white flowers, which are highly attractive to bees, appear in the summer. 
The seed heads are excellent for decorating wreaths, but be careful not to let 
the seeds fall; garlic chives can become a weedy nuisance. Sometimes called 
Oriental chives, you can use garlic chives in soups, salads, sauces, and meat 
dishes to impart their garlicky flavor.
You can start chive plants from seed, purchase a plant or two, or dig up 
part of a clump from a neighbor’s garden (with her permission, of course). If 
you’re seeding, plant in mid to late spring in a sunny or slightly shady area. 
Chives prefer rich soil, and after they’re established, they’ll tolerate either 
moist or dry conditions. Sow the seeds in clusters that are 1 to 1
1⁄2 feet apart. 
Remove the flower stalks after they bloom in early summer. Divide the plants 
(dig up and separate the small plants) every 3 to 4 years.
 
Small clumps of chives planted in pots will grow in a sunny spot outdoors. 
These pots can be brought indoors in fall, and the chives will continue to grow 
as a windowsill plant into the winter.
You can begin harvesting chives 6 weeks after planting or as soon as the 
established plants resume growth in the spring. As you need leaves, cut the 
outer ones near the base. New leaves will keep forming all summer. Use the 
leaves fresh or frozen in soups, on baked potatoes, or in salads. Chives also 
retain their flavor well when dried using the technique for drying basil.
Cilantro
Now considered one of the top culinary herbs in the United States, cilantro 
(Coriandrum sativum) has gained in popularity due to the influx of Mexican 
and Asian cooking. This annual herb is actually two herbs in one. When the 
green, ferny foliage is eaten fresh it’s called cilantro. If allowed to go to seed, 
the seeds are called coriander. Both are essential for ethnic cooking.
 
Cilantro is a cool-season herb that can quickly bolt (go to flower and seed) 
when the weather becomes hot. After the plant has bolted, the foliage 
becomes tough and the flavor less pronounced. Select varieties that are 
slow to bolt, such as ‘Slo Bolt,’ and grow cilantro in spring and fall while the 
weather is cool.

189
 Chapter 12: Growing Berries and Herbs for an Edible Landscape
Direct sow seeds after the last frost and thin plants to 2 to 4 inches apart. 
Most varieties grow 12 to 18 inches tall. Sow successive crops every 3 weeks 
to have a continuous supply of cilantro throughout the season. To harvest, 
pinch the leaves about 2 months after seeding or as needed. Snip off the 
flower stalk as it forms to prolong the leaf growth. If interested in harvesting 
coriander seeds, allow the plant to bolt and form seeds (after you let the 
plants go to seed, you’ll have cilantro seedlings for years to come). Cilantro 
is best used fresh; the leaves aren’t as tasty dried or frozen. You can harvest 
fresh cilantro and keep stems in water for a few days using it as needed.
Dill
Common dill (Anethum graveolens) grows to a height of about 3 to 5 feet. It 
grows best toward the back of your garden where it has plenty of room. It 
also looks beautiful mixed with annual flowers such as salvia. ‘Dukat’ is an 
improved new variety with high oil content and, therefore, more flavor.
Dill does poorly when transplanted, so start from seed sown directly into 
your garden. The annual plants thrive in rich, loose soil in a sunny location. 
Plant the seeds 1 to 2 weeks before the last spring frost date if you want 
the crop to mature when you do your first cucumber pickling. Sow seeds 
1⁄4-inch-deep in rows that are 18 to 24 inches part; or broadcast seeds over 
a 2-square-foot bed and gently rake the seeds into the soil. Plants should 
emerge in 10 to 14 days; let them grow for another 10 to 14 days and then 
thin them to 12 to 18 inches apart. Make small sowings a few weeks apart in 
different 2-square-foot areas in your garden until midsummer to get a supply 
of fresh leaves throughout the season.
 
Let a few plants mature their seed (let the seed form and drop from the flower 
naturally); if left undisturbed, they’ll provide many new plants next season.
 
‘Fernleaf’ is a dwarf variety of dill that reaches only 18 inches tall, is slow to go 
to seed, and is great in containers. Taller varieties tend to flop over in a pot, so 
low-growing varieties like ‘Fernleaf’ are better choices for a container.
You can start harvesting the fernlike leaves about 8 weeks after planting by 
pinching the outer leaves close to the stem. The leaves have the strongest 
flavor just when the flower heads are opening. Store fresh dill by wrapping 
the cut ends with a moistened paper towel and placing the dill in a plastic 
bag in the refrigerator. To dry the leaves, place them in a dark place on a 
window screen; after they’re dry, seal them in an airtight jar. Freezing the 
leaves in bunches in freezer bags retains even more of their flavor.
For pickling, cut off the seed heads when they’re light brown. Dry them for a 
few days in paper bags with air holes in the sides, and then shake the seeds 
loose in the bottom of the bags. You can use then use these seeds for cooking. 
Dill seeds are great not only for pickles but also for beans and fish.

Part II: Vegging Out 
French tarragon
French tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus sativa) is an essential herb for many 
cooks, but it can cause some confusion for the first-time grower. You must 
know exactly what you’re buying when you purchase a French tarragon plant 
because it’s often confused with similar-looking Russian tarragon, a weedy 
plant that has little value in cooking. French tarragon is a hardy perennial that 
can be grown only from root cuttings, divisions, or tip cuttings of new growth.
 
If you find tarragon seed for sale, it’s probably Russian tarragon. If you’re 
buying plants at a nursery, rub some of the leaves together and then smell 
them to determine the variety; the French variety will have the strong licorice 
scent that you want.
Because seeds can be difficult to find, I suggest that you purchase plants. 
Or if you have a friend with an established tarragon bed, ask if he can divide 
his plants in early spring. You want to divide each established plant into two 
or three plants. You divide by digging up the entire plant, cutting it evenly 
into two or three smaller plants, and then replanting one plant and giving 
away the rest. Space tarragon plants 2 to 3 feet apart and give them room to 
spread. Divide the plants every 2 to 3 years to keep them vigorous and healthy. 
Tarragon does best in full sun or partial shade, and it needs well-drained soil.
Cut back plants to 2 feet when flower buds start to form (midsummer) to 
prevent flowering and to keep the plants from getting floppy. In cold-winter 
climates, apply a layer of thick organic mulch — such as straw — over the 
roots in the winter.
Tarragon’s aniselike flavor makes it a wonderful addition to salads, fish, 
chicken, sauces, and vinegar. Tarragon leaves have the best flavor if you use 
them fresh in early summer or freeze them for later use. Store fresh tarragon 
in the refrigerator in a plastic bag with a moist paper towel wrapped around 
the base. Freeze stems with leaves attached in small plastic bags. Drying 
some of the harvest is also an option, but the leaves can lose a lot of their 
flavor if you let them dry too long. To dry, hang in bunches in a warm, well-
ventilated room out of direct sunlight. They should dry within a week. Pack 
them in an airtight container as soon as they’re dry.
Mint
The mint family offers a tremendous diversity of refreshing scents and tastes 
for cooking, beverages, and potpourris. Consider these varieties:
 
✓ Spearmint (Menthe spicata) is most commonly used in the kitchen for 
mint juleps, sauces, jellies, and teas, or to highlight flavor in a fruit salad. 
It’s very fragrant and grows 2 to 3 feet tall with pale violet blooms in mid 
to late summer.

191
 Chapter 12: Growing Berries and Herbs for an Edible Landscape
 
✓ Peppermint (M. piperita) is another popular mint with a strong aroma; it 
grows 3 feet tall with smooth, 1- to 3-inch-long leaves and blooms in mid-
summer.
 
✓ Another dozen or so mint varieties include some interesting types 
such as orange, ginger, chocolate, and apple mint. They’re available 
from garden centers or mail-order herb suppliers (see the appendix for 
addresses).
Start with one or two plants and set them 2 feet apart in a sunny or shady 
location with rich, moist soil. These perennial plants will quickly fill in the 
open area between them. Use a light mulch to maintain soil moisture and to 
keep the leaves dry and off the ground. You can easily propagate mint plants 
by dividing the clumps, so you can share your plants with friends.
 
Many types of mint are very invasive, growing into other garden space, 
especially in rich, moist soil. So unless you grow them in pots or with some 
kind of confinement, such as metal or plastic (to a depth of 14 inches), they 
can become a very troublesome weed. I once had mint take over my herb 
garden in just a year, crowding out all the other herbs. So beware! Figure 12-2 
shows you how to plant mint in pots buried in the ground; make sure that the 
lip of each pot is above the soil line. And remember: Don’t let the plants get 
too thick. Cut them back frequently to promote fresh growth.

Pick young or old mint leaves as soon as you need them throughout the 
growing season. You can easily dry mint leaves on trays or by hanging 
bunched branches upside down in a dark, warm, well-ventilated area. The 
leaves are easy to freeze too; just place the leaves in plastic bags. Store fresh 
mint in the refrigerator similar to how you would dill.

192
Part II: Vegging Out 
Oregano
You can grow several types of oregano; I recommend only one for kitchen 
use. Others do have a mild oregano flavor, but they taste like hay; they’re 
best used as border plantings or for wreathmaking.
 
The oregano most often used in cooking is Oreganum heracleoticum, and 
it goes by the common names Greek oregano, winter sweet marjoram, and 
Italian oregano. It’s a hardy, perennial plant that establishes quickly, getting 
no taller than 6 to 8 inches, making it perfect for container growing. I prefer it 
over common oregano (O. vulgare), which isn’t as flavorful. However, common 
oregano is lovely; it’s covered with ornamental lavender-colored flowers in 
summer that dry well, are often used in wreaths, and are irresistible to bees.
You can start oregano from seed planted after the last spring frost, divide 
established beds to get new plants, or buy transplants at a garden center. 
Planting in rich, fertile soil and full sun is best. When the plants are 3 to 4 
inches tall and wide (a few weeks after planting), thin them to stand 8 to 10 
inches apart. Trim back or prune the plants before they flower (about 5 to 6 
weeks after planting).
Harvest oregano leaves as you need them, but remember that you’ll get 
optimal flavor just before the flowers bloom. Use the trimmings in your 
cooking. After trimming, wait for new growth and use as needed. Oregano 
leaves dry easily and store well, and you also can freeze them. Dry and 
freeze the leaves similar to how you would mint.
Parsley
Parsley deserves recognition for more than just its role as a garnish. It’s also 
a good breath freshener that’s rich in iron and vitamin C. The curly leafed 
parsley (Petroselinum crispum), which comes in many varieties, is the most 
common type because it makes such an attractive garnish. For cooking, the 
flat-leafed parsley or Italian parsley (P. crispum neapolitanum) is preferable; 
it’s easier to work with and has better flavor than curly leafed parsley. I use 
both to make a delicious and healthful green shake consisting of parsley, 
bananas, and water! It’s not for everyone, but I love it. You also can use 
parsley as a substitution for basil when making pesto.
 
Although parsley is a biennial (it grows leaves the first year and goes to flower 
and seed the second), it grows best if you sow seeds every year because 
the flavor is diminished in the second season. Growing parsley from seed, 
however, requires patience because the seedlings can take up to 4 weeks to 
emerge from the soil. Soaking seeds overnight in warm water before planting 
speeds germination.

193
 Chapter 12: Growing Berries and Herbs for an Edible Landscape
Sow seeds in individual pots indoors, plant seeds outside in your garden after 
the first frost, or purchase transplants from a local garden center (the easiest 
way to go). Plants do well in sun or partial shade, and they prefer rich, moist 
soil. Choose a weed-free area when sowing seeds in your garden — you don’t 
want a jungle to grow while you wait for your seeds to germinate. Parsley 
can handle cold weather, so start seeding 3 to 4 weeks before the last spring 
frost. In mild-winter areas, you can plant seeds in fall for a winter harvest, but 
plants will go to seed early the next spring. When the plants have four leaves, 
thin them to stand 6 to 10 inches apart. Provide the plants an even supply of 
water throughout the summer.
To harvest parsley, cut the outer leaves from the plant as you need them. To 
dry parsley, cut the plant at the soil level (you can cut as much of the plant 
as you want to dry; it will grow back from a complete cutting) and hang it in 
a shady, warm, well-ventilated area. After it’s thoroughly dried, crumble the 
parsley and store it in an airtight container. I also like to freeze the fresh leaves 
to use in the winter, adding them to soups and stews. To keep parsley fresh as 
long as possible, store it in the refrigerator, with the leaf stalks in water.
Rosemary
Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) is a perennial herb that can be low-growing 
and spreading or 3 to 5 feet tall and wide, depending on the selection. Most 
varieties are only reliably hardy to USDA zone 9 (see the appendix for more on 
zones), so gardeners in cold climates need to grow the plant in a pot and move 
it to a protected spot in winter (and replant in spring) or grow it like an annual 
herb. ‘Arp’ is a cold-tolerant variety that can be grown in USDA zone 6 if 
protected in the winter with light mulch. Where rosemary plants are kept as 
perennials year-round, they can be trimmed into hedges or made into topiaries.
The blue-green rosemary leaves are highly aromatic and great roasted 
with potatoes and used in soups, stews, and casseroles. I’ve even used the 
branches as shish kebab skewers, giving the vegetables a super rosemary 
flavor. The attractive plant also produces beautiful blue flowers in summer 
that bees adore.
Purchase rosemary transplants at your local garden center; seeds germinate 
slowly and erratically. Usually one or two plants are plenty for typical family 
use. Drought-tolerant rosemary thrives in full sun on well-drained soil. Plant 
rosemary in spring about 1 to 2 feet apart depending on the variety. Amend 
the soil lightly with compost. Periodically pinch back any errant branches in 
summer to keep the plant bushy. Leaves can be dried and stems frozen for 
winter use similar to French tarragon.

194
Part II: Vegging Out 
 
Rosemary makes an excellent container plant — especially the low-growing 
prostrate varieties, such as ‘Collingwood Ingram’. Keep the soil moist but not 
wet. In cold areas in fall, bring the plant indoors to a sunny, well-ventilated 
location. Cut back on watering, but mist weekly with tepid water; the plant 
should survive the winter to be planted in spring.
Sage
Sage encompasses a large group of plants, although only a few are really 
considered good culinary herbs. Most types of sage are perennials in all 
but the coldest winter areas. First and foremost among the culinary herbs 
is garden sage (Salvia officinalis), a hardy perennial recognized by its gray-
green foliage and beautiful blue flowers in the spring. Plants can get quite 
tall (more than 2 feet) and leggy, so the dwarf type (such as S. o. ‘Nana’) is a 
better, more compact form. The dwarf type has equally good flavor but isn’t 
quite as hardy as its garden counterpart.
Several varieties of garden sage have ornamental leaf color. Purple sage (S. o. 
‘Purpurescens’), golden sage (S. o. ‘Aurea’), and tricolor sage (S. o. ‘Tricolor’) 
can add beautiful color to your garden and your dishes.
You can easily start sage plants indoors from seed or in your garden in early 
spring. However, plants grown from seed may not have the same leaf shape 
and color as their parent. A better way to grow true-to-form, high-quality sage 
is to grow cuttings from a friend’s best-looking plants. Or opt to purchase 
plants from a nursery.
Set plants or thin seedlings to stand 24 to 30 inches apart. Sage thrives in full 
sun and well-drained soil. After the plants are established (a few weeks), they 
prefer the soil to be on the dry side. Each spring prune the heavier, woody 
stems from the plants. The leaf production and vigor of the plants drop off 
after 4 or 5 years, so dig up older plants and replace them with new ones 
every couple of years.
You can harvest the leaves at any time and use them in a variety of meat-
based dishes, such as chicken marsala and veal scaloppini. The leaves keep 
well dried or frozen. Dry and freeze sage leaves similar to French tarragon. 
Sage leaves intensify in flavor when frozen.
 
Don’t harvest sage plants too heavily the first year; leave at least half of each 
plant intact to give the plants time to get established.

 Chapter 12: Growing Berries and Herbs for an Edible Landscape
Thyme
The thyme family of herbs is aromatic, versatile, and plentiful — more than 
50 varieties are grown for culinary or ornamental use. Creeping varieties of 
thyme are good as edging plants and in rock gardens. Most thymes are peren-
nial and reliably hardy, except in cold-winter areas. Here are a few common 
varieties:
 
✓ Cooking thyme: The thyme most often used in cooking is known as 
English thyme (Thymus vulgaris). Like the other thymes, English thyme 
has woody stems with small oval leaves. It grows only 8 to 12 inches 
high (many other thymes are even shorter). Thyme is used in many 
dishes including fish and meats.
 
✓ Lemon thyme: Loved for its lemony scent, lemon thyme (T. citriodorus) 
is a delightful plant for both your garden and kitchen. Some varieties 
have both silver and yellow variegated leaves (leaves that sport two or 
more colors). Lemon thyme is a wonderful ground cover and an excel-
lent container plant.
 
✓ Caraway thyme: Caraway thyme (T. herba-barona) is a low-growing plant 
that combines the fragrance of caraway and thyme; it has dark green 
leaves.
Thyme seeds are troublesome to start because they germinate slowly and 
unevenly. Instead of starting from seed, buy a plant or two from a nursery, 
and plant them in the spring in light, well-drained soil that receives full sun. 
You also can start plants from cuttings if a friend is willing to part with some. 
Space plants 9 inches apart. Where winters are cold, mulch the thyme plants 
after the ground freezes with a light mulch, such as pine needles. Trim the 
plants back a bit in the spring and summer to contain them and prevent the 
buildup of woody growth.
 
Like oregano, thyme makes an excellent container plant. Creeping varieties 
grow well in windowboxes and hanging pots. Taller varieties look great com-
bined with annual flowers such as lobelia. You can harvest thyme leaves and 
sprigs all summer. In early fall, cut the sprigs, tie them together, and hang 
them upside down in a warm, dark, well-ventilated place to dry. You also can 
dry stemless leaves on a tray or freeze them. Freeze stems of thyme in plastic 
bags. Store fresh thyme in the refrigerator as you would dill.

Making Your Landscape Blossom 
with Edible Flowers
With your edible landscape it seems that you could be eating almost anything 
in your yard, so why not the flowers? That’s right, many flowers are edible. 
Now I’m not saying that all edible flowers pack a huge flavor punch, but put-
ting a few in a salad adds pizazz and color.
Plant edible flowers anywhere you’d naturally plant other flowers. They look 
great in containers, in the vegetable garden, along a walkway, or mixed with 
other annual flowers. Even though you’ll be picking some of the flowers, the 
beauty of these plants is that they produce an abundance of flowers so they’ll 
still look good even after a harvest.
 
Here are some edible flowers to munch on. Remember that flowers should be 
washed before eating, and don’t harvest flowers that have been sprayed with 
pesticides. Some people may be allergic to the pollen-bearing parts of a flower 
so eat only the flower petals.
 
✓ Apples
 
✓ Bee balm
 
✓ Calendulas
 
✓ Borage
 
✓ Dandelions
 
✓ Daylilies
 
✓ Hibiscus
 
✓ Lavender
 
✓ Lilacs
 
✓ Signet marigolds
 
✓ Nasturtium
 
✓ Pansies
 
✓ Red clover
 
✓ Roses
 
✓ Tulips
 
✓ Violets
 
Although some flowers are edible, many others are poisonous. Make sure that 
you know what you’re picking before you eat it. And don’t let young children 
or pets eat flowers unattended.
 
For more information on edible flowers, check out the book Edible Flowers: 
From Garden to Kitchen by Kathy Brown (Aquamarine Publishers, 2008). A 
good publication on edible flowers and poisonous plants can be found at 
attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/PDF/edibleflowers.pdf.

Part III
Getting Down and 
Dirty in Your 
Vegetable Garden

In this part . . .
T
his part has all you need to know about seeds, soil, 
fertilizers, watering, pest controls, and harvesting. I 
also talk about some cool farmer techniques, such as 
succession cropping and interplanting. And for those 
with less space, I show you how to successfully grow 
vegetables in containers.

Chapter 13
On Your Mark, Get Set . . . Grow!
In This Chapter
▶ Choosing a vegetable planting method: seeds or transplants
▶ Determining whether to start seeds indoors or direct seed
▶ Growing seedlings indoors
▶ Moving your seedlings or starter plants to your garden
▶ Planting seeds in your garden
A
re you ready to plant some vegetables? Now the fun really starts. You 
can plant vegetables two different ways — from seed or by transplant:
 
✓ When planting seeds, you either sow the seeds indoors and then 
transplant the young seedlings in your garden (when the time is right, of 
course), or you sow the seeds directly in your garden.
 
✓ To skip the whole seed process altogether, you purchase young transplants 
(seedlings ready to be transplanted) at your local nursery or through 
the mail and then plant them directly into your garden.
Both methods have their advantages, and timing is critical to success. You 
can plant seeds quickly and without much thought. But working deliberately 
and carefully — whether planting indoors or out — pays off in sturdier, more 
vigorous plants. In this chapter, I guide you through the planting process, 
giving you information about correct seed spacing, planting depth, soil and 
germinating conditions, and fertilizing so you produce strong-growing, 
vigorous plants. I also show you how to plant transplants, whether you grow 
them yourself or buy them.
 
As I say throughout this book (maybe because my dad used to say it in all 
situations): Timing is everything when you plant vegetables. If you really want 
to be successful, you need to find out the planting dates for your area. Each 
vegetable has its own optimum growing conditions — a right soil temperature, 
daytime temperature, length of day, and so on — but all these factors vary 
greatly, depending on where you live. So make sure you check out Chapter 3 
for important climate-specific information. Okay, I’ve made my point — on to 
the planting.

200
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
Choosing Seeds or Transplants
Whether you choose to grow vegetables from seeds or transplants, each 
planting method has its own advantages. Here are some advantages to 
starting from seed:
 
✓ A wider choice of varieties: Your local garden store or nursery may 
carry only three or four varieties of tomato transplants but offer a great 
selection of seeds. And mail-order seed catalogs (see the appendix for 
addresses) offer hundreds of varieties of seeds and specialty types, such 
as organically grown seed.
 
✓ Healthy plants: You don’t have to settle for plants that are leggy (tall, 
weak, spindly stems) or root-bound (roots crammed into a small pot) 
and that may have been hanging out at the nursery too long. Such plants 
usually don’t get off to a fast start when you plant them in the ground. 
Also, when you start from seed, you don’t have to worry about introducing 
any insects or diseases into your garden that may be lurking on nursery-
grown transplants.
 
✓ Reduced cost: Especially if you have a large garden, starting from seed 
can save you some dough. A six-pack of seedlings may cost you $3.00, 
whereas for the same price you can buy a seed packet with 100 seeds.
 
✓ A lot of fun: The excitement of seeing those first seedlings push through 
the soil is something special. Two feet of snow may be on the ground 
outside, but by sowing seeds indoors, you can enjoy a little spring.
The advantages to growing seeds stack up pretty impressively. But planting 
nursery-grown transplants has a major benefit as well — convenience and 
immediate gratification. Growing plants from seeds takes time and diligence, 
but going with nursery transplants gives you an instant garden. And if you 
have problems with transplants, you can always buy more. If you have 
problems with the special seed varieties you started, it’s usually too late to 
start them again indoors, so you’re out of luck growing that variety that year.
 
Growing seeds is like taking care of a new pet. You have to check on seeds 
everyday, maybe several times a day, to make sure they’re happy. Unless a 
reliable neighbor or friend can care for your seedlings, say goodbye to your 
winter trip to the Caribbean. Also, you have to think in advance of what you’ll 
be growing and need to start indoors. In this harried world, it’s often easier to 
decide a week or so before planting what vegetable varieties you need and to 
buy transplants than to plan months in advance to start seeds. Plus, you have 
to store unused seeds somewhere where you won’t forget them next winter. A 
metal tin in a cool, dark part of the house is best.

201
 Chapter 13: On Your Mark, Get Set . . . Grow!
After you consider the advantages of each planting method, you need to 
make sure that you time your planting for the most productive results. Keep 
reading for full details on starting veggies from seeds and growing veggies 
from transplants.
Deciding on Your Seeding Method 
and Decoding a Seed Packet
Suppose you decide to grow your veggies from seeds. Now what? You have 
another choice to make: Will you start your seeds indoors or outdoors? If 
you plant seeds indoors, you have to transplant them into your garden later. 
With direct seeding, you skip the indoor step and sow the seeds directly into 
your garden. Which option should you choose? Probably both, if you’re 
serious about growing vegetables. But consider these points when making 
your choice:
 
✓ Starting indoors gives you a jump on the growing season. If you start 
at the right time (remember, timing is everything), you can have vigorous 
seedlings that are ready to go into the ground at the ideal time. In areas 
with short growing seasons, starting seedlings indoors really gives you a 
head start.
 
 The best candidates for an early start are plants that tolerate root 
disturbance and benefit from a jump on the season. These veggies 
include broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, eggplant, 
leeks, lettuce, onions, peppers, and tomatoes. Another group of vegetables 
that have to be transplanted carefully but do benefit from an early start 
include cucumbers, melons, and squash.
 
✓ Seeds are easier to start indoors. You have more control indoors, 
enabling you to more easily provide the perfect conditions for hard-to-
germinate or very small seeds. You can provide the ideal temperature, 
moisture, and fertility so your seedlings grow strong and sturdy.
 
✓ Some vegetables don’t like to be transplanted and are better sown 
directly in the ground. These vegetables include many of the root 
crops, such as carrots, beets, turnips, and parsnips. They’re cold-hardy 
vegetables, so you can direct seed them pretty early anyway. Crops such 
as corn, beans, and peas also are pretty finicky about transplanting and 
grow better when you sow them directly in the ground. (I discuss sowing 
seeds outdoors in detail later in this chapter.)

202
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
No matter your decision, the seed packet you buy to start your vegetables 
indoors or to plant directly in the ground is loaded with useful information. 
You still want to use a good book (like this one!) to get all the nitty-gritty 
details, but much of the information you need to plant your seeds is right on 
the packet. Consider some things your seed packet can tell you:
 
✓ The name or description should indicate whether it’s a hybrid or open-
pollinated variety (see Chapter 3) and whether the seed is treated with a 
fungicide.
 
✓ The description tells you the high points about the variety, including 
yields, disease resistance, and suggestions for use. Remember to read 
with a critical eye, because companies can make all varieties sound 
fabulous.
 
✓ Cultural information tells you information such as when to plant, days to 
germination, mature plant size, days to maturity, and plant spacing.
 
✓ The packing date tells you the year in which the seeds were packed. 
Always buy this year’s seeds for best germination. Even though 1- to 
2-year-old seeds will still grow well, you shouldn’t be paying full price for 
them.
Starting Seeds Indoors
To start seeds indoors, all you need is a container, soil, seeds, moisture, 
warmth, and light. Oh, if only everything in life were this simple. Check out 
Part II to find out when to start specific vegetables indoors — remember, 
timing is everything. Here are the basic steps for planting seeds indoors:
 
1. Sow the seeds in containers filled with sterile soil (which garden 
centers call a germinating mix).
 
 Keep the seeds in a warm place until germination (when the first shoots 
start to push through the soil).
 
2. After the seeds germinate, move the seedlings to a well-lit location 
(preferably under lights).
 
 While your seedlings are growing in their well-lit location, be sure to 
keep them moist.
 
3. Thin crowded seedlings.
 
 When the seedlings’ heights are three times the diameter of your pot, 
transplant the seedlings to a larger container.
 
4. Acclimate the seedlings to outdoor conditions.

203
 Chapter 13: On Your Mark, Get Set . . . Grow!
 
 Adapting your seedlings to the weather conditions in the great outdoors 
is called hardening off.
 
5. Plant the seedlings in your garden.
Piece of cake; go have a drink. Now on to the details, which I cover in the 
following sections. (Be sure to check out the later section “Transplanting 
Indoor Seedlings and Starter Plants” as well.)
Picking a pot to plant in
Any container that holds several inches of soil and that you can punch 
drainage holes in is suitable for growing seedlings. Several low-cost 
possibilities include milk cartons, paper or Styrofoam cups, cottage-cheese 
containers, and homemade wooden flats, which are shallow, wide, seedling 
trays. Flats enable you to start many seedlings in a small space, which is 
helpful when you water or move the plants. After you plant the seeds in the 
flats, the seedlings stay there until planting time.
Garden stores and most mail-order garden catalogs sell a wide variety of 
plastic, fiber, peat, and Styrofoam flats and containers that satisfy just about 
any budget. You can even purchase pots made out of cow manure. Yum. 
Figure 13-1 shows you some flats that you can buy, along with the appropriate 
lights (which I discuss later in this chapter).

Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
You can use individual peat pots for plants like cucumbers, which don’t like to 
have their roots disturbed during transplanting. Similarly, for gardeners who 
put a premium on convenience, premade growing cubes are a good idea. But I 
have to be honest; I’m not a huge fan of peat pots or peat cubes (compressed 
peat pots that expand when soaked in water). The idea behind a peat pot is 
that once planted (pot and all) in the garden, the plants’ roots grow through 
the sides of the wet pot, and as the season progresses, the peat naturally 
breaks down and disappears. But sometimes when I’ve used them, the peat 
didn’t break down. In the fall when I pulled up my plants, the peat pots were 
still intact and some roots were constricted in the pots. If you still want to give 
peat pots and cubes a try, follow the guidelines in the later section “Making 
the big move to the ground.”
 
Before you sow any seeds, sterilize your flats and pots (especially ones that 
you’ve used before) to prevent the fungus called damping off from killing your 
seedlings. (See the later sidebar “Dealing with damping off” for more on this 
soil-borne disease.) Dip the containers in a solution of 9 parts water to 1 part 
household bleach and then rinse them in clear running water.
Using a mix that doesn’t include soil
The most practical seed-starting mediums for gardeners are the commercially 
prepared soilless or peatlite mixes that are sold in most garden stores as 
potting soil or germinating mix. As the name implies, the mix doesn’t contain 
any true soil. Instead, it’s usually a combination of peat moss, vermiculite or 
perlite, ground limestone (which brings the pH to proper levels, as I discuss 
in Chapter 14), fertilizer, and sometimes compost, which is good for plant 
growth. Potting soil is lightweight, is free of disease organisms that may be 
present in true garden soil, and holds moisture well but at the same time 
offers good aeration and drainage.
 
Don’t use garden soil to start seeds indoors. Garden soil isn’t light enough 
(that is, it doesn’t have enough air spaces) and may contain insects or diseases 
that can kill your tender seedlings.
Sowing your seeds
After you’ve chosen the proper container and soilless soil (or growing 
medium), follow these steps to sow your seeds:
 
1. Fill a container with moistened growing medium to within 
1⁄2 inch of 
the top of the container.

205
 Chapter 13: On Your Mark, Get Set . . . Grow!
 
 Soilless mixes are dusty and difficult to wet initially. Pour the mix into a 
plastic bag, and then add enough warm water to moisten the mix but not 
turn it into a drippy mud pie. Mix the water and growing medium with 
your hands or a strong wooden spoon, closing off the opening of the bag 
as much as possible to keep the dust in. Remove the soil from the bag 
and place it in the container. Gently firm down the medium with a flat 
piece of wood, such as a ruler.
 
2a. If you’re planting seeds in a flat, follow these directions to sow your 
seeds:
 
 Make shallow furrows (rowlike impressions) with a blunt stick or by 
pressing the narrow edge of a ruler into the medium. Then sow the 
seeds according to these guidelines:
 
• Sow small seeds, such as lettuce, at about five to eight seeds per 
inch if you intend to transplant them into different containers soon 
after they come up. Sow larger seeds, such as melons, at three to 
four seeds per inch.
 
• Sow seeds more sparingly, at three to four seeds per inch, if you 
intend to thin and leave them in the same container (rather than 
transplant into a larger container).
 
 Either method — transplanting the seeds into a new container or leaving 
them in the same container — works fine; it’s just a matter of what pots 
and room you have. Transplanting into individual pots takes up more 
room but allows larger plants such as tomatoes more room for their 
roots to grow. Smaller plants, such as lettuce, grow fine when thinned 
and left in their original containers.
 
 You can broadcast (randomly spread) seeds rather than plant them in 
rowlike trenches, but row planting and thinning are easier.
 
2b. If you’re planting seeds in individual containers, here’s how you sow:
 
• Put two to four seeds in each container.
 
• Later, thin the seedlings, leaving the strongest one.
 
3. After sowing the seeds at the correct depth (see the appendix), cover 
them with fine potting soil or vermiculite.
 
 Label each row or container because many seedlings look alike. You can 
purchase labels from a nursery or through a mail-order catalog, or you 
can use old ones from previously purchased nursery transplants. Using 
a waterproof pen, record the type of vegetable, the variety, and the date 
that the seed was planted.
 
4. Water the seeds gently with a mister or spray bottle.

206
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
 A stronger stream of water can wash seeds into one section of the 
container or move them too deeply into the soil.
 
5. Cover the container with a sheet of clear plastic or a plastic bag to 
hold in the moisture.
 
 If necessary, use small stakes to prop up the plastic so it doesn’t rest on 
top of the soil.
 
6. Place the planted containers in a warm spot.
 
 The cooler the temperature, the longer it takes for the plants to emerge, 
so keep ’em warm and toasty! Some warm spots include the top of your 
refrigerator or near your furnace. But be careful how you water around 
electrical appliances. You also can buy heating cables or mats that keep 
the soil warm from below. Follow the package instructions carefully.
 
 Never put containers in direct sun; the plastic cover holds in the heat, 
cooking your seeds to death.
 
7. Check the containers daily to make sure they’re still moist but not so 
wet that they mold.
 
 If you see signs of mold, loosen the cover and let air in; the mold should 
disappear. You also can hook up a small fan to gently blow across the 
seedlings (without the plastic cover on), keeping the soil on the dry 
side. However, be careful not to dry out the seedlings.
 
8. As soon as you see the first green shoots emerge, remove the plastic 
cover and move your seedlings to a spot that provides plenty of light 
and the proper growing conditions for that vegetable.
 
 Refer to the chapter covering that vegetable for information about the 
proper growing conditions. Until seedlings emerge from the soil, light is 
unnecessary, with the exception of lettuce and celery seeds. Sow these 
seeds by lightly pressing them into the soil or covering them very lightly 
with 
1⁄8 inch of fine potting soil, and then place the containers in a bright 
spot or position them under a 40-watt incandescent light.
Providing the right amount 
of light and heat
The light that your young seedlings receive is one of the most important 
factors in good growth. Placing the seedlings in a south-facing window is one 
option but not always the best one. Even in a sunny window, plants get only 
a fraction of the light that they would get outside. Windowsill plants often 
get tall and spindly because they get too warm in relation to the light they 
receive.

207
 Chapter 13: On Your Mark, Get Set . . . Grow!
 
Try to keep your seedlings on the cool side — 60 to 65 degrees Fahrenheit (75 
degrees maximum) — to encourage slower growth; cooler temperatures give 
you sturdy, stocky plants that transplant well. Although a 10- to 15-degree 
drop in temperature at night is beneficial, a windowsill can get pretty chilly at 
night when it’s wintry outside. Place a blanket between the plants and the 
glass to keep windowsill seedlings warm on frosty nights, or move plants away 
from the window at night.
Growing seedlings under fluorescent lights is a good way to keep light-hungry 
plants happy. Ordinary cool-white, 40-watt fluorescent bulbs are fine for 
starting seedlings. If possible, set up your lights near a window so the plants 
can receive both natural and artificial light. The more expensive grow lights 
that you can purchase at a nursery or through a mail-order seed catalog produce 
the broader spectrum light that plants need for flowering and fruiting 
(although your seedlings will be in the garden before they’re ready to flower).
 
No matter what kind of light you have, use one set of lights (usually 2 bulbs 
to a set) for every 1-foot-width of seedling-growing area and keep the bulbs 2 
to 4 inches from the tops of the seedlings at all times. Keep the lights on for 
no more than 16 hours per day so the plants can get their natural rest period. 
Inexpensive timers that turn the lights on and off automatically are available 
at nurseries and hardware stores.
Watering your seedlings
Water fragile seedlings carefully, or you risk uprooting them. Mist them with 
a gentle spray, or water them from the bottom by setting your container in 
a pan of water just long enough for the soil surface to wet (keeping them in 
water longer than this can damage the plants’ roots). After the surface is wet, 
remove the container from the water and let it drain. Keep the soil surface 
lightly moist but not soggy. Always water with lukewarm water, and try to do 
so early in the morning, if possible. This way the foliage can dry off quickly 
during the day to avoid disease problems.
As your plants get sturdier, you can water with a sprinkling can that has a 
rose, a nozzle that breaks the water into many fine streams. After the plants 
grow their first set of true leaves (the first leaves to open as the seed 
germinates are called seedling leaves, and the next set are true leaves) and 
have a bigger root system, let the soil dry out slightly between waterings.
 
Give the plants enough water at one time so that some of it runs out the 
drainage holes in the bottom of the container, but never leave the container 
sitting in water. Overwatering promotes damping-off disease (see the sidebar 
“Dealing with damping off”) and decreases the amount of air in the soil, 
resulting in a weaker root system.

208
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
With soilless mixes, you may have a difficult time deciding when to water, 
because the soil looks dry on the surface even though plenty of moisture is 
still present. To check whether the soil has moisture, take a small amount 
of soil off the top 
1⁄2 inch of mix and squeeze it between your fingers. If you 
can squeeze out any water, hold off watering. The difference in a container’s 
weight when the soil is moist compared to when it’s dry can also indicate 
when to water. Dry soil is very light. Finally, wilted seedlings also are a sure 
sign that you’ve waited too long to water (unless, of course, your plants have 
damping off).
Certain types of containers require more frequent watering. For example, soil 
in clay pots dries out faster than soil in plastic pots. Peat pots dry out fast 
and are difficult to rewet. Try putting your peat pots or growing-cubes in a 
tray and packing moist peat moss between them to keep them from drying 
out too quickly.
 
Self-watering seed starting kits that reduce the need for checking your seedlings 
daily for dryness are now available. These kits have a reservoir of water in the 
bottom of the tray that wicks into the pots when the soil is dry. See the 
appendix for companies carrying seed starting supplies.
Thinning and transplanting indoors
 
After seedlings develop their first set of true leaves (or when onions or leeks, 
which send up a single blade, are 2 inches tall), you need to thin them or move 
them from shallow flats to larger quarters. Thinning is an important step, and 
timing is crucial. If you let your seedlings grow too large in a small container, 
their growth is stunted. And if you don’t space them out at all, you end up with 
weak plants.
To thin plants that will continue growing in the same container, snip out extra 
seedlings at the soil line with a pair of scissors, as shown in Figure 13-2. If 
you try to pull these seedlings out, you may disturb the roots of the plants 
that are staying. Also be sure to snip out any weak or misshapen plants. 
The appendix explains how much space to leave between different types of 
vegetable seedlings.
To move seedlings to a new container, first fill a larger container (plastic 
six-packs, 4-inch pots, or peat pots) with moist potting soil. Poke holes in the 
soil large enough to put the seedling roots in — the eraser end of a pencil is 
a good tool for this. Dig around the plants carefully by using the blade of a 
table knife or a small stick, such as a plant label, and then lift the seedlings 
out of the soil. Always hold the seedlings by the tips of their leaves; otherwise, 
you can easily crush their delicate stems or injure their growing tips. Set the 
plants in the new container, slightly deeper than they were growing before. 
Firm the soil gently around the roots, water well, and keep the plants out of 
direct sun for a day or two until they adjust to their new pots.

209

lings at the

Feeding your seedlings
Regular fertilizing helps produce strong, healthy plants. Some potting soils 
already have fertilizer mixed in, and in that case you don’t have to add more. 
For other types, use a diluted water-soluble fertilizer to one-third strength 
(usually 1 teaspoon of fertilizer per gallon of water) to water your seedlings. 
Water with the solution once a week. For more on fertilizers, see Chapter 15.
Dealing with damping off
One day you’re admiring your strong, healthy 
seedlings, and the next day you’re gaping in 
dismay at the sight of them toppled over and 
dying. The attacker is called damping off, 
which is a fungus that infects young seedlings, 
sometimes even before they have a chance to 
emerge from the soil. If you examine infected 
seedlings closely, you usually can see that 
part of the stem near the soil line is sunken, 
shriveled, and water soaked. Sometimes a 
white mold also forms on the stem.
Damping off is one of the most common problems 
that seed-starters face, but fortunately you 
can control it with good sanitation and cultural 
practices (proper watering, fertilizing, and 
lighting). Sterilizing containers with a bleach 
solution and using sterile potting soil go a long 
way toward preventing problems. Wet potting 
soil and high nitrogen encourage this fungus, 
so avoid overwatering, and use a well-drained 
germinating mix that’s low in nitrogen. Or 
consider using fertilizer only after the seedlings 
develop their first true leaves. Sowing seeds 
thinly to allow good air circulation also can 
help. Many seeds come coated with a fungicide 
that helps prevent damping off.
If you notice seedlings in one portion of a 
container beginning to wither, cut them off 
and remove the soil around them as quickly as 
possible. Then do whatever you can to make 
conditions less favorable for the fungus 
(basically, let the soil dry more). With luck, you’ll 
be able to save the rest of the batch.

Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
Transplanting Indoor Seedlings 
and Starter Plants
After you nurture your seedlings indoors for a good 4 to 8 weeks, and when 
the weather’s right for planting (see Chapter 3 to find out when to plant in 
your area), you’re ready to transplant the seedlings outdoors. Or maybe you 
haven’t grown seedlings at all, but you want to buy some starter plants at a 
nursery and get them in the ground. I discuss both scenarios in the following 
sections.
Buying starter plants
If you don’t start your transplants from seeds at home, you can buy them at 
a nursery or garden center. You can find seedlings of almost every type and 
size around planting time. However, the range of varieties available will be 
greater if you start your own transplants from seed.
Follow these tips when buying starter plants:
 
✓ Choose healthy-looking plants. Tomatoes, for example, should have a 
stocky stem, be about 4- to 6-inches tall, and sport dark-green foliage. 
Read the Part II chapters that discuss the vegetable you want to find out 
what makes a healthy-looking plant.
 
✓ Avoid large, crowded, spindly plants in small containers. The roots 
of these types of plants are often bound up and have no room to grow. 
You can check the roots for yourself by gently removing the transplants 
from their containers (if you aren’t sure how to do this, see “Making the 
big move to the ground,” later in this chapter). If you see a dense mat of 
roots around the outside of the root ball (the soil with roots growing in 
it), the plants probably have been in the pot too long.
 
✓ Buy plants at the optimum size. Plants with four to six leaves and short, 
stocky stems are usually best. In general, younger plants are better than 
tall, older plants that most likely were stressed at one point or another.
 
✓ Avoid plants that are already flowering and have fruit on them. Plants 
with flowers and fruits never produce well.
 
 You can sometimes buy large tomato plants in 1-gallon or larger pots — 
sometimes they even have tomatoes on them. In my experience, these 
large plants rarely grow well after you get them home. I prefer smaller 
transplants that can get off to a running start.

211
 Chapter 13: On Your Mark, Get Set . . . Grow!
You can buy vegetable transplants locally, but many mail-order seed companies 
now also offer a wide range of vegetable varieties as small plants or plugs. 
The plants usually are in good shape. They offer a wider selection than you 
can find in garden centers, you don’t have to drive around to find the best 
transplants, and they ship plants to you at the appropriate planting time for 
your region. See the appendix for the addresses of various mail-order 
companies.
Toughening up all types of transplants
Vegetable seedlings that are grown indoors at home or purchased from a 
greenhouse or nursery in spring need to acclimate gradually to the brighter 
light and cooler temperatures of the outside world. This process, called 
hardening off, slows plant growth, causing the plants to store more food 
internally and increase the thickness of their outer leaf layers. Basically, 
hardening off toughens up transplants for the cold, cruel, outside world.
To harden off your transplants, follow these steps:
 
1. A week or two before you intend to set plants out in your garden, stop 
fertilizing and reduce the amount of water you give them.
 
 Give plants just enough water so they don’t wilt.
 
2. Take your plants outside for a short time.
 
 Give the plants a half hour of filtered sunlight — setting them under an 
arbor or open-branched tree — during the warmest part of the day. If 
the weather is windy, put the plants in a spot where they’re sheltered, or 
construct a windbreak out of pieces of wood.
 
3. Gradually increase the amount of time that the plants spend outside 
and the intensity of the light that they’re exposed to.
 
 You want to increase the amount of time your plants are outside so that 
by day seven, they’re out all day. Move them into progressively sunnier 
locations during the week so they get used to their future condition in 
the ground. However, make sure that you bring the plants in every night.
Another option is to move your plants to a cold frame (see Chapter 21), and 
then you can open the cold frame more each day and close it at night. Plants 
that are raised in a cold frame from the time that they’re young seedlings will 
need much less hardening off.
 
Don’t overharden your plants. Certain crops, such as cabbage and broccoli, 
can quickly bolt (flower before they’re supposed to) if seedlings older than 
3 weeks are repeatedly exposed to temperatures lower than 40 degrees for a 
couple of weeks.

212
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
Making the big move to the ground
Before transplanting your homegrown seedlings or nursery-bought transplants, 
you need to prepare your soil and sculpt beds or rows (as described in 
Chapter 14), and your garden must be ready to plant. If you’re worried about 
keeping the rows straight, use string and stakes as described in the later 
section “Row planting.”
Choose a calm, cloudy day to transplant, if possible. Late afternoon is a good 
time because plants can recover from the shock of transplanting without 
sitting in the midday heat and sun. Your garden soil should be moist, but not 
soggy. If the weather has been dry, water the planting area the day before you 
plant. Moisten the soil in your flats or pots so it holds together around the 
plants’ roots when you remove the plants from their containers.
 
When setting out plants in biodegradable peat pots, make slits down the sides 
of the pots or gently tear the sides to enable the roots to push through. Also, 
tear off the lip (top) of the pot so it doesn’t stick up above the soil surface and 
pull moisture out of the soil. If you’re using premade growing blocks encased 
in netting, cut off the netting before planting.
To transplant seedlings, follow these steps:
 
1. Use a hoe, spade, or trowel to make a small hole in your garden for 
each seedling.
 
 The hole should be deep enough so the transplant is at the same depth 
in the ground as it was in the pot (except for tomatoes). Make the hole 
twice as wide as the root ball.
 
2. Unpot a seedling (unless it’s in a peat pot) by turning its pot upside 
down and cupping the seedling with your hand.
 
 Be sure to keep the root mass and soil intact. If the seedling doesn’t 
come out easily, gently tap on the edge of the pot or gently press on the 
bottom of each cell of the flat with your fingers. Whatever you do, don’t 
yank out a plant by its stem.
 
3. Check the root ball’s condition.
 
 If the roots are wound around the outside of the pot, work them loose 
with your fingers so they can grow out into the soil. Unwind larger roots 
and break smaller ones (this won’t hurt them) so they all point outward. 
Try to keep as much of the original soil intact as possible.
 
4. Mix a diluted liquid fertilizer into the soil of the planting hole to help 
the plants get off to a fast start.
 
 Reduce the recommended strength on the fertilizer container by half. 
For example, if it says apply 1 tablespoon per gallon of water, use only 
1⁄2 
tablespoon. (See Chapter 15 for more on fertilizers.)

213
 Chapter 13: On Your Mark, Get Set . . . Grow!
 
5. Put each prepared seedling into the holes that you made.
 
 Most young vegetables should be planted at the same soil level as they 
were in the pot, as shown in Figure 13-3. For some vegetables, such as 
tomatoes, you can sink the seedling a little deeper. They grow extra roots 
along the lower portion of their stems and thrive with this treatment.
 
6. After firming the soil around the roots with your hands, form a 
shallow soil basin around the base of the transplant.
 
 The soil basin serves as a moat around the seedling to hold water. When 
you water or it rains, the moisture stays in the moat and drains to where 
the roots are located. Chapter 15 provides more information on soil basins.
 
7. Depending on the conditions, water the bed that day or the next.
 
 If the weather has been dry or if the soil is sandy, you may want to water 
the entire bed; if it’s rainy or the soil is already very wet, wait until 
tomorrow to water.
 
8. Keep the bed moist while the seedlings get established and begin to 
grow strongly.
 
 In extreme hot, dry weather, provide temporary shade for transplants 
with paper tents or wooden shingles pushed into the ground on the 
south or west side of the plants.

If you don’t get an ideal transplanting day and the weather is hot and sunny, 
shade the plants until the sun goes down. And don’t be alarmed if your plants 
look a little droopy after you set them out; they’ll soon recover. Cabbage 
seedlings can droop and look almost dead, for example, and be up and 
growing in a day or two.

214

Sowing Seeds Directly in Your Garden
Unless you live in an area where summers are really short, some vegetables 
are better off sown directly in a garden rather than as transplants. Large-
seeded, fast-growing vegetables — such as corn, melons, squash, beans, and 
peas — usually languish if they’re grown in containers for even a day or two 
too long. Plants sown directly in the ground usually surpass these seedlings 
if both are planted at the same time. (Even if you live in a short-season area, 
you can help speed new plants along. See Chapter 21 for information on 
extending your growing season.)
In the following sections, I describe different methods for planting seeds right 
into your garden and show you how to thin seedlings carefully.
Deciding on a seed-planting method
You can plant seeds in a variety of patterns: single rows, wide rows, beds, 
raised beds, or hills. The method you choose depends on your climate, your 
tools, and your taste. You can find out more about these planting methods in 
Chapter 3. Whichever method you choose, here are a few basic principles to 
keep in mind when planting seeds:
 
✓ Make sure that the soil has dried out sufficiently before you work it, and 
be sure that the soil is warm enough for the seeds that you want to plant. 
Pea seeds, for example, germinate in soil as cool as 40 degrees, and you 
can plant them as soon as you can work the soil in spring. Squash seeds, 
on the other hand, need warmth. If your soil temperature is much below 65 
degrees, the seeds are likely to rot in the ground before they sprout. (See 
the appendix for a list of appropriate soil temperatures for different kinds of 
seeds.) The best way to determine the temperature of your soil is to use a 
soil thermometer, which you can buy at a garden store. Chapter 14 provides 
more information on preparing your soil for sowing.
 
✓ Immediately before planting seeds, loosen your garden soil with a hoe 
or shovel to a depth of 6 inches. Rake over the area to create a smooth 
planting surface. Don’t walk over areas where you’ll be sowing seeds; 
stay in the pathways. Compacting the soil makes it difficult for seedlings 
to emerge and send down their roots.
 
✓ Sow seeds at the proper planting depth. A seed planted too deeply uses 
up its supply of stored nutrients before the seedling can push its way to 
the surface; a seed planted too shallow may dry out. A general rule is to 
plant seeds to depths that are two to three times their diameters, but 
the appendix gives recommended planting depths for different kinds of 
seeds. Also try to sow at a uniform depth because seedlings are more 
likely to emerge at the same time, enabling you to see where your plants 
are when you do your first weeding.

215
 Chapter 13: On Your Mark, Get Set . . . Grow!
 
✓ Water newly planted seeds carefully. Use a watering can with a rose 
(nozzle with multiple holes) or a hose with a breaker attachment (a 
nozzle that breaks the stream into a gentle spray). A strong stream of 
water can wash seeds out of a bed or too deeply into the ground. Keep 
the seeds moist but not soggy until the seeds germinate. Heavy soils 
often form a crust as they dry out, making it difficult for the seedlings to 
break through. A moist surface helps prevent crusting, as does covering 
seeds with vermiculite or sand, instead of soil alone. If the weather is 
dry after you sow the seeds, gently water the seeded area every 2 days 
or so.
The following sections explain the basic methods for planting your seeds.
Row planting
The first step when row planting is to mark the placement of a row within 
your garden. A planting line consisting of a simple string and stakes enables 
you to easily lay out rows. Make a furrow, or trench, at the correct depth 
along the row. To make a shallow furrow, lay a rake or hoe underneath your 
string marker, and press the handle into the soil. You can make deeper 
furrows (ones that can be used for watering, too) by dragging the corner of 
your hoe across the soil surface, using the string as your guideline.
Sow seeds more thickly than you want the final spacing of the crops to be 
to ensure an adequate number of plants; some seeds may fail to sprout. 
Thinning rows is less of a chore if you space seeds as evenly as possible. 
Large seeds like peas and beans are easy to space at precise intervals, but 
evenly spacing small seeds can be a real challenge.
Cover the seeds with fine soil and then firm them in with the back of a hoe to 
make sure that all the seeds are in contact with the soil. Water gently.
 
If you’re planting long rows of corn, beans, or peas that will be furrow-irrigated 
(see Chapter 15), fill the furrows with water first and then push the large seeds 
into the top of raised beds.
Wide row planting
You can plant more seeds in less space and get higher yields by using the 
wide row planting method. (Figure 13-4 compares wide rows and straight 
single rows.) This method not only saves space but also allows you to 
concentrate watering, weeding, and fertilizing in a smaller area. Follow these 
steps for wide row planting:
 
1. Choose the location and width of your row, usually 10 to 16 inches 
wide, and then smooth the soil until it’s level.
 
 You may want to run strings along the outside edges of the row to 
clearly designate the planting area.

216
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
2. Sprinkle seeds over the entire row — with most crops, try to land the 
seeds about 
1⁄2 to 1 inch apart (for peas and beans, 1
1⁄2 to 2 inches).
 
 Pat the seeds down with the back of a hoe.
 
3. Use a rake to lift soil from the side of the row to cover the seeds, and 
gently smooth the soil covering the seeds to the same depth throughout 
the row.
 
 With small seeds like carrots and lettuce, cover the seeds with a thin 
layer of potting soil. Then pat the potting soil down again to bring the 
added soil into firm contact with the seeds.
 
4. Water the seeds gently.
 
 Keep the soil moist by gently watering a few times a week or when you 
see that the top layer of soil is drying out.
 
Figure 13-4:

versus wide 
rows.

Raised bed planting
Planting raised beds is essentially the same as planting wide rows. To prepare 
your beds, see Chapter 14. If you don’t have permanent beds, mark the 
dimensions and smooth out the soil. You can broadcast sow (sprinkle by 
hand) in single rows with a few inches between rows, as shown in Figure 13-5, 
or you can plant individual seeds at the proper distance apart.

217

Hill planting
Plant seeds for vining crops that spread out — such as squash, melons, or 
cucumbers — in hills or circular groups, as shown in Figure 13-6. Loosen and 
level the soil in a 1-foot-diameter area, and then plant five to six seeds close 
together. After the second set of true leaves form, keep the two strongest 
seedlings (the ones that are the biggest and sport the most leaves) and thin 
out the remaining seedlings by cutting them with scissors (see the next 
section for details).

218
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
If your soil is heavy, you may want to plant in a raised hill (also called a mound). 
The raised soil warms up more quickly than the surrounding soil and drains 
better. But be careful in midsummer not to let the mound dry out. You can easily 
construct a soil basin around the mound for watering (see Chapter 15).
Thinning seedlings in your garden
Soon after seedlings grow their second set of true leaves, you need to thin 
them out. Don’t neglect this important step; crowded seedlings turn into 
weak, spindly plants that don’t produce well. Separate the plants by hand or 
with a narrow hoe according to the distances in Chapter 3.
 
When you thin plants, either discard the extra seedlings or move them to 
another part of your garden. Newly transplanted seedlings need extra 
attention until they get established. Shade them from the hot sun for a day 
or two and be sure to keep them well watered. Lettuce is one of the easiest 
vegetables to move when it’s small. Root crops such as beets and carrots 
transplant poorly, as do beans and peas.
You can thin some crops in stages, with delicious results. Carrots, lettuce, 
and beets are all good candidates for gradual thinning. If you’ve ever tasted 
beet greens cooked up with tender, marble-sized beets still attached, you 
know what a real treat they are. Start thinning carrot, lettuce, and beet 
seedlings when they’re 1 to 2 inches apart. After the plants grow to 6 to 8 
inches tall, pull up every other one and enjoy them. Leave a final 4- to 6-inch 
spacing for larger plants to develop.

P
roperly preparing the soil before planting is an all-important first step 
toward a bountiful harvest. Don’t take shortcuts with your soil. You’ll be 
cheating your plants at their roots, and they won’t like it.
In this chapter, I tell you how to take care of your soil — clean it up, 
straighten it out, and make it an all-around better place for roots. Remember, 
good soil makes happy roots, and happy roots mean a healthy garden.
Razing Your Garden Spot
After you choose a good sunny spot for your vegetable garden and draw a 
plan on paper (see Chapter 3 if you haven’t done this preparatory work), 
you need to clean up the area so the soil will be easier to work. You can 
clear your garden area any time during the year, but the season before 
planting works best — clear in the fall for spring planting, clear in the spring 
for summer or fall planting. You can clear the area the day before you plant, 
but you may have more weed problems later.
If you already have an established garden, clean up any debris in fall or 
winter, depending on where you live, and till the ground before planting.
 
Here are the basics of initially clearing your garden spot, which I explain in 
more detail in the sections that follow:

220
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
1. Outline the areas of your garden plot that you want to clear.
 
 You outline the areas depending on how you want the plots to be 
shaped. Follow these guidelines:
 
• To get your edges straight for a square or rectangular vegetable 
plot, stretch a string between sticks and mark the line with a 
trickle of ground white limestone, which is available at garden 
centers.
 
• For a round garden, use a hose or rope to lay out the area, 
adjusting the position to create a smooth curve.
 
• If you want several individual beds separated by permanent paths, 
outline each bed independently with string, sticks, and limestone 
so you don’t waste time improving soil that you’ll never use. But if 
you think that you may change your garden layout from season to 
season or year to year, work the entire area within the outline.
 
2. Clear the surface by first removing plants, weeds, brush, and rock. If 
necessary, mow the site to cut back the grass and weeds close to the 
surface of the soil.
 
 See the section “Killing weeds and aggressive grasses,” for details on 
removing weeds.
 
3. Dig out the roots of small trees and tough weeds with a hoe, shovel, or 
pick ax.
 
4. After the vegetation is manageable, remove any sod.
 
 See the section “Stripping sod” for details on how to do this.
Killing weeds and aggressive grasses
If your garden area contains a lot of perennial weeds — weeds, like quack 
grass, that come back year after year — or if you need to clear an area of a 
warm-season lawn composed of vigorous grasses (like Bermuda grass), make 
sure that you first kill these weeds or grasses. You can pull out or mulch 
out seedlings (see Chapter 15 for more on mulches and weeding), but many 
aggressive weeds and turf spread by underground roots as well as seeds; 
these underground roots can haunt you for eons.
If you have an existing garden, you have to be diligent about weeding, or 
you may need to start all over again with tilling and removing as much of the 
weed’s root system as you can.
You can kill weeds and aggressive grasses two ways:

221
 Chapter 14: Workin’ the Dirt
 
✓ Hand dig and sift: For a small garden dig up the earth and carefully sift 
the soil, removing sod and root parts that may come back next year as 
weeds (see the tip on sifting compost at the end of this chapter).
 
✓ Apply a covering: An easy, chemical-free way to clear your garden is to 
cover it with clear or black plastic, cardboard, or even old rugs. After a 
month under these impermeable coverings, existing plants die from the 
lack of sunlight. You must plan ahead to use this method, and it may not 
look pretty, but it works like a charm — especially on annual weeds. For 
perennial weeds, you may need to dig out their roots, too, after applying 
the plastic.
 
 You can buy plastic in rolls at hardware stores or home improvement 
centers; check department stores for old pieces of cardboard and carpet 
stores for old rugs. Use the thickest plastic or cardboard you can find — 
it should be at least 2 millimeters, but 4 millimeters is even better.
Controlling weeds and grasses by applying a covering to your garden area is 
easy. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Spread the covering over your entire garden area, securing the edges 
with spare rocks, bricks, or boards.
 
 Let neighboring pieces overlap by several inches so no light can 
penetrate. If you’re using old rugs, place them nap side down.
 
2. After a month, remove the covering and strip off any grass or weeds.
 
 Use a shovel to cut off any grass or weeds at the root level (just below 
the soil surface). If they aren’t too thick, rototill them into the ground.
 
3. Wet the area and wait about 10 days for weeds to sprout.
 
 Leave the covering off; you want weeds to sprout. You should get some 
growth because you haven’t removed weed seeds.
 
4. Use a hoe to kill the weeds.
 
 Hoeing the weeds down is sufficient to kill annual weeds, but if you have 
perennial weeds, you need to dig out the roots. Check out the National 
Gardening Association’s Weed Library (www.garden.org/weed
library) for help identifying the weeds in your garden.
 
For an organic approach to killing weeds and building your garden soil, try a 
no-till layered garden technique (see Figure 14-1). It’s like making lasagna. The 
season before planting, lay down a 3- to 4-sheet-thick layer of black and white 
newspaper over the garden area. Water the paper to keep it in place. Cover 
the newspaper with a 6-inch-thick layer of hay or straw. Top that with a 1- to 
2-inch-thick layer of compost. By the next planting season, the layers will have 
killed the grass and most of the annual and perennial weeds in your garden. 

222
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
You can hand pull any tenacious perennial weeds that survived. Earthworms 
will have munched up much of the newspaper turning it into valuable compost. 
You can plant your seedlings right into the mulched layers, and they’ll grow 
like weeds (even better).

Stripping sod
If you don’t want to try the techniques in the preceding section, you can 
immediately remove the lawn grass by stripping the sod (grass and roots) 
before planting. I show you how to clear it away in this section. If your lawn 
consists of bluegrass and other less-spreading grasses, you can strip the sod 
without first killing the grass; most lawns in the northern United States consist 
of these types of grasses. But you should kill weedier grasses, like Bermuda 
grass, before you strip the sod (see the preceding section for details on 
killing weedier grass). Stripping sod takes a lot of effort, but it works. Just 
follow these steps, and have your wheelbarrow or garden cart handy:
 
1. Water the area that you want to clear for 15 minutes for each of the 2 
days prior to digging up your sod.
 
 I suggest watering this way because stripping sod is easier when the 
ground is slightly moist.

223
 Chapter 14: Workin’ the Dirt
 
2. Starting at one end of your plot, slip a spade under the grass and slide 
it under the sod.
 
 An easier method is to precut the sod into square or rectangular sections 
and then loosen each section with a spade. Either way, don’t dig too 
deep; you just want to remove the sod and 1 to 2 inches of roots. You 
also can use a rented sod stripper to cut the sod into rows that you roll 
up and remove.
 
3. Pivot your spade up and let the sod flip off the spade and back onto 
the ground. Use your spade to slice off the sod section, toss the sod 
into a wheelbarrow or garden cart, and take it to a compost pile.
 
 If your sod has healthy grass with few weeds, and you don’t want to 
compost it, use it to patch bare spots in your lawn. Keep it well watered, 
and it should root and blend in with the existing grasses.
 
4. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 until your garden is cleared of sod.
These steps should clear all the grass in your garden. You’ll get new growth 
only if you have an aggressive grass like Bermuda and don’t kill all the roots.
Analyzing and Improving Your Soil
After clearing your garden area, you need to take a close look at your soil — 
give it a good squeeze, have it tested, amend it, and then work it out to make 
sure it’s in shipshape. Good soil gives vegetable roots a balance of all the 
things they need: moisture, nutrients, and air. And knowing your soil type 
enables you to counteract problems that you may face when gardening on 
that piece of land. I explain the basics in the following sections.
Distinguishing different types of soil
Three main types of soil exist, with a lot of variations in between. Hard clay is 
at one end of the spectrum; soft, sandy soil is at the other end; and loam is in 
the middle. Being familiar with your soil helps you know what to expect when 
gardening. Clay soil tends to have a lot of natural fertility but is heavy to 
work with and doesn’t drain water well. Sandy soil, on the other hand, drains 
water well (maybe too well) but doesn’t have a lot of natural fertility. Loam, 
the ideal soil, is somewhere in between the two.
Here are general characteristics of the three basic types of soil:
 
✓ Sandy soil is composed of mostly large mineral particles. Water moves 
through this soil quickly, taking nutrients with it. Sandy soil is well 
aerated, quick to dry out and warm up, and often lacks the nutrients 
that vegetables need.

224
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
✓ Clay soil consists of mainly small particles that cling tightly together 
and hold water and nutrients. It’s slow to dry out and warm up, and has 
poor aeration, but it’s fertile when it can be worked.
 
✓ Loam soil is a happy mixture of large and small particles. It’s well 
aerated and drains properly, but it can still hold water and nutrients. 
This is the soil to have for a great vegetable garden.
 
To find out what type of soil you have, grab a handful of moist soil and 
squeeze it, as shown in Figure 14-2. Then use these guidelines to determine 
what type of soil you’re working with:
 
✓ Sandy soil falls apart and doesn’t hold together in a ball when you let 
go. It feels gritty when you rub it between your fingers.
 
✓ Clay soil oozes through your fingers as you squeeze it and stays in a 
slippery wad when you let go. Rubbing clay soil between your fingers 
feels slippery.
 
✓ Loam soil usually stays together after you squeeze it, but it falls apart 
easily when you poke it with your finger.

you have.

 Chapter 14: Workin’ the Dirt
If you have sandy or clay soil, don’t despair; you can improve your soil and 
make it more like loam. Check out the section “Adding organic matter (aka 
the dead stuff),” later in this chapter, for details.
Testing your soil
Vegetables are kind of picky about soil chemistry. Too much of this nutrient 
or too little of that nutrient, and you have problems. If you don’t believe me, 
check out Chapter 4 to see what happens when tomatoes grow in soil that’s 
deficient in calcium; they develop blossom-end rot. Yuck. Sometimes too 
much of a nutrient, such as nitrogen, causes lots of leaf growth on plants 
(such as peppers) but few fruits. Getting the levels just right is important for 
the best harvest.
In addition to nutrient levels, soil pH also is an important factor in plant 
growth. The right pH enables vegetables to use nutrients from the soil. Soil 
is rated on a pH scale, with a pH of 1 being most acidic and a pH of 14 being 
most alkaline. If your soil’s pH isn’t within a suitable range, plants can’t take 
up nutrients — like phosphorus and potassium — even if they’re present in 
the soil in high amounts. On the other hand, if the pH is too low, the solubility 
of certain minerals, such as manganese, may increase to toxic levels.
 
Most vegetables grow well in a slightly acidic soil with a pH between 6 and 7. 
Potatoes, including sweet potatoes, prefer a slightly more acidic soil, in the 5 
to 6 range. But in general, if you aim for a soil pH between 6 and 7, your 
vegetables should grow well.
The only way to find out whether your soil will be to your vegetables’ liking 
is to test it. Don’t worry; analyzing your soil isn’t complicated, and you don’t 
need a lab coat. Here are two ways that you can test your soil:
 
✓ Use a do-it-yourself kit. This basic pH test measures your soil’s acidity and 
alkalinity and sometimes major nutrient content. Buy a kit at a nursery, 
follow the instructions, and voilà — you know your soil’s pH. However, 
the test gives you only a rough picture of the pH and nutrient levels in 
your soil. You may want to know more about your soil.
 
✓ Have a soil lab do a test for you. A complete soil test is a good 
investment because a soil lab can thoroughly analyze your soil. Here’s 
what you can find out from a soil lab’s test in addition to the pH level:
 
• Your soil’s nutrient content. If you know your soil’s nutrient 
content, you can determine how much and what kind of fertilizer to 
use. In fact, many soil tests tell you exactly how much fertilizer 
to add; see Chapter 15 for more on fertilizer.

226
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
• Soil problems that are specific to your geographic region. A soil 
test may help you identify local problems. The soil lab should then 
give you a recommendation for a type and amount of fertilizer to 
add to your soil. For example, in dry-summer areas, you may have 
salty soil; the remedy is to add gypsum, a readily available mineral 
soil additive.
 
 Of course, soil labs charge around $20 to $30 for their basic services. 
Your local Cooperative Extension Service office or a private soil lab can 
conduct a complete and reliable soil test. To locate a private lab, look 
in the phone book under soil testing (or search the Internet for soil test 
labs around the country). You also can ask your Cooperative Extension 
Service office for recommendations.
 
 Fall is a good time to test soil because labs aren’t as busy. It’s also a 
good time to add many amendments (materials that improve your soil’s 
fertility and workability) to your soil because they break down slowly.
To prepare a soil sample to use with a do-it-yourself kit or to send to a soil 
lab, follow these steps:
 
1. Fill a cup with soil from the top 4 to 6 inches of soil from your 
vegetable garden, and then place the soil in a plastic bag.
 
2. Dig six to eight similar samples from different parts of your plot.
 
3. Mix all the cups of soil together; place two cups of the combined soil 
in a plastic bag — that’s your soil sample.
After you’ve collected your sample, consult the instructions from your soil 
test kit or the testing lab.
 
If you’re testing a soil imbalance — a known problem that you’ve identified in 
either pH or nutrients — you may want to test your soil every year because 
changes in pH and most nutrients are gradual. A home testing kit is a good 
way to test a pH imbalance. For nutrients, you may want to do a yearly test at 
a lab until the imbalance (high or low levels of a nutrient) is fixed. To maintain 
balanced soil, test it every 3 to 5 years.
Adjusting soil pH
Most garden soils have a pH between 5.5 and 8.0. This number helps you 
determine when and how to adjust your soil’s pH level. The following 
guidelines help you interpret this number:
 
✓ If the number is below 6, the soil is too acidic, and you need to add 
ground limestone.
 
✓ If the measurement is above 7.5, the soil is too alkaline for most 
vegetables, and you need to add soil sulfur.

227
 Chapter 14: Workin’ the Dirt
In the following sections, I explain how to figure out how much lime or sulfur 
you need to add to your soil and how to apply the materials.
Calculating how much lime or sulfur you need
All Cooperative Extension Service offices, any soil lab, and many lawn and 
garden centers have charts showing how much lime or sulfur to add to 
correct a pH imbalance. The charts tell you how many pounds of material to 
add per 1,000 square feet, so you need to measure the size of your vegetable 
garden first. Then use Tables 14-1 and 14-2 to figure out how much lime or 
sulfur you need to add to your soil.

In general, soils in climates with high rainfall — such as east of the Mississippi 
River (particularly east of the Appalachian Mountains) or in the Pacific 
Northwest — tend to be acidic. West of the Mississippi, where less rainfall 
occurs, soils are more alkaline. But regardless of where you live in the United 
States, you should easily be able to find the lime or sulfur that you need at 
your local garden center.

228
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
Applying lime or sulfur to your soil
The best way to apply sulfur and limestone to your soil is to use a drop 
spreader (the same machine you may use to apply lawn fertilizer). This 
simple machine doesn’t cost very much, and it helps you spread the material 
more evenly. Some nurseries may even loan you a spreader or allow you to 
rent one inexpensively. You also can spread these materials by hand if you’re 
careful and wear gloves. No matter how you spread the materials, make sure 
that you work the soil well afterward.
You can purchase and apply different types of limestone to your soil. The 
type you use may depend on the type of nutrients your soil needs:
 
✓ Dolomitic limestone contains magnesium as well as calcium. Magnesium 
is one of the nutrients that a soil lab may test for, and even though it 
isn’t in the top three (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium), it’s as 
important as calcium for plant growth. Use dolomitic limestone to adjust 
the pH if your soil test shows that your soil is low in magnesium.
 
✓ Pulverized limestone is the most common and inexpensive acid 
neutralizer. Use this limestone if you don’t need to add magnesium to 
your soil.
 
✓ Pelletized pulverized limestone is a little more expensive than ordinary 
pulverized limestone, but it’s cleaner, less dusty, and easier to use than 
both dolomitic and powdered limestone.
Sulfur usually only comes in powdered form or mixed with other nutrients 
such as ammonium sulfate.
 
Your soil uses limestone and sulfur most efficiently when it’s tilled into the soil 
to a depth of 4 to 6 inches.
Adding organic matter 
(aka the dead stuff)
If you’re like most people, your garden doesn’t have perfect loam soil. So to 
fix that mucky clay or loose sand, you need to add organic matter — once-living 
stuff like compost, sawdust, animal manure, ground bark, grass clippings, and 
leaf mold (composted tree leaves). You can’t change the type of soil (clay, 
sand, or loam) you have, but adding organic matter makes your soil more like 
loam, which is perfect for vegetable roots. Even if you have loam soil, you 
still should add organic matter to your soil every year.

229
 Chapter 14: Workin’ the Dirt
Organic matter improves garden soil in the following ways:
 
✓ It helps loosen and aerate clay soil.
 
✓ It improves the water- and nutrient-holding capacity of sandy soil.
 
✓ It provides the once-living material that attracts microorganisms, 
beneficial fungi, worms, and other soil-borne critters that improve the 
health of your vegetables.
 
Work some organic matter into your soil before you plant each season. If 
you’re using unfinished (raw) organic matter like leaves or undecomposed 
manure, add it to your soil at least 1 month before planting. That way it will 
break down before you plant. Add finished compost and manures just before 
planting.
Follow these steps to add organic matter to your garden soil (for information 
on the best kinds of organic matter, see the following sections):
What is organic gardening?
Organic gardening has become a household 
term in the past 10 years. Many people are 
choosing organically grown produce from the 
grocery store because they feel it’s safer and 
healthier. Because organic produce costs 
more than conventionally grown produce, it’s a 
good idea to grow your own. And you’re in luck, 
because throughout this book, I suggest ways 
to grow your vegetables organically.
Organic gardening, in many ways, is just good, 
simple gardening practices and common sense. 
Some of the basic facets of organic gardening 
include the following:
 ✓ Feeding the soil — not just the plants — 
with organic fertilizers, manure, and organic 
matter (Chapter 15)
 ✓ Rotating crops (Chapter 16)
 ✓ Planting a diverse group of crops
 ✓ Solving pest problems by planting disease-
resistant varieties
 ✓ Using barriers (covers that keep bugs away 
from plants)
 ✓ Releasing beneficial insects
 ✓ Using the least harmful biological and plant-
based sprays (Chapter 17)
The USDA now has a certification program for 
organic farms, and the fertilizers and pesticides 
that can be used on these certified farms are 
widely available at local garden centers and 
through the mail. But you don’t have to be 
certified to grow plants organically. My 
philosophy in this book is to emphasize compost 
and soil-building practices and to suggest the 
use of sprays only as a last resort (and even 
then you should use only organic ones).

230
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
1. Add a 1- to 2-inch layer of organic matter to the area where you 
intend to plant your vegetables.
 
 Go for the higher end (2 inches) if your garden is new or if your soil is 
heavy clay or very sandy. Use less if you’ve grown there for years or if 
your soil is loamy and fertile.
 
 You need 3 cubic yards of compost to spread a 1-inch-thick layer over 
1,000 square feet.
 
2. Work in the organic matter to a depth of at least 6 inches.
 
 There’s nothing glamorous about spreading manure. The best way to 
spread organic matter is with a wheelbarrow and a shovel. Work it into 
the soil with a shovel, iron fork, or rototiller.
Another way to add organic matter to your soil is to grow your own. You can 
find out more about growing green manure and cover crops in Chapter 16.
The best choice: Compost
The best organic material to add to your soil is compost. Composting breaks 
down yard waste, agricultural waste, wood scraps, and even sludge into a 
crumbly soil-like material called humus.
Compost is usually clean, easy to use, and available. You can buy it in bags or 
have it delivered by the truckload. Most waste disposal sites make compost 
and sell it relatively cheap. You also can make your own compost; see the 
later section “Making Your Own Compost” for details.
 
Before you buy compost, ask whether the compost contains any heavy metals, 
such as lead, and whether the compost is safe to use in a vegetable garden. 
Your local health department should be able to tell you what levels of lead and 
heavy metals are unsafe. The folks at the waste disposal site also may even be 
able to give you a precise nutrient content if they’ve performed any tests on 
the compost.
Other organic materials, such as sawdust and manure
Using organic materials other than compost — such as sawdust and 
manure — is fine, but these materials present a few problems that compost 
doesn’t. Here are some advantages and disadvantages:
 
✓ Sawdust adds organic matter to your soil, which eventually breaks down 
and forms humus. However, the sawdust also robs the soil of nitrogen 
when it decomposes, so you have to add more fertilizer to compensate 
(see Chapter 15).

231
 Chapter 14: Workin’ the Dirt
 
✓ Livestock manure improves your soil’s nitrogen level (see Chapter 15 
for more information on manure). However, livestock diets often include 
lots of hay that’s full of weed seeds, which may germinate in your vegetable 
garden. Some manures (such as horse manure) add organic matter and 
some nutrients to your soil, but they’re also loaded with bedding 
materials (like dried hay) that cause the same problem that adding 
sawdust causes.
 
If you use manure, make sure it’s fully composted — that is, it has been sitting 
around for a year or two, so it’s decomposed, and the salts have been leached 
out. Too much salt in the soil can be harmful to plants. Good quality compost 
or fully decomposed manure should have a dark brown color, earthy smell, 
and have little original material visible.
Turning Your Soil
After adding nutrients and amendments to your soil, you need to mix them 
up. Turning your soil to mix the amendments enables them to break down 
faster and be available where the roots can use them.
If your soil is dry, water well, and let it sit for a few days before digging. Then, 
to determine whether your soil is ready to turn, take a handful of soil and 
squeeze it. The soil should crumble easily in your hand with a flick of your 
finger; if water drips out, it’s too wet.
 
Don’t work soil that’s too wet. Working soil that’s too wet ruins the soil 
structure — after it dries, the soil is hard to work and even harder to grow 
roots in.
The easiest way to turn your soil, especially in large plots, is with a rototiller 
(or tiller, for short). You can rent or borrow a tiller, or if you’re serious about 
this vegetable-garden business, buy one. I prefer tillers with rear tines and 
power-driven wheels because you can really lean into the machines and use 
your weight to till deeper. If you have a small (less than 100 square feet) 
vegetable plot, consider using a minitiller (see Chapter 20 for more details on 
this tool) or hand dig it if you’re up for a little exercise.
If you use a rototiller, adjust the tines so the initial pass over your soil is fairly 
shallow (a few inches deep). As the soil loosens, set the tines deeper with 
successive passes (crisscrossing at 90-degree angles) until the top 8 to 12 
inches of soil are loosened.

232
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
To turn your soil by hand, use a straight spade and a digging fork. You can 
either dig your garden to one spade’s depth, about 1 foot, or double dig 
(that is, work your soil to a greater depth), going down 20 to 24 inches. 
After turning the soil, level the area with a steel rake, breaking up clods and 
discarding any rocks. Although double digging takes more effort, it enables 
roots to penetrate deeper to find water and nutrients. If you’re double 
digging, dig the upper part of the soil with a straight spade to remove the sod 
and loosen the subsoil (usually any soil below 8 to 12 inches) with a spade. 
Replace the original topsoil often when you loosen the subsoil.
 
Don’t overtill your soil. Tilling to mix amendments or loosen the soil in spring 
or fall is fine, but using the tiller repeatedly in summer to weed or turn beds 
ruins the soil structure and causes the organic matter (the good stuff) to break 
down too fast.
Making Your Own Compost
Making your own compost is a way to turn a wide array of readily available 
organic materials — such as grass clippings, household garbage, and plant 
residue — into a uniform, easy-to-handle source of organic matter for your 
garden. Even though finished compost is usually low in plant nutrients, 
composting enables you to enrich your soil in an efficient, inexpensive way. 
You can add organic matter that isn’t decomposed to your soil and get a 
similar result, but most people find that dark, crumbly compost is easier to 
handle than half-rotten household garbage — yuck.
A compost pile (a pile of organic matter constructed to decompose) can be 
free standing or enclosed and can be made any time of year. However, you’ll 
have the most organic matter in summer and fall when decomposition occurs 
faster due to the warm weather.
Wire fencing makes a good container because it lets in plenty of air. You also 
can purchase easy-to-use composters at garden centers or through mail-order 
catalogs (see Figure 14-3). Some composters simplify the turning process 
(see “Moistening and turning your compost pile” later in this chapter), 
because they rotate on swivels or come apart in sections or pieces. They’re 
easy to use, but usually aren’t large enough for the amount of material 
produced in a large garden. You can build your own composter as well.
In the following sections, I show you how to build, moisten, and turn a 
compost pile; I also warn you about materials that should never, ever go into 
a compost pile.

Building a compost pile
Building a good compost pile involves much more than just tossing organic 
materials in a pile in the corner of your yard, though many people (including 
me at times) use this technique with varied success. Because, you know, 
everything does eventually rot. But to compost correctly, you need to have a 
good size for your pile, add the right types and amount of materials, and 
provide the correct amount of moisture.
 
Here are the characteristics of a well-made pile:
 
✓ It heats up quickly — a sign that the decay organisms are at work.
 
✓ Decomposition proceeds at a rapid rate.
 
✓ The pile doesn’t give off any bad odors.
 
✓ The organisms that do all the decay work take up carbon and nitrogen 
(the stuff they feed on and break down) in proportion to their needs.

234
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
You can easily come up with the correct amounts of materials for a compost 
pile by building the pile in layers. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Choose a well-drained spot in your yard.
 
 If you build your compost pile on a naturally wet spot, the layers will 
become too wet and inhibit the decomposition process.
 
2. Create a 4- to 6-inch layer of “brown” materials that are rich in 
carbon.
 
 These brown materials include roots and stalks of old plants, old grass 
clippings, dried hay, leaves, and so on. The more finely chopped these 
materials are, the more surface area that decay organisms can attack, 
and the faster the materials decompose.
 
3. Add a thin layer of “green” materials that are high in nitrogen.
 
 Green materials include green grass clippings, kitchen vegetable scraps, 
a 2- to 4-inch layer of manure, or a light, even coating of blood meal, 
cottonseed meal, or organic fertilizer high in nitrogen (see Chapter 15 
for more on fertilizers).
 
4. Repeat these green and brown layers (Steps 2 through 3) until the pile 
is no more than 5 feet high.
 
 If a pile is higher than 5 feet, too little oxygen reaches the center of the 
pile, enabling some nasty anaerobic decay organisms to take over and 
produce bad odors; I hate that. Five feet is a good maximum width for 
the pile as well.
Here are a few additional ways to ensure success in your compost pile:
 
✓ Moisten each layer of your compost pile lightly with a watering can as 
you build it. However, don’t let the pile get soggy.
 
✓ Cover each layer with a few inches of garden soil. The soil covers any 
material in the nitrogen layer that may attract flies, such as household 
garbage.
 
✓ Add a dusting of ground limestone or wood ashes on the carbon layer. 
This dusting keeps the compost’s pH around the 6 to 7 mark that your 
plants like.
Avoiding materials that don’t 
belong in a compost pile
 
A well-made pile heats up enough to kill off many insects and disease 
organisms, but the heating isn’t uniform enough to be relied on to kill 
everything that you want it to. So don’t add the following materials to 
your pile:

235
 Chapter 14: Workin’ the Dirt
 
✓ Diseased or infected plant material: Disease organisms may survive the 
composting process and stick around to reinfect your plants when you 
apply the finished compost.
 
✓ Weeds that have gone to seed: The heat may not be high enough to kill 
the weed seeds. And then those weeds will show up in your garden.
 
✓ Pieces of aggressive weeds like quack grass or Bermuda grass: Even a 
small piece of a root can produce a new plant.
 
✓ Grass clippings from lawns treated with herbicides: Some herbicides 
may not break down during the composting process.
 
✓ Meat scraps and fats: They break down slowly and may attract animals 
to the pile.
 
✓ Dog or cat feces: They may carry diseases that can be transmitted to 
humans.
Moistening and turning your compost pile
After you build your compost pile, the decay process begins, causing the 
center of the pile to heat up. Proper moisture helps decay organisms to work 
properly. Following are some ways to keep your compost pile moist:
 
✓ Water the pile as needed. To determine whether you need to water, dig 
about 1 foot into the pile and see if it’s moist.
 
 Be careful not to overwater your pile. It’s easy to do. The water seeps in 
and tends not to evaporate readily, so people think the pile is dry when 
it’s not.
 
✓ If there’s a long dry spell or if you live in a dry-summer area, water the 
entire pile to keep it lightly moist.
 
✓ Make a depression in the top of the pile to collect rainfall.
You also must turn the pile periodically to aerate it, prevent it from 
overheating, and ensure that all the material decomposes uniformly. You can 
turn your compost pile by forking the material from the outside of the pile to 
the center or by moving the pile from one area to another. If you made a pile 
out of wire fencing, simply unhook the ends, pull the fencing apart, and move 
the cylinder a few feet away from the pile. Then fork the materials from the 
pile into the empty wire cylinder.
 
How often you turn the pile and how quickly the compost is done depend 
on how quickly decay takes place. For example, green, succulent organic 
material — like fresh grass clippings — decays faster than dried plant 
material; cool fall temperatures or a spell of rainy days that turn the pile soggy 
slow things down. Follow these guidelines for deciding when to turn your pile:

236
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
✓ If you added only shredded material, the pile may be ready for turning in 
a week.
 
✓ If the pile contains a lot of big pieces of organic material, wait several 
weeks before turning.
 
✓ If the pile heats up and then cools, turn it.
 
✓ Turning the pile two to three times throughout the process is plenty.
You can tell that decay has set in if your pile starts to smell bad. If smells occur, 
hold your nose and fix things by spreading out the pile and reconstructing it.
Your compost is ready for use when the interior of the pile is no longer hot 
and all the material in the pile has broken down into a uniform, dark crumbly 
substance; this process takes about 1 to 2 months. To determine whether 
the pile is no longer hot, feel the interior of the pile with your hand. If you’re 
squeamish, use a compost thermometer (which is available at garden centers).

fter planting your garden, you need to keep your vegetables growing 
vigorously until harvest. Maintaining your vegetable garden is similar to 
running a long-distance road race. After you’re off and running, the key is to 
pace yourself for the whole race and not burn out in the beginning. Gardeners 
face a similar situation. You not only have to have lots of enthusiasm to prepare 
the soil and plant, but you also have to be consistent about checking plants, 
watering, weeding, fertilizing, and harvesting (among other tasks) to get the 
best results. If you lose interest in your garden halfway through the growing 
season, your harvest may be small or poor. Don’t worry though; your garden 
won’t require all your time — just some of it each week.
In this chapter, I tell you everything you need to know to keep your 
vegetables happy — including keeping your soil moist and fertile, adding 
mulch, supporting your plants, and keeping weeds at bay.

Introducing Your Inner Gardener 
to the Watering Basics
Even though Mother Nature is often very generous with rain, she still 
sometimes leaves gardens with a dry spell. Flooding isn’t good for your 
garden, but neither is drought. If your plants don’t have adequate water at 
the right times, they can easily die.
Different crops have different water needs. Some vegetables, like celery, are 
real water lovers and prefer to have moist soil around their roots at all times. 
Shallow-rooted crops (like onions and cabbage) need more careful watering 
during dry spells than deeper-rooted crops (like tomatoes) that can pull 
water from greater depths. Part II provides specific watering information for 
all the different vegetables.
 
You also need to keep in mind a plant’s growth stage when watering. Here are 
some general watering guidelines for different growth stages:
 
✓ Seedlings and germinating seeds: Seedlings with small root systems 
near the soil surface and germinating seeds benefit from frequent, gentle 
watering, which enables them to sprout and emerge quickly. Water once 
a day to a few inches deep if it doesn’t rain. (Chapter 13 has more details 
on seedlings and transplants.)
 
✓ Transplants: Water transplants when they’re first planted in the garden 
and then every few days after that to 6 inches deep or so. Watering 
frequently helps the roots recover from transplant shock.
 
✓ Established plants: Plants that have been in your garden for a few weeks 
and that are beyond transplant shock need to be watered deeply. Try to 
wet the soil at least 6 inches deep. Watering to this depth encourages 
roots to penetrate deeply, where they’re less susceptible to drought. 
Give the soil a chance to dry out slightly (3 to 6 days if it doesn’t rain) 
before watering thoroughly again.
 
When I tell you to water to a certain number of inches, don’t feel like you have 
to guess when you’ve hit the mark; you can dig into the soil with a trowel to 
see how far the water has penetrated.
In the following sections, I explain when to quench your veggies’ thirst and 
provide information on different watering methods. I also give you tips on 
how to conserve water.

239
 Chapter 15: Maintaining Your Vegetable Garden
Knowing when your veggies need a drink
In general, most vegetables use about 1 inch of water per week (1 to 2 inches 
in hot, windy, dry climates). If you don’t get water from rainfall, you have to 
supply it. Here are some general guidelines for determining when your plants 
need water:
 
✓ Your finger is the best indicator of when the soil has dried sufficiently 
to rewater. Dig down several inches into the soil; if the soil is dry to 
your touch 3 to 4 inches down, it’s time to water.
 
✓ Wilting plants can be a sign that your soil needs water. Wilting is when 
the leaves or stems of a plant droop, bend over, and look limp. These 
symptoms, however, can be misleading at times. Some plants, like 
tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants, tend to droop slightly during the 
heat of the day, even if the soil has enough moisture. If your plants don’t 
stand tall and proud and the soil feels dry, add water and watch them 
perk up fast.
 
 Overwatering also causes plants to wilt, so check the soil before watering. 
If the soil is waterlogged, roots die from lack of air. With fewer roots, 
plants can no longer take up the water they need from the soil, and so 
they wilt. Damage from insects and disease also cause wilting.
 
✓ Each vegetable has a critical period when you need to be especially 
careful about watering. If you slack off during these times, your crop 
may be ruined. Table 15-1 shows the important watering periods for 
different types of vegetables.

Discovering ways to water 
your vegetable garden
You can water your vegetable garden several different ways. This section 
discusses some of the basic techniques, from the simplest — furrows — to 
the most complicated — drip irrigation systems.
 
You can measure water flow by attaching an inexpensive flowmeter (available 
at hardware and garden supply stores) to your outdoor spigot. To figure out 
the flow rate at the spigot, turn off all the spigots and read your water meter. 
Then turn on the spigot serving the hose line for 1 minute. Reread the meter 
to find out how much water flows through the hose in 1 minute. You need 
about 60 gallons per 100 square feet of garden to get 1 inch of water.
Furrows
Furrows are shallow trenches between raised beds that channel water to 
plant roots. This watering method is based on an old farmer technique of 
planting on narrow raised mounds or beds and then using furrows to water. 
The beds can be 1 to 3 feet apart — the wider apart they are, however, the 
more water you need to add. You can use a hoe to dig a furrow at planting 

241
 Chapter 15: Maintaining Your Vegetable Garden
time and then plant the seeds or transplants on top of the raised beds, in 
between the furrows.
When you’re ready to water, fill the furrows completely with water and then 
wait a while, or fill them more than once so the water penetrates down as 
well as sideways into the raised soil. Poke around with your finger to make 
sure the water has penetrated the bed.
Furrows work best on level or slightly sloping ground; otherwise, the water 
moves too fast down the furrows without sinking in. This watering technique 
traditionally has been used in arid areas with clay soil, such as the Southwest, 
where little natural rain falls during the growing season and streams or ground 
water can be used in the garden. Furrows don’t work well in sandy soil because 
the water soaks in before it can reach the end of the furrow.
 
Furrows aren’t the most efficient way to water. Here are a few reasons:
 
✓ It takes time for the water to run from one end of a mound or bed to the 
other.
 
✓ The beginning of a row always gets more water than the end.
 
✓ You have to move your hose around a lot to fill each furrow.
 
✓ Water is wasted through evaporation as it’s sitting in the furrow.
Basins
A basin is a donutlike depression around a vegetable plant that you fill with 
water — almost like a circular furrow. You make a basin in a 2-foot-diameter 
circle around the plant. Plastic basins that fit underneath plants such as 
tomatoes and eggplants are sold commercially. These basins concentrate the 
water around the roots of the plant.
 
Homemade basins work particularly well for watering sprawling plants like 
melons and squash early in the season. After the plants mature, however, 
their roots grow out of the diameter of the basin, and the method is no longer 
effective.
Hoses
Watering with a hose is probably the most common way that gardeners 
water. It’s simple, and some might say therapeutic. Who hasn’t seen a 
gardener after a long day at work come home and take some time to hose 
down the garden with a cup of coffee or drink in hand?
However, watering with a hose isn’t the ideal watering system and probably 
is best for watering containers; for watering individual, large plants such as 
tomatoes; and when used in conjunction with the basin method (explained 
in the preceding section). In these situations, you can be sure that you’re 
applying the right amount of water to your plants.

242
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
Unless you check the amount of water you’re applying by digging the soil 
after watering, you may not water your garden evenly with a hose. Some 
areas may have lots of water, whereas other areas may just have water on the 
surface. Also, like overhead sprinklers (described in the next section), using 
a hose is a more wasteful way of watering because much of the water falls in 
pathways or on the lawn around your garden.
 
The best way to water your vegetable garden with a hose is to leave the hose 
running at a trickle in a basin near each plant until the water has soaked down 
at least 6 inches deep.
Sprinklers
A sprinkler, shown in Figure 15-1, is effective for watering vegetables planted 
in sandy soil that absorbs water quickly. It’s also an effective way to water 
a large garden when you’re pressed for time. Just set up the sprinkler, and 
based on the amount of time it takes to water to 6 inches deep (see the 
earlier section “Knowing when your veggies need a drink”), you can set a 
timer and go about other business. However, if you have heavy clay soil that 
absorbs water slowly or if your garden is on a slope, the water may run off 
and not sink into the soil where the plants need it. Instead, it’s best to use 
drip irrigation (see the next section) so the water soaks into the ground.
 
Figure 15-1: 
Watering 
with a 
sprinkler.
 
For vegetable gardens, portable-type sprinklers (versus in-ground permanent 
sprinklers used in lawns) are best. You can move them around in your garden 
to cover a certain area or the whole garden. Some sprinklers throw water 
back and forth, whereas others send it in a circular direction. Choose the 
type that best suits your garden design.

243
 Chapter 15: Maintaining Your Vegetable Garden
 
Constantly wetting the foliage of vegetable plants can encourage disease 
problems. So when you use a sprinkler, water in the morning so the foliage can 
dry before nightfall and so you lose less water to evaporation.
As taller plants such as corn and tomatoes grow, sprinklers tend to be less 
effective because the water hits the foliage, damaging it and not thoroughly 
watering the rest of the garden. Some gardeners use watering towers that 
have an overhead sprinkler attached to the top. You position the sprinkler 
a few feet above the plants, hook it up to a hose, and sprinkle the garden. 
However, even these sprinklers prove to be less effective when plants reach 
above 4 to 5 feet tall. For these taller plants, it’s best to choose one of the 
other watering methods described in this chapter.
Soaker-hose irrigation
A soaker-hose irrigation system consists of a rubber hose perforated with tiny 
pores that leak water, as shown in Figure 15-2. You can lay the hose between 
rows or curve it around plants, similar to how you use a drip irrigation 
system (described in the following section). Water leaks out of the hose and 
onto the soil, leaving your plant foliage dry and reducing evaporation.
 
Figure 15-2: 
Watering 
with a 
soaker 
hose.
 
 
Using a soaker-hose system is easier than using a drip irrigation system 
because it involves fewer parts and no nozzles. Its primary limitation is that it 
works best on flat terrain, often delivering water unevenly on sloped or bumpy 
gardens. It also may clog over time and not deliver water evenly along the 
hose.

244
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
Drip irrigation
A drip irrigation system provides water slowly through holes, or emitters, in 
flexible plastic pipes. Many different drip irrigation systems are available; 
they can consist of a single pipe with flexible lines running off it, or a series 
of pipes. You weave these pipes — which are connected to a water supply, 
a filter, and often a pressure regulator — along rows of plants so the water 
flows directly to the roots of your vegetables, as shown in Figure 15-3.
 
Figure 15-3: 
Watering 
with drip 
irrigation.
 
PVC
pipe
Drip
emitter
This watering technique is the most effective and efficient way to water 
vegetables because water drips right to the roots of the plants and little 
water is wasted on pathways, in between plants, and in between rows. Drip 
irrigation works well even if your garden is on a slope, which poses problems 
for most other systems.
 
The downside to drip irrigation is that it’s more costly than the other methods 
listed in this chapter; it’s also more involved to set up and take down at the 
end of the season. Drip irrigation is best for those gardeners who are into 
technology, who don’t have lots of time to water, and who live in water-
restricted areas.

245
 Chapter 15: Maintaining Your Vegetable Garden
You can wet an entire bed from one end to the other at each watering with 
drip emitters. You snap the emitters in the pipes wherever you want them, 
or you can buy a pipe with emitters already evenly spaced along the length 
of the pipe. The moisture radiates sideways underground and wets the soil 
between emitters.
 
As an alternative to emitters, you may want to use microsprinklers, which are 
tiny sprinklers that hook to plastic pipes like drip emitters. They’re usually 
supported by 12- to 24-inch stakes and cover various-sized areas of soil with a 
fine spray of water. They’re particularly useful for watering closely spaced 
vegetables like lettuce and root crops, or for watering germinating seeds.
Most nurseries sell drip irrigation systems, but you also can purchase them 
through the mail (see the appendix for details). Emitters and microsprinklers 
are available with different application rates, varying by the number of 
gallons applied per hour. Pressure-compensating emitters apply water 
consistently from one end of the line to the other, regardless of pressure 
changes due to uneven ground.
Follow these steps to set up a drip irrigation system in your garden:
 
1. Lay the pipe (or pipes — depending on the system) on top of the soil 
and cover the pipe with plastic mulch, or bury the pipe a few inches 
below the surface of the soil.
 
 Most people like to keep the pipe close to the surface so they can check 
it for clogs and fix breaks.
 
2. If your pipe doesn’t already have emitters in it, snap emitters in the 
pipe wherever you want them.
 
 Position the emitters so they’re close to the bases of your plants.
 
3. Run the drip system for at least several hours a day (2 to 4 hours).
 
 Watch the system carefully the first few times that you water. Dig around 
in your garden to see how far the water travels over a given time period, 
and then adjust your watering schedule in the future.
 
If you live in an area where the soil freezes, don’t leave your drip irrigation 
system or soaker hoses outside in the winter because they may burst. Instead, 
drain the water out, roll up the tubing, and store it in your garage.

Conserving water with a few handy tips
In many areas of the country, restrictions limit the amount of water you can 
use to grow your plants. If you’re in one of these areas, it’s especially important 
that you water smartly (though watering efficiently should be everyone’s 
goal!). Sensible watering will save this precious resource and save you 
money.
Keep these water-saving pointers in mind when tending to your crops:
 
✓ Grow plants that perform better under low water conditions. Some 
drought-resistant food crops you might try include herbs and hot peppers.
 
✓ Plant veggies closer together. Doing so allows you to conserve soil 
moisture and shade the ground, keeping it cool and moist.
 
✓ Consider the time of day that you water, especially if you use a 
sprinkler. You lose less water to evaporation (an important consideration 
in hot, dry climates) if sprinklers operate in the cool of the morning 
rather than during the heat of the afternoon. Watering in the morning 
also gives leaves a chance to dry off before evening; wet foliage is an 
ideal fungus-growing medium.
 
✓ Frequent, shallow waterings do more harm than good. They cause 
roots to develop mainly in the upper few inches of the soil, where 
they’re susceptible to drying out. Instead, go for occasional, deep 
waterings. Deep waterings allow moisture to penetrate deeply into the 
soil. The roots will follow the water, and the plant will be deep rooted 
and less likely to be effected by dry conditions. You’ll water less 
frequently; maybe deeply once per week.
 
✓ If your garden has heavy clay soil or is on a slope, and you find that 
water begins to run off before it penetrates 6 inches deep in the soil, 
try watering at intervals. Water for 10 to 15 minutes, let the water soak 
in for 15 to 20 minutes, and then water again.
 
✓ Try to use soaker hoses and drip irrigation to direct water to the 
plants and not waste it on pathways. Use a timer to turn on the system 
during cool parts of the day for only as long as needed.
 
✓ Collect rainwater from roofs and store it to be used in the garden. In 
some areas you can even use gray waste water from your home in your 
yards. Check with your local water municipality for regulations on using 
gray water.

beds, check out Sustainable Landscaping For Dummies by Owen Dell (Wiley).

 Chapter 15: Maintaining Your Vegetable Garden
Keeping Your Plants Cozy and 
Weed Free with Mulch
Mulch is any material, organic or inorganic, that you place over the surface of 
soil, usually directly over the root zone of growing plants. It has many benefits 
depending on the type used. Mulch suppresses weeds, holds in moisture, 
modifies soil temperature, lessens the chances of certain diseases attacking 
your plants, and adds an attractive look to your garden.
Some people use compost as a mulch, but you have to remember that 
compost has a different purpose than mulch. Compost is added and mixed 
into the soil to add nutrients and increase the workability of soil (water-
holding capacity, aeration, and so on). Mulch generally doesn’t add nutrients, 
but it helps hold in the ones already in the soil and prevents undesirables 
from attacking your growing plants. (You can read more about compost in 
Chapter 14.)
You can choose from two basic types of mulch: organic and inorganic. For 
vegetable growers, each type of mulch has a unique purpose, as described in 
the following sections.
Spreading organic mulch
Organic mulch includes grass clippings, compost, leaf mold, pine needles, 
shredded bark, nut shells, cotton gin waste, straw hay, grain and fruit 
byproducts, composted manure, mushroom compost, peat moss, and 
sawdust. Some of these mulches are easier to find in different parts of the 
country. You can even use newspaper as an organic mulch; black-and-white 
newspaper print is perfectly safe to use in your garden, and most colored 
inks are soybean based and biodegradable (see Chapter 14 for more on using 
newspaper as mulch).
 
Generally, a 2- to 4-inch layer of organic mulch, spread evenly on the ground 
beneath your plants, is sufficient. However, you may have to replenish the 
mulch during the growing season, especially in hot summer areas, because 
many organic mulches break down quickly.
Using organic mulch in your vegetable garden has many benefits:
 
✓ It conserves water by reducing the soil temperature and evaporation. It 
also keeps the soil cool by buffering direct sunlight.

248
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
✓ It prevents wild fluctuations in soil moisture levels that can really spell 
disaster in hot weather.
 
✓ It smothers weed seeds and prevents them from germinating. Any weeds 
that do come up in loose mulch are easy to pull.
 
✓ As the mulch breaks down, it adds nutrients and improves the texture of 
the soil that it covers.
 
✓ Organic mulch looks good and makes the ground tidy and clean.
 
The following list includes some of the downsides of organic mulches. As 
minor as they are, they may lead you to choose one type of organic mulch 
over another:
 
✓ Bark mulches, such as pine, are quite acidic. So if you use them, 
keep a close eye on the pH level of your soil and correct it accordingly. 
(Chapter 14 tells you how to test soil pH.) Also, the latest trend is 
artificially colored mulches. I’d avoid these brightly colored mulches for 
your veggies, because they may contain potentially harmful chemicals 
that can leach into your soil. Choose natural bark mulches instead.
 
✓ Grass clippings decay quickly and must be replenished often. 
Fortunately, grass clippings are usually pretty abundant. But if the grass 
goes to seed before you cut it, you may end up with grass growing in 
your vegetable garden. Also, make sure that no herbicides (weed killers) 
have been used on your lawn because the residue can damage or kill 
vegetables; if you have your lawn treated regularly, use another type of 
mulch. Likewise, hay mulch often has weed seeds in it, so use cleaner 
straw mulch if available.
 
✓ Some organic mulches — such as fresh sawdust — rob nitrogen from 
the soil as they break down. You may have to add supplemental 
nitrogen to your vegetables if they grow mysteriously slow or start to 
turn yellow. (I discuss fertilizers in detail later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Some organic mulches, such as peat moss or leaves, can pack down 
or get hard and crusty when exposed to weather. Water may not 
penetrate these mulches, running off the soil instead of soaking into 
the roots. My suggestion is to avoid peat moss; or at least mix it with 
another organic mulch such as sawdust. Don’t forget that peat is also 
darn expensive.
 
✓ Some lightweight mulches, like straw or cocoa hulls, can blow around 
in the wind. You may want to avoid them if you live in a windy area.
 
✓ Organic mulch, which keeps the soil cool, may slow the growth and 
maturity of warm-season crops such as tomatoes and melons. This 
cooling can be especially problematic in areas with cool summers. 
However in very hot-summer areas of the country, organic mulches work 
to keep the roots of even warm-season crops cool and healthy.

249
 Chapter 15: Maintaining Your Vegetable Garden
 
✓ Composted manures may burn young vegetables if used as mulch 
because the manures vary in the amount of nitrogen they contain. If 
you want to use composted manure, mix it with three times the volume 
of another organic mulch before applying it.
You can purchase organic mulches like shredded bark, compost, and leaf 
mold in bags or sometimes in bulk from nurseries and garden centers. Grass 
clippings, compost, and wood chips come free from your yard or garden.
Laying inorganic mulch
Inorganic mulch includes things like plastic, landscape fabric, and believe it 
or not, old carpet. I explain how to use all types of inorganic mulches in the 
following sections.
Plastic
 
Plastic is the most-used inorganic mulch for vegetable gardens. Mulching with 
plastic (see Figure 15-4) works best when you install drip irrigation or a soaker 
hose underneath the plastic before planting. Otherwise, watering is difficult. 
(You can place the irrigation on top of the plastic, which enables you to more 
easily check for clogs, but you have to run individual emitters to each plant.) 
Plastic doesn’t work well with vegetables planted very close together, such as 
root crops.
 
Figure 15-4: 
Planting in 
black plastic 
mulch.
 
 
The color of plastic mulch you use depends on what you’re growing. Some 
vegetables grow better with certain colored plastics. For example:

250
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
✓ Tomatoes, eggplants, and strawberries grow best with red plastic mulch.
 
✓ Melons grow well with dark green or IRT (infrared transmitting) plastic 
mulch.
 
✓ Peppers like a silver-colored mulch.
 
✓ White plastic is good for hot climates where you want to stop weeds 
from growing but not heat up the soil.
 
✓ Black plastic is good for weed control and warming soils. It can be used 
on many vegetables including cucumbers and squash.
To mulch with plastic, follow these steps:
 
1. Purchase rolls or sheets of 2- to 4-millimeter plastic (the thicker the 
better).
 
 You can find the thickness of the plastic on its label. Purchase plastic at 
garden centers or hardware stores, or check the appendix for sources of 
various colored mulches.
 
2. If you’re using irrigation under the plastic, lay down your drip 
irrigation and turn it on for several hours.
 
 Note where the wet spots are in the soil. Adjust the drip hose so water 
doesn’t pool in certain areas, but is evenly distributed. See the earlier 
section on drip irrigation for more details on installing this type of 
watering system.
 
3. A week or two before planting, water the entire area with a hose or 
sprinkler so it’s wet to 6 inches deep.
 
 Roll out the plastic over the planting area and cover the edges of the 
plastic with soil.
 
4. Cut holes in the plastic where you want to plant your transplants.
 
 You can sow seed this way as well; just make sure that the seed can get 
through the holes in the plastic after it germinates.
 
5. Plant your seeds or transplants in the holes.
 
 Make sure you plant in wet spots; otherwise, the plants may not get 
enough water.
 
If you live in a climate that gets very hot in the summer (Texas, for example), 
after the weather starts to warm, you may want to cover black plastic with an 
organic mulch to prevent the soil from getting too warm. Or consider using 
white plastic instead.
Unless you have a problem with the irrigation system, you usually don’t have 
to remove the plastic until the end of the season.

 Chapter 15: Maintaining Your Vegetable Garden
Other inorganic mulches
Beside plastics, you also can use the following inorganic mulches in your 
vegetable garden:
 
✓ Cardboard: Even though it’s biodegradable, cardboard takes so long to 
decompose that I treat it as an inorganic mulch. You can cut cardboard 
boxes to fit in pathways. If you don’t like their look, cover them with hay 
or straw.
 
✓ Landscape fabric: This inorganic mulch doesn’t warm the soil as much 
as black plastic, but it’s permeable, enabling you to water through it. 
It also does a good job of keeping down weeds. You can find landscape 
fabric at your local nursery. You apply landscape fabric the same way 
that you do plastic (see the preceding section).
 
✓ Rug strips: Roll out 3-foot rug strips and place them nap side down, 
leaving about 6 inches of open soil between strips for irrigation and 
planting. Even though rug strips look pretty weird in a garden, they 
keep the weeds down and make a nice path.
Deciding which mulch to use
Choosing a mulch and deciding when to use it in your vegetable garden 
depends on the type of vegetables that you grow and when you plant them. 
Check out these mulching tips for different types of vegetables:
 
✓ Cool-season vegetables planted in early spring: You want the sun to 
warm your soil in the spring because lots of sun helps young plants get 
off to a fast start. Here are a few mulching pointers for these vegetables:
 
• Lay down organic mulch when the soil starts to warm and when 
the plants need regular water. If you mulch too early, the soil stays 
too cold and wet for proper root growth.
 
• In areas with short growing seasons, you can plant broccoli, 
cauliflower, and cool-season plants through plastic. Cover the 
plastic with organic matter when the weather warms to keep the 
soil cool.
 
✓ Cool-season vegetables planted in late summer or early fall: With these 
vegetables, you want the cooling effect, so put down an organic mulch 
right after planting. Here are a few other things to keep in mind:
 
• When the weather starts to cool, rake off or remove the organic 
mulch so the soil warms.
 
• You can plant through plastic late in the year, but you should cover 
it with an organic mulch immediately so the soil doesn’t get too 
hot. Then remove the organic mulch when the weather cools and 
let the plastic warm the soil through harvest.

252
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
• Many root crops can be stored in the ground well into winter if you 
cover them with a thick organic mulch like straw. Applied before 
the ground freezes, the mulch keeps the soil loose and unfrozen so 
you can dig the vegetables later into winter.
 
✓ Warm-season vegetables planted in spring: With these vegetables, 
keep the ground clear if you’re planting really early — the more heat the 
better. Planting through plastic works in early spring. In hot climates, 
apply an organic mulch when the weather starts to get really warm in 
summer.
Determining Important Nutrients 
Your Soil Needs
Sixteen elements are essential for healthy plant growth. Of these elements, 
plants especially need carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in large quantities. 
They also need energy from sunlight for photosynthesis, the process by which 
plants use carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil to produce 
sugars that enable them to grow. Nature — and your conscientious watering — 
supply these elements.
Plants also need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in relatively large 
quantities. Plants take up these three nutrients — often called macronutrients — 
from the soil. If your soil doesn’t contain enough of these nutrients, you can 
supply them by fertilizing, which I discuss in detail later in this chapter.
The following sections list important nutrients that your plants need, along 
with information to help you determine when you need to add nutrients to 
your soil. To find out what quantities to add, refer to the chapters on indi-
vidual vegetables in Part II. (Chapter 14 has details on soil pH and pointers 
on performing soil tests.)
Macronutrients
Nitrogen (N), a key component of proteins and chlorophyll (the plant pigment 
that plays a vital role in photosynthesis), is responsible for the healthy, green 
color of your plants. Nitrogen is a volatile creature; it easily moves around in 
the soil and can leach away from plant roots as a result of rain or watering. 
Therefore, you need to be sure that your plants receive a steady supply of 
nitrogen all season long.

253
 Chapter 15: Maintaining Your Vegetable Garden
 
✓ How to detect too little: Plants with a nitrogen deficiency usually show 
yellowing (in older leaves first) and slowed growth. However, with plants 
like tomatoes, a nitrogen deficiency may first appear as a reddening of 
the stems and the undersides of the leaves.
 
✓ How to detect too much: A plant with too much nitrogen has 
soft-textured, dark green foliage and an underdeveloped root system, 
and flowering and fruiting are delayed. Too much nitrogen fertilizer, 
especially when plants are young, can actually burn the roots and kill 
them. Because nitrogen leaches out of the soil quickly, if you have too 
much, stop fertilizing, wait, and eventually the problem will solve itself.
 
✓ How to add it to your soil: You can supplement soil nitrogen by adding 
organic fertilizers, decomposing organic matter, or composted manure.
Phosphorus (P) helps promote good root growth, increased disease 
resistance, and fruit and seed formation. It’s less available in cooler soils, 
so adding a fertilizer containing phosphorus in spring is a good idea.
 
✓ How to detect too little: Plants lacking in phosphorus are stunted and 
sport dark green foliage and purplish stems and leaves (on the older 
leaves first). Soil pH affects the availability of phosphorus to plants; a pH 
of 6 to 7.5 keeps it available.
 
✓ How to detect too much: Too much phosphorous is a problem because 
it can cause zinc and iron deficiencies, and it can leach out of the soil and 
pollute streams and lakes. Signs of zinc or iron deficiencies appear as 
discolored or poorly formed leaves and reduced growth and production.
 
✓ How to add it to your soil: Sources of phosphorus include minerals, 
organic matter, inorganic fertilizers (such as rock phosphate), and 
organic fertilizers (such as bone meal).
 
 Unlike nitrogen, phosphorus doesn’t move quickly through soil. So, 
add a fertilizer containing phosphorus to the root zone before planting 
(instead of sprinkling it on the soil surface).
Potassium (K) promotes vigorous growth and disease resistance.
 
✓ How to detect too little: The first sign of a deficiency is slowed growth; 
brown leaf edges and deformed yellow leaves can indicate a severe 
deficiency.
 
✓ How to detect too much: Too much potassium can create nutrient 
imbalances in the plant and stunt its growth.
 
✓ How to add to your soil: Soil minerals provide potassium, as do organic 
matter and inorganic fertilizers, such as green sand and granite dust.

254
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
Secondary nutrients and micronutrients
Calcium, magnesium, and sulfur are known as secondary nutrients. Plants 
need them in substantial quantities, but not to the same extent that they 
need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
 
✓ How to detect too little: Most alkaline soils contain these secondary 
nutrients naturally, and few soils are deficient in sulfur. Most home 
garden soils contain these nutrients. But if you’ve eliminated other 
possibilities and you suspect a problem, a soil lab can do tests on your 
plant leaves to detect any deficiencies.
 
✓ How to add them to your soil: In regions where the soil is acidic, liming 
to keep your soil’s pH in a good growth range provides adequate calcium 
and magnesium (the latter if you use dolomitic limestone). See Chapter 
14 for more on liming.
Micronutrients (iron, manganese, copper, boron, molybdenum, chlorine, and 
zinc) are elements that plants need in tiny amounts. Too much of one of these 
elements is often as harmful as too little.
 
✓ How to detect too little or too much: A micronutrient deficiency or 
excess may mean that your soil is too acidic or too alkaline, so you can 
correct the problem by changing the pH rather than by adding more 
nutrients. Deficiencies and excesses most often are noted on plants that 
are growing poorly and through soil tests.
 
✓ How to add them to your soil: Sometimes, changing the pH sufficiently 
to increase micronutrient levels isn’t practical, or you may need to give 
a plant a micronutrient quickly while you try to change the soil pH. In 
such cases, micronutrients are applied as chelates. Chelates are added 
to other chemicals, in this case micronutrients, to keep them available 
to plants when soil conditions are unfavorable. Apply chelated 
micronutrients to your soil, or better yet, spray them on plant foliage.
Fertilizing Your Vegetable Garden
Even if you have the healthiest soil around, growing vegetables is an intensive 
process that strips many important nutrients from the soil. So you need to 
add some fertilizer to your soil to keep it in optimum shape to feed your plants.
How much fertilizer you add depends on the soil and the plants you’re 
growing. So it’s difficult to generalize across the board on what type of 
fertilizer to choose and how much to apply. Soil tests are a great way to 
know what to add. Refer to Chapter 14 for more on soil tests.

255
 Chapter 15: Maintaining Your Vegetable Garden
Examining a fertilizer label
 
Commercial fertilizers are labeled with three numbers that indicate the 
fertilizer’s nutrient content (see Figure 15-5). The first number indicates the 
percentage of nitrogen (N), the second number shows the percentage of 
phosphate (the type of phosphorus, P2O5), and the third number represents 
the percentage of potash (the form of potassium used, K2O). (I explain these 
nutrients in detail in the earlier section “Macronutrients.”)
 
Figure 15-5: 
A fertil-
izer bag is 
labeled with 
nutrient 
content.
 
Phosphate
Nitrogen
Potash
For example, a 5-10-5 fertilizer contains 5 percent nitrogen, 10 percent 
phosphate, and 5 percent potash, and it’s called a complete fertilizer because 
it contains some of each type of nutrient. In contrast, bone meal has an 
analysis of 4-12-0. It’s a good source of phosphate but doesn’t provide any 
potash. The other materials in a commercial fertilizer that the analysis 
numbers don’t account for are generally filler — unimportant materials that 
add bulk to the bag so the fertilizer is easier to spread.
How much fertilizer do you use? Soil tests are the best way to correct 
deficiencies (see Chapter 14 for details), but fertilizer bags also give general 
dosage recommendations for gardens. Most fertilizer recommendations 
for maintenance fertilization (rather than to correct a deficiency) are made 
according to how much nitrogen a crop needs. So, for example, if you have 
a recommendation for 3 pounds of 5-10-10 fertilizer per 100 square feet, but 
the fertilizer that you have on hand is 5-5-5 fertilizer, apply 3 pounds of 5-5-5. 
Even though the 5-5-5 fertilizer’s percentage of phosphate and potash is less 
than that of the 5-10-10, it offers the same recommended amount of nitrogen.

256
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
Choosing a fertilizer
Most home gardeners can grow a perfectly beautiful and productive garden 
using organic principles. In the last 20 years, an explosion of organic prod-
ucts (such as fertilizers) has hit the market, making gardening with this 
method much more accessible. I choose to garden with organic fertilizers, 
and I explain why in this section; I also warn you of the dangers of chemical 
fertilizers.
Organic fertilizers
Organic fertilizers — animal and green manure, blood meal, fish emulsion, 
cottonseed meal, granite dust, and rock phosphate — have several advantages:
 
✓ Many organic fertilizers contribute organic matter to your soil, improving 
its structure, feeding soil microbes, fighting fungal and bacterial diseases, 
and contributing micronutrients.
 
✓ Most organic fertilizers supply a slow but steady diet for plants.
 
✓ Some organic fertilizers, such as manure and compost, may be 
inexpensive — or free if you create them yourself.
 
✓ Complete organic fertilizers, such as 5-5-5, are now more widely 
available and have higher concentrations of nutrients than in the past, 
making them easy-to-use alternatives to chemical fertilizers.
 
However, it’s not all sun and roses when using organic fertilizers. Here are 
some disadvantages:
 
✓ Some organic fertilizers, such as manures and compost, are bulky and 
difficult to store and transport.
 
✓ Their slow release of nutrients, in some cases dependent on the action 
of soil microorganisms, may take too long to remedy a dire situation 
when an adequate nutrient supply is needed.
 
✓ Many organic fertilizers are lower in nutrient content than their chemical 
equivalents, and the contents may vary depending on the weather and 
conditions where the fertilizers were produced. So you may not be 
exactly sure how much to put on your garden.
Chemical fertilizers
Chemical fertilizers are synthetically manufactured. They include elements 
such as sodium nitrate, potassium chloride, and superphosphate. Chemical 
fertilizers come in liquid, granular, powder, or pellet form. You can fertilize 
when you water with a watering can, using a liquid fertilizer. Or you can 
sprinkle some granular fertilizer around each plant.

257
 Chapter 15: Maintaining Your Vegetable Garden
 
Chemical fertilizers are widely available, less expensive than organic fertilizers, 
quick acting, and easy to use, but I believe that the disadvantages of using 
chemical fertilizers far outweigh the advantages. Here’s why:
 
✓ Chemical fertilizers add no organic matter to your soil and contribute 
nothing to improving soil structure. In fact, some research suggests 
that chemical fertilizers actually harm the microorganisms in the soil, 
making the soil less able to support long-term plant growth.
 
✓ Chemical fertilizers are concentrated and fast acting, but they have no 
long-term benefits for your soil. It’s like taking a vitamin for your health 
versus eating a good meal.
 
✓ Manufacturing chemical fertilizers requires large amounts of energy, 
usually supplied by nonrenewable resources. This massive use of 
energy increases pollution, global warming, and our carbon footprint. 
Even though some commercial organic fertilizers, such as rock phosphate 
and green sand, also are manufactured and require energy inputs, home 
gardeners can instead choose to use locally made compost and manures 
to get the nutrients they need for their gardens.
Side-dressing
Depending on the crops you grow and the type of soil you have, you may 
need to add repeat doses of fertilizer throughout the growing season — a 
practice called side-dressing. For example, because sandy soils don’t hold 
nutrients well, giving plants small, regular fertilizer applications ensures a 
steady supply of nutrients.
In the following sections, I describe specific fertilizers and methods that are 
best for side-dressing and explain how frequently you should side-dress your 
veggies. For information on fertilizing vegetables growing in containers, see 
Chapter 18.
Fertilizers and techniques that work well for side-dressing
Granular organic fertilizers, such as 5-5-5, are a good choice for side-dressing 
most root and fruiting crops. Use 1 to 2 tablespoons per plant, or 1 to 2 
pounds for every 25 feet in a row.
 
Depending on plant spacing, side-dress either in a narrow furrow down a row 
or around each individual plant (refer to Figure 15-6). In either case, spread 
granular fertilizer (which is easier to use than liquid fertilizer) at least 6 to 8 
inches away from plant stems. Rake the fertilizer into the soil and then water.

258
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
Figure 15-6: 
Ways to 
fertilize 
vegetable 
plants.
 
 
For leafy green crops, fish emulsion is a quick-acting, highly soluble organic 
source of nitrogen that gives your greens a boost, especially if they’re turning a 
pale green color. You can add micronutrients to this fertilizer by mixing it with 
seaweed. Add this liquid fertilizer to your watering can following the directions 
on the label. As you water, pour this solution around the bases of the plants 
and on the leaves.
Knowing when to side-dress
 
Too much fertilizer can be more harmful than too little. Excess fertilizer 
accumulates in the soil in the form of salts and damages plant roots. So be 
sure that growing conditions enable plants to use the fertilizer that you apply. 
For example, don’t add fertilizer during a dry spell if you can’t irrigate your 
garden, because without adequate soil moisture, roots can’t take up nutrients. 
And if cool weather causes your plants to grow slowly and need less fertilizer, 
go easy on the fertilizer until the temperature warms up or you’ll be wasting it.
The kind of plants that you grow makes a difference in how often you 
side-dress. Plants that take a long time to mature (such as tomatoes and 
eggplants) and heavy feeders (like corn) generally benefit more from 
side-dressing than quick-maturing crops that fix their own nitrogen — such 
as lettuce, or legumes like peas and beans. See Table 15-2 for some general 
side-dressing guidelines.

Give ’Em Something to Lean On: 
Supporting Your Vegetables
Some vegetables, like peas and beans, have climbing habits that require 
some type of support to grow on. Other vegetables — including tomatoes, 
cucumbers, and even melons — have sprawling habits that benefit from some 
type of staking or support. Staking plants, tying them to a trellis, or growing 
them inside wire cylinders reduces disease problems because it allows for 
better air circulation and keeps the fruits off the ground where they may be 
attacked by bugs or become sunburned. (Fruit skins get sunburned due to 
sudden exposure to strong sun and eventually rot.) Supported plants also are 
easier to harvest and require less space to grow (they go up instead of out).
Figure 15-7 shows some techniques for supporting vegetables, but you can 
find more in Chapter 16. In the following sections, I provide some suggestions 
for supporting different types of vegetables.
Beans and peas
Twining or clinging plants like beans and peas grow best when they’re 
supported by some type of string trellis. I like to use an A-frame string trellis, 
which enables me to grow plants on both sides, but single poles are fine, too. 
Making an A-frame string trellis is easy; just follow these steps:
 
1. Using at least six 2-by-2-inch redwood or cedar stakes, build two 
6-by-6-foot squares.
Proceed carefully: Using wood ashes as a fertilizer
Wood ashes are a source of potash and phos-
phate, although the exact amounts of these 
nutrients depend on the type of wood burned 
(hardwoods generally contain more nutrients 
than softwoods), the degree of combustion, 
and where the wood was stored (for example, 
dry storage prevents nutrient leaching). A gen-
eral analysis is usually in the range of 0 percent 
nitrogen, 1 to 2 percent phosphate, and 4 to 10 
percent potash. But the major benefit of wood 
ashes is as a liming agent to raise the pH of the 
soil. Naturally, if you live in an area where soils 
are alkaline, don’t use wood ashes as a soil 
amendment; they raise the pH even higher.
Apply wood ashes to your soil in moderation 
(no more than 10 to 20 pounds per 1,000 square 
feet of garden) because they may contain small 
amounts of heavy metals, such as cadmium 
and copper. Remember: These metals build up 
in plants if you add too much wood ash to the 
soil and can kill the plants — or harm you if you 
eat lots of those plants.

Cucumbers on a trellis
Staked tomato
Pole bean teepee
 
 Redwood and cedar stakes are naturally rot resistant and good choices.
 
2. Secure the corners of the squares with metal corner braces and 
connect the two squares on one side with sturdy hinges.
 
 The hinges enable you to easily move or store the trellis.
 
3. Hammer small nails at 2- to 4-inch intervals along the top and bottom 
of the trellis.
 
 Don’t pound the nails in all the way; leave about 1 inch sticking out.
 
4. Weave some sturdy twine or string up and down the trellis, between 
the nails.
 
 Bingo; you have an A-frame string trellis.
 Handmade wooden teepees are a great way to support your beans, and kids 
love them because they’re great places to hide. Here’s how to construct your 
own teepee:
 
1. Using four to six 2-by-2-inch redwood or cedar stakes that are 6 to 8 
feet long, form a conelike teepee.
 
2. Tie the stakes together with twine at the top of the teepee.
 
3. Run some string or twine around the bottom of the teepee, securing 
the string or twine at each stake with a small nail.

262
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
4. Run more string back and forth around the stakes, from the top of the 
teepee to the bottom, leaving several inches between each run.
Leave one side of the teepee open so your kids can get inside, and then plant 
beans around the base of the teepee. In time, the beans will cover the trellis, 
creating a great fort for your kids.
Melons and cucumbers
You can plant bush varieties of melons and cucumbers inside small (2- to 
3-foot-high) wire cylinders similar to those used for tomatoes (see the next 
section). But for more vigorous varieties, I like to use a sturdier version of 
the A-frame trellis that’s used for beans and peas (see the previous section). 
Instead of using string, I cut 6-foot-by-6-foot pieces of hog fencing (it has 
6-inch squares) and nail them to each side of the trellis. The wire provides 
better support for heavy fruit (like melons) than string does, and the wide-
open fencing doesn’t constrict the growth of the fruit (so you get straighter 
cucumbers). You can purchase hog fencing at agricultural stores.
 
You also can grow melons on a trellis. Choose small-fruited varieties of 
watermelon or any variety of cantaloupe, and plant your seeds at the base of 
the trellis. Tie the vines to the trellis as they grow. After a fruit forms, slip the 
leg of an old nylon stocking over the fruit, tying the bottom of the stocking 
in a knot. Then tie the other end of the stocking to the wire trellis so that the 
fruit is supported. As the melon grows, the stocking expands and supports the 
fruit, which may break off otherwise. Flip to Chapter 8 to see how this support 
system looks.
Tomatoes
You can support tomato plants several different ways:
 
✓ Tie them to stakes, which you pound in the ground next to the plants.
 
✓ Grow them inside wire cages, which you can buy at nurseries or easily 
build yourself out of hog fencing.
 
 If you’re growing indeterminate varieties, which keep growing and 
producing fruit all season, choose or build cages large enough to 
support the huge plants that will grow. Also be sure to secure them to 
the ground well so they don’t blow over during a summer thunderstorm. 
(You can read more on indeterminate tomatoes in Chapter 4.)
 
✓ Construct string or wire trellises, like you do for beans and peas.

263
 Chapter 15: Maintaining Your Vegetable Garden
Fighting Weed Wars
A weed is any plant that’s growing where you don’t want it to. Some weeds 
are worse than others, but in general, you don’t want any weeds in your 
vegetable garden because they compete with vegetables for light, water, and 
nutrients. If you have a lot of weeds, you’ll have weaker plants and a less 
substantial harvest. Besides, weeds look terrible.
The key to battling weeds is to get to them early before they’re firmly 
established. When they’re young, weeds are easier to pull, easier to till under, 
and less likely to produce seeds that cause problems down the road. In the 
following sections, I show you how to fight weeds before and after you plant 
your veggies.
Making a preemptive strike on weeds
You can reduce weeds in your vegetable beds many different ways. Here are 
some things that you can do before planting your garden:
 
✓ Presprout weed seeds. Presprouting — forcing weed seeds to germinate 
before you plant so you can kill them early — really cuts down on the 
number of weeds in your beds. Follow these steps:
 
1. Prepare your planting bed several weeks before you’re ready to 
plant.
 
 Refer to Chapter 3 for details on planning and preparing your beds 
for planting.
 
2. Water the soil well and wait a few days.
 
 Presto, young weeds begin popping up.
 
3. Kill the weeds.
 
 You can choose to kill the weeds one of two ways: pull them out by 
hand, or rake the bed lightly to uproot the seedlings and then let 
them dry out to die.
 
 However you get rid of the young weeds, disturb the soil as little as 
possible when you do it; otherwise, you’ll bring more seeds to the 
surface.
 
✓ Plan for easy weeding. Leave enough room between rows so you can 
weed the soil easily.

264
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
✓ Solarize the soil. When you solarize the soil, you use the power of the 
sun to kill weeds. This technique works best in the middle of summer in 
hot climates like Arizona and Florida. The only downside to solarizing is 
that it takes a while. Follow these steps to solarize your soil:
 
1. Prepare your bed for planting and water it well.
 
2. Dig a 6-to-12-inch-deep trench around the perimeter of the bed.
 
3. Cover the entire bed with thick clear plastic (4 millimeters) 
and place the edges of the plastic in the trenches and fill the 
trenches with soil. Then wait.
 
 The temperature gets so hot underneath the plastic that it kills 
insects, disease organisms, and weeds. It usually takes a few 
months of solarizing to get a beneficial effect.
 
✓ Plant your vegetables at the proper time of year. That way they get off 
to a fast start, and weeds have a harder time catching up with them. See 
Chapter 3 for details.
Battling weeds after planting
If you come across weeds after you plant your crops, you have several 
choices for eliminating them:
 
✓ Mulch your beds. Applying a layer of thick organic mulch is one of the 
best ways to battle weeds. Even if mulch doesn’t smother the weeds 
and their seeds, the weeds that do come up are easy to pull. Planting 
through plastic is also an effective way to keep weeds from becoming 
a problem. See the earlier section “Keeping Your Plants Cozy and Weed 
Free with Mulch” for more information.
 
✓ Pull the weeds by hand. While they’re young, weeds come out of the 
ground easily. Get ’em roots and all, whenever you see them. If you can’t 
pull out the roots by hand, use a trowel.
 
✓ Cultivate the soil. Simply hoeing or lightly turning the soil between 
vegetables exposes the weeds’ roots and kills many of them. Cultivating is 
most effective when it’s done often (a few times a week in the first month 
or so of gardening) and early when the weeds are small. Some cultivating 
tools are designed especially for this purpose; see Chapter 20 for details.
 
✓ Keep garden paths clean. Try to keep your garden paths as weed free as 
possible; otherwise, weeds will creep into your planting beds. Try 
covering the paths with a thick mulch to keep weeds from becoming 
established.
 
✓ Make sure the areas around the garden are weed free. If you’re 
growing vegetables near a field or weedy woodland edge, try to mow a 
wide strip between your garden and the field so the weed seeds can’t 
blow in as easily. It won’t stop all of them, but every little bit helps.

Surveying Some Cool 
Farmer Techniques
In This Chapter
▶ Growing plants that improve the soil
▶ Planting schemes that increase harvest and reduce pests
▶ Using the phases of the moon to determine when to plant
P
eople have been growing vegetables for eons — probably since the days 
of Adam and Eve, though you usually associate them with fruits, not 
vegetables.
Over the years, farmers, and even gardeners for that matter, have tried 
almost anything to get better, bigger, and earlier harvests. Some of these 
techniques, such as planting according to the cycles of the moon, are rooted 
more in mysticism than in hard science. Others, such as using cover crops 
and succession planting, are commonsense approaches to farming that are 
now established practices in modern agriculture. They’re also useful techniques 
for home vegetable gardeners.
In this chapter, you can take a look at some cool farming techniques — some 
based on fact, some on fancy — and decide whether they’ll work for you.
Adding Nutrients and Stability with 
Cover Crops and Green Manures
A cover crop is a general term for any plant grown to prevent erosion, 
improve soil structure, and maintain soil fertility. Sometimes, you’ll hear 
cover crops referred to as green manures. Green manures are cover crops 
that are used primarily to add nutrients to the soil and are tilled into the soil 
when they’re still green. Green manures are the most useful cover crop for 
vegetable gardeners.

Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
The advantages of using cover crops are impressive:
 
✓ They add organic matter to the soil. By adding this matter to the soil, 
you improve water retention, aeration, and drainage.
 
✓ They prevent erosion. Cover crops prevent erosion by holding soil in 
place in windy or wet areas.
 
✓ They loosen compacted soils. Certain cover crops, such as oilseed 
radish and bell beans, have aggressive taproots (roots that grow deeply 
into the soil), sometimes reaching 3 feet deep, that help break up 
compacted soils.
 
✓ They add nutrients to the soil. Legume cover crops, such as hairy vetch 
and crimson clover, through a symbiotic relationship (I scratch your 
back, you scratch mine) with rhizobium bacteria on their roots, convert 
atmospheric nitrogen into a type that they can use to grow. The process 
is called nitrogen fixing (see Chapter 7 for more on this relationship). 
When the cover crop is tilled into the soil, the nitrogen is released for 
the next crop. Also, taprooted cover crops bring minerals to the surface 
from deep below the soil.
 
✓ They help control weeds. Cover crops control weeds by shading the 
weed seeds so they can’t grow or by just being more aggressive than the 
weeds. Some crops, such as buckwheat, actually exude chemicals that 
inhibit weed growth.
 
✓ They attract beneficial insects. Many cover crops attract good bugs 
that prey on garden pests, reducing insect problems on your vegetables.
If you want a healthier, more productive garden, and you have room, include 
cover crops each year in different parts of your veggie garden. In the following 
sections, I explain how to select and plant the best cover crops for your 
garden.
Choosing cover crops
Cover crops can be annual (they die after flowering or overwinter) or 
perennial (they regrow each year). For home gardeners, the best crops to 
sow are annual cover crops. These are easy to maintain and won’t turn your 
vegetable garden into a cover crop garden.
The most useful annual cover crops for home gardeners are listed here. All 
but the grasses and buckwheat are nitrogen fixing:
 
✓ Annual ryegrass, Lolium multiflorum, is a fast-growing, easy-to-establish 
grass that grows 2 to 3 feet high. It’s hardy to –20 degrees Fahrenheit but 
can become weedy. Sow 
1⁄2 to 2 pounds of seed per 1,000 square feet.

267
 Chapter 16: Surveying Some Cool Farmer Techniques
 
✓ Berseem clover, Trifolium alexandrinum, grows 1 to 2 feet high and is 
easy to mow and till under. It’s hardy to 20 degrees. Sow 2 pounds of 
seed per 1,000 square feet. Crimson clover, T. incarnatum, is closely 
related, grows 18 inches high, and is hardy to 10 degrees. It has pretty 
red flowers that attract bees.
 
✓ Buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum, is fast growing, reaching 3 to 4 feet 
tall in about 40 days from seeding. It provides lots of organic matter, 
smothers weeds with its large leaves by shading them out, and exudes 
chemicals to prevent weeds from germinating. It breaks down quickly 
in the soil after tilling. Sow 3 pounds of seed per 1,000 square feet. 
Buckwheat doesn’t fix nitrogen and is frost sensitive, so grow it in 
summer when the temperatures are warm.
 
✓ Fava beans, Vicia faba, grow 3 to 8 feet high and are hardy to 15 degrees. 
Bell beans are a shorter (3 feet) relative. Edible varieties include ‘Sweet 
Loraine’ and ‘Windsor’. Sow 2 to 5 pounds of seed per 1,000 square feet.
 
✓ Field peas, Pisum arvense or P. sativus, come in several varieties that 
range in height from 6 inches to 5 feet high. They’re hardy to 10 to 20 
degrees. Sow 2 to 4 pounds of seed per 1,000 square feet.
 
✓ Hairy vetch, Vicia villosa, is the hardiest annual legume (–15 degrees) 
and grows about 2 feet high. Sow 1 to 2 pounds of seed per 1,000 square 
feet.
 
✓ Winter rye, Secale cereale, is a very hardy grass (–30 degrees) that 
grows 4 to 5 feet high. It’s the best grass for cold areas with poor, acidic 
soils and produces lots of organic matter. Sow 2 to 3 pounds of seed per 
1,000 square feet.

Planting cover crops
The best time to plant cover crops is late summer to early fall. What happens 
next depends on the climate where you live:
 
✓ In mild-winter areas, the plants will grow throughout winter and can be 
turned into the soil in spring.
 
✓ In cold-winter climates, plant hardy types that will grow for a while in 
fall, go dormant, and then grow again in spring before eventually dying. 
Some less hardy types, such as annual ryegrass, will die back in winter 
and be easier to till under in spring. You can work them into the ground 
in late spring or early summer and plant vegetables soon after.

268
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
 An early spring planting of cover crops also works in cold-winter 
climates, but you won’t be able to work the plants in until later in the 
summer.
Because beds planted with cover crops won’t be available for planting 
vegetables until you turn them under, you have to plan ahead to use your 
garden efficiently. If you’re short on space, consider alternating vegetables 
and cover crops so that each bed gets a cover crop every 2 or 3 years instead 
of each year.
 
If you plant cover crops in fall after your vegetables are done, you won’t miss a 
beat and can plant vegetables again in spring. If you plant cover crops during 
the spring or summer, you’ll have to sacrifice some space in your veggie 
garden. I’d opt for this route only if your soil is very poor and you need to 
build it up while growing vegetables at the same time. Just rotate where you 
plant the cover crops in your garden, and after a few years, your whole garden 
will get a cover cropping.
Plant cover crops by broadcasting seed (Chapter 13 has more info about this 
technique). To make sure the proper bacteria are present for nitrogen fixing 
in legume cover crops, use an inoculate. Most suppliers sell an inoculate that 
you mix with the seed. Till the soil, sow the seeds, and lightly cover the seeds 
with soil. If the weather is dry, water the seedbed to get the plants off to an 
early start and then keep the soil moist until it rains.
 
If you grow cover crops up to planting time (spring or fall) in your garden, the 
best time to work the cover crops into the ground is just before they start to 
bloom. With taller types, you may have to cut or mow the plants down before 
turning or tilling them in. After you work them in, wait about 2 weeks before 
planting vegetables.
Giving Your Plants Some Friends: 
Companion Planting
A companion plant is one that provides some sort of benefit to other plants 
growing nearby. It’s sort of like how a good friend makes life easier for you. 
Well, plants have good friends, too. For example, the cover crops that I talk 
about earlier in this chapter can be considered companion plants.
Some plants are grown together because they seem to increase each other’s 
yields. But what I want to talk about here are companion plants that repel 
pests. Is that really possible? Well, I’m not so sure. No clear-cut evidence 

269
 Chapter 16: Surveying Some Cool Farmer Techniques
says companion planting works against pests. But some people swear by 
it. (Louise Riotte’s Carrots Love Tomatoes published by Storey Publishing is 
devoted to the subject.) It is true, however, that a variety of plants, herbs, 
and flowers provides a diverse ecosystem so that predatory insects are more 
likely to hang around and take care of the bad guys. Besides, trying some of 
these combinations certainly won’t hurt your garden.
These plants are thought to repel specific pests; plant them near crops where 
these pests are a common problem:
 
✓ Anise planted among members of the cabbage family (cabbage, broccoli, 
cauliflower, kale, and so on) is said to repel imported cabbage worms.
 
✓ Basil is said to repel whiteflies, aphids, and spider mites; it’s a good 
companion to tomatoes because these are insects that feed on tomato 
plants.
 
✓ Catnip is said to repel some types of aphids, flea beetles, squash bugs, 
and cucumber beetles.
 
✓ Garlic may repel nematodes and other soil insects.
 
✓ Leeks are thought to repel carrot flies.
 
✓ Marigolds planted around vegetables are said to repel root nematodes, 
Mexican bean beetles, and Colorado potato beetles.
 
✓ Mustard greens are supposed to repel aphids.
 
✓ Nasturtiums are said to repel Colorado potato beetles.
 
✓ Radishes may repel striped cucumber beetles.
 
✓ Ryegrass may repel root-knot nematodes.
 
✓ Southernwood may repel moths and flea beetles.
 
✓ Tansy is supposed to repel some aphids, squash bugs, and Colorado 
potato beetles as well as ants.
 
✓ White clover may repel cabbage root flies.
 
✓ Wormwood may repel flea beetles.
Many herbs, such as rosemary, oregano, and coriander, also are said to repel 
pests. Smaller companion plants, such as marigolds, can be interplanted with 
vegetables. Taller or more vigorous plants, such as ryegrass or wormwood, 
should be planted nearby — but not among — vegetables. You don’t want 
them to overwhelm your veggie plants.
The research on companion planting may be thin, but hey, give it a try to see 
if it works!

270
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
Making Your Garden Work Double 
Time with Intercropping
Intercropping is a space-saving technique in which you grow fast-maturing, 
smaller crops among slower-growing, larger vegetables. By the time the 
bigger plants start to take over, you have already harvested the crops in 
between. Intercropping makes one bed as productive as two.
 
The best crops for intercropping include beets, carrots, lettuce, onions, radishes, 
spinach, and turnips. Use these examples to help you decide how to do it:
 
✓ Plant lettuce, carrots, or radishes among young tomatoes and broccoli. 
For that matter, plant carrots and radishes wherever you have open 
space.
 
✓ Plant turnips and other root crops among your cabbage.
 
✓ Plant spinach or lettuce under your bean trellis. As the weather warms, 
the beans will shade the spinach and keep it cool.
 
✓ Plant green onions between rows of corn.
Succession Planting for 
an Extended Harvest
Succession planting is a method of extending the harvest of vegetables, such 
as radishes and corn, that ripen all at once and lose quality if left in the 
garden instead of being harvested. Farmers use the technique to ensure a 
constant supply of vegetables to take to market; you can use it to produce 
a consistent supply of vegetables to take to your table. To succession plant, 
you simply make smaller plantings separated by 2 to 3 weeks instead of 
planting everything at once. Some great crops to succession plant are lettuce 
and greens, bush beans, beets, carrots, onions, radish, spinach, and sweet 
corn.
 
If you want to experiment with succession planting, use these steps:
 
1. Figure out how much of a certain vegetable your family needs for a 
2- to 3-week period and how much room it will take to grow it.
 
 Figure 16-1 shows a sample garden plan for succession planting. Check 
out Chapter 3 for additional information on how to plan your garden.
 
2. Break your planting beds into three or four appropriate-sized sections 
to grow your 2- to 3-week supply of the vegetable.

271
 Chapter 16: Surveying Some Cool Farmer Techniques
 
3. At the start of the planting season, plant the first bed; wait about 2 
weeks and plant the second bed, and then plant the third bed about 2 
weeks later.
 
 Just about the time you finish harvesting the first bed, the second bed 
will be ready to harvest.

The length of your planting season will determine how many successive 
plantings you can make and how successful the later plantings are. 
Depending on the weather, some of your later plantings may not yield well, 
but that’s another reason to plant a number of plantings through the season: 
you’re sure to get some of every type of veggie.
Another way to use succession planting is to replace a crop that’s finished 
producing with a new one in the same place. With this method, you can 
grow more and a wider variety of vegetables in a small space. Just make sure 
you’re planting a cool-season veggie for spring or fall and a warm-season 
veggie for summer. Table 16-1 lists some good succession planting combinations 
to try. (Chapter 3 has more information on cool-season and warm-season 
veggies.) You can choose one veggie from each column to plant in succession.

Yet another way to ensure a constant harvest of vegetables is to plant using 
the square foot method. This method is for the mathematically inclined (even 
though you don’t need an A in calculus to use it). You select a 4-foot-by-4-foot 
section of your garden and divide it into 16 squares (each section is 1 square 
foot). Each square will have a different number of plants, depending on what 
you’re growing:
 
✓ 1 plant per square: Tomatoes, peppers, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, 
eggplant, corn, melon, squash
 
✓ 4 plants per square: Lettuce, garlic, Swiss chard
 
✓ 8 plants per square: Pole beans, peas, spinach
 
✓ 16 plants per square: Beets, carrots, radishes, onions
By planting so few plants, you’ll have many small harvests, and you can 
easily make more succession plantings and rotate plantings each year. (I talk 
about crop rotation later in this chapter.)
 
For more information about square foot gardening techniques, look for the 
book All New Square Foot Gardening, by Mel Bartholomew (published by Cool 
Springs Press), his videos, or visit this Web site: www.squarefootgardening.
com.
Rotating Crops to Preserve Soil Nutrients 
and Maintain a Pest-Free Bed
 
If you plant the same vegetables in the same spot year after year, you’re going 
to cause a number of problems, including these:
 
✓ Insects and diseases that spend part of their life cycle in the soil will 
build up there and be more difficult to control.
 
✓ Specific nutrients that the vegetables need will consistently be depleted 
and will be harder to replace.

273
 Chapter 16: Surveying Some Cool Farmer Techniques
The way around these problems is to rotate your crops from season to 
season. In other words, plant them in different beds, as far away as possible 
from where they were planted before. Crop rotation is easy if you keep a 
journal and make note of what was planted where. And if you keep things out 
of the same beds for 3 years, you’ll probably be in good shape.
 
It’s important to do more than rotate individual crops. You should rotate 
families of crops as well. In Part II, I talk about vegetables such as tomatoes, 
peppers, eggplant, and potatoes being in the same family. A disease or insect 
that attacks one plant in a family is likely to attack others. Blight on tomatoes 
and potatoes is an example. When rotating crops, make sure you don’t plant 
a family member in the same spot 3 years in a row. For example, in one bed, 
plant beans (legume family), the next year plant potatoes (tomato family), and 
the third year plant cucumbers (squash family). After that, you can start over 
with another legume-family vegetable or start another rotation series. Keep 
the families apart for 3 years, and you’ll have fewer problems in the veggie 
patch.
If you only have one sunny spot to garden, consider using containers as a 
way to rotate crops. For example, plant your tomatoes in a container one 
year and in the garden the next.
Planting by the Phases of the Moon
Planting by the phases of the moon isn’t just a New Age technique. It actually 
has been used for eons by many ancient farmers and gardeners. They noticed 
that certain vegetables perform better when planted during different moon 
phases. The planting seasons don’t really change, but planting dates during 
those seasons become very important.
Here’s how moon gardening works: If you divide the 28-day moon cycle (from 
the new moon to the full moon and back to the new moon) into quarters, as 
any calendar does, certain quarters are thought to be better than others for 
planting specific vegetables. The following list gives you an idea of what to 
plant when, according to the moon cycle:
 
✓ The first quarter, when the moon goes from new moon (invisible) to 
a quarter visible, is thought to be best for planting asparagus, lettuce, 
broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and other vegetables that produce their 
seeds on parts of the plant that aren’t eaten.
 
✓ The second quarter, when the moon goes from half to full, is best for 
planting vegetables in which the seeds are eaten, such as beans, tomatoes, 
peppers, and squash.

274
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
✓ The third quarter, as the moon moves from full back to half again, is 
best for planting root crops such as beets, carrots, potatoes, radishes, 
and turnips.
 
✓ The last quarter, when the moon goes from half to invisible, is not 
thought of as a good planting time. Instead, it’s a time to prepare the soil 
and rid the garden of pests and weeds.
 
You can get even more complicated by factoring in astrological signs, planets, 
and how they influence plant growth, but I’ll leave that up to you and your 
further research. I haven’t tried factoring in these other elements, but I have 
a friend in India who swears by the results, as do many others. For more on 
moon gardening, check out this Web site: www.gardeningbythemoon.com.

Keeping Your Plants Healthy
In This Chapter
▶ Controlling insect pests
▶ Preventing plant diseases
▶ Keeping animals out of bounds
C
onsidering how tasty homegrown vegetables are, you shouldn’t be too 
surprised to find that other creatures want to share in your harvest. 
And, no, I’m not talking about your neighbors. I’m talking about garden pests, 
insects that want to munch on your tomatoes, and animals, like deer, raccoons, 
and rabbits, that are just plain hungry. In addition, your plants face the threat 
of diseases, such as blight, which turns your potatoes to mush. With diseases, 
prevention is the key; once they take hold, they’re almost impossible to 
eliminate.
Does the thought of all these potential problems make you want to run for 
cover? Well, you don’t need to. It’s true that insects, diseases, weeds, and 
animal pests can be very frustrating, but it’s only really bad when the damage 
gets out of hand. The secret is to nurture a healthy, naturally balanced 
garden. Every garden can withstand some damage, and you have many 
weapons in your arsenal to prevent pest problems from getting out of control.
In this chapter, I tell you how to garden to prevent severe pest problems and 
how to identify the enemies. I also discuss safe ways to deal with these foes.
The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly: 
Controlling Pests
Most gardens are populated by a huge number of insects, most of which 
are neither good nor bad. They’re just hanging out in your garden at no 
expense to your plants. But some insects are beneficial, waged in a constant 
battle with the bugs that are harming your plants. In the following sections, I 
describe both the good and the bad bugs and the safest methods of attack.

276
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
My approach to pest control is to have a maximum diversity of bugs in my 
garden. Despite what you may think, having some bad bugs around is 
important. Aphids are like hors d’oeuvres for some helpful insects, so it’s okay 
to have a few in your garden. Otherwise, what will the good bugs eat? But 
accepting the bad bugs also means that you have to accept a little damage 
once in a while. So just try to manage the pests, not nuke them off the face of 
the earth. You want to keep them at acceptable levels without letting them get 
out of control.
In with the good bugs
As you know, some insects are beneficial to the success of your crops. 
Unfortunately, you won’t always automatically attract these buggers to your 
plot, so sometimes you have to purchase them. Yes, that’s right, you have to 
buy bugs. Following are some beneficial insects that you can buy inexpensively 
to help control pests that harm vegetables (see the appendix for companies 
that sell these beneficial insects):
 
✓ Green lacewings: These beneficial insects are some of the most effective 
insects for garden use. Their voracious larvae feed on aphids, mites, 
thrips, and various insect eggs. Release them into your garden in late 
spring, after the danger of frost has passed.
 
✓ Lady beetles: These insects are your basic ladybugs. Both the adults 
and the lizardlike larvae are especially good at feeding on small insects 
like aphids and mites. But releasing adults sometimes isn’t very effective 
because Mother Nature has preprogrammed them to migrate down the 
road, so they leave your garden quickly.
 
 Try preconditioned lady beetles, which have been deprogrammed (don’t 
worry — the procedure is safe); they’re more likely to stick around. 
Release lady beetles just before sundown; that way, they’ll at least spend 
the night. Release a few thousand of them in spring as soon as you 
notice the first aphid.
 
✓ Parasitic nematodes: These microscopic worms parasitize many types 
of soil-dwelling and burrowing insects, including cutworms and Japanese 
beetle grubs. Because grubs usually inhabit lawns, you have to apply 
these worms there, too, as well as around the bases of your plants. Mix 
the nematodes with water, and spray them on the soil around the bases 
of your plants in spring or fall.
 
✓ Predatory mites: These types of mites feed on spider mites and other 
small pests. Add predatory mites to your garden in the spring as soon as 
the danger of frost has passed.
 
✓ Trichogramma wasps: These tiny wasps (which are harmless to 
humans) attack moth eggs and butterfly larvae (that is, caterpillars). 
Release these garden good guys when air temperatures are above 72 
degree Fahrenheit.

277
 Chapter 17: Keeping Your Plants Healthy
 
Good bugs are smart; they hang out in the gardens that offer the most diverse 
and reliable menu. That’s why eliminating every last insect pest from your 
garden isn’t a good idea. To get the good insects to stick around, follow 
these tips:
 
✓ Avoid indiscriminately using broad-spectrum chemical or organic 
pesticides, which kill everything, the good bugs and the bad. If you 
do spray, use a spray that specifically targets the pest that you want to 
eliminate and that has minimal effect on beneficial insects; the label on 
the spray usually gives you this information. (I discuss safe sprays in 
detail later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Plant a diverse garden with many kinds and sizes of plants, including 
flowers and herbs. Doing so gives the beneficials (beneficial insects) 
places to hide and reproduce. A garden with a variety of plants also can 
provide an alternative food source, because many beneficials like to eat 
pollen and flower nectar, too. Some plants that attract beneficials include 
Queen Anne’s lace, parsley (especially if you let the flower develop), 
sweet alyssum, dill, fennel, and yarrow.
 
✓ Provide a diverse habitat for beneficial insects. Have a small bird bath 
and evergreen and deciduous shrubs to hide in nearby. These elements 
provide water and shelter for beneficial insects, making it more likely 
they’ll hang around to munch on some insect pests.
The bad-bug roundup
It helps to know your enemy, and insect pests command the largest army of 
invaders. The following sections list the most common insect pests that are 
likely to infest your vegetables as well as the best ways to control them. You 
can find control measures for the pests that prey primarily on specific 
vegetables in the individual descriptions of those vegetables in Part II; I also 
provide general points for tackling bad bugs in the later section “Methods of 
attack.”
 
If you need more help identifying garden pests and other plant problems, 
contact a full-service garden center with a variety of reference books that you 
can look through as well as employees who have personal experience with 
local problems. Also check with botanical gardens, libraries, Web sites, or a 
local Cooperative Extension Service office. You should be able to find your 
county office listed under county offices (these services are usually managed by 
area land-grant universities) or under Cooperative Extension or Farm Advisor. 
Often a well-trained home gardener called a Master Gardener is available by 
phone or in person to answer your gardening questions. (Check the appendix 
for state Master Gardener contacts.)

278
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
Aphids
Aphids are tiny, pear-shaped pests that come in many colors, including 
black, green, and red (see Figure 17-1). They congregate on new growth and 
flower buds, sucking plant sap through their needlelike noses. Heavy 
infestations can cause distorted growth and may weaken your plants. Aphids 
leave behind a sticky sap that may turn black with sooty mold and may carry 
diseases, such as viruses, that infect your plants. Many vegetables can be 
infested with this pest, including cabbage, cucumbers, and broccoli.
 
Figure 17-1: 
Control 
aphids with 
insecticidal 
soap, neem 
oil, or hot 
pepper 
spray.
 
Aphids are easy to control. A strong jet of water from a hose can knock them 
off sturdy plants (they rarely climb back onto the plant to feed), or you can 
use insecticidal soap or neem oil. Insecticidal soap also helps wash off the 
sooty mold. (I talk more about insecticidal soap and neem oil in the later 
section “Methods of attack.”) But if you have only a few aphids, wait a week 
for beneficial insects, especially lady beetles, to move into your garden; they 
usually take matters into their own hands before serious damage occurs.
Caterpillars and worms
Caterpillars and worms, moth and butterfly larvae, are avid eaters and can 
cause a lot of damage to a variety of plants. Some are hairy caterpillars; 
others are smooth skinned and more wormlike. Caterpillars include tomato 
hornworms and cabbageworms (see Figure 17-2), which are described in 
Chapters 4 and 9 respectively. You can handpick caterpillars and worms to 
reduce numbers, or you can release trichogramma wasps. But the most 
effective way to get rid of them is to spray with biological controls, such as Bt 
or spinosad. (You can read more about Bt and spinosad in the later section 
“Methods of attack.”)

Corn earworms
Corn earworms are a common pest wherever corn is grown. These 1
1⁄2-inch-long 
caterpillars with alternating light and dark stripes may be green, pink, or 
brown. In spring, night-flying moths lay yellow eggs on the undersides of 
leaves. The resulting first-generation caterpillars feed on the leaves. The eggs 
of later generations can be found on corn silks; the emerging caterpillars feed 
on the silks and the kernels at the tips of the corn ears, just inside the husks. 
The earworms, also called fruitworms, attack a variety of plants including 
tomatoes, beans, peas, peppers, potatoes, and squash.
The easiest way to deal with corn earworms on your corn plants is to just cut 
off the tip of the ear before you cook it. Or to prevent worms, you can spray 
Bt before the caterpillars enter the ears or fruit, but that doesn’t always work. 
To prevent the worms from entering the ears, you also can place a few drops 
of mineral oil on the silks of each ear just as the silks wilt and start to turn 
from white or yellow to brown. (Don’t do it too early or you’ll interfere with 
pollination, but don’t wait until the silks are all brown and shriveled either; 
you have about a week in which to work.)
Cutworms
Cutworms are 
1⁄2-inch-long, grayish caterpillars. They emerge on spring and 
early summer nights to eat the stems of young seedlings, causing the seedlings 
to fall over like small timbers. Cutworms also climb up to older plants and 
feed on leaves and flowers.
To protect seedlings, surround their stems with barriers that prevent the 
cutworms from crawling close and feeding. These devices can be as simple 
as empty cardboard toilet paper rolls, Styrofoam cups with the bottoms cut 

280
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
out, or collars made from aluminum foil. Whatever you use, just make sure 
that the barriers encircle the stem completely and are set 1 inch deep in the 
soil. You also can trap cutworms by leaving boards around your garden; the 
worms hide under the boards during the day, enabling you to collect them. 
Parasitic nematodes also are effective against cutworms. (Flip to the earlier 
section “In with the good bugs” for more on these good pests.)
Flea beetles
Flea beetles are tiny 
1⁄16-inch beetles that feed on vegetable leaves, riddling 
them with small holes. These beetles jump rapidly when disturbed, like 
fleas — hence their name. Various species feed on just about any plant in a 
garden, including eggplant, tomatoes, broccoli, cabbage, corn, potatoes, 
spinach, peppers, and sweet potatoes. Adult beetles can spread diseases — 
wilt in sweet corn, for example — and larvae feed on roots. Adults overwinter 
in the soil and on garden debris, emerging in early spring. Keep a close watch 
because these beetles can destroy young plants quickly.
To control flea beetles, make sure you clean up garden debris in the winter 
and till the soil. Use a floating row cover to exclude adults (I describe these 
covers later in this chapter), and release parasitic nematodes to attack the 
larvae. Pyrethrins and insecticidal soap also provide some control.
Japanese beetles
Japanese beetles can really be troublesome in many areas. These 
1⁄2-inch-long 
beetles have coppery bodies and metallic green heads. They feed on the 
foliage of many vegetables, including corn, beans, and tomatoes.
 
Controlling Japanese beetles can be tough. Treating your lawn and garden soil 
with parasitic nematodes or with milky spore (a biological spray) may reduce 
the white C-shaped larvae, but more adults will probably fly in from your 
neighbor’s yard. Floral-scented traps that attract adult beetles are available, 
but the traps may attract more beetles than you had before. If you try the 
traps, keep them at least 100 feet from your vegetables and encourage your 
neighbors to use them, too, to control the beetles community-wide.
Insecticidal soap and neem oil are effective against adult beetles. You also 
can handpick the beetles off your vegetables and stomp on them. Picking in 
early morning or evening is easiest because the beetles are sleepy then and 
tend not to fly away.
Nematodes
Nematodes are microscopic wormlike pests that can infect soil, especially in 
warm climates. They feed on the roots of plants and attack many vegetables, 
including carrots, tomatoes, and potatoes. Nematodes thrive in sandy, moist 
soil and can quickly stunt plants and cause roots to look hairy and knotted. 
Your best defense is to plant nematode-resistant varieties and to rotate your 
crops (see Chapter 16) to prevent a population from building.

281
 Chapter 17: Keeping Your Plants Healthy
 
These nematodes are different from the parasitic nematodes that I mention in 
the earlier section “In with the good bugs,” which are actually beneficial for 
your garden.
Snails and slugs
Snails and slugs are soft-bodied mollusks that feed on tender leaves and 
flowers during the cool of night or during rainy weather. Snails have shells; 
slugs don’t. Snails and slugs proliferate in damp areas, hiding under raised 
containers, boards, or garden debris.
To control these pests, roam through your garden at night with a flashlight 
and play pick-and-stomp, or trap them with saucers of beer, setting the rims 
at ground level. They’ll jump in to drink the beer, not be able to climb out, 
and drown. What a way to go! Refill the saucers regularly. (These pests seem 
to like imported beers best, but why waste good beer on a slug?) Snails and 
slugs won’t cross copper, so you can also surround raised beds or individual 
containers with a thin copper stripping, which is sold at most nurseries. In 
California, you can release decollate snails, which prey on pest snails; ask 
your Cooperative Extension Service office for information.
If all else fails, you can spread snail and slug bait containing iron phosphate. 
Sold as Sluggo and Escar-Go! this safe bait attracts and kills slugs and snails 
without being harmful to wildlife, pets, and kids.
Spider mites
Spider mites are tiny, spiderlike arachnids that you can barely see without 
a magnifying glass. If the population gets big enough, you can see their fine 
webbing beneath the leaves of your plants. As they suck a plant’s juices, 
the leaves become yellowish with silvery stippling (small yellow dots on the 
leaves) or sheen. If things get really bad, the plant may start dropping leaves. 
Mites are most common in hot, dry summer climates and on plants with 
dusty (sooty) leaves. Tomatoes and beans are commonly infested.
A daily bath with a strong jet of water from a hose helps keep infestations 
down. You can control spider mites with insecticidal soap, which also helps 
clean off the plants’ leaves. Applying summer oil or neem oil and releasing 
predatory mites also are effective.
Thrips
Thrips are almost-invisible troublemakers. They feed on leaves, giving them 
a stippled look and deforming them. You can distinguish thrips from spider 
mites by looking for the small fecal pellets that thrips leave behind. Thrips 
often pass on diseases as they feed. Beans, cabbage, onions, and eggplants 
are commonly infested. Many beneficials feed on thrips, especially lacewings. 
Insecticidal soaps and pyrethrins also are effective.

282
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
Whiteflies
Whiteflies look like small white gnats, but they suck plant juices and can 
proliferate in warm climates and greenhouses. They tend to congregate on 
the undersides of leaves, especially on tomatoes and beans. You can trap 
whiteflies with yellow sticky traps, which are sold in nurseries. In greenhouses, 
release Encarsia wasps, which prey on greenhouse whiteflies. Insecticidal 
soaps, summer oil, and neem oil are effective sprays.
Methods of attack
If the controls I mention in the previous sections aren’t cutting it and you 
need to take further action, start with what I consider the first line of defense 
against pest outbreaks: physical barriers that keep the bugs away from your 
plants. The next step is to apply pesticides that are effective against a certain 
pest, are pretty safe to use, and have a mild impact on the rest of your garden’s 
life-forms. In general, these products are short-lived after you use them in 
your garden — that’s what makes them so good.
Physical controls
You can physically prevent pests from damaging your vegetables a number of 
ways. One of the best ways is to grab bugs by their tails, body slam them to the 
ground, and stomp on them. Handpicking, as it’s usually called, works best with 
large bugs like tomato hornworms, Japanese beetles, snails, and slugs. The 
best time to handpick slugs is at night, using the light of a flashlight. If you have 
problems squashing bugs, drop them in a jar of soapy water instead.
Here are some other physical controls to try:
 
✓ A strong jet of water often dislodges insects like aphids and spider 
mites from the leaves of vegetables, and they rarely climb back onto the 
plant. This method also keeps the foliage clean.
 
✓ Barriers keep pests from reaching your vegetables. For example, place a 
small copper strip around the outside of raised beds or containers to keep 
snails from reaching your plants (snails won’t cross the copper stripping). 
Floating row covers (see Figure 17-3), those lightweight, blanketlike 
materials described in more detail in Chapter 21, also keep pests away 
from plants. And if you have problems with cutworms, push a small 
cardboard collar (a paper cup with the bottom pushed out works well) 
into the ground around seedlings to keep bugs from reaching the stems.
 
✓ Trapping pests before they reach your vegetables is another way to 
reduce problems. Trapping works best with night feeders — such as 
slugs and earwigs — that seek shelter during the day and are attracted 
to dark, moist environments. You can trap snails and slugs under a 
slightly raised board at night, and then dispose of the board in the 
morning. Earwigs will collect in rolled-up newspapers.

Safe pesticides
Here are my favorite safe spray methods of controlling harmful bugs:
 
✓ Biological controls: Using biological controls involves pitting one living 
thing against another. Releasing beneficial insects (as I suggest earlier 
in this chapter) is one example of biological control, but you also can 
use bacteria that, while harmless to humans, makes insect pests very 
sick and eventually very dead. The most common and useful biological 
controls are forms of Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt, which kill the larvae 
of moths and butterflies (that is, caterpillars). Another variety of Bt, 
B.t. tenebrionis or B.t. San Diego, kills the larvae of Colorado potato 
beetles. Bacillus popilliae (milky spore disease) is an effective control of 
Japanese beetle grubs.
 
 Spinosad is a new biological control agent that has many uses. This 
soil-dwelling bacteria was discovered in Jamaica as a byproduct in 
the rum-making industry. It kills a broad range of insects, including 
caterpillars, thrips, spider mites, and leaf miners, but it isn’t harmful to 
beneficial insects, animals, or pets. However, it is toxic to honey bees 
so spray it on cloudy days or late in the evening when the bees are less 
active. Like Bt, the insect must eat the toxin for it to work.
 
✓ Botanical insecticides: Botanical insecticides are derived from plants. 
The most useful insecticides against vegetable pests are pyrethrins, 
which are derived from the painted daisy, Chrysanthemum cinerariifolium. 
They’re broad-spectrum insecticides, which means they kill a wide range 
of insects. Unfortunately, that means some of the good guys are killed, 
too. So to avoid killing bees, for example, spray pyrethrins late in the 
evening. I usually use this pesticide as a last resort. The advantage to 
using pyrethrins is that it kills pests like aphids and beetles quickly, and 
has low toxicity to mammals. However, always follow the label and never 
apply more than is recommended.

284
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
 The terminology can be confusing. Pyrethrum is the ground-up flower of 
this type of daisy. Pyrethrins are the insecticide components of the flower. 
You also may see insecticides called pyrethroids, however. Pyrethroids, 
such as permethrin and resmethrin, are synthetic compounds that 
resemble pyrethrins but are more toxic and persistent. They shouldn’t be 
used in organic gardens. Consequently, I avoid pyrethroids.
 
✓ Home remedies: Not all pesticides are exotic. Many gardeners have had 
great success using common household products to control insects in 
their gardens. One of my favorite home remedies is adding a clove or 
two of garlic and a few teaspoons of cayenne to a quart of water and 
then blending it all in a mixer. You then strain the solution to remove 
the chunks, and using a hand-held sprayer, spray your plants to control 
insects, such as aphids and whiteflies, and repel animals, such as 
rabbits and deer. Of course, after it rains, you have to reapply the mix. 
Commercial insecticide products, such as Hot Pepper Wax and Garlic 
Barrier, which are based on the common foods, also are available. Either 
type of product is effective, simple, safe, and fun to try.
 
✓ Insecticidal soaps: Derived from the salts of fatty acids, insecticidal 
soaps kill mostly soft-bodied pests like aphids, spider mites, and 
whiteflies. They also can be effective against Japanese beetles. They 
work fast, break down quickly, and are nontoxic to humans. Insecticidal 
soaps are most effective when mixed with soft water because soaps can 
sometimes burn tender foliage.
 
✓ Neem oil: Neem oil is extracted from the seed of the tropical neem tree. 
It has been used for centuries in India as an insecticide, to kill parasites 
in cattle, and even as a toothpaste for humans. Needless to say, it’s very 
safe (except to unlucky pests). Home gardeners can purchase neem oil 
to repel and kill insects including aphids, whiteflies, leaf miners, 
caterpillars, and many others.
 
✓ Summer or horticultural oil: When sprayed on a plant, this highly 
refined oil smothers insect pests and their eggs. The words “highly 
refined” mean that the sulfur and other components of the oil that 
damage the plant are removed. This oil is relatively nontoxic and short 
lived. Use it to control aphids, mites, thrips, and certain caterpillars.
 
 Make sure that you don’t confuse summer oil with dormant oil. Dormant 
oil should be applied to leafless trees and shrubs during the winter. It 
isn’t meant to be used on vegetables.
 
 Double-check the oil’s product label to make sure that you can use 
the oil on plants during the growing season. Then follow the mixing 
instructions carefully. Water your plants before and after applying the 
oil. But don’t apply the oil if temperatures are likely to rise above 85 
degrees Fahrenheit. When it’s that hot, the oil can damage plant leaves.
 
Even organic pesticides that have relatively low impact on your garden 
environment can be dangerous to use as well as toxic to humans; this is true 
of several commonly used botanical insecticides, such as pyrethrin and 

285
 Chapter 17: Keeping Your Plants Healthy
rotenone. Rotenone is a botanical pesticide that was used heavily in the early 
days of organic growing, but now has lost favor with many gardeners because 
of research showing a potential link to cancer and Parkinson’s disease. I don’t 
recommend it.
 
Always follow the instructions on the product label exactly; in fact, not 
following these instructions is against the law. Also, wear gloves when mixing 
and spraying pesticides, and spray when the wind is calm. Store the chemicals 
in properly labeled containers well out of the reach of children (a locked 
cabinet is best). Dispose of empty containers as described on the label, or 
contact your local waste disposal company for appropriate disposal sites.
Gardening to Eliminate Diseases
Diseases differ from insects in that, with bugs, you can take action after you 
see them. With diseases, once you see symptoms, it’s often difficult to stop 
the diseases from spreading. However, you can prevent or at least reduce 
most vegetable diseases by using good growing practices or by planting 
resistant varieties. Most vegetables have some varieties with disease 
resistance; see the chapters on individual vegetables in Part II for details. In 
the following sections, I provide useful methods for preventing and handling 
some common diseases.
Avoiding diseases with good habits
 
Here are some cultural practices that can help you avoid plant diseases:
 
✓ Remove infected plants. After you’ve identified a plant with a severe 
disease problem, yank out the entire plant. Even picking off infected 
leaves helps prevent a disease from spreading.
 
✓ Avoid overhead watering. Overhead watering can encourage foliage 
disease organisms to prosper. If you can’t avoid this watering method, 
at least water early in the morning so plants have a chance to dry out 
before nightfall. Using drip irrigation or watering in furrows helps keep 
foliage dry (see Chapter 15).
 
✓ Space plants properly. Planting vegetables too close together reduces 
air circulation between them, a condition that favors disease and allows 
diseases to spread from plant to plant more readily. Keep your eyes 
open for developing problems.
 
✓ Keep your garden clean and tidy. Many diseases spread on plant 
debris, so rake up fallen leaves and remove dead plants. Also, keep the 
spaces under any containers clean. Removing diseased leaves can slow 
the spread of some organisms.

286
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
✓ Rotate plants. Don’t plant the same vegetables in the same place year 
after year. Otherwise, you create a nursery for disease. Move things 
around as described in Chapter 16.
 
✓ Mulch your beds. A layer of mulch on the soil can act like a physical 
barrier, keeping disease spores in the soil and off the plants. See Chapter 
15 for more on mulches.
Watching out for common diseases
The following list includes tips on how to prevent, identify, and treat (if possible) 
some common diseases that affect vegetables. Controls for diseases that are 
most troublesome for a specific vegetable are included with the description of 
that vegetable in Part II. Here are some diseases to keep an eye out for:
 
✓ Damping off: This disease attacks the bases of seedling stems, causing 
them to wilt and fall over. I discuss ways to prevent damping off in 
Chapter 13, which covers all aspects of growing vegetables from seed.
 
✓ Powdery mildew: This fungus coats leaves and flowers with a white 
powder. It’s most common when days are warm but nights are cool. This 
disease is particularly troublesome to squash, cucumbers, melons, and 
peas. Controlling powdery mildew is difficult, but resistant varieties are 
available. The disease becomes less of a problem as the weather changes.
 
 Some gardeners have had some success using a home remedy. Mix 
1 tablespoon of summer oil and 1 to 2 teaspoons of baking soda in 1 
gallon of water, and then spray the mixture often to protect new foliage. 
This mixture also is sold commercially under names such as Remedy. 
Some forms of neem oil also are registered for use on vegetables. A new 
biological spray called Serenade (Bacillus subtilis) contains a bacterium 
that attacks powdery mildew and other fungi.
 
✓ Root rots: A number of soilborne fungi cause plants to have basically 
the same damage — regardless of whether the soil is moist. Lettuce is 
notorious for dying like this. The best way to prevent root rot is to make 
sure that soil drainage is good and to avoid overwatering — let the soil 
dry partially between waterings. Otherwise, all you can do to control root 
rot is to remove the dead plants. Few other control measures are effective.
 
✓ Southern blight: This rather nasty disease that affects corn is common 
in the southeastern United States. Southern blight causes plants to rot 
at the base of their stems, wilt, turn yellow, and die. Unfortunately, this 
disease is difficult to control. Your best bet is to rotate your crops each 
year, get rid of all infected plant material, and turn your soil in the fall. 
You also can try soil solarization, as described in Chapter 15.

287
 Chapter 17: Keeping Your Plants Healthy
 
✓ Viruses: These diseases affect many vegetables, including tomatoes, 
peppers, peas, beans, cucumbers, beets, potatoes, and squash. When 
infected with a virus, leaves and fruits often have mottled yellow spottings 
and are deformed. Plants are stunted and die young, often not producing 
usable fruit. Virus diseases are sometimes specific to certain vegetables 
and spread by insects such as cucumber beetles (see Chapter 8 for more 
on controlling this pest), aphids, and whiteflies; stopping these pests 
many times stops the disease. You also should destroy infected plants 
and try to plant disease-resistant varieties.
Keeping the Animal Kingdom at Bay
Besides insects and diseases, you also should keep an eye out for the 2- and 
4-footed pests described in this section. If you have problems with critters, be 
sure to properly identify the culprit; identification may take some late-night work 
with a flashlight. What control you use will depend on who’s doing the damage.
 
As you read the control suggestions in this section, you’ll notice that fencing is 
one of my most common recommendations. But even a sturdy fence isn’t a 
100-percent guarantee, so live trapping and relocating may be the only solution 
to an especially persistent woodchuck or raccoon. (Check with your state Fish 
and Game Department to find out whether it has any regulations governing 
the trapping of the animal you have in mind.) You can buy live traps at most 
hardware stores; get the appropriate size for the animal that you want to 
catch. After you have the animal in the trap, release it in areas recommended 
by your local state Fish and Game Department officials.
My outlook on fungicides: Avoid ’em if you can
Chemical fungicides (substances that kill 
fungus) are a nastier bunch of pesticides. I 
prefer not to use them on my vegetables. If 
you get a really stubborn disease in a prized 
planting, however, you may have no other 
choice. Here’s a short list of some of the “safer” 
ones:
 ✓ Some mineral-based fungicides — such as 
copper for blight on tomatoes and sulfur for 
mildew on peas — are less toxic, but you 
should still use them only sparingly. They’re 
most effective preventing the disease, so 
they need to be applied early.
 ✓ Neem oil also has been proven effective 
as a fungicide, making it another option. 
Like many fungicides, it’s best used as a 
preventive spray or when the infection is 
just starting.
 ✓ Bacillus subtilis is a new biological 
fungicide that attacks many fungal 
diseases, such as mildew and blight. This 
bacteria is safe for bees, birds, wildlife, and 
beneficial insects.
As with any pesticide, follow the instructions on 
the label carefully and exactly.

288
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
Letting your family dog or cat prowl your grounds to ward off wild animals 
may sound like a good idea, but, in reality, keeping your pets indoors or 
restrained is the best idea, especially when large animals are around. Rabies is 
a problem with many wild animals, such as raccoons, and some wildlife, such 
as woodchucks, which are ferocious fighters.
The following list identifies animal pests that are common to vegetable 
gardens. It also provides some methods to control these critters:
 
✓ Birds: Starlings and crows have an uncanny sense of where you 
planted your corn seeds. To keep birds from eating seeds or pulling up 
newly sprouted plants, protect your seedbed with a bird tunnel (see 
Figure 17-4) or a floating row cover. By the time the plants outgrow the 
cover, they’re no longer appetizing to birds.
 
Figure 17-4: 
Covering 
seedlings 
with a 
portable 
bird tunnel 
is a sure 
way to keep 
birds away.
 
 
✓ Cats and dogs: Fences work best to keep four-legged friends — and your 
neighbors — out of your garden. Cats are a problem early in the season 
when they like to dig in newly tilled ground; laying chicken wire, pruned 
rose or raspberry canes, or hardware cloth over your seedbed until 
plants sprout encourages cats to dig elsewhere. Try spraying a pepper 
and garlic spray (see the earlier section “Methods of attack” for details) 
to deter these critters.
 
✓ Deer: A slanted fence can keep Bambi and her fawns out of your garden. 
Their instinct is to try to crawl under a fence before jumping it, and 
they’re less likely to jump a wide fence. A slanted fence can be 4 to 5 
feet high (see Figure 17-5); a vertical fence must be at least 8 feet high to 
keep deer from jumping over it.
 
✓ Gophers: Gophers can wreak havoc by eating plants’ roots and under-
ground parts. Trapping is the most practical solution in most cases. 
Probe the soil near a fresh mound of dirt with a crowbar, and set two 
traps in the runway, one facing each direction. Tie the traps together 
and cover them lightly with soil to keep out light.

289
 Chapter 17: Keeping Your Plants Healthy

best design 
to keep deer

garden.
 
 
 If your garden is small or organized into small beds, you may want to 
construct a gopher barrier, as shown in Figure 17-6. Dig the soil out of 
the bed to a depth of at least 12 inches and line the bottom and sides 
with 1-inch chicken wire. Then replace the soil.
 
✓ Mice and small rodents: A 12-inch-high fence made of 
1⁄4-inch mesh 
hardware cloth, with another 12 inches buried underground, keeps mice 
and other small rodents out of your garden.

and most

290
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
✓ Moles: Moles don’t feed on plants; they eat insects such as grubs and 
earthworms. However, their tunneling may damage the roots of your 
plants. The most effective way to control moles is to repel them. Moles 
don’t like the smell of castor oil, so spray a mole repellent, such as Mole 
Med, that contains castor oil.
 
 If the problem is severe, set traps in the tunnels. To find active tunnels, 
tamp down raised soil, which indicates tunneling. The tunnels that are 
raised the day after you tamp the soil are active.
 
✓ Rabbits: A 2-foot-high fence made of 1
1⁄2-inch mesh should keep rabbits 
out of your garden. Make sure the bottom is tight to the ground or bury 
the bottom edge as recommended for woodchucks. You also can try a 
pepper and garlic spray designed to repel cats and dogs.
 
✓ Raccoons: A 4-foot-high fence similar to the one recommended for wood-
chucks usually keeps raccoons out of your garden.
 
✓ Woodchucks: A fence at least 3 feet high with another 12 inches under-
ground, curved away from the garden, is the best way to keep out wood-
chucks, also known as groundhogs (see Figure 17-7). Leave the top 18 
inches of the fence unattached to support posts. This way, as the wood-
chuck attempts to climb over the fence, the fence will bend back down 
under the animal’s weight. A strand of electric wire on top of a wire 
fence also discourages them.

Containing Your Veggies
In This Chapter
▶ Choosing the right size and type of container
▶ Taking a look at potting soil
▶ Finding the best vegetables to grow in pots
▶ Planting and caring for container-grown vegetables
▶ Getting the scoop on greenhouses, hoop houses, and hydroponics
You can grow almost any vegetable in a container; just fill a big pot 
with good soil, plant your chosen veggies, and then water and fertilize 
regularly. Why not just grow vegetables in your garden? Well, maybe you 
aren’t a farmer with a big backyard and a 10-horsepower rototiller. Maybe 
your soil is more appropriate for raising worms than raising plants. Or maybe 
your garden is the balcony of your apartment or a tiny patio behind your 
condominium. You still have the right to fresh, homegrown tomatoes, don’t 
you? You bet, and containers enable you to grow them.
Containers also enable you to grow vegetables that may not be able to grow 
successfully in your garden. For example: If you’ve tried to grow eggplant in 
a climate with cool summers, but it never matured before the first frost, try 
growing it in a container. Because containers heat up fast in spring, vegetables 
get a head start on the season.
Some people grow vegetables in containers simply because they like having 
their crops nearby — I certainly do. With containers, you can bring your 
crops close to your house where you can see and enjoy them (and eat 
them at the peak of freshness!). Because containers are so easy to move (or 
because you made them that way by putting them on wheels), containers are 
the great equalizer; if you need a little more or less sun, you simply move the 
containers. (It’s a heck of a lot easier than moving the sun!) Similarly, if frost 
is threatening, you can move the containers to shelter.
Vegetables can be beautiful; I’ve seen pots of vegetables that are every bit as 
colorful as my favorite flowers. Whew, I’m getting excited about growing 
vegetables in containers! And that’s what this chapter is all about: discovering 
how to get a bountiful and beautiful vegetable harvest from containers.

292
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
Considering a Few Container 
Characteristics
One trip to a nursery gives you an idea of just how many different styles and 
types of containers you can choose from. You can buy clay pots, glazed or 
not; plastic pots, pretty or ugly; or wood pots, big or small. And that’s just 
the tip of the iceberg. Here are some things to keep in mind when choosing a 
pot for vegetables:
 
✓ Size: In most cases, pots that are bigger (in terms of width and volume) 
are better, especially for growing large plants like tomatoes. Lots of root 
space means that your vegetables are less likely to get cramped; they’ll 
also be easier to water and fertilize. If you want to grow one head of 
lettuce in a small pot (8 inches in diameter), for example, you can do 
it, but you’ll have to water and fertilize more frequently than if you had 
grown it in a larger pot. Although I’ve grown tomatoes in 5-gallon 
containers, I prefer at least the 15-gallon size.
 
 With some vegetables, the depth of a container is as important — if 
not more important — as its width. You can grow quite a few carrots or 
radishes in a narrow container, but the container must be deep enough 
to accommodate the length of the plant’s mature roots. See the section 
“Knowing Which Vegetables Grow Well in Pots,” later in this chapter, for 
more on size issues for specific vegetables.
 
 A half whiskey or wine barrel is a large, inexpensive container that 
can hold quite a few vegetables — ten heads of lettuce, ten bush bean 
plants, one or two small tomato plants, or four or five small cucumber 
varieties. You can purchase these containers at garden centers and 
nurseries.
 
✓ Material: What a pot is made of can affect how often you have to water 
and how long the container lasts. Pots made of porous materials like 
clay dry out faster than those made of plastic or wood, so you must 
water the plants in them more frequently, especially in hot or windy 
climates.
 
 If you want to use wood containers, make sure they’re made of rot-
resistant materials like cedar or redwood; otherwise, they won’t last 
very long. I prefer not to use preservative-treated wood containers for 
growing vegetables or other edibles, because the chemicals may leach 
into the soil and then into my plants. If my redwood or cedar pots 
eventually rot after 10 years, I just replace them — the same goes for my 
half whiskey barrels.

293
 Chapter 18: Containing Your Veggies
 
✓ Drainage: All the pots you use for growing vegetables should have 
drainage holes; fortunately, almost all do. But because a wooden half 
barrel often doesn’t, you have to drill your own holes in the bottom of 
the container (eight to ten evenly spaced, 1-inch holes should be fine). If 
pots don’t have drainage holes, the soil becomes a swampy mess, the 
roots drown, and the plants die. Bummer.
You need to consider two other accessories when you shop for pots:
 
✓ A saucer to place underneath your pot: A saucer collects water that 
runs out of the holes in the bottom of a pot and prevents the pot from 
staining whatever it’s sitting on. You can find saucers made of the same 
or similar material as your pot or ones made of clear plastic. Plastic 
saucers are least likely to stain.
 
 Just make sure you don’t let water stand more than a day in the saucer; 
water rots roots and wooden pots.
 
✓ Wheels for mobility: Most nurseries sell wheeled platforms that you 
place under large pots to move them easily. Otherwise, you have to lift 
the heavy pots or cart them around on a hand truck.
An especially useful type of pot is a self-watering container (see Figure 18-1). 
This type of pot is made of rubberized plastic and has a false bottom and 
reservoir under the soil that can be filled with water. You pour water into a 
pipe at the top of the pot or through a hole in the side of the pot to fill the 
reservoir. The water naturally wicks up from the reservoir and into the dry 
soil so you don’t have to water as frequently. These pots allow you to get 
away during the heat of summer and not worry whether your plants are 
getting watered.

Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
Filling Up Your Container: 
Potting Soil Made Simple
 
Don’t fill your pot with soil from your garden — even if your garden has the 
very best soil on the planet. It’s too heavy and too dirty (you know, weed 
seeds, bugs, bacteria — stuff that you don’t want in your pots), and it may not 
drain properly in a pot.
Instead, use potting soil. I can tell you a lot about potting soil: how it’s well 
aerated, sterile, lightweight, and made of a good balance of organic material 
and mineral particles like sand or perlite. I can even give you a recipe to 
make your own, but you’d nod off in a second. So just trust me on this one.
At your local nursery or garden center, buy a packaged, sterilized, soilless 
potting soil that’s meant for container growing. If you need a large quantity, 
many nurseries sell potting soil in bulk. You may want to try different brands 
over time to see which ones are easiest to wet and which ones have the best 
moisture-holding capacity and drainage. But don’t have a personal crisis over 
which brand of potting soil you buy; caring for your vegetables properly after 
you plant is more important than choosing the perfect potting soil.
 
If you’re growing vegetables in large containers, you’ll be shocked at how 
much potting soil you need to fill each container. However, you don’t have to 
fill the whole container with soil. Most vegetable roots only penetrate 10 to 12 
inches into the soil. Add more than that and you’re simply wasting soil. A trick 
to use less soil is to put empty plastic soda and milk bottles in the bottom 
third of the container, and then throw the soil on top. The container will be 
lighter and easier to move, you’ll be recycling to help the environment, and 
you won’t have to buy as much soil. Talk about a win-win-win situation!
 
Don’t use the same soil each year; it may have unwelcome diseases and 
insects in it. It’s best to start fresh by replacing the potting soil in your 
containers each year.
Knowing Which Vegetables 
Grow Well in Pots
If you’re persistent, you can grow any vegetable in a pot. However, some of 
the bigger plants, like squash and watermelon, are pretty tricky to contain 
and tend to get unruly. But don’t worry, many other vegetables fit perfectly in 
pots. In the following sections, I describe popular container veggies you can 
begin with and provide some of my favorite veggie combinations.

295
 Chapter 18: Containing Your Veggies
Some common container veggies
 
Vegetable breeders have long had container gardeners in mind. They breed 
many small-space varieties (of even the most sprawling plants) that are ideal 
for growing in pots. So in the following list, I take a look at the most common 
vegetables to grow in containers. (For more information on varieties, see Part 
II.) If you can’t find the dwarf varieties that I mention here, try anything with 
the words compact, bush, baby, midget, dwarf, tiny, or teeny in the name:
 
✓ Beans: Bush varieties like ‘Provider’ and ‘Derby’ are best; you can grow 
three to four plants in a 12-inch pot. You can grow pole types in a long 
narrow box, but you have to attach some type of trellis (see Chapter 15 
for more on trellising).
 
✓ Beets: Any variety grows well in a pot, and smaller varieties like ‘Red 
Ace’ even grow well in smaller pots. However, make sure your pot is big 
and deep enough (at least 12 inches); beets don’t like to be crowded. 
You should end up having about six plants in a 12-inch pot — more if 
you’re growing them for greens or will pick them as baby beets.
 
✓ Carrots: Carrots are a perfect vegetable to grow in a pot. Start with baby 
varieties like ‘Little Fingers’, ‘Short ’n Sweet’, or ‘Thumbelina’. If you 
water diligently, you can get a bumper harvest in pots as shallow as 6 
to 8 inches deep. Longer varieties need deeper pots. After thinning, you 
should end up with 20 or so carrots per 12-inch pot.
 
✓ Cole crops — broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, and so on: All the cole 
crops grow well in containers as long as your pots are big enough; try 
planting three or four plants in a half barrel.
 
✓ Cucumbers: You can’t go wrong growing small cucumber types like 
‘Bush Pickle’ and ‘Salad Bush’. I’ve harvested cucumbers out of 
12-inch-diameter hanging pots — planted with three seeds to a pot. 
Plants dangling over the edges of a hanging pot are something to 
behold. Plant large-growing varieties in bigger pots and slip a sturdy 
wire cylinder into the outside edge of the pot for the plants to climb on.
 
✓ Eggplant: An eggplant’s purple foliage and compact habit are perfect for 
pots; any variety works as long the container is at least 5 gallons. Plant 
one eggplant per 5-gallon pot. If a plant gets floppy, push a small stake in 
the pot to support the plant.
 
✓ Lettuce and other greens: Lettuce and greens may be the ultimate 
container vegetables. The size of your pot doesn’t really matter — just 
sprinkle some seeds in it, keep the soil moist, and then get out your 
salad bowl for a great harvest. You can harvest the whole plant or snip 
off just what you need. If you want a really pretty pot, plant some ‘Bright 
Lights’ Swiss chard.

296
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
✓ Melons: Melons aren’t ideal container subjects; they’re wild and unruly. 
But through the magic of modern science, some dwarf varieties, like 
‘Bush Sugar Baby’ watermelon, grow well in containers. Plant one to two 
plants in a big pot (at least 5 gallons) and let the vines sprawl over the 
edges, supporting the fruit if necessary. And don’t let up on water and 
fertilizer.
 
✓ Onions: Green onions — scallions or bunching onions if you prefer to 
call them that — grow well in containers. Just buy a bag of sets, plant 
them 2- to 3-inches deep, and you’re in business. You can grow onions to 
full bulb size; just make sure that you use a big pot (preferably 5 gallons) 
and give them plenty of room to grow.
 
✓ Peas: Go with dwarf pea varieties like ‘Green Arrow’ and ‘Maestro’, 
English peas, ‘Sugar Bon’ snap pea, or ‘Dwarf Grey Sugar’ snow pea. Any 
variety larger than that needs a trellis. Planting six plants in a 12-inch 
pot should be fine.
 
✓ Peppers: You can grow any pepper variety in a pot, but the bigger the 
pot the better. I like to grow small-fruited varieties like ‘Serrano’ and 
‘Black Pearl’ peppers; they produce so much colorful fruit that their 
containers become showpieces. A 5-gallon pot should hold one to two 
plants.
 
✓ Potatoes: Potatoes are fun vegetables to grow in a container. Just place 
8 to 10 inches of potting soil in a big pot (at least a 5-gallon size). Plant 
two to three potato eyes 2 to 3 inches from the bottom of the pot, and 
then water them in. After the plants start to grow, cover the stems with 
more soil (leaving the very top exposed) until the pot is full. In a couple 
of months, you can harvest a pot full of spuds. Start harvesting earlier 
for new potatoes, later for larger ones. (For more on growing potatoes in 
small spaces using towers, see Chapter 6.)
 
✓ Radishes: Growing radishes is quick and easy even in the smallest 
container. Scatter some seeds in the top of a pot, keep the soil moist, 
and you’ll have radishes in less than a month.
 
✓ Squash: I have to be honest; bush zucchini plants are too productive 
even in pots. Use a 5-gallon pot (or even larger) to grow space-saving 
winter squash varieties like ‘Cornell Bush Delicata’, ‘Papaya Pear’, or 
‘Table King’. Plant three seeds in each pot and thin to the healthiest 
plant.
 
✓ Tomatoes: Everyone deserves fresh tomatoes, and anyone can grow 
them in pots. Try your favorite dwarf indeterminate variety, such as 
‘Bush Big Boy’ in a container that’s at least 5 gallons (bigger is better), 
but be ready to stake or cage tall plants. Or you can grow dwarf varieties 
like ‘Patio’, ‘Tiny Tim’, and ‘Window Box Roma’, which fit perfectly in 
pots, even smaller sizes.
Most herbs grow well in containers; see Chapter 12 for details.

297
 Chapter 18: Containing Your Veggies
Some bee-u-tee-ful vegetable combos
I’m a firm believer that anything growing in a pot, including vegetables, 
should look good enough to place on a patio or deck. So I like to combine 
different vegetables that look good together, and sometimes I even throw in 
some flowers. Here are some of my favorite container vegetable combinations:
 
✓ Mixed leaf-lettuce varieties: All the different reds, greens, and purples 
form a soft, textured kaleidoscope of colors. You can sow premixed 
seeds, but I prefer to use transplants so that I can evenly space them for 
a more structured look.
 
✓ Cool season masterpiece: In a half barrel, place one or two red Swiss 
chard plants in the middle, and then surround them with red and green 
leaf lettuce, a few parsley plants, and some white pansies.
 
✓ A salad bowl: Plant some different lettuces or other greens with 
parsley, chives, green onions, and other herbs. (Are you starting to see 
how much I like to use lettuce as an ornamental?) If you really want to 
get fancy, add some edible flowers like pansies and violas. (For more on 
growing herbs, check out Chapter 12.)
 
✓ Tomatoes and herbs: Plant one of the smaller tomato varieties, like 
‘Patio’, in the middle of a large pot. Surround it with basil or thyme, and 
mix in several dwarf yellow marigolds (which are edible flowers).
 
✓ Cabbage and kale: A large pot works best with these vegetables. Just 
mix red and green cabbage with some crinkly kale. Keep the older leaves 
trimmed so that the arrangement looks nice and clean. If you really want 
a knock-out display, plant some red tulip bulbs about 4 inches deep in 
the soil.
Well, I’ve given you five good combinations. Using your imagination, you 
should be able to come up with plenty more possibilities. But do you want 
one more for the road? Try planting rhubarb in a pot; the big leaves and 
colorful stems are stunning.
Planting Your Veggies in Pots
Planting in containers is very much like planting in open ground (see Chapter 
13). But with containers, you can plant seedlings or seeds a little closer 
together because you’re concentrating water and nutrients in a small space, 
so the seedlings and seeds, not the general soil, get more of what they need 
to grow. You also don’t have to form berms or basins in the soil with container 
gardening.

298
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
Here’s how to plant vegetables in a container:
 
1. Fill your container with soil mix so that the soil reaches almost to the 
top of the container, and then wet the soil thoroughly.
 
 Wetting the soil will probably take several passes with a hose. After the 
soil drains, it will have settled several inches.
 
2. After the water settles, add more soil until the soil level is within 2 to 
3 inches of the rim.
 
 Level the top of the soil with your hands.
 
3. Plant your seedlings or seeds.
 
 If you’re planting seedlings, make a small hole in the soil for each 
transplant. Place one seedling in each hole. The top of the root ball (the 
soil held together by the roots) should be level with or slightly below 
the surrounding soil. Use your finger to gently press down the soil 
around each seedling.
 
 If you’re sowing seeds, plant them at the appropriate depth according to 
the information in Chapter 13.
 
4. Water the container gently with a watering can or hose until the soil is 
thoroughly moist.
 
 A watering can or a hose with a bubbler extension works best because 
it’s less likely to wash soil out of the pot or dislodge seeds.
Care for your new plantings as described in Chapter 13, making sure to keep 
the soil moist until the seedlings are established or until the seeds germinate.
Caring for Container Veggies
Planting vegetables in containers is very much like planting them in the 
ground, but you must do a few things a bit differently when it comes to 
maintaining them. Here are some pointers for taking care of your container 
vegetables as compared to vegetables in your garden:
 
✓ Water more frequently. Because potting soil dries out faster than 
regular garden soil, container vegetables need more frequent watering 
(unless you’re using self-watering containers, which I describe earlier in 
this chapter). In really hot weather, you may have to water more than 
once a day, especially if the plants are large and roots fill the pots. If 
you let your vegetables go dry just once, you may spoil your harvest, 
causing conditions such as blossom-end rot, which can affect tomatoes. 
(You can read about how this condition affects tomatoes in Chapter 4.)

299
 Chapter 18: Containing Your Veggies
 
 Here are a couple ways to check whether your container is dry:
 
• Stick your finger in the soil. If the top few inches are bone dry, 
you should water.
 
• Lift or tip the container on its side. If the soil is dry, the container 
will be very light.
 
✓ Water more thoroughly. Wetting dry potting soil can be tricky. 
Sometimes, the root ball of the plant (or plants) shrinks a bit and pulls 
away from the side of the pot as the soil dries so that when you water, 
all the water rushes down the space on the side of the pot without wetting 
the soil. To overcome this problem, make sure you fill the top of the pot 
with water more than once so the root ball can absorb the water and 
expand. In fact, you should always water this way to make sure the root 
ball is thoroughly wet. It’s also important, however, to avoid overwatering 
the soil; do the finger check before watering.
 
 If you still have problems wetting the root ball, place your pot in a 
saucer and fill the saucer repeatedly with water. The water soaks up into 
the root ball and slowly wets all the soil.
 
 If you have a lot of pots, you may want to hook a drip irrigation system 
to an automatic timer to water them; nurseries and garden centers sell 
special drip emitters designed for pots. You can find out more about 
drip irrigation and emitters in Chapter 15.
 
✓ Fertilize more frequently. Because nutrients are leached from the soil 
when you frequently water container vegetables, you need to fertilize 
your plants more often — at least every 2 weeks. Liquid or water-soluble 
fertilizers (you just add them to water) are easiest to use and get nutrients 
down to the roots of your plants. A complete organic fertilizer is best. 
(See Chapter 15 for more detailed fertilizer info.)
 
✓ Watch for pests. Worried about insects and diseases harming your 
container plants? Don’t be too concerned. In general, vegetables in 
containers have fewer pest problems because they’re isolated from 
other plants. Insects aren’t waiting on nearby weeds to jump on your 
plants, and sterilized potting soil (which I recommend for container 
gardening) doesn’t have any disease spores.
 
 Even though container vegetables tend to have fewer pest problems, 
you should quickly deal with any problems that arise so your whole 
crop isn’t wiped out. Solve your pest problems by using the same 
techniques that you use in your garden. Check out Chapter 17 to read 
about controls for specific diseases and insects.
 
 Because container vegetables are often located on patios or decks that 
are close to the house, special care should be used in spraying them 
for pests. I know I said container vegetables don’t get as many pests as 
in the garden, but you may have to spray occasionally; so, if possible, 
move the containers away from the doors and windows when you spray.

Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
Experimenting with Greenhouses, 
Hoop Houses, and Hydroponics
You can grow cucumbers, tomatoes, and other vegetables in the dead of 
winter in a greenhouse (an enclosed, heated, controlled-atmosphere room). 
In fact, farmers throughout the world do it all the time. You don’t even have 
to have a glass structure for a greenhouse. You can use plastic hoop houses 
instead. They’re easy to build, inexpensive, and a great way to extend the 
growing season. (See Chapter 21 for more on hoop houses.) Either way, 
greenhouse growing is more involved — it’s container gardening and 
vegetable growing at their highest levels; everything has to be just right to 
get a good crop. But maybe I’ve helped turn you into a really good gardener, 
so everything will be just right. After all, that was the point of this book.
 
You need to pay attention to many more conditions in a greenhouse, such 
as temperatures that are too hot and too cool, fertility, pests (once they get 
started, they’re tough to stop in a greenhouse), pollination for crops like 
cucumbers and melons, and so on. You generally have to be more dedicated to 
vegetable gardening to grow good crops in a greenhouse. The easiest time to 
grow them is in the spring and fall to extend the season. Winter and summer 
are the toughest times to grow plants in a greenhouse because of the extremes 
in temperature and available light.
Another term that’s associated with container vegetables is hydroponics (see 
the appendix for companies specializing in hydroponics). You may have 
bought hydroponic tomatoes at the grocery store, or you may have seen the 
amazing hydroponic lettuce at Disney World. When you grow hydroponic 
vegetables, you grow the plants in a soilless, liquid solution that provides 
all the plant’s nutrient needs. You need special equipment and growing 
techniques, but you can grow any plant this way.
For more information on growing plants in greenhouses and hoop houses, 
visit growinggreenhouse.com. If you want to read more about growing 
plants hydroponically, check out www.hydroponics-at-home.com.

Chapter 19
Harvesting, Storing, and 
Preserving Vegetables
In This Chapter
▶ Harvesting your vegetables at the right times
▶ Storing your crops
▶ Preserving your crops by freezing, drying, or canning
▶ Saving seeds from your vegetables
S
uppose that you’ve done everything you need to do in your garden: You 
planted your veggies at the right time, watered and fertilized them as 
needed, and kept an eye out for pests. Way to go. Now for the best part: It’s 
time to eat!
To get all the best flavor and highest nutritional value from your vegetables, 
you need to pick them at just the right time. Some vegetables taste terrible if 
you pick them too early; others are tough and stringy if you pick them too late.
And after you pick your vegetables, what if you can’t eat them right away? 
When properly stored, most vegetables last a while without rotting or losing 
too much flavor (of course, eating them fresh picked is always best). In fact, 
you can store some vegetables, like potatoes and winter squash, for months.
So in this chapter, I discuss harvesting and storing your fresh vegetables. You 
put in too much work not to do the final steps just right.
Knowing When to Harvest
You should harvest most vegetables when they’re young and tender, which 
often means harvesting the plants, roots, or fruits before they reach full size. 
A 15-inch zucchini is impressive, but it tastes better at 6 to 8 inches. Similarly, 
carrots and beets get woody (tough textured) and bland the longer they stay 
in the ground. Table 19-1 provides specific information on when to harvest a 
variety of veggies.

302
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
Other plants are continuously harvested to keep them productive. If you 
keep harvesting vegetables like snap beans, summer squash, snow and snap 
peas, broccoli, okra, spinach, and lettuce, they’ll continue to produce pods, 
shoots, or leaves.
 
A good rule for many of your early crops is to start harvesting when you have 
enough of a vegetable for a one-meal serving. Spinach, Swiss chard, scallions, 
radishes, lettuce, and members of the cabbage family certainly fit the bill here. 
These veggies don’t grow as well in warm weather, so pick these crops in the 
spring when temperatures are cooler.
After you start harvesting, visit your garden and pick something daily. Take 
along a good sharp knife and a few containers to hold your produce, such as 
paper bags, buckets, or baskets. Wire or wood buckets work well because 
you can easily wash vegetables in them.

The harvesting information in Table 19-1 is based on picking mature or slightly 
immature vegetables. But many vegetables can be picked smaller and still 
have excellent flavor. Pick baby vegetables whenever they reach the size that 
you want. The following vegetables can be picked small: beets, broccoli, 
carrots, cauliflower, cucumbers, lettuce and other greens, onions, peas, 
potatoes, radishes, snap beans, summer squash, Swiss chard, and turnips. 
In addition, some small varieties of corn and tomatoes fit the baby-vegetable 
mold.
 
Be sure to avoid harvesting at the following times:
 
✓ When plants, especially beans, are wet. Many fungal diseases spread 
in moist conditions, and if you brush your tools or pant legs against 
diseased plants, you can transfer disease organisms to other plants 
down the row.

304
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
✓ In the heat of the day, because the vegetable’s texture may be limp. 
For the freshest produce, harvest early in the day when vegetables’ 
moisture levels inside the vegetables are highest and the vegetables are 
at peak flavor. After harvesting, refrigerate the produce and prepare it 
later in the day.
In the fall, wait as long as you can to dig up root crops, such as carrots, 
rutabagas, and beets, if you intend to store them in a root cellar or cold 
storage room. However, remember that while root crops can withstand frosts, 
you should harvest them before the ground freezes. They’ll come out of the 
ground easiest if the soil is still slightly moist. Also, don’t wash crops that are 
going to the root cellar; instead, just gently brush away soil crumbs. Use any 
blemished or cut vegetables within a few days.
Putting Away Your Vegetables
You have only two choices when you harvest your crops: Eat the veggies 
right away, or store them to use later. Specific vegetables need different 
storage conditions to maintain their freshness. These conditions can be 
summarized as follows:
 
✓ Cool and dry: Ideally, temperatures should be between 50 and 60 
degrees Fahrenheit, with 60-percent relative humidity — conditions you 
usually find in a well-ventilated basement.
 
✓ Cold and dry: Temperatures should be between 32 and 40 degrees, with 
65-percent humidity. You can achieve these conditions in most home 
refrigerators or in a cold basement or garage.
 
✓ Cool and moist: Temperatures should be between 50 and 60 degrees 
with 90-percent humidity. You can store vegetables in a cool kitchen or 
basement in perforated plastic bags.
 
✓ Cold and moist: Ideally, your storage area should be 32 to 40 degrees, 
with 95-percent humidity. You can create these conditions by placing 
your vegetables in perforated bags (vegetables in bags without ventilation 
are likely to degrade faster) and storing the bags in a refrigerator.
 
 You also can create cold and moist conditions in a root cellar. An 
unheated basement works well as a root cellar. However, these days, 
most homes have heaters or furnaces in the basement, which make 
the conditions too warm for storing vegetables. But if you don’t have 
a heater, or if you can section off a portion of your basement and keep 
temperatures just above freezing, you can store vegetables like root 
crops and even cabbage for long periods of time.

305
 Chapter 19: Harvesting, Storing, and Preserving Vegetables
 
 Make sure your vegetables are well ventilated in the root cellar; you 
can store onions, potatoes, and other root crops in mesh bags. Shoot 
for a humidity level that’s as high as you can get. To increase humidity, 
spread moist wood shavings or sawdust on the floor but keep the 
vegetables elevated on wooden boxes.
In Table 19-2, I provide specifics on how to store your vegetables so that after 
you pick them, you quickly know what to do with them (that is, if you don’t 
eat them right away). Table 19-2 also includes information on whether you 
can freeze, dry, or can vegetables, topics that I cover later in this chapter.

If you want to store vegetables, make sure you harvest them at their peak 
ripeness. Also avoid bruising the produce, because bruises hasten rotting. The 
storage times in Table 19-2 are only estimates; they can vary widely depending 
on conditions. Store only the highest quality vegetables for long periods of 
time; vegetables that are damaged or scarred are likely to rot and spoil 
everything nearby.
 
If you live in an area where the ground freezes in the winter, you can actually 
leave some root crops — including carrots, leeks, rutabagas, and turnips — in 
the ground and harvest all winter long. After a good, hard frost, but before 
the ground freezes, cover your vegetable bed with a foot or more of dry hay. 
Cover the hay with heavy plastic (4 to 6 millimeters) and secure the edges 
with rocks, bricks, or heavy boards. The plastic keeps rain and snow from 
trickling down through the hay and rotting your vegetables, and it also keeps 
the soil from freezing solid. You can harvest periodically through winter, but 
be careful to re-cover the opening after each harvest.
Freezing, Drying, and Canning Veggies
You can preserve vegetables three different ways — by freezing, drying, or 
canning them — to make your harvest last longer than if you stored your 
vegetables fresh. (Refer to Table 19-2 for information on whether a particular 
vegetable can be frozen, dried, or canned.) I don’t have room to cover all 
the details about these different methods, but the following list gives you a 
thumbnail sketch of each technique:
 
✓ Freezing: This is probably the easiest way to preserve vegetables. Heck, 
if you want, just puree up some tomatoes, put them in a container, and 
throw them in the freezer — they’ll last for months. The mix is great to 
use in spaghetti sauce or soups.

308
Part III: Getting Down and Dirty in Your Vegetable Garden 
 
 You also can freeze some vegetables, like beans or peas, whole. But 
usually you have to blanch them first to preserve their color and texture. 
Blanching is simply the process of dipping the vegetables in boiling 
water for a minute or two and then placing them in ice water to cool 
them off. Then you dry the vegetables with a towel and freeze them in 
labeled plastic freezer bags. Simple.
 
✓ Drying: This technique can be pretty easy, but it must be done properly 
to prevent spoilage. Basically, you dehydrate the vegetables by laying 
them out in the sun to dry, by slow baking them in the oven, or by using 
a commercial dehydrator, which you can buy in most mail-order catalogs 
(see the appendix). In hot, sunny climates like California, you can dry 
‘Roma’ tomatoes by slicing them in half and laying them out in the sun 
on a screen.
 
 Spoilage is always a concern, so before drying your vegetables, you may 
need to get some additional information. You usually need to store dried 
vegetables in airtight containers; lidded jars work well. You can use 
dried vegetables to make soups and sauces.
 
✓ Canning: Of all preserved vegetables, I like the taste of canned tomatoes 
the best. Nothing tastes better in the middle of winter. But canning is a 
delicate and labor-intensive procedure that can require peeling, sterilizing 
jars, cooking, boiling, and a lot of other work. I usually set aside a whole 
weekend to can tomatoes and other veggies. I don’t want to discourage 
you, but you need some good recipes, some special equipment, and 
probably some help if you want to can vegetables.
 
For help with freezing, drying, and canning vegetables and herbs, I like to refer 
to the bible, The Ball Blue Book of Preserving (Alltrista Consumer Products, 
2004). Or you can check out Canning and Preserving For Dummies by Karen 
Ward. Your local Cooperative Extension Service office also is a good source of 
information on preserving vegetables. Finally, I have come across many great 
Web sites on home food preservation as well. Here are a few to try:
 
✓ Home Food Preservation (foodsafety.psu.edu/lets_preserve.
html)
 
✓ National Center for Home Food Preservation (www.uga.edu/nchfp)
 
✓ Pick-Your-Own (www.pickyourown.org)
Saving Vegetable Seeds
If you have a favorite vegetable variety that’s suited to your tastes or 
growing conditions, or if you have a particular plant that thrives in your 

309
 Chapter 19: Harvesting, Storing, and Preserving Vegetables
garden, you can save those plants’ seeds and possibly even improve their 
qualities to better fit your needs. If you collect seeds from only the best 
plants year after year, the qualities that you want will eventually be more 
present and predictable.
 
Hybrid seeds won’t come true to type (the exact same plant) if you collect the 
seeds and try to grow them a year later. Open-pollinated varieties are more 
likely to give you what you expect.
Saving your own seeds also may be the only way to keep some heirloom 
varieties alive. Some heirlooms are difficult or impossible to obtain, but they 
have something special to offer, such as adaptation to a specific climate, 
certain types of disease resistance, or especially good flavor. Heirloom 
varieties represent a reservoir of genes that plant breeders can use to 
improve present and future crops.
The appendix lists organizations dedicated to heirloom varieties. Here are 
some Web sites that provide information on how to save some of your own 
vegetable seeds:
 
✓ International Seed Saving Institute (www.seedsave.org/issi/
issi_904.html)
 
✓ Cornell University (counties.cce.cornell.edu/suffolk/

T
his part is all about quick lists of handy gardening 
tools and methods of season extending. Chapter 20 
goes into details about the ten best tools to use in the 
garden — what’s essential and what’s fun to have. In 
Chapter 21, I talk about nearly ten good ways to extend 
the gardening season with row covers, cloches, cold 
frames, and greenhouses. It’s for those gardeners who 
can’t get enough of growing their own fresh produce.

Chapter 20
Ten Tools of the Trade
In This Chapter
▶ Identifying essential tools for your vegetable garden
▶ Using the right tool for the right situation
You’ve probably heard this saying at least a hundred times: “Use the 
right tool for the job.” It’s as true in vegetable gardening as it is for any 
other project. The right tool allows you to finish a job faster, and even more 
importantly, make working in your garden easier on your body. After all, most 
people garden not to labor and sweat but to enjoy the vegetables and the 
relaxing environment.
As a new gardener, however, you may find that knowing which tools to pick 
is often confusing. You can spend hundreds of dollars buying tools for every 
imaginable use, but you may end up spending more time in your tool shed 
than in your garden. So when you’re selecting your tools, my solution is to 
keep it simple — that’s why I chose to highlight only ten tools in this chapter. 
And keep in mind that even these tools may not be appropriate for all garden 
situations.
 
Many of the items you need are probably already around your house — 
especially if you’re working on other outdoor projects. Here’s a short list of 
some useful gardening gear:
 
✓ Gloves help you grip tools better and help you avoid hand blisters. 
Cotton gloves are the cheapest, but the more expensive animal skin 
gloves — made of goat and sheep skin, for example — last longer.
 
✓ A good straw hat with ventilation keeps the sun off your skin and allows 
air to move through and cool your head.
 
✓ A good pocketknife or pair of pruning shears is great for cutting strings 
and vines.
 
✓ Sturdy rubber boots, garden clogs, or work boots repel water and 
provide support for digging.
 
✓ Bug repellent and sunscreen help keep you comfortable and protected 
while working in the garden.

314
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Now on to the specific garden tools that you need. Depending on the size 
and type of garden you have, the “right tool” can vary widely. In this chapter, 
I describe ten essential tools and talk about the garden situations for which 
they’re best suited. Many gardening tools are ergonomically designed to work 
more efficiently and put less stress on your joints. I highlight these ergonomic 
tools as well as provide helpful tips on how to use the tools and put less strain 
on your back, arms, wrists, and legs. So get ready to start digging in your garden!
 
To keep your metal hand tools functioning for years, clean and store them 
properly. After you’re finished using a tool, wash all soil off it. Yearly, sharpen 
the blades of weeders, spades, and shovels; oil wooden handles with linseed 
oil; and tighten any nuts and screws on the handles.
Watering Hoses and Cans
Plants need water to grow, and if Mother Nature isn’t cooperating, you need to 
water regularly (see Chapter 15 for watering techniques). For a large garden, 
you may need elaborate soaker hoses, sprinklers, and drip irrigation pipes. But 
for most small-scale home gardeners, a simple hose and watering can will do.
Rubber hoses are less likely to kink than vinyl or nylon hoses, but they tend 
to be much heavier to move around. Whatever material you choose, be sure 
to get a hose that’s long enough to reach plants in all areas of your garden 
without having to shoot water across the beds to reach distant plants. 
Choose a hose that has brass fittings and a washer integrated into the hose; 
these elements make the hose less likely to fail after prolonged use.
Watering cans can be made of simple, inexpensive, brightly colored plastic 
or high-end, fancy galvanized metal. Plastic is lighter, but galvanized metal is 
rustproof and more attractive. Watering cans also come in different sizes, so 
try a few out for comfort before buying. Make sure you can easily remove the 
sprinkler head, or rose, for cleaning.
 
For watering tender seedlings, buy a can with an oval rose that points upward 
and applies water with less pressure. The traditional round rose is better for 
watering more mature plants.
Hand Trowels
Hand trowels are essential for digging in containers, window boxes, and 
small raised beds. The wider-bladed hand trowels, which are scoop shaped 
and rounded on the end, are easier to use to loosen soil than the narrower-
bladed, V-pointed ones. These narrower blades are better for digging tough 
weeds, such as dandelions.

315
 Chapter 20: Ten Tools of the Trade
Hand trowel blades usually are made of steel or plastic. Steel blades are more 
durable, but plastic blades are lighter. Although stainless steel versions are 
more expensive than plastic ones, they’re easier to clean and easier to find if 
you lose them. The handles may be steel, wooden, or plastic. Choose a trowel 
that’s forged as one piece of metal or that has secure attachments between 
the blade and handle.
Try different hand trowels before buying, choosing one that feels comfortable 
and that fits your hand well. Ergonomic versions of hand trowels have forearm 
supports and cushioned grips.
Hand Cultivators
A three-pronged hand cultivator is a handy tool to break up soil clods, smooth 
seed beds, and work in granular fertilizer. Plus, after you plant your small 
container or raised bed, the weeds will come whether you like it or not; a 
cultivator serves as a great tool to remove these young weeds as they 
germinate. When you’re digging a planting hole, a hand cultivator breaks up 
the soil more easily than a hand trowel.
As with a hand trowel, be sure to choose a hand cultivator that feels 
comfortable in your hand and that has a handle securely fastened to the 
blade. The steel-bladed types are the most durable.
Garden Hoes
Hoes are available for all occasions — hoes for digging furrows, hoes for 
weeding, hoes for wide rows, hoes for tight rows, hoes that scuffle, hoes that 
oscillate, and even hoes for specific vegetables such as the onion hoe. What 
you need largely depends on the design of your garden. The best hoes have 
long hardwood handles and single-forged steel blades strongly attached to 
their handles. Here are three favorites:
 
✓ Common garden hoe: This classic hoe has a broad, straight, 6-inch steel 
blade that’s good for all types of gardening, including digging, weeding, 
chopping, hilling, and cultivating. Longer- and narrower-bladed versions, 
such as the collinear hoe, are good for weeding in tight spots.
 
✓ Oscillating hoe (also known as a stirrup hoe): This hoe, shown in 
Figure 20-1, is primarily used for weeding. Unlike other hoes — which 
cut weeds on the pull stroke — this hoe cuts weeds on the pull stroke 
and the push stroke, enabling you to weed faster. The 4- to 7-inch-wide 
steel stirrup is hinged so it moves back and forth, digging about 
1⁄4 inch 
deep into the soil and scalping off young weeds. This hoe works well in 

316
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
gardens with clearly defined rows and spaces between plants. Like all 
hoes, the blade works best when it’s sharpened regularly.
 
✓ Tined hoe: This hoe is my favorite. It has 3 or 4 steel tines attached to 
the bottom of a 5- to 6-inch-diameter steel head. Tined hoes are good for 
weeding, cultivating, digging, chopping, hilling, and breaking up soil clods. 
They’re lighter, more versatile, and easier to use than common hoes.
 
Figure 20-1: 
An 
oscillating 
hoe.
 
 
If hoeing gives you a sore back, try the Swan-Neck hoe. This wooden-handled, 
metal-bladed hoe is curved at its neck in such a way that you can stand 
straight up (not bending) as you work your way down those rows of beans.
Spades and Shovels
Spades and shovels are two of the most commonly used gardening tools. The 
difference between the two is simple: A spade is designed for digging, and 
a shovel is designed for scooping and throwing. Shovels traditionally have 
rounded and pointed blades, whereas spades have flat, straight, almost 
rectangular blades. A good shovel is essential in any garden for spreading 
compost, manure, or fertilizer. A spade is essential for edging or breaking new 
ground. However, many gardeners use spades for anything from cutting open 
fertilizer bags to hammering in stakes. Good spades are rugged.
Both spades and shovels come in short- and long-handled versions. A long 
handle gives you more leverage when digging holes, so keep that in mind 
if you’re purchasing a new spade. I find that I use a short-handled shovel 

317
 Chapter 20: Ten Tools of the Trade
with a D-shaped grip more often in my garden than a spade. Choose a spade 
or a shovel that has a single piece of metal attached to a wooden handle 
with either a single socket or a single socket that runs 1 foot up the handle 
(referred to as a solid-strap connection). These models are heavier, but 
they’re much more durable.
 
To get a more comfortable grip on long-handled tools like spades and shovels, 
try low-cost foam grippers that fit on the handles. These grippers make the 
diameter of a handle larger and more cushioned, reducing the amount of 
blistering and cramping in your hands. They’re available at local garden cen-
ters or on the Internet.
Garden Forks
As handy as a spade is for turning fresh garden soil, I find that an iron fork 
is a better tool for turning beds that have been worked before. The fork digs 
into the soil as deep as 12 inches, and at the same time breaks up clods and 
loosens and aerates the soil better than a spade. Iron forks look similar to 
short-handled spades except that they have three to four iron tines on their 
heads. The best ones are those forged from one piece of steel with hardwood 
handles firmly attached. They’re great not only for turning soil but for turning 
compost piles and digging root crops, such as potatoes and carrots.
Garden Rakes
After you dig soil, you need to level it, break up soil clods, and smooth the 
seedbeds (especially if you’re growing raised beds, which are described in 
Chapter 3). An iron rake is the right tool for the job even though you may use 
it for this purpose only a few times a year. A 14-inch-diameter, iron-toothed 
rake should have a long, wooden handle that’s securely attached to a metal 
head. You can flip the metal head over to really smooth a seedbed flat. For a 
lightweight but less durable version of an iron rake, try an aluminum rake.
Buckets, Wagons, and Baskets
Okay, you don’t have a 1,000-square-foot garden. But you still need to carry 
seeds, tools, fertilizer, produce, and other items around. I love talking about 
storage containers because this is where the tools of the trade get really 
simple. Here are three essential containers:

318
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Buckets: For fertilizers, potting soil, and hand tools, a 5-gallon plastic 
bucket is the perfect container. You can probably get one free from a 
construction site; just make sure to clean it out well. For a more durable 
but smaller bucket, buy one made from galvanized steel.
 
✓ Wagons: For bulkier items, such as flats of seedlings, use a child’s old 
red wagon. Wagons are great for moving plants and small bags of fertilizer 
in your garden, and the lip on the wagon bed helps hold these items in 
place when you cover bumpy ground. If you’re interested in a wagon to 
move yourself (and not just equipment) around the garden, a new 
invention is a wagon with a seat. This type of wagon usually has a 
swiveling seat and is perched on four pneumatic tires, allowing you to 
sit and push yourself through the garden as you work (see Figure 20-2). 
It has storage space under the seat as well.
 
Figure 20-2: 
A wagon 
with a seat 
and storage 
space is 
useful in the 
garden.
 
 
✓ Baskets: To gather all that great produce you grow and harvest, invest in 
a wire or wicker basket. Wire baskets are easier to use because you can 
wash the produce while it’s still in the basket. Wicker and wooden baskets, 
though less durable than metal, are more aesthetically pleasing and 
stylish in your garden. Piling your produce in either basket is a lot more 
functional than trying to balance zucchinis in your arms while carrying 
them from your garden to your kitchen.

319
 Chapter 20: Ten Tools of the Trade
Wheelbarrows and Garden Carts
Invariably you need to move heavy items such as soil and fertilizer from one 
spot to another in your yard or garden. The two main options for moving 
stuff that’s “larger than a bread box” are wheelbarrows and garden carts. The 
basic difference between the two vehicles is the wheels. Wheelbarrows have 
one wheel and an oval, metal tray; garden carts have two wheels and a 
rectangular wooden tray.
Wheelbarrows are maneuverable in tight places, can turn on a dime, and are 
easy to dump. A contractor-type wheelbarrow has a deeper box and is worth 
the extra investment because of its superior quality. For a lightweight 
wheelbarrow, try one with a box made out of plastic.
Garden carts are better balanced, can carry larger loads, and are easier to 
push than wheelbarrows. A larger-sized garden cart can easily handle loads 
of compost, soil, rocks, and bales of hay. Some garden carts have removable 
back panels that make dumping easier.
Power Tillers
The old-fashioned rear- or front-tined power tiller was designed to help 
large-scale gardeners save time turning their gardens in spring and fall. 
The large power tillers (more than a 5-horsepower engine) are best if you 
have 1,000 square feet or more to till. They also can be indispensable tools 
for forming raised beds and breaking sod.
 
If you only need to use a large tiller once a year, consider renting one from a 
local rental store or hiring someone to till for you.
Because home gardens have become smaller in recent years, tiller 
manufacturers have responded by designing a new group of tillers called 
minitillers (see Figure 20-3). These two-cycle, 1- to 2-horsepower tillers weigh 
only 20 to 30 pounds, are easy to handle, and can till in tight places. Not only 
do they have tilling tines, but they come with other attachments such as lawn 
aerators, edgers, and lawn dethatchers.
Minitillers work best in previously worked, loamy soil without large stones. 
Unlike their larger cousins, minitillers are easy to handle when you’re weeding 
between rows of vegetables and close to plants. However, they aren’t good 
for breaking new ground or tilling stony or heavily weeded areas in your 
garden. Because they’re lightweight, they till raised beds and small gardens 
very well. Electric models are available if you don’t like the noise and smell of 
a two-cycle engine.

appendix to find out where you can get minitillers.)

Chapter 21
Nearly Ten Ways to Extend 
Your Growing Season
In This Chapter
▶ Starting your veggies earlier in the season
▶ Extending your harvest into the cold-weather season
A
fter you start vegetable gardening, you may get hooked on having fresh 
vegetables from your garden year-round. Unless you live in a mild climate, 
such as zones 9 and 10 (see the appendix for more on zones), the best way to 
get the most vegetables from your garden is to use season-extending devices. 
These devices protect your vegetables from deadly frosts in fall and enable 
you to get an earlier start in spring. Of course, selecting the right vegetables 
to grow also is vital to your success.
In general, greens, root crops, and cool-season cole crops are the best vegetables 
to grow in cold weather. (See the specific chapters on these vegetables for 
growing information.) However, you can extend the length of time that you 
harvest warm-season crops — such as melons, tomatoes, and peppers — 
by using the season-extending methods in this chapter. Whatever plants you 
grow, these techniques enable you to harvest fresh vegetables for most of 
the year.
Choose Clever Planting Locations
Where you plant your vegetables has as much to do with avoiding frosts and 
cold weather as when you plant. Every yard has pockets or areas that warm 
up earlier in spring and stay warmer later into the fall. For example, the nook 
near my kitchen window on the south side of my house is such a location. 
That area is the first place that snow melts, and plants in this location grow 
well past the time when frost has killed vegetables in my main garden. Find 
these nooks in your yard, plant cold-hardy vegetables like spinach and 
broccoli, and enjoy harvesting earlier and later than anyone else on the block.

322
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
Some good nook areas to check out in any yard are the south-side walls of 
buildings, especially if you can find a spot that’s protected from wind. 
Courtyards are notoriously good microclimates. (See Chapter 3 for more on 
microclimates.) Other good spots include areas around evergreen shrubs (as 
long as enough sun pokes through them to grow the plants) and near paved 
surfaces such as driveways or walkways — especially if the pavement is dark 
colored.
Time Your Planting Wisely
 
Timing is important when you grow vegetables. Here are some guidelines to 
follow:
 
✓ If you want early vegetables, start your seeds indoors in late winter or 
early spring (as I explain in Chapter 13). Then you can transplant the 
young seedlings into a season extender, such as a cold frame, cloche, or 
hot cap (all of which I describe later in this chapter).
 
✓ If you want your vegetables to last longer into winter, start them at the 
end of the summer, but be sure to start them early enough that by the 
dark months (December and January), they’ll be full-sized and edible. 
During these months, don’t expect much growth, even in warm areas, 
because the light is less intense and the day is much shorter. You’ll be 
extending the harvest season, not the growing season. (Unless, of course, 
you’re in a warm location and trying to overwinter these vegetables for 
a spring harvest; see Chapter 19 for details.)
Protect Plants with Hot Caps
Hot caps are a great way to protect individual prized plants from the cold. A 
hot cap is usually a clear plastic, pyramid-shaped cone with an opening in its 
top to let hot air out. You can buy these cones at garden centers, or you can 
create your own by cutting the bottoms out of clear plastic milk jugs. If you 
do create your own, be sure to cut a vent at the top of the milk jugs to let hot 
air out on sunny days. Or use them only at night. You can cover the hole with 
a blanket at night if you expect chilly temperatures.

323
 Chapter 21: Nearly Ten Ways to Extend Your Growing Season
Add Elegance to Your Garden 
with Glass Cloches
If you really want something elegant in your garden, you can spend up to $50 
on tinted glass hot caps, affectionately called cloches, as shown in Figure 21-1. 
They’re sturdy and beautiful, and yes, they protect tender plants from the 
cold — even a little better than plastic hot caps do. However, cloches don’t 
have vents, so during sunny days you need to remove them or prop them up 
to let cool air in.
 
Figure 21-1: 
A glass 
cloche.
 
Buy or Build Cold Frames
Cold frames essentially are mini-greenhouses. They’re usually wooden boxes 
covered with windowpanes or clear plastic (see Figure 21-2). Some professional 
gardeners as far north as zone 5, where winter temperatures can dip down 
to –20 degrees Fahrenheit, can harvest vegetables every month of the year by 
planting cold-weather-tolerant crops in cold frames.
You can purchase a premade cold frame for $100 to $200, or you can create 
your own simple cold frame by following these steps:

324
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
Figure 21-2: 
A sample 
cold frame.
 
 
1. Build a 3-foot-x-6-foot box from untreated lumber. Cut the box so that 
the back is 18 inches high, sloping to a front height of 14 inches.
 
 This sloping angle enables more sun to reach the plants, and it sheds 
rain and snow as well.
 
2. Hinge an old window sash over the top of the cold frame or make a 
frame by using tightly stretched clear plastic, which creates a sealed 
growing environment.
 
 You can insulate the cold frame by adding rigid foam insulation around 
the insides of the cold frame and by weather stripping along the top 
edge.
 
3. Position the cold frame so that it faces south.
 
 It’s best to put a cold frame next to a structure, such as a house, to
protect it from cold winds.
 
Even though the purpose of a cold frame is to trap heat, on sunny days, even 
in winter, a cold frame can get so hot that it burns the plants. Check your cold 
frame once a day on sunny days, opening or venting the top slightly to allow 
hot air to escape.

325
 Chapter 21: Nearly Ten Ways to Extend Your Growing Season
Drape Row Covers over Veggies
A row cover can be a clear plastic cover draped over half-circle wire hoops 
to create a tunnel effect (see Figure 21-3), or it can be the new lightweight 
cheesecloth-like fabric that’s so light it floats on top of your vegetables. Both 
plastic and floating row covers protect plants from light freezes; however, if 
you expect really chilly temperatures (around 20 degrees), use another 
protection device, such as a cloche.
 
Clear plastic heats up your crops faster and warmer than floating row cover 
material, but it needs venting to keep the plants from overheating. Floating 
row covers let in air, light, and water and don’t overheat as easily as clear 
plastic row covers. You also can use both materials to protect your plants 
from insects.
 
Figure 21-3: 
A clear 
plastic grow 
tunnel.
 
Place Wall O’ Waters around Plants
Wall O’ Waters (see Figure 21-4) are double-walled, clear-plastic cylinders 
that hold narrow columns of water around your favorite vegetables. By 
placing Wall O’ Waters around heat-loving plants, such as tomatoes, you can 
get a jump on spring. The water in the cylinders absorbs the warmth of the 
sun during the day and slowly releases the stored heat at night to protect 
your plants in cold temperatures. Even if the water freezes, it releases enough 
heat to protect your plants. Wall O’ Waters have been reported to protect 
tomatoes in temperatures as low as 16 degrees.

326
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
Figure 21-4: 
This Wall 
O’ Water 
surrounds 
a tomato 
plant.
 
 
To prevent overheating during the day, leave the tops open. For added 
protection at night, collapse the tops of these devices into a pyramid shape. 
Of course, after a plant has grown for a few weeks, it will outgrow the plastic 
cylinder, so you’ll have to remove the Wall O’ Water. But what a jump on the 
growing season you’ll have by then!
Try Portable Greenhouses 
and Hoop Houses
If you really want to extend the growing season, stop fooling around with hot 
caps and blankets and buy a portable greenhouse or hoop house. You can 
find many different free-standing portable greenhouses on the market that 
are great for getting an early jump on the growing season and extending it 
into the fall. Walk-through hoop houses also have become popular because 
of their low cost and ease of use. They have a metal shell with clear plastic 
pulled over it and doors on either side. They keep the air warmer than a cold 
frame, but they’re not as warm as a conventional greenhouse. Greenhouses 
and hoop houses can range in price from $200 to $2,000, depending on the 
materials and size. In the appendix, I list a number of manufacturers and 
suppliers that can help you choose the right greenhouse or hoop house for 
your location.

Appendix
Planning Guidelines and 
Other Resources
T
his appendix is vegetables by the numbers. All the distances, depths, and 
yields for more than 40 vegetables are listed in the section “Guidelines 
for Planting,” which includes a chart that provides a great way for you to 
sketch your garden before you plant. The section “Frost Dates and the Length 
of the Growing Season” tells you what you need to know to avoid freezing out 
your veggies and stunting your crop. I also provide a guide to the hardiness 
zones and include a list of suppliers of vegetable seeds and other materials to 
get you started. And if you need even more information, I include a listing of 
Master Gardener organizations and Web sites by state.
Guidelines for Planting
The best way to plan your garden is to start by deciding how much produce 
you want. For example, if you like lettuce, 25 heads will take approximately 25 
feet of row. The recommended distances between rows in Table A-1 tell you 
how much space to leave between crops.
Use the information in Table A-1 as a general guideline. You may choose to 
vary the distance between rows, for example, depending on the method 
of planting or cultivating. You usually can hand-hoe weeds between rows 
adequately in 18- or 24-inch-wide pathways; rototilling is faster, but pathways 
should be 30 or 36 inches wide to do so. If you garden intensively, such as in 
raised beds, you can space plants closer than indicated in the chart.
The days to maturity and the yield figures are averages. Depending on 
weather, soil fertility, pests, and weed pressure, yield and maturities in 
your garden can vary greatly. Just remember, you can always find friends, 
relatives, and bunnies who’d love some fresh, homegrown produce.

Vegetable Gardening For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
Frost Dates and the Length 
of the Growing Season
You can grow vegetables anywhere! Some of the largest, most beautiful 
vegetables I’ve ever seen are grown by avid gardeners in Alaska. If you can 
grow vegetables where the sun doesn’t shine for 6 months of the year, you 
know that they must be easy to grow.
Table A-2 is a chart of the average annual first and last frost dates as well 
as the length of the frost-free growing season in 100 cities across the United 
States. Of course, this chart is only a guide, and your local climate will vary 
depending on many factors, including the variation in weather from year to 
year. Also, because of global warming, some gardeners are noticing longer 
growing seasons than in the past. So to get the most accurate dates, contact 
your local weather service or the Cooperative Extension Service office in 
your area. (To find your Extension Service office, check your state land grant 
university listings in the phone book.)
 
Keep in mind that just because your frost-free growing season is only so 
many days, many vegetables that I list can tolerate a light frost. And you can 
extend your growing season by using special growing techniques (described 
in Chapter 21). However, warm-season vegetables, such as tomatoes, don’t like 
even a touch of frost, so Table A-2 is much more accurate for estimating how 
many days you have to grow your favorite heat-loving vegetables.

Hardiness Zones in North America
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has helpfully divided North America into 
plant hardiness zones based on average annual minimum temperatures; I 
refer to these hardiness zones throughout this book. Planting instructions 
regarding depth and timing may change depending on what zone you’re in. 
Because of global warming, as with the length of the growing season (see the 
previous section), some gardeners find they now can grow less hardy plants 

336
Vegetable Gardening For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
in their area. Check with local Master Gardeners and garden centers to 
determine which plants are best for your area, and check out www.garden.
org/zipzone to find out your own zone. (I list Master Gardener resources 
later in this appendix.)
 
Your hardiness zone isn’t as critical for vegetable growing as it is for growing 
fruits, perennial flowers, trees, and shrubs. However, knowing your hardiness 
zone is a good idea because in some warm areas, such as zones 7 and 8, you 
can grow two or three crops of the same vegetable in 1 year or even grow 
vegetables throughout the winter.
Where to Find Seeds and 
Other Resources
Vegetable seeds are available seemingly everywhere in the spring. From 
grocery stores to local garden centers, home centers, and hardware stores, 
everyone seems to sell seed packets. If you’re interested in the standard 
vegetable varieties, these locations are great places to get them. However, if 
you’re interested in some of the more unusual varieties that I mention in this 
book, try the catalog companies listed in the following sections. These 
companies mostly sell seeds within North America. Check other Web sites, 
such as www.davesgarden.com, for listings of vegetable seed suppliers in 
other parts of the world.
You may, however, want to avoid seed starting altogether and buy transplants. 
Local garden and home centers offer a broad selection of vegetable and 
fruit plants for sale in spring. Also, catalog companies now offer transplants 
through the mail. In the following sections, I indicate which companies 
currently offer transplants through their catalogs.
Finally, I include a list of fruit and berry nurseries for a broader selection 
and cheaper prices than what you may find locally as well as a list of tool 
and equipment suppliers for many of the products and devices I mention in 
this book. Part of the fun of gardening is shopping for new stuff, so check out 
these companies online. Or, if you like the armchair experience, write for a 
printed catalog. Some companies charge a small fee for their catalogs, but 
most are free.
