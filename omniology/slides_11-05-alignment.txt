Alignment 
• Most modern machines are 32 or 64 bit 
– 8 bits in a byte 
– 4  or 8 bytes in a word 
– Machines are either byte or word addressable

Alignment 
• Data is word aligned if it begins at a word boundary 
 
• Most machines have some alignment restrictions 
– Or performance penalties for poor alignment

Alignment 
• Example: A string 
“Hello” 
Takes 5 characters (without a terminating \0) 
 
• To word align next word, add 3 “padding” characters to 
the string 
 
• The padding is not part of the string, it’s just unused 
memory
