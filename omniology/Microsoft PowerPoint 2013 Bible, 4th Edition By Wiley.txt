S
ome books zoom through a software program so fast it makes your head spin. You’ll 
come out dizzy but basically able to cobble together some sort of result, even if it 
doesn’t look quite right. This is not one of those books.
PowerPoint® 2013 Bible is probably the only PowerPoint book you will ever need. In fact, it 
might even be the only book on giving presentations you’ll ever need. No, seriously! I 
mean it.
As you probably guessed by the heft of the book, this is not a quick-ﬁ x shortcut to 
PowerPoint expertise. Instead, it’s a thoughtful, thorough educational tool that can be 
your personal trainer now and your reference text for years to come. That’s because this 
book covers PowerPoint from “cradle to grave.” No matter what your current expertise level 
with PowerPoint, this book brings you up to the level of the most experienced and talented 
PowerPoint users in your ofﬁ ce. You might even be able to teach those old pros a thing or 
two!
When you ﬁ nish this book, you will not only be able to build a presentation with 
PowerPoint, you’ll also be able to explain why you made the choices you did, and you’ll 
deliver that presentation smoothly and with conﬁ dence.
If you are planning a presentation for remote delivery (for example, posting it on a website 
or setting up a kiosk at a trade show), you’ll ﬁ nd lots of help for these situations too. In 
fact, an entire section of the book is devoted to various nontraditional presentation meth-
ods, such as live Internet or network delivery, trade show booths, and interactive presenta-
tion distribution on a disk or CD.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is organized into parts, which are groups of chapters that deal with a common 
general theme. Here’s what you’ll ﬁ nd:
 
■Part I: Building Your Presentation. In this part, you start building a robust, 
content-rich presentation by choosing a template, entering your text, and applying 
text formatting.
 
■Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content. This part teaches you how to 
import and create various types of graphical and multimedia content including clip 
Preface

Preface
art, diagrams, photos, charts, sound effects, movies, and music. You’ll also learn 
here how to create movement with animation effects and transitions.
 
■Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience. This part helps you prepare your pre-
sentation for various delivery scenarios, including printing handouts for a live 
audience, running a live show on a computer screen, designing visual aids for 
user-interactive or self-running presentations, and sharing and collaborating with 
others.
 
■Part IV: Project Labs. This part provides four step-by-step walk-throughs that 
demonstrate how to create some of the most powerful and sought-after PowerPoint 
effects and projects, including creating navigation systems, classroom games, 
complex animations, and graphically presented text. Please visit www.wiley.com
/go/powerpoint2013bible to download the ﬁ les you need for the project labs.
Special Features
Every chapter in this book opens with a quick look at what’s in the chapter and closes with 
a summary. Along the way, you also ﬁ nd icons in the margins to draw your attention to 
speciﬁ c topics and items of interest.
Here’s what the icons mean:
 
These icons point you to chapters or other sources for more information on the topic under discussion.
Notes provide extra information about a topic, perhaps some technical tidbit or background explanation.
Tips offer ideas for the advanced user who wants to get the most out of PowerPoint.
Cautions point out how to avoid the pitfalls that beginners commonly encounter.
Good luck with PowerPoint 2013! I hope you have as much fun reading this book as I had 
writing it. If you would like to let me know what you thought of the book, good or bad, you 
can e-mail me at faithe@wempen.com. I’d like to hear from you!

P
owerPoint 2013 is a member of the Microsoft Ofﬁ ce 2013 suite of programs. A suite is a group 
of programs designed by a single manufacturer to work well together. Like its siblings — Word 
(the word processor), Excel (the spreadsheet), Outlook (the personal organizer and e-mail 
manager), and Access (the database) — PowerPoint has a well-deﬁ ned role. It creates materials for 
presentations.
A presentation is any kind of interaction between a speaker and audience, but it usually involves 
one or more of the following: computer-displayed slides, noncomputerized visual aids (such as 
transparencies or 35mm slides), hard-copy handouts, and/or speaker’s notes. PowerPoint can create 
all of these types of visual aids, plus many other types that you’ll learn about as you go along.
Because PowerPoint is so tightly integrated with the other Microsoft Ofﬁ ce 2013 components, you 
can easily share information among them. For example, if you have created a graph in Excel, you 
can use it on a PowerPoint slide. It goes the other way too. You can, for example, take the outline 
from your PowerPoint presentation and copy it into Word, where you can dress it up with Word’s 
powerful document formatting commands. Virtually any piece of data in any Ofﬁ ce program can be 
linked to any other Ofﬁ ce program, so you never have to worry about your data being in the wrong 
format. PowerPoint also accepts data from almost any other Windows-based application and can 
import a variety of graphics, audio, and video formats.
In this chapter you’ll get a big-picture introduction to PowerPoint 2013, and then we’ll ﬁ re up the 
program and poke around a bit to help you get familiar with the interface. You’ll ﬁ nd out how to 
use the tabs and panes and how to get help and updates from Microsoft.

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Who Uses PowerPoint and Why?
PowerPoint is a popular tool for people who give presentations as part of their jobs and 
also for their support staff. With PowerPoint, you can create visual aids that help get the 
message across to an audience, whatever that message may be and whatever the format 
in which it is presented. Although the traditional kind of presentation is a live speech 
presented at a podium, advances in technology have made it possible to give several other 
kinds of presentations, and PowerPoint has kept pace nicely. The following list outlines the 
most common PowerPoint formats:
 
■Podium. For live presentations, PowerPoint helps the lecturer emphasize key points 
through the use of computer-based shows (from a notebook or tablet PC, for exam-
ple) or overhead transparencies.
 
■Kiosk shows. These are self-running presentations that provide information in an 
unattended location. You have probably seen such presentations listing meeting 
times and rooms in hotel lobbies and as sales presentations at trade show booths.
 
■CDs and DVDs. You can package a PowerPoint presentation on a CD or DVD and 
distribute it with a press release, a marketing push, or a direct mail campaign. The 
presentation can be in PowerPoint format, or it can be converted to some other for-
mat, such as PDF or a video clip. 
 
■Internet formats. You can use PowerPoint to create a show that you can present 
live over a network or the Internet, while each participant watches from their own 
computer. You can even store a self-running or interactive presentation on a web-
site in a variety of formats and make it available for the public to download and 
run on a PC.
When you start your ﬁ rst PowerPoint presentation, you may not be sure which deliv-
ery method you will use. However, it’s best to decide the presentation format before you 
invest too much work in your materials because the audience’s needs are different for each 
medium.
 
Need help structuring a presentation or planning for its delivery? See Appendix A, “What Makes a 
Great Presentation?”
Most people associate PowerPoint with sales presentations, but PowerPoint is useful for 
people in many other lines of work as well. The following sections present a sampling of 
how real people just like you are using PowerPoint in their daily jobs.
Sales
More people use PowerPoint for selling goods and services than for any other reason. Armed 
with a laptop computer and a PowerPoint presentation, a salesperson can make a good 
impression on a client anywhere in the world. Figure 1.1 shows a slide from a sample sales 
presentation.

5
Chapter 1: A First Look at PowerPoint

FIGURE 1.1
PowerPoint offers unparalleled fl exibility for presenting information to potential customers.
These are just some of the sales tools you can create with PowerPoint: 
 
■Live presentations in front of clients with the salesperson present and running the 
show. This is the traditional kind of sales pitch that most people are familiar with.
 
■Self-running presentations that ﬂ ip through the slides at speciﬁ ed intervals so that 
passersby can read them or ignore them as they wish. These types of presentations 
are great for grabbing people’s attention at trade show booths.
 
■User-interactive product information demos distributed on CD/DVD that potential 
customers can view at their leisure on their own PCs. This method is very inexpen-
sive because you can create a single presentation and distribute it by mail to mul-
tiple customers.
 
 See Chapter 19, “Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations,” to learn about controlling 
a live presentation. You create a self-running or user-interactive presentation in Chapter 20, “Preparing 
a Presentation for Mass Distribution.”
Marketing
The distinction between sales and marketing can be rather blurred at times, but marketing 
generally refers to the positioning of a product in the media rather than its presentation 

6
Part I: Building Your Presentation
to a particular company or individual. Marketing representatives are often called upon to 
write advertising copy, generate camera-ready layouts for print advertisements, design 
marketing ﬂ yers and shelf displays, and produce other creative selling materials.
PowerPoint is not a drawing program per se, and it can’t substitute for one except in a crude 
way. However, by combining the Ofﬁ ce 2013 clip art collection and drawing tools with 
some well-chosen fonts and borders, a marketing person can come up with some very usable 
designs in PowerPoint. Figure 1.2 shows an example. You learn about clip art in Chapter 11, 
“Working with Clip Art and Photos.” You can also integrate video clips in PowerPoint presen-
tations that can tell the story of your product; see Chapter 15 for more information. 
FIGURE 1.2
PowerPoint can generate camera-ready marketing materials, although it can’t substitute for 
the tools that professional advertising companies use.
Human Resources
Human resources personnel often ﬁ nd themselves giving presentations to new employees to 
explain the policies and beneﬁ ts of the company. A well-designed, attractive presentation 
gives the new folks a positive impression of the company they have signed up with, start-
ing them off on the right foot.

7
Chapter 1: A First Look at PowerPoint

One of the most helpful features in PowerPoint for the human resources professional is 
the SmartArt tool. With it, you can easily diagram the structure of the company and 
make changes whenever necessary with a few mouse clicks. Figure 1.3 shows an organiza-
tion chart on a PowerPoint slide. You can also create a variety of other diagram types. 
Organization charts and other SmartArt diagrams are covered in Chapter 10, “Creating 
SmartArt Diagrams.” 
FIGURE 1.3
Microsoft’s SmartArt feature lets you easily create organizational diagrams from within 
PowerPoint.
Education and Training
Most training courses include a lecture section in which the instructor outlines the general 
procedures and policies. This part of the training is usually followed up with individual, 
hands-on instruction. PowerPoint can’t help much with the latter, but it can help make the 
lecture portion of the class go smoothly.
If you have access to a scanner, you can scan in diagrams and drawings of the objects you 
are teaching the students to use. You can also use computer-generated images, such as 
screen captures and video clips, to teach people about software.

8
Part I: Building Your Presentation
PowerPoint’s interactive controls even let you create quizzes that each student can take 
on-screen to gauge their progress. Depending on the button the student clicks, you can set 
up the quiz to display a “Yes, you are correct!“ or “Sorry, try again“ slide. See Figure 1.4. 
For details about this procedure, see Chapter 19 and Lab 4 in the Project Labs section at the 
end of the book. 
FIGURE 1.4
Test the student’s knowledge with a user-interactive quiz in PowerPoint.
Hotel and Restaurant Management
Service organizations such as hotels and restaurants often need to inform their customers 
of various facts but need to do so unobtrusively so that the information will not be obvious 
except to those looking for it. For example, a convention center hotel might provide a list 
of the meetings taking place in its meeting rooms, or a restaurant might show pictures of 
the day’s specials on a video screen in the waiting area.
In such unattended situations, a self-running (kiosk) presentation works best. Typically 
the computer box and keyboard are hidden from passersby, and the monitor displays the 
information.
 
You learn more about kiosk setups in Chapter 19.

Clubs and Organizations
Many nonproﬁ t clubs and organizations, such as churches and youth centers, operate much 
the same way as for-proﬁ t businesses and need sales, marketing, and informational materi-
als. But clubs and organizations often have special needs too, such as the need to recognize 
volunteers for a job well done. Microsoft provides a certiﬁ cate template for PowerPoint 
that’s ideal for this purpose. Figure 1.5 shows a certiﬁ cate generated in PowerPoint. 
Another popular use for PowerPoint is to project the lyrics of a song on a big screen for 
sing-alongs at churches and meetings.
FIGURE 1.5
With PowerPoint, you can easily create certifi cates and awards.
What’s New in PowerPoint 2013?
PowerPoint 2013 is very much like PowerPoint 2010 in its basic functionality. It uses a 
tabbed Ribbon across the top, rather than a traditional menu system, and employs dialog 
boxes and a Quick Access Toolbar in the same ways that 2010 did. 
This doesn’t mean that there aren’t changes and improvements though! The following sec-
tions outline the major differences you will see when you upgrade from PowerPoint 2010 to 
PowerPoint 2013.

10
Part I: Building Your Presentation
Cloud Integration
You can purchase Ofﬁ ce 2013 (or the standalone PowerPoint 2013) either as a traditional 
boxed application or as a cloud-based subscription called Ofﬁ ce 365. There are several ben-
eﬁ ts to the cloud version, including lower price, automatic updates, the ability to use Ofﬁ ce 
on multiple PCs without paying extra (with some editions), and the ability to access your 
Ofﬁ ce applications and ﬁ les from multiple locations. The cloud-based version is marked 
primarily to businesses, but versions are also available for university students and home 
users too. See http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/small-business-
home.aspx for more information.
Start Screen
In earlier PowerPoint versions, you started up in a blank new presentation, which some 
beginners found intimidating. PowerPoint 2013 opens with a Start screen (Figure 1.6), pro-
viding easy access to both local and online templates as well as recently used ﬁ les. 
FIGURE 1.6
PowerPoint 2013 opens with a Start screen that offers links to templates and recent fi les.

11
Chapter 1: A First Look at PowerPoint

Improved Shape Merging
If you have ever tried to create anything with the drawing tools in an Ofﬁ ce app, you know 
that it can be frustrating because the shapes provided don’t always match the shapes you 
want. Ofﬁ ce 2013’s drawing tools contain several new commands and capabilities that make 
the process of creating just the right shapes much easier. You can ﬁ nd the Merge Shapes 
button on the Insert Shapes section of the Drawing Tools Format tab when two or more 
shapes are selected. Clicking Merge Shapes opens a menu of merge types. 
These new commands are all focused around merging two or more shapes into a single 
shape, using actions like Union, Combine, Intersect, Fragment, and Subtract. For example, 
suppose you want a shape that consists of a rounded rectangle with two arrows emerging 
from it. You could start with the three separate shapes shown at the left in Figure 1.7 and 
then use the Union command to join them into a single shape, as shown on the right.  
FIGURE 1.7
Drawn shapes, before and after merging.
You will learn a lot more about these in Chapter 9, “Drawing and Formatting Objects.”
Improved Smart Guides
PowerPoint 2013 makes it easier than ever to precisely align and evenly space objects with 
one another. When you drag an object to position it, dotted guidelines called Smart Guides 
appear, showing its relationship to other objects on the slide and allowing you to eas-
ily snap the object into precise alignment and spacing. Earlier versions of PowerPoint had 
alignment commands, but you had to speciﬁ cally issue them; Smart Guides present them-
selves automatically whenever they might be needed. Figure 1.8 shows an example. Smart 
Guides are covered in Chapter 9.
You can also create permanent drawing guides on the slide masters, making it easier to 
position content on slide masters and layout masters. Chapter 4, “Working with Layouts, 
Themes, and Masters,” covers modifying slide masters. 

12
Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 1.8
Alignment guides make it easier to align objects on slides.
Improved Comments 
PowerPoint has included a Comments feature in the past, but it hasn’t been very robust. In 
PowerPoint 2013, there is a Comments pane that you can use in Normal view to display and 
manage comments. See Figure 1.9.
FIGURE 1.9
The Comments pane helps you display and respond to comments.

Chapter 1: A First Look at PowerPoint

SkyDrive Integration
SkyDrive is Microsoft’s online ﬁ le storage service. Each user gets a certain amount of free 
space there (usually 2GB), and you can purchase additional space. 
In Ofﬁ ce 2013 apps, the logged-in user’s SkyDrive is the default save location, making 
it as easy to save ﬁ les to your SkyDrive as it is to save to any local folder on your hard 
disk. Files saved to SkyDrive are private and secure, and you can access them from any 
Internet-connected computing device, no matter where you are. For more information about 
SkyDrive, see Appendix B. 
Online Pictures and Videos
PowerPoint 2013, like other Ofﬁ ce 2013 applications, includes integration with online pic-
ture and video sharing services such as YouTube and Flickr, enabling you to easily access 
your own and other people’s online content for use in your presentations. 
Microsoft’s clip art collection is now accessed entirely online from Ofﬁ ce.com. You can also 
easily import pictures from your own SkyDrive and from a Bing image search. To help you 
avoid copyright problems, by default the Bing image search returns only results that are 
free to use under Creative Commons (a public user license).
For videos, you can embed video code from any website that provides it. (PowerPoint 2010 
also allowed this.) But what’s new now is that you can search for videos with Bing video 
search and select and embed clips directly from YouTube. See Figure 1.10.
FIGURE 1.10
You can insert or embed video content from online sources.

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Improved Presenter Tools
PowerPoint 2013 improves on-screen presentation capabilities in several ways. First, the 
tools available to you in Slide Show view are now more robust, including the ability to 
zoom in on a particular area of a slide and to select a slide to jump to from an array of 
thumbnail images. 
Presenter view can now be viewed on one monitor, allowing you to rehearse without con-
necting anything else. Presenter view has also been been enhanced, with extra display set-
tings and easier-to-use slide controls. See Figure 1.11.
FIGURE 1.11
Presenter view is now easier to use.
…And Other New Features
Besides the features I’ve just outlined, there are plenty more nice surprises awaiting 
upgraders:
 
■Theme variants. For many years now, PowerPoint users have complained that the 
templates PowerPoint provides are not customizable enough. For example, what if 
a certain template has a perfect background graphic but the colors are all wrong? 
PowerPoint 2013 solves this by providing color variants for many of the built-in 
themes. 

15
Chapter 1: A First Look at PowerPoint
1
 
■Touch controls. All of the Ofﬁ ce 2013 apps, including PowerPoint, are more easily 
controlled with touch screens than their predecessors. You can use PowerPoint 2013 
in the traditional way, with a mouse, or by pointing, tapping, swiping, and drag-
ging on a touch screen. 
 
■Eyedropper tool. Some graphics programs enable you to use an Eyedropper tool 
to pick up a color from one object and copy that color to another object. Now you 
can do that in Ofﬁ ce applications too. For example, you could pick up a color from 
a photograph on a slide and apply it to the text on the slide so that everything 
matches. This is great for matching colors for themes. You’ll ﬁ nd the Eyedropper 
tool on the Shape Fill and Shape Outline buttons’ menus on the Drawing Tools 
Format tab when working with shapes. 
 
■MP4 support. PowerPoint 2010 was revolutionary in that it allowed users to create 
their own video versions of their presentations. However, only one video format 
was supported: AVI. PowerPoint 2013 adds MP4 support, making the resulting vid-
eos much more widely shareable because MP4 is one of the most common video for-
mats for online use.
 
■Welcome Back. When you reopen a presentation that you were previously working 
on, the last slide you were editing automatically reappears. 
Learning Your Way around PowerPoint
Now that you have seen some of the potential uses for PowerPoint and toured the new fea-
tures, let’s get started using the program.
PowerPoint is one of the easiest and most powerful presentation programs available. You 
can knock out a passable presentation in a shockingly short time by skimming through the 
chapters in Part I and Part II of the book, or you can spend some time with PowerPoint’s 
advanced features to make a complex presentation that looks, reads, and works exactly the 
way you want.
Starting and Exiting PowerPoint
You can start PowerPoint just as you would any other program in Windows: from the Start 
screen (in Windows 8) or the Start menu (in Windows 7). Ofﬁ ce 2013 runs only under those 
two operating systems.
In Windows 8:
 
1.  Press the Windows key,      , on the keyboard to display the Start screen, or on a 
touch screen, swipe in from the right and tap Start. The Start screen appears.
 
2. Scroll to the right if needed to find the PowerPoint 2013 tile, and click or tap 
it. The program starts. 

16
Part I: Building Your Presentation
In Windows 7:
 
1. Click the Start button. The Start menu opens.
 
2. Click All Programs.
 
3. Click Microsoft Office.
 
4. Click Microsoft PowerPoint 2013. The program starts.
When PowerPoint 2013 opens, a Start screen appears, as you saw back in Figure 1.6, offering 
help for opening existing ﬁ les or starting new ones. If you want to bypass the Start screen 
and jump immediately to a new blank presentation (as in earlier versions of PowerPoint), 
just press the Esc key.
If you want quick access to PowerPoint from the Windows 8 Desktop, add a shortcut to PowerPoint to the taskbar. To 
do so, right-click the PowerPoint 2013 tile on the Start screen and click Pin to Taskbar. From then on, you can start 
PowerPoint by clicking the PowerPoint 2013 icon on the left end of the taskbar.
When you are ready to leave PowerPoint, click the Close (X) button in the top-right corner 
of the PowerPoint window. If you have any unsaved work, PowerPoint asks if you want to 
save your changes. Because you have just been playing around in this chapter, you prob-
ably do not have anything to save yet. (If you do have something to save, see Chapter 2, 
“Creating and Saving Presentation Files,” to learn more about saving.) Click No to decline to 
save your changes, and you’re outta there.
Understanding the Screen Elements
PowerPoint’s interface is typical of any Windows desktop program in many ways, but it has 
some special Ofﬁ ce-speciﬁ c features as well. The PowerPoint window contains these ele-
ments, as shown in Figure 1.12:
 
■Title bar. Identiﬁ es the program running (PowerPoint) and the name of the active 
presentation. If the window is not maximized, you can move the window by drag-
ging the title bar.
 
■Ribbon. Functions as a combination of menu bar and toolbar, offering tabbed 
“pages“ of buttons, lists, and commands. The next section describes it in more 
detail.
 
■File tab. Opens the File menu (Backstage view), from which you can open, save, 
print, and start new presentations.
 
■Quick Access Toolbar. Contains shortcuts for some of the most common commands. 
You can add your own favorites here as well.
 
■Minimize button. Shrinks the application window to a bar on the Windows task-
bar; you click its button on the taskbar to reopen it.

17
Chapter 1: A First Look at PowerPoint

■Maximize/Restore button. If the window is maximized (full screen), it changes to 
windowed (not full screen). If the window is not maximized, clicking here maxi-
mizes it.
 
■Close button. Closes PowerPoint. You may be prompted to save your changes, if you 
made any.
 
■Work area. Where active PowerPoint slide(s) appear. Figure 1.10 shows it in Normal 
view, but other views are available that make the work area appear differently.
 
See the section “Changing the View“ later in this chapter for details.
 
■Status bar. Reports information about the presentation and provides shortcuts for 
changing the view and the zoom and accessing the Notes and Comments panes.

Because this isn’t a Windows book, Windows controls are not covered in detail here. However, if you’re interested in 
learning more about Windows-based programs in general, pick up my book Windows 8 eLearning Kit For Dummies 
(Wiley, 2013). A Windows 7 version is also available. 
Working with the Ribbon
PowerPoint 2013’s user interface is based on the Ribbon, which is a bar across the top of the 
window that contains tabbed pages of commands and buttons. Rather than opening a menu 
and selecting a command, you click a tab and then click a button or open a list on that tab.
Here are some important terms you need to know when working with tabs:
 
■Ribbon. The whole bar, including all of the tabs.
 
■File tab. A rectangular orange button that opens Backstage view (also called the 
File menu), from which you can choose to start a new presentation and save, print, 
and perform other ﬁ le-related activities. See Figure 1.12 for this button’s location.
 
■Quick Access Toolbar. A small toolbar adjacent to the Ofﬁ ce button from which you 
can select commonly used commands.
To add a command to the Quick Access Toolbar, right-click the icon for it and choose Add to Quick Access Toolbar. To 
remove the command from there, right-click its icon and choose Remove from Quick Access Toolbar.
 
■Tab. A tabbed page of the Ribbon. Figure 1.13 shows the Home tab, for example.
FIGURE 1.13
The Ribbon is PowerPoint 2013’s primary user interface.

■Contextual tab. A tab that appears only when certain content is selected, such as 
a graphic or a chart. The context name appears above the tab name. In Figure 1.13, 
Drawing Tools is the context name for the Format tab.
 
■Group. A section of a tab. The Home tab shown in Figure 1.13 has the following 
groups: Clipboard, Slides, Font, Paragraph, Drawing, and Editing.
 
■Dialog box launcher. A small icon that is in the bottom-right corner of a group and 
from which you can open a dialog box related to that group.
To fi nd out what a toolbar button does, point the mouse at it. A ScreenTip pops up explaining it.
Working with Collapsible Tab Groups
Within a tab, groups can expand or collapse depending on the width of the PowerPoint 
window. When the window is large enough, everything within each group is fully expanded 
so that each item has its own button. When the window is smaller, groups start collapsing 
so that all groups remain visible. At ﬁ rst, large buttons get smaller and stack vertically; if 
that’s not enough, then groups collapse into single large buttons with drop-down lists from 
which you can select the individual commands. Figure 1.14 shows the same tab in three 
different widths for comparison.
FIGURE 1.14
The size of the PowerPoint window determines how much the groups are collapsed or 
expanded on the Ribbon.

20
Part I: Building Your Presentation
Because the Ribbon collapses, the exact steps for performing certain procedures depend on the active PowerPoint 
window’s width. A small window may require an extra step of opening a button’s menu to select a command, for 
example. For a large window, each command appears directly on the tab. This book assumes a PowerPoint app win-
dow size of 1024 x 768 pixels; if you run PowerPoint at a smaller resolution, you may occasionally have an extra step 
to access a command.
Working with Backstage View
When you open Backstage view by clicking the File tab, a multilayered menu system 
appears. Many of the commands along the left side of the screen are categories that open 
submenus when you click them. For example, in Figure 1.15, the Export command has been 
selected, revealing additional choices. 
FIGURE 1.15
Backstage view is a hierarchical menu system; fi rst select a category on the left, then a com-
mand in the middle, and then an option on the right.
The top-level categories and commands in Backstage View are as follows:
 
■Info. Displays information about the current presentation, including its properties. 
Commands are available for working with versions, permissions, and sharing.

21
Chapter 1: A First Look at PowerPoint

■New. Displays a list of templates available for starting a new presentation.
 
■Open. Displays the Open dialog box, from which you can select a ﬁ le to open.
 
■Save. Saves the current presentation.
 
■Save As. Saves the current presentation and prompts you for ﬁ lename and location 
information, even if the ﬁ le has been previously saved.
 
■Print. Provides access to printing options, including setting a print range, choos-
ing a printer, and specifying settings like color and collation.
 
■Share. Offers access to features for distributing the presentation via e-mail or 
fax, sharing it on your SkyDrive, presenting it online, or publishing slides to a 
SharePoint server.
 
■Export: Provides commands for creating PDF and XPS ﬁ les, creating videos, export-
ing handouts to Word, packaging a presentation for CD, and changing the ﬁ le type.
 
■Close. Closes the active presentation.
 
■Account. Enables you to see the user account information that you are logged in 
with and manage your connected services, such as your SkyDrive. You can also 
check for updates from here and view software version information. 
 
■Options. Opens a dialog box where you can customize the interface, also described 
in Chapter 22, “Customizing PowerPoint.” 
PowerPoint 2010 had an Exit command on the File menu, but PowerPoint 2013 does not. You can exit PowerPoint by 
clicking the Close (X) button in the upper-right corner of the app window.
Working with Dialog Boxes and Panes
PowerPoint sometimes uses dialog boxes to prompt you for more information. When you 
issue a command that can have many possible variations, a dialog box appears so you can 
specify the particulars.
Figure 1.16 illustrates some of the controls you may encounter in PowerPoint’s dialog boxes:
 
■Check box. These are individual on/off switches for particular features. Click to 
toggle them on or off.
 
■Increment buttons. Placed next to a text box, these buttons allow you to incre-
ment the number in the box up or down by one digit per click. For example, the 
Size text box has increment buttons in Figure 1.16.
 
■Drop-down list. Click the down arrow next to one of these to open the list, and 
then click your selection from the menu that appears. For example, the Latin text 
font setting has a drop-down list.

22
Part I: Building Your Presentation
 
■Command button. Click one of these big rectangular buttons to jump to a different 
dialog box. OK and Cancel are also command buttons; OK accepts your changes and 
Cancel rejects them.
 
■Tabs. Click a tab along the top of the dialog box to see a different page of options. 
In Figure 1.16, there are two tabs: Font and Character Spacing.
 
Dialog boxes that open or save fi les have some special controls and icons all their own, but you learn 
about those in more detail in Chapter 2, where you also learn to open and save your fi les.
FIGURE 1.16
The Font dialog box illustrates several types of controls.
Tab
Drop-down list
Increment buttons

Checkbox
Ofﬁ ce 2013 has moved away from using dialog boxes for some features; you may also 
encounter panes that ask for more information when you issue a command. A pane is a 
rectangular area along the left or right side of the screen, as shown in Figure 1.17. Notice 
that the Format Shape pane in Figure 1.17 has two tabs: Shape Options and Text Options. 
Click one or the other of those terms near the top of the pane to switch among the differ-
ent pages of options. Beneath the selected tab are several icons; each icon shows a different 
page of options as well. 
Some of the additional controls are shown in Figure 1.17:
 
■Option buttons. Option buttons are round, and operate in mutually exclusive groups. 
In Figure 1.17, under the Line heading, there are three Option buttons: No line, Solid 
line, and Gradient line. Option buttons are sometimes called radio buttons.
 
■Slider. A slider enables you to drag a bar to indicate a setting along a sliding scale. 
Transparency has a slider in Figure 1.17.

Changing the View
A view is a way of displaying your presentation on-screen. PowerPoint comes with several 
views because at different times during the creation process, it is helpful to look at the 
presentation in different ways. For example, when you add a graphic to a slide, you need 
to work closely with that slide, but when you rearrange the slide order, you need to see the 
presentation as a whole.
PowerPoint offers the following presentation views:
 
■Normal. A combination of several resizable panes so you can see the presentation 
in multiple ways at once. Normal is the default view.
 
■Outline. A variant of Normal view in which slide content appears as a text outline 
in the left pane rather than as graphical slide thumbnails. This view is available 
only from the View tab.
 
■Slide Sorter. A light-table-type overhead view of all the slides in your presenta-
tion, laid out in sections and rows, suitable for big-picture rearranging.
 
■Slide Show. The view you use to show the presentation on-screen. Each slide ﬁ lls 
the entire screen in its turn. This view is not available from the View tab, but it 

24
Part I: Building Your Presentation
is available in several other places, including in the status bar and in the Quick 
Access Toolbar.
 
■Reading. Similar to Slide Show view, except it’s windowed and the status bar 
remains in view. You can use Reading view to check your work as if you were show-
ing the slide show but still retain access to certain commands.
 
■Notes Page. A view with the slide at the top of the page and a text box below it for 
typed notes. (You can print these notes pages to use during your speech.) This view 
is available only from the View tab.
 
 This chapter covers only the presentation views (that is, regular views in which you can see the individ-
ual content of each slide). The master views are discussed in Chapter 4; master views enable you to 
make global changes to many slides at once.
There are two ways to change a view: Click a button on the View tab, or click one of the 
view buttons at the right end of the status bar at the bottom of the screen, shown in 
Figure 1.18. Not every view is available in both places.

When you save, close, and reopen a fi le, PowerPoint opens it in the view in which you left the fi le. To have the fi les 
always open in a particular view, choose File ➪ Options ➪ Advanced, and in the Display section, click the drop-down 
arrow on the Open All Documents Using This View list and select the desired view. The options on this list include 
some custom versions of Normal view that have certain panes turned off. For example, you can open all documents in 
Normal – Slide Only to always start in Normal view with just the main editing pane open.
Normal and Outline Views
Normal view, shown in Figure 1.19, is a very ﬂ exible view that contains a little bit of every-
thing. In the center is the Slide pane, where the active slide appears, and to its left is the 
Thumbnails pane, containing a set of thumbnail images that represent the presentation’s 
slides. 
FIGURE 1.19
Normal view, the default, shows slide thumbnails at the left and an editing window 
at the right.

Outline view (shown in Figure 1.20) is identical to Normal view except instead of the slide 
thumbnails on the left, you see a text outline.
FIGURE 1.20
Outline view shows a text outline at the left and an editing window at the right.

An optional Notes pane is available at the bottom of the window in Normal or Outline view; 
click Notes on the status bar to display or hide it. An optional Comments pane appears and 
disappears on the right when you click Comments on the status bar. (Normal view only, as 
shown in Figure 1.19). 
Each of the panes in Normal view has its own scroll bar, so you can move in it indepen-
dently of the other panes. You can resize the panes by dragging the dividers between 
the panes. For example, to give the notes area more room, point the mouse pointer at the 
divider line between it and the slide area so that the mouse pointer becomes a double-
headed arrow, and then hold down the left mouse button as you drag the line up to a new 
spot. To get the Thumbnails (or Outline) pane out of the way, drag the divider between it 
and the slide editing pane as far as possible to the left. 

27
Chapter 1: A First Look at PowerPoint
1
The left pane is useful because it lets you jump quickly to a speciﬁ c slide by clicking its 
thumbnail (Normal view) or some of its text content (Outline view). 
Slide Sorter View
If you have ever worked with hard copies of slides, such as 35mm slides, you know that 
it can be helpful to lay the slides out on a big table and plan the order in which to show 
them. You rearrange them, moving this one here, that one there, until the order is perfect. 
You might even start a pile of backups that you will not show in the main presentation but 
will hold back in case someone asks a pertinent question. That’s exactly what you can do 
with Slide Sorter view, as shown in Figure 1.21. It lays out the slides in miniature, so you 
can see the big picture. You can drag the slides around and place them in the perfect order. 
You can also return to Normal view to work on a slide by double-clicking the slide.
FIGURE 1.21
Use the Slide Sorter view for a bird’s-eye view of the presentation.
Slide Show View and Reading Views
When it’s time to rehearse the presentation, nothing shows you the ﬁ nished product quite as 
clearly as Slide Show view does. In Slide Show view, the slide ﬁ lls the entire screen, as shown 

28
Part I: Building Your Presentation
in Figure 1.22. You can move from slide to slide by pressing the Page Up and Page Down keys 
or by using one of the other movement methods available (covered in Chapter 19). 
The default slide dimensions in PowerPoint 2013 are set for a wide-screen monitor (16:9 
aspect ratio). If you are using a regular monitor (4:3) but showing wide-screen slides, black 
bars ﬁ ll in the extra space at the top and bottom. You can correct this problem by changing 
the slide size on the Design tab. When you change the slide size, PowerPoint prompts you 
to specify how to adjust the existing content to ﬁ t the new format. 
FIGURE 1.22
Slide Show view lets you practice the presentation in real life.
When you move your mouse in Slide Show view, buttons appear in the bottom-left corner 
for controlling the show without leaving it (These aren’t shown in Figure 1.22.). To leave 
the slide show, choose End Show from the menu or just press the Esc key.
When entering Slide Show view, the method you use determines which slide you start on. If you use the Slide 
Show View button in the bottom-right corner of the screen, the presentation will start with whatever slide you have 
selected. (You can also press Shift+F5 to do this or choose Slide Show  ➪  From Current Slide.) If you use the Slide 
Show  ➪  From Beginning command, or press F5, the presentation will start at the beginning.

29
Chapter 1: A First Look at PowerPoint

Reading view is like Slide Show view except it runs within the PowerPoint app window 
rather than full screen and it doesn’t have the powerful slide show tools that you get with 
Slide Show view (covered in Chapter 18), such as the ability to draw on a slide or skip to a 
certain slide. You still see the PowerPoint app’s title bar, and you still see the status bar at 
the bottom. You can move between slides by clicking with the mouse or by using the arrow 
keys on the keyboard. As with Slide Show view, you can exit from Reading view by pressing 
Esc to return to the previously accessed view. 
Notes Page View
When you give a presentation, your props usually include more than just your brain and 
your slides. You typically have all kinds of notes and backup material for each slide — ﬁ g-
ures on last quarter’s sales, sources to cite if someone questions your data, and so on. In 
the old days of framed overhead transparencies, people used to attach sticky notes to the 
slide frames for this purpose and hope that nobody asked any questions that required div-
ing into the four-inch-thick stack of statistics they brought.
Today, you can type your notes and supporting facts directly in PowerPoint. As you saw 
earlier, you can type them directly into the Notes pane below the slide in Normal or Outline 
view. Just click the Notes button in the status bar to display the Notes pane, and start typ-
ing away. However, if you have a lot of notes to type, you might ﬁ nd it easier to work with 
Notes Page view instead.
Notes Page view is accessible only from the View tab. In this view, you see a single slide 
(uneditable) with an editable text area below it called the notes placeholder, which you can 
use to type your notes. See Figure 1.23. You can refer to these notes as you give an on-
screen presentation, or you can print notes pages to stack neatly on the lectern next to 
you during the big event. If your notes pages run off the end of the page, PowerPoint even 
prints them as a separate page. If you have trouble seeing the text you’re typing, zoom in 
on it, as described in the next section.
Zooming In and Out
If you need a closer look at your presentation, you can zoom the view in or out to accom-
modate almost any situation. For example, if you have trouble placing a graphic exactly at 
the same vertical level as some text in a box next to it, you can zoom in for more precision. 
(The new Smart Guides feature in PowerPoint 2013 helps with that situation too.) You can 
view your work at various magniﬁ cations on-screen without changing the size of the sur-
rounding tools or the size of the print on the printout.
In Normal view, each of the panes has its own individual zoom. To set the zoom for the 
Thumbnails pane only, for example, select it ﬁ rst; then choose a zoom level. Or to zoom 
only in the Slide pane (the main editing pane), click it ﬁ rst. In a single-pane view such as 
Notes Page or Slide Sorter, a single zoom setting affects the entire work area.

30
Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 1.23
Notes Page view offers a special text area for your notes, separate from the slides.
The larger the zoom number, the larger the details on the display. A zoom of 10% would 
make a slide so tiny that you couldn’t read it. A zoom of 400% would make a few letters on 
a slide so big they would ﬁ ll the entire pane.
An easy way to set the zoom level is to drag the Zoom slider in the status bar, or click its 
plus or minus buttons to change the zoom level in increments, as shown in Figure 1.24. You 
can also hold down the Ctrl key and roll the scroll wheel on your mouse, if it has one.

To resize the current slide so that it is as large as possible while still ﬁ tting completely 
in the Slides pane, click the Fit Slide to Current Window button, or Choose View  ➪  Fit to 
Window.
Another way to control the zoom is with the Zoom dialog box. Choose View  ➪  Zoom to 
open it. (You can also open that dialog box by clicking the % next to the Zoom slider in the 
lower-right corner of the screen.) Make your selection, as shown in Figure 1.25, by click-
ing the appropriate button, and then click OK. Notice that you can type a precise zoom 
percentage in the Percent text box. You can specify any percentage you like, up to 400%. 
(Some panes and views will not go higher than 100%.)
FIGURE 1.25
You can zoom with this Zoom dialog box rather than the slider if you prefer.
Enabling Optional Display Elements
PowerPoint has a lot of optional screen elements that you may (or may not) ﬁ nd useful, 
depending on what you’re up to at the moment. The following sections describe them.
Ruler
Vertical and horizontal rulers around the Slide pane can help you place objects more pre-
cisely. To toggle them on or off, select or deselect the Ruler check box on the View tab, as 
shown in Figure 1.26. Rulers are available only in Normal, Outline, and Notes Page views.
The rulers help with positioning no matter what content type you are working with, but 
when you are editing text in a text frame they have an additional purpose. The horizontal 
ruler shows the frame’s paragraph indents and any custom tab stops, and you can drag the 
indent markers on the ruler just as you can in Word.

open the Region (or Region and Language) dialog box. On the Formats tab, click Additional Settings and choose U.S. 
or Metric from the Measurement System drop-down list.
The display of the vertical ruler is optional. To disable it while retaining the horizontal ruler, choose File  ➪  Options, 
click Advanced, and in the Display section, clear the Show Vertical Ruler check box.

Gridlines
Gridlines are nonprinting dotted lines at regularly spaced intervals that can help you line 
up objects on a slide. Figure 1.26 shows gridlines (and the ruler) enabled.
To turn gridlines on or off, use either of these methods:
 
■Press Shift+F9.
 
■On the View tab, in the Show group, select or deselect the Gridlines check box.
There are many options you can set for the gridlines, including whether objects snap to it, 
whether the grid is visible, and what the spacing should be between the gridlines. To set 
grid options, follow these steps:
 
1. On the View tab, click the dialog box launcher in the Show group. The Grid and 
Guides dialog box opens (see Figure 1.27). 
FIGURE 1.27
Set grid options and spacing.
 
2. In the Snap To section, select or deselect the Snap Objects to Grid check box. 
This setting speciﬁ es whether or not objects will automatically align with the grid.
 
3. In the Grid Settings section, enter the amount of space you want between 
gridlines.
 
4. Select or deselect the Display Grid On Screen check box to display or hide the 
grid. (Note that you can make objects snap to the grid without the grid being 
displayed.)
 
5. Click OK.
Guides
Guides are like gridlines except they are individual lines, rather than a grid of lines, and 
you can drag them to different positions on the slide. As you drag a guide, a numeric 

34
Part I: Building Your Presentation
indicator appears to let you know the ruler position, as shown in Figure 1.28. Use the Grid 
and Guides dialog box shown in Figure 1.27 to turn guides on/off, or press Alt+F9.
FIGURE 1.28
Guides are movable, nonprinting lines that help with alignment.
Horizontal guide
Vertical guide (being dragged)
You can create additional sets of guide lines by holding down the Ctrl key while dragging 
a guide (to copy it). You can have as many horizontal and vertical guides as you like, all at 
positions you specify. You can also save your custom guides (new in PowerPoint 2013). 
Ribbon
For a cleaner look to PowerPoint, as well as more screen space, you can choose to hide (or as 
Microsoft calls it, “un-pin”) the Ribbon when it’s not in use. To hide the Ribbon, click the 
Unpin the Ribbon icon (the up-pointing arrow button at the far right end of the Ribbon). 
From that point on, the Ribbon doesn’t appear unless you click one of its tabs. To get it 
back to always-on status, view the Ribbon (by clicking one of the tabs) and then click the 
Pin the Ribbon icon (which is a pushpin icon in the same spot that the Unpin the Ribbon 
arrow icon appeared in before).

Color/Grayscale/Pure Black and White Views
Most of the time you will work with your presentation in color. However, if you plan to 
print the presentation in black and white or grayscale (for example, on black-and-white 
handouts), you should check to see what it will look like without color.
This Color/Grayscale/Pure Black and White option is especially useful when you are preparing slides that will even-
tually be faxed because a fax is pure black and white in most cases. Something that looks great on a color screen 
could look like a shapeless blob on a black-and-white fax. It doesn’t hurt to check.
Click the Grayscale or the Pure Black and White button on the View tab to switch to one 
of those views. When you do so, a Grayscale or Black and White tab becomes available. The 
Grayscale tab is shown in Figure 1.29. From its Change Selected Object group, you can ﬁ ne-
tune the grayscale or black-and-white preview. Choose one that shows the object to best 
advantage; PowerPoint will remember that setting when printing or outputting the presen-
tation to a grayscale or black-and-white source.
FIGURE 1.29
Select a grayscale or a black-and-white preview type.
When you are ﬁ nished, click the Back to Color View button on the Grayscale or Black and 
White tab. Changing the Black and White or Grayscale settings doesn’t affect the colors on 
the slides; it only affects how the slides will look and print in black and white or grayscale.
Opening a New Display Window for the Same 
Presentation 
Have you ever wished you could be in two places at once? Well, in PowerPoint, you actually 
can. PowerPoint provides a way to view two spots in the presentation at the same time by 
opening a new window.
To display a new window, display the View tab and click New Window in the Window group. 
Then use Arrange All or Cascade to view both windows at once.

36
Part I: Building Your Presentation
You can use any view with any window, so you can have two slides in Normal view at once, 
or Slide Sorter and Notes Pages view, or any other combination. Both windows contain 
the same presentation, so any changes you make in one window are reﬂ ected in the other 
window.
Arranging Windows
When you have two or more windows open, whether they are for the same presentation or 
different ones, you need to arrange them for optimal viewing. You saw earlier in this chap-
ter how to resize a window, but did you know that PowerPoint can do some of the arranging 
for you?
When you want to arrange the open windows, do one of the following:
 
■Tile the windows. On the View tab, click Arrange All to tile the open windows so 
there is no overlap.
 
■Cascade the windows. On the View tab, click Cascade to arrange the open windows 
so that the title bars cascade from upper left to lower right on the screen. Click a 
title bar to activate a window.
These commands do not apply to minimized windows. If you want to include a window in 
the arrangement, make sure you restore it from its minimized state ﬁ rst.
Switching among Windows
If you have more than one window open and can see at least a corner of the window you 
want, click it to bring it to the front. If you have one of the windows maximized, on the 
other hand, or if another window is obscuring the one you want, click Switch Windows (on 
the View tab) and select the window you want to view.
Using the Help System
The PowerPoint help system is like a huge instruction book in electronic format. You can 
look up almost any PowerPoint task you can imagine and get step-by-step instructions for 
performing it.
To open the PowerPoint Help window, press F1, or click the Help icon (the question mark) in 
the upper-right corner of the PowerPoint window, as shown in Figure 1.30.
There are two ways to look up information in the help system:
 
■Click one of the topics on the default PowerPoint Help window shown in Figure 1.30, 
and then keep clicking subtopics to narrow down the search until you arrive at 
what you want.

37

■Type a keyword or phrase in the Search Help box, and then click the Search Help 
icon (the magnifying glass) or press Enter to ﬁ nd all help articles that contain it.
FIGURE 1.30

Help window
Much of the Offi ce 2013 help system relies on an Internet connection. By default, Offi ce 2013 applications automati-
cally connect to Microsoft’s servers online to gather additional help information. If you have a slow Internet connec-
tion and fi nd that searches are slow, try disabling online help so that PowerPoint uses just the help fi les installed on 
your PC. To do this, from the PowerPoint Help window, click the down arrow to the right of the PowerPoint Help head-
ing and from the menu that appears, choose PowerPoint Help from Your Computer. 
When you browse or search the help system, a list of articles matching the topic or search 
term appears. Click an article to read it. Figure 1.31 shows an article on saving ﬁ les, for 
example.

Summary
This chapter provided an introduction to PowerPoint. You learned about PowerPoint 2013’s 
new features, how to navigate the new user interface, how to control the view of the 
PowerPoint window, and how to get help and support. In the next chapter, you’ll learn how 
to create and save presentation ﬁ les. There are more options than you might think, so don’t 
be too quick to dismiss that topic as something you already know!

f you’re an experienced Windows and PowerPoint user, starting new presentations and saving 
ﬁ les may be second nature to you. If so — great! You may not need this chapter. On the other 
hand, if you aren’t entirely certain about some of the ﬁ ner points, such as saving in different 
formats or locations, stick around.
Even people who consider themselves “advanced” users may beneﬁ t from this chapter because it 
looks at some of the unique advanced saving features of Ofﬁ ce applications and explains how to 
secure ﬁ les with passwords.
Starting a New Presentation
You can start a blank presentation, or you can base the new presentation on a template or on 
another presentation. Using a template or existing presentation can save you some time. However, 
if you have a speciﬁ c vision you’re going for, starting a presentation from scratch gives you a clean 
canvas to work from.
Starting a Blank Presentation
When you open PowerPoint, a Start screen appears. From here you can click Blank Presentation, as 
shown in Figure 2.1, or you can just press Esc at the Start screen to access a blank presentation. 

42
Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 2.1
Use the Blank Presentation tile on PowerPoint’s Start screen to start a new presentation.
Click here for a

If you want to start a blank presentation at some time other than when you start up 
PowerPoint, you can do the following:
 
1. Choose File ➪ New. The same selection of templates and themes appears as in 
Figure 2.1.
 
2. Click Blank Presentation.
Press the Ctrl+N shortcut key to start a new blank presentation.
A new blank presentation begins automatically with one slide. Just add your content to it, 
add more slides if needed, change the formatting (as you’ll learn in upcoming chapters), 
and go for it.

Starting a Presentation from a Template
A template is a ﬁ le that contains starter settings — and sometimes starter content — on 
which you can base new presentations. Templates vary in their exact offerings but can 
include sample slides, a background graphic, custom color and font themes, and custom 
positioning for object placeholders.
The sample templates stored on your computer appear as tiles on the Start screen (Figure 2.1) 
and on the New screen when you choose File ➪ New, as in the preceding section. You can click 
whichever one you want to use.
Only a few sample templates are stored on your hard disk because Microsoft assumes that 
most people have an always-on Internet connection these days. When you are connected to 
the Internet, you can access the complete Microsoft library of template ﬁ les. Use the Search 
box to search for templates in a particular category or with certain keywords associated 
with them. 
Follow these steps to locate a template and use it to start a new presentation:
 
1. Choose File ➪ New.
 
2. In the Search box, type a keyword to search for and press Enter, or click one 
of the category links on the Suggested Searches line below the Search box. See 
Figure 2.2. A list of templates appears that match your criteria.
FIGURE 2.2
Search for templates by keyword or click a category.
Type a keyword here.
 
3. Click a template to see a preview of it, as shown in Figure 2.3.
 
4. Click Create. A new presentation is created based on that template.

Using a Personal Template
In the section, “Saving as a Template,” later in this chapter, you will learn how to save 
a presentation ﬁ le in template format so you can use it as a basis for new presentations. 
These are called personal templates in PowerPoint 2013.
For PowerPoint to fi nd your personal templates, you must tell it where they are stored. To do so, choose 
File ➪ Options, click the Save category, and then enter the path to that location in the Default Personal Templates 
Location text box. Then click OK.

45
Chapter 2: Creating and Saving Presentation Files

When you specify a default location for personal templates, the New screen has two catego-
ries below the suggested searches: Featured and Personal (or Custom). Personal appears if 
you have not speciﬁ ed a Workgroup Templates location (covered later in this chapter), and 
Custom appears instead of you have done so.
You can click Personal or Custom to see the locations that hold your own personal tem-
plates and themes. The Document Themes folder appears here (you’ll learn more about it 
in Chapter 4, “Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters”) and also whatever folder you 
speciﬁ ed as the default personal templates location (see the preceding note). In addition, if 
you have speciﬁ ed a Workgroup Templates location, that folder appears here too. 
To access your personal templates, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File ➪ New.
 
2. Click Personal or click Custom. An icon appears for the location you have deﬁ ned 
as your personal template folder as well as an icon for Document Themes. There may 
also be a Workgroup Templates folder shown. See Figure 2.4.
FIGURE 2.4
Choose Personal or Custom to see your personal template location.
Click Custom (or Personal,
depending on which appears)

46
Part I: Building Your Presentation
 
3. Click the icon for your personal template folder (My Templates). Thumbnails 
appear for your personal templates.
 
4.  Click the desired personal template. A new presentation opens based on that 
template.
Basing a New Presentation on Existing Content
If you already have a presentation that’s similar to the new one you need to create, you can 
base the new presentation on the existing one. To do so, open the existing presentation 
and then use Save As (covered in the next section, “Saving Your Work”) to save it under a 
new name.
PowerPoint can open ﬁ les in several formats other than its own, so you can start a new pre-
sentation based on some work you have done elsewhere. For example, you can open a Word 
outline in PowerPoint. The results might not be very attractive, but you can ﬁ x that later 
with some text editing, slide layouts, and design changes.
To open a ﬁ le from another application, do the following:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Open. The Open screen appears.
 
2. Click Computer.
 
3. Click Browse. The Open dialog box appears.
 
4. Click the File Type button (currently set to All PowerPoint Presentations) 
and choose the file type. For example, to open a text ﬁ le, choose All Outlines, as 
shown in Figure 2.5.
 
5. Navigate to the location containing the file you want to open.
 
6. Select the desired file, and then click Open.
 
7. Save your work as a PowerPoint file by choosing File ➪ Save As. 
See the next section for more information about saving.
Saving Your Work
PowerPoint is typical of most Windows programs in the way that it saves and opens ﬁ les. 
The entire PowerPoint presentation is saved in a single ﬁ le, and any graphics, charts, or 
other elements are incorporated into that single ﬁ le.
The ﬁ rst time you save a presentation, PowerPoint prompts you for a name and location. 
Thereafter, when you save that presentation, PowerPoint uses the same settings and does 
not prompt you for them again.

By changing the fi le type you can select a fi le of another supported type, such as a Word 
document.

Understanding Save Locations
Where can you save your ﬁ les? You can save ﬁ les in any location on your local hard disk, 
on a removable drive such as USB ﬂ ash drive, to a network location, to your SkyDrive, or to 
a SharePoint server, just to name a few places. A more pertinent question is, where should 
you save your ﬁ les? That depends on your situation. 
In most Ofﬁ ce 2013 apps, the default save location is your SkyDrive. Your SkyDrive is a free 
online storage location that Microsoft provides to anyone who wants it. (You don’t even 
have to be a Windows or Ofﬁ ce user.) Your SkyDrive is available no matter what computer 
you are logged into, as long as you have an Internet connection, so it’s a good choice for 
people who have multiple PCs that they alternate between. See Appendix B for more infor-
mation about SkyDrives.
If you use SkyDrive as your primary storage system for your data fi les, you might consider installing the SkyDrive for 
Windows desktop app. Go to https://apps.live.com/skydrive and click Download the App. This creates 
a local folder app from which you can manage and sync your SkyDrive content, and it places a shortcut to that folder 
in the Favorites list in the File Explorer navigation pane. You can learn more about this app in Appendix B.

48
Part I: Building Your Presentation
The main drawback to using your SkyDrive is that if your Internet connection isn’t avail-
able, neither are your ﬁ les. People with intermittent or inconsistent Internet service may 
want to store ﬁ les on the local hard drive, where they are always available. Saving to your 
Documents library is a safe bet, but you can also create your own folders on your hard drive 
and save there.
If you have a local network in your home or ofﬁ ce, you might have a central ﬁ le storage 
location on that network. For example, all the people in your department might save their 
ﬁ les to the same network share so that the ﬁ les are available to everyone at all times. Some 
companies maintain SharePoint servers for ﬁ le sharing; others just make network drives 
and folders available to all the users who need them.
If you want local portability, consider saving to a removable drive such as a USB ﬂ ash drive 
or an external hard drive. You can then plug the storage device into some other computer 
whenever you need ﬁ le transport, and you don’t have to worry about a network or Internet 
connection being available.
Saving for the First Time
If you haven’t previously saved the presentation you are working on, Save and Save As do 
the same thing: They open the Save As screen. From there, you can specify a name, ﬁ le 
type, and ﬁ le location. Follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Save. The Save As screen appears. Your SkyDrive is selected by 
default, as shown in Figure 2.6.
 
2. (Optional) If you want to save to your Documents library, click Computer. 
Each user has a Documents library, which is a composite location that represents multiple actual folders. If you 
save to the Documents library, the fi le is actually saved in the default storage location for the library, which is C:\
Users\username\My Documents where username is the Windows user name.
 
3. Click the Browse button. The Save As dialog box opens. 
 
 To save in a different location than your SkyDrive or computer, see the section “Changing Drives and 
Folders” later in this chapter. To save in a different format, see the section “Saving in a Different 
Format.”
 
4. In the File name box, type the name you want to use for the presentation, 
replacing the placeholder name that appears there. See Figure 2.7.
 
5. Click Save. The ﬁ le is saved. 
Filenames can be up to 255 characters. For practical purposes, however, keep the names 
short. You can include spaces in the ﬁ lenames and most symbols except <, >, ?, *, /, and 
\. However, if you plan to post the ﬁ le on a network or the Internet at some point, you 

49
Chapter 2: Creating and Saving Presentation Files
2
should avoid using spaces; use the underscore character instead to simulate a space, if nec-
essary. Filenames that include exclamation points also cause problems, so beware of that. 
Generally, it is best to avoid punctuation marks in ﬁ lenames.
If you want to transfer your presentation fi le to a different computer and show it from there, and that other computer 
does not have the same fonts as yours, you should embed the fonts in your presentation so that the desired fonts are 
available on the other PC. To embed fonts from the Save As dialog box, click the Tools button, choose Save Options, 
select Embed Fonts in the File check box, and click OK. This option makes the saved fi le larger than normal, so 
choose it only when necessary. For more information on advanced saving features, see the section “Specifying Save 
Options.”

Saving Subsequent Times
After you have saved a presentation once, you can resave it with the same settings (same 
ﬁ le type, name, and location) in any of the following ways:
 
■Choose File ➪ Save.
 
■Press Ctrl+S.
 
■Click the Save button on the Quick Access Toolbar.
If you need to save your presentation under a different name, as a different ﬁ le type, or in 
a different location, use the Save As command instead. This reopens the Save As screen, 
as in the preceding steps, so that you can save differently. The originally saved copy will 
remain under the original name, type, and location.
If you frequently use Save As, you may want to place a button for it on the Quick Access Toolbar. To do this, right-click 
the Save As command and choose Add to Quick Access Toolbar.

51
Chapter 2: Creating and Saving Presentation Files

Changing Drives and Folders
By default, all ﬁ les in PowerPoint (and all of the Ofﬁ ce applications) are saved to your 
SkyDrive. Each user has their own personal storage area in SkyDrive so that each person’s 
documents are kept separate. It’s a convenient save location for beginners because they 
never have to worry about changing the drive or folder. 
However, more advanced users will sometimes want to save ﬁ les to other locations. These 
other locations can include local hard disk locations (both the Documents library, as you 
saw in the previous section, and other folders), ﬂ ash drives, other hard disks in the same 
PC, hard disks on other PCs in a network, hard disks on web servers on the Internet, or 
writeable CDs.
The navigation pane on the left side of the Save As dialog box is home to several collaps-
ible/expandable categories. Double-click a category to open it and then make selections 
from within it (see Figure 2.8). You can choose from the following categories:
 
■Favorites. Shortcuts for popular locations such as Downloads and Desktop appear 
in the Favorites list, and you can also add your own shortcuts here.
Add your own favorite locations to the Favorites list by dragging their icons into it.
 
■Libraries. Libraries are virtual folders that organize locations by the types of ﬁ les 
they contain. Double-click Libraries and then click through a category such as 
Documents or Pictures.
 
■Homegroup. Windows 7 has a home networking feature called Homegroup; if you 
use it to set up your network, you can browse other network computers by clicking 
here. 
 
■Computer. Browse the complete drive and folder listing for your local PC here.
You can also navigate via the Address bar. The Address bar shows the path to the currently 
displayed location. You can jump directly to any of those levels by clicking the name there. 
You can also click the right-pointing arrow to the right of any level to see a menu of other 
folders within that location and jump to any of them from the menu, as shown in Figure 2.9.
Saving in a Different Format
All PowerPoint 2007, 2010, and 2013 ﬁ les save by default in an XML-based ﬁ le format called 
PowerPoint Presentation (*.pptx). eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a text-based cod-
ing system similar to HTML that describes formatting by using inline bracketed codes and 
style sheets. XML-based data ﬁ les are smaller than the data ﬁ les from earlier PowerPoint 
versions, and they support all of the latest PowerPoint features. For best results, use this 
format whenever you don’t have a reason to use some other format.

52
Part I: Building Your Presentation
There are also several variants of this format for specialty uses. For example, there’s a 
macro-enabled version with a .pptm ﬁ lename extension. There are also “show” variants 
(.ppsx and .ppsm) that open in Slide Show view by default and template variants (.potx 
and .potm) that function as templates.
Not everyone has PowerPoint 2007 or higher; you might sometimes need to share ﬁ les with 
people who have some earlier version of PowerPoint. Users of PowerPoint 2003 can down-
load a compatibility pack that will allow them to accept the new ﬁ les, but you can’t assume 
that everyone who has an earlier version of PowerPoint will download it. Therefore, you 
might need to save presentations in other ﬁ le formats to share ﬁ les with other people.

If you consistently want to save in a different format, choose File ➪ Options and click Save. Then, choose a dif-
ferent format from the Save Files in This Format drop-down list. This makes your choice the default in the Save as 
Type drop-down list in the Save As dialog box. Not all of the formats are available here; your choices are PowerPoint 
Presentation (the default), PowerPoint Macro-Enabled Presentation, PowerPoint Presentation 97–2003, Strict Open 
XML Presentation, and OpenDocument Presentation.
Table 2.1 lists a lot of choices, but don’t let that overwhelm you. You have three main deci-
sions to make:
 
■PowerPoint 2007–2013 format or backward compatible with PowerPoint 
97–2003. Unless compatibility is essential, go with the newer format because you 
get access to all of the new features. (See Table 2.2 to learn what you’ll lose with 
backward compatibility.) If you use a backward-compatible format, some of the fea-
tures described in this book work differently or aren’t available at all.
 
■Macro enabled or not. If you plan to create and store macros, use a macro-enabled 
format; if not, use a ﬁ le format that does not include macro support, for a slightly 
safer ﬁ le (because a ﬁ le cannot carry viruses if it can’t carry macro code).
 
■Regular presentation or PowerPoint Show. The “show” variant starts the presen-
tation in Slide Show view when it is loaded in PowerPoint; that’s the only differ-
ence between it and a regular presentation. You can build your presentation in a 
regular format and then save in show format right before distribution. PowerPoint 
shows can be opened and edited in PowerPoint the same as any other ﬁ le.
Most of the other choices from Table 2.1 are special-purpose formats and not suitable for 
everyday use. The following sections explain some of those special ﬁ le types.
Saving Slides as Graphics
If you save your presentation in one of the graphic formats shown in the Graphics/Other 
section of Table 2.1, the ﬁ le ceases to be a presentation and becomes a series of unre-
lated graphic ﬁ les, one per slide. If you choose one of these formats, you’re asked whether 
you want to export the current slide only or all slides. If you choose to export all slides, 
PowerPoint creates a new folder in the selected folder with the same name as the original 
presentation ﬁ le and places the graphics ﬁ les in it.
TABLE 2.1   (continued)

57

The Picture Presentation format does something unique: It converts each slide to an image and then places the 
images in a new presentation fi le. This is one way to make sure your slides are not edited by anyone who uses the 
presentation.

Saving Slide Text Only
If you want to export the text of the slides to some other application, consider the Outline/
RTF format, which creates an outline similar to what you see in the Outline pane in 
PowerPoint. This ﬁ le can then be opened in Word or any other application that supports 
Rich Text format (RTF) text ﬁ les. Only text in placeholders is exported, though, not text in 
manually inserted text boxes. If you aren’t sure which text will be included, view the pre-
sentation in the Outline pane; any text that doesn’t appear there will not be exported.

58
Part I: Building Your Presentation
Specifying Save Options
The save options enable you to ﬁ ne-tune the saving process for special needs. For example, 
you can employ save options to embed fonts, to change the interval at which PowerPoint 
saves AutoRecover information, and more.
There are two ways to access the Save options:
 
■Choose File ➪ Options and click Save.
 
■From the Save As dialog box, click Tools ➪ Save Options.
The PowerPoint Options dialog box appears (Figure 2.11). Set any of the options you want to 
set and click OK when you are ﬁ nished.
FIGURE 2.11
Set save options to match the way you want PowerPoint to save your work.
Table 2.3 summarizes the save options. One of the most important features described in 
Table 2.3 is AutoRecover, which is turned on by default. This means if a system error or 
a power outage causes PowerPoint to terminate unexpectedly, you do not lose all of your 

59
Chapter 2: Creating and Saving Presentation Files
2
work. The next time you start PowerPoint, it opens the recovered ﬁ le and asks if you want 
to save it.
AutoRecover is not a substitute for saving your work the regular way. It does not save in the same sense that the Save 
command does; it only saves a backup version as PowerPoint is running. If you quit PowerPoint normally, that backup 
version is erased. The backup version is available for recovery only if PowerPoint terminates abnormally (because of a 
system lockup or a power outage, for example).
TABLE 2.3  Save Options
Feature
Purpose
Save fi les in this format
Sets the default fi le format to appear in the Save As dialog box. 
Your choices are a regular presentation, a macro-enabled presen-
tation, or a 97–2003 backward-compatible presentation.
Save AutoRecover infor-
mation every _______ 
minutes
PowerPoint saves your work every few minutes so that if the 
computer has problems and causes PowerPoint to terminate 
abnormally, you do not lose much work. Lower this number to save 
more often (for less potential data loss) or raise it to save less often 
(for less slowdown/delay related to repeated saving).
AutoRecover fi le 
location
Specify the location in which AutoRecover drafts should be saved. 
By default, it is C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\
Microsoft\PowerPoint.
Don’t show the 
Backstage when open-
ing or saving fi les
When enabled, bypasses Backstage view (that is, the default File 
menu choices for opening and saving) and goes directly to the 
Open or Save dialog boxes, respectively. 
Always show “Sign in to 
SkyDrive” location 
during Save
When disabled, hides the SkyDrive sign-in option; disable this if 
you never use SkyDrive to save your work.
Save to Computer by 
default
When enabled, saves to your default local fi le location (see the 
next option) by default.
Default local fi le 
location
Specify the location that you want to start from when saving with 
the Save As dialog box. By default, it is your Documents library.
Default personal 
templates location
Specify the location containing any templates you have created or 
acquired separately from the ones PowerPoint itself provides.
Save checked-out 
fi les to
Sets the location in which any drafts will be saved that you have 
checked out of a web server library such as SharePoint. If you 
choose “The server drafts location on this computer,” then you 
must specify what that location will be in the Server drafts location 
box. If you choose to save to the Offi ce document cache, it’s not an 
issue because every save goes immediately back to the server.

Show detailed merge 
changes when a merge 
occurs
Shows full information about what was changed when you merge 
two PowerPoint fi les that are stored on a shared document man-
agement server.
Embed fonts in the fi le
Turn this on if you are saving a presentation for use on a different 
PC that might not have the fonts installed that the presentation 
requires. You can choose to embed the characters in use only 
(which minimizes the fi le size, but if someone tries to edit the pre-
sentation, they might not have all of the characters they need) or to 
embed all characters in the font set. Unlike the others, this setting 
applies only to the current presentation fi le. 
Setting Passwords for File Access
If a presentation contains sensitive or conﬁ dential data, you can encrypt the ﬁ le and pro-
tect it with a password. Encryption is a type of “scrambling” done to the ﬁ le so that nobody 
can see it, either from within PowerPoint or with any other type of ﬁ le-browsing utility.
You can enter two separate passwords for a ﬁ le: the Open password and the Modify pass-
word. Use an Open password to prevent unauthorized people from viewing the ﬁ le at all. 
Use a Modify password to prevent people from making changes to the ﬁ le.
You can use one, both, or neither of the password types. For example, suppose you have a 
personnel presentation that contains salary information. You might use an Open password 
and distribute that password to a few key people in the human resources department who 
need access to it. But then you might use a Modify password to ensure that none of those 
people make any changes to the presentation as they are viewing it.
For the Open password, you can specify an encryption method and strength. Many encryp-
tion codes are available, and the differences between them are signiﬁ cant mostly to high-
end technical users. However, if you do have a preference, you can choose it when you 
choose the Open password.
To manage a ﬁ le’s passwords and other security settings, follow these steps:
 
1. Begin to save the file as you normally would from the Save As dialog box.
 
2. In the Save As dialog box, click Tools, and choose General Options. The General

10. Continue saving as you normally would.
When you (or someone else) open the ﬁ le, a Password prompt appears. The Open password 
must be entered to open the presentation ﬁ le. The Modify password will not work. After 
that hurdle, if you have set a separate Modify password, a prompt for that appears. Your 
choices are to enter the Modify password, to cancel, or to click the Read-Only option to 
open the presentation in Read-Only mode.
Here’s a security hole to be aware of: If you add a Modify password and then save it as a .pptx fi le, it can be opened 
and edited in PowerPoint 2003 or earlier if you installed the compatibility pack that allows opening of .pptx fi les, 
even if the user does not know the password. However, if you save the fi le in PowerPoint 2013 as a PowerPoint 
97–2003 fi le (.ppt extension), it cannot be edited in earlier versions without the password.

Closing and Reopening Presentations
You can have several presentation ﬁ les open at once and switch freely between them, but 
this can bog down your computer’s performance somewhat. Unless you are doing some cut-
and-paste work, it’s best to have only one presentation ﬁ le open — the one you are actively 
working on. It’s easy to close and open presentations as needed.
Closing a Presentation
When you exit PowerPoint, the open presentation ﬁ le automatically closes and you’re 
prompted to save your changes if you have made any. If you want to close a presentation 
ﬁ le without exiting PowerPoint, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Close. 
If you have not made any changes to the presentation since the last time you 
saved, you’re done. If you have made any changes to the presentation, you’re 
prompted to save them.
 
2. If you don’t want to save your changes, click Don’t Save, and you’re done.
 
3. If you want to save your changes, click Save. If the presentation has already been 
saved once, you’re done. If the presentation has not been saved before, the Save As 
dialog box appears. 
 
4. Type a name in the File Name text box and click Save.
Opening a Presentation
To open a recently used presentation, choose File ➪ Open and click one of the presentations 
on the Recent Presentations list on the right. Up to 25 can appear by default (see Figure 2.13).
To pin a certain fi le to the File menu’s list so that it never scrolls off, click the pushpin icon to the right of the fi le’s 
name on the menu.
You can increase or decrease the number of recently used fi les that appear on the Recent Presentations list. Choose 
File ➪ Options, click Advanced, and in the Display section, set the Show This Number of Recent Presentations box. 
You can right-click an entry on the Recent Presentations list for additional options, such as Open a Copy, Copy Path 
to Clipboard, and Remove from List.

If the presentation you want to open does not appear on the Recent Presentations list, fol-
low these steps to ﬁ nd and open it:
 
1. If the Open screen does not already appear, choose File ➪ Open. 
 
2. Click the location from which you want to open a presentation, which may be 
your SkyDrive or computer (for locally stored files).
 
3. If a shortcut appears to the folder that contains the file you want, click it. 
Otherwise, click Browse to browse for the location. The Open dialog box appears.
 
4. Choose the file you want to open. If necessary, change the location to ﬁ nd the 
ﬁ le.

See the section “Changing Drives and Folders” earlier in this chapter if you need help.
 
5. Click Open. The presentation opens.
To open more than one presentation at once, hold down the Ctrl key as you click each ﬁ le 
you want to open. When you click the Open button, they all open in their own windows. 
For more information, see the sidebar “Working with Multiple Presentations” later in this 
chapter.
The Open button in the Open dialog box has its own drop-down list from which you can 
select commands that open the ﬁ le in different ways. See Figure 2.14, and refer to Table 2.4 
for an explanation of the available options.
FIGURE 2.14
The Open button’s menu contains several special options for opening a fi le.

Open
The default; simply opens the fi le for editing.
Open Read-Only
Allows changes but prevents those changes from being saved 
under the same name.
Open as Copy
Opens a copy of the fi le, leaving the original untouched.
Open in Browser
Applicable only for web-based presentations; opens it for 
viewing in a web browser. PowerPoint 2013 does not save in 
Web format, so it applies only to web-based presentations 
created in earlier versions of PowerPoint that supported that 
feature.
Open in Protected View
Opens the fi le in an uneditable view. This option not only pre-
vents you from saving any changes to the fi le, it also prevents 
you from making changes.
Open and Repair
Opens the fi le, and identifi es and repairs any errors it fi nds in it.
Show Previous Versions
Applicable only if the presentation fi le is stored on an NTFS 
volume under Windows 7, this feature enables you to access 
the Versions feature in Windows 7 that stores previous versions 
of fi les. It is not applicable to Windows 8, which does not store 
previous versions in the same way.
Opening a File from a Different Program
Just as you can save ﬁ les in various program formats, you can open ﬁ les from various pro-
grams. PowerPoint can detect the type of ﬁ le and convert it automatically as you open it, 
so you do not have to know the exact ﬁ le type. (For example, if you have an old PowerPoint 
ﬁ le with a .ppt ﬁ lename extension, you don’t have to know what version it came from.) 
The only problem is with ﬁ les that have ﬁ lename extensions that PowerPoint doesn’t auto-
matically recognize. In that case, you must change the File Type setting in the Open dialog 
box to All Files so that the ﬁ le to be opened becomes available on the ﬁ le list, as shown in 
Figure 2.15. The change is valid for only this one use of the Open dialog box; the ﬁ le type 
reverts to All PowerPoint Presentations, which is the default, the next time you open the 
dialog box. 
PowerPoint opens only presentation fi les and text-based fi les such as Word outlines. If you want to include graphics 
from another program in a PowerPoint presentation, insert them using the Picture command on the Insert tab. Do not 
attempt to open them with the Open dialog box.

Working with Multiple Presentations
You will usually work with only one presentation at a time. But occasionally you may need to have two 
or more presentations open at once — for example, to make it easier to copy text or slides from one 
presentation to another.
To open another presentation, choose File ➪ Open and select the one you want, the same as usual.
When more than one presentation is open, you can switch among them by selecting the one you want 
to see from the taskbar in Windows. Alternatively, you can click the Switch Windows button on the View 
tab and select any open presentation from there, as shown in the following screen shot.
Switch between open windows of all applications — not just PowerPoint — by pressing Alt+Esc 
repeatedly to cycle through them or by holding down the Alt key and pressing Tab to browse through 
thumbnails of open windows.

Finding a Presentation File to Open
If you have forgotten where you saved a particular presentation ﬁ le, you’re not out of luck. 
The Open dialog box includes a Search box that can help you locate it, as shown in Figure 
2.16.
FIGURE 2.16
Use the Search box in the Open dialog box to look for a fi le.
Type word(s) to search for here.

appear immediately.
To search for a ﬁ le, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Open, click the location in which to search (SkyDrive or 
Computer), and then click Browse to display the Open dialog box.
 
2. Navigate to the general location of the file. For example, if you know it is on the 
C: drive, display the top-level listing for the C: drive.
 
3. Click in the Search box and type part of the filename (if you know it) or a 
word or phrase used in the file.
 
4. Press Enter. A list of ﬁ les that match that speciﬁ cation appears.
 
5. Open the file as you normally would.

68
Part I: Building Your Presentation
Setting File Properties
File properties are facts about each ﬁ le that can help you organize them. If you have a 
lot of PowerPoint ﬁ les, using ﬁ le properties can help you search intelligently for them 
using the Search feature you learned about in the preceding section. For example, you can 
specify an author, a manager, and a company for each ﬁ le and then search based on those 
values.
You can set a ﬁ le’s properties by doing the following:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Info. 
 
2. Click the Properties heading (on the right side of the Info screen), and on the 
menu that appears, click Show Document Panel. A Properties Ribbon appears 
above the presentation window.
 
3. Fill in any information you want to store about the presentation, as shown in 
Figure 2.17.
FIGURE 2.17
Enter information to store in the fi le’s properties.
 
4. Click the down arrow to the right of Document Properties in the Properties 
Ribbon, and choose Advanced Properties. The Properties dialog box for the ﬁ le 
appears.
 
5. Click the Summary tab, and confirm or change any information there. This is 
the same information that you entered in the Properties Ribbon, with the addition 
of a couple of other ﬁ elds, as shown in Figure 2.18.
 
6. Click the Custom tab, shown in Figure 2.19, choose any additional fields you 
need, and set values for them. For example, click the Client ﬁ eld on the Name list, 
and type a value for it in the Value text box. Repeat this for any of the other cus-
tom ﬁ elds.

7. Review the information on the Statistics and Contents tab if desired. (You can’t 
change that information.)
 
8. Click OK.
Now you can use the contents of the properties ﬁ elds when performing a search.
Summary
This chapter made you a master of ﬁ les. You can now conﬁ dently create new presentations, 
and save, open, close, and delete PowerPoint presentation ﬁ les. You can also save ﬁ les in 
different formats, search for missing presentations, and lots more. This is rather utilitarian 
knowledge and not very much fun to practice, but later you will be glad you took the time 
to learn it, when you have important ﬁ les you need to keep safe.
In the next chapter, you learn about slide layouts and text-based presentations. You also 
learn how to create your own layouts, and how to create the text that will form the basis of 
your message.

Working with text boxes
P
owerPoint makes it easy to create consistent, attractive slides that use standard preset lay-
outs. You just choose the layout that you want for a particular slide and then ﬁ ll in its place-
holders with text, graphics, or other content.
In this chapter, you’ll learn how to build a simple text-based presentation by creating new slides 
and entering text on them. You’ll learn how to import content from other programs, and how to 
create, size, and position text boxes to hold the text for your presentation.
Creating New Slides
Different templates start a presentation with different numbers and types of slides. A blank presen-
tation has only a single slide, and you must create any others that you want.
There are several ways to create new slides. For example, you can type new text in the outline and 
then promote it to slide status, or you can add slides with the New Slide button that is on the Home 
tab. You can also copy existing slides, either within the same presentation or from other sources. 
The following sections outline these procedures in more detail.
Creating New Slides from Outline View
As discussed in Chapter 1Outline view shows the text from the presentation’s slides in a hierarchi-
cal tree, with the slide titles at the top level (the slide level) and the various levels of bulleted 

72
Part I: Building Your Presentation
lists on the slides displaying as subordinate levels. Text that you type in the Outline pane 
appears on the slide, and vice versa, as shown in Figure 3.1.
FIGURE 3.1
When you type text into the Outline pane, it automatically appears on the current slide.
Same text appears in the Outline
pane and on the slide
Outline view doesn’t show all of the text in all cases; see “Creating Text Boxes Manually” later in this chapter to fi nd 
out why text in some text boxes does not appear in the outline.
Follow these steps to create a new slide from Outline view:
 
1. Switch to Outline view (View ➪ Presentation Views ➪ Outline View). As you 
learned in Chapter 1, Outline view is like Normal view except the left pane is an 
Outline pane, containing a text outline instead of slide thumbnail images.
 
2. Click at the end of the existing line on the Outline pane that the new slide 
should follow.

73
Chapter 3: Creating Slides and Text Boxes
3
 
3. Click  Home ➪ Slides ➪ New Slide. A new line appears in the Outline pane, with a 
slide symbol to its left.
 
4. Type the title for the new slide. The title appears both in the Outline pane and on 
the slide.
You can also create a new slide by starting a new line in the Outline pane and then 
promoting it to slide level by pressing Shift+Tab. Follow these steps to insert a new slide in 
this way:
 
1. Position the insertion point at the end of the last line of the slide that the new 
slide should follow, and press Enter to start a new line.
 
2. Press Shift+Tab to promote the new line to the highest level (press it multiple 
times if needed), so that a slide icon appears to its left.
 
3. Type the title for the new slide. The title appears both in the Outline pane and on 
the slide.
After creating the slide, you can continue creating its content directly in the Outline pane. 
Press Enter to start a new line, and then use Tab to demote, or Shift+Tab to promote, the 
line to the desired level. You can also right-click the text and choose Promote or Demote. 
Promoting a line all the way to the top level changes the line to a new slide title.
Creating a Slide from the Slides Pane
Here’s a very quick method for creating a new slide, based on the default layout. It doesn’t 
get much easier than this:
 
1. Switch to Normal view if you’re not already there (View ➪ Presentation 
Views ➪ Normal). 
 
2. In the Slides pane, click the slide that the new slide should follow.
 
3. Press Enter. A new slide appears. You can also right-click the slide that the new 
one should follow and choose New Slide.
The drawback to creating a slide in any of the ways you have learned about so far in this 
chapter is that you cannot specify the layout. You have to change the layout afterwards 
if you don’t get the kind you want. To choose a layout other than the default one, see the 
next section.
The layout you get when you create a new slide from the Slides pane depends on what layout the preceding slide has. 
If the preceding slide is Title Slide or Title and Content, you get a Title and Content slide. With any other type, you get 
the same type as the previous one. For example, if the previous slide was Title Only, that’s what you get.

74
Part I: Building Your Presentation
Creating a Slide from a Layout
A slide layout is a layout guide that tells PowerPoint what placeholder boxes to use on a 
particular slide and where to position them. Although slide layouts can contain placehold-
ers for text, they also contain graphics, charts, tables, and other useful elements. After you 
create a new slide with placeholders, you can click a placeholder to open whatever controls 
you need to insert that type of object.
 
See the section, “Using Content Placeholders” for more information on inserting objects.
When you create new slides using one of the methods described in the preceding sections, 
the new slides use the Title and Content layout, which consists of a slide title and a single, 
large placeholder box for content. If you want to use another layout, such as a slide with 
two adjacent but separate frames of content, you must either switch the slide to a differ-
ent layout after its creation (using the Layout button’s menu on the Home tab), or you must 
specify a different layout when you initially create the slide.
To specify a certain layout as you are creating a slide, follow these steps:
 
1. In Normal or Slide Sorter view, select or display the slide that the new one 
should follow. 
You can select a slide by clicking its thumbnail image in Slide Sorter view or on 
the Slides pane in Normal view. You can also move the insertion point to the slide’s 
text in the Outline pane.
 
2. On the Home tab, do one of the following: 
 
■To add a new slide using the default Title and Content layout, click the top 
(graphical) portion of the New Slide button.
 
■To add a new slide using another layout, click the bottom (text) portion of the 
New Slide button and then select the desired layout from the menu, as shown in 
Figure 3.2.
The layouts that appear on the menu come from the slide master. To customize these layouts, click 
View ➪ MasterViews ➪ Slide Master. You will learn more about the slide master and about changing layouts in 
Chapter 4.
Copying Slides
Another way to create a new slide is to copy an existing one in the same presentation. This 
is especially useful when you are using multiple slides to create a progression because one 
slide is typically identical to the next slide in a sequence, except for a small change. (You 
can also build animation effects within a single slide using PowerPoint’s animation effects, 
as you will learn in Chapter 17.)

75
Chapter 3: Creating Slides and Text Boxes

FIGURE 3.2
Create a new slide, based on the layout of your choice.
There are several ways to copy one or more slides. One way is to use the Windows Clipboard, 
as in the following steps:
 
1. Select the slide or slides that you want to copy. See “Selecting Slides” later in 
this chapter for more information about selecting slides.
If you select from the Outline pane in Outline view, make sure that you click the icon to the left of the slide’s title so 
that the entire slide is selected; if you select only part of the text on the slide, then only the selected part is copied.
 
2. Press Ctrl+C. You can also click Home ➪ Clipboard ➪ Copy, or right-click the selec-
tion and click Copy.
 
3. Select the slide that the pasted slide or slides should follow. Or, if working in 
Outline view, click in the Outline pane to place the insertion point where you want 
the insertion.
 
4. Press Ctrl+V. You can also click Home ➪ Clipboard ➪ Paste, or right-click the desti-
nation and click Paste.

76
Part I: Building Your Presentation
PowerPoint also has a Duplicate Selected Slides command that does the same thing as a 
copy-and-paste command. Although it may be a little faster, it gives you less control as to 
where the pasted copies will appear. PowerPoint pastes the slides immediately after the 
last slide in the selection. For example, if you selected slides 1, 3, and 6 and issued the 
Duplicate Selected Slides command, then the copies are placed after slide 6.
Follow these steps to try out the Duplicate Selected Slides command.
 
1. Select the slide or slides to be duplicated.
 
2. On the Home tab, click the bottom part of the New Slide button to open its 
menu.
 
3. Click Duplicate Selected Slides. As an alternative, you can right-click a slide (or a 
group of selected slides) in the Slides pane and choose Duplicate Slide. 
To make duplication even faster, you can place the Duplicate Selected Slides command on the Quick Access toolbar. 
To do that, right-click the command on the menu and choose Add to Quick Access Toolbar.
Inserting Content from External Sources
Many people ﬁ nd that they can save a lot of time by copying text or slides from other 
programs or from other PowerPoint presentations to form the basis of a new presentation. 
There’s no need to reinvent the wheel each time! The following sections look at various 
ways to bring in content from external sources.
Copying Slides from Other Presentations
There are several ways to copy slides from other presentations. You can:
 
■Open the presentation, save it under a different name, and then delete the slides 
that you don’t want, leaving a new presentation with the desired slides ready for 
customization.
 
■Open two PowerPoint windows side-by-side and drag-and-drop slides between them.
 
■Open two PowerPoint presentations, copy slides from one of them to the Clipboard 
(Ctrl+C), and then paste them into the other presentation (Ctrl+V).
 
■Use the Reuse Slides feature in PowerPoint, as described next.
To reuse slides from other presentations with the Reuse Slides feature, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Home tab, click the lower portion of the New Slide button to open its 
menu.
 
2. Click Reuse Slides. The Reuse Slides pane appears at the right.

3. Click the Open a PowerPoint File hyperlink.Or, click the Browse button and then 
click Browse File.
 
4. In the Browse dialog box, select the presentation from which you want to copy 
slides, and click Open. Thumbnail images of the slides in the presentation appear 
in the Reuse Slides pane, as shown in Figure 3.3.
FIGURE 3.3
Choose individual slides to copy to the current presentation.
 
5. (Optional) If you want to keep the source formatting when copying slides, 
select the Keep source formatting check box at the bottom of the task pane.
 
6. (Optional) To see an enlarged image of one of the slides, move the mouse 
pointer over it.
 
7. Do any of the following: 
 
■To insert a single slide, click it.
 
■To insert all slides at once, right-click any slide and choose Insert All Slides.
 
■To copy only the theme (not the content), right-click any slide in the Reuse 
Slides pane and choose Apply Theme to All Slides, or Apply Theme to Selected 
Slides. 

78
Part I: Building Your Presentation
Inserting New Slides from an Outline
All of the Microsoft Ofﬁ ce applications work well together, so it’s easy to move content 
between them. For example, you can create an outline for a presentation in Microsoft Word 
and then import it into PowerPoint. PowerPoint uses the heading styles that you assigned 
in Word to decide which items are slide titles and which items are slide content. The top-
level headings (Heading 1) form the slide titles.
To try this out, open Word, switch to Outline view (View ➪ Views ➪ Outline), and then type 
a short outline of a presentation. Press Tab to demote, or Shift+Tab to promote, a selected 
line. Then save your work, go back to PowerPoint, and follow these steps to import it:
 
1. On the Home tab, click the lower portion of the New Slide button to open its 
menu.
 
2. Click Slides from Outline. The Insert Outline dialog box opens.
 
3. Select the file containing the outline text that you want to import.
 
4. Click Insert. PowerPoint imports the outline.
If there were already existing slides in the presentation, they remain untouched. (This 
includes any blank slides, and so you might need to delete the blank slide at the beginning 
of the presentation after importing.) All of the Heading 1 lines from the outline become 
separate slide titles, and all of the subordinate headings become bullet points in the slides.
Tips for Better Outline Importing
Although PowerPoint can import any text from any Word document, you may not always get 
the results that you want or expect. For example, you may have a document that consists 
of a series of paragraphs with no heading styles applied. When you import this document 
into PowerPoint, it might look something like Figure 3.4.
Figure 3.4 is a prime example of what happens if you don’t prepare a document before you 
import it into PowerPoint. PowerPoint makes each paragraph its own slide and puts all of 
the text for each one in the title placeholder. It can’t tell which ones are actual headings 
and which ones aren’t because there are no heading styles in use. The paragraphs are too 
long to ﬁ t on slides, and so they overrun their placeholders. Extra blank lines are inter-
preted as blank slides. Quite a train wreck, isn’t it? Figure 3.4 also illustrates an impor-
tant point to remember: Regular paragraph text does not work very well in PowerPoint. 
PowerPoint text is all about short, snappy bulleted lists and headings. The better that you 
prepare the outline before importing it, the less cleanup you will need to do after import-
ing. Here are some tips:
 
■Apply heading styles to the text that you want to import. Paragraphs formatted 
using non-heading styles in Word do not import into PowerPoint unless you use no 
heading styles at all in the document (as in Figure 3.4). 

79
Chapter 3: Creating Slides and Text Boxes
3
 
■Stick with basic styles only in the outline: for example, just Heading 1, Heading 2, 
and so on.
 
■Delete all blank lines above the ﬁ rst heading. If you don’t, you will have blank 
slides at the beginning of your presentation.
 
■Strip off as much manual formatting as possible from the Word text, so that the 
text picks up its formatting from PowerPoint. To strip off formatting in Word, 
select the text and press Ctrl+spacebar.
 
■Do not leave blank lines between paragraphs. These will translate into blank slides 
or blank bulleted items in PowerPoint.
 
■Delete any graphic elements, such as clip art, pictures, charts, and so on. They will 
not transfer to PowerPoint anyway and may confuse the import utility.

presentation.

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Importing from Other Text-Based Formats
In addition to Word, PowerPoint also imports from plain-text ﬁ les, from WordPerfect (5.x 
or 6.x), from Microsoft Works, from Rich Text Format, and from Web pages. The procedure 
is the same as in the preceding steps. By default, the ﬁ le type in the Insert Outline dialog 
box is set to All Files, so you should see all usable ﬁ les automatically, provided they have 
the correct extensions.
If you are setting up a plain-text ﬁ le for import, you obviously won’t have the outlining 
tools from Word at your disposal. Instead, you must rely on tabs. Each line that should be 
a title slide should start at the left margin; ﬁ rst-level bullet paragraphs should be preceded 
by a single tab; second-level bullets should be preceded by two tabs, and so on.
Post-Import Cleanup
After importing text from an outline, there will probably be a few minor corrections that 
you need to make. Run through this checklist:
 
■The ﬁ rst slide in the presentation might be blank. If it is, then delete it.
 
■The Title Slide layout may not be applied to the ﬁ rst slide; apply that layout, if nec-
essary. (You can use the Layout list on the Home tab.)
 
■A theme may not be applied; choose one from the Design tab, if necessary, or for-
mat your slide masters and layouts as desired.
 
See Chapter 4 for more information on working with themes.
 
■Some of the text might contain manual formatting that interferes with the theme 
formatting and creates inconsistency. Remove any manual formatting that you 
notice. One way to do this is to switch to Outline view, select all of the text in the 
Outline pane by pressing Ctrl+A, and then stripping off the manual formatting by 
pressing Ctrl+spacebar or by clicking the Reset button in the Slides group on the 
Home tab.
 
■If some of the text is too long to ﬁ t comfortably on a slide, change to a different 
slide layout, such as a two-column list, if necessary. You might also need to split 
the content into two or more slides.
 
■There might be some blank bullet points on some slides (if you missed deleting all 
of the extra paragraph breaks before importing). Delete these bullet points.
Opening a Word Document as a New Presentation
Instead of importing slides from a Word document or other text-based document, as 
described in the preceding section, you can simply open the Word document in PowerPoint. 
PowerPoint starts a new presentation ﬁ le to hold the imported text. This saves some time 
if you are starting a new presentation anyway, and you don’t have any existing slides to 
merge with the incoming content.

2. Select the location where the Word document is stored, such as your SkyDrive 
or Computer.
 
3. Click Browse, and then navigate to the folder containing the Word document.
 
4. Change the file type to All Outlines. 
 
5. Select the document.
 
6. Click Open. The document outline becomes a PowerPoint presentation, with all 
Heading 1 paragraphs becoming slide titles. 
You can’t open or insert a Word outline in PowerPoint if it is currently open in Word. This limitation is an issue only for 
Word fi les, not plain text or other formats.
Importing Text from Web Pages
PowerPoint accepts imported text from several Web-page formats, including HTML and 
MHTML (Single File Web Page). It is helpful if the data is in an orderly outline format, or if 
it was originally created from a PowerPoint ﬁ le, because there will be less cleanup needed.
There are several ways to import from a Web page:
 
■Open a Web-page ﬁ le as you would an outline (see the preceding section), but set 
the ﬁ le type to All Web Pages.
 
■Insert the text from the Web page as you would a Word outline (in the Home tab, 
click Slides ➪ New Slide ➪ Slides from Outline).
 
■Reuse slides from a Web presentation as you would from any other presentation (in 
the Home tab, click Slides ➪ New Slide ➪ Reuse Slides).
You should use one of the above methods rather than pasting HTML text directly into PowerPoint. This is because 
when you paste HTML text, you might get additional HTML tags that you don’t want, including cross-references that 
might cause your presentation to try to log onto a Web server every time you open it.
When importing from a Web page, don’t expect the content to appear formatted the same 
way that it was on the Web page. We’re talking strictly about text import here. The format-
ting on the Web page comes from HTML tags or from a style sheet, neither of which you can 
import. If you want an exact duplicate of the Web page’s appearance, take a picture of the 
page with the Shift+PrintScreen command, and then paste it into PowerPoint (Ctrl+V) as a 
graphic.

If you are importing an outline from an MHTML-format Web page that contains pictures, 
the pictures are also imported into PowerPoint. If importing from a regular HTML ﬁ le, you 
cannot import the pictures.

Managing Slides
After inserting a few slides into a presentation, and perhaps building some content on 
them, you might decide to make some changes, such as rearranging, deleting, and so on. 
The following sections explain how to manage and manipulate the slides in a presentation.
Selecting Slides
Before you can issue a command that acts upon a slide or a group of slides, you must select 
the slides that you want to affect. You can do this from either Normal or Slide Sorter view, 
but Slide Sorter view makes it easier because you can see more slides at once. From Slide 
Sorter view, or from the Slides pane in Normal view, you can use any of these techniques to 
select slides:
 
■To select a single slide, click it.
 
■To select multiple slides, hold down the Ctrl key as you click each one. Figure 3.5 
shows slides 1, 3, and 6 selected, as indicated by the shaded border around the 
slides.
 
■To select a contiguous group of slides (for example, slides 1, 2, and 3), click the ﬁ rst 
slide, and then hold down the Shift key as you click the last one. All of the slides 
in between are selected as well.
To cancel the selection of multiple slides, click anywhere outside of the selected slides.
To select slides from Outline view, click the slide icon to the left of the slide’s title; this 
selects the entire slide, as shown in Figure 3.6. It’s important to select the entire slide and 
not just part of its content before issuing a command such as Delete, because otherwise, 
the command only affects the portion that you selected.

Deleting Slides
You may want to get rid of some of the slides, especially if you created your presentation 
using a template that contained a lot of sample content. For example, the sample presenta-
tion may be longer than you need, or you may have inserted your own slides instead.
Select the slide or slides that you want to delete, and then do either of the following:
 
■Right-click the selection and choose Delete Slide.
 
■Press the Delete key on the keyboard.

Undoing Mistakes
Here’s a command that can help you in almost all of the other chapters in this book: undo-
ing. The Undo command allows you to reverse past actions. For example, you can use it to 
reverse all of the deletions that you made to your presentation in the preceding section. 
The easiest way to undo a single action is to click the Undo button on the Quick Access 
toolbar or press Ctrl+Z. You can click it as many times as you like; each time you click it, 
you undo one action.
By default, the maximum number of Undo operations is 20, but you can change this. Choose File ➪ Options, then 
click Advanced, and in the Editing Options section, change the Maximum Number of Undos setting. Keep in mind that 
if you set the number of undos too high, it can cause performance problems in PowerPoint.

85
Chapter 3: Creating Slides and Text Boxes
3
You can undo multiple actions at once by opening the Undo button’s drop-down list, as 
shown in Figure 3.7. Just drag the mouse across the actions that you want to undo (you 
don’t need to hold down the mouse button). Click when the desired actions are selected, 
and presto, they are all reversed. You can select multiple actions to undo, but you can’t skip 
around. For example, to undo the fourth item, you must undo the ﬁ rst, second, and third 
ones, as well.
FIGURE 3.7
Use the Undo button to undo your mistakes and the Redo button to reverse an Undo 
operation.
Undo button
The Redo command is the opposite of Undo. If you make a mistake with the Undo button, 
you can ﬁ x the problem by clicking the Redo button. Like the Undo button, it has a drop-
down list, and so you can redo multiple actions at once.
The Redo command is available only immediately after you use the Undo command. If Redo 
isn’t available, a Repeat button appears in its place. The Repeat command enables you to repeat 
the last action that you performed (and it doesn’t have to be an Undo operation). For example, 
you can repeat some typing, or some formatting. Figure 3.8 shows the Repeat button.
FIGURE 3.8
The Repeat button appears when Redo is not available, and enables you to repeat actions.

Rearranging Slides
The best way to rearrange slides is to do so in Slide Sorter view. In this view, the slides 
in your presentation appear in thumbnail view, and you can move them around on the 

86
Part I: Building Your Presentation
screen to different positions, just as you would manually rearrange pasted-up artwork on 
a table. Although you can also do this from the Slides pane in Normal view, you are able to 
see fewer slides at once. As a result, it can be more challenging to move slides around, for 
example, from one end of the presentation to another. To rearrange slides, use the follow-
ing steps:
 
1. Switch to Slide Sorter view or Normal view.
 
2. Select the slide that you want to move. You can move multiple slides at once if 
you like (which is a lot easier in Slide Sorter view than in Normal view).
 
3. Drag the selected slide to the new location. The slide moves as you drag, as 
shown in Figure 3.9.
FIGURE 3.9
Drag a slide to a different position in Slide Sorter view.
 
4. Release the mouse button. The slide moves to the new location.
You can also rearrange slides in Outline view. This is not quite as easy as using Slide Sorter 
view, but it’s more versatile. Not only can you drag entire slides from place to place, but you 
can also move individual bullets from one slide to another.

87
Chapter 3: Creating Slides and Text Boxes

Follow these steps to move content in Outline view:
 
1. Switch to Outline view.
 
2. Position the mouse pointer over the slide’s icon in the Outline pane. The mouse 
pointer changes to a four-headed arrow.
 
3. Click on the icon. PowerPoint selects all of the text in that slide.
 
4. Drag the slide’s icon up or down to a new position in the outline and then 
release the mouse button. All of the slide’s text moves with it to the new location.
There are also keyboard shortcuts for moving a slide up or down in the Outline pane that 
may be faster than clicking the toolbar buttons. You can press the Alt+Shift+Up arrow keys 
to move a slide up, and the Alt+Shift+Down arrow keys to move a slide down.
These shortcuts work equally well with single bullets from a slide. Just click to the left of a 
single line to select it, instead of clicking the Slide icon in step 3.
Using Content Placeholders
Now that you know something about inserting and managing entire slides, let’s take a 
closer look at the content within a slide. The default placeholder type is a multipurpose 
content placeholder, as shown in Figure 3.10.
FIGURE 3.10
A content placeholder can contain a variety of different elements.

Part I: Building Your Presentation
Inserting Content into a Placeholder
To type text into a content placeholder, click inside the placeholder box and start typing. 
You can enter and edit text as you would in any word-processing program. To insert any 
other type of content into a placeholder, click one of the icons shown in Figure 3.10. A dia-
log box opens to help you select and insert that content type.
 
Chapters 5 and 6 cover the various formatting that you can apply to text on a slide. You will learn about 
these various content types later in the book: 
Tables: Chapter 8
SmartArt: Chapter 10
Clip Art: Chapter 11
Pictures (from fi les): Chapter 11
Charts: Chapter 12
Video: Chapter 15
A content placeholder can hold only one type of content at a time. If you click in the place-
holder and type some text, the icons for the other content types disappear. To access them 
again, you must delete all of the text from the placeholder.
Placeholders versus Manually Inserted Objects
You can insert content on a slide independently of a placeholder by using the Insert tab’s 
buttons and menus. This technique allows you to insert an item in its own separate frame 
on any slide, to coexist with any placeholder content. You can learn how to insert each 
content type in the chapters in which they are covered (see the preceding list).
Creating Text Boxes Manually
The difference between a placeholder-inserted object and a manually inserted one is most 
signiﬁ cant with text boxes. Although you might think that text boxes are all alike, there 
are actually some signiﬁ cant differences between placeholder text boxes and manually 
inserted ones.
Here are some of the characteristics of a text placeholder:
 
■You cannot create new text placeholder boxes on your own, except in Slide Master 
view.
 
You learn how to use Slide Master view to create your own layouts that contain custom text placehold-
ers in Chapter 4.

89
Chapter 3: Creating Slides and Text Boxes

■If you delete all of the text from a text placeholder, the placeholder instructions 
return (in Normal or Outline view).
 
■A text placeholder box has a ﬁ xed size on the slide, regardless of the amount or 
size of text that it contains. You can resize it manually, but if you reapply the lay-
out, the placeholder box snaps back to the original size.
 
■AutoFit is turned on by default in a text placeholder, so that if you type more text 
than will ﬁ t, or resize the frame so that the existing text no longer ﬁ ts, the text 
shrinks in size.
 
■The text that you type in a text placeholder box appears in the Outline pane in 
Outline view.
A manual text box, on the other hand, is one that you create yourself using the Text Box 
tool on the Insert tab. Here are some characteristics of a manual text box:
 
■You can create a manual text box anywhere, and you can create as many as you 
like, regardless of the layout.
 
■If you delete all of the text from a manual text box, the text box remains empty or 
disappears completely. No placeholder instructions appear.
 
■A manual text box starts out small vertically, and expands as you type more text 
into it.
 
■A manual text box does not use AutoFit by default; the text box simply becomes 
larger to make room for more text.
 
■You cannot resize a manual text box so that the text that it contains no longer ﬁ ts; 
PowerPoint refuses to make the text box shorter vertically until you delete some 
text from it. (However, you can decrease its horizontal width.)
 
■Text typed in a manual text box does not appear in the Outline pane in Outline 
view.
Figure 3.11 shows two text placeholders (one empty) and a text box in Outline view. Notice 
that the empty placeholder contains ﬁ ller text to help you remember that it is there. Notice 
also that only the text from the placeholder appears in the Outline pane; the text-box text 
does not. Empty text boxes and placeholders do not show up in Slide Show view, so you do 
not have to worry about deleting any unneeded ones.
When Should You Use a Manual Text Box?
Graphical content such as photos and charts can work well either in placeholders or as man-
ually inserted objects. However, when it comes to text, you should stick with placeholders as 
often as possible. Placeholder text appears in the Outline pane in Outline view, whereas text 
in a manually inserted text box does not. When the bulk of a presentation’s text is in manu-
ally created text boxes, Outline view becomes less useful because it doesn’t contain the com-
plete presentation text. In addition, when you change to a different formatting theme that 
includes different positioning for placeholders — for example, to accommodate a graphic on 

90
Part I: Building Your Presentation
one side — the manual text boxes do not shift. As a result, they might end up overlapping 
the new background graphic with unattractive results. In a case such as this, you would 
need to manually go through each slide and adjust the positioning of each text box.
FIGURE 3.11

Text box
However, there are times when a manually created text box is preferable or even neces-
sary. For example, suppose that you have a schematic diagram of a machine and you need 
to label some of the parts. Manually placed text boxes are perfect for these little snippets 
of text that are scattered over the surface of the picture. Manual text boxes are also use-
ful for warnings, tips, and any other information that is tangential to the main discussion. 
Finally, if you want to vary the placement of the text on each slide (consciously circum-
venting the consistency provided by layouts), and you want to precisely position each box, 
then manual text boxes work well because they do not shift their position when you apply 
different themes or templates to the presentation.
If you insert text in a placeholder and then change the slide’s layout so that the slide no longer contains that place-
holder (for example, if you switch to Title Only or Blank layout), the text remains on the slide, but it becomes an 
orphan. If you delete the text box, then it simply disappears; a placeholder does not reappear. However, it does not 
become a manual text box, because its content still appears in the Outline pane, while a manual text box’s content 
does not.

91
Chapter 3: Creating Slides and Text Boxes

Creating a Manual Text Box
To manually place a text box on a slide, follow these steps:
 
1. If necessary, reposition the existing placeholders or objects on the slide to 
make room for the new text box.
 
2. Click Insert ➪ Text ➪ Text Box. The mouse pointer turns into a vertical line. You 
can alternately use the Text Box icon in any of the Shapes galleries, such as the one 
on the Insert tab.
 
3. Do either of the following: 
 
■To create a text box that automatically enlarges itself horizontally as you type 
more text, but does not automatically wrap text to the next line, click once 
where you want the text to start, and begin typing.
 
■To create a text box with a width that you specify, and that automatically wraps 
text to the next line and grows in height as needed, click and drag to draw a 
box where you want the text box to be. Its height will initially snap back to a 
single line’s height, regardless of the height that you initially draw; however, it 
will grow in height as you type text into it.
 
4. Type the text that you want to appear in the text box.
Working with Text Boxes
Text boxes (either placeholder or manual) form the basis of most presentations. Now that 
you know how to create them, and how to place text in them, let’s take a look at how to 
manipulate the boxes themselves.
 
Are you looking for information about formatting text boxes — perhaps to apply a background color or a 
border to one? See the formatting text boxes discussion in Chapter 7.
Selecting Text Boxes
On the surface, this topic might seem like a no-brainer. Just click it, right? Well, almost. 
A text box has two possible “selected” states. One state is that the box itself is selected, 
and the other is that the insertion point is within the box. The difference is subtle, but it 
becomes clearer when you issue certain commands. For example, if the insertion point is in 
the text box and you press Delete, PowerPoint deletes the single character to the right of 
the insertion point. However, if you select the entire text box and press Delete, PowerPoint 
deletes the entire text box and everything in it.
To select the entire text box, click its border. You can tell that it is selected because the 
border appears as a solid line. To move the insertion point within the text box, click inside 
the text box. You can tell that the insertion point is there because you can see it ﬂ ashing 
inside.

92
Part I: Building Your Presentation
In the rest of this book, when you see the phrase “select the text box,” it means the box 
itself should be selected, and the insertion point should not appear in it. For most of the 
upcoming sections it does not make any difference, although in a few cases it does.
When the insertion point is fl ashing in a text box, you can press Esc to select the text box itself.
You can select more than one text box at once by holding down the Shift key as you click 
additional text boxes. This technique is useful when you want to select more than one text 
box, for example, so that you can format them in the same way, or so that you can resize 
them by the same amount.
Sizing a Text Box
The basic techniques for sizing text boxes in PowerPoint are the same for every object type 
(for that matter, they are also the same as in other Ofﬁ ce applications). To resize a text 
box, or any object, follow these steps:
 
1. Position the mouse pointer over a selection handle for the object. The mouse 
pointer changes to a double-headed arrow. If you want to resize proportionally, 
make sure that you use a corner selection handle, and hold down the Shift key as 
you drag.
 
2. Click and drag the selection handle to resize the object’s border.
Allowing PowerPoint to manage placeholder size and position through layouts ensures consistency among your 
slides. When you start changing the sizes and positions of placeholders on individual slides, you can end up creating 
consistency problems, such as headings that aren’t in the same spot from slide to slide, or company logos that shift 
between slides.
You can also set a text box’s size from the Size group on the Drawing Tools Format tab. 
When the text box is selected, its current dimensions appear in the Height and Width 
boxes, as shown in Figure 3.12. You can change the dimensions within these boxes.
FIGURE 3.12
You can set an exact size for a text box from the Format tab’s Size group.

93
Chapter 3: Creating Slides and Text Boxes

You can also set the size of a text box from the Size and Position task pane:
 
1. Click the dialog box launcher in the Size group on the Drawing Tools Format 
tab, as shown in Figure 3.12. The Format Shape task pane opens with the Size 
options displayed. See Figure 3.13.
FIGURE 3.13
You can adjust the size of the text box from the Size controls in the 
Format Shape task pane.
 
2. Set the height and width for the text box in the Height and Width boxes, 
respectively..
To keep the size proportional, select the Lock Aspect Ratio check box in the Scale 
section before you start adjusting the height or width.
 
3. (Optional) Click the Close (X) button in the upper right corner of the task pane 
to close it.
Task panes are non-modal. This means that you can leave them open and continue to work on your presentation. It 
also means that any changes that you make are applied immediately; there is no OK button to accept your changes or 
Cancel button to reverse them. To reverse a change, you can use the Undo command (Ctrl+Z).

94
Part I: Building Your Presentation
Positioning a Text Box
To move an object, drag it by any part of its border other than a selection handle. Select 
the object, and then position the mouse pointer over a border so that the pointer turns 
into a four-headed arrow. Then drag the object to a new position. With a text box, you must 
position the mouse pointer over a border and not over the inside of the frame; with all 
other object types, you don’t have to be that precise; you can move an object by dragging 
anywhere within it.
You can also set an exact position by using the Format Shape task pane:
 
1. Click the dialog box launcher in the Size group on the Drawing Tools Format 
tab, as shown in Figure 3.12. The Format Shape dialog box opens with the Size 
controls displayed, as in Figure 3.13.
 
2. Click the Size heading to collapse the Size section, and then click the Position 
heading to expand the Position section. The Position controls appear, as shown in 
Figure 3.14. 
FIGURE 3.14
You can adjust the position with the Position controls.

95

3. Set the horizontal and vertical position, and the point from which it is mea-
sured. By default, measurements are from the top-left corner of the slide.
 
4. (Optional) Click the Close (X) button in the upper right corner of the task pane 
to close it.
Changing a Text Box’s AutoFit Behavior
When there is too much text to ﬁ t in a text box, there are three things that may happen:
 
■Do not AutoFit. The text and the box can continue at their default sizes, and the 
text can overﬂ ow out of the box or be truncated.
 
■Shrink text on overflow. The text can shrink its font size to ﬁ t in the text box. 
This is the default setting for placeholder text boxes.
 
■Resize shape to fit text. The text box can enlarge to the size needed to contain 
the text. This is the default setting for manual text boxes.
Whenever there is too much text in a placeholder box, the AutoFit icon appears in the bot-
tom-left corner. Click that icon to display a menu, as shown in Figure 3.15. From that menu, 
you can turn AutoFit on or off. Depending on the text-box type, you might not have all the 
menu items shown in Figure 3.15.
FIGURE 3.15
You can use the AutoFit icon’s menu to change the AutoFit setting for a text box.
With a manual text box, the AutoFit icon does not appear, and so you must adjust the 
AutoFit behavior in the text box’s properties. The following method works for both manual 
and placeholder boxes:
 
1. Right-click the border of the text box and choose Format Shape. The Format 
Shape task pane opens.
 
2. Click Text Options. Three icons appear: Text Fill & Outline, Text Effects, and Text 
Box. 
You can point at an icon to see a ScreenTip containing its name.
 
3. Click the Text Box icon. Controls appear that pertain to the text box itself. See 
Figure 3.16.

96
Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 3.16
Click the Text Box icon to change text box options, including AutoFit behavior.
 
4. Click one of the AutoFit options, as shown in Figure 3.16.
 
5. (Optional) Click the Close (X) button in the upper right corner of the task pane 
to close it.
One other setting that also affects AutoFit behavior is the Wrap Text in Shape option. This 
on/off toggle, which appears as a check box in Figure 3.16, enables text to automatically 
wrap to the next line when it reaches the right edge of the text box. By default, this set-
ting is On for placeholder text boxes and for manual text boxes that you create by dragging. 
However, it is Off by default for manual text boxes that you create by clicking. 
Table 3.1 summarizes the various AutoFit behaviors and how they interact with one 
another.

Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to create new slides, either from scratch or from outside 
sources. You learned how to select, rearrange, and delete slides, and how to place content 
on a slide. Along the way, you learned the difference between a content placeholder and a 
manually inserted object, and how to create your own text boxes, move and resize objects, 
and ﬁ nd or replace text. These are all very basic skills, and perhaps not as interesting as 
some of the more exciting topics to come, but mastering them will serve you well as you 
build your presentation.
In the next chapter, you’ll learn about themes and layouts, two of the innovative features 
in PowerPoint 2013 that make it such an improvement over earlier versions. You’ll ﬁ nd out 
how a theme differs from a template and how it applies font, color, and effect formatting 
to a presentation. You will then apply layouts and create your own custom layouts and 
themes.

M
ost presentations consist of multiple slides, so you’ll need a way of ensuring consistency 
among them. Not only will you want each slide (in most cases) to have the same back-
ground, fonts, and text positioning, but you will also want a way of ensuring that any 
changes you make to those settings later automatically populate across all your slides.
To accomplish these goals, PowerPoint offers layouts, themes, and masters. Layouts determine the 
positioning of placeholders; themes assign color, font, and background choices; and masters transfer 
theme settings to the slides and provide an opportunity for repeated content, such as a logo, on 
each slide. In this chapter you learn how to use layouts, themes, and masters to create a presenta-
tion that is attractive, consistent, and easy to manage.
Understanding Layouts and Themes
As you learned in Chapter 3, a layout is a positioning template. The layout used for a slide deter-
mines what content placeholders will appear and how they will be arranged. For example, the 
layout shown in Figure 4.1 is called Title Slide, and it contains a Title placeholder and a Subtitle 
placeholder.

FIGURE 4.1
This slide uses the Title Slide layout and the Facet theme.

A theme is a group of design settings. It includes color settings, font choices, object effect 
settings, and in some cases also a background graphic. In Figure 4.1, the theme applied is 
called Facet, and it is responsible for the colored shapes and lines on the edges, the colors 
of those graphics, and the fonts used on the slide. 
A theme is applied to a slide master, which is a sample slide and not part of the regular 
presentation, existing only behind-the-scenes to provide its settings to the real slides. It 
holds the formatting that you want to be consistent among all the slides in the presenta-
tion (or at least a group of them, because a presentation can have multiple slide masters). 
Technically, you do not apply a theme to a slide; you apply a theme to a slide master, and 
then you apply a slide master to a slide. That’s because a slide master can actually con-
tain some additional elements besides the formatting of the theme such as extra graphics, 
dates, footer text, and so on.
Themes versus Templates
As you learned in Chapter 1, a template is a ﬁ le on which you can base new presentations. 
Templates typically have a .potx extension (or a .potm extension if macro-enabled). A 
template may contain one or more themes (that is, sets of design choices, like backgrounds, 
layouts, and font choices), plus one or more slides containing sample text. 
A theme is both simpler than and more complex than a template. A theme can exist either 
inside of a template or as a separate ﬁ le with a .thmx extension. A theme is simpler 

101
Chapter 4: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters

because it cannot hold some of the things a template can hold, such as sample content. A 
theme can provide only font, color, effect, and background settings to the presentation. 
(It can also provide slide layouts, but let’s postpone that discussion for a bit.) On the other 
hand, a theme can also do more than a PowerPoint template, in that you can apply a theme 
saved as a separate ﬁ le to other Ofﬁ ce applications, so you can share its color, font, and 
effect settings with Word or Excel, for example. 
Where Themes Are Stored
A theme is an XML ﬁ le (or a snippet of XML code embedded in a presentation or template 
ﬁ le). A theme can come from any of these sources:
 
■Built-in: Some themes are embedded in PowerPoint itself and are available from the 
Themes gallery on the Design tab regardless of the template in use.
 
■Custom (automatically loaded): The default storage location for user-created 
theme ﬁ les is C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Document 
Themes. All themes (and templates containing themes) stored here are automati-
cally displayed among the gallery of theme choices on the Design tab, in a Custom 
category.
If you don’t want to delete a custom theme fi le, but you also don’t want it showing up in the gallery all the time, move 
the fi le to a folder outside of the Document Themes folder hierarchy. For example, create an Unused Themes folder 
on your hard disk and move it there until you need it. When you want to use the custom color theme again, move the 
fi le back to its original location.
 
■Inherited from starting template: If you start a presentation using a template 
other than the default blank one, that template might have one or more themes 
included in it.
 
■Stored in current presentation: If you modify a theme in Slide Master view while 
you are working on a presentation, the modiﬁ ed code for the theme is embedded in 
that presentation ﬁ le.
 
■Stored in a separate file: If you save a theme (using any of a variety of methods 
you’ll learn later in this chapter), you create a separate theme ﬁ le with a .thmx 
extension. These ﬁ les can be shared among other Ofﬁ ce applications, so you can 
standardize settings such as font and color choices across applications. (Some of 
the unique PowerPoint portions of the theme are ignored when you use the theme 
in other applications.)
Themes, Layouts, and Slide Master View
In PowerPoint 2013, the slide master has separate layout masters for each layout, and you 
can customize and create new layouts. Look at Figure 4.2, which shows Slide Master view. 
Notice along the left side that there is a different, separately customizable layout master 

102
Part I: Building Your Presentation
for each available layout, all grouped beneath the slide master. Any changes you make to 
the slide master trickle down to the individual layout masters, but you can also customize 
each of the individual layout masters to override a trickle-down setting. For example, on a 
particular layout you can choose to omit the background graphic to free up its space on the 
slide for extra content.
FIGURE 4.2
Slide Master view enables you to make design changes that affect the entire presentation.
Figure 4.2 shows the left pane enlarged so that the slide master and layout masters appear larger than the default. 
If you would like your screen to look like that, drag the divider between the panes to the right until the thumbnails in 
the left pane are a readable size. 
A master is a set of speciﬁ cations that govern formatting and appearance. PowerPoint actu-
ally has three masters: the slide master (for slides), the handout master (for handouts), and 
the notes master (for speaker notes). This chapter deals only with the slide master.
 
For more on the handout and notes masters, see Chapter 17.

103
Chapter 4: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters
4
The slide master holds the settings from a theme and applies them to one or more slides 
in your presentation. A slide master is not exactly the same thing as a theme because the 
theme can also be external to PowerPoint and used in other programs, but there’s a rough 
equivalency there. A slide master is the representation of a particular theme applied to a 
particular presentation.
Which themes appear in Slide Master view? The ones you have applied to at least one slide in the presentation, plus 
any custom themes copied from another presentation (see the section “Copying a Theme from Another Presentation” 
for more details) and any themes inherited from the template used to create the presentation. The built-in themes do 
not show up here unless they are in use. 
When you make changes to a slide master, those changes trickle down to the individual 
layout masters associated with it. When you make changes to an individual layout master, 
those changes are conﬁ ned to that layout in that master only.
To enter Slide Master view, choose View ➪ Master Views ➪ Slide Master. A Slide Master tab 
appears. To exit from Slide Master view, choose Slide Master ➪ Close ➪ Close Master View or 
select a different view from the View tab.
Changing a Slide’s Layout
As you construct your presentation, you may ﬁ nd it useful to change a slide’s layout. For 
example, you might want to switch from a slide that contains one big content placeholder 
to one that has two side-by-side placeholders, to compare/contrast two lists, drawings, or 
diagrams.
Many of the layouts PowerPoint provides contain multipurpose placeholders that accept 
various types of content. For example, the default layout, called Title and Content, has 
placeholders for a slide title plus a single type of content—text, a table, a chart, a picture, 
a piece of clip art, a SmartArt diagram, or a video. You choose the layout you want based 
on the number and arrangement of the placeholders, and not the type of content that will 
go into them.
When you change to a different layout, you change the type and/or positioning of the 
placeholders on it. If the previous placeholders had content in them, that content shifts to 
a new location on the slide to reﬂ ect the different positioning for that placeholder type. 
If the new layout does not contain a placeholder appropriate for that content, the content 
remains on the slide but becomes orphaned. This means it is a free-ﬂ oating object, outside 
of the layout. You need to manually position an orphaned object if it’s not in the right 
spot. However, if you later apply a different layout that does contain a placeholder for the 
orphaned object, it snaps back into that placeholder.

104
Part I: Building Your Presentation
To switch a slide to a different layout, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the slide or slides to affect.
 
2. Click Home ➪ Slides ➪ Layout. A menu of layouts appears, as shown in Figure 4.3.
FIGURE 4.3
Switch to a different layout for the selected slide(s).
 
3. Click the desired layout.
 
If you want to modify a built-in layout, or create your own layouts, see “Customizing and Creating 
Layouts” later in this chapter.
When a presentation has more than one slide master deﬁ ned, separate layouts appear for 
each of the slide master themes. Figure 4.4 shows the Layout menu for a presentation that 
has two slide masters.

105
Chapter 4: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters

FIGURE 4.4
When there are multiple slide masters, each one’s layout is separate.
Applying a Theme
As you learned in “Understanding Layouts and Themes” at the beginning of this chapter, 
themes enable you to apply different designs to the presentation. A theme includes a back-
ground graphic (usually), color and font choices, and graphic effect settings. A theme can 
also include custom layouts. 
The method for applying a theme depends on whether that theme is already available in the 
current presentation or not. Some themes are built into PowerPoint so that they are always 
available; other themes are available only when you use certain templates, or when you 
speciﬁ cally apply them from an external ﬁ le. The following sections explain each of those 
possibilities.

106
Part I: Building Your Presentation
Themes, also called design themes, contain a combination of colors, fonts, effects, backgrounds, and layouts. There 
are also more specialized themes: color themes, font themes, and effect themes. When this book uses the term 
“theme” alone, it’s referring to a design theme. Where there is potential for confusion, the book calls it a design 
theme to help differentiate it from the more specifi c types of themes.
Applying a Theme from the Gallery
A gallery in PowerPoint is a menu of samples from which you can choose. You saw the 
Layout gallery in Figures 4.2 and 4.3, for example.
The Themes gallery is a menu of all of the built-in themes plus any additional themes avail-
able from the current template or presentation ﬁ le.
To select a theme from the gallery, follow these steps:
 
1. (Optional) If you want to affect only certain slides, select them. (Slide Sorter 
view works well for this.)
 
2. On the Design tab, in the Themes group, if the theme you want appears, click 
it, and skip the rest of these steps. If the theme you want does not appear, you 
will need to open the gallery. To do so, click the down arrow with the line over it, 
as shown in Figure 4.5.
FIGURE 4.5
Open the Themes gallery by clicking the down arrow with the line above it.
Click here to open
the Themes gallery
The Themes gallery opens, as shown in Figure 4.6. The gallery is divided into sec-
tions based upon the source of the theme. Themes stored in the current presenta-
tion appear at the top, under the This Presentation heading; custom themes you 
have added (if any) appear next, under a Custom heading. Built-in themes appear at 
the bottom, under the Ofﬁ ce heading.

107
Chapter 4: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters

FIGURE 4.6
Select the desired theme from the menu.
You can drag the bottom-right corner of the menu to resize the gallery. 
 
3. Click the theme you want to apply.
 
■If you selected multiple slides in step 1, the theme is applied only to them.
 
■If you selected a single slide in step 1, the theme is applied to the entire 
presentation.
To override the default behavior in step 3, so that you can apply a different theme to a 
single slide, right-click instead of clicking in step 3 and choose Apply to Selected Slide(s) 
from the shortcut menu. 
Applying a Theme from a Theme or Template File
You can open and use externally saved theme ﬁ les in any Ofﬁ ce application. This makes it 
possible to share color, font, and other settings between applications to create consistency 
between documents of various types. You can also save and load themes from templates.

108
Part I: Building Your Presentation
 
To create your own theme fi les, see “Creating a New Theme” later in this chapter.
To apply a theme to the presentation from a theme or template ﬁ le, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Design tab, open the Themes gallery (see Figure 4.6) and click Browse 
for Themes. The Choose Theme or Themed Document dialog box opens.
 
2. Navigate to the folder containing the file and select it.
 
3. Click Apply.
Any custom themes you might have previously saved are located by default in C:\Users\username\AppData\
Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Document Themes.  However, you don’t need to navigate to that location to open a 
theme fi le because all themes stored here are automatically included in the gallery already.
Applying a Theme Variant
Some themes come in several versions, called variants. These variants have the same basic 
slide layouts and background graphics as the original, but may have different color, font, 
and/or effect choices. For example, a theme that has a white background and black text 
might have a black-background variant with white text. Variants are new in PowerPoint 
2013.
To apply a variant, ﬁ rst apply the desired theme, using any of the methods you learned 
about earlier in this chapter. Then, on the Design tab, click one of the variants in the 
Variants group. See Figure 4.7.  
FIGURE 4.7
Select a variant for the chosen theme from the Design tab.
Variants
The Variants group, like the Themes group, has a down-pointing arrow button with a line 
over it that you can click to open up a full gallery of choices. However, most themes have 
only a few variants to choose from, so all the variants may already be visible without open-
ing the gallery.

Managing Themes
Themes are applied to slide masters to specify the background, color, font, and effect for-
matting for all the slides that have that slide master assigned to them. (A single presenta-
tion ﬁ le can have multiple slide masters, and therefore multiple themes.) 
Some themes are built into PowerPoint, and you can also create and save your own themes 
as separate ﬁ les and apply them to other presentations or even to other Ofﬁ ce documents, 
such as in Word and Excel. In this section you learn how to create new themes, manage 
theme ﬁ les, and apply themes across multiple presentations.
Creating a New Theme
To create a new theme, ﬁ rst format a slide master exactly the way you want, including any 
custom layouts, backgrounds, colors, and font themes. (You will learn how to make those 
changes later in this chapter.) Then save the slide master’s formatting as a new theme by 
following these steps:
 
1. Open Slide Master view if it is not already open (View ➪ Master Views ➪ Slide 
Master), and select the desired slide master in the left pane. 
You should have already formatted this slide master the way you want the new 
theme to be. If you haven't yet, see the sections "Changing Colors, Fonts, and 
Effects" and "Changing the Background" later in this chapter to make the needed 
changes. 
As you learned in "Themes, Layouts, and Slide Master View" earlier in this chapter, the default slide master is the 
larger thumbnail at the top of the tree in the left pane. Notice that there are slightly smaller thumbnail images under 
it; those are its individual layout masters. There may be more than one slide master; scroll the left pane down to see 
if there's another Slide Master below the default one.
 
2. Click Slide Master ➪ Edit Theme ➪ Themes ➪ Save Current Theme. The Save 
Current Theme dialog box opens.
 
 The default location shown in the Save Current Theme dialog box is C:\Users\user-
name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Document Themes where username is 
the current Windows user. 
 
3. Type a name for the theme file in the File Name text box. See Figure 4.8.
 
4. Click Save. The new theme is saved to your hard disk.
The new theme is now available from the Themes button’s menu in all presentations you 
create, as long as you are signed into Windows as the same user on the same PC. All of the 
theme's formatting is available, including any custom color or font themes it includes. 

110
Part I: Building Your Presentation
You can use the saved theme in other programs too; in Word or Excel, choose Page 
Layout ➪ Themes in one of those programs.
FIGURE 4.8
Save the current slide master’s settings as a new theme.
Renaming a Theme
You can rename a theme ﬁ le by renaming the .thmx ﬁ le from File Explorer (Windows 
Explorer), from outside of PowerPoint. By default, theme ﬁ les are stored in: C:\Users\user-
name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Document Themes.
Don't want to leave PowerPoint to do this? You can also rename a theme ﬁ le from inside 
PowerPoint by using any dialog box that saves or opens ﬁ les. For example, to use the 
Choose Theme or Themed Document dialog box to rename a theme, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Design or Slide Master tab, click Themes, and choose Save Current 
Theme. The Choose Theme or Themed Document dialog box opens.
 
2. If needed, navigate to C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\
Templates\Document Themes. (That location may appear automatically.)
 
3. Right-click the theme file and choose Rename. See Figure 4.9.
 
4. Type the new name for the theme and press Enter.
 
5. Click Cancel to close the dialog box.

111
Chapter 4: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters

FIGURE 4.9
Right-click the theme fi le and choose Rename.
Deleting a Theme
A custom theme ﬁ le continues appearing on the Themes gallery indeﬁ nitely. If you want to 
remove it from there, you must delete it. The easiest way to delete a theme is to right-click 
it in the Themes gallery and choose Delete.
You can also browse to the folder containing your saved custom themes and delete from 
there. See the previous section, "Renaming a Theme," to learn an easy way to get access to 
that folder without leaving PowerPoint.
Copying a Theme from Another Presentation
One easy way to copy a theme from one presentation to another is copy a slide master that 
has that theme applied to it. Follow these steps to learn how to do that:
 
1. Open both presentations, and switch to Slide Master view in both presentations 
(View ➪ Master Views ➪ Slide Master).

112
Part I: Building Your Presentation
 
2. Select the slide master that already uses the desired theme, and press Ctrl+C to 
copy it.
 
3. Switch to the other presentation (click View ➪ Window ➪ Switch Windows and 
click the other presentation's file name).
 
4. Press Ctrl+V to paste the slide master (and its associated theme and layouts) 
into Slide Master view in the other presentation.
As you will learn in "Preserving a Slide Master" later in this chapter, you can preserve a slide master in Slide Master view so that 
it doesn’t get deleted automatically when there are no slides based on it. By creating new slide masters, applying themes to 
them, and then preserving them, you can create a whole library of themes in a single presentation or template file. Then to make 
this library of themes available in another presentation, you simply base the new presentation on that existing presentation (or 
template).
Changing Colors, Fonts, and Effects
In addition to overall themes, which govern several types of formatting, PowerPoint also 
provides many built-in color, font, and effect themes that you can apply separately from 
your choice of design theme. So, for example, you can apply a design theme that contains 
a background design you like, as you learned to do earlier in this chapter, and then change 
the colors, fonts, and effects for it.
In the following sections, you’ll learn how to apply some of these built-in color, font, and 
effect settings to a presentation without changing the theme. For example, you might 
choose to make changes in the colors, fonts, and/or effects to customize a theme, and then 
save it as a custom theme, as you learned in "Creating a New Theme" earlier in this chapter. 
You can change Color, Font, and Effect themes from Slide Master view, or you can choose them from the menu that 
appears when you open the Variants gallery on the Design tab.  In this chapter we use the Slide Master method.
Understanding Color Placeholders
To understand how PowerPoint changes colors when you choose a different theme or vari-
ant, you must know something about how PowerPoint handles colors in general. 
PowerPoint uses a set of color placeholders for the bulk of its color formatting. Because 
each item’s color is deﬁ ned by a placeholder, and not as a ﬁ xed color, you can easily change 
the colors by switching to a different color theme. This way if you decide, for example, that 
you want all the slide titles to be blue rather than green, you make the change once and it 
is applied to all slides automatically.

113
Chapter 4: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters
4
A group of colors assigned to preset placeholders is a color theme. PowerPoint contains 20+ 
built-in color themes that are available regardless of the overall theme applied to the pre-
sentation. Because design themes use placeholders to deﬁ ne their colors, you can apply 
the desired design theme to the presentation and then ﬁ ne-tune the colors afterward by 
experimenting with the built-in color themes.
How many color placeholders are there in a color theme? There are actually 12, but some-
times not all of them are available to be applied to individual objects. When you choose a 
color theme, the gallery of themes from which you choose shows only the ﬁ rst eight colors 
of each color theme. It doesn’t matter so much here because you can’t apply individual col-
ors from there anyway. When selecting colors from a color picker (used for applying ﬁ ll and 
border color to speciﬁ c objects), as in Figure 4.10, there are 10 theme swatches. And when 
you deﬁ ne a new custom color theme, there are 12 placeholders to set up. The ﬁ nal two are 
for visited and unvisited hyperlinks; these colors aren’t included in a color picker.
FIGURE 4.10
PowerPoint uses color pickers such as this one to enable you to easily apply color 
placeholders to objects.
Changing the Color Theme
After applying the overall theme you want, you might want to apply different colors. One 
way to get different colors, as you saw earlier in this chapter, is to apply a variant. The 
variants are just the tip of the iceberg, though; many more color themes are available. To 
switch to a different color theme, follow these steps:
 
1. Open Slide Master view (View ➪ Master Views ➪ Slide Master and click the 
desired slide master.
 
2. Click Slide Master ➪ Background ➪ Colors. A gallery of color themes opens. See 
Figure 4.11.

114
Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 4.11
Choose the desired color theme.
 
3. (Optional) Point to a color theme and observe the preview on the slide behind 
the list.
 
4. Click the desired color theme. 
Understanding Font Placeholders
By default in most themes and templates, text box fonts are not set to a speciﬁ c font, but 
to one of two designations: Heading or Body. Then a font theme deﬁ nes what speciﬁ c fonts 
to use. To change the fonts across the entire presentation, all you have to do is apply a dif-
ferent font theme.
A font theme is an XML-based speciﬁ cation that deﬁ nes a pair of fonts: one for headings 
and one for body text. Then that font is applied to the text boxes in the presentation 
based on their statuses of Heading or Body. For example, all of the slide titles are usually 
set to Heading, and all of the content placeholders and manual text boxes are usually set to 
Body.

115
Chapter 4: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters

In a blank presentation (default blank template), when you click inside a slide title place-
holder box, you see Calibri Light (Headings) in the Font group on the Home tab. Figure 
4.12 shows that the current font is Calibri Light, and the (Headings) notation following 
the name indicates that it is being used only because the font theme speciﬁ es it. You could 
change the font theme to Verdana/Verdana, for example, and then the font designation for 
that box would appear as Verdana (Headings). The word (Headings) might be truncated, as 
it is in Figure 4.12, if your PowerPoint window is not wide enough to allow it to display in 
full. 
FIGURE 4.12
When some text is using a font placeholder rather than a fi xed font, (Headings) or (Body) 
appears after its name in the Font group on the Home tab.
In some font themes, the same font is used for both headings and body. In many other font 
themes, though, the heading and body fonts are different. The default font theme for blank 
presentations is Calibri Light/Calibri—the same basic font, but with a thinner version for 
the headings.
Changing the Font Theme
After applying a design theme, you might decide you want to use different fonts in the pre-
sentation. To switch to a different font theme, follow these steps:
 
1. Open Slide Master view (View ➪ Master Views ➪ Slide Master) and click the 
desired slide master. See the note in the previous section about selecting slide 
masters vs. layout masters. 
 
2. Click Slide Master ➪ Background ➪ Fonts. A gallery of font themes opens. See 
Figure 4.13.
 
3. (Optional) Point to a font theme and observe the change on the slide behind 
the list.
 
4. Click the desired font theme.
Changing the Effect Theme
Effect themes apply to several types of drawings that PowerPoint can construct, including 
SmartArt, charts, and drawn lines and shapes. They make the surfaces of objects formatted 
with 3-D attributes look like different textures (more or less shiny-looking, colors more or 
less deep, and so on).

116
Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 4.13
Select the font theme you want for your slide.
To change the effect theme, follow these steps:
 
1. Open Slide Master view (View ➪ Master Views ➪ Slide Master) and click the 
desired slide master. See the note in the previous section about selecting slide 
masters vs. layout masters. 
 
2. Click Slide Master ➪ Background ➪ Effects. A menu of effect options appears. See 
Figure 4.14.
 
3. (Optional) Point to a theme and observe the change on the slide master behind 
the list. (This works only if you have an object on that slide that is affected by 
the effect theme; see the sidebar “Setting Up a Graphic on Which to Test Effect 
Themes” to set up such an object.)
 
4. Click the desired effect theme. 

117

Setting Up a Graphic on Which to Test Effect 
Themes
Effect themes are most evident when you use colorful 3-D graphics, so do the following to construct 
a dummy diagram that you can use to try out effect themes:
 
1. Switch to Slide Master view. 
 
2. Click Insert ➪ Illustrations ➪ SmartArt. The Choose a SmartArt Graphic dialog box 
opens.
 
3. Click Cycle, click the top left diagram, and click OK. A SmartArt diagram appears on 
the slide master. 
 
4. On the SmartArt Tools Design tab, click Change Colors, and click the ﬁ rst sample 
under Colorful.
 
5. On the SmartArt Tools Design tab, open the SmartArt Styles gallery and click the 
ﬁ rst sample under 3-D.
Now you have a diagram on which you can see the effect themes applied. After using this diagram to 
help you choose the desired effect theme, delete the diagram from the slide master. To delete the 
diagram, select the diagram’s outer frame and press the Delete key on the keyboard.

118
Part I: Building Your Presentation
Creating a Custom Color Theme
You can deﬁ ne your own custom color themes, and save them for reuse in other presenta-
tions. By default these are saved in the personal folders for the logged-in user on the local 
PC, and they remain available to that user regardless of the theme or template in use. These 
custom color themes are also included if you save the design theme as a separate theme 
ﬁ le (.thmx), so that you can take those settings to another PC or send them to some other 
user.
A custom color theme deﬁ nes speciﬁ c colors for each of the 12 color placeholders (includ-
ing the two that you can’t directly use—the ones for hyperlinks). To create a custom color 
theme, ﬁ rst apply a color theme to the current presentation that is as close as possible to 
the color theme you want. This makes it easier because you have to redeﬁ ne fewer place-
holders. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Open Slide Master view if it is not already open (View ➪ Master Views ➪ Slide 
Master).
 
2. Click Slide Master ➪ Background ➪ Colors and choose Customize Colors. The 
Create New Theme Colors dialog box opens.
 
3. Type a name for the new color theme in the Name box, replacing the default 
name (Custom 1, or other number if there is already a Custom 1).
 
4. Click a color placeholder and open its menu. See Figure 4.15.
FIGURE 4.15
Select the color for the chosen placeholder.

5. Click a color in the Standard Colors section. Or, if none of the colors there ﬁ t 
your needs, click More Colors, select a color from the Colors dialog box (see Figure 
4.16), and click OK. The Colors dialog box has two tabs: The Standard tab has color 
swatches, and the Custom tab enables you to deﬁ ne a color numerically by its RGB 
(Red Green Blue) or HSL (Hue Saturation Lightness).
FIGURE 4.16
Choose a custom color if none of the standard colors is appropriate.
 
6. Redefine any other colors as needed.
 
7. Click Save. The color theme is saved, and now appears at the top of the Colors gal-
lery, in the Custom area.
Creating a Custom Font Theme
You can create your own custom font themes, which are then available in all presentations. 
A custom font theme deﬁ nes two fonts: one for headings and one for body text. To create a 
custom font theme, follow these steps:
 
1. Open Slide Master view if it is not already open (View ➪ Master Views ➪ Slide 
Master).
 
2. Click Slide Master ➪ Background ➪ Fonts and choose Customize Fonts. The 
Create New Theme Fonts dialog box opens. See Figure 4.17.
 
3. Type a name for the new font theme in the Name box, replacing the default 
text there.
 
4. Open the Heading Font drop-down list and select the desired font for headings.

6. Click Save. The font theme is saved, and now appears at the top of the Fonts list, 
in the Custom area.
You cannot create custom effect themes.
Sharing a Custom Color or Font Theme with Others
A custom color theme or font theme is available only to the currently logged-in user on the 
PC on which it is created. If you want to share it with another user on the same PC, you 
can copy it into his or her user folder.  In File Explorer (Windows Explorer), start out at C:\
Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Document Themes where username 
is your Windows sign-in name and then navigate to the appropriate subfolder there: Theme 
Colors or Theme Fonts.
The default color and font themes are located in C:\Program Files\Microsoft Ofﬁ ce\
Document Themes, in the Theme Colors or Theme Fonts folder, respectively.
Another way to share a custom color or font theme is to save the (design) theme to a theme 
ﬁ le (.thmx). See “Creating a New Theme” earlier in this chapter. The resulting theme ﬁ le 
will contain the custom colors and fonts. 
Deleting a Custom Color or Font Theme
A custom color or font theme remains until you delete it. The easiest way to do so is to 
click the button for the appropriate type (Color or Font) on the Slide Master tab in Slide 
Master view, and then right-click the theme in the Gallery and click Delete. 
You can also delete the color or font theme from outside of PowerPoint. To delete a theme 
color, use File Explorer (Windows Explorer) to navigate to this folder: C:\Users\username\
AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates\Document Themes\Theme Colors where username 

121
Chapter 4: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters

is your Windows sign-in name, and you’ll ﬁ nd an .xml ﬁ le for each of your custom color 
themes. (You'll ﬁ nd the font themes in .xml ﬁ les in the Theme Fonts folder.) Delete the 
ﬁ les for the color or font themes that you want to delete. 
Changing the Background
The background is the color, texture, pattern, or image that is applied to the entire slide (or 
slide master), on which everything else sits. By its very deﬁ nition, it applies to the entire 
surface of the slide; you cannot have a partial background. However, you can have a back-
ground graphic overlaid on top of the background. A background graphic is a graphic image 
placed on the slide master that complements and works with the background.
It’s important to understand the distinction between a background and a background 
graphic because even though most themes contain both, they are set up differently. Making 
the change you want to the overall appearance of your slides often involves changing both. 
For example, Figure 4.18 shows the Facet theme applied to a slide master. The slide back-
ground is pure white, and a green background graphic is overlaid on it. This background 
graphic is composed of several different shapes, colors with different shades of green, plus 
a few gray straight lines. Each of those graphic objects can be individually edited, moved, 
or even deleted from the slide master. The white background itself can be changed via the 
Format Background command.
FIGURE 4.18
A slide’s background is separate from its background graphic(s) if any are present.
Background
graphics
Most themes consist of both background formatting (even if it is just a solid color) and a 
background graphic. The background graphics included in the built-in themes in PowerPoint 
are unique to those themes, and not available as separate graphics outside of them. So, for 

122
Part I: Building Your Presentation
example, if you want the colored shapes shown in Figure 4.18, the only way to get them is 
to apply the Facet theme. Because the decorative background graphics are unique to each 
theme, many people choose a theme based on the desired background graphics, and then 
customize the slide master’s appearance to modify the theme as needed.
To use a background graphic from one template with the look-and-feel of another, apply the first theme to a slide, and then in 
Slide Master view copy the background graphic to the clipboard. Then apply the second theme and paste the graphic from the 
clipboard onto the second Slide Master.
Applying a Background Style
Background styles are preset background formats that come with the built-in themes in 
PowerPoint. Depending on the theme you apply, different background styles are available. 
These background styles use the color placeholders from the theme, so their color offerings 
change depending on the color theme applied.
To apply a background style, follow these steps:
 
1. Switch to Slide Master view.
 
2. (Optional) To affect certain layouts, select the layout(s) to affect from the left 
pane. To select more than one layout at once, hold down the Ctrl key as you click 
the layouts you want. Or, to affect all layouts, select the slide master itself.
 
3. Click Slide Master ➪ Background ➪ Background Styles.
A gallery of styles appears, as shown in Figure 4.19.
FIGURE 4.19
Apply a preset background style.

123
Chapter 4: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters

4. Click the desired style to apply it to the selected layouts only (or to all layouts 
if you selected the Slide Master in step 2). Alternatively, you can right-click the 
desired style and choose Apply to All Layouts to apply the change to all layouts 
even if you did not select the Slide Master in step 2.
You cannot customize background styles or add your own custom background styles; there 
are always 12 of them, and they are always determined by the theme. If you need a differ-
ent background, you can apply a custom background ﬁ ll, as described in the following sec-
tions, which lets you modify the background in a variety of ways.
Applying a Custom Background Fill
A custom background ﬁ ll can include solid colors, gradients, textures, or graphics. Because 
Chapter 9 covers those ﬁ ll types in more detail, this section covers how to specify your own 
background ﬁ ll, which involves the following steps:
 
1. (Optional) To affect only certain slides, select them. You can do this in Normal, 
Outline, or Slide Sorter view. (Or, to affect certain layouts, go into Slide Master 
view and choose the layouts you want to customize, or select the slide master to 
customize all layouts at once.)
 
2. Click Design ➪ Customize ➪ Format Background. Or, if you are in Slide Master 
view, click Slide Master ➪ Background ➪ Background Styles ➪ Format Background.  
The Format Background dialog box opens.
Notice that there are three icons under the Format Background heading in the task 
pane: Fill, Effects, and Picture. Fill is selected by default, as shown in Figure 4.20. 
Each of these opens a separate set of options when clicked. However, the Effects 
and Picture controls are active only when certain picture or texture ﬁ lls are in use, 
so we'll stick with the Fill settings in this procedure.
 
3. Choose the option button that best describes the type of fill you want. The con-
trols change for the type you chose. Figure 4.20 shows the controls for a solid ﬁ ll. 
 
4. Set the options for the fill type that you chose. For example, in Figure 4.20, click 
the Color button and choose a color. The changes you make apply immediately.
 
See Chapter 9 for details about the fi ll types and how to confi gure their options.
 
5. (Optional) To apply the change to all slides, click Apply to All. Otherwise the 
change will apply only to the slides (or layouts) you selected in step 1.
 
6. (Optional) To apply a different background to some other slides, select them 
and repeat steps 3 and 4. The Format Background task pane can stay open as long 
as you need it. Its changes are applied immediately.
 
7. When you are finished with the Format Background task pane, click its Close 
(X) button in its upper right corner to close it.

124
Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 4.20
With the Fill icon selected, choose the fi ll type that best fi ts your needs.
Working with Background Graphics
In Figure 4.20, one of the ﬁ ll types you saw on the list was Picture or texture ﬁ ll. This type 
of ﬁ ll covers the entire background with the picture or texture that you specify.
That's not what we mean by a background graphic in this section, however. A background 
graphic in the context of the following discussion is an object or a picture overlaid on top 
of the background on the slide master, like those shapes I pointed out in Figure 4.18. The 
background graphics complement the background, and might or might not cover the entire 
background.
Many of the theme-provided background graphics actually consist of multiple shapes, and in some cases they are 
grouped together. You can ungroup them, as shown in Chapter 9, so that you can modify or remove only a portion of 
the background graphic.

Displaying and Hiding Background Graphics
Sometimes a background graphic can get in the way of the slide’s content. For example, on 
a slide that contains a large chart or diagram, a background graphic around the border of 
the slide can overlap the content. You don’t have to delete the background graphic entirely 
to solve this problem; you can turn it off for individual slides. To hide the background 
graphics on one or more slides, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the slide or slides to affect.
 
2. Click Design ➪ Customize ➪ Format Background. The Format Background task 
pane opens with the Fill icon selected.
 
3. Select the Hide background graphics check box. The background graphic disap-
pears from the slide. See Figure 4.21.
FIGURE 4.21
Mark the Hide background graphics check box to suppress the background graphics on the 
selected slide.
Mark this checkbox to
hide background graphics
Deselect the check box to redisplay the background graphics later as needed.

126
Part I: Building Your Presentation
If you want to hide the background graphics on all the slides that use a particular layout 
master or slide master, do the following:
 
1. Click View ➪ Master Views ➪ Slide Master to enter Slide Master view.
 
2. In the left pane, select the slide master or layout master(s) to affect.
 
3. On the Slide Master tab, mark the Hide Background Graphics check box.
Deleting Background Graphics
The background graphics reside on the slide master, so to remove one, you must use Slide 
Master view. Follow these steps:
 
1. Click View ➪ Master Views ➪ Slide Master. Slide Master view opens.
 
2. Select the slide master or layout master that contains the graphic to delete.
 
3. Click the background graphic to select it.
 
4. Press the Delete key on the keyboard.
Some background graphics are on the slide master itself, and others are on individual layout masters. The background graphics on 
the slide master trickle down to each of its layout masters, but can’t be selected/deleted from the individual layout masters.
To use a background graphic only on certain layouts, cut it from the slide master to the Clipboard (Ctrl+X), and then 
paste it individually onto each layout master desired (Ctrl+V). Alternatively, turn on the background graphic for the 
slide master and then use Hide Background Graphics on individual layout masters that should not contain it.
Adding Your Own Background Graphics
You can add your own background graphics, either to the slide master or to individual 
layout masters. This works just like adding any other graphic to a slide (see Chapter 11), 
except you add it to the master instead of to an individual slide.
Inserting pictures is covered in greater detail in Chapter 11, but here are the basic steps for 
adding a background graphic:
 
1. Display the slide master or layout master on which you want to place the back-
ground graphic.
 
2. Do any of the following:
 
■Click Insert ➪ Images ➪ Pictures. Select a picture to insert and click Insert.
 
■Click Insert ➪ Images ➪ Online Pictures. Search for a piece of clip art to use, or 
an image from another online source, and insert it on the master.
 
■In any application (including PowerPoint), copy any graphic to the Clipboard 
by pressing Ctrl+C; then display the master and paste the graphic by pressing 
Ctrl+V.

127
Chapter 4: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters
4
Most of the background graphics that come with the built-in themes are either semi-transparent or use one of the placeholder col-
ors for their fill. Therefore changing the color theme or theme variant also changes the color of the background graphic. Keep that 
in mind if you are creating your own background graphics; it’s better to use theme colors or transparency than to use fixed colors 
that might clash with a color theme that you later apply.
Working with Placeholders
Recall from earlier in this chapter that when you enter Slide Master view, one or more 
slide masters appear in the left pane, each with its own subordinate layout masters. The 
slide master and each layout master has ﬁ ve preset placeholders that you can individually 
remove or move around. Figure 4.22 points them out on a slide master with the Facet theme 
applied, but they might be in different locations in other themes:
FIGURE 4.22
Each slide master contains these placeholders (or can contain them).
Title
Text
Footer
Date
Slide number
 
■Title: The placeholder for the title on each slide
 
■Text: The main content placeholder on each slide
 
■Date: The box that displays the current date on each slide

128
Part I: Building Your Presentation
 
■Slide number: The box that displays the slide number on each slide
 
■Footer: A box that displays repeated text at the bottom of each   
Each of these elements on the slide master trickles down to the layout masters beneath 
it, so formatting, moving, or deleting one of these elements from the slide master also 
changes it on each of the layouts. 
 
 Even though the placeholders are there on the slide master and/or layout master, the Date, Slide num-
ber, and Footer placeholders do not display on the slides unless you enable them. See “Displaying the 
Date, Number, and Footer on Slides” later in this chapter to learn how.
Formatting a Placeholder
You can format the text in each of the placeholders on the slide master just like any regu-
lar text, and that formatting carries over to all slides and layouts based on it. For example, 
if you format the code in the Slide Number box with a certain font and size, it will appear 
that way on every slide that uses that slide master. You can also format the placeholder 
boxes just like any other text boxes. For example, you can add a border around the page 
number’s box, and/or ﬁ ll its background with color.
If you want to make all of the text in a heading all-caps or small-caps, use the Font dialog box. To do so, from the Home tab, click 
the dialog box launcher in the Font group and select the Small Caps or All Caps check box there.
 
See Chapters 5 and 6 to learn how to format text. See Chapter 6 for more information about formatting 
text boxes.
Moving, Deleting, or Restoring Placeholders
You can move each of the placeholders on the slide master or an individual layout master. 
For example, you might decide you want the Footer box at the top of the slide rather than 
the bottom, or that you want to center the slide number at the bottom of the slide:
 
■To move a placeholder, click it to select it and then drag its border, just as you did 
with text boxes in Chapter 3.
 
■To delete one of the placeholders on the slide master, select its box and press the 
Delete key on the keyboard. Deleting it from the slide master deletes it from all of 
the associated layouts as well. It also deletes any special formatting they had, so if 
you add them back later, you have to reformat them. 
 
■On an individual layout master, you can quickly delete and restore the Title and 
Footer placeholders by selecting or deselecting the Title and Footers check boxes on 
the Slide Master tab. The “footer” that this check box refers to is actually all three 

129
Chapter 4: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters
4
of the bottom-of-the-slide elements: the actual footer, the date box, and the slide 
number box.
 
■You can also individually delete the placeholders from a layout master, the same as 
you can on a slide master. Just select a placeholder box and press the Delete key.
 
■To restore deleted Date, Footer, or Slide Number placeholders on an individual lay-
out master, display the Slide Master tab and select the Footers check box. If any 
of the footer placeholders (Date, Footer, or Slide Number) were previously deleted, 
they reappear.
 
■To control the status for each of the placeholders on the slide master, select the 
slide master in the left pane and then click Slide Master ➪ Master Layout ➪ Master 
Layout to open the Master Layout dialog box. From there, mark the check boxes 
for the placeholders you want to display or hide and click OK. See Figure 4.23. This 
action is available only for the slide master, not for individual layout masters. 
FIGURE 4.23
Set each placeholder’s on/off status in the Master Layout dialog box.
Restored placeholders might not appear in the same spots as they did originally; you might need to move them. To 
put the placeholders back to their original locations, reapply the theme from the Themes button on the Slide Master 
tab.
Displaying the Date, Number, and Footer on Slides
Even though the placeholders for Date, Number, and Footer might appear on the slide mas-
ter, they do not appear on the actual slides in the presentation unless you enable them. 
This might seem counterintuitive at ﬁ rst, but it’s actually a beneﬁ t. PowerPoint enables 
you to turn the date, number, and footer on and off without having to delete, recreate, or 
reformat their placeholders. You can decide at the last minute whether you want them to 
display or not, and you can choose differently for different audiences and situations.
You can control all three areas from the Header and Footer dialog box. To open it, click 
Insert ➪ Text ➪ Header and Footer. Then on the Slide tab, select the check boxes for each 
of the three elements that you want to use, as shown in Figure 4.24.

130
Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 4.24
Choose which footer elements should appear on slides.
Date and Time
You can set Date and Time either to Update Automatically or to Fixed:
 
■Update Automatically pulls the current date from the computer’s clock and for-
mats it in whatever format you choose from the drop-down list. You can also select 
a language and a Calendar Type (although this is probably not an issue unless 
you are presenting in some other country than the one for which your version of 
PowerPoint was developed).
 
■Fixed prints whatever you enter in the Fixed text box. When Fixed is enabled, it 
defaults to today’s date in the mm/dd/yyyy format.
In addition to (or instead of) placing the date on each slide, you can insert an individual instance of the current date or time 
on a slide, perhaps as part of a sentence. To do so, position the insertion point inside a text box or placeholder and then click 
Insert ➪ Text ➪ Date and Time. Select the format you want from the dialog box that appears and click OK. If the insertion point 
is not in an editable text area when you click Date and Time, the Header and Footer dialog box opens instead; click Cancel, reposi-
tion the insertion point, and try again.
Slide Number
This option shows the slide number on each slide, wherever the Number placeholder is posi-
tioned. You can format the Number placeholder on the slide master with the desired font, 
size, and other text attributes.

131
Chapter 4: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters

See Chapter 5 for more on formatting.
By default, slide numbering starts with 1. You can start with some other number if you like 
by following these steps:
 
1. Close Slide Master view if it is open. To do so, click Slide Master ➪ Close ➪ Close 
Master View.
 
2. Click Design ➪ Customize ➪ Slide Size ➪ Custom Slide Size. The Slide Size dialog 
box opens.
 
3. In the Number Slides From box, increase the number to the desired starting 
number.
 
4. Click OK.
You can insert the slide number on an individual slide, either instead of or in addition to the numbering on the slide master. 
Position the insertion point, and then click Insert Text Insert Slide Number. If you are in Slide master view, this places a code on 
the slide master for the slide number that looks like this: <#>. If you are on an individual slide, it inserts the same code, but the 
code itself is hidden and the actual number appears. If the insertion point is not in an editable text area when you click Insert Slide 
Number, the Header and Footer dialog box opens instead; click Cancel, reposition the insertion point, and try again.
Footer
The footer is blank by default. Select the Footer check box, and then enter the desired text 
in the Footer box. You can then format the footer text from the slide master as you would 
any other text (see Chapter 5 for details about formatting). You can also enter the footer 
text in the Header and Footer dialog box’s Footer text box.
Don’t Show on Title Slide
This check box in the Header and Footer dialog box suppresses the date/time, page number, 
and footer on slides that use the Title Slide layout. Many people like to hide those elements 
on title slides for a cleaner look and to avoid repeated information (for example, if the cur-
rent date appears in the subtitle box on the title slide).
Customizing and Creating Layouts
In addition to customizing the slide master (including working with its preset placeholder 
boxes, as you just learned), you can fully customize the individual layout masters.
A layout master takes some of its settings from the slide master with which it is associ-
ated. For example, by default it takes its background, fonts, theme colors, and preset place-
holder positioning from the slide master. But the layout master also can be individually 

132
Part I: Building Your Presentation
customized; you can override the slide master’s choices for background, colors, and fonts, 
and you can create, modify, and delete various types of content placeholders.
Understanding Content Placeholders
You can insert seven basic types of content on a PowerPoint slide: Text, Picture, Chart, Table, 
Diagram, Media (video or sound), and Clip Art. A placeholder on a slide master or layout mas-
ter can specify one of these types of content that it will accept, or you can designate it as a 
Content placeholder, such that it will accept any of the seven types. Most of the layouts that 
PowerPoint generates automatically for its themes use the Content placeholder type because 
it offers the most ﬂ exibility. By making all placeholders Content placeholders rather than a 
speciﬁ c type, PowerPoint can get by with fewer separate layout masters because users will 
choose the desired layout based on the positioning of the placeholders, not their types.
A Content placeholder appears as a text placeholder with a small palette of icons in the 
center, one for each of the content types. Each content placeholder can hold only one type 
of content at a time, so as soon as the user types some text into the content placeholder 
or clicks one of the icons in the palette and inserts some content, the placeholder becomes 
locked into that one type of content until the content is deleted from it.
If a slide has a placeholder that contains some content (any type), selecting the placeholder and pressing Delete 
removes the content. To remove the placeholder itself from the layout, select the empty placeholder and press 
Delete. If you then want to restore the placeholder, reapply the slide layout to the slide. 
You can move and resize a placeholder on a layout master as you would any other object. 
Drag a selection handle on the frame to resize it, or drag the border of the frame (not on a 
selection handle) to move it.
 
The Content placeholders are shown in Chapter 3 in Figure 3.10. You can also see Chapter 3 for more 
on moving and resizing an object.
Adding a Custom Placeholder
You can add a custom placeholder to an individual layout master. This makes it easy to 
build your own custom layouts.
To add a custom placeholder, follow these steps:
 
1. In Slide Master view, select the layout master to affect.
 
2. On the Slide Master tab, click the bottom part of the Insert Placeholder button 
to open its menu.
 
3. Click Content to insert a generic placeholder, or click one of the specific 
content types. See Figure 4.25. The mouse pointer becomes a cross-hair.

133

FIGURE 4.25
Create a new placeholder on a slide.
 
4. Drag on the slide to draw the placeholder box of the size and position desired. 
A rectangle appears showing where the placeholder box will go. When you release 
the mouse button, the new placeholder appears on the slide.
Deleting and Restoring a Custom Placeholder
To delete a custom placeholder, select it and press the Delete key, just as you learned to do 
earlier with the preset placeholders.
The difference between custom and preset placeholders is not in the deleting, but rather in 
the restoring. You can immediately undo a deletion with Ctrl+Z, but you cannot otherwise 
restore a deleted custom placeholder from a layout master. PowerPoint retains no memory 
of the content placeholders on individual layouts. Therefore, you must recreate any content 
placeholders that you have accidentally deleted.
To restore one of the built-in layouts, copy it from another slide master. See the sections “Duplicating and Deleting Layouts” and 
“Copying Layouts Between Slide Masters” later in this chapter.

134
Part I: Building Your Presentation
Overriding the Slide Master Formatting for a Layout
You can apply formatting to a layout in almost exactly the same ways as you apply format-
ting to a regular slide or to a slide master. Only a few things are off-limits:
 
■You cannot apply a different theme to individual layouts under a common slide 
master. To use a different theme for some slides, you have to create a whole new 
slide master (covered later in this chapter).
 
■You cannot apply a different font, color, or effect theme, because these are related 
to the main theme and the slide master. If you need different fonts or colors on a 
certain layout, specify ﬁ xed font formatting for the text placeholders in that lay-
out, or specify ﬁ xed color choices for objects.
 
For more on slide masters, see the section “Managing Slide Masters” earlier in this chapter. For more on 
formatting text placeholders, see Chapter 5. For more on specifying colors for objects, see Chapter 9.
 
■You cannot delete a background graphic that is inherited from the slide master; if 
you want it only on certain layouts, delete it from the slide master, and then paste 
it individually onto each layout desired, or select Hide Background Graphics from 
certain layouts.
 
■You cannot change the slide orientation (portrait or landscape) or the slide size.
So what can you do to an individual layout, then? Plenty. You can do the following:
 
■Apply a different background.
 
■Reposition, resize, or delete preset placeholders inherited from the slide master.
 
■Apply ﬁ xed formatting to text placeholders, including different fonts, sizes, colors, 
attributes, indents, and alignment.
 
■Apply formatting using theme colors and theme fonts.
 
■Apply ﬁ xed formatting to any placeholder box, including different ﬁ ll and border 
styles and colors.
 
■Create manual text boxes and type any text you like into them. You might do this 
to include copyright notice on certain slide layouts, for example. However, keep in 
mind that such text boxes can’t be edited on the individual slides. 
 
■Insert pictures or clip art that should repeat on each slide that uses a certain 
layout.
Creating a New Layout
In addition to modifying the existing layouts, you can create your own brand-new layouts, 
deﬁ ning the exact placeholders you want. To create a new layout, follow these steps:
 
1. From Slide Master view, click the slide master with which to associate the new 
layout.

135
Chapter 4: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters
4
 
2. Click Slide Master ➪ Edit Master ➪ Insert Layout. A new layout appears. Each 
new layout you create starts with preset placeholders inherited from the slide mas-
ter for Title, Footer, Date, and Slide Number.
 
3. (Optional) Hide or delete any of the preset placeholders that you don’t want.
 
4. Insert new placeholders as needed. 
 
To insert a placeholder, see the section “Adding a Custom Placeholder” earlier in the chapter. To name 
the layout, see the next section “Renaming a Layout.”
 
5. (Optional) Name the layout. See "Renaming a Layout" later in this chapter to 
do so.
The new layout is part of the slide master, but not part of the theme. The theme is applied to the slide master, but at 
this point their relationship ends; and changes that you make to the slide master do not affect the existing theme. To 
save your custom layout(s), you have two choices: You can save the presentation as a template, or you can save the 
theme as a separate fi le. You learned about saving themes in “Managing Themes” earlier in this chapter. 
Renaming a Layout
Layout names can help you determine the purpose of a layout if it is not obvious from 
viewing its thumbnail image.
To change the name of a layout, or to assign a name to a new layout you’ve created, follow 
these steps:
 
1. In Slide Master view, right-click the layout and choose Rename Layout. The 
Rename Layout dialog box opens.
 
2. Type a new name for the layout, replacing the existing name.
 
3. Click Rename.
Duplicating and Deleting Layouts
You might want to copy a layout to get a head start on creating a new one. To copy a lay-
out, right-click the layout in Slide Master view and choose Duplicate Layout. A copy of the 
layout appears below the original.
If you are never going to use a certain layout, you might as well delete it; every layout you 
can delete makes the ﬁ le a little bit smaller. To delete a layout, right-click the layout in 
Slide Master view and choose Delete Layout.

136
Part I: Building Your Presentation
You might have a couple of layouts at the bottom of the list that employ vertical text. These are for users of Asian 
languages. They show up in the New Slide and Layout galleries on the home tab if you have certain Asian languages 
enabled on your system. Don’t delete them if you will sometimes need to create Asian-language slides.
Copying Layouts Between Slide Masters
When you create additional slide masters in the presentation, any custom layouts you’ve 
created for the existing slide masters do not carry over. You must manually copy them to 
the new slide master.
To copy a layout from one slide master to another, follow these steps:
 
1. In Slide Master view, select the layout to be copied.
 
2. Press Ctrl+C.
 
3. Select the slide master under which you want to place the copy.
 
4. Press Ctrl+V.
You can also copy layouts between slide masters in different presentations. To do so, open 
both presentation ﬁ les, and then perform the previous steps. The only difference is that 
after step 2, you must switch to the other presentation’s Slide Master view.
Managing Slide Masters
Let’s review the relationship one more time between slide masters and themes. A theme is 
a set of formatting specs (colors, fonts, and effects) that can be used in PowerPoint, Word, 
or Excel. Themes are not applied directly to slides—they are applied to slide masters, which 
govern the formatting of slides. The slide masters exist within the presentation ﬁ le itself. 
You can change them by applying different themes, but they are essentially “built in” to 
the presentation ﬁ le.
When you change to a different theme for all of the slides in the presentation, your slide 
master changes its appearance. You can tweak that appearance in Slide Master view. As 
long as all of the slides in the presentation use the same theme, you need only one slide 
master. However, if you apply a different theme to some of your slides, you need another 
slide master, because a slide master can have only one theme applied to it at a time. 
PowerPoint automatically creates the additional slide master(s) for you when you apply a 
different design to some slides but not to others.
If you later reapply a single theme to all of the slides in the presentation, you do not need 
multiple slide masters anymore, so the unused one is automatically deleted. In addition to 
all this automatic creation and deletion of slide masters, you can also manually create and 

137
Chapter 4: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters
4
delete slide masters on your own. Any slide masters that you create manually are automati-
cally preserved, even if they aren’t always in use. You must manually delete them if you 
don’t want them anymore.
In the following sections, you learn how to create and delete slide masters manually, and 
how to rename them. You also learn how to lock one of the automatically created slide mas-
ters so that PowerPoint does not delete it if it falls out of use.
Creating and Deleting Slide Masters
To create another slide master, start out in Slide Master view (of course), and then click 
Slide Master ➪ Edit Master ➪ Insert Slide Master. The new slide master appears below the 
existing slide master(s) and all its individual layout masters in the left pane of Slide Master 
view. From there, just start customizing it. You can apply a theme to it, modify its layouts 
and placeholders, and all the usual things you can do to a slide master. Another way to cre-
ate a new slide master is to duplicate an existing one. To do this, right-click the existing 
slide master and choose Duplicate Master.
To delete a slide master, select it in Slide Master view (make sure you select the slide mas-
ter itself, not just one of its layouts) and press the Delete key. If any of that slide master’s 
layouts were applied to any slides in the presentation, those slides automatically convert to 
the default slide master’s equivalent layout. If no exact layout match is found, PowerPoint 
does its best: it uses its default Title and Content layout and includes any extra content as 
orphaned items.
Renaming a Slide Master
Slide master names appear as category headings on the Layout list as you are selecting lay-
outs. For example, in Figure 4.26, the slide master names are Facet and Ion.
To rename a slide master, follow these steps:
 
1. In Slide Master view, right-click the slide master and choose Rename Master. 
The Rename Master dialog box opens.
 
2. Type a new name for the master, replacing the existing name.
 
3. Click Rename.
Preserving a Slide Master
Unless you have created the slide master yourself, it is temporary. Slide masters come and 
go as needed, as you format slides with various themes. To lock a slide master so that 
it doesn’t disappear when no slides are using it, right-click the slide master and choose 
Preserve Master, or click Slide Master ➪ Edit Master ➪ Preserve. The Preserve button on the 
Slide Master tab appears selected, indicating the slide master is preserved. To unpreserve it, 
click the Preserve button again, or right-click the slide master again and choose Preserve 
Master. See Figure 4.27.

Chapter 4: Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters

Summary
In this chapter you learned how themes and slide masters make it easy to apply consistent 
formatting in a presentation, and how layout masters are associated with slide masters 
and provide consistent layouts for the slides based on them. You learned how to create, 
edit, rename, and delete themes, masters and layouts, and how to copy themes between 
presentations.
Now that you know how to format entire presentations using themes, you’re ready to start 
learning how to make exceptions to the formatting rules that the themes impose. In the 
next chapter you will learn how to format text in PowerPoint, and apply different fonts, 
sizes, attributes, and special effects. You can use this knowledge to make strategic changes 
to the text placeholders on slide masters to further customize your themes, or you can 
make changes to text on individual slides on a case-by-case basis to make cert ain slides 
stand out from the rest.

T
 ext formatting is formatting that you can apply to individual characters of text. It includes 
font (typeface), size, attributes such as bold and underline, ﬁ ll color, and border color. 
(Formatting that affects entire paragraphs only, such as indentation or bullet style, is called 
paragraph formatting, not text formatting, and is covered in Chapter 6, “Formatting Paragraphs and 
Text Boxes.”)
As you learned in Chapter 4,“Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters,” PowerPoint automates 
text formatting by applying themes to slide masters. The slide masters then dictate the default text 
size, font, color, and attributes that should be used on slides. By applying text formatting through 
the slide masters, rather than to individual slides, you ensure consistency and make it much easier 
to make global font and text formatting changes later on.
However, you may need to change the formatting of some text. For example, the font size for titles 
on the slide master may be a bit too large; in this case, you can decrease the font size for the Title 
placeholder, and this change will apply to all of the layouts for that master. You can even save the 
changes to a new theme ﬁ le so that you can reuse the theme with the smaller title text later on.
In some cases, you might need to manually change the text formatting for an individual text box, 
or even an individual paragraph or word. For example, you may create text boxes manually that 
label the parts of a diagram; in this case, you would probably want to use a ﬁ xed font and size for 
those labels, so that they do not change if you switch themes later on.

142
Part I: Building Your Presentation
Changing the Font
There are several ways to change the font that is used in a presentation. Whenever possible, 
in order to maintain consistency, you should use the method that affects an entire slide 
master. However, in some cases, you may need to change the font in an individual text box, 
or even individual characters within the text box. Ofﬁ ce 2013 comes with a lot of different 
fonts, and you may also have acquired some additional fonts by installing other programs. 
A font is a typeface, or a style of lettering. To see an example of two different font styles, 
compare the lettering of the preceding heading to the lettering in this paragraph.
In the past, when most fonts were not scalable, a distinction was sometimes drawn between the term 
“typeface” — referring to a certain style of lettering — and the term “font” — which referred to a specifi c typeface 
used at a certain size, with a certain combination of attributes, such as bold and italic. Nowadays, however, the 
terms font and typeface are synonymous for all practical purposes.
Windows fonts are generic — that is, they work with any program. For example, a font that 
came with a desktop publishing program such as Adobe InDesign also works with Microsoft 
Word and with PowerPoint. Within PowerPoint, you have access to all of the installed 
Windows fonts on your system.
The majority of the fonts that come with Windows and Ofﬁ ce are outline fonts, which means 
that they consist of unﬁ lled, mathematically created outlines of each character. When you 
assign a size, you are sizing the outline; each outline is then ﬁ lled in with black (or what-
ever color you choose) to form each character. As a result, these fonts look good at any size. 
In terms of appearance, there are two basic groups of fonts: serif (those with little tails on 
each letter, such as the small horizontal lines at the bases of the letters i and t) and sans-
serif (those without the tails). The regular paragraph text in this book uses a serif font. The 
headings use a sans-serif font.
Choosing the Right Fonts
A font can make a tremendous difference in the readability and appeal of your presenta-
tion, so selecting the right ones is very important. But how do you choose from among all 
of the fonts that are installed on your system? Here are some general rules:
 
■Strive for consistency. (Yes, I keep harping on that, but it’s important.) You should 
avoid changing the font on an individual slide, and instead, make font changes to 
the slide master, or, in some cases, to a master layout.
 
■Whenever possible, rather than choosing a ﬁ xed font, use the (Headings) or (Body) 
placeholders at the top of the Font menu (see Figure 5.1). You can then redeﬁ ne 

143
Chapter 5: Formatting Text
5
those placeholders using a font theme. This makes it much easier to change the 
fonts for the entire presentation later on.
 
For more on font themes, see Chapter 4.
FIGURE 5.1
Fonts appear on the Fonts list on the Home tab.
 
■Try to use a sans-serif font for the “Headings” font, because sans-serif is easier to 
read at large sizes.
 
■Some people recommend using serif fonts for the body if the presentation is very 
text-heavy, because serif fonts are easier to read in long paragraphs (such as in this 
book) However, for on-screen presentations, sans-serif is more accessible. See this 
article for details about fonts and accessibility: http://webaim.org
/techniques/fonts/#screenfonts. 

144
Part I: Building Your Presentation
 
■Avoid serif fonts for tiny text, because the serifs tend to break up on-screen at 
small sizes.
 
■Avoid script fonts in presentations, because they are hard to read.
 
■Avoid novelty fonts, because they take the focus away from your message.
Another consideration when choosing fonts is whether the PC on which you present the 
show is likely to have the same fonts installed. If you stick with Windows-supplied fonts 
such as Arial and Times New Roman, which are available in Windows XP and newer versions, 
this is a non-issue. However, if you use a font that came with Ofﬁ ce 2007 and later only, 
such as Calibri or Cambria, but you plan to present on a PC that uses Ofﬁ ce 2003 or earlier, 
then you might want to embed the fonts in the presentation when you are saving it. If you 
present or edit the show on a PC that does not have the right fonts, and the fonts are not 
embedded, then PowerPoint will use fonts that are as close as possible to a match. Although 
this is helpful, it can also cause strange and unexpected line breaks in your text.
When you install the free Compatibility Pack in PowerPoint 2003 or earlier, it not only enables you to open PowerPoint 2007 and 
later files, but it also installs the fonts introduced in PowerPoint 2007 such as Calibri.
To embed fonts when saving the presentation, choose Tools ➪ Save Options in the Save As dialog box. Select the Embed Fonts in 
the File check box, and click OK.
If you end up on the other side of that equation and are stuck with a presentation that uses fonts that your system 
doesn’t have, use Replace Fonts to replace all instances of the missing font with one that is available on your PC. See 
“Replacing Fonts” later in this chapter.
Changing the Font Theme
Choosing a different font theme is covered in Chapter 4 because of the connection between 
themes and fonts, but let’s have another look at it here in the context of font formatting. 
A font theme is a speciﬁ cation that names two fonts: one for headings (titles) and one for 
body text (everything else). Font themes apply to all text that uses the font placeholders 
rather than a ﬁ xed font. To switch to a different font theme, follow these steps:
 
1. Switch to Slide Master view (View ➪ Slide Master).
 
2. If you have more than one slide master in this presentation, click the slide 
master you want to affect.
Any of that slide master’s layout masters can be selected in the left pane; you do not have to select the slide master 
thumbnail itself in order to apply the font theme change to all layouts in that slide master.

145
Chapter 5: Formatting Text
5
 
3. Click Slide Master ➪ Background ➪ Fonts. The Fonts menu opens to display sam-
ples of the available font themes. These include both built-in font themes and any 
custom themes that you’ve created.
 
4. Hover the mouse pointer over a theme to see it previewed on the master 
behind the open menu.
 
5. Click the font theme that you want to apply.
 
6. Click Slide Master ➪ Close ➪ Close Master View to exit from Slide Master view. 
 
To create your own custom font themes, see Chapter 4.
You have to be in Slide Master view to change the font theme because the Slide Master tab is the only place you can 
access the Font Theme button. However, if you add that button to the Quick Access toolbar, you can access it from 
Normal view too.
Applying a Fixed Font
If you apply a speciﬁ c font to some text, that text will no longer use the font that is speci-
ﬁ ed by the font theme. That font will not change when you change the presentation’s over-
all font theme or when you change to a different overall theme.
If this is what you want, then you have two ways to apply a speciﬁ c font: from the Home 
tab or from the mini toolbar.
To apply a font from the Home tab, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the text to be formatted. It can be on a slide master (most preferable for 
consistency’s sake), on a layout master, or on an individual slide.
 
2. On the Home tab, in the Font group, open the Font drop-down list (Figure 5.1).
 
3. Point to a font other than the ones designated (Headings) and (Body). The 
selected text is previewed in that font.
 
4. Click the font that you want. PowerPoint applies the font to the text.
If you want to return to using the theme fonts, select the “Headings” or the “Body” font 
from the top of the menu.
The mini toolbar is just what it sounds like — a small toolbar. It appears above and to the 
right of selected text. When the mouse pointer is directly on top of the selected text, 
the mini toolbar appears dimmed, but if you move your mouse up to the mini toolbar, it 
becomes fully visible.

146
Part I: Building Your Presentation
To apply a font from the mini toolbar, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the text to be formatted. It can be on a slide master (most preferable), on a 
layout master, or on an individual slide.
 
2. Hover the mouse pointer over the selection so that the mini toolbar appears, as 
shown in Figure 5.2. If it does not appear, right-click the selection.
FIGURE 5.2
Use the mini toolbar to apply a font.
 
3. On the mini toolbar, open the Font drop-down list.
 
4. Point to a font other than the ones marked (Headings) or (Body). The selected 
text is previewed in that font.
 
5. Click the font that you want. PowerPoint applies the font to the text.
Using the Font Dialog Box
The Font dialog box (shown in Figure 5.3) provides a third way of changing the font. It also 
gives you access to the controls for setting font size, color, and attributes, all of which you 
will learn about later in this chapter.
To open the Font dialog box, click the dialog launcher in the Font group on the Home tab. 
Then make your selections in the dialog box, just as you would from the Home tab’s Font 
group. Notice in Figure 5.3 that the Font drop-down list is labeled Latin Text Font. In this 
case, “Latin” just means regular text characters.
Replacing Fonts
If you restrain yourself from using a lot of manual text formatting, and rely on the theme 
to control the way the text appears, you should not have a problem with inconsistent font 
usage. Whenever you need to make a change, you can do it once on the slide master and be 
done with it.

147
Chapter 5: Formatting Text
5
FIGURE 5.3
The Font dialog box provides access to many different text-formatting controls, as well as the 
font list.
However, not everyone can be counted on to show such discipline and good design sense 
as you. Suppose your coworker created a long presentation in which he sporadically applied 
a certain font for some special elements. Now you need to work on that presentation, but 
you don’t have that font. You will need to go through and hunt for all instances of that font 
and change them to some other font. Fortunately, PowerPoint has a Replace Fonts feature 
that can help you to ﬁ nd all of these instances. Follow these steps:
 
1. On the Home tab, click the down arrow for the Replace button and choose 
Replace Fonts. The Replace Font dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5.4.
FIGURE 5.4
Replace all instances of one font with another.
 
2. In the Replace drop-down list, select the font that you want to replace. Only 
the fonts that are currently in use in the presentation appear on this list, and so 
it’s easy to navigate.
 
3. In the With drop-down list, select the desired replacement font. All of the 
available fonts on your system appear here.
 
4. Click Replace. All of the instances of that font are replaced.
 
5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 to replace another font, or click Close when you’re finished.

148
Part I: Building Your Presentation
Replacing the theme fonts makes the placeholders no longer respond to font theme changes. You have to reset the 
slide master by reapplying the Headings or Body fonts to the placeholders if you “un-theme” them using Replace 
Fonts.
Changing the Font Size
Each theme has a speciﬁ ed font size that it uses for titles and for body text, with different 
sizes typically used for different levels of bulleted lists. You can use the default settings, or 
you can edit the placeholders on the slide master to change them. In some cases, you might 
also need to change the size of an individual block of text on an individual slide.
As you learned at the end of Chapter 3, PowerPoint has an AutoFit or Resize Shape feature that you can turn on or 
off for each text box. When enabled, AutoFit permits the text size to shrink so that the text fi ts into the text box, or 
Resize Shape to Fit Text permits the text box to grow so that the text fi ts at its current size. However, AutoFit does not 
change the text’s font size as applied by the Font Size setting; if you enlarge the text box, the text goes back to its 
regular size. 
Choosing the Right Sizes
The size of the text is just as important as the font. If the text is too large, it looks unat-
tractive and amateurish, but if it’s too small, the people in the back row won’t be able to 
follow along.
Font size is measured in points, and each point measures 1/72 of an inch when printed. 
However, PowerPoint slides are usually shown on a screen rather than in print, and so 
the appropriate font size depends mainly upon the presentation medium. For example, a 
72-point letter on a 15-inch monitor is very different than a 72-point letter on a 12-foot 
projection screen.
The default sizes that are speciﬁ ed in the built-in themes provide you with a good starting 
point. You can increase or decrease the sizes on the slide masters as necessary. Here are 
some things to consider when choosing font size:
 
■The farther away the audience will be sitting from the slides, and the smaller the 
display screen, the larger the text should be.
 
■Very thick and very thin letters are harder to read at small sizes. A font of moder-
ate thickness is most readable.
 
■Very tight spacing can make thick letters difﬁ cult to read; on the other hand, very 
loose spacing can emphasize the individual letters to the point where the words 

149
Chapter 5: Formatting Text
5
they comprise are not as obvious. See the section “Adjusting Character Spacing” 
later in this chapter.
 
■If any of your slide titles are so long that they wrap to an additional line within 
the title placeholder box, consider slightly decreasing the font size for the title 
placeholder on the slide master so that the wrapping doesn’t occur. Make your 
changes to the slide master — not the individual slide on which the problem 
occurs. This is because audiences ﬁ nd it jarring when the slide title is not in the 
same place or not the same size on every slide.
Specifying a Font Size
The Font Size drop-down list, shown in Figure 5.5, is on the Home tab and is actually also 
an input box. You can click it and type a font size directly into the text box, or you can 
open the drop-down list and select a value. Typing your own value is useful if the size that 
you want doesn’t appear on the list. At the smaller sizes, the list increments by one point, 
but at the larger sizes, it makes bigger jumps, and so not all values are available.
FIGURE 5.5
Select a font size from the drop-down list, or click in the Font Size text box and type a value.
Increase Size
Decrease Size

150
Part I: Building Your Presentation
The same Font Size drop-down list is also available in the mini toolbar and in the Font dialog box.
As a shortcut, you can also use the Increase Font and Decrease Font buttons, which are 
available both on the Home Ribbon and on the mini toolbar. They are shown in Figure 
5.5, and they increase or decrease the font size by one position on the Font Size list. (As 
noted earlier, for the smaller sizes, the increment occurs at one point at a time, but for 
larger sizes there is more of a jump between sizes.) You can also use the following keyboard 
shortcuts:
 
■Increase Font: Ctrl+Shift+>
 
■Decrease Font: Ctrl+Shift+<
Adjusting Character Spacing
Character spacing is the amount of blank space between individual letters. You can adjust 
this spacing to make more or less text ﬁ ll a text box. Character spacing can affect the 
appearance and readability of both titles and body text, and Figure 5.6 shows examples of 
the various character spacing presets that are available with examples of how it affects 
your text.
FIGURE 5.6
Character spacing, which you set from the Home tab, affects the appearance and readability 
of your text.

151
Chapter 5: Formatting Text

To adjust character spacing, select the text and then choose a setting from the Character 
Spacing drop-down menu on the Home tab.
To set custom spacing, choose More Spacing from the drop-down menu. This opens the Font 
dialog box to the Character Spacing tab, as shown in Figure 5.7.
FIGURE 5.7
Adjust character spacing and kerning using custom settings in the Font dialog box.
To set custom spacing, choose either Expanded or Condensed from the Spacing list, and 
then enter a number of points by which to expand or condense. As a point of reference, 
Table 5.1 lists the presets from Figure 5.6 and their expand/condense values; use these as a 
basis for ﬁ ne-tuning.

Spacing Presets

Custom Spacing Equivalent

Condense by 3 points
Tight
Condense by 1.5 points
Normal
Normal

You can also adjust kerning in the Font dialog box. Kerning decreases the amount of 
space between two letters, based upon their shapes. For example, when capital letters A 
and V appear next to each other, you can reduce the space between them without them 

152
Part I: Building Your Presentation
overlapping because of their shapes. Kerning takes the shapes of the letters into account as 
it selectively tightens the spacing. Kerning looks best when you apply it to large text, and 
so the Kerning for Fonts setting enables you to specify a minimum font size below which 
text is not kerned, as shown in Figure 5.7.
Changing Font Color/Text Fill
To set the font color for individually selected text, use the Font Color button on the Home 
tab, or use the Text Fill button on the Drawing Tools Format tab in the WordArt Styles 
group. Why are there two buttons that do the same thing? Well, they don’t do exactly the 
same thing. The Font Color button on the Home tab applies only simple, solid-color format-
ting, and is available even in legacy presentations (that is, presentations in PowerPoint 
97-2003 format). The Text Fill button on the Drawing Tools Format tab has a wider array of 
ﬁ ll options, including gradients, textures, and even picture ﬁ lls. It is available only in a 
PowerPoint 2007 or later presentation. Figure 5.8 shows these two buttons and their menus.
FIGURE 5.8
The Font Color button (left) and the Text Fill button (right) can both apply solid-color 
formatting, but only the Text Fill button can apply special fi ll effects.
The Eyedropper command on the menus in Figure 5.8 enables you to pick up any color on any object in the presen-
tation. When you choose it, the mouse pointer becomes an eyedropper graphic, with a square fl oating nearby it. 
Hover the eyedropper over an object so that the desired color appears in the square, and then click. You can use the 
Eyedropper tool for text, drawn objects, text box backgrounds, and just about anything else to which you can assign a 
color in PowerPoint. 

153
Chapter 5: Formatting Text
5
For text color and ﬁ ll, as with the colors of all objects, it is usually best to stick with the 
theme color placeholders rather than using ﬁ xed colors. This way, if you want to change 
the color theme or the overall theme later on, the colors will automatically update. This 
doesn’t necessarily mean that you have to forego special ﬁ ll effects; you just have to base 
them on theme colors. For example, if you’re creating a gradient effect, you should use two 
theme colors for the gradient.
 
 For more on color placeholders, see Chapter 4. For more on special fi ll effects, see Chapter 9.
Applying a Text Outline
PowerPoint 2013 can apply graphics-like formatting to any text. For example, you can apply 
outlines to text, just as you can apply borders to drawn shapes, text boxes, or other objects. 
Figure 5.9 shows some text with an outline.
FIGURE 5.9
You can apply borders to regular text.
By default, text has no outline. To apply an outline, select the text and then choose a color 
from the Text Outline button in the WordArt Styles group on the Drawing Tools Format 
tab. You can choose either a theme color or a standard (ﬁ xed) color. You can also choose an 
outline weight from the Weight submenu, as shown in Figure 5.10. Chapter 9 covers object 
outlines (borders) in more detail.
You can also apply dashes to the text outline, although this is usually not a good idea for text. Dashes are more suit-
able for the borders of larger objects.
Applying Text Attributes
Text attributes are modiﬁ ers that you apply to the text, such as bold, italics, underline, 
strikethrough, shadow, and so on. PowerPoint offers several attributes, as shown in 
Figure 5.11.

154
Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 5.10
You can apply a text outline color, as well as a different line thickness, or weight.
FIGURE 5.11
Text attributes that are available in PowerPoint 2013.
There are actually several types of text attributes, and they can be divided into the follow-
ing major groups:

155
Chapter 5: Formatting Text
5
 
■Bold and italic are actually considered font styles. You can apply one of these four 
styles to your text: Regular, Bold, Italic, or Bold Italic. In some fonts, each of these 
styles is formed with a separate character set that is embedded in the font ﬁ le, and 
the letters are actually different shapes. However, in other fonts, bold is simulated 
by making each character a little thicker, and italics are simulated by tilting each 
character to the right. Figure 5.12 shows the difference between these font types.
FIGURE 5.12
Some fonts use different character sets for bold and italic, while others do not.
Bold characters are thicker in
some spots but not in others
Italic characters are a different
shape from regular characters
Italic characters are tilted
but shaped the same
Bold characters are thicker
versions of regular characters
 
■Some attributes apply an effect on top of — or in addition to — the text. These 
include underlining, strikethrough, and double strikethrough.
 
■Superscript and Subscript attributes are used for setting off symbols and numbers 
for footnotes, chemical notations, exponents, and so on. They raise or lower the 
affected text and also shrink it by about 30 percent (this is the default setting, 
although you can also customize the percentage).
 
■Shadow formatting takes two forms. If you apply it with the button in the Font 
group, then it is available in all presentations, even legacy ones, and it simply 
places a slightly offset gray copy behind the characters. You can also apply shadow 
formatting from the WordArt Styles group to create different types of shadows.
 
■All Caps formatting appears to change lowercase letters to their uppercase equiva-
lents. However, they are not really uppercase; they’re just formatted this way. 
Removing the All Caps attribute returns the text to its normal appearance.
 
■Small Caps formatting is similar to All Caps except that letters that are normally 
lowercase appear slightly smaller than letters that were already uppercase to begin 
with.

156
Part I: Building Your Presentation
Small Caps formatting was not available in versions of PowerPoint prior to 2007, and if you save the presentation in 
PowerPoint 97-2003 format and open it in an earlier version, the Small Caps attribute is removed.
 
■Equalize Character Height formatting forces each letter to be the full height that is 
allotted for capital letters. This distorts the letters and is most useful when work-
ing with shaped WordArt text (which is covered later in this chapter).
As shown in Figure 5.13, the ﬁ ve most popular text attributes appear as toggle buttons in the 
Font group on the Home tab. They are Bold, Italic, Underline, Shadow, and Strikethrough.
FIGURE 5.13
Use the Font group’s buttons for these fi ve attributes.
Bold
Italic

The other attributes are available in the Font dialog box. You can access them by following 
these steps:
 
1. On the Home tab, click the dialog box launcher in the Font group. The Font dia-
log box opens, as shown in Figure 5.14.
 
2. In the Font Style drop-down list, choose the combination of bold and italic that 
you want: Regular, Bold, Italic, or Bold and Italic.
 
3. Choose a text color from the Font Color drop-down list. (You learned about font 
color earlier in this chapter.)
 
4. If you want underlined text, choose an Underline Style from the drop-down 
list. The default color for an underline is the same as the color of the text; if you 
want a different color, you can choose it from the Underline Color drop-down list.
 
5. In the Effects section, select or deselect the check boxes for any attributes that 
you want. Some of these attributes are mutually exclusive, and so one is deselected 
when you select the other: 
 
■Strikethrough and Double-strikethrough
 
■Superscript and Subscript
 
■All Caps and Small Caps
 
6. Click OK to apply your choices.

Changing Text Case
Each character has a numeric value stored in the presentation ﬁ le, and uppercase character 
numbers are completely different from their lowercase counterparts. For example, a capital 
B is not just formatted differently from a lowercase b — it is a different character.
As you learned in the preceding section, you can apply the All Caps attribute to some 
text to force it to appear in all uppercase format, but this is just an illusion. The identify-
ing numbers for the characters have not changed; they’re just wearing a mask. When you 
remove the attribute, the characters go back to the way they normally look.
If you want to really change the case of some text, including changing the numeric identi-
ﬁ ers for the characters behind the scenes, then you must either retype the text or use the 
Change Case feature. You can access the Change Case attribute in the Font group on the 
Home tab, as shown in Figure 5.15. Change Case enables you to set a block of text to any of 
the following settings:
 
■Sentence case. Capitalizes the ﬁ rst letter of the ﬁ rst word in the sentence, and the 
ﬁ rst letter of the ﬁ rst word after a sentence-ending punctuation mark such as a 
period.
 
■Lowercase. Converts all characters to lowercase that are not already so. (It does 
not do anything to numbers or symbols.)
 
■Uppercase. Converts all characters to uppercase that are not already so. (It does 
not do anything to numbers or symbols.)

158
Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 5.15
Change the case of the selected text by selecting a Change Case option from the menu.
 
■Capitalize each word. Capitalizes the ﬁ rst letter of each word.
 
■Toggle case. Reverses the case of every letter. For example, it would change 
“Smith” to “sMITH.”
When you use the Change Case attribute, the text retains no memory of its previous capi-
talization state. For example, if you used the Capitalize Each Word option on the word 
PowerPoint, it would convert to Powerpoint. If you wanted to re-capitalize the middle 
P, then you would have to manually retype it (or select only that P and choose Change 
Case ➪ Uppercase).
Most style guides dictate that you should capitalize all important words in titles, but not every word. For example, in the title “The 
Best of the Best,” you do not capitalize the words “of” and “the.” Unfortunately, the Capitalize Each Word option in PowerPoint 
cannot make that distinction for you, and so you must make those changes manually. However, Microsoft Word’s grammar checker 
does identify and fix these capitalization errors. If you have a long, text-heavy presentation, you might find it worthwhile to export 
the text to Word, perform a grammar check, and then re-import it.
Applying WordArt Styles
WordArt enables you to apply formatting features to text that would normally be used only 
with graphics, such as special ﬁ lls, outlines, glows, reﬂ ections, and other special effects. 
It’s pretty amazing stuff, as you’ll see in the following sections.
Up until PowerPoint 2007, WordArt had always been a rather compartmentalized specialty 
feature. However, in PowerPoint 2007 and later, you can apply WordArt Styles to all text. 

159
Chapter 5: Formatting Text
5
There is no distinction between WordArt and regular text, and so you do not have to choose 
between cool special effects and including text in the outline and spell checks.
A WordArt Style is a preset combination of ﬁ ll color, outline color, and text effects. WordArt 
Styles are built into PowerPoint — you can’t customize them or add to them. However, you 
can apply one and then make changes to it.
 
For more on text effects, see the section “Applying Text Effects.”
To apply a WordArt Style, follow these steps:
 
1. (Optional) To make the style apply to certain text, select that text.
 
2. In the WordArt Styles group on the Drawing Tools Format tab, click the More 
button to open the gallery. A gallery of WordArt presets appears. See Figure 5.16.
FIGURE 5.16
Select a WordArt Style.
 
3. Hover the mouse pointer over the styles to preview them on the text on the 
slide.
 
4. Click the desired style to apply it. 
To remove a previous WordArt effect, open the WordArt Styles gallery again and choose 
Clear WordArt.
If you choose a WordArt style that is supposed to apply only to the selected text, but you 
have not selected any text, then PowerPoint applies it to the word at the insertion point’s 
location. The insertion point can be at the beginning of the word or anywhere within it, 
but not following the word. If the insertion point follows a word, PowerPoint tries to apply 
the style to text that is to the right of the word. If this is a blank space, the style applies 
to the blank space and the change is not apparent.

Part I: Building Your Presentation
WordArt effects are not available when working in Compatibility mode (that is, on a PowerPoint 97-2003 format pre-
sentation). When you save a presentation in PowerPoint 97-2003 format, any text box that contains text with WordArt 
formatting applied is converted to a graphic that you cannot edit. If you need to edit the text in PowerPoint 2003 or 
earlier, make sure that you remove the WordArt effects before saving in that format.
Applying Text Effects
The text effects that you apply using the Text Effects button in the WordArt Styles 
group — Shadow, Reﬂ ection, Glow, Bevel, 3-D Rotation, and Transform — are similar to 
regular attributes such as bold, italic, and underline, in that they apply modiﬁ ers to the 
basic text to produce some special appearance. However, this chapter looks at these effects 
separately because they are part of the WordArt functionality.
When working with text for presentations that need to be backward-compatible with PowerPoint 2003 and earlier, 
stick with the effects that you can access from the Font group.
All of these effects, except for Transform, are also available for formatting graphics objects 
such as drawn shapes, SmartArt, and charts.
 
To customize and fi ne-tune each of these text effects, see Chapter 9.
Shadow
There are two ways to apply a shadow — one is available in all PowerPoint presentation 
versions, and the other is available only in PowerPoint 2007 and later presentations. 
The Shadow button on the Home tab (in the Font group) applies a default shadow to any 
text, and you can use it even in a backward-compatible presentation. Its shadow appears 
slightly below and to the right of the text, and the shadow color is automatically based on 
the background color.
For more ﬂ exibility, click Drawing Tools Format ➪ WordArt Styles ➪ Text Effects ➪ Shadow 
to open a gallery of shadow presets. These presets are divided into categories, including 
Outer (the default type), Inner, and Perspective, as shown in Figure 5.17. You can scroll 
down in the gallery to access more presets.

You can also customize the shadow by choosing Shadow Options, which opens the Format 
Shape task pane with the Text Effects options displayed and the Shadow category 
expanded. You can then ﬁ ne-tune the shadow by changing its color, transparency, size, and 
so on.
 
Chapter 9 looks at each of the shadow settings available in the Format Shape task pane in detail.

Refl ection
Reflection creates a partial mirror image of the text beneath the original, making it appear 
as if it were looking into a reﬂ ecting pool. Figure 5.18 illustrates the effect.
Choose a reﬂ ection preset from the Reﬂ ection submenu of the Text Effects menu, as shown 
in Figure 5.18.
To remove the reﬂ ection effect, choose No Reﬂ ection from the top of the gallery menu.
FIGURE 5.18
Select a refl ection preset to apply a Refl ection effect to text.
You can also choose Reﬂ ection Options to open the Reﬂ ection options in the Format Shape 
task pane, from which you can ﬁ ne-tune any of the following (see Figure 5.19):
 
■Transparency. The extent to which anything behind the text shows through the 
reﬂ ection
 
■Size. The size of the reﬂ ection

163

■Distance. The distance between the reﬂ ection and the text or object being 
reﬂ ected
 
■Blur. The sharpness or blurriness of the reﬂ ection effect
FIGURE 5.19

Glow
Glow appears as a soft halo effect around the text. You can choose from four levels of thick-
ness for the glow, as well as any glow color. Figure 5.20 shows a glow effect.
You can choose a glow preset from the Glow submenu of the Text Effects menu. You must 
ﬁ rst select the level that you want by clicking one of the presets in the gallery, as shown 
in Figure 5.20. The presets use the colors in the current theme. Then, if you cannot ﬁ nd the 
desired color, you can reopen the submenu and choose More Glow Colors. You can then click 
the color that you want from the color picker. Keep in mind, though, that if you use one of 
the other colors, and then change the colors in the presentation, the object won’t change 
color. To remove the glow, choose No Glow from the top of the gallery menu.

164
Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 5.20
You can select a glow preset, as well as a different color.
You can also choose Glow Options to open the Glow settings in the Format Shape task pane, 
from which you can specify the following (see Figure 5.21):
 
■Presets. Choosing a preset from this list is the same as choosing one from the Glow 
submenu in Figure 5.20.
 
■Color. Sets the color of the glow.
 
■Size. Sets the size of the glow around the text or object.
 
■Transparency. Determines the extent to which whatever is behind the glow shows 
through.
The Soft Edges option applies only to shapes, not to text, so those options are grayed out 
(unavailable) in the Format Shape task pane when text is selected.
Bevel (3-D format)
A bevel is a slanting, curving, or rounding off of the edges of an object. It is not a very 
obvious effect when applied to most text, and so it’s mostly for larger, drawn objects and 

165
Chapter 5: Formatting Text
5
pieces of charts and diagrams. However, on large, thick letters in light colors, beveling is 
sometimes useful to create a raised or textured effect. For example, in Figure 5.22, a bevel 
effect adds a raised appearance to the letters.
FIGURE 5.21
Fine-tune the glow in the Format Shape task pane.
Bevel effects are not easily visible at the default zoom in Normal view. To really see the bevel effect, zoom in on the 
letters to at least 300 percent. Bevels work well with light or bright-colored text; they are not usually visible with 
black text.
Choose a bevel preset from the Bevel submenu of the Text Effects menu, as shown in 
Figure 5.22.
Beveling is a subset of a larger category of formatting known as 3-D. With 3-D, you can 
apply not only bevels to the edges, but also depth, contours, and surface effects. The 3-D 
effects are not as effective with text as with other types of objects because text is rela-
tively small and thin, and the effects are not readily visible.

166
Part I: Building Your Presentation
 
For more on depth, contours, and surface effects, see Chapter 9.
FIGURE 5.22
You can select a bevel preset and add depth or texture to text.
To ﬁ ne-tune the bevel effect, select 3-D Options from the bottom of the Bevel submenu. The 
Format Shape task pane opens with the 3-D Format settings displayed, as shown in Figure 
5.23. From here you can adjust the width and height of the top and bottom bevel effect (in 
points), and you can also experiment with the colors and sizes of the depth and contour 
settings, as well as the 3-D lighting and surface effects.
The Contour section governs the outline that appears around the text when you apply beveling. If you do not want the beveled text 
to have an outline, set the Size to 0 points in the Contour section, as shown in Figure 5.23.

167
Chapter 5: Formatting Text

FIGURE 5.23
Fine-tune the bevel settings in the Format Text Shape task pane.
The Depth setting in the 3-D Format settings controls the length of the 3-D effect that is 
applied to the text. It doesn’t do anything until you apply a Rotation setting, which is 
covered in the next section. However, when you rotate the text, it shows “sides” according 
to its depth setting. For example, in Figure 5.24, the text has a ﬁ ve-degree X rotation and a 
depth of 60 points.
FIGURE 5.24
The Depth setting sets the length of the sides of the text. These sides are visible only when 
you apply a rotation to the text.

168
Part I: Building Your Presentation
3-D Rotation
The 3-D Rotation effect slants, tilts, or otherwise manipulates the text so that it looks as 
if it is being viewed at an angle. You can slant and tilt the letters themselves, as shown in 
Figure 5.25.
FIGURE 5.25
The 3-D rotation effect makes text appear to tilt, slant, and rotate.
There are four factors that make up a 3-D rotation setting:
 
■X. Left-to-right rotation
 
■Y. Top-to-bottom rotation
 
■Z. Rotation around a center point
 
■Perspective. The height at which you are viewing (above or below)
The 3-D rotation presets combine these factors to create commonly used effects. Select a 
rotation preset from the 3-D Rotation submenu of the Text Effects menu, as shown in 
Figure 5.26.
To adjust each of the four factors separately, choose 3-D Rotation Options from the bottom 
of the submenu and set the angles for each factor in the Format Text Effects dialog box. 
By combining them with the 3-D Format settings in that same dialog box, you can create 
almost any effect that you want.
 
For more on the various rotation settings, see Chapter 9.

Choose a 3-D rotation preset.
Transform
Transform settings are just for text and are not available for graphic objects such as drawn 
shapes. You can think of transformations — which were called WordArt Shapes in some 
earlier versions of PowerPoint — as “molds” into which you squeeze text in order to change 
its shape. Figure 5.27 shows some examples of various transformations that are not rotated. 
However, you can combine a transformation with 3-D rotation to create some even more 
unusual effects.

170
Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 5.27
Some examples of transformation effects.
Applying a Transformation
There are two categories of transformation: Follow Path and Warp. Follow Path is the “tra-
ditional” type of WordArt transformation, squeezing the text into various shapes. Follow 
Path does not reshape the text itself, but makes the characters hug a curved path. The 
bottom-right example in Figure 5.27 is a Follow Path effect; the others are Warp effects.
To apply a transformation effect, select it from the Transform submenu of the Text Effects 
menu, as shown in Figure 5.28. To remove a transformation effect, choose No Transform.
Modifying a Transformation
After applying a transformation, you might be able to modify its shape somewhat, depend-
ing on the transformation that you have chosen. Once you select the Transform setting, 
look for a purple square in the WordArt text. Figure 5.29 shows an example. You can drag 
this square to reshape the effect, making it more or less dramatic. You can drag the purple 
square in the center of the WordArt to stretch or compress the center. Lines appear as you 
drag to show the new position.
You can also rotate the WordArt by dragging the circular arrow graphic at the top. This works just like rotating any 
other object and is covered in Chapter 9.
Tips for Using the Follow Path Transformations
The Follow Path transformations are a bit different from the Warp transformations, and so 
it might not be obvious how to manipulate them. Here are some tips:

171
Chapter 5: Formatting Text

■If the text seems to follow the path in a lopsided manner (especially common with 
short text phrases), set the text’s horizontal alignment to Center. To do this, use 
the Center button in the Paragraph group on the Home tab.
 
For more on text alignment, see Chapter 6.
FIGURE 5.28
Choose a transformation effect.
 
■The third Follow Path transformation (Circle) makes text appear in a circle. Where 
it starts depends on the horizontal alignment setting for the text. You can set hori-
zontal alignment using the buttons in the Paragraph group on the Home tab. If you 
set the text to be left-aligned, it starts at the left; if you center the text, the text 

172
Part I: Building Your Presentation
bends around the right side as a center point. If you use right alignment, the text 
starts upside-down.
FIGURE 5.29
Modify the shape of the transformation effect by dragging a purple square.
Drag purple square
 
■The fourth Follow Path transformation (Button) makes text appear above a center 
line, on a center line, and then below a center line. To indicate what text should 
appear where, press Enter to insert paragraph breaks between the text segments.
Copying Formatting with Format Painter
Once you have formatted text exactly the way you want it, you might want to copy it to 
other blocks of text. To do this, you can use the Format Painter tool. Format Painter picks 
up the formatting of any object (including text) and “paints” it onto other objects.
To use Format Painter, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the text or other object whose formatting you want to copy.
 
2. Click Home ➪ Clipboard ➪ Format Painter, as shown in Figure 5.30. The mouse 
pointer changes to a paintbrush. If you want to copy the formatting onto more 
than one object or section of text, double-click the Format Painter icon instead of 
just clicking it. 
 
3. Click the object, or drag across the text, to which you want to apply the 
formatting.
 
4. (Optional) If you double-clicked the Format Painter icon in step 2, Format 
Painter is still enabled; click additional objects to apply the formatting. Press 
Esc to cancel the Format Painter when you are ﬁ nished.
To clear the formatting from a block of text, click the Home ➪ Font ➪ Clear All Formatting.

Inserting Symbols
Occasionally you might need to insert a character that doesn’t appear on your keyboard, 
such as a copyright© or™ trademark symbol, or a letter with an accent mark over it. You 
can easily insert these symbols by using the Symbol dialog box.
Follow these steps to insert a symbol:
 
1. Choose Insert ➪ Symbols ➪ Symbol. The Symbol dialog box opens, as shown in 
Figure 5.31.

symbol should be selected. The default is normal text, which displays the symbols 
from the font currently in use.
 
3. Click the symbol you want to insert.
 
4. Click Insert.
 
5. Click Close.
Inserting Math Equations
Math has its own language, complete with special symbols and syntax, and even special 
types of line breaks, dividers, and superscript/subscript requirements. It’s no wonder, 
then, that most text-editing programs are inadequate for expressing complex mathematical 
equations.
PowerPoint 2013 includes the same robust Equation Editor utility that is in Microsoft Word; 
you can use it to construct and format any equation you need. This makes PowerPoint use-
ful for math classes, for example, and for scientiﬁ c and technical presentations.
Inserting a Preset Equation
In algebra and trigonometry, certain equations are used frequently, such as the 
Pythagorean Theorem and the quadratic formula. Instead of re-creating them each time 
you need them, you can insert them as a preset equation from Word.
Follow these steps to insert an equation preset:
 
1. Click in a text box.
 
2. On the Insert tab, click the down arrow below the Equation button to open its 
gallery.
 
3. Click one of the presets.
Creating a New Equation
If none of the presets match your needs, create a new, blank equation object instead by 
clicking the Equation button (click its face, not its down arrow). The Equation Tools Design 
tab appears, and Type equation here appears in the text box, showing where to begin typing 
your equation. See Figure 5.32.
To create a simple equation, just start typing it in the equation frame. You can use any 
number, letter, or symbol from the keyboard. You can also select from a wide variety of 
math symbols in the Symbols group on the Equation Tools Design tab.

Depending on the equation, you may need one or more structures. Structures are symbols 
and/or combinations of text placeholder boxes that help you create math expressions that 
could not be easily expressed on a single line of text.
A stacked fraction is one of the simplest and most common examples. It consists of two 
placeholder boxes, one on top of the other, with a horizontal line between them (see 
Figure 5.34).
FIGURE 5.34
Structures contain one or more placeholder boxes.
Follow these steps to insert and ﬁ ll a structure:
 
1. In the equation, position the insertion point where you want the structure to 
be inserted.
 
2. On the Equation Tools Design tab, click one of the buttons in the Structures 
group to open its menu. For example, click the Fractions button.
 
3. Click on the desired structure to insert it.
 
4. Click in a placeholder and type or insert the content. Repeat this for each 
placeholder.
Structures can be nested. You can place one structure inside the placeholder box for another structure, creating complex nests of 
structures and equations.
Follow these steps to insert a simple subscript box into an equation:
 
1. In the equation, position the insertion point where you want the structure to 
be inserted.
 
2. Click Equation Tools Design ➪ Structures ➪ Script.
 
3. In the Subscripts and Superscripts section of the menu, click Subscript. Two 
placeholder boxes appear: one regular-sized and one smaller and slightly lowered.

177
Chapter 5: Formatting Text

4. Click in the first placeholder box and type or insert the content that should 
precede the characters in subscript.
 
5. Click in the second placeholder box and type or insert the content that should 
appear in subscript.
All the other structures work exactly the same way, although some of them might appear 
intimidating and complex. Just click in the placeholders and ﬁ ll in the content.
Switching Between Professional and Linear Layout
The default type of equation layout is Professional, which shows structures spread out on 
multiple lines wherever appropriate. Professional layout makes math formulas that are easy 
to read and understand.
However, when space is an issue on a slide, you might be unwilling to give up two or more 
lines in order to show an equation. To save space, it’s helpful to switch the equation’s view 
to Linear. Using a Linear view runs the equation on a single line, changing the symbols 
where needed to alternatives that can be expressed in a linear fashion (see Figure 5.35).
FIGURE 5.35
Comparison of Professional (top) and Linear (bottom) views.
To switch between Linear and Professional views, use the corresponding buttons in the 
Tools group on the Equation Tools Design tab.
Formatting an Equation
There are some differences in the formatting capabilities for equations versus regular text. 
Here’s a quick summary:
 
■Font. Cambria Math is used for formulas by default. While you can change this 
(right-click the equation and choose Font, or select the font from the Home tab), 
font changes will not take effect unless the font you choose supports mathemati-
cal symbols. Because Cambria Math is the only font that ships with Ofﬁ ce 2013 that 
fully supports all math symbols used in the Equation Editor, it is in effect your only 
choice.

178
Part I: Building Your Presentation
 
■Size. By default, the baseline font for an equation is 18 point. Some characters can 
be larger or smaller than that depending on their context. You can select the equa-
tion’s frame and then choose a different font size from the Home tab to adjust the 
overall size of the equation up or down proportionally from there.
 
■Color. Use the Font Color button on the Home tab to change the color of the text 
used for the equation if desired. Keep in mind, however, that equations are nearly 
always utilitarian objects, not decorative.
 
■Bold. You can apply boldface to individual characters or to the entire equation.
 
■Strikethrough. You can apply strikethrough to individual characters or to the 
entire equation.
 
■Italics. Letters in an equation are italicized by default, as are some symbols. It 
is usually best to leave these at their default, because people expect to see those 
items italicized, and the italics help them make sense of the equation.
 
■Underline. Underline cannot be applied to individual characters; it can be applied 
only to the equation as a whole.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned many techniques for formatting text. You learned how to apply 
different fonts, sizes, colors, and attributes, and how to bend and shape text with 3-D 
effects and WordArt transformations. In the next chapter, you’ll continue to look at text 
formatting, focusing on paragraph-wide effects such as bulleted and numbered lists, 
indentation, and alig nment.

n the previous chapter you learned how to format text by applying fonts, sizes, colors, attri-
butes, and WordArt special effects. Now that your text is looking its best, you can expand the 
focus to the next level: paragraphs.
What can you do to an entire paragraph, as opposed to an individual text character? Plenty. For 
example, you can deﬁ ne multiple levels of bulleted and numbered lists, and you can adjust the tab 
stops, indentations, line spacing, and horizontal alignment for each paragraph.
All of these things happen within the context of text boxes, of course, because PowerPoint places 
all text in text boxes. So this chapter also takes a look at text box formatting, including ﬁ lls, bor-
ders, vertical alignment, and rotation.
Formatting Bulleted Lists
For better or for worse, most PowerPoint presentations contain a lot of bulleted lists. When you cre-
ate a slide based on a layout that includes a bulleted list, or when you type a new slide in the out-
line pane, you get bullets automatically. 

180
Part I: Building Your Presentation
 
 See Appendix A, “What Makes a Great Presentation?” for an analysis of why bulleted lists are some-
times not the best way to present information, and see Lab 1, “Presenting Content without Bulleted 
Lists,” at the end of the book to learn about alternatives.
If you apply text formatting such as bold to a paragraph, the bullet character will also be affected. To avoid this, leave 
a blank space after the fi nal character in the paragraph and then make sure you select only the text, not the entire 
paragraph, before applying text effects.
Bullets and the Slide Master
You can apply the bulleted list changes that you learn about in the following sections to 
individual paragraphs, but your best bet is to apply them to the slide master, or at least to 
individual layout masters. That way, you ensure consistency throughout the presentation. 
On the slide master, ﬁ ve levels of bullets are deﬁ ned, as shown in Figure 6.1. (You can add 
additional levels by pressing Enter and then Tab after the last level.) You can customize 
any of these levels individually. Here’s a high-level overview of the process:

4. Customize the bullet character, as in the following sections.
 
5. Click in the “Second level” line, and customize it.
 
6. Repeat the preceding steps for other levels that you want to customize. (If you 
do not plan to use all nine levels, you do not need to make changes to them.)
 
7. Click Slide Master tab ➪ Close ➪ Close Master View.
Using Bullet Presets
You can turn off the bullets for any paragraph(s) or text placeholders by selecting them and 
clicking the Bullets button on the Home tab to toggle the bullet(s) off. In that same way, 
you can apply bullets to paragraphs or text placeholders that don’t currently have them.
The default bullet character depends on the theme but is usually one of the presets on 
the Bullets button’s menu, shown in Figure 6.2. To switch among the presets, select the 
paragraph(s) to affect, open the button’s menu, and click a different preset. The menu also 
has a None command, an alternative for toggling bullets off.
FIGURE 6.2
Click the Bullets button to toggle bullets on/off or open its drop-down list.

182
Part I: Building Your Presentation
Each of the seven presets in the Bullets button’s menu is a placeholder. By default, each 
placeholder is populated with a certain symbol, but you can modify any or all of the place-
holders to be different sizes or colors, and you can even replace the characters with your 
own choices of symbols or graphics. In the following sections you learn how to select your 
own bullet characters.
Changing Bullet Size and Color
Each of the bullet presets (see Figure 6.2) is actually a character from a symbol font. It is 
text — and as such, you can format it like text. You can increase or decrease its size, and 
you can change its color. To change a bullet’s size and color, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the paragraph(s) to affect. For best results, make the change on the slide 
master to ensure consistency.
 
2. On the Home tab, open the Bullets button’s menu and choose Bullets and 
Numbering. The Bullets and Numbering dialog box appears with the Bulleted tab 
displayed.
 
3. In the Size box, use the increment buttons to increase or decrease the size. The 
size is in relation to the text size of the paragraph.
 
4. Click the Color button, and select a color from the Color Picker. See Figure 6.3.

5. Click OK to apply the changes.
The color and size changes you make in the Bullets and Numbering dialog box affect all presets. 
Changing the Bullet Symbol
If you do not like any of the preset bullets, you can change to a different character. You 
can use any character from any font installed on your system, including any letter or 
number.
 
If you want a numbered list, see the section “Formatting Numbered Lists” later in this chapter.
To select a different bullet symbol, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the paragraph(s) to affect. For best results, make the change on the slide 
master to ensure consistency.
 
2. Open the Bullets button’s menu and choose Bullets and Numbering. The Bullets 
and Numbering dialog box appears with the Bulleted tab displayed, as shown in

8. Click OK to apply the new symbol to the selected paragraph(s).
Resetting a Bullet Preset
After you have customized a bullet preset, you might decide you want to go back to its 
original setting. To reset it, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Bullets button’s menu and choose Bullets and Numbering. The Bullets 
and Numbering dialog box appears with the Bulleted tab displayed, as shown in 
Figure 6.3.
 
2. Click the preset that you want to reset.
 
3. Click the Reset button. The position is reset.
 
4. Click OK to apply the reset character. Do not click Cancel or the reset will be can-
celed. If you don’t actually want to apply the character, change it afterward.
If the Reset button is unavailable, try clicking another preset and then clicking back to the desired one again.
Using a Picture Bullet
Microsoft’s clip art collection contains many small graphics that work well as bullets. Such 
graphics have a keyword of bullet assigned to them. The Insert Pictures dialog box, which 
you can access by clicking the Picture button in the Bullets and Numbering dialog box, 
enables you to locate and use bullet-suitable clip art.
To use a picture bullet, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the paragraph(s) to which you want to apply the picture bullet. For best 
results, make the change on the slide master to ensure consistency.
 
2. Open the Bullets button’s menu and choose Bullets and Numbering. The Bullets 
and Numbering dialog box appears with the Bulleted tab displayed.
 
3. Click Picture. The Insert Pictures dialog box opens.
 
4. In the Office.com Clip Art section of the dialog box, click in the Search Office.
com box, type bullet (as in Figure 6.5), and press Enter.

FIGURE 6.5
Search for clip art with the keyword bullet.
Type bullet here and press Enter
 
5. Select the desired graphic in the search results that appear. Most of the graphics 
that appear are suitable bullet characters; a few of them may be graphics of objects 
that contain the word bullet in their names, and you can ignore those. See 
Figure 6.6.
 
6. Click Insert. The graphic is immediately applied to the paragraphs you selected 
in step 1. 
Most of the picture bullets are a ﬁ xed color (or combination of colors); they do not change 
color when you change the theme, and they are not affected by the Color setting in the 
Bullets and Numbering dialog box.
You can also add your own pictures as bullets. For best results, stick with very small, simple 
graphics. A detailed photo might look great as a full-screen image, but as a bullet it will 
probably look blurry and unrecognizable. To import your own picture, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the paragraph(s) to which you want to apply the picture bullet. For best 
results, make the change on the slide master to ensure consistency.
 
2. Open the Bullets button’s menu and choose Bullets and Numbering. The Bullets 
and Numbering dialog box appears with the Bulleted tab displayed.
 
3. Click Picture. The Insert Pictures dialog box opens (Figure 6.5).

4. Click From a File, and click Browse. The Insert Picture dialog box opens.
 
5. Select the graphic you want to use and click Open. The picture appears as 
a bullet to the selected paragraph(s).
If the picture bullet is too small or too large, reopen the Bullets and Numbering dialog box and increase or decrease the Size 
setting.
Formatting Numbered Lists
Numbered lists are very similar to bulleted ones except instead of using the same character 
for each item, they use sequential numbers or letters. Use a numbered list whenever the 
order of the items is signiﬁ cant.
Using Numbering Presets
To switch from bullets to numbering, or to apply numbering to text that has neither bullets 
nor numbering applied already, click the Numbering button on the Home tab. This applies 
the default numbering style — the one in position #1 of the presets.

187
Chapter 6: Formatting Paragraphs and Text Boxes

Like the Bullets button, the Numbering button also has a drop-down list with seven preset 
formats plus None, as shown in Figure 6.7. You can apply any of those presets from the menu.
FIGURE 6.7
Click the Numbering button to toggle numbering on/off or open its drop-down list and 
select a preset.
You usually don’t want to apply numbering to the slide master because it’s not the norm — bullets are. Also, the optimal amount 
of space between paragraphs is often different when numbered lists are used. Consider creating a special master layout for num-
bered lists and applying your number formatting to that layout in Slide Master view.
Changing Number Size and Color
Numbers can have different sizes and colors in relation to the rest of the paragraph text, 
just as bullets can. Using a different size and/or color can make the numbers stand out. To 
change a number’s size and color, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the paragraph(s) to affect. If you want to create a layout master to store 
the numbering formatting, switch to Slide Master view and work on that layout 
master.
 
2. On the Home tab, open the Numbering button’s menu and choose Bullets and 
Numbering. The Bullets and Numbering dialog box appears with the Numbered tab 
displayed.

188
Part I: Building Your Presentation
 
3. Click the numbering style preset to affect if it is not already selected.
 
4. In the Size box, use the increment buttons to increase or decrease the size. The 
size is in relation to the text size of the paragraph. See Figure 6.8.

5. Click the Color button, and select a color from the color picker.
 
6. Click OK to apply the changes.
The color and size changes you make in the Bullets and Numbering dialog box affect all seven presets. 
Changing the Start Number
To start the numbered list at some number other than 1, change the Start At value in the 
Bullets and Numbering dialog box (see Figure 6.8). You might do this, for example, if a 
numbered list continues from one slide or one text box to the next.

Setting Indents and Tabs
In the following sections you will learn about indents and tabs and how to use them to 
control the horizontal positioning of paragraph text within a text box in PowerPoint.
Working with Indents
Each level of bullet (or numbering) on the Slide Master has a preset indent deﬁ ned for it. 
There are two separate indents: one for the ﬁ rst line of the paragraph and another for sub-
sequent lines. They are represented on the ruler by triangles:
 
■First line indent. This down-pointing triangle represents the positioning of the 
ﬁ rst line of the paragraph. Because bulleted lists are the default and the bullet 
character hangs to the left of the rest of the paragraph, by default, the ﬁ rst line 
indent is set to be farther to the left.
 
■Hanging indent. This up-pointing triangle represents the positioning of the sec-
ond and subsequent lines in a multiline paragraph. If it is a single-line paragraph, 
this indent is ignored.
 
■Left indent. This rectangle controls both of the triangles as a single unit. If you 
want to move both triangles and maintain the spacing between them, you would 
drag this rectangle.
You can drag these symbols, shown in Figure 6.9, on the horizontal ruler to change their 
positions. (Hold down Ctrl as you drag if you want ﬁ ner control over the positioning.) You 
can also click the Increase List Level or Decrease List Level buttons in the Paragraph group 
on the Home tab to change the overall left indent.
FIGURE 6.9
Adjust the indents by dragging their markers.
First line indent

Hanging indent
You can also control indentation more precisely by using the Paragraph dialog box’s 
Indentation controls. These controls let you specify indentation at intervals as small as

10  

190
Part I: Building Your Presentation
of an inch, but they do not have an exact one-to-one relationship with the indent markers 
on the ruler, so you have to do a bit of mental translation.
There are three indentation settings in the Paragraph dialog box, as shown in Figure 6.10. 
Open this dialog box by clicking the dialog box launcher in the Paragraph group on the 
Home tab. The settings are as follows:
 
■Before Text. This is a general left indent setting. It sets both the hanging indent 
marker and the left indent marker.
 
■Special. This controls what happens to the ﬁ rst line. The choices are Hanging, First 
Line, or None. To indent the ﬁ rst line to the left of the others, choose Hanging. If 
you want the ﬁ rst line to the right of the others, choose First Line.
 
■By. If you chose Hanging or First Line, this sets the amount by which the ﬁ rst line 
will be offset from the Before Text setting.
FIGURE 6.10
You can set up indentation via the Paragraph dialog box.
Unlike in Word, there is no right indent marker for paragraphs in PowerPoint.
Working with Tabs
Preset tab stops occur every 1” on the ruler by default. Each time you press the Tab key 
(except at the beginning of a paragraph), the insertion point moves to the next tab stop. If 
you press Tab at the beginning of a paragraph, the paragraph is demoted one outline level. 
(Usually that demotion involves an indentation as well, but the indentation is deﬁ ned on 

191
Chapter 6: Formatting Paragraphs and Text Boxes

the slide master in that case.) The preset tab stops appear as gray squares at regular inter-
vals below the ruler, as you saw in Figure 6.9. Drag one of those gray squares to the right or 
left to change the preset tab stop interval.  Preset tab stops are always left-aligned stops. 
Each paragraph can have its own separate custom tab stops set. If you set the tab stops for 
one of the outline level paragraphs on the slide master or a layout master, it affects all bul-
lets of that outline level. To set tab stops, follow these steps:
 
1. View the slide containing the text box in Normal, Outline, or Slide Master view 
and select the paragraphs to affect.
 
2. If the horizontal ruler does not appear, choose View ➪ Show ➪ Ruler.
 
3. Click the ru ler where you want to set the tab. A little L appears, showing that 
you’ve just placed a left tab stop.
You can also set centered, right-aligned, or decimal-aligned tab stops. To set one of these, 
click the Tab Type button at the far left of the ruler. Each time you click this button, it 
cycles through the available tab stop types, shown in Table 6.1.
TABLE 6.1 Tab Stop Types

Type
Left
Center
Right
Decimal
To get rid of a tab stop, drag and drop it off the ruler.
You can also set tab stops via a Tabs dialog box for more precision. To access the Tabs dialog 
box, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the paragraph(s) to affect. To affect all slides, select the placeholders on 
the slide master in Slide Master view.
 
2. On the Home tab, click the dialog box launcher in the Paragraph group. The 
Paragraph dialog box opens.

192
Part I: Building Your Presentation
 
3. Click the Tabs button. The Tabs dialog box opens (Figure 6.11). From the Tabs dia-
log box, you can do any of the following:
 
■Set a tab stop. Type a number in the Tab Stop Position box to represent the 
number of inches from the left edge of the text box. Click the button in the 
Alignment section that represents the desired alignment, and then click Set.
 
■Clear a tab stop. To clear just one stop, select the stop to clear and then click 
the Clear button. To clear all custom tab stops, click Clear All.
 
■Change the default tab stop interval. The default interval is 1”. To change 
that, use the increment buttons in the Default Tab Stops box to increase or 
decrease the value, or type a new value directly into the box.
FIGURE 6.11
Set or clear tab stops in the Tabs dialog box.
Adjusting Line Spacing
Depending on the theme, PowerPoint leaves varying amounts of space between lines and 
between paragraphs. The default blank theme leaves some extra space between each para-
graph to make the divisions between them clearer; other themes tighten this up.
If the chosen theme doesn’t provide the line spacing you want, open it up in Slide Master 
view and make changes to the text placeholders on the slide master(s). For example, you 
can make the following changes:
 
■If most of your bulleted lists are single line, you can eliminate any extra space 
between paragraphs to make them seem closer together.
 
■If most of your bulleted lists are multiline paragraphs, you can add space between 
paragraphs to help differentiate them.

193
Chapter 6: Formatting Paragraphs and Text Boxes 
6
 
■If you want to make a large paragraph easier to read, you can add extra space 
between the lines.
To set basic line spacing, click Home ➪ Paragraph ➪ Line Spacing and select one of the pre-
sets, as shown in Figure 6.12.
FIGURE 6.12
Choose a line spacing preset from the button’s menu.
If you want more line spacing options, click the dialog box launcher for the Paragraph 
group on the Home tab or choose Line Spacing Options at the bottom of the Line Spacing 
button’s menu. The Paragraph dialog box contains the line spacing controls, as shown in 
Figure 6.13. There are three line spacing settings you can adjust:
FIGURE 6.13
Adjust line spacing in the Paragraph dialog box.

194
Part I: Building Your Presentation
 
■Before. Space before the paragraph
 
■After. Space after the paragraph
 
■Line Spacing. Space between the lines within the paragraph
Before and After are pretty straightforward; you can set their values in points. (Remember, 
one point is 
1
72 of an inch on a printed page.) It may be helpful to think about the spacing 
in relation to the font size that you are using. For example, if you are using 24-point text, 
an After setting of 8 points would leave 
1
3 of a line between paragraphs. 
You can set Line Spacing to a preset value of Single, 1.5 Lines, or Double. You can also set it 
to Multiple and then enter a custom value in the At box. For example, a Multiple value of 1 
is single spacing; a Multiple value of 0.9, as shown in Figure 6.13, is slightly less than single 
spacing, for just a bit of extra tightness in the layout.
All of the previously mentioned line spacing values are based on the text size in the 
paragraph and not ﬁ xed amounts. As the text size changes, the line spacing will adjust 
automatically. If you need ﬁ xed line spacing that does not change when the font changes, 
choose Exactly from the Line Spacing list. Then you can enter an exact number of points 
for the spacing in the At box.
Changing Horizontal Alignment
You can set horizontal alignment on a paragraph-by-paragraph basis. The default alignment 
is Left, but you can also have Centered, Right, Justiﬁ ed, and Distributed:
 
■Left, Centered, and Right. These are fairly self-explanatory. They refer to the 
point at which each line of text aligns with the other lines of text. For example, 
the text in this book is left aligned; the left edge of the paragraph is uniform and 
the right edge is ragged.
 
■Justified. The text aligns with both the right and left margins of the text box. 
Space is added between words and letters to make that happen. The ﬁ nal line of 
the paragraph is not justiﬁ ed; it is left aligned. Many newspapers use this align-
ment. It works best for long lines of text where there is a lot of text in which to 
spread out the extra spacing. Although justify looks good with large paragraphs, 
it is of limited usefulness for the brief bullet points that are the hallmark of most 
slides because it does not affect the last line, and in brief bullets the ﬁ rst line is 
the last line.
 
■Distributed. This is just like Justiﬁ ed, except it includes the last line of the para-
graph. You can use it to apply the Justiﬁ ed look to a single-line paragraph.

195
Chapter 6: Formatting Paragraphs and Text Boxes 
6
The Paragraph group on the Home tab contains buttons for Left, Centered, Right, and 
Justiﬁ ed. Click a button to change the alignment of the selected paragraph(s), as shown in 
Figure 6.14.
FIGURE 6.14
Click a button on the Paragraph group to set alignment.
Left
Center Right Justiﬁed
To use Distributed alignment, you must use the Paragraph dialog box. Click the dialog box 
launcher for the Paragraph group, and then choose the alignment from the Alignment drop-
down list. Distributed appears on that list along with the other alignments.
Alignment refers to the text’s position in its text box, not on the slide. If you want a text box centered on the slide but the text is 
left aligned within the box, simply move the text box where you want it. To align objects rather than individual text paragraphs, see 
“Aligning or Distributing Objects” in Chapter 9.
Formatting Text Boxes
In addition to formatting the paragraphs within a text box, you can format the text box 
itself. In Chapter 3, “Creating Slides and Text Boxes,” you learned how to create, resize, and 
move text boxes; now it’s time to ﬁ nd out how to change their appearances.
Applying Fills and Outlines
Text boxes are just like any other object in their ﬁ ll and outline formatting. You get the 
full details of object formatting in Chapter 9, but here’s a quick look.
The fill is the center of the text box, and the outline is the border. They can have separate 
formatting. For example, you can have a transparent ﬁ ll with a solid border or vice versa. You 
can apply one of the Shape Styles presets from the Format tab to apply both at once, or you 
can adjust them separately with their respective menus on the Format tab. See Figure 6.15.

To apply one of the presets, click it, or open the gallery if the one you want doesn’t appear. 
At the bottom of the gallery is Other Theme Fills, as shown in Figure 6.16. The ﬁ lls on this 
submenu are the same as the background ﬁ lls available from the Design tab, covered in 
Chapter 4. If you switch themes such that the background ﬁ ll presets change, the back-
ground of the text box changes too, if it is formatted with one of these.
FIGURE 6.16
Choose Other Theme Fills to select one of the theme’s backgrounds for the fi ll of the

Chapter 6: Formatting Paragraphs and Text Boxes

The Shape Fill and Shape Outline buttons, and their respective menus, will be familiar if 
you’ve reviewed Chapter 5, “Formatting Text,” because they’re very much the same as for 
text (WordArt). For the ﬁ ll, you can choose a solid color, a gradient, a picture, or a texture. 
For the outline, you can select a color, thickness, and dash style. See Chapter 9 for the full 
details on ﬁ lls and outlines.
Don’t forget that you also have the Eyedropper tool available, which I mentioned in Chapter 5. It enables you to pick up any color 
on any object in the presentation, and you can use it from any color chooser in PowerPoint. For a text box, you can access it for 
the fill color by clicking Drawing Tools Format ➪ Shape Styles ➪ Shape Fill ➪ Eyedropper. Then hover the mouse pointer over 
the color you want on any existing object and click to pick up and apply that color. To pick up a color for the shape outline, use 
Drawing Tools Format ➪ Shape Styles ➪ Shape Outline ➪ Eyedropper.
Selecting one of the background ﬁ lls in Figure 6.16 ﬁ lls the text box separately with one 
of the background presets. It does not necessarily pick the same background preset as is 
applied to the slide master. If you want the text box to always have the same ﬁ ll as the 
current background, you can either leave it set to No Fill (the default ﬁ ll) or set its ﬁ ll to 
match the background:
 
1. Right-click the text box’s border and choose Format Shape. The Format Shape 
task pane opens.
 
2. Click Fill to expand that category if it is not already expanded.
 
3. Click Slide Background Fill.
 
4. Close the task pane.
There is only one minor difference between No Fill and a Slide Background Fill. If there 
are any objects stacked behind the text box, the text box obscures them when set to 
Background but shows them when set to No Fill. Figure 6.17 shows the difference for two 
text boxes placed on a wood grain background with a ﬁ lled oval overlaid.
FIGURE 6.17
A slide background fi ll ignores any intervening objects.

198
Part I: Building Your Presentation
After you’ve set the text box’s fi ll to Background, the Shape Styles presets no longer work on it until you go back into 
the Format Shape dialog box and set the fi ll to Solid Fill or one of the other fi lls.
Setting Fill Transparency
Fill transparency determines how much of the background (or whatever is layered behind the 
text box) shows through it. By default, it is set to 0, which means the text box is not trans-
parent at all when it has a ﬁ ll assigned to it. To set the ﬁ ll transparency, follow these steps:
 
1. Apply the desired fill (a solid, gradient, picture, or texture fill).
 
2. Right-click the text box and choose Format Shape. The Format Shape task pane 
opens.
 
3. Click Fill to expand the Fill controls if they are not already displayed. 
 
4. Drag the Transparency slider or enter a percentage in its text box. See 
Figure 6.18.

5. Click Close.
If the fill is a gradient, you must set the transparency separately for each of the gradient stops. (A stop is a color in the gradient.) 
Set the Gradient Stops drop-down list to Stop 1, adjust the transparency, set it to Stop 2, adjust the transparency, and so on. 
Chapter 9 explains gradients in more detail.
There is another way to set transparency, but it only works when you are applying solid 
ﬁ xed colors as follows:
 
1. Select the text box.
 
2. Click Drawing Tools Format ➪ Shape Styles ➪ Shape Fill ➪ More Fill Colors.
 
3. Select the desired color.
 
4. Drag the Transparency slider at the bottom of the dialog box to a new value, as 
shown in Figure 6.19.

Controlling Vertical Alignment
The vertical alignment is the positioning of the text vertically within the text box. The 
default vertical alignment is Top, which means that if there is extra space in the text box, 
it congregates at the bottom.
For the main text placeholders in a presentation, Top alignment is usually the best because 
it prevents the ﬁ rst line of text on each slide from looking like it is inconsistently placed. 
However, for a manual text box on an individual slide, Middle alignment often looks better, 
especially in a text box that has an outline or ﬁ ll deﬁ ned.
You can choose Top, Middle, or Bottom alignment, or centered versions of each (Top 
Centered, Middle Centered, or Bottom Centered). The centered versions center the text hori-
zontally within the text box, but it’s not the same thing as horizontal alignment on a para-
graph level. The text remains left aligned with itself, but it scoots over to the center of the 
text box. Figure 6.20 shows the difference.
FIGURE 6.20

box and choose Format Shape, to open the Format Shape task pane. 
 
2. Click Text Options.
 
3. Click the Text Box icon. 
 
4. Choose a Vertical alignment setting. See Figure 6.22.
 
5. In the AutoFit section, choose Do Not AutoFit or Shrink Text on Overflow. 
If Resize Shape to Fit Text is selected here, the text box can’t be made any taller 
than is necessary to accommodate the text in it, so there will be no blank space to 
allocate vertically and no difference between the vertical alignment settings.
 
6. Close the task pane.
Changing Text Box Rotation
PowerPoint provides several types of rotation. You can spin things around a center point 
(the traditional 2-D type of rotation), or you can apply several 3-D rotation effects. 
However, the 3-D type is not well suited for text boxes because it tends to distort the text.
 
See Chapter 9 to learn more about the 3-D type and to experiment with a text box. See Chapter 5 for 
3-D type as it pertains to WordArt.

You can rotate a text box in 2-D by dragging its rotation handle, the green circle at the top 
of the text box. The text stays with it, so you can create upside-down text, sideways text, 
or text at whatever angle you like, as shown in Figure 6.23.

Chapter 6: Formatting Paragraphs and Text Boxes

If you want to rotate the text box only, but not the text within it, here’s how to accomplish 
that:
 
1. Apply a border or fill to the text box (of any type) so you can see the rotation 
results.
 
2. Right-click the text box and choose Format Shape.
 
3. Click Shape Options, and then click the Effects icon.
 
4. Click 3-D Rotation to expand that set of controls.
 
5. Select the Keep Text Flat check box.
 
6. Click the buttons on the Z Rotation: row to rotate the text box while leaving 
the text as is.
 
7. Close the task pane.
Changing Text Direction
Instead of rotating the text box, you might prefer to just rotate the text within it. Text 
can run vertically on its side, facing either to the left or right, or the letters can be at 
normal orientation individually but stacked vertically. To set a text direction, use the Text 
Direction button in the Paragraph group on the Home tab. Figure 6.24 shows the menu and 
some examples of the text direction settings.
FIGURE 6.24
You can set text direction separately from text box rotation.

204
Part I: Building Your Presentation
After changing the text direction, you might need to resize the text box so that the text fl ows in the new direction.
When text is rotated 90 or 270 degrees, it often looks better if you use the Character Spacing button in the Font group to set its 
spacing to Loose. Conversely, stacked text often looks better when set to Very Tight.
Setting Internal Margins
A text box’s internal margins control the amount of blank space between the edge of the 
box and the text inside it, just like the margins in a word-processing document except that 
each text box has its own individual margin settings. To set a text box’s internal margins, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the text box’s border and choose Format Shape. The Format Shape 
task pane opens.
 
2. Click Text Options, and then click the Textbox icon. The Text Box settings appear 
(Figure 6.25). 
 
3. Change the Left Margin, Right Margin, Top Margin, and Bottom Margin set-
tings as needed.
 
4. Close the task pane.
Creating Multiple Columns
In PowerPoint 2013, you can set up a text box to create multiple linked columns within a 
single text frame. This provides an easy way to convert a single-column layout into a multi-
column one. To adjust the number of columns used in a text box, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the text box.
 
2. Click Home ➪ Paragraph ➪ Add or Remove Columns.
 
3. Select a number of columns from the menu, as shown in Figure 6.26.
If you need a different number of columns, or you want to specify the spacing between 
them, choose More Columns from the menu. Then in the Columns dialog box (see 
Figure 6.27), enter a number to specify the number of columns and set an amount of spac-
ing in inches.

Like all Microsoft applications, PowerPoint has a built-in Find tool, which lets you search 
for — and, optionally, replace — a string of text anywhere in your presentation. This feature works 
in all views except for Slide Show, in which it isn’t applicable. However, in Slide Sorter view, it ﬁ nds 
and replaces all instances only; you cannot interactively conﬁ rm each instance.
We will ﬁ rst take a look at the Find function. For example, let’s say that Bob Smith was ﬁ red this 
morning. (Poor Bob.) Now you need to go through your presentation and see whether Bob’s name 
is mentioned so that you can take out any lines that refer to him. Follow these steps to ﬁ nd a text 
string (such as Bob Smith):
1. Click Home ➪ Editing ➪ Find, or press Ctrl+F. The Find dialog box appears.
2. Type what you want to find in the Find What text box, as shown in Figure 7.1. If you 
want to ﬁ nd a text string that you have searched for before, open the Find What drop-down 
list and select it. This is sometimes faster than retyping.

208

FIGURE 7.1
Type what you want to fi nd, and then click the Find Next button.
 
3. If you want to find only whole words or to match the case, select the appropri-
ate check box.
 
4. Click Find Next. The display jumps to the ﬁ rst instance of the text in your presen-
tation, starting from the insertion point, working downward through the presenta-
tion, and then looping back to the top.
 
5. If the found instance was not the one that you were looking for, or if you want 
to see if there are other instances, click the Find Next button again. You can 
continue clicking the Find Next button until you have seen all of the instances. 
When PowerPoint cannot ﬁ nd any more instances, the message “The search text 
was not found” appears and you must click OK to clear it.
 
6. Click Close when you are finished.
You can also perform a replace, which adds functionality to the Find feature. This action 
ﬁ nds the speciﬁ ed text and then replaces it with other text that you specify. For example, 
suppose that you are preparing a presentation for the Acme Corporation’s sales staff. Two 
days before the presentation, you ﬁ nd out that the Primo Corporation has purchased Acme. 
You now need to go through the entire presentation and change every instance of Acme to 
Primo.
While you are using the Find feature, as explained in the preceding steps, you can switch to the Replace dialog box by clicking the 
Replace button. When you do so, the Find string transfers over to the Replace dialog box, so that you don’t have to retype it.
To ﬁ nd and replace a text string, follow these steps:
 
1. Click Home ➪ Editing ➪ Replace, or press Ctrl+H. The Replace dialog box appears.
The Replace button on the Home tab has a drop-down list. From this list, you can tell Replace Fonts to do a fi nd-and-
replace for certain font usage. You learn more about this in Chapter 5, “Formatting Text.”

2. Type the text that you want to find in the Find What text box. If you have pre-
viously used Find or Replace, the most recent text that you found appears in the 
text box.
 
3. Type the new text in the Replace With text box. For example, if you were replac-
ing layoffs with downsizing, it would look like Figure 7.2.
FIGURE 7.2
Enter what you want to fi nd and what you want to replace it with.
 
4. If you want whole words only or a case-sensitive search, select the appropriate 
check box.
 
5. Click Find Next to find the first instance.
 
6. If you want to replace that instance, click the Replace button. The next instance 
appears automatically. After this, click Find Next to go on.
 
7. Repeat step 6 to check and selectively replace each instance, or click the 
Replace All button to change all instances at once.
 
8. When you are finished, click Close. You may have to click OK ﬁ rst to clear a dia-
log box telling you that the speciﬁ ed text was not found.
Correcting Your Spelling and Grammar
If you think that a spelling and grammar check can’t improve the look of your presenta-
tion, just think for a moment how ugly a blatant spelling error would look in huge type 
on a ﬁ ve-foot projection screen. Frightening, isn’t it? If that image makes you nervous, it 
should. Spelling and grammar mistakes can creep past even the most literate people, and 
pop up where you least expect them, often at embarrassing moments.
Fortunately, like other Microsoft Ofﬁ ce programs, PowerPoint comes with a powerful spell-
ing and grammar program that can check your work for you at any time, minimizing the 
number of embarrassing mistakes. The Ofﬁ ce programs all use the same spelling and gram-
mar checker, and so if you are familiar with it in another Ofﬁ ce application, you should be 
able to breeze through a spell check in PowerPoint with no problem.

210
Part I: Building Your Presentation
Even though PowerPoint 2013 contains grammar-checking capabilities, the grammar check is turned off by default. 
To enable grammar checking, see “Setting Spelling and Grammar Options” later in this chapter.
When PowerPoint marks a word as misspelled, it really just means that the word is not in its dictionary. Many words, 
especially proper names, are perfectly okay to use, even though they are not in PowerPoint’s dictionary, so don’t 
believe PowerPoint against your own good judgment.
Checking an Individual Word
As you work, PowerPoint underlines words that aren’t in its dictionary, plus any potential 
grammar errors, with a red, wavy line. Whenever you see a red-underlined word, you can 
right-click it to see a list of spelling or grammar suggestions, as shown in Figure 7.3. Click 
the correction that you want, or click one of the other commands. 
FIGURE 7.3
Right-click a red-underlined word for quick spelling advice.
Right-click a word
with a wavy red underline.
For a grammar error, an additional command is available at the bottom of the suggestion 
list: Ignore. It only ignores this instance of the potential grammar error.  
For a spelling error, two other commands are available:
 
■Ignore All. Ignores this and all other instances of the word in this PowerPoint ses-
sion. If you exit and restart PowerPoint, the list is wiped out.

211
Chapter 7: Correcting and Improving Text
7
 
■Add to Dictionary. Adds this word to PowerPoint’s custom dictionary. (You learn 
more about the custom dictionary later in this chapter.)
If you don’t want to see the red wavy underlines on-screen, you can turn the feature off by selecting File ➪ Options and then click-
ing Proofing. Click the Hide Spelling and Grammar Errors check box and click OK. This just turns the underlines off; it doesn’t stop 
PowerPoint from checking spelling as you type. A separate Check Spelling As You Type check box, in the same location, does that. 
Turning off Check Spelling As You Type relieves PowerPoint of a small processing burden, making it run a bit faster.
Checking the Entire Presentation
If your presentation is long, it can become tiresome to individually right-click each 
wavy-underlined word or phrase. In such cases, it’s easier to use the Spelling feature in 
PowerPoint to check all of the words in the presentation.
To begin the spell check, click Review ➪ Prooﬁ ng and then click the Spelling button, or 
press F7. If there are no misspelled words in your presentation, PowerPoint presents a dia-
log box telling you that your spell check is complete. Click OK to close this dialog box. If, 
on the other hand, PowerPoint ﬁ nds a misspelled word, a Spelling task pane opens (or a 
Grammar task pane if it’s a grammar error), and you can choose from several options. Figure 
7.4 shows the Spelling task pane. 
The following options are on the Spelling task pane:
 
■Suggestions list. Lists words that are close to the spelling of the word that you 
actually typed. Choose the one you want by clicking it and then click the Change 
button.
 
■Change button. Changes the selected instance of the word to the word selected in 
the Suggestions list.
 
■Change All button. Changes all occurrences of the word in the entire presentation 
to the word selected in the Suggestions list.
 
■Ignore button. Skips the selected instance of the word, removing the red underline 
that indicates it may be misspelled.
 
■Ignore All button. Skips over all occurrences of the word in this PowerPoint 
session only.
 
■Add button. Adds the word to PowerPoint’s custom dictionary so that it is recog-
nized in the future.
 
■Pronunciation button. Pronounces the word pronounced that is currently selected 
in the Suggestions list. 
 
■Language box. Selects a different language (and thereby a different dictionary) 
with which to check spelling.

212
Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 7.4
When PowerPoint fi nds a misspelled word with the spell checker, you can respond to it using 
these controls.
Select the suggestion
that is most appropriate.
Click the speaker icon to
hear the word pronounced.
When PowerPoint can’t ﬁ nd any more misspelled words, it displays a dialog box to let you 
know this; click OK to close it.
If you have more than one language dictionary available (for example, if you use PowerPoint in a multilingual office and have pur-
chased multiple language packs from Microsoft), then you can specify which language’s dictionary to use for which text. To do so, 
select the text that is in a different language than the rest of the presentation, and then click Review ➪ Language ➪ Language 
➪ Set Proofing Language. Select the appropriate language from the list and click OK.
If PowerPoint is conﬁ gured to also check for grammar errors (see the next section, “Setting 
Spelling and Grammar Options”), a Grammar task pane appears when it detects one. Figure 
7.5 shows an example. The options are much simpler; you can choose to ignore the grammar 
error or to change to one of the suggestions on the Suggestions list. 

213
Chapter 7: Correcting and Improving Text

FIGURE 7.5
When PowerPoint fi nds a grammar error, you can respond to it using these controls.
Setting Spelling and Grammar Options
There are many options available for controlling the spelling and grammar corrections 
in PowerPoint. On the Prooﬁ ng tab, the options under the When Correcting Spelling in 
Microsoft Ofﬁ ce Programs section carry over to other Ofﬁ ce programs, so when you make 
a settings change in one Ofﬁ ce app, it affects all of your other Ofﬁ ce apps. The settings in 
the When Correcting Spelling in PowerPoint section apply only to PowerPoint. 
To control how (and whether) the spelling and grammar checkers operate in PowerPoint, do 
the following:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Options, and click Proofing. The Prooﬁ ng options appear (Figure 7.6).
 
2. Select or deselect any of the check boxes as desired in the When Correcting 
Spelling in Microsoft Office Programs section: 
 
■Ignore Words in UPPERCASE. Prevents the spell checker from ﬂ agging acronyms.
 
■Ignore Words That Contain Numbers. Prevents the spell checker from noticing 
words with digits in them, such as license plate numbers or model numbers.

214
Part I: Building Your Presentation
 
■Ignore Internet and File Addresses. Prevents the spell checker from ﬂ agging 
Web or e-mail addresses, network paths, or ﬁ le paths.
 
■Flag Repeated Words. Flags second and subsequent instances of the same word 
in a row, preventing you from making mistakes like writing “the the.”
 
■Enforce Accented Uppercase in French. Suggests accents for uppercase letters 
as appropriate. Applicable only when the editing language is French.
 
■Suggest from Main Dictionary Only. Ignores any custom spelling dictionaries if 
any are present.
 
■Foreign language modes. Includes drop-down lists for each of the languages 
that appear so you can ﬁ ne-tune the spell check for each language. In Figure 
7.6, the choices are French modes and Spanish modes. 
FIGURE 7.6
You can set spelling options here.

215
Chapter 7: Correcting and Improving Text

3. Select or deselect any of the check boxes as desired in the When Correcting 
Spelling in PowerPoint section: 
 
■Check Spelling As You Type. This option is on by default. Turning it off pre-
vents the spell checker from noticing and underlining words in red that it can’t 
ﬁ nd in its dictionary. This can cause a small improvement in performance on a 
slow computer; you will not notice the difference on a fast computer.
 
■Hide Spelling and Grammar Errors. This option is off by default. Selecting this 
check box prevents the red, wavy underline from appearing beneath misspelled 
words. It does not prevent the spell checker from checking them; you can right-
click a misspelled word to see suggestions for it, as you normally would.
 
■Check Grammar with Spelling. This option is off by default; when you turn 
it on, grammar checking becomes available, both with red wavy underlines for 
individual instances and with the Spelling command on the Review tab.
 
4. Click OK to accept the new settings.
Working with Custom Dictionaries
The main spelling dictionary in PowerPoint is read-only, and so the words you add to the 
dictionary have to be stored somewhere else. This is where custom dictionaries come in. A 
custom dictionary contains a list of words that should not be ﬂ agged as misspellings. It can 
include proper names, acronyms, abbreviations, or any other codes or text strings that you 
frequently type.
PowerPoint shares custom dictionaries with the other Offi ce 2013 applications, so you can use them in PowerPoint or 
in one of the other applications.
Specifying the Default Custom Dictionary
As you are spell-checking, you can click Add (in the Spelling task pane) or Add to 
Dictionary (from the shortcut menu when you right-click a red wavy-underlined word) to 
add the word to the default custom dictionary. 
In Ofﬁ ce 2013, the default custom dictionary is RoamingCustom.dic, and it’s stored in 
C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Office\15.0\89bd0643
\Proofing. You should leave this dictionary as the default in most cases. This dictionary 
is shared via SkyDrive or Active Directory with other devices on which you run Ofﬁ ce.
In Ofﬁ ce 2007 and 2010, the default custom dictionary was Custom.dic, stored in 
C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\UProof, and this custom diction-
ary is still available in Ofﬁ ce 2013. If you need to share a custom dictionary with Ofﬁ ce 
2007 or 2010 applications, you should continue to use this dictionary as your default. 

216
Part I: Building Your Presentation
To change which dictionary is the default to which new words will be saved, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Options.
 
2. Click Proofing.
 
3. Click Custom Dictionaries.
 
4. Select the desired custom dictionary from the list. See Figure 7.7.
 
5. Click Change Default. That dictionary becomes the default, and (Default) appears 
next to it.
 
6. Click OK to close the Custom Dictionaries dialog box.
 
7. Click OK to close the PowerPoint Options dialog box.
FIGURE 7.7
Choose which custom dictionary will be the default for new word storage.
Editing a Custom Dictionary
One way to get words into the default custom dictionary is to type them in a presentation 
and then use the Spelling feature to add them. However, you can also add words to the 
custom dictionary without having to type them in the presentation and then spell-check 
them. Follow these steps to add words:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Options.
 
2. Click Proofing.
 
3. Click Custom Dictionaries. The Custom Dictionaries dialog box opens (Figure 7.7).
 
4. Select the desired custom dictionary from the list.
 
5. Click Edit Word List. A dialog box appears, listing all of the words that are cur-
rently in that dictionary. See Figure 7.8. 
 
6. To add a new word, type it in the Word(s) text box and click Add. Words can be 
no longer than 64 characters.

217
Chapter 7: Correcting and Improving Text

FIGURE 7.8
Add a word to the custom dictionary.
 
7. (Optional) To delete a word, select it and click Delete. To clear the entire custom 
dictionary, click Delete All.
 
8. Click OK when you are finished editing the custom dictionary.
The custom dictionary accepts multiword entries, but you should enter them as separate words in the list; it does not 
recognize spellings that consist of only part of the entered word. For example, you could enter Shawna Browslawski, 
but the spell checker would not recognize Shawna or Browslawski by itself. However, if you enter them as separate 
words, they are accepted either individually or together.
If you have a lot of words to add to the dictionary, you might prefer to edit the dictionary 
ﬁ le manually. Dictionary ﬁ les are plaintext ﬁ les, so you can edit them in Notepad. You can 
even combine two or more separate dictionary ﬁ les into a single ﬁ le by copying and past-
ing lists of words between them. To edit a dictionary ﬁ le, open it in a text editor such as 
Notepad. Remember, the paths for the Microsoft-supplied dictionary ﬁ les are as follows: 
 
■Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Office\15.0\89bd0643
\Proofing\RoamingCustom.dic
 
■Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\UProof\custom.dic
Creating a New Custom Dictionary
A custom dictionary ﬁ le can be as large as 64KB in size, or 5,000 words. If you need a larger 
custom dictionary than this, you must create another dictionary ﬁ le. You might also want 
additional custom dictionaries to keep sets of words separate for different clients or projects. 
For example, when working for a client with many trademarked product names that consist 
of nontraditional spellings of common words, you might want to set those names as correctly 
spelled, but when working for another client who does not use those names, you might want 

218
Part I: Building Your Presentation
those words to be ﬂ agged as possible misspellings. You can enable or disable each custom 
dictionary, so you can enable only the dictionaries that apply to the present project.
All spell checks use the main dictionary as well as all of the custom dictionaries that are selected in the Dictionary List section 
in the Custom Dictionaries dialog box. To disable a certain dictionary from being used, deselect its check box in the Custom 
Dictionaries dialog box.
To create a custom dictionary, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Options.
 
2. Click Proofing.
 
3. Click Custom Dictionaries.
 
4. Click New. The Create Custom Dictionary dialog box appears. 
 
5. Navigate to the location in which you want to store the dictionary. Where you 
store it depends on which users you want to be able to access it: 
 
■To make the dictionary accessible to all users of your PC, create a new folder on 
the C drive called Dictionaries (or anything else you want to call it) and store 
dictionaries there.
 
■To make the dictionary accessible to only the current Windows user, store it in 
the default custom dictionary location, Users\username\AppData\Roaming
\Microsoft\UProof, which is where custom.dic is stored.
 
6. Type a name for the dictionary in the File Name text box.
 
7. Click Save.
The new dictionary appears in the Dictionary List section in the Custom Dictionaries 
dialog box.
All enabled custom dictionaries are checked automatically during the spell-check process, but newly added words are placed only 
in the default custom dictionary. To set the default dictionary, select a custom dictionary in the Custom Dictionaries dialog box and 
then click the Change Default button, as you learned earlier in this chapter.
Setting the Editing Language
PowerPoint performs spell check using the native language for your copy of Ofﬁ ce. For 
example, if you bought your copy in the United States, then English (U.S.) is the default 
language. It is important that you select the correct country as well as the correct language 

219
Chapter 7: Correcting and Improving Text
7
because some countries have different spellings than others for the same language. For 
example, in the United Kingdom, s substitutes for the American z in words like realise/
realize, so if you use the wrong editing language, words will be marked as misspelled when 
they really aren’t. The Language setting is also used by some of the research tools, which 
are covered later in this chapter.
To mark a passage of text as a certain language (and country if applicable), follow these 
steps:
 
1. Select the text that you want to mark. To mark text on more than one slide, 
select the text from the Outline pane in Outline view.
 
2. Click Review ➪ Language ➪ Language ➪ Set Proofing Language. The Language 
dialog box opens.
 
3. Select the language and country from the list, as shown in Figure 7.9.
FIGURE 7.9
Select a language for the text.
 
4. (Optional) To set a certain language as the default, select it and click Default; 
then click Yes to confirm.
 
5. Click OK.
Using AutoCorrect to Fix Common Problems
With AutoCorrect, PowerPoint can automatically correct certain common misspellings and 
formatting errors as you type. For example, one of the AutoCorrect actions that is already 
set up by default is to change teh to the. To access AutoCorrect and manage the automatic 
corrections it makes, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Options.
 
2. Click Proofing.

220
Part I: Building Your Presentation
 
3. Click AutoCorrect Options. The AutoCorrect dialog box opens.
 
4. If it is not already displayed, click the AutoCorrect tab, shown in Figure 7.10.
FIGURE 7.10
Set up the corrections that you want PowerPoint to handle automatically as you type.
 
5. Select the options that you want. At the top of the dialog box is a series of check 
boxes that help you to ﬁ ne-tune some other corrections that AutoCorrect makes in 
addition to spelling corrections: 
 
■Show AutoCorrect Options Buttons. This option controls whether a button is 
available to reverse an AutoCorrect action after the action occurs. (For more on 
how to use this button, see the end of this section.)
 
■Correct TWo INitial CApitals. If you accidentally hold down the Shift key too 
long and type two capital letters in a row (such as MIcrosoft), PowerPoint cor-
rects this error if you leave this option selected.
 
■Capitalize First Letter of Sentences. Leave this option selected to have 
PowerPoint capitalize the ﬁ rst letter of the ﬁ rst word after a sentence-ending 
punctuation mark, such as a period, or to capitalize the ﬁ rst letter of the word 
that occurs at the beginning of a paragraph.
Click the Exceptions button to open an AutoCorrect Exceptions dialog box. Here, you can enter a list of capitalization exceptions, 
such as abbreviations that use periods but aren’t at the end of a sentence (for example, approx. and Ave.). You can also set up a 
list of TWo INitial CApitals exceptions.

221
Chapter 7: Correcting and Improving Text
7
 
■Capitalize First Letter of Table Cells. Leave this option selected to capitalize 
the ﬁ rst letter of the ﬁ rst word within a table cell. Otherwise, PowerPoint does 
not treat text in a table as a sentence for capitalization purposes.
 
■Capitalize Names of Days. Leave this option selected to make sure that the 
names of days, such as Sunday, Monday, and so on, are capitalized.
 
■Correct Accidental Use of cAPS LOCK key. If you accidentally leave Caps Lock 
on, PowerPoint can sometimes detect it and ﬁ x this problem. For example, if you 
type the sentence, “hE WAS GLAD TO SEE US,” PowerPoint may conclude that the 
Caps Lock is inappropriately on, and so it turns the Caps Lock off for you and 
ﬁ xes the sentence.
 
■Replace Text as You Type. This option activates the main portion of 
AutoCorrect, the word list. You must leave this option selected if you want 
AutoCorrect to correct spelling as you are typing. For example, if you type yoiu, 
PowerPoint automatically changes it to you.
 
6. Add items that you commonly misspell to the Replace/With list at the bottom 
of the dialog box. By default, this list already contains a number of word and sym-
bol pairs. To the left is the common misspelling, and to the right is the word that 
PowerPoint substitutes in its place. Scroll through this list to see the types of cor-
rections that PowerPoint makes. To add a word pair to the list, type the misspelling 
in the Replace text box and then type the replacement in the With text box. Then 
click the Add button. You can also add corrections through the Spelling dialog box.
You can use AutoCorrect to insert typographical symbols. The (C) entry is already set up to insert a copyright symbol, for example, 
and the (R) entry will insert a registered trademark symbol. If there is a symbol you use frequently yourself, feel free to set up an 
AutoCorrect entry to insert it more easily.
If PowerPoint insists on making a correction that you do not want, you can delete 
that correction from the list. Simply select it from the list and click Delete. For 
example, one of my clients likes me to code certain headings with (C) in front 
of them, and so the ﬁ rst thing that I do in any Ofﬁ ce program is to remove the 
AutoCorrect entry that speciﬁ es that (C) must be converted to a copyright symbol ©.
 
7. When you are finished, click OK to close the AutoCorrect dialog box.
 
8. Click OK to close the PowerPoint Options dialog box.
Don’t use AutoCorrect for misspellings that you may sometimes want to change to some other word or you may 
introduce embarrassing mistakes into your document. For example, if you often type pian instead of pain, and you 
also sometimes type pian instead of piano, don’t tell PowerPoint to always AutoCorrect to pain or you may fi nd that 
PowerPoint has corrected your attempt at typing piano and made it pain!

222
Part I: Building Your Presentation
When an AutoCorrect action occurs, provided you have not turned off the icon, a short  
horizontal line appears when you point at the AutoCorrected word. Place your cursor over 
it to display an AutoCorrect Options icon, and then click the icon to see a menu, as shown 
in Figure 7.11. From here, you can reverse the action, disable that particular correction, or 
open the AutoCorrect Options dialog box.
FIGURE 7.11
You can reverse an action, disable a correction, or open the AutoCorrect Options dialog box.
Using AutoFormat As You Type
The AutoFormat As You Type feature enables PowerPoint to convert certain letter combina-
tions to typographical characters that look nicer on a slide than plain text. For example, 
one of the AutoFormat As You Type actions is to convert two dashes (--) into a single long 
dash (—).
Other actions include automatic bulleted and numbered lists. For example, in a manual text 
box, you might type 1, press Tab, and type a paragraph, then type 2, press Tab, and type 
another paragraph. In this case, PowerPoint would guess that you want a numbered list and 
apply the Numbering format to those paragraphs (just as if you had clicked the Numbering 
button on the toolbar). Figure 7.12 shows all of the AutoFormat As You Type options.
To change the AutoFormat As You Type settings, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Options.
 
2. Click Proofing, and then click AutoCorrect Options.
 
3. Click the AutoFormat As You Type tab.
 
4. Select or deselect the options for the features that you want. See Figure 7.12.
 
5. Click OK.

Using the Research Tools
The Research feature is available in most of the Ofﬁ ce applications, including PowerPoint. 
It enables you to connect with various online and ofﬂ ine data stores to look up informa-
tion. This may include online encyclopedias, dictionaries, and news services.
The available tools are divided into two broad categories of sites: reference and research. 
Reference sites include dictionaries, thesauruses, and translation utilities; research sites 
include encyclopedias and news services.
You can consult all of the reference sites as a group, or you can consult an individual tool. 
For example, you can look up a word in the dictionary, thesaurus, or translator all at once, 
or you can just use the thesaurus.
Looking Up a Word in a Dictionary
To get a simple, concise deﬁ nition of a word, a dictionary is your best bet. Here’s how to use 
the dictionary in PowerPoint:
 
1. Click Review ➪ Proofing ➪ Research. The Research task pane opens.
 
2. Open the drop-down list of references at the top of the task pane and choose 
Encarta Dictionary: English (North America) or whatever language and country 
is appropriate.

224
Part I: Building Your Presentation
 
3. In the Search For text box, type the word that you want to look up, and either 
press Enter or click the green arrow icon. A deﬁ nition of the word appears, as 
shown in Figure 7.13.
 
4. Close the task pane when you are finished using the dictionary.
FIGURE 7.13
Look up a word in the Encarta Dictionary.
There are multiple dictionaries available; click the Research Options link at the bottom of the task pane to open a dialog box from 
which you can select other dictionaries. For example, the English version of Office comes with both North American and United 
Kingdom dictionaries, although only one is enabled by default (depending on the country in which you purchased Office).
Finding Synonyms and Antonyms with the Thesaurus
The Thesaurus feature works just like a hardbound thesaurus book. It lets you look up 
synonyms and antonyms for a word so that you can make your vocabulary more varied and 
colorful.

225
Chapter 7: Correcting and Improving Text
7
Synonyms are words that have similar meanings. Antonyms have opposite meanings.
To look up a word in the thesaurus, follow these steps:
 
1. Select a word that you want to look up.
 
2. Click Review ➪ Proofing ➪ Thesaurus. The Thesaurus task pane opens with the 
word’s synonyms and antonyms displayed. 
Synonyms are grouped by general meaning. Antonyms are followed by the word 
(Antonym). 
If the word that you want to look up does not already appear in the presentation, skip step 1, and then, after click-
ing the Thesaurus button, type the desired word in the Search For text box. Then press Enter or click the green arrow 
icon.
 
3. To insert a word into the presentation, do the following: 
 
a. Position the insertion point where you want to insert the found word, or select 
the word that you want to replace (if you did not select it already in step 1).
 
b. Open the task pane menu for the word that you want to insert. (Move your cur-
sor over the word to display a down arrow, and then click the down arrow.)
 
c. Click Insert. As you can see in Figure 7.14, you can also click Copy (to copy it to 
the Clipboard for later insertion).

Translation helps you to translate text into a variety of languages. It’s not a perfect trans-
lation by any means, so don’t embarrass yourself and try to translate your entire presen-
tation for a foreign audience. However, for simple words and phrases, as well as rough 
approximations of meaning, it can serve you well.
 To translate text in a presentation, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the text to be translated.
 
2. On the Review tab, click Review ➪ Language ➪ Translate ➪ Translate Selected 
Text. The Translation tools appear in the Research task pane.
 
3. Select the desired languages in the From and To drop-down lists, as shown in 
Figure 7.15. A translation appears for the selected text.
 
4. Close the Research task pane when you are finished using the Translator.

Ofﬁ ce 2013 also includes a Mini Translator utility that can quickly help you translate text 
into a speciﬁ ed language. To enable it, choose Review ➪ Language ➪ Translate ➪ Translate 
➪ Mini Translator. In the dialog box that appears, choose the language you want to trans-
late into and click OK. After doing that, you can point to a word to pop up a Mini Translator, 
which provides a translation for the word if one is available. See Figure 7.16. 
Using Research Sites
The research sites are sources that provide more in-depth information about a particular 
word or phrase, such as encyclopedias and news services. To use one of these services, fol-
low these steps:
 
1. Select the word or phrase that you want to look up.
 
2. Click Review ➪ Proofing ➪ Research. The Research task pane opens. If it was 
already open, it closes; click the Research button again to reopen it.

ten permission to use the data. This is especially true with photographs. Very few news services permit you to reuse 
their photos without permission.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to use the spelling, prooﬁ ng, and reference tools in 
PowerPoint to make a good impression on your audience. You learned how to ﬁ nd and 
replace text, how to look up reference information online without leaving PowerPoint, and 
even how to create custom dictionaries to use for different clients. Now you can present 
with conﬁ dence!

ou can type tabular data — in other words, data in a grid of rows and columns — directly into 
a table or import it from other applications. You can also apply much of the formatting that 
you learned about in Chapter 5, “Formatting Text,” and Chapter 6, “Formatting Paragraphs and 
Text Boxes,” but there are some special methods that you must consider when working with tabular 
data. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to create and manage PowerPoint tables and how to insert 
tabular data from other sources.
Creating a New Table
A table is a great way to organize little bits of data into a meaningful picture. For example, you 
might use a table to show sales results for several salespeople or to contain a multicolumn list of 
team member names.
Text from a table does not appear in the presentation’s outline.
There are several ways to insert a table, and each method has its purpose. The following sections 
explain each of the table creation methods. (Methods that involve using other programs, such as 

230
Part I: Building Your Presentation
Word or Excel, are covered later in the chapter, in the sections “Using Tables from Word” 
and “Integrating Excel Cells into PowerPoint.”)
A table can be part of a content placeholder, or it can be a separate, free-ﬂ oating item. If 
the active slide has an available placeholder that can accommodate a table, and there is not 
already content in that placeholder, the table is placed in it. Otherwise the table is placed 
as an independent object on the slide and is not part of the layout.
Depending on what you want to do with the table, it could be advantageous in some cases to not have the table be 
part of the layout. For example, perhaps you want the table to be a certain size and to not change when you apply a 
different theme. To ensure that the table is not part of the layout, start with a slide that uses a layout that contains 
no table-compatible placeholder, such as Title Only.
Creating a Table with the Insert Table Dialog Box
To create a basic table with a speciﬁ ed number of rows and columns, you can use the Insert 
Table dialog box. You can open it in either of two ways (see Figure 8.1):
FIGURE 8.1
Open the Insert Table dialog box from either the Table button’s menu or a content 
placeholder.
Click Insert Table.
 
■In a content placeholder, click the Table icon.
 
■On the Insert tab, click Tables ➪ Table ➪ Insert Table.
In the Insert Table dialog box, shown in Figure 8.2, specify a number for rows and columns 
and click OK. The table then appears on the slide.

231
Chapter 8: Creating and Formatting Tables

FIGURE 8.2
Enter the number of rows and columns to specify the size of the table that you want to 
create.
Creating a Table from the Table Button
When you opened the Table button’s menu (see Figure 8.1) in the preceding section, you 
probably couldn’t help but notice the grid of white squares. Another way to create a table is 
to drag across this grid until you select the desired number of rows and columns. The table 
appears immediately on the slide as you drag, so you can see how it will look, as shown in 
Figure 8.3.
FIGURE 8.3

to create.

232
Part I: Building Your Presentation
Other than the method of specifying rows and columns, this process is identical to creating 
a table via the Insert Table dialog box because the same issues apply regarding placeholders 
versus free-ﬂ oating tables. If a placeholder is available, PowerPoint uses it.
When you create a table from the Insert Table dialog or the Table button, the table is automatically formatted with 
one of the preset table styles. You learn how to change this later in the chapter. 
Drawing a Table
I’ve saved the most fun method for last. Drawing a table enables you to use your mouse 
pointer like a pencil to create every row and column in the table in exactly the positions 
you want. You can even create unequal numbers of rows and columns. This method is a 
good one to use whenever you want a table that is nonstandard in some way — different 
row heights, different column widths, different numbers of columns in some rows, and so 
on. To draw a table, follow these steps:
 
1. Start on a new slide, and click Home ➪ Slides ➪ Layout ➪ Title Only to switch 
to a layout that contains no content placeholders. Add a title in the Title place-
holder if you want one.
Opening a new slide with a Title Only layout isn’t a requirement for drawing a table, 
but it will make it easier your ﬁ rst time because it gives you a blank area in which 
to draw the table, without any placeholders in the way.
 
2. Click Insert ➪ Tables ➪ Table ➪ Draw Table. The mouse pointer turns into a 
pencil.
 
3. Drag to draw a rectangle representing the outer frame of the table. Then 
release the mouse button to create the outer frame and to display the Table Tools 
Design tab.
 
4. On the Table Tools Design tab, click Draw Table to re-enable the Pencil tool if it 
is not already enabled.
 
5. Drag to draw the rows and columns you want. You can draw a row or column that 
runs all the way across or down the table’s frame, or you can stop at any point to 
make a partial row or column. See Figure 8.4. When you begin to drag vertically or 
horizontally, PowerPoint locks into that mode and keeps the line exactly vertical or 
horizontal and straight. (Exception: It allows you to draw a diagonal line between 
two corners of existing cells.)
 
6. (Optional) To erase a line, click the Eraser button on the Table Tools Design 
tab, and then click the line to erase. Then click the Draw Table button on the 
Table Tools Design tab to return the mouse pointer to its drawing (pencil) mode.

233
Chapter 8: Creating and Formatting Tables

7. When you finish drawing the table, press Esc or click Draw Table again to tog-
gle the drawing mode off.
FIGURE 8.4

If you need a table that is mostly uniform but has a few anomalies, such as a few combined cells or a few extra 
divisions, create the table using the Insert Table dialog box or the grid on the Table button, and then use the Draw 
Table and/or Eraser buttons on the Table Tools Design tab to modify it.
Moving around in a Table
Each cell is like a little text box. To type in a cell, click in it and type. It’s pretty simple! 
You can also move between cells with the keyboard. Table 8.1 lists the keyboard shortcuts 
for moving the insertion point in a table.

Selecting Rows, Columns, and Cells
If you want to apply formatting to one or more cells or issue a command that acts upon 
them, such as Copy or Delete, you must ﬁ rst select the cells to be affected, as shown in 
Figure 8.5:

■A single cell. Move the insertion point by clicking inside the desired cell. At this 
point, any command acts on that individual cell and its contents, not the whole 
table, row, or column. Drag across multiple cells to select them.
 
■An entire row or column. Click any cell in that row or column and then click 
Table Tools Layout ➪ Table ➪ Select and choose Select Column or Select Row. 
Alternatively, position the mouse pointer above the column or to the left of the 
row, so that the mouse pointer turns into a black arrow, and then click to select 
the column or row. (You can drag to extend the selection to additional columns or 
rows when you see the black arrow.)
There are two ways to select the entire table — or rather, two senses in which the entire 
table can be “selected”:
 
■Select all table cells. When you select all of the cells, they all appear with shaded 
backgrounds, and any text formatting command that you apply at that point 
affects all of the text in the table. To select all cells, do any of the following: 
 
■Drag across all of the cells in the entire table.
 
■Click inside the table, and then press Ctrl+A.
 
■Select the entire table. When you do this, the table’s frame is selected, but the 
insertion point is not anywhere within the table and cells do not appear with a 
shaded background. You do this kind of selection before moving or resizing the 
table, for example. To select the entire table, do any of the following: 
 
■Click Table Tools Layout ➪ Table ➪ Select ➪ Select Table, shown in Figure 8.5.
 
■Click the frame of the table.
 
■Click inside the table, and then press Esc once.
 
■Right-click the table and choose Select Table.
 
■Drag a marquee around the table. You can use the mouse to drag a marquee (a 
box) around the table. This is also called lassoing. When you release the mouse but-
ton, everything inside the area is selected.
Editing a Table’s Structure
Now that you’ve created a table, let’s look at some ways to modify the table’s structure, 
including resizing the entire table, adding and deleting rows and columns, and merging 
and splitting cells.
Resizing the Overall Table
As with any other framed object in PowerPoint, dragging the table’s outer frame resizes 
it. Position the mouse pointer over one of the selection handles (the white squares on the 
sides and corners) so that the mouse pointer becomes a double-headed arrow, and drag to 
resize the table. See Figure 8.6.

236
Part I: Building Your Presentation
FIGURE 8.6
To resize a table, drag a selection handle on its frame.
Side handle
Double-headed mouse
pointer over a side handle
Corner handle
If you drag when the mouse pointer is over any other part of the frame, so that the mouse pointer becomes a four-
headed arrow, you move the table rather than resize it.
To maintain the aspect ratio (height to width ratio) for the table as you resize it, hold 
down the Shift key as you drag a corner of the frame. If maintaining the aspect ratio is not 
critical, you can drag either a corner or a side.
All of the rows and columns maintain their spacing proportionally to one another as you 
resize them. However, when a table contains text that would no longer ﬁ t if its row and 
column were shrunken proportionally with the rest of the table, the row height does not 
shrink fully; it shrinks as much as it can while still displaying the text. The column width 
does shrink proportionally, regardless of cell content.
You can also specify an exact size for the overall table frame by using the Table Size group 
on the Table Tools Layout tab, as shown in Figure 8.7. From there you can enter Height and 
Width values. To maintain the aspect ratio, select the Lock Aspect Ratio check box before 
you change either the Height or Width setting.
Inserting or Deleting Rows and Columns
Here’s an easy way to create a new row at the bottom of the table: Position the insertion 
point in the bottom-right cell and press Tab. Need something more complicated than that? 

237
Chapter 8: Creating and Formatting Tables
8
The Table Tools Layout tab contains buttons in the Rows & Columns group for inserting 
rows or columns above, below, to the left, or to the right of the selected cell(s), as shown 
in Figure 8.8. By default, each button inserts a single row or column at a time, but if 
you select multiple existing ones beforehand, these commands insert as many as you’ve 
selected. For example, to insert three new rows, select three existing rows and then click 
Insert Above or Insert Below.
FIGURE 8.7
Set a precise height and width for the table from the Table Size group.
FIGURE 8.8
Insert rows or columns by using these buttons on the Layout tab.
Alternatively, you can right-click any existing row or column, point to Insert, and choose 
one of the commands on the submenu. These commands are the same as the names of the 
buttons in Figure 8.8.
Adding new rows increases the overall vertical size of the table frame, even to the point where it runs off the bottom 
of the slide. You might need to adjust the overall frame size after adding rows. On the other hand, inserting columns 
does not change the overall frame size; it simply resizes the existing columns so that they all fi t and are all a uniform 
size (unless you have manually adjusted any of them to be a custom size).
To delete a row or column (or more than one of each), select the row(s) or column(s) that 
you want to delete, and then open the Delete button’s menu on the Table Tools Layout tab 
and choose Delete Rows or Delete Columns.
You cannot insert or delete individual cells in a PowerPoint table. (This is unlike in Excel, where you can remove indi-
vidual cells and then shift the remaining ones up or to the left.)

238
Part I: Building Your Presentation
Merging and Splitting Cells
If you need more rows or columns in some spots than others, you can use the Merge Cells 
and Split Cells commands. Here are some ways to merge cells:
 
■Click Table Tools Design ➪ Draw Borders ➪ Eraser, and then click the line you want 
to erase. The cells on either side of the deleted line are merged.
 
■Select the cells that you want to merge and click Table Tools Layout ➪ Merge ➪ 
Merge Cells.
 
■Select the cells to merge, right-click them, and choose Merge Cells.
Here are some ways to split cells:
 
■Click Table Tools Design ➪ Draw Borders ➪ Draw Table, and then drag to draw a line 
in the middle of a cell to split it.
 
■Select the cell that you want to split, right-click it, and choose Split Cells. In the 
Split Cells dialog box (see Figure 8.9), select the number of pieces in which to split 
in each direction, and click OK.
 
■Select the cell to split, and then click Table Tools Layout ➪ Merge ➪ Split Cells. In 
the Split Cells dialog box (see Figure 8.9), select the number of pieces in which to 
split in each direction, and click OK.
FIGURE 8.9
Specify how the split should occur.
Applying Table Styles
The quickest way to format a table attractively is to apply a table style to it. When you 
insert a table using any method except drawing it, a table style is applied to it by default; 
you can change to some other style if desired, or you can remove all styles from the table, 
leaving it plain black and white.
When you hover the mouse pointer over a table style, a preview of it appears in the active 
table. The style is not actually applied to the table until you click the style to select it, 
however.
If the style you want appears in the Table Tools Design tab’s Table Styles group, you can 
click it from there without opening the gallery. If not, you can scroll row by row through 

239
Chapter 8: Creating and Formatting Tables
8
the gallery by clicking the up/down arrow buttons, or you can open the gallery’s full menu, 
as shown in Figure 8.10. 
FIGURE 8.10
Apply a table style from the gallery.
To remove all styles from the table, choose Clear Table from the bottom of the gallery menu. 
This reverts the table to default settings: no ﬁ ll, and plain black 1-point borders on all sides 
of all cells.
The table styles use theme-based colors, so if you change to a different presentation theme 
or color theme, the table formatting might change. (Colors, in particular, are prone to 
shift.)
By default, the ﬁ rst row of the table (a.k.a. the header row) is formatted differently from 
the others, and every other row is shaded differently. (This is called banding.) You can con-
trol how different rows are treated differently (or not) from the Table Style Options group 
on the Table Tools Design tab. There is a check box for each of six settings:
 
■Header Row. The ﬁ rst row
 
■Total Row. The last row
 
■First Column. The leftmost column

240
Part I: Building Your Presentation
 
■Last Column. The rightmost column
 
■Banded Rows. Every other row formatted differently
 
■Banded Columns. Every other column formatted differently
With some of the styles, there is not a whole lot of difference between some of the settings. For example, you might 
have to look very closely to see the difference between First Column being turned on or off; ditto with Last Column 
and Total Row.
You can right-click one of the thumbnails in the Table Style gallery and choose Set as Default to change the default 
table style.
Formatting Table Cells
Although table styles provide a rough cut on the formatting, you might want to ﬁ ne-tune 
your table formatting as well. In the following sections you learn how to adjust various 
aspects of the table’s appearance.
Changing Row Height and Column Width
You might want a row to be a different height or a column a different width than others in 
the table. To resize a row or column, follow these steps:
 
1. Position the mouse pointer on the border below the row or to the right of the 
column that you want to resize. The mouse pointer turns into a line with arrows 
on each side of it.
 
2. Hold down the mouse button as you drag the row or column to a new height or 
width. A dotted line appears showing where it will go.
 
3. Release the mouse button.
You can also specify an exact height or width measurement using the Height and Width 
boxes in the Cell Size group on the Table Tools Layout tab. Select the row(s) or column(s) 
to affect, and then enter sizes in inches or use the increment buttons, as shown in 
Figure 8.11.
The Distribute Rows Evenly and Distribute Columns Evenly buttons in the Cell Size group 
(see Figure 8.11) adjust each row or column in the selected range so that the available space 
is occupied evenly among them. This is handy especially if you have drawn the table your-
self rather than allowed PowerPoint to create it initially. If PowerPoint creates the table, 
the rows and columns are already of equal height and width by default.

241
Chapter 8: Creating and Formatting Tables

You can also double-click between two columns to size the column to the left so that the 
text ﬁ ts exactly within the width.
FIGURE 8.11

Table Margins and Alignment
Remember, PowerPoint slides do not have any margins per se; everything is in a frame. An 
individual cell does have internal margins, however.
You can specify the internal margins for cells using the Cell Margins button on the Table 
Tools Layout tab, as follows:
 
1. Select the cells to which the setting should apply. To apply settings to the entire 
table, select the entire table.
 
2. Click Table Tools Layout ➪ Alignment ➪ Cell Margins. A menu of margin presets 
opens. 
 
3. Click one of the presets or choose Custom Margins, and then follow these steps: 
 
a. In the Cell Text Layout dialog box, set the Left, Right, Top, and Bottom margin 
settings, as shown in Figure 8.12.
 
b. Click OK.
FIGURE 8.12
You can set the internal margins on an individual cell basis for each side of the cell.

242
Part I: Building Your Presentation
Applying Borders
The border lines around the cells are very important because they separate the data in each 
cell from the data in other cells. By default (without a table style), there’s a 1-point border 
around each side of each cell, but you can make some or all borders thicker, a different line 
style (dashed, for example), or a different color, or remove them altogether to create your 
own effects. Here are some ideas:
 
■To make items appear to “ﬂ oat” in multiple columns on the slide (that is, to make 
it look as if they are not really in a table at all — just lined up extremely well), 
remove all table borders.
 
■To create a header row at the top without using the settings in the Table Style 
Options group, make the border beneath the ﬁ rst row of cells darker or thicker than 
the others.
 
■To make certain rows or columns appear as if they are outside of the table, turn off 
their borders on all sides except the side that faces the other cells.
 
■To make certain items appear as if they have been crossed off a list, format the 
cells they are in with diagonal borders. This creates the effect of an X running 
through each cell. These diagonal lines are not really borders in the sense that they 
don’t go around the edge of the cell, but they’re treated as borders in PowerPoint.
When you apply a top, bottom, left, or right border, those positions refer to the entire 
selected block of cells if you have more than one cell selected. For example, suppose you 
select two adjacent cells in a row and apply a left border. The border applies only to the 
leftmost of the two cells. If you want the same border applied to the line between the cells 
too, you must apply an inside vertical border.
To apply a border, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cell(s) that you want to affect.
 
2. In the Draw Borders group on the Table Tools Design tab, select a line style, 
width, and color from the Pen Style, Pen Weight, and Pen Color drop-down 
lists, shown in Figure 8.13.
FIGURE 8.13
Use the Draw Borders group’s lists to set the border’s style, thickness, and color.

243
Chapter 8: Creating and Formatting Tables

Try to use theme colors rather than fi xed colors whenever possible so that if you change to a different color theme 
later, the colors you originally chose won’t clash.
 
3. Open the Borders button’s menu in the Table Styles group and choose the sides 
of the selected area to which the new settings should apply. See Figure 8.14. 
For example, to apply the border to the bottom of the selected area, click Bottom 
Border. 
FIGURE 8.14
Select the side(s) to apply borders to for the chosen cells.
If you want to remove all borders from all sides, choose No Border from the menu.
 
4. If necessary, repeat step 3 to apply the border to other sides of the selection. 
Some of the choices on the Borders button’s menu apply to only one side; others 
apply to two or more at once.
Applying Fills
By default, table cells have a transparent background so that the color of the slide beneath 
shows through. When you apply a table style, as you learned earlier in the chapter, the 
style speciﬁ es a background color — or in some cases, multiple background colors depend-
ing on the options you choose for special treatment of certain rows or columns.

244
Part I: Building Your Presentation
You can also manually change the ﬁ ll for a table to make it either a solid color or a special 
ﬁ ll effect. You can apply this ﬁ ll to individual cells, or you can apply a background ﬁ ll for 
the entire table.
Filling Individual Cells
Each individual cell has its own ﬁ ll setting; in this way a table is like a collection of indi-
vidual object frames, rather than a single object. To set the ﬁ ll color for one or more cells, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cell(s) to affect, or to apply the same fill color to all cells, select the 
table’s outer frame.
 
2. On the Table Tools Design tab, click the down arrow next to the Shading button 
to open its palette.
 
3. Select the desired color or fill effect. See Figure 8.15.
FIGURE 8.15
Apply a fi ll effect to the selected cell(s).
 
For more on the various effects, see Chapter 9, “Drawing and Formatting Objects.” Also see “Filling a 
Table with a Picture” later in this chapter for some issues involving picture fi lls specifi c to tables.
For a semitransparent, solid-color fi ll, fi rst apply the fi ll and then right-click the cell and choose Format Shape. In 
the Format Shape dialog box, drag the Transparency slider. For some types of fi lls, you can also set the transparency 
when you initially apply the fi ll.

245
Chapter 8: Creating and Formatting Tables
8
Applying an Overall Table Fill
You can apply a solid color ﬁ ll to the entire table that is different from the ﬁ ll applied to 
the individual cells. The table’s ﬁ ll color is visible only in cells in which the individual ﬁ ll is 
set to No Fill (or a semitransparent ﬁ ll, in which case it blends).
To apply a ﬁ ll to the entire table, open the Shading button’s menu and point to Table 
Background, as shown in Figure 8.16, and then choose a color.
FIGURE 8.16
Apply a fi ll to the table’s background.
To test the new background, select some cells and choose No Fill for their ﬁ ll color. The 
background color appears in those cells. If you want to experiment further, try applying a 
semitransparent ﬁ ll to some cells, and see how the color of the background blends with the 
color of the cell’s ﬁ ll.

246
Part I: Building Your Presentation
Filling a Table with a Picture
When you ﬁ ll one or more cells with a picture, each cell gets its own individual copy of it. 
For example, if you ﬁ ll a table with a picture of a koala and the table has six cells, you get 
six koalas, as shown in Figure 8.17.
FIGURE 8.17
When you apply a picture fi ll to a table, each cell gets its own copy.
If you want a single copy of the picture to ﬁ ll the entire area behind the table, do the 
following:
 
1. Select the table’s outer frame.
 
2. Click Table Tools Design ➪ Table Styles ➪ Shading (down arrow) ➪ Table 
Background ➪ Picture. 
 
3. In the Insert Pictures dialog box, to use your own picture, click Browse and 
locate and select the picture. Or, to ﬁ nd a picture online, type a keyword for the 
picture in the Ofﬁ ce.com Clip Art box and press Enter, and then click the desired 
picture. 
Applying a Shadow to a Table
You can apply a shadow effect to a table so that it appears “raised” off the slide back-
ground. You can make it any color you like, and adjust a variety of settings for it.
If the cells have no fi ll, the shadow will apply to the gridlines, not to the table as a whole object.

2. Click Shape Options, and then click the Effects icon.
 
3. Click Shadow to expand that category, as shown in Figure 8.19.
 
4. Click the Presets button, and click the desired preset.
 
5. Click the Color button, and click the desired color.
 
6. (Optional) If desired, drag any of the sliders to fine-tune the shadow. These are 
covered in greater detail in Chapter 9.
 
7. Click Close to close the Format Shape task pane when you are finished.

Applying a 3-D Effect to a Table
PowerPoint does not enable you to apply 3-D effects to tables, so you have to fudge that by 
creating the 3-D effect with rectangles and then overlaying a transparent table on top of 
the shapes. As you can see in Figure 8.20, it’s a pretty convincing facsimile.
FIGURE 8.20
This 3-D table is actually a plain table with a 3-D rectangle behind it.

You might need to read Chapter 9 ﬁ rst to do some of these steps, but here’s the basic 
procedure: 
 
1. Create a rectangle from the Shapes group on the Insert tab, and apply a 3-D 
effect to it (from Drawing Tools Format ➪ Shape Styles ➪ Shape Effects ➪ 3-D 
Rotation). Use any effect you like. To create the traditional “box” appearance as in 
Figure 8.22, apply the second Oblique preset, and then in the 3-D Format options, 
increase the Depth setting to about 100 points. 
 
2. Size the rectangle so that its face is the same size as the table.
 
3. Click Drawing Tools Format ➪ Arrange ➪ Send Backward ➪ Send to Back to 
send the rectangle behind the table.
 
4. Set the table’s fill to No Fill if it is not already transparent.
 
5. (Optional) Set the table’s outer frame border to None to make its edges appear 
to blend with the edges of the rectangle. To do that, open the Borders button’s 
menu on the Table Tools Design tab and select Outside Borders to toggle that off.
Changing Text Alignment
If you followed the preceding steps to create the effect shown in Figure 8.20, you probably 
ran into a problem: Your text probably didn’t center itself in the cells. That’s because, by 
default, each cell’s vertical alignment is set to Top and horizontal alignment is set to Left.
Although the vertical and horizontal alignments are both controlled from the Alignment 
group on the Table Tools Layout tab, they actually have two different scopes. Vertical align-
ment applies to the entire cell as a whole, whereas horizontal alignment can apply differ-
ently to individual paragraphs within the cell. To set vertical alignment for a cell, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Select one or more cells to affect. To affect only one cell, you do not have to 
select it; just click inside it.
 
2. On the Table Tools Layout tab, in the Alignment group, click one of the 
vertical alignment buttons: Align Top, Center Vertically, or Align Bottom. See 
Figure 8.21.
FIGURE 8.21
Set the vertical and horizontal alignment of text from the Alignment group.

Vertical alignment

250
Part I: Building Your Presentation
To set the horizontal alignment for a paragraph, follow these steps:
 
1. Select one or more paragraphs to affect. If you select multiple cells, all para-
graphs within those cells are affected. If you click in a cell without selecting any-
thing, the change affects only the paragraph in which you clicked.
 
2. On the Table Tools Layout tab, in the Alignment group, click one of the hori-
zontal alignment buttons: Align Left, Center, or Align Right. See Figure 8.21. 
You can also use the paragraph alignment buttons on the Home tab for horizontal 
alignment or the buttons on the mini toolbar.
The horizontal alignments all have keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+L for left, Ctrl+E for center, and Ctrl+R for right.
Changing Text Direction
The default text direction for table cells is Horizontal, which reads from left to right (at 
least in countries where that’s how text is read). Figure 8.22 shows the alternatives.
FIGURE 8.22
You can set types of text direction.
To change the text direction for a cell, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cell(s) to affect. To affect only a single cell, move the insertion point 
into it.
 
2. On the Table Tools Layout tab, click Text Direction.
 
3. Select a text direction from the menu that appears.
You cannot set text direction for individual paragraphs; the setting applies to the entire cell.

251
Chapter 8: Creating and Formatting Tables

Using Tables from Word
If a table already exists in Word, you can copy it into PowerPoint. PowerPoint will convert 
the Word table to a PowerPoint table. From that point on, it is a part of the presentation, 
and maintains no relationship to Word. You can edit its text directly in PowerPoint.
To paste a table from Word to PowerPoint, copy it to the Clipboard (Ctrl+C) in Word, and 
then paste it onto a slide in PowerPoint (Ctrl+V). The resulting table appears in the center 
of the slide.
When you copy a table from Word to PowerPoint, you might need to increase the font size; Word’s default size for 
body text is great for printed documents but too small for most PowerPoint slides.
A pasted Word table is placed into a content placeholder on the slide if an appropriate one 
is available. Here are the basic rules for what goes on:
 
■If the slide has an appropriate content placeholder that is empty, the table is 
placed into it but retains its own size and shape.
 
■If the slide does not have an appropriate empty content placeholder, the table is 
inserted as a free-ﬂ oating object, unrelated to any placeholders.
Word’s table feature is somewhat more robust than PowerPoint’s. If you want to maintain 
all the Word capabilities in the table, paste the table as a Word object instead of doing a 
regular paste. Follow these steps:
 
1. Copy the table in Word (Ctrl+C).
 
2. In PowerPoint, display the slide on which the table should be pasted.
 
3. On the Home tab, open the Paste button’s menu and click Paste Special. The 
Paste Special dialog box opens.
 
4. Click the Paste option button.
 
5. In the As list, choose Microsoft Office Word Document Object. See Figure 8.23.
 
6. Click OK. The table appears as a free-ﬂ oating object (not in any placeholder).
You can also use the Paste Options button that appears immediately after you paste the 
table. Click the third icon: Embed. See Figure 8.24.
The resulting table is an embedded object and cannot be edited directly using PowerPoint’s 
table feature. To edit the object, you must double-click it to open it in Word.

252
Part I: Building Your Presentation
To maintain a dynamic link between the Word fi le and the PowerPoint presentation, choose Paste Link instead of 
Paste in step 4. However, be aware that if you move the Word fi le, an error will appear in PowerPoint when it cannot 
fi nd the fi le referenced in the link. See Chapter 13, “Incorporating Content from Other Programs,” for more informa-
tion about linking and embedding. 
FIGURE 8.23

Integrating Excel Cells into PowerPoint
If you need the calculating capabilities in a table, consider embedding Excel cells into the 
slide instead of using a traditional PowerPoint table.

253
Chapter 8: Creating and Formatting Tables

Object linking and embedding is covered in detail in Chapter 13, but here’s a quick look at 
how to use Excel from within PowerPoint: 
 
1. Display the slide on which you want to place the Excel cells.
 
2. If desired, select a placeholder into which the table should be placed.
 
3. On the Insert tab, click the Table button, and on its menu, choose Excel 
Spreadsheet. A small frame with a few cells of an Excel spreadsheet appears, and 
the Ribbon changes to the tabs and tools for Excel. See Figure 8.25.
FIGURE 8.25
An Excel object can substitute for a table grid and can provide Excel-specifi c capabilities.
Don’t worry that an Excel object you insert does not seem to be correctly aligned at the top and left. The cell row and 
column labels appear as you edit, and they disappear when you click away from the object. 
 
4. If desired, enlarge the Excel object by doing the following: 
 
a. Click once on the Excel object’s border to select it. Black selection handles 
appear around it.
 
b. Drag a corner selection handle to enlarge the area of the object.

254
Part I: Building Your Presentation
 
5. Create the table using Excel’s tools and features.
 
6. (Optional) If there are unused cells, resize the object again (using its selection 
handles) so that they are not visible.
 
7. Click away from the object to deselect it and return to PowerPoint.
You’ve just created an embedded Excel object. It does not exist outside of this PowerPoint 
ﬁ le; it’s a mini-Excel spreadsheet that you use just for this one presentation. If you want 
to embed content from an existing Excel ﬁ le, copy and paste it as in the earlier section 
on Word tables, or see Chapter 13 for more information about your options for linking and 
embedding content. 
Summary
In this chapter, you learned the ins and outs of creating and formatting tables in 
PowerPoint, including how to insert, draw, move, and resize the various cells of a table as 
well as how to add ﬁ lls, styles, and effects. You also learned how to integrate Excel cells 
into your PowerPoint slides. In the next chapter, you learn how to draw and format objects.

Applying object borders and fi lls and effects
E
verything on a slide is a separate object. An object is anything that is in its own rectangular 
frame and can be moved, sized, and formatted independently. For example, each drawn shape 
is an object, as is each text box and each chart, diagram, and clip art image. So far in this 
book, you’ve learned about several types of objects that you can format with borders, shading, and 
other special effects, including text boxes and tables. In upcoming chapters, you learn about even 
more types of objects that you can format, such as SmartArt, charts, and clip art.
Most of the manipulation that you can apply to an object is the same, regardless of the object 
type. Rather than repeat the details for formatting each object type in individual chapters, almost 
everything you need to know about object formatting can be found in this chapter. You will prac-
tice these techniques on drawn lines and shapes, and in the process you will learn about the draw-
ing tools. You can then apply these same techniques to text boxes and to virtually every type of 
graphic object that PowerPoint supports.
Working with the Drawing Tools
PowerPoint comes with a set of drawing tools that allow you to create simple lines and shapes on 
your slides. The graphics that you create with these tools are called shapes. (Lines are also called 
shapes, which seems counterintuitive, but there it is.) 
The drawing tools create simple, line-based vector graphics, each of which is a separate object on 
the slide. For example, if you make a drawing that consists of four rectangles, an oval, and several 
lines, you can move and resize each of these objects separately. You can stack them to create a 
CHAPTER 9

258
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
more complex drawing, format each one individually, and even group and merge them to 
create a single object that you can format, move, and resize as a single unit.
 
To learn how to group shapes, see “Working with Object Groups” later in this chapter. Merging shapes 
is new in PowerPoint 2013; to learn about it, see “Merging Shapes” later in this chapter.
A vector graphic is one that is based on a mathematical formula, such as one you would 
work with in geometry class. For example, if you draw a vector graphic line, PowerPoint 
stores the line start point, line endpoint, and line properties (width, color, and so on) as 
numeric values. When you move or resize the line, PowerPoint updates these numbers. Most 
clip-art images are also vector graphics. In contrast, a scanned image or a photo is a bitmap 
graphic, in which each individual colored pixel is represented by a separate numeric value. 
This is why bitmap ﬁ les are so much larger than vector ﬁ les — because there are more val-
ues to track.
Here are the most important advantages of using vector graphics:
 
■Size. Vector graphics ﬁ les do not require much storage space because not every 
pixel of the image needs to be represented numerically.
 
■Scalability. When you resize a vector graphic, the math is recalculated and the 
shape is redrawn. This means that the picture is never distorted and its lines never 
become jagged the way bitmap graphics do.
The main drawback to vector graphics is their lack of realism. No matter how good an artist 
you are, a vector graphic will always have a ﬂ at, cartoonish quality to it.
3-D graphics programs such as AutoCAD are also based on vector graphics. They start out with a wireframe image of 
a 3-D object (such as a cube), combine it with other wireframe images to make an object, and then use a rendering 
tool to cover the wireframe with a color, pattern, or texture that makes it look more like a real object. Most computer 
games also use vector graphics.
Drawing Lines and Shapes
The drawing tools in PowerPoint are the same as in other Ofﬁ ce applications. For example, 
Word and Excel both have identical toolsets. The Shapes button appears on the Insert tab, 
and you can click it to open a menu of the available shapes, as shown in Figure 9.1.
To draw a shape, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the desired shape from the Shapes palette (Figure 9.1).
 
2. (Optional) To constrain the dimensions of the shape — for example, to force a 
rectangle to be a square — hold down the Shift key.
 
3. Drag to draw the shape. A silhouette of the shape appears as you drag. Release the 
mouse button when you have the shape you want.

259
Chapter 9: Drawing and Formatting Objects
9
FIGURE 9.1
Select a shape from the Shapes list.
The preceding steps work well for most shapes, but there are a few special cases in which 
the drawing process works a little differently. The following sections explain these 
differences.
You can resize the Shapes menu by dragging its bottom-right corner.
More shapes are available through Microsoft’s online clip art collection. When searching for clip-art images (see 
Chapter 11, “Working With Clip Art and Photos”), use AutoShape as the keyword; you will see many more shapes, 
including ones that look like various types of offi ce furniture and computers (which are useful in offi ce plans).
To draw multiple objects of the same shape, you can lock the drawing tool on. Instead of clicking the shape to 
select it in the Shapes palette, right-click it and choose Lock Drawing Mode. It then stays on until you press Esc to 
turn it off.

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Straight or Curved Lines
The drawing tools include several types of lines, as shown in Figure 9.2. Here are some tips 
for using some of the line tools:
FIGURE 9.2

■Straight line. Click the start point and then click the endpoint. The line is now 
complete and the tool turns off. You can also draw lines with arrows at one or both 
ends.
 
■Straight (elbow) connector. Click and hold at the start point, and then drag to the 
endpoint. You can adjust the position of the elbow by dragging the yellow diamond 
in the center. If you click and release at the start point, a default size connector 
appears, which you can then move or resize. You can also draw lines with arrows at 
one or both ends.
 
■Curved connector. Click and hold at the start point, and then drag to the end-
point. Click a second time to complete the line. You can adjust the shape of the 
curve by dragging the yellow diamond in the center. If you click and release at the 
start point, a default size connector appears, which you can then move or resize. 
You can also draw lines with arrows at one or both ends.
 
■Curve. This is a freeform, multisegment curve. Click the start point, click again to 
create a second point, and then click again to create more points. Between points, 
drag the mouse pointer to adjust the curve. When you are ﬁ nished, double-click 
the mouse.
 
■Scribble. This is a freeform line. Hold down the mouse button and drag to draw; 
release the mouse button to ﬁ nish.
Freeform Shapes
The Freeform tool is in the Lines group (Figure 9.2), but it actually draws shapes consisting 
of multiple straight-line segments. It enables you to draw each line segment one by one, 
with the mouse pointer functioning as a pencil. To use this tool, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the Shapes palette and click the Freeform button.
 
2. Click to place the start point, and then release the mouse button.

261
Chapter 9: Drawing and Formatting Objects
9
 
3. Click another location to place the next point. A line appears between the two 
points. Repeat this step as needed to create more points.
 
4. End the shape: 
 
■For an open shape, double-click where you want to place the ﬁ nal point.
 
■For a closed shape, click the start point again as the ﬁ nal point.
You can ﬁ ne-tune a freeform shape by adjusting its points. You can also convert existing 
shapes to freeform ones that you can then adjust point by point.
 
See the section “Editing a Shape’s Points” in this chapter for more information about shape editing.
Flow-Chart Connectors
Flow-chart shapes are just ordinary shapes that happen to correspond to those used in 
standard ﬂ ow charts.
To experiment with ﬂ ow-chart connectors, draw a couple of shapes (any closed shapes) and 
then draw a straight line or an elbow connector between them. As you move the mouse 
pointer over the edge of the ﬁ rst shape, certain points on the shape, like the corners, show 
small markers, indicating they are valid attachment points for the line. Click to anchor one 
end of the line there. Drag to draw the line to the other shape, and when the mouse pointer 
gets there, small gray squares on that shape’s border appear to show its valid attachment 
points. Finish dragging the line to one of those points to complete the connection. When 
you move one of the shapes, the connector line moves as needed to keep the connection.
When there is a completed connection between two shapes, both ends of the line show 
green circles when the line is connected, as in Figure 9.3. When one end is disconnected 
from a shape, that end of the line appears with a plain white square on its endpoint, rather 
than a green circle.
FIGURE 9.3
Connectors have green circles on the ends when they are connected.

262
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Connecting a line to a shape offers two advantages. One advantage is that you don’t have 
to adjust the line exactly so that it touches the shape but does not overlap it. It lines up 
perfectly with the edge of the shape at all times. Another advantage is that if you move 
the shape, the line moves with it, changing its length and angle as needed so that the line 
remains anchored at both ends. All shapes can be connected, not just the ones from the 
Flow Chart group. 
Callouts
A callout is a regular shape except it has a resizable point on it that can be dragged to point 
to other objects. Drag the yellow square selection handle on the callout shape to move its 
point.
Action Buttons
An action button is a type of drawing object that has an action associated with it. When 
users click the action button during the presentation, something happens. For example, 
perhaps a certain slide appears, an external program launches, or a sound plays.
The main difference between placing an action button and placing other types of drawing 
objects is that after you draw the action button, an Action Settings dialog box appears, 
prompting you for the action.
 
You can learn how to use the Action Settings dialog box in Chapter 20, “Preparing a Presentation for 
Mass Distribution.”
Choosing a Different Shape
If you chose the wrong shape to draw, it’s easier to just delete the shape and start over 
if you have not applied any special formatting to it. However, if you have formatted the 
shape already, you might ﬁ nd it easier to change the shape rather than re-create it. To do 
so, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the shape to select it.
 
2. Click Drawing Tools Format ➪ Insert Shapes and then click the Edit Shape but-
ton and choose Change Shape from the menu. The same palette of shapes appears 
as when you initially created the shape, as shown in Figure 9.4. 
 
3. Click the new shape that you want.
Lines cannot be changed using the Change Shape command. You must right-click them and choose Connector Types 
to change their type, and you can only change between a straight connector, elbow connector, and curved connector.

263
Chapter 9: Drawing and Formatting Objects

FIGURE 9.4
Use the Change Shape option in the Edit Shape drop-down menu to reselect a shape.
Editing a Shape’s Points
Each shape consists of a series of points that are connected with straight or curved lines. 
You can adjust the positions of these points to change the shape of the object.  Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Select the shape.
 
2. On the Drawing Tools Format tab, open the Edit Shape drop-down menu (see 
Figure 9.4) and select Edit Points. The selection handles on the shape turn black, 
indicating that they can be moved individually.
You can also right-click the shape and choose Edit Points.
 
3. Drag one or more of the selection handles (see Figure 9.5) to change the shape.
 
4. Click away from the shape or press Esc.

264
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 9.5

 PowerPoint 2013 enables you to merge multiple shapes together to create more complex shapes than 
you might feel comfortable drawing on your own or creating by dragging a shape’s points. To learn 
about combining shapes, see “Merging Shapes” later in this chapter.
Adding Text to a Shape
You can use almost all of the closed shapes in PowerPoint as text boxes. PowerPoint recog-
nizes a manually created text box as a variation on a rectangle with some text in it. As a 
result, you can just as easily place text in a shape of any other type. To add text to a shape, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the shape and choose Edit Text.
 
2. Click inside the shape. A ﬂ ashing insertion point appears inside the shape. 
 
3. Type the desired text.
You can also use the Text Box button to insert a new blank text box from the Drawing Tools Format tab, independent 
of any existing shape. Instead of clicking inside a shape in step 3, click a blank area of the slide and begin typing 
to create a new text box. A text box is just a rectangular shape with no border or fi ll. You can change it to a differ-
ent shape by selecting from the Edit Shape ➪ Change Shape menu, as shown in the section “Choosing a Different 
Shape” earlier in this chapter. You can then apply a shape style, as explained in the section “Applying Shape or 
Picture Styles” later in this chapter, or apply a custom border or fi ll to it.
Text wraps within a shape automatically, in a rectangular area. If the shape is irregular, 
PowerPoint ﬁ nds the largest available rectangular area within its center and conﬁ nes the 
text to that area. If you have adjusted the shape’s points, the text wrapping inside the 
shape may not look right. For example, in Figure 9.6, the sides of the arrow have been 
pulled in a bit manually, but the original text area still applies, resulting in some overhang 
of the text. To correct this, you can manually insert line breaks where you want them by 
pressing Shift+Enter.

265
Chapter 9: Drawing and Formatting Objects

FIGURE 9.6
If the text overfl ows the shape (left), press Shift+Enter to insert line breaks where needed 
(right).
Selecting Objects
No matter what type of object you are dealing with, you can select it by clicking it with the 
mouse. Selection handles that look like white squares appear around the object, as shown 
in Figure 9.7.
FIGURE 9.7
Selection handles appear around a selected object.
You have already learned that you can select a single object by clicking it. However, some-
times you might want to select multiple objects so that you can act upon them as a single 
unit. For example, suppose you have drawn several shapes and you want to select them as a 
group so that you can move them or apply the same formatting to them.
To select more than one object, click the ﬁ rst one to select it, and then hold down the Shift 
key as you click additional objects. They all become selected.

266
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Holding down the Ctrl key when you select multiple objects also does the same thing as Shift; however, if you hold 
down the Ctrl key and drag, it makes a copy of the original item. This is why it’s better to use the Shift key than the 
Ctrl key for selecting multiple objects — so that you don’t accidentally make copies by dragging the item.
If you can’t easily click each object (perhaps because they are overlapping one another), 
an easy way to select a whole group is to drag the cursor around them. For example, if you 
wanted to select several stacked shapes, you would drag the cursor over them to select 
them all, as follows: Simply click and hold down the mouse button above and to the left 
of the objects, and drag down and to the right until you create a box around them. This is 
called lassoing, as you learned in Chapter 8. The box adds a light-blue shading over the top 
of the area, as shown in Figure 9.8. Then, release the mouse button. All objects that were 
entirely inside the boundary that you drew are selected, as shown in Figure 9.9.
FIGURE 9.8
Hold down the mouse button and drag a box that includes all of the shapes that you want 
to select.
Dragging from the top left to the bottom right is just one way of selecting the group; for example, you can also drag 
from the lower right to the upper left if you prefer.
FIGURE 9.9
Each selected object displays its own selection handles.

267
Chapter 9: Drawing and Formatting Objects

Another way to select objects is with the Selection pane. To display this pane, click 
Home ➪ Editing ➪ Selection Pane. In the Selection pane, you can click any object’s name 
to select it or hold down the Ctrl key and click multiple objects to select them. Figure 9.10 
shows three selected objects.
FIGURE 9.10
The Selection pane assists you in selecting objects.
Selection
task pane
The Selection pane does more than just select objects. For example, you can use the Bring 
Forward and Send Backward arrow buttons at the top of the pane to change the stacking of 
objects, which is also covered later in this chapter in the section “Layering Objects.” You 
can also click the eye icon next to an object to toggle its display on or off in the slide. This 
provides a way of temporarily hiding an object without affecting its presence or position on 
the slide.
If you have more than one of a certain type of object, PowerPoint names them generically in the Selection pane — for 
example, Oval 22, Isosceles Triangle 23, and so on. It is easier to keep track of which shape is which if you change 
their names to something more meaningful. To change the name of an object, click its name in the Selection pane, 
and then click it again. The insertion point appears inside the name, and you can edit it. Having recognizable names 
for objects also helps when you are sequencing their animation (covered in Chapter 16, “Creating Animation Effects 
and Transitions”).

268
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Deleting Objects
To delete an object, the easiest way is to select it and then press the Delete key on the key-
board. To delete more than one object at once, you can select multiple objects before press-
ing the Delete key.
You can also right-click the selected object or objects and choose Cut. When you cut 
an object, it is not the same as deleting it; the Cut command moves the object to the 
Clipboard, so that you can use the Paste command to place it somewhere else. However, if 
you cut something and then never paste it, this is actually the same as deleting it.
Moving and Copying Objects
You can move or copy objects anywhere you like: within a single slide, from one slide to 
another, or from one presentation to another. You can even copy or move an object to a 
completely different program, such as Word or Excel.
Within a Slide
To move an object on a slide, you can simply drag it with the mouse. Just position the 
mouse pointer over any part of the object except for a handle. When the mouse pointer 
changes to a four-headed arrow, drag the object to a new location. To copy by dragging, 
hold down the Ctrl key as you drag the object.
Holding down the Shift key as you drag constrains the movement of the object, making it possible to drag it only hori-
zontally or only vertically.
To copy an object on a slide using the Clipboard, use the Copy command. Select the object 
and press Ctrl+C to copy it, or click the Copy button on the Home tab. Then, press Ctrl+V to 
paste the object, or click the Paste button on the Home tab. You can then drag the copy to 
wherever you want it on the slide.
Whenever you need to cut, copy, or paste, you have a variety of methods to choose from. There are the Cut, Copy, and 
Paste buttons on the Home tab; the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands on the right-click menu; and the shortcut key 
combinations, Cut (Ctrl+X), Copy (Ctrl+C), and Paste (Ctrl+V).
Ctrl+D works as a combination Copy-and-Paste command by duplicating the object or objects that you have selected.

269
Chapter 9: Drawing and Formatting Objects
9
From One Slide to Another
To move an object to a different slide, cutting and pasting works best. Select the object and 
press Ctrl+X, or click Cut on the Home tab. Then display the slide on which you want the 
object to appear, and press Ctrl+V, or click Paste on the Home tab.
To copy an object to a different slide without removing it from the original slide, you can 
do the same thing except that you need to use the Copy command (Ctrl+C or Copy button) 
instead of the Cut command.
If you want an object to appear in the same spot on every slide in the presentation, add the object to the slide master 
rather than trying to copy it onto every slide. See Chapter 4, “Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters,” for more 
information.
When you copy and paste an object onto the same slide, the copy is offset from the original to allow for easy selec-
tion. When you copy and paste an object onto a different slide, the copy appears in the same position as the original.
From One Presentation to Another
To move or copy from one presentation to another, use the Cut, Copy, and Paste commands. 
First, select the object, and then cut or copy it. Display the destination slide (in normal 
view) in the other presentation, and then paste.
An object that you move or copy to a different presentation might change its color because the destination fi le is 
using a different color theme. This is because objects with colors from a color theme rather than colors defi ned by a 
fi xed color will change colors when you apply a different theme or template.
To Another Program
You can also move and copy objects from PowerPoint into other programs. For example, sup-
pose that you have created a table on a slide and you want to include it in a report in Word. 
You can move or copy it to a Word document by cutting and pasting. For more information 
on tables, see Chapter 8, “Creating and Formatting Tables.”
Depending on the object and the destination application, copying and pasting usually results in smaller fi le sizes 
than dragging and dropping.

Using the Offi ce Clipboard
The Microsoft Ofﬁ ce Clipboard lets you store more than one object at a time. You can copy 
or cut multiple objects to the Clipboard and then paste them all into the same or different 
locations afterward. To use the Clipboard in multi-clip mode, click the dialog box launcher 
for the Clipboard group on the Home tab. The Clipboard pane appears.
As you copy or cut items, they appear on a list in the Clipboard pane. When you want to 
paste an item, display the slide on which you want to paste it — position the insertion 
point at the desired location if the item is text — and then click the item in the Clipboard 
pane. The Clipboard can hold up to 24 items. To remove an item, click the drop-down arrow 
next to it and choose Delete, as shown in Figure 9.11.
FIGURE 9.11
Move or copy multiple items using the Clipboard pane.
Click arrow next to a
clip to open its menu.
Click the Options button at the bottom of the Clipboard pane to display a list of on/off toggles that you can set for 
Clipboard operation. For example, you can specify that the Clipboard pane appears automatically when you press 
Ctrl+C twice in a row and whether it displays an icon on the taskbar when it is active.
Understanding Object Formatting
Up until this point, we’ve considered all objects to be equal, but there are actually two 
major classes of objects that PowerPoint supports: those that you create from within 
PowerPoint and those that you import from other sources. Each object type causes a differ-
ent version of the Format tab to display when you select it.
For drawn shapes, charts, SmartArt, and text boxes, the Drawing Tools Format tab in Figure 
9.12 appears. From here you can apply shape styles, as well as WordArt formatting, to the 
text within the object.

271
Chapter 9: Drawing and Formatting Objects
9
FIGURE 9.12
For drawn objects, charts, and text boxes, these formatting options are available.
SmartArt has some formatting features in common with drawn shapes and charts, but it also has some special fea-
tures and quirks of its own. For more information, see Chapter 10, “Creating SmartArt Graphics.”
For photos and clip art, the Picture Tools Format tab in Figure 9.13 appears. It focuses on 
applying ﬁ lters through which you view the image (such as brightness and contrast) and 
applying Picture Styles that affect the shape and border of the frame.
FIGURE 9.13
For photos and clip art, these formatting options are available.
Both of these versions of the Format tab (Drawing Tools and Picture Tools) have Size and 
Arrange groups that work the same way.
The following sections explain how to apply formatting to the two types of objects, by 
using the Drawing Tools Format tab or the Picture Tools Format tab. Some features are 
unique to one object type or the other; other features can be used for both types, although 
some features that do basically the same thing have different names, depending on the 
object type.
Resizing Objects
Let’s start with something that all objects have in common: resizing. You can resize any 
object on a slide, either by dragging a selection handle on its border or by using the Size 
group in the Format tab.
In Chapter 3, “Creating Slides and Text Boxes,” you learned how to resize a text box; you 
can resize any object in this same way, simply by dragging a corner or side selection handle 

272
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
to change the object’s size and shape. The mouse pointer changes to a double-headed arrow 
when you move it over a selection handle. 
Some objects, such as photos, maintain their aspect ratio by default when you resize them using a corner selection 
handle. In other words, the ratio of height to width does not change when you resize using the corner selection han-
dles. If you want to distort the object by changing its aspect ratio, drag one of the side selection handles instead of a 
corner one. Other objects, such as drawn shapes, do not maintain the aspect ratio unless you hold down the Shift key 
as you drag a corner selection handle.
You can also size an object by using the increment buttons to change the values in the Size 
group on the Format tab or by typing numbers directly into these text boxes.
Alternatively, you can click the dialog box launcher for the Size group to open a Format 
Shape (or Format Picture) task pane with the Size tab settings, from which you can enter a 
height and width, the same as you would in the Size group on the Ribbon (see Figure 9.14). 
This same dialog box is available for all object types, although more of the options are 
available for photos than for drawn objects. Figure 9.14 shows the dialog box for a photo. 
For a drawn object, some of the Scale options are unavailable, as well as the Crop From and 
Original Size sections.
FIGURE 9.14
Adjust an object’s size from the Size settings in the Format Shape (or Format Picture) task 
pane or from the Size controls on the Format tab.

Width

273
Chapter 9: Drawing and Formatting Objects

An advantage of using the task pane is that you can adjust the scale of the object by a per-
centage. For example, you can shrink the object to 45 percent of its original size by chang-
ing its Scale Height and Scale Width values to 45 percent each. This feature is more useful 
for photos than for drawn objects, but it works for all object types.
For imported objects only — such as photos, clip art, and so on — you can also set these 
scale options:
 
■Relative to Original Picture Size. The measurements in the Scale Height and Scale 
Width boxes refer to the original picture size if you select this option; otherwise, 
they refer to the previous size of the picture.
 
■Best Scale for Slide Show. When you select this option, PowerPoint adjusts the 
picture size to match the resolution at which you show the presentation, as you 
have speciﬁ ed in the Resolution drop-down list.
The Original Size section is also available only for imported objects. You can click the Reset 
button in this section to reset the object back to the size that it was when you initially 
placed it on the slide.
Arranging Objects
Arranging is another action that you can perform with all object types. For example, you 
can specify an object’s position in relation to the slide or to other objects, change the 
stacking order, rotate the object, group or merge it with other objects, and much more.
Rotating and Flipping Objects
Most objects display a circle at the top when you select them; this is called the rotation 
handle. See Figure 9.15. You can drag it to rotate the object. This action is called free rota-
tion because there is no precise numeric measurement that is related to the amount of rota-
tion, although by holding down the Shift key while rotating, you can rotate the object by 
15-degree increments.
You can also rotate an object by exactly 90 degrees. To do so, click the Rotate button on the 
Format tab and select Rotate Right 90° or Rotate Left 90°, as shown in Figure 9.16.
On this same menu, you can also ﬂ ip an object either vertically or horizontally. Flipping 
is different from rotating in that it creates a mirror image of the object, not just a rotated 
version.
To set a precise amount of rotation for an object, use the Rotation text box in the Format 
Shape (or Format Picture) task pane, shown in Figure 9.14. Use the increment buttons to 
increase or decrease the rotation amount, or enter a precise number of degrees.

Aligning or Distributing Objects
PowerPoint provides many different ways to precisely position objects in relation to one 
another. There are grids, guides, Smart Guides, and several commands for alignment and 
distribution.
Here are some examples of what you can do:
 
■You can align an object to the top, bottom, left, right, or center of a slide.
 
■You can align two or more objects in relation to one another so that they are at the 
same vertical or horizontal position.
 
■You can distribute three or more objects so that the spacing between them is even.

275
Chapter 9: Drawing and Formatting Objects

Snapping Objects to a Grid
There is an invisible grid on every slide to which all objects snap. If you move an object and 
position it so that it doesn’t quite align with the gridlines, when you release the object, 
it moves slightly to snap into alignment with the nearest gridlines. If PowerPoint doesn’t 
seem to be doing that, the Snap feature may be turned off. 
To turn snapping on or off, follow these steps:
 
1. On the View tab, click the dialog box launcher for the Show group. The Grid and 
Guides dialog box opens.
 
2. Mark or clear the Snap Objects to Grid option, shown in Figure 9.17.
FIGURE 9.17
Choose whether or not to snap objects to the grid.
 
3. Click OK.
If snapping to the grid is turned on but you want to bypass it for a specifi c operation, hold down the Alt key as you 
drag the object. The object moves smoothly, unencumbered by the grid.
To display or hide the alignment grid on the screen, select or deselect the Display Grid on 
Screen option in the Grid and Guides dialog box (Figure 9.17), or mark or clear the Guides 
check box on the View tab. To change the grid spacing, enter the desired amount in the 
Spacing text box.
Using Guides
Guides are nonprinting vertical or horizontal lines that you can move around on the slide 
to help you gauge where an object should be positioned. To turn the display of guides off 
or on, mark or clear the Guides check box on the View tab, or right-click the slide, point to 
Grid and Guides, and click Guides. By default there is one vertical and one horizontal guide-
line when guides are displayed; to add more, right-click the slide, point to Grid and Guides, 

276
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
and click Add Vertical Guide or Add Horizontal Guide. You can drag guides to reposition 
them on the slide as you work. An object will also snap to the guide if you drop the object 
near the guide. New in PowerPoint 2013, you can add permanent custom guides to the Slide 
Masters too. See Chapter 4 for details. 
Using Smart Guides
PowerPoint also has a Smart Guides feature, which pops up temporary guidelines to help you 
to align objects with one another as you are dragging. Smart Guides give you the beneﬁ t of 
guide without having to have the regular guides displayed all the time.
When one object’s top, bottom, or middle starts to be nearly aligned with an adjacent 
object, a dotted line appears showing where the alignment point would be, so you can ﬁ nd 
it easily. The object also snaps into alignment with that dotted line when you drop it any-
where near the dotted line. See Figure 9.18.
FIGURE 9.18
Smart Guides are dotted lines that help you align one object with another.
Smart Guide
To turn the Smart Guides feature on or off, right-click the slide, point to Grid and Guides so 
that a submenu appears, and click Smart Guides.
Nudging Objects
If you are one of those people who have a hard time positioning objects precisely when 
you drag them, you’ll appreciate the Nudge command. It moves an object slightly in the 
direction that you want without altering it in the other plane. For example, suppose you 
have positioned a text box in exactly the spot you want vertically but a little bit too far 
to the right. If you drag it manually, you might accidentally change the vertical position. 
Instead, you can press an arrow key to move it. Hold down Ctrl to override snapping to 
the grid.
Nudging moves the object one space on the grid when you have enabled the Snap Objects 
to Grid option. (See the section, “Snapping Objects to a Grid” earlier in this chapter.) When 
the Snap Objects to Grid option is turned off, you can nudge the object one pixel at a time.

277
Chapter 9: Drawing and Formatting Objects
9
Certain objects, such as SmartArt, will sometimes refuse to be moved (including by nudging) after you have applied a 
3-D Quick Style with a perspective view. To move such an object, click Edit in 2-D on the SmartArt Tools Format tab. 
You can then move the object. Afterward, you can click Edit in 2-D again to toggle it back to its regular 3-D appear-
ance. Charts are quirky that way too; before you can nudge a chart, you have to Ctrl+click it to select it.
Nudge buttons are not available on the Ribbon. However, if you would like, you can add them to the Quick Access 
Toolbar, or you can customize the Ribbon to include them. See Chapter 22, “Customizing PowerPoint,” for more details.
Aligning an Object in Relation to the Slide
You can align objects in relation to the slide itself. For example, you might want an object 
to be centered vertically and horizontally on the slide. To align a single object in relation to 
the slide, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the object.
 
2. Click Format ➪ Arrange ➪ Align Objects, and make sure the Align to Slide com-
mand has a check mark next to it. If it doesn’t, click the command to place one 
there.
 
3. Click Align Objects again if the menu is not already open and choose one of the 
horizontal alignment commands: Align Left, Align Center, or Align Right, as 
shown in Figure 9.19.
FIGURE 9.19
Choose an alignment for the object in relation to the slide.
 
4. Click Align again and choose one of the vertical alignment commands: Align 
Top, Align Middle, or Align Bottom.

278
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Aligning Two or More Objects with One Another
You can align two objects in relation to one another by assigning the same setting to both 
objects. For example, in the left illustration in Figure 9.20, the objects are in their starting 
positions. The right illustration shows what happens when you use the Align Top command 
to move the lower object to the same vertical position as the higher one. If you use Align 
Bottom, the higher object moves to match the lower one. If you use Align Center, both 
objects move to split the difference between their two positions.
FIGURE 9.20
The original positioning (left) and the positioning after you apply the Align Top command 
(right)
To align two or more objects with one another, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the objects.
 
2. Click Format ➪ Arrange ➪ Align Objects, and make sure Align Selected Objects 
is selected. If it’s not, click it to select it.
 
3. Click the Align button again to reopen the menu if needed, and choose the 
desired alignment, either vertical or horizontal.
If you use the Align Top command and the objects move to the very top of the slide, you probably have selected the 
Align to Slide option. Undo (Ctrl+Z) the action and try again.
Distributing Objects
Distribution works only in relation to the slide or with three or more objects selected. When 
you distribute objects, you spread them evenly over a given space. For example, suppose 
you align three boxes vertically and now you want to even out the space between each box, 
as shown in Figure 9.21. You can apply the Distribute Horizontally command to create the 
uniform spacing. To distribute objects, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the objects. To do so, hold down the Shift key while you click each one, or 
drag an outline that encircles all of the objects.
 
2. Click Format ➪ Arrange ➪ Align Objects, and then click either Distribute 
Vertically or Distribute Horizontally.

279
Chapter 9: Drawing and Formatting Objects

FIGURE 9.21
The original positioning (left) and the positioning after applying the Distribute Horizontally 
command (right)
If you have only two objects selected, you cannot distribute them unless you have already 
selected Align to Slide.
Layering Objects
You can stack objects on top of each other to create special effects. For example, you 
might create a logo by stacking a text box on top of an oval or a rectangle, as shown in 
Figure 9.22.
FIGURE 9.22
You can create all kinds of logos, artwork, and other special effects by layering objects.
Text box in front
Drawn shape in back
 
To create a text box, see Chapter 3.
You can also type text directly into a drawn shape without using layering; simply right-click the shape and choose Edit 
Text. You can also just begin typing while the shape is selected.
By default, objects stack in the order in which you create them. For example, in Figure 9.22, 
the text box appears over the shape because the shape was created ﬁ rst, and so it is on the 
bottom of the stack. You can move the shape, but it will continue to be on the layer under 
the text box.

280
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
If you need to reorder the objects in a stack, follow these steps:
 
1. Click an object in the stack.
 
2. Use one of the buttons in the Arrange group on the Format tab: 
 
■Click Bring Forward to bring the object forward one position in the stack.
 
■Open the Bring Forward drop-down menu and choose Bring to Front to bring the 
object to the top of the stack.
 
■Click Send Backward to send the object backward one position in the stack.
 
■Open the Send Backward drop-down menu and choose Send to Back to send the 
object to the bottom of the stack.
 
3. Repeat the steps to change the position of other objects in the stack as needed.
Another way to reorder object stacking is to use the Selection pane:
 
1. Click Home ➪ Editing ➪ Select ➪ Selection Pane to display the Selection pane.
 
2. Click an object’s name on the list.
 
3. Click the Bring Forward (up arrow) or Send Backward (down arrow) button to 
move the object up or down in the stacking order.
Working with Object Groups
You have already learned how to select multiple objects and work with them as a single 
unit. For example, you might select several shapes together that collectively form a picture 
that you have drawn. If you intend to treat these objects as a single unit, you can save 
yourself some time by grouping them. When you group two or more objects, they become 
a single object for the purposes of moving and resizing. They also lose their animation, if 
any was applied to them. You can always ungroup them later if you need to work with the 
objects separately. Dissimilar objects can be grouped, so, for example, you could group a 
photo, a drawn shape, and a text box into a single unit. 
You can’t group placeholders with other objects.
To group two or more objects together, follow these steps:
 
1. Select all of the objects that you want to group.
 
2. Click Format ➪ Arrange ➪ Group Objects ➪ Group. (Alternatively, you can press 
Ctrl+G.) The objects now form a group.
To ungroup a collection of objects, select the object group, open the Group drop-down menu 
again, and choose Ungroup, or press Ctrl+Shift+G. After ungrouping them, you can make 
changes to the objects separately. Then, if you want to regroup the same objects again, 
open the Group drop-down menu and choose Regroup.

281
Chapter 9: Drawing and Formatting Objects
9
You can make some changes to objects even when they are part of a group, so it is not as necessary to ungroup 
before editing or formatting an object. Try editing it fi rst as part of the group, and if that doesn’t work, resort to 
ungrouping.
If you are moving a group, make sure you have selected the whole group and not an object within it. If a single object 
is selected in the group, it will move individually when you drag it.
Merging Shapes
One of the most welcome new features in PowerPoint 2013 (and in all of Microsoft Ofﬁ ce 
2013, for that matter) is the ability to combine multiple drawn lines and shapes into more 
complex shapes. This feature makes the drawing tools in Ofﬁ ce applications much more 
useful and ﬂ exible. 
To apply one of the merge operations, select two or more shapes in a stack (that is, where 
they overlap one another at least partially). Then click Drawing Tools Format ➪ Insert 
Shapes ➪ Merge Shapes and then one of the merge operations. There are ﬁ ve basic merge 
operations you can perform, and each of them creates a new shape out of these two pieces 
in a different way.
Suppose, for example, you have two shapes, as shown in Figure 9.23: a blue oval and a yel-
low triangle on top of it. Table 9.1 summarizes the operations and compares the results.

Applying Shape or Picture Styles
Both the Drawing Tools Format tab and the Picture Tools Format tab (shown in Figures 
9.12 and 9.13 respectively) have a style group from which you can apply preset formatting. 
For drawn objects and charts, it is called Shape Styles; for photos and clip art, it is called 
Picture Styles.
Using Shape Styles
Shape Styles are formatting presets that you can apply to drawn shapes, text boxes, and 
charts. Shape Styles make it easy to apply common border and ﬁ ll combinations that use 
colors from the current theme. A Shape Style is a combination of three things: 
 
■Shape Fill. The color and style of the inside.
 
■Shape Outline. The color and style of the outer border.
 
■Shape Effects. Special effects that are applied to the object, such as shadows, 
reﬂ ection, or beveled edges.
Each of these can be separately applied, as you will learn later in this chapter. To apply a 
Shape Style, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the shape or shapes that you want to affect.
 
2. On the Drawing Tools Format tab, open the Shape Styles gallery and click a 
style, as shown in Figure 9.24.
The styles that appear on the gallery menu are built into PowerPoint, and you cannot 
change them. Their colors change according to the color theme that is currently applied to 
the presentation.
The Other Theme Fills option at the bottom of the gallery menu opens an extra palette that contains several light and 
dark background fi lls that match the styles that display when you click Background Styles on the Design tab. See 
Chapter 4 for more about applying background styles. Filling a shape with the same color as the background makes 
it blend in with the background.
Applying Picture Styles
Picture Styles are like Shape Styles, except that they apply to photos, clip art, and media 
clips. A Picture Style applies different formatting than a Shape Style applies because 

284
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
pictures have different needs. For example, a picture does not need a ﬁ ll color because the 
picture is the ﬁ ll. A Picture Style applies these things:  
 
■Picture Shape. The shape of the frame in which the picture is placed.
 
■Picture Border. The color and style of the outside of the picture frame.
 
■Picture Effects. Special effects such as beveled edges and shadows.
FIGURE 9.24
Apply a Shape Style as a shortcut to formatting a drawn object or a chart element.
To apply a Picture Style, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the picture that you want to affect.
 
2. On the Picture Tools Format tab, open the Picture Styles gallery (Figure 9.25) 
and click a style. 
The styles that appear on the gallery menu are built into PowerPoint, and you cannot 
change them.

285
Chapter 9: Drawing and Formatting Objects
9
FIGURE 9.25
Apply a Picture Style to quickly format an imported graphic such as a photo.
The formatting that you apply through Picture Styles is not dependent on the color theme, but some of the border 
formatting is partially dependent on the background that you have chosen. For the Picture Styles that include a bor-
der, the border color is either black or white, and it changes depending on whether you are using a light or dark back-
ground. (You can choose a background from the Background Styles button on the Design tab.) If you want a different 
color border than the Picture Style provides, you can modify the border color after applying the style.
Understanding Color Selection
To apply a custom border or ﬁ ll color to an object, you must know something about how 
PowerPoint uses and applies colors. Although this is covered in Chapter 4, here is a quick 
review.
PowerPoint uses a set of color placeholders for the bulk of its color formatting. Because 
each item’s color is deﬁ ned by a placeholder, and not as a ﬁ xed color, you can easily change 
the colors by switching to a different color theme. For example, if you decide that you 
want all of the slide titles to be blue rather than green, you can make the change once and 
PowerPoint applies it to all of the slides automatically.

286
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
A set of colors that is assigned to the preset positions is a color theme. You can apply both 
border (outline) and ﬁ ll colors using color pickers. A color picker is a menu that shows the 
colors from the currently chosen color theme, along with tints (light versions) and shades 
(dark versions) of each of the theme colors. To stick with theme colors, which I recommend 
in most cases, choose one of the theme colors or one of its tints or shades (Figure 9.26). 
FIGURE 9.26
A color picker offers the current color theme’s colors and also some standard (fi xed) colors.
You also have the following options:
 
■To use a color that has already been used in this presentation, choose it from the 
Recent Colors section. In Figure 9.26 there is one color in that section. 
 
■If you need a color that does not change when you switch color themes, you can 
instead click one of the swatches in the Standard Colors section on the color picker.
 
■If you need a color that is not represented in the Standard Colors section, you can 
choose More Colors. (The command name varies, depending on what you are col-
oring; in Figure 9.26, it is More Fill Colors.) This opens the Colors dialog box. The 
Standard tab in the Colors dialog box contains swatches for many common colors. 
Most people can ﬁ nd the color that they want on the Standard tab. Click the color 
that you want and click OK.
If you need a color that does not appear in the swatches, you may need to use the Custom 
tab, shown in Figure 9.27. There are a number of things you can do on this tab:
 
■You can enter the precise numbers for a color; for example, you can match the exact 
color for a company logo. 

287
Chapter 9: Drawing and Formatting Objects
9
FIGURE 9.27
Use the Custom tab of the Colors dialog box to precisely defi ne a color that you want to use.
 
■You can deﬁ ne colors numerically using either the HSL (hue, saturation, and lumi-
nosity) or RGB (red, green, blue) color models. Choose the color model that you want 
from the Color Model drop-down list.
 
■If you are using the HSL model, you can type the numbers into the Hue, Sat, and 
Lum ﬁ elds on the Custom tab. The hue is the tint (that is, green versus blue versus 
red). A low number is a color at the red end of the spectrum, while a high number is 
a color at the violet end. Saturation refers to the vividness of the color, and lumi-
nosity is the lightness or darkness. A high luminosity mixes the color with white, 
while a low luminosity mixes the color with black.
 
■An alternative way to deﬁ ne colors is by specifying numbers for red, green, and 
blue. Using this measurement, 0, 0, 0 is pure black and 255, 255, 255 is pure white. 
All other colors are some combination of the three colors. For example, pure blue 
is 0, 0, 255. A very pale blue would be 200, 200, 255. You can play around with the 
numbers in the ﬁ elds on the Custom tab. The new color appears in the New area 
near the bottom of the dialog box. Click OK to accept your choice.
You can create an interesting see-through effect with a color by using the transparency slider. When this slider is 
used for a color, it creates an effect like a watercolor paint wash over an item so that whatever is beneath it can par-
tially show through. For photos, you can get a similar tint effect for the whole picture using the Color drop-down list 
on the Picture Tools Format tab.

288
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Applying an Object Border
A border (outline) around an object can draw attention to it as well as separate it from sur-
rounding items.
When describing the buttons that create borders around an object, PowerPoint uses incon-
sistent terminology between the two versions of the Format tab. For drawn objects, the 
button that applies borders is called the Shape Outline button; for pictures it is called the 
Picture Border button. Both buttons open essentially the same menu — a standard color 
picker like the one shown in Figure 9.26. 
The only difference between the Picture Border and the Shape Outline color pickers is that the latter has an Arrows 
command. This command is available only when the selected object is a line (not a closed shape); it applies arrow-
heads to one or both ends of the line.
Border Attributes
A border has three basic attributes: its color, its width (thickness), and its dash style (solid, 
dashed, dotted, etc.). You can set each of these basic attributes using the color picker, 
which contains ﬂ y-out menus at the bottom for weight and dashes. Each ﬂ y-out menu has 
presets that you can select.
To control the more advanced attributes of the line, or to make a selection other than a 
preset, choose More Lines from one of the ﬂ y-out submenus. This opens the Format Shape 
task pane with Line controls expanded, as shown in Figure 9.28.
You can also right-click and choose Format Picture to apply borders from the Format Picture dialog box.
In the Line controls of the Format Shape task pane, you can set the following: 
 
■Width. The thickness of the line in points.
 
■Compound Type. The number of parallel lines the overall line comprises and their 
relative thicknesses.
 
■Dash Type. The style of line (solid, dashed, dotted).
 
■Cap Type. The style for the ends of the line (applicable to lines only).
 
■Join Type. The style for the corners of the shape.
 
■Arrow settings. The types and sizes of the arrow heads (applicable to lines only).

Use the Format Shape task pane to fi ne-tune the border (line) style.
For a gradient line, click Gradient Line in the Format Shape task pane. From there, you can choose a preset gradient 
or defi ne your own. For more information about gradients, see the section “Gradient Fills” later in this chapter.
Creating a Semitransparent Border
By default, a line is not transparent at all. To specify a level of transparency for it, you can 
drag the Transparency slider to the right, or enter a transparency percentage in the text 
box provided, in the Format Shape task pane (Figure 9.28).
Some of the picture or shape effects also affect the border of the object. These are covered later in this chapter, in 
the section “Applying Object Effects.”

Applying an Object Fill
An object can have no ﬁ ll (that is, it can be transparent), or it can be ﬁ lled with a solid 
color, a gradient, a texture, a pattern, or a picture. Fills mostly apply to objects that you 
draw yourself, such as shapes, charts, and SmartArt. Although Fill commands are available 
for imported art such as pictures and clip art, these commands are not commonly applied 
to them. Because a picture takes up the entire frame that it is in, any ﬁ ll that you might 
apply would not be visible anyway (unless the picture has a transparent color set for it). 
With clip art, you might occasionally want to apply a ﬁ ll because most clip art has a trans-
parent background. By applying a ﬁ ll to it, you make the clip art’s background visible so 
that it appears to be in a rectangular box rather than ﬂ oating on the background.
 
 PowerPoint 2013 contains some interesting features for working with pictures, including one that helps 
you remove the background from a photo. See Chapter 11, “Working with Clip Art and Photos,” for 
details. 
Solid Fills
To apply a solid ﬁ ll for a shape, or other type of object that uses the Drawing Tools Format 
tab, you can choose a ﬁ ll type from the color picker that you access through the Shape Fill 
button. See Figure 9.29. 
FIGURE 9.29
Use the Shape Fill button’s palette to choose a solid color.
To apply a solid ﬁ ll for an object that uses the Picture Tools Format tab, you must open the 
Format Picture task pane, and then click Fill. Follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the object and choose Format Picture. The Format Picture task pane 
opens.

291

2. Click the Fill & Line icon, and then click Fill to expand the fill options. 
 
3. Click Solid Fill.
 
4. Click the Color button in the task pane to open a color picker.
 
5. Select the desired color. See Figure 9.30.
 
See the section “Understanding Color Selection” earlier in this chapter for more on selecting color.
FIGURE 9.30

6. (Optional) Drag the Transparency slider to set transparency.
 
7. Click Close.
Copying a Fill Color with the Eyedropper Tool
Matching exact colors can be tricky, especially when you don’t know the numeric value of a 
color you are trying to duplicate. A new feature in PowerPoint 2013 is the Eyedropper tool. 
You can pick up a color from any object in your presentation and use that as a ﬁ ll color for 

292
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
other objects. So, for example, you could pick up the exact shade of green in the leaves on 
a tree in a photo you have and use it as the text color for an adjacent note or as the border 
around the photo.
To copy a color, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the object, choose the attribute you want to format (for example, Picture 
Border, Shape Fill, or Shape Outline), and open the color picker.
 
2. Click the Eyedropper command. The mouse pointer turns into an eyedropper 
graphic, and a square appears above the pointer. Wherever you hover the eyedrop-
per, the square magniﬁ es the color of that spot. See Figure 9.31.
FIGURE 9.31
Pick up a color with the Eyedropper tool.

the pixel so you
can see its color.
Eyedropper
hovers over a
pixel in the image.
 
3. When the square shows the desired color, click to accept it. The item you are 
coloring receives the chosen color.
After you pick up a color with the Eyedropper tool, you can easily reapply that same color 
in the same presentation by choosing it from the Recent Colors section of any color picker.
Gradient Fills
Whenever one color turns gradually into another color, the transition is called a gradient. 
For example, when you watch a sunset, you can see how the red of the sun slowly fades 
into the blue-black of the evening sky, and the sky’s color is a gradient. In graphic design, 

293
Chapter 9: Drawing and Formatting Objects

gradients are often used on large shapes, on logos, and on backgrounds to add more inter-
est than a single ﬂ at color can provide.
PowerPoint 2013 has powerful gradient capabilities. For example, you can create gradients 
that consist of many different colors, and you can specify the spot at which one color 
shifts to another.
Applying a One-Color Gradient Preset
For drawn shapes (and other objects that use the Drawing Tools Format tab), you can use 
the Shape Fill button to access preset gradients that blend one color with either black or 
white. These presets apply only to drawn objects, not to picture objects. Follow these steps 
to apply a one-color preset:
 
1. Apply a solid color fill to the object; use the color that you want to combine 
with black or white.
 
2. Select the object and display the Drawing Tools Format tab.
 
3. Open the Shape Fill drop-down menu, point to Gradient, and click the desired 
gradient style, as shown in Figure 9.32.
FIGURE 9.32
Apply a preset gradient from the Gradient submenu for a shape.

294
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Applying a Custom Gradient
For more gradient options, use the Format Shape (or Format Picture) task pane. This 
method works for most types of objects, generally speaking, but not all pictures can take a 
gradient. (A .wmf ﬁ le with a transparent background can, for example.)  
When setting up a custom gradient, you deﬁ ne stops. A stop is a position along the gradi-
ent that speciﬁ es a certain color. Each stop has three properties: color, stop position, and 
transparency. A gradient typically has as many stops as it has colors; however, you can 
use the same color for multiple stops. For a default, evenly spaced gradient, the stops are 
spaced out evenly, measured in percentages. For example, if you deﬁ ned three stops, they 
would be set at 0 percent, 50 percent, and 100 percent. You can also achieve different 
effects by spacing out the stops differently. Figure 9.33 shows some examples of various 
numbers and positions of stops.
FIGURE 9.33

295
Chapter 9: Drawing and Formatting Objects

FIGURE 9.34
You can defi ne gradient stops and settings in the Format Shape (or Format Picture) 
task pane.
You can set gradients to the following types:
 
■Linear. A linear gradient, like the ones in Figure 9.33, travels from one point to 
another. You can set it to travel horizontally — as shown in Figure 9.33 — verti-
cally, or diagonally, or you can set a speciﬁ c angle.
 
■Radial. A radial gradient radiates out from a point. You can set it to radiate from 
the center of the object or from any of its corners.
 
■Rectangular. This gradient is similar to Radial except that it radiates as a rectangle 
rather than as a curve.
 
■Path. This gradient follows the shape of the object. Try applying it to a starburst, 
for example; the color radiates out from the center of the star.

296
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
You can also deﬁ ne your own colors and stops for a gradient, or you can start with one of 
the Preset Colors settings. These are different from the single-color presets in the Drawing 
Tools Format tab because they are color combinations with predeﬁ ned stops. You can also 
start with one of these sets of combinations as a shortcut.
The Gradient Stops slider contains one or more markers, which you can drag to change its 
position. To add another stop, click the Add Gradient Stop button; to remove a stop, select 
it and click the Remove Gradient Stop button.
The Transparency setting adjusts the amount of transparency that is associated with a 
speciﬁ ed stop position in the gradient. You can use this setting to make certain areas of an 
object more transparent than others. For example, you could deﬁ ne the same color for all of 
the gradient stops but set different levels of transparency for each stop to make an object 
seem like it is fading away.
The Rotate with Shape option determines if the gradient rotates when you rotate a shape.
To create a custom gradient, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the object to be filled and choose Format Shape or Format Picture, 
depending on the object type. The Format Shape or Format Picture task pane 
opens.
 
2. Click the Fill & Line icon, and then expand the Fill section if it is not already 
expanded.
 
3. Click Gradient Fill. Controls for creating a custom gradient appear (Figure 9.34).
 
4. (Optional) Select a preset from the Preset Gradients drop-down list. If you 
select a preset, PowerPoint predeﬁ nes two or more stops for you in the Gradient 
Stops section.
 
5. Open the Type drop-down list and select the type of gradient you want: Linear, 
Radial, Rectangular, or Path.
 
6. If you chose Linear, Radial, or Rectangular, open the Direction drop-down list 
and choose a direction swatch. If you chose Linear, change the incremental value 
in the Angle text box as needed to adjust the angle.
 
7. Mark or clear the Rotate with Shape check box.
 
8. On the Gradient Stops slider, select the first marker. (You can do them in any 
order; I usually start with the leftmost one and work to the right.)
 
9. Do the following to modify the stop: 
 
a. Open the Color palette and select the color for that position.
 
b. (Optional) Use the increment buttons to adjust the Position value, or drag the 
marker to a different position on the slider.
 
c. (Optional) Use the increment buttons to adjust the Transparency setting, or 
drag its slider. Zero percent is no transparency, while 100 percent is complete 
transparency.

297
Chapter 9: Drawing and Formatting Objects

d. (Optional) Use the increment buttons to adjust the Brightness setting, or drag 
its slider.
 
10. Select the next stop on the Gradient Stops slider bar, and repeat step 9.
 
11. (Optional) Add or remove stops: 
 
■If you need to create more stops, click the Add Gradient Stop button and then 
repeat step 8 for each new stop. 
 
■If you need to delete a stop, select it and then click the Remove Gradient Stop 
button.
 
12. Close the task pane.
Texture and Picture Fills
A texture ﬁ ll is actually a picture ﬁ ll, but it is a special type of picture that, when tiled, 
looks like a surface texture such as wood, marble, or cloth. To apply a texture ﬁ ll, select 
the object and then click Drawing Tools Format ➪ Shape Styles ➪ Shape Fill ➪ Texture and 
choose one of the textures on the gallery that appears. See Figure 9.35.
If you are ﬁ lling an object that doesn’t have a Shape Fill button on the Drawing Tools 
Format tab, such as a piece of clip art, you can use the task pane instead. Follow these 
steps:
 
1. Right-click the object and choose Format Picture  (or Format Shape, depending 
on the object type). The task pane opens.
 
2. Click the Fill & Line icon, and expand the Fill section if it is not already 
expanded.
 
3. Click the Picture or Texture Fill option button.
 
4. Click the Texture button and select a texture. The textures are the same ones 
shown in Figure 9.35.
 
5. Close the task pane.
You can use your own pictures as textures. To do so, use the procedure for picture fi lls, and make sure you select the 
Tile Picture as Texture check box in the task pane. (This check box does not appear unless you have already applied a 
picture fi ll.)
You can also use a picture as an object ﬁ ll. You can specify a picture from a ﬁ le stored on 
your hard disk, from the contents of the Clipboard, or from artwork available online (such 
as clip art from Microsoft). Picture ﬁ lls were discussed brieﬂ y at the end of Chapter 8 as 
they pertain to table cells, but you can ﬁ ll almost any object with a picture, not just a text 
box or table cell.

298
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
You can fi ll a clip-art image that has a transparent background with another picture, creating a picture-on-picture 
effect.
FIGURE 9.35
Select one of the preset textures from the Texture gallery.
In the Format Shape or Format Picture task pane, when you select the Picture or Texture ﬁ ll 
option, three buttons appear: 
 
■File. Click this button to open an Insert Picture dialog box, and then select the 
picture that you want to use.
 
■Clipboard. Click this button to insert the contents of the Clipboard as the graphic 
to use. This technique works only with the last item that you placed on the 
Clipboard, not the full 24-item Ofﬁ ce Clipboard.
 
■Online. Click this button to open an Insert Pictures dialog box. In the Ofﬁ ce.com 
Clip Art box, type a keyword to search for a clip-art image, and then select and 
insert the clip art. Or, use the Bing Image Search box to search for a photo to use, 
or browse ﬁ les from your own SkyDrive.

299
Chapter 9: Drawing and Formatting Objects
9
After you select the picture that you want to use, you can set any of the following options 
to control how it appears:
 
■Tile Picture as Texture. When you enable this option, the picture appears at its 
actual size as a background ﬁ ll for the object. If the picture is smaller than the 
object that it is ﬁ lling, then it tiles like a texture (where multiple copies are used). 
If the picture is larger than the object that it is ﬁ lling, then a truncated copy 
appears.
 
■Offset and Scale options. These options control how the picture ﬁ ll adjusts within 
the object. An offset moves it in the speciﬁ ed direction, and a scale value adjusts 
the size. See Figure 9.36.
FIGURE 9.36
Adjust tiling options.

300
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Offsets are especially useful if you are using the Tile Picture as Texture option with a large picture; you can use off-
sets to position the desired part of the picture in the viewable area.
 
■Transparency. Drag the slider or enter a percentage if you want the picture ﬁ ll to 
be semitransparent; this works just the same as with colors and gradients.
 
■Rotate with shape. Select or deselect this option to indicate whether the picture 
should rotate when the object is rotated. This is just the same as with gradients.
Background Fills
You can also apply the background as a ﬁ ll for shapes and drawn objects. This is somewhat 
like setting the background ﬁ ll to No Fill so that the background shows through, except 
that it hides any objects that are between the affected object and the background. In the 
example in Figure 9.37, the oval has the background as its ﬁ ll, and it is sitting on top of a 
text box. This is better than ﬁ lling the oval with the same pattern, gradient, or texture as 
the background because no matter where you move it on the slide, its background will con-
tinue to “match” with the slide’s background. To apply a background ﬁ ll, choose the Slide 
background ﬁ ll option from the Fill settings in the Format Shape or Format Picture task 
pane. 
FIGURE 9.37
A background fi ll allows the background to show through but hides any intervening objects.

301
Chapter 9: Drawing and Formatting Objects

Applying Object Effects
Object effects are special transformations such as reﬂ ections, glows, and bevels. You can 
apply object effects from the Shape Effects or Picture Effects button on the Format tab, 
depending on the object type. The available effects are nearly identical for all types of 
objects, except for the different names of the buttons from which you select them. The fol-
lowing sections explain each effect.
Preset
Presets (in the context of object effects) are 3-D effects. They include combinations of gra-
dient ﬁ lls and edge formatting (such as bevels) that make an object appear to have some 
depth. You can start with one of these presets as a shortcut to a more complex effect, or 
you can just use them as they are. Figure 9.38 shows some of the presets applied to a circle.
FIGURE 9.38
You can use presets to apply 3-D object effects.
Shadow
You can create outer, inner, or perspective shadows, as shown in Figure 9.39. At ﬁ rst 
glance, an inner shadow might look the same as an outer one, but if you increase an inner 
shadow’s size, you will notice that the increased size of the shadow decreases the size of 
the object — that is, the shadow cuts into the object rather than appearing behind it as a 
separate element.
From the drop-down menu of the Shape Effects or Picture Effects button, select Shadow and 
then click one of the shadow presets, or click More Shadows to open Shadow controls in the 
task pane, shown in Figure 9.40. To ﬁ ne-tune a shadow, you can start with one of the pre-
sets from the Presets drop-down menu, customize it by choosing a color, and then drag the 
sliders for each of the shadow attributes: Transparency, Size, Blur, Angle, and Distance.

302
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 9.39
Outer (left), inner (center), and perspective (right) shadows.
FIGURE 9.40
If none of the presets meets your needs, you can customize a shadow using the Format 
Picture or Format Shape task pane.
The shadow applies to either the object or its frame, depending on the object type and 
whether or not it has a transparent background. The following conditions create different 
results:
 
■Text and drawn shapes. A shadow applied to text, or to a drawn object, clings 
directly to the object regardless of the background ﬁ ll.

303
Chapter 9: Drawing and Formatting Objects
9
If text is typed in a shape, the shadow applies only to the shape. If you want text typed in a shape to have a shadow, 
you must use Text Effects in the WordArt Styles options. 
If a shape containing text has no fi ll, the shadow you apply to the shape will apply to the text too. This can cause 
problems when animating, though; the shadow won’t animate with the text. Therefore, it is not recommended to add 
a shape shadow to such a shape if you plan on assigning an animation event to it.
 
■Inserted pictures (such as scanned photos). The shadow applies to the rectan-
gular frame around the picture; if the picture is inserted in a shape, the shadow 
applies to the shape.
 
■Clip art, text boxes, and charts. If the background is set to No Fill, the shadow 
applies to the object inside the frame; if you have an applied ﬁ ll, the shadow 
applies to the frame.
If you change the shadow color, you should generally use a color that is darker than the object. Lighter-colored shad-
ows do not look realistic. However, for black text, you should use a gray shadow.
Refl ection
Reflection creates a mirror image of the object, below the original. A reﬂ ection is 
affected by two factors: the amount of reﬂ ection — partial or full — and the offset, 
or distance between it and the original. The presets on the Shape Effects (or Picture 
Effects) ➪ Reﬂ ection submenu use various combinations of these two factors.
You can also customize the reﬂ ection by choosing Reﬂ ection Options, or by displaying the 
Reﬂ ection tab in the Format Shape or Format Picture task pane, as shown in Figure 9.41. 
Choose a preset to start with, and then drag the sliders to adjust it as needed. The factors 
you can change are Transparency, Size, Blur, and Distance.
Glow and Soft Edges
Glow creates a colored “halo” around the object. You can choose the color either from the 
theme colors or from a ﬁ xed color that you specify. To select a different color, choose More 
Glow Colors and then choose a color from the Colors dialog box. Choose Glow Options to 
open the Format Shape (or Format Picture) task pane, where you can adjust Color, Size, and 
Transparency for the effect.

304
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Soft Edges is similar to the Glow effect. Whereas Glow creates a fuzzy halo around the out-
side of an object, Soft Edges uses the same color as the object to create a fuzzy effect by 
cutting into the edges of the object. The difference between these two effects is similar to 
the difference between an outer and an inner shadow. A shape can have either or both.
FIGURE 9.41
Customize a refl ection effect on the Refl ection tab of the Format Shape (or Format Picture) 
task pane.
Bevels
A bevel is an effect that you apply to the edge of an object to make it look raised, sunken, 
or textured. You can apply beveling to ﬂ at shapes and other objects to give them a thick, 
three-dimensional appearance, or you can combine them with a real 3-D rotation effect, as 
described in the following section. Figure 9.42 shows some examples of bevels that you can 
create using presets. You can access these presets through the Bevel submenu in either the 
Shape Effects or Picture Effects drop-down menu.

305
Chapter 9: Drawing and Formatting Objects
9
FIGURE 9.42
Beveled edges give a shape a three-dimensional appearance without tilting or rotating 
the object.
For more beveling choices, click 3-D Options at the bottom of the Bevel submenu. This 
opens the Format Shape (or Format Picture) task pane with the 3-D Format controls dis-
played, as shown in Figure 9.43. You can also access this task pane by right-clicking the 
object and choosing Format Shape (or Format Picture).
The Bottom Bevel setting has no apparent effect unless you apply a 3-D rotation to the 
object because you can’t see the effect at zero rotation. As a result, we will only concern 
ourselves with the width and height settings for a top bevel:
 
■Width. Speciﬁ es how far the effect extends into the object.
 
■Height. Speciﬁ es how dramatic the effect is vertically.
You won’t notice much height difference for a bevel unless you have applied a 3-D rotation 
to the object, but the width setting is immediately apparent for all objects.
3-D Rotation and 3-D Formatting
The 3-D rotation effect makes a two-dimensional object look three-dimensional by applying 
perspective to it. The 3-D rotation effect uses angle measurements for three dimensions: X, 
Y, and Z:
 
■X rotation. Rotation from side to side.
 
■Y rotation. Rotation from top to bottom.
 
■Z rotation. Pivoting around a center point.
X and Y rotation actually change the shape of the object on the slide to simulate perspec-
tive; Z rotation simply spins the object, just as you would with a rotation handle.

306
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 9.43
You can set bevels and other 3-D formatting effects in the 3-D Format section of 
the task pane.
You can combine 3-D rotation with 3-D formatting to create interesting effects, such as 
adding “sides” to a ﬂ at object and coloring these sides in a certain way. For example, you 
could combine these effects to turn a square into a cube. The 3-D formatting effect is for-
matting (colors, lengths, and textures) that affects an object’s 3-D appearance. The 3-D for-
matting effect consists of the following aspects:
 
■Bevel. As discussed in the preceding section, this effect alters the edges of the 
object. You can set top and bottom bevels separately.
 
■Depth. This allows you to specify the size and color of the sides of the object. 
However, the sides are not visible unless the object is three-dimensionally rotated.

307
Chapter 9: Drawing and Formatting Objects
9
 
■Contour. This allows you to specify the color and size of outlines that mark the 
edges of the 3-D effect.
 
■Surface. This allows you to specify the material and lighting that the object should 
simulate. 
Figure 9.44 shows several types of 3-D rotation and formatting. Beveling is also a type of 
3-D formatting, and so some examples of it are included.
FIGURE 9.44

Although you can use 3-D rotation and 3-D formatting together to create the effects shown 
in Figure 9.44, they are actually controlled separately in PowerPoint. Therefore, creating 
these effects is a two-step process.
Applying 3-D Rotation
To apply 3-D rotation, either you can use one of the 3-D Rotation presets or you can enter 
rotation amounts directly into the Format Shape (or Format Picture) task pane. To use a 
preset, click the Shape Effects (or Picture Effects) button on the Format tab, select 3-D 
Rotation, and click a preset. The Oblique presets at the bottom of the menu are the most 
similar to the older 3-D effects from PowerPoint 2003 and earlier.

308
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
If you have not yet added depth to the shape by using its 3-D Format settings, you won’t see any effect from the 
Oblique presets because there are not yet any “sides” to the shape.
To rotate a precise amount, choose 3-D Rotation Options from the bottom of the presets 
menu, or right-click the object and choose Format Shape (or Format Picture) to open the 
Format Shape (or Format Picture) task pane. Then expand the 3-D Rotation settings, as 
shown in Figure 9.45. You can start with one of the presets by selecting it from the Presets 
drop-down menu.
FIGURE 9.45
Set X, Y, and Z rotation for the object in the Format Shape (or Format Picture) task pane.
The other settings for rotation are as follows:
 
■Keep Text Flat. This option prevents any text in the shape from rotating on the 
X- or Y-axis. 
 
■Distance from Ground. This setting adds space between the object and the back-
ground. To see this effect more clearly, rotate the object.
 
■Reset. You can press this button to remove all 3-D settings so that you can start 
fresh.

309
Chapter 9: Drawing and Formatting Objects

Applying 3-D Formatting
You can use 3-D formatting to control the colors and the amount of depth of the surfaces 
and sides of a 3-D rotated object. You control these settings from the 3-D Format section of 
the Format Shape (or Format Picture) task pane, as shown in Figure 9.46:
FIGURE 9.46
Apply formatting to the 3-D effects from the 3-D Format section of the task pane.
 
■Depth. The depth of an object determines the length and color of its sides. In most 
cases, you want to keep the sides set to the default color setting, Match Shape Fill. 
This enables the sides to change colors when the shape changes colors. Although the 
sides are a darker shade of the object’s color in order to create the illusion of depth, 
you can adjust their color through the application of surface material and lighting.
 
■Contour. Contours are similar to outlines, or borders, except that contours go 
around each side of a 3-D object. For example, if you have a square with sides (a 

310
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
cube), the color and size that you set for Contours creates a border around the front 
face as well as around each visible side surface.
 
■Material. The surface material determines how shiny the surface appears and how

opens a palette that displays various materials such as matte, plastic, and metal. 
 
■Lighting. The Lighting button opens a palette that displays various types of light-
ing that you can apply to the object, such as Harsh, Soft, Bright Room, and so on. 
To adjust the direction from which the light hits the object, you can change the 
Angle setting.
Tips for Creating Common 3-D Objects
The 3-D formatting and rotation settings in PowerPoint 2013 are very powerful and can 
seem a little overwhelming at ﬁ rst because of the variety of available options. Take your 
time in exploring them, and I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised at what you can accom-
plish. Here are some things you can try.
To create a perfectly round sphere, which stays round no matter how you rotate it, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Draw an oval.
 
2. Select the oval and use the Size boxes on the Drawing Tools Format tab to set 
its height and width to the same value, thus making it a perfect circle. For this 
experiment, use a whole number such as 1” or 2”.
 
3. Right-click the circle and choose Format Shape.
 
4. In the 3-D Format settings, set the top and bottom bevel, both Height and 
Width, to 36 points for every 1” of diameter. For example, if your circle is 2” in 
diameter, use 72 points for each.
To create a four-sided pyramid, follow these steps:
 
1. Draw a rectangle.
 
2. Select the rectangle and use the Size boxes on the Drawing Tools Format tab to 
set its height and width to the same value, making it a perfect square. For this 
experiment, use 1”.
 
3. Right-click the square and choose Format Shape.
 
4. In the 3-D Format settings, for both the Top and Bottom bevel styles, choose 
Angle (the first preset on the second row).
 
5. Set the bevel settings as follows: 
 
a. Top Width: 36 points for every 1” of the square’s size, plus 1 point. For example, 
for a 1” square, use 37 points; for a 2” square, use 73 points.
 
b. Top Height: 72 points for every 1” of the square’s size.
 
c. Bottom (height and width): 0 points.

6. In the 3-D Rotation tab, rotate the object so that you can see it more clearly: 
 
■X: 30
 
■Y: 300
 
■Z: 325
To create pyramids with different numbers of sides, use shapes other than squares. For example, to create a three-
sided pyramid, start with a triangle. To create a cone, use a circle.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to draw lines and shapes, and how to format almost any 
type of object. You’ll use these skills as you go forward in the rest of the book, learning 
about speciﬁ c types of objects, including SmartArt, clip art, and so on. No matter what 
type of graphic you encounter, you’ll be able to format it using these same techniques.
In the next chapter, you’ll learn how to create and format SmartArt diagrams, which com-
bine the best of a bulleted list with the best of drawn objects to present text data in an 
interesting way.

J
ust as charts and graphs can enliven a boring table of numbers, a SmartArt graphic can enliven 
a conceptual discussion. SmartArt helps the audience understand the interdependencies of 
objects or processes in a visual way, so they don’t have to juggle that information mentally as 
you speak. Some potential uses include organizational charts, hierarchy diagrams, and ﬂ ow charts.
Understanding SmartArt Types and Their Uses
SmartArt is a special class of vector graphic object that combines shapes, lines, and text placehold-
ers. SmartArt is most often used to illustrate relationships between bits of text.
The SmartArt interface is similar regardless of the type of graphic you are creating. You can type 
directly into the placeholders on the SmartArt graphic, or you can display a Text pane to the side 
of the graphic and type into that, much as you would type into an Outline pane, to have text 
appear in a slide’s text placeholder boxes. See Figure 10.1. You can also select some text, right-click 
it, and choose Convert to SmartArt. 
There are eight types of SmartArt graphics in PowerPoint 2013, and each is uniquely suited for a 
certain type of data delivery.

List
A List graphic presents information in a fairly straightforward, text-based way, somewhat 
like a fancy outline. List graphics are useful when information is not in any particular 
order or when the process or progression between items is not important. The list can have 
multiple levels, and you can enclose each level in a shape or not. Figure 10.2 shows an 
example.
Process
A Process graphic is similar to a list, but it has directional arrows or other connectors that 
represent the ﬂ ow of one item to another. This adds an extra aspect of meaning to the 
graphic. For example, in Figure 10.3, the way the boxes are staggered and connected with 
arrows implies that the next step begins before the previous one ends.
Cycle
A Cycle graphic also illustrates a process, but a repeating or recursive one — usually a pro-
cess in which there is no ﬁ xed beginning point or endpoint. You can jump into the cycle 
at any point. In Figure 10.4, for example, the ongoing process of product development and 
improvement is illustrated.

Hierarchy
A Hierarchy chart is an organization chart. It shows structure and relationships between 
people or things in standardized levels. For example, it can show who reports to whom in a 
company’s employment system. It is useful when describing how the organization functions 
and who is responsible for what. In Figure 10.5, for example, three organization levels are 
represented, with lines of reporting drawn between each level. Hierarchy graphics can also 
run horizontally, for use in tournament rosters.
FIGURE 10.5
A Hierarchy graphic, also called an organization chart, explains the structure of 
an organization.
Should you include your company’s organization chart in your presentation? That’s a question that depends on your 
main message. If your speech is about the organization, you should. If not, show the organization structure only if it 
serves a purpose to advance your speech. Many presenters have found that an organization chart makes an excellent 
backup slide. You can prepare it and have it ready in case a question arises about the organization. Another useful 
strategy is to include a printed organization chart as part of the handouts you distribute to the audience, without 
including the slide in your main presentation.
Relationship
Relationship graphics graphically illustrate how parts relate to a whole. One common type 
of Relationship graphic is a Venn diagram, as in Figure 10.6, showing how categories of peo-
ple or things overlap. Relationship graphics can also break things into categories or show 
how parts contribute to a whole, as with a pie chart.

317
Chapter 10: Creating SmartArt Graphics
10
FIGURE 10.6
A Relationship graphic shows how parts relate to a whole.
Matrix
A Matrix also shows the relationship of parts to a whole, but it does so with the parts in 
orderly looking quadrants. You can use Matrix graphics when you do not need to show any 
particular relationship between items but you want to make it clear that they make up a 
single unit. See Figure 10.7.
FIGURE 10.7
A Matrix graphic uses a grid to represent the contributions of parts to a whole.
Pyramid
A Pyramid graphic is just what the name sounds like — it’s a striated triangle with text 
at various levels, representing not only the relationship between the items but also that 
the items at the smaller part of the triangle are less numerous or more important. For 
example, the graphic in Figure 10.8 shows that there are many more workers than there are 
executives.

318
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 10.8
A Pyramid graphic represents the progression between less and more of something.
In Pyramid graphics and some other cases, labels do not confi ne themselves to within the associated shape. If 
this is a problem, you might be able to make the labels fi t with a combination of line breaks (Shift+Enter) and font 
changes.
Picture
The Picture category is a collection of SmartArt graphic types from the other categories 
that include picture placeholders in them. You’ll ﬁ nd List, Process, and other types of 
graphics here; the Picture category simply summarizes them.
The Offi ce.com category shows additional SmartArt layouts that are available online from Offi ce.com. If you are con-
nected to the Internet, you can access these additional layouts for more choices.
Inserting a SmartArt Graphic
All SmartArt graphics start out the same way — you insert them on the slide as you can 
any other slide object. That means you can either use a SmartArt placeholder on a slide lay-
out or insert the SmartArt graphic manually.
To use a placeholder, start with a slide that contains a layout with a SmartArt placeholder 
in it, or change the current slide’s layout to one that does. Then click the Insert a SmartArt 
Graphic icon in the placeholder, as shown in Figure 10.9. To insert from scratch, click the 
SmartArt button on the Insert tab.
Another way to start a new SmartArt graphic is to select some text and then right-click the 
selection and choose Convert to SmartArt.
Any way you start it, the Choose a SmartArt Graphic dialog box opens (Figure 10.10). Select 
one of the SmartArt categories, click the desired SmartArt object, and click OK, and the 
graphic appears. From there it’s just a matter of customizing.

FIGURE 10.10
Select the graphic type you want to insert.
Some graphics appear in more than one category. To browse all of the categories at once, select the All category. You 
can access additional graphics by choosing the Offi ce.com category.
When you select a graphic, SmartArt Tools tabs become available (Design and Format). You 
will learn what each of the buttons on them does as this chapter progresses. The buttons 
change depending on the type of graphic.
Editing SmartArt Text
All SmartArt has text placeholders, which are basically text boxes. You simply click in one 
of them and type. Then use the normal text-formatting controls (Font, Font Size, Bold, 
Italic, and so on) on the Home tab to change the appearance of the text, or use the WordArt 
Styles group on the Format tab to apply WordArt formatting.

320
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
You can also display a Text pane, as shown in Figure 10.1, and type or edit the graphic’s 
text there. The Text pane serves the same purpose for a graphic that the Outline pane in 
Outline view serves for the slide as a whole.
The text in the Outline pane is not always in the order you would expect it to be for the graphic because it forces text 
to appear in linear form from a graphic that is not necessarily linear. It does not matter how the text appears in the 
Text pane because only you see that. What matters is how it looks in the actual graphic.
Here are some tips for working with SmartArt text:
 
■To leave a text box empty, just don’t type anything in it. The [Text] placeholders do 
not show up in a printout or in Slide Show view.
 
■To promote a line of text, press Shift+Tab; to demote it, press Tab in the Text pane.
 
■Text wraps automatically, but you can press Shift+Enter to insert a line break if 
necessary.
 
■In most cases, the text size shrinks to ﬁ t the graphic in which it is located. There 
are some exceptions to that, though; for example, at the top of a pyramid, the text 
can overﬂ ow the tip of the pyramid.
 
■All of the text is the same size, so if you enter a really long string of text in one 
box, the text size in all of the related boxes shrinks too. You can manually format 
parts of the SmartArt graphic to change this behavior, as you will learn later in the 
chapter.
 
■If you resize the SmartArt graphic, its text resizes automatically.
Modifying SmartArt Structure
The structure of the SmartArt graphic includes how many boxes it has and where they are 
placed. Even though the graphic types are all very different, the way you add, remove, and 
reposition shapes in them is surprisingly similar across all types.
When you add a shape, you add both a graphical element (a circle, a bar, or other) and an associated text place-
holder. The same applies to deletion; removing a shape also removes its associated text placeholder from the 
SmartArt graphic.

321
Chapter 10: Creating SmartArt Graphics

Inserting and Deleting Shapes
To insert a shape in a SmartArt graphic, follow these steps:
 
1. Click a shape that is adjacent to where you want the new shape to appear.
 
2. Click SmartArt Tools Design ➪ Create Graphic ➪ Add Shape.
You can click the top part of the Add Shape button to add a shape of the same level and 
type as the selected one, or you can click the bottom part of the button to open a menu 
from which you can choose other variants. The choices on the menu depend on the graphic 
type and the type of shape selected. For example, in Figure 10.11, you can insert a shape 
into a SmartArt graphic either before or after the current one (same outline level), or you 
can insert a shape that is subordinate (below) or superior to (above) the current one.
FIGURE 10.11
Add a shape to the SmartArt graphic.
To delete a shape, click it to select it in the SmartArt graphic, and then press the Delete 
key on the keyboard. You might need to delete subordinate shapes before you can delete 
the main shape.
Not all SmartArt graphic types can accept different numbers of shapes. For example, the four-square matrix graphic 
is fi xed at four squares. 
Adding Bullets
In addition to adding shapes to the SmartArt graphic, you can add bullets — that is, subor-
dinate text to a shape. To do so, click the Add Bullet button. Bullets appear indented under 
the shape’s text in the Text pane, as shown in Figure 10.12.

322
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 10.12
Create subordinate bullet points under a shape.
Promoting and Demoting Text
The difference between a shape and a bullet is primarily a matter of promotion and demo-
tion in the Text pane’s outline. The Text pane works just as the regular Outline pane does 
in this regard; you can promote with Shift+Tab or demote with Tab. You can also use the 
Promote and Demote buttons on the SmartArt Tools Design tab.
Changing the Flow Direction
Each SmartArt graphic ﬂ ows in a certain direction. A Cycle graphic ﬂ ows either clockwise 
or counterclockwise. A Pyramid ﬂ ows either up or down. 
If you realize after typing all of the text that you should have made the SmartArt graphic 
ﬂ ow in the other direction, you can change it by clicking the Right to Left button on the 
SmartArt Tools Design tab. It is a toggle; you can switch back and forth freely.
Reordering Shapes
Not only can you reverse the overall ﬂ ow of the SmartArt graphic, you can also move 
around individual shapes. For example, suppose you have a graphic that illustrates ﬁ ve 
steps in a process and you realize that steps 3 and 4 are out of order. You can move one of 
them without having to retype all of the labels.
The easiest way to reorder the shapes is to select one and then click the Reorder Down or 
Reorder Up button on the SmartArt Tools Design tab.

323
Chapter 10: Creating SmartArt Graphics
10
If you have more complex reordering to do, you might prefer to work in the Text pane 
instead, cutting and pasting text like this:
 
1. Display the Text pane if it does not already appear. You can either click the 
arrow button to the left of the graphic or click the Text Pane button on the 
SmartArt Tools Design tab.
 
2. Select some text to be moved in the Text pane.
 
3. Press Ctrl+X to cut it to the Clipboard.
 
4. Click in the Text pane at the beginning of the line above which it should appear.
 
5. Press Ctrl+V to paste.
Repositioning Shapes
You can individually select and drag each shape to reposition it on the SmartArt graphic. 
Any connectors between it and the other shapes are automatically resized and extended as 
needed. For example, in Figure 10.13, notice how the arrows that connect the circles in the 
Cycle graphic have elongated as one of the circles has moved out.
FIGURE 10.13
When you move pieces of a SmartArt graphic, connectors move and stretch as needed.

and position.
Resetting a SmartArt Graphic
After making changes to a SmartArt graphic, you can return it to its default settings with 
the Reset Graphic button on the SmartArt Tools Design tab. This strips off everything, 
including any SmartArt styles and manual positioning, and makes it exactly as it was when 
you inserted it except it keeps the text that you’ve typed.

324
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Changing to a Different SmartArt Layout
The layouts are the graphic types. When you insert a SmartArt graphic you choose a type, 
and you can change that type at any time later.
To change the layout type, use the Layouts gallery on the Design tab, as shown in Figure 
10.14. You can open the gallery and click the desired type, or click More Layouts at the bot-
tom of its menu to redisplay the same dialog box as in Figure 10.10, the Choose a SmartArt 
Graphic dialog box, from which you can choose any layout.
FIGURE 10.14
Switch to a different graphic layout.
Click here to open gallery
to choose layouts.
Modifying a Hierarchy Graphic Structure
Hierarchy graphics (organization charts) show the structure of an organization. They have 
some different controls for changing their structure compared to other graphics, so the fol-
lowing sections look at them separately. 
Inserting and Deleting Shapes
The main difference when inserting an organization chart shape (that is, a box into which 
you will type a name) is that you must specify which existing box the new one is related to 
and how it is related.
For example, suppose you have a supervisor already in the chart and you want to add some 
people to the chart who report to him. You would ﬁ rst select his box on the chart and then 
insert the new shapes with the Add Shape button. For a box of the same level, or of the 
previously inserted level, click the top part of the button; for a subordinate or other rela-
tionship, open the button’s menu. See Figure 10.15. The chart can have only one box at the 
top level, however, just as a company can have only one CEO.
When you insert a new shape in a Hierarchy graphic, four of the options are the same as 
with any other SmartArt graphic, and one is new: Add Shape After and Add Shape Before 
insert shapes of the same level as the selected one, and Add Shape Above and Add Shape 
Below insert a superior and subordinate level respectively. The new option, Add Assistant, 

325
Chapter 10: Creating SmartArt Graphics
10
adds a box that is neither subordinate nor superior but a separate line of reporting, as 
shown in Figure 10.16. 
FIGURE 10.15

should be related.
FIGURE 10.16

326
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
An assistant is a person whose job is to provide support to a certain person or offi ce. An executive secretary is one 
example. In contrast, a subordinate is an employee who may report to a manager but whose job does not consist 
entirely of supporting that manager. Confused? Don’t worry about it. You don’t have to make a distinction in your 
organization chart. Everyone can be a subordinate (except the person at the top of the heap, of course).
To delete a shape, select it and press the Delete key, as with all of the other graphic types.
Changing a Person’s Level in the Organization
As the organization changes, you might need to change your chart to show that people 
report to different supervisors. The easiest way to do that is to move the text in the Text 
pane, the same way as you learned in the section “Reordering Shapes” earlier in this chap-
ter. To promote someone, select their box and press Shift+Tab.
To change who someone reports to, select their box and press Ctrl+X to cut it to the 
Clipboard. Then select the box of the person they now report to, and press Ctrl+V to paste.
Controlling Subordinate Layout Options
When subordinates report to a supervisor, you can list the subordinates beneath that 
supervisor in a variety of ways. In Standard layout, each subordinate appears horizontally 
beneath the supervisor, as shown in Figure 10.17.
FIGURE 10.17
This is the standard layout for a branch of an organization chart.

327
Chapter 10: Creating SmartArt Graphics
10
However, in a large or complex organization chart, the graphic can quickly become too wide 
with the Standard layout. Therefore, there are “hanging” alternatives that make the chart 
more vertically oriented. The alternatives are Both, Left Hanging, and Right Hanging. They 
are just what their names sound like. Figure 10.18 shows examples of Right Hanging. 
FIGURE 10.18
Hanging layouts make the chart more vertically oriented.
The layout is chosen for individual branches of the organization chart, so before selecting 
an alternative layout, you must click on the supervisor box whose subordinates you want to 
change. To change a layout, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the box for the supervisor whose layout you want to change.
 
2. Choose SmartArt Tools Design ➪ Create Graphic ➪ Layouts on the Create 
Graphic section. A menu of layout options appears.
 
3. Choose one of the layouts (Standard, Both, Left Hanging, or Right Hanging).
If the Layouts button’s menu is grayed out, you do not have a box selected in a Hierarchy graphic.

Formatting a SmartArt Graphic 
You can format a SmartArt graphic either automatically or manually. Automatic formatting 
is the default, and many PowerPoint users don’t even realize that manual formatting is a 
possibility. The following sections cover both.
Applying a SmartArt Style
SmartArt Styles are preset formatting specs (border, ﬁ ll, effects, shadows, and so on) that 
you can apply to an entire SmartArt graphic. They make it easy to apply surface texture 
effects that make the shapes look reﬂ ective or appear to have 3-D depth or perspective.
SmartArt Styles do not include color changes. Those are separately controlled with the Change Colors button on the 
SmartArt Tools Design tab.
To apply a SmartArt style, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the SmartArt graphic so that the SmartArt Tools Design tab becomes 
available.
 
2. On the SmartArt Tools Design tab, click one of the SmartArt Styles samples (see 
Figure 10.19), or open the gallery and select from a larger list (see Figure 10.20).
FIGURE 10.19
Select a SmartArt Style.
Click here to open the
gallery to select styles.
Changing SmartArt Colors
After you apply a SmartArt style, as in the preceding section, you might want to change 
the colors used in the graphic.
The easiest way to apply colors is to use the Change Colors button’s menu on the Design tab. 
You can select from a gallery of color schemes. As shown in Figure 10.21, you can choose 
a Colorful scheme (one in which each shape has its own color, or the shapes at each level 
have their own colors), or you can choose a monochrome color scheme based on any of the 
current presentation color theme’s color swatches.

FIGURE 10.21

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Manually Applying Colors and Effects to Individual Shapes
In addition to formatting the entire graphic with a SmartArt Style, you can format indi-
vidual shapes using Shape Styles, just as you did in Chapter 9, “Drawing and Formatting 
Objects,” with drawn objects. Here’s a quick review:
 
1. Select a shape in a SmartArt graphic.
 
2. On the SmartArt Tools Format tab, select a shape style from the Shape Styles 
gallery. 
 
3. (Optional) Fine-tune the style by using the Shape Fill, Shape Outline, and/or 
Shape Effects buttons and their associated menus.
Manually Formatting SmartArt Text
WordArt formatting works the same in a SmartArt graphic as it does everywhere else in 
PowerPoint. Use the WordArt Styles gallery and controls on the SmartArt Tools Format 
tab to apply text formatting to individual shapes, or select the entire graphic to apply the 
changes to all shapes at once. 
Making a Shape Larger or Smaller
In some SmartArt types, it is advantageous to make certain shapes larger or smaller than 
the others. For example, if you want to emphasize a certain step in a process, you can cre-
ate a SmartArt graphic where that step’s shape is larger. Then you can repeat that same 
graphic on a series of slides, but with a different step in the process enlarged on each copy, 
to step through the process. There are several options for this:
 
■You can manually resize a shape by dragging its selection handles, the same as with 
any other object. However, this is imprecise, and can be a problem if you want mul-
tiple shapes to be enlarged because they won’t be consistently so.
 
■You can set a precise size for the entire SmartArt graphic by adjusting the height 
and width measurements in the Size group on the SmartArt Tools Format tab, as 
shown in Figure 10.22. However, if different shapes are already different sizes and 
you want to resize them in proportion, this won’t help.
 
■You can use the Larger or Smaller buttons on the Format tab to bump the sizes of 
one or more shapes up or down slightly with each successive click.
Resizing the Entire SmartArt Graphic Object
When you resize the entire SmartArt object as a whole, everything within its frame 
changes size proportionally. There are several ways to do this:
 
■Drag and drop a corner selection handle on the SmartArt graphic’s outer frame.
 
■Use the Size controls on the SmartArt Tools Format tab to enter a precise height 
and width.
 
■Right-click the outer frame of the SmartArt object and choose Size and Position. 
The Format Shape task pane opens (Figure 10.23). Under the Size heading, enter a 

331

height and width in inches, or scale it by a percentage in the Scale Height and Scale 
Width boxes. Select the Lock Aspect Ratio check box if you want to maintain the 
proportions.

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Editing in 2-D
If you choose one of the 3-D selections from the SmartArt Style gallery, the text might 
become a bit hard to read and edit when you are working with the graphic at a small zoom 
percentage. There are a couple of ways around this:
 
■Right-click a shape and choose Edit Text. The face of the shape appears in 2-D tem-
porarily, making it easier to edit the text.
 
■Click the Edit in 2-D button on the SmartArt Tools Format tab. The entire graphic 
appears in 2-D temporarily.
Even though the face of the shape appears in 2-D, which you think would make it easier to read, in some SmartArt 
types and styles the text might still be fuzzy and hard to read. You might be better off editing it in the Text pane.
Changing the Shapes Used 
Each SmartArt layout has its own defaults that it uses for the shapes, but you can change 
these manually. On the SmartArt Tools Format tab, click Change Shape to open a palette 
of shapes just like the ones you learned to work with in Chapter 9. Then click the desired 
shape to apply to the selected shape. You can also access this from the right-click menu.
Each shape is individually conﬁ gurable. If you simply select the entire graphic, the Change 
Shape button is not available; you must select each shape you want to change. Hold down 
the Shift key as you click on each one to be selected. Figure 10.24 shows a SmartArt 
graphic that uses some different shapes.
FIGURE 10.24

Saving a SmartArt Graphic as a Picture
SmartArt graphics work only within Ofﬁ ce applications, but you can easily export one for 
use in any other application. It is exported as a picture (by default a PNG ﬁ le), which you 
can then import into any application that accepts pictures. To save a SmartArt graphic as a 
picture, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the outer frame of the SmartArt object.
 
2. Right-click the frame and choose Save as Picture. The Save As Picture dialog 
box opens.
 
3. (Optional) Open the Save as Type list and select a different file type if desired.
 
4. Click the Save button to complete the save.
PowerPoint can save pictures in GIF, JPEG, TIFF, PNG, BMP, WMF, and EMF formats. Different formats have different 
qualities and advantages. EMF and WMF can be ungrouped, but not the other formats. EMF does not result in a qual-
ity loss when resized, but most of the others do. JPG doesn’t use a transparent background, but PNG does.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to create SmartArt graphics. You learned how to select 
a SmartArt graphic type, how to rearrange shapes, how to apply formatting, and how to 
export SmartArt as pictures you can use in other programs. You will probably ﬁ nd lots of 
creative uses for SmartArt now that you know it’s available!
In the next chapter, you’ll learn how to incorporate online artwork, both from Microsoft and 
from other sources. This can include clip art from Ofﬁ ce.com, photos from Bing, and more.

hether you’re putting together a slide show to display your vacation photos or adding 
photos of industrial products to a business presentation, PowerPoint has the tools and 
capabilities you need. In this chapter you’ll learn the ins and outs of using clip art and 
photographs in a PowerPoint presentation. You’ll ﬁ nd out how to locate, insert, and modify clip art 
and how to prepare and insert photos. You’ll ﬁ nd out how to compress pictures so they take up less 
disk space and how to export pictures out of PowerPoint so you can save them separately.
Choosing Appropriate Artwork
Before we get started with the “how” of images in PowerPoint, take a moment to think about the 
“why.” Don’t just use any old image! You must never use artwork simply because you can; it must be 
a well-thought-out decision. Here are some tips for using artwork appropriately:
 
■Use for fun. Use cartoonish images only if you speciﬁ cally want to impart a lighthearted, 
fun feel to your presentation.
 
■Use one style. The clip art available from Ofﬁ ce.com includes many styles of drawings, 
ranging from simple black-and-white shapes to very complex, shaded color drawings and 
photographs. Try to stick with one type of image rather than bouncing among several 
drawing styles.

336
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
 
■Use only one piece per slide. Also, do not use artwork on every slide, or it 
becomes overpowering.
 
■Avoid repetition. Don’t repeat the same artwork on more than one slide in the pre-
sentation unless you have a speciﬁ c reason to do so.
 
■Avoid graphics with bad news. If your message is very serious, or you are convey-
ing bad news, don’t use artwork. It looks insensitive in these situations.
 
■Better none than bad. If you can’t ﬁ nd artwork that is exactly right for the slide, 
then don’t use any. It is better to have none than to have an inappropriate image.
 
■Buy appropriate art. If artwork is important, and Ofﬁ ce.com doesn’t have what you 
want, you can buy more. Don’t try to struggle along with the clips and images that 
come with Ofﬁ ce if they aren’t meeting your needs; impressive artwork collections 
are available at reasonable prices at your local computer store as well as online.
Inserting Clip Art
Clip art is pre-drawn art that comes with PowerPoint or that is available from other sources 
(such as through the Internet). There are thousands of images that you can use royalty free 
in your work, without having to draw your own. For example, suppose you are creating a 
presentation about snow skiing equipment. Rather than hiring an artist to draw a picture of 
a skier, you can use one of PowerPoint’s stock drawings of skiers and save yourself a bundle.
Being an owner of a Microsoft Ofﬁ ce product entitles you to the use the huge clip-art col-
lection that Microsoft maintains at Ofﬁ ce.com, and if you are connected to the Internet 
while you are using PowerPoint, PowerPoint can automatically pull clips from that collec-
tion as easily as it can from your own hard drive. 
Earlier versions of PowerPoint included robust search and management capabilities for clip 
art and an application called the Clip Organizer. In contrast, PowerPoint 2013 provides only 
a very basic search box for searching for clip art by keyword at Ofﬁ ce.com. 
You can insert clip art on a slide either with or without a content placeholder. If you use 
a content placeholder, PowerPoint inserts the clip art wherever the placeholder is; if you 
don’t, PowerPoint inserts the clip art at the center of the slide. (You can move it afterward, 
of course.) To insert clip art into a content placeholder, click the Online Pictures icon on 
the placeholder (see Figure 11.1). To insert clip art without a content placeholder, choose 
Insert ➪ Images ➪ Online Pictures. 
FIGURE 11.1
Click the Online Pictures icon in a content placeholder to insert clip art into the placeholder.

Whichever method you use, the Insert Pictures dialog box opens (see Figure 11.2). In it are 
three options:
 
■Office.com Clip Art: You can use the Search box on this line to search Microsoft’s 
clip-art collection by keyword.
 
■Bing Image Search: You can use the Search box on this line to use the Bing search 
engine to look for pictures on the Internet by keyword. These are mostly photo-
graphic images, which you’ll learn more about later in this chapter.
 
■(Your Name) SkyDrive: You can click Browse to browse the content of your own 
SkyDrive and insert pictures from there. (See Appendix B, “Essential SkyDrive 
Skills,” for more information about using your SkyDrive.) 
FIGURE 11.2

Type a keyword into the Search box next to Ofﬁ ce.com Clip Art and then press Enter to per-
form the search. Search results appear in that same dialog box, as shown in Figure 11.3.
Click the image you want to insert (or click multiple images to insert several at once) and 
then click the Insert button. If the Insert button doesn’t appear, make sure an image is 
selected; Insert doesn’t appear until you do that.

Browsing Clips At Offi ce.com
When you search for clip art while connected to the Internet, as you learned to do in the 
preceding section, the Ofﬁ ce.com clip art automatically appears. However, you can also 
visit the Ofﬁ ce.com website to browse the clip art directly. There are some advantages to 
browsing clip art this way. For example, you can narrow down your search to only certain 
media types (such as only line-art illustrations or only photos), and you can ﬁ lter the 
search results by image size. 
To browse the Ofﬁ ce.com clip art on the Web, open a web browser window, navigate to 
http://office.microsoft.com and click the Images link. From there, type a key-
word in the Search All Images box at the top of the page and press Enter to initiate a 
search. See Figure 11.4. This page is constantly changing, so it may look different when 
you visit it.
In the search results window, a bar appears along the left side with ﬁ lters for media types 
and image size. To limit the results to a certain category, click one of these ﬁ lters. For 
example, in Figure 11.5, the list has been ﬁ ltered to show only illustrations.

Chapter 11: Working with Clip Art and Photos

FIGURE 11.4
Visit the Offi ce.com clip art web page for more information and more clip art.
What’s the difference between an illustration and a photo? An illustration is a line art drawing, which some would 
call “true clip art.” It is a drawing, rather than a photo. Clip-art images are vector graphics, which means they are 
created with mathematical formulas that draw each line and fi ll each shape with color. Vector graphics take up less 
disk space than photos, and they look good at any size. In contrast, photos are raster graphics; they are composed of 
a grid of tiny colored dots. See “Understanding Raster Graphics” later in this chapter for more details. 
Another advantage of using the web interface for clip art is that you can copy the clip art 
to your hard disk for later use. 
In the list of clips that the site ﬁ nds, point to a clip that you want. A pop-up for it appears, 
as shown in Figure 11.6.
The fi rst time you attempt to select one of the options from a clip’s pop-up, you may be prompted to download the 
Offi ce.com ActiveX control. You must do so in order to access clip art via the Offi ce.com website. If a User Account 
Control window appears asking if you want the program to make changes to this computer, click Yes. You may need to 
restart your computer and come back to the Offi ce.com web page after the restart.

The following options are available in the pop-up:
 
■View Details. Opens a web page speciﬁ cally for this clip, where you can see infor-

■Copy. Copies the clip to your Windows Clipboard, from which you can paste it into 
PowerPoint or any other application that accepts input from the Clipboard. After 
clicking Copy, switch to PowerPoint or whatever program you like, position the 

341

insertion point or select the placeholder, and press Ctrl+V or choose Home ➪ 
Clipboard ➪ Paste.
 
■Download. Downloads the clip-art image’s ﬁ le to your hard drive so you can use 
it later when you don’t have an Internet connection. An information bar appears 
at the bottom of the browser window asking whether you want to save or open 
the ﬁ le. See Figure 11.7. Click Save, and the ﬁ le is saved to the Downloads folder 
for your user account (C:\Users\username\Downloads). You can then insert 
it in PowerPoint using the procedure outlined in “Inserting Photos” later in this 
chapter. If you instead choose Open, the ﬁ le is opened in Paint (or your default 
editor for the ﬁ le type), where you can modify it if you like before inserting it into 
PowerPoint. However, the next section of this chapter covers modifying clip art 
from within PowerPoint, so you may want to investigate that method instead if you 
want to make some changes to the clip.
FIGURE 11.7
Respond to the information bar message by choosing to open or save the fi le.
Modifying Clip Art
Most of the modiﬁ cations that you will learn about later in this chapter apply to both pho-
tographs and clip art. For example, you can increase or decrease brightness and contrast, 
apply color washes, crop, rotate, and so on. However, there are also some special modiﬁ ca-
tions that apply only to clip art and other vector images. They are covered in the following 
sections.
Recoloring a Clip
One of the top complaints about clip art is that the colors are wrong. For example, you 
may have the perfect drawing, but its colors clash with your presentation design. You can 
recolor individual parts of a clip by changing it to a Microsoft drawing object and then 
selecting and coloring individual lines or shapes. For more information, see the section 
“Deconstructing and Editing a Clip” later in this chapter.
On a more basic level, PowerPoint 2013 provides a Recolor option that enables you to apply 
a single-color wash to an image based on any of the theme’s colors or any ﬁ xed color. To 
apply a color wash to a clip, follow these steps:
 
1. Insert the clip on a slide in PowerPoint, and then select the clip. The Picture 
Tools Format tab becomes available.
 
2. On the Picture Tools Format tab, click Color to open the menu shown in 
Figure 11.8.

342
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 11.8
Select a color wash to apply to the clip.
 
3. Click the color wash that you want to apply, or click More Variations to choose 
another color.
More Variations opens a palette from which you can select light and dark tints of the theme colors or standard (fi xed) 
colors. You can also choose More Colors to open a Color dialog box for more fi xed colors.
Setting a Transparent Color
Some clips enable you to redeﬁ ne one of the colors as see-through so that anything behind 
it shows through. This doesn’t work on all clips because most clips already have a color 
deﬁ ned as transparent: the background. This is why a clip-art image appears to ﬂ oat 
directly on a colored background rather than being locked into a rectangle. However, for 
clips that do not have a transparent color already deﬁ ned, you can deﬁ ne one.

343
Chapter 11: Working with Clip Art and Photos
11
Setting a transparent color works best on clip art; in a photograph, an area that looks at fi rst glance like a single 
color is often actually dozens of different shades of the same overall tint, and setting the transparent color sets only 
one of those many shades to be transparent.
To set a transparent color, open the Color menu, as in the preceding section (Figure 11.8). 
Then choose Set Transparent Color, and click a color in the image.
Deconstructing and Editing a Clip
Have you ever wished that you could open a clip-art image in an image-editing program 
and make some small change to it? Well, you can. And what’s more, you can do it without 
leaving PowerPoint.
Because clip art is composed of vector-graphic lines and ﬁ lls, you can literally take it apart 
piece by piece. Not only can you apply certain colors (as in the preceding section), but you 
can also choose individual lines and shapes from it to recolor, move, and otherwise modify.
Not all items that you ﬁ nd during a clip art search are vector graphic images that can be 
deconstructed and edited. Photos cannot be, for example.To deconstruct a piece of clip art, 
follow these steps:
 
1. After placing the clip on a slide, right-click the clip and choose Edit Picture. A 
message appears telling you that it is an imported picture and asking whether you 
want to convert it to a Microsoft Ofﬁ ce drawing object.
Converting a clip resets previous color adjustments you may have made.
 
2. Click Yes. Each individual shape and line in the clip is now a separate object that 
you can select individually.
To recolor an individual line or shape, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the line or shape to be modified within the image. Selection handles 
appear around it.
 
2. Click Drawing Tools Format ➪ Shape Styles ➪ Shape Fill and select a fill color. 
See Figure 11.9.
 
3. Click Drawing Tools Format ➪ Shape Styles ➪ Shape Outline and select an out-
line color.
To move the pieces of the clip around, just drag the selected piece where you want it. If a 
particular piece doesn’t move separately from the rest, right-click the image and choose 

344
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Group ➪ Ungroup to break up the image into individual shapes, and then the shape you 
want to move will be individually movable.
FIGURE 11.9
Change the fi ll color of an individual shape within the clip.
Select a shape within
the clip to recolor it.
Understanding Raster Graphics
As I explained in Chapter 9 and also earlier in this chapter, there are two kinds of graphics 
in the computer world: vector and raster. Vector graphics (clip art, drawn lines and shapes, 
and so on) are created with mathematical formulas. Some of the advantages of vector 
graphics are their small ﬁ le size and the fact that they can be resized without losing any 
quality. The main disadvantage of a vector graphic is that it doesn’t look “real.” Even when 
an expert artist draws a vector graphic, you can still tell that it’s a drawing, not a photo-
graph. For example, perhaps you’ve seen the game The Sims. Those characters and objects 
are 3-D vector graphics. They look pretty good but there’s no way you would mistake them 
for real people and objects.

345
Chapter 11: Working with Clip Art and Photos
11
In the rest of this chapter, we’ll be working mostly with raster graphics — in other words, 
digital photos, like the ones you might take with your own digital camera or phone. A 
raster graphic is made up of a very ﬁ ne grid of individual colored pixels (dots). The grid is 
sometimes called a bitmap. Each pixel has a unique numeric value representing its color. 
Figure 11.10 shows a close-up of a raster image. You can create raster graphics from scratch 
with a “paint” program on a computer, but a more common way to acquire a raster graphic 
is by using a scanner or digital camera as an input device.
FIGURE 11.10
A raster graphic, normal size (right) and zoomed in to show individual pixels (left)
The term bitmap is sometimes used to refer generically to any raster graphic, but it is also a specifi c fi le format for 
raster graphics, with a .bmp fi lename extension. 
Because there are so many individual pixels and each one must be represented numerically, 
raster graphics are much larger than vector graphics. They take longer to load into the PC’s 
memory, take up more space when you store them as separate ﬁ les on disk, and make your 
PowerPoint presentation ﬁ le much larger. You can compress a raster graphic so that it takes 

346
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
up less space on disk, but the quality may suffer. Therefore, it’s best to use vector graphics 
when you want simple lines, shapes, or cartoons and reserve raster graphics for situations 
where you need photographic quality.
The following sections explain some of the technical speciﬁ cations behind raster graphics; 
you’ll need this information to make the right decisions about the way you capture the 
images with your scanner or digital camera and the way you use them in PowerPoint.
Resolution
The term resolution has two subtly different meanings. One is the size of an image, 
expressed in the number of pixels of width and height, such as 800 × 600. The other mean-
ing is the number of pixels per inch when the image is printed, such as 100 dots per inch 
(dpi). The former meaning is used mostly when referring to images of ﬁ xed physical size, 
such as the display resolution of a monitor. In this book, the latter meaning is mostly used.
If you know the resolution of the picture (that is, the number of pixels in it) and the reso-
lution of the printer on which you will print it (for example, 300 dpi), you can ﬁ gure out 
how large the picture will be in inches when you print it at its native size. Suppose you 
have a picture that is 900 pixels square and you print it on a 300 dpi printer. This makes it 
3” square on the printout.
Resolution on Preexisting Graphics Files
When you acquire an image ﬁ le from an outside source, such as downloading it from a web-
site or getting it from a CD of artwork, its resolution has already been determined. Whoever 
created the ﬁ le originally made that decision. For example, if the image was originally 
scanned on a scanner, whoever scanned it chose the scan resolution — that is, the dpi set-
ting. That determined how many individual pixels each inch of the original picture would 
be divided into. At a 100 dpi scan, each inch of the picture is represented by 100 pixels 
vertically and horizontally. At 300 dpi, each inch of the picture is broken down into three 
times that many.
If you want to make a graphic take up less disk space, you can use an image-editing pro-
gram to change the image size, and/or you can crop off one or more sides of the image.
If you crop or decrease the size of an image in an image-editing program, save the changes under a different fi le-
name. Maintain the original image in case you ever need it for some other purpose. Decreasing the image resolution 
decreases its dpi setting, which decreases its quality. You might not notice any quality degradation on-screen, but 
you will probably notice a difference when you are printing the image at a large size. That’s because the average 
monitor displays only 96 dpi but the average printer prints at 600 dpi or higher.
PowerPoint slides do not usually need to be printed at a professional-quality resolution, so image quality on a 
PowerPoint printout is not usually an issue. However, if you use the picture for something else later, such as printing 
it as a full-page color image on photo paper, then a high dpi fi le can make a difference.

347
Chapter 11: Working with Clip Art and Photos
11
Resolution on Graphics You Scan Yourself
When you create an image ﬁ le yourself by using a scanner, you choose the resolution, 
expressed in dpi, through the scanner software. For example, suppose you scan a 4” × 6” 
photo at 100 dpi. The scanner will break down each 1” section of the photo horizontally and 
vertically into 100 separate pieces and decide on a numeric value that best represents the 
color of each piece. The result is a total number of pixels of 4 × 100 × 6 × 100, or 240,000 
pixels. Assuming each pixel requires 3 bytes of storage, the ﬁ ll becomes approximately 
720KB in size. The actual size varies slightly depending on the ﬁ le format.
Now, suppose you scan the same photo at 200 dpi. The scanner breaks down each 1” sec-
tion of the photo into 200 pieces so that the result is 4 × 200 × 6 × 200, or 960,000 pixels. 
Assuming again that 1 pixel requires 3 bytes for storage (24 bits), the ﬁ le will be approxi-
mately 2.9MB in size. That’s a big difference.
The higher the resolution in which you scan, the larger the ﬁ le becomes, but the details of 
the scan also become ﬁ ner. However, unless you are zooming in on the photo, you cannot 
tell a difference between 100 dpi and a higher resolution. That’s because most computer 
monitors display at 96 dpi, so any resolution higher than that does not improve the output.
Let’s look at an example. In Figure 11.11 you can see two copies of an image open in 
a graphics program. The same photo was scanned at 75 dpi (left) and 150 dpi (right). 
However, the difference between them is not signiﬁ cant when the two images are placed on 
a PowerPoint slide, as shown in Figure 11.12. The lower-resolution image is at the top left, 
but there is no observable difference in the size at which they are being used. 
FIGURE 11.11
At high magnifi cation, the difference in dpi for a scan is apparent.

When the image is used at a normal size, there is virtually no difference between a high-dpi 
and low-dpi scan.

150 dpi
Scanners and Color Depth
If you are shopping for a scanner, you will probably notice that they’re advertised with higher numbers 
of bits than the graphics formats support. This is for error correction. If there are extra bits, it can throw 
out the bad bits to account for “noise” and still end up with a full set of good bits. Error correction in a 
scan is a rather complicated process, but fortunately your scanner driver software takes care of it for you.
Resolution on Digital Camera Photos
Top-quality digital cameras today take very high-resolution pictures, much higher than you 
will need for an on-screen PowerPoint presentation. At a typical size and magniﬁ cation, a 
high-resolution graphic ﬁ le is overkill; it wastes disk space needlessly. Therefore, you may 
want to adjust the camera’s image size so that it takes lower-resolution pictures for your 
PowerPoint show.

349
Chapter 11: Working with Clip Art and Photos
11
However, if you think you might want to use those same pictures for some other purpose 
in the future, such as printing them in a magazine or newsletter, then go ahead and take 
them with the camera’s highest setting, but then compress them in PowerPoint or resize 
copies of them in a third-party image-editing program. See the section “Compressing 
Images” later in this chapter to learn how.
Color Depth
Color depth is the number of bits required to describe the color of a single pixel in the 
image. For example, in 1-bit color, a single binary digit represents each pixel. Each pixel is 
either black (1) or white (0). In 4-bit color, there are 16 possible colors because there are 
16 combinations of 1s and 0s in a four-digit binary number. In 8-bit color there are 256 
combinations.
For most ﬁ le formats, the highest number of colors you can have in an image is 16.7 million 
colors, which is 24-bit color (also called true color). It uses 8 bits each for red, green, and 
blue.
There is also 32-bit color, which has the same number of colors as 24-bit but adds 8 more 
bits for an alpha channel. The alpha channel describes the amount of transparency for each 
pixel. This is not so much an issue for single-layer graphics, but in multilayer graphics, 
such as the ones you can create in high-end graphics programs like Photoshop, the extent 
to which a lower layer shows through an upper one is important.
For a great article on alpha channel usage in PowerPoint by Geetesh Bajaj, go to www.indezine.com/prod-
ucts/powerpoint/ppalpha.html.
A color depth of 48-bit is fairly new, and it’s just like 24-bit color except it uses 16 rather 
than 8 bits to deﬁ ne each of the three channels: red, green, and blue. It does not have an 
alpha channel bit. Because the human eye cannot detect the small differences it intro-
duces, 48-bit color depth is not really necessary. Of the graphics formats that PowerPoint 
supports, only PNG and TIFF support 48-bit color depth.
Normally, you should not decrease the color depth of a photo to less than 24-bit unless 
there is a major issue with lack of disk space that you cannot resolve any other way. To 
decrease the color depth, you would need to open the graphic ﬁ le in a third-party image-
editing program and use the command in that program for decreasing the number of colors. 
Before going through that, try compressing the images in the presentation (see the section 
“Compressing Images” later in the chapter) to see if that solves the problem.
File Format
Many scanners scan in JPEG format by default, but most also support TIF, and some also 
support other formats. Images you acquire from a digital camera are almost always JPEG. 

350
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Images from other sources may be any of dozens of graphics formats, including PCX, BMP, 
GIF, or PNG.
Different graphic formats can vary tremendously in the size and quality of the image they 
produce. The main differentiators between formats are the color depth they support and 
the type of compression they use (which determines the ﬁ le size).
Remember earlier how I explained that each pixel in a 24-bit image requires 3 bytes? (That’s 
derived by dividing 24 by 8 because there are 8 bits in a byte.) Then you multiply that by 
the height and then by the width to determine the image size. Well, that formula was not 
completely accurate because it does not include compression. Compression is an algorithm 
(basically a math formula) that decreases the amount of space that the ﬁ le takes up on the 
disk by storing the data about the pixels more compactly. A ﬁ le format will have one of 
these three states in regard to compression:
 
■No compression. The image is not compressed.
 
■Lossless compression. The image is compressed, but the algorithm for doing so 
does not throw out any pixels so there is no loss of image quality when you resize 
the image.
 
■Lossy compression. The image is compressed by recording less data about the pix-
els, so when you resize the image, there may be a loss of image quality.
Table 11.1 provides a brief guide to some of the most common graphic formats. Generally 
speaking, for most on-screen presentations JPEG should be your preferred choice for graph-
ics because it is compact and Web-accessible (although PNG is also a good choice and uses 
lossless compression).

your hard disk. You can always save a copy in JPEG or other formats when you need them for specifi c projects. The TIF 
format’s compression is lossless, so it results in a high-quality image.
Inserting Photos
Now that you know all about the factors that go into creating and selecting raster images, 
it’s time to get down to the business of inserting the images on your PowerPoint slides. In 
the following sections you will learn to do just that. You’ll ﬁ nd out how to acquire photos 
via a Bing search for situations in which you don’t already have what you need and how to 
insert images from your own computer that you have already acquired.
Searching for Photos with Bing
Bing is Microsoft’s search engine on the Web, and PowerPoint has a built-in interface for 
using Bing’s image search capabilities to ﬁ nd photos you can use in your presentations. It’s 

352
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
something like the clip-art search you learned about earlier in this chapter, but the search 
results are not conﬁ ned to just Microsoft’s own servers, and only photos (raster-based 
images) are shown.
To search for a photo with Bing and place it in your presentation, follow these steps:
 
1. Display the slide on which you want to place the image.
 
2. Click the Online Pictures icon in the content placeholder, or choose Insert ➪ 
Images ➪ Online Pictures. The Insert Pictures dialog box opens. It’s the same dia-
log box as in Figure 11.2 earlier in the chapter.
 
3. Click in the Search Bing text box and type the keyword to search for. Then

By default, the Bing image search results contain only images that are licensed under Creative Commons. That 
means that you can use the images in your work without having to pay a fee or royalty to the owner. When the search 
results appear, a message explains that the search results are fi ltered as such. If you want to see all images, even 
the ones that you aren’t necessarily entitled to legally use. Click the Show All Web Results button in the message bar

4. Click the image you want to insert, and click the Insert button. The image is 
downloaded to your PC and inserted on the slide. From here you can work with it 
just as if it was any other photo.
Inserting Pictures from Files
If you already have the picture(s) you want to use, you can insert them from your own 
computer’s drive using the Pictures button on the Insert tab. Assuming you have already 
acquired the images you need, use the following steps to insert one into PowerPoint:
 
1. Display the slide on which you want to place the image.
 
2. If the slide has a content placeholder for pictures, as in Figure 11.14, click it. 
Otherwise, choose Insert ➪ Images ➪ Pictures. The Insert Picture dialog box opens. 
The default location shown is the Pictures library on your local hard disk.
FIGURE 11.14
You can insert a picture by using the Pictures content placeholder icon.

3. Select the picture to import. See Figure 11.15. You can switch the view by using 
the View (or Views) button in the dialog box to see thumbnails or details if either is 
effective in helping you determine which ﬁ le is which.

4. Click Insert. The picture is inserted.
If you have a lot of graphics in different formats, consider narrowing down the list that appears by selecting a specifi c 
fi le type from the fi le type list. By default it is set to All Pictures.
Linking to a Graphic File
If you have a sharp eye, you may have noticed that the Insert button in Figure 11.15 has a 
drop-down list associated with it. That list has these choices:
 
■Insert. The default, inserts the graphic but maintains no connection.
 
■Link to File. Creates a link to the ﬁ le, but does not maintain a local copy of it in 
PowerPoint.
 
■Insert and Link. Creates a link to the ﬁ le, and also inserts a local copy of its cur-
rent state, so if the linked copy is not available in the future, the local copy will 
still appear.
Use Link to File whenever you want to insert a pointer rather than the original. When the 
presentation opens, it pulls in the graphic from the disk. If the graphic is not available, it 
displays an empty frame with a red X in the corner in the graphic’s place. Using Link to File 
keeps the size of the original PowerPoint ﬁ le very small because it doesn’t actually contain 
the graphic — it only links to it. However, if you move or delete the graphic, PowerPoint 
won’t be able to ﬁ nd it anymore.
The important thing to know about this link in the Link to File feature is that it is not the 
same thing as an OLE link. This is not a dynamic link that you can manage. It is a much simpler 
link and much less ﬂ exible. You can’t change the ﬁ le location to which it is linked, for example; 
if the location of the graphic changes, you must delete it from PowerPoint and reinsert it.
If you are building a graphic-heavy presentation on an older computer, you might fi nd that it takes a long time to 
move between slides and for each graphic to appear. You can take some of the hassle away by using Link to File 
instead of inserting the graphics. Then temporarily move the graphic fi les to a subfolder so PowerPoint can’t fi nd 
them. It displays the placeholders for the graphics on the appropriate slides, and the presentation fi le is much faster 
to page through and edit. Then when you are ready to fi nish up, close PowerPoint and move the graphic fi les back to 
their original locations so PowerPoint can fi nd them again when you reopen the presentation fi le.
Capturing and Inserting Screenshots
A screenshot is a picture that you take of your computer screen using Windows itself (or a 
screen capture utility). Most of the images in this book are screenshots. You might want 
to take screenshots to illustrate the steps in a computer-based procedure and then create a 

355
Chapter 11: Working with Clip Art and Photos
11
PowerPoint presentation that teaches others to perform that procedure. You can also take 
screen shots on some mobile devices. 
Windows has always had a basic screenshot capability built into it: the Print Screen key. 
You can press Print Screen at any time to copy an image of the screen to the Clipboard. 
Then you can paste directly onto your slide, or you can open a graphics-editing program 
such as Paint and paste from the Clipboard to save the ﬁ le. 
In PowerPoint 2013, you can also capture and insert screenshots directly, bypassing the 
Clipboard and an outside graphics program. The Screenshot command in PowerPoint also 
enables you to capture individual windows rather than the entire screen.
To capture a screenshot of an open window, follow these steps:
 
1. Open the window for which you want to capture the screenshot. Do not mini-
mize it.
 
2. Switch to PowerPoint, and display the slide on which you want to place the 
screenshot.
 
3. Choose Insert ➪ Screenshot. A menu appears showing thumbnails of the available 
windows. See Figure 11.16. 
FIGURE 11.16
Capture a window using the Screenshot command.
Thumbnail images of
the other open windows
 
4. Click the thumbnail image of the window you want to capture. The image is 
immediately inserted as a new picture on the active slide.
The Screenshot command does not show every open window as a thumbnail; it shows each tab of Internet Explorer 
and each open Offi ce application window except for PowerPoint itself. If you want to capture a window other than the 
ones shown in the thumbnails, you must use the Screen Clipping command.

356
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
If the window you want does not appear on the thumbnails list, or if you want different 
cropping, use the Screen Clipping command instead. Follow these steps:
 
1. Display the window that you want to capture.
 
2. Using the taskbar, switch to PowerPoint.
 
3. Choose Insert ➪ Screenshot ➪ Screen Clipping. The PowerPoint window is mini-
mized, and the window immediately beneath it appears, with a whitewash overlay 
on it.
 
4. Click and drag to define the rectangular area you want to crop. When you 
release the mouse button, the deﬁ ned area appears in PowerPoint as a new image.
If you need better cropping than you can get with the Screenshot command, use the cropping techniques in the fol-
lowing section to fi ne-tune the crop after insertion into PowerPoint. If you need more robust screen capture capabili-
ties, consider an application that is specifi cally designed for screen captures such as SnagIt (snagit.com).
Sizing and Cropping Photos
After placing a picture on a slide, you will probably need to adjust its size, and/or crop 
it, to make it ﬁ t in the allotted space the way you want it. The following sections explain 
these techniques.
Sizing a Photo
Sizing a photo is just like sizing any other object. Drag its selection handles. Drag a corner 
to maintain the aspect ratio, or drag a side to distort it. (Distorting a photo is seldom a 
good idea, though, unless you’re after some weird funhouse effect.)
You can also specify an exact size for a photo the same as for drawn objects. Right-click the 
photo and choose Size and Position to set a size in the Format Picture task pane (see 
Figure 11.17). Alternatively, you can display the Picture Tools Format tab and then use the 
Height and Width boxes in the Size group, also shown in Figure 11.17.
The most straightforward way to specify the size is in inches in the Height and Width 
boxes, either in the dialog box or on the tab. These measurements correspond to the mark-
ers on the on-screen ruler in Normal view. The size of a slide varies depending on how you 
have it set up (by using the Page Setup tab), but an average slide size is 10 inches wide by 
7.5 inches tall. You can also size the photo using the Scale controls in the Size and Position 
dialog box, in which you adjust the size based on a percentage of the original size.
Note that the scale is based on the original size, not the current size. So, for example, if you 
set Height and Width to 50%, close the dialog box, and then reopen it and set them each to 

357
Chapter 11: Working with Clip Art and Photos
11
75%, the net result will be 75% of the original, not 75% of the 50%. However, you can over-
ride this by deselecting the Relative to Original Picture Size check box (see Figure 11.17). 
FIGURE 11.17
Size a photo via either the dialog box or the Format tab.
Size controls
in taskbar
Size group
If you are setting up a presentation for the primary purpose of showing full-screen graphics, 
you can use the Best Scale for Slide Show check box (see Figure 11.17). This enables you to 
choose a screen resolution, such as 640 × 480 or 800 × 600, and size the pictures so that they 
will show to the best advantage in that resolution. Choose the resolution that corresponds to 
the display setting on the PC on which you will show the presentation. To determine what the 
resolution is on the PC, right-click the Windows Desktop and choose Screen Resolution.
When possible, develop your presentation at the same Windows screen resolution as the PC on which you present the 
show. Many digital projectors display at 1024 × 768.
Cropping a Photo
Cropping is for those times you want only a part of the image. For example, you might have a 
great photo of a person or animal, but there is extraneous detail around it, as shown in Figure 
11.18. You can crop away all but the important object in the image with a cropping tool.

358
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 11.18
This picture can benefi t from cropping.
Crop button
Crop handles appear
in corners and on
sides of image.
Here’s something important to know: Cropping and sizing a picture in PowerPoint does not reduce the overall size of 
the PowerPoint presentation fi le. When you insert a picture, PowerPoint stores the whole thing at its original size and 
continues to store it that way regardless of any manipulations you perform on it within PowerPoint. That’s why it’s 
recommended throughout this chapter that you do any editing of the photo in a third-party image-editing program 
before you import it into PowerPoint.
However, there’s a workaround. If you use the Compress Pictures option (covered later in this chapter), it discards 
any cropped portions of the images. That means the fi le size decreases with the cropping and that you can’t reverse 
the cropping later.
You can crop two sides at once by cropping at the corner of the image, or you can crop each 
side individually by cropping at the sides. To crop an image, do the following:
 
1. Select the image so the Picture Tools Format tab becomes available.
 
2. Click Picture Tools Format ➪ Size. Your mouse pointer changes to a cropping tool 
(see Figure 11.18).
 
3. Position the pointer over one of the selection handles on the image frame, and 
drag toward the center until the image is cropped the way you want.

359
Chapter 11: Working with Clip Art and Photos
11
 
4. Repeat step 3 for each side. Then click the Crop button again, or press Esc, to turn 
cropping off.
 
5. Resize the cropped image if needed.
Figure 11.19 shows the result of cropping and resizing the image from Figure 11.18.
FIGURE 11.19
The picture has been improved by cropping and resizing it.
To undo a crop, reenter cropping mode by clicking the Crop button again, and then drag the 
side(s) back outward again. Or you can simply reset the photo, as described in the following 
section.
You can also crop to a shape or crop to a particular aspect ratio (that is, ratio of height to 
width).
Cropping to a shape crops the picture so that it ﬁ ts inside one of the drawing shapes that 
PowerPoint provides, such as a star, triangle, or arrow. 
To crop to a shape, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the picture.
 
2. On the Picture Tools Format tab, click the down arrow under the Crop button, 
and point to Crop to Shape. A palette of shapes appears, as shown in Figure 11.20.
 
3. Click the shape to which you want the picture cropped.
After cropping to a shape, you’ll notice the central part of the image might not be exactly 
centered within the shape. To adjust the centering of the picture within the crop area, 
right-click the picture and choose Format Picture to open the Format Picture task pane. 

360
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Click the Picture icon (rightmost icon), and then adjust the values in the Crop section, as 
shown in Figure 11.21. 
FIGURE 11.20
You can crop a picture to a shape.
You can also crop to an aspect ratio. PowerPoint offers several preset ratios to choose from 
that correspond to common picture sizes, such as 2:3, 3:4, and 3:5. Here’s how to apply an 
aspect ratio crop:
 
1. Select the picture.
 
2. On the Picture Tools Format tab, click the down arrow under the Crop button, 
and point to Aspect Ratio. A list of ratios appears.
 
3. Click the ratio you want to use. Crop marks appear on the image, and the portion 
of the image that will be excluded appears in gray. 
 
4. Drag the crop markers to adjust the crop as desired, and then click the Crop 
button or press Esc on your keyboard to finalize the cropping operation.

361

FIGURE 11.21
Set a precise amount of cropping in the Format Picture task pane.
You can also crop “by the numbers” with the Crop settings in the Format Picture dialog 
box. Here’s how to do that:
 
1. Select the picture.
 
2. Right-click the picture and choose Format Picture to display the Format 
Picture task pane.
 
3. Click the Picture icon (rightmost icon) and then click Crop if needed to expand 
the Crop section.
 
4. Use the controls under Picture Position (see Figure 11.21) to manually enter 
cropping amounts for each side. 
To crop from the bottom, decrease the Height setting; to crop from the right, decrease the Width setting. The Left 
and Top settings crop from those sides, respectively.

362
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
You cannot uncrop after compressing the picture (assuming you use the default compression options that include 
deleting cropped areas of pictures). By default, saving compresses and makes crops permanent, so be sure to undo 
any unwanted cropping before you save.
Resetting a Photo
Once the picture is in PowerPoint, any manipulations you do to it are strictly on the sur-
face. It changes how the picture appears on the slide, but it doesn’t change how the picture 
is stored in PowerPoint. Consequently, you can reset the picture back to its original set-
tings at any time (provided you have not compressed the picture). This resetting also clears 
any changes you make to the image’s size, contrast, and brightness (contrast and bright-
ness changes are discussed in the next section). 
To reset the picture, right-click it and choose Format Picture to display the Format Picture 
task pane. Click the Size & Properties icon (third from left), and in the Size section, click 
the Reset button. 
Adjusting and Correcting Photos
PowerPoint has some powerful features for adjusting, correcting, and applying artistic 
effects to photos. Not only can you adjust the brightness and contrast, but you can sharpen 
or soften an image, tint it, make it black and white, and apply several types of artistic 
effects to it that make it look like it was created in some other medium, such as charcoal 
pencil or collage.
Applying Brightness and Contrast Corrections
You can adjust the brightness and contrast for any photo in PowerPoint, and you can adjust 
the sharpness or softness of the image.
Brightness refers to the overall level of light in a picture. The brighter the setting, the 
lighter each pixel of the image is. Brightness does not affect the color hues. You might 
increase the brightness on a photo that was taken in a dimly lit room, for example.
Contrast refers to the difference between the lighter areas and the darker areas of the 
photo. Adjusting contrast makes the lights lighter and the darks darker. Increasing the 
contrast of a picture makes its image more distinct; this can be good for an older, washed-
out picture, for example.
Sharpness/softness is controlled with a slider, with the default being right in the middle 
between them. When you sharpen an image, the edges of the objects in the picture appear 
more distinct; when you soften an image, the edges are blurred. PowerPoint ﬁ nds the edges 

363
Chapter 11: Working with Clip Art and Photos
11
of objects by looking for areas where the color changes dramatically from one spot to the 
adjacent one.
The easiest way to access those controls is through the Corrections button on the Picture 
Tools Format tab. Click the button and then click one of the preset thumbnails, as shown in 
Figure 11.22. Brightness and contrast are two separately adjustable settings, but the presets 
on the menu shown in Figure 11.22 combine them. In the Brightness/Contrast section, the 
sample in the upper-left corner decreases both, and the sample in the lower right increases 
both. In between, the samples combine settings in various ways. Point at a sample to see a 
pop-up ScreenTip listing its speciﬁ cs.
FIGURE 11.22
Choose sharpen/soften, brightness, and contrast presets.
Center value in each
section represents the
default (unaltered) image.
To choose a value other than the ones listed, click Picture Corrections Options to open the 
Format Picture task pane to the Picture Corrections controls. From here you can choose 
presets, or you can drag sliders or enter exact percentages for each setting individually. See 
Figure 11.23.
Recoloring a Picture
Several color options are available from the Color button’s drop-down list on the Picture 
Tools Format tab. You can apply color washes to the image, make it black and white or 

364
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
grayscale, make it look washed out, and more. You can point at a sample to see a preview of 
it on the selected image.
FIGURE 11.23
Drag sliders to adjust brightness, contrast, and sharpen or soften settings individually.
The Color menu has three sections (see Figure 11.24):
 
■Color Saturation. This refers to the vibrancy of the colors. At the low end is gray-
scale — no colors at all, or 0% saturation. The center point is 100% saturation, 
the default. At the high end is a very vividly colored version of the image at 400% 
saturation. 
 
■Color Tone. The presets in this section enable you to adjust the “temperature” of 
the image, from very cool (increased blue and green) to very warm (increased red 
and yellow). Color tones are measured numerically; the higher the number, the 
warmer the tone. 4700 Kelvin (K) is very cool; 11200 K is very warm. 
Color temperature is measured by something called the Kruithof curve. It is named after Dutch physicist Arie Andries 
Kruithof, and it describes and assigns numeric values to colors like blue and green as cooler than colors like red and 
yellow. The temperatures are expressed on the Kelvin temperature scale (K). 

365
Chapter 11: Working with Clip Art and Photos
11
 
■Recolor. These presets enable you to radically adjust the colors of the image by 
choosing a grayscale, sepia, black-and-white, washout, or other preset or by apply-
ing a colored wash over the picture. Here’s where you’ll ﬁ nd the equivalent settings 
to the Recolor presets from earlier versions of PowerPoint, but also many more 
options. For more colors to choose from, point to More Variations and choose from 
the ﬂ y-out palette of colors. The last two rows of colors (darks and lights) are based 
on the theme colors.
FIGURE 11.24
Choose color presets to apply to the image.
You can also choose Picture Color Options from the menu in Figure 11.24 to open the Format 
Picture task pane and display the Picture Color settings. Here you’ll ﬁ nd buttons that open 
menus with the same presets as on the menu and also sliders for ﬁ ne-tuning the Saturation 
and Temperature.
In most areas of PowerPoint, the task pane method provides more fl exibility than the menu method. One exception 
is when recoloring an image. On the Color button’s menu you have more presets to choose from as well as a More 
Variations command that provides access to even more colors. In contrast, in the Format Picture task pane, fewer 
presets are available, and there is no way to choose an alternative color from a palette from there.

366
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Setting a Transparent Color and Removing a Background
The Transparent Color feature, which you also learned about earlier in this chapter, can be 
used to remove one of the colors from the photo, making the areas transparent that were 
previously occupied by that color. For example, suppose you have a scanned photo of your 
CEO and you want to make the background transparent so it looks like his head is sitting 
right on the slide. This feature could help you out with that.
To set a transparent color, select the image and then choose Picture Tools 
Format ➪ Color ➪ Set Transparent Color. Then, on the image, click an area that contains the 
color you want to make transparent.
Setting a transparent color sounds like a great idea, but in reality it does not work as well 
with photos as it does with clip art. For one thing, it replaces all instances of that color, 
not just in the background. So, for example, if you have a picture of a man with a white 
shirt on a white background and choose to make white the transparent color (because you 
want to drop out the background), the man’s shirt becomes transparent too.
Another reason it doesn’t work that well on photos is that what looks like one color in a 
photo is not usually just one color. Think of a blue sky, for example. It probably consists 
of at least two dozen different shades of blue. If you try to make one of those shades of 
blue transparent using PowerPoint’s transparency tool, you’ll probably just end up with 
splotches of transparent areas.
So what’s the solution? One workaround is to use alpha channels in a third-party image-
editing program to create true transparency and save the image as TIF or PNG. (JPEG format 
does not support alpha channels.) An easier way, however, is to use PowerPoint’s Remove 
Background command. It can do the trick in many cases and is easier to use than most 
photo-editing programs.
To remove the background, select the picture and then choose Picture Tools Format ➪ 
Remove Background. The Background Removal tab becomes available, and the areas of the 
image that PowerPoint plans to remove appear with a purple wash over them (shown in 
Figure 11.25).
If PowerPoint has correctly guessed at the edges of the image subject, click Keep Changes 
to accept the background removal as is.
If it has not gotten it quite right, do any of the following to make corrections:
 
■PowerPoint-generated border. A dotted border appears around what PowerPoint 
thinks is the central part of the image. Drag the selection handles along this border 
to expand it to allow additional parts of the image to be preserved if needed.
 
■To include more image sections. Click Mark Areas to Keep and then drag on the 
image, in the purple shaded areas, to delineate additional parts of the image that 
should not be removed.

367
Chapter 11: Working with Clip Art and Photos
11
 
■To exclude image sections. Click Mark Areas to Remove and then drag on the 
image, in the areas that are not purple shaded, to mark additional parts of the 
image that should be removed.
 
■For mistakes. If you make a mistake and mark an area you shouldn’t have, click 
Delete Mark and then click on that mark.

Applying Artistic Effects
Artistic effects are special types of transformations you can apply to images to make them 
appear as if they were created in some medium other than photography. For example, you 
can make a photo look like a pencil sketch or a painting.

368
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
To apply artistic effects, select the picture and then choose Picture Tools Format ➪ Artistic 
Effects and choose from the menu that appears, as shown in Figure 11.26. Each effect is 
mutually exclusive with the others; when you select a different effect, the previously 
applied effect is removed.
FIGURE 11.26

For more control over the artistic effects, choose Artistic Effects Options. This opens the 
Format Picture task pane with the Artistic Effects settings displayed. From here, after 
selecting one of the effects, you can make ﬁ ne adjustments with the sliders and other con-
trols that appear. There are different controls for different effects; Figure 11.26 shows the 
ones for the Pencil Sketch effect.
Applying Picture Styles and Effects
You can format pictures using the same effects you learned for drawn objects in Chapter 9. 
Click the Picture Effects button on the Format tab, and then choose one of the categories 
there, such as Shadow, Reﬂ ection, Glow, or Bevel. Refer to Chapter 9 for the details of each 
effect type.

Compressing Images
Having an image that is too large (that is, too high a dpi) is not a problem quality wise. You 
can resize it in PowerPoint to make it as small as you like; just drag its selection handles. 
There will be no loss of quality as it gets smaller.
However, as mentioned earlier in the chapter, inserting a picture ﬁ le that is much larger than 
necessary can increase the overall size of the PowerPoint ﬁ le, which can become problematic 
if you plan to distribute the presentation in a form where space or bandwidth is an issue.
To avoid problems with overly large graphic ﬁ les, you can compress the images to reduce 
their resolution and remove any cropped portions. You can do this from within PowerPoint 
or with a third-party utility.

370
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Reducing Resolution and Compressing Images in PowerPoint
PowerPoint offers an image compression utility that compresses all of the pictures in the 
presentation in a single step and reduces their resolution to the amount needed for the 
type of output you specify (e-mail, Screen, or Print).
Picture resolution is measured in PowerPoint in pixels per inch, or ppi. This roughly trans-
lates to dots per inch (dpi) on a printout. A computer screen shows 96 pixels per inch, so 
you do not need higher resolution than that if you are only showing your presentation on-
screen. However, if you are distributing the presentation in other forms, a higher resolu-
tion might be appropriate.
To reduce resolution and compress images, do the following:
 
1. Click a picture so that the Picture Tools Format tab appears.
 
2. Choose Picture Tools Format ➪ Adjust ➪ Compress Pictures. The Compress 
Pictures dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11.28. 
FIGURE 11.28
Click OK to compress with the default settings.

3. (Optional) If you do not want to compress all of the pictures, make sure the 
Apply Only to This Picture check box is marked.
 
4. (Optional) If you wish to save additional space by deleting the cropped-out 
areas of pictures, select the Delete Cropped Areas of Pictures check box.
 
5. Select the desired amount of compression: 
 
■Print (220 ppi). Choose this if you are printing the  presentation on paper; it 
keeps the photos at a resolution where they will look crisp on a printout.
 
■Screen (150 ppi). Choose this if you are displaying the presentation using a 
projector or distributing via the Internet. Some projectors have a higher resolu-
tion than a monitor.
 
■E-mail (96 ppi). Choose this if you are e-mailing the presentation to others 
because this lower setting results in a smaller ﬁ le that will transmit more easily 
via e-mail.
 
■Use Document Resolution. Use this to match the resolution of the pictures to 
the resolution deﬁ ned in PowerPoint Options (File ➪ Options ➪ Advanced).
 
6. Click OK to perform the compression.
Some e-mail servers have limits on the fi le sizes they will accept, so keeping the PowerPoint fi le as small as possible 
when distributing via e-mail is a good idea. If you send someone an e-mail with a large fi le attached to it, the server 
may reject the message, but you might not get an error message back from the server at all, or you might not get one 
for several days.
Reducing Resolution with a Third-Party Utility
Working with resolution reduction from an image-editing program is somewhat of a trial-
and-error process, and you must do each image separately.
You can approximate the correct resolution by simply “doing the math.” For example, suppose 
you have a 10” × 7.5” slide. Your desktop display is set to 800 × 600. So your image needs to 
be 800 pixels wide to ﬁ ll the slide. Your image is a 5” × 3” image, so if you set it to 200 dpi, 
that gives you 1,000 pixels, which is a little larger than you need but in the ballpark.
Exporting a Photo from PowerPoint to a Separate File
What goes in must come out, right? Suppose you have a picture that exists only in 
PowerPoint, for whatever reason. Perhaps it was scanned directly into PowerPoint in an ear-
lier version, for example, and you no longer have access to the original ﬁ le.

372
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
There are two ways to get a graphic out of PowerPoint and make it a separate ﬁ le again: 
You can use the Save As Picture feature in PowerPoint, or you can simply use the Windows 
Clipboard to copy and paste a graphic into an image-editing program.
Exporting a Graphic with Save As Picture
To save a picture separately from PowerPoint, do the following:
 
1. Right-click the picture in PowerPoint and choose Save as Picture.
 
2. In the Save as Picture dialog box, display the location where you want to save 
the file.
 
3. Open the Save as Type list and choose the graphic format you want. You can 
choose TIF, JPEG, or a variety of others. See the discussion of ﬁ le formats earlier in 
this chapter for guidance.
 
4. Enter a name in the File Name box.
 
5. Click Save.
Exporting a Graphic with the Clipboard
Copy-and-paste is a fast and simple way of transferring a graphic from PowerPoint into an 
image-editing program, and from there you can save it in any supported format. Select a 
graphic in PowerPoint, copy it (Ctrl+C), open the graphics program, and paste it (Ctrl+V).
Exporting Entire PowerPoint Slides as Graphics
You can save entire slides — or all slides in the whole presentation — as images. 
Here’s how:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Export ➪ Change File Type.
 
2. Under Image File Types, click the type of graphic you want to create: PNG or 
JPEG. See Figure 11.29. PNG results in a higher-quality, larger image ﬁ le than JPEG.
 
3. Click Save As. The Save As dialog box opens.
 
4. In the Save As dialog box, change the file location and name if desired.
 
5. Click Save. A dialog box appears asking which slides you want to export.
 
6. Click All Slides or Just This One, depending on your preference.
 
7. If you choose All Slides, a message appears that a folder has been created for 
the slide files. Click OK. (Each slide is a separate graphic.)

Creating a Photo Album Layout
Most presentations in PowerPoint are text based, with accompanying photographs. The 
default Blank Presentation template is biased in favor of text. Graphics, as you have seen in 
this chapter, require some extra effort.
The Photo Albums feature in PowerPoint creates a new presentation that is speciﬁ cally 
designed as a carrier of pictures. It is useful when you need to create a presentation that is 
very heavy on graphics, with little or no text except picture captions.

374
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Creating a New Photo Album
When you create a new photo album, it starts a new presentation for you. Any other pre-
sentations that you may have open are not disturbed, and you can switch back to them at 
any time with the View tab. The new presentation has a title slide as well as slides for the 
photos you place in the album.
To start a new photo album, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Insert tab, click Photo Album. (Click the main face of the button, not the 
arrow.) The Photo Album dialog box opens.
 
2. To add a photo from a file, click the File/Disk button. The Insert New Pictures 
dialog box opens.
 
3. Select one or more pictures, and then click Insert. (To select multiple pictures, 
hold down Ctrl or Shift as you click on the ones you want.) The photos appear in 
the Photo Album dialog box as shown in Figure 11.30. 
 
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 as needed to insert all the photos from disk that you 
want.
 
5. For each image on the Pictures in Album list, select the picture and then apply 
any correction needed with the buttons beneath the Preview pane. You can 
rotate right or left, increase or decrease the contrast, and increase or decrease the 
brightness.
 
6. Use the arrows to move an image up or down in the order.
 
7. In the Album Layout section, open the Picture Layout box and choose the lay-
out for the presentation slides. For example, in Figure 11.30, Fit to Slide has been 
chosen.
 
8. If available, choose a frame shape from the Frame Shape list. Some choices from 
step 7 do not permit a frame shape to be chosen.
You can create themes specifi cally for photo albums and then use them here by clicking the Browse button to browse 
for a theme. You might also want to experiment with the photo album themes in the dialog box when you create the 
photo album initially.
 
9. (Optional) To add caption boxes for each picture, select the Captions Below ALL 
Pictures check box.
 
10. (Optional) To show the pictures in black and white, select the ALL Pictures 
Black and White check box.
 
11. Click Create. PowerPoint creates the new presentation containing the photos and 
the layout you speciﬁ ed.
 
12. Save the photo album (File ➪ Save) as a presentation.

Modifying a Photo Album
You can reopen the dialog box from Figure 11.30 by clicking the down arrow beneath the 
Photo Album button on the Insert tab and choosing Edit Photo Album.
You can also modify the slides in the presentation individually. These are just regular, edit-
able slides, and you can add anything to them that you like, including text boxes, clip art, 
and so on. Think of it as an on-screen scrapbook! You can crop the photos inserted via the 
photo album as well.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to insert and manage clip art and how to modify it in 
PowerPoint. You learned about the technical specs for graphics that determine their ﬁ le 
size, quality, and ﬂ exibility, and you learned how to insert them into your presentations. 
You can format a photo and color, crop, and manipulate photos to create special effects.
In the next chapter, you’ll learn how to work with charts. You’ll ﬁ nd out how to take 
advantage of PowerPoint’s graphics-like capabilities for structuring and formatting numeric 
data in chart format.

any times when you include a chart in PowerPoint, it already exists in some other applica-
tion. For example, you might have an Excel workbook that contains some charts that you 
want to use in PowerPoint. If this is the case, you can simply copy and paste them into 
PowerPoint or link or embed them, as you will learn in Chapter 13, “Incorporating Content from 
Other Programs.”
However, when you need to create a quick chart that has no external source, PowerPoint’s charting 
tool is perfect for this purpose. The PowerPoint charting interface is based upon the one in Excel, and 
so you don’t have to leave PowerPoint to create, modify, and format professional-looking charts.
What’s the difference between a chart and a graph? Some purists will tell you that a chart is either a table or a pie 
chart, whereas a graph is a chart that plots data points on two axes, such as a bar chart. However, Microsoft does 
not make this distinction, and neither do I in this book. I use the term chart in this book for either kind.
Understanding the Parts of a Chart
PowerPoint’s charting feature is based upon the same Escher 2.0 graphics engine that is used for 
drawn objects. Consequently, most of what you have learned about formatting objects in earlier 

378
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
chapters (especially Chapters 9, 10, and 11) also applies to charts. For example, you can 
apply shape styles to the individual elements of a chart and apply WordArt styles to chart 
text. However, there are also many chart-speciﬁ c formatting and layout options, as you will 
see throughout this chapter.
The charting feature’s controls in Ofﬁ ce 2013 are different from those in earlier versions, so 
even if you have used charting in earlier versions of PowerPoint, you may still want to refer 
to this chapter to ﬁ nd out where the features are that you want to use.
The sample chart shown in Figure 12.1 contains these elements:
FIGURE 12.1

represents a data series.
 
■Data series. Each different bar color represents a different series: Morning, 
Afternoon, and Evening. 
 
■Legend. Colored squares in the Legend box describe the correlation of each color to 
a data series.
 
■Categories. The North, South, East, and West labels along the bottom of the chart 
are the categories.
 
■Category axis. The horizontal line running across the bottom of the chart is the 
category axis, also called the horizontal axis.
 
■Value axis. The vertical line running up the left side of the chart, with the num-
bers on it, is the value axis, also called the vertical axis.

379
Chapter 12: Working with Charts
12
 
■Data points. Each individual bar is a data point. The numeric value for that data 
point corresponds to the height of the bar, measured against the value axis.
 
■Walls. The walls are the areas behind the data points. On a 3-D chart, as shown in 
Figure 12.1, there are both back and side walls. On a 2-D chart, there is only the 
plot area behind the chart.
 
■Floor. The ﬂ oor is the area on which the data points sit. A ﬂ oor appears only in 
a 3-D chart.
Starting a New Chart
The main difﬁ culty with creating a chart in a non-spreadsheet application such as 
PowerPoint is that there is no data table from which to pull the numbers. Therefore, 
PowerPoint creates charts using data that you have entered in an Excel window. By default, 
it contains sample data, which you can replace with your own data.
You can place a new chart on a slide in two ways: You can either use a chart placeholder 
from a layout or place one manually. Follow these steps to place a chart:
 
1. On the Insert tab, click Chart. Or, click the Insert Chart icon on the content 
placeholder. The Insert Chart dialog box opens (Figure 12.2). 
FIGURE 12.2
Select the desired chart type.

2. In the list at the left, select the desired chart type. Column is selected by default 
(and in Figure 12.2), but you can pick any type you like.
 
3. From the icons along the top of the dialog box, click the icon that best repre-
sents the subtype of chart you want. In Figure 12.2, the Clustered Column type is 
selected. A sample of the selected chart subtype appears below the icons.
See Table 12.1 for an explanation of the chart types. Figure 12.3 and Figure 12.4 
show examples of some of the chart types.
 
4. Click OK. The chart appears on the slide, and an Excel datasheet opens with sample 
data.
 
5. Modify the sample data as needed. To change the range of cells that appear in 
the chart, see the section “Redeﬁ ning the Data Range” later in this chapter. If you 
want, you can then close the Excel window to move it out of the way.
A chart inserted into PowerPoint is an embedded object; it exists only within PowerPoint, even though it is an Excel 
chart.
After you have closed the Excel window, you can open it again by clicking Edit Data on the Chart Tools Design tab.

TABLE 12.1  Chart Types in PowerPoint’s Charting Tool
Type
Description
Column
Vertical bars, optionally with multiple data series. Bars can be 
clustered, stacked, or based on a percentage and either 2-D or 
3-D.
Line
Shows values as points, and connects the points with a line. 
Different series use different colors and/or line styles.
Pie
A circle broken into wedges to show how parts contribute to a 
whole. This de-emphasizes the actual numeric values. In most 
cases, this type is a single-series only. The donut variant is sim-
ilar to a pie but with multiple concentric rings so that multiple 
series can be illustrated. 
Bar
Just like a column chart, but horizontal.
Area
Just like a column chart, but with the spaces fi lled in between 
the bars.
XY (Scatter)
Shows values as points on both axes, but does not connect 
them with a line. However, you can add trend lines. The bub-
ble variant uses bubbles of varying sizes to represent a third 
data variable rather than each data point being a fi xed size.

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Stock 
A special type of chart that is used to show stock prices.
Surface
A 3-D sheet that is used to illustrate the highest and lowest 
points of the data set.
Radar 
Shows changes of data frequency in relation to a center point.
At any point, you can return to your PowerPoint presentation by clicking anywhere outside of the chart on the slide. To 
edit the chart again, you can click the chart to redisplay the chart-specifi c tabs.
If you delete a column or row by selecting individual cells and pressing Delete to clear them, the empty space that these cells 
occupied remains in the chart. To completely remove a row or column from the data range, select the row or column by clicking its 
header (letter for column; number for row) and click Delete on the Home tab in Excel.
Working with Chart Data
After you create a chart, you might want to change the data range on which it is based or 
how this data is plotted. The following sections explain how you can do this.
Plotting by Rows versus by Columns
By default, the columns of the datasheet form the data series. However, if you want, you 
can switch the data around so that the rows form the series. Figure 12.5 and Figure 12.6 
show the same chart plotted both ways so that you can see the difference. (The data for 
this chart appears in the next section of the chapter, in Figure 12.7, in case you want to 
reference it.)
What does the term data series mean? Take a look at Figure 12.5 and Figure 12.6. Notice 
that there is a legend next to each chart that shows what each color (or shade of gray) rep-
resents. Each of these colors, and the label associated with it, is a series. The other variable 
(the one that is not the series) is plotted on the chart’s horizontal axis.
TABLE 12.1   (continued)

383
Chapter 12: Working with Charts
12
FIGURE 12.5
A chart with quarters as the series
FIGURE 12.6
A chart with regions as the series
To switch back and forth between plotting by rows and by columns in the data sheet, click 
the Switch Row/Column button on the Chart Tools Design tab. If the button is not available, 
open the data sheet by choosing Chart Tools Design ➪ Data ➪ Edit Data, and then the but-
ton will become available.
A chart can carry a very different message when you arrange it by rows versus by columns. 
For example, in Figure 12.5, the chart compares the quarters. The message here is about 

384
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
improvement — or lack thereof — over time. Contrast this to Figure 12.6, where the series 
data is the regions. Here, you can compare one region to another. The overriding message 
here is about competition — which division performed the best in each quarter? It’s easy 
to see how the same data can convey very different messages; make sure that you pick the 
arrangement that tells the story that you want to tell in your presentation.
Redefi ning the Data Range
After you have created your chart, you may decide that you need to use more or less data. 
Perhaps you want to exclude a month or quarter of data or to add another region or sales-
person. To add or remove a data series, you can simply edit the datasheet. To do so, follow 
these steps:
 
1. On the Chart Tools Design tab, click Edit Data. The Excel datasheet appears. A 
blue outline appears around the range that is to be plotted, and other colors of 
outlines appear around the ranges containing the labels. The colors of those ranges 
vary depending on the chart type.
 
2. (Optional) To change the data range to be plotted, drag the bottom-right 
corner of the blue outline. For example, in Figure 12.7, the West division is being 
excluded.
You can also enlarge the data range by expanding the blue outline. For example, 
you could enter another series in column E in Figure 12.7 and then extend the 
outline to encompass column E.
FIGURE 12.7
You can redefi ne the range for the chart by dragging the blue outline on the 
datasheet.
Drag the square in the
corner of the range to
change the range.

385
Chapter 12: Working with Charts
12
The preceding steps work well if the range that you want to include is contiguous, but what 
if you wanted to exclude a row or column that is in the middle of the range? To deﬁ ne the 
range more precisely, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Chart Tools Design tab, click Select Data. The Select Data Source dia-
log box opens, shown in Figure 12.8, along with the Excel datasheet if it was not 
already displayed.
FIGURE 12.8
To fi ne-tune the data ranges, you can use the Select Data Source dialog box.
 
2. Do any of the following: 
 
■To remove a series, select it from the Legend Entries (Series) list and click 
Remove.
 
■To add a series, click Add, and then drag across the range on the datasheet to 
enter it into the Edit Series dialog box; then click OK to accept it.
 
■To edit a series, select it in the Legend Entries (Series) list and click Edit. Then 
drag across the range or make a change in the Edit Series dialog box, and click OK. 
 
3. (Optional) To redefine the range from which to pull the horizontal axis labels, 
click the Edit button in the Horizontal (Category) Axis Labels section. A dotted 
outline appears around the current range; drag to redeﬁ ne that range and click OK.
 
4. (Optional) To redefine how empty or hidden cells should be treated, click the 
Hidden and Empty Cells button. In the Hidden and Empty Cell Settings dialog 
box that appears, choose whether to show data in hidden rows and columns and 
whether to deﬁ ne empty cells as gaps in the chart or as zero values. Then click OK. 
The Hidden and Empty Cells Settings dialog box is shown in Figure 12.9. 

386
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 12.9
Specify what should happen when the data range contains blank or hidden cells.
 
5. When you are finished editing the settings for the data ranges, click OK to 
close the Select Data Source dialog box.
 
6. (Optional) Close the Excel datasheet window, or leave it open for later 
reference.
Filtering the Chart Data
New in PowerPoint 2013, you can use the Chart Filters feature to quickly exclude certain 
rows or columns from the chart. When the chart is selected on the slide, a set of three 
icons appears to its right: Chart Elements, Chart Styles, and Chart Filters. If you click Chart 
Filters, a pop-up panel appears with check boxes for each of the series and categories, as 
shown in Figure 12.10. Clear the check box for anything you don’t want to see on the chart, 
and then click Apply. The Select Data hyperlink at the bottom of the panel opens the Select 
Data Source dialog box, the same as in the previous section. 
FIGURE 12.10
Turn off certain series or categories from this panel if desired.

Chart Types and Chart Layout Presets
The default chart is a 2-D clustered column chart. However, there are a lot of alternative 
chart types to choose from. Not all of them will be appropriate for your data, of course, 
but you may be surprised at the different spin on the message that a different chart type 
presents.
Many chart types come in both 2-D and 3-D models, and you can choose which chart type looks most appropriate 
for your presentation. However, try to be consistent. For example, it looks nicer to stay with all 2-D or all 3-D charts 
rather than mixing the types in a presentation.
You can revisit your choice of chart type at any time by following these steps:
 
1. Select the chart, if needed, so that the Chart Tools Design tab becomes 
available.
 
2. Click Chart Tools Design ➪ Type ➪ Change Chart Type. The Change Chart Type dia-
log box opens. It looks just like the Insert Chart dialog box you saw in Figure 12.2. 
 
3. Select the desired type, just as you did when you originally created the chart. 
 
4. Click OK.
This is the basic procedure for the overall chart type selection, but there are also many 
options for ﬁ ne-tuning the layout. The following sections explain these options.
To change the default chart type, right-click the icon for the desired subtype in the Change Chart Type dialog box and 
choose Set as Default Chart.
PowerPoint provides a limited number of preset Quick Layouts for each chart type. A layout 
is a combination of optional chart elements (such as legend, data table, data labels, and so 
on) in a particular arrangement. Quick Layouts are good starting points for creating your 
own layouts, which you will learn about in this chapter. To choose a Quick Layout, click 
Chart Tools Design ➪ Chart Layouts ➪ Quick Layouts and select a layout from the gallery, as 
shown in Figure 12.11. Although you cannot add your own layouts to these presets, you can 
create chart templates, which are basically the same thing with additional formatting set-
tings. See “Working with Chart Templates” later in this chapter.
Working with Chart Elements
Charts are effective only if the audience understands what the data points represent. 
Labels and other descriptive elements on a chart can make all the difference in its usabil-
ity. Figure 12.12 points out some of the various chart elements that you can use.

388

To change the setting for a particular element, choose Chart Tools Design ➪ Chart 
Layouts ➪ Add Chart Element to open a menu of elements. Then point at a particular ele-
ment to see a ﬂ y-out menu with additional options on it. If none of the choices on the ﬂ y-
out menu meet your needs, click More Options to open a task pane with a more extensive 
set of options. The exact name of the More Options command varies depending on the chart 
element; for example, for Chart Title, it is More Title Options. Figure 12.13 shows the ﬂ y-out 
menu for Chart Title. 
FIGURE 12.13
Control individual chart elements from the Add Chart Element button’s menu.
When working with a chart element such as data labels that could potentially affect the whole chart, a single data 
series, or a single data point, make sure you select the part of the chart you want to affect before issuing the com-
mand. For example, to apply data labels to all data points on the whole chart, select the outer frame of the chart 
fi rst, or to add them only to a specifi c data series, select that data series fi rst.
You can also quickly control chart elements with the Chart Elements button that appears 
to the right of the chart when the chart is selected. Mark or clear the check boxes in the 
Chart Elements panel to toggle a particular element on or off. For some elements, if you 
hover the mouse pointer over the option in the panel, a right-pointing triangle appears to 
its right. You can click that triangle for a submenu, as shown in Figure 12.14.

390
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 12.14
Click the Chart Elements icon to the right of a chart for quick access to chart elements.
You can format the text in any of the chart elements just as you format any other text. To 
do this, select the text and then use the controls in the Font group on the Home tab. This 
allows you to choose a font, size, color, alignment, and so on. To format more than one 
chart element at a time, select one, and then hold down Ctrl as you click on other chart 
elements to select them also. 
To quickly increase the size of all text in the chart, select the chart’s outer frame, and then on the Home tab, in the Font group, 
click the Increase Font Size button repeatedly until all text is the desired size.
You can also format a chart element by right-clicking it and choosing Format Name, where 
Name is the type of element. For example, you could right-click the vertical axis title on 
the chart and then choose Format Axis Title. This opens a task pane with controls appro-
priate for the selected chart element. As with other task panes, there are section names 
in all caps at the top, and under the chosen selection name are icons that represent pages 
of options. Within a page of options are smaller uppercase headings indicating collapsible/
expandable sections. Figure 12.15 shows an example.
PowerPoint uses Format task panes that are related to the various parts of the chart. These task panes are 
nonmodal, which means that they can stay open indefi nitely, that their changes are applied immediately, and that 
you don’t have to close the task pane to continue working on the presentation. 

391
Chapter 12: Working with Charts

FIGURE 12.15
Task pane options are organized as shown here.
First, click one of
these categories
of options.
Second, click
one of the icons.
Third, click a heading
to expand the options
under it.
In some cases, the task pane contains only standard formatting controls that you would 
ﬁ nd for any object, such as Border, Fill, Shadow, Glow, Alignment, and so on. These controls 
should already be very familiar to you from Chapter 9, “Drawing and Formatting Objects.” 
In other cases, in addition to the standard formatting types, there is also a unique section 
that contains extra options that are speciﬁ c to the content type. For example, there is a 
Legend Options section in which you can set the position of a legend.
The following sections look at each of the chart elements more closely. These sections 
will not dwell on the basic formatting that you can apply to them (fonts, sizes, borders, 
ﬁ lls, and so on) because this formatting is the same for all of them, as it is with any other 
object. Instead, they concentrate on the options that make each chart element different.
Working with Chart Titles
A chart title is text that typically appears above the chart — and sometimes overlapping it 
— and indicates what the chart represents. Although you would usually want either a chart 

392
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
title or a slide title, but not both, this could vary if you have multiple charts or different 
content on the same slide.
You can select a basic chart title, either above the chart or overlapping it, from the Chart 
Title submenu from the Add Chart Element button’s menu, as shown in Figure 12.13. You 
can also drag the chart title around after placing it. For more options, you can choose More 
Title Options from the bottom of the submenu to open the Format Chart Title task pane. 
However, in this dialog box there is nothing that speciﬁ cally relates to chart titles; the 
available options are for formatting (Fill, Border, and so on), as for any text box.
Working with Axis Titles
An axis title is text that deﬁ nes the category or the unit of measurement on an axis. For 
example, in Figure 12.12, the vertical axis title is Thousands of Units.
Axis titles are deﬁ ned separately for the vertical and the horizontal axes. Click Chart Tools 
Design ➪ Chart Layouts ➪ Add Chart Element ➪ Axis Titles and then select either Primary 
Horizontal or Primary Vertical to toggle one or the other on or off. Alternatively, you can 
click the Chart Elements button to the right of the chart frame and mark the Axis Titles 
check box to turn both of them on at once or point to the right-pointing arrow and then mark 
or clear the Primary Horizontal and Primary Vertical check boxes individually, as shown in 
Figure 12.16. When you turn on an axis title, a text box appears containing default place-
holder text, “Axis Title.” Click in this text box and type your own label to replace it. 
If you turn off an axis title and then turn it back on again, you will need to retype the axis title; it returns to the 
generic placeholder text.
If you’ve plotted any data on a secondary axis, you’ll see Secondary Horizontal and 
Secondary Vertical Axis Title options as well on the submenu.
FIGURE 12.16
Turn axis titles on or off from the Axis Titles submenu.

393
Chapter 12: Working with Charts
12
You can easily select all of the placeholder text by clicking in the text box and pressing Ctrl+A.
For more control, choose More Options from the submenu, or right-click the axis title and 
choose Format Axis Title, to open the Format Axis Title task pane. 
Look back at Figure 12.12 and notice that the vertical axis title runs sideways from top to 
bottom. You can change the text’s orientation for an axis by doing the following:
 
1. Right-click the vertical axis title and choose Format Axis Title. The Format Axis 
Title task pane opens.
 
2. Click Title Options, and then click the Size & Properties icon. The Alignment 
controls appear. See Figure 12.17.
FIGURE 12.17
Select a text direction from the task pane.

394
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
 
3. Open the Text Direction drop-down list and choose the desired text direction.
 
■Horizontal. The title appears horizontally, like regular text, to the left of the 
vertical axis.
 
■Rotate All Text 90°. The title appears vertically along the vertical axis, with 
the letters rotated 90 degrees (so that their bases run along the axis from top to 
bottom).
 
■Rotate All Text 270°. The title appears vertically along the vertical axis, with 
the letters rotated 270 degrees (so that their bases run along the axis from bot-
tom to top).
 
■Stacked. The title appears vertically along the vertical axis, but each letter 
remains unrotated, so that the letters are stacked one on top of the other.
Figure 12.18 shows some examples.

Each type of vertical axis shrinks the chart somewhat when you activate it, but the 
Horizontal option shrinks the chart more than the others because it requires more space to 
the left of the chart.
Working with Legends
The legend is the little box that appears next to the chart (or sometimes above or below 
it). It provides the key that describes what the different colors or patterns mean. For some 
chart types and labels, you may not ﬁ nd the legend to be useful. If it is not useful for the 
chart that you are working on, you can turn it off. To turn off the legend, you can do any 
of the following:
 
■Click the legend box to select it and press the Delete key on the keyboard.
 
■Click Chart Tools Design ➪ Chart Layouts ➪ Add Chart Element ➪ Legend ➪ None.

Chapter 12: Working with Charts

■Click the Chart Elements button to the right of the chart, and in the Chart 
Elements panel, clear the Legend check box.
To turn the legend back on, click the Chart Elements button again and mark the Legend 
check box; this places the legend in the default position for that chart type. If you want to 
choose a different legend location, click Chart Tools Design ➪ Chart Layouts ➪ Add Chart 
Element ➪ Legend and select the position that you want for it, as shown in Figure 12.19.
FIGURE 12.19
You can select a legend position, or turn the legend off altogether, from the Legend 
submenu.
Hiding the legend is not a good idea if you have more than one series in your chart because the legend helps people 
to distinguish which series is which. However, if you have only one series, a legend might not be useful.
To resize a legend box, you can drag one of its selection handles. The text and keys inside 
the box do not change in size, although they may shift in position.

396
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
When you right-click the legend and choose Format Legend, or when you choose More 
Legend Options from the Legend submenu (see Figure 12.19), the Format Legend task pane 
opens with the Legend Options controls displayed, as shown in Figure 12.20. From here, you 
can choose the legend’s position in relation to the chart and whether or not it should over-
lap the chart. If it does not overlap the chart, the plot area will be automatically reduced to 
accommodate the legend.
FIGURE 12.20
You can set legend options in the Format Legend task pane.
The controls in the Legend Options section refer to the legend’s position in relation to the chart, not to the orienta-
tion or alignment of the legend text within the legend box.

Adding Data Labels
Data labels show the numeric values (or other information) that are represented by each 
bar or other shape on the chart. These labels are useful when the exact numbers are impor-
tant or where the chart is so small that it is not clear from the axes what the data points 
represent.
To turn on data labels for the chart, do one of the following:
 
■Click the Chart Elements icon to the right of the chart, and in the panel that 
appears, mark the Data Labels check box. This method places plain black numeric 
labels on each data point, with a transparent background on the data label box and 
no border.
 
■Click Chart Tools Design ➪ Chart Layouts ➪ Add Chart Element ➪ Data Labels ➪ 
Data Callout. This method places white callout boxes for each data point, showing 
both the numeric value and the category name.
If you want additional options besides those two data label types, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the data series or data point you want to affect. To select a data series, 
click one of the bars (or other shapes) in the desired data series. To select a single 
data point, click again on the same bar (or shape). 
In a multiseries chart, only one series’ data labels change at once when you make data label changes with the 
Format Data Label task pane. Make the changes you want to make to the fi rst series, and then select the next data 
series in the chart (for example, the next color of bars on a column chart) and repeat the process. 
 
2. Choose Chart Tools Design ➪ Chart Layouts ➪ Add Chart Element ➪ Data 
Labels ➪ More Data Label Options to open the Format Data Labels task pane. 
Make sure the Label Options heading is selected, and make sure the Label Options 
icon is selected. If needed, expand the Label Options controls under the icon, as 
shown in Figure 12.21. The options available depend on whether it’s a 2-D or 3-D 
chart and on what type of chart it is. Figure 12.21 shows the options for a 3-D col-
umn chart.
 
3. Mark or clear the check boxes for the types of label content under the Label 
Contains heading. For example, you can show the series and/or category name, the 
value, and the legend key (the colored square that represents the series name). 
 
4. If you are working with a 2-D chart, choose a label position from the Label 
Options controls in the task pane. A label can be on the center of the bar (or 
other shape), inside it, or outside it. This option does not appear when you’re work-
ing with a 3-D chart.

398

FIGURE 12.21
Control data label options from the Format Data Labels task pane.
 
5. To change the shape of the data label text box, right-click any of the data 
labels in the series and choose Change Data Label Shapes, and then click the 
desired shape. See Figure 12.22.
 
6. To change the fill of the data label text box, in the Format Data Labels task 
pane, click Label Options, and then click the Fill & Line icon and expand the 
Fill category to display the fill options. To make the data label text boxes trans-
parent, choose No Fill, or to apply some other ﬁ ll color, select it as you would for 
any text box or drawn shape. See Figure 12.23.
Adding a Data Table
Sometimes the chart tells the full story that you want to tell, but other times the audience 
may beneﬁ t from seeing the actual numbers on which you have built the chart. In these 
cases, it is a good idea to include the data table with the chart. A data table contains the 
same information that appears on the datasheet.
To display the data table with a chart, click Chart Tools Design ➪ Chart Layouts ➪ Add 
Chart Element ➪ Data Table and choose to include a data table either with or without a leg-
end key. See Figure 12.24.

To format the data table, choose More Data Table Options from the Data Table submenu in 
Figure 12.24. In the Format Data Table task pane that appears, you can set data table border 
options, as shown in Figure 12.25. For example, you can display or hide the horizontal, ver-
tical, and outline borders for the table from here.
Controlling the Axes
No, axes are not the tools that chop down trees. Axes is the plural of axis, and an axis is the 
side of the chart containing the measurements against which your data is plotted.
You can change the various axes in a chart in several ways. For example, you can make an 
axis run in a different direction (such as from top to bottom instead of bottom to top for a 
vertical axis), and you can turn the text on or off for the axis and change the axis scale.
Displaying or Hiding an Axis
Most of the time you will want to display all axes for a chart. However, in some special 
cases it may be appropriate to turn off an axis. To do so, click Chart Tools Design ➪ Chart 
Layouts ➪ Add Chart Element ➪ Axes and then click Primary Horizontal or Primary Vertical 
to toggle either of those off (or back on again). See Figure 12.26.

402
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
To control how an axis appears (other than just whether or not it appears at all), choose 
More Axis Options from the submenu. The options for axes are covered in the following 
sections.
Setting Axis Scale Options
The scale determines which numbers will form the start point and endpoint of the axis line. 
PowerPoint 2013 calls the scale the bounds of the axis because the minimum and maximum 
values on the scale deﬁ ne lower and upper boundaries for the axis. 
Changing the axis scale can make a big difference in how an audience perceives the same 
data. For example, take a look at the chart in Figure 12.27. The bars are so close to one 
another in value that it is difﬁ cult to see the difference between them. Compare this chart 
to one showing the same data in Figure 12.28, but with an adjusted scale. Because the scale 
is smaller, the differences now appear more dramatic.
FIGURE 12.27
This chart does not show the differences between the values very well.
PowerPoint’s charting feature has an automatic setting for the scale that is turned on by default. However, you may 
sometimes want to override this setting for a different effect, such as to minimize or enhance the difference between 
data series. This is a good example of “making the data say what you want.” For example, if you wanted to make the 
point that the differences between three months were insignifi cant, then you would use a larger scale. If you wanted 
to highlight the importance of the differences, then you would use a smaller scale.

403
Chapter 12: Working with Charts
12
FIGURE 12.28
A change to the values of the axis scale makes it easier to see the differences between val-
ues.
To set the scale (bounds) for an axis, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the axis on the chart that contains the values you are plotting, and 
click Format Axis. (This is typically the vertical axis on a column chart.)
The Format Axis task pane appears, displaying the Axis Options, as shown in 
Figure 12.29. 
 
2. If you do not want the automatic value for one of the measurements, enter a 
different number in its text box under Bounds. To change your mind and go back 
to automatic settings for these, click Auto next to the text box.
 
■Minimum is the starting number. The usual setting is 0, as shown in 
Figure 12.27, although in Figure 12.28, it is set to 2.8.
 
■Maximum is the top number. This number is 4 in both Figure 12.27 and 
Figure 12.28.
 
3. If you want the units on the axis to display differently, change the values in 
their boxes under Units. To change your mind and go back to automatic settings 
for these, click Auto next to the box.
 
■Major determines the axis text. It is also the unit by which gridlines stretch out 
across the back wall of the chart. In Figure 12.27, gridlines appear at increments 
of 0.5 million units; in Figure 12.28, they appear by 0.2 million units. 
 
■Minor is the interval of smaller gridlines between the major ones. Most charts 
look better without minor units because they can make a chart look cluttered. 

404
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
In most cases, you should leave this setting at Auto. You can also use this fea-
ture to place tick marks on the axes between the labels of the major units.
FIGURE 12.29
You can set axis options in the Format Axis task pane, including the axis scale 
(bounds).
Set the minimum and
maximum values for

Click Auto to return
any setting to being
automatically calculated.
Specify the units
by which the axis
will increment.
 
4. (Optional) If you want to change where the axes cross, select Axis Value in 
the Horizontal Axis Crosses section, and then enter a numeric value in its box. 
Changing this value recalculates the numbers in the Bounds and Units sections that 
are set to Auto. 
 
5. (Optional) If you want to activate any of these special features, select their 
check boxes.
 
■Logarithmic Scale. Rarely used by ordinary folks, this check box recalculates 
the Minimum, Maximum, Major, and Minor values according to a power of 10 for 
the value axis, based on the range of data. (If this explanation doesn’t make 
any sense to you, then you’re not the target audience for this feature.)
 
■Values in Reverse Order. This check box turns the scale backward so that the 
greater values appear at the bottom or left.

405
Chapter 12: Working with Charts
12
 
6. (Optional) Choose a display unit from the Display Units drop-down list. This 
option can help simplify large numbers. For example, if you set display units to 
Thousands, then the number 1000 appears as 1 on the chart. If you then select 
the Show Display Units Label on Chart check box, an axis label will appear as 
Thousands.
 
7. (Optional) Expand the Tick Marks section below the axis options, and set tick-
mark types for major and minor marks (see Figure 12.30). These marks appear 
as little lines on the axis to indicate the units. You can use tick marks either with 
or without gridlines. 
FIGURE 12.30
You can choose what tick marks to use, if any.
 
8. Close the task pane when finished.
Setting a Number Format
You can apply a number format to axes and data labels that show numeric data. This is 
similar to the number format that is used for Excel cells; you can choose a category, such 
as Currency or Percentage, and then ﬁ ne-tune this format by choosing a number of decimal 
places, a method of handling negative numbers, and so on.
To set a number format, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the axis containing the numbers you want to format, and choose 
Format Axis.
 
2. In the Format Axis task pane that appears, click the Axis Options text at the 
top, and then click the Axis Options icon.
 
3. Expand the Number section if it is not already expanded. (Collapse any previ-
ously open sections for easier reading.) 
 
4. Choose a number format. You can select the number format in either of two ways: 
 
■Select the Linked to Source check box if you want the number format to be 
taken from the number format that is applied to the datasheet in Excel. If you 
use this method, you don’t have to complete the rest of the steps here.
 
■Click the desired number format in the Category list. Options appear that are 
speciﬁ c to the format that you selected. For example, Figure 12.31 shows the 
options for the Number type of format, which is a generic format. 

406

FIGURE 12.31
Select a number format in the Format Axis task pane.
 
5. (Optional) Fine-tune the numbering format by changing the code in the 
Format Code text box. The number signs (#) represent optional digits, while the 
zeroes represent required digits.
 
6. Close the task pane.
To see some examples of custom number formats that you might use in the Format Code text box, choose Custom as 
the number format category.
Formatting a Chart
In the following sections, you learn about chart formatting. There is so much that you can 
do to a chart that this subject could easily take up its own chapter! For example, just as 
with any other object, you can resize a chart. You can also change the fonts; change the 

407
Chapter 12: Working with Charts
12
colors and shading of bars, lines, or pie slices; use different background colors; change the 
3-D angle; and much more.
To clear the formatting that is applied to a chart element, select it and then click Chart Tools Format ➪ Current 
Selection ➪ Reset to Match Style. This strips off the manually applied formatting from that element, returning it to 
whatever appearance is specifi ed by the chart style that you have applied. (See “Applying Chart Styles” later in this 
chapter for details about styles.)
There are several ways of formatting a chart’s elements. For text elements, you can use the 
Font group’s tools on the Home tab. The text elements on a chart use the exact same text 
formatting controls as any other text on a slide. You can change the font, the size, the 
text attributes (like bold and italic), and so on. PowerPoint treats the individual text boxes 
within the chart as it would treat any other text boxes.
For simple formatting of a graphical element, like changing its outline or ﬁ ll color, your 
best bet is the Chart Tools Format tab’s controls. You can select any chart element and then 
choose its border and ﬁ ll color from here. For example, in Figure 12.32, Vertical (Value) Axis 
Major Gridlines is selected, which you can see in the selection box at the far left end of the 
Ribbon. You could use the Shape Outline drop-down list at this point to choose a different 
color or thickness for the gridlines.
FIGURE 12.32
Format a chart element’s outline and fi ll quickly and easily from the Chart Tools Format tab.
Selection box

408
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
For more extensive or uncommon formatting, use the task pane instead. You can open the 
task pane for the selected chart element by right-clicking it and choosing Format Element 
Name from the submenu, or by choosing Chart Tools Format ➪ Current Selection ➪ Format 
Selection.
Sometimes it can be diffi cult to position the mouse accurately to right-click on a particular chart element. If you have 
trouble selecting the chart element you want to work with, open the drop-down list in the Current Selection group of 
the Chart Tools Format tab and choose the desired chart element. Then to open its task pane, click Format Selection, 
also in the Current Selection group.
The sections in the task pane vary, depending on the type of chart element you are 
formatting. There are generally two main sections, indicated by words at the top of the 
task pane. For example, in the Format Chart Title task pane, the two main sections are 
Title Options and Text Options. Beneath these main section headings are a series of icons. 
The icons are different depending on the main section that’s active. For example, in Figure 
12.33, with Title Options selected, the three icons that appear are Fill & Line, Effects, and 
Size & Properties. In Figure 12.34, with Text Options selected, the icons that appear are 
Text Fill & Outline, Text Effects, and Textbox. This is an example of just one task pane; 
each chart element type has its own unique combination of options in its task pane.

Chapter 12: Working with Charts
12
For most chart elements, the following sections are available from the Fill & Line icon:
 
■Fill. You can choose No Fill, Solid Fill, Gradient Fill, Picture or Texture Fill, Pattern 
Fill, or Automatic. When you select Automatic, the color changes to contrast with 
the background color speciﬁ ed by the theme.
 
■Border. You can choose No Line, Solid Line, Gradient Line, or Automatic. When you 
select Automatic, the color changes to contrast with the background color speciﬁ ed 
by the theme. You can also set a width, a compound type (that is, a line made up of 
multiple lines), and a dash type.
Most chart elements include these choices with the Effects icon:
 
■Shadow. You can apply a preset shadow in any color you want, or you can ﬁ ne-tune 
the shadow in terms of transparency, size, angle, and so on. You might need to 
apply a ﬁ ll to the box in order for the shadow to appear. This shadow is for the text 
box, not for the text within it; use the Font group on the Home tab to apply the 
text shadow, or use the shadows available for WordArt.
 
■Glow. These options add a colored halo effect around the element. You can choose a 
preset or select a color, size, and amount of transparency yourself.
 
■Soft Edges. These options blur the edges of the element. You can choose a preset or 
specify a precise size of the soft edge.
 
■3-D Format. You can deﬁ ne 3-D settings for the text box, such as Bevel, Depth, 
Contour, and Surface.
Depending on the chart element selected, the third icon may be Size & Properties, as in 
Figure 12.33, or something else. For example, for legends, it is Legend Options. Some ele-
ments may even have a fourth icon. For example, for data labels, there is both a Size & 
Position icon and a Label Options icon. If the selected element has a Size & Position icon, 
you can use its controls to set vertical and horizontal alignment, angle, and text direction 
as well as control AutoFit settings for some types of text.
Alignment is usually not relevant in a short label or title text box. The text box is usually exactly the right size to hold 
the text, and so there is no other way for the text to be aligned. Therefore, no matter what alignment you choose, the 
text looks very much the same.
From the Home tab or the mini toolbar, you can also choose all of the text effects that you 
learned about earlier in this book, such as font, size, font style, underline, color, align-
ment, and so on.
Applying Chart Styles
Chart styles are presets that you can apply to charts in order to add colors, backgrounds, 
and ﬁ ll styles. The Chart Styles gallery, shown in Figure 12.35, is located on the Chart Tools 

410
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Design tab, which appears when you select a chart. Point to a sample in the gallery to see 
its style previewed on the chart.
FIGURE 12.35
You can apply a chart style using the Chart Styles gallery.
Click here to choose
color variants.
Chart Styles
Click here to open the full gallery.
If you used PowerPoint 2010, it might seem at ﬁ rst glance that there are fewer chart styles 
in PowerPoint 2013. However, this is an illusion because in PowerPoint 2010, the different 
color variations were included in the Chart Style gallery as separate entities. By separating 
the color choices from the style choices, PowerPoint 2013 actually provides more choices 
and more ﬂ exibility.
Each of the chart styles uses whatever colors are assigned to the placeholders in your cur-
rent color theme for the presentation. You can change the colors for the chart only, with-
out having to change the colors for the whole presentation, by clicking the Change Colors 
button to the left of the Chart Styles gallery. However, the colors on the Change Colors 
button’s menu are indirectly related to the color theme in use for the whole presentation; 
they are various tints and shades of the theme colors, in various combinations. To change 
colors completely, you must change the whole presentation’s colors, as you learned to do in 
Chapter 4, “Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters.”
You cannot add to the presets in the Chart Styles gallery, but you can save a group of settings as a template. To do 
this, right-click the chart’s outer frame and choose Save as Template.
New in PowerPoint 2013, you can also apply chart styles via the Chart Styles icon that 
appears to the right of the chart when it is selected on the slide. Click the Chart Styles 
icon, as shown in Figure 12.36, and then click the desired style. You can click Color at the 
top of the panel to select colors from there also, as you would from the Change Colors but-
ton on the Chart Tools Design tab.

Formatting the Chart Area and Plot Area
The chart area is the entire chart, everything within the big frame that contains the plot-
ted data and all the associated elements: the legend, the data series, the data table, the 
titles, and so on. Right-click anywhere within the chart area (not on any speciﬁ c element) 
and choose Format Chart Area to open the Format Chart Area task pane. 
The Format Chart Area task pane has many of the same sections the task pane for text 
boxes has. Under Chart Options you’ll ﬁ nd Fill & Line, Effects, and Size & Properties. Under 
Text Options are Text Fill & Outline, Text Effects, and Textbox. Any settings you apply to 
the chart area will apply to all the text and objects within the chart area unless a speciﬁ c 
chart element is formatted differently to override that.
The plot area is the part of the chart where the data is plotted. It includes the data series 
and axes as well as any data labels, but it excludes the axis titles, the chart title, and the 
legend. You can choose to format the plot area differently from the chart area if you like, 

412
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
although it’s not common to do so. For example, you could apply a different background ﬁ ll 
color to the plot area, as in Figure 12.37. By default the plot area’s background is transpar-
ent, so the background of the chart area shows through. If, in turn, the chart area is also 
transparent, then the background of the slide behind them both shows through.
FIGURE 12.37
The plot area has a different fi ll color than the chart area in this example.

Chart area includes all elements.
Formatting the Legend
When you use a multiseries chart, the value of the legend is obvious — it tells you which 
colors represent which series. Without the legend, your audience will not know what the 
various bars or lines mean. You can do all of the same formatting for a legend that you 
can for other chart elements. Just right-click the legend, choose Format Legend from the 
shortcut menu, and then use the Format Legend task pane to make your modiﬁ cations. 
For example, you could apply a background ﬁ ll to the legend box, place a border around it, 
and so on. You could also change the font and size used for the legend text from the Fonts 
group on the Home tab.

413
Chapter 12: Working with Charts
12
If you select one of the individual keys in the legend and change its color, the color on the data series in the chart 
changes to match. This is especially useful with stacked charts, where it is sometimes diffi cult to select the data 
series that you want.
Formatting Gridlines and Walls
Gridlines help the reader’s eyes move across the chart. Gridlines are related to the axes, 
which you learned about earlier in this chapter. Although both vertical and horizontal grid-
lines are available, most people use only horizontal ones. To turn gridlines on or off, click 
Chart Tools Design ➪ Chart Layouts ➪ Add Chart Element ➪ Gridlines. See Figure 12.38. 
FIGURE 12.38
Turn gridlines on and off from the Add Chart Element button’s menu.
In most cases, the default gridlines that PowerPoint adds work well. However, you may 
want to make the lines thicker or a different color. Apply those changes by selecting the 
gridlines and then using the Chart Tools Format tab’s commands. You can select one of the 
Shape Styles from there, or use the Shape Outline and/or Shape Effects drop-down lists to 
apply formatting. 

414
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Gridline spacing is based on the major and minor units that you have set in the Format Axis dialog box (vertical or 
horizontal). To set this spacing, see “Setting Axis Scale Options” earlier in this chapter.
Walls are nothing more than the space between the gridlines, formatted in a different color 
than the plot area. You can set the walls’ ﬁ ll to None to hide them. To set the wall color, 
right-click the wall and choose Format Wall, and then choose a ﬁ ll color in the Format Wall 
task pane. 
You can format walls only on 3-D charts; 2-D charts do not have them. To change the background behind a 2-D chart, 
you must format the plot area.
Formatting the Data Series
To format a data series, just right-click the bar, slice, or chart element, and choose Format 
Data Series from the shortcut menu. Then, depending on your chart type, different series 
options appear that you can use to modify the series appearance. Here are the icons avail-
able for bar and column charts, for example:
 
■Fill & Line. These options enable you to choose a ﬁ ll and a border for the series, 
with choices for ﬁ ll including solid, gradient, or picture/texture. Under Border 
you can choose a border color, style, and thickness. This is just like ﬁ lling drawn 
shapes, as you learned in Chapter 9.
 
■Effects. These options include the same standard options available for any drawn 
object, including Shadow, Glow, Soft Edges, and 3-D Format. 
 
■Series Options. This section contains options that are speciﬁ c to the selected 
chart type. For example, when you’re working with a 3-D bar or column chart, the 
series options include Gap Depth and Gap Width, which determine the thickness 
and depth of the bars. For a pie chart, you can set the rotation angle for the ﬁ rst 
slice as well as whether a slice is “exploded” or not. For charts involving bars and 
columns, you can choose a shape option such as Box, Full Pyramid, Partial Pyramid, 
Cylinder, Full Cone, or Partial Cone. The partial options truncate the top part of the 
shape when it is less than the largest value in the chart.
Other chart types have very different series options available. For example, a line chart has 
Marker Options, Marker Fill, Line Color, Line Style, Marker Line Color, and Marker Line Style.
Rotating a 3-D Chart
3-D charts can be rotated in one or more directions: X (side to side), Y (top to bottom), and 
Perspective (the angle from which you view it). There is also a Z rotation (pivoting around a 
center point), but it is inactive for most chart types. 

415
Chapter 12: Working with Charts
12
The Right Angle Axes check box (in the Format Plot Area task pane) is very important when 
setting chart rotation for most chart types. If the Right Angle Axes option is enabled, the 
chart axes do not rotate — only the data bars (or other shapes) rotate. If Right Angle Axes 
is disabled, the entire content of the plot area rotates together as a whole, including the 
axes. Figure 12.39 shows a rotated chart where Right Angle Axes is turned off, and Figure 
12.40 shows a rotated chart where it is turned on.
FIGURE 12.39

1. Select the chart’s plot area. You can do this by clicking it, or by displaying the 
Chart Tools Format tab and selecting Plot Area from the dr op-down list in the 
Current Selection group.
 
2. Display the Format Plot Area task pane. You can do this by right-clicking the plot 
area and choosing Format Plot Area, or by clicking Chart Tools Format ➪ Current 
Selection ➪ Format Selection. 
 
3. In the Format Plot Area task pane, click the Effects icon, and then expand the 
3-D Rotation controls.
 
4. Mark or clear the Right Angle Axes check box as desired, depending on how 
you want the chart to appear. If the feature is off, the whole plot area rotates, 
including the axes; if the feature is on, only the data series rotate. 
 
5. Click the increment buttons to increase or decrease the X Rotation, Y Rotation, 
and/or Perspective settings as desired. You may need to experiment with these 
to ﬁ nd the settings that show your chart the way you want it. See Figure 12.41.

6. Close the task pane when you are finished working with the chart’s rotation.
Working with Chart Templates
After you have formatted a chart the way you want it, you can save it as a template. You 
can then apply these same formatting options to other charts at a later time.
Creating a Chart Template
To create a chart template, follow these steps:
 
1. Select a chart that is formatted exactly the way you want the template to be. If 
you want the template to use theme colors, use them in the chart; if you want the 
template to use ﬁ xed colors, apply them instead.
 
2. Right-click the chart and click Save as Template. The Save Chart Template dialog 
box opens.
 
3. Type a name for the template.
 
4. Click Save.
By default, chart templates are stored in C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\
Template\Charts, with a .crtx (Chart Template) fi lename extension. You can copy templates from another PC 
and store them in that location and they will show up on your list of chart templates on the current PC.
Applying a Chart Template
To apply a chart template to an existing chart, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the chart, and on the Chart Tools Design tab, click Change Chart Type. 
You can also right-click the chart and choose Change Chart Type.
 
2. At the top of the list of categories, click Templates. PowerPoint displays all of 
the custom templates that you have created.
 
3. Click the template that you want to use.
 
4. Click OK.
To apply a chart template to a new chart as you are creating it, after choosing 
Insert ➪ Chart, choose Templates as the chart type, and select the desired template.
Managing Template Files
Chart template ﬁ les remain on your hard disk until you delete them. If you want to get 
rid of a chart template, or rename it, you can do so by opening the folder location that 

418
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
contains the templates. Although you can manually browse to the location (C:\Users\
username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Template\Charts), this is an easier way:
 
1. On the Insert tab, click Chart.
 
2. In the Insert Chart dialog box, click Templates, and then click Manage 
Templates. The folder location opens in a File Explorer window. From here, you can 
rename or delete ﬁ les.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to create and format charts using PowerPoint. You learned 
how to create charts, change their type and their data range, and use optional text ele-
ments on them such as titles, data labels, and so on. You also learned how to format charts 
and how to save formatting in chart templates. In the next chapter, you learn how to 
incorporate data from other sources, including programs that do not necessarily have any-
thing to do with PowerPoint or Ofﬁ ce.

Copying content from other programs

Working with linked and embedded objects
Exporting PowerPoint objects to other programs
A
s you have already seen, PowerPoint contains an assortment of tools for creating various 
types of objects: charts, WordArt, SmartArt diagrams, clip art, and so on. You have also 
learned how to place graphics into PowerPoint from a saved ﬁ le, how to embed Excel charts 
on slides, and how to borrow slides from other PowerPoint presentations and outlines from Word or 
other text editors.
However, PowerPoint doesn’t have a special command for bringing in a lot of other objects that 
don’t fall exactly into any of these categories. Examples include a ﬂ ow chart from a program like 
Microsoft Visio, a slide from a different presentation application, some records from a database, and 
a map from a mapping program.
This chapter looks at the various ways to import and create content from other applications in 
PowerPoint as well as how to export PowerPoint objects for use in other programs.
Working with External Content: An Overview
There are several ways to bring content from other programs into your presentation. The method 
you choose depends on how you want the content to behave once it arrives. You can make the 
inserted content a full citizen of the presentation — that is, with no ties to its native application 
or data ﬁ le — or you can help it retain a connection to its original application (called embedding) or 
to its original data ﬁ le (called linking).

420
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
The simplest way to import content into PowerPoint is to use the Copy and Paste com-
mands. For text-type data from most applications, this results in the incoming data 
integrating itself with PowerPoint without retaining any connection to the source. For 
example, you can select some cells from an Excel worksheet and then click Copy on the 
Home tab to copy them to the Clipboard. Then in PowerPoint, you can paste them by click-
ing Paste and the Excel cells become a PowerPoint table. You can also do the same thing by 
dragging and dropping from one application to the other. 
Not all data types exhibit the behavior described here. With some source data types, especially types that are more 
graphical than text based, copying and pasting results in an embedded object that will open its native application for 
editing. For example, when you copy and paste a chart from Excel, it is by default linked.
Another choice is to embed the data. You can do this for existing or new data. Embedding 
it maintains the relationship between the data and its native application, so that you can 
double-click it to edit it with that native application later. To embed existing data, you 
copy the data to the Clipboard, use the Paste button’s menu to select Paste Special, and 
then choose the appropriate data type from the list. For example, suppose you want to be 
able to edit the pasted cells in Excel later. You can use Paste Special and choose Microsoft 
Excel Worksheet Object as the type. (More on this shortly.)
To embed new data, you use the Object button on the Insert tab and then choose to create a 
new embedded object of the desired type. (More on this shortly, too.) For example, suppose 
you have a favorite program for creating organization charts. You can start a new embed-
ded organization chart on a PowerPoint slide instead of using PowerPoint’s own SmartArt 
hierarchy chart. That organization chart is then stored only within your PowerPoint ﬁ le, 
not separately.
Yet another choice is to link the data from its original source ﬁ le. When you do this, 
PowerPoint maintains information about the name and location of the original, and each 
time you open the presentation ﬁ le it rechecks the original data ﬁ le to see if any changes 
have been made to it. If so, PowerPoint updates its copy of the object to the latest version. 
For example, suppose you want to include data from an Excel workbook that a coworker is 
creating. Your coworker warns you that the data is not ﬁ nal yet, but you want to create 
the presentation anyway. By creating a link to the data, rather than pasting a static copy 
of it, you ensure that you will always have the latest data no matter how many times your 
coworker changes it.
You can create a link to an entire ﬁ le or to a speciﬁ c part of a ﬁ le. For example, you can 
link to the entire Excel workbook or just to a certain range of cells on a certain sheet. The 
procedures are different — for the entire ﬁ le you use Object (Insert tab), but for a portion 
of the ﬁ le you use Paste Special (Home tab). Both methods create a link to the entire Excel 
workbook, but Object automatically displays the entire ﬁ rst sheet of the workbook in your 
PowerPoint ﬁ le, whereas Paste Special displays only the cells that you’ve selected.

421
Chapter 13: Incorporating Content from Other Programs
13
Copying Content from Other Programs
Let’s assume for the moment that you don’t need any special linking or embedding. You just 
want the content from some other program to be placed on a PowerPoint slide. You have 
two choices: Use the Clipboard, or drag and drop the content from the other program to 
PowerPoint.
Using the Clipboard
The easiest way to place something into PowerPoint is to use the Windows Clipboard. 
Because almost all Windows-based programs employ the Clipboard, you can move data from 
any program to almost any other with a minimum of fuss. Follow these steps:
 
1. Create the data in its native program or open a file that contains it.
 
2. Select the data you want, and click Copy on the Home tab, or if it is not an 
Office program, choose Edit ➪ Copy.
 
3. Switch to PowerPoint, and display the slide on which you want to place the 
content.
 
4. Click Paste on the Home tab. The content appears on the slide. PowerPoint makes 
its best guess as to the correct formatting. For example, if you paste Excel work-
sheet cells, it attempts to convert them to a table because that’s the closest match 
among the native PowerPoint layouts.
 
5. Move or resize the new content as necessary on the slide.
Don’t forget that there are many alternative methods for using the Copy and Paste commands. The shortcut keys are 
among the fastest: Ctrl+C for copy and Ctrl+V for paste.
PowerPoint, like all Ofﬁ ce 2013 applications, has an enhanced version of the Clipboard that 
is available when both the source and destination locations are Microsoft Ofﬁ ce applica-
tions. It enables you to copy more than one item at a time to the Clipboard and then choose 
among them when pasting. When pasting to a non-Ofﬁ ce application, however, only the 
last item copied to the Clipboard is available.
When you copy twice in a row without pasting while in an Ofﬁ ce application, the Clipboard 
task pane appears, with each copied clip separately listed. You can also open this Clipboard 
task pane by clicking the dialog box launcher in the Clipboard group on the Home tab.
If pressing Ctrl+C twice doesn’t open the Clipboard, open the task pane the other way (by clicking the dialog box 
launcher in the Clipboard group on the Home tab), and then click the Options button and click Show Offi ce Clipboard 
When Ctrl+C Is Pressed Twice.

422
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
You can then open the destination and click the clip you want to paste. Or you can click 
the down arrow next to a clip and choose Delete to delete it. See Figure 13.1.
FIGURE 13.1
Using the Offi ce 2013 Clipboard task pane enables you to copy more than one clip to the 
Clipboard.
Click the arrow next to a
clip to display its menu.
You can ﬁ ne-tune the way the Clipboard works in Ofﬁ ce 2013 applications by clicking the 
Options button at the bottom of the Clipboard task pane. This opens a menu from which 
you can specify when and how the Clipboard task pane appears. For example, you can set it 
to show a Clipboard icon in the taskbar. See Figure 13.2.
As mentioned earlier, when you are copying and pasting some types of content, especially 
graphical types, PowerPoint embeds the content by default rather than simply pasting it.
Embedding the content tends to increase the size of the PowerPoint presentation ﬁ le, so 
avoid doing it unless you think you will need that capability. (More on embedding later in 
the chapter.) You can tell whether content has been embedded by double-clicking it. If it’s 
embedded, its native application will open within PowerPoint (or in a separate window). If 

423
Chapter 13: Incorporating Content from Other Programs
13
it’s not embedded, a PowerPoint dialog box will open for the content. To avoid embedding 
content that PowerPoint wants to embed by default, follow these steps:
 
1. Copy the data to the Clipboard in its native application.
 
2. In PowerPoint, on the Home tab, open the Paste button’s menu and click Paste 
Special.
 
3. Choose a different format for the paste, such as Bitmap. Do not choose the for-
mat that ends with the word Object or you will get an embedded copy.
 
4. Click OK.
FIGURE 13.2
Click Options to confi gure the Clipboard’s behavior.
Alternatively, you can use one of the icons at the bottom of the Paste Special menu to 
quickly choose a speciﬁ c type of paste operation. See Figure 13.3. For example, you can 
choose to keep the source formatting, use the destination theme, paste as a picture, or 
paste as plain text.

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Using the Drag-and-Drop Feature
In some cases, you can also use the drag-and-drop feature to move an object from some 
other application (or from a ﬁ le management window) to PowerPoint. Not all Windows pro-
grams support this feature though. If you’re not sure whether a program supports it, try it 
and see. Here’s how to drag and drop something:
 
1. Create the object in its native program or open the file that contains it. The 
object can be a single unit such as an entire graphic, or it can be a small piece of a 
larger document or image such as a few cells selected from a large worksheet.
 
2. Open PowerPoint and display the slide on which you want to place the data.
 
3. Resize both applications’ windows so that both the data and its destination are 
visible on-screen.
 
4. Select the data in its native program.
 
5. If you want to copy, rather than move, hold down the Ctrl key.
 
6. Drag the content to the PowerPoint slide. An outline appears on the PowerPoint 
slide showing where the data will go.
 
7. Release the mouse button. The data is moved or copied.
When you’re dragging and dropping data from Excel, it arrives in PowerPoint in a plain text box, with columns and 
rows separated by spaces. If you want to retain the original tabular format from Excel, use the copy-and-paste fea-
ture, not the drag-and-drop feature.
As with copying and pasting, not all content gets the “plain paste” treatment when you 
drag and drop. Generally speaking, text-based data will drag without embedding, but 
graphical-based data will usually embed. (There are exceptions.) Use the Paste Special 
method described earlier rather than dragging and dropping if you run into this situation.
Inserting Graphics from a File
When you copy and paste or drag and drop to insert content from a graphical-based applica-
tion, as mentioned in the preceding section, PowerPoint embeds by default. This makes the 
ﬁ le size larger than necessary for the PowerPoint presentation, however, so it’s better to 
use the Pictures button (Insert tab) when you insert graphics. This inserts a plain old copy 
of the picture, without embedding, and keeps the PowerPoint ﬁ le size more manageable.
Introducing OLE
The abbreviation OLE stands for Object Linking and Embedding. It enables Windows-based 
applications that support it to share information dynamically. That means that the object 
remembers where it came from and has special abilities based on that memory. Even though 

425
Chapter 13: Incorporating Content from Other Programs
13
the term OLE is a little scary (it ranks right up there with SQL in my book!), the concept is 
very elementary, and anyone can understand and use it.
You already understand the term object in the PowerPoint sense, and the term is similar to 
that in the case of OLE. An object is any bit of data (or a whole ﬁ le) that you want to use 
in another program. You can paste it in with no connection to its source, or you can link or 
embed it.
Two actions are involved in OLE: linking and embedding. Here are quick deﬁ nitions of each:
 
■Linking creates a connection between the original ﬁ le and the copy in your pre-
sentation, so the copy is always updated.
 
■Embedding creates a connection between the object in the presentation and the 
application that originally created it, so you can edit the object in that original 
application at any time from within PowerPoint.
The key difference is that linking connects to the source data ﬁ le whereas embedding con-
nects to the source application.
For a link to be updatable, linked objects must already exist independently of the 
PowerPoint presentation. For example, if you want to link an Excel chart, you must ﬁ rst 
create that chart in Excel and save your work in an Excel ﬁ le. That way, PowerPoint has a 
ﬁ lename to refer to when updating the link.
Links can slow down your presentation’s loading and editing performance. Therefore, you should create links last, 
after you have fi nished adding content and polishing the formatting.
Linking and embedding are not appropriate for every insertion. If you want to use content 
(such as cells from an Excel worksheet or a picture from a graphics program) that will not 
change, it’s best to copy it normally. For the Excel data cells or text from a Word document, 
use regular Copy/Paste; for the graphic image, use Picture (on the Insert tab). Reserve 
linking for objects that will change and will be used in a presentation that must always 
have the most current data. Reserve embedding for objects that you plan to edit later and 
require the native application’s editing tools to do so.
Here are some ideas of when linking or embedding might be useful:
 
■If you have to give the same presentation every month that shows the monthly 
sales statistics, link to the Excel worksheet where you track them during the 
month. Your presentation will always contain the most current data.
 
■If you want to draw a picture in Paint (a program that comes with Windows) or 
some other graphics program, embed the picture in PowerPoint. That way, you don’t 
have to open Paint (or the other program) separately every time you want to work 
on the picture while you’re ﬁ ne-tuning your presentation. You can just double-click 

426
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
the picture in PowerPoint. You can always break the link when you ﬁ nalize the pre-
sentation if you want to cut down on the ﬁ le size.
 
■If you know that a coworker is still ﬁ nalizing a chart or drawing, link to their 
working ﬁ le on the network. Then whenever changes are made to it, your copy will 
also be updated. (Beware, however, that once you take your presentation away from 
the computer that has network access, you can no longer update the link.)
Linking and/or Embedding Part of a File
As I mentioned earlier, you can link or embed either a part of an existing ﬁ le or the whole 
ﬁ le. If you need only a part of an existing ﬁ le, such as a few cells from a worksheet, an 
individual chart, or a few paragraphs of text, you use the following procedure:
 
1. In its native application, create or open the file containing the data you want 
to copy.
 
2. If you have just created the file, save it. The ﬁ le should have a name before you 
go any further if you are linking; this is not necessary for embedding, but it won’t 
hurt anything.
 
3. Select the data you want.
 
4. On the Home tab, click Copy, or press Ctrl+C.
 
5. Switch to PowerPoint and display the slide on which you want to paste 
the data.
 
6. On the Home tab, open the Paste button’s menu and click Paste Special. The 
Paste Special dialog box opens. 
 
7. If you want to embed, leave Paste selected. If you want to link, click Paste Link. 
See Figure 13.4.
FIGURE 13.4
Use the Paste Special dialog box to link or embed a piece of a data fi le from 
another program.

427
Chapter 13: Incorporating Content from Other Programs
13
 
8. Choose the format from the As list. Because you want to link or embed, choose a 
type that ends with the word object.
 
9. If you want the pasted object to appear as an icon instead of as itself, mark the 
Display as Icon check box. This check box might be unavailable if the object type 
you chose in step 8 does not support it.
 
10. Click OK. The object is placed in your presentation.
If you link the object, each time you open your PowerPoint presentation, PowerPoint 
checks the source ﬁ le for an updated version. If you embed the object, you can double-click 
it at any time to open it in its native application for editing.
Perhaps you are wondering about the other data types. If you chose Paste in step 7 (rather 
than Paste Link), you will see other formats on the list besides formats with object in their 
names. All of these are non-linkable, non-embeddable formats. The choices depend on the 
type of data but include some of the following:
 
■Formatted Text (RTF). This data type formats text as it is formatted in the origi-
nal ﬁ le. For example, if the text is formatted as underlined in the original ﬁ le, it is 
pasted as underlined text in PowerPoint.
 
■HTML Format. This option formats the content as it would be formatted on a 
web page.
 
■Unformatted Text. This option ignores the formatting from the native ﬁ le and 
formats the text as the default PowerPoint font you’ve speciﬁ ed.
 
■Picture (Windows Metafile). The object appears as a 16-bit WMF-format graphic.
 
■Picture (Enhanced Metafile). The object appears as a 32-bit EMF-format graphic.
 
■Device Independent Bitmap. The object comes in as a bitmap picture, like a 
Windows Paint image.
Enhanced Metafi le is, as the name implies, an updated and improved fi le format from Windows Metafi le. It is a 32-bit 
format, whereas Windows Metafi le is a 16-bit format. Enhanced metafi le graphics cannot be used in MS-DOS or 
16-bit Windows applications.
Embedding an Entire File
Sometimes you might want to place an entire ﬁ le on a PowerPoint slide — for example, if 
the ﬁ le is small and contains only the object that you want to display, like a picture. To 
create this connection, you use the Object button (on the Insert tab), which is handier 
than the procedure you just learned because you do not have to open the other application. 
Here’s how:
 
1. In PowerPoint, display the slide on which you want to place the file.
 
2. Choose Insert ➪ Text ➪ Object. The Insert Object dialog box opens.

428
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
 
3. Click the Create from File button. The controls change to those shown in 
Figure 13.5.
FIGURE 13.5
Enter the fi lename or browse for it with the Browse button.
 
4. Click Browse, and use the Browse dialog box to locate the file you want. Then 
click OK to accept the ﬁ lename.
 
5. (Optional) If you want to link instead of embed the file, mark the Link 
check box. 
Do not link to a fi le housed on a disk that might not always be available during your presentation. For example, don’t 
link to a removable drive unless you are also storing the presentation fi le on the same drive. And don’t link to a net-
work drive unless you know the network will be available at show time from the computer on which you will present.
 
6. Click OK. The file is inserted on your PowerPoint slide.
You can tell that the ﬁ le is embedded, rather than simply copied, because when you double-
click it, it opens in its native application. In contrast, when you double-click an item that 
is copied without embedding, its Properties box or some other PowerPoint-speciﬁ c dialog 
box opens in PowerPoint. If you choose to link the object, you need to edit it in the native 
application.
Embedding a New File
If you want to embed a foreign object, but you haven’t created that object yet, a really easy 
way to do so is to embed it on the ﬂ y. When you do this, the controls for the program open 
within PowerPoint (or in a separate application window, depending on the application) and 

429
Chapter 13: Incorporating Content from Other Programs
13
you can create your object. Then, your work is saved within PowerPoint rather than as a 
separate ﬁ le. To embed a new ﬁ le, follow these steps:
 
1. Open PowerPoint and display the slide on which you want to put the new 
object.
 
2. Choose Insert ➪ Text ➪ Object. The Insert Object dialog box appears.
 
3. Click Create New. A list of available object types appears. See Figure 13.6.
FIGURE 13.6
Choose the object type you want to create. The object types listed come from the 
OLE-compliant programs installed on your PC.
 
4. Click the object type you want and then click OK. The application opens.
 
5. Depending on the application, additional dialog boxes might appear. For exam-
ple, if you are creating a new graphic object, a box might appear asking you about 
the size and color depth. Respond to any dialog boxes that appear for creating the 
new object.
 
6. Create the object using the program’s controls. The program might be in a sepa-
rate window from PowerPoint, or it might be contained within the PowerPoint win-
dow as in Figure 13.7.
 
7. When you are finished, if the program was opened within PowerPoint, click 
anywhere on the slide outside of that object’s frame. Or, if the application 
was in a separate window, choose File ➪ Exit and Return to Document. If you are 
prompted to save the ﬁ le, choose No.
If you are prompted to save the object in a fi le and you choose Yes, the application creates a copy of the object that 
exists outside of PowerPoint. The copy is not linked to or embedded in PowerPoint.

430
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
If you are asked whether you want to update the object in the PowerPoint docu-
ment before proceeding, you should choose Yes. This prompt occurs in many of the 
applications that open in separate windows.
 
8. Resize and move the object on the slide as necessary.
Because you are creating a ﬁ le that doesn’t have a name or saved location separate from 
the PowerPoint presentation, there is no need to link it to anything. Embedding is the only 
option.
FIGURE 13.7
The embedded program’s controls appear, with PowerPoint in the background.
Working with Linked and Embedded Objects
Now that you have a linked or embedded object, what can you do with it? Many things. You 
can edit an embedded object by double-clicking it, of course. And you can update, change, 
and even break the links associated with a linked object. The following sections provide 
some details.

431
Chapter 13: Incorporating Content from Other Programs
13
Opening and Converting Embedded Objects
When you select an embedded object in PowerPoint and then right-click the object, you 
can choose Data Type Object, where Data Type is the object type. (Its exact name depends 
on the object type, for example, Worksheet Object.) From the submenu you can choose the 
following:
 
■Edit. Opens the object for editing within PowerPoint (if possible). Some applica-
tions can work from within PowerPoint, such as the Excel example in Figure 13.7. If 
the object is related to an application that can’t do this, the object opens for edit-
ing in a separate window for that application.
 
■Open. Opens the object for editing in a separate window for the application with 
which it is associated.
 
■Convert. Opens a dialog box that enables you to convert the object to some other 
type (if possible). This sounds great in theory, but in practice there are usually 
very few alternatives to choose from.
Although Convert options also appear for linked objects, you cannot convert them; you must break the link fi rst. 
That’s because a linked object must have a certain object type to maintain its link. Even after breaking a link, there 
might not be any viable choices for converting it to other formats.
Editing a Linked or Embedded Object
To edit a linked or embedded object, follow these steps:
 
1. Display the slide containing the linked or embedded object.
 
2. Double-click the object. The object’s program controls appear. They might be 
integrated into the PowerPoint window, such as the ones for Excel that you saw in 
Figure 13.7, or they might appear in a separate window.
 
3. Edit the object as needed.
 
4. Return to PowerPoint by doing one of the following: 
 
■If the object is embedded (not linked), click the slide behind the object to 
return to PowerPoint.
 
■If the object is linked, close the application window in which the object appears. 
When you are asked to save your changes, click Yes.
You can also edit a linked object directly in its original application, independently from 
PowerPoint. Close your PowerPoint presentation and open the original application. Do your 
editing, and save your work. Then, reopen your PowerPoint presentation and the object will 
reﬂ ect the changes to the linked objects.

432
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Changing How Links Update
OLE links are automatically updated each time you open your PowerPoint ﬁ le. However, 
updating these links slows down ﬁ le opening considerably, so if you open and close the 
ﬁ le frequently, you might want to set the link updating to Manual. That way, the links are 
updated only when you issue a command to update them. To set a link to update manually, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Open the PowerPoint presentation that contains the linked object(s). The pre-
sentation must have been previously saved.
 
2. Choose File ➪ Info and then click the Edit Links to Files hyperlink in the 
lower-right corner. The Links dialog box appears (see Figure 13.8).
FIGURE 13.8
You can change the update setting for the links in your presentation here.
 
3. Click the link that you want to change.
 
4. Uncheck the Automatic Update check box.
 
5. If you want to change any other links to manually update, repeat steps 3 and 
4. You can also use the Shift and Ctrl keys to select more than one link at once.
 
6. If you want to update a link now, select it and click the Update Now button.
 
7. Click Close to close the Links dialog box. Backstage view still appears. 
 
8. Choose Save to save the presentation changes (including the changes to the 
link settings).
When you set a link to manually update, you have to open the Links dialog box and click 
Update Now, as in step 6, each time you want to update it. Or, you can right-click the object 
and choose Update Link from its shortcut menu.

433
Chapter 13: Incorporating Content from Other Programs
13
Breaking a Link
When you break a link, the object remains in the presentation, but it becomes an ordinary 
object, just like any other picture or object you might have placed there. You can’t double-
click it to edit it anymore, and it doesn’t update when the source changes. To break a link, 
reopen the Links dialog box shown in Figure 13.8 (File ➪ Info ➪ Edit Links to Files), click 
the link to break, and then click Break Link. If a warning box appears, click OK.
When you break a link, embedding information disappears too. For example, if you have a 
linked Excel chart and you break the link, the result is a simple pasted image of the chart 
with no ties to the Excel application. To reestablish a link, simply re-create it using the 
process you used when you created it originally.
Changing the Referenced Location of a Link
If you move ﬁ les around on your hard disk, or move them to other storage locations, you 
might need to change the link location reference. For example, perhaps you are moving the 
presentation ﬁ le to a ﬂ ash drive and you want to place all of the linked ﬁ les needed for 
the presentation in a separate folder on the ﬂ ash drive. To change a link reference, do the 
following:
 
1. Copy or move the files where you want them. For example, if you want to trans-
fer the presentation and linked ﬁ les to a CD, do that ﬁ rst.
 
2. Open the PowerPoint presentation that contains the linked object(s) to change. 
If you copied the presentation to some new location, make sure you open the copy 
that you want to change.
 
3. Choose File ➪ Info ➪ Edit Links to Files. The Links dialog box opens (Figure 13.8).
 
4. Click the link you want to change.
 
5. Click Change Source. A Change Source dialog box opens. It is just like the normal 
Open dialog boxes you have worked with many times.
 
6. Select the file to be linked from its new location, and click Open. The link is 
updated.
 
7. In the Links dialog box, click Close.
If you change the location of a link to a different fi le, depending on the object type, the link may change to refer to 
the entire fi le, as if you had inserted it with Insert ➪ Text ➪ Object. If you used Edit ➪ Paste Special and then select 
Paste Link to insert only a part of the original fi le, that aspect might be lost and the entire fi le might appear as the 
object in the  presentation. In such situations, it is better to delete the object and re-create the link from scratch.

Exporting PowerPoint Objects to Other Programs
You can copy any object in your PowerPoint presentation to another program, either linked 
or unlinked. For example, perhaps you created a chart using the PowerPoint charting tools 
for one of your PowerPoint slides and now you want to use that chart in a Microsoft Word 
document. To use a PowerPoint object in another program, you do the same basic things 
that you’ve learned in this chapter, but you start with PowerPoint. Here are some examples:
 
■To copy an object from PowerPoint, select it in PowerPoint and copy it to the 
Clipboard (Ctrl+C). Then switch to the other program and paste (Ctrl+V).
 
■To embed (or optionally link) an object from a PowerPoint presentation into another 
program’s document, choose it in PowerPoint and copy it (Ctrl+C). Then, switch to 
the other program and use Paste Special. (In programs that use a menu bar rather 
than a Ribbon, the command is usually Edit ➪ Paste Special.)
 
■To embed or link an entire PowerPoint presentation in another program’s document, 
use the Object command in the other program (probably on an Insert tab or menu), 
and choose your PowerPoint ﬁ le as the source.
You can also save individual slides as various types of graphics with the File ➪ Save As 
command, as you learned to do in Chapter 2, “Creating and Saving Presentation Files.” 
Summary
In this chapter, you learned the mysteries of OLE, a term you have probably heard bandied 
about but were never quite sure what it meant. You can now use objects freely between 
PowerPoint and other programs and link or embed them whenever appropriate. 
In the next chapter, you learn how to add sound effects, music, and soundtracks to a 
presentation.

W
hether it’s a simple sound effect or a complete musical soundtrack, sounds in a PowerPoint 
presentation can make a big difference in the audience’s perception of your message. In 
this chapter, you will learn when and how to use sounds, how to place them in the presen-
tation, and how to manage their playback.
How PowerPoint Uses Audio
There are several ways that you can include audio in a presentation:
 
■Insert an audio file as an icon. The audio plays during the presentation whenever anyone 
points to or clicks its icon, or it plays automatically, depending on the settings that you 
specify. This is useful in an interactive presentation because it gives the audience a choice 
of whether to play the sound. 
 
■Associate a sound with an object (such as a graphic) so that the sound plays when anyone 
points to or clicks that object. This is another good technique for interactive presentations.

436
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
 
■Associate a sound with an animation effect (such as a series appearing in a 
graph) so that the sound plays when the animation effect occurs. For example, you 
might have some text “drive in” onto a slide and associate the sound of an engine 
revving with that action.
 
■Associate a sound with a slide transition (a move from one slide to the next) so 
that the sound plays when the next slide appears. For example, you may assign a 
shutter-click sound, such as the sound that a slide projector makes when it changes 
slides, to the transitions between slides.
 
■Insert a musical soundtrack that plays automatically in the background. This is 
useful for unattended (kiosk-style) presentations.
 
■Link to online audio. You can create a link in your presentation to an online audio 
source. When it is triggered for playback in the presentation, PowerPoint accesses 
the clip via the Internet.
 
■Record and embed a new audio clip. You a can use the sound recorder that is built 
into PowerPoint to record your own new sounds with your computer’s microphone 
and embed them in your presentation ﬁ le.
If you download sounds from the Internet or acquire them from other sources, you must be careful not to violate any 
copyright laws. Sounds recorded from television, radio, or compact discs are protected by copyright law, and you or 
your company might face serious legal action if you use them in a presentation without the permission of the copy-
right holder.
When to Use Sounds — and When Not To
Sounds should serve the purpose of the presentation; you should never use them simply 
because you can. If you add a lot of sounds purely for the fun of it, then your audience may 
lose respect for the seriousness of your message. That being said, there are many legitimate 
reasons to use sounds in a presentation. Just make sure that you are clear on what your 
reasons are before you start working with them. Here are some ideas:
 
■For new slides. You can assign a recognizable sound, such as a beep or a bell, to 
each slide so that when your audience hears the sound, they know to look up and 
read the new slide.
 
■For voice-overs. You can record a short voice-over message from a CEO or some 
other important person who could not be there in person.
 
■For emphasis or humor. You can punctuate important points with sounds or use 
sounds to add occasional humorous touches.
However, if you are trying to pack a lot of information into a short presentation, you might 
want to avoid sounds that take up presentation time when they play, such as elaborate 

437
Chapter 14: Adding Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks
14
14
sound effects. You should also avoid sounds and other whimsical touches if you are deliver-
ing very serious news. You may also want to avoid sounds if you intend to present on a very 
old and slow computer because any kind of media clip — whether sound or video — will 
slow the system down even more, both when you load the presentation and when you pres-
ent it.
Now that you know how to make intelligent decisions about using sounds, let’s start using 
them in your presentations.
Inserting an Audio Clip as an Icon on a Slide
The most elementary way to use an audio clip in a presentation is to place the clip directly 
on a slide as an object. An icon appears on the slide, and you can click the icon during 
the presentation to play the clip. This method works well if you want to play the sound at 
exactly the right moment in the presentation.
You can also assign the sound to an existing object on the slide, as explained in the section “Assigning a Sound to an 
Object” later in this chapter. When you do this, the object to which you attach the sound serves the same function as 
an icon; you click the object to play the sound.
Inserting an Audio Clip from a File
You might already have the audio ﬁ le you need on your own PC. If you do, the process of 
inserting it is simple. Follow these steps to insert an audio clip from a ﬁ le on your PC:
 
1. Click Insert ➪ Audio ➪ Audio on My PC. The Insert Audio dialog box opens.
 
2. Navigate to the drive and folder that contain the audio clip that you want. 
If you have any audio clips, look in the Windows\Media folder on the hard disk 
where Windows is installed for some small, simple sound effect ﬁ les you can prac-
tice with. You can also use music clips from your music library.
 
3. Click the file that you want to use, as shown in Figure 14.1, and then click 
Insert. A speaker icon appears on the slide, as shown in Figure 14.2. Playback con-
trols appear beneath it when it’s selected. You can test the clip by clicking the Play 
button (the big right-pointing triangle).
To hide the icon, drag it off the edge of the slide. The sound still works, but the audience cannot see the icon. You can 
also mark the Hide During Show check box on the Audio Tools Playback tab to prevent the icon from appearing.

Notice the arrow next to the Insert button in the Insert Audio dialog box (Figure 14.1). It 
opens a menu from which you can choose to link the ﬁ le instead of embedding it. Normally 
PowerPoint embeds almost all content, but linking may be appropriate in special situations, 
such as when large audio or video ﬁ les are available on your network and you don’t want to 
duplicate them in your PowerPoint ﬁ le in every presentation in which you reference them.
Inserting an Online Audio Clip
You can insert audio clips from the Ofﬁ ce.com clip art collection directly from within 
PowerPoint. Even though the collection is called “clip art,” it contains more than just the 

439
Chapter 14: Adding Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks
14
typical line art that most people think of as clip art. It also contains photos, audio clips, 
and even some video clips.
The process for inserting online audio clips is very similar to that for inserting clip art, 
covered in Chapter 11, “Working With Clip Art and Photos.” The main difference is the type 
of results that appear in the search (sounds rather than images).
Follow these steps to ﬁ nd and insert an audio clip from Ofﬁ ce.com:
 
1. Click Insert ➪ Audio ➪ Online Audio. The Insert Audio dialog box opens. Notice 
that there is only one source available here, whereas in the Insert Pictures dialog 
box (shown in Figure 11.2 in Chapter 11), there were several sources. 
 
2. Type a keyword in the Office.com Clip Art text box and press Enter. Figure 14.3 
shows some example results.
FIGURE 14.3
Results from an Offi ce.com search for online audio.
 
3. Click a clip to hear it. (Make sure the sound in Windows is not muted.)
 
4. Click the desired clip to insert and click the Insert button. The sound’s icon 
appears on the slide, the same as in Figure 14.2. 
Recording Your Own Sounds
Most PCs have a microphone jack on the sound card where you can plug in a small micro-
phone. You can then record your own sounds to include in the presentation. In this case, 

440
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
I am referring to simple, short sounds. If you want to record a full-blown voice-over narra-
tion, see Chapter 19, “Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations.”
To record a sound, follow these steps:
 
1. Display the slide on which you want to place the sound clip.
 
2. Click Insert ➪ Audio ➪ Record Audio. The Record Sound dialog box appears. See 
Figure 14.4.

3. (Optional) Type a name for the sound, replacing the generic name (Recorded 
Sound) in the Name box. 
 
4. Click the Start Recording button (the red circle).
 
5. Record the sound. When you are ﬁ nished, click the Stop Recording button (the 
black square).
 
6. (Optional) To play back the sound, click the Play button (the black triangle).
 
7. Click OK to place the sound on the slide. A sound icon appears on the slide.
Assigning a Sound to an Object
Many presenters prefer to assign sounds to an existing object on a slide rather than insert-
ing an audio clip as its own separate icon. This way, they still have precise control over 
when the clip plays (for example, when they click a clip-art image with which the audio is 
associated), but the control mechanism is hidden.
Although you can assign an audio clip to any object, many people assign audio clips to 
graphics. For example, you might attach an audio ﬁ le of a greeting from your CEO to the 
CEO’s picture. The picture would be set up as the trigger, and clicking it would play the 
audio clip.
The drawback to this method is that only WAV ﬁ les can be used (the actual WAV ﬁ le format, 
with a .wav ﬁ lename extension, not just waveform-type audio ﬁ les), so you must convert 
your existing audio clip to the WAV format using a third-party sound-editing program before 

441
Chapter 14: Adding Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks
14
you add it to your PowerPoint presentation. A workaround for other ﬁ le formats is to put 
them under Run Program so that the clip plays in the external program associated with it.
Follow these steps to assign a sound to an object:
 
1. Insert the object that you want to associate with the sound. For example, the 
object can be a graphic, chart, or text box.
 
2. Select the object, and click Insert ➪ Links ➪ Action. The Action Settings dialog 
box appears.
 
3. Click either the Mouse Click tab or the Mouse Over tab, depending on which 
action you want. Mouse Click plays the sound when you click the object, while 
Mouse Over plays the sound when you move your mouse pointer over the object.
 
4. Mark the Play Sound check box. Then open the drop-down list and click one of 
the sample sounds (from C:\Windows\Media) or click Other Sound to open the 
Add Sound dialog box and pick a sound from any location. You can use only WAV 
sounds for this, though.
FIGURE 14.5
You can choose the sound that you want to assign to the object.
Click here and pick a
sound from the list or
choose Other Sound
to select another
audio clip.
 
5. Click OK. The object now has the sound associated with it so that when you click it 
or move the mouse over it during the presentation, the sound plays.
Chapter 16 is devoted entirely to transitions and animation effects, and so this chapter does not describe them in 
detail. In Chapter 16, you learn how to assign sounds to the transition between slides or to the movement (anima-
tion) of any object on any slide.

442
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Adding a Digital Music Soundtrack
Digital music clips, such as MP3 and WMA ﬁ les, work just like other audio clips. You insert 
them using the Insert ➪ Audio ➪ Audio on My PC command, as described earlier in this 
chapter in “Inserting an Audio Clip from a File.”
In most cases, you will want the music to continue through multiple slides; see “Setting a 
Clip to Continue across Multiple Slides” later in this chapter to learn how to do that. (The 
easiest way is to display the Audio Tools Playback tab and mark the Play Across Slides 
check box.) In addition, you will probably want to hide the icon for the audio track so that 
it doesn’t get in the way. To do this, select the icon on the slide and then choose Audio 
Tools Playback ➪ Audio Options ➪ Hide During Show.
By default, MP3 and WMA music tracks are embedded in the ﬁ le rather than linked. If you 
want to link them, click the arrow next to the Insert button in the dialog box where you 
select the clip and choose to link to the ﬁ le. This works the same as with any other audio 
clip. (Note that embedding was not the default in PowerPoint 2007 and earlier, so if you are 
working with a ﬁ le created in an earlier version that already has a music soundtrack, the 
ﬁ le may be linked; the easiest way to change that is to remove it and reinsert it.)
Adding a CD Audio Soundtrack
If you want to use music from a CD as the background music for your presentation, you 
might want to rip the track(s) you want to your hard disk ﬁ rst. To rip means to make a copy 
of the track in a digital audio format such as MP3 or WMA and save it on your computer. 
You can then play the track without having to have the CD in the computer. Nearly any 
music player software will rip tracks for you; Audacity is one such program that works well, 
for example. (Avoid using Windows Media Player because it adds digital rights management 
restrictions.) After ripping the tracks, insert them into the presentation as you would any 
other audio ﬁ le. See the previous section for an outline of the process.
In some instances you may prefer to use audio tracks directly from the CD. This method 
keeps the size of the presentation ﬁ le small because the music clip is not embedded in it, 
but it requires you to have the CD in the PC as you show the presentation. You cannot use 
CD audio tracks in presentations that you plan to distribute as self-running presentations 
on a data CD or over the Internet because the computers on which it will run will not have 
access to the CD.
Adding the Insert CD Audio Command to the Quick Access Toolbar
Microsoft recommends that you use digital audio tracks such as MP3 and WMA ﬁ les for the 
music in your presentation, so it has de-emphasized the command for inserting CD audio 
in PowerPoint 2013. The command does not appear on the Ribbon by default. Therefore, if 
you want to use this feature, you must add the command to the Quick Access Toolbar or to 

443
Chapter 14: Adding Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks
14
the Ribbon. I’ll review the procedure for adding it to the Quick Access Toolbar here because 
it is simpler; if you want to add it elsewhere on the Ribbon, see Chapter 22, “Customizing 
PowerPoint.”
To add the Play CD Audio Track command to the Quick Access Toolbar, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Options. The PowerPoint Options dialog box opens.
 
2. Click Quick Access Toolbar.
 
3. Open the Choose Commands From drop-down list (above the left column) and 
select Commands Not in the Ribbon.
 
4. Scroll through the list of commands. Select Play CD Audio Track, and then click 
the Add >> button to move it to the list on the right. See Figure 14.6.
FIGURE 14.6

command here.
Click Add to add
the clip to the Quick
Access Toolbar.

444
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
 
5. Click OK. The command now appears on the Quick Access Toolbar (the row of but-
tons above the File and Home tabs).
Placing a CD Soundtrack Icon on a Slide
To play a CD track for a slide, you must place an icon for it on the slide. You can place a 
range of tracks, such as multiple tracks from a CD, using a single icon. To do so, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Insert the CD in your PC.
 
2. Click the Play CD Audio Track icon on the Quick Access Toolbar. (You learned 
how to place it there in the previous section.) The Insert CD Audio dialog box 
appears.
 
3. Specify the starting track number in the Start at Track text box in the Clip 
selection section.
 
4. Specify the ending track number in the End at Track text box. If you want to 
play only a single track, the Start at Track and End at Track numbers should be 
the same. The start or end time changes only after you click one of the up or down 
arrows next to the time. For example, if you want to play tracks 1, 2, and 3, you 
should select track 1 as the start track and track 3 as the end track (as opposed to 
track 4).
 
5. If you want to begin the starting track at a particular spot (other than the 
beginning), enter this start time in the Time text box for that track. For exam-
ple, to start the track 50 seconds into the song, you would type 00:50.
 
6. If you want to stop the ending track at a particular spot, enter this end time in 
the Time text box for that track. By default, PowerPoint plays an entire track. You 
can see the total playing time at the bottom of the dialog box. 
 
7. (Optional) If desired, adjust the volume with the Sound Volume button. Click 
the button and then drag its slider.
 
8. Click OK. The CD icon appears in the center of the slide. You can drag it off the 
edge of the slide if it interferes with your slide content. You can also resize it if you 
want, just as you can any other object.
 
9. Click the CD Audio Tools Options tab.
 
10. Open the Play Track list and choose Play Across Slides.
You can play any number of tracks from a single CD using a single icon as long as they are contiguous and you play 
them in their default order. If you need noncontiguous tracks from the CD, or you want to play them in a different 
order, or you just want certain segments of some of the clips, then you must place each clip individually on the slide 
and then control their order in the Animation pane. See Chapter 16, “Creating Animation Effects and Transitions,” for 
details. If you do not want the icons to appear on the slide, then drag them off the slide’s edge.

445
Chapter 14: Adding Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks
14
The CD track is now an animated object on your slide. By animated, I mean that it is an 
object that has some action associated with it.
Controlling When a CD Track Plays
You can set many of the same properties for a CD track on a slide that you can for a digital 
audio ﬁ le icon. You can also use the Animation controls to specify precisely when and how 
a track will play. To do this, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Animations ➪ Advanced Animation ➪ Animation Pane to turn on the 
Animation Pane if it is not already displayed.
 
2. Select the CD icon on the slide. A gray box appears around its name in the Custom 
Animation pane.
 
3. Open the drop-down menu for the selected clip and choose Effect Options. This 
opens the Play CD Audio dialog box.
From this point, the options are exactly the same as those for regular sound ﬁ les that you 
will learn about in the next section, “Conﬁ guring Sound Playback.” All of the same tabs are 
available, including Effect, Timing, and Sound Settings.
Confi guring Sound Playback
Now let’s look at some ways to control when the sound plays. You can adjust some basic 
settings on the Audio Tools Playback tab or ﬁ ne-tune playback settings with the Animation 
pane. 
Adjusting Basic Playback Settings
Using the Audio Tools Playback tab, you can conﬁ gure a variety of basic options that deﬁ ne 
how the sound clip will play. For example, you can set whether it plays automatically or 
not, how loudly it will play in relation to the other sounds in the presentation, and whether 
or not it should repeat continuously.
To conﬁ gure the sound’s basic playback properties, do the following:
 
1. Click the audio clip icon to select it. Play controls appear beneath it and selection 
handles appear around the icon.
 
2. On the Audio Tools Playback tab, open the Start drop-down list and choose an 
option: On Click or Automatically. See Figure 14.7. 
 
3. (Optional) Mark one or more of the check boxes in the Audio Options section of 
the Ribbon:

446
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
 
■The Play Across Slides check box enables the sound to continue to play even 
if the presentation advances to the next slide (or more). The default is to play 
across 999 slides; you will learn how to specify a different number of slides in 
the next section. 
 
■The Loop Until Stopped check box makes the sound play continuously until you 
move to another slide on which it does not play. By default the sound plays only 
once.
 
■The Hide During Show check box hides the sound icon in Slide Show view.
 
■The Rewind After Playing check box is available for sounds, but it doesn’t do 
much. Rewinding leaves the clip at its start point, rather than its end point, 
after playback. For a video, this makes a difference because it controls which 
frame of the video remains on-screen after playback; for audio that’s not an 
issue.
FIGURE 14.7
Confi gure basic playback options on the Audio Tools Playback tab.
The most popular reason for adjusting these settings is to make a music clip play in 
the background across multiple slides. To do this, you adjust four settings: set Start to 
Automatically, turn on Play Across Slides, turn on Loop Until Stopped, and turn on Hide 
During Show. As a shortcut, PowerPoint provides a Play in Background button on the Audio 
Tools Playback tab. Click that button to automatically apply all four of those settings at 
once. This Audio Styles feature is new in PowerPoint 2013; there is only the one audio style, 
but it’s a useful one. (Unfortunately, you can’t create your own audio styles.)
Setting a Clip to Play on Mouse Click or Mouse Over
Even if you set up a clip to play automatically, it still will play (or replay) if you click it. 
That’s because, by default, it has an action setting applied to it that plays it on-click. 
Action settings are a form of trigger animation. They set up the clip to be triggered (to 
play) when something happens — for example, when they are clicked or touched with the 
mouse. (Chapter 16 covers trigger animations in more detail.)
The Action Settings dialog box for a clip is accessed via the Insert ➪ Action command. The 
dialog box has two tabs: Mouse Click and Mouse Over. Each tab is identical in its controls. 
With them, you can deﬁ ne what happens when someone clicks the icon and when someone 
rolls the mouse over the icon (without clicking).

447
Chapter 14: Adding Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks
14
 
 You may remember the Action Settings dialog box from “Assigning a Sound to an Object” earlier in the 
chapter. However, at that point we were looking at assigning a sound to an existing object to avoid hav-
ing a separate audio icon, whereas here the audio clip icon itself is the object. 
As you can see in Figure 14.8, the selected sound clip will play when clicked. (Object Action 
is set to Play on the Mouse Click tab.) On the Mouse Over tab, by default, no action is 
selected.
FIGURE 14.8
An audio clip’s icon has Play set as its object action on the Mouse Click tab by default.
To set up a sound clip so that it plays when you roll the mouse over it (without clicking), 
follow these steps:
 
1. Select the clip on the slide.
 
2. Choose Insert ➪ Links ➪ Action. The Action Settings dialog box opens.
 
3. Click the Mouse Over tab.
 
4. Click the Object Action option button.
 
5. Open the Object Action drop-down list and choose Play.
 
6. Click OK.
Fine-Tuning Playback Settings in the Animation Pane
The Start setting for the clip (On Click or Automatically) that you select on the Audio Tools 
Playback tab sets up an animation event for the sound clip. You can view and change this 

448
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
animation event from the Animation pane. You will learn a lot more about the Animation 
pane in Chapter 16, but I’ll give you a quick rundown here on the parts that pertain speciﬁ -
cally to audio clips.
To access an audio clip’s animation settings, choose Animations ➪ Advanced 
Animation ➪ Animation Pane. The Animation pane appears, and any audio or video clips 
you have inserted on the active slide appear on the list there, along with any animations 
you have set up (see Chapter 16). In Figure 14.9, there is only one animation: the one for 
the Tin Man audio clip.
FIGURE 14.9
The inserted clip appears in the Animation pane.
Audio clip

for audio clip
Clips that you insert from Offi ce.com using the Insert ➪ Audio ➪ Online Audio command have names that may 
be diffi cult to remember and distinguish; for example, an audio clip might have a mostly numeric name like 
MS900388197. You can rename a clip by choosing Home ➪ Editing ➪ Select ➪ Selection Pane, and in the 
Selection task pane, clicking the clip, clicking it again (to rename), and typing a new name for it. That new name will 
also be used in the Animation pane to refer to the clip.
Controlling When a Clip Will Play
On the Animations tab’s Start drop-down list (shown in Figure 14.7), you can choose from 
three settings for a clip to play:

449
Chapter 14: Adding Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks
14
 
■On Click. Sets up a trigger animation so that the sound plays when you click its 
icon.
 
■With Previous. Plays the sound simultaneously with the previous anima-
tion (if any) or with the transition if it is the ﬁ rst animation. For this to work, 
Automatically must be set for the start value on the Audio Tools Playback tab.
 
■After Previous. Plays the sound automatically after the previous animation (if 
any). For this to work, Automatically must be set for the start value on the Audio 
Tools Playback tab.
These same options are available by right-clicking the clip’s name on the Animation pane. A 
menu opens; click the desired setting, as shown in Figure 14.10.
FIGURE 14.10
An audio clip can be set to play on click, after the previous animation event, or simultane-
ously with the previous animation event.
If there are no other animated events on the slide, the “previous event” is the slide itself 
appearing, and the effect is identical to Start After Previous. The difference is apparent 
only if you have multiple animation events on the slide; this setting enables you to syn-
chronize multiple events to occur simultaneously. Chapter 16 covers this in more detail.
When specifying a start point on the Audio Tools Playback tab, choosing On Click starts 
the sound ﬁ le when you click the mouse anywhere on the slide, even if you do not click the 
sound icon itself. If you want the sound to play only when the sound icon is clicked (the 
default when you insert a sound), make sure a trigger is set up for it. To check this out, 
right-click the sound’s entry in the Animation pane and choose Timing. Then in the Play 
Audio dialog box, click Triggers if needed to expand the Triggers options, select the Start 
Effect on Click Of option button, and make sure the sound clip’s name is chosen from the 
drop-down list. See Figure 14.11.

FIGURE 14.11
Set the sound to play only when the sound icon is clicked by changing the Timing setting.
In Slide Show view, a set of playback controls appears along with the sound icon, so you can pause and play the clip 
using those controls during the show. This makes it less critical to have pause and play triggers set up for the icon 
itself.
Delaying or Repeating a Sound
Depending on the situation, it may be useful to have a sound play after a short delay or to 
repeat the sound more than once. In Chapter 16, you can learn more about setting anima-
tion options. However, here are some quick instructions for customizing a sound:
 
1. On the Animations tab, click Animation Pane to open the Animation pane if it 
does not already appear.
 
2. On the slide, select the icon for the audio clip. The clip becomes selected in the 
Animation pane.
 
3. Open the menu for the clip in the Animation pane and choose Timing. The Play 
Audio dialog box opens with the Timing tab displayed.
 
4. Enter a number of seconds in the Delay text box. The delay occurs between when 
the previous event happens and when the sound begins.
 
5. Open the Repeat drop-down list and choose the number of times that the 
sound should repeat. You can choose 2, 3, 4, 5, or 10 times as well as Until Next 

451
Chapter 14: Adding Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks
14
Click and Until End of Slide. You can also type in your own number of times to 
repeat (up to 9999). See Figure 14.12.
FIGURE 14.12
You can use the Timing controls to delay the sound and to make it repeat.
 
6. Click OK.
Choosing the Starting and Ending Point for a Sound Clip
There might be times when you want to start the clip from some point other than the 
beginning. For example, you may have a really good sound clip, except that the ﬁ rst ﬁ ve 
seconds are garbled or it may contain content that you do not want to use, or you may want 
to play just the ﬁ rst 15 seconds of the clip.
PowerPoint supports two methods of controlling a clip’s starting point. The older method 
involves using the Effect Options command and works in all presentations. The newer 
method uses the Trim feature, which is available only in PowerPoint 2010 and higher. The 
Trim feature allows you to set both a starting and an ending point for the clip; Effect 
Options can only alter the starting point. I recommend that you use the Trim feature when-
ever possible, falling back to the older method only when working with older existing pre-
sentations that already use that feature.
Setting the Starting Point with Effect Options
The Effect Options method enables you to set a starting point for the clip that is a certain 
number of seconds into it. It also enables you to specify whether the clip should start from 

452
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
the beginning if you temporarily stop it and then restart or whether it should start from 
the point at which you left off.
To control the point at which a clip starts, do the following:
 
1. Open the Animation pane if it does not already appear (Animations ➪ 
Animation Pane).
 
2. Open the menu for the sound clip in the Animation pane and choose Effect 
Options. The Play Audio dialog box opens with the Effect tab displayed, as shown 
in Figure 14.13.
FIGURE 14.13
You can specify that a clip plays at a different time than the beginning or set it to 
restart playing from wherever it left off if you stop it.
 
3. In the Start Playing area, choose one of these options: 
 
■From the Beginning, which is the default play mode.
 
■From the Last Position, if you want it to pick up where it left off when you 
stopped it.
 
■From Time, and then enter the number of seconds into the clip that it should 
begin playing.
 
4. Click OK.
Setting the Starting and Ending Point by Trimming
Trimming works with both audio and video clips, and in many cases it can help you avoid 
having to use a third-party video- or audio-editing program to make simple cuts to a clip.

453
Chapter 14: Adding Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks
14
To trim an audio clip, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the clip’s icon on the slide.
 
2. On the Audio Tools Playback tab, click Trim Audio. The Trim Audio dialog box 
opens.
 
3. Drag the green marker to the right to trim a portion of the beginning of the 
clip. See Figure 14.14. Alternatively, enter a number of seconds to trim in the Start 
Time box.
FIGURE 14.14
Trim from the beginning and/or end of the clip.
 
4. Drag the red marker to the left to trim a portion of the end of the clip. 
Alternatively, enter a number of seconds to trim in the End Time box.
 
5. Preview the trimming by clicking the Play button. Then adjust the trimming as 
needed.
 
6. When you are satisfied with the trim points, click OK to accept the trim.
Trimmed parts of the clip will be deleted if you use the File ➪ Info ➪ Compress Media command to decrease the 
size of your presentation fi le.
If you use both methods to specify a clip’s starting point — Effect Options and trimming — the effects are not cumu-
lative, but the longer of the two delays takes effect. So, for example, if you specifi ed 10 seconds using the Effect 
Options command and 20 seconds in the Start Time box in the Trim Audio dialog box, the clip would be trimmed by 
20 seconds at the beginning. Confusing? Yes. Stick with one method or the other when possible.
Adjusting the Fade Duration
The fade duration is the amount of time at the beginning and/or end of the clip when the 
volume will gradually increase (at the beginning) or decrease (at the end).  

454
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
To set a fade duration, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the clip’s icon on the slide.
 
2. On the Audio Tools Playback tab, enter a number of seconds in the Fade In box.
 
3. Enter a number of seconds in the Fade Out box.
Setting a Clip to Continue across Multiple Slides
Normally a clip will stop playing after it has played once (or however many times you have 
set it up to play) or when you click the mouse or advance to the next slide. However, if you 
are using a music track such as an MP3 ﬁ le, you might want it to continue playing across 
multiple slides.
Earlier in the chapter, you learned how on the Audio Tools Playback tab you can mark the 
Play Across Slides check box or click the Play in Background button. When you do either of 
those things, PowerPoint sets up that sound to continue playing through 999 slides (or as 
many slides as you have, if fewer than that).
If you would like the clip to stop after fewer slides than that, you must adjust the Stop 
Playing setting in the Play Audio dialog box. Follow these steps:
 
1. In the Animation pane, right-click the clip and choose Effect Options. The Play 
Audio dialog box opens with the Effect tab displayed.
 
2. In the Stop Playing area, choose one of these options: 
 
■On Click to go back to the default play mode (same as choosing Start on Click 
elsewhere).
 
■After Current Slide to stop the audio when you move to the next slide or when 
the clip has ﬁ nished playing, whichever comes ﬁ rst. This setting allows the clip 
to continue playing through mouse clicks, as long as the slide does not advance.
 
■After _____ Slides, and then enter a number of slides; the audio will continue 
until the speciﬁ ed number of additional slides have passed. Use 999 for the 
entire presentation, or use a smaller number, as in Figure 14.15.
 
3. Click OK.
What if you want to jump around in an audio clip? For example, suppose you want to play the fi rst 20 seconds of the 
clip and then skip to the 75-second point. You can do that by inserting two separate copies of the clip. Set each one 
with the start time desired for it, and then in the Animation pane, set one of them to After Previous and make the 
other copy the previous animation event. Alternately, you can set bookmarks on the audio control and then add trig-
gers to the bookmarks. (That latter method has the advantage of keeping the fi le size smaller because you have only 
one copy of the clip in the presentation.) Those instructions will make more sense to you after you have read Chapter 
16, which covers custom animation effects in detail.

Specifying the Sound Volume
When you give your presentation, you can specify an overall volume using the computer’s 
volume controls in Windows. However, sometimes you might want the volume of one sound 
to be different from others. To set the volume for a speciﬁ c sound, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the clip on the slide.
 
2. On the Audio Tools Playback tab, click the Volume button. A menu appears.
 
3. Choose the volume level you want (Low, Medium, High, or Mute).
You can also use a volume slider to adjust the volume more precisely than is possible with 
the presets available in the preceding steps. Here’s how:
 
1. Click the clip on the slide. Play controls appear under its icon.
 
2. Click the speaker icon on the play controls. A Volume slider pops up. See 
Figure 14.16.
 
3. Drag the slider up or down to adjust the clip’s volume.
The sound will play at a consistent volume throughout the duration of the clip. If you need the volume to change part-
way through, you can use a sound-editing program to change the clip volume before inserting it.

456
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 14.16
Adjust the volume via the speaker icon on the clip’s playback controls.
Changing the Appearance of the Sound Icon
The sound icon on the slide can be formatted like any other drawn object. You can resize it 
by dragging its selection handles, or set a speciﬁ c height and width from the Audio Tools 
Format tab.
You can also right-click the sound icon and choose Format Picture to open the Format 
Picture task pane, and from there you can apply any effects that you like (shadow, reﬂ ec-
tion, and so on). All the controls in the Format Picture task pane are strictly appearance 
based and focused on the icon; there is nothing there that controls the way the sound 
plays.
Using the Advanced Timeline to Fine-Tune 
Sound Events
The Advanced Timeline option is turned on by default. A timeline appears at the bottom of 
the Animation pane, and indicators appear next to each clip to show how long it will take 
to play and at what point it starts. This is useful when you are trying to coordinate sev-
eral sound and/or video clips to play sequentially with a certain amount of space between 
them. It also saves you from having to calculate their starting and ending times in relation 
to the initial appearance of the slide.
To turn the Advanced Timeline option on or off, do the following:
 
1. If the Animation pane does not already appear, click Animation Pane on the 
Animations tab.
 
2. Open the drop-down menu for any of the items in the pane and choose Show 
Advanced Timeline. (If the command Hide Advanced Timeline appears instead, 

457
Chapter 14: Adding Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks
14
the advanced timeline is already displayed; close the menu without selecting 
anything.)
 
3. (Optional) Widen the Animation pane by dragging its left border toward the 
center of the slide so that you have more working room.
 
4. (Optional) Click the word Seconds at the bottom of the pane. This opens a menu 
where you can choose Zoom In or Zoom Out to change the zoom on the timeline.
 
5. Click a clip to select it on the Animation pane. A right-pointing arrow appears 
next to the clip. The arrow position corresponds to the place on the timeline where 
the clip is currently set to begin.
 
6. Open the clip’s drop-down menu and choose either With Previous or After 
Previous, depending on how you want it to relate to the clip that precedes it.
If there is more than one sound clip set to After Previous, a vertical line appears where the fi rst clip will fi nish. If a 
clip is set to After Previous, it cannot start before the clip that precedes it. Therefore, any delay that you set up for 
a subsequent clip will be in relation to the end of the preceding clip. If the clip is set to With Previous, the two can 
overlap.
 
7. (Optional) To reorder the clips on the list, click a clip and then click the up or 
down Re-Order arrow at the top of the pane.
 
8. To change the amount of delay that is assigned to a clip, drag the arrow next to 
the clip to the right or left. This is the same as changing the number in the Delay 
text box in the clip’s properties. A ScreenTip appears as you drag telling how much 
delay you are adding. See Figure 14.17.
FIGURE 14.17
You can use a timeline to graphically set the timing between clips on a slide.
You can use custom animation to create complex systems of sounds that play, pause, and stop in relation to other 
animated objects on the slide. Chapter 16 contains full details.

Summary
In this chapter, you learned about the many ways that you can use sound in your presenta-
tion. You learned how to place a sound object on a slide from your own PC or from Ofﬁ ce.
com, how to record your own sounds, how to associate sounds with other objects, how to 
use a CD soundtrack, and how to ﬁ ne-tune the playback settings for a sound. The next 
chapter continues to discuss multimedia by looking at how you can place video clips on 
slides.

Troubleshooting video problems
PowerPoint 2013 has great support for motion video. It not only supports many video types (includ-
ing Flash, which was difﬁ cult to integrate with PowerPoint in some earlier versions), but it allows 
you to trim the clip, bookmark a point in it, and add a wide variety of formatting to it. In this 
chapter, you’ll learn how to insert and conﬁ gure motion video.
Understanding Video Types
Three cheers for Microsoft for increasing the number of video ﬁ le types that PowerPoint supports! 
Presentation developers have long been frustrated by PowerPoint’s inability to accept certain ﬁ le 
formats, but that problem is largely in the past now. PowerPoint 2013 supports the formats listed in 
Table 15.1.
What’s the difference between a movie and a video? There really isn’t any. PowerPoint uses the terms 
interchangeably.
PowerPoint treats most video types similarly, in terms of how much control you have over their 
appearance and playback, except for the ﬁ nal two in Table 15.1: Adobe Flash Media and animated 
GIFs. Both of these deserve a bit of special discussion.

Adobe Flash Media
Flash media (.swf) is a very versatile format for creating animated, and sometimes interac-
tive, demos and games. Other names for this format are Shockwave and Macromedia Flash. 
(Macromedia was the company that developed Flash; it was acquired by Adobe.)
Flash media is commonly used in education because of its interactivity. Not only can a 
Flash clip show movement through a process, it can accept mouse clicks from a viewer. So, 
for example, after illustrating a process, the clip can offer a multiple-choice quiz for review, 
with the viewer clicking the answers.
Flash is unique in PowerPoint in that it is not embedded in the ﬁ le like other video for-
mats; by default it is linked.
PowerPoint does not offer a full set of controls for a Flash clip; you can’t trim it, for exam-
ple, and you can’t set it to fade in or out. However, you can place a Flash clip on a slide, 
resize it, and control many appearance aspects of it, such as frame color.
Animated GIF
Animated GIFs are not really videos in the traditional sense. An animated GIF is a special 
type of graphic that stores multiple versions of itself in a single ﬁ le and ﬂ ips through them 
in sequence, like an animation created by ﬂ ipping the corners of a book. When the ﬁ le is 
displayed — on a presentation slide, a web page, or some other place — it cycles through 
the still graphics at a certain speed, making a very rudimentary animation. You cannot con-
trol the animation of an animated GIF through PowerPoint, nor can you set it up to repeat a 

461
Chapter 15: Incorporating Motion Video
15
certain number of times. That information is contained within the GIF ﬁ le itself. PowerPoint 
simply reads that information and plays the GIF accordingly. They are more like animated 
clip art than real videos, but they do add an active element to an otherwise static slide.
It is possible to convert an animated GIF to a “true” video format such as AVI. However, you can’t do it using 
PowerPoint alone; you need a conversion utility. Corel Animation Shop will do this (http://www.corel.com), 
as will many GIF-editing programs.
Choosing a File Format for Your Video Recordings
You may not have a choice in the settings used for the recording of live video or the ﬁ le 
format. If you do have a choice, AVI is among the best formats for use in PowerPoint 
because of its near-universal compatibility. There may be compatibility issues with video in 
some MPEG variants, such as MPEG-2 and MPEG-4, because you might need to install a sepa-
rate DVD-playing utility or a speciﬁ c codec to handle those formats.
 
See the section “Troubleshooting Videos That Won’t Play” later in this chapter for more information on 
MPEG variants.
On the theory that Microsoft-to-Microsoft always works, the Windows Media Video format 
(.wmv) is also a good choice. Because Windows Movie Maker creates its videos in this format 
by default, it’s a good bet that they will work well in PowerPoint.
Balancing Video Impact with File Size and Performance
Clip quality is usually measured either in frames per second (fps), which is anywhere from 
15 (low) to 30 (high), or in kilobits and megabits per second, which is anywhere from 38 
Kbps to 2.1 Mbps. You might experiment with different settings to ﬁ nd one with acceptable 
quality for the task at hand with the minimum ﬁ le size. For example, with Windows Movie 
Maker, a wide variety of quality settings are available for creating video output.
When you are recording your own video clips with a video camera or other device, it is easy 
to overshoot. Video clips take up a huge amount of disk space, and inserting large video 
clips into a PowerPoint ﬁ le can make that ﬁ le very large. Even if you choose to link the 
clips instead of embedding them, the clips still take up space on your hard disk.
Depending on the amount of space available on your computer’s hard disk, and whether you 
need to transfer your PowerPoint ﬁ le to another PC, you may want to keep the number of 
seconds of recorded video to a minimum to ensure that the ﬁ le size stays manageable. On 
the other hand, if you have a powerful computer with plenty of disk space and a lot of cool 
video clips to show, go for it!

462
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
After you have completed the bulk of the editing work on your presentation, you may wish to use the File ➪ Info ➪ 
Compress Media command to decrease the resolution and/or increase the compression ratio on the media clips in 
your presentation. Doing so may result in a minor loss of playback quality, but it may make the difference between a 
presentation fi tting or not fi tting on a particular disc.
Locating Video Clips
Not sure where to ﬁ nd video clips? Here are some places to start:
 
■Your own video camera. You can connect a digital video camera directly to your PC 
or connect an analog video camera to an adapter that digitizes its input. Then you 
use a video-editing program to clean them up and transfer them to your hard disk. 
Most video cameras come with such software; you can also use Windows Movie Maker.
Windows Movie Maker is not included with Windows 7 or 8. However, you can download it for free from this link: 
http://download.live.com/moviemaker.
 
■Bing Video Search. When you’re connected to the Internet, you can use the Online 
Videos command to ﬁ nd and insert video clips from a Bing search.
 
■YouTube. PowerPoint 2013 includes a search box for YouTube in its Insert Video 
dialog box, so you can search YouTube archives without leaving PowerPoint.
 
■The Internet in general. There are millions of interesting video clips on every 
imaginable subject. Use the search term “video clips” plus a few keywords that 
describe the type of clips you are looking for. Google Images is a good place to start 
looking (http://images.google.com). Some clips are copyrighted or have usage 
limitations, but others can be used freely; check the usage information provided 
with the clip.
 
■Your SkyDrive. If you have stored videos on your SkyDrive, you can access them 
from within PowerPoint.
Whenever you get a video clip from the Internet, make sure you carefully read any restrictions or usage agreements to 
avoid copyright violations. If you create a presentation using copyrighted material in an unauthorized way, you or your 
company could potentially get sued.
 
■Commercial collections of video clips and animated GIFs. Many of these compa-
nies advertise on the Internet and provide free samples for downloading. Several 
such companies have included samples in the online content for this book at www.
wiley.com/go/powerpoint2013bible.

463
Chapter 15: Incorporating Motion Video

■The Internet Archive (http://archive.org). This site contains links to huge 
repositories of public domain footage on all subjects, mostly pre-1960s material on 
which the copyright has expired. Warning — you can easily get sucked in here and 
waste several days browsing!
Placing a Video on a Slide
Your ﬁ rst step is to place the video on the slide. After that, you can worry about position, 
size, and playing options.
Just as with audio clips, you can place a video clip on a slide by inserting from a ﬁ le or 
pasting from another application or by browsing for clips online.
Inserting a Video from a File
A video clip ﬁ le inserted in PowerPoint 2013 can be either embedded or linked. (This is a 
change from PowerPoint 2007 and earlier, in which all clips were linked.)
 
■Embedded. The default. The clip is inserted into the presentation ﬁ le, so if you 
copy or distribute the presentation ﬁ le, the clip goes along with it automatically. 
Because the presentation ﬁ le serves as a container for the clip, the presentation 
ﬁ le’s size grows by the size of the video clip ﬁ le (plus a little extra for overhead).
 
■Linked. A link to the clip is placed on the slide, so the clip does not take up space 
in the presentation ﬁ le. When you play back the presentation, the video clip must 
be in the expected location for it to work.
If you plan on moving the presentation to another location later, and you want to use links, place the video clip in the 
same folder as the presentation itself before you insert the video clip into the presentation. That way the path to it 
stored in the presentation fi le will be relative, and the link will still work after you move the presentation and video 
clip. Alternatively, you can use the Package Presentation for CD feature to transfer a presentation and all of its sup-
port fi les, including videos, to a new location. See “Giving a Presentation on a Different Computer” in Chapter 18, 
“Preparing for a Live Presentation.”
Before inserting a clip, decide which method is best for your situation. Then follow these 
steps (for all video types except animated GIF):
 
1. Display the slide on which the video should appear.
 
2. If there is a content placeholder on the slide that will accommodate a video 
clip, click that and then click the Browse button next to From a File. Otherwise, 
choose Insert ➪ Media ➪ Video ➪ Video on My PC.
 
3. In the Insert Video dialog box, locate and select the clip you want. You might 
need to change the ﬁ le type setting in the dialog box.

464
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
 
4. If you want the clip to be embedded, click Insert. 
 
5. Alternatively, if you want the clip to be linked, click the down arrow to the 
right of the Insert button and choose Link to File. See Figure 15.1. The video clip 
appears on the slide.
FIGURE 15.1
To link, rather than embed, open the Insert button’s menu and choose Link to File.
Inserting Video from Your SkyDrive
If you store videos on your SkyDrive, you can easily insert them into your presentations by 
browsing the SkyDrive contents. To do so, choose Insert ➪ Media ➪ Video ➪ Online Video 
and then click the Browse button next to your SkyDrive. Select the desired clip and click 
Insert.
If you have the SkyDrive for Windows app installed in Windows, you can also directly 
browse your SkyDrive just as if it were a local drive. Choose Insert ➪ Media ➪ Video ➪ Video 
on My PC, and then under Favorites, click SkyDrive. (Figure 15.1 shows the SkyDrive, rather 
than a local disk, being accessed.) If you don’t have a SkyDrive shortcut under Favorites, 
you can get it for free. Go to http://www.skydrive.com and click the Get SkyDrive Apps 
hyperlink.

Inserting a Video from a Bing Search
Just as you searched for online pictures in Chapter 11, “Working With Clip Art and Photos,” 
and online audio clips in Chapter 14, “Adding Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks,” you can 
search Bing for online video clips. The process is mostly the same as in those other chapters. 
Follow these steps to locate and insert a video clip using Bing:
 
1. Choose Insert ➪ Media ➪ Video ➪ Online Video. The Insert Video dialog box 
opens. 
 
2. In the Bing Video Search text box, type the keyword(s) to search for, as shown 
in Figure 15.2, and press Enter. The search results appear.
 
3. Click the desired clip and click Insert. The clip is downloaded and inserted into 
your presentation. (It is embedded, not linked.)
FIGURE 15.2
Use the Insert Video dialog box to insert from a Bing video search.
Linking to a YouTube Video
YouTube is a huge repository of video clips on the Internet. You can search it much as you 
can search Bing (see the previous section), but with one important difference: YouTube 
videos are not downloaded and embedded into your presentation; instead, a link is created 
in the presentation ﬁ le that refers to a streaming copy of the video on http://www
.youtube.com. When you play back the video during a presentation, you must have an 
active Internet connection in order for it to work. 

466
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
The form of link used for a YouTube clip is not the traditional type of link whose properties 
you can edit in PowerPoint (as covered in “Managing Video Links” later in this chapter). It 
doesn’t show up on a list of the links in the presentation, either. You can’t break the link 
without removing the clip entirely from your presentation. Follow these steps to locate and 
link to a YouTube video:
 
1. Choose Insert ➪ Media ➪ Video ➪ Online Video. The Insert Video dialog box 
opens. 
 
2. In the YouTube text box, type the keyword(s) to search for, and press Enter.
The chosen clip appears on the active slide. You can resize it, and you can control its 
appearance in most of the same ways as other video clips (from the Video Tools Format 
tab), but most of the commands on the Video Tools Playback tab are unavailable for 
YouTube clips.
Not all YouTube clips can be placed on a slide because of the differences in licensing restrictions; if you see an error 
when trying to place a YouTube clip, you may have to try a different clip.
Embedding Code That Links to an Online Video
Some sites on the Internet encourage people to share links to their videos by providing 
embed codes for each video. An embed code is a URL that contains all the information 
needed to not only link to the clip but to present it at the destination in a certain way, 
such as with or without playback controls, at a certain size or resolution, and so on. For 
example, notice that the dialog box in Figure 15.3 contains a button you can click to get 
the embed code, which can easily be selected and copied to the Windows Clipboard and 
then pasted into an application. 
As with YouTube clips, clips inserted by embed code are also not editable in PowerPoint, 
and you must have an Internet connection active when you show the presentation in order 
for them to play back successfully.
To use an embed code, follow these steps:
 
1. Copy the embed code from the website where you found it to the Clipboard. 
 
2. Choose Insert ➪ Media ➪ Video ➪ Online Video. The Insert Video dialog box 
opens. 
 
3.  Click in the From a Video Embed Code box.
 
4. Press Ctrl+V to paste the embed code from the Clipboard and press Enter.
Don’t panic if the clip appears as a plain black box with no playback controls on the slide 
in Normal view. Switch to Slide Show view and you’ll see the clip as it will appear to your 
audience.

Managing Clip Files and Links
In the following sections, you’ll learn some ways to manage the compatibility, ﬁ le size and 
performance, and linkage of video clips in a presentation. 
Optimizing Media Compatibility
Versions of PowerPoint prior to 2010 did not allow videos to be embedded and supported a 
smaller number of ﬁ le formats, so you may run into problems when you move a PowerPoint 
2013 presentation to a PC that uses PowerPoint 2007 or earlier. This may come as a surprise 
to PowerPoint 2007 users because in most ways PowerPoint 2007 is very similar to 2010 and 
2013. Videos are the one area in which they differ greatly.
To minimize the impact of such problems, there are two things you can do. One is to link all 
videos rather than embedding them. Delete the embedded versions and reinsert them, choos-
ing Link to File from the Insert button’s drop-down menu in the Insert Video dialog box.
The other is to run the Optimize Media Compatibility utility by following these steps:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Info ➪ Optimize Media Compatibility. If there are any videos that 
could be converted to another format to improve their compatibility, they are auto-
matically processed, as shown in Figure 15.4. 
 
2. When the optimization process is complete, click the Close button to close the 
Optimize Media Compatibility dialog box.

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 15.4
The AgilityRun video is being converted into a more compatible format.
Some clip types may show as Unsupported in the results that appear after optimization. 
This means that the clip’s format may not be playable in an earlier PowerPoint version; you 
might need to convert that clip to some other format using a third-party video editor and 
then reinsert it into PowerPoint.
If you back-save (that is, save in PowerPoint 97–2003 format) a presentation fi le that contains videos, any videos 
that are in formats unsupported by that version will be saved as static graphics (of the fi rst frame of the video).
Optimizing Media Size and Performance
Video ﬁ les can take up a lot of space and can result in a large PowerPoint presentation ﬁ le. 
If the quality of the video playback is not of critical importance, you may want to sacriﬁ ce 
a certain amount of quality to get a smaller ﬁ le that opens and closes more quickly, starts 
the video playback more quickly, and takes up less space.

469
Chapter 15: Incorporating Motion Video
15
Save a copy of your presentation with another name before you compress the media clips. That way, if the playback 
quality suffers too much, you can revert to the higher-quality version. This also gives you the high-quality version to 
play back locally.
To ﬁ nd out how much disk space the media ﬁ les in your presentation (both video and 
audio) are currently occupying, choose File ➪ Info and look under the Media Size and 
Performance heading. For example, in Figure 15.5, you can see that the media ﬁ les take 
up 26MB of space. Then, if you want to make a change, click the Compress Media button, 
and from the menu that appears, click a quality setting that best describes the trade-off 
you want to make between quality and performance. The compression begins immediately. 
When it’s ﬁ nished, examine the results reported in the Compress Media dialog box, and 
then click the Close button. 
FIGURE 15.5
Choose a compression amount to save disk space if desired.

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Managing Video Links
In Chapter 13, in the section “Working with Linked and Embedded Objects,” you learned 
how to update and break links to outside content. Those same techniques work for linked 
video clips if you choose to link them rather than embed them. (An exception is if you 
have links to online video content like YouTube or an embedded link code; these can’t be 
managed in PowerPoint.)
Choose File ➪ Info ➪ View Links. The View Links command is located under the Optimize 
Media Compatibility heading. If you don’t see it there, your presentation has no links you 
can manage. 
In the Links dialog box, you see all the links in your presentation, including those to 
external online sources like YouTube. However, when you select one of those links, you ﬁ nd 
that there is only one option available for it: Open Source (which plays the clip in a web 
browser at the original source page). For clips that are linked from other sources, such as 
your own LAN, all of the buttons are available, as in Figure 15.6. 
FIGURE 15.6
Linked videos appear in the Links dialog box.
Changing the Video’s Formatting
The formatting for a video clip refers to the size, shape, position, and effects of the 
frame in which the video appears. It doesn’t have anything to do with the playback of 
the video itself. (See “Specifying Playback Options” later in this chapter for playback 
customization.) 
The following sections explain how to affect the formatting of a video clip in various ways.

471
Chapter 15: Incorporating Motion Video
15
Choosing the Size of the Video Clip Window
You can resize a video clip’s window just as you can any other object. Simply drag its 
selection handles. Be careful, however, that you do not distort the image by resizing in 
only one dimension. Make sure you drag a corner selection handle, not one on a single side 
of the object. To set an exact size, enter the dimensions in the Height and Width boxes on 
the Video Tools Format tab.
Also be aware that when you enlarge a video clip’s window, the quality of the clip suffers.
If you make the clip large and are unhappy with its quality, you can reset it to its original 
size by following these steps:
 
1. Right-click the clip and choose Size and Position, or click the dialog box 
launcher for the Size group on the Video Tools Format tab. The Format Video 
task pane opens with the Size controls displayed.
 
2. Click Reset.
 
3. Close the task pane.
Setting the Initial Image (Poster Frame)
The poster frame is the image that appears when the clip is not playing. By default it is the 
ﬁ rst frame of the video clip. However, if the ﬁ rst frame of the video is a blank screen, you 
may want to use something else instead.
You can choose an external image ﬁ le for the poster frame, or you select a frame from the 
video itself.
Choosing an External Poster Frame
To use an external still image as the poster frame, follow these steps:
 
1. In Normal view, select the video.
 
2. Choose Video Tools Format ➪ Adjust ➪ Poster Frame ➪ Image from File. The 
Insert Pictures dialog box appears.
 
3. Select the picture you want to use. You can select from your own PC by clicking 
Browse next to From a File, or you can search Ofﬁ ce.com or Bing or choose a ﬁ le 
from your SkyDrive. See Chapter 11 for details about choosing the various types of 
pictures.
If the picture you choose is a different size than the video clip, the poster frame may stretch the image so that it 
loses its aspect ratio and becomes distorted-looking. Crop the picture ahead of time to match the aspect ratio of the 
video clip to avoid this problem.

472
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Choosing a Video Frame as the Poster Frame
To use a frame from the video itself as the poster frame, do the following:
 
1. In Normal view, select the video clip.
 
2. Verify that playback controls appear below the clip in Normal view. (They do for 
most ﬁ le types, but not for Flash, animated GIFs, or linked ﬁ les from websites.) If 
there are no playback controls, you cannot proceed with these steps.
 
3. Click the Play button (right-pointing triangle) on the controls below the clip.
 
4. When the video displays the frame you want to use, click the Pause button 
(two vertical bars) on the controls below the clip.
 
5. Choose Video Tools Format ➪ Adjust ➪ Poster Frame ➪ Current Frame.
Resetting the Poster Frame
To return to the default poster frame (the ﬁ rst frame of the video clip), select the clip and 
then choose Video Tools Format ➪ Adjust ➪ Poster Frame ➪ Reset.
Applying Corrections and Color Washes
You can apply brightness and contrast corrections to a video clip in the same way you 
do to photographic images. This was covered in detail in Chapter 11. Choose Video Tools 
Format ➪ Adjust ➪ Corrections and then choose one of the sample images that reﬂ ects the 
changes to be made. See Figure 15.7.
FIGURE 15.7
Adjust the brightness and/or contrast of the clip if desired.

473
Chapter 15: Incorporating Motion Video
15
The same color washes that you learned about in Chapter 11 for photos also apply to most 
video clips. Click the Color button and choose a color wash, or choose More Variations for 
more color choices. Choosing a color from the Color button’s menu (see Figure 15.8) will set 
the video to play as a monochrome (single-color) clip, using the color you chose.
FIGURE 15.8
Choose a color wash or other color setting.
Applying Video Styles and Effects
On the Video Tools Format tab, you’ll ﬁ nd the same style and effect options as for photos.
Here’s a sampling of what you can do; refer to Chapter 11 for more details on each of these 
options.
 
■Styles. Open the Styles palette and pick one of the presets there to apply a com-
bination of frame shape and image effects. You can also right-click the clip on the 
slide and then click the Style icon to select from a smaller pop-up list of styles.
 
■Video Effects. Click this button for access to the same formatting options as for 
images: Shadow, Reﬂ ection, Glow, Soft Edges, Bevel, and 3-D.
 
■Video Border. Click this button to choose a border color and thickness for the 
video clip’s outer frame.
 
■Video Shape. Click this button and then choose one of the built-in shapes to 
alter the shape of the video clip’s frame. You might choose to make it a rounded 
rectangle, for example, or an oval.
 
■Crop. You can crop the window of the clip so that part of the clip does not appear 
(uncommon).

474
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
 
■Send Backward. You can send the clip behind other objects on the slide. This 
makes it possible to use overlapping lines, shapes, and text boxes to annotate 
the video clip window. You can also Bring Forward to move a clip in front of other 
objects. 
The Reset Design button on the Video Tools Format tab resets everything you have done to a clip’s formatting except 
the setting of the poster frame. To reset the poster frame, choose Format ➪ Adjust ➪ Poster Frame ➪ Reset.
Specifying Playback Options
Playback options are the options that control when and how the clip plays. Unlike the for-
matting options you learned about in the previous sections, these controls affect the action 
of the clip, the unique qualities it has as a motion video object rather than a static image.
Displaying or Hiding Playback Controls
By default, when a video clip plays in Slide Show view, playback controls appear below 
it. They make it easy to start and stop the clip and to skip to a different section of it (by 
clicking on the timeline below the clip).
You may sometimes want to hide those controls, however. To hide them, on the Slide Show 
tab, clear the Show Media Controls check box. Note that this setting applies to the entire 
presentation; you unfortunately cannot disable or enable playback controls separately for 
individual clips.
Choosing a Start Trigger
There are a number of ways to specify when a clip starts playing. Let’s take a look at some 
of these.
Making a Clip Play Automatically or On Click
A video clip’s default playback setting is On Click, meaning that it plays during Slide Show 
view only when the clip itself is clicked. You can change this behavior, so that it plays 
automatically when it appears, by changing the Start setting on the Video Tools Playback 
tab, as shown in Figure 15.9. (You can also set this on the Animations tab, or you can right-
click the video clip, click the Start icon, and choose a setting from its menu.)
If you set the clip to start automatically, you can optionally specify a number of seconds that should pass before that 
occurs. On the Animations tab, enter a number of seconds in the Delay box to build in this delay. You’ll learn more 
about delaying the start of an animation event in Chapter 16, “Creating Animation Effects and Transitions.”

475
Chapter 15: Incorporating Motion Video
15
FIGURE 15.9
Set a clip to play back either automatically or on click.
Playing the Clip on Mouseover
By default, an inserted clip is already set up to play on click, but not when the mouse 
pointer passes over it. To play the clip when the mouse pointer passes over it (mouseover), 
use the Action command, like this:
 
1. Select the clip in Normal view.
 
2. Choose Insert ➪ Links ➪ Action. The Action Settings dialog box opens.
 
3. Click the Mouse Over tab.
 
4. Select the Object Action button. The default action is Play, as shown in 
Figure 15.10. Leave it set that way.
FIGURE 15.10
Action settings on the Mouse Over tab control whether the clip plays when the 
mouse passes over it.
 
5. Click OK.

476
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Triggering Play by Clicking Another Object
Triggers specify when the action should occur. They enable you to trigger an event as a 
result of clicking the event object or something other than the event object. For example, 
you could put a piece of clip art on the slide next to a video and have the video playback 
begin when you click the clip art.
Trigger animation is set automatically for the clip itself when you insert it so that the clip 
starts and pauses when you click it. To set up a trigger for an object other than the clip 
itself, follow these steps:
 
1. Place both the video and the trigger object (such as a button or a piece of clip 
art) on the same slide.
 
2. Choose Animations ➪ Advanced Animation ➪ Animation Pane. The Animation 
pane appears. There may already be an animation listed there that plays and pauses 
the video clip.
 
3. Select the video clip and choose Animations ➪ Advanced Animation ➪ Add 
Animation ➪ Play. If the clip begins playing immediately, click the Stop button in 
the Animation pane.
A new Play animation event appears at the top of the Animation pane. See 
Figure 15.11.
FIGURE 15.11
Add a new Play animation for the video clip.

4. Right-click this new event and choose Timing. The Play Animation dialog box 
opens.
 
5. Click the Triggers button to expand the Triggers controls if they are not 
already displayed.
 
6. Click Start Effect on Click Of.
 
7. Open the drop-down list and choose the object that will serve as the trigger. 
For example, in Figure 15.12, the object is a rounded rectangle that has the words 
Press Play in it.
FIGURE 15.12
Set up optional triggers that make the clip play when you click something other than 
the clip.
 
8. Click OK. If the clip begins playing again, click the Stop button in the Animation 
pane.
 
9. Test the trigger in Slide Show view.
Choosing Clip Playback Options
On the Video Tools Playback tab, the Video Options group contains a series of check boxes 
that govern various small details about the clip playback. Mark or clear any of these as 
desired:
 
■Play Full Screen. Switches the clip to full-screen size when it is playing in Slide 
Show view.
 
■Hide While Not Playing. Hides the still image (the poster frame) of the clip.

478
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
 
■Loop Until Stopped. Plays the clip over and over until you move to the next slide 
or stop it using its playback controls.
 
■Rewind After Playing. When the clip ﬁ nishes, normally the ﬁ nal frame remains 
on-screen; marking this check box makes the ﬁ rst frame appear again instead.
If you are using an animated GIF, it plays the number of times specifi ed in its header. That could be infi nite looping 
(0), or it could be a specifi ed number of times. You can’t set it to do otherwise. (You can, however, delay its initial 
appearance with custom animation. See Chapter 16 for details.) Other videos, such as your own recorded video clips, 
have more settings you can control.
Controlling the Volume
The clip can have a different volume setting than the rest of the presentation’s audio. That 
way you can compensate for a clip that is louder or quieter than the other audio in the 
presentation.
To change the clip’s volume level, click the Volume button on the Video Tools Playback tab 
and then choose Low, Medium, High, or Mute from the menu.
Trimming the Clip
You can trim footage off the beginning or end of a video clip from within PowerPoint 2013. 
This makes it possible for you to do some rudimentary editing without having to use a 
separate video-editing program.
Not all types of clips can be trimmed. If the Trim Video button is unavailable on the Playback tab, the clip you have 
selected can be trimmed only by using a third-party program.
To trim a clip, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the clip on the slide.
 
2. Choose Video Tools Playback ➪ Editing ➪ Trim Video. The Trim Video dialog box 
opens.
 
3. To trim off the beginning of the clip, do the following: 
 
a. Click the Play button (right-pointing triangle) and wait until the part of the 
clip plays where you want to begin.
 
b. Click the Pause button (the two vertical lines). A thin blue vertical line on the 
timeline shows where the clip has stopped. 

479
Chapter 15: Incorporating Motion Video
15
If you didn’t pause it at exactly the right place, use the Next Frame or Previous 
Frame button to move back or forward one frame per click until the marker is in 
the right spot. 
You can also drag the thin vertical line to the left or right on the timeline to 
move it manually.
 
c. Note the number above the timeline; this tells you exactly how many seconds 
into the clip the marked position represents.
 
d. Drag the green marker on the left end of the timeline to the position you 
marked, using the number that appears above the timeline as a reference. Or, 
alternatively, enter the value you noted in step 3c in the Start Time box. See 
Figure 15.13.
FIGURE 15.13
You can trim footage off the beginning and/or end of the clip.

4. To trim off the end of the clip, do the following: 
 
a. Click the Play button (right-pointing triangle) and wait until the part of the 
clip plays where you want to stop. Then click the Pause button. Or, alterna-
tively, click on the timeline to jump to a certain position and pause there.
 
b. Note the number above the timeline; this tells you exactly how many seconds 
into the clip the marked position represents.

480
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
 
c. Drag the red marker on the right end of the timeline to the position you 
marked, using the number that appears above the timeline as a reference. Or, 
alternatively, enter the value you noted in step 4b in the Start Time box. 
 
5. Click OK to accept the trimming.
Compressing the media in the presentation (File ➪ Compress Media) deletes the trimmed parts from the embedded 
copy of the clip.
Setting Fade In and Fade Out Durations
Some clips already begin and/or end with a “fade to black” effect. If one of your clips 
doesn’t and you want such an effect, you can apply it manually from within PowerPoint.
Select the clip, and on the Video Tools Playback tab, enter values (in seconds) in the Fade 
In and/or Fade Out boxes. Seconds are expressed as whole numbers, so 1.25 would be 1.25 
seconds. The larger the number you enter, the longer the effect will take and the more 
obvious it will seem. See Figure 15.14.
FIGURE 15.14
Set a clip to fade in and/or fade out if desired.
Fade controls
Setting a Bookmark
You can set bookmarks (in other words, markers) wherever you want within the video 
and then jump among those marked locations during a presentation. To jump ahead to the 
next bookmark in a video clip, you can press Alt+End; to jump backward to the previous 
bookmark, use Alt+Home.
To set a video bookmark, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the video clip on the slide.
 
2. In Normal view, use the Play button (right-pointing triangle) below the video 
clip to begin a preview of it.

481
Chapter 15: Incorporating Motion Video
15
 
3. When the video playback gets to the point where you want the bookmark, 
click Pause to stop playback at that spot, and then choose Video Tools 
Playback ➪ Bookmarks ➪ Add Bookmark.
A bookmark is inserted at that spot. A bookmark symbol (tiny white or gold circle) appears 
on the playback timeline under the clip. See Figure 15.15.
FIGURE 15.15
Set bookmarks within a clip’s playback if desired.
Bookmark
To remove a bookmark, click the bookmark symbol and then choose Video Tools 
Playback ➪ Bookmarks ➪ Remove Bookmark.
You can then set up a trigger to a bookmark so that something happens when the 
video playback reaches a certain point. For example, you could have some text appear 
over the top of the video at a certain point and then disappear. (Use Video Tools 
Format ➪ Arrange ➪ Send Backward to move the video behind the text box as needed.)
Here’s how to set a trigger to a bookmark.
 
1. Add the object to the slide that should appear at a certain point in the video 
playback. For example, add a text box and type the needed text in it.
 
2. Select the object that should appear, and add an entrance animation effect 
to it. For example, for a simple “appear” effect, choose Animations ➪ Animation ➪ 
Appear. (You can choose an effect other than Appear if you like.).
 
3. With the object still selected, choose Animations ➪ Advanced 
Animation ➪ Trigger ➪ On Bookmark and click the desired bookmark. 
The bookmarks are consecutively numbered, from left to right on the clip timeline.

482
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
If you want the object to exit at a certain point in the video, continue with these 
steps.
 
4. (Optional) Set another bookmark at the point where the object should exit.
 
5. Add an exit effect to the object. For example, for a simple “disappear” effect, 
choose Animations ➪ Advanced Animation ➪ Add Animation ➪ Disappear. (It’s in 
the Exit section of the menu.)
 
6. Choose Animations ➪ Trigger ➪ On Bookmark and choose the bookmark that 
represents the position at which it should exit.
You can repeat that process for multiple objects so that different text or graphics appear 
over the top of the video at different points.
Troubleshooting Video Problems
Here are some workarounds available for most of the common problems with PowerPoint 
video clips.
Working with Older Presentations in PowerPoint 2013
When you open a presentation created in PowerPoint 2007 or earlier, the video clips 
continue to play. However, you will probably want to update the ﬁ le to the latest 
PowerPoint format so you can enjoy the additional capabilities.
After opening the ﬁ le, choose File ➪ Info ➪ Convert to update it to PowerPoint 2013 for-
mat. In the Save As dialog box that appears, specify a name for the new converted version 
(the original remains intact) and click Save.
After you save the presentation in the new format, all PowerPoint 2013 video-editing 
features are available, just as if you had started this presentation in version 2013 from 
scratch.
Troubleshooting Videos That Won’t Insert
If you are inserting a QuickTime clip, you will need to have a QuickTime player installed, 
and you need to have the 32-bit version of Ofﬁ ce. The 64-bit version of PowerPoint cannot 
accept inserted QuickTime movie ﬁ les because the 64-bit Windows operating system does 
not have the needed 64-bit codecs for that format. See http://support.microsoft
.com/kb/982689 for more information.
To work around this issue, you can convert the clips to Windows Media Video (.wmv) format 
using a third-party ﬁ le converter.

483
Chapter 15: Incorporating Motion Video
15
Troubleshooting Videos That Won’t Play
For problems with videos that won’t play, explore one or more of these possible ﬁ xes:
 
■Update your players. Make sure you have the latest versions of the following 
programs: 
 
■Windows Media Player (should be version 10 or higher)
 
■Flash Player (should be version 9 or higher)
 
■QuickTime
 
■DirectX
 
■Play it in an external player. If your video won’t play in PowerPoint but it will 
play outside of PowerPoint using one of your media players you have installed, 
insert the clip as an object with the Insert ➪ Object command. That way it will play 
using an external player during the presentation.
 
■Convert to WMV format. PowerPoint easily handles Windows Media Video (WMV) 
format clips. You can import a video clip into Windows Movie Maker (free with 
Windows XP and Windows Vista and available for free download if you have 
Windows 7 or 8) and then export it to WMV format from there.
If you record video with your own video camera and it won’t play in PowerPoint, it’s probably because your camera 
uses a proprietary codec. Use the software that comes with the camera to re-render your video using a more common 
codec. A utility called GSpot, available at http://www.headbands.com/gspot, can identify what codecs are 
being used in your video fi les. 
This may seem hard to believe, but it works. If you get an error message when you try to drag and drop an AVI video 
clip into your presentation or if you try to insert it and PowerPoint simply ignores you, try changing the fi lename 
extension from .avi to .mpg. This often will fi x it.
Troubleshooting Poor Playback Quality
Be aware that slower, older computers, especially those with a meager amount of RAM, may 
not present your video clip to its best advantage. The sound may not match the video, the 
video may be jerky, and a host of other little annoying performance glitches may occur. On 
such PCs, it is best to limit the live-action video that you use and rely more on animated 
GIFs, simple WMV animations, and other less system-taxing video clips.
When you are constructing a presentation, keep in mind that you may be showing it on 
a lesser computer than the one on which you are creating it and therefore performance 

484
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
problems may crop up during the presentation that you did not anticipate. Here are some 
ideas for at least partially ﬁ xing the problem:
 
■Make sure you test the presentation on the actual computer on which you are going 
to show it, especially if you need a nonstandard codec.
 
■Copy the entire presentation and all of its support ﬁ les to the fastest hard disk on 
the system instead of running it from a CD. Hard disks have much faster access 
time. Use File ➪ Export ➪ Package Presentation for CD to collect the needed ﬁ les, 
instead of manually copying them through Windows, to ensure that you get all of 
the ﬁ les and properly resolve their links.
 
■Run the entire presentation on the playback PC from start to ﬁ nish beforehand. If 
there are delays, jerks, and lack of synchronization, just let it play itself out. Then 
try the whole presentation again, and it will usually be much better the second 
time. This happens because the system caches some of the data, and it’s faster to 
read it from the cache than from the disk.
 
■Make sure the playback PC is in the best shape it can be in. If feasible, upgrade its 
RAM. Run Disk Defragmenter and Disk Cleanup on it, and make sure its video driver 
is up to date.
 
■Work with the original media clips to decrease their complexity, and then reimport 
them into PowerPoint. For example, use video-editing software to lower the frames-
per-second of video clips, and use image-editing software to lower the dots-per-
inch of any large graphics.
 
■If possible, spread out the more complex slides in the presentation so that they are 
not adjacent to one another. Have an intervening slide that is just simple text.
 
■If all else fails, convert the presentation into a video, or transfer the presentation 
to DVD or videotape from the original PC (where presumably it plays correctly).
Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to place video clips on your slides and how to set them up 
to play when you want them to. You learned about the differences between various video 
formats and how to set up clips to play when you display the slide and/or when you click 
them. You can set a clip’s volume and appearance and make it play at different starting 
points and stop at different ending points.
In the next chapter, you’ll learn about transitions and object animation. With a transition, 
you can create special effects for the movement from one slide to another. With object ani-
mation, you can control the entry and exit of individual objects on a slide. You can make 
them ﬂ y in with special effects or build them dramatically one paragraph, bar, or shape at 
a time.

16
Creating Animation Effects and 
Transitions
IN THIS CHAPTER
Assigning transitions to slides
Animating slide content
Layering animated objects
S
o far in this book, you have learned about several types of moving objects on a slide. One 
object type is a movie, or video clip, that has been created in an animation program or 
recorded with a video camera. Another type is an animated GIF, which is essentially a graphic 
that has some special properties that enable it to play a short animation sequence over and over.
However, neither of these types is what PowerPoint means by animation. In PowerPoint, animation 
is the way that individual objects enter or exit a slide. All of the objects on a slide with no anima-
tion simply appear at the same time when you display it. (Boring, eh?) However, you can apply ani-
mation to a slide so that the bullet points ﬂ y in from the left, one at a time, and the graphic drops 
down from the top afterward.
A transition is another kind of animation. A transition refers to the entry or exit of the entire slide 
rather than of an individual object on the slide.
Here are some ideas for using animation effectively in your presentations:
 
■Animate parts of a chart so that the data appears one series at a time. This technique 
works well if you want to talk about each series separately.
 
■Set up questions and answers on a slide so that the question appears ﬁ rst, and then, when 
you click the question, the answer appears.
 
■Dim each bullet point when the next one comes into view so that you are, in effect, high-
lighting the current one.
 
■Make an object appear and then disappear. For example, you might have an image of a 
lightning bolt that ﬂ ashes on the slide for one second and then disappears or a picture of a

race car that drives onto the slide from the left and then immediately drives out of 
sight to the right.
 
■Rearrange the order in which objects appear on the slide. For example, you could 
make numbered points appear from the bottom up for a top ten list.
Assigning Transitions to Slides
Transitions determine how you get from slide A to slide B. Back in the old slide projec-
tor days, there was only one transition: the old slide was pushed out, and the new slide 
dropped into place. However, with a computerized presentation, you can choose from all 
kinds of fun transitions, including wipes, blinds, ﬂ y-ins, and much more. These transi-
tions are almost exactly like the animations, except that they apply to the whole slide (or 
at least the background — the base part of the slide — if the slide’s objects are separately 
animated).
The transition effect for a slide refers to how the slide enters and not how it exits. As a result, if you want to assign a 
particular transition while moving from slide 1 to slide 2, you would assign the transition effect to slide 2.
The individual transitions are hard to describe in words; it is best if you just view them 
on-screen to understand what each one does. You should try out several transitions before 
making your ﬁ nal selection.
Setting Transition Effects and Timings
The default transition effect is None. One slide replaces another with no special effect. If 
you want something ﬂ ashier than that, you must choose it from the Transitions tab.
As you are setting up the transition effect, you have a choice of allowing it to occur manu-
ally (that is, On Mouse Click) or automatically. Generally speaking, if there is a live person 
controlling and presenting the show, transitions should be manual. With manual transi-
tions, the presenter must click the mouse to move to the next slide. This might sound like 
a lot of work, but it helps the speaker to maintain control of the show. If someone in the 
audience asks a question or wants to make a comment, the show does not continue on 
blindly but pauses to accommodate the delay. However, if you are preparing a self-running 
presentation, such as for a kiosk, automatic transitions are a virtual necessity. 
Later you will learn how to set the timing between slides. Timings also are in effect when 
you record narration, as described in Chapter 19, “Designing User-Interactive or Self-
Running Presentations.”
To assign a transition effect and control its timing, follow these steps:

1. View or select the slide in Normal or Slide Sorter view. If you use Slide Sorter 
view, you can more easily select multiple slides to which you can apply the 
transition.
 
2. (Optional) On the Transitions tab, in the Transition to This Slide group, click 
the transition you want to use. Open the gallery to see additional transitions if 
needed. 
If you do not want a transition effect, do not choose a transition; instead leave the 
default transition (None) selected.
 
3. Click Effect Options and select any options for the chosen effect transition as 
desired. The effects listed will be different depending on the transition you chose. 
Figure 16.1 shows the options available for the Push transition.
FIGURE 16.1

4. In the Timing group, mark or clear the following check boxes: 
 
■On Mouse Click. Transitions when you click the mouse.
 
■After. Transitions after a speciﬁ ed amount of time has passed. (Enter the time, 
in seconds, in the associated text box.)
It is perfectly okay to leave the On Mouse Click check box selected, even if you choose automatic transitions — in 
fact, this is a good idea. There may be times when you want to manually advance to the next slide before the auto-
matic transition time has elapsed, and leaving this option selected allows you to do so.

488
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
You will probably want to assign automatic transitions to either all or none of the slides in the presentation, but not 
a mixture of the two. This is because mixed transition times can cause confusion when some of the slides automati-
cally advance and others do not. However, there may be situations in which you need to assign different timings and 
effects to the various slides’ transitions.
 
5. (Optional) Adjust the Duration setting to specify how quickly the transition 
effect will occur. 
This is not the timing between slides but rather the timing from the beginning to 
the end of the transition effect itself. For example, for a Fade transition, it deter-
mines how fast the fade occurs.
 
6. (Optional) If you want a sound associated with the transition, select it from 
the Sound drop-down list. See the next section for details.
 
7. (Optional) If you want these same transition settings to apply to all slides in the 
presentation, click Apply to All. Otherwise they apply only to the current slide.
Any automatically advancing transitions that you have set appear with the timings 
beneath each slide in Slide Sorter view, as shown in Figure 16.2.

More about Transition Sounds
Transition sounds have different controls than the sounds described in Chapter 14, “Adding 
Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks.” In the Transitions tab’s Sound menu, shown in 
Figure 16.3, you can choose from among PowerPoint’s default sound collection, or you can 
choose any of the following:
FIGURE 16.3
Select a transition sound.
 
■No Sound. Does not assign a sound to the transition.
 
■Stop Previous Sound. Stops any sound that is already playing. This usually applies 
where the previous sound was very long and was not ﬁ nished when you moved on 
to the next slide or in cases where you used the Loop Until Next Sound transition 
(see the last item on this list).
 
■Other Sound. Opens a dialog box from which you can select another WAV sound ﬁ le 
stored on your system.
 
■Loop Until Next Sound. An on/off toggle that sets whatever sound you select to 
loop continuously either until another sound is triggered or until a slide transition 
or animated object appears that has Stop Previous Sound set.

490
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Sounds associated with transitions can get annoying to your audience very quickly. Don’t use them gratuitously.
Rehearsing and Recording Transition Timings
The trouble with setting the same automatic timings for all slides is that not all slides 
deserve or need equal time on-screen. For example, some slides may have more text than 
others or more complex concepts to grasp. To allow for the differences, you can manually 
set the timings for each slide, as described in the preceding section. However, another 
way is to use the Rehearse Timings feature to run through your presentation in real time 
and allow PowerPoint to set the timings for you, based on that rehearsal. This is especially 
important if you have complex animations on the slide, because the transition timing will 
force all animations to run within that timeframe despite the timing set on the individual 
animations. Therefore you want to make sure that the transition timing is adequate to 
incorporate all animations. 
When you set timings with the Rehearse Timings feature, PowerPoint ignores any hidden slides. If you later unhide 
these slides, they are set to advance automatically. You need to individually assign them an After transition time, as 
described earlier in the chapter.
To set transition timings with the Rehearse Timings feature, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Slide Show tab, click Rehearse Timings. The slide show starts with the 
Recording toolbar, shown in Figure 16.4, in the upper-left corner.
FIGURE 16.4
Use the Recording toolbar to set timings for automatic transitions.

If you want to record voiceover narration as you rehearse and record the timings, click Record Slide Show in step 1

recording in more detail.

2. Click through the presentation, displaying each slide for as long as you want 
it to appear in the actual show. To move to the next slide, you can click the slide, 
click the Next button in the Recording toolbar (right-pointing arrow), or press Page 
Down. 
When setting timings, it may help to read the text on the slide, slowly and out 
loud, to simulate how an audience member who reads slowly would proceed. When 
you have read all of the text on the slide, pause for one or two more seconds and 
then advance. If you need to pause the rehearsal at any time, click the Pause but-
ton. When you are ready to resume, click the Pause button again. 
If you make a mistake on the timing for a slide, click the Repeat button to begin 
timing this slide again from 00:00.
When you reach the ﬁ nal slide, a dialog box appears, asking whether you want to 
keep the new slide timings.
If you want a slide to display for a fairly long time, such as 30 seconds or more, you might fi nd it faster to enter the 
desired time in the Current Slide Timing text box on the Recording toolbar rather than waiting the full amount of time 
before advancing. To do this, click in the text box, type the desired time, and press Tab. You must press the Tab key 
after entering the time (do not click the Next button) or PowerPoint will not apply your change.
 
3. Click Yes to accept the new slide timings.
If you want to temporarily discard the rehearsed timings, deselect the Use Timings check box on the Slide Show tab. 
This turns off all automatic timings and allows the show to advance through mouse-clicks only. To clear timings alto-
gether, choose Slide Show ➪ Record Slide Show ➪ Clear ➪ Clear Timings on All Slides.
Animating Slide Content
Whereas transitions determine how a slide (as a whole) enters the screen, animations deter-
mine what happens to the slide’s content after that point. You might animate a bulleted list 
by having each bullet point fade in one by one, for example, or you might make a picture 
gradually grow or shrink to emphasize it. The effects that you can create are limited only 
by your imagination.
Animation gives you full control over how the objects on your slides appear, move, and 
disappear. You can not only choose from the full range of animation effects for each object, 
but you can also specify in what order the objects appear and what sound is associated with 
their appearance.

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Animation: A First Look
The Animations tab provides many settings and shortcuts for creating animation events. 
An event is an animation occurrence, such as an object entering or exiting the slide. An 
event can also consist of an object on the slide moving around in some way (spinning, 
growing, changing color, and so on).
Each animation event appears as a separate entry in the Animation pane. You can display 
or hide the Animation pane by choosing Animations ➪ Advanced Animation ➪ Animation 
Pane at any time.
When you animate bulleted lists and certain other types of text groupings, the associated 
events may be collapsed or expanded in the Animation pane. For example, in Figure 16.5, 
an animated bulleted list’s events are collapsed.
Notice the following in Figure 16.5:
 
■The text box containing the bulleted list is named Rectangle 3. PowerPoint consid-
ers a text box a shape, and by default text boxes are rectangular.
 
■It has a green star on it. Green means entrance; this is an entrance effect. (Yellow 
means emphasis, and red means an exit effect.) A line instead of a star means it is 
a motion path (covered later in this chapter).
 
■It has a double down-pointing arrow below it. That indicates that there are col-
lapsed animation events beneath it.
FIGURE 16.5
The animation events for a bulleted list are collapsed.
Arrow indicates more
events are collapsed.

an entrance effect.
To assign meaningful names to slide objects so it’s easier to tell what you are working with when animating, choose 
Home ➪ Editing ➪ Select ➪ Selection Pane. Then in that pane, you can edit each object’s name.
In Figure 16.6, the events are expanded. To expand or collapse a group of events, click the 
double up-pointing or down-pointing arrow. Notice that each bulleted list item on the slide 

493

Animation pane.

Choosing an Animation Effect
There are four categories of custom animation effects. Each effect has a speciﬁ c purpose as 
well as a different icon color:
 
■Entrance (green). The item’s appearance on the slide is animated. It does not 
appear right away when the rest of the slide appears, or it appears in some unusual 
way (such as ﬂ ying or fading), or both.
 
■Emphasis (yellow). The item is already on the slide and is modiﬁ ed in some way. 
For example, it may shrink, grow, wiggle, or change color.
 
■Exit (red). The item disappears from the slide before the slide itself disappears, 
and you can specify that it does so in some unusual way.
 
■Motion Paths (gray). The item moves on the slide according to a preset path. 
Motion paths are discussed later in the chapter.
Within each of these broad categories are a multitude of animations. Although the appear-
ance of the icons may vary, the colors (on the menus from which you choose them and on 
the effects listed in the Animation pane) always match the category.
Different effect categories have different choices. For example, the Emphasis category, in 
addition to providing movement-based effects, also has effects that change the color, back-
ground, or other attributes of the object.

494
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
You can choose animation effects in any of these ways (all from the Animations tab) after 
selecting the object to be animated:
 
■Click one of the animation samples in the Animation group.
 
■Click the Add Animation button, and choose an effect from the menu that appears. 
See Figure 16.7.
 
■Click the down arrow to open the gallery in the Animation group, and choose an 
effect from the gallery that appears. (This gallery is identical to the one provided 
by the Add Animation button.) 
FIGURE 16.7
Choose an animation effect to apply.
 
■Click the Add Animation button and then choose one of the “More” commands at 
the bottom, depending on the type of animation you want. For example, you might 
want to choose More Entrance Effects. This opens a dialog box with a full listing of 
the effects of that type, shown in Figure 16.8.

495
Chapter 16: Creating Animation Effects and Transitions
16
FIGURE 16.8
The More command opens a dialog box of effects for the chosen type.
Why are there two seemingly identical menus on the Animations tab — one in the Animation gallery and one from the 
Add Animation button? If an object does not currently have any animation assigned to it, there is no difference; either 
one will work equally well. However, if the object already has an animation, you can use the Animation gallery to change 
an existing animation. Add Animation can be used to add additional animation to an object that is already animated.
Changing an Effect’s Options
After applying an animation, you can control its options with the Effect Options button on 
the Animations tab. The options that appear there depend on the effect you have chosen. 
Some effects have a direction for entrance or exit, for example.
For access to a full range of effect options, do the following:
 
1. In the Animation pane, right-click the desired animation event and choose 
Effect Options. An Effect Options dialog box opens for the chosen event. The con-
trols that appear may be different depending on the event.
 
2. On the Effect tab, use the controls provided to fine-tune the effect. For 
example, as Figure 16.9 shows, you can smooth out the start and end of the 

496
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
animation by a certain amount, set a bounce for the end, and dim the object after 
animation.
 
3. Click OK to apply the effect settings.
FIGURE 16.9
Fine-tune an effect’s options from the Effect tab of the Effect Options dialog box.
Setting Animation Timing
The timing controls for animations are located in the Timing group on the Animations tab, 
as shown in Figure 16.10.
FIGURE 16.10
Control the timing of an animation from the Timing group.
Timing group
By default, animations are set to On Click. You can instead set them to occur automatically 
by choosing one of these settings from the Start drop-down list on the Animations tab:
 
■With Previous. The animation occurs simultaneously with the start of the previous 
event in the Animation pane. If there is no previous event, the animation occurs 
simultaneously with the appearance of the slide itself.

497
Chapter 16: Creating Animation Effects and Transitions
16
 
■After Previous. The animation occurs after the previous animation event has 
ﬁ nished occurring. If there is no previous event, the animation occurs after the 
appearance of the slide itself.
The difference between those two settings is subtle because most animation events are 
very short in duration. However, if an event is set to After Previous and the previous event 
takes a long time to execute, the difference may be more noticeable.
You can also set a delay for the animation (Animations ➪ Timing ➪ Delay). This delays the 
animation’s start for a speciﬁ ed number of seconds after the previous event.
The Duration setting (Animations ➪ Timing ➪ Duration) controls the speed at which the 
animation occurs. The higher the duration setting, the slower it will execute.
For even more control over the timing, right-click the animation event in the Animation 
pane and choose Timing. Then set timing options in the dialog box that appears. All the 
same options are available as on the Animations task pane, plus a Repeat option is avail-
able that repeats the animation a certain number of times. There is also a Triggers set of 
options, which you’ll learn about in the section “Setting Animation Event Triggers” later in 
this chapter.
Another minor difference between the dialog box and the Animations tab methods is that 
for Duration, the dialog box uses a drop-down list of presets, ranging from 0.5 seconds 
(Very Fast) to 5 seconds (Very Slow). You have to select one of the presets; you can’t enter a 
precise amount. In contrast, the Duration setting on the Animations tab is a numeric text 
box in which you can enter any value you want. 
Copying Animation
The Animation Painter is a very handy feature that enables you to copy an animation 
effect from one object to another. To use it, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the object that is already animated the way you want.
 
2. Choose Animations ➪ Advanced Animation ➪ Animation Painter.  
 
3. Click the object on which to paint the animation. (You can navigate to a differ-
ent slide before doing this.) That object’s animation changes to match that of the 
object you selected in Step 1.
Special Options for Text Animation
When you are animating the text in a text box, some extra options become available, 
described in the following sections.
Changing the Grouping Level
You can choose the grouping that you want to animate. The grouping level is the detail level 
at which separate animations occur. Suppose, for example, that you have three levels of 

498
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
bullets in the text box, and you want them to be animated with each second-level bullet 
appearing separately. You can specify the second level as the animation grouping so that 
all third-level bullets appear as a group along with their associated second-level bullet.
You can change the grouping level by choosing Animations ➪ Animation ➪ Effect Options 
and then choosing one of these options:
 
■As One Object. Makes the entire content placeholder a single animation event.
 
■All At Once. Makes each paragraph a separate event, but assigns On Click to only 
the ﬁ rst one; the others are set to animate with the previous paragraph (With 
Previous), which means they occur simultaneously with the ﬁ rst one.
 
■By Paragraph. Animates each paragraph separately and assigns On Click to each 
event. This is the default.
If you have more than one level of bullets, the subordinate-level bullet points are ani-
mated along with their ﬁ rst-level parent when you use Animations ➪ Effect Options ➪ By 
Paragraph. If you want bullets that are other than ﬁ rst-level bullets to be separately ani-
mated, you must set that up in the Effect Options dialog box. Follow these steps: 
 
1. In the Animation pane, collapse the group (by clicking the double up arrow). 
Then right-click the collapsed group and choose Effect Options.
 
2. In the Effect Options dialog box, click the Text Animation tab.
 
3. Open the Group Text drop-down list and choose the level at which you want to 
group bullet points. For example, in Figure 16.11, I am grouping by second-level 
paragraphs.
FIGURE 16.11
Group by a certain level of paragraphs (bullets).
 
4. Click OK to accept the new grouping setting.

499
Chapter 16: Creating Animation Effects and Transitions
16
To animate the list in reverse order (that is, from the bottom up), mark the In Reverse 
Order check box. 
Animating Each Individual Word or Letter
By default, when a paragraph animates, it does so all at once. You can optionally instead set 
it to animate one word at a time or even one letter at a time. (Be careful with this, though; 
it gets annoying quickly!)
To set this up, do the following:
 
1. Right-click the animation event in the Animation pane and choose Effect 
Options. The Effect Options dialog box for the chosen animation type opens.
 
2. On the Effect tab, open the Animate Text drop-down list and choose a setting:
 
■All at once
 
■By word
 
■By letter
 
3. Click OK.
Removing an Animation Effect
You can remove the animation for a speciﬁ c object or remove all of the animation for the 
entire slide. When an object is not animated, it simply appears when the slide appears, 
with no delay. For example, if the title is not animated, the slide background and the title 
appear ﬁ rst, after which any animation executes for the remaining objects. To remove ani-
mation from a speciﬁ c object, do the following:
 
1. Display the Animation pane (Animations ➪ Advanced Animation ➪ Animation 
Pane).
 
2. If the object is part of a group, such as a bulleted list, then expand or col-
lapse the list, depending on the effect that you want to remove. For example, 
to remove an animation effect from an entire text box, you must ﬁ rst collapse the 
list. To remove an animation effect from only a single paragraph, such as a bulleted 
item, you must ﬁ rst expand the list.
 
3. Select the animation effect from the pane, and then press the Delete key on 
the keyboard, or right-click and choose Remove, or choose None from the 
Animation Gallery. PowerPoint removes the animation and then renumbers any 
remaining animation effects.
Assigning Multiple Animation Effects to a Single Object
Some objects might need more than one animation effect. For example, you may want an 
object to have an Entrance and an Exit effect, or you may want a bulleted list to enter one 
way and then emphasize each point in a different way.

500
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
To assign a new animation effect to an object that is already animated, just select it and 
apply another animation event to it with Animations ➪ Add Animation. You don’t have to 
do anything special to it just because it already has an animation event. (You can’t use the 
Animation Gallery to add an animation to an object that already has an animation because 
it will just change the existing event, not create a new event.)
After assigning another event to it, you may want to rearrange the order of the events; see 
the next section, “Reordering Animation Effects,” for details.
Keep in mind that the numbers that appear next to the objects on the slides when the Animations tab is displayed 
do not refer to the objects themselves — they refer to the animation events. If an object does not have any animation 
assigned to it, then it does not have a number. Conversely, if an object has more than one animation effect assigned 
to it, then it has two or more numbers.
Reordering Animation Effects
By default, animation effects are numbered in the order that you created them. To change 
this order, do the following:
 
1. On the In the Animation pane, click the effect whose position you want to 
change.
 
2. Click the Move Earlier or Move Later buttons at the top of the pane, or on the 
Animations tab, to move the position of the animation in the list. See 
Figure 16.12.
You can also drag and drop items in the animations list to rearrange them. Position the 
mouse pointer over an object so that the pointer turns into a double-headed up or down 
arrow, and then drag the object up or down in the list.
Setting Animation Event Triggers
Animation event triggers tell PowerPoint when to execute an animation. By default, an ani-
mation occurs as part of the normal animation sequence, using whatever settings you have 
assigned to it, such as On Click, With Previous, or After Previous.
When you set an animation to On Click, the click being referred to is any click. The mouse 
does not need to be pointing at anything in particular. In fact, pressing a key on the key-
board can serve the same purpose.
If you want an animation effect to occur only when you click something in particular, 
you can use a trigger to specify this condition. For example, you may have three bullet 
points on a list and three photos. If you want each bullet point to appear when you click 
its corresponding photo, you can animate each bullet point with the graphic object as its 
trigger.

You can have only one trigger for each object, and in this case, object means the entire text placeholder. Therefore, if 
you want to animate bullet points separately with separate triggers, then you need to place each of them in a sepa-
rate text box.
To set up a trigger, do the following:
 
1. On the Animation pane, click the effect whose timing trigger you want to set.
 
2. Choose Animations ➪ Advanced Animation ➪ Trigger ➪ On Click Of and then 
click the object that should be used as the trigger for that event. See Figure 16.13.
FIGURE 16.13

Here’s an alternative method:
 
1. On the Animation pane, right-click the effect whose timing you want to set 
and choose Timing. The Animation dialog window appears with the timing tab 
selected.
 
2. If the Triggers controls do not already appear, Click the Triggers button. The 
controls for setting up a trigger appear on the Timing tab, as shown in Figure 16.14.
FIGURE 16.14
You can also set up a trigger via the Timing tab.
 
3. Select the Start Effect on Click Of option, and then open the drop-down list 
and select an object. All of the objects on the slide appear in this list.
 
4. Click OK.
Do not trigger the entrance of an object on click of itself or there will be no way to make it appear.
Associating Sounds with Animations
You learned about sounds in Chapter 14, “Adding Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks,” 
including how to associate a sound with an object. However, associating a sound with an 
animation effect is different because the sound plays when the animation occurs, not nec-
essarily when the object appears or is clicked. By default, animation effects do not have 
sounds assigned, but you can assign a sound by doing the following:
 
1. In the Animation pane, select the animation effect to which you want to 
assign a sound. Then open the drop-down list for the effect, and choose Effect 
Options.

503
Chapter 16: Creating Animation Effects and Transitions
16
 
2. On the Effect tab (see Figure 16.15), open the Sound drop-down list and choose 
a sound. You can choose any of the sounds in the list, or you can choose Other 
Sound to select a sound ﬁ le from another location. (Only WAV ﬁ les can be used 
for this.) 
FIGURE 16.15
Choose a sound to be associated with the animation.
OR 
To make a previously playing sound stop when this animation occurs, choose Stop 
Previous Sound from the Sound drop-down list.
 
3. Click OK. 
Making an Object Appear Differently after Animation
After an object has been animated, you might want to have it appear differently on the 
slide. For example, after some text animates, you might want it to be dimmed. To set this 
up, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Animation pane, select the animation effect. Then open the drop-down 
list for the effect, and choose Effect Options.
 
2. Open the After Animation drop-down list and choose one of the following 
options, as shown in Figure 16.16: 
 
■A theme color. You can choose one of the colored squares, which represent each 
of the current theme colors.
 
■Don’t Dim. This is the default setting; it speciﬁ es that PowerPoint should do 
nothing to the object after animation.
 
■Hide After Animation. This setting makes the object disappear immediately 
after the animation ﬁ nishes.

504
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
 
■Hide on Next Mouse Click. This setting makes the object disappear when you 
click the mouse after the animation has completed. For example, this is useful 
for showing and then hiding individual bullet points.
FIGURE 16.16
You can choose a color for the object after animation or specify that it should be 
hidden afterward.
 
3. Click OK.
Working with Motion Paths
Motion paths enable you to make an object ﬂ y onto or off of the slide and also make it ﬂ y 
around on the slide in a particular motion path! For example, suppose you are showing a 
map on a slide and you want to graphically illustrate the route that you took when travel-
ing in the area represented on the map. You could create a little square, circle, or other 
AutoShape to represent yourself and then set up a custom motion path for the shape that 
traces your route on the map.
Using a Preset Motion Path
PowerPoint comes with dozens of motion paths, in every shape that you can imagine. To 
choose one of them for an object, follow these steps:
 
1. On the slide, click the object that you want to animate, and then choose 
Animations ➪ Advanced Animation ➪ Add Animation and then either scroll 
down to the bottom and click one of the paths on the list or choose More 
Motion Paths. 
 
2. If you choose More Motion Paths, the Add Motion Path dialog box appears 
(Figure 16.17). Click the path that you want.

clearly.
 
3. Click OK. The motion path appears on the slide, adjacent to the object. A green 
circle or arrow shows where the object will begin, and a dotted line shows the path 
that it will take, as shown in Figure 16.18. A red circle or arrow shows where the 
path ends. If it’s a closed path, you will only see the green circle or arrow.

Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
At this point, you have a wide variety of options you can change: 
 
■To change the starting point for the motion path, drag the green circle or arrow.
 
■To change the ending point, drag the red circle or arrow.
 
■You can change any of the settings for the motion path, just as you would for 
any other custom animation: 
 
■Change the Duration setting. The default is 2 seconds.
 
■Change the Start setting. The default is On Click.
 
■Change the path’s timing or effects.
 
4. Choose Animations ➪ Animation ➪ Effect Options and select any of the fol-
lowing options: Unlocked/Locked. If the path is unlocked and you move the 
animated object on the slide, the path repositions itself with the object; if the path 
is locked, then it stays in the same place, even when you move the object on the 
slide. You can toggle these two options.
 
■Edit Points. This option enables you to change the motion path and is discussed 
in the next section, “Editing a Motion Path.”
 
■Reverse Path Direction. This option does just what it says: It makes the anima-
tion run in the opposite direction.
 
5. Click OK. 
If the Effect Options button on the Animations tab is not available, make sure the motion 
path is selected (not the animated object).
There are even more effect options available. To see them, right-click the animation in the 
Animation pane and choose Effect Options to open a dialog box for the effect. On the Effect 
tab (Figure 16.19), do any of the following:
 
■Set the Path to Locked or Unlocked. (This is the same as described in step 4.)
 
■Assign a number of seconds to Smooth Start, Smooth End, and/or Bounce End to 
ﬁ ne-tune how the animation begins and ends. 
 
■Mark the Auto-Reverse check box to make the animation reverse itself after execut-
ing so the shape ends up back where it started. (This is not the same thing as 
Reverse Path Direction in step 4. Reverse Path Direction makes the path run back-
ward; Auto-Reverse makes it run forward and then backward.)
 
■Associate a sound with the animation.
Editing a Motion Path
You can move the motion path by dragging it or by nudging it with the arrow keys, as you 
would any object.
You can resize or reshape the motion path by dragging its selection handles (the circles 
around its frame); this is just like resizing any other object. To rotate the motion path, 

507
Chapter 16: Creating Animation Effects and Transitions
16
drag the rotation handle at the top of the path; this is just like rotating any other 
object.
FIGURE 16.19
Set motion path options.
You can also modify the motion path manually by editing its points. A motion path consists 
of anchor points with straight lines or curves between them. These points are normally 
invisible, but you can also display them and change them.
To edit a motion path, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the motion path on the slide (not the object itself).
 
2. Choose Animations ➪ Animation ➪ Effect Options ➪ Edit Points. (You can also 
right-click the path and choose Edit Points.) Small black squares appear around the 
path.
You can’t edit the points on a straight line motion path because it doesn’t have any points other than the starting and 
ending points.
 
3. Click one of the black squares; a slightly larger white square appears near it. 
A line with white squares on either end of the segment is a curve. These white 
squares are handles that you can drag to modify the point. You can also drag the 
black square itself; either way will work, although each method affects the path 
differently. For example, dragging the black square moves the point itself, whereas 
dragging the handle repositions the curve and leaves the point in place.
 
4. Drag a square to change the path, as in Figure 16.20.

508
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 16.20
You can edit a motion path by dragging the black or white squares that represent its 
anchor points.
 
5. When you are finished editing the path, choose 
Animations ➪ Animation ➪ Effect Options ➪ Edit Points again, or press Esc, or 
click away from the path, to turn the editing feature off.
Drawing a Custom Motion Path
If none of the motion paths suit your needs, or if you cannot easily edit them to the way 
you want, you can create your own motion path.  
A custom motion path works best for paths that consist of one or more straight line segments; if you want a 
curved motion path, you are better off starting with one of the motion path presets and then editing its points to 
customize it.
To draw a custom motion path for an object, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the object that you want to animate on the slide.
 
2. Choose Animations ➪ Advanced Animation ➪ Add Animation and then click 
Custom Path from the bottom of the menu.
 
3. Drag to draw the path on the slide. Here are some hints: 
 
■For a line, click at the starting point and then click again at the ending point. The 
starting point will have a green arrow, and the ending point will have a red one.
 
■For a series of straight line segments, click for each anchor point that you 
want; straight lines will appear between the anchor points. You can also click 
and drag to create non-straight lines. Double-click when you are ﬁ nished.
 
■For a scribble, draw on the slide with the mouse button held down. Double-click 
when you are ﬁ nished.
 
4. After drawing the path, edit and fine-tune it as you would any other motion 
path. 
Animating Parts of a Chart
If you create a chart using PowerPoint’s charting tool, then you can display the chart all 
at once or apply a custom animation effect to it. For example, you can make the chart 
appear by series (divided by legend entries), by category (divided by X-axis points), or by 

509
Chapter 16: Creating Animation Effects and Transitions
16
individual element in a series or category. Figure 16.21 and Figure 16.22 show progressions 
based on series and category.
FIGURE 16.21
In this progression, the chart is appearing by series.

510
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
FIGURE 16.22
Here, the chart is appearing by category.
Along with making various parts of the chart appear at different times, you can also make 
them appear using any of the animated techniques that you have already learned, such as 
ﬂ ying in, dropping in, fading in, and so on. You can also associate sounds with the parts 
and dim them or change them to various colors when the animation is ﬁ nished.
To animate a chart, you must ﬁ rst set up the entire chart to be animated, just as you would 
any other object on a slide.
Then, to set up the chart so that different parts of it are animated separately, do the 
following:
 
1. Choose Animations ➪ Animation ➪ Effect Options and then choose any of the 
following options from the Sequence section of the menu (see Figure 16.23): 
 
■As One Object. The entire chart is animated as a single object.
 
■By Series. In a multiseries chart, all of series 1 enters at once (all the bars of 
one color), then all of series 2 enters at once, and so on. This option doesn’t 
appear for a single-series chart.

511
Chapter 16: Creating Animation Effects and Transitions
16
 
■By Category. All the bars for the ﬁ rst category appear at once (an entire group-
ing of multicolored bars), then the second category’s bars, and so on.
 
■By Element in Series. Each data point is animated separately, in this order: 
each point (from bottom to top or left to right) in series 1, then each point in 
series 2, and so on. This option does not appear unless you have more than one 
category and series.
 
■By Element in Category. Each data point is animated separately, in this order: 
each point (from bottom to top or left to right) in category 1, then each point 
in category 2, and so on. This option does not appear unless you have more than 
one category and series.
FIGURE 16.23
You can animate the chart by series, by category, or by individual data points.
You can also set up chart animation from the Effect Options dialog box. Collapse the chart’s 
animation in the Animation pane (if needed), and then right-click it and choose Effect 
Options. In the dialog box that appears, click the Chart Animation tab, and make your 
selection there. The choices are exactly the same as on the menu (Figure 16.23), plus there 
is one additional check box: Start Animation by Drawing the Chart Background, which is on 
by default. It animates the grid and legend. If you deselect this option, these items appear 
immediately on the slide, and the data bars, slices, or other chart elements appear sepa-
rately from them. 
You do not have to use the same animation effect for each category or each series of the 
chart. After you set up the chart to animate each piece individually, individual entries 
appear for each piece on the list in the Animation pane. You can expand this list and then 
apply individual settings to each piece. For example, you could have some data bars on a 
chart ﬂ y in from one direction, and other data bars ﬂ y in from another direction. You can 
also reorder the pieces so that the data points build in a different order from the default 
order. 

512
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
Not all animation effects are available for every type of chart and every series or category animation. If a particular 
animation is not working, try a simpler one, such as Fade or Wipe.
Controlling Animation Timing with the Advanced Timeline
The animation timeline is a graphical representation of how animated content will appear 
on the slide. The timeline is also covered in Chapter 14, in the discussion about sounds and 
soundtracks. It is on by default. If you don’t see it, right-click any animation event in the 
Animation pane and choose Show Advanced Timeline. 
The timeline is useful because it can tell you the total time involved in all of the anima-
tions that you have set up, including any delays that you have built in. Figure 16.24 shows 
a timeline for a chart that is animated by category, in which each event is set to occur to 
occur after the previous one (After Previous).
FIGURE 16.24
The advanced timeline shows how much time is allotted to each animated element on the 
slide.
Timeline provides
a point of reference
for the bars above.
Green bars represent
the amount of time each
animation event takes.

513
Chapter 16: Creating Animation Effects and Transitions
16
For events that are set to On Click, the advanced timeline shows them to be occurring 
simultaneously, but this is not really true; they are just not time-sequenced with one 
another in the same way that events set to With Previous or After Previous are. 
Notice also the Seconds button at the bottom in Figure 16.24. It opens a menu from which 
you can zoom in and zoom out on the timeline.
You can also use the timeline to create delays between animations and to increase the 
duration of individual animations. To increase the duration of an item, you can drag the 
right side of the bar representing its length in the Animation pane. Drag the left side of 
the bar to create a delay between animations. When you drag the bar for an item that is set 
to After Previous, the other bars also move. However, when you drag the bar for an item 
that is set to With Previous, PowerPoint allows an overlap.
Animation Tips
Here are some tips for using animation in your own work:
 
■Try to use the same animation effect for each slide in a related series of slides. If 
you want to differentiate one section of the presentation from another, use a dif-
ferent animation effect for the text in each different section.
 
■If you want to discuss only one bullet point at a time on a slide, set the others to 
dim or change to a lighter color after animation.
 
■If you want to obscure an element but you cannot make the animation settings do 
it the way you want, consider using a shape that is set to the same color ﬁ ll as your 
background color and that has no outside border. This shape will appear “invisible” 
but will obscure whatever is behind it.
 
■Animate a chart based on the way you want to lead your audience through the 
data. For example, if each series on your chart shows the sales for a different divi-
sion and you want to compare one division to another, you can animate by series. 
If you want to talk about the results of that chart over time rather than by divi-
sion, you can animate by category instead.
 
■If you want to create your own moving graphic but you do not have access to a pro-
gram that creates animated GIFs, you can build a very simple animation on a slide. 
Simply create the frames of the animation — three or more drawings that you want 
to progress through in quick succession. Then, lay them one on top of another on 
the slide and set the timings so that they play in order. You can adjust the delays 
and repeats as needed.
Layering Animated Objects
Part of the challenge of animation is in deciding which objects should appear and disappear 
and in what order. Theoretically, you could layer all of the objects for every slide in the entire 
presentation on a single slide and use animation to make them appear and disappear on cue. 

514
Part II: Using Graphics and Multimedia Content
If you are thinking about creating complex layers of animation where some objects disappear and are replaced by 
other objects on the same slide, step back and consider whether it would be easier to simply use two or more sepa-
rate slides. When there is no delay or animation defi ned in the transition between two slides (if their content is iden-
tical or very similar), the effect is virtually identical to that of layered, animated objects — with much less time and 
effort required to set them up.
You can use layering when you want part of a slide to change while the rest of it remains 
static. For example, you could create your own animated series of illustrations by stacking 
several photos and then animating them so that the bottom one appears, then the next 
one on top of it, and so on. This can provide a rough simulation of motion video from stills, 
much like ﬂ ipping through illustrations in the corners of a stack of pages. You can set the 
animation speeds and delays between clips as needed to achieve the effect you want.
When you stack objects, the new object that is placed on top of the old object obscures 
it, so it is not necessary to include an exit action for the old object. However, if the item 
being placed on top is smaller than the one beneath, then you need to set up an exit effect 
for the object beneath and have it occur concurrently (that is, With Previous) with the 
entrance of the new one. For example, suppose that you want to place a photo on the right 
side of a slide and some explanatory text for it on the left, and then you want to replace 
these elements with a different photo and different text, as shown in Figure 16.25. At the 
back of this book in Lab 2, “Adding Sound and Movement to a Presentation,” you’ll learn 
step-by-step how to set up this type of animation sequence.
FIGURE 16.25
Although these fi gures look like two separate slides, they are actually a single slide at two 
different points in the animation sequence.
To set up this animation to occur on the same slide, you would place the content that 
should appear ﬁ rst and then apply exit effects to it. For example, set the initial photo to 

515
Chapter 16: Creating Animation Effects and Transitions
16
On Click for its exit trigger, which will make it disappear when you click the mouse. Set its 
associated text box to With Previous and have it animate immediately after this photo so 
that the text box disappears at the same time as the photo.
Next, place the other text box and other picture over the top of the ﬁ rst items. In Normal 
view, it looks like each spot has both a picture and a text box. You must now animate the 
new text box and the new picture with entrance effects that are set to With Previous so 
that both will appear at the same time the other two items are exiting. They all have the 
same animation number because they all occur simultaneously.
To preview animation effects while remaining in Normal view, click the Preview button on 
the Animations tab. To preview an animation sequence on a slide from a certain animation 
effect forward, select that animation effect in the Animation Pane and then click the Play 
From button on the Animation Pane.
It is always a good idea to preview animation effects in Slide Show view after creating 
them. To do this, choose Slide Show ➪ Start Slide Show ➪ From Current Slide. When you 
have ﬁ nished checking the effects, press Esc to return to PowerPoint. 
Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to animate the objects on your slides to create some great 
special effects and how to create animated transitions from slide to slide. You can specify 
sounds, speeds, and timing for effects and layer effects to occur sequentially or simulta-
neously. Use this newfound knowledge for good, not evil! In other words, do not apply so 
many animations that your audience focuses more on the effects than on your message. 
If you would like more practice with these effects, work through Lab 2 at the end of this 
book.
In the next chapter, you’ll learn how to create support materials such as handouts and 
speaker notes for a presentation and how to format and ﬁ ne-tune their formatting.

f you are presenting a live show, the centerpiece of your presentation is your slides. Whether 
you show them using a computer screen, a slide projector, or an overhead projector, the slides—
combined with your own dazzling personality—make the biggest impact. But if you rely on your 
audience to remember everything you say, you may be disappointed. With handouts, the audience 
members can follow along with you during the show and even take their own notes. They can then 
take the handouts home with them to review the information later.
You probably want a different set of support materials for yourself than you want for the audience. 
Support materials designed for the speaker’s use are called speaker notes. In addition to small print-
outs of the slides, the speaker notes contain any extra notes or background information that you 
think you may need to jog your memory as you speak. Some people get very nervous when they speak 
in front of a crowd; speaker notes can remind you of the joke you wanted to open with or the exact 
ﬁ gures behind a particular pie chart.
The When and How of Handouts
Presentation professionals are divided about how and when to use handouts most effectively. Here 
are some of the many conﬂ icting viewpoints. I can’t say who is right or wrong, but each of these 
statements brings up issues that you should consider. The bottom line is that each of them is an 
opinion on how much power and credit to give to the audience; your answer may vary depending 
on the audience you are addressing.
 
■You should give handouts at the beginning of the presentation. The audience can 
absorb the information better if they can follow along on paper. 
This approach makes a lot of sense. Research has proven that people absorb more facts if 
presented with them in more than one medium. This approach also gives your audience free 

520
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
will; they can listen to you or not, and they still have the information. It’s their 
choice, and this can be extremely scary for less-conﬁ dent speakers. It’s not just a 
speaker conﬁ dence issue in some cases, however. If you plan to give a lot of extra 
information in your speech that’s not on the handouts, people might miss it if you 
distribute the handouts at the beginning because they’re reading ahead. 
 
■You shouldn’t give the audience handouts because they won’t pay as close 
attention to your speech if they know that the information is already written 
down for them. 
This philosophy falls at the other end of the spectrum. It gives the audience the 
least power and shows the least conﬁ dence in their ability to pay attention to you 
in the presence of a distraction (handouts). If you truly don’t trust your audience 
to be professional and listen, this approach may be your best option. However, 
don’t let insecurity as a speaker drive you prematurely to this conclusion. The fact 
is that people won’t take away as much knowledge about the topic without hand-
outs as they would if you provide handouts. So, ask yourself if your ultimate goal is 
to ﬁ ll the audience with knowledge or to make them pay attention to you.
 
■You should give handouts at the end of the presentation so that people will 
have the information to take home but not be distracted during the speech. 
This approach attempts to solve the dilemma with compromise. The trouble with it, 
as with all compromises, is that it does an incomplete job from both angles. Because 
audience members can’t follow along on the handouts during the presentation, 
they miss the opportunity to jot notes on the handouts. And because the audience 
knows that handouts are coming, they might nod off and miss something impor-
tant. The other problem is that if you don’t clearly tell people that handouts are 
coming later, some people spend the entire presentation frantically copying down 
each slide on their own notepaper.
Creating Handouts
To create handouts, you simply decide on a layout (a number of slides per page) and then 
choose that layout from the Print dialog box as you print. No muss, no fuss! If you want to 
get more involved, you can edit the layout in Handout Master view before printing.
Choosing a Layout
Assuming you have decided that handouts are appropriate for your speech, you must decide 
on the format for them. You have a choice of one, two, three, four, six, or nine slides per 
page. 
 
■1 Slide. Places a single slide vertically and horizontally “centered” on the page.
 
■2 Slides. Prints two big slides on each page. This layout is good for slides that have 
a lot of ﬁ ne print and small details or for situations in which you are not conﬁ dent 

521
Chapter 17: Creating Support Materials
17
that the reproduction quality will be good. There is nothing more frustrating for an 
audience than not being able to read the handouts!
 
■3 Slides. Makes the slides much smaller—less than one-half the size of the ones in 
the two-slide layout. But you get a nice bonus with this layout: lines to the side of 
each slide for note-taking. This layout works well for presentations with slides that 
are big and simple and the speaker is providing a lot of extra information that isn’t 
on the slides. The audience members can write the extra information in the note-
taking space provided.
 
■4 Slides. Uses the same size slides as the three-slide layout, but they are spaced out 
two-by-two without note-taking lines. However, there is still plenty of room above 
and below each slide, so the audience members still have lots of room to take notes. 
The four-, six-, and nine-slide handout layouts come in two varieties: vertical and horizontal. This does not refer to the 
orientation of the slides or the paper but rather to the order in which the slides appear. A vertical layout runs the fi rst 
slide in the top-left corner, the second slide below that, and so on so that slides are ordered in vertical columns. A 
horizontal layout, in contrast, places the fi rst slide in the top-left corner and the second slide to its right, running the 
slides in horizontal rows. Horizontal ordering is more common in the United States and Europe; vertical ordering is 
more common in Asia.
 
■6 Slides. Uses slides the same size as the three-slide and four-slide layouts, but 
crams more slides on the page at the expense of note-taking space. This layout is 
good for presentations with big, simple slides where the audience does not need to 
take notes. If you are not sure if the audience will beneﬁ t at all from handouts being 
distributed, consider whether this layout would be a good compromise. This format 
also saves paper, which might be an issue if you need to make hundreds of copies.
 
■9 Slides. Makes the slides very tiny, almost like a Slide Sorter view, so that you 
can see nine at a time. This layout makes them very hard to read unless the slide 
text is extremely simple. I don’t recommend this layout in most cases because the 
audience really won’t get much out of such handouts.
One good use for the nine-slide model is as an index or table of contents for a large presentation. You can include a 
nine-slides-per-page version of the handouts at the beginning of the packet that you give to the audience members 
and then follow it up with a two-slides-per-page version that they can refer to if they want a closer look at one of the 
slides.
Finally, there is an Outline handout layout, which prints an outline of all of the text in 
your presentation—that is, all of the text that is part of placeholders in slide layouts; any 
text in extra text boxes you have added manually is excluded. It is not considered a hand-
out when you are printing, but it is included with the handout layouts in the handout mas-
ter. More on this type of handout later in the chapter. 

522
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Printing Handouts
When you have decided which layout is appropriate for your needs, print your handouts as 
follows:
 
1. (Optional) If you want to print only one particular slide or a group of slides, 
select the slide or slides you want in either Slide Sorter view or in the slide 
thumbnails task pane on the left.
 
2. Select File ➪ Print. The Print options appear.
 
3. Enter a number of copies in the Copies text box. The default is 1. If you want the 
copies collated (applicable to multipage printouts only), make sure you mark the 
Collate check box.
 
4. Set options for your printer or choose a different printer. See the section 
“Setting Printer-Speciﬁ c Options” later in this chapter for help with this.
 
5. If you do not want to print all the slides, type the slide numbers that you want 
into the Slides box. Indicate a contiguous range with a dash. For example, to print 
slides 1 through 9, type 1-9. Indicate noncontiguous slides with commas. For example, 
to print slides 2, 4, and 6, type 2, 4, 6. Or to print slides 2 plus 6 through 10, type 2, 
6-10. To print them in reverse order, type them in reverse order, such as 10-6, 2. 
Alternatively, you can click Print All Slides to open a menu of range choices and 
choose one of these from its list: 
 
■Print Selection to print multiple slides you selected before you issued the Print 
command. It is not available if you did not select any slides beforehand.
 
■Print Current Slide to print whatever slide you selected before you issued the 
Print command.
 
■Custom Range to print the slides whose numbers you type in the Slides text 
box. When you enter slide numbers in the Slides text box, this option gets 
selected automatically, so usually you don’t have to select this option manually.
 
■Custom Show to print a certain custom show you have set up. Each custom 
show you have created appears on the list. You won’t see this option if you 
haven’t created any.
 
6. (Optional) Hidden slides are printed by default. If you don’t want to print hid-
den slides, click the same button again to reopen the menu and click Print Hidden 
Slides to toggle the check mark off next to that command. 
 
7. Click Full Page Slides to open a menu of views you can print.
 
8. On the menu that appears, click the number and layout of handouts you want. 
See Figure 17.1.
You can choose in step 8 to print an outline if you prefer. An outline can be a useful handout for an audience in 
certain situations.

Choose which handout layout you want.
Separate layouts for vertical
and horizontal slide ordering
 
9. (Optional) Click the Color button and select the color setting for the printouts: 
 
■Color. This is the default. It sends the data to the printer assuming that color 
will be used. When you use this setting with a black-and-white printer, it results 
in slides with grayscale or black backgrounds. Use this setting if you want the 
handouts to look as much as possible like the on-screen slides.
 
■Grayscale. Sends the data to the printer assuming that color will not be used. 
Colored backgrounds are removed, and if text is normally a light color on a dark 
background, that is reversed. Use this setting if you want PowerPoint to opti-
mize the printout for viewing on white paper.
 
■Pure Black and White. This format hides most shadows and patterns, as 
described in Table 17.1. It’s good for faxes and overhead transparencies.

or Pure Black and White. If you see an object that is not displaying the way you want, right-click it and choose 
Grayscale or Black and White. One of the options there may help you achieve the look you’re after.
 
10. (Optional) If desired, open the drop-down list from which you chose the hand-
out layout and select any of these additional options: 
 
■Frame Slides. Draws a black border around each slide image. Useful for slides 
being printed with white backgrounds.
 
■Scale to Fit Paper. Enlarges the slides to the maximum size they can be and 
still ﬁ t on the layout (as deﬁ ned in the handout master, covered later in this 
chapter).
 
■High Quality. Optimizes the appearance of the printout in small ways, such as 
allowing text shadows to print.
 
■Print Comments and Ink Markup. Prints any comments that you have inserted 
with the Comments feature in PowerPoint (covered in Chapter 21, “Sharing and 
Collaborating”). 
 
11. Check the preview of your handouts, which appears at the right. Make any nec-

12. Click Print. The handouts print, and you’re ready to roll!
Be aware of the cost of printer supplies. If you are planning to distribute copies of the presentation to a lot of people, 
it may be tempting to print all of the copies on your printer. But the cost per page of printing is fairly high, especially 
if you have an inkjet printer. You will quickly run out of ink in your ink cartridge and have to spend $20 or more for a 
replacement. Consider whether it might be cheaper to print one original and take it to a copy shop.

Setting Printer-Specifi c Options
In addition to the Print settings in PowerPoint that you learned about in the preceding sec-
tion, there are controls you can set that affect the printer you have chosen.
A printer’s name appears under the Printer heading on the Print screen in Backstage view. 
Click that printer’s name to open a menu of additional printers you can select instead. 
These are the printers installed on your PC (either local or network).
Some of the “printers” listed are not really physical printers but drivers that create other types of fi les. For example, 
Fax saves a copy of the fi le in a format that is compatible with the fax driver included in Windows. It doesn’t produce 
a hard copy printout.
After selecting the desired printer, click the Printer Properties hyperlink beneath the name. 
A Properties dialog box opens that is speciﬁ c to that printer. Figure 17.2 shows the box for 
my Brother MFC-9320CW printer, an all-in-one laser. Notice that there are two tabs: Layout 
and Paper/Quality. The tabs may be different for your printer. For some printers, more set-
tings are available if you click an Advanced button; when you click the Advanced button 
shown in Figure 17.2, for example, the Advanced Options dialog box in Figure 17.3 appears. 
FIGURE 17.2
Each printer’s options are slightly different, but the same types of settings are available for 
most printers.

526
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
FIGURE 17.3
Some printers show more options in an Advanced Options dialog box (or similar).
These settings affect how the printer behaves in all Windows-based programs, not just in 
PowerPoint, so you need to be careful not to change anything that you don’t want globally 
changed. Here are some of the settings you may be able to change on your printer (not all 
of these are shown in Figure 17.2 and Figure 17.3):
 
■Paper Size. The default is Letter, but you can change to Legal, A4, or any of several 
other sizes.
 
■Paper Source. If your printer has more than one paper tray, you may be able to 
select Upper or Lower.
 
■Media or Paper Type. Some printers print at different resolutions or with different 
settings depending on the type of paper (for example, photo paper versus regular 
paper). You can choose the type of paper you are printing on.
 
■Print Quality. Some printers give you a choice of quality levels, such as Draft, 
Normal, and Best. Draft is the quickest; Best is the slowest and may use more ink.
 
■Duplex or Print on Both Sides. Some printers enable you to print on both sides of 
the paper. Some printers ﬂ ip the paper over automatically but most prompt you to 
ﬂ ip it over manually.
 
■Orientation. You can choose between Portrait and Landscape. It’s not recommended 
that you change this setting here, though; make such changes in the Page Setup 

527
Chapter 17: Creating Support Materials
17
dialog box in PowerPoint instead. Otherwise, you may get the wrong orientation on 
a printout in other programs.
 
■Page Order. You can choose Front to Back or Back to Front. This determines the 
order in which the pages print.
 
■Pages per Sheet. The default is 1, but you can print smaller versions of several 
pages on a single sheet. This option is usually only available on PostScript printers.
 
■Copies. This sets the default number of copies that should print. Be careful; this 
number is a multiplier. If you set two copies here and then set two copies in the 
Print dialog box in PowerPoint, you end up with four copies.
 
■Graphics Resolution. If your printer has a range of resolutions available, you may 
be able to choose the resolution you want. For example, a laser printer might have 
you choose between 300 and 1,200 dots per inch (dpi); on an inkjet printer, choices 
are usually 360, 720, and 1,440 dpi. Achieving a resolution of 1,440 on an inkjet 
printer usually requires special glossy paper.
 
■Graphic Dithering. On some printers, you can set the type of dithering that makes 
up images. Dithering is a method of creating shadows (shades of gray) from black 
ink by using tiny crosshatch patterns. You may be able to choose between Coarse, 
Fine, and None.
 
■Image Intensity. On some printers, you can control the image appearance with a 
light/dark slide bar.
Some printers, notably inkjets, come with their own print-management software. If that’s 
the case, you may have to run that print-management software separately from outside of 
PowerPoint for full control over the printer’s settings. You can usually access such software 
from the Windows Start menu.
Using the Handout Master
Just as the slide master controls your slide layout, the handout master controls your hand-
out layout. To view the handout master, as shown in Figure 17.4, click Handout Master on 
the View tab. Unlike the slide master and title master, you can have only one handout mas-
ter layout per presentation. 
You can do almost exactly the same things with the handout master that you can with the 
slide master. The following sections describe some of the common activities.
Setting the Number of Slides per Page
You can view the handout master with various numbers of slides per page to help you see 
how the layout will look when you print it. The settings you can change apply to all the 
layouts. For example, if you apply a header or footer or a page background for a three-
slides-per-page layout, it also applies the four-slides-per-page layout as well as all the 
others. To choose the number of slides per page to display as you work with the handout 
master, click the Slides per Page button and then make your selection from its menu. See 
Figure 17.5.

529
Chapter 17: Creating Support Materials
17
Using and Positioning Placeholders
The handout master has four placeholders by default: Header, Footer, Date, and Page 
Number, in the four corners of the handout respectively:
 
■Header. Appears in the upper-left corner and is a blank box into which you can 
type ﬁ xed text that will appear on each page of the printout.
 
■Footer. Same thing as Header but appears in the lower-left corner.
 
■Date. Appears in the upper-right corner and shows today’s date by default.
 
■Page Number. Appears in the lower-right corner and shows a code for a page 
number, <#>. This will be replaced by an actual page number when you print.
In each placeholder box, you can type text (replacing, if desired, the Date and Page codes 
already there). You can also drag the placeholder boxes around on the layout.
There are two ways to remove the default placeholders from the layout. You select the 
placeholder box and press Delete, or you can clear the check box for that element on the 
Handout Master tab, as shown in Figure 17.6.
FIGURE 17.6
Turn on/off placeholder elements from the Handout Master tab.
Mark or clear check boxes for placeholders.
Because the header and footer are blank by default, there is no advantage to deleting these placeholders unless they 
have something in them you want to dispose of; having a blank box and having no box at all have the same result.
You can’t move or resize the slide placeholder boxes on the handout master, nor can you change the handout mas-
ter’s margins. If you want to change the size of the slide boxes on the handout or change the margins of the page, 
consider exporting the handouts to Word and working on them there. See the section “Exporting Handouts or Notes 
Pages to Word” at the end of this chapter for more information.

530
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Setting Handout and Slide Orientation
Orientation refers to the direction on the page the material runs. If the top of the paper 
is one of the narrow edges, it’s called Portrait; if the top of the paper is a wide edge, it’s 
Landscape. Figure 17.7 shows the difference in handout orientation. To change this setting, 
on the Handout Master tab, click Handout Orientation.
FIGURE 17.7
Portrait (left) and Landscape (right) handout orientation.
You can also set the slide size, either the Widescreen setting (16:9) or the Standard setting 
(4:3). PowerPoint 2013 defaults to Widescreen, both for the slides themselves and for the 
slide images on the handouts. To adjust this setting, on the Handout Master tab, click Slide 
Size and make your selection of Standard or Widescreen, or click Custom Slide Size to open 
the Slide Size dialog box and set a custom height and width. See Figure 17.8.
FIGURE 17.8
You can set any slide size and orientation combination in the Slide Size dialog box.

531
Chapter 17: Creating Support Materials
17
In the Slide Size dialog box, shown in Figure 17.8, you can also set a slide orientation. This 
is different from the orientation of the handout as a whole. The default slide orientation is 
landscape; setting the slide orientation to Portrait results in a layout like the one on the 
right in Figure 17.9. If you choose such a slide layout, PowerPoint prompts you to specify 
whether slide content should be sized to ﬁ t the new layout on the handouts or cropped. 
FIGURE 17.9
Landscape (left) and Portrait (right) slide orientation.
Formatting Handouts
You can manually format any text on a handout layout using the formatting controls on 
the Home tab, the same as with any other text. Such formatting affects only the text you 
select and only on the layout you’re working with. You can also select the entire place-
holder box and apply formatting.
You can also apply Colors, Fonts, and/or Effects schemes from the Edit Theme group, as 
shown in Figure 17.10, much as you can do for the presentation as a whole. The main differ-
ence is that you cannot select an overall theme from the Themes button; all the themes are 
unavailable from the list while in Handout Master view. The settings you apply here affect 
only the handouts, not the presentation as a whole.

532
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
FIGURE 17.10
Apply color, font, and/or effect schemes from the Edit Theme group.
You probably won’t have much occasion to apply an Effects scheme to a handout layout because handouts do not 
usually have objects that use effects (i.e., drawn shapes, charts, or SmartArt diagrams).
Creating Speaker Notes
Speaker notes are like handouts, but for you. Only one printout format is available for 
them: the Notes Pages layout. It consists of the slide on the top half (the same size as in 
the two-slides-per-page handout) with the blank space below it for your notes to yourself.
Speaker notes printed in PowerPoint are better than traditional note cards for several rea-
sons. For one thing, you can type your notes right into the computer and print them out on 
regular paper. There’s no need to jam a note card into a typewriter and use messy correc-
tion ﬂ uid or erasers to make changes. The other beneﬁ t is that each notes page contains a 
picture of the slide, so it’s not as easy to lose your place while speaking when compared to 
using traditional note cards.

533
Chapter 17: Creating Support Materials
17
Typing Speaker Notes
You can type your notes for a slide in Normal view (in the Notes pane) or in Notes Page 
view. The latter shows the page more or less as it will look when you print your notes pages; 
this can help if you need to gauge how much text will ﬁ t on the printed page.
To switch to Notes Page view, on the View tab click Notes Page as shown in Figure 17.11. 
Unlike with some of the other views, there is no shortcut button for this view in the bot-
tom-right corner of the PowerPoint window. Once you’re in Notes Page view, you can zoom 
and scroll just like in any other view to see more or less of the page at once. You can scroll 
further to move from slide to slide, or you can move from slide to slide in the traditional 
ways (the Page Up and Page Down keys on the keyboard or the Next Slide or Previous Slide 
buttons on-screen).
FIGURE 17.11
Notes Page view is one of the best ways to work with your speaker notes.
Use the Zoom control to zoom in or out until you fi nd the optimal view so that the text you type is large enough to be 
clear, but small enough so that you can see across the entire width of the note area. I fi nd that 100 percent works 
well on my screen, but yours may vary.

534
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Just type your notes in the Notes area, the same as you would type in any text box in 
PowerPoint. The lines in the paragraph wrap automatically. Press Enter to start a new para-
graph. When you’re done, move to the next slide.
Changing the Notes Page Layout
Just as you can edit your handout layouts, you can also edit your notes page layout. Just 
switch to its master and make your changes. Follow these steps:
 
1. On the View tab, click Notes Master.
 
2. Edit the layout, as you have learned to edit other masters. See Figure 17.12. This 
can include the following actions: 
FIGURE 17.12
You can edit the layout of the notes pages in Notes Master view.
 
■Moving placeholders for the slide, the notes, or any of the header or footer 
elements
 
■Changing the font used for the text in any of those areas
 
■Resizing the placeholder for the slide graphic

535
Chapter 17: Creating Support Materials

■Resizing the Notes pane
 
■Adding clip art or other graphics to the background
 
■Adding a colored, textured, or patterned background to the notes page
 
3. When you are finished, click the Close Master View button to return to Normal 
view.
Printing Notes Pages
When you’re ready to print your notes pages, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Print. The Print controls appear.
 
2. Click the button immediately below the Slides box, and choose Notes Pages as 
the type of layout to print.
 
3. Set any other options, just as you did when printing handouts earlier in the 
chapter. (If you need to choose which printer to use or to set the options for that 
printer, see the section “Setting Printer-Speciﬁ c Options” earlier in this chapter.) 
There are no special options for notes pages.
 
4. Click OK. The notes pages print.
If you print notes pages for hidden slides, you may want to arrange your stack after they’re printed so that the hidden 
slides are at the bottom. That way you won’t get confused when giving the presentation.
Printing an Outline
If text is the main part of your presentation, you might prefer to print an outline instead 
of mini-slides. You can use the outline for speaker notes, audience handouts, or both. To 
print the text from Outline view, follow these steps:
 
1. View the outline in Normal or Outline view.
 
2. Choose File ➪ Print. The Print controls appear. 
 
3. Click the button immediately below the Slides text box, and choose Outline as 
the type of layout to print.
 
4. Set any other print options, as you learned in the section “Printing Handouts” 
earlier in the chapter.
 
5. Click OK.
Be aware, however, that the outline will not contain text that you’ve typed in manually 
placed text boxes or any other non-text information, such as tables, charts, and so on.

536
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Exporting Handouts or Notes Pages to Word
One of the drawbacks to PowerPoint is that the notes and handouts pages cannot be fully 
formatted. There’s a lot you can’t do with them—such as set margins or change the sizes of 
the slide images for handouts. To get around this, you might want to create your handouts 
in Microsoft Word. To send your presentation to Word, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Export ➪ Create Handouts ➪ Create Handouts. The Send to 
Microsoft Ofﬁ ce Word dialog box appears (Figure 17.13).
FIGURE 17.13
Choose a format for sending the presentation to Word.
 
2. Choose one of the formats shown in Figure 17.13. You can send your presentation 
to Word in a variety of formats. Some formats are more appropriate for handouts, 
others for speaker notes. Table 17.2 gives some suggestions:

17
link, then the changes you make to the PowerPoint ﬁ le are reﬂ ected in the 
Word ﬁ le.
 
4. Click OK. Word opens and the slides appear in the format you chose. See 
Figure 17.14.
FIGURE 17.14
With the notes pages or handouts in Word, you can change the margins and other settings.
 
5. Modify the formatting as desired, and then print from Word.
 
6. (Optional) Save your work in Word if you want to print the same pages again 
later. (You may choose to resend to Word later, after making changes in PowerPoint 
instead.)
The slides appear in Word in a table (if you chose a Next to Slides option) but without visible gridlines showing. You 
can resize (or even delete) the columns for each element by dragging the column dividers, just as you do in a table in 
PowerPoint.

538
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Changing the Margins in Word
One beneﬁ t of exporting handouts to Word is being able to change the margins. In Word, 
on the Page Layout tab, click the Margins button, and choose a margin preset or choose 
Custom Margins.
However, note that changing the page margins does not resize the table. If you change the 
left margin, the table may start at a different place in relation to the left margin (because 
the table is left aligned), but if you want to increase the margins so that you can increase 
the table width, those are two separate activities.
You can also set internal margins in the cells in a table. To do so, on the Table Tools Layout 
tab, click Cell Margins.
Change the Table Alignment
The table itself has a default alignment in relationship to the page: Top Left. If you prefer 
the look of a centered table, you may want to switch this:
 
■To make the table horizontally centered on the page, select the table as a whole. 
To do this, click the square above and to the left of the table with the four-headed 
arrow in it. Then use the Center button on the Home tab (Paragraph group) to cen-
ter it. Note that this does not center the text within the cells; this refers only to 
the table.
 
■To vertically center the table on the page, you need to set the vertical alignment 
for the document. To do so, on the Page Layout tab in Word, click the dialog box 
launcher in the Page Setup group, and on the Layout tab in the Page Setup dialog 
box, set the vertical alignment to Center.
Change Alignment within a Cell
To center the content within a cell horizontally, click in that cell, and then on the Table Tools 
Layout tab, click the Middle Center button. You can also choose any of the other buttons that 
are combinations of vertical and horizontal alignment. Figure 17.15 shows the nine available 
options, each of which is a unique combination of a vertical and a horizontal alignment.
FIGURE 17.15
Set table alignment from the Table Tools Layout tab.

539
Chapter 17: Creating Support Materials
17
Resize Rows and Columns
To resize a column, drag the border between that column and the one to its right. When 
the mouse pointer is over a column border, it changes to a double-headed arrow with a line 
between the arrows. Alternatively you can specify an exact size by clicking in the column, 
and then on the Table Tools Layout tab, set a value in the Cell Size group. Do the same for 
row heights. For a better look at the gridlines, on the Table Tools Format tab, enable View 
Gridlines. These appear only on-screen; they will not print.
You cannot resize a row or column to the point that its text content no longer fi ts. (And the lines for the audience to 
write on are made up of underline characters, which are considered text.) Therefore, you may need to resize the con-
tent or even delete some of it. For example, if you use a layout that includes blank lines, you’ll get several blank lines 
in some of the cells. To make these cells narrower, you need to decrease the length of the lines fi rst. To make these 
cells shorter, you may need to delete one or more of the lines.
Turn On/Off Cell Borders
By default, all borders are turned off for all cells in the table. You can turn them on in a 
variety of ways, but perhaps the easiest is to select one or more cells and then use the 
Borders button on the Table Tools Design tab. Choose the button that has no borders (all 
dotted lines) to turn all borders off again. See Figure 17.16.
One thing to note about these borders is that whatever you choose applies to the selected range, not to the individual 
cells. For example, suppose you choose a range of cells that contains three rows and you apply a bottom border. The 
border would be applied only to the bottom of the third row of cells.
Apply a Background
To apply a background to the entire page, use the Page Color button on the Page Layout tab 
in Word. A palette of colors appears. The choices are much the same as in PowerPoint.
Word 2013 uses the same themes as PowerPoint. You can apply a theme to the document in Word to make it match 
the formatting of the presentation in PowerPoint.
To apply a background to only certain cells, select the cells, and then on the Table Tools 
Design tab, click the Shading button and select a color. This is a lot like applying a ﬁ ll color 
in PowerPoint.

540
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
FIGURE 17.16
The Borders button has a drop-down list of border sides to turn on/off.
Resize the Graphics
Resizing the slide images is one of the most common reasons people export PowerPoint 
handouts to Word. Each image is resizable individually, so they need not necessarily be the 
same size (although it usually looks better if they are).
If you want to make the slides larger, you can ﬁ rst increase the column width for the 
column in which they reside. Then drag the selection handles on the slide thumbnail to 
resize.
If you want to resize all of the slide images and you want them all to be the same size, set the table column width to 
the width you want for the images and then resize each picture so it’s as large as it can be while still fi tting in that 
column. Unfortunately you cannot resize multiple images as a batch.

Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to create a hard copy to support your presentation. You 
can now create a variety of handouts, and write and print out speaker notes for yourself. 
You also learned how to export handouts, notes pages, and outlines to Word, where you can 
use the full power of Word’s formatting tools to create exactly the look you want.
In the next chapter, you take a look at the controls that PowerPoint offers for preparing 
for a live presentation. You learn how to create custom shows, work with hidden slides, and 
navigate through a presentation in Slide Show view.

t’s showtime! Well, actually I hope for your sake that it is not time for the show this very instant 
because things will go much more smoothly if you can practice using PowerPoint’s slide-show 
controls before you have to go live.
Presenting the show can be as simple or as complex as you make it. At the most basic level, you can 
start the show, move through it slide by slide with simple mouse clicks or key presses, and then 
end the show. However, to take advantage of PowerPoint’s extra slide-show features, you should 
spend a little time studying the following sections.
The fi rst part of this chapter assumes that you are showing your presentation on a PC that has PowerPoint 2013 
installed; sections later in this chapter discuss other situations.
Starting and Ending a Show
To start a show, do any of the following:
 
■On the Slide Show tab, click either From Beginning or From Current Slide.
 
■Click the Slide Show View button in the bottom-right corner of the screen (to begin from 
the current slide).

544
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
 
■Press F5 (to begin from the beginning).
 
■Press Shift+F5 (to begin from the current slide).
Once the show is underway, you can control the movement from slide to slide as described 
in the section “Moving from Slide to Slide.”
To end the show, do any of the following:
 
■Right-click and choose End Show.
 
■Press Esc, - (minus), or Ctrl+Break.
If you want to temporarily pause the show while you have a discussion, you can blank the 
screen by pressing W or , (comma) for a white screen or B or . (period) for a black screen. To 
resume the show, press any key.
If you set up the slide transitions to occur automatically at a certain time, you can stop or restart the show by press-
ing S or + (plus sign). However, this is more of an issue for self-running shows, which are discussed in Chapter 19, 
“Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations.”
Using the On-Screen Show Controls
When you display a slide show, the mouse pointer and show controls are hidden. To make 
them appear, you can move the mouse. When you do this, very faint buttons, shown in 
Figure 18.1, appear in the bottom-left corner of the slide show and the mouse pointer also 
appears. PowerPoint calls this row of buttons the popup toolbar. The buttons on this toolbar 
are different from the ones in earlier versions of PowerPoint, and they offer many addi-
tional capabilities. From left to right, the buttons are as follows:
FIGURE 18.1
These buttons appear in the bottom-left corner of a slide in Slide Show view.

■Back, the leftmost button, takes you back to the previous slide or to the previous 
animation event if the present slide contains animation.
 
■Forward moves you to the next slide. Normally, you can just click to go to the next 
slide, but if you are using the pen (covered later in this chapter), then clicking it 

545
Chapter 18: Preparing for a Live Presentation
18
causes it to draw rather than advance the presentation. In this situation, you can 
use the Forward button.
 
■Pointers opens a menu for controlling the appearance of the pen or pointer. (I dis-
cuss this feature later in this chapter.)
 
■See All Slides opens a slide-sorter-like view within Slide Show view, from which 
you can quickly select the slide you want to jump to by looking at thumbnails. 
 
■Zoom enables you to zoom in on a portion of a slide and then zoom back out again. 
 
■Options opens the menu shown in Figure 18.2. It contains a variety of commands 
for controlling the presentation, including setting arrow options and controlling 
display settings and Presenter view. You can also open this menu by right-clicking 
anywhere on the slide.
FIGURE 18.2
Click the Options button or right-click on the slide to open this menu.
You can set up your show to move backward when you click the right-mouse button. Choose File ➪ Options, click 
Advanced, and in the Slide Show section, deselect the Show Menu on Right Mouse Click check box. If you do that, 
you can’t right-click to open the navigation menu though. The toolbar in the lower-left corner of Slide Show view can 
be disabled via File ➪ Options ➪ Advanced ➪ Slide Show ➪ Show Popup Toolbar.
Because the menu that appears is identical whether you click the Options button or right-click anywhere on the slide, 
this chapter mentions only the right-click method when you need to choose something from this menu. However, keep 
in mind that you can also click the Options button on the popup toolbar if you prefer. 

546
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
There are a lot of shortcut keys to remember when working in Slide Show view, and so 
PowerPoint provides a handy summary of these keys. To see them, right-click and choose 
Help, or press F1. The Slide Show Help dialog box appears (Figure 18.3). The dialog box has 
several tabbed pages; click a tab to browse for the shortcuts of interest to you. Click OK to 
close this dialog box when you are done.
FIGURE 18.3
The Slide Show Help dialog box provides a quick summary of the shortcut keys that are 
available during a presentation.
Moving from Slide to Slide
The simplest way to move through a presentation is to move to the next slide. To do so, you 
can use any of these methods:
 
■Press any of these keys: N, spacebar, right arrow, down arrow, Enter, or Page Down.
 
■Click the left mouse button.
 
■Right-click and choose Next.
 
■Click the right-pointing arrow button in the bottom-left corner of the slide.
If you have animated any elements on a slide, these methods advance the animation and 
do not necessarily move to the next slide. For example, if you have animated your bulleted 
list so that the bullets appear one at a time, then any of the actions in this list make the 
next bullet appear rather than making the next slide appear. Only after all of the objects 
on the current slide have displayed does PowerPoint advance to the next slide. If you need 
to immediately advance to the next slide, you can use the instructions in the next section, 
“Jumping to Speciﬁ c Slides.”

547
Chapter 18: Preparing for a Live Presentation
18
To back up to the previous slide, use any of these methods:
 
■Press any of these keys: P, Backspace, left arrow, up arrow, or Page Up.
 
■Click the left-pointing arrow button on the bottom-left corner of the slide.
 
■Right-click and choose Previous.
You can also go back to the last slide that you viewed. To do this, right-click and choose 
Last Viewed. Although you would think that the last slide viewed would be the same as 
the previous slide, this is not always the case. For example, if you jump around in the slide 
show — such as to a hidden slide — then the last slide viewed is not the previous slide in 
the show but the hidden slide that you have just viewed.
Jumping to Specifi c Slides
There are several ways to jump to a particular slide. One of the easiest ways is to use See 
All Slides to locate the slide from its thumbnail image. To do so, follow these steps:
 
1. During the slide show, right-click to display the shortcut menu.
 
2. Select See All Slides. Thumbnail images of the slides appear, as shown in 
Figure 18.4. 
FIGURE 18.4
You can go to a specifi c slide using the See All Slides command on the menu.
 
3. Click the slide to which you want to jump.

548
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
You can also jump to a certain slide by typing its number and pressing Enter. For example, 
to go to the third slide, you would type 3 and then press Enter. Another way is to press 
Ctrl+S to open an All Slides dialog box listing the titles of all of the slides in the presenta-
tion. You can click a slide to select it and then click Go To, as shown in Figure 18.5.
FIGURE 18.5
The All Slides dialog box lists the titles of all of the slides so that you can select the one you 
want to go to.
To jump back to the ﬁ rst slide in the presentation, hold down both the left and right mouse 
buttons for two seconds (or type 1 and press Enter).
Blanking the Screen
Sometimes during a live presentation there may be a delay. Whether it is a chatty audience 
member with a complicated question, a ﬁ re drill, or just an intermission, you will want to 
pause the show.
If you have the slides set for manual transition, then the slide you stopped on remains on 
the screen until you resume. However, you may not want this. For example, it may be dis-
tracting to the audience, especially if the pause is to allow someone to get up and speak in 
front of the screen. A solution is to turn the screen into a blank expanse of black or white. 
To do so, type W or a comma (for white), or type B or a period (for black). To return to the 
presentation, you can press the same key or press any key on the keyboard.
While the screen is completely black or white, you can draw on it with the pen tool so that it becomes a convenient 
“scratch pad.” Annotations you make with the pen on the blank screen are not saved; when you resume the presenta-
tion, they are gone forever. (In contrast, you do have the opportunity to save any annotations you make on the slides 
themselves, as you will learn in the next section.)

Using the On-Screen Pen
Have you ever seen a coach in a locker room drawing out football plays on a chalkboard? 
Well, you can do the same thing in PowerPoint. You can have an impromptu discussion of 
concepts that are illustrated on slides and punctuate the discussion with your own circles, 
arrows, and lines. Perhaps during the discussion portion of your presentation, you may 
decide that one point on the slide is not important. In this case, you can use the pen to 
cross it out. Conversely, a certain point may become really important during a discussion and 
you want to emphasize it. In this case, you can circle it or underline it with the pen cursor.
You can choose your pen color as follows:
 
1. Move the mouse to make the buttons appear.
 
2. Click the Pointers button (the one that looks like a pen). A menu appears. 
Alternatively, you can right-click and then choose Pointer Options to see a similar 
menu. (The main difference is that on the right-click version, you have to select 
the Ink Color command for access to the ink color swatches.)
 
3. Click the color you want, as shown in Figure 18.6. (If you’re using the right-click 
version of the menu, point to Ink Color ﬁ rst.)
FIGURE 18.6
You can select a pen type and an ink color for it.
To change the default pen color for the show so you don’t always have to manually select the color you want, click Set 
Up Show on the Slide Show tab. Then, in the Pen Color drop-down list, choose the color you want.
You can turn on the type of pen that you want, as follows:
 
1. Click the Pointers button again.
 
2. Click the type of pen that you want: 
 
■Pen. A thin solid line
 
■Highlighter. A thick, semitransparent line

550
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
The on-screen buttons in the slide show continue to work while you have a pen enabled, but you have to click them 
twice to activate them — once to tell PowerPoint to temporarily switch out of the Pen mode and then again to open 
the menu.
You can also turn on the default pen by pressing Ctrl+P and then return to the arrow again 
by pressing Ctrl+A or Esc.
After enabling a pen, just drag and draw on the slide to make your mark. You should prac-
tice drawing lines, arrows, and other shapes because it takes a while to master. Figure 18.7 
shows an example of using the pen.
FIGURE 18.7
You can draw on the slide with the pen tools.
The on-screen pen is not very attractive. If you know in advance that you are going to emphasize certain points, you 
may prefer to build the emphasis into the presentation by making these points larger, bolder, or in different colors. 
You can also circle the points using an animated oval shape.
To erase your lines and try again, press E (for Erase), or open the Pointer menu (or right-
click and choose Pointer Options) and choose Erase All Ink on Slide. To erase just a part of 
the ink, open the Pointer menu, choose Eraser, and then use the mouse pointer to erase 
individual lines.

551
Chapter 18: Preparing for a Live Presentation
18
Unlike in some earlier versions of PowerPoint, drawings are not erased on a slide when you move to another slide.
When you exit Slide Show view after drawing on slides, a dialog box appears, asking 
whether you want to keep or discard your annotations. If you choose Keep, the annotations 
become drawn objects on the slides, which you can then move or delete, similar to a line 
drawn with the drawing tools.
The pen remains a pen when you advance from slide to slide. To change the pen back to a 
pointer again, open the Pointer menu and choose Arrow, press Ctrl+A, or press Esc. 
Hiding Slides for Backup Use
You may not always want to show every slide that you have prepared. Sometimes it pays 
to prepare extra data in anticipation of a question that you think someone might ask or to 
hold back certain data unless someone speciﬁ cally requests it.
By hiding a slide, you keep it ﬁ led in reserve, without making it a part of the main slide 
show. Then, at any time during the presentation when (or if) it becomes appropriate, you 
can display that slide. Hiding refers only to whether the slide is a part of the main presen-
tation’s ﬂ ow; it has no effect in any other view.
If you have only a handful of slides to hide, go ahead and hide them. However, if you have a large group of related 
slides to hide, consider creating a custom show instead. Custom shows are covered later in this chapter.
Hiding and Unhiding Slides
Slide Sorter view is a good view from which to hide and unhide slides because an indicator 
appears below each slide to show whether it is hidden. This way, you can easily determine 
which slides are a part of the main presentation. In the slide thumbnail pane in Normal 
view, hidden slides appear ghosted out.
Follow these steps to hide a slide:
 
1. Switch to Slide Sorter view.
 
2. Select the slide or slides that you want to hide. Remember, to select more than 
one slide, hold down the Ctrl key as you click the ones that you want.
 
3. Click the Hide Slide button on the Slide Show tab of the ribbon, or right-click 
one of the selected slides and choose Hide Slide from the shortcut menu. A 
diagonal line crosses through the slide indicating that it is hidden. The slide’s con-
tent also appears dimmed.

552
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
To unhide a slide, select the slide and click Hide Slide again. The slide’s number returns to 
normal. You can also right-click a slide and choose Hide Slide again to toggle the hidden 
attribute off.
To quickly unhide all slides, select all of the slides (press Ctrl+A) and then click the Hide Slides button twice. The fi rst 
click hides all of the remaining slides that were not already hidden, and the second click unhides them all.
Showing a Hidden Slide during a Presentation
When you advance from one slide to the next during a show, hidden slides do not appear. 
(This is what being hidden is about, after all.) If you need to display one of the hidden 
slides, follow these steps:
 
1. In Slide Show view, click the See All Slides button in the bottom-left corner of 
the screen, or right-click and choose See All Slides.
Thumbnails of the slides appear, and hidden slides appear dimmed and with a diag-
onal line drawn through their numbers, as in Figure 18.8.
FIGURE 18.8
Hidden slides appear dimmed.

553
Chapter 18: Preparing for a Live Presentation

2. Click the hidden slide to which you want to jump. 
If you already know the number of the hidden slide, then you can simply type the number on the keyboard and press 
Enter to display it. This also works with slides that are not hidden.
Once you display a hidden slide, you can easily return to it later. When you move backward 
through the presentation (using the Backspace key, the left or up arrow key, or the on-
screen Back button), any hidden slides that you displayed previously are included in the 
slides that PowerPoint scrolls back through. However, when you move forward through the 
presentation, the hidden slide does not reappear, regardless of when you viewed it previ-
ously. You can always jump back to it again using the preceding steps. You can also set up 
hyperlinks to go to, and leave, hidden slides.
Using Custom Shows
Many slide shows have a linear ﬂ ow: First you show slide one, and then slide two, and so 
on, until you have completed the entire presentation. This format is suitable for situations 
where you are presenting clear-cut information with few variables, such as a presentation 
about a new insurance plan for a group of employees. However, when the situation becomes 
more complex, a single-path slide show may not sufﬁ ce. This is especially true when you 
are presenting a persuasive message to decision makers; you want to anticipate their ques-
tions and their need for more information and have many backup slides, or even entire 
backup slide shows, that are prepared in case questions arise. Figure 18.9 shows a ﬂ ow 
chart for this kind of presentation.
If you simply want to hide a few slides for backup use, then you do not need to create a custom show. Instead, you 
can just hide the slides.
Another great use for custom shows is to set aside a group of slides for a speciﬁ c audience. 
For example, you might need to present essentially the same information to employees at 
two different sites. In this case, you could create two custom shows within the main show 
and include in each show slides that they both have in common as well as slides that are 
appropriate for only one audience or the other. Figure 18.10 shows a ﬂ ow chart for this kind 
of presentation.

554

Notice in Figure 18.10 that although some of the slides in the two custom shows are the 
same, they repeat in each custom show rather than jumping back to the main presentation. 
This is because it is much easier to jump to the custom show once and stay there than it is 
to keep jumping into and out of the show.
Slides in a custom show remain a part of the main presentation. Placing a slide in a custom 
show does not exclude it from the regular presentation ﬂ ow. However, you may decide that 
you no longer want to show the main presentation in its present form; you may just want 
to use it as a resource pool from which you can select slides for other custom shows. To 
learn how to set up PowerPoint so that a custom show rather than the main presentation 
starts when you enter Slide Show view, see the section “Using a Custom Show as the Main 
Presentation” later in this chapter.
Ideas for Using Custom Shows
Here are some ideas to start you thinking about how and why you might want to include 
some custom shows in your presentation ﬁ les:
 
■Avoiding duplication. If you have several shows that use about 50 percent of the 
same slides and the other 50 percent are different ones, you can create all of the 
shows as custom shows within a single presentation ﬁ le. This way, the presenta-
tions can share the 50 percent of the slides that they have in common.

555
Chapter 18: Preparing for a Live Presentation
18
 
■Managing change. By creating a single presentation ﬁ le with custom shows, you 
make it easy to manage changes. If any changes occur in your company that affect 
any of the common slides, making the change once in your presentation ﬁ le makes 
the change to each of the custom shows immediately.
 
■Overcoming objections. You can anticipate client objections to your sales pitch 
and prepare several custom shows, each of which addresses a particular objection. 
Then, whatever reason your potential customer gives for not buying your product, 
you have a counteractive argument at hand.
 
■Covering your backside. If you think that you may be asked for speciﬁ c ﬁ gures or 
other information during a speech, you can have this information ready in a cus-
tom show (or on a few simple hidden slides, if there is not a lot of information) to 
display if needed. No more going through the embarrassment of having to say, “I’m 
not sure, but let me get back to you on that.”

You can create custom shows that allow you to use the same presentation for 
multiple audiences.

Creating Custom Shows
To create a custom show, ﬁ rst create all of the slides that should go into it. Start with all of 
the slides in the main presentation. Then follow these steps:
 
1. On the Slide Show tab, click Custom Slide Show, and then click Custom Shows. 
The Custom Shows dialog box opens.
If no custom shows are defi ned yet, the Custom Shows command is the only item that appears on this menu. 
Otherwise, your existing custom shows appear on and can be run from the menu.
 
2. Click New. The Deﬁ ne Custom Show dialog box opens.
 
3. Type a name for your custom show in the Slide Show Name text box, replacing 
the default name.
 
4. In the Slides in Presentation pane, click the check box for the first slide that 
you want to appear in the custom show.
You can select multiple slides before clicking Add in Step 5. However, be aware that 
if you do this, the slides move to the Slides in Custom Show pane in the order that 
they originally appeared. If you want them in a different order, copy each slide 
over separately, in the order that you want, or rearrange the order as described in 
step 7.
 
5. Click Add to copy the slide to the Slides in Custom Show pane. See Figure 18.11.
FIGURE 18.11
Use the Add button to copy slides from the main presentation into the custom show.
 
6. If you need to select more slides, repeat steps 4 and 5 for each slide that you 
want to include in the custom show. 

557
Chapter 18: Preparing for a Live Presentation
18
 
7. If you need to rearrange the slides in the custom show, click the slide that you 
want to move in the Slides in Custom Show pane and then click the up or down 
arrow button to change its position.
 
8. When you are finished building your custom show, click OK. The new show 
appears in the Custom Shows dialog box.
 
9. (Optional) To test your custom show, click the Show button. Otherwise, click 
Close to close the Custom Shows dialog box.
Editing Custom Shows
You can manage your custom shows from the Custom Shows dialog box, the same place in 
which you created them. This includes editing, deleting, or making a copy of a show. To 
change which slides appear in a custom show, and in what order, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Slide Show tab, click Custom Slide Show and then click Custom Shows. 
The Custom Shows dialog box appears (Figure 18.12).
FIGURE 18.12
Select a custom show and then click the appropriate button to edit, copy, or 
delete it.
 
2. If you have more than one custom show, click the one that you want to edit.
 
3. Click Edit. The Deﬁ ne Custom Show dialog box reappears (Figure 18.11).
 
4. Add or remove slides as needed. To add a slide, select it in the left pane and click 
Add. To remove a slide, select it in the right pane and click Remove.
Removing a slide from a custom show does not remove it from the overall presentation.
 
5. Rearrange slides as needed with the up and down arrow buttons.
 
6. (Optional) You can change the custom show’s name in the Slide Show Name 
text box.
 
7. Click OK. PowerPoint saves your changes. 
 
8. Click Close to close the Custom Shows dialog box.

558
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Copying Custom Shows
A good way to create several similar custom shows is to create the ﬁ rst one and then copy 
it. You can then make small changes to the copies as necessary. To copy a custom show, fol-
low these steps:
 
1. On the Slide Show tab, click Custom Slide Show and then click Custom Shows. 
The Custom Shows dialog box appears (Figure 18.12).
 
2. If you have more than one custom show, select the show that you want to copy.
 
3. Click Copy. A copy of the show appears in the dialog box. The ﬁ lename includes the 
words Copy of so that you can distinguish it from the original.
 
4. Edit the copy, as explained in the preceding section, to change its name and 
content.
 
5. When you are finished, click Close to close the Custom Shows dialog box.
Deleting Custom Shows
It is not necessary to delete a custom show when you do not want it anymore; it does 
not do any harm remaining in your presentation. Because custom shows do not display 
unless you call for them, you can simply choose not to display it. However, if you want to 
make your presentation more orderly, you can delete a custom show that you no longer 
want. Follow these steps:
 
1. On the Slide Show tab, click Custom Slide Show and then click Custom Shows. 
The Custom Shows dialog box appears (Figure 18.12).
 
2. Select the show that you want to delete.
 
3. Click Remove. The show disappears from the list.
 
4. Click Close to close the Custom Shows dialog box.
Displaying a Custom Show
To start your presentation with a custom show, on the Slide Show tab, click Custom 
Slide Show and then click the name of the custom show on the drop-down menu. The 
custom show runs.
You can also call up the custom show at any time during your main presentation. There are 
two ways to do this: You can navigate to the custom show with PowerPoint’s regular presen-
tation controls, or you can create a hyperlink to the custom show on your slide.
Navigating to a Custom Show
During a presentation, you can jump to any of your custom shows by following these steps 
from Slide Show view:
 
1. Click the Options button, or right-click to open the menu.

559
Chapter 18: Preparing for a Live Presentation
18
 
2. Choose Custom Show and then select the custom show that you want, as shown 
in Figure 18.13. The custom show starts.
FIGURE 18.13
Choose the custom show that you want to jump to.
When you start a custom show, you are no longer in the main presentation. To verify this, 
open the shortcut menu again, choose Go to Slide, and check out the list of slides. This list 
shows only the slides that belong to the custom show. 
Navigating Back to the Main Show
To return to the main show, follow these steps:
 
1. Press Ctrl+S to open the All Slides dialog box.
 
2. Open the Show drop-down list and choose All Slides.
 
3. Select the slide that you want to go to. You can choose from all of the slides in 
the entire presentation.
 
4. Click Go To.
To avoid having to press Ctrl+S to return to the main show, you can create a hyperlink or action button for a specifi c 
slide in your main show.
Creating a Hyperlink to a Custom Show
Although you learn a lot about hyperlinks in upcoming chapters, here is a preview. 
Hyperlinks are hot links that you place on your slides. When you click a hyperlink, you 

560
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
jump the display to some other location. This is why they are called hot. A hyperlink can 
jump to an Internet location, a different spot in your presentation, an external ﬁ le (such as 
a Word document), or just about anywhere else.
One way to gain quick access to your custom shows in a presentation is to create hyperlinks 
for them on certain key slides that act as jumping points. You can insert a text hyperlink 
into any text box, and its text becomes the marker that you click. For example, if you 
insert a hyperlink for a custom show called Radio Spots, then the hyperlink text could read 
Radio Spots. If you want to get fancier, you can select some existing text or an existing 
graphic object and then attach the hyperlink to it. For example, as shown in Figure 18.14, I 
have inserted a clip-art image of a radio and set it up to be a hyperlink to the custom show 
that provides details about the radio spots.
FIGURE 18.14
You can create hyperlinks on slides that display custom shows.
Text box with
instructions
Hyperlink to

Follow these steps:
 
1. If you are attaching the hyperlink to another object (such as the radio in 
Figure 18.14) or some text, then select the object or text.
 
2. On the Insert tab, click Hyperlink. The Insert Hyperlink dialog box appears.
 
3. Click the Place in This Document icon along the left side of the dialog box.
 
4. In the Select a Place in This Document pane, scroll down to the Custom Shows 
list.
 
5. Click the custom show that you want to jump to with this hyperlink, as shown 
in Figure 18.15.

561
Chapter 18: Preparing for a Live Presentation
18
FIGURE 18.15
Choose one of your custom shows as the place to jump to when the user clicks the 
hyperlink.
 
6. (Optional) If you want to return to the same spot that you left in the main pre-
sentation after viewing this custom show, select the Show and Return check 
box. If you do not select this option, the presentation will simply end when the 
custom show ends.
 
7. (Optional) If you want to specify a ScreenTip for the hyperlink, click the 
ScreenTip button to create one.
 
8. Click OK.
If you are using text for the hyperlink, the text now appears underlined and in a differ-
ent color. This color is controlled by the color theme of your presentation (speciﬁ cally the 
Hyperlink and Followed Hyperlink colors). If you are using a graphic, its appearance does 
not change. However, when you are in Slide Show view and you move the mouse pointer over 
the object, the pointer changes to a pointing hand, indicating that the object is a hyperlink.
If you do not want your linked text to be underlined or to change colors upon return, you can draw a rectangle with 
no border and 99 percent white fi ll over the top of the text and link to the rectangle instead. Because this shape is 
on top of the text, you click it instead of the text. Keep in mind that you should create your link before changing the 
border and fi ll of the shape to almost no color.
Another way to use hyperlinks for custom shows is to set up the ﬁ rst few slides generically 
for all audiences and then to branch off into one custom show or another, based on user 
input. The diagram in Figure 18.9 is an example of this type of presentation. After the ﬁ rst 
two slides, you could set up a “decision” slide that contains two hyperlinks — for example, 

562
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
one for video products and one for audio products. The user would then click the hyperlink 
they want.
You can also create hyperlinks to custom shows by using action buttons. Action buttons are a special type of drawn 
shape that is designed specifi cally for creating hyperlinks within a presentation.
Using a Custom Show as the Main Presentation
If you have a complete show contained in one of your custom shows, you may sometimes 
want to show it as the default presentation. To do this, you must tell PowerPoint that 
you want to bypass the main presentation and start with the custom show.
The easiest way to show a custom show is to select it from the Custom Slide Show drop-
down menu on the Slide Show tab. However, you can also set up a custom show to be the 
default show for the presentation by following these steps:
 
1. On the Slide Show tab, click Set Up Slide Show. The Set Up Show dialog box 
appears.
 
2. Click Custom Show, and then open the Custom Show drop-down list and choose 
the show that you want to use, as shown in Figure 18.16.
FIGURE 18.16
Use the Set Up Show dialog box to control which of your custom shows runs when 
you start the show.
Choose a custom show.
 
3. Click OK. Now, when you start the show, the custom show runs.

563
Chapter 18: Preparing for a Live Presentation
18
You do not have to set up a custom show to narrow down the list of slides that appear when you run your presenta-
tion. You can choose which slides you want to show by using the From and To boxes in the Show Slides section, shown 
in Figure 18.16. For example, to show slides 5 to 10, you would type 5 in the From box and 10 in the To box.
Creating and Using Sections
When you have lots of slides in a presentation, you may ﬁ nd it helpful to organize them 
into sections for easier management in Normal or Slide Sorter view. You can then collapse 
or expand the sections to focus in on a subset of the slides, as shown in Figure 18.17.
FIGURE 18.17
Expand or collapse sections.

Section breaks do not appear in Outline view. They appear only in Normal view.

564
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Creating a Section Break
To divide your presentation into multiple sections, insert a section break between two 
slides. All the slides above the break are in one section, and all slides below the break are 
in another.
To insert a section break, follow these steps:
 
1. In Normal view, in the Slides pane, click between two slides. A horizontal line 
appears there.
 
2. Right-click the horizontal line and choose Add Section. A new section break is 
created.
You can also select the slide you want to use as the ﬁ rst slide in a section. Then choose 
Home ➪ Section ➪ Add Section to make it into a section heading.
Renaming a Section
Each section you create has a default generic name: Untitled Section. You will probably 
want to give the sections more meaningful names. To rename a section, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the section name in the Slides pane. A shortcut menu opens, as 
shown in Figure 18.18.
FIGURE 18.18
Right-clicking a section name opens a shortcut menu of commands.
 
2. Click Rename Section. The Rename Section dialog box opens.
 
3. Type the new name.
 
4. Click Rename or press Enter.
Instead of steps 1 and 2, you can choose Home ➪ Slides ➪ Section ➪ Rename Section. 

565
Chapter 18: Preparing for a Live Presentation
18
Deleting a Section
There are several options when deleting a section:
 
■Remove Section. Deletes the section break but keeps the section’s slides and places 
them in the previous section. 
 
■Remove Section & Slides. Deletes the section break and all slides that were within 
that section.
 
■Remove All Sections. Deletes all section break lines but keeps all slides.
To do any of these, right-click the section name in the Slides pane and make your selection 
from the shortcut menu, as shown in Figure 18.18. You can also use the Section button’s 
menu on the Home tab, but it does not contain the Remove Section & Slides option.
Reordering Sections
Sections can be useful for quickly reordering large blocks of slides. Place all the slides 
within a single section, and then move the section to move all the slides at once.
To move a section, use either of these techniques:
 
■Right-click the section bar and choose Move Section Up or Move Section Down. See 
Figure 18.18.
 
■Drag the section name up or down in the Slides pane. You might ﬁ nd this easier if 
you collapse the section, but it is not required.
If you select a section name and then issue the Cut or Delete command, all the slides within that section are removed 
but the section itself remains. The section itself is not included in the operation. Therefore, you cannot use the Cut 
and Paste commands (Ctrl+X and Ctrl+V) to move sections to different spots in the presentation.
Giving a Presentation on a Different Computer
The computer on which you create a presentation is usually not the same computer that you 
will use to show it. For example, you may be doing the bulk of your work on your desktop 
computer in your ofﬁ ce in Los Angeles but you need to use your laptop computer to give the 
presentation in Phoenix.
One way to transfer a presentation to another computer is simply to copy the PowerPoint 
ﬁ le (the ﬁ le with the .pptx ﬁ lename extension) using a ﬂ ash drive or other removable 
media. However, this method is imperfect because it assumes that the other computer has 
all of the fonts, sounds, and other elements that you need for every part of the show. This 
can be a dangerous assumption. For example, suppose your presentation contains a link to 

566
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
some Excel data. If you do not also copy the Excel ﬁ le, then you cannot update the data 
when you are on the road.
A better way to ensure that you are taking everything you need while traveling is to use 
the Package Presentation for CD feature in PowerPoint. This feature reads all of the linked 
ﬁ les and associated objects and ensures that they are transferred along with the main pre-
sentation. You do not actually need to copy the presentation to a writeable CD, and you do 
not need a CD-R or CD-RW drive to use this feature. You can copy the presentation package 
anywhere you want, such as to a ﬂ ash drive or a network location.

If you have a CD-R or CD-RW drive, then copying the presentation to CD is an attractive 
choice. It produces a self-running disc that contains all the presentation ﬁ les and their 
needed linked ﬁ les, plus a web page (HTML format) from which you can choose which pre-
sentation ﬁ le to run. That web page also contains a hyperlink you can use to download 
the PowerPoint Viewer application if needed. (You need it only if PowerPoint itself is not 
installed on the PC on which you want to view the presentation.) Figure 18.19 shows a 
sample web page for accessing a package that contains two different presentations, for 
example.
FIGURE 18.19
The Package for CD command generates a CD containing all data fi les needed to show the 
presentation plus a browser-based interface like the one shown here.

You can copy many presentation fi les onto a single CD, not just the currently active one, which is included by default. 
The only limit is the size of the disc (usually 650MB to 700MB). 
Here is the basic procedure, which is elaborated on in the following sections:
 
1. Place a blank CD-R or CD-RW disc in your writeable CD drive.
 
2. Make sure the presentation is exactly the way you want it. If you are using a 
CD-R disc, keep in mind that this disc type is not rewriteable, and so you should 
ensure that the presentation is exactly as you want it.
 
3. Choose File ➪ Export ➪ Package Presentation for CD ➪ Package for CD. The 
Package for CD dialog box opens (Figure 18.20).
FIGURE 18.20
Use the Package for CD feature to place all of the necessary fi les for the presentation 
on a CD.
 
4. Type a name for the CD; this is similar to adding a volume label for the disc.
 
5. (Optional) Add more files to the CD if you want. See the next section, “Creating 
a CD Containing Multiple Presentation Files,” for more details.
 
6. (Optional) Set any options that you want. See the section “Setting Copy Options” 
later in this chapter, for more details.
 
7. Click Copy to CD.
 
8. If a warning appears asking if you want to include linked files in your pack-
age, click Yes. 

568
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
The CD-writing process may take several minutes, depending on the writing speed 
of your CD drive and the size of the presentation ﬁ les that you are placing on it. 
If a message appears that the package will not include comments, revisions, or ink 
annotations, click Continue. This message appears only if your presentation con-
tains any of those things.
A message appears when the ﬁ les are successfully copied to the CD asking whether 
you want to copy the same ﬁ les to another CD.
 
9. Click Yes or No. If you choose No, then you must also click Close to close the 
Package for CD dialog box.
The resulting CD automatically plays the presentations when you insert it in any computer. 
You can also browse the CD’s contents to open the PowerPoint Viewer separately and use it 
to play speciﬁ c presentations.
File corruption can occur on a CD drive during the writing process. After burning a CD, test it thoroughly by run-
ning the complete presentation from CD before you rely on the CD copy as the version that you take with you while 
traveling.
Creating a CD Containing Multiple Presentation Files
By default, the active presentation is included on the CD, but you can also add others, up 
to the capacity of your disc. For example, if you have several versions of the same presen-
tation for different audiences, a single CD can contain all of them. As you are preparing 
to copy the ﬁ les using the Package for CD dialog box, shown in Figure 18.20, follow these 
steps to add more ﬁ les:
 
1. Click Add. An Add dialog box opens, similar to the Open dialog box that you use to 
open PowerPoint ﬁ les.
 
2. Select the additional files that you want to include, and click Add to return 
to the Package for CD dialog box. The list of ﬁ les now appears as shown in 
Figure 18.21.
You can select multiple ﬁ les from the same location by holding down the Ctrl key 
as you click the ones you want. To include multiple ﬁ les from different locations, 
repeat steps 1 and 2 for each location.
 
3. (Optional) Rearrange the list by clicking a presentation and then clicking the 
up or down arrow buttons to the left of the list.
 
4. If you need to remove a presentation from the list, click it and then click 
Remove.
 
5. Continue making the CD as you normally would.

When you specify multiple fi les for a CD, you can specify the order in which they should play.
Setting Copy Options
The default copy options are suitable in most situations. However, you may sometimes want 
to modify them. To do this, open the Package Presentation for CD dialog box, and follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click Options. The Options dialog box opens (Figure 18.22).
FIGURE 18.22
You can set options for copying the presentations to CD.
The Linked Files check box is selected by default; this option tells PowerPoint to 
include the full copies of all linked ﬁ les. You can deselect this option if you want; a 
static copy of the linked data will remain in the presentation, but the link will not 
work. You should leave this option selected if you have sounds or multimedia ﬁ les 
in your presentation that are linked rather than embedded.

570
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
The Embedded TrueType Fonts check box is also selected by default. If you are sure 
that the destination computer contains all of the fonts that are used in the presen-
tation, then deselect this option. This makes the presentation ﬁ le slightly smaller. 
Remember, not all fonts can be embedded; this depends on the level of embedding 
allowed by the font’s manufacturer.
 
2. If you want to add passwords for the presentations, do so in the Enhance 
Security and Privacy section. There are separate text boxes for the password 
needed to open and the password needed to modify the presentation.
 
3. Select the Inspect Presentations for Inappropriate or Private Information check 
box if you want to check the presentation for private information, such as your 
name or any comments. The Document Inspector window opens. Select the types 
of content you want to check for and click Inspect.
 
4. Click OK, and then write the CD as you normally would.
Copying a Presentation to Other Locations
Although it is not well known, you can also use the Package Presentation for CD feature 
to copy presentation ﬁ les and their associated support ﬁ les to any location you want. For 
example, you can transfer ﬁ les to another computer on a network or place them on a ﬂ ash 
drive. To do so, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Package for CD dialog box, set up the package exactly the way you want 
it, including all of the presentation files and options. See the preceding sections 
for more information.
 
2. Click Copy to Folder. A Copy to Folder dialog box appears.
 
3. Type a name for the new folder in the Name the Folder text box.
 
4. Type a path for the folder in the Choose Location text box.
 
5. Click OK.
 
6. If a warning appears about linked files, click Yes or No as appropriate. 
PowerPoint copies the ﬁ les to the location you speciﬁ ed. 
 
7. If a warning appears about comments or ink annotations, click Continue.
 
8. Click Close to close the Package for CD dialog box.
 
To make a DVD video of your presentation, see Chapter 20, “Preparing a Presentation for Mass 
Distribution.”
Working with Audio-Visual Equipment
The ﬁ rst part of this chapter assumed that you were using a computer with a single moni-
tor to show your presentation, but this may not always be the case. This part of the chapter 

571
Chapter 18: Preparing for a Live Presentation
18
looks at the entire range of audio-visual options from which you can choose. There are 
many models of projection equipment in conference rooms all across the world, but most of 
them fall into one of these categories:
 
■Noncomputerized equipment. This can include an overhead transparency 
viewer, a 35mm slide projector, or other older technology. You face two chal-
lenges if you need to work with this category of equipment: One challenge is 
ﬁ guring out how the equipment works because every model is different, and 
the other challenge is producing attractive versions of your slides to work 
with the older technology. There are companies that can produce 35mm slides 
from your PowerPoint ﬁ les, or you can invest in a slide-making machine your-
self. For transparencies, you simply print your slides on transparency ﬁ lm that is 
designed for your type of printer.
 
■Single computer with a single monitor. If there is a computer with a monitor in 
the meeting room, then you can run your presentation on that computer. You can 
do this with the Package Presentation for CD feature that is discussed in the pre-
ceding sections and then run the presentation directly from the CD, provided that 
PC has PowerPoint or the PowerPoint Viewer on it.
 
■Single computer with a dual-monitor system. On systems with dual monitors, one 
monitor is shown to the audience and the other is for your own use, via Presenter 
View. This is useful when you want to display your speaker notes on the monitor 
that the audience does not see. However, you might need to set up multi-monitor 
support in Windows so that you can view different displays on each monitor.
 
■Projection system (LCD) or large monitor without a computer. If the meeting 
room has a large monitor but no computer, you will need to bring your own laptop 
computer and connect it to the monitor. Most of these systems use a standard VGA 
plug and cable.
The following sections look at some of these options in more detail.
Presenting with Two Screens
If you have two monitors — either your laptop computer screen and an external monitor 
or two external monitors hooked up to the same computer — you can display the presenta-
tion on one of them and your own notes on the other one. This is a very handy setup! The 
details are covered in the next sections.
To use two screens, you need the full version of PowerPoint on your laptop, not just the PowerPoint Viewer. You also 
need compatible hardware. For example, your laptop must have an external VGA port and a built-in video card that 
supports DualView (a Windows feature) in your version of Windows. If you have a desktop computer, you must have 
two separate video cards or a video card with two separate video ports.

572
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Confi guring Display Hardware for Multi-Screen Viewing
First, you need to prepare your hardware. On a laptop computer, this means enabling both 
the built-in and the external monitor ports and connecting an external monitor. Some 
laptops toggle between internal, external, and dual monitors with an Fn key combination; 
refer to your laptop’s documentation.
On a desktop computer, install a second video card and monitor, and then do the following 
to set them up in Windows:
 
1. When Windows restarts after you install the second video card, right-click the 
Desktop and choose Screen Resolution. 
A sample area displays two monitors. Figure 18.23 shows the Screen Resolution dia-
log box for Windows 7; the dialog boxes for other Windows versions are similar.
FIGURE 18.23
You must set up the second monitor in Windows before setting it up in PowerPoint.
The monitor that you use most of the time should be monitor 1, and the other one 
should be monitor 2. To determine which is which, click Identify; large numbers 
appear brieﬂ y on each screen.

573
Chapter 18: Preparing for a Live Presentation
18
 
2. If you need to swap the numbering of the monitors, click the one that should be 
the primary monitor and then select Make This My Main Display. This option will 
be unavailable if the currently selected monitor is already set to be the primary one.
 
3. Select the secondary monitor, and then select Extend These Displays from the 
Multiple Displays drop-down list.
 
4. (Optional) If the monitors are not arranged in the sample area in the way that 
they are physically positioned on your desk, drag the icons for the monitors to 
where you want them.
 
5. (Optional) Click a monitor in the sample area to adjust its display settings.
 
6. Click OK. You are now ready to work with the two monitors in PowerPoint.
You can now drag items from your primary monitor to your secondary one! This can also 
be useful outside of PowerPoint. For example, you can have two applications open at once, 
each in its own monitor window.
Setting Up a Presentation for Two Screens
If you have two monitors available, and conﬁ gured as described in the preceding section, 
you can use the following steps to help PowerPoint recognize and take advantage of these 
monitors:
 
1. Open the presentation in PowerPoint.
 
2. On the Slide Show tab, click Set Up Slide Show. The Set Up Show dialog box 
opens (Figure 18.24).
FIGURE 18.24
You can set up the show for multiple monitors in the Set Up Show dialog box.

574
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
 
3. In the Multiple Monitors section, open the Slide Show Monitor drop-down 
list and choose the monitor that the audience will see. This list shows only 
Automatic and Primary Monitor if you do not have multiple monitors enabled (see 
the preceding section). 
 
4. Select the Use Presenter View check box. This will give you a separate, very 
useful control panel on the other monitor during the show, as described in the next 
section.
 
5. Click OK. You are now ready to show the presentation using two separate 
displays — one for you and one for the audience.
Presenting with Two Screens Using Presenter View
Presenter View is a special view of the presentation that is available on systems with more 
than one monitor if you have enabled Presenter View, as described in the preceding section. 
This view provides many useful tools for managing the show behind the scenes, as shown 
in Figure 18.25. It appears automatically on the non-audience monitor when you enter Slide 
Show view.
New in PowerPoint 2013, you can experiment with Presenter View even if you don’t have multiple monitors. While in 
Slide Show view, right-click anywhere and then choose Show Presenter View.
FIGURE 18.25
Presenter View provides tools for helping you manage your slide show from a second monitor.

575
Chapter 18: Preparing for a Live Presentation
18
Here are some of the key features of Presenter View:
 
■The current slide (the one the audience is viewing) appears at the left. The next 
slide appears at the upper right.
 
■The speaker notes for each slide appear in the lower-right pane. You cannot edit 
them from here, however. Buttons for making the text larger or smaller appear 
below the speaker notes pane so you can adjust the font size.
 
■A time and duration display appears above the current slide. It tells you the cur-
rent time and how long this slide has been displayed . 
 
■Below the current slide are a series of icons that roughly correspond to the icons 
you see in Slide Show view in the lower-left corner. From left to right, they are as 
follows:
 
■Pen and Laser Pointer Tools. Opens a menu from which you can choose a pen, 
laser pointer, highlighter, or arrow and choose the ink color. You can also erase 
any annotations you have made with the Eraser tool here.
 
■See All Slides. Opens a page of thumbnail images of all the slides in the presen-
tation so you can quickly jump to the one you want.
 
■Zoom. Zooms in on a part of the slide.
 
■Black or Unblack Slide Show. Toggles between showing the slide and showing a 
black screen.
 
■More Slide Show Options. Opens a menu of additional control options. For 
example, you can hide Presenter view from here, show a black or white screen, 
show or hide ink markup, get help, or end the show.
 
■Forward and back arrows appear at the bottom of the screen; you can use these to 
move through the presentation. 
 
■At the top of the screen are three buttons:
 
■Show Taskbar. Shows or hides the Windows taskbar so you can switch out of 
Slide Show view to take care of some other task.
 
■Display Settings. Opens a menu from which you can see which monitor is dis-
playing Presenter View and which is displaying the full-screen show to the audi-
ence and switch them if you like.
 
■End Slide Show. Exits from Slide Show view.
 
■The panes are adjustable by dragging the dividers between them, so you can have 
larger thumbnails, a smaller slide display, more or less room for notes, and so on.

Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to prepare for a big presentation. You now know how to 
package a presentation and move it to another computer, how to set up single and multi-
screen audio-visual equipment to work with your laptop, and how to control a presentation 
on-screen using your computer. You also know how to jump to different slides, how to take 
notes during a meeting, and how to assign action items. You’re all set! All you need now is 
a nice starched shirt and a shoeshine.
In the next chapter, you learn about designing presentations that are user-interactive or 
self-running. You can do this by creating easy-to-use action buttons for situations in which 
you cannot be there to press the buttons yourself.

I
n the last few chapters, you’ve been learning how to build and present slide shows that support 
you as you speak to your audience directly. When you build such presentations, you design each 
slide to assist you, not duplicate your efforts. Slides designed for a live presentation typically do 
not contain a lot of detail; they function as pointers and reminders for the much more detailed live 
discussion or lecture taking place in the foreground.
When you build a self-running or user-interactive presentation, the focus is exactly the opposite. 
The slides are going out there all alone and must be capable of projecting the entire message all by 
themselves. Therefore, you want to create slides that contain much more information.
Another consideration is audience interest. When you speak to your audience live, the primary focus 
is on you and your words. The slides assist you, but the audience watches and listens primarily to 
you. Therefore, to keep the audience interested, you have to be interesting. If the slides are inter-
esting, that’s a nice bonus. With a self-running or user-interactive presentation, on the other hand, 
each slide must be fascinating. The animations and transitions that you learned about in Chapter 
16 come in very handy in creating interest, as do sounds and videos, discussed in Chapter 14 and 
Chapter 15.

578
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Another name for a self-running presentation is a kiosk presentation. This name comes from the fact that many 
self-running informational presentations are located in little buildings, or kiosks, in public areas such as malls and 
convention centers.
Understanding User Interactivity
Letting the audience take control can be scary. If you aren’t forcing people to go at a cer-
tain pace and view all the slides, what’s to guarantee that they don’t skim through quickly 
or quit halfway through?
Well, there are no guarantees. Even in a show with a live speaker, though, you can’t con-
trol whether or not people pay attention. The best you can do is put together a compelling 
presentation and hope that people want to view it. The same applies to a user-interactive 
presentation. People are either going to watch and absorb it or they’re not. There’s no 
point in treating the audience like children. On the contrary, they will likely respond 
much better if you give them the options and let them decide what content they need.
Navigational controls are the main thing that separates user-interactive presentations from 
normal ones. You have to provide an idiot-proof way for people to move from slide to slide. 
Okay, technically, yes, they could use the same navigational controls that you use when 
presenting a show (see Chapter 18, “Preparing for a Live Presentation”), but those controls 
aren’t always obvious. Moving forward is a no-brainer (click the mouse), but what about 
moving backward? Would you have guessed P for Previous if you hadn’t already known? 
Probably not. And what if they want to end the show early? The ﬁ rst half of this chapter 
shows you various techniques for creating navigational controls.
Here are some ideas for ways to use navigational controls:
 
■Web resource listings. Include a slide that lists websites that users can visit for 
more information about various topics covered in your presentation. You can also 
include cross-references to those sites throughout the presentation at the bottom of 
pertinent slides.
 
■Product information. Create a basic presentation that describes your products, 
with For More Information buttons for each product. Then create hidden slides with 
the detailed information about each product and hyperlink those slides to the For 
More Information buttons. Don’t forget to put a Return button on each hidden slide 
so that users can easily return to the main presentation.

579
Chapter 19: Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations
19
 
■Access to custom shows. If you have created custom shows, set up action buttons 
or hyperlinks that jump the users to them on request.
 
■Quizzes. Create a presentation with a series of multiple-choice questions. Create 
custom action buttons for each answer. Depending on which answer the user clicks, 
set it up to jump to either a “Congratulations, you’re right!” slide or a “Sorry, try 
again” slide. From each, include a Return button to go on with the quiz.
 
■Troubleshooting information. Ask the user a series of questions and include 
action buttons or hyperlinks for the answers. Set them up to jump to the slides 
that further narrow down the problem based on their answers until they ﬁ nally 
arrive at a slide that explains the exact problem and proposes a solution.
 
■Directories. Include a company directory with e-mail hyperlinks for various people 
or departments so that anyone reading the presentation can easily make contact.
Besides navigational controls, the other big consideration with a user-interactive show is 
distribution. How will you distribute the presentation to your audience? Some of the meth-
ods you’ve already learned about in this book will serve you well here, such as packaging 
a presentation on CD (Chapter 18, “Preparing for a Live Presentation”). Or you may choose 
instead to set up a user kiosk in a public location, e-mail the presentation ﬁ le to others, or 
make it available on the Web.
Navigational Control Basics
All navigational controls that you create on slides are, at their core, hyperlinks. You’re 
probably familiar with these already from using the Web; they’re underlined bits of text 
or specially enabled graphics that take you to a different site or page. In the case of your 
PowerPoint presentation, the hyperlinks take users to the next or previous slide, a hidden 
slide, a custom slide show, or perhaps some external source such as a website or data ﬁ le.
Types of Navigational Controls
Even though they are all hyperlinks (so they all work the same underneath), the various 
types of navigational controls can look very different on the surface. You can have “bare” 
hyperlinks that show the actual address, hyperlinks with text that is different from the 
address, action button graphics, or graphics you create or import yourself. In addition, a 
navigational control can have pop-up helper text in a ScreenTip. Figure 19.1 shows several 
types of navigational controls on a sample slide.

Graphic used as a hyperlink
Most people associate the word hyperlink with the Internet. However, a hyperlink is simply a link to somewhere else; 
it does not necessarily refer to an Internet location. You can hyperlink to another slide in the same presentation, for 
example, or to a different presentation, or even to some unrelated data fi le in another application like Word or Excel.
Notice the directions at the bottom of Figure 19.1. This is necessary because it’s not obvious 
that the graphic is a hyperlink, and users would not normally think to try clicking on it. 
Notice also the ScreenTip associated with the second text hyperlink. This is useful because 
the text itself does not provide the address, and the user may want to know the address 
before clicking the hyperlink. For example, if the PC does not have Internet access, the 
user would not want to click a hyperlink that points to a web page.
The action buttons in the bottom-right corner in Figure 19.1 are typical of the action but-
tons that PowerPoint creates. They are just AutoShapes with preassigned action settings for 
On Click. You can create your own, but the preset ones are awfully handy.
Evaluating Your Audience’s Needs
Before you dive into building an interactive presentation, you must decide how the audi-
ence will navigate from slide to slide. There is no one best way; the right decision depends 
on the audience’s comfort level with computers and hyperlinks.

581
Chapter 19: Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations
19
Consider these points:
 
■Is the audience technically savvy enough to know that they should press a key or 
click the mouse to advance the slide, or do you need to provide that instruction?
 
■Does your audience understand that the arrow action buttons mean Forward and 
Back, or do you need to explain that?
 
■Does your audience understand hyperlinks and web addresses? If they see under-
lined text, will they know that they can click it to jump elsewhere?
 
■Is it enough to include some instructions on a slide at the beginning of the show, 
or do you need to repeat the instructions on every slide?
Think about your audience’s needs and come up with a plan. Here are some sample plans:
 
■For a beginner audience. Begin the presentation with an instructional slide 
explaining how to navigate. Place action buttons in the same place on each slide 
(using the slide master) to help them move backward and forward and include a 
Help button that they can click to get more detailed instructions.
 
■For an intermediate audience. Place action buttons on the same place on each 
slide along with a brief note on the ﬁ rst slide explaining their presence.
 
■For an advanced audience. Include other action buttons on the slide that allow 
the user to jump around freely in the presentation — go to the beginning, to the 
end, to a certain section, and so on. Advanced users understand and can take 
advantage of a more sophisticated navigation system.
In the next few sections, I show you how to create all of the types of navigational controls 
shown in Figure 19.1.
Creating Text Hyperlinks
Now that you know that hyperlinks are the key to user interactivity, you will want to add 
some to your presentation. You can start with text-based hyperlinks because they’re the 
easiest. You can add either a bare hyperlink or a hyperlink with explanatory text.
Typing a Bare Hyperlink
The most basic kind of hyperlink is an Internet address, typed directly into a text box. 
When you enter text in any of the following formats, PowerPoint automatically converts it 
to a hyperlink:
 
■Web addresses. Anything that begins with http:// or www.
 
■E-mail addresses. Any string of characters with no spaces and an @ (ampersand) 
sign in the middle somewhere.
 
■FTP addresses. Anything that begins with ftp://.

582
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
You do not have to do anything special to create these hyperlinks; when you type them 
and press Enter or the spacebar, PowerPoint converts them to hyperlinks. You know the 
conversion has taken place because the text becomes underlined and a different color. (The 
exact color depends on the color scheme in use.)
Figure 19.2 shows some examples of these bare hyperlinks. I call them bare because you 
see what’s underneath them — the actual address — right there on the surface. There is 
no friendly “click here” text that the link hides behind. For example, the text support@
microsoft.com is a hyperlink that sends e-mail to that address. In contrast, a link that 
reads “Click here to send e-mail to me” and contains the same hyperlink address is not 
bare, because you do not see the address directly.
FIGURE 19.2
Some examples of bare Internet hyperlinks.
If PowerPoint does not automatically create hyperlinks, the feature may be disabled. Choose File ➪ Options. Click 
Proofi ng, and then click AutoCorrect Options. Click the AutoFormat As You Type tab, and make sure the Internet and 
Network Paths with Hyperlinks check box is marked.
FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol. It’s a method of transferring fi les via the Internet. FTP used to be a totally sepa-
rate system from the Web, but nowadays, web browsers have FTP download capabilities built in, so anyone who has a 
web browser can receive fi les via FTP.
Creating a Friendly Text Hyperlink
A friendly hyperlink is a hyperlink comprising text but not just the bare address. For 
example, in Figure 19.1, “Customer Satisfaction Surveys” is a text hyperlink. (Friendly is 
not an industry-standard technical term; it’s just one I ﬁ nd convenient for discussion in 
this book.)
You can select already-entered text and make it a hyperlink, or you can enter new text. 

583
Chapter 19: Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations
19
The steps for creating a hyperlink take you through the process generically; see the sections in “Choosing the 
Hyperlink Address” later in the chapter for specifi c information about various kinds of hyperlinks you can create.
Either way, follow these steps: 
 
1. To use existing text, select the text or its text box. Otherwise, just position the 
insertion point where you want the hyperlink.
 
2. On the Insert tab, click Hyperlink, or press Ctrl+K. The Insert Hyperlink dialog 
box opens (Figure 19.3).
FIGURE 19.3
Insert a hyperlink by typing the text to display and choosing the URL or other loca-
tion to jump to.
If the Hyperlink button is not available on the Insert tab, check to make sure you have positioned the insertion point 
in a text box or selected some text.
 
3. In the Text to Display field, type or edit the hyperlink text. This text is what 
appears underlined on the slide. Any text you’ve selected appears in this ﬁ eld by 
default; changing the text here changes it on your slide as well.
 
4. Enter the hyperlink or select it from one of the available lists. (See the follow-
ing section, “Choosing the Hyperlink Address,” to learn about your options in this 
regard.)

584
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
 
5. (Optional) If you want the ScreenTip to show something different when the 
user points the mouse at the hyperlink, click the ScreenTip button and enter 
the text for the ScreenTip. The ScreenTip is text that pops up when you hover the 
mouse over the hyperlink. See Figure 19.4. The default ScreenTip for a hyperlink is 
its address (URL) or the ﬁ le path if it is a ﬁ le stored on a local disk.
FIGURE 19.4
Enter a custom ScreenTip if desired.
 
6. Click OK to close the Set Hyperlink ScreenTip dialog box.
 
7. Click OK to accept the newly created hyperlink.
Ideally the combination of the hyperlink text and the ScreenTip should provide both the actual address and some 
friendly explanation of it. If the bare address appears as the hyperlink text, use friendly text describing the link loca-
tion as the ScreenTip. If the friendly text appears as the hyperlink text, use the actual address as the ScreenTip.
The options in step 4 for selecting the address were purposely glossed over because this is a 
rather complex topic. The various options are shown in the next sections.
Choosing the Hyperlink Address
You can use the Insert Hyperlink dialog box to create a hyperlink to any address that’s 
accessible via the computer where the presentation will run. Although many people think 
of a hyperlink as an Internet address, it can actually be a link to any ﬁ le, application, 
Internet location, or slide.
A hyperlink will not work if the person viewing the presentation does not have access to the needed fi les and pro-
grams or does not have the needed Internet or network connectivity. A hyperlink that works fi ne on your own PC might 
not work after the presentation has been transferred to the user’s PC.
You can hyperlink to any of the following items: 
 
■Other slides in the current presentation
 
■Slides in other presentations (if you provide access to those presentations)

585
Chapter 19: Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations
19
 
■Documents created in other applications (if the user has those applications 
installed and those document ﬁ les are available)
 
■Graphic ﬁ les (if the user has access to an application that can display them)
 
■Internet web pages (if the user has an Internet connection and a web browser)
 
■E-mail addresses (if the user has an Internet connection and an e-mail program)
 
■FTP site addresses (if the user has an Internet connection and a web browser or an 
FTP program)
Creating a Link to a Slide in the Current Presentation
The most common kind of link is to another slide in the same presentation. There are many 
uses for this link type; for example, you can hide several backup slides that contain extra 
information. You can then create hyperlinks on certain key slides that allow the users 
to jump to one of those hidden slides to peruse the extra facts. To create a hyperlink to 
another slide, follow these steps:
 
1. Start the hyperlink normally (on the Insert tab, click Hyperlink).
 
2. In the Insert Hyperlink dialog box, click Place in This Document. The dialog box 
controls change to show a list of the slides in the presentation (see Figure 19.5).
FIGURE 19.5
Select the slide that the hyperlink should refer to.
Click here to select

Select the desired slide.
 
3. Select the slide or custom show that you want.
 
4. Click OK.

586
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
If you are choosing a custom show and you want the presentation to continue from the original spot after show-
ing this custom show, mark the Show and Return check box (see Figure 19.5). This check box is not available for 
individual slides. For an individual slide, put a Return action button on it to return to the previously viewed slide. 
Hyperlinking to custom shows and using the Show and Return feature instead of linking to individual slides helps to 
avoid jumping to the next slide after the hyperlinked slide. See the section “Creating Your Own Action Buttons” later 
in this chapter.
Creating a Link to a Website or FTP Site
If you want to link to a website or FTP site, you can simply type the address directly into 
any text box. Alternatively, you can use the Insert Hyperlink command to create the link. 
When the Insert Hyperlink dialog box is open, if you don’t know the address you want to 
refer to, you can browse for it. Here’s how:
 
1. Leaving the Insert Hyperlink dialog box open, switch out of PowerPoint and 
back to Windows.
 
2. Open a web browser and navigate to the page to which you want to refer.
 
3. Switch back to PowerPoint. The address is ﬁ lled in for you in the Address box.
 
4. Continue creating the hyperlink normally.
You can also copy and paste a URL into the Address box, or choose a page from the Browsed Pages list.
Creating a Link to a File on Your Hard Disk or Network
You can also create a hyperlink to any ﬁ le available on your PC’s hard disk or on your local 
area network. This can be a PowerPoint ﬁ le or a data ﬁ le from any other program, such as a 
Word document or an Excel spreadsheet. Or, if you don’t want to open a particular data ﬁ le, 
you can hyperlink to the program ﬁ le itself so that the other application simply opens.
For example, perhaps you have some detailed documentation for your product in Adobe 
Acrobat format (PDF). This type of document requires the Adobe Acrobat Reader. So you 
can create a hyperlink with the text “Click here to read the documentation” and link to the 
appropriate PDF ﬁ le. When your audience member clicks that link, Adobe Acrobat Reader 
opens and the documentation displays.
Remember that not everyone has the same applications installed that you do. For example, although Adobe Acrobat 
Reader is free, many people don’t have it installed yet. You might want to add another hyperlink or button to your 
slide that users can click to download a free viewer for the application’s data from the Web if needed.

587
Chapter 19: Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations
19
To link to a data ﬁ le, start the hyperlink normally (on the Insert tab, click Hyperlink) and 
click Existing File or Web Page if that is not already selected. Then do one of the following:
 
■Click Current Folder to display a ﬁ le management interface from which you can 
select any folder or drive on your system. You can open the Look In list and choose 
Computer to start from the top level of your drive/folder structure and then navi-
gate to the location containing the ﬁ le and select it. See Figure 19.6.
FIGURE 19.6
You can browse fi les on your hard disk by choosing Current Folder and then setting 
Look In to Computer.
Choose Computer.
Select Current Folder.
Double-click a drive to view its content.
 
■Click Recent Files to display a list of the ﬁ les you have recently opened on your PC 
(all types), and click the ﬁ le you want from the list.
Complete the hyperlink normally from that point. You are not limited to only a folder on 
your local drives if you choose Current Folder; you can open the Look In list and choose My 
Network Places to browse the network. However, make sure the PC on which the presenta-
tion will be displayed will also have access to this same location.
Creating a Link to an Application for Creating a New Document
Perhaps you want the audience to be able to create a new document by clicking a hyper-
link. For example, perhaps you would like them to be able to provide information about 
their experience with your Customer Service department. One way to do this is to let them 
create a new document using a program that they have on their system, such as a word 
processor.

588
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Keep in mind that not everyone will have the same applications you do. A new document hyperlink will not work if the 
user does not have an appropriate application for creating that fi le type.
To create a link that creates a new document in an application, start the hyperlink nor-
mally. Click the Create New Document button, and the controls in the Insert Hyperlink dia-
log box change to those shown in Figure 19.7.
FIGURE 19.7
You can create a new document with a hyperlink.
Click Create
New Document.
Type name for new document here.
Enter the name of the new document that you want the user to create. The type of docu-
ment created depends on the ﬁ lename extension you include. For example, to create a Word 
document, use the .doc or .docx extension. See Table 19.1 for other ﬁ lename extensions. 
If the path where it should be stored is not correct in the Full Path area, click the Change 
button. Navigate to the desired location, and click OK to return. Then click Edit the New 
Document Later and ﬁ nish up normally.
If you provide this presentation to multiple users, each one will use the same fi lename for the new document. This 
can be a problem because one fi le may overwrite another. It might be easier to collect information from multiple 
users using an e-mail address hyperlink (discussed later in this chapter).
The most important part about adding a link to create a new ﬁ le is to make sure you use a 
ﬁ lename extension that corresponds to a program that users have on the PCs where they 

589
Chapter 19: Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations
19
will be viewing the presentation. When a program is installed, it registers its extension 
(the usually-three-character code after the period in a ﬁ le’s name) in the Windows Registry 
so that any data ﬁ les with a name that includes the extension are associated with that 
program. For example, when you install Microsoft Word, it registers the extension .docx 
for itself, and PowerPoint registers .pptx for its own use. Table 19.1 lists some of the more 
common ﬁ le types and their registered ﬁ lename extensions on most PCs. Also make sure 
that the location you specify for the full path will always be accessible whenever the pre-
sentation is run.
If you need to hyperlink to an executable fi le but you do not need a new document (for example, to link to a pro-
gram like Calculator), do not use Hyperlink on the Insert tab. Instead, click Action on the Insert tab and choose Run 
Program as the action. For the program to run, use the full path to the application, in quotation marks. Because you 
must enter the full path to each of these, the link will probably not work when the presentation is run on a different 
computer.
TABLE 19.1  Commonly Used Extensions for Popular Programs
Filename Extension
Associated Program
.docx, .docm, .doc
Microsoft Word, or WordPad if Word is not installed. Use for docu-
ments if you are not sure whether your audience has Word but you 
are sure they at least have Windows 95. The Word 2007 format is 
.docx, and .docm is the macro-enabled version of that. The format 
for Word 2003 and earlier is .doc.
.txt
Notepad, a plain text editor. Creates text fi les without any formatting. 
Not the fi rst choice for documents unless you specifi cally need them 
to be without formatting.
.rtf
Rich Text format, a fl exible, application-independent word process-
ing format. It works in WordPad (the free word processor in Windows) 
and also in most other word processing programs, including Word 
and WordPerfect. This is a good choice if you don’t know which word 
processing program is installed on the PC.
.bmp
Microsoft Paint (which comes free with Windows) or some other more 
sophisticated graphics program if one is installed.
.mdb
Microsoft Access, a database program.
.mpp
Microsoft Project, a project management program.
.pptx or .ppt
Microsoft PowerPoint (you know what that is!). The 2007 version is 
.pptx; the version for 2003 and earlier is .ppt.
.xlsx, .xlsm, .xls
Microsoft Excel, a spreadsheet program. The extensions .xlsx and 
.xlsm are the 2007 versions (non–macro enabled and macro 
enabled, respectively) and .xls is the 2003 and earlier version.

590
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Creating a Link to an E-Mail Address
You can also create a link that opens the user’s e-mail program and addresses an e-mail to a 
certain recipient. For example, perhaps you want users to e-mail feedback to you about how 
they liked your presentation or send you requests for more information about your product.
For an e-mail hyperlink to work, the person viewing the presentation must have an e-mail application installed on 
their PC and at least one e-mail account confi gured for sending e-mail. This isn’t always a given, but it’s probably 
more likely than betting that they have a certain application installed.
To create an e-mail hyperlink, either type the e-mail address directly into the text box on 
the slide (for a bare hyperlink) or start a hyperlink normally with the Hyperlink button on 
the Insert tab. Then click the E-mail Address button in the dialog box and ﬁ ll in the e-mail 
address and an optional subject line. PowerPoint will automatically add mailto: in front 
of the address. Then complete the hyperlink normally. See Figure 19.8.
FIGURE 19.8

Editing or Removing a Hyperlink
If you need to change the displayed text for the hyperlink, simply edit it just as you do any 
text on a slide. Move the insertion point into it and press Backspace or Delete to remove 
characters, and then retype new ones.
If you need to change the address, or the ScreenTip, right-click the hyperlink and choose 
Edit Hyperlink. The Edit Hyperlink dialog box appears, which is identical to the Add 
Hyperlink dialog box except for the name. From there you can change any properties of the 
link, just as you did when you created it initially.
To remove a hyperlink, you can either delete the text completely (select it and press Delete) 
or just remove the hyperlink from the text, leaving the text intact. To do the latter, right-
click the hyperlink and choose Remove Hyperlink. 
Creating Graphical Hyperlinks
There are two ways to create a graphics-based hyperlink. Both involve skills that you 
have already learned in this chapter. Both work equally well, but you may ﬁ nd that you 
prefer one to the other. The Action Settings method is a little bit simpler, but the Insert 
Hyperlink method allows you to browse for web addresses more easily.
Creating a Graphical Hyperlink with Action Settings
A graphics-based hyperlink is really no more than a graphic with an action setting attached 
to it. You set it up just as you do with the action buttons (which you will learn more about 
later in this chapter), by following these steps:
 
1. Place the graphic that you want to use for a hyperlink.
 
2. Click the graphic, and then on the Insert tab, click Action. The Action Settings 
dialog box opens.
 
3. Choose Hyperlink To.
 
4. Open the Hyperlink To drop-down list and choose URL. The Hyperlink to URL 
dialog box opens.
 
5. Type the URL to link to and click OK as shown in Figure 19.9.

592
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
FIGURE 19.9
You can create a hyperlink via an action setting.
If you are using an e-mail address, type mailto: in front of the address you enter when creating the hyperlink. If 
you do not, PowerPoint will automatically add http:// in front of it and the link will not work.
 
6. Click OK in the Action Settings dialog box.
Now the graphic functions just like an action button in the presentation; the audience can 
click it to jump to the speciﬁ ed location.
Creating a Graphical Hyperlink with Insert Hyperlink
If you would like to take advantage of the superior address-browsing capabilities of the 
Insert Hyperlink dialog box when setting up a graphical hyperlink, follow these steps 
instead of the preceding ones:
 
1. Place the graphic that you want to use for a hyperlink.
 
2. Right-click it and choose Hyperlink, or choose Insert ➪ Links ➪ Hyperlink 
from the Ribbon. The Insert Hyperlink dialog box appears.
 
3. Choose the location, as you learned earlier in this chapter for text-based 
hyperlinks. The only difference is that the Text to Display box is unavailable 
because there is no text. If you typed the text in a graphic, Text to Display is 
available.
 
4. Click OK.

Using Action Buttons
Action buttons, which you saw in Figure 19.1, enable your audience members to move from 
slide to slide in the presentation with a minimum of fuss. PowerPoint provides many preset 
action buttons that already have hyperlinks assigned to them, so all you have to do is place 
them on your slides.
The action buttons that come with PowerPoint are shown in Table 19.2 along with their 
preset hyperlinks. As you can see, some of them are all ready to go; others require you to 
specify the jump destination. Most of the buttons have a default action assigned to them, 
but you can change any of these as needed.
At fi rst glance, there seems little reason to use action buttons that simply move the slide show forward and back-
ward. After all, isn’t it just as easy to use the keyboard’s Page Up and Page Down keys or to click the left mouse 
button to advance to the next slide? Well, yes, but if you use Kiosk mode, described later in the chapter, you cannot 
move from slide to slide using any of the conventional keyboard or mouse methods. The only thing the mouse can do 
is click action buttons and hyperlinks.

Placing an Action Button on a Slide
To place an action button, follow these steps:
 
1. If you want to place the button on the slide master, display it (on the View tab, 
click Slide Master). If you want to place the button on all layouts, click the top 
slide (the slide master itself). If you want only a certain layout to receive the but-
tons, click it.
Some action buttons are best placed on the slide master, such as Next and Previous; others, such as Return, are 
special-use buttons that are best placed on individual slides such as hidden slides.
 
2. On the Insert or Home tab, click Shapes. A palette of shapes appears; at the bot-
tom of the palette are the action buttons, as shown in Figure 19.10.
TABLE 19.2   (continued)

595

3. Click the button that you want to place. Your mouse pointer turns into a 
crosshair.
 
4. To create a button of a specific size, drag on the slide (or slide master) where 
you want it to go. Or, to create a button of a default size, simply click once where 
you want to place it. You can resize the button at any time later, the same as you 
can any object.
If you want to place several buttons, and you want them all to be the same size, place them at the default size to 
begin with. Then select them all, and resize them as a group. That way they will all be exactly the same size.

596
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
 
5. The Action Settings dialog box appears. Make sure the Mouse Click tab is on top, 
as shown in Figure 19.11.
FIGURE 19.11
Specify what should happen when you click the action button.
 
6. Confirm or change the hyperlink set up there: 
 
■If the action button should take the reader to a speciﬁ c location, make sure the 
correct slide appears in the Hyperlink To box. Refer to Table 19.2 in the preced-
ing section to see the default setting for each action button. Table 19.3 lists the 
choices you can make and what they do.
 
■If the action button should run a program, choose Run Program and enter the 
program’s name and path, or click Browse to locate it. For example, you could 
open the Calculator application from an action button. The executable ﬁ le that 
runs it is calc.exe.
 
■If the action button should play a sound, make sure the Play Sound check box 
is marked, and choose the correct sound from the Play Sound drop-down list (or 
pick a different sound ﬁ le by choosing Other Sound). 
 
7. Click OK. The button has been assigned the action you speciﬁ ed.
 
8. Add more action buttons as desired by repeating these steps.
 
9. If you are working in Slide Master view, exit it by clicking the Close Master 
View button.
 
10. Test your action buttons in Slide Show view to make sure they jump where you 
want them to.

opening a specifi c fi le in it, use the Run Program option in 
the Action Settings dialog box instead of Hyperlink To.)
Adding Text to a Blank Action Button
The blank action button you saw in Table 19.2 can be very useful. You can place several of 
them on a slide and type text into them, creating your own set of buttons. To type text 
into a blank button, follow these steps:
 
1. Place a blank action button on the slide (from the Shapes gallery).
 
2. Right-click the action button and choose Edit Text. An insertion point appears in 
it. (You can also select the button and simply start typing.)

598
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
 
3. Type your text, and then click away from the button when you are finished. If 
you need to edit the text later, simply click the text to move the insertion point 
back into it, just as you do with any text box.
Formatting and Changing the Shape of an Action Button
You can format action buttons just as you can other shapes, as you learned to do in Chapter 
9, “Drawing and Formatting Objects.” You can apply borders, ﬁ lls, and effects to them and 
apply Shape Style presets. You can also use WordArt styles or individual text formatting 
controls to format the text on them.
To make action buttons of different shapes, you can use the Change Shape button, as in the 
following steps:
 
1. Select the action button(s) to change.
 
2. On the Drawing Tools Format tab, click Insert Shapes ➪ Edit Shape ➪ Change 
Shape.
 
3. Click a different shape.
Figure 19.12 shows some examples of custom buttons you can create with your own text 
and some shape formatting.
FIGURE 19.12
You can create any of these sets of action buttons by typing and formatting text on 
blank buttons.
Creating Your Own Action Buttons
You can create an action button out of any object on your slide: a drawn shape, a piece 
of clip art, a photograph, a text box — anything. To do so, from the Insert tab just click 
Action. Then, set the On Click action to Hyperlink To, Run Program, or Play Sound, just as 
you did for the action buttons in the preceding sections.
Make sure you clearly label the object that you are using as an action button so that the 
users will know what they are getting when they click it. You can add text to the object 

599
Chapter 19: Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations
19
directly (for example, with an AutoShape), or you can add a text box next to the button 
that explains its function. If you want to use a ScreenTip to label the item, use a hyperlink 
rather than an action setting.
Creating Self-Running Presentations
Self-running presentations are not exactly user interactive because the user does not par-
ticipate in their running. The show runs at its own pace and the user sits (or stands) pas-
sively and observes it.
Not sure when you might use a self-running presentation in your daily life? Here are some 
ideas:
 
■Trade shows. A self-running presentation outlining your product or service can 
run continuously in your booth on equipment as simple as a laptop and an external 
monitor. People who might not feel comfortable talking to a salesperson may stop a 
few moments to watch a colorful, multimedia slide show.
 
■Conventions. Trying to provide hundreds of convention-goers with some basic 
information, such as session starting times or cocktail party locations? Set up an 
information booth in the convention center lobby to provide this information. The 
slide show can loop endlessly through three or four slides that contain meeting 
room locations, schedules, and other critical data.
 
■In-store sales. Retail stores can increase sales by strategically placing PC monitors 
in areas of the store where customers gather. For example, if there is a line where 
customers stand waiting for the next available register or clerk, you can show those 
waiting customers a few slides that describe the beneﬁ ts of extended warranties or 
that detail the special sales of the week.
 
■Waiting areas. Auto repair shops and other places where customers wait for some-
thing to be done provide excellent sales opportunities. The customers don’t have 
anything to do except sit and wait, so they will watch just about anything — 
including a slide presentation informing them of the other services that your shop 
provides.
The most important aspect of a self-running show is that it loops continuously until you 
stop it. This is important because there won’t be anyone there to restart it each time it ends.
To set up the show to do just that, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Slide Show tab, click Set Up Slide Show. The Set Up Show dialog box 
opens.
 
2. Mark the Loop Continuously until ‘Esc’ check box. See Figure 19.13. Notice that 
the Loop Continuously until ‘Esc’ check box is set permanently to On whenever 
Browsed at a Kiosk is selected.

600

FIGURE 19.13
Tell PowerPoint that this show should loop continuously.
Mark this checkbox
to loop the presentation.
 
3. In the Advance Slides area, make sure the Using Timings, if Present option is 
selected.
 
4. Click OK.
 
 Timings refers to transition timings, which you learned about in Chapter 16, “Creating Animation Effects 
and Transitions,” in the section “Assigning Transitions to Slides.” Self-running presentations are good 
candidates for recorded voice-over narration, which you learned how to set up in Chapter 14, “Adding 
Sound Effects, Music, and Soundtracks.”
Recording Narration and Timings
When creating a self-running presentation, you may want to record some voice-over narra-
tion to accompany all or some of the slides. That way, when people watch the presentation, 
they will hear your voice as if they were watching and listening to you in person.
To record narration, you will need a microphone that attaches to your computer, and your 
computer must have a microphone jack to plug it into.
In PowerPoint 2013 you can record not only narration but also animation and transition 
timings and laser pointer movements. Together all these recorded extras make the presen-
tation ﬁ le you distribute imitate more closely a live show.
The Laser Pointer option appears as a colored dot on-screen like a real laser pointer. To use 
it during Slide Show view, hold down the Ctrl key and click the mouse. To switch the mouse 

601
Chapter 19: Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations
19
to a laser pointer without having to hold down Ctrl, click the Pointers button in the lower-
left corner of the screen in Slide Show view and click Laser Pointer. To change the laser 
pointer’s color, choose Slide Show ➪ Set Up ➪ Set Up Show and select a color from the Laser 
Pointer Color drop-down palette (see Figure 19.13). You cannot change the laser pointer 
color from the Pointers menu in Slide Show view.
Setting Up the Microphone
The ﬁ rst time you record narration, you will probably need to conﬁ gure your microphone to 
make sure the volume level is set appropriately. 
First, make sure the microphone is enabled. Here’s how:
 
1. Open the Control Panel in Windows. In Windows 8, choose the Settings charm and 
then click Control Panel; in Windows 7, choose Control Panel from the Start menu. 
 
2. Click Hardware and Sound.
 
3. Under the Sound heading, click Manage Audio Devices. The Sound dialog box 
opens.
 
4. Click the Recording tab. A list of available microphones appears here. (You might 
have only one.) See Figure 19.14.
FIGURE 19.14
Select the microphone you want to use, and make it the default device.

602
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
If you don’t see Hardware and Sound as a category in Control Panel, you are probably not in Category view. On the 
upper-left part of the Control Panel window, click Category view.
 
5. If you have more than one microphone listed, make sure the one you want to 
use is set as the default device. (Right-click it and choose Set as Default Device, 
or click it and then click Set Default. If it is already the default, the command is 
unavailable.)
 
6. Select the microphone and then click Configure. The Speech Recognition section 
of Control Panel opens.
 
7. Click Set Up Microphone. The Microphone Setup Wizard runs (Figure 19.15).

Recording the Presentation
When you record the presentation, you are recording several things at once: narration, 
transition and animation timing, and laser pointer movements.
You can do all your recording in a single pass, but if you ﬂ ub the narration for a slide, keep 
going and don’t start over because you can go back and rerecord the narration for a par-
ticular slide later.
Follow these steps to record the presentation:
 
1. Plug the microphone into your Mic port on your computer, and test it to make 
sure it is working.
 
2. Choose Slide Show ➪ Set Up ➪ Record Slide Show. (Click the top part of the but-
ton, not the arrow beneath it.) The Record Slide Show dialog box appears. It con-
tains two check boxes: 
 
■Slide and Animation Timings
 
■Narrations and Laser Pointer
 
3. Leave both check marks selected (to record all of those things) and click Start 
Recording to begin the recording. 
The presentation opens in Slide Show view, with a Recording ﬂ oating toolbar in the 
upper-left corner, as shown in Figure 19.16.
FIGURE 19.16
Record both narration and timings in a single pass.
Repeat (rerecord

Pause Recording
 
4. Speak into the microphone to narrate the first slide. When you are ready to 
move to the next slide, click the mouse. 
If you make a mistake on a slide, you can click the Repeat button (see Figure 19.16) 
to start that slide over. Alternatively, you can just go on to the next slide; you can 
rerecord the narration for individual slides later.
 
5. Move slide by slide through the presentation until you have recorded all the 
narration. 

604
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
When you reach the last slide, the presentation switches to Slide Sorter view. Under 
each slide is information about what was recorded, as shown in Figure 19.17. 
 
■Star indicates that there is a transition or animation effect.
 
■Time shows the total amount of time that slide will remain on-screen.
 
■Speaker indicates that there is recorded narration for that slide.
FIGURE 19.17

Rerecording Narration for Certain Slides
It’s very hard to get all the narration recorded correctly in a single try! Most people have to 
go back and rerecord the narration for at least one slide. To rerecord narration for only part 
of the presentation, follow these steps:
 
1. In Normal view, select the slide you want to rerecord.
 
2. Choose Slide Show ➪ Record Slide Show ➪ Start Recording from Current Slide.
 
3. Click Start Recording.
 
4. Record the narration for that slide.
 
5. Continue on to other slides by clicking through the presentation normally, or 
press Esc if you don’t want to record narration for the next slides.
Removing Narration
You can remove the narration either from individual slides or from the entire presentation:
 
■To remove narration from a single slide, select it and then choose Slide Show ➪ Set 
Up ➪ Record Slide Show ➪ Clear ➪ Clear Narration on Current Slide.
 
■To remove narration from all slides, choose Slide Show ➪ Set Up ➪ Record Slide 
Show ➪ Clear ➪ Clear Narrations on All Slides.

605
Chapter 19: Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations

You can also delete the speaker icon from the lower-right corner of a slide to remove its 
narration.
Using Kiosk Mode
A kiosk is a self-serve booth or workstation where people can view something without 
supervision. You have probably seen information kiosks at malls, for example, where users 
can click or touch buttons on-screen to get information.
When providing a computer to operate unattended to the public, one major concern is that 
some prankster will come along and tamper with the system. You will learn about some 
ways to thwart that kind of tampering in the next section, “Setting Up a Secure System,” 
but ﬁ rst let’s look at one really basic thing you can do: Enable Kiosk mode.
When Kiosk mode is enabled, keyboard navigation is not possible (except for pressing Esc 
to exit Slide Show view), so users must employ the action buttons and hyperlinks on the 
slides for navigation. If you place a presentation in Kiosk mode and then hide the key-
board, users will only be able to view the content to which you have linked.
To enable Kiosk mode, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Slide Show tab, click Set Up Slide Show. The Set Up Show dialog box 
opens (see Figure 19.18).
FIGURE 19.18
Set up the slide show for Kiosk mode.

2. In the Show Type area, click Browsed at a Kiosk (Full Screen).
 
3. Click OK.
Setting Up a Secure System
Security is a deﬁ nite concern in self-running presentations. Anytime you leave a computer 
unattended with the public, you run the risk of tampering and theft. At the very least, 
some guru geek will come along and experiment with your PC to see what you’ve got and 
whether they can do anything clever with it. At the worst, your entire computer setup 
could disappear entirely.
There are two levels of security involved in unattended presentation situations:
 
■The security of the physical hardware
 
■The security that the presentation will continue to run
Securing Your Hardware
For the most foolproof hardware security, get it out of sight. Hide everything except the 
monitor in a locked drawer, cabinet, or panel of the kiosk you are using, if possible. If you 
are at a trade show or convention where you don’t have the luxury of a lockable system, at 
least put everything except the monitor under a table, and try to make sure that someone 
is attending the booth at all times.
Don’t drape running computers with cloth or any other material that inhibits the airfl ow around them; doing so 
increases the risk of overheating.
In an unattended setting, the best way to protect your monitor from walking off is to place 
it behind a Plexiglas panel where nobody can touch it. Without such a barrier, you run the 
risk of some jokester turning off its power or turning down its contrast, and anyone who 
knows something about computers could walk right up and disconnect it and carry it away.
You can also buy various locking cables at computer stores and ofﬁ ce supply centers. These 
cables lock down computer equipment to prevent it from being removed. They include steel 
cables with padlocks, metal locking brackets, and electronically controlled magnetic locks.
Making Sure the Presentation Continues to Run
I admit that I am guilty of disrupting other people’s presentations. When I walk up to an 
unattended computer in a store, the ﬁ rst thing I do is abort whatever program is running 

607
Chapter 19: Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations
19
and restart the system to check out its diagnostics and ﬁ nd out what kind of computer it 
is. It’s a geek thing, but all geeks do it.
You will doubtless encounter such geeks wherever you set up your presentation, but espe-
cially at trade shows and conventions. (We geeks love trade shows and conventions.) Your 
mission is to prevent them from stopping your presentation.
The best way to prevent someone from tinkering with your presentation is to get the input 
devices out of sight. Hide the CPU (the main box of the computer), the keyboard, and 
the mouse. If the PC uses USB for keyboard and mouse, you can safely disconnect them 
while the computer is running; with older-style keyboard and mouse connectors, you can’t 
because an error message appears when you do so that interferes with the show. If you 
must keep the keyboard or mouse connected, don’t cover them with anything that might 
restrict the airﬂ ow or you might end up with an overheated PC. You can also set up the fol-
lowing security measures in your presentation ﬁ le:
 
■On the Slide Show tab, click Set Up Slide Show and make sure you have chosen 
Browsed at a Kiosk. This disables the ability to advance the presentation on mouse 
click while the slide show is running. The only way to stop the show will be to use 
the keyboard. This works best for self-running shows where the slides advance 
automatically.
If you make the keyboard available for user navigation, the Esc key will also be available for stopping the program. A 
utility is available that disables the Esc key at www.mvps.org/skp/noesc.htm.
 
■Show the presentation using the PowerPoint Viewer program rather than 
PowerPoint itself. That way nobody can access PowerPoint and create a new presen-
tation to show. For further security, remove the PowerPoint application completely 
from the PC on which the presentation is showing. The PowerPoint Viewer does 
not come with PowerPoint 2013, but it can be downloaded for free. Go to http://
office.microsoft.com and search for PowerPoint Viewer. Set a startup pass-
word for your PC so that if people manage to reboot it, they won’t get into your PC 
to tamper with its settings. This is usually set through the BIOS setup program. If 
you can’t do that, s et a Windows startup password for each of the user accounts. 
(Do that through User Accounts in Control Panel in Windows.)
 
■Assign a password to a PowerPoint ﬁ le, as you learned in Chapter 2, “Creating and 
Saving Presentation Files,” to prevent it from being opened, modiﬁ ed, or both. 
Although this will not prevent a running presentation from being stopped, it will at 
least prevent it from being altered or deleted. However, if it is already open, hack-
ers will have full access to it, and if you set it to have a password only for modiﬁ ca-
tions, a hacker could save it under a different name, make changes, and then run 
the changed version.

Summary
In this chapter, you learned the ins and outs of preparing a presentation that users can 
run interactively or that can run unattended without user interaction. You learned how to 
create action buttons and how to set up Kiosk mode and create a secure presentation system 
that can be left unattended. You can probably think of some uses for such shows, and even 
more may occur to you later. In the next chapter, you learn how to prepare a presentation — 
either a user-interactive one or a self-running one — for mass distribution on CD or over 
the Web.

W
hen preparing a presentation that you will send out into the world, whether through 
e-mail, on CD, or on the Web, you never know what will happen to it or how people will end 
up viewing or even changing it. This can be a little unnerving!
In this chapter, you will learn how to protect your privacy by removing personal information from 
a PowerPoint ﬁ le. You will also learn how to ensure that the presentation contains nothing that 
will be incompatible with an earlier version of PowerPoint. And you will learn how to distribute a 
presentation as a PDF ﬁ le, on CD or DVD, or as a video clip on a web page or attached to an e-mail 
message.
Working with File Properties
The properties of a ﬁ le include ﬁ xed attributes such as its creation date and size as well as proper-
ties that you can edit, such as the author name, keywords, subject, and comments. Some of these 
variable properties are also referred to as metadata — literally, data about data.

610
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
PowerPoint automatically saves some properties for you, such as the author name, and pro-
vides opportunities for you to save additional properties. Properties can be helpful when 
you are searching for a certain ﬁ le or maintaining a presentation library, as discussed in 
Chapter 21, “Sharing and Collaborating.” However, when you are distributing a presentation 
widely, you might prefer to remove some or all of its properties to preserve your privacy.
Changing a File’s Properties
To add or change a ﬁ le’s properties, open the File menu. On the right side of the Info tab, 
click Properties. On the menu that appears, choose Show Document Panel.
You can then add, delete, or change the ﬁ le’s document properties, as shown in Figure 20.1. 
To close the Document Properties panel, click the X in its upper-right corner. 
FIGURE 20.1
Use the Document Properties panel to assign or change document metadata.
You can ﬁ nd the following properties in the Document Properties panel:
 
■Author. Filled in automatically from the username that you speciﬁ ed when you 
installed Ofﬁ ce.
 
■Title. By default, the title is the ﬁ rst line of the document.
 
■Subject, Keywords, Category, and Status. By default, these ﬁ elds are empty, but 
you can specify your own information and settings.
The author’s name is automatically added to each fi le that you create in PowerPoint based on the username that you 
specifi ed when you installed Offi ce. To change this name, choose File ➪ Options, click General, and then change the 
entry in the User Name box.
You can also display a Properties dialog box for the ﬁ le, in which you can set advanced 
properties. To do this, click the down arrow next to Document Properties on the Document 
Properties panel (Figure 20.1), and on the menu that opens, click Advanced Properties. 
Alternatively, you can open the File menu again and once again click Properties on the 
right side of the Info tab. On the menu that appears, choose Advanced Properties.
The Properties dialog box is the same dialog box that you would see if you right-clicked 
the ﬁ le and then clicked Properties from outside of PowerPoint (that is, from File Explorer 

611
Chapter 20: Preparing a Presentation for Mass Distribution
20
in Windows 8 or Windows Explorer in Windows 7). This dialog box contains the following 
tabs:
 
■General. Uneditable data about the ﬁ le, such as its type, location, size, and operat-
ing system attributes — for example, read-only and hidden.
 
■Summary. A continuation of the Document Properties panel, with additional prop-
erties that you can specify or change, as shown in Figure 20.2.
FIGURE 20.2
The Summary tab of the Properties dialog box contains additional property fi elds.
 
■Statistics. Another page of uneditable data, this one relating to statistical analysis 
of the presentation, such as number of slides, number of words, number of revi-
sions, and total editing time.
 
■Contents. Still more uneditable data. This data includes the fonts that are used, 
the theme, and the titles of the slides.
 
■Custom. A tab where you can set some of the less-common properties for the ﬁ le.
You can deﬁ ne custom properties in the Custom tab. Custom properties are special-purpose 
ﬁ elds that you can add when you need them. To set a custom property, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Custom tab, click the property from the Name list that you want to use.
 
2. Open the Type drop-down list and select the type of data that it should hold. 
The default is Text, which accepts any input.

612
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
 
3. In the Value field, type the desired value for this property.
 
4. Click Add to add the property, type, and value to the Properties list, as shown 
in Figure 20.3. 
FIGURE 20.3
Set a custom property in the Custom tab.
 
5. Repeat steps 1 to 4 to add more custom properties, if needed; then click OK.
Removing Personal Information from a File
Before you distribute a PowerPoint ﬁ le, you might want to remove some of the properties 
from it that contain sensitive information. For example, if you have entered conﬁ dential 
information about a client in the Comments property, you may not want the client or oth-
ers to see it.
If you can remember all of the properties that you set for the ﬁ le, then you can go back in 
and remove them manually, as you learned in the preceding section. However, it is much 
easier to use the Document Inspector feature in PowerPoint to remove personal information 
from the ﬁ le. Follow these steps:
 
1. If you have made any changes to the presentation since it was last saved, save 
it again.
 
2. Choose File ➪ Info ➪ Check for Issues ➪ Inspect Document. The Document 
Inspector dialog box opens (Figure 20.4).

613
Chapter 20: Preparing a Presentation for Mass Distribution
20
FIGURE 20.4
Inspect the presentation for information that you might want to remove.
 
3. Select or deselect the check boxes for the various types of information that 
you want to look for. The personal information contained in properties falls under 
the Document Properties and Personal Information category.
 
4. Click Inspect.
 
5. Review the inspection results. Categories in which items have been found display 
their ﬁ ndings; categories in which no items have been found appear with check 
marks, as shown in Figure 20.5.
 
6. For each category that you want to clear, click Remove All.
 
7. When you are finished, click Reinspect to check the document again, or click 
Close to end the process.
Be careful that you don’t remove hidden objects you want to keep or strip all the speaker notes out of a presentation 
unintentionally. One way to ensure that you don’t do this is to perform the inspection on a copy of the presentation, 
not the original.

614
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience

Checking for Compatibility and Usability
Before you send your presentation off to a remote audience, think about what their needs 
might be. Do they have an earlier version of PowerPoint than you do? Do some of them have 
disabilities that might make it difﬁ cult for them to view your presentation? In the follow-
ing sections, you’ll learn about some features that can help you make your presentation 
more accessible to a wider audience without very much extra work on your part.
Assessing Prior-Version Compatibility
If you plan to share your presentation with people who have earlier versions of PowerPoint, 
you need to send it to them in a format that they can display and edit. The “display” part 
is actually easier than the “edit” part because, generally speaking, when you convert a 
modern PowerPoint ﬁ le to PowerPoint 97-2003 format, it retains most of its original appear-
ance, from a Slide Show view perspective. However, editing some of the content in the 
presentation is a different matter. When an object that’s available only in PowerPoint 2007 
and higher, such as a SmartArt diagram or chart, is saved in 97-2003 format, PowerPoint 
converts it to a graphic. It looks the same as it always did, but you cannot edit the object 
in an earlier version as the type of content that it actually is.

615
Chapter 20: Preparing a Presentation for Mass Distribution
20
If you plan to share a presentation ﬁ le with someone who will need to edit it, it is a good 
idea to run the Compatibility Checker to ﬁ nd out exactly which parts of the presentation 
may cause a problem. To run the Compatibility Checker, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Info ➪ Check for Issues ➪ Check Compatibility. The Microsoft 
PowerPoint Compatibility Checker dialog box appears (Figure 20.6).
FIGURE 20.6
Find out about potential problems that may occur when sharing the fi le in 
PowerPoint 97-2003 format.
 
2. Read the summary information that appears. If you do not understand one of 
the messages, click its Help link to open a help document that explains it.
 
3. (Optional) To specify whether this check runs automatically when you save in 
PowerPoint 97-2003 format, select or deselect the Check Compatibility When 
Saving in PowerPoint 97-2003 Formats check box.
 
4. Click OK.
Embedded video in a presentation will play in PowerPoint 2007, even though PowerPoint 2007 does not support 
inserting and modifying embedded video. Embedded video will not play in PowerPoint 2003. If you save a presenta-
tion containing embedded video in PowerPoint 97-2003 format, the video clips are saved as pictures.
Checking Accessibility
Accessibility refers to the ease with which someone using assistive technology is able to 
navigate and use your data ﬁ les. For example, if someone has a visual impairment, how 
easy will it be for them to understand images on the slides? If someone cannot hear, will 
they miss out on important points in your presentation that are audio-only?

616
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
To check accessibility, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Info ➪ Check for Issues ➪ Check Accessibility. The Accessibility 
Checker task pane appears (Figure 20.7).
FIGURE 20.7
Find out about potential problems that may occur when people using assistive 
technology view your presentation.

2. Click one of the problems found, and view the suggestion at the bottom of the 
pane. Implement the suggestion if desired by following its steps.
 
3. Repeat step 2 for each problem found.
Persons who work for or are funded by the American Federal Government are required to make all fi les accessible 
by law under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. See http://www.section508.gov for details. Check out 
the STAMP add-in for PowerPoint that captions audio and video at http://www.microsoft.com/enable/
products/office2010. Also at that site you can learn about a DAISY add-in that exports content to Word and 
uses DAISY for people using a screen reader. 

617
Chapter 20: Preparing a Presentation for Mass Distribution

Compressing Media
A presentation that contains large video and sound ﬁ les can take up a lot of disk space. If 
you have plenty of room on the disk you will be using to transport the presentation, great. 
But if you will be distributing the presentation in a situation where size is limited, such as 
via an e-mail attachment, you might want to consider compressing the media.
Compressing media decreases its quality so that it takes up less space. Sounds may be less 
crisp, and videos may lose sharpness in both picture and sound. It’s a trade-off, therefore, 
between size and quality. Each situation will be different in determining the appropriate 
balance.
To compress media, follow these steps:
 
1. (Optional) Make a backup copy of your presentation file in case you don’t like 
the decreased quality of the clips after compression and want to revert to your 
original version.
 
2. Choose File ➪ Compress Media. (If that command doesn’t appear on the Info tab, 
you don’t have any compressible media in your presentation.)
 
3. Choose a quality level: Presentation Quality, Internet Quality, or Low Quality. 
See Figure 20.8. 
A Compress Media dialog box appears showing the compression progress.
FIGURE 20.8
Choose a quality level appropriate for the distribution method you will use.

Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Limiting User Access to a Presentation
There are several ways of locking down a presentation, with varying degrees of security 
and effectiveness. The following sections explain the most common methods.
Finalizing a Presentation
When the presentation is completely ﬁ nished, you may want to mark it as ﬁ nalized.
Finalizing a presentation doesn’t provide any “security,” per se, because it is easy to over-
ride. However, it prevents users from inadvertently making additional changes to it, and so 
it gives you some measure of protection against unexpected modiﬁ cations that can distort 
your message. It can also serve as a warning; if a ﬁ nalized presentation has been changed, 
you can tell by checking to see if its ﬁ nalized status is still enabled. 
To mark a presentation as ﬁ nal, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Info ➪ Protect Presentation ➪ Mark as Final. A message appears 
that the presentation will be marked as ﬁ nal and then saved.
 
2. Click OK. A message appears, explaining that the presentation has been marked as 
ﬁ nal and that editing has been turned off for it, as shown in Figure 20.9.
FIGURE 20.9
This message appears after you mark a document as fi nal.
When you mark a document as ﬁ nal, an icon appears in the status bar to indicate that it is 
ﬁ nal, and the presentation becomes uneditable. [Read-Only] appears in the title bar, and 
an information bar appears below the Ribbon (which is collapsed) letting you know that 
document is marked as ﬁ nal. An Edit Anyway button appears there; if you change your 
mind about the presentation and need to edit it, you can click Edit Anyway to easily turn 
off this attribute and edit it again, or choose File ➪ Info ➪ Protect Presentation ➪ Mark as 
Final again to toggle off the Finalized status.
Encrypting a File with a Password
You can prevent unauthorized access to a PowerPoint ﬁ le by assigning a password to it. 
Without the password, nobody can open the ﬁ le. To assign a password, follow these steps:

619
Chapter 20: Preparing a Presentation for Mass Distribution
20
 
1. Choose File ➪ Info ➪ Protect Presentation ➪ Encrypt with Password. The 
Encrypt Document dialog box opens.
 
2. Type a password in the Password text box and click OK. A Conﬁ rm Password dia-
log box appears.
 
3. Retype the same password that you typed in step 2 and click OK.
When anyone attempts to open the ﬁ le in the future, a password prompt will appear. They 
must enter the password and click OK to continue.
To remove a password, returning the document to its original unencrypted status, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Info ➪ Protect Presentation ➪ Encrypt Document. The Encrypt 
Document dialog box opens.
 
2. Delete the contents of the Password text box.
 
3. Click OK.
Notice that you do not have to know the password to remove it if the fi le is already open. Do not leave encrypted pre-
sentations open on your computer when you step away from your desk if security is an issue.
Restricting Access
If you have access to a Digital Rights Management (DRM) service, you may be able to grant 
people access to your presentation while removing their ability to edit, copy, or print it. 
To check this out, choose File ➪ Info ➪ Protect Presentation ➪ Restrict Access ➪ Connect 
to Digital Rights Management Servers and Get Templates. Then follow the prompts to con-
nect to the DRM server for your network. If you aren’t on a network that supports this, you 
won’t be able to use this feature. Check with your company’s network administrator to ﬁ nd 
out if DRM is available.
Adding a Digital Signature
A digital signature enables you to “sign” a document on your computer — for example, to 
approve a draft. To sign a document, choose File ➪ Info ➪ Protect Presentation ➪ Restrict 
Access ➪ Add a Digital Signature. If you do not yet have a digital ID set up on your PC, a prompt 
appears asking if you want to get one. Click Yes, and on the web page that appears, review the 
options for digital signatures and sign up with one of the companies. (A charge applies.) 
Creating a PDF or XPS Version of a Presentation
PDF is a very common format for distributing documents in read-only format. The acronym 
stands for Page Description Format; it’s a proprietary format owned by Adobe. XPS is the 

620
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Microsoft version. Both PDF and XPS formats create static copies of your slides that anyone 
with an appropriate reader can view. For PDF, the Adobe Reader program is available from 
www.adobe.com. Windows Vista and higher, comes with a free XPS reader, and an XPS 
reader is available for other operating systems from www.microsoft.com. 
When you save your presentation in PDF or XPS format, the resulting document consists of 
each of the slides arranged in the order in which they originally appear in the presentation. 
No animations or transitions are present, and links to audio and video clips do not function. 
To publish as PDF or XPS, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Export ➪ Create PDF/XPS Document ➪ Create PDF/XPS. The 
Publish as PDF or XPS dialog box opens. See Figure 20.10.
FIGURE 20.10
Save in PDF or XPS format.
Instead of step 1 you could choose File ➪ Save As.

621
Chapter 20: Preparing a Presentation for Mass Distribution

2. Navigate to the location where you want to save.
 
3. Open the Save as Type drop-down list and choose PDF or XPS, as desired.
 
4. Type a filename in the File Name box if you do not want to use the same name 
as the presentation file itself.
 
5. In the Optimize For section, choose Standard or Minimum Size, depending on 
the intended use for the file. Standard maintains the quality of the graphics; 
Minimum Size compresses them. 
 
6. (Optional) Click Options to open the Options dialog box, from which you can 
make the following choices (and then click OK to return):
 
■Range. You can choose which slides to publish (the default is all of them).
 
■Publish What. You can choose whether to publish slides, handouts, notes pages, 
or Outline view.
 
■Include Non-Printing Information. You can choose whether or not to include 
document properties and document structure tags for accessibility.
 
7. Click Publish. The document is created.
Converting a Presentation to a Video File
Another way to distribute a presentation is to make a video of it. Viewers can see the pre-
sentation exactly as you intended, including narration, animations, and speciﬁ c timings 
between slides, and they don’t need PowerPoint to do so. All they need is an application 
capable of playing back video clips (which nearly all operating systems have). 
You can output your presentation as either an MPEG-4 video or Windows Media Video 
(WMV) video clip. These formats will play in almost any digital video player software, such 
as Windows Media Player, and can be distributed via e-mail, on disk, or on a website.
To save a presentation as a video, follow these steps:
 
1. Be sure that you have finalized your presentation, including all text changes, 
animation, and narration.
 
2. Choose File ➪ Export ➪ Create a Video. Options appear to conﬁ gure the video 
settings, as shown in Figure 20.11.
 
3. Click Computer & HD Displays, opening a menu of sizes. Then click the one that 
is most appropriate for your distribution method. (If you are going to distribute on 
computer, leave it at the default setting.)
 
4. Confirm whether you want to use the timings and narrations you recorded. 
The default is Use Recorded Timings and Narrations. If you leave that selected, 
PowerPoint will use them for any slides that have them; for any slides that are not 
set to automatically advance, the default timing will be used. 

622

7. Type a name for the video clip in the File Name box.
 
8. Open the Save as Type drop-down list and select the desired format. 
 
9. Click Save.
 
10. Wait while the video is created. A progress bar shows on the status bar in 
PowerPoint. 
The presentation will run and be recorded in real time, so it takes as long to record 
as the presentation would take to be shown. (You can’t watch it as it’s recording; it 
happens behind the scenes.)
Making a DVD Movie of a Presentation
If you have Windows 7, you have access to Windows DVD Maker, and you can use it to 
turn your presentation video (made in the preceding section) into a DVD that people with 

623
Chapter 20: Preparing a Presentation for Mass Distribution
20
ordinary noncomputer DVD players can watch on their TV sets. (People can watch them on 
their computers too, if the computers have DVD movie players installed.)
Windows DVD Maker is not included in Windows 8. If you have Windows 8, you will need to use a third-party DVD 
burning software instead.
The following are the steps for Windows DVD Maker. You can use any DVD creation software 
you like, but you’ll need to consult the Help system in that program for the steps to take.
Here are the steps for Windows DVD Maker:
 
1. In Windows 7, choose Start ➪ All Programs ➪ Windows DVD Maker.
 
2. Click Choose Photos and Videos. (This step may not be necessary; it depends on 
whether you have turned off the Welcome screen or not.)
 
3. Click Add Items. The Add Items to DVD dialog box opens.
 
4. Select the video you made of your PowerPoint presentation. (See the preceding 
section.)
 
5. Click Add.
 
6. Click Next.
 
7. (Optional) Change any options as desired in the application.
 
8. Click Burn, and follow the prompts to complete the process.
Presenting Online
Presenting online (which was called presentation broadcasting in earlier PowerPoint ver-
sions) enables you to show your presentation in real time via a network. This makes it 
possible for people to attend a live show when they cannot be there in person. It uses the 
Ofﬁ ce Presentation Service, a free service that Microsoft makes available to PowerPoint 
users. You need a Windows Live ID, which is also free.
Before it’s time to broadcast your presentation “for real,” you will probably want to do a 
practice run to make sure you understand the broadcasting feature.
Follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Slide Show ➪ Start Slide Show ➪ Present Online ➪ Office Pr esentation 
Service. The Present Online dialog box opens. See Figure 20.12.
 
2. If desired, mark the Enable Remote Viewers to Download the Presentation 
check box.
 
3. If there are any warnings in the dialog box, as in Figure 20.12, click their 
hyperlinks to resolve the issues. For example, in Figure 20.12, you could click 

624
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Optimize Media. If you follow one of these hyperlinks, repeat steps 1 and 2 to 
return to this spot after you are ﬁ nished.
FIGURE 20.12
Choose whether remote viewers can download the presentation, and then connect 
to a server.
 
4. Click Connect. You are connected to the broadcast server. (You may be prompted 
for your Windows Live ID; sign in if prompted.) A link appears for participants to 
use to see the broadcast.
 
5. Copy this link to the Clipboard (click Copy Link, or select it and press Ctrl+C) 
and then paste it into an e-mail, instant message, or other medium through 
which you want to share it with others. You can click Send in E-Mail to automati-
cally start a new e-mail containing the link.
 
6. Click Start Presentation. The show begins in Slide Show view on your PC.
 
7. Show the presentation as you would normally. When you are ﬁ nished, Normal 
view reappears.
 
8. On the Present Online tab on the Ribbon, click End Online Presentation.
 
9. At the confirmation box, click End Online Presentation.
As you are broadcasting, a Present Online tab appears in Normal view. (You can return to 
Normal view at any time to work with it.) There you’ll ﬁ nd the following options, as shown 
in Figure 20.13:
 
■Use Presenter View. If you have more than one monitor, you can choose to use 
Presenter view on one of them by marking this check box.

625
Chapter 20: Preparing a Presentation for Mass Distribution

FIGURE 20.13
Use the Present Online tab to set options for your broadcast.
 
■Share Meeting Notes. When you click Share Meeting Notes, a Choose Notes to 
Share with Meeting dialog box opens. Click the New Notebook button, and OneNote 
appears. Use it to create a new notebook, and then close OneNote and return to 
PowerPoint. In the Choose Notes to Share with Meeting dialog box, click the plus 
sign next to the new notebook to view its sections; click New Section 1 to select it. 
Then click the OK button to close the dialog box. The notebook opens in OneNote; 
you can switch back and forth between this notebook and PowerPoint as the pre-
sentation progresses. 
 
■Send Invitations. Use this command to reopen the dialog box containing the link 
to the presentation URL, in case you need to send it to anyone else.
Working with the PowerPoint Viewer
The PowerPoint Viewer is a utility that shows PowerPoint presentations but cannot edit 
them. It is similar to being permanently in Slide Show view. If the computer on which you 
will show the presentation does not have PowerPoint installed and you want to distribute 
the presentation in PowerPoint format, you will need to also distribute PowerPoint Viewer 
so the audience can view the presentation.
Downloading the PowerPoint Viewer
When you package a presentation on CD, the resulting disc includes a 
PresentationPackage.html page, which opens automatically when the disc is inserted. 
On this page is a link to download the PowerPoint Viewer from the Microsoft website, as 
shown in Figure 20.14. Click the link and then follow the prompts.
You don’t have to do this on a PC that already has PowerPoint installed on it, but you may 
want to anyway, just so you can understand the Viewer’s interface, which you’ll be asking 
your audience to use.
Playing a Presentation with the PowerPoint Viewer
When you insert a presentation CD on a system that has either PowerPoint or the 
PowerPoint Viewer installed, all you have to do is select the presentation’s link on the CD’s 
navigation page; it opens in whichever of those programs you have.

626
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
FIGURE 20.14
Open PresentationPackage.html and click the Download Viewer button.
You can also manually start up the PowerPoint Viewer and then manually load a presenta-
tion ﬁ le. Here’s how to do that:
 
1. In Windows 7, choose Start ➪ All Programs ➪ Microsoft Office PowerPoint 
Viewer 2007. Or, in Windows 8, from the Start screen, type powerpoint, and then 
click Microsoft Ofﬁ ce PowerPoint Viewer 2007. (The ﬁ rst time you run it, you have 
to click Accept to accept the license agreement.)
A Microsoft Ofﬁ ce PowerPoint Viewer window opens, which is very much like the 
Open dialog box in PowerPoint.
 
2. Select the presentation you want to view. (Navigate to the CD if needed.)
 
3. Click Open. The presentation opens. 
You can click to move to the next slide or press Backspace or the right arrow key to move 
backward; the presentation tools do not appear in the lower-left corner as they do in the 
full version of PowerPoint. However, you can right-click to open a menu that provides basic 
controls, such as moving between slides, printing, and ending the show. 
Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to prepare a presentation for mass distribution through 
e-mail or the Internet and how to prepare a presentation for these distribution methods by 
removing personal information and setting properties. You also learned how to save a pre-
sentation as a video and to make a DVD movie of the presentation.

Sharing slides with a SharePoint slide library
I
n many organizations, creating an important presentation is a collaborative project, with several 
people providing input on a draft. There are several ways to share a draft presentation with oth-
ers; you can post a presentation to a server, distribute one via e-mail, or post a draft on a docu-
ment management server. You can also create a slide library on a SharePoint server or on a shared 
drive (such as on your company’s network) and make individual slides available for reuse.
In this chapter, you’ll learn how to use PowerPoint’s collaborative tools, such as comments, and how 
to share and distribute presentations and individual slides in a variety of ways.
Working with Comments
Comments are like sticky notes that you can attach to various spots in a presentation, just as you 
would attach notes to a paper copy. With comments, multiple reviewers can offer suggestions with-
out changing the actual presentation.
Adding Comments
As you review a presentation, you can insert comments pertaining to a slide as a whole or to an 
individual object on that slide. To add a comment, follow these steps:

628
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
 
1. Display the slide on which you want to place the comment. If you want to attach 
the comment to a speciﬁ c object, select it.
 
2. On the Review tab, click New Comment. The Comments task pane opens, and a 
new comment appears. The icon appears on the slide, and a text box in which you 
can type the comment appears in the Comments pane. 
If you did not choose a speciﬁ c object in step 1, the comment icon is placed in the 
top-left corner of the slide. Otherwise, a comment icon is placed adjacent to the 
object you selected.
 
3. Type the comment into the box provided, as shown in Figure 21.1.
FIGURE 21.1
Type a comment in the text box in the Comments pane.
Click here to show or hide the Comments pane.

Comment text
 
4. Close the task pane, or leave it open if you are going to be creating more 
comments.
Editing and Deleting Comments
Here’s how to manage existing comments:
 
■To view a comment at any time, click the comment icon on the slide, and the 
Comments pane reopens. 

629
Chapter 21: Sharing and Collaborating
21
 
■To delete a comment, point to the comment in the Comments pane so that an X 
appears in the upper-right corner. See Figure 21.2. Then click the X to delete the 
comment. Alternatively, you can right-click the comment icon on the slide and 
choose Delete Comment.
FIGURE 21.2
To delete a comment, point to it, and then click the X in the corner.
Click here to delete the comment.
Click in the comment to edit it.
Reply to the comment here.
You do not have to delete the comments to hide them. Instead, you can click the Show Comments button on the 
Review tab and then click Show Markup to toggle the comments on/off. Comments do not show in Slide Show view.
 
■To reply to a comment, click in the Reply text box under the main comment, as 
shown in Figure 21.2.
 
■To edit the original comment, click the comment text in the task pane; the inser-
tion point moves into it so you can edit it.
The only places you can’t add comments are to the slide masters and layouts. If you want 
to mark something up for a master or layout, you need to build a slide from that master or 
layout and then add the comment.
If you have a tablet or touchscreen, you might want to comment on a document using the Ink feature, which enables 
you to write directly on the slide with a stylus on your touchscreen. To use this feature, choose Review ➪ Ink ➪ Start 
Inking.
Printing Comments
To print comments, choose File ➪ Print and then click Full Page Slides, which displays a 
menu. At the bottom of that menu, make sure that the Print Comments and Ink Markup 
option is marked, as shown in Figure 21.3. The comments print on a separate page. 

630
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
FIGURE 21.3
Make sure the Print Comments and Ink Markup option is selected to see the comments in 
print.
Reviewing Comments
After everyone has had a chance to comment on a draft presentation, you will want to 
review those comments and probably delete some or all of them.
To move from one comment to the next in the presentation, use the Previous and Next 
buttons on the Comments task pane or on the Review tab. The comments appear in the 
Comments task pane (so that you can read them). To edit one, click it to move the insertion 
point into it and then make your changes. 
Comparing and Merging Presentations
You can compare two versions of the same presentation and see the differences between 
them marked as revisions. You can then accept or reject each revision. This is very helpful 
when multiple people are making changes to separate copies of a presentation and then 
someone has to go back through all the copies and merge all the changes into a single cohe-
sive copy.

631
Chapter 21: Sharing and Collaborating
21
To use this feature, ﬁ rst ensure that you have two PowerPoint ﬁ les that contain essen-
tially the same presentation (but with some changes made to one copy). Let’s call them 
presentation A and presentation B for the sake of this discussion. Decide which one you 
want to be the original and which one you want to be the revision. Open the original one in 
PowerPoint, and then do the following:
 
1. Choose Review ➪ Compare. The Choose File to Merge with Current Presentation 
dialog box opens.
 
2. Select the other version of the presentation and click Merge. The Revisions pane 
opens and shows the ﬁ rst change in the presentation, as shown in Figure 21.4. If 
there are also new comments in the ﬁ le, they appear in the Revisions pane with a 
sticky-note icon.
The little notepad-and-pencil icon (revision icon) on the slide in Figure 21.4 repre-
sents one of the changes listed in the Revisions pane. You can click that icon to see 
a pop-up explaining the change, as shown in Figure 21.4. 
FIGURE 21.4
See the revisions made to the current slide.
Click the revision icon to open menu.
Comments
Revisions
Each change can be individually accepted. Notice in Figure 21.4 the check boxes next to 
each change listed in the pop-up; you can accept a change by clicking its check box to 
mark it there. You can also accept a change by choosing Review ➪ Compare ➪ Accept. (Click 
the face of the Accept button, not the arrow beneath it.)

632
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
The Reject button works only after a change has been accepted. To reject the change, 
accept it and then choose Review ➪ Compare ➪ Reject.
To accept all the changes on the current slide, click the arrow under the Accept button to 
display its menu, and then choose Accept All Changes to This Slide. You can do the same 
thing with the Reject button to reject all changes to the current slide.
To accept all the changes to the entire presentation, click that same arrow and choose 
Accept All Changes to the Presentation. Again, you can do the same thing with the Reject 
button to reject all changes to the presentation.
Use the Previous and Next buttons in the Compare group of the Review tab to move 
between changes. (Don’t confuse these with the Previous and Next buttons in the 
Comments group, which are for comments only.) When you are ﬁ nished, choose 
Review ➪ Compare ➪ End Review. Any unaccepted changes will be discarded, so do not end 
the review until you are ﬁ nished reviewing each change.
Sharing Your Presentation File on a LAN
If your PC is on a network, you can share a presentation ﬁ le with others by placing it in a 
location that other network users can access. You can save it to a centrally accessible net-
work drive, such as a ﬁ le server, or you can make a folder on your own hard disk network 
accessible.
Saving to a Network Drive
To save to a network drive that others also have access to, navigate to that location in the 
Save As dialog box. Start by choosing Network in the navigation pane at the left side of the 
Save As dialog box and then browse to the desired location.
Sharing a Folder on the Network
You can also make your own hard disk’s folders available for others to access on your 
network. The process of doing that depends on the version of Windows you have and on 
whether or not you are using a HomeGroup (a special type of peer-to-peer workgroup spe-
ciﬁ cally for Windows 7 and 8 computers). 
Folder Sharing with a HomeGroup
A HomeGroup is a small network for situations where there is no ﬁ le server, as in a home. 
If all the PCs in your network use Windows 7 or 8, you can use a HomeGroup to share ﬁ les, 
folders, and printers.
If you have a HomeGroup set up, follow these steps to share a folder on it:
 
1. Open a File Explorer window in Windows 8 or a Windows Explorer window in 
Windows 7 and locate the folder you want to share.

633
Chapter 21: Sharing and Collaborating
21
 
2. Right-click the folder and choose one of these (see Figure 21.5): 
 
■Share With ➪ HomeGroup (Read) in Windows 7, or Share With ➪ HomeGroup 
(View) in Windows 8
 
■Share With ➪ HomeGroup (Read/Write) in Windows 7, or Share 
With ➪ HomeGroup (View and Edit) in Windows 8 
FIGURE 21.5
Share with the HomeGroup.
Everyone in your HomeGroup will have the same rights to the folder. If you want to specify 
that only certain people have certain rights, see the following section.
Folder Sharing without a HomeGroup
If you don’t use a HomeGroup, follow these steps to share the folder with all other users 
who have network access to your hard disk:
 
1. Open a File Explorer or Windows Explorer window and locate the folder you 
want to share.
 
2. Right-click the folder and choose Share With ➪ Specific People. The File Sharing 
dialog box opens.

634
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
 
3. Do any of the following: 
 
■To share with a particular user who has a user account and password, enter that 
user’s name and click Add.
 
■To share with everyone, type Everyone (or select Everyone from the drop-down 
list) and click Add, as shown in Figure 21.6.
FIGURE 21.6
Share the folder with everyone by adding the Everyone group to the sharing list.
 
4. If you want to give the user(s) that you just added Read/Write access, click 
Read on the row just added (for example, the Everyone row) and choose Read/
Write from the menu that appears. See Figure 21.7. 
 
5. Click Share.
 
6. Click Done.
Sending a Presentation via E-Mail
You can e-mail a presentation ﬁ le to others directly from within PowerPoint using your 
default e-mail program, such as Outlook, Windows Mail, or Outlook Express. Recipients get 
the presentation as an e-mail attachment, which they can then open in their own copies of 
PowerPoint.

635
Chapter 21: Sharing and Collaborating
21
FIGURE 21.7
Set Read/Write access if desired.
To e-mail a presentation from within PowerPoint, follow these steps:
 
1. From an open presentation, choose File ➪ Share ➪ E-mail ➪ Send as 
Attachment. A new e-mail message opens in your default e-mail application with 
the presentation set as an attachment, as shown in Figure 21.8.
 
2. Type or select the e-mail addresses for the recipients. The exact procedure 
depends on the e-mail application you are using.
 
3. The default entry in the Subject line is the PowerPoint file’s name; change it if 
desired.
 
4. If desired, in the body section of the e-mail, type a note telling the recipients 
what you have attached and what you want them to do with the presentation.
 
5. Click Send.
Sharing a Presentation on Your SkyDrive
As you learned back in Chapter 2, “Creating and Saving Presentation Files,” SkyDrive is a 
free online repository where you can save ﬁ les that you want to make available—either 
to yourself or to others—from within PowerPoint, from File Explorer (Windows 8) or 
Windows Explorer (Windows 7), or via a web interface, from anywhere that Internet access 

636
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
is available. This is a great feature because it eliminates the need to carry around a disk 
or ﬂ ash drive with your presentation on it. Just log into the Internet and there it is! You’ll 
learn much more about SkyDrive in Appendix B, “Essential SkyDrive Skills.” 
FIGURE 21.8
PowerPoint helps you e-mail presentations easily.
Attached

You can easily share your SkyDrive ﬁ les with other people. There are a variety of ways to 
do so. You can send e-mail, post a link to Facebook, or create a hyperlink that you can then 
share with others any way you like (such as pasting it into the HTML for a web page or 
pasting it into an instant messaging program).
The following sections assume that your presentation ﬁ le is already stored on your 
SkyDrive. If it isn’t, save it there, as you learned in Chapter 2. 
Inviting People to View Your Shared Presentation
For other people to view ﬁ les on your SkyDrive, they need a hyperlink that provides the 
location. You can send such a hyperlink to people via e-mail from within PowerPoint. (You 
can also do it from outside of PowerPoint, as explained in Appendix B.) 

637
Chapter 21: Sharing and Collaborating
21
To send an e-mail invitation, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Share ➪ Invite People. Controls appear for composing an e-mail 
message.
 
2. In the Type Names or E-Mail Addresses box, type the e-mail address(es). 
 
3. By default, the link sent allows the recipient to edit the file. If you do not want 
them to be able to, open the Can Edit drop-down list and choose Can View. See 
Figure 21.9. 
FIGURE 21.9
Send an e-mail invitation to view your presentation on your SkyDrive.
 
4. If desired, enter a personal message to include with the invitation.
 
5. If desired, mark the Require User to Sign In Before Accessing Document check 
box. If you mark this check box, only people with a Microsoft account will be able 
to see your ﬁ le. 
 
6. Click Share. The e-mail is sent.

638
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Getting a Sharing Link
You don’t have to send a link to the ﬁ le via e-mail; you can distribute it any way you like 
(such as via instant messaging, for example). To generate a hyperlink to your ﬁ le that you 
can then paste into any application, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Share ➪ Get a Sharing Link. Controls appear for generating links.
If you don’t see the Get a Sharing Link command, you probably haven’t saved the 
ﬁ le to your SkyDrive.
 
2. Click the Create Link button next to either View Link or Edit Link, depending 
on the permission you want to grant. See Figure 21.10.
FIGURE 21.10
Choose to create a link for viewing or editing.
If you later want to stop sharing this ﬁ le, return here and click Disable Link to 
turn that link off.
 
3. Click the hyperlink to select it, and then press Ctrl+C to copy it to the 
Clipboard.
 
4. Click in the application where you want to paste it and press Ctrl+V.
 
5. Return to PowerPoint and press Esc to close Backstage view when you’re 
finished.

Posting Your Presentation to Facebook
If you use Facebook to distribute your work in PowerPoint (such as for a marketing cam-
paign), you can post your link directly to the site from PowerPoint. Note that this proce-
dure posts a link and not a copy of the original ﬁ le.
Follow these steps to post:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Share ➪ Post to Social Networks. Controls appear for posting a 
message on Facebook. See Figure 21.11.
FIGURE 21.11
Share a link to your presentation on Facebook.
If you don’t see the Post to Social Networks command, you probably haven’t saved 
the ﬁ le to your SkyDrive. 
 
2. If you want others to be able to edit your presentation, open the Can View 
drop-down list and click Can Edit.
 
3. (Optional) Type a message to include with the posting.
 
4. Click Post.

640
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Sharing a Presentation via Offi ce 365 SharePoint
If you have access to a SharePoint server via Ofﬁ ce 365, you can use it to share your work 
with others.  This works in much the same way as a SkyDrive share, which you learned 
about earlier in this chapter. Whereas SkyDrive is designed primarily for individual users, 
SharePoint sites are designed for corporate/business users.
First, add the SharePoint site to your list of Save As places. To do so, follow these steps:
 
1. Click File > Save As, and then click Add a Place. 
 
2. Click Office 365 SharePoint.
 
3. Click Sign In.
 
4. Sign in with your user name and password. The site is added to your Save As list 
of places.
From that point, you can save your presentation to the new SharePoint place, and then 
share it with others. Follow these steps to do so:
 
1. Click File > Save As, and then under the Save As heading, click your SharePoint 
document library.
 
2. Click Browse to open the Save As dialog box. The site content appears. Browse to 
the folder in which you want to save the presentation ﬁ le.
 
3. Click Save. The presentation is saved to the speciﬁ ed location.
Next, you will want to share your presentation with other people. To let them know it is 
available, follow these steps:
 
1. Click File > Share > Invite People.
 
2. Enter the email addresses of the people with whom you want to share.
 
3. Choose Can Edit or Can View, depending on the permissions you want to 
assign.
 
4. Enter a message in the box below the address line, and then click Share.
To stop sharing the presentation, choose File > Share, and under Shared With, right-click 
the person with whom you want to stop sharing and click Remove User.
Managing Simultaneous Edits
When you save to a cloud-based storage location such as SkyDrive or Ofﬁ ce 365 SharePoint, 
multiple people can work on a presentation simultaneously, provided they all have 
PowerPoint 2010 or later, or are using the latest release of the PowerPoint Web App.

641
Chapter 21: Sharing and Collaborating
21
Here’s how it works:
 
1. Create a draft of the presentation and save it to a shared location. If needed, 
give permission to edit it to the people with whom you will collaborate.
 
2. Open and start working on the presentation. It’s as easy as that! When other 
people are working on the presentation, you’ll see a Co-authoring icon in the status 
bar telling you how many people are working on it. 
 
3. Save your work when you are finished editing by choosing File > Save.  
If you were the only one working on the presentation, the process ends here; it’s 
just like any other save. However, if others were also editing the presentation, a 
notiﬁ cation appears that updates are available. Continue the process by following 
these steps:
 
4. Click the Updates Available indicator on the status bar to merge the changes. 
Unless your edits conﬂ ict, they merge automatically, and you’re done. 
If someone else made a change that conﬂ icts with some edit you made, a message 
appears. If that happens, click the Resolve Conﬂ icts button.
 
5. A message appears that PowerPoint has refreshed your presentation with 
changes made by other authors. Click OK to accept that.
 
6. On the Merge tab, click Show Changes.
 
7. Do one of the following:
 
■To view conﬂ icting updates only, click Show Only Conﬂ icts.
 
■To view all changes, click Show All Changes.
 
8. To accept a conflicting change, click the box next to the change. Or, to reject 
a conﬂ icting change, do nothing to it. Ignored changes are the same as rejected 
changes.
 
9. When you are done reviewing changes, click Close Merge View. All changes are 
applied and uploaded to the server, and all change indicators disappear.
Sharing Slides with a SharePoint Slide Library
Often people who work at the same company can beneﬁ t from sharing slides with one 
another. For example, a product manager might have slides that describe his product, and 
a sales or marketing person in the company could save a great deal of time by copying such 
slides instead of re-creating them from scratch. However, it can be time consuming to wade 
through large presentations to ﬁ nd a single slide that could be of beneﬁ t.
A slide library is a specialized type of document library that stores individual slides rather than 
entire presentations. A slide library enables users to publish individual slides that they think 
might be of interest to others in their organization. For example, with a slide library, product 
managers could post two or three slides about their products and an executive or salesperson 
could easily browse these and choose the ones needed for a presentation to a particular client.

642
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
If a slide contains links to other content, such as videos or sounds, that linked content is not included in the slide 
library.
You can check out slides from a slide library and attach an approval process and tasks to 
them. In addition, you can tag each slide in several ways and search the slide libraries for 
just the slides you need.
The following sections assume that you already have a SharePoint slide library available to 
you. If that’s not the case, contact the IT department at your company to ﬁ nd out how to 
get a SharePoint slide library set up for your department or project.
Placing Slides into a Slide Library from PowerPoint
If the presentation is already open in PowerPoint, it’s a natural next step to publish slides 
directly from within PowerPoint to the slide library. This process also works to publish 
slides to a local slide library folder (not on a SharePoint server). You or your coworkers who 
have access to the drive can then reuse slides.
To store slides in a slide library from within PowerPoint, follow these steps:
 
1. Open your presentation and choose File ➪ Share ➪ Publish Slides ➪ Publish 
Slides. The Publish Slides dialog box opens (Figure 21.12).
FIGURE 21.12

2. Mark the check box for each slide that you want to publish, or click the Select 
All button to add all of the slides to the library. 
Can’t see all of the slides? Use the scroll bar on the right to move down through the 
slides.
 
3. (Optional) Change the filename and/or description for a slide if desired. The 
text in the File Name and Description columns is editable; just click in it and type.
 
4. Type the path to your slide library in the Publish To field. 
If you already have your SharePoint slide library open in your web browser, the 
easiest way to get the path to your slide library is to copy it from your browser. 
Select the beginning of the path. (Don’t select from the /Forms part on.) Or if the 
slide library is locally accessible, click Browse to browse for it.
If you don’t have access to the desired slide library right now, click Browse, and in the Select a Slide Library dialog 
box, create a new folder to serve as a temporary slide library. Then select that folder and click Select. This results 
in a new pointer placed in C:\Users\username\Roaming\Microsoft\PowerPoint\My Slide 
Libraries. You can then upload this folder to the slide library on the SharePoint server when it is available. 
However, you won’t be able to insert slides from this folder into your presentation as if it were a slide library (see the 
next section) until it has been published to SharePoint.
 
5. Click the Publish button to publish the slides to the library. (You may be 
prompted for a username and password for the server.) 
 
6. Wait for the slides to be uploaded to the slide library. A progress bar appears in 
the status bar as the upload is happening.
Pulling Slides from the Library to PowerPoint
Once you have slides in your library, you will work with them primarily from within 
PowerPoint. You can quickly pull individual slides into presentations using the following 
steps:
 
1. Open the presentation into which you want to insert one or more slides.
 
2. On the Home tab in the Ribbon, click the down arrow under the New Slides 
button and select Reuse Slides.
 
3. In the task pane that appears to the right, type the URL of your slide library in 
the Insert Slide From text box, or select it from the text box’s drop-down list. 
If you paste the URL from your browser, remove everything after the slide library 
name.  
You can create a temporary library fi le on your local hard drive in which to save fi les to be published. However, you 
can’t access that local folder as if it were a real slide library.

4. Click the arrow button to the right of the drop-down list to open your slide 
library. A thumbnail list of slides will appear in the task pane. See Figure 21.13.

To best see all of the slides, you might want to widen and/or undock the task pane. To undock it, click the blue bar at 
the top of the task pane and drag it toward the middle of the screen. Drag the edge of the task pane to widen it.
 
5. (Optional) To keep the source formatting for the slide(s), mark the Keep 
Source Formatting check box. Otherwise, the content of the slides inserted will 
adjust to the destination presentation’s master slide settings.
 
6. (Optional) Mark the check box labeled Tell Me When the Slide Changes. This 
ensures that if someone else changes this slide and checks it into the library, you 
will be notiﬁ ed.
 
7. Click a slide to add it to the presentation. Repeat for each slide you want to add.

If your library is very large and you want to search for slides that match a certain criteria, type the criteria (such as a 
keyword) in the Search box. This works only if your server supports Search. You can also change how the slides are 
grouped, to fi nd specifi c slides, using the drop-down above the slides.
 
8. Close the task pane.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to share presentations and your slides with other users. 
You can make comments to a presentation and compare and combine changes made by mul-
tiple users. You can share full presentation ﬁ les using a LAN drive and e-mail, SkyDrive, 
and a SharePoint slide library. In the next chapter, you will learn how to customize 
PowerPoint and automate its use with macros.

lthough PowerPoint works great right out of the box, it can work even better for you with a 
few tweaks. You can change program defaults and customize the Quick Access Toolbar and 
Ribbon to make PowerPoint your own.
Setting Program Defaults
PowerPoint contains a large assortment of customizable program settings. Some make purely cos-
metic changes to the interface, whereas others enable or disable timesaving or safety features.
You can access most options by selecting File ➪ Options and working in the PowerPoint Options 
dialog box. Click a category in the PowerPoint Options dialog box along the left side, and then set 
the options that you want. Table 22.1 lists all of the options, divided by category (or most of them, 
anyway; depending on the language, you may have a few extra options or be missing a few).

Confi guring the Trust Center
The Trust Center is a separate dialog box from the main PowerPoint options; it contains 
categories for controlling the permissions that users, programs, and Internet sites have to 
access your computer through PowerPoint. After clicking the Trust Center category in the 
PowerPoint Options dialog box, you can click the Trust Center Settings button to access it.
Setting Up Trusted Locations
A trusted location is a location that you verify to be threat-free. When a presentation ﬁ le is 
stored in a trusted location, PowerPoint allows macros to run without the usual safeguards 
(discussed later in this chapter). To allow free access to your macros in a presentation ﬁ le, 
you should store it in a trusted location.
The following folders are trusted by default:
 
■Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Templates 
 
■Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Addins 
 
■Program Files\Microsoft Office\Templates
 
■Program Files\Microsoft Office\Document Themes 15
TABLE 22.1   (continued)

655
Chapter 22: Customizing PowerPoint
22
You can also add more trusted locations. For example, you may want to trust a folder in 
which you store your presentation ﬁ les for a certain client.
To add a trusted location, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Options.
 
2. Click Trust Center, and click the Trust Center Settings button.
 
3. Click Trusted Locations. A list of currently trusted locations appears, as shown in 
Figure 22.1.
FIGURE 22.1
You can set up new trusted locations in the Trust Center dialog box.
 
4. Click Add New Location.
 
5. Click the Browse button, and browse to the location you want. If you want, 
select the Subfolders of This Location Are Also Trusted check box.
 
6. Click OK. 
 
7. Click OK to close the Trust Center dialog box.
 
8. Click OK to close the PowerPoint Options dialog box.
Figure 22.1 shows other settings and buttons that you can also select:
 
■Allow Trusted Locations on My Network. Enables you to add trusted locations 
that exist other than on your local computer.

656
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
 
■Disable All Trusted Locations. This setting does just what its name says. You will 
learn more about trusted publishers in the next section.
 
■Remove. Removes a trusted location from the list. (There is no conﬁ rmation; it is 
removed immediately.)
 
■Modify. Opens the Trusted Location dialog box for a location so that you can 
change its path or options.
Working with Trusted Publishers
Another way to trust a macro is to verify that it comes from a trusted publisher. The macro 
settings (covered in a later section) enable you to specify what should happen when a 
macro from a trusted publisher wants to run outside of a trusted location.
When you open a presentation that includes one or more signed macros, PowerPoint asks 
you whether or not you want to trust macros from that signer. Information about the 
signer’s certiﬁ cate appears, including the name, the issuing authority, and the valid dates. 
If you choose Yes, then this signer is added to your Trusted Publishers list. If you have not 
yet added a signer to the Trusted Publishers list, the list will be blank in the Trust Center 
dialog box.
If you have a trusted publisher on your list, you can select it and then click View to view 
its information or click Remove to remove it from the Trusted Publishers list.
Trusted Documents and Protected View Settings
When you open a presentation that is not from a trusted location or trusted publisher, it 
opens in an uneditable mode; you must click Enable Content on the information bar that 
appears across the top of the window to trust that document (see Figure 22.2) or choose 
File ➪ Info ➪ Enable Editing.
FIGURE 22.2
A warning appears when you access a fi le that originated from outside your trusted locations.
The Trust Center has several settings for managing the process of trusting a document (or 
not). First, in the Trusted Documents category, you can set these options:
 
■Allow Documents on a Network to Be Trusted. If you clear this check box, docu-
ments that originate from a source other than your own computer will not be 
editable.
 
■Disable Trusted Documents. If you mark this check box, it completely disables the 
ability to trust any documents, whether on a network or your own PC.

657
Chapter 22: Customizing PowerPoint
22
In the Protected View category, you can then ﬁ ne-tune the criteria for a document being 
protected:
 
■Enable Protected View for Files Originating from the Internet. This includes 
presentations you download from websites.
 
■Enable Protected View for Files Located in Potentially Unsafe Locations. This 
includes presentations stored on your local hard disk but not in locations marked as 
Trusted (see “Setting Up Trusted Locations” earlier in this chapter).
 
■Enable Protected View for Outlook Attachments. This includes any presentations 
that you have received as e-mail attachments in Outlook.
Add-Ins
You will learn about managing add-ins later in this chapter; they extend PowerPoint’s 
functionality by integrating mini-programs written by third-party individuals or compa-
nies not afﬁ liated with Microsoft. Add-ins can often dramatically extend the capabilities 
of an application by adding new tabs on the Ribbon, new buttons, and more. Because they 
connect with the application at a fairly low level, they can be devastating if they contain 
viruses. (It is not common for add-ins to contain viruses, but you never know what could 
happen.)
In the Add-Ins section of the Trust Center, you can specify the criteria for add-ins being 
able to run:
 
■Require Application Add-Ins to Be Signed by Trusted Publisher. Prevents 
unsigned add-ins from being installed. Trusted publishers are deﬁ ned and conﬁ g-
ured in the Trusted Publishers section, discussed earlier in this chapter.
 
■Disable Notification for Unsigned Add-Ins. Prevents a warning from appearing 
when an add-in is disabled because it is not signed. This is applicable only if the 
preceding option is selected.
 
■Disable All Application Add-Ins. Prevents all add-ins from running, regardless of 
the signed or unsigned status.
ActiveX Settings
ActiveX controls are somewhat like add-ins or macros; they are more commonly used on 
web pages, but sometimes PowerPoint ﬁ les (or other Ofﬁ ce ﬁ les) contain them as well. They 
extend the functionality of the program in some way.
In the ActiveX Settings for All Ofﬁ ce Applications section, you can choose a level of per-
mission for ActiveX controls, ranging from disabling all of them to enabling all of them. 
See Figure 22.3.

658
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
FIGURE 22.3
Specify what level of permission ActiveX controls should have.
Macro Settings
Macro settings apply only to macros that are stored in presentations that are not in trusted 
locations. These settings determine whether or not the macro should run and whether you 
should receive notiﬁ cation, as shown in Figure 22.4.
FIGURE 22.4
You can specify what should happen when a presentation outside a trusted location tries to 
run a macro.

659
Chapter 22: Customizing PowerPoint
22
Message Bar
By default, when content is blocked, a message bar appears between the Ribbon and the 
presentation to let you know what has happened. You can enable or disable the appearance 
of this message bar.
File Block Settings
In this area of the Trust Center, you can prevent certain ﬁ le types from being opened or saved 
via PowerPoint. If you place a check mark in the Open column for a certain ﬁ le type, PowerPoint 
either prevents it from opening at all or opens it in Protected view, depending on the Open 
Behavior for Selected File Types setting (at the bottom of the dialog box). If you place a check 
mark in the Save column, PowerPoint will prevent the ﬁ le from being saved. See Figure 22.5.
FIGURE 22.5
You can block certain fi le types from being saved or opened or force them to be opened in 
Protected view.
Privacy Options
It is usually safe to connect to the Internet to download content such as clip art and tem-
plates and to send feedback to Microsoft about errors and usage. However, some people 
are concerned about security and prefer to control their computer’s connection to outside 

660
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
sources such as the Internet. (Yes, I know, just because you are paranoid does not mean 
that someone is not out to get you.) In the Privacy Options category, you can ﬁ nd a set of 
check boxes you can use to specify what connectivity to allow.
Customizing the Ribbon
You can customize any part of the Ribbon in PowerPoint 2013. You can even create your 
own new tabs, making it possible to consolidate the commands you use most often on a 
single tab for greater efﬁ ciency.
Minimizing the Ribbon
If you aren’t using the Ribbon at the moment, you can hide it to get extra space on the 
screen to see more text at once. There are several ways to do this:
 
■Right-click any button on either the Ribbon or the Quick Access Toolbar and choose 
Collapse the Ribbon.
 
■Click the up-pointing arrow on the far right end of the Ribbon.
 
■Press Ctrl+F1.
To redisplay it again, do any of the following:
 
■Right-click any button on the Quick Access Toolbar and choose Collapse the Ribbon 
to toggle the option off.
 
■Click any tab to display the Ribbon temporarily, and then click the pushpin icon on 
the far right end of the Ribbon.
 
■Press Ctrl+F1.
Displaying or Hiding Ribbon Tabs
If there are certain tabs you never use, you might want to hide them. (You can always 
change your mind later and redisplay them.)
To choose which tabs display, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click any button on the Ribbon and choose Customize the Ribbon. The 
PowerPoint Options dialog box opens with the Customize Ribbon tab displayed.
 
2. Mark or clear the check boxes as needed for each Ribbon tab listed in the right 
pane. See Figure 22.6.
 
3. Click OK.
Some of the tabs listed in Figure 22.6 are not displayed all the time. For example, the Slide 
Master tab appears only when you are working in Slide Master view. If you disable one of 

661
Chapter 22: Customizing PowerPoint
22
these tabs and then perform an action that would normally make that tab appear, it won’t 
appear. This can be perplexing to someone else using your computer who doesn’t know 
you’ve hidden it — or even to yourself if you forgot you did.
FIGURE 22.6
You can turn certain tabs on or off.
Clear the check
box for any tab
you want to hide.
Creating or Deleting a Tab or a Custom Group
You can add any command to any tab as long as it is in a custom group (that is, a user-
created group). Therefore, you have to create the custom group ﬁ rst, before you can start 
customizing an existing tab. If desired, you can create a whole new tab ﬁ rst and then cre-
ate your custom groups on that new tab.
Creating a Custom Tab
To create your own tab, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click any button on the Ribbon and choose Customize the Ribbon. The 
PowerPoint Options dialog box opens with the Customize Ribbon tab displayed.
 
2. On the Main Tabs list (right side of dialog box), click the existing tab that the 
new one should appear after (that is, to the right of). 

662
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
 
3. Click New Tab. A new tab appears on the list called New Tab (Custom). By default, 
it has one group in it: New Group (Custom). See Figure 22.7.
FIGURE 22.7
When you create a custom tab, a custom group is automatically created in it.
 
4. Click the new tab, and click the Rename button.
 
5. In the Rename dialog box, type a new name for the tab and click OK.
 
6. Click the new group within that new tab, and rename it the same way. 
The dialog box for renaming a group is different from that for renaming a tab; it con-
tains icons as well as a text box, as shown in Figure 22.8. An icon appears when a group 
is collapsed (for example, when the PowerPoint window is not wide enough to show it).
FIGURE 22.8
When renaming a group, you can also choose its icon.
 
7. Click OK to close the dialog box, or leave it open for more editing.
Creating a Custom Group
As you just saw, when you create a new tab, you also get a group with it automatically. You 
can add more groups to your new tab, and you can also add groups to existing tabs.
Here’s how to create a custom group on an existing tab:
 
1. If the PowerPoint Options dialog box is not already open, right-click any but-
ton on the Ribbon and choose Customize the Ribbon.
 
2. Click the tab on which you want to create the new group.

3. Click New Group. A new group is added to that tab, with the name New Group 
(Custom). 
All custom groups have the same name by default; PowerPoint does not number 
them or give them sequential names.
 
4. (Optional) Rename the group: 
 
a. Click Rename.
 
b. Type a new name for the group.
 
c. Click an icon for the group. (This icon will appear if the group is collapsed 
because of inadequate window width to display it.) See Figure 22.8.
 
d. Click OK.
 
5. Click OK to close the dialog box, or leave it open for more editing.
Adding or Removing Commands
You can’t remove the standard commands on any of the built-in tabs; only the groups and 
commands you have placed yourself can be modiﬁ ed.
Before you add a command to the Ribbon, consider whether it might be better to add it to the Quick Access Toolbar 
instead (covered later in this chapter). The Quick Access Toolbar is always available, regardless of which tab is dis-
played. This can save you a step in executing the command because you never have to change tabs to get to it.
Adding a Command
To add a command, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the custom group to which you want to add the command. (Remember, 
you can’t add commands to built-in groups.)
 
2. On the list at the left, select the command to add. 
You may wish to narrow down the list of commands by making a selection from the 
drop-down list ﬁ rst. For example, you could choose Commands Not on the Ribbon to 
exclude commands that are already on other tabs.
 
3. Click the Add button. The command appears under the group name on the left side 
of the window.
 
4. Click OK to close the dialog box, or leave it open for more editing.
Removing a Command
To remove a command, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the command you want to remove.
 
2. Click Remove.
Alternately, you can click the Remove button to the left of the tabs list.

664
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
The command is removed from the custom group but is still available on the list on the left 
so that you can add it later to some other group or tab.
Renaming or Reordering Tabs
You can change the entire look of the Ribbon by renaming and/or reordering its tabs.
Any tab can be renamed, even the built-in ones. Just right-click it and choose Rename, or 
click the Rename button and then type the new name. PowerPoint does not check whether 
each name is unique, so you can name them all the same thing if you like. (That wouldn’t 
be very useful, though.)
To move a tab or group, right-click it and then click Move Up or Move Down, or use the 
Move Up or Move Down button.
Resetting Customizations
It’s easy to get carried away with customizing PowerPoint and end up with an interface you 
barely recognize. If this happens, reset the Ribbon to its original state and start over.
To reset only one tab, do the following:
 
1. If the PowerPoint Options dialog box is not already open, right-click any but-
ton on the Ribbon and choose Customize Ribbon.
 
2. Click the Reset button. A menu opens.
 
3. Click Reset Only Selected Ribbon Tab.
 
4. Click OK to close the dialog box, or leave it open for further editing.
To reset all customization, including any custom shortcut keys and the Quick Access 
Toolbar, do the following:
 
1. If the PowerPoint Options dialog box is not already open, right-click any but-
ton on the Ribbon and choose Customize Ribbon.
 
2. Click the Reset button. A menu opens.
 
3. Click Reset All Customizations.
 
4. Click OK to close the dialog box, or leave it open for further editing.
Importing and Exporting Customization Settings
After you get the Ribbon and other program options just the way you like them, what hap-
pens if you need to switch to a different computer? The good news is you don’t have to 
recustomize everything; you can export your customization settings to a ﬁ le. Then you can 
transfer that ﬁ le to the other PC and import the customization settings there.

665
Chapter 22: Customizing PowerPoint
22
Exporting Customization
To export your customization settings, follow these steps:
 
1. If the PowerPoint Options dialog box is not already open, right-click any but-
ton on the Ribbon and choose Customize Ribbon.
 
2. Click the Import/Export button. A menu opens.
 
3. Click Export All Customizations. The File Save dialog box opens.
 
4. (Optional) Change the filename and location if desired. You might save the ﬁ le to 
a USB ﬂ ash drive, for example, or a network location that is accessible on both PCs.
 
5. Click Save.
 
6. Click OK to close the PowerPoint Options dialog box.
Importing Customization
User interface conﬁ guration ﬁ les like the one you just saved in the preceding section can be 
imported into PowerPoint 2013 on any other PC. Importing will wipe out any customization 
settings on the other PC, so before you do this, make sure there are no customizations that 
you want to keep and you can’t reproduce. Make sure that the PC receiving the customization 
settings can access the ﬁ le where you stored the settings. Then follow these steps to import: 
 
1. If the PowerPoint Options dialog box is not already open, right-click any but-
ton on the Ribbon and choose Customize Ribbon.
 
2. Click the Import/Export button. A menu opens.
 
3. Click Import Customization File.
 
4. Select the customization file and click Open.
 
5. A confirmation box appears; click Yes.
 
6. Click OK to close the PowerPoint Options dialog box.
Customizing the Quick Access Toolbar
The Quick Access Toolbar, or QAT, is the row of buttons above the File button, in the upper-
left corner of the PowerPoint window. It contains a few buttons by default, such as Save, 
Undo, and Redo, and you can add others to it. For example, I use Format Painter a lot, but 
every time I need it, I don’t want to have to click the Home tab. By adding Format Painter to 
the QAT, I make it available all of the time, and I don’t have to remember which tab it is on.
Adding Common Commands
PowerPoint maintains a short list of popular commands that you can quickly turn on or off 
on the QAT. To do so, click the down arrow at the right end of the QAT and then select a 
command from the menu to toggle it on or off. See Figure 22.9.

666
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
FIGURE 22.9
Certain commands can be toggled on or off on the QAT via its menu.
Adding Already-Available Commands to the QAT
If the command is already available on a tab or menu, then adding it to the QAT is easy. 
Just right-click it and choose Add to Quick Access Toolbar. You can use this method to com-
bine all of your most-used commands and buttons in a single location so that you do not 
have to switch among the tabs as frequently.
However, in order for you to use this method, the command already has to be available 
somewhere within PowerPoint’s Ribbon or Ofﬁ ce menu. As a result, you cannot use this 
method to add capabilities to PowerPoint that it does not already have by default.
Removing Commands from the QAT
To remove a command from the QAT, right-click it on the QAT and choose Remove from 
Quick Access Toolbar. If you want to add it again later, you can use the method in the pre-
ceding section if the command exists on a tab or menu. You can use the method in the fol-
lowing section if it does not or if you cannot seem to ﬁ nd it on any of the tabs or menus.
Adding Other Commands to the QAT
Besides the standard set of commands, PowerPoint also contains a secret list of extra com-
mands and capabilities. Most of these are old features from previous versions of PowerPoint 
that Microsoft is phasing out or features for which there was no room on the Ribbon. For 
example, the Nudge commands are not on the main Ribbon by default (Nudge Left, Nudge 
Right, and so on). 

667
Chapter 22: Customizing PowerPoint
22
To add a command to the QAT, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the QAT and choose Customize Quick Access Toolbar.
 
2. Open the Customize Quick Access Toolbar drop-down list (on the right), and 
choose For All Documents, or choose a particular presentation name from the 
list. You can only customize for either one presentation or for all presentations. If 
you’re customizing for one presentation, that presentation must be open.
 
3. Open the Choose Commands From drop-down list and select a category. There 
are categories for every tab as well as some extra ones at the top of the list: 
 
■Popular. A selection of the most commonly used commands.
 
■Commands Not in the Ribbon. The collection of commands that do not have 
Ribbon or Ofﬁ ce menu equivalents; this is where you will ﬁ nd the hidden 
goodies.
 
■All Commands. A complete list of all commands; use this list when you think a 
command is already available on a tab but you do not know which one.
 
■Macros. Any macros stored in the current presentation or template appear here.
 
4. Select a command from the list, and click the Add>> button to move it to the 
Customize Quick Access Toolbar list, as shown in Figure 22.10.
 
5. Add any other commands that you want.
 
6. (Optional) Perform any of the following tasks, if necessary: 
 
■To reset the QAT, click Reset.
 
■To modify a macro after adding it to the QAT, select it and click Modify.
 
■To change the order in which buttons appear on the QAT, select a button and 
click the Up or Down arrow button to the right of the listing.
 
7. Click OK to accept the changes.
Managing Add-Ins
Add-ins are extra features that you can install for PowerPoint that extend its capabilities 
in some way. You can add, remove, or temporarily enable/disable the various add-ins in 
PowerPoint to control how it behaves.
One of the most powerful types of add-ins is a Component Object Model (COM) add-in. COM 
add-ins are supplemental programs that extend PowerPoint’s capabilities by adding custom 
commands or features. COM add-ins can come from Microsoft or from third-party sources. 
They usually have a .dll or .exe ﬁ lename extension and are written in a programming 
language such as Visual Basic or C++. For example, if you have Adobe Acrobat installed on 
your system, you might have PDF Maker add-ins that help you create PDF ﬁ les from Ofﬁ ce 
content.

668
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
FIGURE 22.10
You can add commands to the Quick Access Toolbar.
To view installed add-ins, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File ➪ Options.
 
2. Click Add-Ins. A list of installed add-ins appears (see Figure 22.11).
An installed add-in can be either enabled or disabled. Having the option of disabling an 
add-in rather than removing it entirely is handy because it allows you to turn one off tem-
porarily without losing it. Disabling add-ins is also helpful for troubleshooting. If you are 
not sure what add-in is causing PowerPoint to crash, you can disable them all and then 
enable them one at a time until you ﬁ nd the problem.
To disable or remove an add-in, you need to know what type it is because the steps are dif-
ferent for the various types. To determine a type, look in the Type column.

669
Chapter 22: Customizing PowerPoint
22
Based on the type, open the Manage drop-down list at the bottom of the dialog box and 
select the desired add-in type. Then click Go to open a dialog box interface speciﬁ cally for 
that type of add-in.
FIGURE 22.11
See a list of installed add-ins here.
Enabling/Disabling COM Add-Ins
Choose COM Add-Ins in the Manage drop-down list and click Go to display the COM Add-Ins 
dialog box. It lists the available COM add-ins; you can select one and click Remove, or you 
can change its load behavior. You can also click Add to add more COM add-ins, although 
most COM add-ins come with their own setup programs that do that part for you.

670
Part III: Interfacing with Your Audience
Enabling Actions
 Choose Actions in the Manage drop-down list and click Go to display the AutoCorrect dialog 
box with the Actions tab selected. From here, you can click More Actions to add additional 
actions to PowerPoint, or click an existing action on the Available Actions list and then 
click Properties to conﬁ gure it.
Enabling/Disabling PowerPoint Add-Ins
PowerPoint add-ins, which are usually written by a third party, are speciﬁ c to PowerPoint 
(not generic to all Ofﬁ ce apps, as Actions are).
From the Manage drop-down list, choose PowerPoint Add-Ins, and click Go. The Add-Ins 
dialog box opens. Add, remove, or enable/disable each add-in as desired.
Customizing the Status Bar
The status bar is the bar across the bottom of the PowerPoint window, where the Zoom slider 
and view buttons appear. You can customize what appears there by right-clicking the status 
bar and marking or clearing the check boxes on the menu that appears. See Figure 22.12.

Right-click the status bar and choose commands to display or hide on it.

n an ideal world, you’d have great video equipment to create live-action movies for your audi-
ences, but that’s not always the case. Often you’re stuck with a bunch of static images, and you 
need to make them as lively and animated as possible within the conﬁ nes of PowerPoint.
In this lab, you animate a presentation for Spice Meadow Shelties, a small kennel that breeds pure-
bred Shetland sheepdogs. The graphics and text are already in place. Your job is to apply animations 
and transitions to make the presentation more interesting and appealing.

hen you create user-interactive presentations that contain many slides, it is considered 
courteous to provide your audience with a navigation system so that they can browse 
through the presentation without having to view every single slide. Menu systems can be 
as simple or as complex as you like and can be integrated into the slide design.
In this project lab, you learn how to create a navigation system in a presentation that is designed 
to teach computer technicians about safety issues for working on PCs. You modify the presenta-
tion’s layout and design to make room for a menu system, and then you create navigational hyper-
links on the slide master.

room for a menu system on the left side of the slide.
This lab session includes some cleanup work on a “messy” PowerPoint ﬁ le that is missing a layout 
needed for some of the slides. This session simulates the type of cleanup situations you might run 
into in everyday work on older presentation ﬁ les.

Presentation?

Developing your presentation action plan
Choosing and arranging the room
Choosing your attire
Keeping the audience interested
Managing stage fright
W
ow! What a great presentation! That’s what you want your audience to come away thinking, 
right?
Most people won’t be nit-picky enough to pinpoint exactly what they loved about the expe-
rience. Nobody is likely to say, “Weren’t the colors in that pie chart on slide 43 artfully chosen?” or 
“Did you see his tie? I wonder where I can buy one just like it.” Instead, you’ll leave your audience 
with an overall impression that they gather from a host of little details, from the color scheme on 
your slides to the anecdotes and jokes you tell.
You can turn off your computer for this appendix because you won’t need it to follow along. I’ll 
present some strategies for planning the best presentation ever. I’ll provide an 11-point action plan 
for building your presentation ﬁ le and address some of the “soft” topics that can make or break a 
show, such as how to arrange a room, what to wear, where to stand, and more.
Qualities of an Effective Presentation
What separates an effective presentation from an ineffective one? No, it’s not just a gut feeling; 
there are proven attributes for which you can strive. The rest of this chapter elaborates on these 
points, but here’s a quick overview of what to work on.

754
Part IV: Project Labs
An effective presentation has the following characteristics:
 
■It’s designed and formatted appropriately for the audience and the medium.
 
■It’s tightly focused on its subject, with extraneous facts trimmed away or hidden 
for backup use.
 
■It uses the right PowerPoint theme, with colors and fonts chosen to reinforce the 
message of the presentation.
 
■It includes the right amount of text on each slide, without overcrowding.
 
■It uses artwork purposefully to convey information and create an overall visual 
impression.
 
■It uses charts rather than raw columns of numbers to present ﬁ nancial or numeric 
information.
 
■It employs sound and video to create interest where needed but does not allow the 
effects to dominate the show.
 
■It uses animations and transitions if appropriate for the audience and message but 
does not allow them to dominate.
 
■It includes handouts for the audience that contain the information they will want 
to take with them.
 
■It leaves time at the end for a question-and-answer session so the audience mem-
bers can clarify any points they were confused about.
Now that you know what the goal is, how do you get there? You need a precise, step-by-step 
action plan for developing a presentation that has these qualities. 
Developing Your Presentation Action Plan
Can you guess what the single biggest problem is when most people use PowerPoint? Here’s 
a hint: It’s not a problem with the software at all. It’s that they don’t think things through 
carefully before they create their presentation, and then they have to go back and make 
major modiﬁ cations later. You’ve probably heard the saying “If you don’t have time to do it 
right, how are you going to ﬁ nd time to do it over?” This sentiment is certainly applicable 
to creating presentations.
In the following sections, I outline a strategy for creating the appropriate PowerPoint 
presentation right from the start. By considering the issues addressed here, you can avoid 
making false assumptions about your audience and their needs and so avoid creating a 
beautiful presentation with some horrible ﬂ aw that makes it unusable. By spending a half 
hour or so in this chapter, you can save yourself literally days in rework later.

755
Appendix A: What Makes a Great Presentation?
A
Step 1: Identifying Your Audience and Purpose
Before you can think about the presentation you need to create, you must think of your 
audience. As you probably already know from real-life experience, different audiences 
respond to different presentation types. For example, a sales pitch to a client requires a 
very different approach than an informational brieﬁ ng to your coworkers. Ask yourself 
these questions:
 
■How many people will be attending the presentation? The attendance makes a 
difference because the larger the group, the larger your screen needs to be so that 
everyone can see. If you don’t have access to a large screen, you have to make the 
lettering and charts big and chunky so that everyone can read your presentation.
 
■What is the average age of the attendees? Although it’s difﬁ cult to generalize 
about people, it’s especially important to keep your presentation light and enter-
taining when you’re presenting to a very young audience (teens and children). 
Generally speaking, the older the audience, the more authoritative you need to be.
 
■What role will the audience take in relation to the topic? If you are rolling out 
a new product or system, the managerial staff will likely want a general overview 
of it, but the line workers who will actually be operating the product need a lot of 
details. Generally speaking, the higher the level of managers, the more removed 
they will be from the action and the fewer details of operation they need.
 
■How well does the audience already know the topic? If you are presenting to 
a group that knows nothing about your topic, you want to keep things basic and 
make sure that you deﬁ ne all of the unfamiliar terms. In contrast, with a group 
of experts, you are likely to have many follow-up questions after the main pre-
sentation, and so you should plan on having some hidden backup slides ready in 
anticipation of those questions. See Chapter 18, “Preparing for a Live Presentation,” 
for more on hiding slides for backup use. 
 
■Does the audience care about the topic? If the topic is personally important 
to the attendees (such as information on their insurance beneﬁ ts or vacation 
schedule), they will likely pay attention even if your presentation is plain and 
straightforward. However, if you must win them over, you need to spend more time 
on the bells and whistles.
 
■Are the attendees prejudiced either positively or negatively toward the topic? 
Keep in mind that the audience’s preconceived ideas can make the difference 
between success and failure in some presentations. For example, knowing that a 
client hates sales pitches can help you to tailor your own presentation to be out of 
the ordinary.
 
■Are the attendees in a hurry? Do your attendees have all afternoon to listen to 
you, or do they need to get back to their regular jobs? Nothing is more frustrating 

756
Part IV: Project Labs
than sitting through a leisurely presentation when you’re watching precious min-
utes tick away. Know your audience’s schedule and their preference for quick versus 
thorough coverage.
Next, think about what you want the outcome of the presentation to be. Although you 
might want more than one outcome, you should try to identify the primary one as your 
main goal. The following outcomes are among those to consider: 
 
■Audience feels good about the topic. Some presentations are strictly cheerlead-
ing sessions, designed to sway the audience’s opinion. Don’t discount this objective 
— it’s a perfectly legitimate reason to make a presentation! For example, suppose 
a new management staff has taken over a factory. The new management team 
might want to reassure the workers that everything is going to be okay. A feel-
good, Welcome to the Team presentation, complete with gimmicks such as company 
T-shirts or hats, can go a long way in this regard.
 
■Audience is informed. Sometimes you need to convey information to a group of 
people, and no decision is involved on their part. For example, suppose your com-
pany has switched insurance carriers and you want to let all of the employees know 
about their new beneﬁ ts. An informational presentation can cover most of the com-
mon questions and save your human resources people a lot of time in answering the 
same questions over and over.
 
■Audience members make individual decisions. This presentation is a kind of 
sales pitch in which you are pitching an idea or product to a group, but each person 
says yes or no individually. For example, suppose you are selling timeshare vacation 
condos. You may give a presentation to a group of 100 people in an attempt to sell 
your package to at least a few members of the group.
This presentation type can also have an informational ﬂ avor; you are informing 
people about their choices without pushing one choice or the other. For example, if 
your employees have a choice of health plans, you might present the pros and cons 
of each plan and then leave it to each employee to make a selection.
 
■Audience makes a group decision. This is the kind of presentation that scares a 
lot of people. You face a group of people who will confer and make a single decision 
based on the information you present. Most sales pitches fall into this category. For 
example, you might be explaining your product to a group of managers to try to get 
their company to buy it.
Think about these factors carefully and try to come up with a single statement that sum-
marizes your audience and purpose. Here are some examples:
 
■I am presenting to 100 factory workers to explain their new health insurance choices 
and teach them how to fill out the necessary forms.
 
■I am presenting to a group of 6 to 10 mid-level managers, trying to get them to decide 
as a group to buy my product.

757
Appendix A: What Makes a Great Presentation?
A
 
■I am presenting to a group of 20 professors to convince at least some of them to use my 
company’s textbooks in their classes.
 
■I am presenting to individual Internet users to explain how my company’s service 
works.
Let’s take that ﬁ rst example. Figure A.1 shows some notes that a presenter might make 
when preparing to explain information about employee beneﬁ ts enrollment to a group of 
factory workers. Jot down your own notes before moving to step 2.
FIGURE A.1
Make notes about your presentation’s purpose and audience. 
Step 2: Choosing Your Presentation Method
You essentially have three ways to present your presentation to your audience, and you 
need to pick the way that you’re going to use up front. These methods include speaker-led, 
self-running, and user-interactive. Within each of those three broad categories, you have 
some additional choices. Before you start creating the presentation in PowerPoint, you 
should know which method you are going to use because it makes a big difference in the 
text and other objects that you put on the slides.

758
Part IV: Project Labs
Speaker-Led Presentations
The speaker-led presentation is the traditional type of presentation: You stand up in front 
of a live audience (or one connected through teleconferencing) and give a speech. The 
slides that you create in PowerPoint become your support materials. The primary message 
comes from you, and the slides and handouts are just helpers.
With this kind of presentation, your slides don’t have to tell the whole story. Each slide 
can contain just a few main points, and you can ﬂ esh out each point in your discussion. In 
fact, this kind of presentation works best when your slides don’t contain a lot of informa-
tion because people pay more attention to you, the speaker, if they’re not trying to read at 
the same time. For example, instead of listing the top ﬁ ve reasons to switch to your ser-
vice, you might have a slide that just reads Why Switch? Five Reasons. The audience has to 
listen to you to ﬁ nd out what the reasons are.
This kind of presentation also requires some special planning. For example, do you want 
to send each audience member home with handouts? If so, you need to prepare them. They 
may or may not be identical to your PowerPoint slides; that’s up to you. You also need to 
learn how to handle PowerPoint’s presentation controls. It can be really embarrassing to be 
ﬁ ddling with the computer controls in the middle of a speech, and so you should practice, 
practice, practice ahead of time.
 
 Handouts and other support materials (such as cards for speaker notes) are covered in Chapter 17, 
“Creating Support Materials.” For more on PowerPoint presentation controls, see Chapter 18, 
“Preparing for a Live Presentation.”
Self-Running Presentations
With a self-running presentation, all of the rules change. Instead of using the slides as 
teasers or support materials, you must make the slides carry the entire show. All of the 
information must be right there because you won’t be looking over the audience’s shoulders 
with helpful narration.
In general, self-running presentations are presented to individuals or very small groups. 
For example, you might set up a kiosk in a busy lobby or a booth at a trade show and have a 
brief but constantly running presentation of perhaps ﬁ ve slides that explains your product 
or service.
Because there is no dynamic human being keeping the audience’s attention, self-running 
presentations must include attention-getting features. Sounds, video clips, interesting 
transitions, and prerecorded narratives are all good ways to attract viewers.
You must also consider the timing in a self-running presentation. Because there is no way 
for a viewer to tell the presentation, “Okay, I’m done reading this slide; bring on the next 
one,” you must carefully plan how long each slide will remain on-screen. This kind of tim-
ing requires some practice!

759
Appendix A: What Makes a Great Presentation?
A
 
 Part II explains how to use sounds, videos, and other moving objects in a presentation to add interest. 
Chapter 19, “Designing User-Interactive or Self-Running Presentations,” deals with timing issues that 
are associated with a self-running presentation as well as how to record voice-over narration.
User-Interactive Presentations
A user-interactive presentation is like a self-running presentation except that the viewer 
has some input. Rather than standing passively by, the viewer can tell PowerPoint when to 
advance a slide. Depending on the presentation’s setup, viewers may also be able to move 
around in the presentation (perhaps to skip over topics that do not interest them) and 
request more information. This type of presentation is typically addressed to a single user 
at a time, rather than a group, and is usually distributed over the Internet, on a company 
intranet, or via CD.
The user runs the presentation using either PowerPoint or a free program called PowerPoint 
Viewer that you can provide for download. 
 
 Chapter 19 explains how to place action buttons on slides so that the viewer can control the action. 
Chapter 20 covers some of the issues involved in preparing a presentation for mass distribution.
Step 3: Choosing Your Delivery Method
Whereas the presentation method is the general conceptual way that the audience interacts 
with the information, the delivery method is the way that you deliver that interaction. 
There’s a subtle but important difference. For example, suppose that you have decided to 
use a speaker-led presentation method. That’s the big picture, but how will you deliver it? 
Will you present from a computer or use 35mm slides or overhead transparencies or just 
plain old handouts? All of these methods fall under the big umbrella of “speaker-led.”
PowerPoint gives you a lot of options for your delivery method. Some of these options are 
more appropriate for speaker-led shows, while others can be used for any presentation 
method. Here are some of the choices:
 
■PowerPoint presentation as a live show. You can use PowerPoint’s Slide Show 
view to play the slides on a computer screen. If necessary, you can also hook up a 
large, external monitor to the PC so that the audience can see it better. This setup 
requires that PowerPoint be installed on the computer at the presentation site. This 
method works for speaker-led, self-running, or user-interactive shows.
 
■PDF or XPS file. You can save your presentation in PDF or XPS format and then 
distribute that ﬁ le in any way you like. You could make it available for download 
from a website, for example, or send it to people via e-mail. However, you lose the 
animation effects, the narration, the timings, and the music.

760
Part IV: Project Labs
 
■Video. You can save the presentation as a video and then distribute the video. 
Unlike with PDF/XPS, you don’t lose any of the audiovisual effects; the audience 
sees the show just as you created it, and they don’t need PowerPoint to see it. 
(They do, however, need a player that can handle the video format in which you 
are distributing the video.) 
 
■Presentation on CD. You can create a CD that contains the presentation. The 
presentation starts automatically when the viewer inserts the CD into a PC. This 
method is most useful for self-running or user-interactive shows.
 
■Broadcast. You can broadcast your presentation on the Internet so that oth-
ers can view it on their own computers in real time. Presentation broadcasting 
has been improved in PowerPoint 2013 and is covered in Chapter 20, “Preparing a 
Presentation for Mass Distribution.”
 
■Overhead transparencies. This is a very old and low-tech method, but it’s still 
an option. You can create overhead transparencies, which are just clear sheets, on 
most printers. During your presentation, you place them on an overhead projector 
one at a time.
Be careful that the transparencies that you buy are designed for your printer! For example, inkjet transparencies will 
melt in a laser printer.
 
■35mm slides. Again, a very old technology, but still available if needed. 35mm 
slides look good and transport well in carousels, but you lose all your special 
effects, such as animation and sounds.
 
■Paper. If there is no projection media available, then your last resort is to dis-
tribute your slides to the audience on paper. If you give them handouts, these 
handouts should be a supplement to an on-screen show and not the main show 
themselves.
 
Chapter 17 covers printing. See Chapter 19 for more on self-running presentations.
Step 4: Choosing a Theme That Matches Your Medium
PowerPoint comes with so many themes and templates that you’re sure to ﬁ nd one that is 
appropriate for your situation. A theme is a set of design settings: background, fonts, col-
ors, and graphic effects. PowerPoint 2013 has many built-in themes that are available in 
every presentation, and you can also create your own themes and use themes that others 
have created and stored in theme ﬁ les. 
A template is a full-ﬂ edged PowerPoint ﬁ le that has been designated as a sample from which 
you can create new presentations. It contains everything that a presentation requires, 

761
Appendix A: What Makes a Great Presentation?
A
including sample slides. A template can also contain multiple themes that are piggybacked 
onto slide masters within the template. When you start a new presentation, you do so from 
a template, and you inherit any themes and sample slides in that template in addition to 
having the built-in themes available.
You aren’t stuck with the color scheme or design that comes with a particular theme or template. As you learn in 
Chapter 4, “Working with Layouts, Themes, and Masters,” you can apply different color, font, and effects themes 
separately from the overall theme.
What’s the best theme to use? What are the best colors? It all depends on the situation and 
on your presentation medium.
If you are lucky enough to have access to a computer-based presentation system, you can 
show your slides on a PC monitor or TV screen. Some large meeting facilities have projectors 
that let you project the image onto very large screens.
Here are some formatting guidelines for presenting on a computer screen:
 
■Fonts. The image on a computer screen is usually nice and sharp, and so you can 
use any font. However, you should ﬁ rst test your presentation on the computer and 
projector from which you’ll be presenting because some fonts may look more jagged 
than others. If you are presenting to a large group on a small screen, make sure you 
keep all of the lettering rather large. Also make sure the font is available on the 
presentation computer; if it’s not there, your text and bullets may not look the way 
you anticipated.
 
■Text color. Go for contrast. Both dark text on a light background and light text on 
a dark background work well.
 
■Background color. A dark background such as dark blue, green, or purple is a good 
choice if the room is not too dark. Light backgrounds can add ambient light to the 
room, which can sometimes be helpful. You are also free to use gradients, shading, 
patterns, pictures, and other special backgrounds because all of these elements dis-
play nicely on most monitors.
 
■Content. You can go all out with your content. Not only can you include both text 
and graphics, you can also include animations, transitions, sounds, and videos.
If you are showing the presentation on a large screen, the following suggestions may be 
helpful:
 
■Fonts. You can use almost any readable font. If your audience will sit far away from 
the screen, stick with plain fonts such as Arial and Calibri for the body text.
 
■Text color. Go for contrast. Try light text on a dark background. My personal favor-
ite for large-format screens is bright yellow text on a navy blue background.

762
Part IV: Project Labs
 
■Background color. Keep it dark — but not black. Light colors make the screen too 
bright. Dark blues, greens, and purples are all good choices. Stick with solid back-
grounds to compensate for any image distortion that occurs on-screen. You should 
avoid patterned, shaded, or clip art backgrounds.
 
■Content. You can use any combination of text and graphics with success, but it has 
to be static. Animations and transitions don’t work with 35mm slides. For example, 
if you have a bulleted list, don’t build the bulleted list one bullet at a time from 
slide to slide. It looks awkward.
Using a noncomputerized overhead projector, like the one your teacher may have had in 
grade school (if you’re middle-aged or older), is never anyone’s ﬁ rst choice. However, some-
times it may be all that is available. An overhead projector image is medium sized (probably 
about 36” × 36”), but often of poor quality. You will probably be ﬁ ghting with room light-
ing, and so your slides may appear washed out. Here are some tips for preparing slides that 
you will be showing with overhead projectors:
 
■Fonts. For headings, choose chunky block fonts, such as Arial Black, that can stand 
up to a certain amount of image distortion. For small type, choose clear, easy-to-
read fonts such as Arial or Calibri. 
 
■Text color. Black letters on a light background stand out well. Avoid semi-dark 
lettering, such as medium blue, because it easily washes out under an overhead 
projector’s powerful light.
 
■Background color. Avoid dark backgrounds. You probably will not position each 
slide perfectly on the overhead projector, and the white space around the edges is 
distracting if your transparencies have a dark background. Consider using a simple 
white background when you know that you’re going to be using transparencies — 
and especially when you want to write on the transparencies.
 
■Content. Keep it simple. Overheads are best when they are text heavy, without a lot 
of fancy extras or clip art. The overhead projector is an old technology, and slides 
that are too dressy seem pretentious.
Step 5: Developing the Content
Your slides should say to the audience, “I had you in mind when I created this.” They 
should also say, “Relax; I’m a professional, and I know what I’m doing.” Good-looking, 
appropriate slides can give the audience a sense of security and can lend authority to your 
message. On the other hand, poorly done or inconsistent slides can tell the audience, “I just 
slapped this thing together at the last minute.” They might even say, “I don’t really know 
what I’m doing.”
Only after you have made all of the decisions in steps 1 through 4 can you start developing 
your content in a real PowerPoint presentation. Now comes the work of writing the text for 
each slide, which most people prefer to do in Normal view. Type the text on the outline or 
on the text placeholder on the slide itself, and you’re ready to roll.

763
Appendix A: What Makes a Great Presentation?
A
Developing your content may include more than just typing text. For example, your con-
tent may include charts (created in PowerPoint or imported from another program such as 
Excel), pictures, and other elements.
Avoiding Information Overload
When presenting, you want to give the audience exactly the information they need and no more. You 
don’t want them to leave clutching their heads and saying, “Wow! That was too much to absorb!” 
or “What a waste of time!” You may have a great deal of information that you need to convey to the 
audience in a very short time. To ensure that they absorb it all without feeling overwhelmed, here are 
a few ideas:
 
■Before you give your presentation, analyze it closely to make sure that you cover 
only the essential topics. By trimming some nonessential topics, you make more room to 
cover the important themes in enough detail.
 
■Don’t try to cram every detail onto your slides. Use the slides for general talking points, 
and then fi ll in the discussion with your speech.
 
■Use SmartArt to replace bullets. As you learn in Chapter 10, you can easily use the 
SmartArt diagrams in PowerPoint in place of a plain bulleted list to make the information 
more memorable and easier to understand.
 
■Provide detailed handouts that elaborate on your slides. Ensure that the audience 
receives them at the beginning of the presentation. Then, refer to the handouts throughout 
the presentation, letting the audience know that they can read all of the details later.
 
■Summarize at the end of the presentation with a few simple slides. These should 
contain bullet points that outline what the audience should have learned. You might even 
want to use interim summary slides throughout a complex presentation.
 
Chapter 3 guides you through the process of creating slides and text boxes. You learn about graphical 
content in Part II of this book. In Lab 1, you learn how to present content without bulleted lists.
Step 6: Creating the Visual Image
The term visual image refers to the overall impression that the audience gets from watch-
ing the presentation. You can create a polished, professional impression by making small 
tweaks to your presentation after you have decided on the content.
You can enhance the visual image by making minor adjustments to the slide’s design. For 
example, you can give a dark slide a warmer feel by using bright yellow instead of white 
for lettering. Repositioning a company logo and making it larger may make the headings 
look less lonely. You can use WordArt effects to dress up some text and make it look more 

764
Part IV: Project Labs
graphical. A product picture is more attractive in a larger size or with a different-colored 
matte around it. It takes practice and experience to add these little touches successfully.
Audiences like consistency. They like visual elements that they can rely on, such as a 
repeated company logo on every slide, accurate page numbering on handouts, and the title 
appearing in exactly the same spot on every slide. You can create a consistent visual image 
by enforcing these rules in your presentation development. It’s easier than you might think 
because PowerPoint provides a slide master speciﬁ cally for images and text that should 
appear on each slide.
 
You’ll work with slide masters and learn more about the benefi ts of consistency in Chapter 4.
Step 7: Adding Multimedia Effects
If you’re creating a self-running presentation, multimedia effects are extremely impor-
tant for developing audience interest. Flashy videos and soundtracks can make even the 
most boring topic fun to hear about, especially for young audiences. How about a trumpet 
announcing the arrival of your new product on the market or a video of your CEO explain-
ing the reasoning behind the recent merger?
Even if you are going to be speaking live, you still might want to incorporate some multimedia elements into your 
show. However, be careful not to let them outshine you or appear gratuitous. Be aware of your audience (see step 1), 
and remember that older and higher-level managers want less fl ash and more substance.
All kinds of presentations can beneﬁ t from slide animations and transitions. Animations are 
simple movements of the objects on a slide. For example, you can make the bullet points 
on a list ﬂ y onto the page one at a time and discuss each one on its own. When the next 
bullet ﬂ ies in, the previous ones can turn a different color so that the current one stands 
out. You might also animate a picture of a car so that it appears to “drive onto” the slide, 
accompanied by the sound of an engine revving. You can also animate charts by making 
data series appear one at a time so that it looks like the chart is building. Transitions are 
animated effects for moving from slide to slide. The most basic and boring transition is to 
simply remove one slide from the screen and replace it with another. However, you can also 
use many alternative effects such as zooming the new slide in; sliding it from the top, bot-
tom, left, or right; or creating a fade-in transition effect.
 
Chapters 14 and 15 deal with the mechanics of placing sound and video clips into a presentation and 
controlling when and how they play. You can learn about animations and transitions in Chapter 16.

765
Appendix A: What Makes a Great Presentation?

Step 8: Creating the Handouts and Notes
This step is applicable only to speaker-led presentations. With a live audience, you may 
want to provide handouts so that they can follow along. Handouts can be verbatim copies 
of your slides or abbreviated versions with only the most basic information included as a 
memory jogger. Handouts can be either black and white or in color, and PowerPoint pro-
vides several handout formats. For example, you can print from one to nine slides per page 
or export the slides to a Word document with or without lines so the audience can write 
additional notes.
A continual debate rages in the professional speakers’ community over when to give out handouts. Some people feel 
that if you distribute handouts beforehand, people will read them and then not listen to the presentation. Others feel 
that if you distribute handouts after the presentation, people will frantically try to take their own notes during the 
presentation or will not follow the ideas as easily. There’s no real right or wrong answer, it seems, and so you should 
distribute them whenever it makes the most sense for your situation.
As the speaker, you may need your own special set of handouts with your own notes that 
the audience should not see. PowerPoint calls these notes pages, and there is a special view 
for creating them. (You can also enter notes directly into the Notes pane in Normal view.)
 
 Notes are covered, along with handouts, in Chapter 17, which also guides you through selecting the 
appropriate size and format for your handouts as well as working with your printer to get the best 
results.
Step 9: Rehearsing the Presentation
No matter which type of presentation you are creating (speaker led, self-running, or user 
interactive), you need to rehearse it. However, the goals for rehearsing are different for 
each type.
Rehearsing a Live Presentation
When you rehearse a live presentation, you check the presentation slides to ensure that 
they are complete, accurate, and in the right order. You may need to rearrange them and 
hide some of them for backup-only use.
You should also rehearse using PowerPoint’s presentation tools in Presenter view, which 
displays each slide on a monitor and lets you move from slide to slide, take notes, assign 
action items, and even draw directly on a slide. Make sure you know how to back up, how 
to jump to the beginning or end, and how to display one of your backup slides.

766
Part IV: Project Labs
 
You can learn about presentation navigation skills in Chapter 18.
Rehearsing a Self-Running Presentation
With a speaker-led presentation, the presenter can ﬁ x any glitches that pop up or explain 
away any errors. With a self-running presentation, you don’t have that luxury. The presen-
tation itself is your emissary. Therefore, you must go over it repeatedly, checking it many 
times to make sure that it is perfect before distributing it. Nothing is worse than a self-
running presentation that doesn’t run or one that contains an embarrassing error.
The most important feature in a self-running presentation is timing. You must make the 
presentation pause for the correct amount of time so that the audience can read the text 
on each slide. The pause must be long enough so that even slow readers can catch it all but 
short enough so that fast readers do not become bored. You can now see how difﬁ cult this 
can be to make perfect.
PowerPoint has a Rehearse Timings feature that is designed to help you with this task. It 
lets you show the slides and advance them manually after the correct amount of time has 
passed. The Rehearse Timings feature records how much time you spend on each slide and 
gives you a report so that you can modify the timing if necessary. For example, you may 
be working on a presentation that is supposed to last 10 minutes, but with your timings, it 
comes out to only 9 minutes. You can add additional time for each slide to stretch it out 
to last the full 10 minutes. You may also want to record voice-over narration for your pre-
sentation. You can also rehearse this, to make sure the voice matches the slide that it is 
supposed to describe (which is absolutely crucial, as you can imagine!).
Rehearsing a User-Interactive Presentation
In a user-interactive presentation, you provide the readers with on-screen buttons that 
they can click to move through the presentation, so timing is not an issue. The crucial 
factor with a user-interactive presentation is link accuracy. Each button on each slide is 
a link. When your readers click a button for the next slide, it must take them to the next 
slide and not to somewhere else. And if you include a hyperlink to a web address on the 
Internet, when the readers click it, the web browser should open and that page should 
appear. If the hyperlink contains a typo and the readers see File Not Found instead of the 
web page, the error reﬂ ects poorly on you. Chapter 20 covers creating and inserting 
these links. 
Step 10: Giving the Presentation
For a user-interactive or self-running presentation, giving the presentation is somewhat 
anticlimactic. You just make it available and the users watch it. Yawn.

767
Appendix A: What Makes a Great Presentation?
A
However, for a speaker-led presentation, giving the speech is the highlight, the pinnacle, of 
the process. If you’ve done a good job rehearsing, you are already familiar with PowerPoint’s 
presentation controls. You should be prepared to back up, to skip ahead, to answer ques-
tions by displaying hidden slides, or to pause the whole thing (and black out the screen) so 
that you can hold a tangential discussion.
 
Chapter 18 covers all of the situations in which you would use PowerPoint’s presentation controls in 
case you need to review them.
What remains now? Nothing, except for setting up the room and overcoming your stage 
fright. Later in this chapter, you’ll get some tips about using a meeting room most effec-
tively and being a dynamic speaker. Check them out — and then go get ’em!
If you are planning to distribute your presentation through the Internet, you have a big 
decision to make. You can distribute the presentation in its native PowerPoint format 
and preserve all of its more exciting features, such as animations and videos. However, 
not everyone on the Internet owns a copy of PowerPoint, and so you are limiting your 
audience. 
Another option is to save the presentation in PDF or XPS format. These are similar formats; 
PDF format is owned by Adobe, and XPS format is owned by Microsoft. Viewers need Adobe 
Reader (free from www.adobe.com) or Microsoft XPS Reader (comes with Windows Vista 
and later or free from www.microsoft.com). This converts the slides to a series of static 
pages with no multimedia effects, but everyone can view it, provided they have or down-
load the appropriate viewer.
You could also save the presentation as a series of graphic ﬁ les, in any of several popular 
formats (GIF, JPEG, PNG, or TIFF). With this method, you not only lose all multimedia capa-
bility, you also lose a sense of continuity because the viewer must load and view each slide 
individually in the correct order.
Finally, you can save the presentation as a video (movie) clip and make that available 
online. PowerPoint 2013 provides a very easy-to-use interface for making videos in the 
MPEG-4 and Windows Media Video (WMV) formats. You lose none of the effects, but the 
audience is at your mercy in terms of timing; they can’t ﬂ ip quickly through the slides to 
skim them. They can jump to spots in the video using the video player, but jumping from 
slide to slide is iffy, especially if the amount of time spent on each slide is inconsistent. 
 
You learn more about preparing a presentation for the Internet in Chapter 20. For more on saving a 
movie clip and making it available online, see Chapter 15.

Step 11: Assessing Your Success and Refi ning Your Work
If giving a presentation is a one-time thing for you — great. It’s over, and you never have 
to think about it again. However, it is more likely that you will have to give another pre-
sentation someday, somewhere, and so you shouldn’t drive the experience out of your mind 
just yet. Perhaps you learned something that might be useful to you later. Immediately 
after the presentation, while it is still fresh in your mind, jot down your responses to the 
following questions. Then keep them on ﬁ le to refer to later, the next time you have to do 
a presentation!
 
■Did the colors and design of the slides seem appropriate?
 
■Could everyone in the audience read the slides easily?
 
■Did the audience look mostly at you, at the screen, or at the handouts? Was that 
what you intended?
 
■Did the audience take notes as you were speaking? If so, did you give them hand-
outs with note-taking lines to write on?
 
■Was the length of the presentation appropriate? Did the audience become bored or 
restless at any point?
 
■Were there any slides that you wished you had prepared but didn’t?
 
■Were there any slides that you would omit if you were doing it over?
 
■Did your speaker notes give you enough help that you could speak with authority?
 
■Did the transitions and animations add to the entertainment value, or were they 
distracting or corny?
 
■Did the sound and video clips play with adequate quality? Were they appropriate 
and useful?
Choosing and Arranging the Room
Are you giving a live presentation? The choice of room — and its arrangement — can make 
a big difference in your success. If you have any say in it, make sure that you get an appro-
priate size room for the presentation. For example, a room that is too small makes people 
feel uncomfortable and seems crowded, whereas a room that is too large can create a false 
formality and distance that can cause people to lose focus. You also don’t want to have to 
shout to be heard.
To avoid having to shout during your presentation, make sure there is a working sound system, with a microphone and 
amplifi er available, if necessary. If possible, check this detail a few days ahead of time to avoid scrambling for one at 
the last minute.

769

Next, make sure that tables and chairs are set up appropriately. Figure A.2 through Figure 
A.5 illustrate several setups, each of which is appropriate for a certain kind of presentation:
 
■For a classroom setting where the audience will take a lot of notes, give them some-
thing to write on, as shown in Figure A.2. This arrangement works well when the 
audience will be listening to and interacting with you but not with one another.
FIGURE A.2
In a classroom arrangement, each audience member has plenty of room to write and 
work.

■If the audience is not expected to take notes while you are giving the speech, con-
sider an auditorium setup, as shown in Figure A.3. This arrangement is also good 
for ﬁ tting a lot of people into a small room. (This is also known as theater-style 
seating.)
FIGURE A.3

■If you want the audience to interact in small groups, you should set up groups so 
that people can see each other and still see you. Figure A.4 shows a small-group 
arrangement.
FIGURE A.4
Having small groups clustered around tables encourages discussion and works well 
for presentations that incorporate hands-on activities.

■To make it easier for the entire group to interact with one another as a whole, use a

Appendix A: What Makes a Great Presentation?

Choosing Your Attire
The outﬁ t that you choose for the presentation should depend on the expectations of the 
audience and the message that you want to send to them. Before you decide what to wear, 
ask yourself, “What will the audience be wearing?” Choose one of these classiﬁ cations:
 
■Very informal. Jeans, shorts, T-shirts
 
■Informal. Nice jeans, polo shirts
 
■Business casual. Dress slacks and oxfords, with or without a tie, for men; dress 
slacks or a skirt and a dressy, casual shirt (sweater, silk blouse, vest) for women
 
■Business. Dress slacks and a shirt and tie, with or without a jacket, for men; dress 
or skirt (blazer optional) for women
 
■Business formal. Suit and tie for men; suit or conservative dress for women
Now, shape your own choice of attire, depending on the impression that you want to con-
vey. To convey authority, dress one level above your audience. Use this attire any time 
your audience does not know who you are and when you need to establish yourself as the 
leader or the expert. (Most teachers fall into this category.) For example, if the audience is 
dressed informally, men should wear a dress shirt and tie and women should wear a skirt 
and sweater. (If you’re female and will be seated on a stage, you might want to wear pants 
or a very long skirt.) However, you should not dress more than two levels above your audi-
ence because it makes them feel intimidated. For example, if you are presenting to factory 
workers who are dressed in very informal clothing, you should not wear a business suit.
To convey teamwork and approachability, dress at the same level as the audience, or 
slightly (no more than one level) above. For example, if you are a CEO visiting a factory 
that you manage, the workers already recognize your authority — you don’t have to prove 
it. Instead, you want to appear approachable, and so if they are wearing informal clothing, 
you might wear dress slacks and a dress shirt (but no tie) if you’re a man or slacks and a 
sweater if you’re a woman.
Avoid dressing below the audience’s level. This is almost never a good idea. If you do not 
know what the audience will be wearing, err on the side of formality. It is better to look a 
little stiff than it is to look less professional than your audience.
Keeping the Audience Interested
There are no miracle cures here — some people are naturally better, more interesting 
speakers than others. However, there are deﬁ nite steps that all speakers can take to stack 
the odds in their favor when it comes to giving a successful live presentation.

772
Part IV: Project Labs
Speech Techniques
Here are some strategies for improving your speaking style:
 
■Plant your feet firmly; don’t pace. Pacing makes you appear nervous, and people 
have to constantly follow you with their eyes. However, you should keep your 
upper body mobile and should not be afraid to use arm gestures.
 
■Use gestures to support your voice. If you are talking about three different 
points, then hold up ﬁ ngers to illustrate one, two, and three points. If you are talk-
ing about bringing things together, bring your hands together in front of you to 
illustrate. Don’t freeze your hands at your sides.
 
■Don’t memorize your speech. If someone asks a question, it will throw you off and 
you’ll forget where you were.
 
■Conversely, don’t read the speech word for word from your notes. Notes should 
contain keywords and facts but not the actual words that you will say.
 
■Don’t talk with your face in your notes. Make eye contact with an audience mem-
ber before you begin speaking.
 
■Pick a few people in the audience, in different places in the room, and make 
direct eye contact with each of them, in turn, as you speak. Talk directly to a 
single person for the duration of the point that you are making and then move on. 
Also, don’t forget to smile!
 
■Don’t be afraid to pause. Speaking slowly, with pauses to look at your notes, is 
much more preferable than rushing through the presentation. Keep in mind that 
pauses that might seem very long to you really aren’t.
 
■Don’t stare at or read your slides. Focus your attention on your audience, and pay 
as little attention to the support materials as possible while you speak. You want to 
engage directly with your audience to deliver your message in your own words.
 
■Emphasize verbs and action words in your presentation. Remember that the verb 
is the most powerful element in the sentence.
Content Tips
Consider these content techniques:
 
■If the audience is not in a hurry and you are not rushed for time in your presenta-
tion, start with some kind of icebreaker, like an anecdote or joke.
Be careful with humor. Analyze the joke that you plan to tell from all angles, making very sure that it does not include 
offensive references to race, ethnic group, gender, sexual orientation, or class of workers. It is much worse to tell a 
joke that hurts someone’s feelings — even one person — than it is to tell none at all.

773
Appendix A: What Makes a Great Presentation?
A
 
■Include the audience in interactive exercises that help to ﬁ rm up their understand-
ing of the topic.
 
■Ask questions to see whether the audience understood you, and give out small 
prizes to the people who give correct answers. Nothing energizes an audience into 
participation more than prizes, even if they are cheap giveaways like key chains 
and bandannas.
 
■If possible, split the presentation into two or more sessions, with a short break and 
question-and-answer period between each session.
 
■During the Q&A portion, turn off the slide projector, overhead, or computer screen 
so that people focus on you and on the question, not on the previous slide. If turn-
ing off the equipment isn’t practical, consider inserting a simple Q&A Session title 
slide or a blank slide that displays during the Q&A, or press the B key (for a black 
screen) or the W key (for a white screen). 
Managing Stage Fright
Even if you’re comfortable with the PowerPoint slides that you’ve created, you still might 
be a little nervous about the actual speech that you’re going to give. This is normal. In 
fact, a study from a few years ago showed that public speaking is the number-one fear 
among businesspeople. Fear of death came in second. That should tell you something.
It’s okay to be a little bit nervous because it gives you extra energy and an edge that can 
actually make your presentation better. However, if you’re too nervous, it can make you 
seem less credible.
One way to overcome stage fright is to stop focusing on yourself and instead focus on your 
audience. Ask yourself what the audience needs and how you are going to supply that need. 
Become their caretaker. Dedicate yourself to making the audience understand you. The 
more you think of others, the less you think of yourself.
Summary
Although this appendix had little to do with PowerPoint per se, it focused on making suc-
cessful presentations using your PowerPoint slides as a tool. The information that you 
learned here can help beginning presenters look more experienced and more experienced 
presenters polish their skills to perfection.

kyDrive is a Microsoft-owned cloud-based storage space. Each user has their own storage area, 
where they can store private ﬁ les, share ﬁ les with certain speciﬁ c others, or make ﬁ les pub-
licly available. A certain amount of storage space is free, and you can pay if you want more 
than what’s provided. (The amount of storage space available depends on when you signed up for 
your account and what type of account you have.)
As you’ve seen in your work with PowerPoint throughout this book, your SkyDrive is your default 
save location for PowerPoint and other Ofﬁ ce apps. Using SkyDrive as your main document storage 
area has these consequences:
 
■You can access your ﬁ les from any computer, whether or not it has PowerPoint installed 
on it.
 
■You can share your work with other people without having to send them separate copies 
of it.
 
■Your ﬁ les are available only when Internet access is available. However, you can get around 
that by installing the SkyDrive for Windows app on your PC, which automatically mirrors 
the content of your SkyDrive on your PC and keeps the copy in sync with the SkyDrive’s 
actual content.
There are several ways of accessing your SkyDrive. This appendix covers the four major ways: 
 
■Access your SkyDrive space on the Web via www.skydrive.com. 
 
■Use the SkyDrive for Windows desktop app.
 
■Use the SkyDrive links within PowerPoint when saving or opening ﬁ les.
 
■Use the Windows 8 SkyDrive app on a PC or tablet that has Windows 8 installed.

776
Part IV: Project Labs
Understanding Your SkyDrive Interface Options
The following sections explain the four methods of accessing your SkyDrive.
Signing into the SkyDrive Web Interface
Some SkyDrive management activities can be performed only via the SkyDrive web 
interface, so you should know how to access it. To get started, point your browser to 
www.skydrive.com. (The page will redirect to the server where Microsoft is hosting 
SkyDrive at the moment. As of this writing it is https://skydrive.live.com, but by 
the time you read this, it may have changed.)
If you already have a Microsoft account and your computer is set up to automatically sign 
you into it, your SkyDrive’s content appears automatically. Figure B.1 shows an example, 
but you may have different ﬁ les and folders than shown. From this interface you can click 
folders and ﬁ les to open them or use the buttons on the toolbar at the top of the window to 
perform other actions. I’ll tell you more about those actions later in this appendix.
FIGURE B.1

Installing and Using SkyDrive for Windows 
To get around the drawback of not being able to access your SkyDrive ﬁ les ofﬂ ine, and to 
make managing SkyDrive ﬁ les as easy as managing your local ﬁ les, install the SkyDrive for 
Windows app on your PC. 
The SkyDrive for Windows app automatically mirrors the content of your SkyDrive on 
your PC and keeps the copy in sync with the SkyDrive’s actual content. When you are not

connected to the Internet, it allows you to work on local copies of your ﬁ les, and then it 
automatically uploads the updates to your SkyDrive the next time Internet connectivity is 
available. The SkyDrive for Windows app also places a shortcut to your locally mirrored cop-
ies of your SkyDrive content on the Favorites list in File Explorer (or Windows Explorer), so 
you can easily access them with one click.
To get SkyDrive for Windows, open the SkyDrive web interface, as described in the 
preceding section, and then in the navigation pane at the left, click the Get SkyDrive 
Apps hyperlink. From there, ﬁ nd and follow the link for the Windows desktop apps. Click 
Download Now and follow the prompts to complete the installation. (I’m being intention-
ally vague about the steps here because by the time you read this, they may have changed; 
Microsoft updates its websites frequently.)
After SkyDrive for Windows has been installed, you’ll see a SkyDrive shortcut in the 
Favorites list in File Explorer (Windows 8) or Windows Explorer (Windows 7). This shortcut 
points to a folder on your hard drive: C:\Users\username\SkyDrive. This folder is a 
staging area for your online SkyDrive and is automatically synchronized with it. Figure B.2 
shows my SkyDrive folder on my hard drive, for example. Notice that each icon has a green 
check mark on it, indicating that it has been synchronized. In other words the copies on 
my SkyDrive are identical to these copies on my local machine. When the copies are out 
of sync because an update hasn’t occurred yet, a pair of blue arrows appears on the icon 
to indicate a sync is scheduled or in progress. If there is a problem with a sync (such as 
Internet unavailability), a red x symbol appears on the icon to indicate that.

Managing SkyDrive Files Within PowerPoint
As you saw in Chapter 2, “Creating and Saving Presentation Files,” you can save and open 
ﬁ les on your SkyDrive from within PowerPoint. When you choose Save As from the File 
menu, the default save location is your SkyDrive. You can click Browse to browse your 
SkyDrive’s content, or you can click one of the folder names under Recent Folders to access 
one of the folders within your SkyDrive.
Using the Windows 8 SkyDrive App
If you are running Windows 8, you can access the Windows 8 SkyDrive app from the Start 
screen. It’s a tablet-style app optimized for touchscreens, like the other new Windows 8–
style applications. Access it from the SkyDrive tile on the Start screen.
Within the SkyDrive app you will see your folders listed to the left, with picture previews 
of the folders’ content if available. To the right of the folders, you’ll see tiles for any ﬁ les 
that are stored at the top level of your SkyDrive’s organizational system, not in any par-
ticular folder. Right-click to open a command bar at the bottom of the screen, and choose 
commands from it to work with your content. Figure B.3 shows the command bar open. 
Using the commands on the command bar, you can do all the basic ﬁ le management tasks 
from the Windows 8 SkyDrive app, such as uploading and downloading, creating new fold-
ers, deleting, renaming, and moving. (Those latter three commands are on a submenu when 
you choose Manage.)

would be considered uploading or downloading, respectively, and which were covered 
earlier in this chapter). Table B.4 explains how to move and copy ﬁ les or folders on your

Sharing SkyDrive Files
You can easily share your SkyDrive ﬁ les with other people. There are a variety of ways to 
do so. You can send email, post a link to Facebook, or create a hyperlink that you can then 

784
Part IV: Project Labs
share with others any way you like (such as pasting it into the HTML for a web page or 
pasting it into an instant messaging program). 
Sharing is conﬁ gured primarily through the web interface; the other interfaces aren’t 
designed for doing it. However, in some cases you can access a command in another inter-
face that will automatically open the web interface and start the sharing process. Table B.6 
summarizes the methods of sharing.
