Foreword
As individuals in organizations, our daily lives are filled
with ideas to turn into reality, myriad problems to be solved,
lists of core business needs to be fulfilled, and many team
and people challenges to be overcome. Regardless of the
size of your organization, your position within it, the nature
of your product or service, or the impact you have on the
world, you play an important part in solving big problems
and creating amazing and innovative products and services.
As a leader, I value simplicity. The success with which I can
make good decisions, decouple difficult dependencies, and
give good guidance to my team tends to improve in direct
proportion to how simply I can articulate the problems and
the outcomes I would like to achieve. This clarity is needed
at all levels, whether you are steering a company, leading a
team, or contributing to a project as an individual.
So how do you take on these big complex challenges while
keeping things simple, focused, and clearly articulated?
Eewei has written a book that will inspire innovation while
helping you manage the complexities of modern business
problems. It describes an approach that employs a simple
metaphor—one of cooking, using ingredients and recipes
to “cook up” success. This approach gives you two very
important tools.
Firstly, the book details many tested ingredients from which
to build your recipes. Everyone knows that in any recipe,
quality ingredients are key. Eewei adds his own secret
sauces, giving you 101 broadly applicable and highly valu-
able ingredients that come from his extensive experience
solving significant business problems and creating delightful
products and solutions. He includes ingredients that speak
report erratum  •  discuss
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
to team and motivation, and ingredients that discuss busi-
ness, feature, and prioritization needs. Most importantly,
he includes ingredients that help foster innovative and
differentiated thinking.
Secondly, the book gives structure to the act of simplifying
complex scenarios. Eewei’s approach asks you to create a
recipe for a solution, a recipe that breaks down a problem
into the multiple ingredients necessary to achieve a success-
ful outcome for the innovation or business problem at hand.
You can use this structured approach in a variety of ways.
You can use it on your own, perhaps as an aid to deeper
thinking. You can use it in a team setting to help brainstorm
a problem. Or perhaps you can use it to articulate a direction
to a team in a manageable and understandable way. The
recipe metaphor feels really natural and easy to use.
Of course, quality ingredients and a good recipe are keys to
baking your “solution cake,” but that’s not all that’s needed.
The real value comes when you bring your own insights
and experiences to the process. Eewei uses some of his
ingredients to pull together a number of sample recipes for
common situations, using well-known companies as exam-
ples. This really helps you to see the possibilities this
approach can provide, and will kick-start your thinking as
you begin to use recipes to tackle your biggest challenges.
By using Eewei’s ingredients (and maybe some of your own!)
to write a customized recipe for your problem or business
aspiration, you can consciously and deliberately move your
projects forward based on a clear and concise recipe for
success.
Happy baking!

Introduction
Technology and business teams continue to deliver products
and services to solve bigger and bigger real-world issues. It
doesn’t really matter whether you’re in the design, television,
music, Internet, publishing, consultancy, software, market-
ing, finance, healthcare, or some other industry—many of
the big problems facing teams today are the same. How do
we innovate? How do we work better as a team? What
problems are we meant to be solving? How do we keep our
customers happy?
101 Design Ingredients is more than a book. It’s a lightweight,
supereasy-to-digest problem-solving toolset. You’ll learn
how to apply to your projects insights from leaders in the
design-thinking, agile, lean-startup, product, entertainment,
and business-strategy worlds. Your team isn’t facing any-
thing today that hasn’t already been tackled before. This
book will help you and your team work together to better
understand problems so you can come up with solutions
quickly, easily, and confidently.
Let’s face it: we could all use a little more time to get things
right, but we often don’t get it. Sometimes all you need is a
quick flash of inspiration to get you through your project. I
wrote 101 Design Ingredients to help you get reinspired. Use
it when you need a boost to keep you going. Start from the
beginning to kick-start a project, inject some creativity when
you’re stuck in a rut, or pick up speed near the end to finish
strong. It doesn’t matter where you are in your project or
what problem you’re facing—there’s always a solution.
You’ll never again think twice about tackling problems, and
you’ll work well together with your team to solve them.

Who This Book Is For
If you’ve ever worked on a project where changing customer
needs, business goals, and market requirements play a vital
part in defining success, this book is for you. No matter
whether you’re a designer, developer, project manager,
business stakeholder, startup founder, product owner,
business analyst, usability researcher, branding expert, or
marketing or sales staff, this book will give you practical
advice to challenge and help you work as part of a team to
solve problems.
The ingredients and recipes in this book will help you,
whether you’re a beginner starting out on your first technol-
ogy project or a seasoned professional who has been tackling
the same big problems for years and needs a fresh approach.
How To Read This Book
101 Design Ingredients is a quick-reference guide that tech
teams can use to identify and solve problems fast. It’s perfect
for your morning commute, a quick read before going to
bed, or even an elevator ride. The bite-sized ingredients and
recipes are easily consumable in short periods of time. Glance
down the list of ingredients and apply the useful hints and
tips to solve your biggest problems immediately. It’s really
that easy.
If your team and your business find it hard to just identify
the right problems, 101 Design Ingredients will help you
prioritize and then will act as a catalyst, each ingredient
providing simple, practical advice you can start using at any
point in a project.
The first four sections of the book correspond to the four
stages of a project: Ingredients to Get You Started, Ingredi-
ents to Keep You Going, Ingredients to Help You Cross the
Finish Line, and Ingredients to Get More of What You Want.
You can start with the stage of the project that you’re in now,
or dive straight into any ingredient that strikes your fancy.
In part V you’ll see ten real-world case studies of how com-
panies combined the ingredients to create their own recipes
for success, and you’ll learn how to apply the ingredients to
meet your own specific needs in a matter of minutes.

“It isn’t that they can’t see the solution. It is that they can’t see
the problem.”
—Gilbert K. Chesterton, writer
The Problem
Teams constantly fire-fight instead of tackling bigger issues
because companies want instant gratification: any result as
long as it immediately satisfies stakeholders and customers.
The Solution
Solve the real big issues, and you’ll solve related ones too.
• Ask questions. I like asking “five whys.”
4 Start with why
a specific problem exists and note the main reason. Next
ask why this main reason exists. Do this at least four
more times, questioning the last main reason each time.
The last problem is a possible root cause you should
address.
• Prioritize. In most situations there are multiple root
causes,
5 so prioritize which ones to tackle based on
urgency, size of impact, subsequent problems solved,
dependency, and ease of resolution.
• Track improvements. Take note of new problems that
arise and any that persist. Add these to an up-to-date
list so you don’t lose track of them. Identify related
issues and group those together. Put measures in place
to prevent problems from occurring again.

“People’s behavior makes sense if you think about it in terms of
their goals, needs, and motives.”
—Thomas Mann, writer, critic, and Nobel Prize laureate
The Problem
Customers leave when there’s nothing special to keep them
loyal to a brand’s product or service.
The Solution
Target a customer’s deepest desires and solve problems that
really annoy them.
• Get real. Gain firsthand experience of what customers
actually do and feel. Martin Belam, from The Guardian
newspaper, conducted guerrilla usability testing in
public places to better understand customer needs in a
natural environment.
7
• Identify barriers. Find out what’s stopping customers
from completing important tasks. Create situations more
conducive to success. I refer to cognitive models like BJ
Fogg’s behavior model, which shows it is possible to
motivate and train people to overcome barriers using
well-timed “triggers” to increase their likelihood of
success.
8
• Co-design. I’ve worked with customers to visualize
better solutions to a problem together. Don’t take their
suggestions too literally, though, because most of the
time they won’t know what they mean until you show
it to them.

“Efforts and courage are not enough without purpose and
direction.”
—John F. Kennedy, 35th president of the United States
The Problem
Stakeholders don’t understand what teams do, so they look
elsewhere to invest their time and money.
The Solution
Clearly define your team’s purpose and process. Show how
it fits within the overall business model.
• Be easily understood. Write a mission statement that
clearly illustrates how you intend to meet business and
customer needs. Make this your mantra and publicize
it. Clarify key roles and responsibilities within the team
so there is no misunderstanding about who does what.
• Create a set of design principles and make them measur-
able.
9 I always assign measurable metrics to applied
principles to make them easier to understand and more
tangible to an organization. For example, simplicity can
be measured via a metric such as “Provide one-click
purchasing from any page to reduce time to purchase
by fifty percent.”
• Be consistent.
10 Create a strong brand that permeates
everything you and your team do. All marketing,
branding, stationery, photos, illustrations, presentations,
and talks should have a consistent look and feel so there
is no mistaking that they are from your team. Don’t send
out confusing or mixed messages; they make you look
unprofessional.

“The unexamined life is not worth living.”
—Socrates, philosopher
The Problem
Organizations see delays in projects because they don’t
identify vital dependencies before starting.
The Solution
Identify risks, assumptions, issues, and dependencies that
may cause you to fail.
• Conduct a pre-mortem.
11 Using experiences from similar
projects is a good way to identify risks, assumptions,
issues, and dependencies early and assess their impact
hypothetically, before they happen.
• Get answers. Use exploratory testing to uncover prob-
lems.
12 Establish what you will lose if you don’t fully
understand unknown risks or assumptions, especially
if you have a feeling they will influence the success of
your project.
• Get help. Identify allies you can work with. Don’t do it
all yourself if someone else can do it better for you. Make
a list of preferred partners and technology, then high-
light the strengths and weaknesses of each to help you
choose who and what is most appropriate when the
time comes. Focus on what you can influence directly
and let people you trust help you with everything else.

“Ability is nothing without opportunity.”
—Napoleon Bonaparte, emperor of France 1804–1815
The Problem
Companies struggle to come up with the next Facebook,
Twitter, or Google but fail to realize these companies didn’t
try to be like anyone else.
The Solution
Look at changes in technology, human psychology, and
economics to create opportunities to try something new.
• Stay informed. Up-to-date resources in the form of
papers, websites, blogs, books, seminars, competitor
analyses, trend reports, and trade shows are abundant.
I attend events and absorb RSS feeds that align with my
professional interests, always looking for new opportu-
nities, especially ones the competition has overlooked.
13
• Be curious and open-minded. Don’t be set in your own
ways; instead, put your beliefs aside and observe the
world with an untainted perspective. I look for what
other people are interested in and ask “why” and “what
if” when I challenge my teams to notice something
different.
• Look across markets. Don’t limit your sources of inspi-
ration and miss important changes in customer behavior.
Look to new markets where other customers are already
showing interest in a particular area. I love talking to
new clients in new industries to see if I can help them
to evolve their existing brands and future vision.

“A discovery is said to be an accident meeting a prepared mind.”
—Albert Szent-Györgyi, physiologist and Nobel Prize
laureate
The Problem
Companies fail to realize the potential of putting the right
technology, people, customer needs, and business goals
together.
The Solution
Combine what makes sense to achieve success, and highlight
the risks of not connecting the dots.
• Learn from the past. Create a knowledge-management
tool to help your team find, reuse, and adapt insights
from the past.
14 Different departments will also find it
useful for locating design best practices and usability
reports. Job done.
• Start small. Prove smaller ideas can be successful before
attacking bigger assumptions and ideas. Whisk, for
instance, is a mobile app that started as a simple ingredient-
matching service and now has powerful semantic and
linguistic analysis to improve recipe recommendations.
15
• Affect the bigger picture. Assess the impact of changes
holistically.
16 Aim to own strategic changes across all
customer experiences to better advise stakeholders on
which projects make sense to be worked on next.

“A wise man gets more use from his enemies than a fool from his
friends.”
—Baltasar Gracián, Jesuit and writer
The Problem
Companies fail to capitalize on great opportunities until it’s
too late.
The Solution
Conduct competitor analysis and try to stay one step ahead
at all times.
• Become a customer. Experience a competitor’s products
and services. Try to get feedback from other customers,
too, and compare product offerings using benchmarking
tests to highlight deficiencies as well as areas for
improvement.
17
• Monitor social media. Track brand sentiment across
popular social networks. Compare customer-service
quality and response times. I always recommend social
networks like Facebook as an effective way to handle
customer-service issues.
18
• Do it first. Create, combine, remove, or change function-
ality while factoring in market opportunities and the
latest customer trends, especially ones competitors are
aware of. Try to reduce your team’s cycle time to deliver
on competitors’ own promises first and in a better way.

“Imagination is everything. It is the preview of life’s upcoming
attractions.”
—Albert Einstein, theoretical physicist
The Problem
If teams can’t see what they’re aiming for, they’ll never build
it right.
The Solution
Clarify the end goal and reduce risk by managing change
effectively.
• Create a press release. Make an announcement to convey
the benefits and value of what you are building. I regu-
larly remind people that they are creating something
important. Amazon did this with the Kindle Fire.
20
• Clarify roles and responsibilities. List what you need to
do each step of the way, and decide who is responsible
for delivering each crucial part. Check to make sure
team members are happy to be accountable for relevant
business, development, and design decisions. A RACI
(Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed)
matrix is a great way to get an overview of what roles
are required at key stages of a project.
21
• Beware of moving goal posts. You can manage scope
creep by getting stakeholders to sign off on clear
requirements.
22 Changes and additional work are OK;
just be sure to realign expectations accordingly and keep
them up-to-date on your progress.

“An empty head is not really empty; it is stuffed with rubbish.
Hence the difficulty of forcing anything into an empty head.”
—Eric Hoffer, writer and Presidential Medal of Freedom
award winner
The Problem
Fixing the wrong problems is expensive.
The Solution
Source the correct information before starting any project.
• Bring your research data up-to-date. Conduct user
observations to see how customers perform important
tasks.
23 Take note of surprising insights and remove
things that no longer hold true.
• Define the problem type.
24 For example, are you
increasing the speed of downloads or the accuracy of
the information being returned? Challenge and reset
expectations so you get the information you really need.
• Raise the quality bar.
25 Create guidelines and set up
thresholds to filter out insufficient and poor-quality
information. Reduce errors down the line by increasing
the accuracy and depth of information needed, then
having conversations in person to align expectations in
order to correctly achieve desired design experiences.

“Let him who would enjoy a good future waste none of his
present.”
—Roger Babson, educator and business theorist
The Problem
Organizations can’t decide how best to remain competitive.
The Solution
Consider the past, present, and future.
• Look at the past. Review previous case studies and
understand why they failed.
26 Decide if it was because
of bad timing, a wrong approach, or unavailable tech-
nology. Use these insights and see if they can be applied
more effectively today.
• Look at the present. Conduct market research to high-
light opportunities to pivot or to improve ideas.
27
Understand what’s trending outside your industry, too;
leverage macro trends (for example, crowdsourcing and
gamification
28) that customers are actively involved in
and see if you can incorporate them into your current
scope of work.
• Look to the future. Once you’ve brainstormed a vision,
try creating a purpose-alignment chart to visually posi-
tion these new ideas.
29 This will help stakeholders
understand the value and prioritize which are the most
important ideas. Remove anything that doesn’t differen-
tiate or improve your current brand or product offering,
and keep what you need to remain competitive.

“Live your beliefs and you can turn the world around.”
—Henry David Thoreau, author, poet, and philosopher
The Problem
Companies that continue doing what they’ve always done
find it hard to innovate.
The Solution
Get your team to challenge the status quo to create some-
thing less predictable.
• Change a belief. Identify one thing that can greatly
improve what you do today, even if you don’t think it
will work. Deliberately create a problem scenario and
come up with as many solutions as possible—for
example, if it’s hard to decide what to eat on your own,
would it be possible to use an individual’s graph profile,
location, and crowdsourced recommendations to suggest
new places to go on a mobile device?
• Oppose an opponent. Find a competitor and do things
differently. Apple’s focus on creating beautiful software
was born from the need to oppose Microsoft’s more
feature-rich approach. Even their TV commercials
advised, “Think Different.”
30
• Embrace the impossible. Suspend disbelief and aim for
a goal that goes against reason and feasibility. Envision
how a problem can be solved using the power of design
fiction.

“The desire to reach for the stars is ambitious. The desire to reach
hearts is wise.”
—Maya Angelou, author and poet
The Problem
If it’s not interesting, teams won’t put in everything required
to see it succeed.
The Solution
Get your team members to identify with the cause so they
willingly invest their time and effort.
• Improve people. Use projects to help employees achieve
personal goals and beliefs. A classic Harvard study
entitled “Breakthrough in On-the-Job Training” proves
how training employees to become more capable while
delivering a project reduces time to market, increases
job satisfaction, and cuts training costs significantly.
32
• Show the path to success. Outline each milestone,
showing what team members need to do to get there.
Celebrate each achievement and remind them of what
still lies ahead and how much closer they are. Give them
a clear road map to guide them closer to the end, one
step at a time.
• Walk the talk.
33 Show them how much time or money
you are willing to put in personally to make the project
a success. I believe in ideas, so I am happy to put time
and money into projects I am passionate about. If you
do this, people will naturally want to get more involved.

“The main ingredient of stardom is the rest of the team.”
—John Wooden, basketball coach
The Problem
It’s hard to find people with the right skills to deliver what
you need.
The Solution
Pull together the best team you can. Work together to
improve quality, trust, and industry expertise.
• Look for volunteers. Find people who want to be
involved, are self-motivated, and are hungry to prove
themselves. For instance, Zappos pays employees to
quit, but not many do—it’s a great way to test and keep
only the staff members who genuinely want to stay.
34
• Give and take feedback. Trust team members to do
what’s necessary, but be aware of their responsibilities,
too. Challenge new teams to give constructive feedback
about each other’s roles until it is crystal-clear there are
no skill or procedural gaps. Set the right expectations
when you hire people, and make sure your entire team
is aware of what has been agreed upon to avoid any
confusion later on.
35
• Train as a team. Run team-building exercises to build
trust and foster a spirit of collaboration. These exercises
will help the team solve problems, better understand
each other, and agree how best to work more creatively
and efficiently.

“Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.”
—Aristotle, philosopher
The Problem
Project teams don’t know how to work well together.
The Solution
Openly discuss issues and goals before deciding what’s
needed to improve working relationships.
• Create a RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted,
and Informed) matrix to clearly show when each mem-
ber of the project team is expected to be responsible,
accountable, consulted, and informed at key stages in a
project’s life cycle.
36
• Form roles around interests and strengths. Find out
what motivates people, and let roles naturally evolve
over time to keep employees happy. Challenge any
ambiguity until it’s crystal-clear what people are
expected to do. Remove doubt and insecurity by reset-
ting expectations as soon as possible.
• Get psychological. The Myers-Briggs personality test is
an effective way of better understanding how team
members and stakeholders deal with different situations
based on their psychological makeup.
37 Find out what
yours is and share it with your team so you can start to
understand how to work better together.

“Drive thy business or it will drive thee.”
—Benjamin Franklin, US Founding Father
The Problem
Organizations aren’t clear enough about how they make
money.
The Solution
Clarify how value and costs are built up so teams know what
to do to keep the business running efficiently.
• Give an overview. Use a tool like the Business Model
Canvas to outline how your company plans to spend
money and generate revenue.
38 List your value proposi-
tion and show how each part of the business model
works to support success.
• Show customer success equals business success. Show
the link between important customer and business
requirements using a customer-value matrix.
39 Define
the customer value you’re creating and prioritize it
based on return on investment.
• Highlight what’s different. Many businesses can have
the same model but still be differentiated. An elevator
pitch is the quickest way to justify and clearly explain
what customer need you are satisfying and how it meets
business needs in a unique way.
40 Try writing a short
sentence to highlight a key value proposition that differ-
entiates you from competitors.

“The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that
it has taken place.”
—George Bernard Shaw, playwright, and cofounder of the
London School of Economics
The Problem
Teams end up solving the wrong problems because they
didn’t clarify what the problem was in the first place.
The Solution
Identify a problem and agree that it exists before going any
further.
• Back it up with data. Analyze usage data and market
research to highlight where problems actually exist.
Identify key metrics that need improving, and get the
business to agree on the most important ones.
• Gain empathy. Get stakeholders and investors to identify
with the problem as if it were their own.
41 Explain the
risks and the rewards and show how stakeholders can
personally get involved and reap the rewards. Let them
hear testimonials and watch usability-testing videos to
connect directly with customer needs.
• Make it obvious. Draw a direct correlation between the
solution you will provide and the complete removal of
the problem. Show how your business model cleverly
links together customer needs, market opportunities,
and trends.

The Problem
Customers don’t understand what companies do, so they

Make your value proposition obvious and easy to understand.
• Create an elevator pitch to sum up what you do.
43 Keep

Describe how your service meets this need in a unique
way that differentiates you from a major competitor.
• Map the competition. Plot your service and your com-

“Timing is everything. Nothing else matters.”
—Anonymous
The Problem
Organizations launch ideas and improvements too late or
too early.
The Solution
Conduct customer research and get enough support across
your organization to prioritize work more effectively.
• Embrace relevant trends. Analyze changes in customer
behavior and make a list of new trends that look like
they will continue to grow. Interview, run surveys, and
conduct focus groups to validate early assumptions and
help narrow down your choices.
• Confirm priorities. Align your work to meet the most
important business needs, and confirm they match
genuine customer needs, too. Keep a close watch on the
competition and what they are up to in similar areas to
create a better, more well-timed proposition.
• Create early prototypes to constantly validate ideas.
Improve and increase feature functionality and fidelity
over time. Build momentum through this continuous
learning and iterative improvement process until you
have enough experience backed up by customer valida-
tion and business buy-in to launch.

“If we worked on the assumption that what is accepted as true
really is true, then there would be little hope for advance.”
—Orville Wright, inventor and aviation pioneer
The Problem
Teams don’t test often or early enough, making it difficult
to fix problems later.
The Solution
Create experiences to test risky assumptions. Use what you
learn to create useful products.
• Do it quickly. Identify assumptions and test them
immediately. This may be a high-risk new idea or tech-
nology with many dependencies. I love going to hack
events like Startup Weekend because they demonstrate
how quickly business concepts can be created and
pitched—in most instances, in less than forty-eight
hours.
46
• Keep it simple. Interview and conduct usability studies
to get customer feedback early. Don’t overengineer
prototypes; create the lowest-fidelity prototype you need
to successfully get an idea across. I have created early
versions of ideas as a single web page, a video anima-
tion, and even a one-paragraph description.
47 Start small
and build from there.
• Improve quickly. Analyze results and gain just enough
insight to learn what to do next. Make changes immedi-
ately and allocate enough time to make improvements
and test again. Adopt a lean-startup mentality: build,
measure, and learn.

“Faith is taking the first step even when you don’t see the whole

The Problem
No one wants to work on game-changing ideas; they are
afraid to take unnecessary risks.

Commit your team to take on a big challenge. Prepare for
the journey that lies ahead.
• Stop making excuses.
49 Not ready yet? Need more
training? Too risky? Make do with the team, time, and
technology you can get. Treat the project as an experi-
ment and set out to prove what works. Gain insight
from both success and failure.
• Step forward. Let stakeholders know you are interested
in pushing the limits of what’s possible. Find like-
minded people who you trust can do the job and can
commit to see it through.

Teams aren’t ready when once-in-a-lifetime opportunities
come their way.
The Solution
Identify what you need to have in place to help you tackle
awesome opportunities that present themselves.
• Stay up-to-date. Remain abreast of the latest industry
happenings, new exciting technologies, and interesting
customer trends. Run competitor benchmarking to
identify crucial areas you can improve to remain com-
petitive. Strengthen your ideas and make them even
more useful. Analyze what’s going on so you can select
the best course of action.
• Team up. Conduct a heuristic review of your current
offerings. Hire in the skills to provide unbiased recom-
mendations you can act upon if you need to. I partner
with subject-matter experts to deliver innovative world-
class products.
52 There is no way I can gain their
knowledge overnight.
• Learn and improve quickly. Run customer research and
usability tests to ensure your ideas get feedback from
real customers. Validate your assumptions and remove,
improve, or add to a prioritized list of features. Continue
to improve and validate your ideas.

“An inconvenience is only an adventure wrongly considered; an
adventure is an inconvenience rightly considered.”
—Gilbert K. Chesterton, writer
The Problem
Teams don’t consider the environments in which their
solutions will be used, so they create the wrong solutions.
The Solution
Know where and how your ideas will be used so you can
design a better solution.
• Clarify the real goals. Find problems that need to be solved
by observing what customers do. Interview them, too, and
get them to prioritize what’s most important.
54 Get stake-
holders to do the same from a business perspective.
• Immerse yourself in the environment. Adapt your ideas
to make them more suitable based on where they need
to exist.
55 Let customers come to grips with your great
new product by testing it where it will actually be used.
• Keep checking. Constantly validate changes to your
product with customers to make sure the goals are still
being met. Build and iteratively improve your product
until it becomes really useful, matching customer needs
as well as business needs.

“Let us train our minds to desire what the situation demands.”
—Lucius Annaeus Seneca, philosopher
The Problem
Organizations come across as incompetent and insensitive
when they provide customers with incorrect, unwanted, and
untimely advice.
The Solution
Understand what customers feel under specific circum-
stances to deliver more-appropriate experiences.
57
• Ask them what they want. Understand a customer’s
frame of mind at the start of an interaction. Try using a
wizard interface to capture their feelings.
58 Show how
answering questions will reduce the options and get
them closer to their goal.
• Give them the right help when they need it. Start by
offering clear signposting and useful advice on each key
page. If customers continue to struggle, pop up a contex-
tual help page. If it really gets bad, let them chat directly
with a customer-service agent.
• Show what others feel. Incorporate peer validation.
Customers find it comforting to know what someone
else did to solve a problem in a situation similar to the
one they are in. This form of crowdsourcing is effective
when customers need peer input to make difficult
decisions.

“Power of generalizing gives men so much the superiority in
mistake over the dumb animals.”
—George Eliot, writer
The Problem
Companies hire subject-matter experts only to find out that
they aren’t good in the roles they need to play.
The Solution
Avoid the “halo effect,” which can bias your judgment of a
person’s capability based on your overall impression of the
person. Verify how competent people really are in the spe-
cific environments you expect them to perform in.
60
• Focus on strengths. Don’t give employees responsibili-
ties they’re not comfortable with. For instance, Yahoo!
hired Marissa Mayer as its CEO for what she was good
at, not what they wanted her to be good at.
61
• Deal with weaknesses. Use a RACI (Responsible,
Accountable, Consulted, and Informed) matrix that
maps out roles and responsibilities to identify missing
skills or skill gaps, then find team members or external
resources who can fill them.
62
• Create advocates. User-experience (UX) designers are
a minority in tech companies. An appreciation of design
best practices, together with some training, empowers
other team members to champion the need for good UX,
complete low-level design tasks, improve productivity,
and foster a sense of joint responsibility.

“I am certainly not one of those who need to be prodded. In fact,
if anything, I am the prod.”
—Winston Churchill, prime minister of the United Kingdom,
1940–1945 and 1951–1955
The Problem
Great ideas get diluted when there isn’t anyone to keep
things moving along.
The Solution
Place strong leaders and skilled people in your organization
to influence and guide teams to be more successful.
• Give context. Provide enough relevant background
information—including trend analysis, industry insight,
and customer behaviors—to inform design, technical,
and business decisions. You can use personas to help
teams justify what they are building, matching features
to real user needs and expectations.
64
• Show them. Introduce your team to techniques that can
better generate, prioritize, and shape ideas. Mentor
teams to complete tasks using the new techniques they
have learned to come up with relevant solutions.
65 The
best way to learn is through practice.
• Stoke the fire. Nudge team members along to come up
with interesting and creative solutions. Challenge origi-
nal stakeholders’ needs and surprise them with newer,
more-relevant ideas. Refer back to goals to check if they
have really been met. If not, get back on track quickly.
I love holding ice-breaker meetings at strategic points
of a project to get the creative juices flowing again.

“You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world,
but if they don’t play together, the club won’t be worth a dime.”
—Babe Ruth, baseball player
The Problem
Companies with the best teams in the world still fail to
deliver anything great.
The Solution
Learn to work better as a team by appreciating and support-
ing each other to achieve success in the best possible ways.
A team that plays well together performs well together.
• Be confident. The Pygmalion or Rosenthal effect proves
that the greater the expectation placed on a group of
individuals, the better they perform.
67 It’s helpful to
discuss what each team member wants to do, then sup-
port and convince him or her that it’s possible.
• Have goals. Be clear about what needs to be achieved
and keep your team informed. Hold regular review
sessions to go through new requirements and changes
based on feedback from usability testing. I find cross-
discipline pairing the best way to reduce confusion,
improve productivity, and lessen the need for unneces-
sary documentation.
68
• Be efficient. Leverage individual strengths and weak-
nesses by all means, but don’t forget softer skills, too. I
covet essential traits like collaboration, communication,
creativity, and flexibility,
69 without which a team can
not perform efficiently.

“As our enemies have found, we can reason like men, so now let
us show them we can fight like men also.”
—Thomas Jefferson, US Founding Father
The Problem
Teams don’t challenge each other and stakeholders, so they
end up delivering solutions that just don’t hit the mark.
The Solution
Get emotional and get frustrated. Show you care, and push
people on your team and within your organization to be the
best they can be.
• Ask for a slap in the face. Question what’s wrong, not
what’s right. Highlight mistakes and focus on the
learning gained through failure to explore new direc-
tions. Let your enemies teach you a lesson or two, and
keep them close—just make sure you get up and keep
going.
70
• Put your foot down. Give team members and stakehold-
ers constructive feedback and monitor the impact on
performance—for example, a reduction in errors.
71 Agile
development practices encourage conversations over
documentation; having regular retrospectives and daily
stand-ups gives everyone the opportunity to openly
discuss how the project and team are performing.
• Hire annoying people.
72 If you hire like-minded people,
everyone will agree on the same suggestions. Work with
people who like to challenge the status quo and who
are willing to fight for what they believe in. It doesn’t
matter if they rub you the wrong way as long as it
encourages healthy debate and diverse ideas.

“Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for
it.”
—Henry David Thoreau, author, poet, and philosopher
The Problem
People struggle when they do things they don’t enjoy.
The Solution
Get your team to buy in to their work and inspire them to
be the best they can be by playing to their strengths and
interests so they are superfocused and extremely satisfied
with all that they do.
73
• Become valuable.
74 We can’t always be in the perfect
job. But we can make it easier and more enjoyable. Try
to understand the background of every project you work
on, locating interesting information to stay motivated.
Show initiative and become the person people go to for
knowledge and clarification.
• Do what you love.
75 If you’ve tried to make the situation
better and had little success, look elsewhere. Find more-
interesting projects, work with a new team, and invest
your time and energy in a cause you truly believe in.
Do what you can to get more motivated, satisfied, and
financially better off.
• Align with a higher purpose.
76 Requirements and goals
may change, but keep your team focused on the overar-
ching vision. Empower teams to make changes based
on this vision, and get them to challenge themselves and
others to do what’s best to stay aligned with the vision.

“By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.”
—Benjamin Franklin, US Founding Father
The Problem
Team members fail to complete tasks because they don’t
know how to do them.
The Solution
Get teams the required training to perform well.
• Motivate them.
77 Understand what drives people, and
create incentives to attract their interest. You can ask
team members what they hope to get out of a project
and give them a choice of rewards that reflect their
needs. This shared agreement enables stakeholders and
teams to focus on delivering the right things for the right
reasons.
• Show them how. Empower employees to apply learning
to real-life situations. I mentor startups and technology
teams, giving them the theory behind a technique, then
work with them to apply the techniques practically and
successfully. Give them the skills and confidence to
apply techniques on their own, but know how to guide
without restricting them.
78
• Reveal the path. Give people a road map they can apply,
evolve, and adapt. Encourage team members to use the
knowledge they have, but also show them what success
is—what the next steps are and how many steps remain
—so they aren’t left wondering. Make it easy for them
to progress.

“The less effort, the faster and more powerful you will be.”
—Bruce Lee, martial artist
The Problem
Teams try to do too much at the same time, so they end up
delivering below-par results, leaving customers and investors
confused and disappointed.
The Solution
Help your team complete tasks as easily as possible by
finding the path of least resistance.
• Simplify decisions. Don’t make things harder than they
need to be. Refer to Occam’s razor as a heuristic to find
the fewest assumptions and risks needed to proceed
with your project.
79 If off-the-shelf software is just as
good, cheaper, and easier to integrate, use it instead of
building your own.
• Do less. Expending extra effort increases the likelihood
that you’ll be unable to complete a project. Promise less
to start with, and overdeliver. Add functionality once
you know it is needed. Do less to achieve more by
managing complexity.
80 Get rid of unnecessary function-
ality or processes.
• Give examples. Use relevant case studies to show your
team and other stakeholders how new ideas have been
successfully applied before. Refer to best practices they
can access, adopt, and use to justify decisions. Make it
as easy as possible for teams to understand, apply, and
discover what’s possible until they are capable and
motivated enough to continually apply the ideas
themselves.

“The most urgent decisions are rarely the most important ones.”
—Dwight D. Eisenhower, five-star general and 34th presi-
dent of the United States
The Problem
Companies make bad choices because they don’t know
what’s really important.
The Solution
Assign business success metrics and customer values to ideas
to see if they’re worth pursuing.
• Take a guess. Get your team to estimate the relative
effort to deliver each idea, and get stakeholders to verify
business success metrics. Use simple games like Plan-
ning Poker.
81
• Let ideas compete. Use a value graph to get an overview
of which ideas are best.
82 Put important business criteria
like “Return on Investment” (ROI) and “Effort” on the
x- and y-axes. Map ideas onto the graph and see which
ones offer the best ROI with the least effort. Don’t forget
to factor in dependencies and look out for high-effort,
high-ROI ideas that can lead to innovation. Decide which
ones make the most sense to work on first.
• Validate early. Get customer feedback by running focus
groups and usability-testing prototypes. Gain insight
and reassess what is of value before deciding your next
move. I encourage small, medium, and large enterprises
alike to adopt the lean-startup methodology of “build,
measure, learn” to help validate ideas.

“If the facts don’t fit the theory, change the facts.”
—Albert Einstein, theoretical physicist
The Problem
Companies waste time creating really complex features no
one wants. Changes later in delivery require extra time since
dependencies need to be considered.
The Solution
Avoid doing too much too soon; create a simple version you
can validate with real customers, early.
• Start small. Create a minimum viable product to see if
a concept works or an assumption is correct.
84 This can
be as simple as a link that pops up in a form to capture
feedback or a video to inform customers about what
your company is doing. Be careful not to confuse cus-
tomers or stakeholders who might think that is all they
are going to get, though.
• Do what’s necessary. My rule of thumb is to create fea-
tures that would render an idea useless if they were
removed. Progressively disclose functionality once core
pieces have proven to be useful.
85
• Test it quickly. Guerrilla-usability-test your minimum
viable product on real customers.
86 I’m quite happy to
test an idea with customers in a café and reward them
with cups of coffee. Give teams and stakeholders an
early indication of what works to help them decide what
to do next. Test breadth of functionality across the
holistic experience to spot the big problems, not just the
detailed ones.

“Don’t keep a man guessing too long—he’s sure to find the answer
somewhere else.”
—Mae West, actress
The Problem
In their eagerness to meet business goals, companies intro-
duce unnecessary restrictions and rules, making it hard to
get things done quickly.
The Solution
Make it easy to perform specific tasks, and give team mem-
bers enough freedom to do what is best.
• Show less. Reduce the number of options and make it
easy to compare the benefits, dependencies, and costs
of and differences between each so that a quicker, more
informed decision can be made. The $100 test, for
instance, is a simple way to justify and differentiate
between a small set of options.
87
• Use shortcuts. Use a story map to prioritize important
features.
88 This “must-have” set of features represents
the minimum viable product your team needs to build
to ensure main objectives are achieved holistically.
• Always have an answer. Solve customer and business
problems as best you can. If you can’t find an exact
match, highlight any shortfalls or differences, as well as
improvements your final solution provides. Upfront,
set expectations that you plan to do this, and don’t turn
away users unnecessarily.

“The ultimate inspiration is the deadline.”
—Nolan Bushnell, engineer, entrepreneur, and founder of
Atari
The Problem
Teams spend meeting after meeting discussing ideas without
making any decisions.
The Solution
Frame a lack of time as a challenge, and coach teams to do
just enough to proceed to the next stage. Get the adrenaline
and creative juices flowing.
• Set meaningful objectives.
89 Be clear what needs to be
achieved in the time you have. You can ask individual
team members to describe out loud what they think they
are supposed to be doing so there is no confusion.
• Have shorter meetings.
90 Achieve as much as possible
within the time allotted. Always try to wrap up a
meeting in less time than scheduled. Gather enough
information to make a decision, and agree on clear
acceptance criteria on all agenda items so people know
when they can consider a job done.
• Validate quickly. If you have time to ask only one per-
son, ask one person! If you need to make a decision, find
the easiest and most rewarding option to keep moving
forward. Web-usability expert Jakob Nielsen believes
you need to test with only five people.

“Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.”
—Confucius, teacher, politician, and philosopher
The Problem
Products and services get complicated when businesses keep
adding features to please too many people at the same time.
The Solution
Deliver maximum delight by doing the least possible while
meeting the most-important customer needs.
• Find out what really matters. Interview customers in
their workplaces and observe how they achieve tasks
naturally. Try conducting a contextual inquiry.
93 Keep
testing and making improvements to your ideas until
you have honed something that matches real user needs.
• Be more predictable. Reduce the time it takes to complete
tasks. Make features really intuitive so there’s little
doubt what they are meant to do.
94 Compare qualitative
as well as quantitative metrics to ensure both aspects
are improved.
95
• Get rid of it. Improve your solution’s usability by keep-
ing it light and focused. Remove anything that doesn’t
need to be there. Do less and focus on making your
solution more usable and useful.

“The art of being wise is knowing what to overlook.”
—William James, philosopher and first educator to offer a
psychology course in the United States
The Problem
Teams waste time building complex functionality people
hardly use.
The Solution
The 80/20 rule focuses on creating and improving the twenty
percent of features that customers use eighty percent of time,
and making those experiences more useful and brilliant.
98
• Get the basics right. Allow customers to achieve
important repeatable tasks easily. Validate and match
functionality and quality expectations. Add enhance-
ments and functionality if necessary.
• Remember to make experts happy, too. Don’t reveal
additional functionality unless customers need it.
Designers and developers can apply design heuristics
so access to advanced features is obvious and unclut-
tered. Don’t give people too many options at any one
time. Expert products need to be complex, though, so
your target users can control more of their desired
outcome.
• Evolve the most useful twenty percent. Observe what
customers do to see if they are using your products and
services in an unintended and productive way. Use this
insight to enhance existing functionality and create new
functionality, then make these changes more readily
available.

“Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but
when there is nothing left to take away.”
—Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, aristocrat, writer, poet, and
pioneering aviator
The Problem
Too much freedom of choice makes it more time-consuming
and difficult for teams to decide what to build and how.
The Solution
Limit your team’s access to resources and time. Do more
with less to start with so you have time and money left over
if you really need it later.
• Move it elsewhere. This concept is known as transposi-
tion. It involves moving established ideas and beliefs to
a new domain. Yandex, for instance, used Google’s
business strategy and is now the biggest search engine
in Russia.
99
• Specialize and evolve. Focus on making one part of your
idea the focus and the unique selling point. Invest your
team’s efforts in making that one part the best in the
industry. Create new products and services that are
higher-quality and more focused.
• Remove functionality.
100 Spot opportunities where others
only see oversimplification. Replace what you remove
with a really sticky factor like fun or kudos. Instagram
is a good example.
101 When you distill it, it is just
another photo app that allows you to add filters to pic-
tures—but everybody uses it.

“There are three responses to a piece of design—yes, no, and
WOW! Wow is the one to aim for.”
—Milton Glaser, graphic designer
The Problem
Customers use competitors because it isn’t clear what your
organization does.
The Solution
Focus on being great at one thing to start with.
• Quality first. Analyze competitor’s strengths and
weaknesses and find one thing you can be much better
at. An emphasis on quality allowed the Apple iPhone
to revolutionize the smartphone industry with a first-
class design and user experience that blew away the
competition.
102
• Be different. Be quirky, be mysterious, be surprising.
Let customers remember your brand. I love Innocent
Drinks and their unique take on healthy living mixed
with an infectiously fun brand.
103
• Combine strengths. Link products and services to show
how they complement each other. For example, I have
been using Adobe products since 1990. Adobe has the
best products, each powerful in its own right but even
more useful as part of a cohesive product suite.

“All progress has resulted from people who took unpopular
positions.”
—Adlai E. Stevenson II, US representative to the United
Nations
The Problem
Companies try too hard to be popular and end up diluting
their services to fit in.
The Solution
Please loyal customers by going over the top. Forget about
anyone else; your customers need to matter the most.
105
Those who aren’t customers will follow suit because they
can see the care and attention you are giving those who are
customers.
• Spoil them. Listen to what your most active and loyal
customers want, and keep them happy by delivering
experiences to meet their needs. Reward your advocates
so they continue spreading the good word.
106
• Show off. Make it obvious that you appreciate your
customers. Shower your advocates and superusers with
rewards and recognition. Let less-involved or newer
customers see how well you look after those who are
influential and loyal so they want to be those things too.
• Be extreme. Differentiate yourself from competitors as
much as possible. Do things they would never dream
of doing because they have too much to risk. Get known
for looking after the interests of your niche audience
and creating wild and wonderful experiences that only
your audience would care for.

“I didn’t fail the test, I just found 100 ways to do it wrong.”
—Benjamin Franklin, US Founding Father
The Problem
Many companies are still too risk-averse. They waste time
overanalyzing and making incremental changes that don’t
really make a difference.
The Solution
Treat your projects as a series of experiments, and learn from
each one. Discover valuable insights and overcome your
fears by remembering that disproving a hypothesis is not a
failure.
• Learn from failure.
108 When something does not work
as you expected, take it as an indication of what not to
do. Assess the implications and make relevant changes
to focus on what customers want instead.
• Provide more-frequent updates. Run more experiments
so stakeholders don’t invest too much in each result.
109
Get them accustomed to using insights to make decisions
more frequently.
• Recognize failure. Define tasks and metrics against
which you can measure success. A failed experiment is
one that doesn’t produce statistically significant results
for or against your hypothesis. Social-media return-on-
investment success can be easily measured based on a
brand’s share of audience voice, conversation effective-
ness, advocacy percentage, and likability compared to
competitors’.

“He who knows all the answers has not been asked all the
questions.”
—Confucius, teacher, politician, and philosopher
The Problem
Teams leave too many questions unanswered. If you don’t
know what you don’t know, trouble may arrive when you
least expect it.
The Solution
Quickly identify what you don’t know and get the answers
you need before you decide what to do next.
• Catch problems early. Keep a log of new and recurring
technological, environmental, social, and behavioral
factors. Identify the ones that represent the biggest risks,
and aim to understand their effects and deal with them
before they become genuine concerns.
• Be S.M.A.R.T.
111 Once you have highlighted areas you
need to address, set goals that are specific, measurable,
achievable, realistic, and timely so you know you have
been successful at solving them based on real metrics.
• Track holistically. Monitor changes in one area to make
sure there are no adverse affects on any other part of
the business or the project you are working on. In the
paid-advertising world you can set up automated alerts
to notify teams when there is a fluctuation in perfor-
mance.
112 This allows teams to react quickly to prevent
any further damage.

“You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it
today.”
—Abraham Lincoln, 16th president of the United States
The Problem
It takes only one mistake to rub people the wrong way so
they never trust you again.
The Solution
Show respect toward key people in your organization to
help you be more successful.
• Become a subject-matter expert.
113 Be prepared to back
up your opinions with proof. Research the topic at hand
and take note of important points you can leverage to
put forward your case more convincingly.
• Find a mentor.
114 Find someone who can help you navi-
gate through the political minefield—someone who has
been through the battles. As a mentor, I guide and pre-
pare people for situations they will come across. I offer
a second opinion and push them hard.
• Learn from experience. You will not win every argument
or debate. The most important thing is to gain experience
and be better prepared to fight another day. Always
push for a good conclusion (this may not always be
yours) as long as all parties have had input and a shared
consensus has been reached.

“The invariable mark of wisdom is to see the miraculous in the
common.”
—Ralph Waldo Emerson, essayist and poet
The Problem
Teams duplicate efforts because they’re not aware they’re
working on something that has been done before.
The Solution
Research what other teams and competitors have already
proved useful, and use that knowledge to inform decisions.
• Learn from past success. Find out why something
worked previously. Look for opportunities to abstract
or transform ideas from the past to help teams find
solutions to enhance and complete requirements more
quickly. Be careful not to copy an idea; always look to
evolve or improve one.
• Avoid repeating mistakes.
115 Try new approaches to
tackle problems while factoring in current customer
trends and new technology. Past failures can be due to
factors outside a team’s control, so stay abreast of market
conditions before deciding what to do.
• Take the best bits. Combine the best ideas and features
to create a better product.
116 Improve the effectiveness
of your experiences by uniting elements that comple-
ment each other. Be careful not to create a monster,
though—combining too many features will decrease
usability.

“We live in an age when unnecessary things are our only necessities.”
—Oscar Wilde, writer and poet
The Problem
Teams implement common solutions without context and
don’t solve the real problems.
The Solution
Find and improve the things that really matter.
• Get some help. Identify important problems you have
delayed attending to because your teams can’t deal with
them themselves. Find partners who can help you solve
these problems in a timely, professional, and cost-
effective way.
• Improve perceived value. Delight customers before and
after a task you want them to complete. For example,
give discounts or include free shipping for online pur-
chases. Make customers aware of how much they can
save so they feel good about completing their purchases.
• Step out of your comfort zone. Find inspiration in areas
you don’t normally look at. Improve one aspect of your
product or service, using new insight, and test how big
the impact is. Base changes on what customers would
find most valuable, even if it means going against what
you believe.

—Amos Bronson Alcott, teacher, writer, philosopher, and

The Problem
Project costs rise when there isn’t a clear project vision, scope,

The Solution
Agree on scope, delivery processes, and roles. Work closely
and inform each other of any changes so that there are no
unpleasant surprises.
• Understand everyone’s role. Create a RACI (Responsible,
Accountable, Consulted, and Informed) matrix to show
who’s needed at key project stages.
117 Keep this up-to-
date and share changes with the entire team.
• Confirm the scope.
118 Agree to keep track of an up-to-
date backlog. Make everyone aware of the consequence
of any decision before proceeding. Work closely as a
team to ensure conversations and decisions are captured
and made visible to all.

“If you don’t know what you want you will always attract the
wrong things in life.”
—Anonymous
The Problem
Teams miss opportunities in their eagerness to reach the
finish line.
The Solution
Let people know what you want, and make the benefits
obvious.
• Clarify what you need.
120 Be clear about the opportuni-
ties, roles, technology, and rewards for participation.
Show how a mutually beneficial relationship can be had,
and ask those interested to confirm their understanding
so expectations can be matched. Don’t assume you know
what everyone wants or that they know what they have
to do.
• Plan ahead. Don’t wait until it’s too late to secure the
money, equipment, and resources you need.
121 Make
the most of the opportunity when it arrives so you can
ask for more the next time.
• Put yourself out there. Approach innovative, ready-to-
be-engaged companies and people,
122 and present the
opportunity to get them involved. Go and get them in
case they don’t know who you are or what you need.
Ensure a shared understanding of the goals that need
to be achieved. Ask people to state them back to you in
person.

“If I asked people what they wanted, they would have asked for a
faster horse and carriage.”
—Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company
The Problem
Companies rely too much on what customers think they
want and not enough on what they will actually need. Cus-
tomers aren’t experts, so they will come up with limited and,
sometimes, unrealistic suggestions.
The Solution
Observe what customers do, and come up with new ways
to delight them.
• Observe customers. If you can’t do it in person, video-
record what they do and review it later. Get them to
think out loud and explain their thoughts each step of
the way.
123
• Benchmark results.
124 Test prototypes of your ideas to
capture relevant feedback. Create something tangible
customers can interact with and give them tasks to
complete, then assess their success based on time,
accuracy, and percentage of completion.
• Don’t lead. Tell them you don’t expect right or wrong
answers to avoid the subject-expectancy effect.
125 People
choose an expected result to remain in favor with the
tester. Encourage them to explore and make mistakes
naturally so you can identify what really works and
what doesn’t.

“Do not go where the path may lead; go instead where there is no
path and leave a trail.”
—Ralph Waldo Emerson, essayist and poet
The Problem
Teams find it difficult to apply the latest practices and tech-
niques that have been taught to them.
The Solution
Demonstrate a hands-on approach to show people what’s
possible through practice.
• Teach the theory. Attend and speak at events in your
area of expertise.
126 Network with industry peers and
get recognized for your points of view. People will want
to follow and know more about what you believe.
• Practice the theory. Run workshops and coach teams to
demonstrate how techniques and skills can be applied
to meet specific participant needs.
127 Make your sessions
practical, fun, and memorable. Include participants in
discussions and don’t make it a one-way lecture purely
on theory.
• Apply the theory. To prove a theory works, I find it
useful to have adopted and applied it myself. This lets
me feel more confident giving advice, where I can
accurately show personal examples of success and
failure, allowing others to learn from my firsthand
experience. An example of this is a startup I created to
validate the need for an artificial intelligence system to
link what people talk about on social networks to inter-
esting content they can watch, read, and buy.

“Whoever does not know how to hit the nail on the head should
be asked not to hit it at all.”
—Friedrich Nietzsche, philosopher, poet, composer, cultural
critic, and classical philologist
The Problem
Teams walk into meetings without relevant and timely
information to back up their decisions.
The Solution
Understand what stakeholders and customers expect, and
have the answers ready.
• Know what you don’t know. Build prototypes to test
assumptions and surface previously unknown risks. Get
answers to the questions, fill in knowledge gaps, and
remove any unnecessary distractions. Stay focused and
leave no stone unturned.
• Keep up-to-date. Do your homework to constantly assess
the relevancy of the latest customer trends and know
what competitors are up to so you can find opportunities
to improve your service as much as possible.
• Deliver what’s expected first. Get the basics right and
match original expectations, where it makes sense,
before anything else. New insights that can make a big
impact should be included too, but make sure you justify
their existence and show how you’ve prioritized these
accordingly.

• Make it personal.

early, and answer them with examples showing which
parts of your ideas are most relevant. Get them to iden-
tify what is useful.
• Keep it simple.
131 Keep presentations and demonstra-
tions short. Show that you understand the main
requirements, and summarize key points concisely and
accurately. Be genuine, not someone else, and link to
relevant cultural and business references to show that

“Great things are done by a series of small things brought together.”
—Vincent van Gogh, painter
The Problem
Teams don’t spend enough time making small improvements
that can deliver a lot of value.
The Solution
Group and prioritize small changes, especially if they can
provide as much impact as big ones but with less investment.
• Little change, big difference. Use data analytics to pin-
point where customers consistently fail in completing
business-critical tasks. Identify any small improvements
that can be made to get them into the next round of
change requests. I use the Kano model to uncover, clas-
sify, and integrate important customer needs, creating
delightful experiences that become essential through
time.
132
• Show customers you listen. Fix issues they complain
about the most. Acknowledge their input with an accu-
rate resolution and let customers rely on your team to
deliver results on time every time. The Firefox Input
Team does just this.
133
• The benefits all add up. A bunch of small improvements
in succession may be more effective than a single large
change. Assign relative effort sizes and fix issues that
require the least amount of effort for the biggest return
first.

—Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, architect
The Problem
Solutions are too complicated when customers have too
many choices, making it harder for them to decide.
The Solution
Give customers more control when they need it.
135 Keep
choices to a minimum to help customers make quicker
decisions.
• Conduct multivariate tests.
136 Design and test different
designs where the number of possible choices varies.
Compare the effectiveness of each design. Implement
the solution that causes the least confusion and allows
customers to achieve tasks in the shortest time possible.
• Start with the basics. Understand the customer’s hierar-
chy of needs, and design to progressively disclose
additional functionality.
137 Keep unnecessary features
hidden until they are required.
• Differentiate options. When designing interactions, fac-
tor in Fitt’s law, which states the time required to
rapidly move to a target area is a function of the distance
to the target and the size of the target.
138 Locate the most
useful options close together and increase the size of
important functions to indicate their relevance.

“Nothing is stronger than habit.”
—Publius Ovidius Naso (Ovid), poet
The Problem
Solutions end up being hard to use when customer expecta-
tions and design heuristics are not considered.
The Solution
Create experiences that are easily understood and comple-
ment customer expectations.
• Group functionality together. Make it easy to get to
content and features. Apply Fitt’s law, which states the
time required to rapidly move to a target area is a func-
tion of the distance to the target and the size of the
target. Place related functionality closer together.
139 Less-
important items should be further away or remain
hidden until required.
• Make it second nature. If it looks like it should work a
certain way, it should. Understand what customers are
used to, and create experiences that match expectations.
Smartphone touch gestures let consumers navigate,
interact, and entertain themselves naturally.
140
• Be forgiving. Customers are human, so they will make
mistakes. Design your features using a forgiving format
that expects a degree of error.
141 Give users a chance to
recover, often with some guidance, so they can proceed
to complete tasks.

“Even a soul submerged in sleep is hard at work and helps make
something of the world.”
—Heraclitus, philosopher
The Problem
Teams forced to come up with inspirational ideas while
having to consider risks and delivery pressures fail because
they can’t relax enough to let the creative juices flow.
The Solution
Step away from your desk and work environment. Inspira-
tion will come when you don’t focus too hard or too closely
on the problem.
• Stop when you lose interest. Get remotivated. Remove
barriers you are facing. Improve or learn a new skill.
Then return to the problem better prepared to tackle it.
Use BJ Fogg’s behavior model to help you simplify
problems you want to solve.
142
• Interrupt yourself. Take regular breaks. Unfinished tasks
remain in the subconscious part of your brain, which
keeps working away at the problem even when you
have consciously switched focus. This is known as the
Zeigarnik effect.
143
• Be happy. Use positive psychology and positive memory
recall to freely attract related experiences and creative
solutions. Events and emotions are linked, so relax to
recall useful insights and memories from the past to
help you solve your problems.

“Action is the foundational key to all success.”
—Pablo Picasso, artist
The Problem
Employees leave because companies don’t appreciate them.
The Solution
Recognize valuable contributions and reward employees
accordingly.
• Cultivate a fun, creative work environment. Allow
workers to enjoy themselves whenever they need a break
from work. I have used Nerf Blasters, game consoles
like the Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo Wii, and tradition-
al sports such as table tennis to keep teams motivated
through play.
145,146
• Highlight success. Recognize outstanding employee
contributions at award ceremonies or by mentioning
them at daily and weekly meetings. Mention names in
company newsletters and note details of good work in
more-formal employee performance reviews.
• Thank customers too. Loyalty is hard to come by, so
surprise those who have been customers for a while by
giving them discounts on services, early previews of
new releases, and real-world reward vouchers they can
spend on the things they enjoy the most.

“The will to win, the desire to succeed, the urge to reach your full
potential…these are the keys that will unlock the door to personal
excellence.”
—Confucius, teacher, politician, and philosopher
The Problem
It’s hard to earn people’s trust, but easy to lose it. If
employees don’t see the benefits of giving you their time
and energy, they won’t bother.
The Solution
Match personal team-member and stakeholder needs fully
and accurately.
• Show how it affects them. Don’t assume people want
the same things. Stakeholders have business metrics,
developers want to try new techniques, designers want
to win awards. The Wellbeing North Star innovation
game gets project teams to share important personal
requirements.
147
• Give face-to-face feedback. Make team feedback and
appraisals contextually relevant and actionable. Take
into account the employee’s perception of value. Make
feedback personal, timely, and comfortable.
148
• Let them track progress and help them solve specific
problems. The Adidas miCoach mobile app lets sports
coaches track their athletes’ performance. Learn from
this to track your team’s performance too.

“You can’t depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of
focus.”
—Mark Twain, author and humorist
The Problem
Teams take longer to complete projects because they waste
time working on things they didn’t have to.
The Solution
Get your team to focus on the most important tasks.
• Agree on goals. Constantly check and realign project
scope, roles, and responsibilities. Challenge unclear
assumptions and requirements before prioritizing any
work. Record changes so you can refer back to them at
a later date.
• Say no. Avoid scope creep by pushing back on new
requirements that make little sense. Only factor in rele-
vant insight that results in the delivery of a better
product. Don’t reprioritize, stop, or change anything
until you have validated the importance of an insight.
• Stay motivated.
150 Identify what each team member
needs to complete tasks efficiently. Work to support
each other, playing to individual strengths so everyone
stays interested in delivering great results for the dura-
tion of the project.

“However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at
the results.”
—Winston Churchill, prime minister of the United Kingdom,
1940–1945 and 1951–1955
The Problem
Teams develop ideas based on insufficient, incorrect, and
biased requirements.
The Solution
Accept truth revealed through customer validation and
usability testing.
• Validate assumptions. It is human nature to conjure up
an explanation to make sense of things, even when
there’s no proof. This is known as cognitive disso-
nance.
151 Find concrete evidence instead to avoid
heartache later.
• Stay open-minded. Don’t let your strong points of view
influence the truth. Be careful not to fall into the confir-
mation-bias trap.
152 Try to let the stats speak for
themselves instead, and interpret them without bias.
• Don’t lead. It’s tempting to want to help customers
during a usability test, for example, but this will taint
the results. Let them make mistakes and experience
things naturally without any external intervention to
avoid the observer-expectancy effect.
153 Observe, take
notes, and be prepared to take honest and insightful
feedback.

“If you always do what you always do, you will always get what
you always have.”
—Voltaire (François-Marie Arouet), French Enlightenment
writer, historian, and philosopher
The Problem
Stakeholder feedback can be damaging if the stakeholders
don’t have the right context to make useful suggestions.
The Solution
Involve stakeholders when it makes sense, and build up a
good business case before you finally show them what you
have come up with.
• Show how easily it fits. Show how your solution inte-
grates comfortably with current brand, marketing,
technology, and internal processes; make the adoption
of your ideas as pain-free as possible.
• Emphasize business value. There is nothing better than
showing stakeholders what they will get as a return on
investment. Highlight how new ideas have improved
the most-important business metrics so they have no
doubt about backing you.
• Wow them. Match ease of integration and clear business
benefits with a world-class user experience. Apple
product launches have this one-two-three punch.
154 Go
beyond expectations to really amaze stakeholders and
customers. Aim to win awards and the hearts of many
fans.

“Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything
that counts can be counted.”
—Albert Einstein, theoretical physicist
The Problem
Companies don’t monitor customer usage closely enough
to see what’s really going on.
The Solution
Analyze and interpret data as part of the design and build
process. Shed light on uncertainties, especially if you aren’t
sure why they really exist.
• Have assumptions to test. There is no point looking at
data if you do not know what you are looking for to
start with. List your biggest assumptions and measure
success by seeing if they have led to improvements to
key performance indicators or success metrics.
155
• Monitor changes over time. Don’t just take one random
look. Continue to monitor performance each time you
make an improvement, and track changes with groups
of users. This is known as batch and cohort analysis.
156
• Don’t make things up. There is no such thing as random
data—there is only data you have not interpreted yet.
Get to the bottom of any unusual behavior and don’t go
for the obvious, unfounded answer just because it’s
easier to accept. You’d be succumbing to the false-con-
sensus effect.

“Those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.”
—George Bernard Shaw, playwright, and cofounder of the
London School of Economics
The Problem
Companies take too long thinking about their next moves.
By the time a decision is made, solutions are out of date and
competitors have come up with something better.
The Solution
Speed up and be ready to make improvements based on
research and analysis.
• Timebox your market research and requirements-gath-
ering. Do just enough to get a feel for what customers
are trending toward. Pitch the results to stakeholders,
showing them the positive effect on the business, then
get them to agree on an appropriate course of action.
Prepare to make changes immediately.
• Start with a simple paper prototype and test early.
158
Once main ideas have proven to be successful, you can
quickly move to a more robust and realistic prototype
users can employ in the channel of their choice (mobile,
laptop, interactive TV) to test more in-depth experiences.
• Run rapid iterative tests (RITEs) and take insights from
each day to make important changes before testing again
a few days later.
159 Do this three to five times in succes-
sion until you have something vastly improved based
on real user feedback.

“Friendship is essentially a partnership.”
—Aristotle, philosopher and teacher of Alexander the Great
The Problem
Companies try to do everything themselves, so end up
wasting time and money producing substandard products.
The Solution
Work with people and teams to deliver your project and
create a superior product more cost-effectively.
• Identify your weaknesses. Get coworkers, stakeholders,
and the market to identify key areas and skills you need
to improve. Partnerships between IT solution-providers
and telecom agents are proving to be hugely successful
for both parties involved.
160
• Get the best. Source best-of-breed partners with proven
track records. List their pros and cons before selecting
one based on your prioritized needs. The Comcast and
Intel partnership helps Intel better market its products
and complements Comcast’s efforts at expanding
streaming services.
161
• Hire the competition. Find the right key players, even
if they are coming from a competitor. Don’t come across
as incapable, but be seen as focused and honest instead.
Electrolux hired Stefano Marzano from Royal Philips
Electronics to be the company’s new chief design officer.

“The beginning of knowledge is the discovery of something we do
not understand.”
—Frank Herbert, author
The Problem
Anger, impatience, and fear increase when teams don’t keep
customers and stakeholders up-to-date.
The Solution
Have useful information at hand to back up what you’re
doing.
• Establish a cadence. Send out a weekly report and
schedule review and showcase sessions.
163 Stress the
need to fully understand what has been discussed or is
required, and highlight the risks of people misinterpret-
ing announcements or missing meetings. Increase the
frequency of reports to force conversations between
stakeholders. Over-communication is OK.
• Show progress. Make it easy to see what has been
achieved, how much has been spent, and what is coming
next—use a Kanban wall chart.
164 Walk through key
decisions that have been made and what people can
expect next.
• Interpret data. Set up project dashboards and let inter-
ested parties generate their own performance reports.
165
Use graphs and infographics to make it easier to digest
important statistics. Include any bad news, as this is less
upsetting than getting bad news out of the blue.

“Meetings are indispensable when you don’t want to do anything.”
—John Kenneth Galbraith, economist
The Problem
People waste time going to meetings when they’re better off
doing productive work instead.
The Solution
Only attend meetings for clarification and to keep you
moving forward.
• Say no. Don’t think you can do everything and underes-
timate the time it takes to attend meetings. Decline ones
with no clear agenda or objective. Learn to turn people
away if something more important warrants your time.
Choose one thing to focus on at a time.
166
• Be busy. Book time in your calendar for yourself to
complete important work. Show yourself as out of office
and busy so no one can disturb you. Get meeting orga-
nizers to justify prioritizing their meeting over your
work. Challenge the agenda.
167 If it’s not important they
will reschedule.
• Demonstrate a better way.
168 Send a proxy. Make a
decision over email. Cut down meeting times and keep

“Everybody gets so much information all day long that they lose
their common sense.”
—Gertrude Stein, art collector and writer
The Problem
Companies spend too much time researching, leaving teams
little time to do the work.
The Solution
Do just enough to get going. Make decisions based on reality
rather than theory alone.
• Make a start. Come up with ideas that match business
needs together with stakeholders and your team. Do
enough research and competitor analysis, and put them
into a prioritized list of features using a discovery pro-
cess that can get you going quickly, leaving you more
time to make changes later.
169
• Test and learn.
170 Create the lowest-fidelity prototypes
you can get away with to validate those big assumptions.
Employ lean-user-experience methods to test assump-
tions and gauge success through experimentation.
171
Gain insight and improve your ideas iteratively.
• Keep it real-time. Analyze real-time interactions and
use the insight to make improvements so you can still
meet agreed-upon business success metrics. Use a tool
like Google Analytics to generate specific reports that
will help you analyze the data you have about your
online presence.

“My interest is in the future because I am going to spend the rest

—Charles Kettering, inventor
The Problem
Companies can’t differentiate themselves from competitors,
so they don’t leave a lasting impression with customers.
The Solution
Connect with customers in a memorable way your competi-
tors haven’t yet been able to.
• Fit in. Make your products and services emotionally
interesting.
173
Use
mood-driven
advertising,
give
passionate talks, and engage people through social net-
works. Customers want relationships with brands that
match their beliefs, but through their preferred channels.
• Be easy to remember. Focus your efforts in one area and
show how you are better than a competitor. Don’t do
too many things, as this will add confusion and make
customers remember you for the wrong reasons. Do less
to do more.
174

regularly. Track customer issues and feedback to decide
what to improve, and really wow them. Aim to remain
fresh and attractive to new and existing customers.

“There is a single light of science, and to brighten it anywhere is
to brighten it everywhere.”
—Isaac Asimov, author and professor of biochemistry
The Problem
Most companies do not understand how, when, and where
customers engage, which leads to experiences that are frag-
mented, unusable, and inconsistent.
The Solution
Make your products and services available to as many people
as possible without sacrificing quality.
• Comply. Understand and meet guideline recommenda-
tions to reach the maximum number of customers
possible. Organizations like the W3C define global
guidelines that companies like the BBC adapt to meet
their own online accessibility needs.
176,177
• Match expectations. Understand what situations and
environments customers experience the most when
engaging with your company or idea. Gain insight
through market research, customer interviews, focus
groups, and data analytics to spot and fix areas where
they struggle the most.
• Simplify and forgive. Put in extra time to test and
streamline the user interface and interactions across
multiple devices and customer touchpoints. Try incor-
porating a responsive web design—a great way to
ensure that experiences for different screen resolutions
and platforms automatically readjust based on one single
code base.

“Words without thoughts never to heaven go.”
—William Shakespeare, poet and playwright
The Problem
If a project doesn’t sound interesting, chances are the end
delivery will be a mediocre one.
The Solution
Get team members excited about the difference they can
make on a project and the rewards that will be gained when
it’s delivered.
• Let your team shine. Empower your team to come up
with ways to deliver something amazing. Show how
customers will benefit from parts of the project or service
they have worked on personally and how it is much
better than the competition.
• Meet both customer and business needs.
179 Leverage
relevant market opportunities, customer trends, and
usage analytics to gain the insight you need to justify
how new features and functionality meet customer
needs while producing a good return on investment.
• Help your marketing and sales team highlight the right
benefits when promoting your big idea, and give cus-
tomers, partners, and stakeholders an exciting story to
tell to their peers and bosses.
180 If you don’t, they will
only make it up themselves.

“No person is honored for what he receives. Instead, honor is the
reward for what they gave.”
—Calvin Coolidge, 30th president of the United States
The Problem
Keeping team members happy so they continue to perform
well is difficult even if your intentions are good.
The Solution
Understand your team’s motivations and capabilities.
Reward them for doing a good job with what really matters
to them.
• Create a rewards system. Agree on the rewards teams
can expect when they deliver the goods. This can be a
bonus, a team outing, or time off. Whatever it is, make
sure it is something they want. This matching of expec-
tations is known as positive reinforcement.
181
• Help them overcome barriers. BJ Fogg’s behavior model
identifies psychological barriers affecting a team’s per-
formance. Give your team the skills and training to
tackle tasks more effectively.
182
• Encourage healthy competition. Teams can use a
project’s dashboard to keep track of what the team has
achieved and how it has performed compared to other
teams. Encourage team members to discuss, share
knowledge, and reward each other (peer-to-peer
rewards). Zappos employees can give each other Zollars
for any action that they feel is deserving of recognition,
for example.

“Secret operations are essential in war; upon them the army relies
to make its every move.”
—Sun Tzu, military general, strategist, and philosopher
The Problem
Great ideas are diluted when shown too early to stakeholders
who want something more predictable.
The Solution
Keep your idea under wraps and continue to prove customer
and business value until your brave concept sees the light
of day.
• Find time. Get the time to work on something you feel
passionate about. Forward-thinking companies allow
employees to work on projects that they choose. Find a
project that interests both you and your company so
you get the right amount of time and support to see it
through.
• Don’t invite stakeholders. Involve them only to make
strategic decisions; give them little chance to interfere
with creative direction or technology questions except
at key review stages. Understand the business strategy
so you can factor that into design or technology solutions
you provide.
• Experiment and analyze. Create prototypes to test your
idea. Use key data metrics to prove your idea is the best
option. People will be willing to “unlearn” and adopt
new approaches and solutions if you back them up with
solid analytical results.

“Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see
is a perspective, not the truth.”
—Marcus Aurelius, Roman emperor and philosopher
The Problem
If it’s not clear what you stand for, people will find it hard
to differentiate you from what others have to offer.
The Solution
Take a stand about something customers and stakeholders
care about. Help them identify with your beliefs by proving
what you have is what they need.
• Spread your vision. Write statements and papers, give
talks and demos, speak to other thought leaders. Pro-
mote what you believe in all the time.
• Give examples. Gain people’s support by showing rele-
vant examples of how your beliefs have been applied
to address similar problems and needs. Use case studies
and personal experiences to show that what you are
talking about has worked before.
• Prove it works for them. Create a bespoke demonstration
and prototype, based on your beliefs, that solves a spe-
cific problem for them. Back it up with real customer
validation so there is no doubt it works.

“Always do right—this will gratify some and astonish the rest.”
—Mark Twain, author and humorist
The Problem
A bad experience lasts much longer than a good one, making
it very hard to regain customer trust when companies do
something wrong.
The Solution
Give customers more reasons to feel good about using your
products.
• Get the basics right. Understand customer expectations
and apply best practices to functionality that should
work as a given. This will persuade customers that you
know what you are doing and make them more comfort-
able engaging in more-complex requirements further
down the line.
• Look after customers. Don’t make them do more than
they need to achieve success or get a response. Reassure
customers and help them complete tasks and keep track
of any progress made. Make it easy for them to get
answers when they need them.
• Associate with good. Make parting with money more
acceptable by giving some of it to charity, awarding cash
back, or building up rewards customers can spend on
products and services they really care about.

“The truth is more important than the facts.”
—Frank Lloyd Wright, architect
The Problem
Teams rely on outdated processes and techniques to meet
new requirements, so they never fully address important
issues on time.
The Solution
Do a reality check and demonstrate better ways to achieve
success so you can update existing processes and finally get
things done.
• Challenge the status quo. Question the need to stick to
protocol by highlighting weaknesses in existing process-
es and tools. Identify and agree on the key objectives as
a team and a business to see if existing ways are still
effective.
• Find alternatives. Do your research and find up-to-date
alternatives. Get expert peer recommendations and refer
to industry advice, including best practices. Compare
the benefits of new and existing approaches. Show your
team and other relevant stakeholders how easy it will
be to make any changes.
• Reinforce any learning. Make it clear and easy to
remember key benefits compared to what exists today.
Use qualitative as well as quantitative facts and figures
to help you come across more convincingly, but be
careful not to overload your team with too much infor-
mation at once.

“Some men look at things the way they are and ask why. I dream
of things that are not and ask why not.”
—Robert Kennedy, United States senator
The Problem
Solving immediate problems stops companies from noticing
what people really care about.
The Solution
Understand what customers value most to improve experi-
ences they will actually appreciate.
• Appeal to multiple senses to reinforce your idea. Think
about modalities, location, intensity, and duration of
the stimulus, also known as multimodal integration.
184
Coffee shops use the smell of fresh coffee and the sound
of coffee being ground to intensify and extend the
experience.
• Don’t anchor solutions on what’s rational.
185 Psycholog-
ical decisions that are driven by spreadsheets and
return-on-investment feasibility tend not to be in the
interest of the customer.
• Be more creative. Tap into your emotional intelligence
to solve problems more effectively. Observe what people
do and feel to arrive at a solution that’s simple and hits
the mark.

“Small opportunities are often the beginning of great enterprises.”
—Demosthenes, politician
The Problem
Organizations launch substandard products because they
have hard deadlines to meet.
The Solution
Starting with a minimum viable product, continually fine-
tune your idea until it’s ready to be launched.
• Keep the fire burning.
187 Work on ideas you’re passion-
ate about and remember your vested interest in solving
the problem. Want to make a difference and stay
focused.
• React to changing market and customer trends.
188 Time
your launch to coincide with important shifts and events
that affect your product. Weigh the risks to see if your
idea will be strong enough if changes don’t work in your
favor.
• Go small. Don’t overpromise and underdeliver. Be ready
with an idea that is basic but hard to duplicate. Focus
all your energy on perfecting simplicity and matching
what your product does with important customer needs.

“You cannot push anyone up the ladder unless he is willing to
climb.”
—Andrew Carnegie, industrialist
The Problem
Companies focus their efforts on getting something launched
and don’t work with customers to evolve it into something
amazing.
The Solution
Leave enough time after launching an idea to market it,
leaning on social connectors, mavens, and salesmen to help
spread the word. Aim to reach what Malcolm Gladwell calls
the tipping point.
189
• Fill a gap. Conduct market research to see what exists
today. Decide how your idea can succeed where others
may have failed. Put together a business model and plan,
including costs, time scales, competitor analysis, and bene-
fits to sell your idea to stakeholders convincingly.
• Be passionate but flexible. Enthuse team members and
stakeholders, but also set realistic expectations and
highlight risks. Show you are prepared to do whatever
it takes to test the idea in the market, but be prepared
to adapt based on available time, technology, resources,
and business priorities.
• Keep moving forward. Respond to customer feedback
and observed behaviors by creating missing functional-
ity, improving existing functionality, and removing any
obstacles. Track every improvement to check that
nothing breaks and that the holistic customer journey
is still optimized.

“To affect the quality of the day, that is the highest of arts.”
—Henry David Thoreau, author, poet, and philosopher
The Problem
Companies that don’t appreciate good design produce
products and services that people won’t cherish.
The Solution
Focus on delivering a quality experience where design is
factored in throughout the product-development process.
• First impressions count, so make them good. Apple has
a dedicated person who opens its product boxes behind
the scenes to ensure the first-time out-of-the-box cus-
tomer experience is brilliant.
190 Customers are thanked
with a wonderful unveiling that oozes care and quality
even before they’ve turned on the device they have
purchased.
• Make it usable. The Xerox Star was the first graphical
user interface (GUI),
191 but not until Apple got its hands
on the GUI to improve the customer experience did it
became something personal-computer users could
actually use.
• Check that it works everywhere. Design your product
to work on any device.
192 Factor in cross-browser testing
and implement a responsive design framework so your
service can work on multiple devices, including web,
mobile, and interactive TV.

“Every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits
of the world.”
—Arthur Schopenhauer, philosopher
The Problem
Companies don’t factor in trends outside of their core focus
that could make them more successful.
The Solution
Understand wider market and customer trends to leverage
interesting insight.
• Know what’s hot. Subscribe to a trend-spotting service
(for example, Trend Watching), review popular technol-
ogy blogs (for example, Mashable), and absorb industry
news (from sites such as TechCrunch) to gain insight
and identify trends that may fit with your company’s
vision and values.
193,194,195
• Try something new. Experiment with new technologies,
processes, and ideas that can improve what you deliver
and how you deliver. Get feedback from early adopters
and run development spikes to help you decide how to
spend your time and money.
196,197
• Network with experts. Attend industry events, talk to
peers, and partner up with anyone who can help your
team do a better job. Lanyrd is a useful tool for identify-

“Start by doing what’s necessary; then do what’s possible; and
suddenly you are doing the impossible.”
—Francis of Assisi, Catholic friar and preacher
The Problem
Teams and businesses give up when an idea gets too hard
to handle.
The Solution
Work on that idea people say can’t be done. It could just be
because no one’s found a way yet.
• Analyze failed attempts. Interview customers and
stakeholders to find out why something didn’t work.
Next, assess current market conditions for new or
renewed interest before formulating an approach to give
it another go. The early days of Yahoo!’s attempt to
become the largest social network taught Facebook to
avoid the mistakes of failing to grow and to maintain a
large online community.
199
• Get them to love it. Enthuse your team by showing them
the benefits of completing a project no one thinks is
possible. Hire people who are hungry and capable—peo-
ple who share your passion.
200
• Start simple. Do whatever it takes to prove that the
experience is what customers want.
201 Get people to
understand the benefits and incrementally build on each
successful and failed validation. Put your idea in front
of customers and show stakeholders the progress your
team is making.

“I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past.”
—Thomas Jefferson, US Founding Father
The Problem
Companies and teams aren’t good at making radical changes
to their own products even when they know what is possible
and what should be done.
The Solution
Find a way to look further afield; identify and execute
opportunities no one else can see. If you reach for the moon
and fall short, you will still achieve something amazing.
• Create a vision of the future. Microsoft creates and films
proof-of-concept Future Vision videos to show the world
what the company plans to achieve in the next ten to
fifteen years.
202 Aim high to define the outer limits of
what the world can have, then create a strategy to
articulate this vision.
• Plan for the future. Differentiate between long-term,
secular trends like cloud computing, and cyclical trends
like social networks, which need to be factored in today
for more personalized products and services. Secular
growth reflects an expansion of a market that happens
once in a lifetime.
203 If you gain some unique insight into
the future, grab it with both hands and be ready to do
something about it as soon as possible.
• Separate innovation. There is a difference between dis-
ruptive and continuous innovation. Set aside time to
work on new game-changing ideas, separate from
making improvements to existing functionality. Red
Gate Software has a Down Tools Week every three
months, when employees set aside their day-to-day
tasks and work on their own projects.

“The reasonable man adapts himself to the world. The unreasonable
man adapts the world to himself. All progress depends on the
unreasonable man.”
—George Bernard Shaw, playwright, and cofounder of the
London School of Economics
The Problem
Companies don’t offer enough value to customers, so they
achieve little growth.
The Solution
Push the limits. Believe you can change the world and set
out to do it.
• Be ignorant. Too much knowledge makes teams and
businesses play it too safe. Under certain conditions
newcomers can produce innovation in areas they are
exposed to. Use your ignorance of a particular subject
or industry to come up with ideas; apply the “newcomer
effect” to your advantage.
205
• Make a fool of yourself. It may not make much sense
yet, but if your research proves there’s an opportunity,
give it a go. Don’t worry if people laugh, criticize, or
put you down. Steve Jobs’s address to Stanford Univer-
sity students encouraging them to “Stay hungry, stay
foolish” sums it all up.
206 Don’t let opportunities to
change the world pass you by.
• Reach for the skies. Go above and beyond to create
experiences that wow customers and make stakeholders
want to invest more time and money with you.

“We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as

The Problem
Companies don’t listen to what the majority of customers
say or want, so they end up delivering experiences that don’t
really matter.
The Solution
Let customers define what’s right. Act on inputs that make
the most sense, and recognize the hard work being done for
you.
• Allow collaboration. Wikipedia lets knowledge experts
create, input, and evolve encyclopedia definitions. This
interactive evolutionary computation, working as a team
of global experts, ensures a high level of quality and
relevancy.

“The man who promises everything is sure to fulfill nothing.”
—Carl Jung, psychotherapist and psychiatrist who founded

The Problem
Companies who try to please everyone end up with solutions
that don’t do anything well.
The Solution
Focus on improving the quality, accuracy, and usability of
fewer features to keep customers happy and help your
organization remain competitive.
• Identify what’s important. Assess customer, business,
and competitor impact. Don’t forget to factor in any
crucial dependencies. Agree on a core set of features
with your team and stakeholders. This will become your
minimum viable product.
212
• Partner up.
213 Identify features that are important but
not within your delivery capabilities. Find an internal
or external resource who has the skills you require, and
work closely with that resource to deliver these features.
• Confirm relevancy. See if your original assumptions still
hold true. Factor in up-to-date market changes and adapt
your road map accordingly to incorporate new useful
insight.

—Henry Ford, founder of the Ford Motor Company
The Problem
Companies and teams aren’t compelled to innovate when
they don’t need to. They don’t take risks for fear of rocking
the boat.
The Solution
Believe you can do it. Innovative ideas come about when
teams take a chance and are committed to never give up
until their idea becomes a reality.
• Stop making excuses. When you really want something,
you will find a way—using any means necessary. Pull
in favors, stop getting distracted; keep moving and get
closer to realizing your dreams.
• Adopt early.
214 Try new, unproven technology and
approaches if they will help you realize ideas more
easily. Do just enough research to get a prototype into
the market, and keep evolving it until it becomes
something wonderful.
• Make it personal. Invest your own blood, sweat, and
tears to show how much you believe in an idea.
215 Others
will notice this commitment and want to help you
succeed.

“It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.”
—Frederick Douglass, social reformer
The Problem
People have lost their ability to wonder, and don’t allow
failure to teach them valuable lessons.
The Solution
Recapture all that was positive, amazing, and fun as a
child.
216 Regress and find new ways to achieve what you
want without putting up unnecessary barriers.
• Be a superhero. Remember pretending to be Captain
Spock or Luke Skywalker?
217 Role-play situations to
come up with cool ideas and make them a reality.
Become who you’ve always wanted to be.
• Be a know-it-all. Keep learning like a child. Children’s
brains are like sponges; they never stop learning. Give
yourself the ammunition to counterargue and build
strong business cases for your latest ideas. Children can
be annoying, but only because they know more than
adults.
218
• Know what you want. Be ready to adopt new beliefs
based on relevant evidence—whatever makes the most
sense. Stay up-to-date with the latest trends. Children
are always trying to understand each other and the
world around them. “Babies and young children are
like the R and D division of the human species,” says
psychologist Alison Gopnik.

“Perhaps the world’s second worst crime is boredom. The first is
being a bore.”
—Jean Baudrillard, sociologist and philosopher
The Problem
Companies go bust when they rest on their laurels and think
they can drag out the existence of a substandard product.
The Solution
Raise the quality bar within your team and commit to con-
tinually raising it.
• Have thin skin. Be allergic to poor design execution.
Refer back to your missions, objectives, and design
principles.
220 Link quality to measurable metrics to track
each successive improvement. Keep improving what
isn’t good enough.
• Give a damn. If it shows that you’ve spent time perfect-
ing your product, people will choose you over a
competitor. Perfectionism plays a crucial role in Apple’s
success. Apple products feel like blood, sweat, and tears
have been spilt making them so beautiful.
221 Focus on
the details.
• Let your mind wander. Be constantly on the lookout for
a better way of doing things. Successful customer brand
loyalty is based on the ability to continually delight.
222
Make sure to deliver incredible experiences across
important delivery channels at every opportunity.

“Only the wisest and stupidest of men never change.”
—Confucius, teacher, politician, and philosopher
The Problem
Companies apply the same fixed set of methods to different
problems and pray for a good result.
The Solution
Approach each new idea with fresh eyes and avoid the
pitfalls of economies of scale.
223 Explore better and more-
appropriate ways to create what you need in a way that
works.
• Avoid the scaling fallacy.
224 Verify load assumptions by
testing and putting in place appropriate safety factors.
Minimize incorrect scaling assumptions by carefully
researching similar designs and monitoring how your
idea performs post-implementation.
• Put them in the wild. Test subject-matter experts on real
projects to assess how well they perform. Never assume
that just because they’re great in one situation they’ll be
great in an unrelated one. This unproven-expectation
effect, known as the halo effect,
225 needs to be tested as
quickly as possible.
• Change with the times. Try new technology and incor-
porate the latest market and customer trends. Don’t be
complacent and foolish, thinking you can keep doing
what you are doing and continue to be successful. Learn
from expert conferences, user groups, and online discus-
sions, and take part in trials to stay ahead of the curve.

“There is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to
conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in
the introduction of a new order of things.”
—Niccolo Machiavelli, historian and politician
The Problem
Out-of-date points of view, processes, and rules can’t be
used to solve current or future business needs.
The Solution
Highlight benefits of any new approach and help people
adopt them as easily as possible.
• Question the status quo.
226 Challenge anything that no
longer makes sense to remain the same. Use up-to-date
business needs to suggest better, more-rewarding solu-
tions.
• Prove it works.
227 Give examples of where a new
approach has been successfully implemented by other
teams and companies. Show how your team can create
their own success stories.
• Make change easy.
228 Provide support to make changes
as painless as possible. Organize training, refer to self-
help tutorials, and have experts answer questions. Show
how a small investment up-front will yield large returns
in the near future.

“We do not learn; and what we call learning is only a process of
recollection.”
—Plato, mathematician and philosopher
The Problem
Companies shoehorn in processes that are out of date, out
of context, and out of touch with reality.
The Solution
Create processes that match important criteria and conditions
to improve workflow and maximize team efficiency.
• Evaluate existing processes. Look at the end goal and assess
whether existing processes can achieve it efficiently.
Highlight any failures, implement changes, and test the
improved process on a small project. Fine-tune it until it
represents a vast improvement over its predecessor.
• Adapt and combine. Often individual processes have
feature duplication or unoptimized subprocesses. Take
existing processes, remove any redundancy, identify
the best parts of each, and combine them to create a
streamlined one. For example, the evolution of the M25
Orbital Road in
London, England, circumvented
unnecessary routes to create fewer simpler ones.
229
• Start from scratch. Create something that has never been
done before to help you achieve your goals. The agile
manifesto and lean-startup methodology are two disrup-
tive examples of processes enabling organizations and
teams to reduce documentation and wasteful develop-
ment time.

“Anything you’re good at contributes to happiness.”
—Bertrand Russell, philosopher, mathematician, and historian
The Problem
Unhappy people will be uncreative and unwilling to do
anything useful.
The Solution
Get your team members to enjoy what they do. Martin
Seligman, positive psychologist,
232 believes the happier we
are the more successful we are.
• Reward your team with worldly pleasures. The pleasant
life is the most visible measurement of happiness. Thank
them by giving them bonuses, salary increases, time off,
or a party. Although the shallowest of all types of hap-
piness, the pleasant life is still sought after for its instant
gratification.
• Help them maximize their potential to grow profession-
ally. Enable individual team members to become subject-
matter experts. Mentor, train, and expose them to
opportunities to help them grow naturally to become
recognized leaders in a field of expertise.
• Promote selflessness and living a meaningful life.
233
Encourage employees to help those in need by finding
personal or client projects that improve the greater
good—for example, charity work or speaking at educa-
tional institutions.

“The only real failure in life is not to be true to the best one knows.”
—Buddha, founder of the Buddhist religion
The Problem
It’s hard to promote a product or service if there’s little prior
proof of success.
The Solution
Prove you’ve been through battles and lived to tell the tales.
People want to work with people who can achieve success
for them easily and professionally.
• Teach. Explain how it all works. Use case studies and
live demos, and reveal those amazing stories of success
and failure. Make your presentations, workshops, and
training sessions interesting, faultless, and professional
so there’s no doubt you know what you are talking
about.
• Mentor. Help others better understand the theory by
running workshops and training sessions. Take those
interested through the process of creation, putting into
practice what you have taught them. Let them experi-
ence, firsthand, what they have only ever heard or read
about before.
• Be reliable. Reduce uncertainty and undesired conse-
quences by defining solutions and advice that have been
proven to work in similar situations. Do this time and
time again. Soon they will realize the positive conse-
quences of your involvement.

“The most interesting information comes from children, for they
tell all they know and then stop.”
—Mark Twain, author and humorist
The Problem
Companies don’t stop projects that fail until too much time
and effort has already been invested.
The Solution
Decide if implementing further improvements will make a
difference. Assess the current situation and refocus your
efforts on what’s still relevant.
• Check that assumptions still hold true.
234 Set up regular
stakeholder meetings to confirm that business needs are
still the same. Refer to real customer data to support
decisions. Improve assumptions that hold true, evolve
ones that have potential, and stop those that prove false.
• Measure success.
235 For example, measure the increase
in conversion rate and reduction in query resolution
time. Monitor these metrics and stop the project if there
is a prolonged downward trend, and find a better way
to achieve success.
• Give it some time. Work in small batches to avoid the
sunk-cost fallacy.
236 Don’t pull the plug until you have
done the minimum to market your product and attract
your target customers. Remember that the innovation
adoption curve has innovators and early adopters con-
verting before the majority.
237 Focus on the majority, as
that’s where you want to attract loyal customers.

“Inspiration is a guest that does not willingly visit the lazy.”
—Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, composer
The Problem
Success lulls companies into a false sense of security, and
teams become slow to react when they aren’t actively being
engaged.
The Solution
Allocate time to improve your skills and fine-tune your
intuition.
• Get a mentor. Find someone to coach you and push you
to your limits; improve existing skills, learn new ones,
and become stronger as a team. Storify, for example,
hired Don Loeb as its new business manager to retrain
and inject startup success methodologies into its sales
division.
238
• Do your homework. Research relevant up-to-date mar-
ket trends and attend talks and workshops about the
hottest topics. Before you decide what to focus on, work
with a trend-spotting company such as trendwatch-
ing.com to know how consumers are looking to spend
their time and money.
239
• Take risks while you can. Allocate time off projects to
experiment with new approaches, software, and partner-
ships. Don’t be afraid to fail; now is the time to figure
out what is worth pursuing. Companies like Google
allow up to twenty percent of work time to tinker and
play.

“Death is the only pure, beautiful conclusion of a great passion.”
—David Herbert Lawrence, novelist, poet, and playwright
The Problem
Overconfident companies who put all their eggs in one
basket lose everything when expectations aren’t met.
The Solution
Monitor ideas over time to see if they remain relevant.
• Dig deeper. Uncover the whole story. Investigate
inconsistencies and unanswered questions. There may
be less-obvious reasons why things aren’t working. Use
interesting insights to provide a better service than what
exists today. Airbnb disrupted the hotel industry by
allowing travelers to find cheaper accommodations
hosted by local residents in their own homes.
241 Just
because it’s cheaper, that doesn’t mean it’s bad.
• Push past early adoption.
242 Don’t assume early success
via innovators and early adopters is an indicator of
continued success. Keep raising awareness using a cus-
tomer-growth plan to attract customers to your service.
243
Once they’re there, maintain their interest by helping
them make full use of features.
• Pivot. Validate ideas with customers to see if you’re still
heading in the right direction. Keep abreast of changing
market conditions and trends. Monitor customer
behavior to stay up-to-date with changing needs. Try
to adapt ideas to reach more customers. Groupon started
as an online activism platform before changing to end
up as the biggest coupon promotion site in the world.

“Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to
continue that counts.”
—Winston Churchill, prime minister of the United Kingdom,
1940–1945 and 1951–1955
The Problem
Companies walk away and start new projects without allo-
cating the resources needed to support ideas after they go
live.
The Solution
Support projects once they are out in the real world so they
can realize their full potential.
• Create a support plan. Factor in costs for ongoing
maintenance. List resources and tasks required for rou-
tine support and improvements based on usability
testing and monitoring of data analytics.
• See it as the start of a race. Now that a project is live, set
your sights on the next phase of the project. Agile
development and the lean-startup methodology focus
on delivering a minimum viable product,
245 giving you
money and time left over to spend on iterative
improvements. Use this time and money wisely.
• Monitor performance. Keep track of progress using click-
track analysis and other data-analysis methods. Follow
best practices to set up a dashboard,
246 giving up-to-date
statistics of key metrics. Attend to any underperforming
areas.

"If you aren’t fired with enthusiasm, you will be fired with
enthusiasm.”
—Vince Lombardi, American football coach
The Problem
Teams who fear making mistakes will never try anything
different to change the world.
The Solution
Stand up for something you believe in, and back it up by
taking risks that show your conviction. Become an innova-
tion subversive.
247
• Prove it works first. Set up a crack team to create a proof
of concept that demonstrates your way is a better way.
This puts you in a far more powerful position than
before, when your ideas were just opinions. If you decide
to quit, at least you will have left on a high note.
• Change the scenery. See if you can move into a more
interesting role,
248 even if it doesn’t exist yet. Come up
with a business proposition that covers all the benefits,
and pitch it to your boss and potential new boss. Get a
mentor to advise you. If it will make you happier and
the business gains something valuable, it should be a
win-win situation.
• Start your own company. If you’re ready, quit and let
those who can support your new venture know what
you plan to do so you can hit the ground running.
Understand the consequences of your decision, though,
so you don’t go into it blindly.
249 With the right expecta-
tions, preparation, expertise, and clients, there’s no
reason you can’t be successful.

“First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight
you, then you win.”
—Mahatma Gandhi, the preeminent leader of Indian
nationalism in British-ruled India
The Problem
Businesses give up too early and stop teams from delivering
what’s possible because they don’t know how to learn from
failure to keep going.
The Solution
Learn from mistakes, assess the damage, and see if it makes
sense to have one last go.
• Admit mistakes. Learn from the past to move on. Make
a public apology and clearly outline how you will
address any wrongdoings to regain the trust of your
customers and stakeholders. Brands can’t be perfect all
the time, so hearing a leader admit a mistake and want
to make amends makes people feel more at ease and
believe things will improve in time.
250 Be human by
showing genuine empathy, generosity, and humility to
get a second chance.
• Get back to basics. Remember what you are good at and
stop pretending to be anything else. Focus on what you
can deliver well. See if you can improve the quality of
experiences with a smaller set of quality features. Be the
best you can at fewer things. Remember, Google’s search
engine is just a search box,
251 albeit a very powerful,
forgiving, and useful one.
• Help them change. Show customers how easy it is to
switch over from a competitor. Sky TV does this by
clearly highlighting the benefits compared to competi-
tors and having a dedicated Switching Squad that talks
to existing providers for you.

“Make a habit of two things: to help; or at least to do no harm.”
—Hippocrates, physician and one of the most outstanding
figures in the history of medicine
The Problem
Teams don’t put in extra effort to make their products really
special, so customers look elsewhere for their fix.
The Solution
Give customers something they can’t get enough of. Make
them long for your product experience.
• Make it enjoyable. Give customers a good reason to use
your product instead of a competitor’s. Provide a useful
tool, make it supereasy to use, help them learn an
important skill, and reward them for their time. Kiip,
for example, is a mobile app that rewards users with
relevant vouchers for achieving new levels in a game
they are playing.
253
• Provide sustenance. Help customers reach and hold on
to a desired emotion. Design experiences that satisfy
them and keep them coming back for more when they
need it. For instance, Flipboard aggregates up-to-date
technology, lifestyle, and design news from the most
popular websites, saving users the time and effort of
finding that news from the individual sources.
254
• Give them more. Let customers discover new and
interesting content each time they come back. Spotify is
a good example; the music service lets users enjoy music
their friends are listening to at that moment in time, as
well as build personal playlists and get related artist
recommendations for free each time they come back.

put up walls to stop customers from getting too close. But
when they fail, customers don’t hesitate to leave.
The Solution
• Admit mistakes.
256 It’s far better to come clean than to
have people hear about it from another source. Outline
what happened, show you will make amends, and put
measures in place to stop it from happening again. Use
popular social-media sites like Facebook and Twitter,
as well as industry blogs, to formally apologize. Don’t
be shy.
• Be transparent.
257 Once you have admitted a mistake,
follow up a promise to make improvements with an
easy way to notify customers of progress. Allows users
to sign up and receive alerts, discuss topics of interest
on forums, and even go as far as rewarding customers
for their patience with a gesture of goodwill—for
example, a discount on their current service.
• Work with customers to get it right. Incorporate human
evaluation to improve your service offering.
258 Don’t
second-guess what they want, but instead find ways to
incorporate implicit and explicit feedback to better
define, teach, and tailor experiences around specific
personal preferences. This form of crowdsourcing will
make your services more human, social, and useful.

“To do good is noble. To tell others to do good is even nobler and
much less trouble.”
—Mark Twain, author and humorist
The Problem
Teams don’t share their experience or knowledge, making
it difficult to reuse the good work done elsewhere internally.
The Solution
Foster an environment of trust and creativity, where ideas
can flow and be shared among teams and departments.
• Share knowledge. Show other team members what you
have learned, and they will reciprocate. Help others
learn new skills, discuss insights, and apply lessons
learned. Foster a willingness to help, try ideas, and be
less averse to new, risky opportunities. Make your needs
known so others understand how best to help when you
need it most.
• Make it free.
259 Decide who and what you can give time
to for free. This attitude of selfless giving allows teams
to donate their expertise freely without any hidden
agendas, helping not-for-profit organizations and char-
ities and knowing it is for a good cause.
• Open-source it. The beauty of code that has unlimited
expert support means you can develop experiences and
connect to other devices to create truly ubiquitous
ecosystems, where everyone has a shared interest in
making it work. There really is no limit.

“Know your enemy and know yourself and you can fight a hundred
battles without disaster.”
—Sun Tzu, military general, strategist, and philosopher
The Problem
Companies spend time preparing for disaster but don’t deal
with it well when it arrives.
The Solution
Have a plan of action, but more importantly, be ready to
react and solve the right problems in the appropriate manner.
• Have a backup plan. Build in safety features and spend
money according to the level of disaster likely to occur.
Identify and monitor the weakest links. Thinking you
can prevent the biggest threats is often referred to as a
black-swan event.
261 You can’t prevent all disasters,
because you won’t know what some of them are, usually
because they have never happened before. The newer
the concept, the larger the factors of safety you need.
262
• Be ready for action. There’s a misconception that the
more prepared you are, the safer you will be. The best
you can do is to allocate resources to correctly identify
and solve problems quickly. Start with a small team,
but scale up quickly if required.
• Ask for forgiveness.
263 When things go wrong, be hum-
ble and apologize as soon as possible. Say you’re sorry
publicly if the mistake affected many of your customers.
It’s better for people to hear about what went wrong
from you than from competitors or other customers.

pened behind the scenes if that information isn’t part of the public
record. The examples are purely representative and I have not worked

quickly to important changes in the market based on what
customers really wanted and what was best for Amazon as
a business. Avoid building a “private empire” and underes-
timating the role of chance, leaving your company at the
mercy of uncontrollable circumstances. Factor in surprising
insights and react to unforeseen circumstances early to
become more successful in the long run.
2. Find the Gaps
Identify what you don’t know. Leaders who think they have
all the answers don’t look for further validation, so end up
leading their teams down the wrong path. Dynamic leaders,
like Bezos, can confidently make crucial business decisions
and deal with crises because they are open enough to trust
the knowledge of others to keep them informed. Don’t make
decisions until you have all the critical facts in hand and
have answered important questions and validated key
assumptions.
3. Build an A-Team
Hire people you trust can deliver awesome solutions. Work
with people who strive to make a real difference and are
willing to prove their worth every second of the day. Ama-
zon employees are known as "customer experience bar
raisers" and are passionate about tracking and making
appropriate recommendations based on customer trends
and behavior analysis.
265 This has led to innovative new
projects such as the Kindle tablet and ebook readers.
4. Lead by Example
Actions speak louder than words. Bezos once said, “There
are two types of companies: those that work hard to charge
customers more, and those that work hard to charge cus-
tomers less. Both approaches can work. We are firmly in the
second camp.”
266 Many retailers talk about championing
customers and passing savings on to them, but few succeed

as well as Amazon, where “frugality” is one of the official
company values.
267
5. Connect the Dots
Bring parts of your company, teams, and resources together
to create more-effective solutions faster. Complaints can be
devastating in the age of viral tweets and blog posts. Bezos
and his Amazon managers across all disciplines and
departments attend two days of call-center training each
year. They do this to gain humility and empathy for the
customer, which also results in a far better working relation-
ship between departments.
268
6. Make It an Adventure
Back in 1997 Bezos passionately expressed his excitement
for the future: “This is Day 1 for the Internet. We still have
so much to learn.”
269 At Amazon’s new headquarters, two
of the largest buildings are Day 1 North and Day 1 South.
In interviews Bezos still refers to the Internet as an uncharted
world, imperfectly understood and yielding new surprises
all the time. This vision has proved hugely attractive to new
and existing employees who yearn to be part of the journey
of discovery and excitement that is now associated with
Amazon.
Tips on How to Apply This Recipe
Don’t take on too much at once, or you’ll be in danger of
starting too many initiatives and not completing any quickly
enough. Focus on a few key quick wins to show you are
serious and are capable of introducing change that is not
only effective, but supported by other parts of the business.
Key to becoming an effective leader is to know which rules
to break and what new rules to put in place to make a real
impact.

what is within your control before deciding to grow your
circle of influence. Be careful not to step on anyone else’s

toes, but instead leverage the skills within other departments
to help you achieve success. Once you have gained the trust
of the business, see if it makes sense to incorporate additional
resources from other departments as part of your team. For
example, bringing visual-design resources into a customer-
experience team to improve workflow and ultimately
produce a better product design makes good business sense.
Aspire to be a leader who is charismatic, takes the necessary
risks, and has a sixth sense for knowing what needs to be
done. This is the mentality you and your team need to adopt
and promote within your organization to provide relevant
disruptive change and instill enough confidence to start
making a real difference.

ThoughtWorks prides itself on hiring and retaining the best.

right level of support to keep their employees happy and
doing a great job.

Want to attract and keep the best of the best? Here’s how to
provide the right environment and opportunities:
1. Increase Happiness
Make people proud to be associated with you. Be very clear
about what employees are getting themselves into, and make
sure the entire project team is aware too. If there are any
changes in roles, notify others on the team so there are no
surprises. ThoughtWorks hires and retains extremely capable
and talented people—being named "Among Best Companies
to Work For in 2011-2012" proves the point.
270
2. Make It Personal
Understand what drives people, and help them improve.
ThoughtWorks runs targeted psychometric employee eval-
uations to help identify areas for improvement and oppor-
tunities for exploration. A discussion to review the results
is held at the employee’s earliest availability and in a location
of the employee’s choice. Relevant concerns and successes
are run through before an agreed-upon course of action is
put in place to monitor improvements, helping employees
continue being as effective and happy as possible. Employees
are also given the opportunity to work on one of the many
social-impact projects at ThoughtWorks—they can chose
the ones that best match their values.
3. Train Them Right
Set realistic expectations through practice. Expose new
employees to a real work environment as soon as possible.
ThoughtWorks runs “ThoughtWorks University,” a three-
to-six-week immersion program where seasoned Thought-
Workers mentor and guide new employees from the start
to the end of a project. Working as a real cross-functional
team, everyone has to learn to solve problems together to
deliver a finished product. Importantly, ThoughtWorks
University also provides new joiners with the opportunity
to be immersed in the ThoughtWorks culture and values
from the get-go.

4. Make It an Adventure
Make it interesting so they will never want to leave. Identify
projects that challenge, provide opportunities for growth,
and encourage creative experimentation. When they aren’t
on client projects, ThoughtWorks employees are encouraged
to pursue projects or ideas to grow their own knowledge
and skills, like trying new technology and approaches.
ThoughtWorks also holds monthly evening sessions called
Last Thursday, where they make announcements and
updates. There are many other events, too (Geek Nights,
Code Dojos, Awareness Nights), which means there’s
something going on every week.
5. Perform as a Team
Let employees know that the team and the wider company
is there to support them and help them be the best that they
can be. Collaboration, communication, creativity, and flexi-
bility are all traits ThoughtWorkers are encouraged to
embrace. Foster an environment of trust, openness, and
creativity and embrace change as an opportunity to do even
better work. Appreciate and support each other as a team
so you can achieve goals more efficiently. Be honest with
each other and don’t wait until it’s too late to let others know
if you need help.
6. Celebrate Success
Recognize the hard work people put in. At ThoughtWorks,
great individual and team work is internally recognized at
monthly get-togethers, individual appraisals, and team
feedback sessions. The company takes the time to personally
recognize folks who’ve made outstanding contributions
during the year. No good deed goes unnoticed. Great com-
panies realize that happy and capable employees make a
company successful, so they do a lot to make sure apprecia-
tion doesn’t go unexpressed.
Tips on How to Apply This Recipe
Hire people for what they’re good at, not what you want
them to be good at. People perform best when they are doing
what they enjoy most, so it is superimportant that you
understand what really drives employees so you can position

them within your team to be as effective as possible. Don’t
wait to recognize and utilize available talent, or you will
lose valuable people because they feel unmotivated and
underappreciated.
Work with your organization to highlight the biggest “rocks”
that need to be moved. Grow your team’s capabilities to be
effective at delivering what’s needed to support your orga-
nization’s biggest requirements. I work hard to incorporate
agile processes, a lean user experience, and lean-startup
principles to validate ideas early so that I can quickly make
visible what is most valuable with a minimum of investment.
I train and hire people who believe in and want to embrace
my approach and vision, so there is no doubt in my mind
that I have the support of a team with the right mindset for
success.
Make the workplace a fun and vibrant place to be to foster
a sense of creativity. Give your team the opportunity and
environment to grow and experiment while delivering
what’s needed to improve existing experiences. Customer
experience is a hands-on practice that should encourage
customers to “play” with ideas to get real and useful
feedback.
Inspired by Apple stores, I’ve created play areas where
anyone within the organization, every time they pass our
team’s open-plan workspace, can pick up a smartphone or
a tablet or interact with a desktop or laptop computer with
the latest prototypes on them. This reinforces our sense of
play and our live customer-validation process, allowing us
to run ad hoc usability tests, raise the team profile, and
increase team morale. Seeing other parts of the business
better understand and appreciate the value we offer, first-
hand, is invaluable.

Connecting with consumers directly to build an active online
community is the holy grail of any company that wants to
promote its brand through the power of social networking.
Try combining these ingredients to create a loyal community
that hangs out with you forever.
1. Understand Customer Needs
Embrace customer beliefs and work toward their goals.
Foursquare users "check in" so they can be recognized as the
first to discover a place and note what’s good and bad about
it. Identifying brand advocates who thrive on recommending
your products and services to their peers is one of the best
ways of building trust in your offering. Make these advocates
happy, and they will help you attract more customers.
2. Promote Your Team
Give customers insight into your cause and beliefs; tell them
how it all started, include the war stories, and help them
identify with people involved in your organization. Show
them how your solution fits their lifestyle, and be completely
transparent about your intentions. Get customers to connect
and empathize with your brand to start building a superloyal
relationship.
3. Crowdsource It
Make participants feel like part of a community that can
effect change, and make sure this change is apparent.
Empower close-knit communities that support each other
by allowing them to share what they think, do, and feel.
Foursquare has created interactions that allow peer-to-peer
content creation, sharing, and sourcing of appropriate
solutions.
4. Find the Sweet Spot
Not every social interaction is done with one brand or
through one channel alone. Understand where your cus-
tomers socialize online and offline to deliver an enhanced
experience by connecting these disparate aspects together.
Foursquare is a location-based online community that relies
on users exploring and checking in online when experiencing
real-world places. By joining the online digital world with
report erratum  •  discuss
A Recipe for Social Relevance • 227
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

the offline real one, Foursquare has created an environment
where real people can enjoy their real-world experiences
with others in the digital world.
5. Make It Personal
Give users profiles they can fine-tune to filter out unwanted
content and experiences and keep useful ones in. Like
someone you know, Foursquare can recommend things you
may like and remind you of past experiences based on your
interactions, both positive and negative. Become a useful
friend who knows who customers are, and be able to help
them find what they want and avoid things they will not
like.
6. Reward Them
Reward people for using your service and sharing their
experiences. Foursquare does this with offers and specials
that include vouchers users can redeem at real stores. Users
can also earn and unlock badges based on the frequency and
type of check-in. The more unique badges a user unlocks,
the more respect he receives. Foursquare also makes it
supereasy to share and notify others of these rewards on
customers’ other social networks.
Tips on How to Apply This Recipe
Try to create a platform and an ecosystem that let customers
naturally interact and express themselves around topics they
enjoy. Make it easy for them to engage where they want,
how they want, and with whom they want at any time. Make
people comfortable being who they are with others who
share a common interest or belief. I conduct customer
behavioral research to fine-tune experiences, making them
less intrusive and more relevant and engaging.
Don’t underestimate the power people have within their
social groups. Be quick to recognize individual expertise,
and let customers naturally influence those who identify
with their points of view. Peer recommendations are
important; adding this extra layer of validation will help
customers make more-confident decisions. Customer views
are always high on my list when creating any experience
where a sense of community is important.

Gamify the experience by giving customers extra incentive
to continue using your product or service. Try thanking
customers for their loyalty with real-world rewards so they
can claim food or drink in their favorite hangouts, for
example. Sometimes a reflection of peer validation—for
example, as a number of sales, follows, shares, comments,
or emails, as well as seeing their name high up on a leader-
board—is enough. This form of social validation is also very
important—just knowing your points of view are valuable
to others feels great.

Lean startups validate their business models by testing their
products or services with real customers early and often.
There’s absolutely no reason why large organizations can’t
embrace this philosophy to get cross-platform digital expe-
riences validated within weeks of discussing an idea. I set
up HaaYaa,
271 a cooperative of highly creative and skilled
individuals, to help large organizations create and refine
proof-of-concept prototypes until there are no doubts that
customers really want these organizations’ new products
and services. At the same time, I ensure these organizations
meet important business requirements. Being big doesn’t
mean you can’t think small.

Build Up Enough Momentum
Looking to create awesome experiences that customers
actually want and that businesses will see as a good invest-
ment? These ingredients will keep you lean, mean, and
superkeen:
1. Test Your Biggest Hypothesis First
Test risky and mission-critical assumptions as early as pos-
sible. If you don’t prove or disprove these first, you will
waste time building on unproven facts. I have taken
unproven assumptions about what customers like or dislike,
and used them to create digital concepts that can be tested
within the first few weeks of the start of most projects—first
in focus groups and later as interactive HTML prototypes.
These can include new navigation ideas, payment models,
and innovative interactions on mobile devices, tablets, and
interactive TV.
2. Slice It Thinly
Do the minimum needed to test your idea effectively. Focus
on key functionality to get your core value proposition across
clearly. Ensure the correct brand messaging is in place and
aim to delight customers. I encourage putting systems into
place for frequent and early testing of digital prototypes.
This allows basic value-added services like saving or sharing
to be validated before advanced features, such as personal-
ization, are added. Build in more depth of functionality after
you’re confident that the basics are in place and that you
have created a core set of services customers find really
useful.
3. Timebox It
Limiting the time to achieve tasks and still delivering
something of value takes discipline, creative thinking, and
a whole lot of trust. Start by prioritizing what’s important,
and allow time to make changes when you fine-tune ideas
report erratum  •  discuss

www.ebook777.com

later. I empower customer-experience teams to work with
the entire business to reduce the time needed to complete
tasks while still raising the dev and user-experience quality
bar. Shortening the time to complete and validate ideas
means there is time to fine-tune and enhance ideas once they
had been through usability testing. Be clear about what needs
to be achieved in the time given, though.
4. Fail Fast, Fail Often
Get stakeholders to acknowledge it’s best to know as early
as possible what does not work. Treat each stage of a project
as an experiment you can learn from to make improvements.
I urge customer-experience teams to run successive rapid
iterative tests and evaluations to get customer validation
and reveal new insight.
272 I also challenge design and
development teams to make improvements quickly between
subsequent tests.
5. Check the Data
Identify data across key experiences that indicate success
and failure. Analyze the data; gain enough insight and vali-
dated learning to make improvements. To keep track of the
results of these improvements, I set up customer-experience
teams to work with data-analytics teams on monitoring
usage stats to see each improvement’s effect on groups of
cohorts.
273 I also recommend running multivariate tests on
variations of a design concept to see which one is most suc-
cessful.
274
6. Build Up Enough Momentum
Make continuous improvements until you have a product
or service that truly delights. Multiple projects owned by
different parts of the organization are usually run in parallel.
The core functionality, enhancements, and new features of
each project are tested, and then they are quickly connected,

Tips on How to Apply This Recipe
Start with small projects and show success quickly. Once
these have proven to work, tackle larger projects. Find other
departments you can approach, and show them the benefits
of being involved in a new and more successful way of doing
things.
Try to get buy-in from peer and senior management. (I’ve
been able get CEOs, CTOs, and CIOs to buy into the value
of customer-experience design.) For example, you might
agree to bring native mobile-operating-system design and
front-end development resources into the customer-experi-
ence team. This can improve and speed up proof-of-concept
creation, validation, and design iteration.
I’m a huge lean-startup and lean-user-experience fan. Having
worked for large media companies in the roles of design
director and head of customer experience, I have always
championed the need for early customer validation. I used
the insight gained to reassess business needs and evolve
projects to make them more relevant and effective before
launch. I’ve also implemented post-launch support systems,
using continuous design and improvement to ensure projects
preserve their relevancy.

1. Understand Customer Needs
Observe what really annoys customers and come up with
ideas to remove their frustration. Drew realized existing
cloud-storage services had problems with Internet latency,
large-file storage, and usability. After creating Dropbox for
himself, he realized others could benefit from it too.
2. Be Really Good at One Thing
Be the best at one thing rather than OK at many things.
People trust brands with products and services focused on
one area so they don’t have to think too hard if they have to
make a choice. Dropbox is the easiest way to back up, access,
and share digital content from any desktop or mobile device.
3. Keep It Simple
Design something simple and reliable that fits with the way
people work. Dropbox automatically saves and syncs
updated files, and is easily accessible via any operating
system’s info bar.
4. Align with Expectations
Let users do what they want to do. Give them the freedom
to adapt your service to meet specific needs. Power users
found ways to enhance Dropbox functionality, like file-
sending via Gmail, remote application launching, and system
monitoring. Dropbox continuously optimizes its service,
encouraging innovative user-driven ideas such as these to
increase usage.
5. Make It Accessible
Get it to work seamlessly on any device. In response to the
launch of Google Drive and Microsoft’s SkyDrive, Dropbox
allowed users to automatically upload content from cameras,
tablets, SD cards, and smartphones at no extra cost. Dropbox
also provides client software for Microsoft Windows, Apple
Mac OS, Linux, Google Android, Apple iOS, BlackBerry OS,
and all popular web browsers.

6. Get Them Addicted
Employ gamification techniques to motivate people to con-
tinue using your services.
276 Show them how to stay active
and remain influential within their peer groups, socially
competing to be one up all the time. Don’t forget to reward
them for their efforts. Dropbox lets users gain more storage
space simply by getting people they know to sign up.
Tips on How to Apply This Recipe
Simplicity and a great customer experience play a big part
in creating a product or service that customers will want to
integrate into their lives. Start by reducing the number of
features, and improving this core set until the features
become the best they can be.
Define what success looks like. Realistically evaluate business
success metrics by building proofs of concept and validating
them with customers to see if they can be achieved. Reset
expectations and look for other ways to create business
success, factoring in customer behaviors, trends, and needs.
Test, test, test. Validate your ideas with customers and be
ready to keep evolving them until your customer and busi-
ness success metrics show you have a useful experience.
Work with parts of the business to gain required insight if
needed to provide your business or client with alternative
and additional opportunities, backed up with research and
usability-test feedback.

Whether you are new to the game or a wise old sage, this
recipe will help evolve your ideas so they always remain
relevant.
1. Make It Easy
Make it easy for your existing customers to experience the
latest technology. At the Consumer Electronics Show in
January 2013, Samsung announced that its Evolution Kit
would allow existing Smart TV customers to enjoy the latest
interactive services without having to purchase a new TV.
278
2. Increase Happiness
Keep delighting customers by understanding what matters
most to them and improving their experience to match their
expectations. Samsung realizes that innovation means new
interaction models that customers will need to familiarize
themselves with, so the company invested many hours cre-
ating a delightful onboarding journey to make the learning
and content-discovery experience an amazing and memo-
rable one.
279
3. Improve vs. Differentiate
Be better than everyone else. Samsung the world’s largest
commercial ultrahigh-definition TV built, the award-winning
S9000. The TV uses new LED technology to deliver the
brightest pictures ever, and it set a new industry standard
for picture quality.

Partner up with someone who will make you more awesome.
Leverage each other’s strengths to fill in gaps that would
have been difficult for you to fill on your own. In November
2012, Yahoo! and Samsung formed a multiyear partnership
to deliver interactive TV,
282 allowing Samsung Smart TV
owners to receive real-time, actionable content alongside TV
shows and commercials.
6. Know What Competitors Are Up To
Don’t let anyone beat you to it. If you believe competitors
are not playing ball, do what’s needed to set things right.
Samsung filed an injunction against LG, accusing it of engi-
neering leaks.

Tips on How to Apply This Recipe
Make adoption of future experiences as easy and painless
as possible. You may have a world-changing idea, but if it
is hard to understand and customers aren’t motivated
enough to want to adopt it, it will fail. Start by trying some-
thing new based on what has already been successful, and
make it better in at least one way.
Public relations is very important, and it can be anything
from low-cost viral marketing, where customer advocates
help spread the word about what you are doing, to having
a stand at important industry events to promote your new
product or service. Whatever your budget or method, make
sure it’s timely and appropriate—but most importantly,
make sure it’s done.
Partnering up, purchasing a third-party capability, or being
acquired yourself are all options to help you evolve. If the
focus is to enable a good idea to become more readily
available to a larger target audience in a shorter time frame,
then you really need to consider these seriously. After all, a
successful evolution means staying alive.

Here is how you, too, can continuously cook up exciting prod-
ucts that new and existing users just can’t get enough of.
1. Build an A-Team
One team can transform an entire organization.
285 Find that
unique set of awesome, capable, self-motivated individuals and
push them to achieve the impossible. This should not be an
exclusive club, and you can have more than one of these teams,
but they do need to be separated from the rest of the business
so as not to get distracted from creating that game-changing
idea. This is what Apple did when designing the iPod.
2. Test Your Biggest Hypothesis First
If you’re going to change the world, you’d better have some
big assumptions to test. To break into the MP3 market, Apple
had to create a totally different way of consuming digital
music.
286 The biggest assumption was that consumers could
access an online music library (the iTunes Store) using their
iPods and store music for playback later. That assumption
proved true, giving Apple a powerful new product and
service with which to enter the consumer-electronics world.
3. Challenge and Disrupt
Spot a really bad way of doing things, then improve it. The
iTunes Store was set up to support the launch of the iPod
and became the easiest way to purchase digital music, video,
and audiobooks. Major record labels gave up their own
content-download experiments when the iTunes Store
became the standard for digital content discovery and pur-
chasing. Every song was the same price—ninety-nine cents
—and users could purchase songs individually or by the
album with the click of a button. Simple.
4. Create a Tipping Point
Fine-tune your service offering until it fits naturally in cus-
tomers’ lives. Apple realized that consumers were looking
for products they could identify with that would be an

extension of their personality. The iPod advertising campaign
showed how fun and customizable iPods were, featuring
chart-topping hits like U2’s “Vertigo” and Coldplay’s “Viva
la Vida.”
287 Consumers instantly saw how the product fit
with their lifestyles, and sales shot through the roof. Con-
sumers found it cool to be associated with a product and a
brand that allowed them to express themselves.
5. Keep It Under the Radar
Do it differently, do it well, and do it so they go, “Wow!”
When Steve Jobs introduced the iPod in 2001,
288 you could
hear the audience gasp in amazement. The design had been
kept under wraps until the very last moment. Competitors
had to completely rethink sales, marketing, and product
strategies. Surprise and anticipation are now signature Apple
approaches when unveiling a product or service. Give target
audiences what they crave and satisfy their deepest desires.
6. Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish
Stay inquisitive and never tire of challenging the status quo.
Keep disrupting and asking “Why not?” If someone says
you can’t but you believe you can, do it. The iPod established
Apple as a serious consumer-product company. Steve Jobs
and Apple found a winning formula, creating innovative
products like the iPhone to prove critics wrong about the
need for such devices. As a result Apple became one of the
largest mobile phone–makers, joining Samsung and Nokia.

Tips on How to Apply This Recipe
Keep innovation projects and teams separate from tactical
and optimization (bug fixes and so on) ones. Don’t make the
mistake of thinking the same people can innovate, work on
tactical projects, and fix current live feature experiences. I
find that there’s always a compromise on the level of
innovation because people get too busy with tactical work.
I prefer having separate teams all producing results.

Focus on innovative ideas that solve the biggest customer
problems. See if these ideas fit with your organization’s
future vision, but be prepared to adapt that vision if you can
prove there is an opportunity to really own and disrupt a
new area. The Sun newspaper tries to cram in as much con-
tent as possible and push that to its readers. To attract new
customers and introduce a new paid-for subscription model,
I focus on pushing easier-to-use yet far more-personalized
experiences through digital devices like smartphones and
tablets. Considering the device and use cases for consump-
tion means delivering a shorter but more-relevant experience.
Don’t share too much too soon with too many people. Create
your innovative idea in its undiluted form and test it with
target customers. Use real feedback and results to persuade
stakeholders to invest the extra time and effort to make it a
reality. It’s the only way.

Only a small percentage of ideas get funded. We can pivot,

Kevin Systrom and Michel Krieger started Burbn before it
became Instagram.
291 They knew what they wanted and took
clear first steps toward achieving it by focusing on mobile
photography and a simple check-in process.
2. Build an A-Team
Investors love teams that show potential beyond the idea
they are buying. Pull together a group of people who can
work well together and keep coming up with great ideas.
Start small, keep the team lean, and show why each person
is vital to success. Instagram had only thirteen employees
when Facebook invested.
292 Investors buy into people first,
then the product or service.
3. Align with Expectations
Fill a gap in an investor’s portfolio. Show you can improve
a key performance indicator more quickly than the investor
can. Research what investors are looking for and evolve your
ideas where appropriate to fit with their current and future
business strategies. Although Facebook had its own photo-
upload feature, Facebook still bought Instagram just before
going public. Stay ahead of the investor curve in a given
market to prove there is potential in your idea.
4. Be Really Good at One Thing
Don’t throw too much into the mix; focus on one key com-
petitive differentiator and make it as unique as possible.
Investors see many companies, so make sure they remember
the one thing you are good at. Instagram created simple
digital photo filters that allowed hundreds of millions of
users to express their individuality; nothing else came close
in terms of ease of use.
5. Build Up Enough Momentum
Show a steady stream of loyal customers using your service.
Show that this is on the incline and that with each new
release or new idea you attract new customers as well as

million in October 2011, and more than 14 million by
December 2011. In July 2012, the company announced it had
more than 80 million accounts set up.

6. Time It Right
Understand the consequences of strategic plays. Don’t jump
the gun. Time it right, and the rewards will be huge. The
day the Android version of Instagram was released, it was
downloaded more than 1 million times. That same week it
received $50 million from venture capitalists for a share of
the company.

gram for approximately $1 billion in cash and stock.

It’s important to know what success looks like. Track what’s
really important. If you can’t track it, you can’t prove it. To
show how a concept has achieved success, I work with cus-
tomer-analytics teams to set up dashboards and reporting
tools that alert my team if any metric falls below an accept-
able level, helping us decide what we need to do to improve
a service offering.
Make it supereasy to understand what you’re doing. Show
how you meet a customer need by providing a service in a
unique way. When pitching your idea, prove there is cus-
tomer interest and clearly outline how what you are asking
for will be spent wisely and frugally. This applies to startups
as well as when you’re persuading internal stakeholders to
invest enough in an idea to back it and produce it.
I find the easiest way to get investment is to show proof of
interest, differentiation, and a clear plan of action, which are
all necessary to realize even more potential quickly.

RapidFTR (Family Tracing and Reunification)
295 is an open
source mobile-phone app that helps locate and reunite lost

It is run by the Child Protection in Emergencies team at

Crowdsource It
Increase Happiness
Do the right thing, and people will care about you and your
company even more. Here’s how to get that halo above your
head.
1. Promote Your Team
Remember, it’s never about you and always about someone
else’s happiness and success. Find a noble cause that fits
with your company’s beliefs as well as your own, and find
a way to support it. RapidFTR fit in well with my hunger to
do something meaningful and change the world. I wanted
to work on a project where I could personally make a differ-
ence to help people in truly dire conditions.
2. Make It Personal
Get your team members to identify with the problem. Once
they can relate to it, they won’t think twice about helping
out. Manage expectations by clarifying their role to leverage
their strengths, especially if they’re giving up free time for
the project. Appeal to personal goals for extra motivation.
As a child I got lost for a few minutes before my parents
found me. Children and family members can be separated
for months at a time in Uganda. Relating to the feeling of
being lost and knowing what it feels like to be found again
made me want to work on the project even more.
3. Don’t Jump to Conclusions
Factor in technological and cultural differences to deliver
the right solution. Find out who it’s for, when they’ll use it,
and what constraints and dependencies there are. In Uganda
none of the RapidFTR aid workers locating lost family
members had a smartphone. The first design challenge was
report erratum  •  discuss
A Recipe for Doing Social Good • 257
www.it-ebooks.info
www.ebook777.com

Free ebooks ==>   www.ebook777.com
to create an experience that could work on older Blackberry
phones. Until the right mass channel of delivery was consid-
ered, it was difficult to know if users would incorporate this
type of service into their daily lives.
4. Frame It
Help your team empathize. Try appealing to multiple senses
to heighten their view of reality. RapidFTR created a short
video to highlight the seriousness of the plight.
296 Draw direct
comparisons to family life and what the loss of a loved one
can be like, and ask for a sacrifice of a relatively small
amount of time and money to help solve these problems.
For example, the price of a cup of coffee each day can pay
for aid workers to go out in the field to capture information
and better conduct their inquiries and searches.
5. Crowdsource It
Many social-good projects rely on volunteers sacrificing
their own time and effort. RapidFTR crowdsourced its vol-
unteers from around the world, across different time zones.
297
When I worked on the project I was working with developers
in New York, Australia, Africa, India, and the United King-
dom. Where there is a will, there’s a way.
6. Increase Happiness
The satisfaction you get from launching a social-good project
outweighs any difficulties you may face delivering it.
RapidFTR continues to help reunite lost children with their
families, reducing the time and confusion normally associat-
ed with family-reunification projects. Knowing that you and
your team have made a really important, life-changing dif-
ference makes it all worthwhile. This level of happiness is
known as living a meaningful life.

Tips on How to Apply This Recipe
Try infusing social-good values into your organization’s
mission statement to include social and economic justice,
service to others, society over self, and doing the right thing.
It might make you feel better about who you are working
for and clarify why you are doing it.
Use social good to train yourself to understand constraints
and be able to factor in new requirements. In the RapidFTR
example, the constraints were the lack of smartphones for
which to design an experience, and the lack of a good mobile-
network infrastructure, which made it hard to deliver and
save up-to-date information.
Adopt a social-good mindset to add a sense of responsibility
to everything you do. Customers will appreciate the fact
that you stand for making the world a better place and are
not putting other agendas, like financial profit or world
domination, ahead of what will be good for human beings
and the planet. It will also help you make better decisions
about how best to portray your organization’s products and
services and give your company a human face when you
put customer needs first. This mindset serves particularly
well in customer-service scenarios, where empathy for
solving the most urgent problems is superimportant.

1. Improve vs. Differentiate
Google constantly readapts its products and services based
on changing market demands. One of its main focuses is on
improving the accuracy and flexibility of the Google search
algorithm.
299 Google realizes that having a great idea doesn’t
mean there isn’t a competitor already working on a similar
idea. That knowledge keeps Google on its toes to remain a
market leader.
2. Simplify Your Business Model
Like all the best ideas, innovation occurs only when you are
brave enough to remove, combine, or focus on concepts that
will make a real difference. Google responded to a potential
economic crisis by reapportioning time spent mainly on its
Google Apps for Business subscription model—the sell side
—and focusing more efforts on the buy side.

3. Cast It Far, Then Reel It In
Google loves crazy and “impossible” ideas. This gives the
company a chance to flex its innovation muscles. Although
some of Google’s innovations have been successful, many
haven’t.
301 Google continues to make bets that aren’t going
to scale successfully, and many that fail. But every time the
company makes progress toward changing the world. It is
difficult to stick to your beliefs while delivering something
people want. But do it—Google does.
4. Keep It Simple
Reduce the time it takes to complete tasks. Make features
really intuitive so there is little doubt what they are meant
to do.
302 The technology that powers Google’s search engine
is, of course, anything but simple. But the actual experience
of those fancy algorithms is something that would satisfy a
Shaker: a clean, white home page, typically featuring no

more than thirty lean words; a cheery, six-character, primary-
colored logo; and a capacious search box. It couldn’t be
friendlier or easier to use.
303
5. Give It Away
The choice of operating systems for cars is of growing
importance to manufacturers as consumers become more
fickle and knowledgeable. Google’s Android OS now runs
many car navigation systems.
304 The platform is open source;
carmakers can customize what they need.
6. Find Allies
It can be cost-effective to buy a company and integrate it
into your own if it makes sense strategically. Google has
bought more than 100 companies since 2001, including
Android Inc., which allowed it to move into the mobile-
operating-system marketplace; YouTube, which allowed it
to become the largest social video platform; and DoubleClick
to integrate into its AdSense service.
Tips on How to Apply This Recipe
The world is constantly changing. Don’t expect to stay at
the top of your game or aim to get there if you aren’t pre-
pared to adapt and look at new areas of growth. Google
started off as a search engine and now has spread its wings
to innovate in new and exciting areas no one thought the
company would dominate.
Make it easy to decide. I recently worked on designing dig-
ital experiences for a large supermarket chain. The intent
was to attract customers, who come in the store to purchase
food, to buy the supermarket’s own branded products and
services—including banking, mobile-phone, and credit-card
services; home and car insurance; and even on-demand
movie- and TV-streaming services. Customers are already
in the buying mindset when they walk into a store, so saving
money on everyday products and services sold by a trusted
brand should be an easy decision to make.

Do whatever it takes to be better. If you can partner with or
afford to buy a company that will help you grow faster at
the right time to corner a market, then you should look at
doing this before the competition does. Being first to market
and gaining traction as well as a large proportion of the
market share is what’s important, so do whatever it takes
to do this quickly. Be careful not to do anything out of line
with your organization’s values or make decisions that can
be detrimental to your brand, though.

Final Thoughts
I hope you’ve had fun trying new ingredients and creating
your own recipes for success. There are an infinite number
of useful ingredients out there in the real world, just waiting
to be discovered—I’ve brought together only a handful to
get you started.
My final advice: be quick to apply what you learn from
continuous trial and error. Doing this will not only build
character, but also help you make the most of any insight
you gain and become an expert so you can intuitively react
to current and future challenges. Like raw ingredients
needed to cook an amazing meal, early experimentation and
expert advice are the necessary components for finding the
best approaches for you and your team.
No matter where you are in your journey of self-discovery,
exploration, and problem-solving, never give up. Continue
taking the initiative, never settle for “OK,” fix things that
are obviously wrong, challenge the status quo, keep fine-
tuning your ideas, and, I promise, before long you’ll solve
those really big tech problems.
