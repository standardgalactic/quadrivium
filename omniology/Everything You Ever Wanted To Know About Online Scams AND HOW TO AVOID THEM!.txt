Introduction 
About this file, please read this! 
 
Congratulations on taking a major step towards avoiding online scams! By 
reading this report you’ll be in an excellent position to choose your business 
opportunities wisely.  
 
If you enjoy the free scam-busting information in this report, please pass it on 
to your friends, family members and associates. You could prevent them 
from falling victim to cyber-crime. If we can educate everyone, there will be 
fewer victims and less incentive for the scamsters to continue! By passing this 
report on to your friends you’ll help to prevent them being scammed, drive the 
scamsters out of business and make the Internet a safer place for everyone! 
Not bad for sending a few emails, or putting a link on your website! On the 
other hand, if you decide not to pass this report along, and your best friend 
gets scammed at an online auction, how hard will you kick yourself?! 
 
The Internet is a fantastic distribution medium. If you pass the file to just 
ten people, and they do the same, very soon everyone online will be better 
educated (and that’s hundreds of millions of people). In fact, you are just six 
people away from distributing one million copies, so your friends are 
just five people away! There’s no way that I could reach millions of people 
on my own, so please help! Here are a few distribution ideas… 
 
1: Forward this file as an email attachment to your friends, associates and 
relatives. The file can’t do any harm as it cannot contain viruses, plus it’s a 
very short file, so your friends won’t mind. Please, do not send the file to 
anyone you don’t know. Spam is one of the worst aspects of the Internet, 
and I don’t want to be part of it. 
 
 
2: Put the report on your website in a prominent position. You’ll add great 
free content and be doing a good thing for your visitors (which will build up 
your karma…always a good thing ☺). If you don’t want to put the file on your 
site, just link to it at the ScamFreeZone by pasting this code into your 
webpage(s)…

Where’s the Scam? Online! 
 
If I could sum up this e-report in one word it would have to be “beware”. As 
the owner of the ScamFreeZone, the “only place to find “ScamFree” 
opportunities”, it continually amazes me when people send me emails saying 
“please look at this page, is it a scam?” When I visit the page it has a crass 
sales pitch on a free server suggesting you send $5 to 5 friends and earn 
$50,000 in five days (or some such rubbish). The page has maybe a few 
broken images, several obvious spelling errors (only today I was going 
through this routine and saw a spelling error in the main title…would you 
believe “CANADIEN”. Seriously. Add to that the fact that there were no 
contact details, not even an email address, and I hope you can guess what I 
wrote to the guy who asked “is this a scam”! 
 
Scope of this report: Online Scams 
 
In order to decrease the number of people who fall victim to online scams I 
have decided to write down everything I’ve learned in nearly four years 
investigating the online world of cybercrime. If you use the information in this 
report in conjunction with the advice and opportunities at the ScamFreeZone, 
you’ll be almost certain to avoid the online scamsters! 
This report is only concerned with the scams you are likely to meet online. An 
examples of each scam is given, with pointers to look out for.

Definitions, Examples and Tips 
 
Many people are totally bewildered by the number of scams online. While it’s 
true that there are numerous different scams, they are basically just digital 
versions of scams that have existed offline for many, many years. Once you 
understand the terminology of the scam-world, you’ll be better prepared when 
you come across scams on bulletin boards, websites or in your inbox. 
 
Chain Letter 
 
Chain letters are a very good illustration of a scam updated and turned digital. 
I remember solicitations through the mail (snail mail, that is) to send $5 to five 
different people, move your name to the top of the list and wait for thousands 
of five dollar bills to come floating through the mailbox. Then, more recently, 
the same letter has flooded my inbox. Of course, the scam still involves 
sending money to strangers and hoping to get a windfall when your name 
reaches the bottom of the list and 10,000 people send you $5! Wouldn’t that 
be great? Very recently, in fact in the last few weeks, I’ve seen this chain 
letter “go totally digital”. Making use of the fact that a new Internet bank will 
give you $5 for signing up, the scam email suggests you join the bank and 
send your $5 digitally to the person on the top of the chain and move your 
name into third place. Now you don’t actually have to take $5 out of your 
pocket because it was only ever in your account online, so it looks as if you 
haven’t lost anything! The scam takes place much more quickly too because 
it’s all digital. Here’s an example of the scam as it looked in my inbox…all 
chain letters look pretty much like this, so you’ll know what to expect in your 
inbox soon!

*****************************  
Esquire Marketing Newsletter Gift ClubThis service 
is 100% legal (Refer to US Postal and Lottery Laws, 
Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, 
Section 3005 in the US code, also in the code of 
federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 
436, which state a product or service must be 
exchanged for money received) 
**************************  
 
Here's How It Works Unlike many other programs, 
this three level program is more realistic and 
much, much faster. Because it is so easy, the 
response rate for this program is VERY HIGH AND 
VERY FAST, Internet E- Mail FAST and you will see 
results in two weeks or less! Just in time for next 
month's bills! You only e-mail 20 copies (not 200 
or more as in other programs). You should also send 
them to people who send you their programs, because 
they know these programs work and they are already 
believers in the system! Besides, this program is 
MUCH, MUCH FASTER and has a HIGHER RESPONSE RATE! 
Even if you are already in a program, stay with it, 
but do yourself a favor and DO THIS ONE as well. 
START RIGHT NOW! It's simple and takes NO 
INVESTMENT!!! It will pay off long before other 
letters even begin to trickle in! Just give ONE 
person a $5.00 gift. That's all! Follow the simple 
instructions and in two weeks you will have 
US$20,000 in your bank account! Because of the ZERO 
INVESTMENT, SPEED, and HIGH PROFIT POTENTIAL, this 
program has a VERY HIGH RESPONSE RATE! Just one (1) 
US$5.00 bill That you get FREE at PayPal !!!! 
 
********************************************** 
Follow These Simple Instructions  
 

1)E-Mail the $5.00 from your PayPal account to the 
FIRST name on the list (#1) along with a note to 
"Please add me to your mailing list". Only the 
first person on the list gets your name and a five- 
dollar gift. 
 
2) Edit only the list, removing the FIRST (#1) NAME 
FROM THE LIST. Move the other two names UP and ADD 
YOUR NAME to the list in the THIRD (#3) position. 
Note: do not forget to replace the PayPal referring 
URL in the body of the letter with you own PayPal 
referring URL. 
 
3) Send out 20 copies of this letter. NOTE: by 
sending this letter and the payment via EMAIL, the 
response time is much faster-- INTERNET E-MAIL 
FAST. Consider this, MILLIONS of people surf the 
Internet everyday, all day, all over the world! 
Fifty thousand new people get on the Internet every 
month! An excellent source of names is the people 
who send you other programs and the names listed on 
the letter they send you. Your contact source is 
UNLIMITED! It boggles my mind to think of all the 
possibilities! Mail, or should I say Email, your 
letter and payment TODAY! It's so easy. One hour of 
your time, THAT'S IT! 
 
To send your newsletter by 
Email:  
 
1) Go to "edit" and select all  
2) Go to "edit" and "copy"  
3) Start (compose) a new Email message  
4) Address your Email and Subject blocks  
5) Go to "edit" and "paste"  
 
After you have pasted this article to your new 
Email, delete the old header and footer (Subject, 
Date, To, From, Etc.) Now you can edit the names 
and addresses with ease. I recommend deleting the 
top name, adding your name and address to the 
bottom of the list, and then simply changing the 
numbers. Note: do not forget to replace the PayPal 
referring URL in the body of the letter with your 
own PayPal referring URL. THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO 
DO. When your name reaches the first position in a 
few days, it will be your turn to collect your 
gifts. The gifts will be sent to you by 1,500 to 
2,000 people like yourself, who are willing to 
invest one hour to receive US $20,000 in cash. 
That's all! There may be a total of US$20,000 in 
US$5.00 bills in your mailbox in two weeks. 
US$20,000 for one hours work! I think it's WORTH 
IT, don't you? 
 
 
GO AHEAD--TRY IT. IT'S FREE EVEN IF YOU MAKE JUST 3 
OR 4 THOUSAND, WOULDN'T THAT BE NICE? IF YOU TRY 
IT, IT WILL PAY!

TRUE STORY Cindy Allen writes: I ran this gift 
summation four times last year. The first time I 
received over $7,000 in cash in less than two weeks 
and over $20,000 in cash in the next three times I 
ran it. I can't begin to tell you how great it 
feels not to have to worry about money anymore! I 
thank God for the day I received this letter! It 
has truly changed my life! Don't be afraid to make 
gifts to strangers-- they'll come back to you in 
ten- fold. So, let's keep it going and help each 
other out in these tough and uncertain times. CAN I 
DO IT AGAIN? OF COURSE YOU CAN- this plan is 
structured for everyone to send only 20 letters 
each. However, you are certainly not limited to 20. 
Mail out as many as you can. Every 20 letters you 
send has a return of $20,000 or more. If you can E- 
Mail forty, sixty, eighty, or whatever, GO FOR IT! 
THE MORE YOU PUT INTO IT THE MORE YOU GET OUT OF 
IT. Each time you run this program, just follow 
steps 1 through 3 and everyone on your gift list 
Benefits! Simple enough? You bet it is! Besides, 
there are no mailing lists to buy (and wait for), 
and trips to the printer or copier, and you can do 
it again and again with your regular groups or 
gifters, or start up a new group. Be sure and pay 
the first person on the list this is proof that you 
paid to get put on a list which is the service 
rendered to make all this legal!!!! Why not? It 
beats working! Each time you receive an MLM offer, 
respond with this letter! Your name will climb to 
the number one position at dizzying rates. Follow 
the simple instructions, and above all, PLEASE PLAY 
FAIR. That's the key to this programs success. Your 
name must run the full gamut on the list to produce 
the end results. Sneaking your name higher up on 
the list WILL NOT produce the results you think, 
and it only cheats the other people who have worked 
hard and have earned the right to be there. So 
please, play by the rules and the $$$ will come to 
you!

You probably are skeptical of this especially with 
all the different programs out there on the Web but 
if you don't try this you will never know. That's 
the way I felt. I've been watching this type of 

program for years and this is about as easy and 
fast as you can get it and it can even be free to 
try now with Paypals help, no stamps, no envelopes, 
no copies to be made just a little effort and 
faith!

Quick Point: 
Anyone notice the glaring spelling error “Hree's the Link”. As I mentioned 
above, this is always a dead giveaway of classic spam and a scam! 
End Quick Point. 
 
So with the above chain letter you just send $5 to one person electronically, 
and make a fortune! Unfortunately, this chain letter will be as (un)successful 
as all the others. I want to make another point about this email, and all the 
others like it. They usually proclaim “legality” because a “service or product” 
is being “purchased”. I’ve had several people email me asking how they can 
find out whether or not the scheme is legal. My belief is that a scam is a 
scam is a scam. Whether it’s technically legal (it’s not) is irrelevant because 
only people who participate in it care, and there’s no reason at all to 
participate, unless you want to throw your money away. Believe me, no-one 
makes money through chain letters!  
 
Envelope Stuffing  
 
This scam is another “golden oldie”. Nowadays it’s sent by email, posted on 
bulletin boards and plastered over web-pages, but it’s still a scam. Basically, 
the scammer proposes sending you materials (envelopes to stuff and mail 
out, toys to assemble, kits to put together etc) which you stuff/assemble and 
send back. For each item stuffed/assembled you earn a certain amount. 
Here’s the hazard light: you are asked to send in a dollar amount ($20/$50) 
for a “starter kit” (or similar wording). The company will then send out initial 
materials which you stuff/assemble, send them back and get paid. Invariably, 
one of three things happens...  
 
1: You send in your money and get nothing (most common)  
2: You get the materials, stuff/assemble, send them back and then never get 
paid. 
3: You’re sent a letter saying to mail the same “envelope stuffing scheme” 
letter to a few thousand others and earn money from them! Bingo, you’re in 
business…scamming others!  
 
To paraphrase George Bush… 
“Read My Lips: I’ve never heard of a genuine envelope stuffing opportunity 
and I doubt I ever will!”. 

 
Here’s an example, just plucked off the Web at random… 
 
Start 
 
Make $1.00 Per Envelope Stuffed 
In order to get you started immediately, we must require a one-time 
registration fee of $14.00 plus a $1.00 shipping and handling to become a 
permanent independent Home-Mailer in our association. This covers our expenses 
in materials and showing you what to do so you can work as long as desired. 
 
There is nothing else to ever buy from us in order to get started in this 
program. In as much as we would like to send our program without the small 
registration fee, we must protect ourselves from those few who are not serious 
and have no intention other than to satisfy their curiosity. Naturally, No 
business can afford to send out costly materials to everyone.  
Now it is all up to you! Start now by printing and mailing the order 
form IMMEDIATELY, and start taking those first important steps on the road 
to working from the comforts of your own home! Don’t put off another 
minute because our quota for mailers may soon be filled. All request must 
include full payment. We will refund your registration fee after you send 
us your first 100 envelopes, this is in addition to your regular rate of 
$1.00 per envelope. 100% fully GUARANTEED!!  
 
We appreciate your helping us, and I’m sure you’ll enjoy 
your extra income. Please print and complete the registration form and  
mail it today! We are looking forward to helping you get started.

Amount of money I would like to earn each week:

End 
 
That last line really cracks me up! Think to yourself before considering this 
“opportunity”, “If a machine can stuff envelopes (or assemble toys) 100 times 
faster than me, why do they want me to do the work?” The answer is, they 
don’t, they just want your money. 
 
MLM (Multi-Level Marketing) 
 
MLM by itself is not a scam, it is simply a method of marketing by which 
people can earn money on sales generated by people they recruit as well as 
by sales they make themselves. It’s an interesting fact of Internet marketing 
that as a consequence of no-one being able to reach everyone, the 
marketing paradigm online revolves around using networks of resellers. A 
prime example is the army of resellers that Amazon pays 10% of any sales 
generated from their websites. Even the ScamFreeZone has an associates 
program whereby you earn 50% of each sale (a bit more generous than 
Amazon). The fact that the programs only pay out based on sales makes 

them legitimate. When most people hear the term MLM they think of pyramid 
schemes which are illegal scams. The difference between MLM and pyramid 
schemes is explained in the next section… 
 
Pyramid schemes. 
 
There are tell-tale signs for when you should be suspicious that a MLM 
scheme is really a pyramid. Firstly, you are expected to pay to join with some 
of that money given to the people who recruited you. Secondly, there appears 
to be no product being sold, or the product that is being sold appears to be 
“false” such that emphasis is put on recruiting people, not selling product. As 
far as I understand it, and I’m not a lawyer, if the program generates most of 
its money through recruiting people, not selling product, and you would earn 
your money by recruiting others, then the scheme is most likely an illegal 
pyramid scheme. One of my golden rules is that it is not necessary to pay 
to join an opportunity, especially online. Hence, you can avoid all pyramid 
schemes by following that one rule. Actually, the chain letter described above 
is a good example of a pyramid. There are several levels, you ‘earn’ money 
by recruiting others, there’s no “real” product and you’ll never make any 
money!  
 
Internet Auctions  
 
Online auctions account for nearly 90% of online fraud. Basically, people 
who put items up for sale at online auction sites are rarely vetted. Usually 
anyone can sign up and purport to sell anything. It’s only after you send in 
your money, and receive nothing in return, that you realise you’ve been 
scammed. Some sites list the number of “comments” received about a seller, 
but these could have all been faked using different free email addresses and 
are no guarantee to credibility. Obviously, you can investigate the validity of 
auction items from businesses by calling the business directly, talking to the 
local consumer protection agencies and asking for customer references. If the 
seller is an individual not only are you more likely to be scammed, but you’re 
less likely to be protected by laws that govern the sale of items from 
businesses to consumers. So be doubly careful. Other ways to protect 
yourself are: 
 
Get informed. Ask about the physical location of the seller, their telephone 
number, delivery date/time, guarantees, refund/return policy, service 
agreements.  
 
Pay by credit card for added protection. Alternatively, ask if you can pay by 
cash on delivery whereby you pay when the goods arrive at your door. 
Another option is to use an escrow account, someone who holds the money 
until the goods arrive, then releases it to the seller.  
 
Investment Scams 
 
As every opportunity you invest time or money into is, by definition, an 
investment, anything that robs you of that time or money is an investment 

scam. It is therefore necessary to narrow the definition for the purposes of this 
report. What I’m talking about are online scams that prey on people who 
invest in stocks and shares, a very popular activity. The most common 
problem is that it’s very difficult to determine the validity of an online source. 
Anyone can build and host a respectable website with their own dot com 
name for under a hundred dollars so you need to carefully pick the websites 
you trust. Furthermore, most websites whose topic is stocks and share advice 
will have message/bulletin/web boards where people post “tips”. These are 
notoriously untrustworthy. Several individuals have been prosecuted for 
promoting stocks that they had shares in. They simply artificially boosted the 
share value and sold their shares at a tidy profit. Subsequently, everyone who 
bought shares based on the “tip” sees the share go down through the floor 
because not only was the reason behind the share-boosting tip bogus, but 
now the shares have had adverse publicity and fall because of it! The same 
thing can happen with newsletters sent out by websites and “regular” 
newsgroups such as usenet, so be careful who your trust.  
 
Quick Point: 
By the way, it’s illegal according to federal securities law to hold shares and 
recommend (tout) them without disclosing that you own the stock, or are 
being paid to recommend it.  
End Quick Point. 
 
Email is also used to solicit for investors. One of the most famous scams, 
which doen’t involve stocks and shares, but illustrates my point is the famous 
Nigerian fee scam. Only the other day I received this message from 
someone who thankfully found out about the scam before it was too late… 
 
“msg: Received this email on 18 July 2000 (details followed of Nigerian Fee 
scam email). Used your site to confirm it was a scam. Thank you for your 
service.” 
 
Basically, the scam boils down to someone claiming to be from the Nigerian 
Central Bank or Nigerian Government requesting your bank account details 
under the pretext that they have a huge amount of money in Nigeria and need 
to "salt it away" in foreign bank accounts. They will deposit the money into 
your account and come back for it later. You get to keep either the interest 
accrued, a percentage of the deposit or a flat fee (this varies). Once they have 
you interested in the venture, they announce unforeseen fees or taxes 
which you need to pay before the money can be released. Each fees/tax is 
said to be the "last" one, but never is. By this method they milk your bank 
account. 
 
This particular scam became very sinister when an American was murdered 
in Lagos, Nigeria in 1995 as a result of becoming involved in it.

Other types of investment scam include… 
 
Spectacular returns! For a small initial investment you stand to gain high 
returns with low risk….I don’t believe for a moment that anyone smart enough 
to be reading this e-book would fall for such a trick! 
 
Offshore investments! Be very careful investing beyond your country’s 
borders. The Internet makes such investments easy, but should you lose your 
money, the police in your country will have trouble catching villans in another. 
 
 
 

What to look out for… 
  
1: Promises of quick profits, “insider information” and pressure to invest. 
2: People commonly use “alter egos” online. Look out for people giving 
information with free email accounts or promoting several investments. 
3: High profit comes from a high risk investment. If anyone promises high 
return with low risk be suspicious. 
4: Research companies thoroughly. Investigation before investing will pay off 
in the long run. Do business with companies you trust. 
5: Check with the Better Business Bureau, and Securites and Exchange 
Commission for details on a company 
6: Get the details right. Know what you’re investing in, how much it will cost, 
when the product (if any) will arrive and the guarantee/returns policy. 
7: Guard your own info. Don’t give out social security numbers, bank 
account numbers or credit card numbers to people/businesses you don’t trust. 
8: When you have to pay, credit cards are better than cash, checks or money 
order. For a start, the business has to be able to accept credit cards which 
gives it slightly more credibility. Secondly you can dispute charges if 
something goes wrong. 
9: Don’t trust giltz. Anyone can build a glitzy website. It does not mean 
they’re respectable. 
10: Any offer sent by unsolicited commercial email (UCE, spam) is bad news. 
For a start, it has probably been sent to six million other people. Also, anyone 
who sends spam is not likely to be in “business” for long as their ISP will 
terminate their service. 
 
Credit Repair Cons 
 
Companies offering to erase your bad credit or set up a new credit file for an 
upfront fee are simply fraudsters. The only information that can be removed 
from your credit report is false information and you can get it removed by 
yourself simply and for free. Contact the credit reporting agencies for details 
of how this is done. Negative information, if factually accurate, cannot be 
removed although, if you have good reason, you can insert a note in with your 
report detailing why there’s negative information such as you fell behind on a 
car loan because of documented ill health. If you do use a company to correct 
your credit report, they have to bill you after making the changes. It’s 
illegal for them to charge you upfront.  
 
Online Job Opportunities 
 
Several websites offer access to a database of “job opportunities”. In line with 
other opportunities, be suspicious if asked to pay upfront. Legitimate 
websites will earn money from the businesses offering jobs and will not need 
to charge visitors too. Double check any refunds policy. Sometimes they 
contain clauses which prevent you from getting a refund, such as having to 
show refusal from three applications within 30 days. Make sure you have a 
written contract, with all the clauses, sub-clauses and small print read and 
checked carefully. Get references from anyone who has used the service, 
preferably not directly from the company. Search the Internet using the 

company name and see what you can discover…is there bad press on some 
websites?

Bonus Article:  
Six “Must Have” Resources To Start Your Online Business 
 
In order to be successful online, you absolutely must have the six items 
detailed below, or equivalents. There’s no getting away from it. Offline 
businesses need startup investment to buy the tools of their trade, and so do 
online businesses. It’s vital to your success that you buy from the right 
sources. Getting the right equipment for the least amount of money in the 
shortest amount of time could end up saving you weeks of effort and 
hundreds of dollars. This list aims to help you accomplish that goal by asking 
you six questions. To succeed online you must have good answers! 
 
 1:What’s Your Name?  
If you’re serious about being online at all, you need your own domain name. I 
took ages to get a domain name, I thought it “just wasn’t necessary”. Now I 
can see, looking back, I made a terrible mistake. If you won’t spend $30 per 
year on your own business name, then why should anyone trust you? Make 
your domain name short, sharp and catchy. Then register it. For all my 
domain names I use Registrars. See if your chosen name is available… 
http://scamfree.com/domain/ 
 
 2: Where Do You Live?  
You need to have your domain name and webpages hosted. The best hosting 
company on the Internet, in my opinion, is Virtualis. I host the ScamFreeZone 
and over 25 other domains on a Meta server costing me over $200 per month. 
So I have the experience necessary to recommend them to you. Click on 
the link to learn more…

 3: What Do You Sell?  
You need to have something to sell online. Let’s cut to the chase. The biggest 
profit comes from selling an info product, music or software because 
they’re all digital products that can be downloaded. The best way to get 
started is to write your own info-product. My own e-book describes, in total 
detail, step-by-step, how to write and sell your own info-product…

 4: Can You Sell It, No, Really Sell It? 
Make sure you learn from the best sources. The biggest and best Internet 
Marketing course I know of is by Corey Rudl at the Internet Marketing Center. 
He’s so sure you’ll love his course, he’ll give you back double your money if 
you don’t! 
http://scamfree.com/corey/ 
 
 5: Do You Take Credit Cards?  
I love this question. Yes, you must accept credit cards. No, unless you do 
thousands of dollars a year in sales, you don’t need your own merchant 
account. There are companies out there that accept credit cards for you. 
Some work for a flat percentage, which is excellent because you don’t have to 
pay out any money if you don’t sell anything! Other companies charge an 

initial setup fee, then a lower percentage rate. I built a website that compares 
all the different services, it’s at: 
http://nomerchantacct.com/ 
 
 6: Does Your Counter Have Sparks Flying?  
You need traffic, people, visitors and hits! At the moment, most of the search 
engines let you submit your web-pages for free. The “trick” is to get to the top 
of the listings. An online expert at search engine placement is Michael 
Campbell. He generated $700,000 in online sales using just his search 
engine ranking tactics. I bought his e-book, “Nothing But ‘Net”, and it’s superb!

Are You Rich Yet?  
Probably not…it takes a long time to build a reputable business online. In 
that respect, it’s no different to offine. However, if you put in the sweat, the 
hours and the effort online, the profit margins are huge! Literally. Where else 
can you make a product for nothing, sell it for $50 and ship it for nothing? 
Amazing. I want to give you one last tip for success. As much as I’d like you 
to join my associates program, I have to mention another. No-one on the 
Internet helps their associates as much as this guy. His products are 
phenomenal, his associates program is fantastic and I just have to 
recommend him to you. By joining his associates program you’ll learn a terrific 
amount about marketing online. Plus you’ll get his products at a discount. His 
name? Ken Evoy. His site…

Hint: Look for the affiliate link on the left-hand side of the page! 
 
By the way, there are tens of thousands of associate programs online. I 
strongly suggested you sign up at Ken’s site, but if you want to find out about 
other associate programs, the place to visit is Allan Gardyne’s website. Allan 
has built a fantastic website with thousands of associate programs listed. If 
you want the “breaking news” from a highly respected authority on associate 
programs, sign up for his excellent newsletter…

About the ScamFreeZone 
 
Since late 1997 the ScamFreeZone has been compiling a 200-category 
directory of ScamFreeZone "Member Sites". Our "Member Sites" offer 
business opportunities that have been certified, by the owner, as 'Scam Free'.  
All Member Sites have pledged, on the honor system, that their business 
opportunities are honest and genuine; they then get a free listing in the 
directory.  
 
*** If any negative comments are received about any site, it is investigated 
and its listing may be removed ***  
 
We have carried out several investigations and all but two have been 
complete resolutions in favour of the customer. The other two sites have been 
removed from the directory. Scamfree LLC offers this service as a positive 
step to promoting real business opportunities on the Internet. We see this as 
preferable to the negative "all business opportunities on the Internet are 
scams" and hope this site will help people searching the Internet for home 
business opportunities.
