About the Author
René Fester Kratz, PhD, grew up near the ocean in Rhode Island. From a 
young age, she wanted to be a teacher (because she loved her teachers 
at school) and a biologist (because her dad was one). She graduated from 
Warwick Veterans Memorial High School and then went on to major in biol-
ogy at Boston University. As a freshman and sophomore at BU, René got 
excited by subjects other than biology and even considered changing her 
major. Then, she met and studied under Lynn Margulis, who reignited René’s 
love of biology and introduced her to the world of microbes. René graduated 
with a bachelor’s degree in Biology from BU and then went on to get a mas-
ter’s and a doctorate degree in botany from the University of Washington. At 
UW, René studied reproductive onset in Acetabularia acetabulum, a marine 
green alga that grows as single cells big enough to pick up with your fi ngers. 
René currently teaches biology and general science classes at Everett 
Community College in Everett, Washington. René spends most of her time 
introducing students to the wonders of cells and microbes as she teaches 
cellular biology and microbiology. René also has a strong interest in sci-
ence education and science literacy for everyone. As a member of the North 
Cascades and Olympic Science Partnership, she helped create inquiry-
based science courses for future teachers that are based on research on 
human learning. René loves teaching these courses because they make 
science accessible for all kinds of people. In the summer, René enjoys work-
ing with K–12 teachers on the improvement of science education in the 
public schools. René also enjoys writing about science and is the author of 
Microbiology The Easy Way for Barron’s Educational Press.
René loves living in the Pacifi c Northwest because she is near the ocean and 
her daffodils start blooming in February (when her family back East is still 
shoveling snow). She doesn’t mind the rain and thinks the San Juan Islands 
are one of the most beautiful places on Earth. Her husband, two sons, and 
two very bad dogs help her remember what is truly important and her 
“sisters” help keep her sane. René loves to scrapbook, quilt, stitch, and read.


Dedication
To my husband, Dan, and my sons, Hueston and Dashiel. You are the center 
of my world.
To my mom, Annette. It may be corny, but you are the “wind beneath my wings.”
To my dad, James. I wanted to be a biologist because of you.
To Lynn: Thank you for inspiring a lifelong love of learning and microbes.

Introduction
M
olecular and cellular biology isn’t just something that happens in 
a lab; it reaches out and touches your life in many ways, seen and 
unseen. Genetically modified organisms, designer cancer drugs, forensic sci-
ence, and even home pregnancy tests are all applications of the science and 
techniques of molecular and cellular biology. Gaining an understanding of 
molecular and cellular biology can help you make informed decisions about 
your lifestyle and health.
Understanding cells and how they function is fundamental to all other fields 
of biology, including medicine. All living things are made of cells, and scien-
tists can trace every response, every function of larger organisms back to the 
structure and function of cells. Genetic diseases are a dramatic example of 
how important one cell type, one protein, and one gene can be to an organ-
ism. Exploring this connection between genes, proteins, and cellular function 
is at the heart of molecular and cellular biology.
As you take your own journey into the inner space of the cell, I hope this 
book will act as your guidebook, pointing out landmarks and signposts, and 
translating the sometimes complicated language of the local inhabitants!
About This Book
Molecular & Cellular Biology For Dummies is an overview of the fundamentals 
of molecular and cellular biology. My goal is to explain each topic in a clear 
and straightforward fashion, keeping scientific jargon to a minimum. I want this 
book to be understandable by anyone who picks it up, even if they don’t have 
a science background. To help you understand what is sometimes a complex 
science, I share every analogy, funny story, and memory trick that I’ve gath-
ered in my ten years of teaching this subject. These types of gimmicks help my 
students wrap their brains around the fundamental principles of molecular and 
cellular biology, and I hope these strategies will help you, too.
In Molecular & Cellular Biology For Dummies, I emphasize the main concepts 
and fundamental processes that are at the heart of molecular and cellular 
biology. When I had to make a choice between getting the main idea across 
or including every molecular detail of a process, I chose the main idea. I think 
that once you understand the main concept or the big events of a process, you 
can later add in details fairly easily. However, if you try to tackle a complicated 

2
Molecular & Cell Biology For Dummies 
process and every little detail at the same time, you can hit information over-
load and not really understand anything at all. My emphasis on main ideas and 
events will make the subject of molecular and cellular biology easier, but that 
doesn’t mean the topic will be easy. The world of the cell is complex and busy 
with detailed processes, so understanding molecular and cellular biology is a 
challenge for most people. I hope that this book will help you succeed in that 
challenge.
Conventions Used in This Book
In order to explain things as clearly as possible, I keep scientific jargon to 
a minimum and present information in straightforward, linear style. I break 
dense information into main concepts and divide complicated processes into 
steps.
To help you find your way through the subjects in this book, I use the follow-
ing style conventions:
 
✓ Italic is used for emphasis and to highlight new words or terms that are 
defined in the text.
 
✓ Boldface is used to indicate key words in bulleted lists or the action 
parts of numbered steps.
 
✓ Web addresses are written in monofont so that you can easily recognize 
them.
What You’re Not to Read
Sidebars are shaded gray boxes that include stories or information related 
to the main topic, but not necessary to your understanding. You can skip the 
sidebars if you want, but they contain some pretty fun and interesting infor-
mation so I’m guessing you’ll read them anyway.
You can also skip any information marked with a Technical Stuff icon (see 
“Icons Used in This Book” later in this Introduction) without hurting your 
understanding of the main concepts. For someone who wants or needs to 
pick up all the details of a process, the Technical Stuff provides a more in-
depth explanation.

 Introduction
Foolish Assumptions
As I wrote this book, I tried to imagine who you might be and what you may 
need in order to understand molecular and cellular biology. Here’s who I 
pictured:
 
✓ You’re a student in a molecular and cellular biology class who is having 
trouble understanding everything and keeping up with the pace of the 
class. For you, I present the topics in a straightforward way with an 
emphasis on the most important concepts and processes. By reading 
this book before you go to lecture, you may have an easier time under-
standing what your professor is talking about.
 
✓ You’re a student in a molecular and cellular biology class who is deter-
mined to get an A, and you want to gather all possible resources to help 
you in your goal. For you, I make studying more efficient by presenting 
the core concepts of molecular and cellular biology in straightforward 
bulleted lists. These lists can supplement your own notes, making sure 
that you’ve nailed the big ideas.
 
✓ You’re someone who wants to know more about the science behind the 
stories you hear in the news and see on TV. Maybe you’re interested in 
forensic science and want a better understanding of what they’re talk-
ing about on CSI and the Discovery Channel. Or maybe you’re worried 
about the potential impacts of genetically modified organisms or genetic 
screening on our society, and you want to know more about the science 
behind these topics. For you, I try to keep terminology to a minimum 
and include lots of analogies to help you relate the science to your 
everyday life.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into seven parts, with each part containing related sub-
jects. Like all For Dummies books, each chapter is self-contained, so you can 
pick up whenever you need it and jump into the topic you’re working on. 
Once I explain a subject, I use that information in later topics. So, if you don’t 
read the book in order, you may occasionally want to refer to another section 
for background information. In those cases, I refer you to the appropriate 
chapter.

Molecular & Cell Biology For Dummies 
Part I: The World of the Cell
All living things are made of cells. In this part, I introduce the fundamental 
structure and function of cells. I also introduce viruses, microscopic particles 
that attack and destroy cells.
Part II: Molecules: The Stuff of Life
Living things are made of cells and cells are made of molecules. In this part, 
I explain the fundamental cellular chemistry that is necessary to understand 
the molecular nature of cells.
Part III: The Working Cell
The cell is the fundamental unit of life and possesses all the characteristics 
of living things: Cells require food, reproduce themselves, respond to signals, 
and exchange materials. In this part, I describe how cells function, including 
how they communicate, obtain matter and energy, and reproduce.
Part IV: Genetics: From One 
Generation to the Next
In living things that reproduce sexually, including humans, parents pass the 
instructions for life to their offspring. In this part, I describe how parental 
cells organize their DNA during sexual reproduction and demonstrate how 
scientists can predict and analyze inheritance patterns using the principles 
of Mendelian genetics.
Part V: Molecular Genetics: Reading the 
Book of Life
The DNA code is the underlying programming for how cells function and 
develop. In this part, I explain the essential core of molecular biology, includ-
ing how DNA is copied and read by cells, how it determines the traits of 
organisms, and how DNA is regulated by the cell.

 Introduction
Part VI: Tools of Molecular Biology: 
Harnessing the Power of DNA
Powerful tools have enabled scientists to explore and manipulate the DNA 
code, opening a new frontier in biological science. In this part, I describe how 
scientists can use the tools of molecular biology to explore genomes and 
apply biological knowledge to solve current world problems.
Part VII: The Part of Tens
Like all For Dummies books, this book contains a Part of Tens where I include 
lists of fun and interesting topics related to molecular and cellular biology. 
In this part, I include ten fundamental rules that govern the behavior of cells 
and ten tips for improving your grade!
Icons Used in This Book
All For Dummies books use icons to help identify particular types of informa-
tion. Here’s the list of icons I use in this book and what they all mean:
 
I use this icon to emphasize main ideas that you should definitely keep in 
mind.
 
I use this icon to present study tips or other information that can help you 
navigate through difficult material.
 
I use this icon to flag detailed information that isn’t essential to the main con-
cept or process being presented. If you’re not a student in a molecular and cel-
lular biology class, you can definitely skip this material.
 
I use this icon to flag potentially confusing ideas or common wrong ideas that 
people typically have about how something works. I know about these danger 
spots from my years of teaching, and I’ve flagged them to help you avoid these 
pitfalls.

Molecular & Cell Biology For Dummies 
Where to Go from Here
With Molecular & Cellular Biology For Dummies, you can start anywhere in the 
book that you want. If you’re reading this book for general interest, you’ll prob-
ably find it best to begin at the beginning with the chapter on cells and then 
move to whatever interests you next from there. If you’re currently having 
trouble in a molecular and cellular biology class, jump right into the subject 
that’s confusing you. If you’re using the book as a companion to a molecular 
and cellular biology class that is just beginning, the book follows the organiza-
tion of most college classes with one exception — most college classes work 
from the smallest to the largest, beginning with molecules then moving on to 
cells. I prefer to start with cells to give you a sense of context, an idea of where 
everything is happening, and then move on to the molecules.
Whatever your circumstance, the Table of Contents and Index can help you 
find the information you need. Best wishes from me to you as you begin your 
journey into the marvelous world of the cell.

olecular and cellular biology looks at life on the 
smallest level, from the microscopic cells that 
make up living things to the mysterious molecules within 
those cells that contain the programming for how life 
functions. Cells are the smallest living things and they 
have all the properties of life, including reproduction, 
response to environmental signals, a need for energy, and 
the release of waste products.
Viruses are very small parasites of cells that have the abil-
ity to attack cells and convert them into factories for viral 
reproduction. In this part, I explain the science of molecu-
lar and cellular biology and present the basic structure 
and function of cells and viruses.

olecular and cellular biology is about studying cell structure and func-
tion down to the level of the individual molecules that make up the 
cell. The most famous molecule in cells is DNA, and much of molecular biol-
ogy focuses on this molecule — reading DNA, working with DNA, and under-
standing how cells use DNA.
In this chapter, I present an overview of molecular and cellular biology and 
how it relates to your life. My goal is to illustrate the importance of molecular 
and cellular biology and to give you a preview of the topics I explore in more 
depth in the later chapters of this book.
Cells and Viruses: Discovering the 
Inhabitants of the Microscopic World
If you were alive just 400 years ago, you would’ve had no idea that germs can 
spread diseases, that your blood contains cells that carry oxygen around 
your body, or that new people are made when sperm cells join with egg cells. 
Four hundred years ago, no one had any idea that there was an entire world 
just beyond the power of the human eye. A Dutch cloth merchant named 
Antony van Leeuwenhoek changed all that when he used small, hand-held 
microscopes to peer beyond the known world into the world of the cell.

10
Part I: The World of the Cell 
In 1676, van Leeuwenhoek used his microscopes to look into a drop of lake 
water — water that appeared clear to his eyes — and was astounded to see 
tiny creatures swimming around in it. van Leeuwenhoek was the first to see 
bacteria, blood cells, and sperm cells fertilizing an egg. Along with Robert 
Hooke, who observed the first plant cells, van Leeuwenhoek laid the founda-
tion for the development of cell biology and microbiology and began new 
chapters in the sciences of anatomy, physiology, botany, and zoology.
You: On the cellular level
Imagine your eyes have super powers, and you’re staring at your own skin, 
revealing a patchwork of thin, flaky cells. These skin cells are just one type of 
more than 200 types of cells found in your body — cells that make up your tis-
sues, organs, and organ systems (see Figure 1-1). Increase the power of your 
eyes, and you can zoom in on your chromosomes, which are made of DNA (see 
Chapter 7) and contain the instructions for your traits (see Chapter 15).

 Chapter 1: Exploring the World of the Cell
Them: Bacteria and viruses
If you looked at your body with super-powered eyes, your cells aren’t the 
only cells you’d see. All over your body and, in fact, everywhere on Earth you 
look, you can see another type of cell — the prokaryotic cell (see Chapter 2). 
Prokaryotic cells come in two types:
 
✓ Bacteria are probably most familiar to you because they can make you 
sick, but bacteria do many good things, too. The bacteria that live all 
over your body actually help keep you from getting sick, and many of 
the foods you eat, such as yogurt, owe their flavors to bacteria.
 
✓ Archaea are just as common as bacteria but are usually less familiar 
to people because they aren’t known for causing human disease, and 
they’re still being studied by scientists. On a microscope (or with super-
powered eyes), archaea look just like bacteria, so scientists didn’t real-
ize archaea existed until around 40 years ago when improvements in 
molecular biology made their discovery possible.
Your super-powered eyes could also show you another type of alien creature, 
even smaller than the cells of bacteria and archaea — viruses (see Chapter 3). 
Viruses really are like little alien ships that land on your cells and take them 
over, enslaving the molecules within your cells and making them work to 
build more viruses. Your cells don’t work for you anymore, and you feel 
the effects — your throat gets sore, your nose runs, or you ache all over. 
Fortunately, your immune system comes to the rescue, sending in white 
blood cells to fight off the invading viruses.
 
Because bacteria and viruses both make people sick, they often get confused — 
even in the news media! However, bacteria and viruses have very different 
structures — bacteria are cells, and viruses are not — which makes a big dif-
ference when it comes to medicine. Antibiotics target bacterial cells, and they 
don’t work on viruses!
Speaking the language of cells
If you want to learn about cells, you need to 
speak their chemical chemistry. Cells are made 
of molecules, they communicate through mol-
ecules, and they respond to signals by chang-
ing existing molecules or making new ones. The 
DNA code (see Chapter 7), written in the chemi-
cal letters A, T, C, and G, is used by your body 
to create cellular workers like proteins (see 
Chapter 6) that control how your cells function. 
DNA and proteins, along with carbohydrates 
(see Chapter 5) and lipids (see Chapter 8), are 
the fundamental building blocks that make up 
your cells and thus your entire body.

12
Part I: The World of the Cell 
The Life of a Cell: How Cells Get What 
They Need to Survive and Reproduce
Your cells are the smallest piece of you that is alive. All the things that you 
can think of that you need to do to keep your body alive — get energy from 
food, take in oxygen, and release wastes — are also true for your cells:
 
✓ When you eat food, you take in a source of energy and matter for your 
cells that you process with your cellular metabolism (see Chapter 10).
 
✓ Your cells do cellular respiration (see Chapter 11), using oxygen to 
transfer energy out of food into a form that they can use to do work.
 
✓ Cells can also use the energy and molecules from food to grow and make 
new cells (see Chapter 13).
Ultimately, you can trace all the food that you eat back to cells, like those of 
plants, that make food through photosynthesis (see Chapter 12). In fact, life 
on Earth couldn’t even exist without the organisms that make food, because 
they capture the energy and matter that all cells need to survive.
Sexual Reproduction: Shuffling the 
Genetic Deck for the Next Generation
You began life as a single cell, when a sperm cell from your dad combined 
with an egg cell from your mom. Your parents made these special reproduc-
tive cells through a special type of cell division called meiosis (see Chapter 14). 
Each cell from your parents donated half of your genetic information — 23 
chromosomes from Mom and 23 from Dad — for a total of 46 chromosomes 
in each of your cells. What you look like and much of how you behave is a 
result of the interaction between the genes you got from Mom and the genes 
you got from Dad.
Tracking the inheritance of genes and how they interact to determine traits 
is part of the science of genetics (see Chapters 15 and 16). Through genet-
ics, you can understand things like why your eyes are a certain color or why 
some traits seem to run in families.

13
 Chapter 1: Exploring the World of the Cell
DNA to Protein: Following the 
Instructions in the Genetic Code
The instructions for your traits, from the level of the cell to the level of the 
whole you, are encoded in your DNA. Whenever your cells divide to make 
new cells, they must copy your DNA through DNA replication (see Chapter 17) 
so that each new cell gets a set of instructions. The working cells of your 
body are constantly reading the DNA code and using the instructions to build 
molecules, such as proteins, that they need to do their jobs for the body. 
Proteins are constructed by the combined efforts of two processes, called 
transcription and translation (see Chapter 18).
Signals, such as hormones, can tell your working cells that they need to 
change their behavior. To change their behavior, your cells may need to 
change their tools. Gene regulation (see Chapter 19) allows your cells to turn 
off some genes for proteins and turn others on. In fact, how your cells use 
your DNA is just as important as what your code actually says!
DNA Technology: Tackling the 
World’s Problems
You’ve probably heard a lot about the impacts of biotechnology — geneti-
cally modified organisms (GMOs), DNA fingerprinting, the Human Genome 
Project, and gene therapy are just some of the topics that regularly appear in 
the news.
A revolution in biology has occurred over the past 50 years or so, a revolu-
tion based on scientists’ ability to read and manipulate the genetic code of 
life. Scientists can extract, snip, copy, read, modify, and place DNA from cells 
into different cells using recombinant DNA technology (see Chapter 20). New 
technologies developed in the last 20 years allow scientists to read the entire 
genetic code, or genome, of organisms (see Chapter 21), essentially opening 
up the book of life for everyone to read.
New branches of biology are growing to study all this new information and 
present many opportunities for future careers:

14
Part I: The World of the Cell 
 
✓ Bioinformatics is a science that blends computing, biology, and informa-
tion technology to organize and analyze the large amounts of informa-
tion that are being generated by biologists all around the world.
 
✓ Genomics is the study of entire genomes of organisms. By studying all of 
the DNA sequence of a cell, scientists are discovering new proteins and 
new understandings of how DNA is regulated in cells.
 
✓ Proteomics is the study of the entire body of proteins in a cell and how 
they interact with each other. The types of proteins found in different 
cells are compared in order to look for patterns common to certain cell 
types.
Molecular biology has spread throughout the older branches of biology as 
well. Botany, zoology, ecology, physiology — every “ology” you can think of, 
really — now has a molecular component. Living things are studied down to 
the level of the cell and the molecules, such as DNA and proteins, that make 
up the cell.
Even medicine is becoming increasingly molecular — Departments of 
Molecular Medicine are popping up all over — as doctors and scientists seek 
to understand and treat disease at the level of the cell and molecule. Designer 
drugs that specifically target the molecular defect of a particular disease are 
already in the works.
Molecular and cellular biology already impacts your life in many ways and 
will almost certainly become more important in your future.

Chapter 2
Take a Tour Inside the Cell
In This Chapter
▶ Comparing life on Earth
▶ Exploring the eukaryotic cells of plants, animals, and fungi
▶ Getting to know bacteria and other prokaryotic cells
A
ll living things are made of cells. All cells are built out of the same mate-
rials and function in similar ways, showing the relationship of all life on 
Earth. Eukaryotic cells, such as those of plants and animals, are structurally 
complex. Prokaryotic cells, such as those of bacteria, have a simpler organi-
zation. In this chapter, I present cell structures and their functions for both 
eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells.
Admiring the Unity and 
Diversity of Cells
The unity among cells on Earth is truly amazing. All cells have DNA as the 
genetic material, use the same processes to make proteins, and follow the 
same basic metabolic principles as other cells. So, on the most fundamental 
level, cells on Earth show their unity and their relationship to each other.
Beyond the fundamentals, however, cells have fantastic variations. Cells 
differ in size, from the neurons of giant squid to tiny bacteria. They differ in 
function, from free-living amoebae to muscle cells in an animal to sperm cells 
inside the pollen grain of a plant. Cells also differ in their role in the environ-
ment, from food makers to predators to decomposers that eat the dead.

16
Part I: The World of the Cell 
Based on their basic chemistry, structure, and hereditary material, all cells 
on Earth fall into one of three groups, as if the family tree of life on Earth split 
into three main branches, called domains:
 
✓ Eucarya: Plants, animals, fungi, and protists
 
✓ Bacteria: Familiar, single-celled microorganisms, some of which are 
useful to humans and some of which cause human diseases
 
✓ Archaea: Single-celled microorganisms found in all types of environ-
ments, but first discovered in extreme environments, such as hot 
springs
Cells of the Eucarya are structurally distinct from cells of the Bacteria and 
the Archaea. Cells of Eukarya are eukaryotic, while cells of the Bacteria and 
Archaea are prokaryotic.
 
✓ Eukaryotic cells have a nucleus, a chamber within the cell that is sepa-
rated by a membrane and contains the DNA. They also have organelles, 
membrane-enclosed structures inside the cell that perform various func-
tions for the cell. Finally, eukaryotic cells are typically much larger than 
prokaryotic cells, on average about ten times larger. (For more on these 
cells, see the section “Your Body, Your Cells: Eukaryotic Cells,” later in 
this chapter.)
 
✓ Prokaryotic cells don’t have a nucleus; their DNA is contained within 
the cytoplasm of the cell. They also don’t have any membrane-enclosed 
organelles, and they’re typically much smaller than eukaryotic cells. 
(See the upcoming section “Tiny but Mighty: Prokaryotic Cells” for more 
on prokaryotic cells.)
 
The root eu means true and karyon means seed, so eukaryotic cells are true-
seeded cells because the nucleus looks a little bit like a seed inside the cell. 
On the other hand, pro means before, so prokaryotes are before seed cells 
because they don’t have a nucleus.
Finding Common Ground: 
Structures in All Cells
Every living thing on Earth, including animals, plants, bacteria, yeast, and 
mold, is made of cells. Some living things, such as animals and plants, are 
multicellular; their bodies are made of many cells. Other living things, such as 
bacteria and yeast, are unicellular — made of just one cell. But whether a cell 
is one of many or the only one making up a living thing, all cells have certain 
things in common:

17
 Chapter 2: Take a Tour Inside the Cell
 
✓ Just like you have skin that covers your body, all cells have a boundary 
that separates them from their environment. The boundary of a cell is 
called the plasma membrane (or cytoplasmic membrane).
 
✓ The area inside all cells is called the cytoplasm.
 
✓ All cells contain deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which contains the plans 
for how the cell is built and how it functions.
 
✓ All cells make proteins to help them function. Proteins are built on struc-
tures called ribosomes, so all cells have ribosomes.
The following sections describe these four items.
Customs: Plasma membrane
The plasma membrane, shown in Figure 2-1, separates the cell from its envi-
ronment and is selectively permeable, which means it chooses what enters 
and exits the cell. You can think of the plasma membrane as an international 
boundary where customs officers inspect the traffic and determine what is 
allowed to cross back and forth. The molecules that act like customs officers 
are proteins. Proteins called receptors detect signals from the environment 
of the cell, and transport proteins help some molecules get across the mem-
brane. (For more details on how molecules cross the plasma membrane, see 
Chapter 9.)

Part I: The World of the Cell 
The plasma membrane is made up of two layers of phospholipids along with 
proteins, sterols, and carbohydrates:
 
✓ Phospholipids are molecules that are similar in structure to fat mol-
ecules. Like fat molecules, part of the phospholipids — the hydrophobic 
tails — doesn’t mix well with water. Phospholipids also have a hydro-
philic head that is attracted to water. Phospholipids make up almost 50 
percent of the plasma membrane.
 
✓ Proteins are stuck in the membrane and associated with the edges of 
the membrane. Proteins make up almost 50 percent of the plasma 
membrane.
 
✓ Sterols are also embedded in plasma membranes. The type of sterol 
depends on the type of cell. Animal cells have cholesterol in their 
plasma membranes. Sterols are present in small amounts in the plasma 
membrane.
 
✓ Carbohydrates are attached to receptors on the outside of the plasma 
membrane. They’re present in small amounts in the plasma membrane.
The components of the plasma membrane are organized into a phospholipid 
bilayer. Because the hydrophobic tails of the phospholipids don’t mix well in 
water, the two layers of phospholipids make a “fat sandwich” with their two 
rows of hydrophilic heads pointed toward the water and the hydrophobic 
tails sandwiched between them and away from the water. Transport proteins 
and sterols are embedded within the phospholipid bilayer, and carbohy-
drates are attached to receptors on the outside of the cell.
 
The structure and behavior of the plasma membrane are described by a 
theory called the fluid mosaic model of the plasma membrane, which basically 
says that membranes are made of several components and that these compo-
nents can move within the membrane.
The phospholipids and proteins move back and forth within the plasma 
membrane, making the plasma membrane a fluid structure. Thus, the plasma 
membrane is flexible and able to fuse with other membranes. For example, 
small membranes may carry proteins up to the surface of the cell so that the 
protein can leave the cell. The membranes carrying the proteins simply melt 
into the plasma membrane, just like two soap bubbles merge with each other.
A happenin’ place: The cytoplasm
The fluid-filled interior of the cell is called the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm is 
filled with molecules, structures, and activity, like a crowded party packed 

19
 Chapter 2: Take a Tour Inside the Cell
with people and conversations. Many of the chemical reactions that make 
up the metabolism of the cell happen in the cytoplasm, including important 
reactions that build proteins. Molecules and cellular components, includ-
ing organelles, are constantly moving around in cells, being transported 
from one place to another or just moving randomly around due to their own 
kinetic energy (energy of motion) and attraction to other molecules.
The library: DNA-containing region
All cells contain DNA as their genetic material. (For more on DNA, see 
Chapter 7.) However, the location of the DNA is different in the two structural 
types of cells:
 
✓ In eukaryotic cells, the DNA is separated from the cytoplasm by mem-
branes inside the cell, forming a structure called the nucleus. (For more 
information on the nucleus, see the section “Home office: The nucleus,” 
later in this chapter.)
 
✓ In prokaryotic cells, the DNA is located within the cytoplasm in a region 
of the cell called the nucleoid.
Workbenches: Ribosomes
All cells need to be able to make proteins because proteins are the main 
worker molecules of the cell. Proteins are made on structures called ribo-
somes. All ribosomes have certain things in common:
 
✓ Ribosomes are made of two types of molecules: ribosomal RNA (rRNA) 
and proteins. (For more on rRNA, see Chapter 7.)
 
✓ The molecules that make up ribosomes are twisted together to form two 
components: the large subunit and the small subunit. These subunits 
are built separately from each other and come together to form a com-
pleted ribosome when protein synthesis begins.
 
The ribosomes of prokaryotic cells are different from those of eukaryotic cells. 
Although both types of ribosomes are made of rRNA and protein, the exact 
composition of those molecules is different.

20
Part I: The World of the Cell 
Ribosome size is measured in Svedberg units (S), a unit that describes how 
fast particles fall out of solution during centrifugation. As a centrifuge spins 
things around really fast, larger, more dense particles fall to the bottom of 
the centrifuge tube (“spin out” of solution) faster than smaller, less dense 
particles. So, centrifugation, and Svedberg units, can tell you the relative size 
of particles, such as prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes:
 
✓ Prokaryotic ribosomes are smaller than eukaryotic ribosomes. They’re 
called 70S ribosomes because complete ribosomal spin out at 70S. If 
you spin the ribosomal subunits separately, the large subunit spins 
out at 50S, and the small subunit spins out at 30S. Only in biology does 
50+30=70! This answer is because when the two subunits join together to 
make a completed ribosome, they pack together into a tight package.
 
✓ Eukaryotic ribosomes are larger than prokaryotic ribosomes and spin 
out at 80S. The large subunit alone spins out at 60S, and the small sub-
unit at 40S. More strange biological math: 60+40=80! Again, the two sub-
units pack together to form the complete ribosome.
In eukaryotic cells, ribosomes that are located in different places in the cell 
have slightly different functions:
 
✓ Free ribosomes are located in the cytoplasm of the cell. They make pro-
teins that will function in the cytoplasm of the cell.
 
✓ Membrane-bound ribosomes attach themselves to the membrane of the 
rough endoplasmic reticulum, which is located inside cells. Membrane-
bound ribosomes produce proteins that will either be part of mem-
branes or that will be released from the cell.
Your Body, Your Cells: Eukaryotic Cells
The eukaryotic cells of animals, plants, fungi, and microscopic creatures 
called protists have many similarities in structure and function. They have 
the structures common to all cells: a plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and 
ribosomes.
 
All eukaryotic cells have a nucleus, organelles, and many internal membranes.

With all the wonderful diversity of life on Earth, however, you’re probably 
not surprised to discover that eukaryotic cells have differences, too. By com-
paring the structure of a typical animal cell, shown in Figure 2-2, with that of 
a typical plant cell, shown in Figure 2-3, you can see some of the differences 
among eukaryotic cells.
 
✓ Cell walls, additional reinforcing layers outside the plasma membrane, 
are present in the cells of plants, fungi, and some protists, but not in 
animal cells.
 
✓ Chloroplasts, which are needed for photosynthesis, are found in the cells 
of plants and algae, but not animals.
 
✓ Large, central vacuoles, which contain fluid and are separated from the 
cytoplasm with a membrane, are found in the cells of plants and algae, 
but not animals.
 
✓ Centrioles, small protein structures that appear during cell division, are 
found in the cells of animals, but not plants.

Home office: The nucleus
The nucleus, shown in Figure 2-4, houses and protects the cell’s DNA, which 
contains all of the instructions necessary for the cell to function. The DNA 
is like a set of blueprints for the cell, so you can think of the nucleus as the 
office where the blueprints are kept. If information from the blueprints is 
required, the information is copied into RNA molecules and moved out of the 
nucleus. The DNA plans stay safely locked away.
 
The boundary of the nucleus is the nuclear envelope, which is made of two 
phospholipid bilayers similar to those that make up the plasma membrane.

23
 Chapter 2: Take a Tour Inside the Cell
 
Figure 2-4: 
The 
nucleus.
 
The phospholipids bilayers of the nuclear envelope are supported by a scaf-
fold of protein cables, called the nuclear lamina, on the inner surface of the 
nucleus. The nuclear envelope separates the contents of the nucleus from 
the cytoplasm. The structures within the nucleus are
 
✓ DNA in the form of chromosomes or chromatin: When a cell is about to 
divide to make a copy of itself, it copies its DNA and bundles the DNA up 
tightly so that the cell can move the DNA around more easily. The tightly 
bundled DNA molecules are visible through a microscope as little struc-
tures in the nucleus called chromosomes. Most of the time, however, 
when a cell is just functioning and not about to divide, the DNA is very 
loose within the nucleus, like a bunch of long spaghetti noodles. When 
the DNA is in this form, it is called chromatin.
 
✓ Nucleoli where ribosomal subunits are made: Information in the DNA 
needs to be read in order to make the small and large subunits needed 
to build ribosomes. The cell builds the ribosomal subunits in areas of 
the nucleus called nucleoli. Then, the cell ships the subunits out of the 
nucleus to the cytoplasm, where they join together for protein synthe-
sis. When you stain cells and look at them under the microscope, nucle-
oli look like large spots within the nucleus.
The DNA plans for the cell are kept in the nucleus, but most of the activity of 
the cell occurs in the cytoplasm. Because the DNA is separate from the rest 
of the cell, a lot of traffic crosses back and forth between the nucleus and the 
cytoplasm. Molecules enter and exit the nucleus through small holes, called 
nuclear pores, that pass through the nuclear membrane. Nuclear pores are 

24
Part I: The World of the Cell 
made by groups of proteins organized into little rings that penetrate through 
the nuclear envelope. The traffic in and out of the nuclear pores include the 
following:
 
✓ RNA molecules and ribosomal subunits that are made in the nucleus 
must exit to the cytoplasm.
 
✓ Proteins that are made in the cytoplasm but needed for certain pro-
cesses, such as copying the DNA, must cross into the nucleus.
 
✓ Nucleotides, building blocks for DNA and RNA, must cross into the 
nucleus so that the cell can make new DNA and RNA molecules.
 
Traffic through the nuclear pores is controlled by proteins called importins 
and exportins. Proteins that are to be moved into or out of the nucleus have 
specific chemical tags on them that act like zip codes, telling the importins 
and exportins which way to move the protein with the tag. The movement of 
molecules into and out of the cell requires the input of energy from the cell in 
the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) — see Chapter 10.
Post office: The endomembrane system
The endomembrane system, shown in Figure 2-5, of the eukaryotic cell con-
structs proteins and lipids and then ships them where they need to go. 
Because this system is like a large package-shipping company, you can think 
of it as the post office of the cell.
The endomembrane system has several components:
 
✓ The endoplasmic reticulum is a set of folded membranes that begins at 
the nucleus and extends into the cytoplasm. It begins with the outer 
membrane of the nuclear envelope and then twists back and forth like 
switchbacks on a steep mountain trail. The endoplasmic reticulum 
comes in two types:
 
• Rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) is called rough because it’s stud-
ded with ribosomes. Ribosomes that begin to make a protein that 
has a special destination, such as a particular organelle or mem-
brane, will attach themselves to the rough endoplasmic reticulum 
while they make the protein. As the protein is made, it’s pushed into 
the middle of the rough ER, which is called the lumen. Once inside 
the lumen, the protein is folded and tagged with carbohydrates. It 
will then travel to the Golgi apparatus for further processing.
 
• Smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) does not have any attached 
ribosomes. It makes lipids — for example, phospholipids for cell 
membranes.

✓ The Golgi apparatus is a stack of flattened membrane sacs that looks 
a little bit like a stack of pancakes. The side of the stack closest to the 
nucleus is called the cis face of the Golgi, while the stack farthest from 
the nucleus is called the trans face. When proteins arrive at the cis 
face of the Golgi, they’re pushed into the middle of the lumen. Inside 
the lumen, the proteins are modified — for example, by the addition 
of sugars — marked with chemical tags, and sorted so that they’ll get 
shipped to their proper destination.
 
✓ Vesicles are little bubbles of membrane in the cell and come in several 
types:
 
• Transport vesicles carry molecules around the cell. They’re like the 
large envelopes that you put your letters in. Transport vesicles 
travel from the ER to the Golgi and then to the plasma membrane 
to bring molecules where they need to go. They travel by gliding 
along protein cables that are part of the cytoskeleton. (For more 
information on the cytoskeleton, see the section “Scaffolding and 
railroad tracks: The cytoskeleton,” later in this chapter.)

26
Part I: The World of the Cell 
 
• Lysosomes are the garbage disposals of the cell. They contain 
digestive enzymes that can break down molecules, organelles, and 
even bacterial cells.
 
• Secretory vesicles bring materials to the plasma membrane so that 
the cell can release, or secrete, the materials.
 
✓ Peroxisomes are small organelles encircled by a single membrane. Often, 
they help break down lipids, such as fatty acids. Also, depending on 
the type of cell they are in, peroxisomes may be specialists in break-
ing down particular molecules. For example, peroxisomes in liver cells 
break down toxins, such as the ethanol from alcoholic beverages. In 
plants cells, glyoxisomes, a special kind of peroxisome, help convert 
stored oils into molecules that plants can easily use for energy.
 
All together, the endomembrane system works as a sophisticated manufactur-
ing, processing, and shipping plant. This system is particularly important in 
specialized cells that make lots of a particular protein and then ship them out 
to other cells. These types of cells actually have more endoplasmic reticulum 
than other cells so that they can efficiently produce and export large amounts 
of protein.
As an example of how the endomembrane system functions, follow the path-
way of synthesis and transport for an exported protein:
 
1. A ribosome begins to build a protein, such as insulin, that will be 
exported from the cell.
 
 At the beginning of the protein is a recognizable marker that causes the 
ribosome to dock at the surface of the rough endoplasmic reticulum.
 
2. The ribosome continues to make the protein, and the protein is 
pushed into the lumen of the RER.
 
 Inside the lumen, the protein folds up, and carbohydrates are attached 
to it.
 
3. The protein is pushed into the membrane of the RER, which pinches 
around and seals to form a vesicle, and the vesicle carries the protein 
from the RER to the Golgi.
 
4. The vesicle fuses with the cis face of the Golgi apparatus, and the 
protein is delivered to the lumen of the Golgi, where the protein is 
modified.
 
5. The protein eventually leaves in a vesicle formed at the trans face, 
which travels to the plasma membrane, fuses with the membrane, and 
releases the protein to the outside of the cell.

 Chapter 2: Take a Tour Inside the Cell
The fireplace: Mitochondria
The mitochondrion (see Figure 2-6) is the organelle where eukaryotes burn 
their food by cellular respiration (see Chapter 11).
 
Mitochondria are like the power plants of the cell because they transfer 
energy from food to ATP. ATP is an easy form of energy for cells to use, so 
mitochondria help cells get energy.
 
Figure 2-6: 
The mito-
chondrion.
 
Outer membrane
Matrix
Mitochondrial DNA
Inner membrane
Part of the process that extracts the energy from food requires a membrane, 
so mitochondria have lots of internal folded membrane to give them more 
area to run this process. Mitochondria actually have two membranes, the 
outer membrane and the inner membrane. The inner membrane is the one 
that is folded back and forth to create more area for energy extraction; the 
folds of this membrane are called cristae. The outer membrane separates the 
interior of the mitochondrion from the cytoplasm of the cell.
The two membranes of the mitochondrion create different compartments 
within the mitochondrion:
 
✓ The space between the two membranes of the mitochondrion is the 
intermembrane space.
 
✓ The inside of the mitochondrion is the matrix.

28
Part I: The World of the Cell 
 
Mitochondria also contain ribosomes for protein synthesis and a small, circu-
lar piece of DNA that contains the code for some mitochondrial proteins.
In the kitchen: Chloroplasts
Chloroplasts, shown in Figure 2-7, are the place where eukaryotes make food 
molecules by the process of photosynthesis (see Chapter 12). Chloroplasts 
are found in the cells of plants and algae.

Like mitochondria, choloroplasts have two membranes, an inner membrane 
and an outer membrane. In addition, they have little sacs of membranes 
called thylakoids stacked up in towers called grana.
The multiple membranes of the chloroplast divide it into several different 
spaces:
 
✓ The intermembrane space is between the inner and outer membranes.
 
✓ The central, fluid-filled part of the chloroplast is called the stroma.
 
✓ The interior of the thylakoid is another fluid-filled space.

29
 Chapter 2: Take a Tour Inside the Cell
 
Like mitochondria, chloroplasts contain their own ribosomes for protein syn-
thesis and a small, circular piece of DNA that contains the code for some chlo-
roplast proteins.
Scaffolding and railroad tracks: 
The cytoskeleton
The structure and function of cells are supported by a network of protein 
cables called the cytoskeleton, shown in Figure 2-8. These proteins underlie 
membranes, giving them shape and support, much like scaffolding can 
Where do little organelles come from?
Almost since people first peered at eukary-
otic cells under a microscope, they’ve been 
wondering about the little structures they saw 
inside the cells. What were they? Where did 
they come from? Some people thought these 
structures looked like little bacteria living inside 
of the eukaryotic cells. They wondered if cells 
living inside of other cells, which is a type of 
symbiosis, had led to the formation of these 
organelles.
In the early 1900s, a French scientist named 
Portier proposed that mitochondria were the 
descendants of symbiotic bacteria. Around 
the same time, a Russian scientist named 
Mereschovsky proposed that chloroplasts had 
a similar origin. Both of these scientists based 
their ideas on a comparison of the physical 
appearance of the organelles to that of bacte-
ria. Their ideas fell by the scientific wayside until 
the 1960s, when an American scientist named 
Lynn Margulis brought them back and unified 
them into the serial endosymbiotic theory of 
the origin of the eukaryotic cell. She proposed 
that symbiosis was very important in the origin 
of the eukaryotic cell and that it had led to the 
development of cell structures, including the 
mitochondrion and chloroplast.
Dr. Margulis’s ideas were considered radi-
cal, and many scientists disagreed. However, 
as the science of molecular and cell biology 
advanced and new tools were developed, Dr. 
Margulis had the last word! The presence of 
ribosomes and DNA within the mitochondria 
and chloroplasts suggested that they may 
have once been free-living cells. And when 
the ribosomes of chloroplasts and mitochon-
dria were examined, they were found to be 
prokaryotic ribosomes like those of bacteria 
rather than eukaryotic ribosomes like those in 
the cytoplasm of the cell. Likewise, when DNA 
sequences from chloroplasts and mitochondria 
were read and compared to those of bacteria 
and the DNA from the eukaryotic nucleus, the 
organelles again proved to be closer cousins to 
the bacteria than they were to the nuclei of the 
cells in which they lived. These data have led 
biologists today to agree that chloroplasts and 
mitochondria actually belong on the bacterial 
family tree!
In other words, a long time ago, bacteria lived 
inside the ancestor of the eukaryotic cell. Over 
time, these bacteria changed slightly and 
became the mitochondria and chloroplasts sci-
entists know today.

support a building. Cytoskeletal proteins run like tracks through cells, 
enabling the movement of vesicles and organelles like trains on a railroad 
track. When cells swim by flicking whip-like extensions called cilia and 
eukaryotic flagella, they’re using cytoskeletal proteins. In fact, you use 
cytoskeletal proteins literally every time you move a muscle.

eton.

Microtubules
Mitochondrion
Cytoskeletal proteins come in three main types, with each one playing a dif-
ferent role in cells:
 
✓ Microfilaments are made of the protein actin. Microfilaments are the 
proteins that make muscle cells contract, help pinch animal cells in two 
during cell division, allow cells like amoebae to crawl, and act as rail-
road tracks for organelles in some types of cells.
 
✓ Microtubules are made of the protein tubulin. Microtubules are the pro-
teins inside of cilia and flagella. They move chromosomes during cell 
division and act as railroad tracks for the movement of vesicles and 
some organelles.
 
✓ Intermediate filaments are made of various proteins. They often act as 
reinforcing proteins. For example, the protein lamin that strengthens the 
nuclear membrane is an intermediate filament. Likewise, the keratin that 
strengthens your skin cells and makes them resistant to damage is an 
intermediate filament.

31
 Chapter 2: Take a Tour Inside the Cell
 
You can easily mix up the words “microtubules” and “microfilaments.” 
Remember that “microtubules” are made of “tubul-in,” and they’re found in 
the “tube-shaped” cilia and flagella. (Okay, I’m stretching it on that last bit, but 
if it helps to remember it. . . .)
Motor proteins
Actin microfilaments and microtubules are long, cable-like proteins. They 
partner with motor proteins, proteins that use ATP to “walk” along the 
cables by repeatedly binding, changing shape, and releasing. Thus, the motor 
proteins use chemical energy to do cellular work in the form of movement. 
Several motor proteins work with microfilaments and microtubules:
 
✓ Myosin often acts as a partner to actin. For example, when myosin walks 
along actin microfilaments in muscle cells, it causes the actin microfila-
ment to slide. The sliding of actin microfilaments is what causes muscle 
contraction. Myosin also attaches to cellular components, such as 
chloroplasts in plant cells, and then walks along microfilaments. The 
movement of the motor proteins causes the cellular components to flow 
around the cell in a process called cytoplasmic streaming.
 
✓ Dynein partners with microtubules inside of cilia and eukaryotic flagella. 
When dynein walks along microtubules on one side of a cilium or flagel-
lum, it causes the microtubules to bend. The bending of different parts 
of cilia and flagella makes them flick back and forth like little whips.
 
✓ Kinesin is another partner with microtubules. One end of the kinesin 
molecule attaches to vesicles, while the other end walks along the 
microtubules. The movement of kinesin causes the vesicles to slide 
along the microtubules like freight cars on a railroad track.
Cilia and flagella
Cilia and flagella are essentially the same structure, but cilia are typically 
shorter and more numerous on the surface of the cell whereas flagella are 
typically longer in length and fewer in number. Cilia are found on cells that 
make up the surfaces of tissues, such as cells in the respiratory and genital 
tracts of humans, where the cilia beat to move fluid and materials along the 
surface. For example, in the human respiratory tract, the beating of cilia 
moves mucus upward where you can cough it out of the body. Some cells, 
such as microscopic protists and sperm cells, swim using cilia and flagella.
The internal structure of cilia and flagella is distinctive. If you cut a cilium 
or a flagellum crosswise and look at the circular end with an electron micro-
scope, you’ll see the same pattern of microtubules in in both cilia and fla-
gella. The microtubules are grouped in pairs, called doublets, that are similar 
to two drinking straws laid tightly together side by side.

32
Part I: The World of the Cell 
 
The microtubules appear in a 9+2 arrangement, where nine pairs of microtu-
bules (nine doublets) are arranged around the outside of the circle, while one 
pair of microtubules is in the center of the circle.
Rebar and concrete: Cell walls and 
extracellular matrices
The plasma membrane is the selective boundary for all cells that chooses 
what enters and exits the cell. However, most cells have additional layers 
outside of the plasma membrane. These extracellular layers provide addi-
tional strength to cells and may attach cells to neighboring cells in multi-
cellular organisms. Typically, these layers are composed of long cables of 
carbohydrates or proteins embedded in a sticky matrix. The long, cable-like 
molecules work like rebar in concrete to create a strong substance. Two main 
types of extracellular layers support eukaryotic cells:
 
✓ Cell walls are extra reinforcing layers that help protect the cell from 
bursting. Among eukaryotes, cell walls appear around the cells of plants, 
fungi, and many protists.
 
• The cell walls of plants and algae are made of cellulose. If the plant 
is a woody plant, lignin is also present.
 
• Fungal cell walls are made of chitin.
 
✓ The layer around animal cells is the extracellular matrix (ECM), shown in 
Figure 2-9. This layer is made of long proteins, such as collagen, embed-
ded in a polysaccharide gel. The ECM supports animal cells and helps 
Your cilia are smoked, dude
Smoking cigarettes paralyzes the cilia on the 
cells that make up the surface of your respira-
tory tract. The job of those cilia is to beat like 
little whips, moving mucus upward where you 
can cough it out. Mucus is the sticky, gooey 
stuff that traps dust, pollen, and germs when 
you breathe them in. So, when a smoker para-
lyzes their cilia, they stop the ciliary escalator 
that was moving all that junk out of their body. 
The junk stays in their lungs and makes them 
more susceptible to colds and other diseases. 
Also, poisons from the cigarette smoke stay 
in their lungs and combine to form tar. When 
smokers sleep (and thus aren’t smoking), some 
of their cilia recover. So, first thing in the morn-
ing, those cilia try to do their job again. The 
result is the deep hack of a smoker’s cough as 
they try to clear the junk out of their lungs.

bind them together. Animal cells actually attach themselves to the ECM 
via proteins, called integrins, that are embedded in the plasma mem-
brane. The integrins bind to the actin microfilaments inside the cell and 
to ECM proteins called fibronectins that are outside the cell.

Tiny but Mighty: Prokaryotic Cells
Prokaryotic cells are smaller than eukaryotic cells, and, at first glance at 
least, they appear simpler in structure. However, prokaryotic cells have 
many structures in common with eukaryotic cells, including a plasma mem-
brane and DNA-containing region, as well as unique structures that perform 
similar functions as those in eukaryotic cells.
As a group, prokaryotes are very successful — they live in every environ-
ment on Earth, from the saltiest seas to the hottest hot springs to dark caves 
without any light, to the intestinal tracts of animals, including yours. Most of 
what people know regarding prokaryotic cell structure (see Figure 2-10) was 
learned by studying bacteria, so that is what I emphasize in this section.

Castle walls: The cell wall
Almost all prokaryotic cells have a cell wall outside the plasma membrane. 
As in eukaryotes, the cell wall reinforces the cell and protects it from burst-
ing. Several types of cell walls support prokaryotic cells, but the biggest dif-
ference is between the walls of bacteria and archaeans:
 
✓ In bacteria, the cell wall is made of the carbohydrate-protein complex 
peptidoglycan.
 
✓ Some archaeans have cell walls, and some do not. Archaeans don’t have 
peptidoglycan in their cell walls.
Taking aim on bacterial infections
You have a raging bacterial infection, so your 
doctor prescribes some antibiotics to help you 
fight it off. Antibiotics are chemicals that kill 
bacteria. But wait — bacteria are cells, right? 
And your body is made of cells, too, right? So, 
why is it safe to take an antibiotic? The secret 
lies in the target of the antibiotic — the drug 
has to target something that bacterial cells 
have, but your cells don’t. That way, you kill 
them without hurting yourself.
Peptidoglycan is one such target. It’s present 
in the cell walls of bacterial cells, but your cells 
don’t make it. (Your cells don’t even have cell 
walls.) All the drugs that end in -cillin, such as 
penicillin, amoxicillin, and methicillin, target 
peptidoglycan and thus cause the death of bac-
terial cells. Your immune system gets a helping 
hand, and you feel better!

35
 Chapter 2: Take a Tour Inside the Cell
Ooze, slime, and grappling hooks: 
Capsules, pili, and fimbriae
Many bacteria produce an additional layer called a capsule outside the cell 
wall. This sticky layer is composed of proteins and carbohydrates that help 
bacterial cells attach to surfaces and to other cells. The capsule also helps 
bacterial cells avoid capture by certain cells of the human immune system.
In addition, some bacteria attach to surfaces and to other cells by slender 
protein threads called pili and fimbriae. For bacteria that cause disease, 
attachment to the human body is the first step in disease. So, for some bacte-
ria, pili and fimbriae are essential to the disease-causing process.
Outboard motors: Bacterial flagella
Many bacteria swim via bacterial flagella. Bacterial flagella are filaments of 
a protein called flagellin. They’re attached to a wheel-like structure in the 
cell wall of bacterial cells. When the wheel rotates, the bacterial flagella spin 
and cause the bacterial cell to move forward, much like an outboard motor 
causes a boat to move. Bacterial cells can have anywhere from one to many 
flagella.
 
Bacteria and eukaryotes both have structures called flagella, but they are dif-
ferent in structure. Eukaryotic flagella contain microtubules in a 9+2 arrange-
ment and they move by flexing and beating like little whips. Bacterial flagella 
are made of a protein called flagellin and they move by rotating like outboard 
motors.

iruses are microscopic particles of nucleic acid and protein that attack 
cells and turn them into factories for producing more viral particles. 
Viruses have different shapes and patterns of multiplication within cells, 
and the ones that attack humans cause many significant diseases, including 
measles, polio, influenza and AIDS. In this chapter, I explore the structure of 
viruses and compare the steps of viral multiplication in bacteria and eukary-
otic cells.
Viruses: Hijackers of the Cellular World
Viruses and bacteria make people sick and are both invisible to our eyes. 
As a result, they’re often confused with each other. However, they aren’t 
the same thing at all. Bacteria are made of cells (see Chapter 2) and can live 
freely on their own, obtaining energy from food, reproducing, and respond-
ing to their environment. In contrast, viruses are not cells — they’re tiny, 
cellular hijackers that are stripped down to the most essential parts. They 
attach themselves to cells, slip in, and take over, using the materials and 
structures of the cell to make more viruses. Without a cellular victim, viruses 
can’t do anything. Because they can’t live and reproduce on their own, many 
scientists don’t consider viruses to be truly alive. Some viruses have the abil-
ity to become dormant inside of a host cell. The genetic material of dormant 
viruses may remain in the host cell for long periods of time and is copied as 
the cell reproduces.

Just the basics: The structure of viruses
The simplest viruses have just two components: a nucleic acid core and 
protein capsid. The nucleic acid core, which may be DNA or RNA, contains 
the instructions for taking over cells and making more virions, or viral par-
ticles. The nucleic acid is surrounded by the capsid, a protective protein 
coat shown in Figure 3-1. Each individual protein that makes up the capsid is 
called a capsomere.

All viruses have at least a capsid and a nucleic acid core. The core consists of 
one of four types of nucleic acid:
 
✓ Double-stranded DNA
 
✓ Single-stranded DNA
 
✓ Double-stranded RNA
 
✓ Single-stranded RNA
 
One difference between cells and viruses is that cells contain DNA and RNA. 
However, a single viral particle contains only DNA or RNA. Also, single-
stranded DNA and double-stranded RNA are commonly found in viruses, but 
not in cells.
In addition to the capsid and the core, some viruses have an outer membrane 
layer called an envelope. It’s no coincidence that the envelope of a virus is 
similar to the plasma membrane of a cell (see Chapter 2) — viruses that have 

39
 Chapter 3: Dead or Alive: Viruses
envelopes steal them from their cellular victims as they leave the cell! Viral 
envelopes aren’t exactly the same as plasma membranes because they’ve 
been changed to suit the needs of the virus by the addition of viral proteins. 
Once modified and adopted, the envelope helps the virus enter and exit from 
host cells.
Viruses may also have proteins that stick out of the envelope or off the sur-
face of the capsid. These proteins, called spikes, help the virus attach to host 
cells.
Viruses come in three common shapes:
 
✓ Helical viruses have a capsid that forms a twisting helix around the 
nucleic acid core.
 
✓ Polyhedral viruses have a regular geometric shape. The most complex 
polyhedral viruses are icosahedrons with 20 faces.
 
✓ Complex viruses have separate patches of proteins, often forming unique 
structures or extensions on the virus.
Under the microscope, enveloped viruses appear irregular in shape. 
However, a helical or polyhedral capsid may be located underneath the 
envelope.
Chemical warfare
You’re sick and miserable, so you go see your 
doctor. Your doctor examines you, tells you that 
you have a cold caused by a virus, and advises 
you to go home, get some rest, and drink plenty 
of fluids. The doctor doesn’t give you a prescrip-
tion because antibiotics don’t work on viruses. 
In fact, for most viruses, scientists don’t have 
any effective antiviral drugs. To be safe and 
effective, antibiotics and antiviral drugs must 
attack whatever is making you sick, without 
harming your healthy cells.
When bacteria make you sick, they present 
plenty of targets for chemical attack because 
they have many things your cells don’t — 
cell walls, different ribosomes, and different 
enzymes. Viruses, however, are a completely 
different story. They’re minimalists — stripped-
down attack machines of protein and nucleic 
acid. That’s not much to target! Viruses repro-
duce themselves by using the parts and materi-
als from your cells, and you certainly don’t want 
to target your own cells. So, in order to develop 
antiviral drugs, scientists need to spend a great 
deal of time researching individual viruses in 
order to discover the few unique molecules 
they bring into your cells. So far, scientists have 
managed to develop antiviral drugs for only a 
few highly studied viruses, including the HIV 
virus that causes AIDS, herpes viruses, and the 
influenza virus.

Knock, knock, virus calling: 
How viruses get into cells
Viruses attach to cells when viral proteins successfully bind to receptors on 
the host cell. If the viral protein has the right shape, it will tuck into the cor-
responding shape on the host cell receptor. You can think of viral attachment 
as a virus having the right key to fit into the lock on the host cell. After the 
virus is attached, it may force itself into the cell by digging a hole through a 
cell wall (see Figure 3-2), slip in by fusing its envelope with the membrane of 
the host cell, or trick the cell into bringing it inside.
 
The ability of a virus to infect a host cell depends on a match between pro-
teins on the surface of the virus and receptors on the surface of the host cell.
The type of cells a particular virus can infect is called the host range of the 
virus. Because viruses can infect only cells that they can attach to with their 
proteins, each virus has a very specific range of hosts it can infect. In other 
words, each virus can infect only the host cells for which it has keys. Some 
viruses have a key that works in the lock on many types of cells. These 
viruses have a broad host range. For example, the rabies virus can infect 
humans and many other mammals. On the other hand, some viruses have 
a key that fits into the lock on only a few cells. These viruses have a narrow 
host range. The HIV virus, which infects only certain cells of the human 
immune system, is a good example of a virus with a very narrow host range.
War on a Microcosmic Scale: 
Viruses of Bacteria
Viruses and bacteria can both be the enemy of people, but did you know that 
they can be enemies of each other too? Viruses attack bacterial cells in a 
way that is very similar to the way they attack your cells. Viruses that attack 
bacteria are called bacteriophage or just phage for short. (“Phage” means 
“eat,” so bacteriophage are bacteria eaters.) Bacteriophage attach to bacte-
rial cells, enter the cells, and hijack them, using the materials and structures 
in the cell to make more phage. This series of events that occurs as viruses 
hijack cells is called the multiplication cycle of the virus. (It may also be called 
the replication cycle, or more rarely, the life cycle of the virus.)
Bacteriophage reproduce via two different multiplication cycles (Figure 3-2):

41
 Chapter 3: Dead or Alive: Viruses
 
✓ In the lytic cycle, bacteriophage immediately use the host cell, making 
more phage and destroying the host cell in the process.
 
✓ In the lysogenic cycle, bacteriophage enter a dormant, or resting phase, 
where their genetic material is incorporated into that of the bacterium. 
As the bacterial cell reproduces, it copies the phage DNA along with 
its own. This process creates a population of bacterial cells that are all 
infected with the bacteriophage.
Some bacteriophage attack only in the lytic mode. Other bacteriophage 
can switch between lytic and lysogenic modes and are called temperate 
phage.

Seek and destroy: The lytic cycle
Bacteriophage that attack by the lytic cycle immediately convert the bacte-
rial cell to a virus-producing factory. The steps of the lytic cycle, which are 
shown in Figure 3-2, are as follows:
 
1. Attachment.
 
 Proteins on the surface of the virus attach to receptors on the surface of 
the host cell.
 
2. Penetration.
 
 The genetic material of the virus enters the host cell.
 
3. Biosynthesis.
 
 The virus uses building blocks from the host cell such as nucleotides 
and amino acids to make viral proteins and nucleic acids. ATP from the 
host cell supplies the energy the virus needs to reproduce.
 
4. Maturation.
 
 The parts of the viral particles assemble into new bacteriophage.
 
5. Release.
 
 The new bacteriophage exit the host cell, lysing, or destroying, the cell 
as they leave.
I think I’ll take a little nap: 
The lysogenic cycle
Bacteriophage that enter the lysogenic cycle remain inactive within the 
bacterial cell for a period of time. During their dormant period, their DNA is 
integrated into the DNA of the bacterial cell. A phage that is integrated into 
bacterial DNA is called a prophage. The steps of the lysogenic cycle are as fol-
lows (see Figure 3-2):
 
1. Attachment.
 
 Proteins on the surface of the virus attach to receptors on the surface of 
the host cell.
 
2. Penetration.
 
 The genetic material of the virus enters the host cell.

43
 Chapter 3: Dead or Alive: Viruses
 
3. Recombination.
 
 The phage DNA inserts into the bacterial DNA by recombination.
 
4. Replication.
 
 The bacterial cell multiplies, copying the viral DNA along with its own DNA.
Environmental signals may trigger the phage to return to the lytic mode, at 
which time they’ll remove themselves from the bacterial DNA and become 
active.
I’ve Got a Cold: Viruses of Eukaryotes
For all of recorded history, humans have done a deadly dance with viruses. 
Measles, smallpox, polio, and influenza viruses changed the course of 
human history: Measles and smallpox killed hundreds of thousands of native 
Americans; polio killed and crippled people, including American president 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt; and the 1918 influenza epidemic killed more 
people than were killed during all of World War I.
For most viruses that attack humans, your only defenses are prevention 
and your own immune systems. Antibiotics don’t kill viruses, and scientists 
haven’t discovered many effective antiviral drugs.
Vaccines are little pieces of bacteria or viruses injected into the body to 
give the immune system an education. They work by ramping up your own 
defensive system so that you’re ready to fight the bacteria or virus upon first 
contact, without becoming sick first. However, for some viral diseases no 
vaccines exist, and the only option is to wait uncomfortably for your immune 
system to win the battle.
The enemy of my enemy is my friend
Viruses that attack bacteria may prove to be 
your friend in the search for new ways to fight 
antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Bacteriophage 
attack bacterial cells, not human cells, so 
they have the potential to be very specific 
killers of infecting bacteria. Scientists around 
the world are testing this idea by introducing 
bacteriophage into animals that have been 
infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria. And 
in Eastern Europe, bacteriophage therapy is 
already being used to treat human infections. 
Some day in the not too distant future, your 
“prescription” for a bacterial infection may be 
an injection of virus!

Part I: The World of the Cell 
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
Most people living in the United States don’t 
worry about measles anymore. Before the mea-
sles vaccine became available in 1963, however, 
people — especially parents — had much more 
cause for alarm. Before 1963, approximately 8 
million deaths per year occurred worldwide 
due to measles. When measles is contracted by 
young children, particularly before age 2, it can 
lead to serious complications and a nasty death. 
The development of a vaccine for measles saved 
countless children from an early death. The dra-
matic beneficial effect of measles immunization 
is seen in this figure that shows the effect of 
three major campaigns to get kids in the United 
States vaccinated against measles.
Today, however, some kids in the United States 
are in danger again. Flawed scientific studies 
reported a possible link between the MMR vac-
cine and autism. This information, combined 
with confusion about vaccines, has made some 
parents afraid to get their kids vaccinated. This 
fear persists despite five extensive scientific 
studies that failed to find a link between the 
MMR vaccine and autism.
Most people don’t remember the dangers of 
measles, so the fear of autism looms larger than 
their fear of measles. In a way, vaccines are a 
victim of their own success — they prevent dis-
ease, so people lose their fear of the disease 
and stop vaccinating. The consequences of 
this choice can be severe — notice the rise in 
measles cases in the 1980s when vaccination 
rates fell.
All vaccines have real risks of side effects that 
occur in a small percentage of people who get 
vaccines. In order for a vaccine to be approved, 
however, the risks due to side effects must be 
smaller than the risks of the disease itself. 
When making decisions about yourself and your 
loved ones, you need good information from a 
reliable source so that you can clearly sepa-
rate real risks from rumors. Good information 
on vaccines and their safety is available from 
the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s 
Hospital of Philadelphia. Check it out at www.

 Chapter 3: Dead or Alive: Viruses
 
Both antibiotics and vaccines help you fight against disease. However, they 
work in entirely different ways. Antibiotics are chemicals that poison bacteria 
by attacking structures found in bacterial cells but not the cells of humans. 
Antibiotics don’t work against viruses because viruses don’t have the same 
structures as bacteria. Vaccines work by educating your immune system and 
preparing you in advance to fight a particular bacterium or virus. Vaccines 
work against both bacteria and viruses.
Same story, different players
Viruses that attack eukaryotic cells follow the same basic principles as 
viruses that attack bacterial cells, but some of the terms used are different:
 
✓ Latent instead of lysogenic: Eukaryotic viruses, such as herpes, that can 
have a dormant period within the host cell are called latent viruses.
 
✓ Provirus instead of prophage: A virus that is dormant inside the eukary-
otic cell is called a provirus.
 
✓ Acute disease instead of lytic cycle: For viruses that attack humans, a 
virus that strikes quickly, reproduces rapidly, and causes a rapid but 
relatively short illness is said to cause an acute illness. A good example 
of viruses that causes an acute illness are the viruses that cause the 
common cold.
Despite some differences in terminology, the basic events in the multiplica-
tion cycle are the same for a virus that attack eukaryotic cells as they are for 
a virus that attacks prokaryotic cells: attachment, penetration, biosynthesis, 
maturation, and release. However, viruses of eukaryotes have to navigate 
around the eukaryotic cell, which is structurally more complex than the bac-
terial cell (see Chapter 2). Also, the genetic material of eukaryotic viruses 
is more varied than that of bacterial viruses. As a result, the multiplication 
cycles of viruses that attack eukaryotes are generally more complex than 
those of viruses that attack bacteria.
Come in and take your coat off
Viral attack of a eukaryotic cell begins with the attachment of viral proteins 
to receptors on the host cell (see Figure 3-3). After the virus binds to the host 
cell, it crosses the plasma membrane of the host. The methods by which 
viruses enter the cell are best understood for viruses that have an envelope. 
(See the section “Just the basics: The structure of viruses,” earlier in this 
chapter, for more details on envelopes.)

46
Part I: The World of the Cell 
After an enveloped virus attaches to a host cell, it may enter the cell in one of 
two ways:
 
✓ Fusion occurs when the envelope of the virus melts into the plasma 
membrane of the animal cell. This fusion of membranes is just like two 
soap bubbles merging into one. Once the membranes are fused, the viral 
capsid is inside the host cell.
 
✓ Receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs when binding of the virus to the 
host cell causes the cell to bring the virus inside. The plasma membrane 
of the host cell reaches out, wraps around the virus to form a vesicle, 
and brings the virus inside, envelope and all.
When a virus enters a host cell by fusion or receptor-mediated endocytosis, 
the viral capsid enters the cell. Before the virus can begin to make more of 
itself, it has to free its genetic material from the capsid. In other words, it 
has to take its coat off — which is why the process of removing the capsid 
is called uncoating. Usually, uncoating happens when enzymes from the host 
cell break down the viral capsid, releasing the genetic material of the virus.

tiplication

2. Binding and Fusion: Virus binds to CD4  
 
and coreceptor on host cell and then  
 
fuses with the cell.
3. Penetration: The viral capsid enters the 
cell and releases its contents into the  
 
cytoplasm.
4. Reverse Transcription: The enzyme  
 
reverse transcriptase converts the  
 
single-stranded viral RNA molecules into 
double-stranded DNA.
5. Recombination: The enzyme integrase  
 
combines the viral DNA into the host cell 
DNA.
6. Transcription: Viral DNA is transcribed to
produce long chains of viral protein.
7. Assembly: Sets of viral proteins come
together.
8. Budding: Release of immature virus
occurs as viral proteins push out of the
host cell, wrapping themselves in a new
envelope. The viral enzyme protease
begins cutting the viral proteins.
9. Release: Immature virus breaks free of 
the host cell.
10. Maturation: The viral enzyme protease
finishes cutting the viral proteins, and
the proteins combine to complete the 
formation of the virus.

 Chapter 3: Dead or Alive: Viruses
There’s more than one way to copy a virus
In order to reproduce, viruses need to copy their genetic material and make 
more viral proteins. In eukaryotic cells, production of nucleic acids (DNA and 
RNA) occurs in the nucleus, while synthesis of proteins occurs in the cyto-
plasm. So, many viral invaders of eukaryotic cells must visit both of these 
locations to complete their multiplication cycle.
The main groups of eukaryotic cell viruses and their multiplication strategies 
are as follows:
 
✓ Double-stranded DNA viruses, such as smallpox, usually insert their 
genetic material into the host nucleus. The genetic material is copied as 
the host cell copies its own genetic material as it prepares to divide.
 
✓ Retroviruses, such as HIV, contain single-stranded RNA for their genetic 
material. Once this RNA enters the cytoplasm of the cell, the virus uses 
a unique enzyme called reverse transcriptase to make a DNA copy of the 
RNA. The double-stranded DNA enters the nucleus, where it inserts into 
the host DNA by recombination. HIV can be latent, or it can reproduce 
actively by making new RNA molecules from the viral DNA. During active 
replication, the RNA molecules move back out into the cytoplasm where 
they’re used to make viral proteins.
 
✓ Double-stranded RNA viruses, such as many viruses that attack impor-
tant crop plants, introduce their RNA molecules into the cytoplasm of 
the cell. The double-stranded RNA molecules of the genetic material are 
used to make the single-stranded RNA molecules that are necessary for 
the production of viral proteins. The entire multiplication cycle of these 
viruses occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell.
 
✓ Single-stranded RNA viruses are divided into two groups:
 
• Negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, such as influenza 
and measles, insert their single-stranded RNA molecules into the 
cytoplasm of the cell. These viruses are called negative-sense 
viruses because their RNA molecules can’t be read directly to 
create proteins. First, their negative-sense RNA molecules must be 
used to make complementary, or “mirror image” RNA molecules. 
Then, these new complementary RNA molecules make viral pro-
teins. It’s as if the genetic material of these viruses is written back-
wards and must first be turned around before it can be read.
 
• Positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, such as mosaic 
viruses that attack crop plants, insert their single-stranded RNA 
molecules into the cytoplasm of the cell. These RNA molecules can 
be read directly for the synthesis of viral proteins.

48
Part I: The World of the Cell 
The genetic material of viruses can come in many forms, so it’s not surprising 
that several different types of enzymes are involved in copying this genetic 
material. Some viruses use host enzymes to copy their genetic material; 
others use viral enzymes. In general, the viral enzymes make more mistakes 
than do host enzymes. These mistakes lead to genetic variation in viruses 
and make them harder to defeat with your immune system, vaccines, or anti-
viral drugs.
Leaving it all behind
After the viral genetic material is copied, the viral particles assemble and 
prepare to leave the host cell. Some viruses destroy the host cell as they 
exit, causing it to burst, while others leave gradually, allowing the host cell 
to remain intact for longer periods of time. Enveloped viruses exit the cell 
by budding. The capsids of the virus push up against the plasma membrane, 
which is already studded with viral proteins, and get wrapped up in the mem-
brane as they leave the cell.
Putting it all together
The basic steps of the multiplication cycles of eukaryotic viruses are the 
same as those for bacterial viruses. However, the multiplication cycles of 
eukaryotic viruses are typically more complex. For example, when an envel-
oped virus attacks a eukaryotic cell, the stages of the multiplication cycle 
would be as follows:
 
1. Attachment.
 
 Proteins on the surface of the virus bind to receptors on the surface of 
the host cell.
 
2. Penetration.
 
 The virus enters the host cell by fusion or receptor-mediated endocytosis, 
bringing its genetic material into the cell.
 
3. Uncoating.
 
 The viral capsid is removed, releasing the genetic material of the virus 
into the cell.
 
4. Biosynthesis.
 
 Host or viral enzymes copy the viral genetic material. Energy and materi-
als from the host cell are used to build viral proteins.
 
5. Maturation.
 
 The viral particles assemble. This step may occur in the cytoplasm or 
nucleus of the cell, depending on the particular virus.

49
 Chapter 3: Dead or Alive: Viruses
 
6. Release.
 
 The virus exits the host cell by budding. As the viral particles leave the 
host cell, they wrap themselves in pieces of the host plasma membrane 
that were modified by the addition of viral proteins.
HIV and AIDS: Viruses in the real world
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a disease in which the entire 
immune system collapses, affects millions of people worldwide. The human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes AIDS.
 
HIV destroys the immune system because it infects a type of white blood cell, 
called a T-cell, which is critical to human immunity against disease.
T-cells are basically the generals of the immune system army — they give 
the chemical commands that activate other cells who seek out and destroy 
viruses. As HIV hijacks and takes over T-cells (refer to Figure 3-3), the T-cells 
stop functioning, messages are no longer sent to other immune system cells, 
and the entire immune system stops working. When destruction of T-cells by 
HIV reaches a certain critical point, the immune system collapses, and the 
infected person becomes susceptible to any and all infections, such as pneu-
monia. People with AIDS usually die not from the HIV virus itself, but rather 
due to complications from these other infections.
The multiplication cycle of HIV is a good example of the features of viruses 
that attack eukaryotic cells. HIV is an enveloped virus that enters the cell by 
fusion and exits by budding. It can be latent or active and completes parts of 
its multiplication cycle in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. It uses viral 
enzymes with a high error rate to copy its genetic material and so is highly 
variable.
In some ways, HIV represents the perfect storm in the form of a virus. Not 
only does it attack immune system cells, making it hard for bodies to fight 
the virus, but it has other features that make it hard to target with vaccines 
or antiviral drugs. HIV is hard to fight with vaccines and drugs because
 
✓ The virus can be latent. When the virus is dormant in cells, the immune 
systems or antiviral drugs have nothing to recognize. The virus is just a 
sleeping piece of DNA. Antiviral drugs can block all of the active virus in 
the body, but they can’t clear the latent virus from the cells. The virus 
can reactivate at a later time.
 
✓ The virus is highly variable. Reverse transcriptase makes lots of mis-
takes, which result in a constantly changing virus that is hard to target.

50
Part I: The World of the Cell 
 
The variability of the HIV virus helps it to eventually develop resistance to 
antiviral drugs and makes it a difficult target for vaccine development, 
although research on a vaccine against the virus continues.
With no cure or vaccine, the best defense against the virus is to block trans-
mission. Because transmission requires exchange of bodily fluids, such 
as semen or blood, people can utilize protective measures to prevent this 
transmission. Public education campaigns have been very successful in some 
countries in bringing the rates of HIV infection under control.
The once and future plague
During the Middle Ages, the Black Death killed 
approximately one-third of the people living in 
Europe. This plague was so huge that it had far-
reaching effects on agriculture, social class 
structure, religion, and economics. Even today, 
the plague remains a terrifying reminder of what 
disease can do to human populations.
Could such a devastating plague ever happen 
again? Is it happening now? Over 40 million 
people today, or about 6 percent of the global 
population, are estimated to be infected with 
the HIV virus. The situation is the worst in sub-
Saharan Africa, where as many as 20 percent of 
adults are infected with the HIV virus. As these 
adults sicken and die, their children, who often 
have HIV from birth, are left without parents and 
the fabric of their societies is torn apart, just 
as the Black Death tore apart the societies of 
Europe during the Middle Ages.
Fortunately, human knowledge and communi-
cation are considerably better today than they 
were during the Middle Ages. Scientists and 
other people around the globe are working to 
stop the spread of HIV and to find a cure for HIV 
infection. Many countries and organizations, 
such as UNAIDS, AVERT, and the One cam-
paign, are rallying support for the global effort 
to fight AIDS through research, education, pre-
vention, and treatment of infected people.

olecules form the structures of cells and carry out 
cellular functions. Chemical bonds within and 
between biological molecules are important to their struc-
ture. Four groups of large molecules — carbohydrates, lip-
ids, proteins, and nucleic acids — are the most important 
molecules to cells. Carbohydrates provide energy and 
structure to cells. Lipids form membranes, send signals, 
and store energy. Proteins are the main worker molecules 
of cells, providing structure and doing lots of different 
jobs.
The most famous molecule of life — DNA — is a nucleic 
acid. The blueprints for life are encoded in the structure 
of DNA, and copies of this code are passed to future gen-
erations. In this part, I explain the basic structure and 
function of molecules and the importance of the four 
groups of macromolecules to cells.

molecular and cellular biology, including the atomic theory of matter, types 
of chemical bonds, acids and bases, and the nature of polymers.
Life Really Matters
Everything on Earth — this book, the dirt, water, food, buildings, animals, 
plants, your body, cells, even the air — is made of matter. Matter is the “stuff” 
that gives everything its substance or mass. Basically, if it takes up space and 
you can weigh it (no matter how big or small a scale you’d need!), it’s made 
of matter. Matter can be a solid like your body, a liquid like water, or a gas 
like the atmosphere.

Part II: Molecules: The Stuff of Life 
Virtually all of the matter on Earth has been here since the planet was formed 
more than 4.5 billion years ago. Living things grow, or increase their matter, 
by eating food and using the matter in the food to build their bodies. When 
living things die, the matter in their bodies is recycled back to the soil and 
the atmosphere by the bacteria and fungi that eat the dead. It is like all living 
things are made up of tiny Lego building blocks. When living things die, bac-
teria and fungi help take all the blocks apart and return some to the planetary 
supply, where living things pick up the blocks and use them again to build 
their bodies. Just think about it — the matter that makes up your body has 
been around in various forms for 4.5 billion years! Some of the matter that 
makes up your cells could even have once been part of a T. rex!
It’s Elemental!: Atoms That 
Make Up Living Things
Matter can be separated into elements. You’ve probably heard of some ele-
ments, such as gold, iron, copper, oxygen, and aluminum, but many more 
exist that you’ve probably never heard of. All the elements discovered by 
scientists have been organized into the Periodic Table of Elements, shown in 
Figure 4-1.
 
Elements are pure substances composed of only one type of atom.
An atom is the smallest unit of an element that has the properties of that 
element. If you had a piece of gold and you cut it into smaller and smaller 
pieces, until you couldn’t even see the pieces anymore, the smallest piece 
that you could cut that would still be gold would be an atom.
When atoms join together, they form larger structures called molecules. 
Atoms and molecules belong to a hierarchy along with cells (Chapter 2) and 
organisms, or living things:
 
✓ Organisms are made of cells.
 
✓ Cells are made of molecules.
 
✓ Molecules are made of atoms.
 
✓ Atoms are made of subatomic particles.

Exploring subatomic particles
Atoms are made of smaller components called subatomic particles. The most 
common subatomic particles in ordinary matter are protons, neutrons, and 
electrons. Protons, neutrons, and electrons each have distinct properties:
 
✓ Protons have a positive electrical charge (+1), have mass, and are found 
in the center, or nucleus, of the atom.
 
✓ Neutrons have no charge (0), or are neutral, have mass, and are found in 
the nucleus of the atom.
 
✓ Electrons have a negative electrical charge (–1), have virtually no mass, 
and orbit the nucleus of the atom.
The arrangement of subatomic particles within the atom is represented 
in the Bohr model of the atom, shown in Figure 4-2. In Figure 4-2a, protons 
are drawn as + or p, and neutrons are drawn as 0 or n. Electrons are shown 
as – or •. The protons and neutrons are clustered together in the center, or 
nucleus, of the atom.
The electrons of an atom are constantly whirling around the nucleus in paths 
called electron orbitals, which are grouped into layers around the nucleus 
called energy levels or electron shells. The Bohr model illustrates these energy 
levels as circular paths around the nucleus. Even though they’re far away 
from the nucleus of the atom, the negatively charged electrons are attracted 
to the positively charged protons, keeping them in orbit around the nucleus. 
(You’ve heard the phrase, “opposites attract,” right?)
 
The center of an atom is called the nucleus, and so is the central organelle in a 
eukaryotic cell. Although they have the same name, they’re very different 
things!

overall charge is negative.  Together, though, NaCl is neutral because the "plus 1"

Defining elements
Every atom of a particular element has the same number of protons in its 
nucleus. That number, called the atomic number of the element, is used to orga-
nize the elements into the Periodic Table of Elements (refer to Figure 4-1).
 
The numbers that you see above the letters in the Periodic Table of Elements 
are the atomic numbers of the elements.
For example, if you look at the second row of the Periodic Table, you can find 
the letter C, which represents the element carbon. The atomic number 6 is 
written above the letter C because carbon has six protons. You can also see 
these six protons in the Bohr model of carbon, shown in Figure 4-2A. In an 
uncharged atom of an element, the number of electrons is the same as the 
number of protons. So, in an atom of carbon, there are six protons and six 
electrons (Figure 4-2A).
Comparing isotopes
The number of protons in the atom of a element never changes. If you have 
an atom of carbon, it has six protons. However, the number of neutrons that 
are packed into the nucleus with those protons can vary between different 
atoms of an element. Most carbon atoms found on planet Earth have six neu-
trons just like the one shown in Figure 4-2a. However, some carbon atoms 
found on planet Earth have eight neutrons in the nucleus. These different 
types of carbon atoms are called isotopes.
 
Isotopes of an element have the same number of protons and electrons as 
each other, but they don’t have the same number of neutrons.
To show how many neutrons a particular isotope has, scientists include the 
mass number of the element along with its name. The mass number is equal 
to the number of protons plus the number of neutrons. (Remember that only 
the protons and neutrons in an atom really have any mass to speak of — the 
mass of electrons is too small to count except in the most careful calcula-
tions.) The most common form of carbon atoms on Earth, the ones that have 
six protons and six neutrons, would have a mass number of 12. You can 
write this form of carbon in words as carbon-12, or with a symbol as 12C. The 
heavier isotope of carbon, which has eight neutrons, has a mass number of 
14. (All carbon has six protons, so 6+8=14.)

59
 Chapter 4: Better Living through Chemistry
The Periodic Table of Elements shows the average mass of all the atoms of 
an element on Earth. That number is written below the letter representing 
the element (refer to Figure 4-1). If you look at the letter C for carbon in the 
second row of the table, you can see the atomic mass given as 12.01 g/mol 
of carbon. Most carbon atoms on Earth have a mass number of 12, but a few 
have a mass number of 14. So, if you take the average of all the carbon atoms 
on Earth, the average comes out a little bit higher than 12.
As a comparison, imagine that you and three friends want to figure out the 
average weight of the apples in your lunches. Three of you have apples that 
weigh exactly 4 ounces, but one of you has an apple that weighs 6 ounces. If 
you added up the weights of all four apples, then divided by four, you’d come 
up with an average weight of 4.5 ounces. Because of the effect of the larger 
apple, the average comes out a little more than the weight of most of the 
apples. The heavier isotopes of an element have the same effect on the aver-
age atomic mass for that element.
If you’re given the mass number of an atom, you can always figure out how 
many neutrons are in the nucleus. Just remember that protons + neutrons = 
mass number and that the number of protons in an element is the atomic 
number that is written in the period table. For example, if you wanted to 
figure out how many neutrons were in an atom of phosphorous-32, you could 
look up phosphorous in the Periodic Table, see that it has an atomic number 
of 15, and do the simple math: mass number – protons = neutrons, 
so 32–15=17 neutrons.
Want a date with a radioactive isotope?
Radioactive isotopes are atoms of an element 
that throw subatomic particles out of their 
nuclei. When they throw out these particles, 
the isotopes decay into a different type of ele-
ment. Radioactive isotopes are very useful in 
science and medicine. For example, scientists 
can use the radioactive isotope carbon-14 to 
determine the age of fossils. In living things, 
the ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 is kept the 
same. But when things die, the carbon-14 that 
was present at the time of death slowly decays 
over time, throwing off particles and becoming 
nitrogen-14. Scientists know how long it takes 
carbon-14 to decay. So, when scientists find a 
fossil, they can analyze it to determine the ratio 
of carbon-14 to carbon-12 to see how much 
carbon-14 has been lost over time. Because 
they know how long it takes carbon-14 to decay, 
they can calculate the approximate age of the 
fossil.

Part II: Molecules: The Stuff of Life 
Let’s Bond: How Atoms Are 
Attracted to Each Other
Atoms come together to form larger, more complicated structures called 
molecules. Chemical bonds are the forces, or glue, that hold atoms together. 
Bonds form when atoms give, take, or share their electrons with each other. 
Atoms within molecules rearrange to form new molecules when bonds break 
and reform.
In cells, atoms are attracted to each other and will form bonds with each 
other because of two main factors:
 
✓ The atoms need to share electrons in order to form stable structures.
 
✓ There is an attraction between opposite electrical charges (positive and 
negative) between two atoms.
One clue that reveals what atoms need in order to be stable comes from 
the atoms in column 18 of the Periodic Table of Elements (refer to Figure 
4-1). These elements are called the inert gases (or noble gases) because 
they do not tend to react with other atoms easily. They’re so stable, in fact, 
that they’re used in MIG and TIG welding as a sort of protective gas blanket 
between regular atmospheric gases and the electrode that is used during 
welding. The secret to the stability of the inert gases is in how they arrange 
their electrons.
Feeling fulfilled by arranging 
your electrons just right
Whether one atom reacts with another atom to form a bond is all about how 
their electrons are arranged, which is called their electron configuration. 
The electron configuration of an atom depends on how many electrons they 
have. As you read from left to right and top to bottom in the Periodic Table 
of Elements, the elements in the Periodic Table increase in size. Each ele-
ment has one more proton than the element before it and thus also one more 
electron. For example, the element carbon is atomic number 6, so it has six 
protons and six electrons. The next element in the Periodic Table is nitrogen, 
atomic number 7, so it has seven protons and seven electrons.

61
 Chapter 4: Better Living through Chemistry
Valence electrons
Understanding the exact electron configuration of an atom is actually pretty 
complicated, but you can take advantage of an excellent shortcut to predict 
how an atom will bond with another atom: Focus on the valence electrons. 
The valence electrons, which are located in particular orbitals in the out-
ermost energy levels of the atoms, are the most important electrons when 
it comes to forming bonds. You can think of them as the electron face that 
atoms show to other atoms. Valence electrons are the electrons that will 
either be shared or given to another atom during bond formation.
To figure out how an atom will react to become stable, you need to know sev-
eral things:
 
✓ The Periodic Table of Elements can tell you the number of valence 
electrons for an element. In the Periodic Table, each column indicates a 
family of elements that have similar properties. In the elements that are 
marked with a Roman numeral and an A, the Roman numeral tells you 
the number of valence electrons found in the atoms within that family. 
No muss, no fuss, just look it up!
 
✓ Atoms seek to have a full set of valence electrons in their outermost 
energy level. If an atom doesn’t have a full set of valence electrons, it 
“feels unfulfilled” and will either give, take, or share electrons to com-
plete its set. The inert gases have a full set of valence electrons, which is 
why they’re so stable.
 
✓ Most atoms follow the octet rule, or Rule of Eight, in order to have a 
full set of valence electrons. The Rule of Eight states that the energy 
level will be full and stable once it contains eight electrons. So, atoms 
will give, take, or share electrons until they have eight valence elec-
trons in their outermost energy level. This rule doesn’t apply to the 
first, smallest energy shell. The first energy shell is complete with two 
valence electrons. So, the Rule of Eight doesn’t apply to hydrogen and 
helium, which have two or fewer electrons — they follow their own Rule 
of Two.
 
 Another way to look at the Rule of Eight is that atoms will give, take, or 
share electrons until their electron configuration matches that of the 
closest inert gas. For example, hydrogen is closest to helium, which has 
two electrons in its outermost energy level, so hydrogen will be stable 
when it has two electrons. Flourine is closest to neon, which has eight 
electrons in its outermost energy level, so fluorine will be stable when it 
has eight electrons.

62
Part II: Molecules: The Stuff of Life 
 
✓ Atoms on the left side of the Periodic Table tend to give up electrons, 
while atoms on the right side of the Periodic Table tend to take elec-
trons. The atoms on the left side of the period table, all the way up to 
aluminum in the column marked IIIA, are metals. Metals have certain 
properties, including a tendency to give up electrons. The atoms on the 
right side of the Periodic Table, including the biologically important 
atoms carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, and sulfur, are nonmet-
als. Nonmetals tend to share or accept electrons from other atoms. 
Hydrogen is also considered a nonmetal, even though it’s in the upper-
left corner of the Periodic Table.
Putting atoms together
Once you know how atoms are likely to react to become stable, you can pre-
dict how they’ll react with each other. You look at what each atom needs to 
become stable and whether the two atoms could fulfill each others’ needs. 
Figuring out how atoms can pair up sounds a bit like a dating service for 
atoms, doesn’t it? As an example, look at how the element carbon (Figure 
4-1A) would react with the element hydrogen. Follow these steps to figure out 
how the two atoms are likely to react with each other:
 
1. Look the element up in the Periodic Table to find out which family it’s 
in and how many valence electrons it has.
 
a. Carbon is located in family IVA in the Periodic Table, so it has four 
valence electrons.
 
b. Hydrogen is located in family IA, so it has one valence electron.
 
2. Look at the position of the element in the Periodic Table to predict 
whether it will give up or receive electrons to complete its set of 
valence electrons.
 
a. Carbon is on the right side of the Periodic Table, so it is a non-
metal. It’s likely to receive electrons from another atom.
 
b. Although hydrogen is on the left side of the Periodic Table, it’s also 
a nonmetal. It’s also likely to receive electrons.
 
3. Apply the Rule of Eight (if the element is hydrogen or helium, apply 
the Rule of Two).
 
a. In order for carbon to be stable, it needs eight valence electrons. It 
has only four, so it needs four more valence electrons.
 
b. In order for hydrogen to be stable, it needs two valence electrons. 
It has only one, so it needs one more to be stable.
After you analyze both atoms, the dating can begin! Carbon and hydrogen 
are electron receivers, so it’s not likely that one would give the other its elec-
trons. If they share, they can both receive. You know that carbon needs four 

63
 Chapter 4: Better Living through Chemistry
valence electrons, and each hydrogen atom has one available. So, one carbon 
atom would need to share with four hydrogen atoms to get enough valence 
electrons to fill its set. If one carbon atom shares electrons with four hydrogen 
atoms, the carbon atom will fill its set of valence electrons and become stable. 
Likewise, the carbon atom is sharing its four valence electrons with the four 
hydrogen atoms, so each hydrogen atom gets to share one and complete its 
set of two. The hydrogen atoms are also stable. The atoms live happily ever 
after in the form of gas methane, which has the chemical formula CH4.
Working without a Periodic Table
The Periodic Table of Elements and the Rule 
of Eight are useful for predicting the behavior 
of many elements, but those shortcuts don’t 
work for everything. Plus, you may not always 
have access to a Periodic Table (on an exam, 
perhaps?). So, sometimes you have to figure 
out the electron configuration of an atom on 
your own in order to determine the number of 
valence electrons.
To figure out the electron configuration for a 
particular atom, you need to know how many 
electrons the atom has and how atoms organize 
their electrons. Electrons are organized accord-
ing to the following rules:
 ✓ Electrons travel in pairs within orbitals 
around the nucleus of the atom.
 ✓ Electron orbitals are organized into energy 
levels. Energy levels are identified by their 
quantum number. In other words, they’re 
numbered beginning with the number 1 for 
the energy level closest to the nucleus of 
the atom.
 ✓ Each energy level can have as many sub-
levels as its quantum number. So level 1 
can have one sublevel, level 2 can have two 
sublevels, and so on. Sublevels are identi-
fied by letters that represent the shapes of 
the electron orbitals within that sublevel.
 ✓ The first sublevel is called an s sublevel.
 ✓ The second sublevel is called a p sublevel.
 ✓ The third sublevel is called a d sublevel.
 ✓ Each sublevel holds a different number of 
orbitals and maximum number of electrons. 
Because electrons travel in pairs within 
orbitals, each sublevel can hold a maximum 
of electrons for each orbital.
 ✓ s sublevels hold one orbital with up to two 
electrons.
 ✓ p sublevels hold three orbitals with up to six 
electrons.
 ✓ d sublevels hold five orbitals with up to ten 
electrons.
 ✓ The maximum number of electrons that an 
energy level can hold is represented by 
the formula 2n2. The letter n is the quantum 
number for the level. So the first level can 
hold a maximum number of 2(1)2, which 
is two electrons. This maximum number 
makes sense because the first level has 
only one s sublevel that holds one pair of 
electrons. The second level can hold a 
maximum of 2(2)2 which equals eight elec-
trons. These eight electrons represent the 
two electrons in the s sublevel and the six 
electrons in the p sublevel. The third level 
can hold a maximum of 18 electrons, 2 in s, 
6 in p, and 10 in d.

Part II: Molecules: The Stuff of Life 
Holding on: Electronegativity
Not all atoms treat electrons equally. Some atoms have a really strong pull 
for electrons and tend to attract them. Other atoms have a weaker pull for 
electrons and even give up electrons rather easily.
 
The tendency of an atom to attract electrons is called its electronegativity.
An atom that has a strong pull for electrons is highly electronegative or, as I 
like to call it, an electron hog (because of its tendency to hog the electrons).
The electronegativity of an atom is important in cellular chemistry for several 
reasons:
 
✓ Electronegativity affects bonding behavior of atoms. If an atom that is 
highly electronegative interacts with an atom that is not, the electrone-
gative atom is likely to take electrons away from the other atom.
 
✓ Electronegativity is important during reactions between molecules. 
One of the most important processes in cells, the transfer of energy from 
food to a usable form for the cell, relies heavily upon the high electrone-
gativity of oxygen (Chapter 11).
 
Electronegativity increases as you read from left to right in the Periodic Table 
of Elements. The exception to this rule is the last column on the right of the 
Periodic Table, which contains the inert gases. (These elements have a full set 
of valence electrons and have very low electronegativity.)
(continued)
 ✓ Energy levels fill with electrons in order. 
Level 1 would fill first, level 2 would fill 
second, and so on.
If you put all these rules together, you can figure 
out the electron configuration for a particular 
atom. For example, look at the element chlorine. 
Its atomic number is 17, so it has 17 electrons. If 
you put those electrons into the energy shells, 
you’d arrange them as follows:
 1. Put two electrons in the first energy level. 
That leaves 15 electrons remaining.
 2. Put eight electrons in the second energy level. 
That leaves seven electrons remaining.
 3. Put seven electrons in the third energy 
level.
By following these steps, you figured out that 
chlorine has seven electrons in its outermost 
energy level. These electrons are its seven 
valence electrons.

Give and take: Oxidation and reduction
Atoms react with one another in order to have a full set of valence electrons. 
Atoms that are highly electronegative will attract electrons from other atoms. 
The result of an interaction between two atoms is going to depend on how 
electronegative they are relative to each other. You can think of this relation-
ship as a tug of war for electrons. A highly electronegative atom, the elec-
tron hog, is like a big guy with lots of muscle that can pull hard on the rope. 
Atoms that aren’t very electronegative can’t pull as hard. If a highly electro-
negative atom goes toe to toe with an electron wimp, the big guy is going to 
take electrons from the little guy. However, if two equally electronegative 
atoms pull against each other, it may end up in a tie, and the atoms will share 
electrons.
 
If one atom takes an electron from another atom, an oxidation reduction reac-
tion, or redox reaction, has occurred. The atom that gave up the electron was 
oxidized; the one that received the electron was reduced.
An example of oxidation that you’re probably familiar with is when some-
thing made of iron rusts. Iron gives up electrons to oxygen to form a com-
pound called iron oxide, which is visible as the red rust on the iron object. 
So, iron is oxidized during the formation of iron oxide, while oxygen is 
reduced.
Another good example of a redox reaction is the interaction of sodium and 
chlorine to form sodium chloride, which is the fancy chemical name for 
table salt. In this reaction, which Figure 4-2B shows in detail, chlorine takes 
an electron from sodium. Chlorine is highly electronegative and needs only 
one electron to become stable with eight valence electrons. Sodium is not 
very electronegative and will become stable (like its nearest inert gas neon) 
if it gives up its electron. So, sodium gives up its electron and is oxidized. 
Chlorine accepts the electron and is reduced.
 
To remember the definitions of oxidation and reduction, memorize this 
phrase: “Leo the lion goes ger.” LEO stands for loss of electrons is oxidation. 
GER stands for gain of electrons is reduction.
Opposites attract: Ionic bonds
Ionic bonds are electrical attractions between positively and negatively 
charged atoms, called ions. In solids, such as sodium chloride or table salt, 
ionic bonds are very strong. However, in the watery environment of the cell, 
they are weak bonds.

66
Part II: Molecules: The Stuff of Life 
The compound sodium chloride is the classic example of an ionic bond. 
When sodium gives an electron to chlorine, as in Figure 4-2B, sodium no 
longer has the same number of protons and electrons. Because it has one 
more proton than electron, it becomes the positively charged sodium ion. 
Likewise, when chloride accepts an electron, it becomes unbalanced in 
charge, having one more electron than proton. It becomes the negatively 
charged chloride ion. (For every extra proton an atom has, it gains a charge 
of +1; for every extra electron, it gains a charge of –1.) The sodium ion and 
chloride ion have opposite electrical charges and so are attracted to each 
other. The electrical attraction between the two ions is an example of an 
ionic bond.
Sharing is caring: Covalent bonds
When two atoms have about the same pull for electrons — in other words 
they’re equal in electronegativity — they’ll probably form a covalent bond 
with each other.
 
Covalent bonds are bonds based on shared pairs of electrons. In the watery 
environment of the cell, covalent bonds are the strongest bonds.
Figure 4-2C shows an example of a covalent bond where two oxygen atoms 
are shown joining together to form oxygen gas. Oxygen is family VIA, so it has 
six valence electrons and needs two more to become stable. The two oxygen 
atoms are equal in electronegativity, so they’ll share electrons with each 
other. If each atom shares two electrons with the other, then they’ll both 
have eight valence electrons (6+2=8). The shared electrons “belong” to both 
atoms and spend time orbiting both atomic nuclei, so both atoms become 
stable. The four dots located between the two atoms represent the two pairs 
of shared electrons. Each pair of shared electrons is one covalent bond, so 
the two pairs of shared electrons are called a double bond.
A molecule by any other picture
Scientists draw atoms and molecules in several different ways, depending on 
what they want to emphasize. For example, the Bohr model of the atom (refer 
to Figure 4-2) shows the configuration of electrons within each energy level. 
Other ways of drawing atoms and molecules illustrate different aspects of 
molecules, such as the bond angles or the shape of the molecule.

67
 Chapter 4: Better Living through Chemistry
You can compare several different ways of drawing molecules by looking at 
the drawings in Figures 4-3 and 4-4:

Part II: Molecules: The Stuff of Life 
Don’t hog the toys! Polar covalent bonds
Not all covalent bonds are equal. When an atom forms a covalent bond with 
another atom that is somewhat different in electronegativity, the bond may 
become unequal, or polar.
 
A polar covalent bond is formed when electrons are shared unequally between 
two atoms.
In a polar covalent bond, the shared electrons spend more time orbiting the 
nucleus of the more electronegative atom. (You can think of this unequal 
sharing as the electrons spending more time playing with one of the atoms 
than the other.) Because electrons have a negative charge, the end of the 
molecule where the electrons tend to hang out becomes slightly negative. 
The end of the molecule that gets ignored by the electrons has fewer nega-
tive charges than positive charges (its electrons are hanging out somewhere 
else), so it becomes slightly positive.
An important molecule that has polar covalent bonds is water (Figure 4-4). 
A water molecule has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (H2O). 
Both hydrogen and oxygen are nonmetals, which are usually electron receiv-
ers, so they’ll share electrons with each other. Oxygen needs two valence 
electrons to become stable. Each hydrogen can supply one. So, one oxygen 
atom shares electrons with two hydrogen atoms. However, oxygen is much 
more electronegative than hydrogen, so oxygen doesn’t share equally. It’s 
an electron hog and keeps the electrons playing at its end of the molecule. 
The oxygen end of the water molecule develops a slight negative charge (rep-
resented by δ–). The hydrogen ends of the water molecule develop a slight 
positive charge (δ+). Each covalent bond within the water molecule is a polar 
covalent bond, and the entire molecule itself is also said to be polar.
Molecular Velcro: Hydrogen bonds
After polar covalent bonds are formed, they set up conditions for the forma-
tion of another type of bond, the hydrogen bond. Hydrogen bonds are weak 
electrical attractions that form between the ends of polar molecules. As 
always, opposites attract, so the negatively charged end of one molecule 
would be attracted to the positively charged end of another.
 
The term hydrogen bond doesn’t refer to a covalent bond with a hydrogen 
atom. The bond got its name because the hydrogen atoms on polar molecules 
are often seen sticking to atoms on other polar molecules. For example, in the 
water molecules shown in Figure 4-5, the hydrogen bonds occur between the 
water molecules, not within the water molecules

Hydrogen bonds are the molecular equivalent of Velcro. Have you ever 
looked closely at a piece of Velcro? One side has tiny little hooks. On the 
other side are soft fuzzy stuff for the hooks to grab. Each little hook on its 
own forms a very weak attachment to the fuzzy stuff — it would take almost 
nothing to pull it free again. However, when you have a whole strip of the 
stuff, you can hold all kinds of things together!
Hydrogen bonds work the same way. Each individual hydrogen bond is 
very weak. However, many hydrogen bonds together do important things 
inside cells. Hydrogen bonds hold the two halves of your DNA molecules 
together so that they form a twisting, ladder-like double helix (see Chapter 
7). Hydrogen bonds are also important in holding proteins together in 
their proper shapes so that they can do their many jobs inside the cell (see 
Chapter 6). And finally, without hydrogen bonds, water would not have its 
amazing properties. Hydrogen bonds between the positively and negatively 
charged ends of the water molecules cause them to stick together (see Figure 
4-5), making the water molecules cling to each other.
If you have ever seen a bug walking on the surface of water, you have seen 
the power of hydrogen bonds in action. The hydrogen bonds between water 
molecules give water its surface tension, which is just enough cling to support 
the weight of small water bugs.

70
Part II: Molecules: The Stuff of Life 
Molecular cliques: Hydrophobic 
interactions
Some molecules just don’t play nicely with water. Because water is a polar 
molecule, it tends to stick to itself via hydrogen bonds (see Figure 4-5). Other 
polar molecules also stick to water molecules and can mix right in, dissolv-
ing into the water. However, nonpolar molecules have evenly shared covalent 
bonds and lack the slight negative and positive charges of polar molecules. 
Because they’re uncharged, nonpolar molecules don’t mix well with water.
 
Nonpolar molecules are also called hydrophobic molecules because “hydro” 
means water and “phobic” means to fear.
When nonpolar molecules are placed in a watery environment, the polar mol-
ecules will all stick to each other and push the nonpolar molecules away. You 
can think of the scenario as if the polar molecules all belong to a clique that 
refuses to hang out with the nonpolar molecules. (The name of this clique, by 
the way, is the hydrophilic molecules.) Because the nonpolar molecules all get 
pushed together, they become associated with each other. 
 
The interaction between nonpolar molecules is called a hydrophobic 
interaction.
You can easily demonstrate a hydrophobic interaction to yourself. Just go 
into your kitchen, put some water in a cup, and then add a little oil. Even if 
you stir the mixture vigorously to mix the oil into the water, as soon as you 
stop stirring, all the oil will gather together on top of the water. The water 
molecules all stick to each other and push the oil molecules away. Hence the 
saying, “They get along like oil and water!”
Blue Planet: The Ocean Inside Your Cells
Water is essential to life on Earth; in fact, life on Earth probably began in 
the oceans. When living things moved onto land, they took the ocean with 
them inside their bodies. Your body, for example, is probably about 60 to 75 
percent water. Water is essential to the proper functioning of your body and 
your cells for several reasons:
 
✓ Water is a solvent. Ions and polar molecules dissolve in water. Water 
surrounds these molecules, preventing ions from crystallizing into 
solids and facilitating the function of polar molecules. All the chemical 
reactions that happen inside cells happen in a watery environment.

71
 Chapter 4: Better Living through Chemistry
 
✓ Water helps move things across membranes. As water moves across 
membranes, it helps dissolved ions and small molecules to pass into and 
out of cells.
 
✓ Water causes hydrophobic interactions. When water sticks to itself, it 
pushes nonpolar molecules away. Hydrophobic interactions are impor-
tant to the structure of plasma membranes and other membranes in the 
cell (see Chapter 2).
 
✓ Water helps maintain the structure of important molecules. Water 
clings to polar surfaces in proteins and nucleic acids, helping maintain 
their structure.
Splitting water
Water molecules fall apart easily and get back together easily, shifting back 
and forth between being water molecules and ions. When water molecules 
fall apart, oxygen (the little electron hog) keeps an electron from one of the 
hydrogens and then lets the rest of the hydrogen go. The electron-less hydro-
gen is now a positively charged hydrogen ion, which is really just a proton. 
The oxygen keeps the other hydrogen with it, forming a negatively charged 
hydroxide ion. The reaction for the reversible ionization of water molecule 
into ions is
H2O ←→ H+ + OH–
In pure water, the balance between hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions is 
exactly equal. In cells, the balance between hydrogen and hydroxide ions 
shifts slightly as conditions within the cell change.
Measuring pH
The concentration of hydrogen ions within a solution, including the solutions 
inside and surrounding cells, is important to living things. Hydrogen ion con-
centration is represented as [H+] and is measured by the pH scale, shown in 
Figure 4-6. The pH scale is useful because hydrogen ion concentration in cells 
and other solutions is small. For example, in pure water, the concentration of 
hydrogen ions and the concentration of hydroxide ions is exactly balanced, 
and the concentration of each is 1.0 × 10-7 M (M stands for molarity, which 
represents the concentration in number of moles of solute per liter). To con-
vert hydrogen ion concentration to a pH value, you take the negative log of 
the concentration:
pH = –log[H+]

By taking the negative log of the concentration, you convert the [H+] in pure 
water from 1.0 × 10-7 M to a pH value of 7.0. By converting all [H+] values to 
pH, scientists created a pH scale with values from 0 to 14. I’m sure you’ll 
agree that the numbers 0 to 14 are easier to deal with than the tiny numbers 
of the unconverted hydrogen ion concentrations!
Cells can survive only within a narrow range of pH. The pH of pure water is 
7.0, which is considered neutral. Solutions that have pH values lower than 
7.0 are acidic. Solutions with pH values higher than 7.0 are basic. Most cells 
prefer environments with pH values very close to neutral. As their pH values 
move to either end of the scale, solutions typically become increasingly dam-
aging to cells. There are some exceptions, such as bacteria that survive in 
acidic rivers or alkaline (basic) lakes.

73
 Chapter 4: Better Living through Chemistry
Changing pH
Some chemicals can change the pH of a solution when they’re added to the 
solution. Chemicals that make solutions more acidic are called acids; chemi-
cals that make solutions more basic are called bases. Acids are chemicals 
that release hydrogen ions into the solution, increasing its acidity and thus 
lowering its pH. Bases, on the other hand, remove hydrogen ions from a solu-
tion, lowering its acidity and increasing pH.
 
I like to think of bases as little sponges for hydrogen ions. When you add a 
base to a solution, it will suck up the hydrogen ions, decreasing their concen-
tration in the solution.
Maintaining pH
Because cells can survive only within a narrow range of pH, maintaining pH is 
hugely important to cells. To maintain their pH, cells employ buffers. A buffer 
solution resists changes in pH from the effects of acids or bases. Buffer solu-
tions maintain pH because they’re switch hitters — they can either release 
hydrogen ions into a solution or remove them. Usually, buffer solutions con-
tain a matched pair of a weak acid and base. That way, no matter which way 
the pH starts to change, a chemical is on hand to counteract the change.
A good example of a buffer system is cruising through your veins right now. 
Your blood contains the acid/base pair of carbonic acid and bicarbonate to 
help maintain your blood pH at just the right level. When the concentration of 
hydrogen ions in the blood increases, which happens when you exercise, the 
bicarbonate in the blood snatches them up so that your blood doesn’t become 
dangerously acidic. When the concentration of hydrogen ions drops too low, 
carbonic acid releases more into the blood before your blood can become dan-
gerously alkaline. The reactions for this buffer system look like this:
H+ + HCO3
– ←→ H2CO3
This reaction proceeds in either direction, depending on the conditions 
in the blood. If the blood becomes acidic, bicarbonate combines with the 
hydrogen ions, producing carbonic acid. If the blood becomes alkaline, car-
bonic acid releases hydrogen ions, correcting blood pH.
When bicarbonate picks up hydrogen ions, it’s converted into carbonic acid. 
Alternatively, when carbonic acid releases hydrogen ions, it’s converted into 
bicarbonate. Together, the two compounds keep blood pH very close to a 
healthy level of 7.4.

Part II: Molecules: The Stuff of Life 
Chain, Chain, Chain: Building 
and Breaking Polymers
As cells use and recycle matter, they constantly take molecules apart and 
rearrange the combinations of atoms to make new molecules needed by 
the cell. Molecules are like the building blocks that matter, including living 
things, are made of. Each molecule is made of even smaller building blocks, 
which represent the atoms. If you imagine that each element from the 
Periodic Table is represented by a different color block, then molecules 
would be built in many different shapes and color combinations. Cells take 
these large, colorful molecules, break them back down into smaller group-
ings of blocks, and then recombine the smaller groupings into new structures 
needed by the cell.
Identifying the parts and the whole
Macromolecules are just what they sound like — big molecules. Four groups 
of macromolecules are vitally important to cell structure and function:
 
✓ Carbohydrates (see Chapter 5)
 
✓ Proteins (see Chapter 6)
 
✓ Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA — see Chapter 7)
 
✓ Lipids (fats and related molecules — see Chapter 8)
Three of the four types of macromolecules — carbohydrates, proteins, and 
nucleic acids — are very long molecules made of the same repeating type of 
building block. A long repetitive molecule is called a polymer. The building 
block a polymer is made out of is called a monomer.
Getting together and breaking up again
Polymers are made by stringing together monomers to form a long chain. 
As each monomer is added to the chain, two hydrogen atoms and an 
oxygen atom are removed from the new monomer and growing chain 
(Figure 4-7A). The hydrogen and oxygen atoms are combined to form water 
during the process of adding the monomer. Because a water molecule is 
formed when a monomer is added, the reaction is called condensation or 
dehydration synthesis. (Condensation forms water and so does adding mono-
mers to the growing polymer.)

Polymers can be broken back down into individual monomers by hydrolysis. 
During hydrolysis, a water molecule is inserted into the bond between two 
monomers (Figure 4-7B). The bond is broken and the monomer is freed from 
the chain.
 
Hydrolysis is easy to remember if you know what the word means. Hydro 
means water, and lysis means breaking. So, hydrolysis is breaking something 
with water.

76
Part II: Molecules: The Stuff of Life 
Playing the name game with polymers
When molecules of the same type are joined 
together, they form repetitive molecules of vari-
ous lengths. The name of the chain depends on 
the number of repeating units in the chain. One 
molecule by itself is a monomer, because mono 
means one. Attach two monomers together, 
and you have a dimer, because di means two. 
Stringing several monomers into a short chain 
forms an oligomer, because oligo means few. 
Chains of many monomers are called polymers 
because poly means many. These prefixes 
remain the same no matter what type of polymer 
you’re talking about, while the suffix changes 
depending on the type of monomer. So, a chain 
of two sugars is a disaccharide, a short chain 
of nucleotides is an oligonucleotide, and a long 
chain of amino acids is a polypeptide.

Carbohydrates: How Sweet 
They Are
In This Chapter
▶ Examining monosaccharides

arbohydrates are made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Many 
different monosaccharides, or simple sugars, can combine into polysac-
charides, or complex carbohydrates. Even though they have a bad reputation 
among some diet plans, carbohydrates perform many essential functions 
for cells. In this chapter, I present the basic structure of carbohydrates and 
explain their importance to cells.
CH2O: Structure of Carbohydrates
In recent years, due to the comeback of the low-carb diet, carbohydrates 
have gotten a bad rap. Some people have started thinking that proteins are 
good, and carbohydrates are bad. However, the idea that carbohydrates 
aren’t good for you is overly simplified. After all, carbohydrates are an essen-
tial component of your cells. What can make a difference is the type of carbo-
hydrates you eat. Carbohydrates are organic molecules composed of carbon, 
hydrogen, and oxygen. The two main types of carbohydrates are as follows:
 
✓ Monosaccharides are also called simple sugars. (Most diets recommend 
that you avoid eating too much of this type of carbohydrate.) Glucose is 
a monosaccharide that is usually available to your cells.
 
✓ Polysaccharides are also called complex carbohydrates. (Fiber is an 
example of a complex carbohydrate that is a recommended part of your 
daily nutrition.)

78
Part II: Molecules: The Stuff of Life 
Keeping it simple: Monosaccharides
Monosaccharides, or simple sugars, are single sugars. (“Mono” means “one” 
and “sacchar” means sugar.) Many monosaccharides have the generic for-
mula CH2O: For every one carbon atom they have, they have two hydrogen 
atoms and one oxygen atom. Two monosaccharides that may be familiar to 
you are glucose (see Figure 5-1A) and fructose (a sugar found in fruit and also 
in high-fructose corn syrup).
All monosaccharides have certain features in common:
 
✓ A backbone of 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 carbons. Sugars are categorized based on 
the number of carbons: In order of the numbers, they are called trioses, 
tetroses, pentoses, hexoses, and heptoses. For example, glucose is a 
hexose, or 6-carbon sugar.
 
✓ Hydroxyl groups (–OH) attached to every carbon but one. The 
hydroxyl groups make sugars polar, which is why they dissolve easily in 
water.
 
✓ One double-bonded oxygen attached to the carbon backbone. An 
oxygen double-bonded to a carbon is called a carbonyl group. If the car-
bonyl group is located at the end of a monosaccharide, the sugar is an 
aldose. If the carbonyl group is located within the carbon backbone, the 
sugar is a ketose. Glucose is an aldose because its carbonyl group is at 
the end of the carbon backbone.
Finding your way around
When scientists want to discuss the structure 
of molecules, they need a way to make sure 
that they’re all looking at the same part of the 
molecule. To mark the molecule, they number 
the carbon atoms in the structure.
For carbohydrates, the rule is that the carbon 
atoms are numbered consecutively, beginning 
with the end of the carbohydrate that is nearest 
the carbonyl group (double-bonded oxygen). 
This numbering is pretty easy to do when you’re 
looking at a linear structure of a carbohydrate 
as in Figure 5-1B, but when carbohydrates are 
in their ring form, it can be more challenging.
Typically, you begin numbering with the carbon 
on the right side of the oxygen in the ring and 
then number consecutively away from the 
oxygen. So for the glucose molecule in Figure 
5-1B, the #1 carbon is represented by the angle 
on the right side of the ring. Numbering away 
from that carbon brings you to the #6 carbon 
that sticks up off the ring.

79
 Chapter 5: Carbohydrates: How Sweet They Are
 
Of the four groups of macromolecules (carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, 
and lipids), carbohydrates have the greatest number of hydroxyl groups 
(–OH) attached to their carbon atoms. When you’re trying to distinguish 
between the four types of macromolecules, a structure with hydroxyl groups 
attached to almost every carbon is probably a carbohydrate.

Two monosaccharides can have the same numbers of carbon, hydrogen, and 
oxygen atoms and yet have very different properties. When two monosac-
charides have the same atoms, but those atoms are arranged differently, 
the sugars are isomers of each other (“iso” means same). For example, if the 
hydroxyl group (–OH) and hydrogen atom (–H) attached to the fourth carbon 
from the top in glucose (see Figure 5-1A) were swapped with each other, the 
sugar would be converted to galactose. Glucose and galactose are almost 
identical, except for that one change in the arrangement of the atoms, and 
yet they behave very differently in cells.

80
Part II: Molecules: The Stuff of Life 
 
The way the atoms are bonded together is very important in the structure and 
function of sugars. Isomers are made from exactly the same atoms, but their 
atoms are arranged differently.
In the watery environment of the cell, monosaccharides convert into ring-
shaped structures. A bond forms between two atoms in the backbone of the 
sugar, causing the sugar to bend around to form the ring. As an example, 
compare the linear structure of glucose shown in Figure 5-1A with the ring 
structure shown in Figure 5-1B.
Making it complex: Polysaccharides
Polysaccharides, or complex carbohydrates, are polymers (see Chapter 4) 
of monosaccharides. (“Poly” means many, and “sacchar” means sugar, so 
a polysaccharide is “many sugars” strung together.) To make polysaccha-
rides, monosaccharides are joined together by condensation reactions (see 
Chapter 4). During condensation, a water molecule is removed as a bond is 
Got lactose intolerance?
Lactose intolerance is the inability to break 
down the disaccharide lactose, or milk sugar. 
People who don’t produce the enzyme lactase 
can’t break down lactose as it passes through 
their small intestine. If a person who is lactose 
intolerant consumes dairy products, the lac-
tose will pass through their small intestines 
undigested.
The arrival of undigested lactose is happy 
news for the bacteria who live there and are 
just waiting for their next meal. Unfortunately, 
for the person, one of the side effects of lactose 
breakdown by the bacteria is gas production. 
Too much gas in the intestines can lead to dis-
comfort and even diarrhea.
Most people begin to produce less lactase 
after they reach age 2 (when milk becomes 
less important as a source of nutrition) and 
gradually become more intolerant as they age. 
One exception is people of Northern European 
descent, in whom lactose intolerance is least 
common. Scientists speculate that, in the past, 
Northern Europeans were heavily dependent 
on dairy products for their nutrition and that 
a mutation occurred that allowed people to 
produce lactase further into their lifespan. 
This mutation would have given people who 
had it an advantage because they could sur-
vive easily on dairy products, and so this gene 
spread through the population.
Today, people who suffer from lactose intoler-
ance can still consume dairy products if they 
want to. They just need to purchase some 
lactase at their local drug store and mix it with 
the dairy products before they eat them. The 
lactase will break down the lactose before it 
gets into the small intestine, and the bacteria 
won’t be able to produce the uncomfortable 
side effects.

 Chapter 5: Carbohydrates: How Sweet They Are
formed between an atom in the growing polysaccharide chain and an atom in 
the monosaccharide that is being added to the chain (see Figure 5-1B). The 
bonds between monosaccharides are called glycosidic linkages.
Polysaccharides are classified based on the number of monosaccharides in 
the chain:
 
✓ Disaccharides are chains of two monosaccharides. Sucrose (see Figure 
5-1B), or table sugar, is a disaccharide that is probably very familiar to 
you. Another disaccharide you probably know about is lactose, the sugar 
found in milk.
 
✓ Oligosaccharides are short chains of monosaccharides (see Figure 
5-1C). Oligosaccharides are part of receptors in the plasma membranes 
of your cells.
 
✓ Polysaccharides are long chains of monosaccharides (see Figure 5-1D). 
Starch and cellulose, both shown in Figure 5-2, are two polysaccharides 
that you probably eat every day. Starch is found in bread, potatoes, rice, 
and pasta; cellulose is referred to as fiber in your diet.

Many cell types produce polysaccharides. Starch and cellulose, which are 
made by plants, are both polymers of glucose. Glycogen, made by animal 
cells, is also a polymer of glucose. Chitin, found in the shells of crustaceans 
and insects, is a polymer of a nitrogen-containing monosaccharide called 
N-acetylglucosamine. Peptidoglycan, the polysaccharide found in bacterial 
cell walls (see Chapter 2), is a polymer of two alternating monosaccharides, 
N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid.
Polysaccharides can also be different based on how their monosaccharides 
are strung together. Starch, cellulose, and glycogen are all made entirely of 
glucose, yet they behave very differently in the body. Starch and glycogen 
are easily broken down in the human digestive system. Cellulose, or fiber, 
can’t be broken down at all by humans. Instead, it passes right through your 
digestive system and exits as part of your wastes.
The difference between starch, cellulose, and glycogen isn’t what they’re 
made of, but rather in the bonds between the glucose molecules:
 
✓ The glucose molecules in starch are joined with a bond called a 
α–1,4–glycosidic linkage.
 
✓ The glucose molecules in cellulose are joined with a β–1,4–glycosidic 
linkage.
 
✓ At approximately every tenth glucose molecule, a branch is joined to the 
main backbone of glycogen by an α–1,6–glycosidic linkage. Thus, glyco-
gen molecules are highly branched.
The reason humans can digest starch and glycogen, but not cellulose, is that 
human enzymes can break down some glycosidic linkages, but not others. 
Human enzymes break down α –1,4–glycosidic linkages and α –1,6–glycosidic 
linkages, but not β –1,4–glycosidic linkages. Together, starch, cellulose, and 
glycogen demonstrate how important different types of glycosidic linkages 
can be to polysaccharide structure and function.
 
The type of glycosidic linkage between monosaccharides is very important in 
determining structure and function of polysaccharides.
Sticky and Sweet: Functions 
of Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are probably most famous for their role in providing energy 
to bodies (and, of course, cells), but they perform many other important 
functions for cells as well:

83
 Chapter 5: Carbohydrates: How Sweet They Are
 
✓ Carbohydrates are an important energy source for cells. The monosac-
charide glucose is a rapidly used energy source for almost all cells on 
planet Earth. In addition, many cell types store matter and energy for 
later use in the form of polysaccharides. Plants, algae, and bacteria store 
energy in starch, and animals and bacteria store energy in glycogen.
 
✓ Carbohydrates are important structural molecules for cells. 
Polysaccharides are the major components of the cell walls of plants, 
algae, fungi, and bacteria. The cell walls of plants and algae contain cel-
lulose, the cell walls of fungi contain chitin, and the cell walls of bacteria 
contain peptidoglycan.
 
✓ Carbohydrates are important markers of cellular identity. The surfaces 
of cells are marked with glycoproteins, molecules of protein that have 
an attached sugar. Different cells have different glycoproteins on their 
surface, marking the cells with their identity. In your body, liver cells are 
marked as liver cells, heart cells are marked as heart cells, nerve cells 
are marked as nerve cells, and so on.
 
✓ Carbohydrates are important extracellular molecules. Polysaccharides 
are a major component of the sticky matrix that surrounds cells. They 
help bacteria stick to surfaces and are also important in the attachment 
of animal cells to each other.
Splendid substitutes
Humans have taste receptors that specifically 
recognize sweet tastes. The ability to recognize 
sweets was probably an advantage in the dis-
tant past, when the ability to recognize a good 
source of energy may have meant the differ-
ence between life and death. In many developed 
nations today where refined foods are plentiful, 
however, the craving for sweets seems more 
of a curse than a blessing. So, humans search 
for a way to satisfy cravings without packing on 
the pounds.
A recent entry into the artificial sweetener game 
is sucralose. Sucralose is produced from the 
modification of sucrose. Three hydroxyl groups 
(–OH) on sucrose are replaced with chlorine 
atoms. The result is a molecule that really trig-
gers sweet receptors — sucralose tastes 600 
times sweeter than sucrose! The chemical 
modification also changes the molecule so that 
enzymes can’t break it down for energy, which 
means that sucralose passes through bodies 
undigested and has no calories.

M
ost jobs in the cell are done by proteins. To do their jobs, proteins 
must interact in a specific way with other molecules. The specific 
relationship between proteins and other molecules is based on the shape of 
the protein. Protein shape is complex and is essential to protein function. 
In this chapter, I present the basic structure of proteins and introduce their 
many functions, with a special emphasis on enzymes, membrane proteins, 
and DNA-binding proteins.
Get into Shape: Levels 
of Protein Structure
Proteins are the “movers and shakers” of the cell — whatever the job, they 
get it done. Proteins control metabolism, transport, communication, struc-
ture, division, and many other aspects of cell function. One of the things that 
makes proteins so successful is their ability to specifically target a particular 
molecule or process. Protein specificity depends upon protein structure.
Proteins begin as polymers of amino acids, shown in Figure 6-1. A polymer 
of amino acids is called a polypeptide. Once a polypeptide is folded and 
becomes functional, the polypeptide is called a protein. Some proteins are 
made of more than one folded polypeptide chain.

created based on the order of amino acids connected together.  The order of amino
acids is determined by the genetic code, which is discussed in Chapter 14.
was at R, the amino acid would be aspartic acid.
Each polypeptide is carefully folded, creating unique sections that are tai-
lored for their particular job. In fact, protein shape is so important to their 
ability to do their job that if a protein unfolds, or denatures, it will no longer 
function. Protein structure, or conformation, is fairly complex and is orga-
nized into four categories, as shown in Figure 6-2:
 
✓ Primary structure is the sequence of amino acids in the protein.
 
✓ Secondary structure are small areas that are folded into alpha helices 
and pleated sheets.
 
✓ Tertiary structure is the final 3D shape of one folded amino acid chain.
 
✓ Quarternary structure is found in proteins that consist of more than one 
folded amino acid chain.
Protein denaturation with Julia Child
Actually, you can denature proteins all on your 
own without help from a famous chef. All you 
have to do is crack an egg into a hot pan. Egg 
white is made of the protein albumin. When 
albumin is in the raw egg, it’s coiled up in its 
normal three-dimensional structure. The heat 
from the pan, however, will cause the protein to 
unfold, or denature. As it denatures, its proper-
ties change. You can see denaturation happen-
ing as the egg white turns from its translucent 
form in the raw egg to the opaque white form of 
the cooked egg.

Get in line: Primary structure
The primary structure of a protein is the sequence of amino acids in the poly-
peptide chain. Twenty amino acids exist in cells, so the choice and ordering 
of amino acids makes the primary structure of one polypeptide different from 
that of another. (The sequence of amino acids in each polypeptide is deter-
mined by the DNA code of the cell; see Chapter 18.)
Each of the 20 amino acids found in cells has the same basic structure. A 
central carbon atom in the amino acid is bonded to four different chemical 
groups:
 
✓ A nitrogen-containing amino group (–NH2 or –NH3
+)
 
✓ A carboxyl group (–COOH or –COO–)
 
✓ A hydrogen atom (–H)
 
✓ A side chain (–R) that varies between the 20 amino acids
The letter R or X represents the variable side chain of the twenty amino 
acids. The side chain can be as simple as a hydrogen atom (–H), as in the 
amino acid glycine (shown as the amino acid on the left in Figure 6-3) or more 
complicated as in the amino acid aspartic acid (refer to Figure 6-1).
 
When you’re trying to distinguish between the structures of the four groups of 
macromolecules (carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids), look for 
the characteristic N-C-C backbone of the amino acids. Polypeptide chains can 
get very complicated looking, particularly if the R groups attached to the 
amino acids are complex, but if you see a repeating pattern of N-C-C, it’s a 
good bet you’re looking at a protein.

88
Part II: Molecules: The Stuff of Life 
Amino acids are attached to each other by condensation: As a covalent bond 
is formed between the two amino acids, a water molecule is removed. (See 
Chapter 4 for more on the condensation process.) The bond between amino 
acids is called a peptide bond. Figure 6-3 shows peptide bond formation 
between the amino acid glycine (on the left) and the amino acid alanine (on 
the right).

peptide bond
 
Because peptide bonds are covalent bonds, they’re among the strongest 
bonds in cells. Extreme environmental conditions, such as increases in tem-
perature or changes in pH, can damage proteins, causing them to denature 
(unfold). Although denatured proteins can’t function, they don’t lose their pri-
mary structure: The covalent bonds are strong enough to withstand these 
types of changes in the environment of the cell.
The long and winding road: 
Secondary structure
As polypeptide chains fold up into their final structure, some areas of the 
chain form very regular folded patterns. These folded areas represent the 
secondary structure of the protein. Two patterns of folds are part of the sec-
ondary structure:
 
✓ The alpha helix twists around like a spiral staircase. To help imagine 
an alpha helix, take a string or piece of ribbon and wind it around your 
finger. The twisting spiral pattern of the string or ribbon is the same as 
that of an alpha helix.

89
 Chapter 6: Proteins: Workers in the Cellular Factory
 
✓ Pleated sheets wind back and forth. If you’ve ever hiked on a moun-
tain trail or down into the Grand Canyon, you know what a switchback 
is like. You go in one direction for a short span and then turn sharply 
and go back the other way. The same pattern of twists runs through a 
pleated sheet in a polypeptide.
The number and type of secondary structures found in a protein depend on 
the protein. Some proteins have multiple alpha helices but no pleated sheets. 
Other proteins have both structures or only pleated sheets. The structure 
depends on the protein and that protein’s function. The unique shape of each 
protein depends on what it binds to as part of its job.
Alpha helices and pleated sheets are held together with hydrogen bonds 
that form between the atoms in the backbone of the polypeptide chain. Polar 
covalent bonds within the amino acid create polar groups, allowing the for-
mation of hydrogen bonds:
 
✓ The nitrogen and hydrogen atoms in the amino groups of the amino 
acids are joined together with polar covalent bonds. Nitrogen is more 
electronegative than hydrogen, so it “hogs” the electrons and becomes 
slightly negatively charged. Hydrogen, on the other hand, develops a 
slight positive charge.
 
✓ The bond between the carbon and oxygen of the carbonyl group is 
also a polar covalent bond. In this case, oxygen is the electron hog that 
develops a slight negative charge, while the carbon atom develops a 
slight positive charge.
 
The slight positive and negative charges due to the polar covalent bonds 
develop all along the backbone of the polypeptide chain. When an alpha helix 
or pleated sheet forms, the positively charged hydrogen atoms from the 
amino groups are attracted to the negatively charged oxygen atoms of the car-
boxyl group. These weak electrical attractions act like molecular Velcro and 
hold the alpha helices and pleated sheets in their shapes.
Strong as steel, soft as silk
Spider silk is one of the strongest known natu-
ral products. The spider proteins owe their 
strength to their pleated sheets, which are held 
together with clusters of hydrogen bonds. Even 
though hydrogen bonds are 100 to 1,000 times 
weaker on the molecular level than the metallic 
bonds in steel, the arrangement of these bonds 
around the pleated sheets of spider silk gives 
the silk, pound for pound, the same strength as 
steel. Scientists are trying to discover ways to 
produce large amounts of spider silk because 
of its potential use in medicine and the defense 
industry. If they’re successful, soldiers may one 
day be able to wear bulletproof shirts that are 
as lightweight as a T-shirt!

Part II: Molecules: The Stuff of Life 
3D: Tertiary structure
The tertiary level of protein structure is the final three-dimensional shape 
of the polypeptide chain. The final shape of any polypeptide chain is unique 
and will have specific areas that are necessary for the function of the protein. 
Overall, two categories of proteins are based on overall three-dimensional 
shape:
 
✓ Globular proteins have an overall rounded or irregular shape. Many 
enzymes are globular proteins.
 
✓ Fibrous proteins are long and cable-like. Proteins important to the struc-
ture of the cell, like cytoskeletal proteins, are usually fibrous proteins.
The tertiary structure of a polypeptide chain is held together by various 
types of bonds between the atoms in the R groups of the amino acids. The 20 
different amino acids found in proteins have 20 different R groups. The differ-
ent structures of the R groups give them different properties. For example, 
some R groups are hydrophobic and don’t mix well with water, while others 
are hydrophilic and do mix with water. As the polypeptide chain twists 
and folds upon itself, the R groups that stick off of the backbone come into 
contact with each other. Depending on the structure of those two R groups, 
a bond may form between them. The types of bonds that form between R 
groups, shown in Figure 6-4, are
 
✓ Covalent bonds: The amino acid cysteine has a sulfhydryl group (–SH) 
in its R group. When the R groups from two cysteines come near each 
other in a folded polypeptide chain, they form a covalent bond called a 
disulfide bridge. “Di” means two, and disulfide bridges contain two sulfur 
atoms (–S–S–). Because they’re covalent bonds, disulfide bridges are 
strong and aren’t lost when a protein denatures.
 
✓ Ionic bonds: Some R groups ionize in the watery environment of the cell. 
When ionized R groups come near each other in a folded polypeptide chain, 
an ionic bond forms between them. In the watery environment of the cell, 
these ionic bonds are weak. They’ll be lost when a protein denatures.
 
✓ Hydrogen bonds: Some R groups contain polar covalent bonds, creating 
slight differences in positive and negative charges in the atoms. When 
atoms with a slight positive charge come near atoms with a slight nega-
tive charge, hydrogen bonds form between them. These weak bonds are 
lost when a protein denatures.
 
✓ Hydrophobic interactions: Some R groups are hydrophobic. In the watery 
environment of the cell, these R groups can get pushed together in little 
pockets inside the folded polypeptide chain, forming a hydrophobic inter-
action. These weak bonds are lost when a protein denatures.

Some polypeptide chains are functional proteins once they have folded into 
their three-dimensional structure, and they’ll begin to do their job for the 
cell. The protein lysozyme, which fights bacteria in your body, is functional 
as a single, folded polypeptide chain. Other polypeptide chains require an 
additional level of structure — quarternary structure — in order to be func-
tional proteins.
 
A group of proteins called chaperone proteins help other proteins fold cor-
rectly. The cytoplasm is full of molecules, and it would be very easy for a 
newly built protein to stick to some of these other molecules and not fold into 
its correct shape. Chaperone proteins help prevent this mistake by temporar-
ily binding to new proteins and stopping them from misfolding. Chaperone 
proteins may also give new proteins a relatively clear space in which to fold so 
that other molecules don’t get in the way.
Sometimes one is not enough: 
Quarternary structure
Some proteins are large and complex, consisting of many polypeptide chains. 
These proteins have quarternary structure. The hemoglobin that is carrying 
oxygen around in your blood right now is a protein with quarternary struc-
ture. In order to do its job for your body, each hemoglobin protein must be 

92
Part II: Molecules: The Stuff of Life 
made of four joined polypeptide chains, two of one type (alpha chains) and 
two of another (beta chains). The collagen that supports your skin is made of 
three identical polypeptide chains.
 
The bonds that hold multiple polypeptide chains together to make a protein 
are the same types of bonds that hold together the tertiary structure of pro-
teins. When polypeptide chains are brought together to build a protein with 
quarternary structure, the R groups that stick off the backbone of the different 
polypeptide chains come into contact with each other. The bond that forms 
depends on the structure of the R groups that come into contact. The possibil-
ities are the same as they are for the bonds between R groups that hold ter-
tiary structures together.
Jacks of All Trades: The Many 
Functions of Proteins
Proteins are important to the structure of the cell and carry out many jobs 
within the cell. Here are some of the important jobs that proteins do:
 
✓ Proteins are enzymes. Enzymes make chemical reactions happen faster 
(see Chapter 10).
 
✓ Proteins reinforce structures. Proteins are part of the structure of 
plasma membranes, and cytoskeletal proteins reinforce the internal 
structure of cells. Proteins in the extracellular matrix (see Chapter 2) 
support cells and proteins, such as collagen.
 
✓ Proteins transport materials into and out of the cell. Proteins in the 
plasma membrane help molecules enter and exit the cell (see Chapters 2 
and 9).
 
✓ Proteins are involved in cellular identity. Glycoproteins on cell sur-
faces act as a marker that identifies the cell type.
 
✓ Proteins help cells move. Cytoskeletal proteins power the movement of 
flagella and allow cells to crawl like amoebae (see Chapter 2).
 
✓ Proteins help cells communicate. Proteins are receptors for signals 
sent to the cell (see Chapter 9). Also, some signaling molecules, like the 
hormone insulin, are proteins.
 
✓ Proteins organize molecules within the cell. Chaperone proteins assist 
folding of new proteins and guide proteins to their proper locations 
within the cell.

93
 Chapter 6: Proteins: Workers in the Cellular Factory
 
✓ Proteins help defend the body against bacteria and viruses. Proteins 
called antibodies are key players in the immune system, helping target 
bacteria and viruses for destruction.
 
✓ Proteins regulate how DNA is used by the cell. DNA-binding proteins 
control which sections of DNA are used by the cell and which are silent 
(see Chapter 19).
Get ’Er Done: Enzymes 
Make Things Happen
Enzymes are catalysts, molecules that speed up chemical reactions (see 
Figure 6-5). Without enzymes, the reactions within the cell wouldn’t happen 
fast enough to keep cells alive. Because enzymes are necessary for the reac-
tions of the cell to happen, cells can regulate their chemistry by regulating 
their enzymes.

94
Part II: Molecules: The Stuff of Life 
Made for each other: Enzymes 
and substrates
Enzymes are very specific — each one catalyzes a particular chemical reac-
tion — because the correct folding of the enzyme creates a pocket called 
an active site that fits only certain molecules. The molecules that fit into the 
active site of an enzyme are its substrates. You can think of the enzyme as a 
lock and the substrate as the key. Only the correct key can fit into the lock, 
so the enzyme-substrate relationship is very specific.
 
The relationship between enzyme and substrate is actually not quite like that 
of a lock and key. Locks don’t shift or change in response to their key, but 
enzymes do change slightly in response to their substrate. When the substrate 
first binds into the active site, the fit between enzyme and substrate is not per-
fect. But when weak bonds form between the substrate and the R groups of 
the enzyme, the enzyme changes it shape slightly, strengthening the attrac-
tions between the substrate and the active site. This view of enzyme-substrate 
interaction is called the induced fit model because the enzyme is induced to fit 
more closely around the substrate. The enzyme with its induced fit allows the 
chemical reaction of the substrate(s) to occur by lowering the energy needed 
(activation energy) for the reaction.
Listening to others: Inhibiting enzymes
Cells can determine whether a particular metabolic pathway is turned on or 
off by controlling the enzymes that catalyze the reactions in the pathway. 
You can think of the enzymes in a metabolic pathway as a bunch of assembly 
line workers in a factory. As the product comes down the assembly line, each 
worker must make an adjustment to it in order for the product to be ready 
for the next worker. If you were to tell one of the workers in the line to take 
a break, production would stop at that point in the line. Enzyme regulation 
works exactly the same way — if an enzyme is prevented from functioning, 
the entire metabolic pathway shuts down as a result.
Enzymes are controlled by regulatory molecules that bind to the substrate. 
The two main types of enzyme regulation (see Figure 6-6) are as follows:
 
✓ Competitive inhibition occurs when a molecule that is similar in shape 
to the substrate enters the active site and gets in the way of catalysis. 
The regulatory molecule, called a competitive inhibitor, isn’t the right 
shape for the reaction to actually occur; it just prevents the real sub-
strate from entering. In other words, the competitive inhibitor competes 
with the substrate for the active site.

95
 Chapter 6: Proteins: Workers in the Cellular Factory
 
✓ Noncompetitive or allosteric inhibition occurs when a regulatory 
molecule binds to a site other than the active site of the enzyme. When 
enzymes fold up into their three-dimensional shape, they can have more 
than one pocket into which molecules can bind. Binding sites other than 
the active site are called allosteric sites. Molecules that bind to allosteric 
sites to regulate enzymes are called noncompetitive inhibitors. When 
noncompetitive inhibitors bind to allosteric sites, they cause slight 
shape changes in the enzyme. These shape changes affect the active site 
as well, which means the substrate can no longer bind to the enzyme.
 
Figure 6-6: 
Enzyme 
inhibition.

The most common way that cells regulate their metabolic pathways is 
through feedback inhibition or end product inhibition (see Figure 6-7). During 
feedback inhibition, an end product of a pathway acts as the noncompetitive 
inhibitor of an enzyme in that pathway. Think about it: If you were manag-
ing a production plant, how would you know when it was time to slow pro-
duction? Your biggest clue would probably be if you had too much of your 
product on your hands. If that were the case, you’d probably slow produc-
tion until demand caught up with supply, right? This same principle drives 
feedback inhibition. If a cell has made enough of a product, then lots of those 
molecules will be floating around in the cell. The simplest way to enact a 
slowdown in production is for that product itself to bind the allosteric site on 
an enzyme and shut it down. When the cell uses up the product, there won’t 
be any excess to bind to the enzyme, and production will start up again.

Gatekeepers: Membrane Proteins
The plasma membrane is the barrier between the cell and its environment. 
Like the border between two countries, the plasma membrane is a busy 
place. Signals arrive at the membrane with messages for the cell, molecules 

97
 Chapter 6: Proteins: Workers in the Cellular Factory
seek to cross in and out, and defensive proteins from the immune system 
wander by to make sure that everything is okay inside the cell.
The proteins that make up almost 50 percent of the plasma membrane are 
responsible for coordinating all activity at the plasma membrane. Some of 
the proteins span the entire membrane; others are associated with one side 
or the other. Membrane proteins, shown in Figure 6-8, perform all the follow-
ing jobs:
 
✓ Transport proteins help molecules cross the membrane. Some pro-
teins provide open channels for small molecules to pass through, while 
others bind specifically to certain molecules and move them across (see 
Chapter 9).
 
✓ Receptor proteins receive signals on the outside of the cell and relay the 
message to the inside of the cell. Chemical signals that bind to receptors 
are called ligands.
 
✓ Adhesion proteins form connections between the outside and the inside 
of the cell. On the outside of the cell, they bind to molecules in the extra-
cellular matrix (see Chapter 9), while on the inside of the cell they bind 
to cytoskeletal proteins (see Chapter 2).
 
✓ Identity proteins are glycoproteins that stick out of the cell and label 
the cell with its function and identity.
 
✓ Enzymes are also associated with membranes. They may catalyze reac-
tions that are part of processes occurring within the membrane or they 
be involved in passing signals from receptor proteins to the inside of the 
cell.

I’m in Charge: DNA-Binding Proteins
The genetic code that contains the instructions for all the structures and 
functions of the cell is in the form of DNA. So, it would seem that DNA is the 
most powerful molecule in the cell, right? In some ways, DNA is the most 
powerful, but it’s not as simple as that. Certain proteins, called DNA-binding 
proteins (see Figure 6-9), can actually control which parts of the DNA are 
being read and which are silenced.
 
Just as enzymes have active sites that are shaped to fit their substrates, DNA-
binding proteins have binding sites, called DNA-binding domains, that are 
shaped to fit DNA. The alpha helices and pleated sheets within the DNA-
binding domains fit into the grooves of the DNA molecules. Like other pro-
teins, DNA-binding proteins are very specific, so DNA-binding domains must 
be able to recognize a specific target sequence.
Several types of DNA binding proteins are known. Each type has a slightly 
different structure in its DNA-binding region. These different structures have 
been found again and again as new proteins are discovered, appearing like 
a repeating pattern, or motif, in DNA-binding proteins. The most common 
motifs found in DNA-binding proteins are listed here:
Finding your perfect match
You probably know that if a person needs an 
organ transplant, doctors must find a “close 
match” between the donor and the recipi-
ent. But what exactly are the doctors trying to 
match?
Well, it turns out that a group of membrane 
proteins called the Major Histocompatibility 
Complex (MHC) marks your cells as your cells. 
If a person receives a transplant of someone 
else’s cells as part of an organ and the MHC 
proteins don’t match, their body will reject the 
organ as foreign. So, doctors must look for a 
donor whose MHC proteins are as close as 
possible in structure to those of the recipient. 
And even then, the little differences in the MHC 
proteins are still recognized by the body, so the 
recipient needs to remain on immunosuppres-
sant drugs for the rest of their life.
Some day, scientists hope to be able to grow 
organs in the lab from a person’s own stem 
cells. That way, the proteins on the surface 
would be a perfect match! (By the way, I know 
Major Histocompatibility Complex seems like 
a mouthful. But it really means what is says. 
“Histo” = “tissue.” So, Major Histocompatibility 
Complex means “the most important complex 
of proteins for determining whether two tissues 
will be compatible.”)

✓ Helix turn helix motifs have two alpha helices connected by a short 
stretch of amino acids that forms a turn between the two helices. The 
helix turn helix motif is common in prokaryotic DNA-binding proteins.
 
✓ Zinc finger motifs have an alpha helix and two pleated sheets held 
together with a zinc atom. The zinc finger motif is common in eukaryotic 
DNA-binding proteins that regulate transcription. (For details on how 
DNA-binding proteins regulate transcription, see Chapter 19.)
 
✓ Leucine zipper motifs have two alpha helices that cross over each 
other. The two helices are held together by the hydrophobic interac-
tions between the R groups on the amino acid leucine. The leucine 
zipper motif is common in eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins that regulate 
transcription.

D
eoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) makes up the genetic code of all cells, 
determining their characteristics by specifying the construction of pro-
teins and molecules of ribonucleic acid (RNA). DNA and RNA are both nucleic 
acids, which are polymers of nucleotides. In this chapter, I present the struc-
ture of DNA and RNA, as well as introduce the functions of these important 
nucleic acids.
It’s Puzzling: Structure of Nucleic Acids
Nucleic acids are the information molecules of cells. The most famous nucleic 
acid is undoubtedly deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. You probably know that 
your DNA contains your genetic code, all the messages that determine your 
traits. Another type of nucleic acid, ribonucleic acid, or RNA, is less well 
known, but also important to cells.
All nucleic acids are polymers, consisting of long chains of repeating mono-
mers like beads on a string. However, nucleic acids look far more complex 
than either polysaccharides or polypeptides. Nucleic acid structure is com-
plex for several reasons:
 
✓ The monomer of nucleic acids is the nucleotide. Nucleotides have 
three different components, so they’re pretty complicated even before 
they get strung into chains.

102
Part II: Molecules: The Stuff of Life 
 
✓ Nucleic acids may be single-stranded or double-stranded. When 
nucleotides are strung together, they form polynucleotide chains. RNA 
consists of a single polynucleotide chain. In cells, DNA consists of two 
polynucleotide chains wound together to form a double helix.
Although nucleotides are the building blocks of nucleic acids, nucleotides 
themselves are built from three different components:
 
✓ A pentose (5-carbon) sugar: In DNA, the sugar is deoxyribose. In RNA, 
the sugar is ribose.
 
✓ A nitrogenous base: Nitrogenous bases are single- or double-ring struc-
tures that contain several nitrogen atoms.
 
✓ A phosphate group: Phosphate groups consist of a phosphorous atom 
surrounded by oxygen atoms. They’re negatively charged, which gives 
nucleotides and nucleic acids an overall negative charge as well.
Navigating nucleotides
To help navigate the structure of nucleotides, scientists use the following 
numbering system for the carbon atoms in the sugar of the nucleotide:
 
✓ The carbon atoms in the sugar are numbered sequentially from one to 
five.
 
✓ The numbered carbons are also given the designation of prime, making 
them 1', 2', 3', 4', and 5'. The prime mark (') distinguishes the carbon 
atoms in the sugar from the carbon atoms in the nitrogenous base, 
which are also numbered.
 
✓ The first carbon, called the one prime carbon, is the carbon atom that is 
attached to the nitrogenous base (Figure 7-1).
 
✓ The rest of the carbon atoms in the sugar are numbered consecutively, 
moving away from the oxygen in the ring. As an example, the 3' and 5' 
carbon atoms are labeled in the nucleotide shown in Figure 7-1.
The sugars in the nucleotides that make up DNA and RNA differ slightly. DNA 
contains the sugar deoxyribose, while RNA contains the sugar ribose. These 
sugars are both pentose (5-carbon) sugars and are identical except for the 
presence of one oxygen atom. Ribose has a hydroxyl group (–OH) attached 
to its 2' carbon, whereas deoxyribose has only a hydrogen atom (–H). The 
nucleotide shown in Figure 7-1 contains ribose, so it’s a ribonucleotide, a 
nucleotide that would be used to build RNA molecules. Nucleotides that build 
DNA are called deoxyribonucleotides.

Naming the nucleotide bases
Five different nitrogenous bases are found in nucleotides (see Figure 7-2): 
adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), thymine (T), and uracil (U). Each 
nucleotide is slightly different depending on which nitrogenous base is part 
of its structure. 
As an example, the nucleotide in Figure 7-1 contains the nitrogenous base 
adenine, which makes the nucleotide adenosine monophosphate. The nucle-
otides that make up DNA molecules contain adenine, guanine, cytosine, and 
thymine, whereas the nucleotides that make up RNA molecules contain gua-
nine, cytosine, adenine, and uracil.
Nitrogenous bases fall into two groups, shown in Figure 7-2:
 
✓ Pyrimidines (cytosine, thymine, and uracil) have a single-ring structure 
with two nitrogen atoms within the ring.
 
✓ Purines (adenine and guanine) have two fused rings with two nitrogen 
atoms within each ring.

Recognizing nucleotides
Here are some tricks to help you recognize nucleotides and their components:
 
✓ To tell the difference between ribose and deoxyribose, look at the 2' 
carbon. If no oxygen is attached, it’s deoxyribose.
 
✓ The nitrogenous bases with the longer name (pyrimidines) are actually 
the smaller molecule (one ring instead of two).

105
 Chapter 7: DNA and RNA: Instructions for Life
 
✓ Within the pyrimidines, only thymine (T) has a methyl group (–CH3). 
(Remember that there is a T in methyl.) Cytosine (C) has an amino 
group (–NH2) attached to its ring. (Remember that cytosine rhymes with 
amine.)
 
✓ Within the purines, guanine has a double-bonded oxygen attached to 
one of its rings. Remember that if you close the circle on a G, it looks like 
an O.
Making DNA and RNA
Nucleotides are joined together by condensation. (For more on condensa-
tion, see Chapter 4.) The phosphate group attached to the 5' end of one 
nucleotide is joined to the 3' carbon of the nucleotide on the growing chain 
(see Figure 7-3). A water molecule is removed as the bonds are formed 
between the two nucleotides. This process is repeated, forming a polynucle-
otide chain. The order and type of nucleotides in a polynucleotide strand 
make up its primary structure. The order of nitrogenous bases within a poly-
nucleotide chain is also called its sequence. All polynucleotide chains have 
certain key characteristics:

✓ A sugar-phosphate backbone made from the alternating sugars and 
phosphate groups in the chain (see Figure 7-3).
 
✓ Nitrogenous bases that project outward from the sugar-phosphate 
backbone.
 
✓ 5' to 3' polarity where one end of the chain is very different than the 
other. At one end of the chain is a phosphate group, attached to the 5' 
carbon of the topmost sugar. This end is called the 5' end of the strand. 
At the other end of the chain is a hydroxyl group (–OH) attached to the 
3' carbon of the lowermost sugar. This end is called the 3' end of the 
strand.
Both DNA and RNA are made of polynucleotide chains, but the two types of 
molecules are unique. Three major differences exist between DNA and RNA:
 
✓ DNA contains the nitrogenous base thymine, while RNA contains uracil. 
(Both contain adenine, guanine, and cytosine.)
 
✓ DNA nucleotides have the sugar deoxyribose, while RNA nucleotides 
have ribose.
 
✓ DNA molecules are double-stranded, while RNA molecules are single-
stranded.
The double helix of DNA
Polynucleotide chains interact with each other and with themselves to give 
nucleic acids three-dimensional shape, called their secondary structure. The 
secondary structure of DNA is a double helix. Two polynucleotide chains join 
together, forming a molecule with the shape of a twisted ladder. The sides 
of the ladder are made of the sugar phosphate backbones of the two strands 
(see Figure 7-4). The nitrogenous bases project off of the sugar-phosphate 
backbone and join together by hydrogen bonds, forming the “rungs” of the 
ladder.
The two chains of the double helix are antiparallel to each other, meaning 
that they’re opposite in polarity. If you hold one of the strands so that its 5’ 
end was up, then its partner strand would have its 5’ pointing down. In other 
words, the two strands are upside down relative to each other. This position 
is the only way the two strands fit together.
 
When polynucleotide chains bond together, they’re always antiparallel to each 
other.

107
 Chapter 7: DNA and RNA: Instructions for Life

The twisted 
ladder 
model of the 
double helix 
of DNA.
 
P = phosphate
S = sugar
A = adenine
T = thymine
C = cytosine
G = guanine
The two antiparallel strands of DNA are held together by hydrogen bonds 
between their nitrogenous bases. In order for the hydrogen bonds to form, 
the atoms of the nitrogenous bases must be lined up with each other in just 
the right way, which happens only when certain bases come together. Adenine 
(A) forms hydrogen bonds with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) forms hydrogen 
bonds with guanine (G). You can think of the bases like puzzle pieces that 
fit together a certain way: In DNA, A fits only with T, and C fits only with G. 
Scientists say that A is complementary to T, and C is complementary to G. When 
these bases match up, they form complementary base pairs.The base pairing 
rules for DNA are A=T and C=G.
 
Each turn of the double helix is about ten base pairs in length. The distance 
between each base pair is 0.34 nanometers (nm). As the DNA molecule twists 
around, the distances between the sugar phosphate backbones vary. When 
they’re farther apart, they make a major groove. When they’re closer together, 
they make a minor groove. One major and one minor groove alternate with 
each other in a single turn of the helix. One complete turn of the helix is 3.4 
nm long. The diameter of a strand of DNA is 2.0 nm.

108
Part II: Molecules: The Stuff of Life 
Shaping up RNA molecules
RNA molecules are made of single polynucleotide chains, but they can also 
have three-dimensional secondary structure. Some RNA molecules fold 
around upon themselves into complex shapes. The shapes are held together 
by hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases within the same strand. 
As in DNA, the nitrogenous bases within an RNA molecule can hydrogen 
bond to each other if they fit together just right. In RNA, cytosine (C) can 
form hydrogen bonds with guanine (G), and adenine (A) can form hydrogen 
bonds with uracil (U). Thus, the base-pairing rules for RNA are C=G and A=U.
Breaking the Code: The Function 
of DNA and RNA
DNA and RNA molecules are involved in information storage and retrieval in 
cells. DNA stores the information that ultimately determines the character-
istics of cells and organisms. The information is written in a chemical code 
determined by the order of nitrogenous bases within the DNA. You can think of 
the four bases (A, T, C, and G) like letters of the alphabet being used to write a 
coded message. When cells decode the DNA message, it provides instructions 
for important cell structures and functions, including the following:
 
✓ Protein structure is determined by the sequence of nucleotides in DNA. 
Through the processes of transcription and translation, the code in DNA 
is copied and used to specify the sequence of amino acids (primary 
structure) in polypeptide chains. (For more on transcription and transla-
tion, see Chapter 19.)
 
✓ RNA structure is also determined by the sequence of nucleotides in 
DNA. Through the process of transcription, the sequence of nucleotides 
in DNA is used to build RNA molecules.
 
✓ Regulation of DNA occurs by the interaction between DNA-binding pro-
teins (see Chapter 6) and special regulatory sequences of DNA. These 
interactions control the organization and retrieval of information from 
DNA molecules.
Several types of RNA molecules are built from the information in DNA. Each 
type of RNA has a different function in cells:
 
✓ Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries the code for protein structure from 
the DNA to ribosomes where it can be used to produce proteins. (See 
Chapter 19 for more on this function.)

109
 Chapter 7: DNA and RNA: Instructions for Life
 
✓ Transfer RNA (tRNA) decodes the message in mRNA by matching amino 
acids to the mRNA code. (See Chapter 19 for more on this function.)
 
✓ Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is part of the structure of the ribosome.
Jurassic DNA
In the movie Jurassic Park, scientists retrieved 
pieces of dinosaur DNA from mosquitoes pre-
served in amber and used that DNA to bring 
dinosaurs back to life. Was this fiction or future 
fact?
Well, mostly fiction, but maybe a little bit of 
future fact. Scientists have tried to recover 
ancient DNA from amber, but so far no one has 
been successful. (Some scientists have claimed 
to recover DNA from amber, but no other scien-
tists have been able to repeat this work — and 
in science, it’s a deal breaker when your work 
can’t be repeated.) It turns out that contamina-
tion with DNA from living fungi and bacteria is 
a significant problem when scientists are trying 
to make copies of the fossil DNA from amber.
So far, scientists have been much more suc-
cessful in getting ancient DNA that has been 
frozen in permafrost from places like Antarctica 
and Greenland. By comparing ancient DNA to 
the DNA of organisms that are alive today, sci-
entists can figure out what kind of DNA has 
been isolated.
The oldest DNA extracted so far came from 
ice sheets on Greenland and is estimated as 
being between 450,000 and 800,000 years old. 
Comparisons to existing organisms reveal that 
Greenland was covered with forests of yew, 
pine, spruce, and alder trees, very similar to 
those currently found in Canada. The DNA of 
beetles, spiders, flies, and butterflies that lived 
in these forests was also recovered.

In This Chapter
▶ Constructing lipids
▶ Comparing saturated and unsaturated fats
▶ Exploring the functions of lipids
L
ipids are molecules that don’t mix well with water. Many types of lipids 
are made by cells, including fats, phospholipids, waxes, and sterols. In 
this chapter, I cover the structure of the different groups of lipids and then 
introduce their functions in cells.
Hydrocarbons: Structure of Lipids
You may not have ever heard the term lipids, but you’ve certainly heard of 
many of the molecules that fall into this group, including fats, oils, waxes, 
cholesterol, and steroids. You may even have heard the term hydrocar-
bons when getting results from an emissions check on your automobile. 
Hydrocarbons, including gasoline and other lipids, are molecules that have 
long chains of carbon atoms bonded to hydrogen atoms. (Unfortunately, if 
you have hydrocarbons in your automobile emissions, it means your car isn’t 
burning its fuel efficiently, and you’re going to need some repairs.)
All lipid molecules have one thing in common: They’re hydrophobic, meaning 
that they don’t mix well with water. When you wax your snowboard or your 
car, you’re taking advantage of this characteristic to create a barrier against 
water. Lipids are hydrophobic because they contain many nonpolar covalent 
bonds such as those between carbon and hydrogen (for more on nonpolar 
covalent bonds, see Chapter 4).

112
Part II: Molecules: The Stuff of Life 
As a group, lipids are more diverse in structure than the other three groups 
of macromolecules (carbohydrates, proteins, and nucleic acids). Also unlike 
the other macromolecules, lipids aren’t polymers. Based on their structures, 
lipids are organized into several subcategories:
 
✓ Fats and oils are very similar in structure to each other. They’re made of 
fatty acids attached to a glycerol backbone.
 
✓ Phospholipids are also made of fatty acids attached to a glycerol back-
bone. However, they also have a unique hydrophilic head group.
 
✓ Waxes are made from fatty acids attached to long-chain alcohols.
 
✓ Sterols contain four fused carbon rings.
Saturating fatty acids
Fatty acids are long chains of carbon and hydrogen that are components of 
some types of lipids. Fatty acids are described as saturated and unsaturated. 
These terms describe the way carbon atoms in fatty acid chains are bonded 
to each other and with hydrogen:
 
✓ In saturated fats, the carbon atoms in the fatty acids are bonded to each 
other with single bonds. Because carbon atoms form four bonds, each 
carbon atom in a saturated fat can also bond to two hydrogen atoms.
 
✓ In unsaturated fats, the carbon atoms are bonded to each other with 
more double bonds. The carbon atoms involved in a double bond can 
bond to only one hydrogen atom.
As an example of saturated and unsaturated bonds, look at the fatty acids in 
the typical fat shown in Figure 8-1. The top fatty acid in the fat molecule has 
saturated bonds: The bonds between the carbon atoms are single bonds, and 
each carbon atom is bonded to at least two hydrogen atoms. In other words, 
the carbon atoms are saturated with as many hydrogen atoms as they can hold.
The bottom fatty acid in the fat molecule has two unsaturated bonds: The 
carbon atoms are bonded to each other with double bonds, and each of 
these double-bonded carbon atoms is bonded to only one hydrogen atom. 
They aren’t saturated with as many hydrogen atoms as they could potentially 
hold, so they’re unsaturated.

Forming fats and oils
Fats and oils form when three fatty acids are joined to a glycerol backbone 
(see Figure 8-2). Fats and oils are also called triglycerides because of the three 
fatty acids. Glycerol is a three-carbon alcohol, with a hydroxyl radical (–OH) 
attached to each carbon. Fatty acids are long chains of carbon atoms bonded 
to hydrogen atoms, making them very hydrophobic.

Part II: Molecules: The Stuff of Life 
Each fatty acid is attached to glycerol in a condensation reaction, leading to 
the removal of a water molecule as the bond is formed. At one end of a fatty 
acid molecule is a carboxyl group. When fatty acids are attached to glycerol 
molecules during the formation of a fat, the carbon atom from the carboxyl 
group forms a bond with an oxygen in the glycerol molecules.
When you’re trying to recognize lipid molecules, remember the word hydro-
carbon. Lipids have lots of carbon-hydrogen bonds, and few polar groups, 
such as hydroxyl radicals (–OH) or nitrogen-hydrogen bonds. Also, fat and oil 
molecules look like a big letter E.
Triglycerides that contain high levels of saturated bonds are called fats; 
those that have more unsaturated bonds are called oils. Fats are solid 
at room temperature because the saturated fatty acid tails tend to pack 
together in an organized way, making the fats tighter and more solid. Oils 
are liquid at room temperature because the unsaturated fatty acid tails have 
more kinks in them, preventing them from packing together very well. So, oils 
are looser and more liquid.
In terms of health, you probably already know that you should avoid eating 
saturated fats as much as possible. Animal fats, such as those in dairy prod-
ucts and meat, are usually saturated. Plant and fish oils, such as those in nuts 
and fish, are usually unsaturated.
Looking at other types of lipids
Fats and oils are probably the best known lipids, but other types of lipids are 
also important cellular components. Some lipids are similar in structure to 
triglycerides, but others are quite different.
Phospholipids, shown in Figure 8-3, are similar in structure to triglycerides 
and also form by condensation reactions between glycerol and fatty acids. 
The difference between phospholipids and triglycerides is that phospholip-
ids have only two fatty acid tails. In place of the third fatty acid, they have a 
head group that contains nitrogen and phosphate.
The negative charges within the phosphate, combined with the polar bonds 
between nitrogen and hydrogen atoms, make the head group of a phospho-
lipids hydrophilic (Chapter 4). The fatty acid tails, however, have nonpolar 
bonds between carbon and hydrogen and are hydrophobic. Thus, phospho-
lipids have a split personality — one end of the molecule, the hydrophilic 
head, is attracted to water, while the other end, the hydrophobic tails, is 
repelled by water. The word for this split personality, when a molecule has 
both polar and nonpolar areas, is amphipathic.

Waxes are formed from fatty acids and long chain alcohols. They’re basically 
very long carbon chains with lots of nonpolar carbon hydrogen bonds. If you 
imagine two very long fatty acids hooked together with a few oxygen atoms 
in the middle where they’re joined, you’d have a pretty good picture of what 
a wax looks like.
Sterols are made of four fused carbon rings (see Figure 8-4). As in the other 
categories of lipids, the rings contain lots of nonpolar carbon hydrogen 
bonds, making sterols hydrophobic. The sterols include some fairly famous 
molecules, such as the steroid hormones testosterone and estrogen, as well 
as cholesterol and vitamin D.

Margarine is usually made from corn oil, but mar-
garine is a solid. To turn corn oil into a solid form, 
guess what you have to do: Hydrogenate it — add 
hydrogen atoms to the fatty acid tails, caus-
ing the bonding to change from double bonds 
into single bonds. In other words, you need to 
change your corn oil into a saturated fat.
So, if unsaturated fats, like those in corn oil, are 
healthy, and saturated fats, like those in butter, 
are unhealthy, where does margarine fit in? 
Chemically speaking, a saturated fat is a satu-
rated fat no matter how you got there, so really 
traditional margarine is nutritionally about the 
same as butter.
This explanation may lead you to wonder why 
margarine is around at all. The answer goes 
back to World War II and food rationing. There 
just wasn’t enough butter to go around, so com-
panies started making margarine (or oleomar-
garine, called oleo for short). When margarine 
was first produced, it was white in color like 
vegetable shortening, but people didn’t like its 
appearance, so the companies started includ-
ing a packet of yellow dye with the margarine. 
When you bought your margarine, you had to 
mix your own dye in to make it look like butter. 
When food rationing due to the war ended, the 
companies that made margarine wanted to stay 
in business, so they started marketing their 
product as healthier than butter. The butter 
companies counterattacked, leading to many 
years of ad campaigns pitting “natural” butter 
against “healthier” margarine.
Today, margarine and butter are seen as about 
equal nutritionally with personal choice based 
on flavor and price. The dreaded fat today is 
the trans fat, which is a fat that has only been 
partially hydrogenated. Trans fats are linked to 
heart disease and should be avoided in your 
diet. Ironically, these fats used to occur in 
margarine as a byproduct of the hydrogena-
tion process. (Back when margarine was being 
marketed as healthier, it probably actually 
wasn’t.) Now, many food production practices 
have changed to eliminate these fats, and prod-
ucts are labeled as being free from trans fats. 
Today, diet and nutrition advisors say the best 
choice is to use “healthy fats” whenever pos-
sible. By “healthy fats,” the diet and nutrition 
industry really means “healthy oils” — in other 
words, oils from fish and plants.

You Say Fat Like It’s a Bad 
Thing: Functions of Lipids
Bonds between carbon and hydrogen atoms have a lot of useful energy for 
cells. Because they have so many carbon-hydrogen bonds, lipids are a great 
way to store a lot of energy in a relatively small package. For example, you 
may know that fats have 9 calories per gram, while carbohydrates and proteins 
have only about 5 calories per gram. (A calorie is a measure of energy.) Clearly, 
fats are the winner among macromolecules in the energy efficiency category. 
So, energy storage is one of the major functions of lipids in cells. Energy storage 
is the reason that plants make oils and that people pack on extra pounds of 
fat when they eat more and exercise less.
Quest for oil
Recent human history demonstrates the 
value of lipids for energy storage. Since the 
Industrial Revolution, industrialized countries 
have sought far and wide for the energy to fuel 
the lifestyles of their people. One of the most 
useful forms of this energy is oil.
Unfortunately, the human desire for oil spawned 
the whaling industry and led to the near extinc-
tion of several whale species as they were 
killed for their oil-rich blubber. More recently, 
people have fueled their economies with an 
energy-rich oil legacy left to them by cells of the 
past. And now, as oil deposits within the Earth 
begin to run low, people are realizing they need 
to again seek another source of energy. One 
part of the solution to this energy crisis may be 
to find a new source of oil — this time, growing 
oil-rich crops so that people can create biofuels 
such as biodiesel.

118
Part II: Molecules: The Stuff of Life 
In addition to energy storage, lipids have other important functions for cells 
and organisms. The major functions of lipids are as follows:
 
✓ Insulation by fat is common in many animals. In humans, fat acts as a 
shock-absorbing layer between the organs and as an insulator around 
nerve cells (like plastic coating on copper wires). Some animals, such 
as whales, polar bears, and seals, can survive cold temperatures due to 
their insulating fat layers.
 
✓ The structure of plasma membranes is large due to the structure of phos-
pholipids. Plasma membranes are made from two layers of phospholipids 
that form a bilayer with the hydrophilic heads on the outside of the 
membrane and the hydrophobic tails pointing inward. Cholesterol is 
also a component of animal plasma membranes.
 
✓ Water-proofing by waxes is used by plants to protect their leaves from 
damage and by water birds to keep their feathers dry.
 
✓ Signaling by steroid hormones, such as testosterone and estrogen, 
causes important developmental changes in humans.

C
ells have lots of work to do to keep life happening. 
Cells take in energy from their environment and 
transfer it into forms that the cell can use to fuel this 
work, converting one molecule to another through cellu-
lar metabolism. Some cells make the food that all cells 
rely upon as their source of energy and building materials. 
Cells grow, move, and communicate with each other.
Cells make new cells, sometimes to repair damaged tissue, 
sometimes to reproduce themselves. In this part, I explain 
the working cell, what cells need to function, how they 
supply those needs, and how they reproduce themselves.

C
ells live in complex environments surrounded by signals from the 
environment and from other cells. Cells take in materials from their 
environment by moving them across their plasma membranes. Cells interact 
with each other, sending and receiving signals that cause changes in cellular 
behavior. In this chapter, I present the types of transport that occur across 
cell membranes, the types of attachments that form between cells, and the 
ways in which cells send and receive signals.
Shipping and Receiving: Transport 
Across Membranes
Just as your skin defines your body, the plasma membrane of cells defines 
the boundary of the cell. Materials can enter and exit the cell only if the plasma 
membrane allows it; in other words, the plasma membrane is selectively perme-
able. Two major factors determine whether a molecule can cross the plasma 
membrane:
 
✓ Size: Smaller molecules cross more easily than larger ones.
 
✓ Attraction to water: Hydrophobic (nonpolar) molecules cross more 
easily than hydrophilic (polar) molecules. The hydrophobic molecules 
can pass through the hydrophobic interior of the phosopholipid bilayer 
that makes up the membrane. Hydrophilic molecules and ions need help 
from proteins in order to cross the membrane.

122
Part III: The Working Cell 
Getting past the bouncer
Transport proteins in the plasma membrane control what is allowed to 
enter and exit the cell. Although some small, hydrophobic molecules such 
as carbon dioxide (CO2) can scoot through the phospholipid bilayer without 
help, most molecules are either too big or too polar to cross without a trans-
port protein. Even tiny ions like potassium ions (K+), sodium ions (Na+), and 
chloride ions (Cl–) are too attracted to water to pass through the hydropho-
bic interior of the membrane on their own. Small molecules such as simple 
sugars are also too large and too polar to cross without a transport protein. 
Different types of cells control which materials enter and exit the cell by 
having different types of transport proteins in their plasma membranes.
Which way should I go?
If more of a molecule is on one side of a membrane than the other, the mol-
ecules will move across the membrane until they’re evenly distributed across 
the membrane (see Figure 9-1).
 
Diffusion is the movement of molecules from an area of higher concentration 
to an area of lower concentration. Diffusion is a passive process and requires 
no energy to be input from the cell.
Diffusion happens because a random distribution of molecules is more ener-
getically favorable than an organized distribution (see Chapter 10). When the 
molecules are randomly distributed, they have reached equilibrium.
 
Figure 9-1: 
Diffusion of

123
 Chapter 9: Hello, Neighbor: How Cells Communicate
Crossing the border
If a molecule can cross a plasma membrane, the molecule will diffuse across 
the membrane until it reaches equilibrium. Diffusion can happen with or 
without the help of a transport protein (see Figure 9-2). Diffusion is divided 
into two categories depending on whether a protein is involved:
 
✓ Simple diffusion occurs when molecules diffuse across membranes 
without any help from transport proteins.
 
✓ Facilitated diffusion occurs when molecules diffuse across membranes 
with the help of transport proteins.
 
Figure 9-2: 
Transport

membranes.
 
ATP
Passive transport
Facilitated diffusion
Diffusion
Active transport
Transport proteins facilitate the diffusion of molecules by helping molecules 
cross the hydrophilic center of the membrane. Two types of transport pro-
teins help with diffusion, and each type helps in a slightly different way:
 
✓ Channel proteins are proteins that are built like soda straws. The poly-
peptide chains of these proteins loop around and around to build the 
walls of the straw, creating an open tunnel down the middle of the 

124
Part III: The Working Cell 
protein. When channel proteins are inserted into a membrane, they form 
tunnels filled with water through the membrane. Small hydrophilic mol-
ecules can cross plasma membranes by traveling through the tunnels 
made by channel proteins. Some channel proteins remain open all the 
time, while others, known as gated channels, open and close in response 
to signals.
 
✓ Carrier proteins transport specific molecules across membranes. Each 
carrier protein has a binding site that is the right shape for the molecule 
that it can transport. When the right molecule binds to the carrier protein, 
the protein changes shape and moves the molecule to the other side 
of the membrane.
Going with the flow
Water also diffuses across membranes. The diffusion of water, called osmosis, 
follows the rules of diffusion: Water moves from an area where water is more 
concentrated to an area where water is less concentrated. Osmosis is a 
passive process that requires no energy input from the cell.
 
Thinking about osmosis in terms of water concentration can be a little hard to 
wrap your head around: Water is more concentrated when fewer solutes are 
dissolved in the water. In other words, water is most concentrated where 
water is most pure. So water moves from where water is most pure to areas 
where water is less pure.
If thinking about water concentration gives you a headache, you can think of 
osmosis in terms of solute concentration instead: Water moves to the area 
of greater solutes. Whichever way you like to think about it, the result is the 
same: Water molecules become more randomly distributed by osmosis.
The relative solute concentrations on either side of a cellular membrane 
determine the movement of water molecules by osmosis and can greatly 
impact the functioning of the cell. Three terms describe the relative concen-
trations across membranes:
 
✓ Hypertonic solutions have a greater concentration of solutes.
 
✓ Hypotonic solutions have a lesser concentration of solutes.
 
✓ Isotonic solutions have the same concentration of solutes.
If cells are in an environment that has a different solute concentration than 
the cytoplasm, water will move into or out of the cell by osmosis. For example, 
for thousands of years people have used salt to preserve food. When food is 
placed in salt, any bacteria on the surface of the food become surrounded by 
a hypertonic environment. Water travels by osmosis out of the bacterial cells, 
and the bacterial cells become shriveled inside their cell walls like deflated 

125
 Chapter 9: Hello, Neighbor: How Cells Communicate
balloons. Although the bacteria may not die, they can’t grow, multiply, and 
eat the food, effectively preserving the food for the people who salted it in 
the first place.
Osmosis also affects people who suffer from diabetes. The blood of diabetics 
can become full of sugars because their cells don’t receive the insulin signal 
to remove sugar from the blood. When the blood becomes hypertonic to the 
person’s cells, water moves by osmosis into the blood. The water is filtered 
out of the blood by the kidneys, and the diabetic person produces lots of 
urine. Because too much water is being filtered out of their bodies, diabetics 
can become dangerously dehydrated.
In a normally functioning body, cells carefully control the levels of solutes 
inside and outside of the cell. When cells are in an isotonic environment, 
water moves equally in and out of the cell.
It’s an uphill battle
Cells often need to move molecules from areas where the molecules are less 
concentrated to areas where they’re more concentrated. In other words, cells 
need to move molecules against their concentration gradient. You can think of 
this type of transport as cells adding to their stockpile of certain molecules.
 
Cells move molecules against their concentration gradient by active transport 
(refer to Figure 9-2). Active transport requires the input of energy from the cell, 
which is usually provided by the energy molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP).
During active transport, carrier proteins pick up the molecule to be trans-
ported on one side of the membrane and, with the help of ATP, change 
shape in order to move the molecule to the other side of the membrane. For 
example, a cell may have lots of glucose molecules inside the cell, but it still 
may need to bring in more because glucose is an important food molecule. Or 
a nerve cell may need to move a bunch of ions to one side of the membrane 
to get ready to send and receive electrical signals. Carrier proteins that do 
active transport are called pumps.
One very important active transport protein in animal cells is the sodium-
potassium pump. Through a series of steps, the sodium-potassium pump 
actively transports both sodium and potassium to opposite sides of the mem-
brane at the same time:
 
1. The sodium-potassium pump picks up three sodium ions (Na+) from 
the inside of the cell.
 
2. An ATP molecule is split, and one of its phosphate groups is attached 
to the sodium-potassium pump.

126
Part III: The Working Cell 
 
3. The sodium-potassium pump changes shape, releasing the three 
sodium ions (Na+) outside of the cell.
 
4. The sodium-potassium pump picks up two potassium ions from the 
outside of the cell.
 
5. The phosphate group from ATP is released from the sodium-potassium 
pump.
 
6. The sodium-potassium pump returns to its original shape, releasing 
the two potassium ions (K+) to the inside of the cell.
For every round of action, the sodium-potassium pump moves three sodium 
ions out of the cell and moves two potassium ions into the cell. Thus, the 
pump creates a higher concentration of sodium outside the cell, a higher 
concentration of potassium inside the cell, and a greater positive charge out-
side the cell. These differences in ion concentration and electrical charge are 
important in the functioning of nerve and muscle cells in animals.
Chatting through Cellular Connections
Multicellular organisms are made of a community of cells that work together 
to create the functioning whole organism. Just like the members of any com-
plex organization, these cells must communicate with each other, perform 
distinct tasks, and respond to each others’ requests. Two essential compo-
nents to the function of a multicellular organism are
 
✓ Attachment of cells to form tissues. Cells are connected to each other 
through various types of cell-cell attachments.
 
✓ Communication between cells to coordinate responses to signals. Cells 
can communicate directly with neighboring cells or send signals over 
long distances to communicate with cells farther away in the body.
Shaking hands through 
cell-cell attachments
The cells of animal tissues are connected to each other and to the extracellular 
matrix that surrounds them. Cells are connected to each other by different 
types of connections that depend on the function of the tissue. More than 
one type of connection, described in the following list, can attach a single 
cell to other cells and the extracellular matrix, as shown in Figure 9-3:

✓ Tight junctions bring cells together so tightly that even water can’t 
pass between the cells. Proteins pass through the membranes of both 
cells, holding the cells as if they were sewn together. The proteins are 
arranged in lines so that continuous bands of attachment are formed 
like seams of stitches through the tissue. Tight junctions are important 
in surface tissues like skin and mucous membranes where they create an 
effective barrier to molecules and foreign organisms that would other-
wise slip between the cells.
 
✓ Anchoring junctions hold cells together tightly, but allow materials to 
move through the intercellular space. They give structure and strength 
to tissues. Anchoring junctions are very important in tissues that do a 
lot of work — for example, heart muscle cells. Three types of anchoring 
junctions use different proteins to make connections between cells, the 
cytoskeleton, and the extracellular matrix:
 
• Desmosomes anchor cells to each other by attachments between 
proteins called cadherins in the membranes of both cells. The cad-
herins also connect with intermediate filaments in the cytoplasm 
of the cells.
 
• Hemidesmosomes anchor cells to the extracellular matrix. Proteins 
called integrins in the membranes of cells attach to extracellular 
matrix proteins toward the outside of the cell and to intermediate 
filaments in the inside of the cell.

128
Part III: The Working Cell 
 
• Adherens junctions anchor cells to each other and to the extra-
cellular matrix. Adherens junctions connect cells together by 
attachment of cadherin proteins in the membranes. The cadherin 
proteins also attach to actin microfilaments in the cytoplasm of 
the cells. The actin microfilaments may form bands around the 
cells that help with movement of the tissue. Adherens junctions 
also form between cells and the extracellular matrix. In this case, 
integrins in the plasma membranes of cells form connections to 
proteins in the extracellular matrix.
Sticking together through thick and thin
Plant cells stick together in tissues because of their cell walls, as shown 
in Figure 9-4. The first part of the plant cell wall to be made is the middle 
lamella, a layer of sticky molecules that holds adjacent plant cells together. 
After the middle lamella is formed, long cellulose molecules are embedded in 
the sticky molecules to add strength and create the primary wall. In woody 
plants, a secondary wall containing the tough molecule lignin is also added.

Jumping the cell-cell gap
Some connections between cells allow easy passage of materials between 
cells. In both plants and animals, tunnel-like structures allow cells to easily 
exchange ions, signals, and food molecules:

129
 Chapter 9: Hello, Neighbor: How Cells Communicate
 
✓ Between cells in almost all animal tissues, gap junctions are formed by 
proteins, called connexins, that form little rings in the membranes of 
cells. The rings on two adjacent cells line up with each other and con-
nect together so that the open centers of the protein rings, called pores, 
are aligned. In other words, the connected rings of proteins form the 
walls of a little tunnel that passes between the two cells. Ions and small 
molecules can travel through these tunnels from one cell to the next. 
In response to signals, the protein rings can pull together, closing the 
opening to the tunnel and blocking the movement of materials.
 
✓ Between plant cells, tunnels of cytoplasm called plasmodesmata func-
tion very similarly to gap junctions in animal cells. When plant cell walls 
form, little gaps in the walls allow the cytoplasm of one cell to touch 
the cytoplasm of neighboring cells. Plant cells can easily pass materi-
als from one cell to another and have even been observed to exchange 
small organelles!
Sending and Receiving Signals
In many multicellular organisms, including you, signals produced from one 
cell cause a response in a cell far away in the body. Signals that travel over 
a distance to reach their target cells are called hormones. For example, the 
hormone insulin, which is produced by cells in your pancreas, travels around 
your body through your blood and tells cells to take glucose out of the blood 
so that the cells can use it as a food source. Likewise, the plant hormone 
auxin, which is produced at the tips of growing plant stems, travels down the 
stems and tells side buds on the stem not to grow.
Letting go
Cancer is most dangerous when cancer cells 
metastasize, or spread throughout the body. 
In order for metastasis to occur, cancer cells 
must let go of their neighboring cells. A wide 
variety of cancer cells have defects in their cell 
junctions, suggesting that part of the pathway 
that leads to cancer involves changes in the 
formation of these junctions. Scientists who are 
studying this link between cell junctions and 
cancer have found that changes in the proteins 
that form the junctions can lead to cancer-like 
abnormalities in cells. For example, mice who 
can’t make normal cadherin proteins develop 
thick, irregular layers of skin that becomes 
cancerous very early in the development of the 
mice. Defects in cadherin also play a role in 
the development of breast cancer in humans. 
By studying how defects in cell junctions con-
tribute to the development of cancer, scientists 
hope to identify new ways of controlling the 
metastasis of cancer cells.

130
Part III: The Working Cell 
In order for cells to respond to a signal such as these hormones, the cell must 
recognize the signal and change in response to it. A cell can recognize a signal 
only if it has a receptor for that signal. Cells have receptors in two locations:
 
✓ Receptors for signaling molecules that can cross the plasma membrane, 
such as steroid hormones, are located inside of cells.
 
✓ The receptors for signaling molecules that can’t cross the plasma 
membrane are located within the plasma membrane of the cell.
Satellite dishes: Receptors
Receptor proteins have binding sites for the signals they recognize. Many 
different cell types can respond to the same signal if they all have the same 
receptor.
 
When signaling molecules, called ligands, bind to receptor proteins, the recep-
tor proteins change shape. The changed receptor protein sets off a series of 
events that causes the cell to change its behavior in response to the signal.
Relaying the message: Signal transduction
Receptor proteins located in plasma membranes bind to ligands on the out-
side of the cell and then cause a change in behavior on the inside of the cell. 
Because the signal is passed across the plasma membrane, this process is 
called signal transduction. Signal transduction involves several steps, shown 
in Figure 9-5:
 
1. The signal is received when the ligand binds to the receptor.
This stuff is addictive
If receptors for a particular signal are stimu-
lated at high levels over a long period of time, a 
cell may respond by decreasing the number of 
receptors for that signal. It’s as if the cell gets 
tired of listening to a loud noise over and over 
and wants to make things quieter.
For example, when people use drugs that stimu-
late nerve cells at high levels for long periods 
of time, the nerve cells may make fewer of the 
receptors that recognize the drug. Because 
they have fewer receptors, the drug user will be 
less sensitive to both the drug and the normal 
signals usually recognized by the receptor. As a 
result, the drug user will feel tired and dragged 
out when they aren’t using the drug and will 
have strong cravings for the drug when they 
aren’t using it. It’s a vicious cycle — using the 
drug leads to decreased receptors, which leads 
to increased cravings for the drug!

131
 Chapter 9: Hello, Neighbor: How Cells Communicate
 
 The ligand is the signaling molecule, such as a hormone. Because the 
ligand is the original signal to the cell, it’s also called the primary 
messenger.
 
2. The signal is transduced when the receptor changes shape and 
becomes ready to cause a change inside the cell.
 
 The binding of the ligand to the receptor changes the shape of the 
receptor protein, causing new binding sites on the receptor to become 
available.

3. The signal is amplified when the receptor causes a change inside the 
cell that activates molecules called second messengers.
 
 Second messengers are molecules that increase in concentration inside 
the cell and spread the original signal around the cell. One receptor can 
trigger the production of many second messenger molecules, which 
increases the strength of the signal within the cell.
 
4. The cell responds when second messengers cause changes in cell 
behavior.
 
 Second messengers may change cellular responses by activating or inhib-
iting proteins, such as enzymes, or by causing new proteins to be made 
through changes in gene expression. (For more on gene expression, see 
Chapter 19.)
Amplifying the signal
Primary messengers, such as hormones, are made in very low levels in the 
body. When these messengers arrive at cells and bind to receptors, their 
signal is amplified by a chain of events in cells called a signal transduction 
pathway.
Signal transduction pathways are a little bit like a cellular relay race — one 
molecule is activated, so it activates the next molecule, which activates the 
next molecule, and so on, until the signal crosses the cellular finish line and 
causes a change in cellular behavior. In signal transduction, the molecules 
in the middle of the pathway are the second messengers. One difference 
between a traditional relay race and signal transduction is that the primary 
messenger causes the activation of many secondary messengers at once, 
rather than just one at a time.
 
Because one primary messenger causes the activation of many secondary 
messengers, the original signal is amplified within the cell.
Signal transduction pathways involve the interactions of many different mol-
ecules and can get pretty complicated to follow. A couple of basic principles 
can help you understand these pathways:
 
✓ Proteins can be activated and inactivated when molecules bind to 
them. A protein’s shape is essential to its function. When something 
binds to a protein, the proteins shape will change. Thus, the protein’s 
function may change from active to inactive.
 
✓ Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) are 
often used as a source of phosphate groups. ATP and GTP are energy 
molecules that have three phosphate groups as part of their structure. 
Cells can remove a phosphate group from ATP or GTP by hydrolysis and 
transfer the phosphate to another molecule.

133
 Chapter 9: Hello, Neighbor: How Cells Communicate
 
✓ The transfer of a phosphate group to a molecule is called phosphory-
lation. Enzymes called kinases transfer phosphates from ATP or GTP to 
other molecules.
Enzyme-linked receptors
One type of signal transduction pathway involves enzyme-linked receptors, 
which are receptor proteins that have the ability to catalyze reactions inside 
the cell. One well-studied group of enzyme-linked receptors is the receptor 
tyrosine kinases (RTKs). The name of this group indicates their function: They 
are receptors that can phosphorylate a molecule.
The steps of signal transduction for receptor tyrosine kinases are as follows:
 
1. The primary messenger binds to the receptor (RTK).
 
 The binding of the primary messenger causes the receptor to change 
shape.
 
2. The receptor (RTK) is phosphorylated and becomes an active enzyme.
 
 After the receptor’s shape changes, it has a binding site for a phosphate 
group. Once the phosphate group is bound, the enzymatic ability of the 
receptor is activated.
 
3. The receptor (RTK) activates another membrane-associated protein 
called Ras.
 
 When Ras is activated, it binds a molecule of GTP.
 
4. Ras kicks off a phosphorylation cascade.
 
 Ras activates the first protein in the cascade by transferring a phos-
phate from its GTP to the protein. The activated protein catalyzes the 
phosphorylation of the second protein in the cascade, causing it to be 
activated. The second protein activates the third and so on. Again, the 
proteins are like runners in a relay race activating each other by handing 
off a phosphate group. Each activated protein in the pathway activates 
many copies of the next protein in the pathway which amplifies the 
signal from the primary messenger. Ultimately, one of the proteins in the 
cascade causes a change in cell behavior, and the signal transduction 
pathway is complete.
G proteins
Another important type of signal transduction pathway involves G proteins. 
G proteins get their name because they bind GTP. G proteins wait near the 
membrane right next to the receptor proteins they work with. The steps of 
signal transduction involving G proteins are as follows:
 
1. The primary messenger binds the receptor.
 
 The binding of the primary messenger causes the protein to change 
shape.

134
Part III: The Working Cell 
 
2. The receptor activates its G protein.
 
 The G protein binds to a GTP molecule and splits in half.
 
3. Part of the G protein travels along the membrane and binds to an 
enzyme.
 
 The enzyme becomes activated by the binding of the G protein.
 
4. The enzyme catalyzes the production of second messenger molecules.
 
 The second messengers travel through the cell and trigger a change in 
cell behavior.
Calming down: Deactivating the signal
Signal transduction pathways are shut down once the primary messenger 
stops sending the signal. In order to stop signal transduction, cells need to 
deactivate the molecules that were involved in the pathway. Several types of 
molecules in cells shut down signaling pathways:
 
✓ Phosphatases are enzymes that remove phosphates from molecules. 
When phosphatases remove the phosphate groups from molecules in 
signal transduction pathways, the molecules are inactivated.
 
✓ Activated G proteins and Ras proteins convert GTP to GDP and deacti-
vate themselves. Once they’re inactivated, they no longer activate the 
enzyme that produces second messengers.
 
✓ Second messenger molecules are short-lived in the cell. These molecules 
are inactivated by a number of different cellular mechanisms.
Ras is the gas
Activated Ras proteins kick off a phosphoryla-
tion cascade that relays the signal from the pri-
mary messenger throughout the cell. Once the 
primary messenger stops sending the signal, 
Ras proteins are supposed to convert GTP 
to GDP and inactivate themselves. However, 
human cells can develop defects in Ras proteins 
such that the Ras proteins don’t turn themselves 
off. In this situation, Ras proteins send signals to 
the cell whether or not the primary messenger is 
bound to the receptor. This situation is like a gas 
pedal in a car that stays on whether or not a foot 
is there to push it down.
The result of defective Ras depends on the 
signal that is being sent. In many cases, the pri-
mary messenger is a growth hormone telling the 
cell to divide. If Ras is defective, the result may 
be cells dividing when they aren’t supposed to 
and creating tumors. Approximately 25 percent 
human cancer cells have defective Ras pro-
teins, which just goes to show how important 
the control of signal transduction is to normal 
cell function!

ells are constantly converting matter and energy from one form to 
another in order to get what they need to stay alive. The input of energy 
into cells allows them to maintain their organization and build new mol-
ecules. Cells store energy in food molecules and then break food molecules 
down again to transfer the energy back out. In this chapter, I present the fun-
damental components of the vast connected system of reactions that makes 
up the metabolism of the cell.
Revving Up Your Metabolism
Metabolism is all of a cell’s chemical reactions, such as breaking down food 
molecules or building up muscle proteins, added together. You’re probably 
most familiar with your own metabolism in terms of diet and exercise: the 
faster your metabolic rate, the faster you burn, or break down, your food. 
Food provides you with the energy you need to move and grow, as well as the 
raw materials, or matter, you need to build the cells that make up your body. 
In order to access the energy and matter in food, your cells take food apart, 
breaking it down into its components.

136
Part III: The Working Cell 
Metabolism can be divided into two main categories:
 
✓ Catabolism includes all the reactions that break larger molecules into 
smaller ones. Catabolic reactions allow your cells to transfer the energy 
from food to a form that the cells can use to do their work. For example, 
your muscle cells do lots of work whenever you exercise, so you burn 
more food to provide them with the energy they need. Cells also take the 
components of food and rearrange them into the molecules that build 
your cells.
 
✓ Anabolism includes all the reactions that build larger molecules from 
smaller ones. For example, anabolic steroids increase anabolism, caus-
ing the body to build more muscle proteins from amino acids, which is 
why steroid use increases muscle mass.
Hundreds of different catabolic and anabolic reactions may all happen at one 
time in the cell, working to provide the cell with what it needs. This incredible 
complexity is shown in Figure 10-1, a metabolic map showing just some of 
the many interlocking reactions that make up the metabolism of the cell. In 
the metabolic map, each dot represents a different molecule and each line 
between the dots represents a different chemical reaction. As you look at 
this snapshot of metabolism, just imagine that each and every one of your 
10,000,000,000,000 cells is that busy all of the time!

Stayin’ Alive: Cellular Work and 
the Laws of Thermodynamics
I’m sure you use the words “work” and “energy” all the time in your daily 
life. In everyday terms, work is something that you do that requires an effort, 
whether it’s doing the laundry, mowing the lawn, or typing on a keyboard. 
Energy is something you need in order to get your work done. These ideas 
about work and energy are actually quite similar to how scientists define 
these words. To a scientist:
 
✓ Work is moving something over a distance.
 
✓ Energy is something you need to do work.
The relationship between energy and work applies to your cells just as much 
as it applies to your whole body. Your cells do work when they move or build 
new molecules, and they need energy in order to do that work. Your body 
transfers energy from the food you eat to a form that your cells can use to 
fuel their work.
The relationship between work and energy is studied in a branch of physics 
called thermodynamics. Thermodynamics has several laws, but the first two 
are especially important for understanding how and why cells use energy:
 
✓ The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can’t be created nor 
destroyed.
 
✓ The second law of thermodynamics states that chemical reactions that 
happen spontaneously increase the entropy, or disorder, of an isolated 
system.
The first law of thermodynamics
The first law of thermodynamics basically means that you can’t make new 
energy, and you can’t just make energy disappear. Any energy you use must 
come from somewhere and then go somewhere else when you are done.
Moving energy from one place to another is called energy transfer. Energy 
transfers happen every day all around you: If you’re using electricity to 
power a light as you read this text, then energy is being transferred from 
an electrical system to the light. As the light bulb shines, the light and heat 
energy from the bulb are transferred into the air all around you.

138
Part III: The Working Cell 
As energy is transferred from one place to another, it often changes from 
one type of energy to another. This process is called an energy transforma-
tion. For example, several forms of energy are involved in producing light 
from an electrical lamp: light energy, electrical energy, heat energy (from the 
warm bulb), plus whatever type of energy is used to produce the electrical 
energy in the first place, such as the flow of water in a hydroelectric plant. If 
you start with the flow of water in a hydroelectric plant, you can follow the 
energy through several transformations before it finally becomes light shin-
ing from the bulb.
Because energy never disappears, but is just converted from one form to 
another, the first law of thermodynamics is also sometimes called the law of 
conservation of energy.
 
In everyday language, conservation means to save. However, when scientists 
refer to conservation of energy, they do not mean saving energy — at least, 
not in the sense of driving a car that gets better gas mileage or something 
along those lines. What scientists mean is that the total amount of energy in 
the universe always remains the same, or is saved. The total amount of energy 
in the universe remains the same because energy can’t be created or destroyed;
instead, it just changes form and is transferred from one place to another.
You can organize all the different types of energy into two main categories:
 
✓ Potential energy is energy that an object or molecule has because of its 
position or arrangement.
 
✓ Kinetic energy is energy that objects and molecules have because of 
their motion.
Potential energy
Potential energy, also called stored energy, includes several types of energy:
 
✓ Chemical potential energy, such as that found in oil, natural gas, 
or food.
 
✓ Elastic potential energy, such as that in compressed springs and 
stretched rubber bands.
 
✓ Gravitational potential energy, such as that in objects held above 
ground level.
All these items have energy because of how they’re arranged. In the case of
chemical energy, the arrangement of electrons within the chemicals determines 
the amount of stored energy. A compressed spring, on the other hand, has 
potential energy because of the way it’s compressed. Once the spring is 
released, it will transfer its potential energy to another object — for example, 
launching a ball in a pinball game. One of the most important kinds of energy 
in cells is the chemical potential energy of food.

139
 Chapter 10: Metabolism: Transferring Energy and Matter
 
You can easily confuse the scientific definition of potential, which means 
“stored,” with the more common, everyday definition, which means “a possi-
bility.” In everyday language, you might say that an object has the potential to 
store energy, such as a spring with the potential to store energy when com-
pressed. In scientific thinking, however, an object only has potential energy if 
it’s actually storing energy at that particular time. So, in scientific terms, a spring 
that isn’t compressed doesn’t have potential energy because it can’t do work in 
its current form. Only after the spring is compressed and ready to do work 
does it have potential energy. Even though it’s possible for an uncompressed 
spring to store energy if you compress it, to a scientist, a spring only has 
potential energy when it’s actually compressed.
Kinetic energy
Kinetic energy is energy of motion. Anything that is moving has kinetic energy, 
including wind, moving water, the flow of electrons through a wire (electricity), 
and the movement of electromagnetic waves of radiation, such as light and heat 
from the sun. The most important kinds of kinetic energy to cells are light, 
heat, and the movement of charged particles, such as ions and electrons. For 
example, the movement of charged particles across the membrane of your 
nerve cells is what allows your nervous system to send signals around 
your body.
 
The first law of thermodynamics says that energy can’t be created or destroyed;
 it’s just transferred from one form to another. Cells transfer energy from food 
in order to do cellular work.
The second law of thermodynamics
The second law of thermodynamics is complicated but powerful. It explains why 
things fall down and not up, why things break and don’t just fix themselves, 
and why the Sun will burn out some day. The second law tells you that
 
✓ With every energy transfer, the potential energy of the system decreases 
(if no energy enters or leaves the system).
 
✓ Energy spontaneously tends to flow only from being concentrated in one 
place to becoming diffused or dispersed and spread out.
 
✓ In an isolated system, a process can occur only if it increases the total 
disorder (entropy) of the system.
 
✓ Heat never moves from a cooler object to a warmer object.
 
✓ It’s impossible to convert heat completely into work.

140
Part III: The Working Cell 
Spontaneous reactions
In cellular biology, the most useful expressions of the second law of thermo-
dynamics are those that explain which reactions in cells are spontaneous and 
which are not. Spontaneous reactions happen on their own without requiring 
input of energy from the cell. 
 
The second law of thermodynamics states that reactions can only be sponta-
neous if they increase the total amount of disorder, called entropy, in the 
universe.
The second law of thermodynamics is a very abstract idea, but it’s an idea you 
have seen in action in your everyday life. For example, if you take a spoonful of 
salt or some colored drink powder and put it into a glass of water, the salt or 
colored particles will eventually spread out throughout the water even if you 
don’t stir the water. A random distribution of particles is more disordered than 
having particles concentrated in one part of the water, so the particles sponta-
neously spread out without any input of energy from you. This same pattern in 
seen in cells as well — molecules in solution in cells will spontaneously move 
from areas where they’re more concentrated until they’re randomly distrib-
uted throughout the cell. Chemical reactions that break down larger, more 
organized molecules into smaller fragments also increase the overall amount of 
entropy and thus will also happen spontaneously in the cell.
Nonspontaneous reactions
The second law of thermodynamics says that the universe is constantly increas-
ing in disorder. At first glance, living things seem to contradict the second law 
because living things, and their cells, are very organized systems. Cells main-
tain their order by constantly using their stored energy to do nonspontaneous 
reactions, which decrease entropy and require the input of energy.
A good analogy for comparing nonspontaneous and spontaneous reactions in 
cells is to compare a brick wall to a pile of bricks. A brick wall is much more 
organized than a pile of bricks. If you want to build a brick wall from a pile of 
bricks, you’ll be making things more organized and thus decreasing entropy. 
This is nonspontaneous — this transformation isn’t going to “just happen.” 
You’re going to have to put in energy and do work to get the job done.
On the other hand, if you build a brick wall and let it just sit there for a 
thousand years or so, the wall will gradually fall apart. When the wall breaks 
down, entropy is increased. So this process is spontaneous and will occur 
without the input of energy. The difference between building a brick wall and 
letting one fall apart is similar to the situation in cells (see Figure 10-2) when 
they’re building and breaking down molecules:
 
✓ Reactions that build large complex molecules from smaller parts are like 
building the brick wall. The reactions are nonspontaneous and require 
the input of energy.

141
 Chapter 10: Metabolism: Transferring Energy and Matter
 
✓ Reactions that break large molecules down into smaller parts are like 
letting the brick wall fall apart. These reactions are spontaneous and 
actually make energy available to the cell.
Although cells must maintain their organization in order to function, they 
don’t really violate the second law of thermodynamics. (It wouldn’t be a 
very good scientific law if evidence revealed that it could be broken!) Cells 
use stored energy to do nonspontaneous reactions that increase order, or 
decrease entropy, in the cell. However, in order to store energy in the first 
place, cells must do spontaneous reactions, such as breaking down food 
molecules. These reactions increase the entropy in the universe. Overall, 
the increase in entropy by the spontaneous reactions is greater than the 
decrease in entropy by the nonspontaneous reactions in the cell. Entropy in 
the universe continues to increase, and the second law is satisfied.
 
Cells increase entropy in the universe by doing spontaneous reactions, such 
as breaking down food molecules into smaller pieces. However, they use the 
energy made available by these spontaneous reactions to decrease entropy 
within the cell by building, maintaining, and organizing cellular components.

Free energy
You can figure out whether a chemical reaction will be spontaneous or 
nonspontaneous by looking at the changes in free energy that occur as the 
reactants are turned into products. Gibbs free energy (G) is a measurement 
that relates entropy and heat and thus gives you a way to evaluate a reaction 
in terms of the second law of thermodynamics. To determine the changes in 
free energy (G, called “delta G”), you subtract the free energy of the reac-
tants from the free energy of the products.
G = G products – G reactants

142
Part III: The Working Cell 
The G tells you whether the reaction will be spontaneous or nonspontaneous:
 
✓ If the reactants have more free energy than the products, the G will be 
negative, or less than zero (G<0), and the reaction will be spontaneous.
 
✓ If the products have more free energy than the reactants, the G will be 
positive, or greater than zero (G>0), and the reaction will be 
nonspontaneous.
The G also tells you how much energy is made available to the cell or is 
needed by the cell as the reaction occurs:
 
✓ Spontaneous chemical reactions release energy to the cell. Energy-
releasing reactions are called exergonic reactions.
 
✓ Nonspontaneous chemical reactions require energy input from the cell. 
Energy-requiring reactions are called endergonic reactions.
 
The graphs of the G of a reaction in Figure 10-3 show an easy way to remember 
spontaneous versus nonspontaneous reactions. Spontaneous reactions look like 
they’re going downhill in terms of energy. It’s easy to go downhill, so these 
reactions are spontaneous. Nonspontaneous reactions look like they’re going 
uphill. Going up the energy hill is hard, so these reactions are nonspontaneous, 
and you’re going to have to put in some energy to do it!
Entropy = Death
When I was an undergraduate studying biol-
ogy, I remember seeing a bumper sticker that 
said entropy=death. I don’t think I really got 
the sticker back then, but now I think it’s a very 
profound way of summing up the relationship 
between the second law of thermodynamics 
and living things.
Life is a state of order: for cells to function and 
thus remain alive, molecules must be built, 
structures must be maintained, and chemicals 
and ions must be distributed in certain ways. 
To maintain this order, living things constantly 
break down food molecules, transferring 
energy to the cell that is used to fight the battle 
against entropy. If this energy transfer stops for 
any reason, such as when a human heart stops 
beating, oxygen can no longer travel to your 
cells, and you can no longer extract energy 
from your food. Almost the moment your body 
ceases to provide new energy to your cells, 
entropy wins. Molecules break down, ions ran-
domize, and your cells cease to function. Life 
battles entropy within the cell. When that battle 
is lost, the result is death.

Going to work in the cellular factory
Cells transfer energy from food molecules in order to do cellular work. You 
know about the work you do in your life, but you may not be aware of all the 
work that is going on in your cells every day as you go about your business:
 
✓ Synthesis: Cells must build large, complex molecules, such as proteins 
and DNA. They also build organized structures, such as cellular mem-
branes and ribosomes.
 
✓ Organization: In eukaryotic cells (see Chapter 2), internal cellular mem-
branes create different compartments in the cell that allow organization 
of materials for specific tasks.
 
✓ Creation of electrochemical gradients: Cells organize ions on either 
side of membranes, allowing differences in electrical charge and chemi-
cal concentration to be created. These electrochemical gradients help 
with cellular work, such as signaling, movement, and transport of mate-
rials across membranes.
 
✓ Transport and movement: Cells also transport molecules, such as pro-
teins and lipids, from one part of the cell to another, and some cells 
swim or crawl using special motility proteins.
 
Cellular work includes building (synthesis), organizing, transporting, and 
moving. All these cellular processes are essential to cellular function, and all 
require the input of energy from the cell.

144
Part III: The Working Cell 
ATP
Cells break down food molecules for energy to do cellular work. However, 
they don’t use the energy from food directly. Instead, cells use a sort of 
energy middleman, called adenosine triphosphate, as shown in Figure 10-4.
Here’s how cells use ATP:
 
1. Energy from food is transferred to ATP.
 
2. ATP provides energy for cellular work.
Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a nucleotide, the same type of building 
block that is used to build DNA and RNA. It has three types of parts:
 
✓ The sugar ribose
 
✓ A nitrogenous base
 
✓ Three phosphate groups
Energy coupling
Cells are constantly building and breaking down ATP, creating an ATP/ADP 
cycle, as shown in Figure 10-5. Cells store energy by building ATP molecules 
out of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and phosphate groups (P). Cells obtain 
energy for cellular work by breaking ATP back down into these components. 
The breakdown of ATP to ADP and P requires a water molecule and is called 
ATP hydrolysis.

Cells make and break ATP all the time:
 
✓ When cells do exergonic reactions that make energy available to the cell, 
they capture that energy by forming ATP molecules.
 
✓ When cells do endergonic reactions that require energy from the cell, 
cells provide the energy by breaking ATP molecules.
The ATP/ADP cycle is used to link exergonic and endergonic reactions in a 
system called energy coupling. ATP hydrolysis, which is exergonic, is coupled, 
or done at the same time, as an endergonic process. Some of the energy 
released from the ATP hydrolysis is used during the endergonic reaction.
 
When cells do an endergonic reaction by coupling it to ATP hydrolysis, the 
two reactions do not occur separately. Instead, the two reactions are actually 
combined and then broken into steps in such a way that all the steps become 
spontaneous and exergonic. In other words, instead of trying to do a small 
“uphill” reaction separately from a larger “downhill” reaction, cells change 
things around to create two smaller “downhill” reactions. For example, if a 
cell needs to build the amino acid glutamine by adding an amino group to the 
amino acid glutamate, the reaction would be endergonic and nonspontaneous 
(G=+3.8 kcal/mol). (The abbreviation kcal/mol stands for kilocalories per 
mole, which is a measurement of how much energy is produced or needed by 
the reaction.) However, the hydrolysis of ATP is exergonic and spontaneous 
and provides more than enough energy for this reaction (G=–7.3 kcal/mol). 
So, if you consider these reactions together, the overall process would be 

146
Part III: The Working Cell 
exergonic and spontaneous. (If you add the two Gs, you get –3.5 kcal/mol.) In 
order to build the glutamine, the cell would combine both reactions and break 
the process into two exergonic steps:
 
1. Glutamate is combined with ATP, and a phosphate group is trans-
ferred from ATP to the glutamate.
 
 ADP and water are produced.
 
2. The glutamate with the attached phosphate is combined with an 
amino group.
 
 The amino group is transferred to the glutamate as the phosphate group 
is released, forming the amino acid glutamine.
The products are the same as if the two reactions, glutamine synthesis and 
ATP hydrolysis, were done separately, but because they were combined, 
they became energetically favorable.
One Step at a Time: Metabolic Pathways
If you refer to Figure 10-1, earlier in this chapter, you can see that metabo-
lism is a vast interlocking web of chemical reactions. If you put your finger 
on one of the dots in Figure 10-1 that represents a particular chemical, you 
can trace a path from that dot, along lines, to other dots, and so on. The 
path your finger travels represents a subset of the many chemical reactions 
that are occurring in the cell. A single path like the one you traced is called 
a metabolic pathway (see Figure 10-6). Metabolic pathways have several key 
characteristics:
 
✓ Metabolic changes are broken down into small steps, each of which is a 
single chemical reaction. Several reactions in a series make up a meta-
bolic pathway.
 
✓ Enzymes are very important to a functioning metabolism. They speed up 
chemical reactions by lowering the energy of activation so that metabo-
lism occurs quickly enough to support life.
 
✓ Electrons are transferred from one molecule to another during many 
metabolic reactions. Molecules that lose electrons are oxidized; those 
that gain them are reduced. Electron carriers, such as nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide (NADH), shuttle electrons between reactions.
 
✓ Energy is transferred during metabolic reactions. The energy carrier 
ATP transfers energy to or from reactions.

147
 Chapter 10: Metabolism: Transferring Energy and Matter
Taking baby steps during 
chemical reactions
In cells, chemical reactions usually happen in many small steps rather than 
one quick change. By doing many small reactions, cells control the energy 
changes and prevent cellular damage. For example, a cell that needs to make 
molecule F out of molecule A might do so in five small steps:
A→ B→ C→ D→ E→ F
A represents the starting molecule, or substrate. F represents the ending mol-
ecule, or product. B, C, D, and E all represent molecules that were made during 
the conversion of A to F; they’re called intermediates. Every arrow represents 
one step, or reaction, as a chemical change occurred.
Metabolic pathways connect with each other forming a complex interlocking 
web. The connections and complexities in metabolism occur when:
 
✓ The product of one pathway is the substrate of another.
 
✓ A pathway may have one or more branches as intermediates connect 
with other pathways.
 
✓ Some metabolic pathways are circular, re-creating the initial substrate 
during the pathway so that it can repeat, as shown in Figure 10-6. These 
types of pathways are called metabolic cycles.

Part III: The Working Cell 
Helping hands from enzymes
Life is very fast paced — too fast to just wait around for necessary chemical 
reactions to occur, even spontaneous reactions. Although spontaneous reac-
tions are energetically favorable and can occur without energy input from 
the cell, there is no guarantee on exactly when they will occur. In order for a 
spontaneous reaction to happen, the reactants must find each other and then 
collide in just the right way and with enough kinetic energy to trigger the 
necessary changes. In other words, a spontaneous reaction is just waiting to 
happen, but it needs a little push from the collision of the reactants to get it 
to go, as shown in Figure 10-7.
The amount of energy that is necessary to trigger the reaction is called the 
energy of activation (Ea). Without the energy of activation, spontaneous reac-
tions may not happen quickly enough to support life. For example, you prob-
ably know that if you eat sugar, your body will break it down in order to get 
some usable energy from the sugar. The breakdown of sugar is a spontane-
ous, exergonic reaction that releases usable energy to cells. However, if you 
were to place a bowl of sugar on your kitchen table and stare at it, it’s highly 
unlikely that the sugar would begin to disappear before your very eyes. 
Outside of your cells, the sugar molecules don’t have enough kinetic energy 
to overcome the barrier (see Figure 10-7).

 Chapter 10: Metabolism: Transferring Energy and Matter
Cellular enzymes (see Chapter 6) make the difference between the break-
down of sugar inside your cells and outside of your cells. Enzymes are impor-
tant to cells because
 
✓ Enzymes lower the energy of activation for reactions, making it easier 
for collisions between reactants to overcome the activation energy.
 
✓ Every reaction that occurs in cells is catalyzed by an enzyme. Because 
enzymes are very specific and can bind to only a certain substrate (see 
Chapter 6), each reaction requires a unique enzyme.
For example, look at this simple metabolic pathway in which molecule A is 
converted to molecule F by five reactions:
A→ B→ C→ D→ E→ F
Each reaction in this pathway would be catalyzed by a different enzyme, 
requiring a total of five enzymes to complete the pathway. If you refer to 
Figure 10-1 and look at all the reactions drawn on the metabolic map, you can 
get an idea of the hundreds of enzymes that may be needed at any one time 
in a cell.
 
Enzymes lower the activation energy of reactions, making it easier for reactants
to have productive collisions. Productive collisions are those that have enough 
energy to overcome the energy of activation. In order for productive collisions 
to occur:
 
✓ The particular reactants for a reaction must collide with each other.
 
✓ The reactants must be oriented toward each other in the right way so 
that the correct chemical groups come into contact.
 
✓ The reactants must have enough kinetic energy to overcome the energy 
of activation.
Enzymes do several things to make it more likely that a collision will be 
productive:
 
✓ Enzymes bind reactants (substrates) in their active sites, bringing the 
necessary reactants for a reaction together in the proper orientation for 
the reaction to occur.
 
✓ The functional groups on the amino acids (see Chapter 6) that make 
up the enzyme interact with the reactants, altering chemical bonds so 
that the changes necessary for the chemical reaction are more likely to 
happen.

150
Part III: The Working Cell 
The combined effects of these interactions between enzymes and reactants 
(substrates) result in the lowering of the activation energy for the reaction. 
Thus, it’s more likely that the kinetic energy of the reactants will be enough 
to cause the reaction to occur.
Giving and taking electrons 
in redox reactions
During metabolic reactions, electrons are often transferred from one mol-
ecule to another.
Molecules change when they give or take electrons:
 
✓ When a molecule gives up an electron, it’s oxidized.
 
✓ When a molecule accepts an electron, it’s reduced.
A good example of oxidation and reduction is the reaction between sodium 
(Na) and chlorine (Cl-). When sodium and chlorine come into contact with 
each other, chlorine steals an electron from sodium. (For more on the inter-
action between sodium and chlorine, see Chapter 4).
Sodium is oxidized and becomes the sodium ion (Na+). Chlorine is reduced 
and becomes the chloride ion (Cl). Because oxidation and reduction reac-
tions occur together — one molecule is oxidized, and one is reduced — these 
reactions are called redox reactions.
 
It seems backwards to think that when a molecule gains an electron, it’s 
reduced. Reduced means less, right, so how can gaining an electron make 
you reduced? The reason for this contradiction is because elements are 
compared to their most oxidized state. So, if you think of most oxidized as 
the max, then every electron a molecule accepts moves it away from the 
max, or reduces it. Too confusing? Then just remember this friendly little sen-
tence, “LEO the lion goes GER.” This stands for Loss of Electrons is Oxidation 
(LEO); Gain of Electrons is Reduction (GER). This shortcut never fails.
Shuttling electrons with electron carriers
Sometimes electrons are moved directly from one molecule to another during 
metabolism. Frequently, however, cells use an electron shuttle bus, called 
an electron carrier. Electron carriers accept electrons from one reaction and 
then transfer those electrons to another reaction. During metabolism, these 
electrons are often moved as part of hydrogen atoms (H) that are stripped 
from one molecule and then given to another.

151
 Chapter 10: Metabolism: Transferring Energy and Matter
Electron carriers cycle between two forms, an oxidized form and a reduced 
form, as they shuttle electrons (or hydrogen atoms) around the cell (see 
Figure 10-8).
 
✓ The oxidized form of a carrier accepts electrons from reactions. When it 
accepts electrons, it becomes reduced.
 
✓ The reduced form of a carrier donates electrons to reactions. When it 
donates electrons, it becomes oxidized.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+/NADH), shown in Figure 10-9, is 
a good example of an electron carrier. It’s made of two nucleotides hooked 
together. The nitrogenous base of the upper nucleotide is the part of the mol-
ecule that accepts and donates electrons.
As NAD+/NADH shuttles electrons, it alternates between two forms:
 
✓ When the carrier is in its oxidized form, the nitrogenous ring carries a 
positive charge. This form of the carrier is NAD+.
 
✓ The carrier is reduced when it accepts one electron, which neutralizes 
the charge, plus one entire hydrogen atom. The reduced form of the 
carrier is NADH + H+.
 
Whenever NAD+ accepts electrons, it’s converted to NADH + H+. The +H+ seems 
like a little brother always following the NADH around. During metabolism, 
electrons are often stripped off molecules as part of hydrogen atoms. Each 
hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron. When two hydrogen 
atoms are removed from a molecule during redox reactions, NAD+ can carry 

152
Part III: The Working Cell 
one electron, plus one whole hydrogen atom, in its nitrogenous ring. However, 
it can’t accept one proton. This proton is released into the cell, which is 
shown by writing +H+, which represents a proton, after the NADH.
 
You can easily remember which form of an electron carrier is the oxidized 
form and which one is the reduced just by looking at its name. When electron 
carriers are reduced, they’re carrying their electron passengers in the form of 
hydrogen atoms. They show that they are carrying passengers by putting the 
letter H for hydrogen in their name, as in NADH. The oxidized form of the elec-
tron carrier doesn’t have the H, as in NAD+, which reveals that it’s not carrying 
any passengers.

Getting what you need at the cellular level
Metabolism is all about getting what you need to stay alive. You know what 
you need on the big scale — good old food, clothing, and shelter. But on the 
small scale, on the cellular level, what you need to keep your cells functioning 
comes down to a different three things:
 
✓ Building blocks for growth and repair. Your cells need a constant 
supply of materials to obtain the building blocks for the molecules that 
make up the cell. Food molecules are broken down by catabolism, and 

153
 Chapter 10: Metabolism: Transferring Energy and Matter
their building blocks are rearranged to form the molecules of the cell by 
anabolism.
 
✓ Energy for cellular work. Your cells need a constant supply of energy 
to allow cellular work, such as building molecules, moving things, and 
organizing cellular components. Food molecules are broken down by 
catabolism, allowing the transfer of energy from food to the cell.
 
✓ Reducing power. Your cells need a constant supply of electrons during 
anabolism in order to build the molecules that make up the cell. During 
catabolic reactions, electrons from food are transferred to electron 
carriers. These electron carriers then provide the needed electrons 
during anabolism.

Breath You Take
In This Chapter
▶ Burning your food
▶ Transferring energy to ATP
▶ Breaking down glucose via cellular respiration
W
hen you eat food, your digestive system breaks down the food into 
smaller and smaller pieces until it becomes a soup of molecules in 
your small intestines. Your cells take in food molecules and break them down 
into even smaller pieces in order to make their stored energy available to the 
cell. The metabolic pathway that your cells use to rearrange food molecules 
in order to make them useful as building blocks or to capture their stored 
energy is called cellular respiration. Without cellular respiration, your cells 
would not be able to obtain the energy and matter they need to function, and 
you would die. In this chapter, I examine the importance of this metabolic 
pathway and the details of how it works.
Cellular Respiration: An Overview
Cells break down food molecules — carbohydrates, proteins, and fats — 
through cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is a metabolic pathway that, 
through a series of small steps, rearranges the atoms in the food molecules, 
making their stored energy available to the cell.
Cellular respiration, shown in Figure 11-1, is an example of the principles of 
metabolism discussed in Chapter 10: The pathway is made of many small 
chemical reactions, redox reactions move electrons from one molecule to 
another, and energy is transferred. Specifically,

156
Part III: The Working Cell 
 
✓ During cellular respiration, electrons are removed from food molecules, 
transferred to the electron carrier NADH (see Chapter 10) and then to 
oxygen (O2).
 
✓ By the end of cellular respiration, the energy from food has been trans-
ferred to the energy carrier, ATP.
 
✓ Through many chemical reactions, your cells completely rearrange food 
molecules into the waste products, carbon dioxide (CO2), and water (H2O).
Although cells break down all kinds of food molecules via cellular respiration, 
the simple sugar glucose is used as a starting point for studying the pathway. 
Overall, the pathway is represented by this reaction:
C6H12O6 + 6 O2 → 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + energy
This summary reaction simplifies the process by ignoring all the intermedi-
ate steps and showing only the reactants that enter the process (glucose and 
oxygen) and the waste products that leave the process (carbon dioxide and 
water). I include energy as a product as a reminder that this pathway is exer-
gonic and thus makes energy available to the cell. The energy released during 
cellular respiration is transferred to ATP for use in cellular work (see Chapter 
10) and also lost to the environment of the cell as heat.
 
Food has energy already, so why do your cells need to transfer that energy to 
ATP using cellular respiration? You can think of cellular respiration as similar 
to the process of refining oil. Crude oil has energy in it, but the energy isn’t in 
the right form to run your car. So, crude oil is refined to gasoline that can fuel 
your car. Similarly, food is broken down, and energy is transferred to ATP — 
the right form of energy to fuel your cells.
Sweaty business
Have you ever wondered why you get hot and 
sweaty when you’re working out? The answer is 
cellular respiration. Your muscles need energy 
in the form of ATP to do work, so they increase 
the rate of cellular respiration. Cellular respira-
tion breaks down food molecules and transfers 
energy to ATP. However, not all the energy from 
food is captured by the cell. In fact, cellular res-
piration can transfer only about 40 percent of 
the energy in food to ATP; the other 60 percent 
is lost to the environment as heat. As the heat 
transfers through your body, you heat up, caus-
ing your automatic sprinkler system, sweating, 
to kick in and help cool you back down.

Controlling the burn
If you’ve every burned a marshmallow, or even a piece of paper, you’ve seen 
and felt the energy that was originally stored in the chemical structure of the 
thing you burned. When you touched the marshmallow to a flame in the pres-
ence of oxygen, you provided the energy needed to start a chemical reaction 
that rapidly converted the sugars to carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) and 
transformed the chemical potential energy to heat and light (see Figure 11-1).

The reaction of the direct burning of sugar is identical to the summary reac-
tion for cellular respiration. I’m sure you can appreciate, however, that it 
would be very painful if your cells broke down sugars as rapidly as this pro-
cess! Also, I doubt you’d be very eager to touch a flame to your cells to begin 
the process. Instead, your cells break down sugars by a number of much 
smaller steps so that the process is compatible with living cells:
 
✓ The energy release is done little by little, which allows cells to capture 
that energy by transferring it to ATP without being harmed.
 
✓ Enzymes can lower the activation energy for each of the smaller reac-
tions so that the reactions will occur. (See Chapter 10 for more about 
enzymes and activation energy.)

158
Part III: The Working Cell 
Transferring energy to ATP
Cellular respiration is an exergonic process, which means it makes energy 
available to the cell. If you look at Figure 11-1, you can see that the reactants 
(glucose and oxygen) have more free energy than the products (carbon 
dioxide and water). As your cells rearrange the atoms in glucose and oxygen 
during cellular respiration, the molecules are going downhill in energy: The 
chemical potential energy in the molecules is slowly being siphoned off as it’s 
transferred into the energy carrier ATP.
Moving electrons to oxygen
During cellular respiration, glucose is oxidized, and oxygen is reduced, 
which means that electrons are removed from glucose and transferred to 
oxygen. (You can see these processes in Figure 11-2.) When the electrons are 
moved, they’re moved as part of hydrogen atoms. In fact, if you look again 
at the summary reaction for cellular respiration, you can see that to turn 
glucose (C6H12O6) into carbon dioxide (CO2), you need to remove the hydro-
gen atoms. Likewise, to turn oxygen (O2) into water (H2O), you have to add 
hydrogen atoms.

The oxidation of glucose is exergonic and makes lots of energy available to the 
cell. To control the energy release, the oxidation happens as part of the many 
small steps of cellular respiration, rather than as a single transfer from glucose 
to oxygen. During several steps of cellular respiration, electrons are trans-
ferred from the intermediates to NAD+, changing it to its reduced form, NADH 
+ H+. NADH then transfers the electrons to an electron transport chain, where 
they’re passed along through a series of redox reactions before being trans-
ferred to oxygen. The electron transport chain is a series of proteins in a mem-
brane that use redox reactions to transfer energy to ATP. Figure 11-3 shows 
the transfer of electrons and energy via the electron transport chain.

Taking things one step at a time
The oxidation of glucose via cellular respiration takes place slowly over a 
series of small steps and results in the transfer of energy from glucose to 
ATP. The entire process of cellular respiration occurs in three smaller path-
ways (see Figure 11-4):
 
✓ Glycolysis is the first part of cellular respiration. During glycolysis, the 
oxidation of glucose begins, and some electrons are transferred to NAD+. 
Additionally, a small amount of energy is transferred to ATP. Glycolysis 
converts a single glucose molecule, which contains six carbon atoms, 
into two molecules of pyruvate, each of which has three carbon atoms. 
Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell.
 
✓ The Krebs Cycle (also called the tricarboxylic acid cycle, TCA cycle, or 
citric acid cycle) continues the oxidation of the intermediates made 
from glucose, resulting in the production of CO2. The Krebs cycle trans-
fers electrons to NAD+ and to another electron carrier, flavin adenine 
dinucleotide (FAD). The Krebs cycle also transfers a small amount of 
energy directly to ATP. The Krebs cycle occurs in the mitochondrion 
(see Chapter 2) of the cell.
 
✓ Oxidative phosphorylation transfers electrons from electron carriers to 
an electron transport chain. The electron transport chain is a system 
of proteins in a membrane that use redox reactions to transfer energy 
to ATP. The final redox reaction is the transfer of electrons to oxygen, 
which is reduced to water. Oxidative phosphorylation occurs in the 
mitochondrion of the cell.

Gimme a Break: Glycolysis
Glycolysis is a series of chemical reactions that result in the oxidation of glu-
cose (Figure 11-5), the transfer of energy to ATP, and the transfer of electrons 
to the electron carrier NAD+. Overall, the major events of glycolysis are as 
follows:
 
✓ The bonds between the atoms in glucose break and reform between 
new combinations of atoms, creating two molecules of pyruvate. A 
glucose molecule has six carbon atoms, whereas a molecule of pyruvate 
has three carbon atoms, so in a way, it’s like glycolysis breaks glucose 
molecules in half.
 
✓ Enzymes transfer energy from intermediates to ATP. During the first 
part of glycolysis, enzymes actually transfer energy from ATP to the 
intermediates, representing the energy investment phase. However, 
enzymes then transfer even more energy from the intermediates to ATP 
during the second part of glycolysis, representing the energy payoff 
phase. Overall, for every molecule of glucose broken down in glycolysis, 
enzymes use two ATP molecules, but make four ATP molecules, which 
results in a net gain of two molecules of ATP for the cell.
 
✓ Enzymes oxidize glucose and reduce NAD+. Enzymes transfer electrons 
that were originally in glucose from an intermediate to NAD+, reducing 
the electron carrier to NADH + H+. (See Chapter 10 for a detailed discus-
sion of NAD+.)

 Chapter 11: Cellular Respiration: Every Breath You Take
Everybody’s doing it
Every cell on Earth does some form of glycolysis. Some variations in glycoly-
sis exist among prokaryotes (see Chapter 2 for a discussion of the prokary-
otic cell), but it seems that glycolysis is an integral part of life on Earth. When 
you think about what glycolysis does — transfers energy from food to ATP — 
I think this makes sense. In order to function, cells must remain organized. In 
order to remain organized, cells need a constant supply of energy. Glycolysis 
lets cells capture that energy from food. So, glycolysis is an essential process. 
And the fact that glycolysis is so widespread among many different types of 
cells suggests that it developed very early in the history of life on Earth.
Fine print: The steps of glycolysis
Glycolysis has ten chemical reactions, shown in Figure 11-5:
 
1. An enzyme transfers a phosphate from ATP to glucose, creating the 
intermediate glucose-6-phosphate and releasing ADP as waste.
 
 This step transfers energy to the intermediate and is part of the energy 
investment phase of glycolysis.
 
2. An enzyme rearranges the bonds in glucose-6-phosphate, creating the 
intermediate fructose-6-phosphate.
 
3. An enzyme transfers a phosphate from ATP to fructose-6-phosphate, 
creating the intermediate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and releasing ADP 
as waste.
 
 This step transfers energy to the intermediate and is part of the energy 
investment phase of glycolysis.
 
4. An enzyme catalyzes the splitting of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate into 
two 3-carbon molecules, dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceralde-
hydes-3-phosphate.
 
 Both of these intermediates ultimately proceed through the rest of glyc-
olysis, so every step after this one happens twice for every molecule of 
glucose.
 
5. An enzyme rearranges the bonds in dihydroxyacetone phosphate, 
converting it to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, so that it can proceed 
through the rest of glycolysis.

6. Electrons are transferred from glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to NAD+, 
resulting in the formation of NADH + H+; at the same time, an inor-
ganic phosphate group that was available in the cell is transferred to 
glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate, resulting in the formation of the inter-
mediate 1,3-biphosphoglycerate.

163
 Chapter 11: Cellular Respiration: Every Breath You Take
 
7. An enzyme transfers a phosphate group from 1,3-biphosphoglycerate 
to ADP, producing ATP and a new intermediate, 3-phosphoglycerate.
 
 This step represents a transfer of energy from 1,3-biphosphoglycerate to 
the energy carrier, ATP.
 
8. An enzyme rearranges the bonds in 3-phosphoglycerate, creating 
2-phosphoglycerate.
 
9. An enzyme catalyzes the removal of water from 2-phosphoglycerate, 
forming the intermediate phosphoenolpyruvate.
 
10. Another energy transfer occurs as a phosphate group is transferred 
from phosphoenolpyruvate to ADP, producing ATP.
 
 During the process, phosphoenolpyruvate is converted to pyruvate.
 
The appearance and names of the molecules in glycolysis may seem strange 
and hard to remember. However, they do make some sense, and figuring them 
out may make the whole process easier to understand. For example, glucose 
with a phosphate added to it is called glucose-6-phosphate. The number 6 
indicates that the phosphate group is attached to the number 6 carbon. (See 
Chapter 5 for a discussion of the numbering of carbons in a sugar.) A molecule 
with two phosphate groups attached is called a bisphosphate, because the 
prefix “bi-” means two. So, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate has two phosphate 
groups, one attached to the number 1 carbon and one attached to the number 
3 carbon. Whenever you see ATP being used or created, the number of phos-
phate groups on the intermediates will also change. Changes in ATP occur in 
Steps 1, 3, 7 and 10 of glycolysis.
Making ATP by substrate-level 
phosphorylation
During Steps 7 and 10 of glycolysis (see the preceding section), enzymes 
transfer a phosphate group from an intermediate to ADP, forming the energy 
carrier ATP. During both of these reactions, an enzyme binds the interme-
diate and ADP in its active site and then transfers the phosphate from the 
intermediate to ADP (see Figure 11-6). Molecules that bind into the active site 
of enzymes are called substrates, and putting a phosphate on a molecule is 
called phosphorylation, so this method of ATP production is called substrate-
level phosphorylation to indicate that the phosphate came from a substrate. 
Substrate-level phosphorylation is possible because the removal of the phos-
phate from the substrate is exergonic. The cell captures some of that energy 
for later use by forming ATP.

Living by glycolysis alone: Fermentation
Many cells on planet Earth have the ability to survive using glycolysis alone, 
without the rest of the cellular respiration. In fact, some cells can’t do cellular 
respiration at all. Cells that rely upon glycolysis combine it with a fermenta-
tion step in order to recycle the NADH produced in glycolysis.
Fermentation occurs as either lactic acid fermentation or alcohol fermenta-
tion, as shown in Figure 11-7.

✓ Lactic acid fermentation: Cells that use this type as their primary cata-
bolic pathway do glycolysis, producing 2 pyruvate, 2 NADH + H+ and 2 
ATP. Then enzymes transfer electrons from NADH back to pyruvate, 
causing it to become lactic acid, and recycling the NADH back to NAD+ 
so that glycolysis can proceed again.

166
Part III: The Working Cell 
 
 Cells that do lactic acid fermentation benefit because they get the ATP 
they need for cellular work. Lactic acid is a waste product of the cell — 
one that humans find quite tasty! People use lactic acid bacteria, such 
as Lactobacillus, in the preparation of food such as yogurt. And although 
most human cells must do cellular respiration to survive, your muscle 
cells have the ability to do lactic acid fermentation when oxygen is 
scarce. So, next time you’re working out, breathing hard, and starting to 
feel your muscles tingle, your muscle cells have probably switched into 
lactic acid fermentation in order to keep making ATP!
 
✓ Alcohol (ethanol) fermentation: Yeast use this type of fermentation 
reaction during the production of bread, beer, and wine. It’s a little more 
complicated than lactic acid fermentation, but the basic principle is the 
same: The cells do glycolysis, which produces 2 pyruvate, 2 NADH + 
H+, and 2 ATP. Then, decarboxylation removes a carbon atom and two 
oxygen atoms from pyruvate, releasing the atoms as carbon dioxide 
(CO2). The decarboxylation of pyruvate converts it into a new molecule, 
called acetaldehyde. (The release of CO2 is what causes bread to rise 
and makes bubbles in beer.) Then, enzymes transfer electrons from 
NADH to acetaldehyde, changing it to ethanol and recycling the NADH 
back to NAD+ so that glycolysis can proceed again.
 
 Ethanol is a waste product to the yeast cells. Although ethanol burns 
off during the baking of bread, it remains in beer and wine which is 
what makes them alcoholic beverages.
Lactic acid fermentation and alcohol fermentation are just two examples of 
the many microbial fermentations that are important in the food industry and 
other industries as well. Although plants and animals rely upon the entire 
process of cellular respiration in order to survive, many microbes get the job 
done with fermentation!
The Wheel of Fire: Krebs Cycle
The Krebs cycle, which occurs in the mitochondrion, picks up where glyco-
lysis left off and has basically the same purpose: The oxidation of intermedi-
ates that came from food molecules and the transfer of energy from these 
intermediates to a usable form for the cell. Overall, the major events of the 
Krebs cycle are as follows:

167
 Chapter 11: Cellular Respiration: Every Breath You Take
 
✓ Enzymes oxidize intermediates and reduce electron carriers. 
Oxidation of intermediates is the real work of the Krebs cycle. Multiple 
redox reactions transfer electrons from intermediates in the cycle to the 
electron carriers NAD+ and FAD. These oxidations are exergonic, trans-
ferring both energy and electrons to the electron carriers. As cellular 
respiration continues, the reduced carriers, NADH and FADH2, transfer 
the energy and electrons to the electron transport chain, helping to 
make ATP.
 
✓ Enzymes break bonds and rearrange atoms in the intermediates, 
removing carbon and oxygen atoms and releasing them as CO2. 
Decarboxylation happens three times for every molecule of pyruvate 
that leaves glycolysis and enters the Krebs cycle. Because glycolysis 
produces two 3-carbon molecules from glucose, the Krebs cycle occurs 
twice for every molecule of glucose that enters cellular respiration. 
Thus, two rounds of the Krebs cycle produce six molecules of carbon 
dioxide. Decarboxylation during the Krebs cycle releases all six of the 
carbon atoms that were originally part of the glucose molecule. The last 
step of the Krebs cycle rearranges the atoms in the intermediate malate 
to recreate the intermediate, oxaloacetate, which is needed for the cycle 
to repeat again.
 
✓ Enzymes transfer energy to ATP. Most of that energy is transferred to 
the electron carriers when they’re reduced. However, during one step of 
the Krebs cycle, energy is transferred directly to ATP by substrate-level 
phosphorylation. Because the Krebs cycle occurs twice for every glu-
cose molecule that goes through cellular respiration, a total of 2 ATP per 
glucose are made during Krebs.
 
When you look at a biochemical pathway, such as those in Figures 11-7 or 11-8, 
clues tell you what is going on during each reaction. ATP is an energy carrier 
for cells, so any time you see ATP participating in a reaction, you know that an 
energy transfer is occurring. If ATP is being used, then energy is being trans-
ferred into the reaction. If ATP is being made, then energy is being transferred 
out of the reaction. Likewise, NAD+ is an electron carrier for cells, so any time 
you see NAD+/NADH participating in a reaction, you know that electrons are 
being transferred.

Linking glycolysis and Krebs
The Krebs cycle officially begins when a 2-carbon molecule, acetyl-CoA, is 
joined with a 4-carbon molecule, oxaloacetate, to form a 6-carbon molecule, 
citrate. However, glycolysis produces two 3-carbon molecules, pyruvate, 

169
 Chapter 11: Cellular Respiration: Every Breath You Take
from every molecule of glucose that passes through the pathway. So, in order 
to begin the Krebs cycle, pyruvate must first be converted into acetyl-CoA.
The series of reactions that convert pyruvate into acetyl-CoA have many 
names, including the linking step, the grooming step, the bridging step, and 
pyruvate oxidation. I refer to it as pyruvate oxidation because I think that 
term is the most clear about what is actually happening.
Here are the events that occur during pyruvate oxidation:
 
✓ Enzymes rearrange the atoms in pyruvate, removing carbon and oxygen, 
then releasing them asCO2. This decarboxylation reduces the number of 
carbon atoms in the intermediates from 3 to 2.
 
✓ Enzymes oxidize pyruvate and then transfer the electrons to the elec-
tron carrier NAD+. This reduction of NAD+ converts it to NADH + H+.
 
✓ Enzymes add coenzyme A to an intermediate, forming acetyl-CoA. 
Coenzyme A will be released from acetyl-CoA as it enters the Krebs 
cycle.
 
Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell, but the Krebs cycle occurs in 
the interior matrix of the mitochondrion. (See Chapter 2 for the structure of 
the mitochondrion.) Thus, in order for pyruvate to be oxidized and continue 
into the Krebs cycle, it has to cross the two membranes that separate the inte-
rior of the mitochondrion from the cytoplasm of the cell. The outer membrane 
of the mitochondrion is relatively easy to cross because it contains proteins 
called porins that allow small molecules to get through. The inner membrane, 
however, is highly impermeable, which means very few things can cross it 
unless they have help from a specific transport protein. There is such a trans-
port protein to help pyruvate get across so that pyruvate can be converted 
into acetyl Co-A and enter the Krebs cycle.
Fine print: The steps of the Krebs cycle
Beginning with the joining of acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate, the Krebs cycle 
has eight sets of reactions, shown in Figure 11-8:
 
1. Enzymes join the 2-carbon molecule acetyl-CoA with the 4-carbon mol-
ecule oxaloacetate, creating the 6-carbon molecule citrate.
 
 During this process, a water molecule is incorporated into the interme-
diate and coenzyme-A is released back to the cell.
 
2. An enzyme rearranges the bonds in citrate, creating the molecule 
isocitrate.

170
Part III: The Working Cell 
 
 The number of carbon atoms in the intermediate doesn’t change.
 
3. Enzymes oxidize and decarboxylate isocitrate, converting it to the 
5-carbon molecule α-ketoglutarate. Enzymes transfer the electrons 
removed from isocitrate to the electron carrier NAD+, reducing it 
to NADH + H+. Enzymes release the carbon removed from isocitrate 
as CO2.
 
4. Enzymes oxidize and decarboxylate α-ketoglutarate, converting 
it to the 4-carbon molecule succinyl-CoA. Enzymes transfer the 
electrons from α-ketoglutarate to the electron carrier NAD+, reduc-
ing it to NADH + H+. Enzymes release the carbon removed from 
α-ketoglutarate as carbon dioxide CO2.
 
 Enzymes require the help of coenzyme A during these reactions and add 
it to the intermediate.
 
5. Enzymes remove coenzyme A from succinyl-CoA and release it back 
to the cell, changing succinyl-CoA into succinate.
 
 This reaction is exergonic and allows the phosphorylation of ADP by 
substrate-level phosphorylation, producing a molecule of ATP.
 
 Substrate-level phosphorylation during the Krebs cycle may produce 
ATP or it may produce a very similar energy carrier called guanosine 
triphosphate (GTP). Two different enzymes can catalyze substrate-level 
phosphorylation during the Krebs cycle, and each one prefers either 
ADP or GDP in its active site.
 
6. Succinate is oxidized, converting it to fumarate. The electrons 
removed from succinate are transferred to the electron carrier FAD, 
which is reduced to FADH2.
 
 FAD/FADH2 have a similar structure to NAD+/NADH and perform the 
same function as electron carriers for the cell. In this case, the carrier 
FAD works better with the enzyme that catalyzes this reaction.
 
7. An enzyme catalyzes the addition of a water molecule to fumarate, 
converting it to malate.
 
8. Malate is oxidized, converting it to oxaloacetate. The electrons 
removed from malate are transferred to the electron carrier NAD+, 
which is reduced to NADH + H+.
 
 The re-creation of oxaloacetate brings you back to the beginning of the 
Krebs cycle, which can occur again with the addition of another mol-
ecule of acetyl-CoA.

More is better: Taking advantage 
of the Krebs cycle
One of the most important functions of cellular respiration is to transfer 
energy from food molecules to a form that cells can use to do work. To get 
the energy out of food, cells oxidize food molecules. The oxidation of food 
molecules is highly exergonic, so, if you’re a cell that is trying to get energy 
out of food, the more oxidation you do, the better, right?
Now, take a look at glycolysis and the Krebs cycle and compare the two 
pathways (refer to Figures 11-6 and 11-8). Glycolysis has one oxidation step, 
which you can recognize because NADH + H+ is formed. Pyruvate oxida-
tion and Krebs have a total of five oxidation steps, which you can recognize 
because NADH + H+ and FADH2 are formed. When you consider that Krebs 
happens twice per glucose molecule, the number of oxidation steps doubles 
to 10! So, if oxidation of food molecules makes energy available to the cell, 
it’s pretty clear which pathway gives more bang for each glucose molecule — 
cells that have the enzymes to do the Krebs cycle are much more efficient at 
extracting energy from their food than are cells that can do only glycolysis!
Taking It to the Bank: Chemiosmosis 
and Oxidative Phosphorylation
ATP is the most useful energy carrier for cells: Whenever a cell needs to do 
a job, it’s usually ATP that provides the necessary energy. This need for ATP 
explains why cellular respiration is so important to cells — it’s the way to use 
the energy from food molecules to make ATP. However, if you look at glycoly-
sis and the Krebs cycle, there isn’t a whole lot of ATP being made. Even more 
puzzling, by the end of the Kreb’s cycle, an incoming food molecule has been 
completely broken down and released back to the environment as carbon 
dioxide (CO2). So, where’s all the ATP?
The answer to that question is found in the chemiosmotic theory of oxidative 
phosphorylation — a really big name for an explanation of how energy and 
electrons from food help make ATP. You see, by the end of glycolysis and 
Krebs, a cell hasn’t made much ATP per glucose molecule, but it has made a 
whole bunch of reduced electron carriers, mostly NADH + H+ but a couple of 
FADH2, also. These carriers received electrons and energy when intermedi-
ates in glycolysis and the Krebs cycle were oxidized, and now they can cash 
them in to make ATP by using an electron transport chain.

172
Part III: The Working Cell 
Electron transport chains are made of large protein complexes embedded 
in a membrane (see Figure 11-9). They accept electrons and pass them from 
complex to complex, much like the runners in a relay race pass a baton. As 
the electrons are passed along the chain, some of the protein complexes 
transfer energy from the redox reactions and use it to do work like moving 
hydrogen ions (H+) across the membrane. The electron transport chain 
that is part of cellular respiration is located in the inner membrane of the 
mitochondrion.

The electron transport chains that are embedded in the inner membrane of 
the mitochondrion have an important partner — an enzyme called ATP syn-
thase. This enzyme gets its name because it makes, or synthesizes, ATP. Most 
of the ATP that is made by cellular respiration is made by this protein in a pro-
cess called the chemiosmotic theory of oxidative phosphorylation, or just oxi-
dative phosphorylation for short.
ATP synthase is embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane right along 
with the electron transport chain (see Figure 11-9). On one side of the mem-
brane is the intermembrane space; on the other side is the matrix of the 
mitochondrion. During oxidative phosphorylation, hydrogen ions (H+), which 

173
 Chapter 11: Cellular Respiration: Every Breath You Take
are also called protons, enter a small channel in ATP synthase from the inter-
membrane space side of the membrane. The protons bind to the ATP syn-
thase and then exit the protein on the matrix side. As they bind to the ATP 
synthase, the head of the protein rotates. The base of the protein has binding 
sites for ADP and inorganic phosphate (P). The passage of every three pro-
tons through the ATP synthase provides enough energy for the synthesis of 
one ATP molecule from ADP and P.
Transferring electrons along 
an electron transport chain
Electron transport chains accept electrons from an electron donor, pass 
them along through the protein complexes in the chain, and then pass them 
to a final electron acceptor. When a complex accepts electrons, it’s reduced; 
when it gives them up, it’s oxidized: so, as the electrons move along the 
chain, a series of redox reactions occurs. The electrons move from complex 
to complex along the chain because each member of the chain is more elec-
tronegative, or has more pull for electrons, than the complex before it.
 
You can think of the proteins in the electron transport chain as a bunch of 
kids who all want the same piece of candy. A little kid is holding the candy. 
Only a stronger kid can pull the candy away from the little kid. Then, an even 
stronger kid can pull the candy away from the second kid, and so on. In an 
electron transport chain, the candy is the electron and the protein complexes 
are the bigger and bigger kids. In this analogy, the kid who ends up with the 
candy will be the strongest kid of all.
In an electron transport chain, the final electron acceptor has to have the 
most pull of all. During cellular respiration in eukaryotes, that job falls to 
oxygen (O2). Oxygen is highly electronegative and pulls the electrons from 
the chain. When oxygen accepts the electrons, it also picks up some protons 
(H+) and is reduced to water (H2O), which is why water is one of the waste 
products of cellular respiration.
The donors of electrons to the electron transport chain during cellular respi-
ration are the NADH and FADH2 molecules that were made during glycolysis 
and the Krebs cycle. These carriers are oxidized as they donate electrons to 
the beginning of the electron transport chain and are converted back to NAD+ 
and FAD. These “empty electron shuttle busses” can now go back to glycoly-
sis and Krebs and pick up more electron passengers.

174
Part III: The Working Cell 
Transferring energy from food to ATP
You eat food because it contains chemical potential energy. Your cells use cel-
lular respiration to transfer that energy to ATP, which is a more useful form 
of chemical potential energy for your cells. However, with the exception of 
the few ATP made by substrate-level phosphorylation during glycolysis and 
the Krebs cycle, the energy transfer from food to ATP is not direct. In fact, the 
energy path takes a few twists and turns that can seem downright strange:
 
1. Enzymes in glycolysis and Krebs transfer electrons from intermediates 
to electron carriers, increasing the potential energy of the carriers as 
they are reduced.
 
 NADH and FADH2 are now carrying the energy from food.
 
2. Reduced electron carriers transfer energy along with the electrons 
they donate to the electron transport chain.
 
 The energy is now part of the first protein complex in the chain.
 
3. As the complexes in the electron transport chain pass electrons along, 
they’re also passing some energy.
 
 However, at the same time, some of the complexes use some energy 
to actively transport hydrogen ions (H+) across the membrane. The 
concentrated hydrogen ions, which are also called protons, represent a 
source of potential energy that can do work. The potential energy of the 
concentrated protons, called proton motive force, now stores the energy 
from food.
 
4. The protein ATP synthase allows hydrogen ions to move back across 
the membrane.
 
 As the hydrogen ions move, they cause part of the ATP synthase to 
rotate, which increases energy in the ATP synthase. The enzyme uses 
this energy to join ADP and phosphate groups, making ATP. ATP finally 
stores the energy from food!
The steps of the chemiosmotic theory 
of oxidative phosphorylation
The chemiosmotic theory of oxidative phosphorylation is a widely accepted 
explanation for how scientists think the energy and electrons from food are used 
to make ATP during cellular respiration. In other words, it is the whole story of 
the electron transport chain, from NADH to oxygen, and from NADH to ATP.

175
 Chapter 11: Cellular Respiration: Every Breath You Take
 
As you read through the following steps, shown in Figure 11-9, notice that the 
path for the electrons is different than the path for energy. Use your finger to 
trace the pathway for each and practice “telling the story” out loud.
 
1. NADH donates electrons and energy to the electron transport chain. 
The first protein complex is reduced, while NADH is oxidized to 
NAD+.
 
2. Electrons move through the electron transport chain in a series of 
redox reactions, until they’re picked up by oxygen (O2), the final elec-
tron acceptor. Oxygen is reduced to water (H2O).
 
3. Protein complexes I, II, and III use energy from the redox reactions to 
pump hydrogen ions (protons) across the membrane.
 
 This step creates the potential energy of the proton motive force.
 
4. ATP synthase allows protons to recross the inner mitochondrial mem-
brane. As the protons pass through the protein, it uses the energy to 
join ADP and P into ATP.
 
To understand chemiosmosis, think about how people use dams to generate 
hydroelectric power. The trapping of water behind a dam represents a source 
of potential energy that can do work, just like the accumulation of hydrogen 
ions on one side of the membrane. When the water flows from behind the 
dam, it does work, such as turning a turbine to create electricity. This release 
of water to do work is similar to what happens when the protons flow through 
a channel in the protein ATP synthase. The turning of the turbine transfers 
energy to electricity for your home, just like the turning of ATP synthase trans-
fers energy to ATP for your cells.
Chemiosmosis is a complicated process, but it’s hugely important to life on 
Earth. It’s the most efficient way that cells have to make ATP, which is an 
absolutely essential energy source for cells. A cell that can do chemiosmosis 
is like a fuel-efficient car — the cell makes more ATP from its energy source, 
just like a hybrid car can go farther on a gallon of gasoline.
 
Chemiosmosis uses electron flow through an electron transport chain coupled 
with the transport of hydrogen ions (H+) across a membrane to transfer 
energy to ATP. Chemiosmosis occurs as part of cellular respiration and also 
photosynthesis (see Chapter 12).

176
Part III: The Working Cell 
Doing the math: How many ATP can 
you make from the energy in a glucose 
molecule?
The exact number of ATP molecules you’d get for breaking down a glucose 
molecule through cellular respiration would be pretty hard to actually count, 
but you can use the following rules to estimate what is theoretically possible:
 
✓ Every time a pair of electrons from NADH passes through the electron 
transport chain, ATP synthase gets enough energy to produce approxi-
mately three ATP molecules.
 
✓ Every time a pair of electrons from FADH2 passes through the electron 
transport chain, ATP synthase gets enough energy to produce approxi-
mately two ATP molecules.
 
✓ In eukaryotes, the NADH produced in the cytoplasm has to cross into 
the mitochondrion in order to donate electrons to the electron transport 
chain. Different cell types have different ways of moving this NADH into 
the mitochondrion, which can require energy comparable to the amount 
in one ATP molecule.
Heavy breathing
Have you ever wondered why you start to 
breathe harder when you’re working out? The 
answer, once again, is cellular respiration. 
When your muscles are doing lots of work, they 
need lots of ATP. Your cells make ATP by doing 
cellular respiration. In order to make ATP, you 
need oxygen to accept electrons at your elec-
tron transport chain. So, as you use up your ATP 
in your muscles, you breathe faster to bring in 
more oxygen, so you can have more oxygen in 
your mitochondria to accept more electrons, to 
make more ATP. This is why you breathe.
Everything you already knew about breath-
ing, such as bringing oxygen to your lungs and 
having your red blood cells carry it around your 
body, is all true, but that’s really more about how 
you get oxygen to your cells, not why your cells 
need it. The why is all about electron transport 
chains. Really. And if you’re denied oxygen for 
some reason, you die because no oxygen = no 
final electron acceptor = no ATP = no cellular 
work = cells cease to function = death.

177
 Chapter 11: Cellular Respiration: Every Breath You Take
With these rules, you can count up the products of cellular respiration and 
calculate the theoretical number of ATP molecules you could produce in cel-
lular respiration from the energy in one glucose molecule:
 
✓ Two ATP per glucose are produced during glycolysis.
 
✓ Two ATP per glucose are produced by the Krebs cycle.
 
✓ Two NADH per glucose are produced during glycolysis. If it costs one 
ATP to move these into the mitochondrion, then they’re worth only two 
ATP each (2 × 2 = 4 ATP for these NADH).
 
✓ Two FADH2 per glucose are produced by the Krebs cycle. The FADH2 
molecules are worth two ATP each, so 2 × 2 = 4 ATP for these FADH2.
 
✓ Eight NADH per glucose are produced by pyruvate oxidation and the 
Krebs cycle. The NADH molecules are worth three ATP each, so 8 × 3 = 
24 ATP for these NADH.
When you add up all the ATP molecules, that is 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 24 = 36 ATP per 
glucose. Because some cells, such as bacterial cells, don’t have to “pay” to 
transport NADH from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrion, these cells would 
get 2 more ATP. So, the theoretical max for the number of ATP per glucose 
molecule that is complete oxidized during cellular respiration is 36 – 38 ATP.
Breaking Down Complex Carbohydrates, 
Proteins, and Fats
In order for food molecules besides glucose to be broken down in cellular 
respiration, enzymes need to change the food molecules into intermediates 
in glycolysis or the Krebs cycle. Once the food molecules become intermedi-
ates in these pathways, they will be oxidized and their energy will be trans-
ferred to ATP.
Finding an on-ramp to the superhighway
Cellular metabolism consists of hundreds of chemical reactions that inter-
connect to make a vast network. The product of one pathway may be a reac-
tant or an intermediate in another. The molecules that move through this 

178
Part III: The Working Cell 
metabolic network are like little cars driving along the freeway. They can go 
down one freeway for a long time, or they can exit a freeway and move onto 
another one just like a molecule can exit one pathway and get picked up by 
another. Enzymes control the traffic flow — in order for a molecule to exit 
or enter a metabolic pathway at a particular point, there must be an enzyme 
that can turn it into the correct metabolic intermediate.
 
If you can think metabolism as a vast network of interconnected highways, then 
cellular respiration is the biggest interstate of them all. It’s like I-5 on the west 
coast of North America, running North to South from Canada to Mexico. Many 
other pathways connect to cellular respiration, just like many highways connect 
to I-5. Figure 11-10 shows the connections between some important metabolic 
pathways and cellular respiration. In order for food molecules other than glu-
cose to enter cellular respiration, enzymes in these connecting metabolic path-
ways break bonds and rearrange the atoms in the food molecules, turning them 
into intermediates in glycolysis or the Krebs cycle. At that point, an enzyme from 
glycolysis or Krebs can pick them up and feed them into the system.
Feeding complex carbohydrates 
into the system
Of all the food molecules, carbohydrates enter cellular respiration most 
easily because many of the intermediates in glycolysis are carbohydrates:
 
✓ Simple sugars, such as glucose, either fit right in or require few reac-
tions to convert them into an intermediate in glycolysis.
 
✓ Cellular respiration easily breaks down the complex carbohydrate 
starch, which is a common human food. Starch is a polymer of glucose, 
so once the enzyme amylase breaks the chain down into individual glu-
cose molecules, the glucose molecules fit right into glycolysis.
 
✓ Enzymes break down complex carbohydrates other than starch into 
their individual sugar components. Then, enzymes convert the simple 
sugars into intermediates in glycolysis.

Part III: The Working Cell 
Burning fat
Enzymes called lipases break the fats and oils into their two components: 
glycerol and fatty acids. Then, glycerol and fatty acids feed into cellular respi-
ration at two different locations:
 
✓ Glycerol is a 3-carbon compound. An enzyme converts it into glyceralde-
hyde-3-phosphate, an intermediate in glycolysis.
 
✓ Enzymes break fatty acids up into fragments containing 2 carbons each. 
Then, enzymes break these 2-carbon fragments into acetyl-CoA, an inter-
mediate in the Krebs cycle.
Breaking down proteins
Because of the unique features of proteins, it’s a little more work to get them 
ready for cellular respiration. Like other polymers, they’re broken down into 
their building blocks, so enzymes called proteases break the protein chains 
into their component amino acids. Then, enzymes make two major altera-
tions to amino acids so that they become intermediates in glycolysis or the 
Krebs cycle:
 
✓ Amino acids have nitrogen-containing amino groups. The intermediates 
in cellular respiration don’t have nitrogen-containing groups, so the 
amino group on amino acids must be removed by deamination before 
amino acids can enter glycolysis or Krebs.
 
✓ After deamination occurs, enzymes convert the remaining part of the 
amino acid into an intermediate in glycolysis or Krebs. The 20 different 
amino acids found in cells enter cellular respiration at various points. 
Where the converted amino acids enter the pathway depends largely 
upon their number of carbon atoms, but most amino acids enter as 
intermediates in the Krebs cycle.
It’s a Two-Way Street: Connections 
Between Metabolic Pathways
A major purpose of cellular respiration is to enable the transfer of energy 
from food to ATP. However, cellular respiration has another purpose: 
Through all the little reactions that convert one molecule into another into 
yet another, cellular respiration generates a wide diversity of metabolic 

181
 Chapter 11: Cellular Respiration: Every Breath You Take
intermediates. These intermediates come in handy when a cell needs to build 
a carbohydrate, protein, lipid, or nucleic acid for growth or repair. In other 
words, metabolism — cellular respiration included — is a two-way street: 
Catabolism breaks down food molecules, but anabolism builds new mole-
cules from the metabolic intermediates in cellular respiration. The pathways 
for drawing off intermediates for anabolism are the reverse of the ones used 
to feed macromolecules into cellular respiration (see Figure 11-11).

Reversing the flow of matter and energy
Enzymes break down macromolecules through cellular respiration, providing 
a source of energy for the cell. Or, if a cell needs to build a macromolecule, 
then enzymes use intermediates from within cellular respiration as building 
blocks during anabolism. Because all metabolic reactions rely upon enzymes, 
regulation of enzymes controls the direction of traffic through metabolic 
pathways. Enzymes are most commonly regulated through through feedback 
inhibition. (See Chapter 6 for a description of feedback inhibition.) This type 
of regulation is a simple feedback loop — if you have plenty of something, 
you don’t need to make more.
Because the most important product of cellular respiration is ATP, it makes 
sense that ATP would act as an inhibitor of the pathway. And, in fact, ATP 
inhibits several enzymes of cellular respiration:
 
✓ Phosphofructokinase, which catalyzes the third step in glycolysis
 
✓ Pyruvate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the oxidation of pyruvate into 
acetyl-CoA
 
✓ Citrate synthase, which catalyzes the synthesis of citrate from oxaloac-
etate and acetyl-CoA
 
When a cell has plenty of ATP, ATP binds to enzymes in glycolysis and the 
Krebs cycle, inhibiting their function and slowing the process of cellular respi-
ration until ATP supplies decrease.
Similarly, if a cell has plenty of NADH, cellular respiration is no longer 
needed. NADH inhibits the function of several enzymes in cellular respiration, 
including pyruvate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase.
Packing on the fat
Imagine you’ve been hanging out on the couch, eating snacks and watching 
TV. You’ve supplied your body with plenty of food, so your cells have made 
lots of ATP via cellular respiration. However, you haven’t been doing a lot of 
cellular work to use up that ATP. So, your cells contain a lot of ATP. That ATP 

183
 Chapter 11: Cellular Respiration: Every Breath You Take
is going to bind to enzymes in cellular respiration, inhibiting the enzymes and 
slowing down the process. In addition, ATP is going to bind to enzymes in fat 
synthesis pathways and cause their activity to speed up. Intermediates from 
glycolysis and the Krebs cycle are going to be rerouted into fat synthesis 
pathways:
 
✓ Enzymes use glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate from glycolysis to produce 
glycerol.
 
✓ Enzymes use many molecules of acetyl-CoA to synthesize fatty acids.
The result? The food you’re eating is going to be converted to fat molecules.
Building muscle
In order to build proteins, whether for muscles or other cells, amino acids 
must be strung together in long chains. Adult humans can make 11 of the 20 
amino acids necessary for protein synthesis; the other amino acids must be 
obtained from the diet and thus are called the essential amino acids. Enzymes 
synthesize most amino from intermediates in the Krebs cycle.
Cellular respiration in the real world
Anyone who has ever tried to lose weight knows the story: “Eat less, exer-
cise more.” This advice helps a person lose weight for several reason, but 
one main reason is the effect that it has on cellular respiration. By exercis-
ing more, cells use up their supplies of ATP and increase the amount of 
ADP. ADP stimulates enzymes in cellular respiration, triggering an increase 
in the breakdown of food molecules. If you combine this stimulation with a 
decrease in the amount of food you’re eating, then your cells have to turn to 
your stored food molecules to fuel cellular respiration. In other words, they 
have to turn to your stored fat. Lipases break fats down into glycerol and 
fatty acids, then enzymes in cellular respiration break these building blocks 
down even further. The amount of fat stored in your fat cells, or adipose 
tissue, decreases, and you lose weight.

184
Part III: The Working Cell 
Where does the weight go?
At some point in your life, you’ve probably lost 
at least a pound or two, or maybe even more. 
When you lost weight, where did it go? You 
probably know that when you ate less and exer-
cised more, your body turned to your stored fat 
for energy. However, energy doesn’t weigh 
anything, so that doesn’t explain where the 
weight went. Fat is made of glycerol and fatty 
acids — in other words, lots of carbon, hydro-
gen, and oxygen atoms. It’s the atoms that actu-
ally weigh something, so where did they go?
When your body broke down the fat, it used 
cellular respiration. The waste products of 
cellular respiration are carbon dioxide (CO2) 
and water (H2O) — also made of carbon, 
hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. So, when your 
body breaks down fat in cellular respiration, 
you lose the weight through the carbon diox-
ide you breathe out and the water you lose 
in your sweat and urine. Hard to believe you 
can actually breathe away fat molecules, but 
it’s true. Of course, you still need to follow 
the old “eat less, exercise more” advice that 
is needed to ramp up fat breakdown — too 
bad deep breathing alone couldn’t get the job 
done!

Photosynthesis: Makin’ Food 
in the Kitchen of Life
In This Chapter
▶ Bringing matter and energy together to make food
▶ Transforming light energy to chemical energy
▶ Capturing carbon
P
lants, along with algae (seaweeds) and some bacteria, make the food on 
which all living things depend. They do photosynthesis, using energy from 
the sun and matter from carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) to form carbohy-
drates (sugars). In this chapter, I journey into a plant cell to show how photo-
synthesis makes the carbohydrates that serve as the building blocks of life.
Photosynthesis: An Overview
Photosynthesis transfers light energy (from the Sun) into chemical energy (stored 
in carbohydrates) that is usable by living things. With these carbohydrates and 
some minerals, living things can build all the molecules needed for life: proteins, 
carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids.
Photosynthesis is usually represented by the following chemical reaction:
6 CO2 + 6 H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6 O2
This reaction summarizes all the events of photosynthesis into one chemical 
sentence with reactants on the left of the arrow and products on the right 

186
Part III: The Working Cell 
side of the arrow. Because it ignores the gory details, this summary reaction 
is useful for thinking about the big picture of photosynthesis:
 
✓ Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms from carbon dioxide and water 
are rearranged to form sugar (glucose) and oxygen. This reaction 
represents a transfer of matter from the environment (carbon dioxide 
from the air, water from the soil) into matter inside the plant body 
(sugars) and waste back to the atmosphere (oxygen).
 
✓ Light energy from the sun is transformed into chemical energy and stored 
in the bonds of sugar for later use by the plant (or, if the plant is unlucky, 
by something that eats the plant).
 
The overall purpose of photosynthesis is to combine matter and energy into 
one tidy package: food in the form of carbohydrates.
As an analogy, compare a baker making a cake to a plant doing photosynthesis. 
A baker would put the cake’s building blocks, such as eggs, flour, and milk, 
into a bowl. A plant would bring matter in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2) 
and water (H2O) into its cells. The eggs, flour, and milk contain all the neces-
sary ingredients to make the cake, but at this point, they don’t look much like 
a cake. Similarly, the carbon dioxide and water contain the carbon, hydrogen, 
and oxygen atoms that are needed to build carbohydrates, but they’re not yet 
in the right arrangement. In order to create the changes they want in the cake, 
the baker places it into the oven. The heat energy from the oven helps the cake 
batter change. Likewise, plants absorb light energy from the sun and use it to 
power a series of reactions that build carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and 
water. The light energy from the sun acts like the heat from the oven, changing 
those raw materials into something different — carbohydrates!
Getting what plants need
You may have noticed that plants don’t get around much. They’re pretty 
much stuck where they put down their roots. Sometimes, I think people 
overlook plants because they don’t seem very exciting. I mean, plants are 
just sitting there, not doing anything, right? Most people don’t realize just 
how amazing plants really are. For example, imagine if I buried you in dirt up 
to your knees and told you to hang out that way for a few weeks. You could 
have any water that fell from the sky, and whatever else you bring into your 
body without actually moving from that spot. I’m guessing you wouldn’t be 
happy for very long.
So, how do plants manage to stay in one spot yet do so well? The main reason 
is that they’re autotrophs, meaning they can make their own food. (Autotroph 
literally means “self-feeding.”) While you would slowly starve if not allowed 
to move from one spot, plants make all the food they need through photosyn-
thesis. All they need in order to do photosynthesis is water, carbon dioxide, 
and sunlight, and these things essentially come to them.

 Chapter 12: Photosynthesis: Makin’ Food in the Kitchen of Life
Plant structures (see Figure 12-1) are specialized for taking in the materials 
that they need:
 
✓ Roots take water from the soil.
 
✓ Xylem, tubes of cells specialized for water transport, moves water from 
the roots throughout the plant.
 
✓ Phloem, tubes of cells that are specialized for sugar transport, move 
sugars from the green leaves (where the sugars are made) to the rest of 
the plant.
 
✓ Stomates — little pores in the leaves — let carbon dioxide into the leaves.
 
✓ Chlorophyll, the green pigment in the leaves, absorbs light.
 
Plant leaves are full of the green pigment chlorophyll, which is very good at 
absorbing blue and red light, but not very good at absorbing green or yellow 
light. So, when you look at a leaf on a plant, you see green because the chloro-
phyll in the plant leaf is absorbing blue and red light and letting the green 
bounce off, or reflect, from the surface of the leaf.

Examining the role of soil
You may be thinking, “What about soil? Since kindergarten, I’ve thought that 
plants need soil!” to survive. Well, my answer is that plants don’t, really. Soil 
is useful to plants because it gives them something sturdy to stand in, it may 
hold water for them, and it may be full of lots of lovely minerals that plants 
need to keep their metabolism running smoothly. However, if you give them 
other means of support and fertilizer, plants will do just fine without soil. 
Hydroponic gardeners, who grow plants without soil, rely upon this fact.
Soil and commercial plant fertilizers typically contain nitrogen, phosphorous, 
potassium, and small amounts of other minerals, such as calcium, magne-
sium, and iron. Nitrogen and phosphorous are needed for the construction 
of macromolecules other than carbohydrates. For example, proteins contain 
large amounts of nitrogen. If a plant cell needs to build proteins, it takes 
some of its stored carbohydrates (which contain C, H, and O), adds nitrogen, 
and rearranges the atoms to form a protein. Minerals such as calcium, mag-
nesium, and iron are necessary for the proper function of proteins. So, soil 
basically does for plants what a vitamin and mineral supplement does for 
your body.
 
Some fertilizers are called plant food, but they’re not really food! They contain 
the same minerals as other fertilizers, but someone thought “plant food” 
sounded better than “plant fertilizer.” Plants make their own food and then 
use that food to grow. When a plant grows bigger, most of the matter it uses to 
build its tissues comes from carbon dioxide from the air, not from the small 
amount of minerals it takes up through its roots!
Basking in the sun
Everyone knows that the Sun sends light to the Earth, but did you know that 
the Sun’s radiation contains more than the light you can see? In fact, the light 
you can see, called visible light, is only a tiny part of the wide band of elec-
tromagnetic radiation that the sun sends to the Earth. The different types of 
radiation from the sun are shown in Figure 12-2 and probably sound familiar 
to you — things like x-rays, ultraviolet radiation (the stuff that causes skin 
cancer), and microwaves. Plants capture electromagnetic radiation within 
the visible light band for photosynthesis.
The different types of electromagnetic radiation travel from the Sun to the 
Earth in waves. Each type of electromagnetic energy is identified by its 
wavelength, the distance from one energy peak to another. (A nanometer is 
1/100,000,000 of a meter, so wavelengths of light are pretty small!) The radia-
tion captured by plants for photosynthesis has wavelengths between 400 and 

189
 Chapter 12: Photosynthesis: Makin’ Food in the Kitchen of Life
700 nanometers. Radiation with wavelengths of 400 nanometers is visible as 
blue light, while radiation with wavelengths around 700 nanometers are 
visible as red light.
To understand wavelength, imagine looking at the wake of a boat and seeing 
the spread of ripples over the water. If you water-skied across the boat wake, 
you’d go up and down as you hit each crest. If you measured the distance 
from one crest to another, you’d know the wavelength between the ripples.

Capturing the Sun’s energy with pigments
All living things that do photosynthesis have some form of chlorophyll, as 
well as other photosynthetic pigments.
Figure 12-3 shows the different kinds of light absorbed by each of these 
pigments:
 
By having chlorophyll a, plus these other accessory pigments, photosynthetic 
organisms increase the wavelengths of light energy they can absorb for use in 
photosynthesis.
Yin and yang: The light reactions 
and the Calvin cycle
Here’s another look at the summary reaction for photosynthesis:

Written in a kind of chemical shorthand, this reaction is a good reminder 
of the overall purpose of photosynthesis. It shows the transfer of matter 
(carbon dioxide and water) and energy (light) from the environment into 
the plant where they’re combined to produce food in the form of carbo-
hydrates (glucose), while oxygen is released back to the environment as 
waste. This combination of matter and energy into food represents the 
“why” of photosynthesis.
Now, turn your attention to the details of the process of photosynthesis — in 
other words, the “how.” Like the metabolic processes described in Chapter 
10, photosynthesis is complicated, involving the transfer of electrons, atoms, 
and energy from one form to another. I will try to keep this explanation man-
ageable by starting with the bigger picture and moving toward the details.
First of all, photosynthesis doesn’t occur in one step as indicated by the 
summary reaction. As is typical in metabolism, lots of little steps make up 
the whole. During photosynthesis, these little steps are organized into two 
separate sets of reactions in the plant: the light reactions and the Calvin cycle. 
Figure 12-4 gives an overview of these two pathways and shows how they’re 
connected. (The rest of this chapter covers the details of these pathways.)
 
✓ In light reactions, plants capture light energy from the Sun and trans-
form it into chemical energy in the form of the energy molecule ATP. 
Plants also take electrons from H2O and transfer them to the electron 
carrier nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). NADPH 

191
 Chapter 12: Photosynthesis: Makin’ Food in the Kitchen of Life
has a very similar structure and function as the electron carrier NADH. 
(See Chapters 10 and 11 for more about NADH.)
 
✓ In the Calvin cycle, plants capture carbon dioxide (CO2) and convert it 
into carbohydrates. To do this conversion, they need the molecules that 
were made during the light reactions: ATP provides chemical energy, 
and NADPH provides the necessary electrons.
To understand the role of electrons and NADPH in the process of photo-
synthesis, compare the chemical formulae for carbon dioxide (CO2) and the 
carbohydrate glucose (C6H12O6). If you want to turn CO2 into C6H12O6, what do 
you need? In other words, what is missing from CO2? You probably noticed 
that what is missing is hydrogen (H), which is what NADPH provides to the 
process of sugar construction during the Calvin cycle. Essentially, this hydro-
gen is taken from water (H2O) during the light reactions and carried by NADPH 
to the Calvin cycle. NADPH donates the H needed to build C6H12O6 out of CO2.
 
When NADP+ accepts electrons, it’s converted to its reduced form, NADPH. 
You can tell that NADPH is the reduced form because you can see that it’s car-
rying a hydrogen atom at the end of its name. (Electrons are usually carried as 
part of hydrogen atoms.) The H in the name NADPH tells you that the electron 
carrier is bringing electron passengers to a new location. In the case of photo-
synthesis, it’s carrying electrons from the light reactions to the Calvin cycle.

Shine on Me: The Light Reactions
Every day, the sun beams a steady stream of energy to the planet, free for 
the taking to anyone who can use it. Plants may be the cleverest of all living 
things because they’ve evolved a way to do just that! During the light reac-
tions of photosynthesis, they spread their leaves to the sky and absorb some 
of that energy, transforming it into chemical energy in the form of the energy 
molecule ATP. Cells use ATP as a convenient source of chemical energy to 
power the daily work of the cell.
Transferring light energy 
to chemical energy
Photosynthesis is possible because the photosynthetic pigments that absorb 
the light are hooked up to a little cellular machine that transfers the light 
energy into chemical energy stored in the bonds of the energy molecule ATP. 
The cellular machine that makes this energy transfer possible is an electron 
transport chain. (For more on electron transport chains, see Chapter 11.) 
Figure 12-5 shows the electron transport chain used in photosynthesis.
The electron transport chain for photosynthesis essentially works the same 
way as the one that is used in cellular respiration (see Chapter 11). Proteins 
in a membrane pass electrons in a series of redox reactions, using energy 
from this transport to pump protons (H+) across the membrane. Then, ATP 
synthase uses the potential energy of the protons to make ATP. If you under-
stand this process, called chemiosmosis, from cellular respiration, you’ve 
already got it down for photosynthesis.
When plant cells use light energy and electron transport chains to make ATP, 
it’s called photophosphorylation. In this case, plant cells are adding a phos-
phate to ADP, which is the building block for ATP.
 
Photophosphorylation is really just another way of saying “the light reactions 
of photosynthesis.”
The electron transport chains for photosynthesis are embedded in the thy-
lakoid membranes of chloroplasts and contain both chlorophyll a molecules 
and accessory pigments to absorb light energy. The chlorophyll a molecules 
form reaction centers, key locations where the light energy is transferred into 
the electron transport system. All the other pigments within the membrane 
form an antenna complex that absorbs light energy and transfers it into these 
reaction centers. When the reaction center chlorophyll receives light energy, 

193
 Chapter 12: Photosynthesis: Makin’ Food in the Kitchen of Life
its electrons are excited to a higher energy state, causing them to move first 
to outer electron orbitals and then to jump to a protein in the electron 
transport chain.
 
When energy flows from the antenna complex to the reaction center chlorophyll, 
it’s a little bit like people “doing the wave” at a sporting event. Imagine yourself 
as the reaction center chlorophyll. Light energy is absorbed by the other pig-
ments, causing them to be energized like a line of people standing up to do the 
wave. The wave travels nearer and nearer to you and then arrives at your loca-
tion. You’re excited and jump up to do the wave! Lifting your arms is like your 
electrons moving to a higher orbital. If you were the reaction center chlorophyll, 
you’d then pass one of these electrons to the electron transport chain.
When the excited electron from chlorophyll is transferred to the electron 
transport chain, the plant cell has successfully transferred light energy to 
chemical energy!
The steps of photophosphorylation
Photophosphorylation means making ATP using the energy from light. 
Although this process and the making of ATP during cellular respiration (see 
Chapter 11) are similar, the processes also have several differences. In par-
ticular, the sources of energy and electrons for photosynthesis are different 
than they are for respiration. In photosynthesis, light provides the energy, 
and water provides the electrons. In cellular respiration, both the energy and 
the electrons come from food molecules.
Live like a plant
Solar panels transform light energy to electri-
cal energy that people use to light and heat 
homes. Solar panels are actually more efficient 
than plants at transforming light energy — 
plants transform about 6 percent of the avail-
able energy to chemical energy, whereas solar 
panels can transform 10 to 20 percent of the 
available energy. As the amount of fossil fuels 
on Earth continues to decrease, people need 
to find new ways to fulfill their energy needs. 
Sunlight is clean and free for the taking, so 
solar energy could help solve both the human 
energy crisis and the human pollution problem. 
Solar power can provide enough energy for 
many human needs even in cloudy parts of the 
world — Germany is the world’s leader in solar 
energy even though it doesn’t have any more 
sunny days than cloudy Seattle.

194
Part III: The Working Cell 
Two different types of photophosphorylation occur in cells:
 
✓ In noncyclic photophosphorylation, which is also called the Z-scheme, 
electrons from chlorophyll travel through an electron transport chain 
then reduce NADP+ to NADPH (see Figure 12-5).
 
✓ In cyclic photophosphorylation, electrons from chlorophyll travel a circuit, 
leaving chlorophyll when they get excited and returning to chlorophyll 
after their energy has been transferred to ATP (see Figure 12-6).
 
Cyclic photophosphorylation gets its name from the cycle that the electrons 
make from chlorophyll to an electron transport chain and back to chlorophyll 
again. Noncyclic photophosphorylation gets its name because the electrons 
take a one-way ride from H2O to NADPH.

The complete steps of noncyclic photophosphorylation, shown in Figure 12-7, 
show how the energy and electrons are harvested in this process:
 
1. Light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll and the accessory pigments 
in the plant leaves, and the energy is transferred to reaction center 
chlorophylls.
 
2. The electrons from reaction center chlorophylls are excited and move 
to outer orbitals.
 
3. Proteins in the electron transport chain pull the electrons from chloro-
phyll and pass them along the chain of proteins.
 
4. Chemiosmosis is used to make ATP.
 
 During this process, energy from the movement of electrons is used 
to transport hydrogen ions (H+) across the thylakoid membrane. The 
hydrogen ions flow back across the membrane like water through a dam, 
and the energy of their movement is used to make ATP from ADP and 
inorganic phosphate. The protein ATP synthase produces the ATP.

5. The electrons are accepted at the end of the chain by the electron 
carrier NADP+, which changes NADP+ to its reduced form, NADPH + H+.
 
6. As light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll, some light energy is used 
to split water (H2O) molecules by photolysis into protons (H+), 
electrons (e-), and oxygen gas (O2).
 
 The electrons are transferred to chlorophyll to replace the electrons 
lost to the electron transport chain. The protons are released into the 
plant cell. The oxygen is released to the cell and then the atmosphere as 
a waste product of photosynthesis.
 
Oxygen (O2) produced by photosynthesis doesn’t come from carbon dioxide 
(CO2). Oxygen is produced when water is split to provide electrons to the light 
reactions. Thus, the O2 comes from the splitting of two H2O molecules.
Electrons from water don’t end up in the ATP made during the light reac-
tions. If you were to trace the flow of electrons during the light reactions, 
it would look like this: Electrons from water replace lost electrons in chlo-
rophyll, then go to the electron transport chain, and then are accepted by 
NADP+ to form NADPH + H+. The pathway of electrons during the light reac-
tions is different from the flow of energy during the light reactions: Light 
energy absorbed by chlorophyll, transfers to the electron transport chain, 
then transfers to proton motive force, and finally transfers to ATP.

The Circle of Life: Calvin Cycle
The light reactions of photosynthesis transfer light energy to chemical 
energy, producing the energy molecule ATP and the electron carrier NADPH 
+ H+. ATP provides usable energy to cells for the cellular work that is neces-
sary for survival. NADPH is an important source of electrons for reactions 
that build molecules for the cell. However, these two chemicals alone are not 
enough to provide the materials necessary for life. For living things to grow, 
repair themselves, and reproduce, they need a source of building materi-
als. The ultimate source of building materials for most life on Earth traces 
back to one process: the Calvin cycle. The Calvin cycle transforms inorganic 
carbon in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2) into organic carbon in the form 
of carbohydrates. All living things build their cells using organic carbon that 
ultimately traces back to the Calvin cycle or similar processes.
 
The Calvin cycle is also called the Calvin-Benson cycle, the Light Independent 
Reactions, and the Dark Reactions.

197
 Chapter 12: Photosynthesis: Makin’ Food in the Kitchen of Life
The steps of the Calvin cycle
The Calvin cycle takes place in the stroma of the chloroplast inside of plant 
cells. Like most metabolic pathways, the Calvin cycle is complicated and con-
tains many small steps. The ultimate result of this pathway is to produce car-
bohydrates from carbon dioxide. The process to make carbohydrates from 
carbon dioxide includes four important events, shown in Figure 12-8:
 
1. The enzyme Rubisco attaches carbon dioxide molecules to a 5-carbon 
sugar called ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP).
 
 Rubisco is a much-needed nickname for ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate 
carboxylase/oxygenase.
 
 This critical first step captures the carbon dioxide from the environment 
and is called carbon fixation. The 6-carbon molecules that are formed 
by this step immediately split into two copies of a 3-carbon molecule. 
These 3-carbon molecules are called 3-phosphoglycerate.
 
2. 3-phosphoglycerate is phosphorylated when it’s given a phosphate 
group from ATP, which transfers energy from ATP to the 3-phospho-
glycerate. Next, electrons from NADPH are transferred to the mol-
ecule, reducing it to the sugar glyceraldedehyde-3-phosphate (G3P).
 
 The plant has now officially made carbohydrates. The energy and electrons 
for this phase, called the reduction phase, came from the light reactions.
 
3. Some G3P is used to make glucose and other sugars.
 
 This process is called biosynthesis, or just synthesis, because the plant is 
making sugars.
 
4. Some G3P and ATP are used to regenerate RuBP, the 5-carbon sugar 
the plant started with.
 
 The plant needs to move carbons around to reproduce the starting 
molecule so that it can start over again. This step is called the 
regeneration phase.
Rubisco: Earth’s most important enzyme 
Rubisco has been called the most important 
enzyme on Earth because it takes the first step 
in food production upon which all life depends. 
Rubisco is the most abundant protein in leaves 
and may be the most abundant protein on Earth. 
Scientists are trying to genetically engineer 
plants to either make more Rubisco or make 
more efficient forms of Rubisco. Their goal is to 
increase the production of food and decrease 
the amount of carbon dioxide in the 
atmosphere.

Plants use energy from the Sun, electrons from H2O, and carbon from CO2 to 
make sugars. The energy and electrons in these sugars will ultimately be the 
electrons that are captured in cellular respiration to make ATPs. Therefore, 
the energy from the Sun, through the processes of photosynthesis and 
respiration, will be used to run your cells.
Got Food? Photosynthesis 
in the Real World
The carbohydrates made by plants, algae, and bacteria serve as the food for 
all life on Earth, which is why you’ll find one of these autotrophs at the bottom 
of every food chain. Food chains are a visual way to show how energy flows 
through living things. A simple food chain may include an autotroph that makes 
its own food, followed by a heterotroph that eats the autotroph. Heterotrophs, 
or other-feeders, are living things that get their matter and energy by eating 
others. For example, a cow eating grass would represent a simple food chain. 
The grass is the autotroph, and the cow is the heterotroph. If you ate a ham-
burger made from the cow, you could be added to the food chain as another 
heterotroph. This simple food chain would look like
Grass → Cow → You (human)

199
 Chapter 12: Photosynthesis: Makin’ Food in the Kitchen of Life
The arrows represent the flow of energy from the grass to the cow to you. 
The grass stored energy from the Sun in the form of carbohydrates. The 
cow got energy for its own metabolism and growth by eating the stored 
carbohydrates in the grass. You got energy for your metabolism and growth 
by eating the stored protein and fat from the cow. You and the cow made 
the chemical energy stored in the food available to your body by breaking 
down food molecules transferring energy to ATP. (For more on cellular res-
piration, see Chapter 11.)
In addition to getting energy from food, you also get the raw materials, or 
matter, you need to build your bodies. Your body can rearrange food mole-
cules and use the atoms in those molecules to build new molecules for your 
cells. (Yes, you are what you eat!) This adage is true for every living thing 
on Earth. For example, as the cow digests the carbohydrates from the grass 
and grows, it uses the raw materials from the carbohydrates to build the 
protein and fat molecules that it needs for its body. Carbohydrates provide 
the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms that are also found in proteins and 
fats. The cow also uses nitrogen and phosphorous atoms that it got from 
minerals in its diet in order to construct the protein and fat molecules.
This simple food chain is an example of how photosynthesis plays a role 
in your life every day. Obviously, the interactions between living things get 
much more complicated than this example. If you look outside, you can see 
many kinds of plants that are all doing photosynthesis. You can imagine all 
the different kinds of living things that are eating these plants and then the 
next layer of living things that eat the first layer! These types of complicated 
interactions, called food webs, are part of the study of ecology and are not 
my focus here. However, I think you can appreciate the importance of photo-
synthesis to the web of life that exists all around you. Photosynthesis is the 
cellular machine that is capturing the matter and energy from the environ-
ment and turning it into food that can be used by the entire web. Without the 
matter and energy from this food, there would be no life on Earth.
 
Photosynthesis isn’t the only food-building process on Earth. Some bacteria do 
chemosynthesis, transferring energy from the oxidation of inorganic chemicals 
to ATP. Then, these bacteria convert carbon dioxide to carbohydrates by 
using the Calvin cycle or other similar processes. All organisms that make food, 
whether by photosynthesis or chemosynthesis, are autotrophs. Chemosynthetic 
autotrophs live in many different environments, but they’re especially impor-
tant in environments without light, such as at the bottom of the ocean near 
hydrothermal vents.

Photosynthesis and global warming
Carbon dioxide is one of the most significant 
greenhouse gases because it traps heat that is 
reflecting off the Earth’s surface, redirecting it 
down toward Earth and contributing to global 
warming. Because it removes carbon dioxide 
from the atmosphere and converts it to plant 
tissue, photosynthesis can lead to fewer green-
house gases in the atmosphere and thus has 
the potential to lower surface temperatures.

ells divide in order to grow, repair tissues, and reproduce themselves. 
Cell division in bacteria is a fairly simple process, whereas cell divi-
sion in eukaryotes is much more complicated. In eukaryotes, cells progress 
through a cell cycle that includes dividing and nondividing phases. In this 
chapter, I present the steps of cell division in bacteria and eukaryotes as well 
as the mechanisms of regulation of the eukaryotic cell cycle.
Reproducing the Cell
Cells make copies of themselves in order to make new cells. In fact, an impor-
tant theory in cell biology called the Cell Theory says that all cells come from 
pre-existing cells. Cells make new cells for three reasons:
 
✓ Growth: Many living things begin as a single cell made from the fusion 
of a sperm and egg. That single cell becomes thousands of cells when 
cells copy themselves over and over again. For example, you began life 
as a single cell that was invisible to the naked eye, but now you’re much 
larger and quite visible. Most of that growth is the result of cell division.
 
✓ Repair: If a multicellular organism is wounded, cells surrounding the 
wound will reproduce themselves to repair the tissue. Next time you get 
a cut, watch the process as it heals. You’ll see new pink skin growing 
around the cut. That new skin is formed from the division of the skin 
cells that surrounded the cut.

✓ Reproduction: Single-celled organisms, such as bacteria and yeast, 
increase from single cells to populations by making exact copies of their 
cells. Some multicellular organisms can also produce new individuals by 
copying themselves. For example, you can make a cutting of some plants 
and use it to make an entirely new plant that will be genetically identical 
to the original. The process of making new individuals by copying the 
cells of existing organisms is called asexual reproduction.
Drifting Apart: Binary Fission
Bacteria have a simple process of copying their cells called binary fission (see 
Figure 13-1). Binary fission involves the following steps:
 
1. The bacterial cell makes a copy of its chromosome.
 
2. The bacterial cell gets larger as it makes copies of the ribosomes and 
molecules in the cytoplasm.
 
3. New plasma membrane and a cell wall are built to divide the cell 
into two.
Some bacteria can complete the whole process of binary fission in as little as 
10 minutes, reproducing from one cell to more than a thousand cells in just 2 
hours. Think about that fact the next time you leave food out on the kitchen 
counter!

 Chapter 13: Splitsville: The Cell Cycle and Cell Division
Red Light, Green Light: The Cell Cycle
Eukaryotic cells divide at different rates. Single-celled eukaryotes typically 
divide rapidly when food is available. In multicellular organisms, some cells 
divide frequently, while others rarely divide. Different types of human cells, 
for example, have different division behaviors:
 
✓ Some cells divide all the time. Cells on surfaces like skin and mucous 
membranes are constantly being shed from the body and need to be 
replaced so that cells in these tissues are always dividing to replace the 
lost cells.
 
✓ Some cells divide when signaled to divide. Some cells in organs like the 
liver don’t normally divide, but may be triggered to divide if the organ is 
damaged.
 
✓ Some cells don’t usually divide. Most cells in the nervous tissue of 
humans don’t divide. For example, if you have an injury that involves 
nerve damage in the spine, the nerves can’t be repaired.
 
The dividing phase of eukaryotic cells is called mitosis, and the nondividing 
phase is called interphase. Interphase contains three subphases: G1, S, and G2. 
The alternating cycle of mitosis and interphase is called the cell cycle 
(see Figure 13-2).

Pausing during Gap 1
Cells spend most of their time in the first phase of interphase, which is called 
Gap 1 (G1). Cells in G1 are active, functioning cells. They grow and copy all 
the cell contents except for the DNA. Mature cells, such as nerve cells, that 
won’t divide remain at rest in this phase at a point called G0 (pronounced 
“Gee Zero”).

204
Part III: The Working Cell 
Cells that are going to divide must pass a test, called a checkpoint, before 
they can exit G1 and enter the next phase of interphase. Checkpoints are 
points in the cell cycle where cells check to make sure that everything is pro-
ceeding normally. If cells can’t pass a checkpoint, repairs will be made, if pos-
sible. If not, the cell may be signaled to commit cell suicide, called apoptosis. 
In order for cells to pass the G1 checkpoint, several conditions must be met:
 
✓ Signals tell the cells to divide.
 
✓ Cells must have plenty of nutrients.
 
✓ The DNA must be in good condition.
 
✓ Cells must be large enough to divide.
The S phase and Gap 2
During S phase of interphase, cells copy their DNA by DNA replication. (See 
Chapter 17 for more on DNA.) In fact, S stands for synthesis because synthe-
sis means “to make,” and cells are making new DNA. After the DNA is copied, 
cells proceed to the next part of interphase.
During Gap 2, cells check the work they did during S phase at the G2 check-
point. Before cells can proceed out of G2 and into mitosis, several conditions 
are checked:
 
✓ The DNA isn’t damaged.
 
✓ The cell copied all the chromosomes.
 
✓ Signals tell the cell to proceed into mitosis.
Again, if cells can’t meet these conditions, they will be stuck in G2. If not, 
programmed cell death, called apoptosis, will be triggered, and the cell will 
commit suicide.
The importance of quality control
The protein p53 is the quality control agent for 
the G2 checkpoint. If the DNA is damaged, p53 
puts the brakes on the cell cycle and stops the 
cell in G2 so proteins can either repair the DNA 
or tell the cell to commit cell suicide. If p53 isn’t 
working properly, cells with damaged DNA may 
continue through the cell cycle, leading to the 
development of cancer. Because proteins like 
p53 help prevent cancer when they’re function-
ing normally, they’re called tumor suppressors.

205
 Chapter 13: Splitsville: The Cell Cycle and Cell Division
The Dance of the Chromosomes: Mitosis
Cells that enter mitosis, shown in Figure 13-3, have successfully copied their 
DNA and the rest of the contents of their cell. They’re ready to divide into two 
new cells, each of which has a complete copy of everything. Cells need to be 
particularly careful when they divide up the two copies of DNA so that each 
cell gets a complete set with one of every chromosome. The main purpose of 
mitosis is to make sure that the chromosomes are divided up correctly.

As an analogy for thinking about how mitosis works, imagine you have 23 
pairs of socks that are really special to you because they were hand-knitted 
for you by your mom. Your mom made the socks out of multicolored yarn so 
that each sock is unique. Even the two socks in a pair aren’t perfectly identical 
to each other. These socks are so special to you that you decide that you want 
to make exact copies of the socks so that you can give an identical 46 socks to 

206
Part III: The Working Cell 
your child. To accomplish this task, you take each sock and use it as a pattern 
to knit an exact replica. Then you line up the 46 socks, with each sock having 
its identical twin right next to it. You carefully separate the identical socks so 
that the one complete set of 46 socks goes into one pile for you to keep, and 
one complete set of 46 socks goes into another pile for your child.
You have 46 chromosomes, or 23 pairs, in each cell of your body. When your 
chromosomes are copied during S phase, each chromosome is used to make 
an exact copy of itself. The two identical copies — sister chromatids — remain 
attached to each other, as shown in Figure 13-3, at the centromere, forming 
replicated chromosomes that often look a little bit like the letter X. During 
mitosis, the cell organizes the pairs of chromosomes and carefully separates 
the sister chromatids from each other so that each new cell gets a complete 
set of 46 chromosomes.
The cell structure that has the responsibility for separating the pairs of chro-
mosomes is the mitotic spindle. The mitotic spindle is made of microtubules, 
which are cytoskeletal proteins. (For more on the cytoskeleton, see Chapter 2.) 
Microtubules work with the partner protein dynein to move structures in cells. 
Dynein and other proteins form protein clusters called kinetochores that attach 
to the replicated chromosomes at their centromeres. The proteins in the kine-
tochores walk along the microtubules of the mitotic spindle in order to move 
the chromosomes within the cell.
Mitosis is a carefully controlled process designed to organize and separate 
the chromosomes correctly. The four phases of mitosis have unique events 
that contribute to the careful sorting of the chromosomes:
 
✓ Prophase: During interphase, the DNA is uncoiled, and the chromo-
somes aren’t visible, even under a microscope. To get ready to be 
moved around, the chromosomes coil up tightly. Coiling of the chromo-
somes, called condensation, happens during prophase. The important 
events of prophase are
 
• The chromosomes coil up (condense) and become visible.
 
• The nuclear membrane breaks down so that the mitotic spindle 
can reach into the center of the cell.
 
• The mitotic spindle attaches to the chromosomes.
 
• The nucleoli break down and become invisible.
 
✓ Metaphase: During metaphase, cells organize the chromosomes by 
lining them up in the middle of the mitotic spindle. At the metaphase 
checkpoint, cells make sure that all the chromosomes are attached to the 
mitotic spindle. Cells can’t continue through mitosis unless they pass 
the metaphase checkpoint.

207
 Chapter 13: Splitsville: The Cell Cycle and Cell Division
 
✓ Anaphase: During anaphase, the replicated chromosomes are separated 
so that each sister chromatid goes to opposite sides of the cell. The 
identical sister chromatids are separated carefully to ensure that each 
new cell will get one. After the sister chromatids are separated from 
each other, they’re again called chromosomes.
 
✓ Telophase: Telophase wraps up mitosis by reversing the events of pro-
phase. During telophase, the following events occur:
 
• The chromosomes uncoil (decondense) and become invisible.
 
• The nuclear membrane reforms.
 
• The mitotic spindle breaks down.
 
• The nucleoli reform and become visible.
Breaking Up Is Hard to Do: Cytokinesis
After the chromosomes separate and the nuclear membrane reforms, the 
cytoplasm separates to form two distinct cells. The separation of the cyto-
plasm is called cytokinesis (see Figure 13-4).

208
Part III: The Working Cell 
Because plants have a cell wall and animals don’t, cytokinesis occurs differently
in the two types of cells:
 
✓ Cytokinesis in plant cells: Once the chromosomes move to opposite 
sides in a plant cell, new plasma membrane and cell wall are laid down 
in the middle of the cell. Small vesicles containing wall material line 
up in the middle of the cell. The vesicles then fuse together, bringing 
together the vesicle membranes and the wall material that was inside 
the vesicles. Finally, the membranes of the vesicles form the new plasma 
membranes for each cell. The wall material joins together to form the 
cell plate, which becomes the new cell wall between the two cells.
 
✓ Cytokinesis in animal cells: After the chromosomes move to opposites 
of an animal cell, the cell pinches in two to form two new animal cells. 
A band of actin microfilaments forms in the middle of the cell, and the 
actin microfilaments contract, forming a cleavage furrow down the 
middle of the cell. The actin microfilaments then act like a belt that is 
being tightened around the cell, pinching it into two new cells.
Keeping It Under Control
The progress of eukaryotic cells through the cell cycle is regulated by pro-
teins called cyclins. The amounts of cyclin proteins increase and decrease 
during the cell cycle. Cyclins bind to partner proteins called cyclin-dependent 
kinases (Cdks) to form activated complexes that trigger events in the cell 
cycle. During each phase of the cell cycle, the amount of different cyclins 
increases and binds to their partner protein:
 
✓ In G1, cyclins bind to a Cdks and form a complex that triggers cells to get 
the chromosomes ready for replication.
 
✓ In S phase, cyclins bind to Cdks and form a complex called S-phase pro-
moting factor that enters the nucleus and helps trigger DNA replication.
 
✓ In G2, cyclins bind to Cdks to form M-phase promoting factor, which 
triggers the formation of the mitotic spindle, breakdown of the nuclear 
envelope, and condensation of the chromosomes. In metaphase of mitosis,
M-phase promoting factor activates the process that triggers sister 
chromatids to separate.
Each type of cyclin is destroyed soon after it does its job in the cell cycle. 
When the cyclins from a particular phase of the cell cycle are destroyed, the 
phase can end, which helps prepare the way for the next phase to begin.

G
enetics tracks the inheritance of traits from one gen-
eration to the next. Living things that reproduce sex-
ually sort their chromosomes and pass copies to their 
offspring. The combination of genetic information from 
Mom and Dad determines the traits of offspring and can 
be predicted using the tools of genetics.
Mistakes and surprises sometimes happen on the way to 
making new offspring as well — chromosomes may not 
sort correctly, or traits once hidden suddenly surface in a 
new generation. In this part, I explain how cells sort their 
chromosomes when they make eggs and sperm and pre-
sent the basics of how traits are passed from parents to 
offspring.

▶ Producing gametes by meiosis

O
rganisms that reproduce sexually produce eggs and sperm that join 
together to make new individuals. To produce these sex cells, cells 
must undergo a special form of division, called meiosis, that cuts the genetic 
information of cells in half. In this chapter, I present the steps of meiosis. I 
also discuss its importance in generating genetic variability in species that 
practice sexual reproduction
Let’s Talk About Sex, Baby: Reproduction
When living things reproduce sexually, each parent contributes a cell to 
make a new organism. Sperm and egg join together, combining their genetic 
information. If sperm and eggs were like any other cells, this combination 
would create a problem because each new generation would have twice the 
genetic information as the generation before. So, sperm and eggs need to 
be made in a special way, a unique type of cell division that cuts the genetic 
information of the cell in half. That way, when sperm and egg combine, the 
new organism has the right amount of genetic information. The special divi-
sion that creates sperm and eggs is called meiosis.
 
Meiosis is a special type of cell division that occurs in gonads of sexually 
reproducing organisms.
Riding the life cycle
In sexually reproducing organisms, cells alternate between having the full 
amount of genetic material and having half the amount of genetic material. In 
humans, for example, body cells, called somatic cells, have twice the genetic 

212
Part IV: Genetics: From One Generation to the Next 
material of cells that participate in sexual reproduction, called gametes. Body 
cells produce gametes by meiosis, and then gametes combine by fertilization 
to create somatic cells, creating a life cycle (see Figure 14-1).

The life cycle for humans has several steps:
 
1. Somatic cells undergo meiosis to produce gametes.
 
 In humans, meiosis occurs in glands called gonads: testes in males and 
ovaries in females. Male gametes are called sperm, and female gametes 
are called eggs.
 
2. Sperm and eggs join together in fertilization, creating a first cell called 
a zygote.
 
 The nuclei of the sperm cell joins with the nucleus of the egg cell, 
combining the chromosomes into the nucleus of the zygote.
 
3. The zygote divides by mitosis to create a multicellular organism.
 
 Development occurs as cells specialize to create different tissues and 
organs. (For more on mitosis, see Chapter 13.)

213
 Chapter 14: Meiosis: Getting Ready for Baby
Counting chromosomes
Gametes have half the genetic material, or half the number of chromosomes, 
as somatic cells. One complete set of chromosomes is called the haploid 
number of chromosomes and is represented by the letter N. Gametes have 
one set of chromosomes, making them haploid (1N or N). Somatic cells usu-
ally have two sets of chromosomes, making them diploid (2N).
 
Human cells have 23 different kinds of chromosomes. Human gametes have 23 
chromosomes because they have one complete set. Human somatic cells have 
46 chromosomes because they have two complete sets (2 × 23=46). The 
number of chromosome sets a cell has is called its ploidy.
Many organisms besides humans reproduce sexually. Animals, plants, and 
many other eukaryotes have a life cycle that is similar to humans. Each 
organism has a unique set of chromosomes. For example, pea plants have 7 
different types of chromosomes. Thus, the haploid number of chromosomes 
in peas is 7 (N=7). Pea gametes are haploid (1N) and have 7 chromosomes, 
while pea somatic cells are diploid (2N) and have 14 chromosomes. In fruit 
flies, the haploid number of chromosomes is 4. Thus, fly gametes (1N) have 4 
chromosomes, while fly somatic cells (2N) have 8 chromosomes. The number 
of chromosomes in living things varies widely and can be as few as 6 chro-
mosomes in a diploid mosquito cell to thousands of chromosomes in some 
plants that are polyploid, which means they have many sets of chromosomes. 
One fern, Ophioglossum, has 1,200 chromosomes per cell!
Homologous Chromosomes
Cells can have matching pairs of chromosomes, called homologous chromo-
somes. For example, when sperm and egg join together to form a human zygote, 
each gamete contributes one set of 23 chromosomes. Each of the 23 chromo-
somes is unique and contains genes for certain traits. A zygote receives two 
of each kind of chromosome, one from each parent.
 
Homologous chromosomes are a pair of chromosomes that contain the same 
types of genes as each other. Diploid organisms, such as humans, get one of 
each pair of homologous chromosomes from mom and the other one from dad.
You can identify the differences among chromosomes by looking at chromo-
somes through a microscope. When cells are about to divide, the chromosomes 

214
Part IV: Genetics: From One Generation to the Next 
condense and become tight little bundles that are visible in a light microscope. 
Several physical differences help you identify the different types of 
chromosomes:
 
✓ Chromosome length: Chromosomes can be many different lengths, from 
very small to fairly long.
 
✓ Position of the centromere: Chromosomes are most visible when cells 
are just about to divide, so the chromosomes have been replicated. Two 
sister chromatids attached at the centromere are visible. Centromeres 
can occur in the middle of a chromosome or toward either end.
 
✓ Staining pattern: Some stains will stick to chromosomes differently, 
creating striped patterns of light and dark that are unique to each chro-
mosome. Also, antibody-linked fluorescent stains can mark each type of 
chromosome with a unique color.
Scientists identify chromosomes by the differences in the way they look. 
When scientists examine the chromosomes in a diploid cell, they see pairs 
of chromosomes that look alike. Each pair of chromosomes is a homologous 
pair. Scientists sort the chromosomes into pairs and lay them out in a 
chromosome map called a karyotype, shown in Figure 14-2.

By examining the karyotype of a cell, you can tell whether the cell has the 
right number of chromosomes. A normal human cell will have 23 pairs of chro-
mosomes. Twenty-two pairs are exactly the same in men and women and are 
called autosomal chromosomes. One pair, called the sex chromosomes, is differ-
ent between men and women. Men have a larger chromosome, called the X 
chromosome, and a smaller chromosome, called the Y chromosome. Women 
have two X chromosomes.
Going Separate Ways: Meiosis
Meiosis is a special type of cell division that carefully separates homologous 
pairs of chromosomes so that gametes receive one of each type of chromosome.
That way, when a man and a woman make a child, each parent donates 23 
chromosomes to the new baby, making the normal number of 46 chromosomes 
in the baby’s cells.
 
Each of the 23 chromosomes has slightly different types of information on it. So, 
the cells in the gonads that are making sperm and egg can’t just pile up all 46 
chromosomes and randomly divide them into two piles. If the process of split-
ting chromosomes was random, gametes could end up having extras of some 
chromosome types and missing others. A baby made from these gametes may 
get 46 chromosomes, but may not get the two of each kind needed to be a 
normal human. So, the ultimate goal of meiosis is to separate the homologous 
chromosomes carefully so that every gamete gets one complete set. In 
humans, that means a set that contains 1 of each of the 23 kinds.
Following the plan
Meiosis occurs as part of the cell cycle, just like mitosis. (For more on mitosis 
and the cell cycle, see Chapter 13.) In fact, meiosis has many similarities to 
mitosis:
 
✓ Cells that are going to undergo meiosis receive a signal that causes them 
to leave G1 of interphase and enter S phase.
 
✓ During S phase, the cells copy all the chromosomes, creating replicated 
chromosomes that have identical sister chromatids attached at the cen-
tromere.
 
✓ The cells then proceed through G2 and into meiosis.
 
✓ During meiosis, chromosomes are moved around by the spindle.
 
✓ The chromosomes are moved and sorted in very similar ways as they 
are in mitosis and the same terms, prophase — metaphase, anaphase, 
and telophase — describe these movements.

216
Part IV: Genetics: From One Generation to the Next 
An overview of meiosis
The goal of meiosis is to cut the amount of DNA in half to make haploid gam-
etes. However, before meiosis occurs, the DNA is doubled during S phase. 
Thus, in order to get the DNA down to the haploid amount, meiosis includes 
two divisions, shown in Figure 14-3B. The part of meiosis that leads up to 
the first division is called meiosis I. The part of meiosis that leads up to the 
second division is called meiosis II.
The details of meiosis may seem less overwhelming if you remember the pur-
pose of each division:
 
✓ The purpose of meiosis I is to separate pairs of homologous chromo-
somes.
 
✓ The purpose of meiosis II is to separate sister chromatids.

 Chapter 14: Meiosis: Getting Ready for Baby
 
The best way I know of to understand meiosis is to practice the phases using 
pipe cleaners or string for chromosomes. Create a cell with a diploid number 
of six or eight chromosomes and take them through the entire process beginning 
with G1, going through S phase, and proceeding on through both divisions of 
meiosis. Try doing this walkthrough for mitosis as well and compare the results 
side by side. By comparing the same cell going through mitosis and meiosis, 
you’ll soon recognize the phases based on the arrangement of chromosomes. 
Biology instructors have a nasty habit of showing you random pictures of 
cells undergoing cell division and asking you what phase you’re looking at!
The events of meiosis I
Meiosis I separates each pair of homologous chromosomes. The phases of mei-
osis I have many similarities to the phases of mitosis and are called prophase I, 
metaphase I, anaphase I, and telophase I. The events of meiosis I are as follows:
 
✓ During prophase I, several events occur:
 
• The nuclear membrane breaks down.
 
• The nucleoli disappear.
 
• Homologous chromosomes find each other and pair up. The two 
replicated chromosomes of each pair actually stick together, form-
ing a structure called a tetrad. Tetrads have four arms because 
each replicated chromosome has two sister chromatids.
 
• The chromosomes condense, or coil up, and become visible.
 
• The spindle attaches to the chromosomes.
 
✓ During metaphase I, homologous pairs of chromosomes are lined up in 
the middle of the cell.
 
✓ During anaphase I, homologous chromosomes are separated from each 
other, and one from each pair goes to opposite sides of the cell.
 
✓ During telophase I, nuclear membranes form in some organisms, creat-
ing two nuclei. These nuclei are now haploid because they only have 
one of each type of chromosome. The spindle breaks down.
 
✓ Cytokinesis (see Chapter 13) occurs, resulting in the formation of two 
cells.
After meiosis I is complete, both cells proceed directly to meiosis II without 
going through the stages of interphase (for more information on interphase, 
see Chapter 13).

218
Part IV: Genetics: From One Generation to the Next 
The events of meiosis II
Meiosis II separates the sister chromatids of each replicated chromosome 
and sends them to opposite sides of the cell. Once again, the cells pass 
through several phases similar to those of mitosis and meiosis I. During meio-
sis II, the phases are called prophase II, metaphase II, anaphase II, and telo-
phase II. The events of meiosis II are as follows:
 
✓ During prophase II, a spindle forms in each cell and attaches to the 
chromosomes. If nuclear membranes formed during telophase I, they 
break down again.
 
✓ During metaphase II, the chromosomes are lined up in the middle of 
the cell.
 
✓ During anaphase II, sister chromatids are separated and move to oppo-
site sides of the cell.
 
✓ During telophase II, several events occur:
 
• Chromosomes uncoil.
 
• The spindle breaks down.
 
• Nuclear membranes reform.
 
• Nucleoli reappear.
 
✓ Cytokinesis occurs in both cells, resulting in the formation of four cells 
from the original cell. These four cells develop into gametes. In females of 
some species, only one of the four cells will actually become an egg. The 
other three may break down or become a tissue that supports the egg.
Shuffling the Genetic Deck: 
Crossing Over
When homologous chromosomes are paired up during prophase I of meiosis, 
something interesting happens. Little bits of DNA are switched between the 
two homologous chromosomes in a process called crossing-over (refer to 
Figure 14-3A). Crossing-over actually exchanges pieces of the chromosomes 
that came from Mom with the ones that came from Dad, creating chromo-
somes that have bits of DNA from each parent.
 
The homologous chromosomes contain the same types of genes, so normal 
crossing-over doesn’t add or take away any genetic information; it just 
changes the source of that information on a particular chromosome. Because 
each cell undergoing meiosis can have different patterns of crossing-over, 
crossing-over helps increase the genetic diversity of gametes.

219
 Chapter 14: Meiosis: Getting Ready for Baby
Crossing-over involves several steps:
 
1. Homologous chromosomes are attached all along their length.
 
 Proteins called the synaptonemal complex act like glue to stick the 
homologous chromosomes together.
 
2. Proteins make small cuts in the DNA backbone of the homologous 
chromosomes.
 
3. Proteins reseal the breaks in the DNA backbone, attaching pieces of 
one homologous chromosome to the other.
 
As an analogy for crossing-over, imagine that you have one deck of cards that 
has blue backs and one deck of cards that has red backs. If you shuffle these 
decks together and then divide them into two complete decks again, ignoring 
the color of the backs, you’d end up with two complete decks containing 
cards with some red backs and some blue backs. Because the two decks of 
cards matched each other exactly card for card, your new decks are still com-
plete with the right number of kings, queens, and so on; the cards just came 
from different places.
Why Two Divisions Are Better Than One
Organisms that reproduce asexually by mitosis make offspring that are exact 
copies of themselves, whereas organisms that reproduce sexually make off-
spring that are different than themselves. In the long run, the genetic variabil-
ity that results from sexual reproduction makes it more likely that a species 
will survive. After all, if everyone is the same and life is good, then there is no 
problem.
But all that changes if disease strikes. If a disease sweeps through that is very 
good at killing the type of organisms that are present, and everyone is the 
same, everyone dies. On the other hand, if everyone is a little bit different 
and a disease sweeps through, some individuals might survive and be able to 
continue the species. Thus, the genetic variability generated by sexual repro-
duction provides an advantage to species.
Sexual reproduction increases genetic diversity in three ways:
 
✓ Crossing-over between homologous chromosomes in prophase I creates 
new patterns of genetic information in the chromosomes.
 
✓ Every cell that undergoes meiosis sorts its homologous chromosomes 
during anaphase I independently from all other cells in the gonads 
undergoing meiosis. Every gamete gets a complete set of chromosomes, 
but each gamete can have a slightly different assortment of which 
homologous chromosome it got from each pair.

220
Part IV: Genetics: From One Generation to the Next 
 
✓ Sexual reproduction requires that gametes from one parent combine 
with gametes from another parent to produce offspring. Fertilization is 
random and creates many new combinations of genes in offspring.
It Was All a Mistake: Nondisjunction
Meiosis must sort the chromosomes very carefully to ensure that each gamete 
gets a complete set of chromosomes. Checkpoints in metaphase ensure that all 
chromosomes are attached to the spindle and lined up correctly.
Despite these quality control measures, meiosis doesn’t always proceed cor-
rectly. Sometimes chromosomes that are supposed to separate and go to 
opposite sides of the cell fail to separate and travel together. Chromosomes 
that fail to separate correctly undergo nondisjunction. Nondisjunction leads 
to the creation of gametes that have the wrong number of chromosomes. 
(Refer to Figure 14-3C.)
 
Nondisjunction can occur in meiosis I. During anaphase I, the members of 
each pair of homologous chromosomes are supposed to separate and go to 
opposite sides of the cell. If this separation fails to happen, both members of a 
pair can travel to the same side of the cell. If meiosis II then proceeds nor-
mally, the result will be two gametes that have an extra copy of one of the 
chromosomes, and two gametes that are missing one of the chromosomes.
Living with Down Syndrome
Down Syndrome, or Trisomy 21, is the most 
common chromosomal defect among humans, 
occurring in 1 of every 733 births. People born 
with Down Syndrome experience a range of 
physiological and mental effects. The most seri-
ous effects are increased risk for heart disease, 
Alzheimer’s disease, and childhood leukemia. 
Other effects include greater risk for respira-
tory and thyroid conditions and mild to moder-
ate mental impairment. Medical treatment of 
the physical conditions associated with Down 
Syndrome has improved greatly in recent years, 
increasing the expected life span of people with 
Down Syndrome to almost normal levels.
The risk of having a child with Down Syndrome 
increases with the age of the mother, begin-
ning to rise quickly at about age 35. However, 
because younger women have more babies 
than older women, the total number of babies 
affected with Down Syndrome is actually 
greater for babies born to women under 35. 
Scientists are working to identify which genes 
cause Down Syndrome and hope to someday be 
able to block the effect of having extra copies of 
those genes so that people with Trisomy 21 will 
be physiologically and mentally normal.

221
 Chapter 14: Meiosis: Getting Ready for Baby
Nondisjunction can also occur in meiosis II. During prophase II of meiosis, 
sister chromatids are supposed to separate and go to opposite sides of the 
cell. If this separation fails to happen correctly, both sister chromatids can 
travel to the same side of the cell. Nondisjunction in meiosis II results in two 
normal gametes, one gamete that has an extra copy of one chromosome and 
one gamete that is missing a copy of one chromosome.
 
When a gamete with an abnormal number of chromosomes undergoes fertil-
ization, the result is an aneuploid individual that has the wrong number of 
chromosomes in all of their cells.
In humans, many types of aneuploidy don’t result in living offspring. However, 
some aneuploid individuals are born and live with some physiological abnor-
malities. One of the most common aneuploid conditions in humans is Trisomy 
21, where a person has three copies of chromosome 21. Trisomy 21 results 
from fertilization between a gamete that has an extra copy of chromosome 21 
and a normal gamete. A range of physiological and mental defects result from 
Trisomy 21. This syndrome of effects is commonly known as Down Syndrome.

▶ Linking inheritance with meiosis
G
enetics is the study of how parents pass traits onto their offspring. 
The modern understanding of inheritance began with the work of an 
Augustinian monk named Gregor Mendel who studied the inheritance of 
traits in peas. By carefully tracking the inheritance of traits in peas, Mendel 
established fundamental laws of inheritance that are still used today. In this 
chapter, I present Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance along with some tools that 
can help you analyze the inheritance of traits.
Pass the Peas, Please: Mendel and 
Segregation of Single Gene Traits
People have probably always had some kind of awareness that parents pass 
traits to their children. After all, family resemblances to grandparents, aunts, 
and uncles were common even in the ancient past. Farmers have known for 
a long time that traits are inherited in animals, and even crop plants, and 
planned their breeding programs to capture the traits they were interested in.
However, for most of history people didn’t really understand why traits were 
passed from parents to offspring, or why some traits seemed to appear more 
often than others. The first person who actually did a statistical analysis 
on the inheritance of traits was an Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel. 

224
Part IV: Genetics: From One Generation to the Next 
Mendel’s work laid the foundation for the current understanding of inheri-
tance as is represented as three main ideas called Mendel’s Laws:
 
✓ The Law of Dominance basically says that one form of a trait can hide 
another form of a trait. In other words, organisms have two genetic 
messages for every trait, but only one message may be visible in the 
organism. For example, if a brown-eyed person has children with a blue-
eyed person, their children may have brown eyes even though they 
inherited messages for blue eyes from one of their parents. The effect of 
the messages for brown eyes hides the fact that messages for blue eyes 
are even there. Mendel said that the form of the trait that is visible is 
dominant to the hidden form of the trait, which is recessive.
 
✓ The Law of Segregation basically says that when adults make gametes 
(eggs and sperm), they give only one of their two messages for each trait 
to each gamete. In other words, the two messages for each trait in adults 
separate from each other, or segregate, when gametes are made.
 
 Gametes get together with other gametes to make a new organism, so it 
makes sense for gametes to get only one copy of each genetic message. 
The other copy of each genetic message will come from the other gamete.
 
✓ The Law of Independent Assortment basically says that each pair of 
genetic messages sorts itself independently from other pairs of genetic 
messages. In other words, when pairs of genetic messages are getting 
split up and sent to gametes, each pair is doing this process on its own. 
When you think about the fact that humans have thousands of different 
genes that are sorting themselves randomly from each other every time 
a gamete is made, you can imagine that a single person could make lots 
of gametes with different combinations of genetic messages. You can 
see this variation in families with more than child — even though the 
children were made by the same parents, they don’t all look alike. The 
gametes that made each child were a little bit different from the gametes 
that made the child’s sisters and brothers.
Test anxiety
Gregor Mendel is famous as the father of genet-
ics. His careful mathematical analysis of his 
plant breeding experiments revealed patterns 
of inheritance that we still study today. It’s hard 
to believe that Mendel may never have done his 
groundbreaking work if he hadn’t flunked out 
of becoming a university professor! Perhaps 
because he lacked a formal university educa-
tion, Mendel didn’t pass his first university exam. 
He took more courses and was preparing to take 
the exam for a second time when he became ill. 
He withdrew his application and continued his 
plant breeding experiments instead!

225
 Chapter 15: Mendelian Genetics: Talkin’ ‘Bout the Generations
Living like a monk
Gregor Mendel was an Augustinian monk with interests in science, nature, 
and math. He became very interested in the heredity of traits and spent seven 
years carefully observing, counting, and analyzing the results of breeding 
experiments in pea plants. Pea plants have many different traits that can be 
studied, including flower color, pea shape, pea color, pod shape, and plant 
height. Also, pea flowers contain both male and female parts, and they can 
make offspring when they’re mated to themselves; in other words, they’re self-
fertile. Thus, Mendel was able to outcross pea plants by mating pea plants to 
other pea plants and also self-cross pea plants by mating them to themselves. 
Although studies on inheritance were done before Mendel’s work, his work 
was especially important for several reasons:
 
✓ Mendel developed lines of pure-breeding plants. He mated plants with a 
trait he wanted to study with themselves until he had plants that always 
gave the same version of the trait. For example, he self-crossed purple-
flowered pea plants and removed any white offspring that were produced. 
Then he took the purple-flowered offspring and self-crossed them again. 
He kept self-crossing the purple-flowered offspring until he always got 
purple-flowered pea plants from a self-cross of a purple plant. Then, 
Mendel did the same thing with white-flowered plants — self-crossed 
them until he had pure-breeding white-flowered plants. By creating pure-
breeding plants, Mendel knew he was starting any experiment with a plant 
that had only one variation in the genetic message he was interested in.
 
✓ Mendel kept detailed numerical records and analyzed his experimental 
crosses using statistics. By applying math to analyze his crosses, Mendel 
was able to discover patterns of inheritance that led to his understanding 
of how inheritance works.
Mendel worked on inheritance in the 1850s, long before anyone knew any-
thing about meiosis (see Chapter 14) or DNA (see Chapter 7). It’s really 
amazing he figured out that traits separate during gamete formation without 
knowing anything about the physical basis for inheritance! In fact, he was so 
far ahead of his time that when he presented his results, people just didn’t 
get it. His work was ignored by the scientific community until it was rediscov-
ered almost 50 years later and people were ready to understand.
Speaking the lingo
Mendel’s work on inheritance occurred before scientists knew about DNA 
or meiosis and around the same time that chromosomes were first being 
discovered. When Mendel described his conclusions, he talked about factors 
that control the inheritance of traits. Although his ideas are still used today, 

226
Part IV: Genetics: From One Generation to the Next 
they’re usually presented with the modern language and terms that have 
developed since his work. In order to understand the science of heredity, 
called genetics, you need to understand the language:
 
✓ A message for a particular trait is called a gene. The different variations 
of the message are called alleles. For example, pea plants have a gene 
for flower color. One allele is for purple flowers, while another is for 
white flowers.
 
✓ The total of all the genetic messages an organism has is called its geno-
type. The way the organism appears and functions because of its genes 
is called its phenotype. The genotype is like the total blueprint for the 
organism; the phenotype is what is built from that genotype.
 
✓ When an organism has two identical alleles for a gene, the organism 
is homozygous for that gene. When the alleles for a gene are differ-
ent, the organism is heterozygous for that gene. Homo means same, so 
homozygous is having the same two messages. Hetero means different, 
so heterozygous is having two different messages. Another word that is 
commonly used to describe organisms with two different alleles is the 
term hybrid.
Round pea meets wrinkled pea
It’s easiest to understand heredity when you follow just one trait at a time. 
For example, Mendel did a cross between a pure-breeding plant that pro-
duced round peas and a pure-breeding plant that produced wrinkled peas. 
The offspring of this mating all produced round peas. However, when the 
round pea offspring were mated among themselves, both round and wrinkled 
pea plants were produced. Because the wrinkled trait appeared again in the 
offspring of the first generation, Mendel knew that the wrinkled pea trait 
must be hidden by the first generation plants even though he couldn’t see it.
Mendel’s experiment makes sense if you think about it in the following way:
 
✓ The parental plants are pure-breeding, so they have only one kind of 
allele for the trait. Round pea plants can give messages only for round 
peas to their offspring, and wrinkled pea plants can give messages for 
only wrinkled peas to their offspring.
 
✓ Each pea plant has two alleles for each trait. Plants can have two 
copies of the round-shaped allele, two copies of the wrinkled-shape 
allele, or one copy each of round and wrinkled.
 
✓ Each pea plant gives only one allele to its offspring. When pea plants 
make gametes, they separate the two alleles for each trait and give one 
allele for each trait to each gamete.

227
 Chapter 15: Mendelian Genetics: Talkin’ ‘Bout the Generations
 
✓ The first generation plants get an allele for round peas from one 
parent and an allele for wrinkled peas from the other parent. Thus, 
the first generation plants have two different messages for pea shape. 
Because their two alleles for this trait are different, they’re heterozygous 
for this trait.
 
✓ The allele for round peas is dominant to the allele for wrinkled peas. 
Although the first generation plants had two different messages, you see 
only the effect of the round pea message. Thus, the round pea message 
is hiding the wrinkled pea message.
 
✓ When the first generation plants reproduce, they can give either their 
allele for round peas or their allele for wrinkled peas to their off-
spring. Thus, some plants in the second generation had wrinkled peas 
even though all the first generation plants had round peas.
When you’re analyzing the results of a genetic cross, the different generations 
can get a little confusing. To keep track of the generations in a cross like this, 
geneticists use a specific notation:
 
✓ The parental generation is identified as P1. P1 plants are always pure-
breeding for the trait that is being studied.
 
✓ The first generation that results from a cross between two parentals (P1) 
is called the F1 generation. F stands for filial, which refers to children, 
so the F1 generation is the first filial generation or the first generation of 
offspring from the parental cross.
 
✓ The second generation that results from a cross between two members 
of the F1 generation is called the F2 generation. F2 stands for second 
filial generation.
The odds are 3:1
When Mendel did his plant breeding experiments and analyzed the results, 
he looked at the numbers of different types of offspring very carefully. The 
patterns he saw in the numbers led him to his conclusions about inheritance. 
For example, when he crossed parental round pea plants with parental wrin-
kled pea plants, all the F1 generation had round peas. When he self-crossed 
the F1, he got 5,474 round pea plants and 1,850 wrinkled pea plants in the 
F2 generation. In other words, there was a ratio of 5,474 round pea plants 
to 1,850 wrinkled pea plants. If you divide both numbers by 1,850, you get a 
reduced ration of 2.96:1. In other words, for every wrinkled pea plant in the 
F2, there were about 3 round pea plants.

228
Part IV: Genetics: From One Generation to the Next 
 
To reduce a ratio, divide both sides by the smaller number. For example, a 
ratio of 75:25 reduces to a ratio of 3:1.
The 3:1 ratio of round to wrinkled pea plants is exactly what you’d expect 
if Mendel’s laws of inheritance are correct. To understand why this ratio 
occurs, you can use a grid called a Punnett square, shown in Figure 15-1, to 
track the alleles through this cross:
 
✓ On the edges of a Punnett square, you write symbols for the alleles in 
the gametes that are combining in the cross.
 
✓ By filling in the square, you create all the possible combinations of 
gametes that may occur in the next generation.
 
✓ In plant genetics, letters are used to represent the different alleles. 
Usually, the letter used is the first letter of the trait. The same letter is 
used for both alleles of the trait. For example, in Figure 15-1, the letter 
R is used to represent pea shape because one possible shape is round, 
which starts with the letter R.
 
✓ Capital letters are used to represent dominant alleles; lowercase letters 
represent recessive alleles. For example in Figure 15-1, R is used for 
round and r is used for wrinkled.

Making a prediction
Punnett squares make predicting the outcome of a particular genetic experi-
ment easier. For example, the two Punnett squares in Figure 15-1 predict 
the outcome of Mendel’s experiment that crosses pure-breeding round pea 
plants with pure-breeding wrinkled pea plants and then self-crosses the F1 
generation. The Punnett square on the left predicts the cross between the 
parental generation:
 
✓ The round pea parental is pure-breeding for the round phenotype, so it 
can produce only gametes that contain the allele for round peas. These 
gametes are represented by the capital R’s that are written down the left 
side of the Punnett square.

229
 Chapter 15: Mendelian Genetics: Talkin’ ‘Bout the Generations
 
✓ The wrinkled pea parental is pure-breeding for the wrinkled phenotype, 
so it can produce only gametes that contain the allele for wrinkled peas. 
These gametes are represented by the lowercase r’s that are written 
across the top of the Punnett square.
 
✓ In this case, you have only one possible combination of the two types of 
gametes — all the F1 offspring have the genotype Rr. This generation is 
shown in the smaller squares inside of the Punnett square.
The allele for round peas is dominant to the allele for wrinkled peas, so this 
Punnett square leads to the prediction that all F1 plants will be heterozygous 
and will all have the round pea phenotype. Mendel’s actual experiment with 
round and wrinkled pea plants exactly matches this prediction — all his F1 
plants produced round peas!
A Punnett square also makes predicting the outcome of the self-cross of the F1 
generation easier. Because the F1 generation are all heterozygous, or hybrid, 
for one trait, this type of cross is called a monohybrid cross. Each member of 
the F1 generation is heterozygous, so they can make two different types of 
gametes — gametes that contain the dominant allele and gametes that contain 
the recessive allele. When one F1 plant is crossed with another F1 plant, the meet-
ing of their gametes is random. The Punnett square on the right in Figure 15-1 
models random mating by creating all possible combinations of gametes:
 
✓ The possible gametes produced by two individuals from the F1 generation 
are shown along the side and top of the Punnett square.
 
✓ The predicted F2 generation is shown in the small squares inside the 
Punnett square.
 
✓ Some F2 offspring are expected to be homozygous for the dominant 
allele (RR), some are expected to be heterozygous (Rr), and some are 
expected to be homozygous for the recessive allele (rr). The predicted 
genotypic ratio in the F2 generation is 1:2:1 for RR:Rr:rr.
 
✓ Because the round pea allele is dominant to the wrinkled pea allele, any 
individual in the F2 who is homozygous dominant (RR) or heterozygous 
(Rr) will have the same phenotype and make round peas. When pheno-
types are compared, the predicted phenotypic ratio in the F2 generation 
is 3:1 for round peas:wrinkled peas.
 
The Punnett square for the monohybrid cross between individuals in the F1 
generation predicts a 3:1 ratio of round pea plants to wrinkled pea plants. In 
other words, for every one plant with wrinkled peas, you predict that there 
will be three plants with round peas. This estimate is extremely close to the 
2.96:1 ratio of round to wrinkled peas that Mendel saw in his experiments, con-
firming Mendel’s laws, which the Punnett square models.

230
Part IV: Genetics: From One Generation to the Next 
Testing an idea
Mendel’s work with peas led to his ideas about inheritance, known as Mendel’s 
laws because they’ve been supported by many experiments over time. 
Mendel himself, of course, didn’t know that his ideas were correct, and he 
wanted to test them for himself. He tested them by taking a closer look at 
the F2 generation from his monohybrid crosses. He predicted that the F2 had 
two types of round pea plants — some that were homozygous for the 
dominant allele (RR) and twice as many that were heterozygous (Rr). This 
prediction is modeled in the Punnett square to the right in Figure 15-1.
Mendel tested his prediction about the round F2 pea plants by crossing them 
with parental pea plants that had the recessive trait. The parental pea plants 
were pure-breeding, homozygous recessive (rr).
 
A cross between an unknown individual and a pure-breeding recessive is 
called a test-cross.
Test-crosses allow you to identify the genotype of the unknown individual 
because the recessive parental can donate only recessive alleles to the test-
cross offspring. Mendel made the following predictions about the outcome of 
his test-crosses:
 
✓ Some of the test-crosses would yield offspring that were all round. 
This result would represent the crosses between homozygous dominant 
plants (RR) with the test-cross parent (rr). Because the homozygous F2 
plant could donate only dominant alleles to the next generation, all off-
spring would show the dominant trait.
 
✓ Twice as many of the test-crosses would yield offspring that were 
50:50 round to wrinkled. This result would represent the crosses 
between the heterozygous F2 plants (Rr) and the test-cross parent (rr). 
Because the heterozygous plants could make equal amounts of two types 
of gametes (half with the dominant allele and half with the recessive allele), 
half the offspring of the test-cross would be heterozygous (Rr) and half 
would be homozygous recessive (Rr).
Well, you can probably guess that since Mendel is considered the father of 
genetics and his ideas are now called laws, his predictions proved correct. 
The ratios of types of offspring that he got in his test-cross experiments were 
very close to his predictions, again supporting his ideas.
Remembering meiosis
Mendel’s ideas about inheritance were supported by his own work and by 
the work of many scientists since Mendel’s time. Scientists today, of course, 
know a lot more about the details of how inheritance works. Since Mendel’s 

231
 Chapter 15: Mendelian Genetics: Talkin’ ‘Bout the Generations
time, they’ve discovered that the factors of inheritance that Mendel pro-
posed are genes located on chromosomes made of DNA. Mendel proposed 
that parents have two copies of each factor (gene) and that these factors 
segregate from each other when parents make offspring. Scientists now 
know exactly when that segregation occurs — during anaphase I of meiosis 
(Chapter 14). During anaphase I, homologous chromosomes separate from 
each other and go to opposite sides of the cell, becoming destined to end up 
in different gametes. Those homologous chromosomes each carry the same 
set of genes. 
 
The two alleles for each gene carried by the parent segregate from each other 
when the two homologous chromosomes separate from each other during 
anaphase I.
Only one copy of each gene ends up in the gametes that result from meiosis. 
If Mendel were alive today, I bet he’d be really excited to see how his factors 
segregate!
Playing by the rules
Gametes combine randomly during sexual reproduction. In other words, 
certain sperm don’t seek out certain eggs — it’s just a sort of reproductive 
free-for-all to see who gets lucky. Because fertilization is random, inheritance 
follows the rules of probability.
 
You can use the rules of probability to predict the outcome of a cross in the 
same way that you use a Punnett square to make predictions. Here are the 
rules of probability that apply to problems of inheritance:
 
✓ The rule of multiplication says that if two events are independent 
of each other, then the probability that they will both occur at the 
same time is the product of their individual probabilities. You can use 
the rule of multiplication to predict the outcome of a cross, such as a 
monohybrid cross (Rr × Rr). For example, you can answer the question 
“What is the chance that a homozygous recessive offspring (rr) will be 
produced from a monohybrid cross?” by completing the following steps:
 
1. Determine the probability of each gamete type that the parents 
can produce. The parents are heterozygous (Rr), so half their 
gametes will receive the recessive allele and half the gametes 
will receive the dominant allele. The probability that each parent 
would donate each type of allele is one-half (½).
 
2. Figure out how many ways this cross could produce the offspring 
in the question. In order for a homozygous recessive offspring to 
be produced, each parent would have to donate a recessive allele. 
So, these parents could produce a homozygous recessive offspring 
in only one way.

232
Part IV: Genetics: From One Generation to the Next 
 
3. Multiply the independent probabilities together. The probability 
that one parent would donate the recessive allele is independent 
of the probability that the other parent would donate the recessive 
allele. (After all, they’re both making gametes independently in 
their own bodies.) So, the total probability of creating a homozy-
gous recessive offspring (rr) in this cross is the probability that 
one parent would donate the recessive allele (½) times the prob-
ability that the other parent would donate the recessive allele (½), 
which equals ¼. The rules of probability predict that one out of 
four offspring from this cross would be homozygous recessive. If 
you compare this result to the Punnett square on the right side of 
Figure 15-1, you can see that the two methods make the same 
prediction!
 
✓ The rule of addition says that if an event can occur in more than one 
way, then the probability that it will occur is the sum of the indepen-
dent probabilities for each way that it can occur. Again, you can use 
the rule of addition to predict the outcome of a cross, such as a monohy-
brid cross (Rr × Rr). For example, you can answer the question “What 
is the chance that a heterozygous will be produced from a monohybrid 
cross?” by following these steps:
 
1. Determine the probability of each gamete type the parents can 
produce. As in the preceding example, the probability that each 
parent will donate each type of allele is one-half (½).
 
2. Figure out how many ways this cross could produce the offspring 
in the question. In this case, the parents can produce a heterozygous 
offspring (Rr) in two different ways: If Mom gives a dominant allele 
and Dad gives a recessive allele, or if Mom gives a recessive allele and 
Dad gives a dominant allele.
 
3. Calculate the probabilities for the different ways the parents can 
produce this offspring. The probability that Mom gives a dominant 
allele is one-half (½) and that dad gives a recessive allele is one-half 
(½). These events are independent, so you multiply: ½ × ½ = ¼. The 
probability the heterozygote is produced by Mom giving the recessive 
allele and dad giving the dominant allele is the same: ½ × ½ = ¼.
 
4. Add the independent probabilities to calculate the total prob-
ability of the event: ¼ + ¼ = 2/4 = ½. So, the rules of probability 
predict that half the offspring from a monohybrid cross will be 
heterozygous. Again, if you compare this result with the Punnett 
square on the right in Figure 15-1, you can see that both methods 
give the same prediction.
 
✓ The rule of numbers says that, for random events, the larger the sample 
size, the more likely that actual events will correspond to predictions. 
You can easily see an example of this rule in real life. You can predict 
that whenever you flip a coin, you have a 50:50 chance that it will come 
up heads. However, if you flip a coin just two times, you may get heads 
both times. That’s 100 percent heads — not at all close to your prediction. 

233
 Chapter 15: Mendelian Genetics: Talkin’ ‘Bout the Generations
However, if you flip the coin ten times, you might get six heads and four 
tails. This 60:40 split is much closer to your prediction. Flip the coin 100 
times or 1,000 times and you may get very close to 50:50. The same rule 
applies in genetics. You have a 50:50 chance that a human baby will be a 
boy or a girl, but you probably know families that have two or even three 
boys and no girls. To get samples that come close to their predictions, 
geneticists need organisms that produce lots of offspring, or they need 
to look at the same cross many times in order to increase their numbers.
Tracing a trait: Pedigrees
Humans don’t make especially good subjects for genetic studies because they 
don’t produce very many offspring (compared to, say, a fruit fly) and they don’t 
generally mate on command. However, humans are very interested in their 
own traits, especially genetic diseases. So, geneticists study human traits by 
examining the pedigrees of families that display a certain trait.
For example, hemophilia is a disease that affected the descendants of Queen 
Victoria of England, and geneticists have used that pedigree (and many others) 
to study the inheritance of hemophilia. Geneticists use certain symbols when 
drawing human pedigrees (see Figure 15-2A):
 
✓ Males are shown as squares, females as circles.
 
✓ A mating is shown by a line drawn between a female and a male.
 
✓ The children of a mating are drawn below the parents in birth order, with 
a line connecting the children to the line of the mating that produced them.
 
✓ The symbol for a person who has the trait that is being studied is 
shaded. For example, if you look at a pedigree for hemophilia in the 
royal families of Europe, anyone who has hemophilia will be shaded.
Geneticists study the pattern of inheritance in pedigrees in order to figure 
out how a particular trait is inherited. Certain key patterns are important to 
look for when trying to interpret a pedigree:
 
✓ Traits that are passed by recessive alleles can skip generations. For 
example, look at the pedigree in Figure 15-2 C. The first few generations 
don’t show the trait, but the last generation does. Children get their 
genes from their parents, so the parents in generation V must have the 
alleles for the trait, but they don’t show it. Thus, the alleles for the trait 
are being hidden in this generation, indicating that the alleles for the 
trait are recessive to other alleles.
 
✓ Traits that are passed by dominant alleles show up in every generation. 
For example, look at the pedigree in Figure 15-2B. Other alleles can’t 
hide a trait that is carried by a dominant allele. Thus, if a child has the 
trait, at least one of the parents of the child must show the trait as well.

 Chapter 15: Mendelian Genetics: Talkin’ ‘Bout the Generations
Geneticists look at the pedigrees of many families in order to try to determine 
the inheritance of a particular trait. The information in one pedigree may not 
be enough to absolutely determine the inheritance pattern, but another one 
may hold the key. To try to determine which types of inheritance are pos-
sible based on a pedigree, you can propose a particular type of inheritance 
and then try to assign everyone in the family a genotype. For example, if you 
didn’t know what type of inheritance was represented by the pedigree in 
Figure 15-2C, you could try to figure it out:
 
1. Decide which type of inheritance you want to test.
 
 For example, you could propose that you want to test whether the pedi-
gree would fit if the trait was recessive.
 
2. Assign genotypes for the people that are certain.
 
 For example, if the trait is recessive, then anyone who has the trait must 
be homozygous recessive for the trait (for example, aa). In the pedigree 
in Figure 15-2C, the first child in generation VI with the shaded circle 
would have to have the homozygous recessive genotype (aa).
 
3. Working from the people whose genotypes you know, try to assign 
genotypes to the rest of the family.
 
 For example, the parents of the affected child in Figure 15-2C must both 
be heterozygous (Aa). They didn’t have the trait, but they must have 
had the allele to pass it on to their children that do have the trait.
 
4. Continue working on the pedigree, trying to assign genotypes.
 
 Sometimes, you can’t be sure whether a person’s genotype is homozy-
gous dominant or heterozygous (AA or Aa). In this case, you can record 
their genotype as A– to indicate the uncertainty of the second allele. If 
you ever find a spot where your proposed type of inheritance can’t pos-
sibly work in this family — for example, homozygous dominant offspring 
(AA) from homozygous recessive parents (aa) — then you know that 
type of inheritance is impossible, and you can cross it off your list. Some 
families won’t have enough information for you to figure out the inheri-
tance. In that case, you’ll have to leave more than one possibility open 
unless you have other pedigrees with more information.
 
If a trait skips a generation, it must be carried on a recessive allele. However, if a 
trait shows up in every generation, it may not be carried on a dominant allele. 
(It may be a recessive trait, but everyone in the family has it.)

236
Part IV: Genetics: From One Generation to the Next 
I Can Go My Own Way: Independent 
Assortment
Mendel’s formed his Law of Independent Assortment based on his observa-
tions of the inheritance of two traits at the same time. He saw that each trait 
followed the law of segregation independently of the other, which led him to 
conclude that the inheritance of one gene doesn’t affect the inheritance of 
the other.
You can understand the inheritance of two traits at the same time by using 
the same tools you use to track a single gene, such as Punnett squares and 
the rules of probability; it just gets a little more complicated to follow. (For 
more on Punnett squares, see the section “Making a prediction,” earlier in 
this chapter. For more on the rules of probability, see the section “Playing by 
the rules.”)
Round yellow pea meets 
wrinkled green pea
To follow the inheritance of two traits, Mendel selected pure-breeding plants 
that always produced round yellow peas and pure-breeding plants that 
always produced wrinkled green peas. He crossed these parentals and then 
self-crossed the F1 generation. Here’s what Mendel discovered:
 
✓ The cross between the pure-breeding round yellow peas and pure-
breeding wrinkled green peas produced all round yellow peas in the F1 
generation.
 
a. The parental plants have two copies of each gene but only give 
one to their gametes. The pure-breeding parentals were homozy-
gous for both traits, so they each could contribute only one type 
of message for pea color and one type of message for pea shape to 
the offspring. The round yellow parents gave messages for round 
yellow peas, and the wrinkled green parents gave messages for 
wrinkled green peas.
 
b. The round allele is dominant to the wrinkled allele and the yellow 
allele is dominant to the green allele. Because the F1 were all 
round and yellow, the allele for round peas must be dominant to 
the allele for wrinkled peas, and the allele for yellow peas must be 
dominant to the allele for green peas.
 
c. The plants of the F1 generation are heterozygous for both traits. 
You can write the genotype for the round yellow parents as RRYY 
and the genotype for the wrinkled green parents as rryy. When the 

237
 Chapter 15: Mendelian Genetics: Talkin’ ‘Bout the Generations
parent plants make gametes, they send one copy of the gene for pea 
shape and one copy of the gene for pea color. Round yellow 
parents make gametes with the genotype RY, while wrinkled 
green parents make gametes with the genotype ry. When these 
gametes get together to make the F1, the resulting genotype of the F1 
plants is RrYy.
 
✓ The self-cross of the F1 generation produced all possible combinations 
of the two traits in a ratio of 9:3:3:1 of round yellow peas:round green 
peas:wrinkled yellow peas:wrinkled green peas.
 
a. The genes for pea color and pea shape don’t have to stay together 
when gametes are made. The round yellow parental plant (RRYY) 
made gametes that contained the dominant alleles (RY). The 
wrinkled green parental plant (rryy) made gametes that contained 
the recessive alleles (ry). If the genes for pea color and seed shape 
were tied together somehow, they would stay tied together in 
the F1. When the F1 plants made gametes, they also could make 
only gametes that were either RY or ry. Thus, the F2 generation 
would have only round yellow and wrinkled green plants. (You 
can draw a Punnett square like those in Figure 15-1 to show how 
these two types of gametes would combine to produce this type 
of F2. Remember to put both types of gametes on each side of the 
Punnett square.)
 
b. Because all possible combinations of traits were seen in the F2, the 
gene for pea color must be segregating independently of the gene 
for pea shape. The F2 generation had all possible combinations of 
the two traits. Thus, the F1 generation must be able to make gam-
etes with all possible combinations of alleles: RY, rY, Ry, and ry. 
When the gametes of the F1 plants combine, all possible combina-
tions of traits are seen in the F2 offspring. The details of the self-
cross of the F1 are best seen using a Punnett square.
 
When you’re working with crosses that involve two traits at the same time, an 
easy way to make sure that you include all possible types of gametes that an 
individual could make is to remember the word FOIL, which stands for First, 
Outer, Inner, and Last. Look at the genotype of the individual that is making 
gametes and use FOIL to figure out what types of gametes they would make. 
For example, if the individual has the genotype AaBb, you take the First letter 
of each pair of alleles (AB), then the Outer letter of each pair Ab, then the 
Inner letter of each pair (aB), and then the Last letter of each pair (ab). The 
four types of gametes an individual with genotype AaBb can make are AB, Ab, 
aB, and ab. FOIL works on any individual with two gene pairs, even if they 
have a different combination of alleles. For example, an individual with the 
genotype AaBB would make gametes with the combinations AB, AB, aB, and 
aB. In this case, only two types of gametes are produced, but the FOIL method 
makes sure that you don’t miss anything.

238
Part IV: Genetics: From One Generation to the Next 
Puzzling over the Punnett
When Mendel crossed round yellow parentals (RRYY) with wrinkled green 
parentals (rryy), the resulting F1 generation was heterozygous for both traits 
(RrYy). Individuals that are heterozygous for two traits are called dihybrids. 
Individuals from the F1 generation were mated with each other in a dihybrid 
cross. The best way to track what is happening in a dihybrid cross is to use a 
Punnett square (see Figure 15-3):
 
1. Figure out the types of gametes that will be produced by the individu-
als that are being mated.
 
 The round yellow dihybrids of the F1 generation have the genotype RrYy. 
These individuals can make four types of gametes: RY, Ry, rY, and ry.
 
2. Make a Punnett square that has enough rows and columns for the 
types of gametes produced by the individuals that are being mated.
 
 In this case, both dihybrids that are being mated will produce four types 
of gametes, so the Punnett square must have four rows and four columns.
 
3. Write the gamete types made by each parent along the top and sides 
of the Punnett square.
 
 In this case, write RY, Ry, rY, and ry along the top and also along the 
sides of the square.
 
4. Figure out all possible offspring by combining the gametes in each 
box of the Punnett square.
 
 Each box in the Punnett square is an intersection point between two 
gamete types. In the box, write the four alleles that the F2 offspring 
would have if the two gametes joined together. For example, the upper-
left corner of the Punnett square in Figure 15-3 is the intersection point 
between gametes RY and RY. When these gametes combine, they pro-
duce an offspring with genotype RRYY.
 
5. Write down all the different genotypes that are produced and count 
up how many there are of each kind.
 
 A dihybrid cross produces nine different genotypes: RRYY, RRYy, RRyy, 
RrYY, RrYy, rrYY, Rryy, rrYy, rryy. The ratios of genotypes are one 
RRYY, two RRYy, one RRyy, two RrYY, four RrYy, one rrYY, two Rryy, 
two rrYy and one rryy. Thus, the genotypic ratio for a dihybrid cross is 
1:2:1:2:4:1:2:2:1.
 
6. Figure out the phenotype of each offspring in the box by remembering 
which alleles are dominant and which are recessive.
 
 In this case, round is dominant to wrinkled, and yellow is dominant 
to green. You can go through your Punnett square and color code the 
squares or write in the phenotypes.

239
 Chapter 15: Mendelian Genetics: Talkin’ ‘Bout the Generations
 
7. Write down all the different phenotypes that are produced and count 
how many there are of each kind.
 
 In the dihybrid cross of the round yellow F1, four phenotypes are pro-
duced: round yellow, round green, wrinkled yellow, and wrinkled green. 
The ratios of phenotypes are nine round yellow offspring, three round 
green offspring, three wrinkled yellow offspring, and one wrinkled green 
offspring. Thus, the phenotypic ratio for the dihybrid cross is 9:3:3:1.
 
A phenotypic ratio of 9:3:3:1 tells you that two genes are assorting indepen-
dently, just like a 3:1 phenotypic ratio tells you that a single gene is segregating.

Remembering meiosis
Genes separate from each other during anaphase I of meiosis when the 
homologous chromosomes move away from each other toward opposite 
sides of the cell. (See Chapter 14 for more on meiosis.) The separation of one 
pair of homologous chromosomes has no effect on the separation of other 
pairs of homologous chromosomes. So, if two genes are located on different 
chromosomes, their movement during meiosis is independent of each other. 
For example, imagine two pairs of homologous chromosomes inside a dihy-
brid pea plant:
 
✓ The genes for pea shape and pea color are carried on different chro-
mosomes. One pair of homologous chromosomes has the gene for pea 
shape. In the pair, one chromosome carries the dominant allele (R), while 
the other carries the recessive allele (r). The other pair of homologous 

240
Part IV: Genetics: From One Generation to the Next 
chromosomes has the gene for pea color. In this pair, one chromosome 
carries the dominant allele (Y), and the other carries the recessive 
allele (y).
 
✓ In anaphase I, the two alleles for each gene separate as the homolo-
gous chromosomes go to opposite sides of the cell. When the pairs of 
homologous chromosomes separate in anaphase I (see Chapter 14), one 
of each pair will go to opposite sides of the cell and end up in a differ-
ent gamete. The chromosomes with the dominant shape allele (R) could 
go to the same side of the cell as the dominant color allele (Y), making 
a gamete with the genotype RY. The chromosome with the recessive 
shape allele (r) could go to the same side as the recessive color allele 
(y), making a gamete with the genotype ry. If meiosis happens this way 
in one cell of the dihybrid plant, the gametes produced will have the 
genotypes RY and ry.
 
✓ Each pair of homologous chromosomes separates independently of 
the other homologous chromosomes, so segregation of alleles in dif-
ferent genes can vary from meiosis in one cell to another. Another cell 
in the same dihybrid that is making gametes could separate the alleles 
differently. The chromosome with the dominant shape allele (R) could 
go to the same side of the cell as the chromosome with the recessive color 
allele (y), making a gamete that has the genotype Ry. The chromosome 
with the recessive shape allele (r) could go to the side of the cell with 
the dominant color allele (Y), making a gamete with the genotype rY. If 
meiosis happens this way in one cell of the dihybrid plant, the gametes 
produced will have the genotypes Ry and rY.
 
✓ When you’re predicting the outcome of a cross, you need to consider 
all the possible gamete types an individual can make. When you con-
sider all the possible ways that these gene pairs could separate during 
meiosis in different cells in the dihybrid plant, you come up with four 
possibilities for all the gametes produced by the dihybrid plant: RY, Ry, 
rY, and ry. These four gamete types are possible because the pairs of 
homologous chromosomes assort independently from each other during 
anaphase I.
 
Independent assortment of gene pairs occurs when homologous chromo-
somes segregate independently from each other during anaphase I of meiosis.

any traits don’t behave exactly in the ways that Mendel described 
from his experiments with pea plants. (For more on the basics of 
genetics, see Chapter 15.) Unexpected patterns of inheritance led geneticists 
to probe deeper into the mysteries of genes and revealed many factors that 
contribute to inheritance. In this chapter, I present the most common varia-
tions on strict Mendelian inheritance.
It’s News to Mendel: Inheritance 
Beyond Simple Dominance
Sometimes, the inheritance of a trait behaves differently from what you 
would expect based on Mendel’s laws (see Chapter 15). Does that mean 
Mendel got it wrong? Not really. The laws that Mendel developed based on 
his observations are still believed to be correct. It’s just that Mendel didn’t 
see everything there was to see in his experiments. Inheritance involves a bit 
more than just single gene traits with a simple relationship to each other of 
dominant and recessive.
Since Mendel’s time, scientists have discovered several types of inheritance 
that are complicated by other factors:
 
✓ In incomplete dominance, the effects of two different alleles combine to 
create a phenotype that is somewhere in between the dominant pheno-
type and the recessive phenotype.

242
Part IV: Genetics: From One Generation to the Next 
 
✓ In codominance, the effects of two different alleles both contribute 
equally to the phenotype.
 
✓ Pleiotropy occurs when one gene has an effect on many different pheno-
typic characteristics.
 
✓ In polygenic traits, many different genes affect the phenotype.
 
✓ Linked genes are very close together on a chromosome and break the 
law of independent assortment.
 
✓ Sex-linked traits are located on the sex chromosomes, X or Y.
Mixing it up: Incomplete dominance
In incomplete dominance, the dominant allele only partially masks the pres-
ence of the recessive allele. A good example of incomplete dominance is seen 
in the color of some flowers, such as snapdragons:
 
✓ The red allele (R) is incompletely dominant to the white allele (W).
 
✓ Homozygous plants (RR or WW) have either red flowers or white flowers 
(see Figure 16-1).
 
✓ When the two alleles are present together in a heterozygote (RW), the 
result is a plant with pink flowers.
If the red allele was completely dominant to the white allele, heterozygous 
plants would have red flowers. But in the case of incomplete dominance, you 
can see the presence of the white allele because of the lighter color of the 
flowers. For the case of flower color, you can think of incomplete dominance 
like mixing paints — red paint mixed with white paint makes pink paint. 
Incomplete dominance shows the same kind of blending in the phenotype of 
the heterozygote.
Sharing the power: Codominance
Codominance is very similar to incomplete dominance (see preceding sec-
tion) because heterozygotes can also show the effect of two different alleles. 
However, when two alleles are codominant to each other, they both show up 
distinctly in the heterozygote — the alleles don’t blend their effects like they 
do in incomplete dominance. For example, if there were a case of codominant 
alleles for flower color, with one allele for red color and the other for white 
color, a heterozygote would have flowers that were red and white.
The ABO markers for human blood type are an excellent example of codomi-
nance. Three alleles for blood type exist in the human population: allele IA, 
allele IB, and allele i. The IA, IB, and i alleles are the blueprints for enzymes 
that attach carbohydrates to the surfaces of your red blood cells:

243
 Chapter 16: Expect the Unexpected: Non-Mendelian Patterns of Inheritance
 
✓ If you have allele IA, then you make an enzyme that attaches carbohydrate 
A to your blood cells.
 
✓ If you have allele IB, then you make an enzyme that attaches carbohydrate 
B to your blood cells.
 
✓ Allele i is nonfunctional and won’t result in either carbohydrate A or 
carbohydrate B being attached to your blood cells.
Every person has two copies of the gene for the ABO markers, which are 
called ABO antigens. A person’s blood type depends on which two alleles 
they have (see Figure 16-2):
 
✓ People who have the genotype IAIA or IAi have Type A blood. Their 
red blood cells have the A antigen on their surfaces.
 
✓ People who have the genotype IBIB or IBi have Type B blood. Their red 
blood cells have the B antigen on their surfaces.
 
✓ People who have the genotype IAIB have Type AB blood. Their red 
blood cells have both the A antigen and the B antigen on their surfaces. 
The A and B alleles are codominant to each other because both alleles 
are visible, yet distinct, in the phenotype of the heterozygote.
 
✓ People who have the genotype ii have Type O blood. Their red blood 
cells have neither the A nor the B antigen on their surfaces.

Knowing your blood type is very important when you’re giving blood to or 
receiving blood from other people. Your body will attack any red blood cells 
that have ABO antigens that are different from your own by producing anti-
bodies against the foreign ABO antigens. Thus, you can receive only blood 
that is compatible with your own:
 
✓ People with Type AB blood can receive any type of blood. The immune 
systems of people with AB blood are trained to accept both the A and 
B antigen as normal and won’t make antibodies against any red blood 
cells (Figure 16-2). Thus, people with Type AB blood are called universal 
receivers.
 
✓ People with Type A blood can receive Type A or Type O blood. If 
any blood with the B antigen is introduced into the body, the immune 
system of Type A people will make antibodies against the B antigen. 
Type O blood cells do not have any ABO antigens on their surface, so 
they’re acceptable to people of any blood type. Thus, people with Type 
O blood are called universal donors.
 
✓ People with Type B blood can receive Type B or Type O blood. If any 
blood with A antigen is introduced into the body, the immune system of 
Type B people will make antibodies against the A antigen.
 
✓ People with Type O blood can receive only Type O blood. If any blood 
with B or A antigen is introduced into the body, the immune system of 
Type O people will make antibodies against these antigens.

Making an impact: Pleiotropic genes
Some genes affect a trait that is connected to many different characteristics. 
Genes that affect more than one trait are called pleiotropic genes. For example, 
people who have sickle cell anemia have two copies of a recessive allele for 
defective hemoglobin. The defective hemoglobin changes shape when oxygen 
levels in the cell decrease, causing the red blood cells to collapse, or sickle. 
On the one hand, the hemoglobin gene controls the structure and function of 
hemoglobin. However, when the defective alleles are present and the blood 
cells sickle, the sickling blood cells cause many other effects:
 
✓ Anemia and extreme fatigue result from the destruction of blood cells 
and lack of oxygen circulating around the body.
 
✓ The sickled cells plug capillaries, blocking blood flow to tissues and 
causing intense pain and muscle damage.
 
✓ The kidneys and spleen are damaged and can eventually fail.
These effects on the body represent changes to multiple aspects of a per-
son’s phenotype, all deriving from one pleiotropic gene.
It’s not that simple: Polygenic traits
Human eye color is often used as an example of dominant and recessive alleles. 
Alleles for blue eyes (b) are recessive to alleles for brown eyes (B), the story 
goes, so if you have two alleles for blue eyes (bb), your eyes are blue. If you 
have one or two alleles for brown eyes (Bb or BB), your eyes are brown.
There’s just one problem with this simple scenario — human eye color is 
much more diverse than just blue or brown. People have eyes ranging from 
blue to green to almost purple (think Elizabeth Taylor) to brown to almost 
black. If you walk up to ten people you know who have brown eyes and really 
look at their eyes, I’m guessing you’ll see ten different variations on the color 
brown. The same is true for ten people you know who have blue eyes. So, just 
what is the story with eye color?
Well, the first part of the story about human eye color is partially correct — 
alleles for dark eyes are dominant to alleles for light eyes. Alleles for dark 
eyes lead to the production of the pigment melanin — the same pigment that 
darkens skin or makes freckles — and the deposit of melanin into your eyes. 
People have so many variations in eye color because several genes, not just 

246
Part IV: Genetics: From One Generation to the Next 
one, are involved in the production and deposit of melanin in the eye. The 
number of dominant alleles you have determines the amount of melanin you 
have deposited in your eyes and thus your eye color:
 
✓ People with very dark, chocolate brown eyes have lots of melanin 
deposited in their eyes. They’re homozygous dominant for all the genes 
that control melanin production and deposition in the eye.
 
✓ People with grey or light blue eyes have very little melanin deposited in 
their eyes. They have very few dominant alleles in the genes that control 
melanin production and deposition in the eye. (People who have 
no melanin deposited in their eyes at all have pink eyes.)
 
✓ People with eye colors in between dark brown and grey or light blue 
have different amounts of melanin deposited in their eyes.
 
When a trait is controlled by many genes, it’s called a polygenic trait (see 
Figure 16-3).
Because people have many possible combinations of alleles in the genotypes 
for polygenic traits, a wide variety of phenotypes usually occurs. Human 
traits that are polygenic include eye color, skin color, and height. If you graph 
the number of people who have each variety of phenotype for a polygenic 
trait, the graph looks like a curve because of all the possible variations.

Almost Inseparable: Linked Genes
One of the biggest surprises for scientists studying genetics after Mendel is 
that some traits break the Law of Independent Assortment (see Chapter 15). 
When an individual who is heterozygous for two traits makes gametes, the 
prediction is that all possible combinations of alleles will occur in the gametes. 
However, some traits seem to want to travel together as if they are linked. When 
a person is heterozygous for two linked traits, they don’t make gametes with all 
combinations of alleles. Instead, some alleles behave as if they are stuck together 
and always show up together in gametes. A person who is heterozygous for two 
traits, controlled by genes A and B, will make very different gametes depending 
on whether these genes are unlinked or linked:
 
✓ If genes A and B assort independently, a heterozygote (AaBb) will make 
gametes with all possible combinations of alleles, AB, Ab, aB, and ab.
 
✓ If genes A and B are linked, a heterozygote (AaBb) will make only two 
types of gametes, such as AB and ab (see Figure 16-4).

Part IV: Genetics: From One Generation to the Next 
Traveling together because of linkage
Traits are linked because the genes for those traits are on the same chromo-
some. If two genes are close together on the same chromosome, they’ll travel 
together during anaphase I of meiosis when homologous chromosomes sepa-
rate from each other. (See Chapter 14 for more on meiosis.) The strength of 
the tendency to stick together varies for different genes depending on how 
close together the genes are on the chromosome.
 
Genes that are very close together on a chromosome are completely linked. 
The alleles for any two genes that are completely linked will always travel 
together.
If a person is heterozygous for two genes, A and B, that are completely linked, 
they will make only gametes with two genotypes instead of four. For example, if 
alleles A and B are on one homologous chromosome and the alleles a and b are 
on the other homologous chromosome, then they’ll make gametes only with 
the genotypes AB and ab, as shown in Figure 16-4. During meiosis, the A and 
B alleles will always travel together, and the a and b alleles will always travel 
together. Fewer gamete types are produced when genes are completely 
linked than when genes assort independently. Thus, a mating between two 
organisms that are heterozygous for linked genes will produce less diversity in 
offspring than will a mating between two organisms that are heterozygous for 
unlinked genes:
 
✓ If genes A and B assort independently, a mating between two heterozy-
gotes (AaBb) is predicted to produce offspring with a phenotypic ratio 
of 9:3:3:1. (See Chapter 15 for more information on predicting ratios.)
 
✓ If genes A and B are completely linked, a mating between two heterozygotes 
(AaBb) is predicted to produce offspring with a phenotypic ration of 3:1.
Slipping away through recombination
Genes that are linked because they’re on the same chromosome may be sepa-
rated by crossing-over (see Chapter 14). A person who is heterozygous for 
two traits (AaBb) may have alleles A and B on one chromosome and alleles a 
and b on the other chromosome. This heterozygote (AaBb) will produce dif-
ferent gametes types depending on whether the genes are completely linked 
or if they’re linked but recombination occurs between them:
 
✓ If the genes are completely linked, then the alleles will always travel 
together and gametes will have only the genotypes AB and ab. Because 
the combination of alleles in the gametes is the same combination as 
in the heterozygous parent, these combinations are called parental types.

249
 Chapter 16: Expect the Unexpected: Non-Mendelian Patterns of Inheritance
 
✓ If crossing-over occurs between the linked genes, then alleles may be 
switched between the homologous chromosomes (a for A, and b for B). 
This switching creates new combinations of alleles (aB and Ab) in the gam-
etes. Because these combinations of alleles are different than the combi-
nations seen in the heterozygous parent, they’re called recombinant types.
 
Crossing-over between linked genes allows the heterozygote to make all four 
types of gametes: AB and ab if no crossing-over occurs, and aB and Ab if 
crossing-over occurs. If two linked genes are very far apart, crossing-over will 
almost always occur between them very frequently and the genes will behave 
as if they are sorting independently. In other words, heterozygotes for the two 
genes will produce all four types of gametes in equal numbers, just as is pre-
dicted for unlinked genes (Chapter 15).
Building a map of a chromosome
The farther apart two linked genes are on a chromosome, the greater the chance 
that recombination will occur between the two genes. Thus, by performing 
crosses and observing the amount of recombination, you can figure out how 
far apart two genes are on a chromosome. If you do this process over and 
over again for different pairs of genes on the same chromosome, you can 
make a map of the chromosome showing where each gene is located. For 
each pair of traits, do the following:
 
1. Mate parental organisms that are homozygous for both traits.
 
 For example, cross a parental that has the genotype AABB with one that 
has the genotype aabb (see Figure 16-4).
 
2. Mate two F1 heterozygotes.
 
3. Count the number of F2 offspring that have parental phenotypes.
 
 The parental phenotypes are the combinations that were present in 
the parental generation. For example, if the parental with the genotype 
AABB in Figure 16-4 has a phenotype of tall (AA) and hairy (BB), then 
tall and hairy represents one parental combination of phenotypes. If 
the parental with the genotype aabb has a phenotype of short (aa) and 
hairless (bb), then short and hairless is the other parental combination 
of phenotypes. The total number of F2 offspring that were either tall and 
hairy or short and hairless would represent the number of parental com-
binations in the F2.
 
 Parental combinations in the F2 result when no crossing-over occurs 
between the linked genes.

250
Part IV: Genetics: From One Generation to the Next 
 
4. Count the number of F2 offspring that have recombinant phenotypes.
 
 Recombinant phenotypes are combinations that were not present in the 
parental generation. If the parental combinations of traits were tall and 
hairy versus short and hairless, then recombinant phenotypes would 
be tall and hairless or short and hairy. The total number of F2 offspring 
that were either tall and hairless or short and hairy would represent the 
number of recombinants in the F2.
 
 Recombinants in the F2 result when crossing-over occurs between the 
linked genes.
 
5. Calculate the percentage of recombinants in the F2.
 
 Divide the total number of offspring with recombinant phenotypes by 
the total number offspring in the F2 and then multiply the answer by 100. 
This percentage is called the recombination frequency. In Figure 16-4, no 
recombinant offspring existed, so the recombination frequency is 0.
 
6. Calculate the distance between the genes in map units.
 
 A map unit is defined as 1 percent recombination frequency. So, if you 
had 14 percent total recombinant phenotypes in the F2, that amount 
would tell you that the two genes were 14 map units apart on the chro-
mosome. In Figure 16-4, the recombinant frequency is 0, so the genes are 
0 map units apart. In other words, they’re completely linked.
Mama’s Boy: Sex-Linked Inheritance
Some traits break Mendel’s laws because they aren’t inherited equally by 
males and females. Traits that are inherited differently in males and females 
are called sex-linked traits.
The disease hemophilia, which results from a defect in blood-clotting proteins, 
is an example of a sex-linked trait. People who have hemophilia can’t clot their 
blood and are at risk from dying of blood loss whenever they’re injured. The 
disease was passed from Queen Victoria of England to her descendants and 
then spread throughout the royal families of Europe as Queen Victoria’s chil-
dren married other European royals. A curious pattern occurred as the disease 
spread through these families: All the affected individuals — those actually 
having the disease hemophilia — were male.
Analyzing the pedigree
The pedigree of Queen Victoria’s family, shown in Figure 16-5, provides infor-
mation regarding the inheritance of hemophilia. The pedigree contains four 
important clues:

251
 Chapter 16: Expect the Unexpected: Non-Mendelian Patterns of Inheritance
 
✓ The disease can skip generations. In other words, parents who don’t 
have the disease can produce children who do. Thus, hemophilia must 
be a recessive trait.
 
✓ The disease is much more common in males than in females. The dif-
ference between males and females is that males have X and Y for their 
sex chromosomes, whereas females have two X chromosomes. For a boy 
to be born with sex-linked trait like hemophilia, only his mom needs to 
give him the defective allele. For a girl to be born with a sex-linked trait, 
both parents need to give a defective allele.
 
✓ The disease is never passed from father to son. Sons get their Y chro-
mosomes from their fathers, so the disease isn’t carried on the Y 
chromosome.
 
✓ Affected sons are born to unaffected mothers. Sons get their X chromo-
somes from their mothers, so the disease is carried on the X chromosome.
The clues from Queen Victoria’s pedigree reveal that hemophilia is an 
X-linked recessive trait. In other words, the disease is caused by a recessive 
allele that is carried on the X-chromosome.
 
Males get their X chromosomes from their mother and their Y chromosomes 
from their father. Females get an X chromosome from each parent.

Part IV: Genetics: From One Generation to the Next 
You can link sex-linked traits to the X chromosome or the Y chromosome, and 
they can be dominant or recessive. Traits that are linked to the Y chromosome, 
called Y-linked traits, are much less common than X-linked traits because the 
Y chromosome doesn’t have a lot of genes on it. Sex-linked traits show 
distinctive patterns of inheritance in pedigrees:
 
✓ X-linked dominant traits affect both males and females.
 
• Because the traits are dominant, they don’t skip generations.
 
• Affected mothers can have both affected sons and daughters.
 
• All daughters of an affected father are affected.
 
✓ Y-linked traits affect only men.
 
• Affected men pass the trait to all their sons.
 
• The traits do not skip generations.
Explaining the differences
Scientists can explain the differences in the patterns of inheritance for sex-
linked traits by taking a closer look at the X and Y chromosomes. Although X 
and Y pair up with each other during meiosis, they’re actually quite different 
from each other:
 
✓ The human X chromosome contains more than a thousand genes that 
affect normal body functions. Some genes on the human X chromosome 
include genes for color vision and blood-clotting proteins, as well as the 
ability to make normal muscle proteins.
 
✓ The human Y chromosome is much smaller than the X and contains 
about 200 genes. The genes on the Y chromosome are completely 
different from the ones on the X chromosome. One of these genes, 
called SRY, turns on the development of the testes in male fetuses.
Because the X and Y chromosomes don’t have any genes in common, males 
have only one copy of each gene on the X chromosome (see Figure 16-6). 
Because males have only one copy of genes on the X, they can’t be homozy-
gous or heterozygous for these genes. Instead, they’re considered hemizygous. 
The difference in the number of X chromosomes causes X-linked recessive 
traits to be more common in males:
 
✓ If males have a defective allele on their X chromosome, they’ll show the 
defect in their phenotype.
 
✓ If females have a defective allele on their X chromosome, they may have 
a normal allele on their X chromosome. The normal allele will hide the 
effect of the defective allele.

Queen Victoria must have been heterozygous for hemophilia, because 
although she passed the disease on to her son Leopold, she herself didn’t 
have the disease. One of her X chromosomes had the disease allele, but the 
other X had a normal allele for blood-clotting protein, so she was able to clot 
her blood. Because Queen Victoria had the disease allele but didn’t show it, 
she is called a carrier of the disease.
You can predict the inheritance of sex-linked traits by using Punnett squares. 
(See Chapter 15 for more on Punnett squares.) Sex-linked traits are passed to 
gametes along with the sex chromosomes. When setting up a Punnett square for 
a sex-linked trait, remember to keep the alleles linked to the sex chromosomes:
 
✓ Male parents have only one allele for sex-linked traits.
 
• If the trait is X-linked, the allele is passed to gametes that receive 
the X chromosome from the male parent.
 
• If the trait is Y-linked, the allele is passed to gametes that receive 
the Y chromosome.
 
✓ Female parents have two alleles for X-linked traits and no alleles for 
Y-linked traits.
No boys allowed
Did you know that calico cats are almost always 
female? The gene for orange versus black coat 
color in cats is carried on the X chromosome. 
The Y chromosome doesn’t carry a gene for 
coat color. Male cats are XY, so they’re either 
orange (X chromosome carries orange allele) 
or black (X chromosome carries black allele). 
Female cats who are heterozygous for the two 
color alleles have orange and black fur. The 
only way a male cat can be a calico is if he has 
too many chromosomes and is XXY. Male calico 
cats do occasionally occur due to nondisjunc-
tion in meiosis (see Chapter 14), but they’re very 
rare and can’t produce offspring.

254
Part IV: Genetics: From One Generation to the Next 
The predicted offspring of a cross involving a sex-linked trait are created by 
combining gametes in the boxes of the Punnett square.
 
To keep track of alleles for sex-linked traits, make sure that you always write 
them as attached to an X or Y chromosome. For example, the dominant allele 
for hemophilia is written XH and the recessive allele is written Xh. By writing 
the alleles attached to an X or a Y, you’ll be less likely to forget that the allele 
is on only one type of sex chromosome.

T
he DNA code is the underlying program for how cells 
function. DNA determines the behavior of cells largely 
because it contains the blueprints for proteins, the domi-
nant worker molecules in cells. In order to build a protein, 
cells must copy the code from DNA into RNA in the pro-
cess of transcription and then use the RNA as a template 
for protein construction in the process of translation.
How and when the DNA code is used is just as important 
as the code itself. Cells control access to the DNA code in 
order to regulate function and development of cells. In 
this part, I explain how DNA is copied, how it is used to 
make proteins, and how cells control the information 
encoded in DNA.

efore a cell can reproduce itself, it must make a copy of its DNA, a 
process called DNA replication. Many enzymes play a role in DNA rep-
lication, and each one has a specific job. In this chapter, I examine the roles 
of the enzymes that copy DNA and explore the process of how the DNA is 
copied.
DNA Replication: An Overview
Cells copy their DNA by a process called DNA replication. DNA replication 
occurs whenever a cell is going to reproduce itself, either by mitosis or 
binary fission. (For more on these processes, see Chapter 13.) DNA replica-
tion also occurs before cells in reproductive tissue make sperm or eggs by 
meiosis (see Chapter 14).
If a cell is going to divide to make more cells, then the parent cell needs to 
copy all of its parts, including the DNA. Of course, because the DNA contains 
the blueprints for the functioning of the cell, it’s especially important that the 
DNA is copied very carefully. Any mistake in the DNA code, called a mutation, 
can affect a cell’s ability to function correctly. Thus, cells have evolved a pro-
cess that carefully unwinds the DNA and uses the existing code as a pattern 
for copying the code into new DNA molecules. (For more on the structure of 
DNA, see Chapter 7.)

258
Part V: Molecular Genetics: Reading the Book of Life 
 
In order to make an exact copy of each DNA molecule, cells use semiconserva-
tive replication. The two halves of the double helix are separated from each 
other, and each half is used as a template, or pattern, to direct the synthesis 
of the other half. Each old half gets a new partner, resulting in two DNA mole-
cules from one.
Everybody Lend a Hand: Enzymes 
Involved in DNA Replication
You’ve probably seen construction crews hard at work putting up a new 
building. Many people are members of the crew, and each person is a special-
ist in one particular part of the job. The same is true for DNA replication — 
many enzymes are part of the crew that copies the DNA, and each enzyme has 
a particular job. The enzymes involved in DNA replication are as follows:
 
✓ Helicase breaks, or melts, the hydrogen bonds that hold the two halves 
of the double helix together.
 
✓ Topoisomerase breaks and reseals the DNA backbone to allow the back-
bone to release tension caused by twisting.
 
✓ Primase, also called RNA polymerase, puts down small pieces of RNA 
called primers. The primers serve as starting points for copying the DNA.
 
✓ DNA polymerase makes new strands of DNA. Two different DNA poly-
merases are involved in DNA replication:
 
• DNA polymerase III copies the DNA by reading the code on the 
existing strands and building new strands that are complemen-
tary to the originals. The enzyme follows the base pairing rules 
described in Chapter 7. For example, if an A appears in the original 
strand, it brings in a nucleotide with a T.
 
• DNA polymerase I removes RNA nucleotides from the RNA primers 
and replaces them with DNA nucleotides so that no RNA is remain-
ing in the DNA when the job is done.
 
✓ DNA ligase seals up breaks in the DNA backbone by forming covalent 
bonds between nucleotides.
 
The names of the enzymes involved in DNA replication give clues to their jobs. 
Helicase unzips the helix. Primase gets things started, or primes the pump, by 
putting down primers. DNA polymerase makes polymers of DNA. Ligate means 
to tie, so DNA ligase ties up the broken bits of DNA by forming covalent bonds 
along the sugar-phosphate backbone.

259
 Chapter 17: DNA Synthesis: Doubling Your Genetic Stuff
It Takes a Village: Events 
at the Replication Fork
The enzymes involved in DNA replication stay together in a large enzyme 
work crew, called an enzyme complex, that slides along the DNA, copying as 
it goes. All the enzymes are working simultaneously, each doing their part in 
the sequence of events that needs to occur to copy the DNA. DNA replication 
is easiest to understand if you look at each of the events of DNA replication in 
order from what must happen first to what happens last.
Start at the very beginning: 
Origins of replication
 
DNA replication begins at specific locations within the chromosome. These 
locations are marked by particular DNA sequences called origins of replication 
(ORI), shown in Figure 17-1.

A specific set of proteins recognizes this sequence and opens the double 
helix at each origin of replication. Once the double helix has been opened, 
the enzyme complex that copies the DNA can begin. Replication occurs 
in both directions away from the origin, conducted by two enzyme com-
plexes that begin at each origin and move away from each other along the 
DNA. Bacterial chromosomes have one origin of replication, so two enzyme 
complexes move around the circular chromosome away from the origin. 

260
Part V: Molecular Genetics: Reading the Book of Life 
Eukaryotic chromosomes, including those of humans, have multiple origins 
of replication (see Figure 17-1), so several enzyme complexes work on each 
chromosome once replication begins.
As the enzymes unwind the DNA to begin copying, a visible loop called a rep-
lication bubble is created in the DNA. At both sides of the bubble is a V-shaped 
area where the DNA that is being copied meets up with the DNA that hasn’t 
been unwound yet. These V-shaped structures are called replication forks. 
Replication forks are the places where DNA replication (see Figure 17-2) is 
actively happening — in other words, they’re where the enzymes are doing 
their jobs.
Learning to unwind with helicase
Once the DNA has been opened at the origin, the enzyme helicase, shown in 
Figure 17-2, catalyzes the breaking of the hydrogen bonds between the base 
pairs. You can think of helicase like the metal piece that slides along a zipper 
and causes it to unzip. Helicase unzips the hydrogen bonds, and the two 
halves of the DNA helix separate. Once the strands are separated, proteins 
called single-strand DNA-binding proteins (SSBPs) act like thumbtacks to hold 
the DNA open by binding to the separated strands and stopping them from 
rejoining each other.
One difference between the double helix and a zipper is that a zipper is flat 
and the double helix is twisted. As helicase unzips the double helix, these 
twists get pushed together, creating tension in the DNA backbone. The DNA 
backbone would become kinked as it is unzipped if it weren’t for the action 
of another enzyme, called topoisomerase. As the twists in the DNA get tight, 
topoisomerase catalyzes the breaking of covalent bonds in the backbone of 
the DNA. Once the backbone is cut, it can untwist and release the tension. 
Then, topoisomerase forms a new covalent bond to reseal the DNA.
 
To help you imagine how DNA molecules may be stressed as they unwind, try 
taking a rubber band and twisting it around and around until it starts to kink. 
Kinks like these would form in the DNA if it weren’t for topoisomerase.
Putting down some primer
After helicase has opened the double helix, the genetic code is available to be 
copied. However, there is a small problem — DNA polymerase III, the enzyme 
that reads the code and builds new strands of DNA, can’t start a strand of 
DNA on its own. DNA polymerase III can only add nucleotides to an existing 
strand. So, before DNA polymerase can do its job, it needs a helper enzyme 
to get the new strands started.

The helper enzyme is Primase, an RNA polymerase that builds strands of 
RNA. Primase can start a strand on its own and it makes short pieces of RNA, 
called primers (Figure 17-2), that are complementary to the DNA. Once the 

262
Part V: Molecular Genetics: Reading the Book of Life 
primers have been made by Primase, DNA polymerase III can start making 
DNA by attaching DNA nucleotides to the 3' ends of the primers. (See Chapter 
7 for more on 5' and 3' ends of DNA.)
Rolling down the line
Once the primers are in place, DNA polymerase III can begin to synthesize 
new DNA, as shown in Figure 17-2. It uses the original DNA strands as a tem-
plate and follows the base-pairing rules described in Chapter 7 when bring-
ing in nucleotides. If the original strand has adenine (A), DNA polymerase 
III brings in thymine (T) and attaches the 5' end of the thymine to the 3' end 
of the growing new strand. Thus, the new DNA strands always get longer at 
their 3' ends. Scientists say that the DNA “grows in the 5' to 3' direction.”
 
DNA polymerase III has certain quirks about the way it functions:
 
✓ It must have a template to match nucleotides against.
 
✓ It can’t start a new strand on its own.
 
✓ It always adds new nucleotides to the 3' end of an existing strand.
Replacing some tiles
When your cells divide and your DNA gets copied, I’m guessing you want a 
good job to be done — everything copied correctly, nice and perfect DNA, 
right? You probably don’t want a bunch of RNA primers cluttering up your 
chromosomes. That is why cells have the fix-it enzyme, DNA polymerase I. 
DNA polymerase I slides along the DNA that has been copied and, wherever 
it finds a piece of RNA, it removes the RNA nucleotides and replaces them 
with their DNA counterpart. So, if it removes the RNA version of adenine, 
it replaces it with the DNA version of adenine, and so on. (RNA has uracil 
instead of thymine, so uracil RNA nucleotides get replaced with thymine DNA 
nucleotides.) When DNA polymerase I is done with its job, all the RNA has 
been removed, and only DNA is left, which I’m sure is a big relief to you and 
your cells.
 
Reactions that build complex molecules from smaller pieces, like the synthesis 
of DNA, are endergonic — in other words, they require energy. Cells get around 
this problem by bringing in the nucleotides in a very energy-rich form as deoxy-
ribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs). dNTPs are essentially nucleotides with 

263
 Chapter 17: DNA Synthesis: Doubling Your Genetic Stuff
three phosphates attached; for example, ATP is a dNTP. The removal of two 
phosphates from a dNTP is so energetically favorable — in other words, so 
exergonic — that it makes the process of DNA replication exergonic overall.
Tying up loose ends
When DNA polymerase I is done replacing RNA primers with DNA, covalent 
bonds are still missing along the sugar-phosphate backbone. Every time a 
new stretch of DNA is begun with a primer, the DNA is copied until DNA poly-
merase III bumps into the next primer. Then, DNA polymerase III detaches 
and moves to the next primer without forming a covalent bond between its 
last nucleotide and the 5' end. Even after the primers are replaced with DNA 
by DNA polymerase I, these gaps remain. Sealing up these gaps is the job of 
the enzyme DNA ligase.
 
DNA ligase slides along the new DNA and closes gaps between DNA fragments 
by catalyzing the formation of covalent bonds in the sugar-phosphate 
backbone.
Finishing the job
The enzyme complexes that replicate the DNA begin at the origin of replica-
tion and move in both directions away from the origin. They continue moving 
along the DNA until all the DNA has been copied. This moves the replication 
forks along the chromosomes. When two replication forks meet, then all the 
DNA between the origins has been copied, and the enzyme complex lets go of 
the DNA.
 
Figure 17-2, earlier in this chapter, shows all the enzymes in the replication 
complex doing their jobs simultaneously. It represents a moment in time and 
can be confusing because everything is happening at once. The best way to 
understand replication is to draw several pictures yourself, beginning with an 
unwound double helix, and moving through each step chronologically. After 
you draw a double helix, ask yourself, “What would happen next?” It should be 
fairly obvious that you need to open up the DNA to get in there and copy it. 
So, then draw a replication bubble with some helicase and single-strand DNA-
binding proteins. Again, ask yourself, “What would happen next?” Keep doing 
this until you’ve sketched out the whole process. One of your drawings should 
look just like Figure 17-2, but it will mean so much more when you see it as 
part of a sequence of events.

264
Part V: Molecular Genetics: Reading the Book of Life 
Keeping It Together: Leading 
and Lagging Strands
The two strands of the double helix are antiparallel to each other, which 
means that their 5' and 3' ends are pointing in opposite directions. Likewise, 
when the helix is unwound and each original strand gets a new partner 
strand, the partner strands will be built antiparallel to the originals. For 
example, the two new strands that are being built at the replication fork in 
Figure 17-2, earlier in this chapter, are pointing in opposite directions. The 3' 
ends of the new strands are labeled and also indicated by an arrowhead. On 
one side of the replication fork, the 3' ends of the new DNA point away from 
the fork; on the other side, they point toward the replication fork.
When DNA polymerase III is adding nucleotides to the new strands of DNA, 
it always adds them to their 3' ends. Thus, one new strand of DNA is growing 
away from the replication fork, while the other is growing toward the fork. The 
opposite polarity of the DNA strands creates something of a problem because 
all the enzymes involved in DNA replication stay together as they copy the 
DNA on both sides of the replication fork. Figure 17-2 shows all the enzymes 
as if they’re separate from each other so that you can see each one, but really 
they’re all joined in one large work crew, or enzyme complex. The enzymes 
work crew keeps moving toward the fork as more DNA is unwound, but one 
DNA polymerase III keeps trying to copy DNA in the opposite direction! To 
stay with the work crew, this DNA polymerase keeps making short pieces of 
DNA and then skipping along the DNA back toward the fork and starting again 
on a new primer. Thus, one new strand of DNA at a replication fork is made in 
pieces called Okasaki fragments, which you can see in Figures 17-2 and 17-3.
The new strand that is made in fragments is called the lagging strand, shown 
in Figure 17-3. The 3' end of the primer that begins the lagging strand points 
away from the fork and the direction that the enzyme crew is moving, so the 
lagging strand must be restarted over and over again as the enzyme crew 
moves away. RNA polymerase keeps putting down new primers on the side 
of the fork where the lagging strand is being built so that DNA polymerase III 
can keep working. Thus, DNA polymerase I has lots of work to do on the lag-
ging strand removing all those primers. In addition, DNA ligase has to form 
covalent bonds between all the fragments of DNA.
On the opposite side of the replication fork from the lagging strand, there 
is no problem — the 3' of the primer on that side points toward the fork, in 
the direction that the enzyme crew is moving. Thus, once DNA polymerase 
III gets started making new DNA on that side of the fork, the enzyme can just 
keep going and the new strand is made in one long continuous piece known 
as the leading strand.

265
 Chapter 17: DNA Synthesis: Doubling Your Genetic Stuff
 
No matter how a replication fork is drawn, you can always tell where the 
leading and lagging strands will be built. Just do the following:
 
1. Mark the 5' and 3' ends of the original two DNA strands at the replica-
tion fork.

 Remember that it will be antiparallel, or opposite, to the original DNA.
 
3. Look at the 3' ends of the primers.
 
 The 3' end that points toward the fork is where the leading strand will 
get started.

Sometimes, people think that the terms leading and lagging refer to the origi-
nal strands of DNA at the replication fork, but this idea is wrong. The terms 
leading and lagging refer to the new strands of DNA that are made as new part-
ners for the original strands. So, if you’re looking at a replication fork, you 
must find the new strands, or draw them in, in order to figure out which is the 
leading strand and which is the lagging.
In cells that have linear chromosomes, including those of humans and other 
eukaryotes, the lagging strand gets a little bit shorter every time the DNA 
is copied. The shortening occurs at the very ends of the chromosomes. 
Once the primer is removed, there is no room for a new primer, and DNA 

266
Part V: Molecular Genetics: Reading the Book of Life 
polymerase III can’t copy the DNA without one. Fortunately, the ends of 
the chromosomes are capped with very repetitive sequences of DNA called 
telomeres. The telomeres don’t contain any code that is needed by the cell, 
so they can be shortened without affecting cell function. However, once the 
telomeres become critically short, the cell can’t divide anymore because it 
can’t copy its chromosomes without losing important information.
Achieving immortality
Most cell types can divide only a certain number 
of times before their telomeres become too short 
and the cells can’t copy their DNA. However, 
some cells in the body, like those that give rise 
to blood cells, have to divide forever. How do 
they do it? These cells activate a particular 
blueprint in the DNA to make a protein called 
telomerase that can fix telomeres. Telomerase 
carries around a little template, made of RNA, 
that lets it build new telomeres onto the ends 
of chromosomes, keeping the chromosomes 
long. This telomere repair lets the cells continue 
dividing indefinitely.
On a scary note, many cancer cells have figured 
out a way to turn on the telomerase blueprint, 
too. One reason tumors can keep growing and 
growing is because cancer cells within them 
have the ability to keep their telomeres long. 
By using telomerase to repair their telomeres, 
cancer cells can keep copying their DNA and 
thus keep dividing!

D
NA contains the blueprints for important worker molecules in the cell, 
such as RNA and protein. The information in DNA is copied by tran-
scription to make RNA. One type of RNA, called messenger RNA, carries the 
information for proteins to the ribosome. Ribosomes and molecules of tRNA 
work together to translate the mRNA message and build proteins. In this 
chapter, I present the details of transcription and translation and explore the 
effect of mutation on protein and cell function.
File It Under Genes: The Blueprints 
for RNA and Proteins
DNA contains the genetic code of the cell, a code that controls the cell’s struc-
ture and function. However, the DNA itself is just the information, a detailed 
blueprint, not the active agents that carry out the plan. The plan is carried 
out by the molecules that are coded for by the DNA. So, the code in the DNA 
leads to the creation of worker molecules, and these worker molecules act 
according to the plan in the DNA and based on signals received by the cell. 
The actions of the worker molecules lead to the particular structure and 
function of the cell. Thus, the code in the DNA ultimately controls the struc-
ture and function of the cell.

268
Part V: Molecular Genetics: Reading the Book of Life 
Two types of worker molecules are encoded by the DNA:
 
✓ RNA molecules of several types are involved in the synthesis of proteins. 
Some RNA molecules act as information carriers, while others have enzy-
matic activity and catalyze reactions during protein synthesis. RNA mol-
ecules that act as enzymes are called ribozymes.
 
✓ Proteins are the main worker molecules of the cell. (For more on proteins, 
see Chapter 6.) They perform a wide range of cellular functions including 
catalysis (enzymes), structural support (cytoskeleton), signaling (recep-
tors), transport (membrane proteins and cytoskeleton), and cellular 
identity (membrane proteins).
Defining a gene
A gene is a single blueprint for a worker molecule. If you think of your entire 
genome as a big file cabinet, each drawer would be a chromosome, and the 
files within the drawers would be the genes. Humans have 46 chromosomes, 
so your file cabinet would have 46 drawers. Based on the Human Genome 
Project, which determined the DNA sequence of the entire human genome, 
humans have about 22,500 genes scattered among those chromosomes. So, 
that would be 22,500 files in your file cabinet. Each file would contain the 
blueprint for the construction of a different worker molecule, either an RNA 
or a polypeptide (protein).
Going with the flow
The main worker molecules of the cell are proteins, and the genes for pro-
teins are contained within the DNA. However, in order to build the protein, 
the information in the gene must first be copied into a messenger molecule, 
called messenger RNA (mRNA). The messenger RNA takes the copy of the 
blueprint to the ribosome where it’s used to build the protein. DNA is copied 
into RNA by the process of transcription, and then an mRNA copy is taken to 
the ribosome where it’s translated into a protein sequence. 
 
The flow of information to build a protein in a cell starts with the DNA, then flows 
to mRNA, and then is used to build the protein. This pathway of information 
from DNA to RNA to protein is called the central dogma of molecular biology.
Make a Copy, Please: Transcription
The code in DNA is copied into RNA by a process called transcription. During 
transcription, the double helix of DNA is opened, and one strand of DNA is 

269
 Chapter 18: Transcription and Translation: What’s in a Gene?
used as a pattern for the construction of an RNA molecule. Several types of 
RNA molecules perform different jobs in the cell (see Chapter 7). The RNA 
molecules either do a job directly for the cell, or, as in the case of mRNA, the 
mRNA molecules serve as a copy of important information.
 
Because protein synthesis is so important to the life of a cell, it’s usually a big 
topic in molecular and cellular biology. Biology professors place lots of 
emphasis on the flow of information from DNA to mRNA to protein. With all 
this emphasis on the central dogma, you can easily forget that other kinds of 
RNA exist besides mRNA and that transcription makes all kinds of RNA. So, 
when you think about transcription, remember that this process can make 
several different types of RNA , but that only mRNA goes on to serve as the 
blueprint for a protein during the process of translation.
Locating the file
Genes may make up only a small percentage of the total DNA of a cell. In 
humans, for example, only about 2 percent of DNA contains the codes for 
protein. Scientists are still figuring out the functions of the other 98 percent, 
although much of it seems to be involved in regulating how the information 
in the DNA is used. (See Chapters 19 and 21 for more on gene regulation and 
the human genome.)
 
When a cell needs to build a protein, it recognizes the genes for proteins among 
all that other DNA. Cells recognize genes for proteins by their promoters, unique 
sequences of DNA that are located at the beginning of genes (see Figure 18-1).
If you think of genes as the files in your genetic file cabinet, then promoters are 
like the tabs that stick up off the files and label the files with their contents. In 
bacteria, promoters are 40 to 50 base pairs long and are located right next to 
the genes they label. In eukaryotes, promoters are more variable.
Proteins that turn on transcription recognize certain DNA sequences in 
promoters. For example, all bacterial promoters have two very similar 
sequences located in key spots within the promoter. These sequences are 
named for their distance from the spot in the gene where transcription 
begins, called the +1 (“plus one”) site:
 
✓ The –10 box has the sequence TATAAT and is located ten bases away 
from the transcription start site.
 
✓ The –35box has the sequence TTGACA and is located 35 bases away 
from the transcription start site.
Although eukaryotic promoters are more variable, about 20 percent of 
eukaryotic promoters contain a common sequence TATAAA, called a TATA 
box (“ta-ta” box), located near the +1 site of the gene.

Hiring a worker
The enzyme that reads genes and copies the information into RNA is called 
RNA polymerase (see Figure 18-1). RNA polymerase opens the double helix 
and uses one of the strands of DNA as a template for the construction of an 
RNA molecule. In order to copy the code, RNA polymerase follows the base 
pairing rules (see Chapter 7) as it brings in RNA nucleotides to match up with 
the DNA nucleotides.
 
RNA polymerase catalyzes the formation of covalent bonds between the nucle-
otides in a growing RNA molecule.

271
 Chapter 18: Transcription and Translation: What’s in a Gene?
By following the base pairing rules, RNA polymerase reads one strand of 
DNA and builds a complementary molecule of RNA. The strand that is read is 
called the template strand because it provides the pattern. The strand of DNA 
that isn’t used by RNA polymerase is called the nontemplate strand.
 
The nontemplate strand of DNA is sometimes called the coding strand. This 
terminology can be confusing because people think the coding strand must be 
the one that RNA polymerase uses to get the code. But this assumption isn’t 
correct — RNA polymerase uses the template strand. Both the nontemplate 
(coding) strand and the RNA molecule are complementary to the template 
strand, so they essentially contain the same code. The similarity between the 
code in the RNA and the nontemplate strand is the reason the nontemplate 
strand got the name coding strand.
When RNA polymerase pairs RNA nucleotides with the DNA nucleotides of 
the template strand, the nucleotides must be turned antiparallel to each 
other. So, RNA polymerase reads the template strand of DNA in the 3' to 5' 
direction in order to build the new RNA molecule in the 5' to 3' direction: In 
other words, the 5' end of incoming RNA nucleotides are joined to the 3' of 
the growing RNA chain.
 
RNA polymerase needs helpers in order to recognize promoters and begin 
transcription. These helpers are regulatory proteins that control the process 
of transcription (see Chapter 19). In bacteria, sigma proteins attach to RNA 
polymerase, forming a complex called a holoenzyme. The holoenzyme then 
binds to promoters and begins transcription. In eukaryotes, regulatory pro-
teins called transcription factors (see Chapter 19) help RNA polymerase bind to 
promoters. Once RNA polymerase binds to promoters, it can begin reading 
and copying the DNA message into an RNA molecule.
Marking the end
Just like promoter sequences mark the beginning of genes, transcription termi-
nators mark the ends of genes.
 
Transcription terminators are sequences in the DNA that trigger RNA poly-
merase to release the DNA and stop transcribing.
A transcription terminator may contain a code that creates a piece of RNA 
that folds back on itself, forming a hairpin loop. This lumpy piece of RNA 
essentially knocks RNA polymerase loose from the DNA, ending transcription 
of this gene. Of course, RNA polymerase will go on to transcribe many more 
genes and so can say “I’ll be back!” to the terminator.

272
Part V: Molecular Genetics: Reading the Book of Life 
 
The synthesis of RNA molecules during transcription is an example of a chemical 
reaction that builds complex molecules from smaller pieces. Synthesis reactions 
like this one are typically endergonic (see Chapter 10) — in other words, 
requiring energy. In order to make transcription energetically favorable, cells 
bring in the RNA nucleotides as ribonucleoside triphosphates (NTPs), a very 
energy-rich form of nucleotides that contains three phosphate groups. The 
removal of two phosphates from each NTP as the nucleotide joined to the 
growing RNA molecule is so exergonic that it makes the overall process of 
transcription exergonic, too.
Finishing Touches: RNA Processing 
in Eukaryotes
After eukaryotic genes for proteins are transcribed, they’re not quite ready 
to be translated. In fact, the RNA that is made from protein-encoding genes in 
eukaryotes is called a pre-mRNA or primary RNA transcript to indicate that the 
transcript isn’t yet finished.
One issue that needs to be dealt with before translation is that eukaryotic 
genes for proteins don’t just contain the code for the protein. The code for 
the protein contains short stretches of nucleotides, called introns, that break 
up the code (see Figure 18-2). The introns must be removed from the pre-
mRNA before the mRNA is translated. The portions of the pre-mRNA that do 
contain the information for the protein are called exons. The exons remain in 
the finished mRNA and are expressed in the final protein.

 Chapter 18: Transcription and Translation: What’s in a Gene?
 
To remember the difference between exons and introns, think “Exons are 
expressed; introns interrupt.”
Small particles made of RNA and protein remove introns from the pre-mRNA. 
The particles are called snRPs (pronounced “snurps”) for small nuclear ribo-
nucleoproteins. Several snRPs gather together to form spliceosomes that clip 
the pre-mRNA at the boundaries between exons and introns, remove the 
introns, and then form bonds between the exons. This method of remov-
ing introns is called splicing because the removal of introns is similar to the 
process of clipping out pieces of movie film and then resealing the remaining 
pieces to make an edited version of the film.
 
The enzymes in the spliceosome that cut and reseal the pre-mRNA seem to be 
part of the small nuclear RNA (snRNA) that makes up the snRPs. Most 
enzymes are proteins, but the snRNA in the snRPs is another example in a 
growing list of cases in which RNA molecules act as enzymes.
Along with splicing, the cell makes two more changes to the pre-mRNA to get 
it ready for translation:
 
✓ A protective cap, called the 5' cap, is added to the 5' end of the pre-
mRNA. The 5' cap identifies the finished mRNA as an RNA that should be 
translated.
 
✓ Enzymes clip off the 3' end of the pre-mRNA and replace it with a piece 
of RNA that has between 100 and 250 adenine nucleotides. This poly-A tail 
protects the finished mRNA from being broken down by the cell.
Making a Protein: Translation
When a cell needs to build a protein, RNA polymerase reads the code for the 
protein in the DNA and copies it into a molecule of mRNA. The mRNA is then 
shipped out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm where ribosomes and 
tRNAs use the code in the mRNA to build the protein. When the protein is fin-
ished, it will be available to do its job for the cell.
The code in mRNA is written in the pattern of the four nucleotides — C, G, A, 
and U — that occur in the strand. The length of the strand, the proportion 
of each nucleotide in the strand, and the order of the nucleotides can all be 
different from one mRNA molecule to another. For example, the mRNA that 
contains the code for the protein insulin would be quite different from the 
mRNA that contains the code for the protein collagen. Insulin and collagen 
are unique in shape and function — insulin is a globular signaling protein 
and collagen is a fibrous structural protein, so their primary structure, the 

274
Part V: Molecular Genetics: Reading the Book of Life 
sequence of amino acids in the protein, is also unique. The differences in the 
code in the mRNA molecules is what determines the differences in the pri-
mary structure of the protein.
Reading the code
The nucleotide code in mRNA molecules determines the primary structure 
of a protein. In other words, the pattern of nucleotides decides the type and 
ordering of the amino acids in the polypeptide chain. The cell “reads” the 
mRNA code in blocks of three nucleotides called codons. Each codon tells the 
cell which amino acid should be added to the polypeptide chain. Twenty dif-
ferent amino acids are found in cells, but you can make 64 three-letter codons 
out of four nucleotides. Thus, the genetic code is redundant, and some amino 
acids are represented by more than one codon.
Scientists have figured out what all 64 codons represent to the cell and have 
organized this information into a codon dictionary, shown in Figure 18-3. If 
you’re given the nucleotide sequence of a piece of mRNA, you can use this 
dictionary to determine the type and order of amino acids represented by 
the mRNA by following these steps:
 
1. Find the large row on the left of the table that is marked with the first 
letter of the codon you want to look up.
 
 For example, to determine which amino acid is represented by the 
codon CAG, start with the second large row in the table because that 
row is marked with the letter C.
 
2. Find the column in the table that is marked with the second letter of 
the codon you want to look up and then put your finger on the area 
of the table where the row you looked up in Step 1 intersects with the 
column.
 
 For CAG, you find the third column because this column is marked with 
an A. Then, you slide your fingers along the table and find the section of 
the table where the row and column intersect. At the intersection, the 
names of two amino acids, histidine and glutamine, are each 
written twice.
 
3. For the area of the table you identified in Step 2, find the small row at 
the right of the table that is marked with the third letter of the codon 
you want to look up.
 
 Follow the line of the small row across to the intersection you identified 
in Step 2 to determine the correct amino acid. For CAG, the third letter 
is G, which marks the bottom small row of the area you identified in #2. 
Thus, the codon CAG represents the bottom amino acid, glutamine.

When you’re decoding an mRNA molecule, you have to begin and end at the 
right place in the sequence. Each mRNA molecule has a section near the 5' 
cap that is recognized by the ribosome. This ribosomal binding site isn’t part 
of the code for the protein. The protein code begins at the start codon, which 
has the sequence AUG.
 
Translation begins at the start codon closest to the 5' end of the mRNA molecule. 
The protein code is then decoded in the 5' to 3' direction until another special 
codon, a stop codon, is reached. Three stop codons — UAA, UGA, and UAG — 
mark the end of translation.

276
Part V: Molecular Genetics: Reading the Book of Life 
After you identify the start codon in the protein code, you can figure out all 
the codons from the start codon to the stop codon simply by marking off the 
nucleotides in groups of three. The grouping of the nucleotides into threes 
determines the reading frame for the protein code. In other words, by group-
ing the nucleotides into threes, you determine how the protein code will be 
read. For example, imagine that you want to decode a short piece of mRNA 
with the following sequence:
5' CUAGAUGACCUUGUGA3'
If you just start at the left end of the sequence and break the nucleotides up 
into threes, you’d get CUA, GAU, GAC, and so on. If, however, you start at 
the AUG closest to the 5' end, you get AUG, ACC, UUG, and UGA. These two 
groupings represent two different reading frames. If you look up the amino 
acids determined by these two different arrangements of codons, you see 
very different results! Only the second reading frame, which began with the 
start codon, gives you the correct amino acid sequence: methionine, threo-
nine, leucine. Notice that the start codon, AUG, also represents an amino 
acid, methionine, whereas the stop codons don’t specify an amino acid.
 
One way to remember the rules for decoding mRNA is to compare them to the 
rules for reading English, described in Table 18-1.

The decoder: tRNA
Cells follow the same rules for decoding mRNA as people do. Cells, however, 
don’t have a codon dictionary like the one shown in Figure 18-3. Instead, cells 
rely upon a decoder molecule called transfer RNA, or tRNA, shown in Figure 
18-4. tRNA molecules carry in the amino acids for the protein and figure out 
where to put them in the growing polypeptide chain.

To figure out where to put the amino acids, tRNA molecules have a special 
structure called an anticodon. Three nucleotides at one end of the tRNA form 
the anticodon. Anticodons fit up against codons in the mRNA, binding with 
hydrogen bonds just like the two halves of the DNA double helix.
In order for anticodons and codons to pair, they must have complementary 
sequences. For example, the start codon 5'AUG3' only fits correctly with the 
tRNA that has the anticodon 3'UAC5'. Just like all nucleic acids, the codons 
and anticodons pair with each other in an antiparallel arrangement, with 
opposite 5' and 3' ends.
 
In a cell, tRNA molecules with anticodons carry the amino acids. Sometimes 
people get confused and think that the codon dictionary shows which anti-
codons go with each amino acid, but that thought process is incorrect. People 
wrote the codon dictionary to serve as a reference for decoding mRNA. It 
totally skips over the role of the tRNA. So, the codon dictionary shows codons 

278
Part V: Molecular Genetics: Reading the Book of Life 
in the mRNA. The Table of the Genetic Code is for you to use when you’re 
decoding the mRNA and has nothing to do with anticodons.
The matching of mRNA codons and tRNA anticodons correctly arranges the 
amino acids in the growing protein chain. The 20 amino acids that are found 
in proteins are carried by about 40 different tRNAs. tRNAs that carry amino 
acids are called aminoacyl tRNAs. Each aminoacyl tRNA carries its amino acid 
at its 3' end and has a unique anticodon in its anticodon loop that can pair 
only with its complementary mRNA codon. Thus, the mRNA code determines 
the order in which the different tRNAs deposit their amino acid cargo.
Master craftsman: The ribosome
The ribosome organizes the meeting of mRNA and tRNA molecules in order 
to translate the mRNA code into a sequence of amino acids. When the large 
and small subunits of the ribosome join to form a completed ribosome, pock-
ets are formed inside the ribosome (see Figure 18-5). These pockets, called 
the A site, P site, and E site, organize the arrival and departure of the tRNAs as 
they bring their amino acids to the growing protein chain. During translation, 
tRNAs enter the ribosome through the A site, then move to the P site, and 
finally exit from the E site.
 
The ribosome catalyzes peptide bond formation between the amino acids as 
they’re brought together by the tRNAs.
You can think of the ribosome as the craftsman that drives in the nail to hold 
together the building blocks brought in by the tRNAs. The part of the ribo-
some that catalyzes the peptide bond is made of rRNA. Thus, the ribosome 
acts as a ribozyme (say that ten times fast!).
Wobble power
Remember how 61 codons for amino acids 
represent just 20 amino acids? (The three stop 
codons don’t represent amino acids.) And only 
40 tRNAs carry those amino acids? So, why are 
there 61 codons if only 40 anticodons exist? 
How can 40 tRNAs recognize all 61 codons?
The answer is that the third nucleotide in the 
anticodon isn’t very picky about which nucle-
otide it pairs up with. For example, if you look 
at the table of the genetic code shown in 
Figure 18-3, you can see that the amino acid 
proline is represented by the codons 5’CCU3’, 
5’CCC3’, 5’CCA3’, and 5’CCG3’. A single tRNA 
can match all four of these codons as long as 
its anticodon starts with 3’GG5’. The nucleotide 
in the third position in the anticodon can be any 
nucleotide. This variability in the third position 
of the anticodon is called wobble in the genetic 
code. Because of wobble, 40 tRNAs can recog-
nize 61 codons!

The steps of translation
Translation occurs in three phases, shown in Figures 18-6 and 18-7.
 
✓ Initiation of translation begins when the small subunit of the ribosome 
binds to the ribosomal binding site on the mRNA. Then, the aminoacyl 
tRNA that carries methionine binds by its anticodon to the start codon. 
Finally, the large subunit of the ribosome binds to the small subunit and 
mRNA. At the end of initiation, the ribosome is complete, and the first 
tRNA is positioned in the P site of the ribosome. The second codon in 
the mRNA is positioned in the A site of the ribosome.

280
Part V: Molecular Genetics: Reading the Book of Life 
 
✓ Elongation of translation occurs as amino acids are brought together 
and joined to form a polypeptide chain. Elongation has several steps, 
which repeat until the polypeptide chain is complete:
 
a. An aminoacyl tRNA enters the A site of the ribosome. The tRNA that 
enters the A site has the complementary anticodon to the codon in 
the A site. As the two tRNA molecules are side by side in the P and 
A sites of the ribosome, their amino acids are next to each other.
 
b. The ribosome catalyzes bond formation between the two adjacent 
amino acids. The amino acid carried by the tRNA in the P site is 
attached to the amino acid carried by the tRNA in the A site. The 
growing protein chain is temporarily held by the tRNA in the A site.
 
c. The ribosome and mRNA slide relative to each other. You can 
think of this step, called translocation, like the movement of fabric 
through a sewing machine. The tRNA that was in the P site is 
pushed into the E site, whereas the tRNA that was in the A site is 
pushed into the P site. This places a new codon in the A site and 
the growing polypeptide chain in the P site. The tRNA in the E site 
exits the ribosome, and the A site is available for a new aminoacyl 
tRNA to enter, and the steps of elongation repeat.

✓ Termination of translation begins when a stop codon enters the A site 
of the ribosome. Stop codons aren’t recognized by aminoacyl tRNAs. 
Instead, the stop codon is recognized by an enzyme called release factor. 
Release factor enters the ribosome and catalyzes the breaking of the 
bond between the growing polypeptide chain and the tRNA that holds it. 
Release factor releases the polypeptide chain from the ribosome so that 
it can go out into the cell and be converted into a finished protein.

The synthesis of a polypeptide is an endergonic process (see Chapter 10). 
Cells make translation energetically favorable by coupling translation with the 
hydrolysis of guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Just like ATP, GTP has three 
phosphate groups. The hydrolysis of the bonds between the phosphate 
groups is highly exergonic. When GTP hydrolysis is coupled with the forma-
tion of peptide bonds, the overall process is exergonic and will occur sponta-
neously in cells.
Don’t Drink and Drive: Mutation
The genetic information in DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then trans-
lated into protein. If the DNA code is changed, then RNA molecules will also 
change, which may lead to a change in proteins. If proteins are changed so 
that they can’t do their job for the cell, then cell function may be altered. 
For humans, changes in protein function can lead to disease. For example, 
cancer, hemophilia, Tay-Sachs, and cystic fibrosis are all human diseases 
that result from changes in the DNA. Changes in DNA are called mutations.
Everybody makes mistakes
DNA polymerase, the enzyme that copies DNA when cells are about to divide, 
is a darn good enzyme. It doesn’t make many mistakes (as compared to other 
enzymes that copy nucleic acids), and it proofreads its own work. Still, when 
all is said and done, DNA polymerase makes approximately one uncorrected 
mistake for every billion base pairs of DNA that it copies. Mutations that “just 
happen” because of the way the enzyme functions are called spontaneous 
mutations.
DNA polymerase’s mutation rate of one error for every billion base pairs 
copied does sound pretty good, doesn’t it? There’s just one problem — cells 
can have a lot of DNA. You, for example, have about 3 billion base pairs of 
DNA in every one of your cells. That means that every time one of your cells 
divides, and DNA polymerase copies the DNA, the resulting cells will have 
about six mutations. When you remember that your DNA is really valuable to 
your health, the picture begins to look a little more scary.
In addition, certain chemicals and types of radiation in the environment 
of the cell can increase the mutation rate of DNA polymerase. Agents that 
increase the mutation rate are called mutagens. Mutations that result from 
the action of mutagens are called induced mutations. If cells are exposed 
to mutagens, they will accumulate more mutations than normal, which 
increases the chances that cell function will be altered. In humans, higher 
rates of disease often follow exposure to environmental mutagens. For 

283
 Chapter 18: Transcription and Translation: What’s in a Gene?
example, Japanese people who survived the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima 
and Nagasaki during World War II got cancer ten times more frequently than 
other Japanese people.
Dealing with the consequences
DNA polymerase makes mistakes all the time, yet cells continue to function 
just fine. So although the idea of mutation is scary, cells seem to be able to 
live with a certain level of it. One reason cells continue to function despite 
mutation is that not all mutations cause changes in proteins. Some mutations 
in DNA occur outside of genes. Even if a mutation does occur in a gene, the 
mutation may cause a change in mRNA that doesn’t affect the final protein. 
For example, if the codon AAA were changed to AAG, the amino acid would 
not change; both of these codons represent the amino acid lysine. Mutations 
like this one that don’t affect the final protein are called silent mutations.
Several other types of mutation, however, do affect proteins:
 
✓ Missense mutations result in changes in the amino acids of a protein. A 
single base pair change in the DNA can result in a missense mutation. 
For example, if an mRNA codon were changed from AAA to AGA, the 
amino acid would change from lysine to arginine. The effect of missense 
mutations on the protein depends on the differences between the amino 
acids and where in the protein the replacement occurs.
 
✓ Nonsense mutations occur when a stop codon is introduced into mRNA. 
For example, the codon UGG represents the amino acid tryptophan. If a 
mutation occurred to change UGG to UGA, then the protein would stop 
early. Nonsense mutations typically have severe consequences for 
protein function.
 
✓ Frameshift mutations cause the reading frame of the mRNA to be 
altered. For example, if DNA polymerase slips while copying the DNA, 
it may copy one nucleotide twice, which would cause an insertion of an 
extra nucleotide into the mRNA. All the codons after the insertion point 
would be off by one, and the resulting protein would be completely dif-
ferent from the original plan.
 
 Deletions of nucleotides can also cause frameshift mutations. Because 
frameshift mutations cause extensive missense, they typically have 
severe consequences for the protein.

One gene, one enzyme
Have you ever noticed the warning “Attention 
phenylketonurics, this product contains pheny-
lalanine” on products that contain the artificial 
sweetener aspartame (Nutrasweet)? Did you 
ever wonder why this warning appeared?
The warning is there because of a mutation. 
Some people are born with mutations in the 
gene for the enzyme that converts the amino 
acid phenylalanine into the amino acid tyrosine. 
This mutation may not sound like a big deal, 
but it is. If you’re born with this mutation and 
consume foods with phenylalanine in them, the 
phenylalanine will build up in your system. The 
accumulation of phenylalanine causes progres-
sive mental deterioration and seizures. In fact, 
before this disorder was understood, affected 
babies would be born normal and then pro-
gressively decline and die. If you have children, 
you probably remember that your babies’ heels 
were pricked at birth. Babies’ blood is tested 
right away to make sure that the enzyme levels 
are normal and that the babies are free from 
phenylketonuria.
In 1908, a British doctor named Archibald Garrod 
made observations of some of his patients who 
were affected by a disorder very similar to phe-
nylketonuria. Based on his observations, he 
concluded that some people were born with 
“inborn errors of metabolism.” Scientists now 
know that these “inborn errors” are mutations 
in the genes for proteins like enzymes.

Control of Gene Expression: 
It’s How You Play Your 
Cards That Counts
In This Chapter
▶ Studying gene regulation in bacteria
▶ Finding the connection between gene regulation and cell differentiation
▶ Exploring opportunities for gene regulation in eukaryotes
G
enes are expressed when cells use the blueprint in the gene to build 
a particular worker molecule in the cell. At any given time, cells use 
only a fraction of the genes in their genome. Powerful changes in a cell occur 
through control of which genes are turned on and off in a cell. In this chapter, 
I cover both the importance of gene regulation and also how cells control the 
expression of their genes.
Controlling the Situation: Gene 
Regulation and Information Flow
Gene regulation is about cells choosing which genes to use and which not 
to use. Most types of cells have a complete set of genes, yet cells use only a 
fraction of those genes at any given moment. Cells may change what genes 
they’re using depending on signals or changes in the environment. The infor-
mation in genes is copied into RNA and then proteins, so when cells change 
which genes they’re using, it affects which RNA molecules and proteins are 
available in the cell.

286
Part V: Molecular Genetics: Reading the Book of Life 
For example, some bacteria can make a very long lived resting structure 
called an endospore. Endospores let these bacteria go into hibernation if con-
ditions are bad and then come out of hibernation when conditions get better. 
Bacteria need the proteins to make endospores only if conditions get bad, 
so it would be a waste of energy if they made them all the time. So, most of 
the time, the bacteria doesn’t use the genes for endospore-making proteins. 
Then, when conditions get bad, the bacteria access the information in the 
genes needed to make endospores.
Scientists use the following terms to describe gene regulation:
 
✓ Genes are expressed when cells are using the information in the gene 
to build a molecule called the gene product (usually a protein but could 
also be RNA). Another way to say that a gene is being expressed is to 
say that the gene is on.
 
✓ Genes aren’t expressed when cells aren’t using the information in the 
gene. The gene product isn’t present in the cell, and the gene is off.
Becoming a specialist
Gene regulation is important when cells become specialized for certain tasks. 
Take you, for example. You started as a single cell that divided by mitosis 
(see Chapter 13) to give rise to the trillions of cells in your body. As the cells 
divided, they made copies of your DNA so that every cell got a complete 
copy. Your original single cell was a stem cell that had the ability to become 
any type of cell. However, as it divided by mitosis, its descendants were 
given signals to become specialists in certain tasks. For example, some of 
your cells became skin cells that protect you from invading microorganisms, 
or they became heart cells that contract to keep your blood flowing.
 
Once cells become specialists, they normally don’t change jobs or become 
stem cells again.
Cells that are specialists are differentiated or programmed for a certain task. 
Cells become differentiated as they turn on certain genes and turn off others. 
Each type of differentiated cell in your body requires unique tools in order 
to do its job. So, differentiated cells build the correct tools, or proteins, that 
they need.
For example, skin cells build lots of a strong protein called keratin that helps 
toughen up your outer layer. Heart cells make the proteins actin and myosin 
so that they can contract. The blueprints for keratin, actin, and myosin are 
located in different genes. Skin cells and heart cells would waste energy and 
resources if they made every protein they could all the time, so instead, 

287
 Chapter 19: Control of Gene Expression
these differentiated cells use just the genes they need. You can think of a 
skin cell and a heart cell as both having the same set of files, but in skin cells, 
certain drawers of the cabinet are locked while others are open. Heart cells 
have a different pattern of locked and open drawers. Each cell type becomes 
different because it expresses a different set of genes. In other words, cell dif-
ferentiation is achieved through differential gene expression.
 
Cells that are differentiated are specialized for certain functions. Differentiated 
cells have access only to the genes they need to survive and do their job for 
the organism.
Keeping house
Some proteins are essential to the survival of the cell in any conditions. For 
example, proteins needed for basic metabolism like the enzymes that cata-
lyze reactions during glycolysis (see Chapter 11) are needed so that cells can 
transfer energy from food to ATP. Also, cells always need enzymes such as 
RNA polymerase so that cells can make proteins. Without the enzymes for 
glycolysis or RNA polymerase, cells wouldn’t have the ATP and proteins they 
need to do anything.
Everything old is new again
Stem cells are unique because they have the 
ability to become any type of cell. In other 
words, they can access any of the genetic files 
in the cells genomic file cabinet. Stem cells are 
important to doctors and scientists who hope 
to be able to figure out how to use them to heal 
people.
For example, someone who has diabetes 
because his pancreas can’t make insulin may 
be healed if stem cells can be transplanted into 
his pancreas and triggered to become new, 
functioning pancreatic cells. Or someone who 
has a paralyzing spinal cord injury may be able 
to walk again if stem cells can be persuaded 
to grow into new nervous tissue in the injured 
person’s spine.
By studying stem cells and comparing them to 
differentiated cells, scientists hope to discover 
how to control the switch from stem cell to 
differentiated cell and back again. Apparently, 
two major events happen as a stem cell becomes 
a differentiated cell. First, certain genes that let 
the cell access all the genetic files are turned 
off. Second, another set of genes that are spe-
cific to the function of the differentiated cell are 
turned on. So, as cells differentiate, they lose 
access to some genetic files and activate the 
genes for their new function.
One roadblock to making differentiated cells 
go backward and become stem cells again has 
been regaining the lost access to all the genetic 
information of the cell. Recently, scientists dis-
covered that a single gene, called G9a, controls 
the switch that restricts access to genetic infor-
mation. With this knowledge, scientists may 
soon be able to figure out how to reverse the 
effects of G9a and regenerate stem cells from 
differentiated cells.

The genes for these essential housekeeping proteins are typically in use all the 
time in most cells. Other genes, for proteins involved in special functions, are 
turned on and off as needed. Thus, cells have two types of genes based on 
gene expression:
 
✓ Constitutive genes are genes that are expressed all the time. These 
genes contain the blueprints for proteins that do essential housekeeping 
functions for the cell.
 
✓ Regulated genes are turned on and off as they’re needed by the cell. 
Regulated genes contain the blueprints for proteins that are needed by 
the cell in some situations but not others.
I Can Be Flexible: Gene 
Expression in Bacteria
Scientists first discovered the basic principles of gene regulation by studying 
how gene expression works in bacteria. Bacteria regulate their gene expres-
sion in order to respond to an ever-changing environment. For example, 
the availability of food and water changes constantly, and bacteria must be 
able to take advantage of their current situation in order to survive. Bacteria 
respond to environmental changes by turning on genes for proteins that 
will help them survive. Genes are turned on and off by DNA-binding proteins 
that bind to DNA and control transcription. (For more on transcription, see 
Chapter 18.)
The basic steps of gene regulation in bacteria are as follows:
 
1. The cell receives an environmental signal.
 
2. The environmental signal either activates or inactivates a DNA-
binding protein.
 
3. DNA-binding proteins either bind to or let go of regulatory sequences 
in the DNA.
 
4. Transcription is turned on or off by the DNA-binding proteins.
Organizing bacterial genes
 
Bacteria organize multiple genes under the control of one promoter. The set of 
genes plus promoter is called an operon.

289
 Chapter 19: Control of Gene Expression
Typically, the genes in one operon contain the blueprints for proteins that 
work together in a single process. That way, transcription and translation of 
the operon make all the proteins needed for the process at the same time.
Following are the important elements of a bacterial operon:
 
✓ The promoter marks the beginning of the operon. RNA polymerase 
binds to the operator to begin transcription.
 
✓ Structural genes are genes for proteins within the operon. One operon 
contains several structural genes.
 
✓ The operator is a regulatory sequence of DNA located between the pro-
moter and the structural genes. DNA-binding proteins bind to the opera-
tor to control transcription of the operon.
Taking E. coli to dinner
Escherichia coli, better known as E. coli, is best known to most people as the 
bringer of gastrointestinal distress. However, your view of E. coli is probably 
skewed from the bad rap the bacterium gets in the news media. Basically, a 
few strains of E. coli run around causing very dangerous diseases and give 
the whole species a bad name. Many nicer strains of E. coli exist, some of 
them happily living in your small intestines right now. Others are excellent 
bacterial lab rats, helping scientists learn about cells and how they function. 
In particular, scientists have discovered a lot about the structure and func-
tion of DNA, including gene regulation, from studying E. coli.
Like you, E. coli uses enzymes to break down food molecules. E. coli has 
hundreds of genes for all the different enzymes it makes. Some genes are con-
stitutively expressed. In other words, E. coli makes them all the time. Other 
genes are regulated — E. coli turns them on when it needs them and turns 
them off when it doesn’t. For example, the sugar glucose is usually avail-
able to E. coli, so E. coli always makes the enzymes it needs to break down 
glucose. Other food sources are more unpredictable, so E. coli turns on the 
enzymes to break down these food sources only when they become available.
Looking at lac
Lactose, the sugar found in milk, is occasionally available to E. coli. The genes 
for the enzymes to break down lactose are located within the lactose operon, 
or lac operon (see Figure 19-1). The lac operon has three components:

290
Part V: Molecular Genetics: Reading the Book of Life 
 
✓ The lac promoter is the binding site for RNA polymerase.
 
✓ The lac operator is the binding site for a DNA-binding protein called the 
lac repressor protein.
 
✓ Three structural genes contain the blueprints for the two proteins 
needed to breakdown lactose plus a blueprint for a protective enzyme.
 
• The lacZ gene is the blueprint for the enzyme beta-galactosidase 
(β-galactosidase). Beta-galactosidase catalyzes the splitting of the 
disaccharide lactose into two monosaccharides, glucose and galac-
tose, and then glycolysis breaks it down (see Chapter 11).
 
• The lacY gene is the blueprint for the membrane protein galactosi-
dase permease, which brings lactose into the cell.
 
• The lacA gene is the blueprint for transacetylase, a protective 
enzyme that allows certain sugars to be removed from the cell 
when the sugars are too plentiful.

 Chapter 19: Control of Gene Expression
Feeling repressed
The DNA-binding protein that controls transcription of the lac operon is 
called the lac repressor protein.
 
The lac repressor is a DNA-binding protein that regulates the lac operon. 
When the lac repressor is active, it binds to the operator, and transcription is 
blocked.
The lac repressor has two binding sites that are critical to its function:
 
✓ A DNA-binding site that binds to the operator sequence of the lac 
operon
 
✓ An allosteric site that binds to an isomer of lactose (called allolactose)
The allosteric site of the lac repressor controls its activity. When the allos-
teric site is empty, the lac repressor is active. When lactose is available, an 
isomer of lactose binds to the allosteric site, inactivating the lac repressor. 
The operator of the lac operon is right next to the promoter, so when the lac 
repressor is active, it gets in the way of RNA polymerase. If RNA polymerase 
can’t bind to the promoter, then transcription can’t occur.
The blueprint for the lac repressor is contained in the I gene, which isn’t part 
of the lac operon. The I gene is constitutively expressed, so the lac repressor 
is always available in the cell. When the lac repressor is active, it shuts down 
the lac operon. Because the active repressor shuts down the operon, regula-
tion of the lac operon by the lac repressor is called negative control.
Game on: Inducing the lac operon
Lactose is the inducer of the lac operon: When lactose is available, it turns 
the lac operon on so that E. coli can make the enzymes needed to break down 
lactose.
 
Lactose regulates the lac operon by induction.
Induction, or turning on, of the lac operon allows E. coli to use the lactose as 
a food source, which makes sense if you think about things from the perspec-
tive of E. coli; when lactose is available, E. coli “wants” to eat it.

292
Part V: Molecular Genetics: Reading the Book of Life 
The tricky part about understanding gene regulation is to think about how 
lactose turns on the lac operon. After all, E. coli can’t really think about what 
it wants; it’s only a bacterium after all, so how does it “know” when lactose 
is available? The answer is the lac repressor. When lactose is available, an 
isomer of lactose (allolactose) binds to the lac repressor and inactivates it. 
The lac repressor lets go of the operator, and RNA polymerase can bind to 
the promoter (Figure 19-1). Transcription of the lac operon can occur and the 
enzymes to break down lactose are made.
Game over: Repressing the lac operon
The beauty of the regulation of the lac operon is its efficiency: when lactose 
is available, lactose turns on the lac operon. E. coli makes the enzymes to 
break down lactose and uses the lactose as a food source. As E. coli uses up 
the lactose, the allolactose isn’t available to bind to the repressor protein. 
The repressor protein becomes active again, and binds to the operator. 
So, when the lactose is gone, the lac operon is turned off again. Again, this 
process makes sense from the perspective of E. coli — if it doesn’t have any 
lactose, why make the enzymes to break it down? The tricky part is remem-
bering how this process works: No lactose means no isomer (allolactose) 
bound to the allosteric site of the lac repressor, which means that the repres-
sor protein binds to the operator and blocks transcription.
 
To help you remember the regulation of the lac operon, think like E. coli. If lac-
tose is available, would you want to make the enzymes to break it down? Of 
course! So, when lactose is available, the lac operon is on. If lactose isn’t avail-
able, do you want to make the enzymes to break it down? Why bother? So, 
when lactose isn’t available, the lac operon is off.
Advancing to the next level: Catabolite 
repression of the lac operon
Lactose isn’t the only sugar that has an effect on the regulation of the 
lac operon; glucose is a player in the game, too. E. coli always makes the 
enzymes to break down glucose so that the bacterium is always ready to use 
glucose when glucose is available. In fact, if glucose is available, E. coli won’t 
even bother making the effort to break down other sugars like lactose. How 
can a simple bacterium make these kinds of choices? The answer is through 
the regulatory DNA-binding protein catabolite activator protein (CAP), which 
responds to the levels of glucose available to the cell.
CAP is an activator protein, which means it turns on transcription of genes 
(as compared to repressor proteins that turn off transcription).

293
 Chapter 19: Control of Gene Expression
 
When CAP is active, it turns on transcription of catabolic operons like the lac 
operon that produce enzymes to break down different food sources (other 
than glucose).
 
✓ When glucose is available, CAP is inactive, so E. coli doesn’t make new 
enzymes and doesn’t bother breaking down food molecules other than 
glucose.
 
✓ When glucose runs out, CAP becomes active and turns on catabolic 
operons, which allows E. coli to make enzymes for food sources other 
than glucose.
Reguation by CAP makes sense from the perspective of E. coli; E. coli always 
makes the enzymes to break down glucose, so if glucose is available the 
bacterium just eats the glucose. If glucose runs out, E. coli needs to find new 
food sources, so CAP turns on catabolic operons that produce enzymes for 
other food sources. That way, E. coli won’t run out of food.
The details of how CAP responds to the presence of glucose are a bit com-
plicated, but very similar to the workings of the lac repressor protein (see 
the preceding section “Feeling repressed”). Like the lac repressor, CAP is an 
allosteric protein with two important binding sites:
 
✓ A DNA-binding site that binds to a regulatory sequence of DNA called the 
CAP-binding site. The CAP-binding site is a sequence of DNA next to the 
promoters of catabolic operons. When CAP binds to the CAP-binding 
sites in the DNA, it enhances transcription of the adjacent operons.
 
✓ An allosteric site that binds to a signaling molecule named cyclic AMP 
(cAMP). When cAMP is bound to CAP, CAP is active. When cAMP isn’t 
bound to CAP, CAP is inactive. In other words, CAP needs cAMP in order 
to function. (Just like I need a cup of tea in the morning!)
CAP and cAMP function as a team to monitor and respond to the presence of 
glucose. The amount of cAMP in the cell changes as the amount of glucose 
changes:
 
✓ When glucose levels are high, cAMP levels are low.
 
✓ When glucose levels are low, cAMP levels are high.
 
You can think of cAMP like an alarm signal. When glucose runs out, more 
cAMP molecules run around the cell saying, “Oh no! We’re running out of 
food!” The cAMP molecules bind to CAP and activate it. Together, cAMP and 
CAP bind to the CAP binding site near the promoters of catabolic operons and 
turn them on, so E. coli makes enzymes to break down other food molecules 
besides glucose.

294
Part V: Molecular Genetics: Reading the Book of Life 
 
The levels of cAMP change as glucose levels change because glucose acts as a 
regulator of the enzyme adenylate cyclase, which makes cAMP out of ATP. 
When glucose is available, it binds to an allosteric site on adenylate cyclase 
and inactivates the enzyme so that no cAMP is made. When glucose isn’t avail-
able, it can’t bind to adenylate cyclase. Adenylate cyclase is active and pro-
duces cAMP from ATP.
To fully understand the regulation of the lac operon, you have to put the two 
regulatory systems together: negative control by the lac repressor combined 
with positive control by CAP. Remember that these two systems are indepen-
dent of each other:
 
✓ Lactose is the environmental signal that interacts with the lac repressor.
 
✓ Glucose is the environmental signal that interacts with CAP.
So, when you think about the regulation of the lac operon, consider these 
two systems separately. You can think of lactose as the on/off switch for the 
lac operon. When lactose is present, the operon is turned on. When lactose 
is absent, the operon is turned off. Glucose acts as volume control. When glu-
cose is present, the volume of transcription on catabolic operons, including 
the lac operon, is very low. When glucose is absent, the volume of transcrip-
tion of the lac operon gets cranked way up. The combined effects of these 
two systems determine the level of transcription of the lac operon:
 
✓ If glucose is present and lactose is absent, the volume is low, and the 
switch is off. No transcription of the lac operon occurs.
 
✓ If glucose and lactose are present, the volume is low, and the switch is 
on. Very low levels of transcription of the lac operon occur.
 
✓ If glucose is absent and lactose is present, the volume is high, and the 
switch is on. Very high levels of transcription of the lac operon occur.
 
The hardest part of understanding gene regulation is getting the details 
straight on which molecules bind where and understanding their effects. The 
best strategy I’ve found for learning these details is to practice drawing the 
regulation of the lac operon in different conditions (different sugars available). 
In other words, practice re-creating Figure 19-1 for yourself on a blank piece of 
paper. Draw the lac operon and then say to yourself, “If lactose is present, 
what is the effect?” Draw all the regulatory molecules onto the lac operon, 
describing what is happening out loud. Repeat your drawings for all the condi-
tions shown in Figure 19-1. The combination of drawing, seeing, and hearing 
will help reinforce the information. Practice until you can re-create Figure 19-1 
with ease, narrating as you go.

 Chapter 19: Control of Gene Expression
The Master Plan: Gene Expression 
in Eukaryotes
The regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes is more complicated than 
the regulation of gene expression in bacteria. However, the regulation of gene 
expression in eukaryotes and bacteria have some similarities:
 
✓ Gene regulation at the level of transcription, called transcriptional 
control, occurs in both bacteria and eukaryotes. Regulation of the lac 
operon in E. coli is an example of transcriptional control in bacteria. In 
eukaryotes, other types of gene regulation occur, but transcriptional 
control is the most common mechanism.
 
✓ DNA-binding proteins regulate the activity of genes by binding to regula-
tory sequences in the DNA. Repressor proteins and CAP are both exam-
ples of important regulatory proteins in bacteria. In eukaryotes, many 
different types of regulatory proteins interact with each other and bind 
to regulatory sequences in the DNA to control transcription.
Seizing the opportunity
The pathway from gene to protein is more complex in eukaryotes than the 
pathway is in bacteria (see Chapter 18), which creates many more opportu-
nities for regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. Genes are expressed 
when their gene product is present in the cell, so any step in the pathway 
from gene to protein represents an opportunity for control. In eukaryotes, 
the major opportunities for control are as follows (see Figure 19-2):
 
✓ Access to genes is affected by the compaction of DNA into chromosomes.
 
✓ Transcriptional control regulates whether RNA polymerase binds to pro-
moters and transcribes the DNA.
 
✓ Control of RNA processing determines whether the pre-mRNA is con-
verted into a finished mRNA molecule.
 
✓ Control of mRNA stability determines how long mRNA remains in the 
cell available to be translated.
 
✓ Translational control regulates whether mRNA is translated into protein.
 
✓ Control of protein modification determines whether the polypeptide 
made by translation is modified into a fully functional protein.

Unpacking the plan
Cells contain a lot of DNA, much more than would fit inside the cell if the 
cells didn’t do a little creative packaging. For example, if you took the DNA 
out of just one of your cells and laid all the DNA molecules (each of your 46 
chromosomes) end to end, the DNA molecule would be about 2 to 3 meters 
long. That’s about 6 feet in length, which may even be taller than your height! 
Of course, the string of DNA molecules would be extremely thin, so thin that 
you couldn’t even see it with your naked eyes. Still, that’s a long piece of DNA 
to pack into each and every cell.
 
Eukaryotic cells solve the DNA packing problem by packaging the DNA into 
chromatin. Chromatin is a complex of DNA wound around proteins.
To package the DNA into chromatin, cells do the following process, shown in 
Figure 19-3:
 
1. The DNA molecules are wound around positively charged proteins 
called histones that gather together in groups of eight proteins.
 
 The negatively charged DNA is attracted to the positively charged his-
tones. When the DNA is wrapped around these clusters of histones, it 
looks like beads on a string. The beads of DNA plus histones are called 
nucleosomes.

297
 Chapter 19: Control of Gene Expression
 
2. The string of nucleosomes and DNA twist until they form coiled fibers 
that are 30 nanometers wide.
 
 These fibers are called 30-nanometer fibers.
 
3. Continued twisting of the DNA and protein fibers packs the DNA even 
more tightly until the DNA is very condensed.
 
 To imagine how this compaction works, take a rubber band and 
keep twisting it in one direction until it beings to form knots. In its 
most condensed form, which occurs during mitosis and meiosis, 
DNA becomes visible under the microscope as chromosomes. (See 
Chapters 13 and 14 for more on mitosis and meiosis, respectively.)
 
Figure 19-3: 
Compaction 
of DNA.
 
Histone

Nucleosome
Gene expression is blocked by the condensation of DNA. When the DNA is 
tightly coiled up, regulatory proteins and RNA polymerase just can’t get 
access to the genes. Before transcription of a gene can occur, the chromatin 
around the gene must be decondensed. One control of chromatin condensa-
tion is through proteins called histone acetyl transferases (HATs). HAT pro-
teins attach acetyl groups to histone proteins, which neutralize their positive 
charge. When the histones lose their positive charge, DNA is less attracted to 
them, and the bond between DNA and histones is weakened. When the bonds 
within nucleosomes loosen, the DNA decondenses.
Controlling transcription
Transcription in eukaryotes is controlled by DNA-binding proteins, called 
regulatory proteins, which bind to regulatory sequences of DNA located near 
promoters. Regulation by DNA-binding proteins is the same fundamental 
mechanism for transcriptional control in bacteria. However, the types of reg-
ulatory proteins and regulatory sequences are more diverse in eukaryotes.

298
Part V: Molecular Genetics: Reading the Book of Life 
Several important regulatory sequences regulate gene expression in 
eukaryotic cells:
 
✓ Promoter proximal elements are regulatory sequences located very 
close to promoters. When regulatory proteins bind to promoter proxi-
mal elements, transcription is turned on. The exact sequence of pro-
moter proximal elements is unique for each gene so that eukaryotic cells 
can identify which genes they’re turning on.
 
✓ Enhancers are regulatory sequences that are located far away from the 
genes they regulate. When regulatory proteins bind to enhancers, tran-
scription is turned on.
 
✓ Silencers are regulatory sequences that are located far away from the 
genes they regulate. When regulatory proteins bind to silencers, tran-
scription is blocked.
Groups of regulatory proteins interact with each other and regulatory 
sequences in order to control the binding of RNA polymerase to promoters. 
The regulatory proteins that bind to regulatory sequences in order to turn on 
transcription are called transcription factors. Two types of transcription fac-
tors control transcription in eukaryotic cells:
 
✓ General transcription factors, also called basal transcription factors, 
are required for transcription of any gene in all cell types. They are part 
of the transcription initiation complex, a group of proteins that work 
together to attract RNA polymerase and help it bind to promoters.
 
✓ Regulatory transcription factors are more targeted than basal transcrip-
tion factors. Regulatory transcription factors bind to the regulatory 
sequences of specific genes in order to turn them on or off. In other 
words, regulatory transcription factors are the regulatory proteins that 
control which genes in eukaryotes are being expressed. For example, the 
regulatory transcription factors in a skin cell would be different from the 
ones in the muscle cell. In a skin cell, the regulatory transcription fac-
tors would turn on the genes for tools needed for the skin cell function, 
like the protein keratin. In a muscle cell, the regulatory transcription fac-
tors would turn on the genes for tools needed muscle cell function, such 
as the proteins actin and myosin.
In addition to transcription factors, proteins called coactivators also play a 
role in the initiation of transcription. Coactivators bind to general and regula-
tory transcription factors, bringing them together to form the transcription 
initiation complex (see Figure 19-4). Transcription factors and coactivators 
work together to initiate transcription:

299
 Chapter 19: Control of Gene Expression
 
1. Regulatory transcription factors bind to enhancers for the gene to be 
transcribed.
 
2. Regulatory transcription factors gather coactivators and general tran-
scription factors together.
 
 The proteins bind to each other and the promoter for the gene to be 
transcribed.
 
3. RNA polymerase binds to the gathered proteins, completing the tran-
scription initiation complex.
 
4. Transcription begins.

Transcription factors bind to regulatory sequences in order to control gene 
expression in eukaryotes. To turn genes on, transcription factors bind to pro-
moter proximal sequences and enhancers. To turn genes off, transcription fac-
tors bind to silencers. Regulatory transcription factors are unique to different 
cell types and turn on the genes that cause cell differentiation.

Part V: Molecular Genetics: Reading the Book of Life 
Controlling events between transcription 
and translation
Two opportunities exist for regulation of gene expression between transcrip-
tion and translation. Control of mRNA processing (see Chapter 18) can affect 
the conversion of a pre-mRNA into a finished mRNA molecule. Also, the cel-
lular lifespan of an mRNA determines how many times it can be translated 
before the mRNA is broken down by the cell, thus affecting the amount of 
gene product in the cell.
The mechanisms for controlling mRNA processing and stability are as follows:
 
✓ mRNA processing is regulated by proteins that interact with the spli-
ceosomes. These proteins can affect the way a pre-mRNA is spliced to 
become a finished mRNA. For example, these proteins can determine 
which introns are removed from the pre-mRNA. Through alternative 
splicing, spliceosomes can splice one type of pre-mRNA different ways, 
leading to several different finished mRNAs. The differences in the 
mRNAs leads to differences in the proteins. Thus, alternative splicing 
produces several different gene products from one original pre-mRNA.
 
✓ The lifespan of an mRNA in the cell, or mRNA stability, is controlled 
by RNA interference. Small RNA molecules, called microRNA (miRNA), 
bind to complementary sequences on mRNA molecules, marking them 
for destruction by the cell. The release of miRNA molecules from the 
nucleus controls the timing of destruction of specific mRNAs.
The real difference between men and women
Men are from Mars, and women are from Venus, 
right? Well, at least according to author John 
Gray. But it turns out that to get from Venus to 
Mars all you need is one gene that codes for a 
single transcription factor.
In terms of DNA, men and women are almost 
identical. In fact, women have all the genes 
they need to become men scattered among 
their 46 chromosomes — all the genes except 
one, that is. Located on the Y chromosome is a 
single gene, SRY, which contains the blueprint 
for a transcription factor called testes deter-
mining factor (tdf).
Human fetuses are identical until about 
six weeks of life when transcription of SRY 
produces testes determining factor. TDF binds 
near the promoters of the genes necessary 
for the formation of testes and activates these 
genes. Testes are formed, which produce tes-
tosterone, which signals more “male” genes to 
turn on and voilà — a boy baby is born!
In female fetuses, there is no SRY gene, so 
although all the other necessary male genes are 
present, they never get turned on. The default 
developmental pathway is to become female, 
but all it takes is one very powerful transcription 
factor to travel from Venus to Mars!

301
 Chapter 19: Control of Gene Expression
Controlling translation and beyond
Eukaryotic cells often control gene expression by regulating translation. A 
cell can use several mechanisms to block translation of an mRNA:
 
✓ Regulatory proteins can bind to mRNA, blocking their translation.
 
✓ The cell may modify the 5' cap or poly-A tail of the mRNA in order to 
block translation.
 
✓ The addition of a phosphate group to a protein in the ribosome, called 
phosphorylation, may stop or slow translation.
Prevention of translation of an mRNA prevents the gene product from being 
made, blocking expression of the gene from which the mRNA was made.
Once translation occurs, the protein is available in the cell. However, cells 
can still control the effect of that protein by regulating its activity. Enzymes 
are commonly regulated by competitive and noncompetitive inhibition 
(see Chapter 6). The activity of other proteins, particularly those involved 
in signaling pathways, are often controlled by the addition or removal of a 
phosphate group. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are particularly 
important in signal transduction pathways (see Chapter 9).

DNA, how it governs cells, and the effects of changes to

can be read. Tools like these are greatly enhancing scien-
tists’ understanding of life on Earth and the ability to

Scientists now have the ability to study not just pieces of 
DNA but the entire genome of an organism. In this part, I

ecombinant DNA technology enables scientists to study and experiment 
with DNA. Scientists copy genes, read their sequences, and introduce 
them into new cells. Scientists are using powerful techniques that act at the 
molecular level to engineer crop plants and diagnose and treat diseases. In 
this chapter, I explain the basics of the techniques used to work with DNA 
and introduce some possible applications to solve today’s problems.
Piecing It Together: Recombinant 
DNA Technology
DNA is so small that you can barely see it with an electron microscope — and 
yet, people have figured out how to read it, copy it, cut it into pieces, sort 
it, and put it back together in new combinations. When DNA from two dif-
ferent sources is combined together, the patchwork DNA molecule is called 
recombinant DNA. For example, scientists have combined human genes and 
DNA from E. coli and then placed the recombinant DNA into E. coli so that the 
bacterium makes human proteins. Doctors can use these proteins, such as 
insulin, to treat human diseases. The tools that let scientists manipulate DNA 
in these amazing ways are called recombinant DNA technology.

306
Part VI: Tools of Molecular Biology: Harnessing the Power of DNA 
Cutting DNA with restriction enzymes
Bacteria make enzymes called restriction endonucleases, or more commonly, 
restriction enzymes, that cut strands of DNA into smaller pieces (see Figure 
20-1). Bacteria use restriction enzymes to fight off attacking viruses, chop-
ping up the viral DNA so that the virus can’t destroy the bacterial cell. 
Scientists use restriction enzymes in the lab to cut DNA into smaller pieces 
so that they can analyze and manipulate DNA more easily.
 
Each restriction enzyme recognizes and cuts DNA at a specific sequence 
called a restriction site. 
 
Figure 20-1: 
Restriction

Sticky ends
The restriction enzyme called EcoR1 cuts DNA at the sequence 5'GAATTC3'. If 
you mix DNA and a restriction enzyme, the enzyme will find all the restriction 
sites it recognizes and cut the DNA at those locations.
Restriction enzymes make cutting and combining pieces of DNA easy. For 
example, if you wanted to put a human gene into a bacterial plasmid, you’d 
follow these steps:
 
1. Choose a restriction enzymes that forms sticky ends when it cuts DNA.
 
 Sticky ends are pieces of single-stranded DNA that are complementary 
and can form hydrogen bonds. Restriction enzymes that form sticky 
ends cut the DNA backbone asymmetrically so that a piece of single-
stranded DNA hangs off each end. For example, the sticky ends shown 
in Figure 20-1 have the sequences 5'AATT3' and 3'TTAA5'. A and T are 
complementary base pairs, so these ends could form hydrogen bonds 
and thus stick to each other.
 
2. Cut the human DNA and bacterial plasmids with the restriction 
enzyme.
 
 If you cut a plasmid DNA and human DNA with the same restriction 
enzyme, all the DNA fragments will have the same sticky ends.

307
 Chapter 20: Recombinant DNA Technology: Power Tools at the Cellular Level
 
3. Combine human DNA and bacterial plasmids.
 
 The two types of DNA have the same sticky ends, so some pieces of plas-
mid DNA and human DNA will stick together. Thus, some plasmids will 
end up with a human gene inserted into the plasmid.
 
4. Use DNA ligase to seal the backbone of the DNA.
 
 DNA ligase will form covalent bonds at the cut sites in the DNA, sealing 
together any pieces of DNA that combined together.
Any plasmids that contain human DNA are recombinant. These plasmids 
could now be inserted into bacterial cells.
Sorting molecules using gel electrophoresis
 
Gel electrophoresis separates molecules based on their size and electrical 
charge. The “gel” part of gel electrophoresis is a slab of a gelatin-like sub-
stance made from polysaccharides. Molecules of different sizes are placed 
into pockets in the gel, and then electricity is used to move the molecules 
through the gel, as shown in Figure 20-2. The types of molecules most com-
monly separated by gel electrophoresis are DNA and proteins. Electrophoresis 
means to carry something using electricity, so in this case molecules are being 
carried through the gel:

phoresis.

Part VI: Tools of Molecular Biology: Harnessing the Power of DNA 
 
✓ Molecules are attracted to the electrode with opposite charge. 
Positively charged molecules will move through the gel toward the nega-
tively charged electrode, while negatively charged molecules will move 
through the gel toward the positively charged electrode.
 
✓ Small molecules can move more quickly through the gel than larger 
molecules, so molecules of different sizes will start to spread apart 
from each other in the gel. You can think of gel electrophoresis as a 
race of molecules through an obstacle course. The long fibers of the 
polysaccharide in the gel are the obstacles that the molecules must get 
through. When you turn on the electricity and run a current through 
your gel, the molecules begin the race. Smaller molecules can wiggle 
around the obstacles more easily, so they run faster in the race. When 
you turn off the electricity, the race is over, and all the molecules stop 
where they are. Bigger molecules will be closer to the starting line, and 
smaller molecules will be closer to the finish line.
Gel electrophoresis is often used to separate molecules of DNA (see Figure 20-3). 
Electricity pulls DNA through a gel because DNA is negatively charged due to 
its many phosphate groups. When an electrical current is run through a gel, 
the DNA molecules are attracted to the positive electrode.
 
The positive electrode is colored red on the electrophoresis chamber, so sci-
entists say that “DNA runs to the red.”

 Chapter 20: Recombinant DNA Technology: Power Tools at the Cellular Level
The steps for doing gel electrophoresis on DNA samples are very similar to the 
steps of other types of gel electrophoresis:
 
1. Pour the liquid gel and let it solidify.
 
 A spacer called a comb fits into a gel platform, which is sealed with tape. 
The comb creates little pockets called wells in the gel.
 
2. Place the gel into an electrophoresis chamber and fill the chamber 
with buffer.
 
 The buffer solution conducts electricity throughout the electrophoresis 
chamber.
 
3. Cut DNA samples with restriction enzymes and mix samples with load-
ing buffer.
 
 The restriction enzymes cut the DNA into pieces of different sizes. The 
loading buffer contains a dense molecule to help settle the DNA into the 
wells and also has marker dyes so that you can see the approximate 
position of your samples as they move through the gel.
 
4. Load the samples into the wells using a micropipettor.
 
 Micropipettors allow precise measurements of very small volumes. The 
DNA samples should sink to the bottom of the wells.
 
5. Seal the box and start the current.
 
 The electrical current will separate the DNA samples in the gel.
 
6. Stop the current and stain the gel.
 
 The stain will stick to the DNA in the gel, creating stripes called bands.
  
 Each band on a gel represents a collection of DNA molecules that are the 
same size and therefore stop in the same place.
Making cDNA with reverse transcriptase
Scientists use recombinant DNA technology to combine eukaryotic DNA with 
that of bacteria and then introduce eukaryotic genes into bacterial cells. 
However, bacteria can’t use eukaryotic genes to make proteins unless the 
introns are removed from the eukaryotic genes. Scientists get around this 
problem by creating intron-free eukaryotic genes in the form of complementary 
DNA (cDNA).
 
cDNA is made from eukaryotic mRNA that has already been spliced to remove 
the introns. (For more on this process, see Chapter 18.)

310
Part VI: Tools of Molecular Biology: Harnessing the Power of DNA 
Figure 20-4 shows the steps for making cDNA:
 
1. Isolate mRNA for the protein you’re interested in.
 
2. Use the enzyme reverse transcriptase to make a single-stranded DNA 
molecule that is complementary to the mRNA.
 
 Reverse transcriptase is a viral enzyme that uses RNA as a template to 
make DNA.
 
3. Use reverse transcriptase or DNA polymerase to make a partner strand 
for the DNA molecule, creating a finished double-stranded molecule of 
cDNA.

Cloning genes into a library
Scientists store the DNA they’re working with in DNA libraries, recombinant 
DNA molecules that contain the gene of interest. Once a gene is put into a DNA 
library, DNA cloning makes many identical copies of the gene. To clone a gene 
into a library, you first need to put the gene into a vector. A vector, such as a 
plasmid or virus, helps carry DNA into a cell. Figure 20-5 illustrates the process 
for introducing a gene into a vector and then cloning the gene into a library.
 
1. Using the same restriction enzyme, cut the vector and the DNA 
containing the gene to be cloned.
 
 That way, the vector and the DNA to be cloned will have the same 
sticky ends.
 
2. Mix the vector and DNA to be cloned together and add DNA ligase.
 
 Some vectors will pick up the genes to be cloned. DNA ligase will form 
covalent bonds, sealing the genes into the vectors. The vectors that pick 
up genes are recombinant.
 
3. Introduce the vector into a population of cells.
 
 The vector will be reproduced inside the cells. Once the vector is 
reproduced, the gene has been cloned.

Cloning a gene isn’t the same thing as cloning an organism. Cloning a gene 
means making many copies of a gene, while cloning an organism means 
making an organism that is identical to another one (like the sheep Dolly). So, 
when someone talks about cloning, make sure that you know which version 
they mean!
 
DNA libraries are recombinant vectors that store genes and keep them handy 
for scientists.
DNA libraries make it easier for scientists to work with DNA they’re interested 
in, such as DNA from a particular type of cell or organism. Scientists use 
several types of DNA libraries:
 
✓ DNA libraries contain fragments of DNA inserted into a vector.
 
✓ cDNA libraries contain fragments of cDNA inserted into vectors.
 
✓ Genomic libraries contain DNA fragments that represent the entire genome 
of an organism.
Finding a gene with DNA probes
 
Once genes are cloned into a library, scientists use DNA probes to find the vec-
tors that contain specific genes of interest. Probes are pieces of single-stranded 
DNA that are used to locate a particular DNA sequence (see Figure 20-6).
Probes are made with a sequence that’s complementary to the sequence 
you’re looking for. Using a probe is like going fishing — you use the right bait 
(a complementary sequence) to catch something you want (a certain gene). 
Probes will attach with hydrogen bonds to their complementary sequence. 
For example, if you were looking for a gene that contained the sequence 
5'TAGGCT3', you’d make a probe with the sequence 3'ATCCGA5'.
Probes are also labeled with a fluorescent or radioactive marker so that you 
can locate them in a DNA sample. To use a probe to locate DNA, complete the 
following steps:
 
1. Prepare a DNA sample to be probed for the gene of interest.
 
 You can look at DNA in many different forms — DNA in a gel, DNA 
attached to a microscope slide, and even DNA in colonies on a plate. 
To prepare any of these samples to be probed, you must treat the DNA 
with heat or chemicals to make it single-stranded and ready to pair with 
another strand of DNA.
 
2. Wash your DNA probe over the surface of your DNA sample.
 
 The probe will attach to its complementary sequence in the sample.

probes are located by using the treated DNA to expose photographic film.
Copying a gene with PCR
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is one of the most important techniques 
in molecular biology because it allows you to make many copies of a gene 
that you’re interested in. For example, you may need more copies of a gene in 
order to read its sequence, or you may be a forensic scientist that has only a 
few cells to work with to solve a crime. PCR makes this kind of work possible.
 
PCR can turn a single copy of a gene into more than a billion copies in just a few 
hours. Making many copies of a gene using PCR is called gene amplification.
 
PCR targets the gene to be copied with primers. Primers are single-stranded 
sequences of DNA that are complementary to sequences next to the gene to 
be copied (see Figure 20-7).

314
Part VI: Tools of Molecular Biology: Harnessing the Power of DNA 
DNA polymerase uses the primers to begin DNA replication, so it starts 
copying DNA next to the gene you want and then keeps going and copies the 
gene. To begin PCR, the DNA sample that contains the gene to be amplified is 
combined with thousands of copies of the primers. Then, this basic cycle of 
steps, shown in Figure 20-7, is repeated over and over:
 
1. Heat the sample for 1 minute to disrupt the hydrogen bonds in the 
DNA and make it single stranded.
 
 Temperatures around 95° C (203° F) are needed to “melt” the 
hydrogen bonds.
 
2. Cool the sample for 1 minute so that hydrogen bonds can reform.
 
 Because there is so much primer, primers will stick with hydrogen 
bonds to the single-stranded target DNA.
 
 Temperatures around 65° C (149° F) are cool enough for the primers to 
stick, or anneal, to the target DNA.
 
3. Heat the sample to the optimum temperature for the DNA polymerase 
for 1 minute.
 
 DNA polymerase will copy the target gene. The heat-stable enzyme, 
Taq polymerase, that is used for PCR works best at temperatures 
around 75° C (167° F).
By repeating the preceding steps just 30 times, one copy of a gene can be ampli-
fied into more than 1 billion copies. This multiplication works like compound 
interest — every time you make copies, the copies are copied, then those copies 
are copied, and so on. Using PCR, the DNA from just a single cell can provide 
enough DNA for scientists to work with in a very short amount of time.
Reading a gene with DNA sequencing
DNA sequencing determines the order of nucleotides in a DNA strand. DNA 
sequencing techniques use a special kind of nucleotide, called a dideoxy-
ribonucleotide triphosphate (ddNTP). Dideoxyribonucleotides are identical 
in structure to typical nucleotides (deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, or 
dNTPs) except that, instead of having a hydroxyl group attached to their 3' 
carbon, they just have a hydrogen atom (see Figure 20-8). This small change 
is very significant to DNA polymerase, which requires a 3' hydroxyl in order 
to add nucleotides to a growing chain of DN.A (See Chapter 17 for more on 
DNA replication.)

 Chapter 20: Recombinant DNA Technology: Power Tools at the Cellular Level
 
If DNA polymerase is copying DNA and a dideoxyribonucleotide becomes part 
of a growing chain, it will be the last nucleotide that gets added; DNA polymerase 
will not be able to add any more nucleotides. DNA sequencing uses this chain 
interruption to determine the order of nucleotides in a strand of DNA.

Most DNA sequencing today is cycle sequencing, which combines the original 
methods of DNA sequencing with the heating and cooling cycle of PCR. (See 
the section “Copying a gene with PCR,” earlier in this chapter, for more on 
this topic.) Like PCR, cycle sequencing uses primers that target the gene to 
be sequenced. In order to begin cycle sequencing, you’d combine the DNA to 

317
 Chapter 20: Recombinant DNA Technology: Power Tools at the Cellular Level
be sequenced, primers that target the DNA to be sequenced, Taq polymerase 
(a DNA polymerase), lots of typical nucleotides (dNTPs), and lots of dideoxy-
ribonucleotides (ddNTPs). Then, the basic cycle of PCR is repeated over and 
over, producing many copies of the gene to be sequenced.
Cycle sequencing is different from PCR in several ways:
 
✓ During cycle sequencing, ddNTPs get randomly incorporated into the 
DNA as it’s being copied.
 
✓ Whenever a ddNTP is incorporated into a growing chain of DNA, the 
chain is stopped.
 
✓ Instead of producing many exact copies of a DNA sequence like PCR, 
cycle sequencing produces many partial copies of the sequence, each 
one stopped at a different place.
 
✓ The partial copies are loaded into a machine that uses gel electrophore-
sis to put the copies into order by size (Figure 20-8).
 
✓ As the partial sequences pass through the machine, a laser is used to 
read the fluorescent tag on each ddNTP. Each type of ddNTP is tagged 
with a different color fluorescent marker, so a computer can read the 
DNA sequence as the fluorescent ddNTPs flow past the laser.
Some like it hot
Human beings — and human enzymes — like 
life right around 37° Celsius (or 98.6° Fahrenheit). 
If your body gets much hotter than that temper-
ature, your enzymes denature, and you die.
However, just because humans can’t take the 
heat doesn’t mean that nobody can. Happily 
perking along in those hot springs are bacteria 
and archaea called thermophiles. Thermophiles 
like it hot — in fact, put them at your body tem-
perature, and they can’t grow because it’s just 
too cold and slow for thermophiles.
One of these thermophiles, a bacterium called 
Thermus aquaticus, is famous to biologists all 
around the world. T. aquaticus is the source 
of the enzyme Taq polymerase, the DNA poly-
merase that is used in PCR. Like the cells that it 
came from, Taq polymerase likes it hot, which 
means the enzyme isn’t destroyed during the 
heating part of the PCR reaction. Before biolo-
gists discovered Taq polymerase, they used 
a DNA polymerase that denatured at the high 
PCR temperatures. PCR was a lot more work 
because new DNA polymerase had to be added 
after every heating step! Now, thanks to a “hot” 
bacterium, the process is completely automated 
and much easier to do.

Changing the Plan: Using Molecular 
Biology to Solve Problems
Recombinant DNA technology can be controversial. People, including sci-
entists, worry about the ethical, legal, and environmental consequences of 
altering the DNA code of organisms:
 
✓ Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that contain genes from a dif-
ferent organism are currently used in agriculture, but some people are 
concerned about the following potential impacts on wild organisms and 
on small farms:
 
• Genetically modified plants may interbreed with wild species, 
transferring genes for pesticide resistance to weeds.
 
• Crop plants that are engineered to make toxins intended to kill 
agricultural pests can also impact populations of other insects.
 
• Small farmers may not be able to afford genetically modified crop 
plants, putting them at a disadvantage to larger corporate farms.
 
✓ Genetic testing of fetuses allows the early detection of genetic disease, 
but some people worry that genetic testing will be taken to extremes, 
leading to a society where only “perfect” people are allowed to survive.
 
✓ Genetic testing of adults allows people to learn whether they have inher-
ited diseases that run in their family, but some people worry that some 
day insurance companies will use genetic profiles of people to make 
decisions about who to insure.
 
✓ Parents of children with life-threatening diseases that can be treated 
with bone marrow transplants are using genetic testing to conceive 
children that can provide stem cells for their sick siblings. The umbilical 
cord is an excellent source of these stem cells, so the new babies aren’t 
harmed, but people worry that this may lead to an extreme future sce-
nario where babies are born to serve as bone marrow or organ donors 
for existing people.
 
✓ Human hormones like insulin and human growth hormone are produced 
by bacteria through recombinant DNA technology and used to treat 
diseases like diabetes and pituitary dwarfism. However, some people 
seek hormones like human growth hormone for cosmetic reasons (for 
example, so that their children can be a little taller). People question 
whether it’s ethical for parents to make these choices for their children 
and whether too much emphasis is being placed on certain physical 
traits in society.

319
 Chapter 20: Recombinant DNA Technology: Power Tools at the Cellular Level
Making useful proteins through 
genetic engineering
The bacterium E. coli is used as a little cellular factory to produce human 
proteins for treatment of diseases. To get E. coli to produce human proteins, 
cDNA copies of human genes are put into plasmid vectors and then the 
vectors are introduced into E. coli (see Figure 20-9).

The bacterium transcribes and translates the human gene, producing a human 
protein that is identical to the protein made by healthy human cells. Several 
human proteins are currently produced by this method, including the 
following:
 
✓ Human insulin for treatment of diabetes
 
✓ Human growth hormone for treatment of pituitary dwarfism
 
✓ Tumor necrosis factor, taxol, and interleukin-2 for treatment of cancer
 
✓ Epidermal growth factor for treatment of burns and ulcers
Searching for disease genes
Some people carry the potential for future disease in their genes. Genetic 
screening allows people to discover whether they’re carrying recessive 
alleles for genetic diseases, allowing them to choose whether or not to have 
children. Also, diseases that show up later in life, such as Alzheimer’s and 
Huntington’s disease, can be detected early, to seek the earliest possible 
treatment.
In order to screen for a particular genetic disease, scientists must first dis-
cover the gene that causes the disease and study the normal and disease-
causing sequences. Scientists have identified the genes for several genetic 
diseases, including cystic fibrosis, sickle-cell anemia, Huntington’s disease, 
an inherited form of Alzheimer’s, and an inherited form of breast cancer.
 
Once the gene for a genetic disease has been identified, doctors can screen 
people to determine whether they have normal or disease-causing alleles.
Looking before you leap
In my opinion, people should continue to 
debate the issues associated with altering the 
DNA code of organisms as science leads to 
new applications for recombinant DNA tech-
nology. As a society, people should openly 
consider the ethical implications of what they 
do and choose carefully to try to reap the ben-
efits of this technology without creating even 
larger problems. Many scientists agree with 
my view and are proceeding carefully into con-
troversial areas with advice from people who 
specialize in bioethics. Scientists have given 
testimony before lawmaking bodies, such as 
the United States Congress, to help craft the 
laws that will guide and protect societies as 
new applications for recombinant DNA tech-
nology emerge. This technology has great 
power to solve problems and cure diseases, 
and I don’t think people should turn their backs 
on it for fear of the future. Instead, they should 
weigh the pros and cons of each application 
and try to balance personal freedom and the 
common good.

321
 Chapter 20: Recombinant DNA Technology: Power Tools at the Cellular Level
In order to screen a person for a particular gene, scientists amplify the genes 
linked to the disease using PCR. (See the section “Copying a gene with PCR,” 
earlier in this chapter.) Then, scientists use molecular techniques to screen 
the genes for the disease allele:
 
✓ Restriction enzymes can reveal the presence of normal and disease 
alleles in a genotype. Normal alleles and disease-causing alleles may 
have different restriction sites for restriction enzymes. Thus, when a 
person’s DNA is cut with restriction enzymes and separated with gel 
electrophoresis, normal alleles and disease-causing alleles will produce 
a different pattern of bands on a gel (see Figure 20-10). By examining the 
pattern of bands, you can figure out a person’s genotype.
 
✓ Probes for normal alleles and disease-causing alleles detect the 
presence of these alleles in DNA. Once the difference in sequence for 
normal versus disease-causing alleles is known, scientists search the 
DNA for matching sequences using probes specific to each sequence 
(Figure 20-6).

different pattern than DNA from
people with two disease alleles.
The disease allele doesn’t
have a restriction site, so
it isn’t cut by the restriction
enzyme.
Building a “better” plant 
with genetic engineering
Many important crop plants contain recombinant genes. These transgenic 
plants, which are a type of genetically modified organism (GMO), provide 
labor-saving advantages to farmers who can afford them:
 
✓ Transgenic plants that contain genes for herbicide resistance require 
less physical weed control. Farmers can spray crop plants that are 

322
Part VI: Tools of Molecular Biology: Harnessing the Power of DNA 
resistant to a particular herbicide with that herbicide to control weeds. 
Weed plants will be killed, but the modified crop plants will not.
 
✓ Transgenic plants that contain genes for insect toxins will be less dam-
aged by grazing insects. The crop plants use the introduced gene to 
produce insect toxins that kill insects that graze on the plants.
Another potential benefit of transgenic plants is that certain crop plants 
may be altered to become more nutritious. For example, scientists are cur-
rently working on developing a strain of golden rice that may help combat 
Vitamin A deficiency in people around the world. Vitamin A deficiency can 
cause blindness and increase susceptibility to infectious diseases. Golden 
rice is being engineered to contain the genes necessary for the rice plants to 
produce beta-carotene. When people eat golden rice, their bodies will use 
beta-carotene to make Vitamin A. Rice is a staple food for half of the world’s 
people, so golden rice has great potential for fighting Vitamin A deficiency!
Fixing a broken gene with gene therapy
Recombinant DNA technology offers the tantalizing potential of a cure for 
genetic diseases. If scientists can transfer genes successfully into bacteria 
and plants, perhaps they can also transfer them into people that have defec-
tive disease-causing alleles (see Figure 20-11). By introducing a copy of the 
normal allele into affected cells, the cells could be made to function normally, 
eliminating the effects of the disease.
 
The introduction of a gene in order to cure a genetic disease is called 
gene therapy.
Gene therapy for humans is being studied, and clinical trials have occurred 
for some diseases, but this type of treatment is far from being perfected. 
Many barriers to successful human gene therapy still need to be overcome:
 
✓ Scientists must discover safe vectors that can transfer genes into 
human cells. One possible vector is viruses that naturally attack human 
cells and introduce their DNA. Viral DNA is removed and replaced with 
therapeutic genes that contain the normal allele sequence. The viruses 
are allowed to infect human cells, thus introducing the therapeutic 
genes. Following are several safety issues associated with the use of 
viruses as vectors in gene therapy:
 
• Viruses that have been altered may recombine with existing 
viruses to recreate a disease-causing strain.
 
• Viruses that have been altered so that they can’t directly cause 
disease may still cause a severe allergic reaction that is potentially 
life threatening.
 
• Viruses that introduce genes into human cells may interrupt the 
function of normal genes.

✓ Scientists must develop methods for introducing therapeutic genes 
into populations of target cells. Humans are multicellular and have 
complex tissues. Genetic diseases can affect entire populations of cells. 
If gene therapy is to cure these diseases, the therapeutic genes must be 
introduced into all of the affected cells.
 
✓ Stem cells that produce target populations of cells need to be identified. 
If therapeutic genes are introduced into cells that have a limited lifespan 
in the body, then gene therapy will need to be repeated at regular intervals 
to maintain populations of healthy cells. On the other hand, if stem cells 
could be repaired with normal alleles, then they would continuously pro-
duce new populations of healthy cells, and the cure would be permanent.

G
enomics is the study of the entire DNA sequence of an organism. The 
Human Genome Project successfully tackled the task of sequencing the 
entire genome of humans and developed faster and less expensive methods 
for DNA sequencing that are now being used to determine the sequence of 
many other species. Comparisons between the genomes of different species 
are giving scientists insight into cellular function and the evolutionary his-
tory of life on Earth. In this chapter, I present some of the basic methods and 
goals of the science of genomics, as well as the impact of genomics on all of 
biology.
I Read the Whole Thing: 
Sequencing Genomes
You’ve probably heard of the Human Genome Project (HGP), but you may 
not know what an ambitious, exciting, and even controversial project it was. 
When HGP, whose primary goal was to sequence all 3 billion base pairs of 
DNA in the human genome, was first proposed in 1985, the pace of DNA 
sequencing was so slow that it would have taken 1,000 years to complete! 
Some scientists argued that HGP just couldn’t be done, but others were 
inspired by the possibilities for advancement in human knowledge of disease, 
evolution, and human diversity.

326
Part VI: Tools of Molecular Biology: Harnessing the Power of DNA 
HGP was officially launched in 1990 and brought together scientists from all 
around the world to work together to
 
✓ Determine the sequences of 3 billion base pairs that make up human DNA.
 
✓ Store the DNA sequence information in databases.
 
✓ Identify all the 20,000–25,000 genes in human DNA.
 
✓ Improve tools for data analysis.
 
✓ Address the ethical, legal, and social issues related to the project.
Unleashing the power of genomics
The Human Genome Project launched the science of genomics, the study of 
entire genomes. Prior to HGP, genes were identified and mapped to chromo-
somes one at a time (see Chapter 16). Genomics, on the other hand, takes 
a systems approach, looking at the entire genome at once. Since HGP, the 
genomes of hundreds more organisms have been sequenced. Because all 
the DNA sequence is available, genomics opens the door to many new types 
of information. Research in genomics is taking several approaches to make 
sense of all the new sequence data:
 
✓ Genomics is concerned with sequencing genomes of all different types 
of organisms.
 
✓ Comparative genomics compares genomes from different species in 
order to gain a better understanding of how species have evolved and to 
determine the function of genes and noncoding regions of the genome.
 
✓ Functional genomics tries to figure out the functions of genes, including 
when genes are expressed and how their products interact.
 
✓ Pharmacogenomics studies how a person’s unique genome affects their 
response to drugs, with the goal of developing drugs that are highly 
effective for treating disease in each individual person.
Reading the book of life with 
shotgun sequencing
 
A type of rapid DNA sequencing, called shotgun sequencing (see Figure 21-1), 
makes it possible to sequence entire genomes in a reasonable amount of time.

327
 Chapter 21: Genomics: The Big Picture
Genomes are broken up into small fragments, which are sequenced and then 
reassembled like a puzzle to determine the complete genome. Figure 21-1 
shows the steps for one type of shotgun sequencing, called hierarchical shot-
gun sequencing:
 
1. Genomic DNA is cut into large fragments about 150,000,000 base pairs 
(150 Mb) long.
 
2. The large fragments are put into a vector called a bacterial artificial 
chromosome and then cloned into bacteria to be replicated.
 
3. The large fragments are mapped and organized to determine their 
relative order to each other.
 
4. Each large fragment is broken up into a set of smaller fragments that 
can be sequenced.
 
5. The small fragments are sequenced.
 
6. A computer lines up the overlapping sequences to determine the 
order of the small fragments. 
 
 Once all the small fragments are sequenced and aligned, the sequence of 
the genome is complete.

Part VI: Tools of Molecular Biology: Harnessing the Power of DNA 
Using shotgun sequencing, the genomes of hundreds of different species 
have been sequenced. Organisms are chosen for sequencing primarily based 
on their importance to humans:
 
✓ Pathogens are being sequenced in order to help develop new strategies 
to fight disease.
 
✓ Extremophiles, organisms that live in extreme conditions like high heat 
or high salt, are being sequenced to look for proteins with industrial 
applications.
 
✓ Crop plants, like corn and rice, are being sequenced to increase human 
understanding of the organisms that provide food to most of the people 
in the world.
 
✓ Model organisms, such as mice, fruit flies, and E. coli, are being 
sequenced so that their scientists can compare their genomes to those 
of humans.
Looking within the human genome
The human genome contains many unexpected patterns in the sequence. 
For example, humans have much fewer genes than were originally expected 
based on the size of the human genome — just 25,000 genes instead of the 
predicted 100,000! Other features of the human genome include
 
✓ The average gene size is about 3,000 base pairs long.
 
✓ The number of genes on each chromosome varies from 2,968 genes on 
chromosome 1 to just 231 genes on the Y chromosome.
 
✓ At least 50 percent of the human genome consists of small repeating 
sequences that do not code for protein or RNA.
 
✓ Genes are randomly clustered together on chromosomes and separated 
from other clusters of genes by noncoding DNA in between.
 
✓ The areas of DNA that contain genes contain lots of G-C base pairs, 
whereas the regions of noncoding DNA contain lots of A-T base pairs.
 
✓ Less than 2 percent of the genome contains the code for proteins and 
RNA molecules. The other 98 percent of the genome consists of various 
types of DNA and DNA whose function isn’t yet known. The known func-
tions of noncoding DNA include
 
• Regulatory sequences that control how DNA is used, such as pro-
moters and origins of replication.
 
• Sequences that are involved in the structuring of DNA within the 
cell such as those that determine nucleosome positioning (see 
Chapter 19).

329
 Chapter 21: Genomics: The Big Picture
 
• Small repeated sequences, sometimes called junk DNA, that are 
scattered throughout the genome. The function of this DNA, which 
makes up 50 percent of the human genome, isn’t yet known.
 
• Sequences, called pseudogenes, that are the mutated relics of for-
merly functioning genes.
 
The information in the human genome can be divided into two main catego-
ries: coding sequences that are found in genes and repetitive sequences that 
make up noncoding DNA.
We Have a Lot in Common: 
Comparative Genomics
Scientists who study comparative genomics use computer programs to 
search databases of genomic data to look for regions of similarity in the 
genomes of different species. Comparative genomics can answer several 
kinds of questions:
 
✓ What is the evolutionary relationship between different species? The 
greater the similarity between two genomes, the closer the relationship 
between the species.
 
✓ What genes are common to different species? Some genes exist in 
slightly different forms in many cells, forming gene families. Databases 
of genomic data are searched for sequences from known genes to see 
whether the known sequence is present in other organisms. If a known 
sequence is found in the genome of another organism, then the other 
organism probably has a gene with a similar function to the known gene.
 
✓ Which sequences determine the unique features of organisms? 
Comparisons of closely related species, such as chimpanzees and 
humans, reveal which sequences are most important in creating the 
unique features of each species.
 
✓ Which sequences show the effects of natural selection? By match-
ing up the DNA sequences of related organisms, such as humans and 
mice, and then comparing the rates of mutation in different areas of the 
genome, scientists can identify areas of DNA that have undergone natu-
ral selection.
 
One of the big take-home messages of comparative genomics is that all life on 
Earth is very similar. Your DNA sequence shows the close relationship 
between you and your earthly neighbors. For example, your genome is 99.9 
percent identical to that of other humans, 96 percent identical to that of chim-
panzees, and about 40 percent identical to that of mice.

330
Part VI: Tools of Molecular Biology: Harnessing the Power of DNA 
Another interesting discovery learned from comparing genomes is that a 
bigger genome and more genes don’t necessarily mean a more complicated 
organism. And, organisms that are very similar to each other can have very 
different genome sizes (see Table 21-1).
 
Large genomes don’t necessarily mean a lot of genes. Organisms with large 
genomes typically have more repetitive DNA in their genomes.

Monkey business
A recent comparison between the human and 
chimpanzee genomes shows that the genomes 
are 96 percent similar in sequence, which 
leaves people wondering how two species can 
be so similar in their DNA sequence, but so dif-
ferent in appearance and behavior. The leading 
hypothesis is that the development of organ-
isms has as much to do with how they use their 
DNA sequence as what their DNA sequence 
actually says. 
Noncoding DNA, the DNA that is outside of 
genes, is thought to play an important regula-
tory role in controlling when and how genes 
are used. The fact that the human genome has 
such a great amount (98 percent!) of noncoding 
DNA makes this idea seem quite possible. Also, 
genes for transcription factors (see Chapter 19) 
in humans seem to be evolving more quickly 
than similar genes in chimpanzees. The com-
parison between the human and chimpanzee 
genomes also shows differences in genes that 
control inflammation and a gene that protects 
chimpanzees from Alzheimer’s. Understanding 
the effects of these differences between 
humans and chimps may help scientists better 
treat disease.

331
 Chapter 21: Genomics: The Big Picture
Comparisons between these genomes show that differences in organisms can’t 
be explained based on genome size alone. Mustard weed and corn are both 
plants, but the corn genome is much larger than that of the mustard weed. 
Fruit flies and nematodes have the same number of genes, but the fruit fly 
genome is much larger than that of nematodes. Likewise, humans and mustard 
weeds have the same number of genes, but the human genome is much larger.
Two main observations can explain the observed differences in genome size 
between organisms:
 
✓ Some organisms, such as certain plants, have acquired multiple sets of 
chromosomes during their evolution. Organisms that have many sets of 
chromosomes are polyploid. Polyploid organisms can have very large 
genomes.
 
✓ Some organisms, such as humans, have lots of repetitive sequences in 
their genomes. Repetitive sequences range in size from 150 to 300 base 
pairs and can be repeated thousands of time. For example, a 300 base 
pair sequence called Alu occurs more than 1.1 million times in humans.
What’s Your Function?: 
Functional Genomics
Functional genomics tries to discover the functions of DNA sequences, 
including the relationships between genes and the interactions between gene 
products, such as RNAs and proteins. Functional genomics considers the 
entire group of gene products, or transcriptome, that is together in the cell at 
any one time and compares it to the transcriptome that is present at other 
times. Scientists can answer the following kinds of questions through func-
tional genomics:
 
✓ How much variation is there within a genome? Scientists can com-
pare the genomes of different individuals within species for nucleotide 
changes called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to determine how 
much variation exists within the genome of a species.
 
✓ When and where does gene expression occur? Scientists can compare 
cells of different species or at different developmental stages to each 
other in order to determine patterns of gene expression between spe-
cies and during development.
 
✓ How do genes and the products of different genes interact with each 
other? Relationships between genes are suggested when the same genes 
occur in a number of related species or when genes occur together in 
the same part of the genome. Relationships between gene products are 
proposed when they’re produced at the same time in the cell.

332
Part VI: Tools of Molecular Biology: Harnessing the Power of DNA 
Looking for open reading frames
 
Scientists hope to discover new proteins by searching or them within the 
genome. Genes are encoded within open reading frames, sections of DNA that 
begin with the code for a start codon and end with the code for a stop codon. 
(See Chapter 18 for more on codons.)
Computers search DNA sequences for patterns that correspond to open read-
ing frames. Scientists can locate some types of genes more easily than others: 
 
✓ Prokaryotic genes are relatively easy to locate. The sequences of 
prokaryotic promoters are well known, which helps to locate prokary-
otic genes. (Also, prokaryotic genes do not contain introns, making the 
coding sequence easier to locate. See Chapter 18 for more on promoters 
and introns.)
 
✓ Eukaryotic genes are harder to identify. Less than 2 percent of the 
human genome is actually made of genes, which makes gene hunting a 
little like looking for a needle in a haystack. Also, eukaryotic genes con-
tain introns that break up genes and make them harder to recognize.
Comparing gene expression 
with DNA microarrays
Cells turn genes on and off as they respond to signals, go through different 
developmental stages, or even become cancerous. One goal of functional 
genomics is to compare these changing patterns of gene expression (for 
more on gene expression, see Chapter 19). To determine which genes are 
expressed at any one time in the cell, geneticists track the presence of RNA 
sequences in cells using DNA microarrays.
 
A DNA microarray is a glass slide with many single-stranded copies of DNA 
stuck to it. The DNA sequences stuck to the slide are single-stranded copies of 
all the genes for a particular cell.
 
1. Molecules of mRNA are isolated from the two cells to be compared.
 
 The two cells are different in some way that you are interested in study-
ing, such as two cells from different stages of development, cells from 
two different species, cells grown under different environmental condi-
tions, or a normal cell and a cancer cell.

2. Reverse transcription produces labeled cDNA copies of each popula-
tion of mRNA.
 
 One of the nucleotides included as building blocks for the formation of 
the cDNA in each population is labeled with a colored fluorescent tag 
so that all the cDNA molecules from one cell are tagged with a certain 
color. (See Chapter 20 for a description of how to make cDNA.)
 
3. The cDNA molecules from each cell are washed over the surface of the 
DNA microarray.
 
 Wherever the cDNA molecules find complementary sequences on the 
slide, they will stick. The cDNA molecules are acting as probes to scan 
the genome on the microarray and identify which sequences are being 
expressed in the cell from which the cDNAs were made.
 
4. Use a laser to activate the fluorescent tags on the cDNA molecules and 
observe the color patterns to determine which DNA sequences are 
expressed in each cell type.
 
a. If a particular spot on the microarray is dark, then the sequence in 
that location on the microarray isn’t expressed in either cell type.
 
b. If a particular spot on the microarray is the color of one cell type 
or the other, then the sequence in that location on the microarray 
is expressed only in the corresponding cell type.
 
c. If a particular spot on the microarray is the color of the combined 
fluorescent tags, then the sequence in that location on the microar-
ray is expressed in both cell types.
Reaping the Rewards: 
Pharmacogenomics
Pharmacogenomics combines traditional pharmacology and genomics with 
the goal of tailoring drug therapies more precisely to suit particular diseases 
or an individual’s genome. The kinds of questions that pharmacogenomics 
hopes to answer include
 
✓ Which genes and proteins are associated with this disease? When the 
genes and proteins that cause a particular disease are known, then sci-
entists can develop very specific drugs that target just those genes and 
proteins. Drugs that are very specific will cause far fewer side effects 
than some of the medications in use today that affect normal proteins as 
well as disease-causing proteins.

✓ Which drug is the best treatment for a person with a particular geno-
type? Many people have adverse reactions to certain drugs. If certain 
adverse reactions are more common in people with a particular genotype, 
then it will be possible to use a person’s genotype to predict how they’ll 
react to a drug. Doctors can choose the best drug for a person right from 
the beginning of treatment based on their genotype, preventing additional 
illness from an adverse drug reaction.
 
✓ For which diseases is a person with a particular genotype most at risk? 
Some diseases have a genetic basis, while other diseases are more likely 
to affect some people than others. Genotype screening allows identifica-
tion of any genetic diseases that a person inherited, as well as prediction 
of their risk factors for other diseases. Based on this information, people 
can make lifestyle choices to minimize their risk for disease.
I’ve Got a System: Systems Biology
The availability of sequenced genomes has had a huge impact on many 
branches of biology. Much of the genome information is stored in publicly 
accessible data bases — all you need to access this data is a computer with 
an Internet connection! Scientists all over the world are mining this informa-
tion to develop new understandings in evolution, medicine, and develop-
ment. Scientists are using genomic information and the techniques developed 
by genomics in many ways, as you can from the following list:
 
✓ Evolutionary biologists can study entire genomes, looking for evolu-
tionary patterns to determine the relationships between organisms, the 
sources of new genes, and the effects of natural selection on genes.
 
✓ Geneticists share gene maps and probe sequences, facilitating the iden-
tification and location of disease-causing genes. Geneticists also look for 
open reading frames in genomes to discover new genes. (For more on 
this topic, see the section “Looking for open reading frames,” earlier in 
this chapter.)
 
✓ Developmental biologists compare genomes of cells at different devel-
opmental stages using DNA microarrays in order to learn the expression 
patterns of genes during development. Developmental biologists also 
can use comparative genomics to screen genomes of different organ-
isms for sequences known to be important in development, identifying 
sequences that have a common function across a group of organisms.
 
✓ Biochemists can predict the structure and function of proteins based on 
DNA sequences found in open reading frames. Biochemists can also look 
for drugs that target specific proteins discovered to be associated with 
particular diseases.

335
 Chapter 21: Genomics: The Big Picture
In addition to the impact of genomic information and techniques, the systems 
approach of genomics is spreading to other areas of biology. Proteomics is 
a new branch of biology that studies all the proteins present in a cell at one 
time, and metabolomics is a new branch of biochemistry that looks at the full 
set of reactions that happen in a cell at one time. These systems approaches 
are different from traditional approaches where a portion of a system is iso-
lated and studied at one time. By considering an entire system of molecules 
or reactions at once, biochemists can better understand the interactions 
between components of the system and can consider the properties of the 
entire system as a whole.
 
The traditional central dogma of molecular biology is DNA → RNA → protein. 
In the era of genomics, the central dogma can be rewritten as genome → tran-
scriptome → proteome.

principles that form the foundation of molecular and 
cellular biology. In addition, I share my top ten tips for

Ten Important Rules 
for Cells to Live By
In This Chapter
▶ Creating the Cell Theory
▶ Conserving matter and energy
▶ Evolving by natural selection
▶ Believing the Central Dogma
L
aws that govern the energetics of the entire universe have implications 
for cells right here on Earth. And, by studying the behavior of all differ-
ent types of cells, common themes emerge that suggest rules that all cells 
follow. In this chapter, I present ten of the rules that I find to be particularly 
important to cells.
The Cell Theory
The roots of the Cell Theory trace back to the first observations of cells by 
Robert Hooke and Antony vanLeeuwenhoek. Back around 1665, Robert Hooke 
looked at thin slices of cork, which is a tissue from the bark of certain trees, 
with a microscope. He saw what looked like tiny little rectangles all stuck 
together in a sheet. The little rectangles reminded him of the small rooms 
that monks lived in, which were called cells. The cells that Robert Hooke saw 
were the cell walls of the plant cells that had once made up the cork tissue. 
The cells were dead and gone, but their cell walls remained.
Antony vanLeeuwenhoek was a Dutch cloth merchant who read about 
Hooke’s discovery and got curious about the world he saw through a micro-
scope. He made his own tiny single lens microscopes and started exploring 
the world around him. (See Chapter 1 for more details on his discoveries.) In 
a tiny drop of pond water, he was amazed to find small swimming creatures 

340
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
that turned out to be the first living cells ever seen by a person! In 1673, 
vanLeewenhoek sent a letter about his discoveries to the Royal Academy of 
London, causing a shockwave of excitement throughout Europe.
People continued to look at the world through microscopes for another 200 
years, making various observations. In 1833, the Scottish botanist Robert 
Brown discovered that plant cells had little spots in them that he named 
nuclei because they looked like little seeds. A German botanist, Matthias 
Jacob Schleiden, heard about Brown’s discovery and started looking more 
closely at plant cells. By 1838, Schleiden decided that plants grew by produc-
ing new cells. He went to a dinner party where he met Theodor Schwann, a 
German zoologist who was studying animal tissues. Schleiden told Schwann 
about his observations and conclusions about plant cells, and the two of 
them got very excited about working together. Schwann invited Schleiden to 
visit his lab, and together the two scientists looked closely at animal cells. 
They discovered that animal cells had nuclei just like plant cells. Because 
plant and animal cells had this remarkable similarity, the scientists con-
cluded that all living things are made of cells. This conclusion became the 
cornerstone of the modern Cell Theory:
 
✓ The cell is the fundamental unit of structure, function, and organization 
in all living organisms.
 
✓ All cells come from pre-existing cells.
 
✓ The cell is the smallest form of life.
The First Law of Thermodynamics
The First Law of Thermodynamics says that energy can’t be created or 
destroyed. What the First Law of Thermodynamics means for cells is that 
because they can’t make the energy they need, they have to get it from some-
where in their environment. Cells that do photosynthesis get their energy 
from the Sun and store it in the form of sugars that they make. Cells that can’t 
make their own sugars must use sugars made by other cells for energy — in 
other words, they’ve got to eat somebody.
Single-cells organisms eat smaller single-celled organisms. Multicellular 
animals have digestive systems that are specialized for eating and break-
ing down other living things. Fungi and bacteria release enzymes onto dead 
things that turn them into molecule soup that the fungal and bacterial cells 
absorb for their matter and energy. All living things on Earth, including the 
cells that make their own food, have the ability to transfer energy from food 
to a form that is usable for cells.

341
 Chapter 22: Ten Important Rules for Cells to Live By
Another consequence of the First Law of Thermodynamics for cells is that 
the energy that they use has to go somewhere; it doesn’t just disappear. Cells 
transfer energy from food into movement, store it in molecules they build, or 
transfer it back out to their environment as heat. You can account for all the 
energy that enters the cell if you add up the energy within the cell and the 
energy that is transferred back to the environment. In keeping with the first 
law, the total energy in the universe remains the same.
The Second Law of Thermodynamics
The Second Law of Thermodynamics, phrased in a way that makes sense 
for cells, states that processes can happen spontaneously only if they 
increase the entropy, or disorder, in the universe. What the Second Law of 
Thermodynamics means to a cell is that the reactions that break molecules 
down or increase the amount of disorganization in the cell are easy to do, 
but anything that keeps the cell organized and maintained is going to cost 
the cell some energy. Because cells must stay organized and maintained to 
stay alive, cells must constantly transfer energy from the environment into 
the cell to pay for this expensive upkeep. If a cell runs out of energy, such 
as when no food is available, the cell will no longer be able to maintain itself 
and will die.
The Second Law also says that cells will never be able to access all the avail-
able energy that is stored in the food they break down. With every energy 
transfer, the potential energy of the system decreases (if you don’t count any 
energy entering or leaving the system). For cells, what the second law means 
is that every time cells transfer energy from food molecules into cellular 
processes, some of the potential energy that was stored in the food is trans-
ferred to heat. The heat produced from these energy transfers leaves the cell 
and goes back out into the environment.
Any time you exercise, you can see the effect of the second law in action. 
Exercise requires energy, so your cells increase the speed of the reactions 
that transfer energy from food. With every transfer of energy from food to 
your cells, some heat energy is produced. You can feel this heat as your body 
begins to warm up and then starts to sweat to cool itself. The heat produced 
by the energy transfers in your cells is released from your body to the air and 
objects around you. Heat production by your cells is most dramatic during 
exercise, but it’s actually occurring all the time.

The Theory of Evolution 
by Natural Selection
Things change, including cells. When groups of living things change over time, 
scientists call it evolution. You can find proof that evolution occurs in your 
daily newspaper in stories about the increase in numbers of antibiotic-resistant 
bacteria. Types of bacteria that were once killed by certain antibiotics now sur-
vive these same drugs because the bacteria have changed from what they used 
to be. Evidence for evolution is also found in the fossil record, which includes 
imprints of living things, such as dinosaurs that no longer exist. Living cells, 
from E. coli to your own cells, show that they’re related to each other by using 
the same fundamental chemistry based on DNA and proteins. If cells on Earth 
are all related, then presumably they all have the same ancestors. If all cells 
have the same ancestor, then life today, in all of its varied forms, developed by 
evolution from a common source.
The Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection was proposed by Charles 
Darwin as a way to explain how cells evolve, or change, over time. He based 
his idea on observations of how plants and animals can change, including 
organisms bred for certain traits by farmers and the unique plants and ani-
mals that developed on the isolated islands in the Galapagos. Darwin’s pro-
posal had the following main points:
 
✓ Living things inherit many of their traits from their parents. Traits are 
inherited through the DNA that is passed from parents to offspring.
 
✓ Living things make more offspring than can survive based on avail-
able resources in the environment. From bunnies to bacteria, organ-
isms typically make as many babies as they can. The number of 
offspring that will survive is limited by the availability of resources, such 
as food, water, and shelter.
 
✓ Living things have differences from each other. Changes in traits 
result from changes in the DNA called mutations. A small but signifi-
cant number of mutations occur in the DNA of a cell every time the cell 
copies its DNA before it divides. Environmental agents can increase the 
rate of mutation in cells, resulting in faster changes. Basically, muta-
tion happens. And when it does, individual cells and organisms can be 
slightly changed as a result.
 
✓ Because of competition for survival, the living things that have the 
traits that are best suited for a particular environment are more likely 
to survive and reproduce. In other words, it’s survival of the fittest.
 
✓ The survivors reproduce, passing their traits to their offspring. 
Thus, more of the individuals in the new generation have the traits 
that enable survival. The population of living things has changed, or 
evolved, from what it used to be.

343
 Chapter 22: Ten Important Rules for Cells to Live By
The change from susceptible bacteria that antibiotics can kill to resistant 
bacteria that antibiotics can’t kill is an excellent example of evolution by nat-
ural selection. The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria follows all of Darwin’s 
points:
 
✓ Bacteria copy their DNA before they divide so that each new cell is very 
similar to the original cell.
 
✓ Bacteria reproduce very quickly and can make thousands of new cells in 
just a few hours.
 
✓ Bacterial DNA is mutated slightly whenever the cells divide, creating 
slight differences in new cells.
 
✓ When humans use antibiotics to bacterial infections, the antibiotics will 
kill any individual bacteria that are susceptible. However, if some bac-
teria have traits that enable them to withstand the antibiotic, they will 
survive.
 
✓ Even if an antibiotic kills 99.9 percent of a bacterial population, bacteria 
reproduce so quickly that the 0.1 percent of survivors will be able to 
generate a whole new population in a very short period of time. This 
new population will receive its DNA from the survivors, inheriting the 
trait that enabled survival. This new population of bacteria is now resis-
tant to the antibiotic that was used.
 
Evolution by natural selection acts on populations, or groups, not on individ-
uals. In other words, individuals can’t change their traits in order to survive 
and thus evolve into some sort of new being. When something limits survival, 
such as lack of food or the presence of an antibiotic (if you’re a bacterium), 
individuals die or survive based on the traits they already have — traits they 
inherited from their parents. What changes over time is the allele frequency 
(the frequency of a trait) in a group of organisms the individuals belong to. 
When part of the population is killed, the survivors repopulate the group 
with their offspring, so the group changes from one generation to the next.
The Law of Conservation of Matter
The Law of Conservation of Matter (or Mass) says that matter can’t be cre-
ated or destroyed. The chemist Antoine Laurent Lavoisier originally formu-
lated the law to explain what happens during chemical reactions. Lavoisier 
showed that even though materials may seem to disappear during chemical 
reactions, if you carefully track the mass of everything involved in the reac-
tion, the mass of materials entering the reaction is the same as the mass of 
materials exiting the reaction. In other words, during chemical reactions 
atoms change partners, but no atoms are lost or gained.

344
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
According to the Law of Conservation of Matter, then, every atom in every 
food molecule taken in by a cell must be trackable. For example, in order to 
transfer energy out of food, cells break down food by cellular respiration. 
The summary reaction for the breakdown of glucose by cellular respiration is 
represented by this formula:
C6H12O6 + 6 O2 → 6 CO2 + 6 H2O
When cells break down glucose (C6H12O6), it may seem that the glucose 
disappears. But in reality, the carbon and oxygen atoms in the glucose are 
bonded to each other to form the molecule carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon 
dioxide is a gas and is thus invisible. However, if you count all the atoms in 
the reactants and products of this reaction, you’ll see that they’re the same. 
If you were to trap all the carbon dioxide and water produced by cellular 
respiration, the mass would be the same as that of the sugar and oxygen 
that enters the reaction.
Another effect of the Law of Conservation of Matter on cells is that cells can’t 
grow unless they take in matter from the environment. Cells can’t just create 
molecules for growth out of nothing; they must use food molecules to pro-
vide the atoms needed for the construction of growth molecules. Cells break 
food molecules down into their building blocks and then use those building 
blocks to build the molecules of the cell. So, cells can either break food mole-
cules all the way down to carbon dioxide and water, releasing the atoms from 
food back into the environment, or they can partially break down their food, 
keeping the atoms in the cell for cellular growth.
Exceptions to the Law of Conservation of Matter do exist. As objects travel 
at speeds approaching the speed of light, the distinction between matter and 
energy begins to blur. Also, matter may convert into energy during nuclear 
reactions. However, in the world of the cell, the Law of Conservation of 
Matter applies and is a useful way of thinking about how cells use food.
Nucleic Acids Pair in 
Antiparallel Strands
In DNA, two strands of nucleotides are held together by hydrogen bonds to 
form the double helix. The two strands of nucleotides run in opposite, or 
antiparallel, directions to each other. When nucleotide strands are oriented 
antiparallel to each other, the hydrogen bonding sites on the nitrogenous 
base adenine (A) line up with those on the nitrogenous base thymine (T), and 
the hydrogen bonding sites of guanine (G) line up with those of cytosine (C). 

345
 Chapter 22: Ten Important Rules for Cells to Live By
The nitrogenous bases are like puzzle pieces that fit together only if they’re 
in just the right position next to each other — in this case, that means one 
base right side up, and the other base upside down.
The lesson of antiparallel base pairing demonstrated by DNA applies to all 
other interactions between nucleic acids, too. Any time two nucleic acid 
strands pair with each other, they must be oriented opposite to each other. 
Nucleic acids pair during several cellular processes and molecular techniques:
 
✓ RNA pairs with DNA during transcription. As the message in DNA is 
copied into RNA during transcription, the two nucleic acids are held 
together by hydrogen bonds between their bases. The growing RNA 
strand is built in the 5' to 3' direction, starting with its 5' end. This grow-
ing strand is hydrogen bonded to the DNA template strand that runs in 
the 3' to 5' direction.
 
✓ mRNA pairs with tRNA during translation. When tRNA molecules enter 
the ribosome, the tRNA anticodons bind to the mRNA codons. The 
mRNA molecule is oriented in the 5' to 3' direction, so the tRNA anti-
codons are oriented in the 3' to 5' direction.
 
✓ snRNA pairs with pre-mRNA during splicing. In eukaryotes, the primary 
RNA transcript must have its introns removed before translation. During 
splicing, mRNA and snRNA are held together by hydrogen bonds. The 
mRNA and snRNA are antiparallel to each other.
 
✓ DNA probes bind to DNA in order to locate specific sequences. DNA 
probes tagged with fluorescent or radioactive labels are used to search 
for specific sequences in a sample of DNA. The probe must be con-
structed so that its sequence is complementary and antiparallel to the 
sequence that is being looked for.
 
✓ DNA primers bind to DNA in order to begin amplification of a DNA 
sequence during PCR. DNA primers bind to single-stranded DNA on 
each side of the sequence to be amplified. The DNA primers must have 
sequences that are complementary and antiparallel to the sequences on 
either side of the sequence to be amplified.
Central Dogma
The Central Dogma of molecular biology describes the flow of information in 
the cell. Frances Crick first described the Central Dogma in 1958 as a way of 
representing the understanding at the time of how information flows from the 
language of nucleic acids to the language of proteins. Since then, evidence 
has supported and added to the understanding of the Central Dogma.

346
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
In its simplest form, the Central Dogma says that information flows from DNA 
to RNA to protein. In other words, the code in DNA is used to make RNA, and 
then the code in RNA is used to make protein. A more complete expression of 
the Central Dogma in cells has several components:
 
✓ Information flows from DNA to DNA. Each strand of DNA is used as the 
pattern for building complementary strands during DNA replication.
 
✓ Information flows from DNA to RNA. The DNA code in genes is used as 
the pattern for building complementary molecules of RNA. Several kinds 
of RNA exist in cells, including mRNA, rRNA, tRNA, and other small RNAs.
 
✓ Information flows from mRNA to protein. The code in mRNA is 
decoded during translation in order to determine the sequence of amino 
acids in proteins.
If information flow in viruses is included, then two more components must be 
added to the Central Dogma:
 
✓ Information flows from RNA to RNA. Some viruses have RNA for their 
genetic material. These viruses use RNA as a pattern to make more RNA 
strands during replication of the virus.
 
✓ Information flows from RNA to DNA. Some viruses that have RNA for 
their genetic material use the RNA as a pattern for the construction of a 
DNA molecules. These viruses are called retroviruses.
Protein Shape Is Essential 
to Their Function
Proteins are incredibly important to the normal functioning of cells (see 
Chapter 6). Proteins catalyze reactions, provide structure to cells, turn genes 
on and off, send and receive signals, and transport materials. In every job 
that proteins do, their shape is key to their function. Here’s a list of just some 
of the ways protein shape is important to function:
 
✓ Enzymes have pockets called active sites that are just the right shape to 
bind the enzyme’s substrate.
 
✓ Enzymes have regulatory sites called allosteric sites that are the right 
shape for regulatory molecules to bind to.
 
✓ DNA-binding proteins have pockets called DNA-binding sites that are the 
right shape to bind to particular sequences of DNA.

347
 Chapter 22: Ten Important Rules for Cells to Live By
 
✓ Receptor proteins have to be a particular shape in order to bind to their 
ligand.
 
✓ Membrane transport proteins called carrier proteins have pockets that 
bind specifically to the substance they transport across membranes.
 
✓ Antibody proteins have antigen-binding sites that are just the right 
shape to bind to antigens from bacteria and viruses.
Cells use protein shape to regulate cell processes. Because protein shape is 
essential to function, if a protein’s shape is changed, it will no longer be able 
to do a particular job — and a protein’s shape changes any time something 
binds to it. So, regulatory molecules bind to proteins to change their shape 
and turn them on or off. Cells regulate proteins in order to control two of the 
most important activities in cells, metabolism and gene regulation:
 
✓ Allosteric inhibitors and activators bind to allosteric sites on enzymes 
to control enzyme activity. Allosteric inhibitors change enzyme shape 
to stop enzyme function and shut down metabolic pathways. Allosteric 
activators change enzyme shape to improve enzyme function and 
increase the rate of metabolic pathways.
 
✓ Inducers and co-repressors bind to DNA-binding proteins called repres-
sors to regulate transcription. Inducers change repressor shape, making 
them inactive and unable to bind to DNA. When repressors are inactive, 
transcription occurs. Co-repressors change repressor shape, making 
them active and able to bind to DNA. When repressors are active, tran-
scription is blocked.
 
✓ General transcription factors bind to each other and to RNA polymerase, 
changing the shape of RNA polymerase so that it can bind to promoters 
and initiate transcription.
Law of Segregation
Organisms that reproduce by sexual reproduction follow the Law of 
Segregation. Diploid cells, like body cells in humans, have two copies of every 
gene. During reproduction, some diploid cells undergo meiosis. Meiosis seg-
regates each gene pair by separating the chromosomes of the cell. Thus, cells 
that have two copies of every gene give only one copy to their gametes (eggs 
and sperm). Gametes are haploid because they have only one copy of every 
gene. In order to make a new individual, two gametes need to get together, 
which creates a new diploid cell that again has two copies of every gene, one 
from each parent.

348
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Law of Independent Assortment
Diploid cells have two of each kind of chromosome. Pairs of matching chro-
mosomes are called homologous chromosomes. When cells undergo meiosis 
to create gametes (eggs and sperm), they separate their homologous chro-
mosomes so that each gamete gets only one of each pair. The segregation 
of homologous chromosomes separates pairs of alleles for each gene. So, 
when meiosis happens over and over again in an individual to produce many 
gametes, each of those gametes will have a slightly different combination of 
alleles. The law of independent assortment increases the variation in the off-
spring of sexually reproducing organisms.

Ten Ways to Improve Your Grade
In This Chapter
▶ Becoming an active participant in your learning
▶ Discovering the best strategies that work for you
▶ Figuring out how your instructor likes to test
M
olecular and cellular biology is a tough subject, and you need to 
tackle it hard in order to succeed. The good news is that the skills you 
build to be successful in this class will be very useful skills in other classes 
and in careers in science and medicine. The bad news may be that you have 
to reserve a good chunk of time in your life to dedicate to this subject. In this 
chapter, I present ten tips for getting the most for your investment of time, 
whether in lecture or when studying on your own.
Keep Your Mind Alive During Lecture
Some instructors are good lecturers, others not so much. But whatever your 
circumstance, you can do a lot on your end to get the maximum benefit out 
of attending lecture:
 
✓ Write notes in your own words. Listen to what your instructor is saying 
and write your own notes. Writing your own notes is very different 
from just sitting there and writing down whatever the instructor says 
or writes on a board. If you’re listening and writing things in your own 
words, you’re processing the information as you go.
 
✓ Take notes on interesting stories and anecdotes. Instructors often tell 
stories and give examples to show the relevance of the information 
they’re presenting. They don’t usually write down these stories, how-
ever, so many students don’t write them down either. If the instructor 
tells a good one that helps you grasp the concept they’re talking about, 
jot down a few notes about it in the margin of your notes. When you’re 
studying later, these side notes may help you recall the topic.

350
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Sit in the best place for you in lecture. Usually, the front is best. It’s too 
easy to get distracted and tune out in the back. However, if you’re some-
one who gets sleepy and might need to move around a little to wake up, 
then try an aisle seat. If you get sleepy, you can get up and take a short 
walk to the rest room. It’s better to get up and move than to miss half of 
lecture because you took a nap.
 
✓ Ask questions when you don’t understand. If you’re prepared for class 
and following the lecture but something doesn’t make sense to you, then 
ask about it. Chances are if you don’t get it, someone else doesn’t either.
 
✓ Be in good physical shape for class. Get enough sleep, exercise, and 
healthy food so that you’re ready to participate.
Schedule Your Study Time
You’ll get the best bang for your study time if you’re smart about how you 
schedule it.
 
✓ Plan for studying like you do for other important events. Make study-
ing a priority and figure out how to fit it into your life.
 
✓ Schedule enough time each week. Science classes require more study 
time than other types of classes. Each branch of science has its own 
language that you need to master, with tons of new terms. Also, science 
instructors typically expect you to memorize lots of detailed informa-
tion, including how complex processes work. The general rule is two 
hours outside of class for every hour in class.
 
✓ Schedule short blocks of time each day as well as longer blocks a few 
times a week. Studies show that you get the most out of studying your 
lecture notes the sooner you review them after lecture. So, plan some 
study time every day so that you can do a review before you forget what 
you heard.
Be Active, Not Passive
You’ll have the most success if you use a combination of approaches to 
studying molecular and cellular biology. Some activities, such as attending 
lecture, reading your text, and even reviewing your notes, are fairly passive 
because you’re receiving information from another source.
If you understand what you’re hearing and reading, great! Understanding is one 
of the first steps to learning the material. However, understanding what you hear 
and read isn’t enough. And for most people, reading and re-reading the text isn’t 
effective. You need to take active approaches to get yourself to the next levels.

✓ Put things in your own words. Memorizing a definition from the book 
or an explanation from an instructor will only get you so far. You can 
say the same thing many different ways, and your instructor is likely to 
use different ways of phrasing things in lecture and on exams. Practice 
the language you’re learning by putting things in your own words rather 
than relying totally upon the words of others.
 
✓ Recreate the information by yourself. Practice drawing diagrams on 
blank pieces of paper, looking at your notes only when you have to. Tell 
your study partners or your dog about metabolic pathways, naming the 
essential steps out loud. The key here is that you’re working with what 
is in your own brain as much as possible, over and over until you’ve got 
it down.
 
✓ Practice applying the information to new situations. Once you think 
you’ve got it, try solving every problem you can get your hands on. 
Solve the harder problems at the end of the chapter in the text, review 
any problems given in class, and do any homework that was assigned. If 
you really get it, you should be able to take it out of the box and use it in 
a new situation.
Give Your Brain a Well-Rounded 
Workout During Study Sessions
Some people learn best from pictures, some from sounds, and some from 
moving around. You may have one way that works best for you, but chances 
are you can learn from all these approaches. So, when you’re studying, mix 
it up a bit. Draw pictures, talk out loud, act out processes using the objects 
on your desk, or get up and move around. Also, relate the information you’re 
learning to your own life or things you’ve heard in the news. The more neu-
rons you can engage while you’re studying, the better your understanding is 
likely to be.
Get Creative with Memory Tricks
Molecular and cellular biology is full of new terms and processes you’ll need 
to learn. There’s really just no way around it. One way you can help yourself 
is to make up words or sayings to help trigger your memory of terms and 
events. For example, way, way, back in the fourth grade, I learned HOMES 
to represent the Great Lakes of the United States. To this day, I still know 
HOMES represents Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, and Superior. You can 
make up your own memory tricks, borrow them from friends, or look online.

Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Recognize the Difference Between 
Levels of Understanding
If you’re taking a course in molecular and cellular biology, then you’re prob-
ably not an expert in the subject. To get from beginner to expert, you’ll need 
to do a lot of learning on different levels. And, you need to be prepared to be 
tested at various levels of understanding. If you want to get a full overview of 
what the different levels are, look up Bloom’s Taxonomy online at www.odu.
edu/educ/roverbau/Bloom/blooms_taxonomy.htm. Here’s my shorter 
version with some tips on how to recognize different types of questions:
 
✓ Recall factual information. You’ll need to learn lots of terms for differ-
ent structures and processes in molecular and cellular biology. Before 
you can move on to higher levels or even understand your instructor, 
you need to learn the language of the subject. You’ll be tested at this 
level by questions that ask what things are. Key phrases to look for are 
“name,” “what are,” “state,” and so on.
 
✓ Describe processes. Recalling processes is a little bit harder than just 
learning terms. You’ll have to learn all the events, plus the order in 
which they occur. You’ll be tested at this level by questions that ask 
how things work. Key phrases to look for are “describe,” “explain how,” 
or “identify the mechanism” (how something works).
 
✓ Make connections to the big picture. If you understand why some-
thing is important, you can relate it to the real world and other topics 
in biology. You’ll be tested at this level by questions that ask you why 
something is the way it is. Key phrases to look for are “what is the sig-
nificance,” “why,” or “what is the importance.”
 
✓ Apply information to solve new problems. Application questions are 
often word problems, where you’re given a scenario and asked to use 
what you’ve learned to solve a problem. Sometimes these questions will 
surprise you because they aren’t phrased exactly like something you’ve 
heard in lecture. When tackling these questions, underline key informa-
tion in the problem and ignore any extra details. (Key phrases to look 
for are “apply” and “solve.”)
Remember the Supporting Material
Textbooks come with lots of supporting materials these days — CDs, Web 
sites, practice tests, student study guides, and more. (Not like the days when 
I was an undergrad and had to walk 10 miles barefoot in the snow to get to 
class and copy lecture notes down on a slate!) Some of these materials are 
very good and useful.

353
 Chapter 23: Ten Ways to Improve Your Grade
 
The supporting materials that came with your text were probably written by 
someone other than the textbook author and may not be at the same level as 
your course. For example, many practice tests seem heavy on recall-type 
questions and very skimpy on higher order questions. If a practice test is 
heavy on recall, but your instructor tests at a higher level, the practice test 
may give you a false sense of confidence before an exam. You should defi-
nitely take advantage of whatever materials come with your text, but you need 
to evaluate them carefully first!
Test Yourself Often
The big test day will come, and you’ll get a permanent grade. Before you get 
to that crucial moment, make sure that you’ve put yourself through your 
paces in a less stressful situation. Test yourself during study sessions and 
get together with other students in the class if possible to test each other. 
Make sure that when you test yourself, you’re working at all levels of under-
standing. (See the earlier section “Recognize the Difference Between Levels of 
Understanding.)
 
If your instructor releases old exams, use them as practice tests after you’ve 
studied the material and think you’re ready.
In addition, keep these pointers in mind:
 
✓ Flash cards are good for memorizing factual information. Write a term 
or process on one side of the card and the meaning on the other side. 
Write things in your own words and practice saying things different 
ways. You can’t count on your instructor to always use the exact same 
phrase!
 
✓ Making diagrams and drawings are good ways to practice processes. 
Make sure that you label your pictures to explain what is going on. 
Sketching your own diagrams on a blank piece of paper is much better 
practice than reviewing the same figure from the book over and over. 
Look online for animations, too! 
 
✓ Textbooks and instructors are usually pretty good at highlighting the 
big ideas. The bold topics or questions at the beginning of sections 
usually point to the main concept being covered. Check your notes for 
things your instructor emphasized as “big ideas” or “really important.” 
Compare any lab activities you did to what was said in lecture and make 
connections between lecture and lab. Also review any real-world con-
nections you made while studying.

354
Part VII: The Part of Tens 
Use Your First Test as a Diagnostic Tool
You won’t really know how your instructor tests until you take your first test, 
unless you’ve had him in the past (or know someone that has). Some instruc-
tors include recall questions in their tests, while others just write problems 
for you to solve. (Some instructors release old exams, which give you a great 
preview of what’s coming!)
Your first test is a very valuable piece of information. When you get your 
graded test, go over it and look for the types of questions your instructor 
asked. At what level were you tested? Pay particular attention to any ques-
tions you missed and ask yourself why you missed it. What type of question 
was it — recall, concept, application? Where was the information? Does your 
instructor test only off notes? Or does he test on concepts in the book that 
he didn’t cover in class? Is information learned in lab covered on exams?
Also look at how you did on the different types of questions. Did you do okay 
on recall questions, but miss questions that asked you how things worked? 
Or did you get any questions based on lecture, but miss those based on read-
ings or labs?
 
The more you know about what to expect, the more you can tailor your study 
sessions to fit your instructor. Study smarter, not longer!
Get Help Sooner Rather Than Later
If you’re doing your best to actively follow along in lecture and you’re not get-
ting it, go for help right away even if it’s the first day of class! The longer you 
wait to get help, the greater the chance that you’ll accumulate low grades on 
assignments. Even if you get help eventually, those low grades will continue 
to pull you down. Learning is usually cumulative, so if you don’t understand 
early concepts, you won’t understand later concepts that build on them. So, 
get help at the first sign of trouble, rather than at the end of the class! Your 
instructor and teaching assistants have office hours; don’t be afraid to use 
them! Many schools have tutoring services as well.
