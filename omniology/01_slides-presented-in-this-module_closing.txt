The Setup… 
Suppose we are building a website with 
product recommendations,  
trained using user reviews. 
•  34.6M reviews 
•  2.4M products 
•  6.6M users

Updating ML models 
Why update? 
•  Trends and user tastes change over time 
•  Model performance drops 
When to update? 
•  Track statistics of data over time 
•  Monitor both oﬄine & online metrics 
•  Update when oﬄine metric diverges 
from online metrics or not achieving 
desired targets
