“I wish to God these calculations had been executed  
by steam,” Charles Babbage exclaimed, poring over a 
mistake-ﬁlled volume of mathematical tables. The year  
was 1821, when such books were the only help for  
number-crunchers. So Babbage set  
out to mechanize how these  
tables were produced, and 
along the way became the 
ﬁrst computing pioneer. 
Calculators and 
computers
Charles 
Babbage
Having taught himself algebra as  
a child, English inventor Charles 
Babbage (1791–1871) was a highly 
regarded mathematician by his twenties. 
In 1828, he was awarded the Lucasian  
Chair of Mathematics at Cambridge, a 
distinguished position held earlier by  
Sir Isaac Newton. Babbage would later 
invent lighthouse signaling devices and 
cowcatchers for steam trains. He also 
became a master code maker and 
breaker and an expert economist. 
Did you 
know? 
For more than 2,000 years, 
the abacus was the only 
common and reliable means 
of making calculations  
using a machine. 
The Difference  
Engine
In 1823, the British government  
gave Babbage the go-ahead to start  
work on a machine for calculating 
mathematical tables. He designed two 
giant calculators, called Difference 
Engines, the ﬁrst of which (left) required 
25,000 iron and brass parts! With no 
electricity, both machines were 
designed to be powered  
by hand. 

“Babbage’s reputation has been 
vindicated, both as a visionary of 
the computer age and, more 
speciﬁcally, as an engineer of the 
most extraordinary caliber.”
Doron Swade, curator of the Science Museum, London
Birth of 
the computer
In the 1830s, Babbage 
abandoned his ﬁrst Difference 
Engine to devote his attention to  
an even more ambitious plan, as shown in 
this complex design from 1840 (left). His 
steam-driven, mechanical Analytical Engine 
was to be a general purpose “computer,” 
capable of all kinds of calculations, and 
directed by programmed instructions. 
Conceived decades before the invention of 
electronics, it was utterly revolutionary 
and uncannily like the design of 
modern computers. 
The countess
Daughter of the poet Lord Byron, 
English mathematician Augusta Ada 
King, Countess of Lovelace, ﬁrst met 
Babbage in 1833. Translating an article 
about his work in 1842–3, her notes 
included algorithms (instructions for 
solving mathematical problems) that 
effectively make her one of the ﬁrst 
programmers. A 1979 computer 
language was named Ada  
in her honor. 
Did you  
know? 
Almost 200 years after Babbage 
was born, the Science Museum  
in London built his second 
Difference Engine using the 
original blueprints. It has 
more than 4,000 parts, and 
what’s more, it works!
Failure
Babbage’s engines 
were not completed in his 
lifetime. The sheer ambition of 
his designs, his perfectionism, 
disputes over costs, a struggle for 
funds, and problems engineering 
the highly accurate parts required 
(above) were the main reasons for 
this failure. “Another age must 
be the judge,” Babbage 
admitted.
The Analytical Engine was never actually 
made. If it had been, it would have been 
programmable using punched cards. 
1 The “mill” was the central processor where 
arithmetic was performed. It retrieved and 
executed instructions and data from  
the “store” just like a modern computer.
1 The “store” was the 
engine’s expandable memory, 
capable of holding results and 
data during calculations.  
1 Results could be sent 
to the engine’s own printer 
and graph plotter or onto 
punched cards.

Did you know? 
To ﬁgure out which type of  
wire to use to build ENIAC,  
J. Presper Eckert starved lab rats 
for a few days. Then he gave 
them samples of different types of 
cable to determine which they 
gnawed through the least. 
It is 1947, and the world’s  
ﬁrst general-purpose electronic 
computer is at work, churning 
through top secret calculations 
for the American hydrogen  
bomb program. Dubbed the  
“great brain” by the press, the 
Electronic Numerical Integrator 
and Computer (ENIAC) weighed 
in at 60,000 lb (27,000 kg) and 
consumed as much power  
as 15,000 iPads. At the 
machine’s heart lay vacuum 
tubes—electrical components 
able to act as switches (that 
break or make electrical circuits) 
or amplify switches. A radio of 
the time might contain 10 
vacuum tubes, but this beast 
boasted 17,468 of them. 
The great brain
Building ENIAC
J. Presper Eckert (right) was 
just out of his teens when he and  
Dr. John Mauchly began work on 
ENIAC. Completed in 1945, ENIAC 
ran for a decade. Eckert and 
Mauchly also formed their own 
company to produce UNIVAC I, 
the ﬁrst computer to go on sale to 
the public in the United States. 
Massive machine
No wonder ENIAC took three years  
to build. It was 98 ft (30 m) long, 
more than 10 ft (3 m) high, and  
3 ft (1 m) deep. Its 40 front panels, 
which were arranged in a U shape, 
required hundreds of thousands  
of hand-soldered joints. 

Women’s work
Six female mathematicians 
programmed ENIAC. Their  
job title was “Computer.” 
Although ENIAC worked 
quickly, changing its program 
could be tedious because its 
panels had to be rewired,  
a process that could take  
up to two days. 
Shrunk on silicon
From ENIAC onward, computers 
advanced rapidly and their speed 
accelerated as their components 
shrank in size. In 1997, students  
at the University of Pennsylvania 
re-created ENIAC on just one 
silicon chip (left). While ENIAC  
could perform 5,000 operations  
per second, an Intel Core Duo chip 
today can manage 21.6 billion.

“We’re ﬂooding people 
with information. We 
need to feed it through a
processor. A human must 
turn information into 
intelligence or knowledge. 
We’ve tended to forget 
that no computer will 
ever ask a new question.”
Did you know? 
Hopper popularized the 
terms “bug” and “debugging” 
(to remove errors in computer 
code) after an incident when 
a moth was trapped inside 
part of a computer  
at Harvard.
Grace Hopper 
A gifted mathematician, Grace Hopper (1906–92) joined 
the navy during World War II. There, she became the 
ﬁrst woman to program the Harvard Mark I,  
a pioneering computer based at Harvard University. 
Then, in 1949, Hopper joined the Eckert-Mauchly 
Corporation and worked on the ﬁrst commercial 
computer, UNIVAC I. Her greatest contributions, 
however, came in the 1950s. She developed the ﬁrst 
compilers, progams that made programming far easier, 
and also worked on the ﬁrst high-level computer 
language for business, the Common Business-Oriented 
Language (COBOL), still in use today.

Evolution 
of the 
computer
Computers took a  
long time coming. They 
developed out of centuries 
of attempts at getting 
machines to help perform 
complex calculations. 
A burst of innovation 
before, during, and after 
World War II led to the 
arrivals of the jet engine, 
the atomic bomb, and the 
first practical computers. 
In the decades since then, 
computers have advanced 
at a spectacular rate.

A vision of  
the future
Every time you use a mouse to click on a link to a new web page, 
you have American electrical engineer Douglas Engelbart to 
thank. Engelbart was an early computer pioneer. As far back as 
1951, he imagined screens with information ﬂowing between 
them, and people navigating the screens to learn, form, and 
organize their ideas. Sounds familiar? He could be describing the 
Internet and hypertext—text with active links to other pages.
New controls 
In the early 1950s, very few 
computers existed, and they were 
controlled by experts and engineers 
using punched cards or rewiring 
circuits. Engelbart’s vision 
demanded faster, simpler, more 
natural ways of working. His team 
developed cursors that could be 
dragged around the screen. They 
also experimented with chorded 
keysets (keyboards), where pressing 
down different combinations of ﬁve 
pianolike keys created commands.
Douglas Engelbart 
Born in 1925, Engelbart studied electrical 
engineering. In 1957 he joined the Stanford Research 
Institute (SRI) in California, where he was later 
given his own research lab. There, his team 
developed the revolutionary oNLine System (NLS). 
This allowed up to 16 workstations to operate 
together, running programs with multiple windows 
between which text and objects could move. 
Did you know? 
During World War II, the 
young Engelbart worked  
as a radar technician for the  
navy. His knowledge of how 
radar information was 
displayed on-screen inspired 
his 1951 vision of how 
hypertext might work.

The mother of all demos
At a conference in 1968, Engelbart gave a 
demonstration to 1,000 computer experts 
that would make them think about 
computers in a totally new way. In what 
became known as the “mother of all 
demos,” his presentation included: 
1 Documents being edited in multiple 
windows by different people on  
different computers. 
1 The computer mouse, word processing, 
instant messaging, and hypertext 
between documents, ﬁles, and programs.
1 Real-time video conferencing 
between Engelbart and employees at his 
laboratory approximately 37 miles  
(60 km) away (above).

First mouse
In 1963, Engelbart and a colleague,  
Bill English, invented the ﬁrst computer 
mouse. The name came from the 
tail-like cable that ran from the back  
of the wooden box. Known more 
formally as an “X-Y position indicator 
for a display system,” the device had  
a single click switch and two metal 
wheels positioned at 90-degree angles  
to each other that kept track of 
up-and-down and side-to-side 
movement. Computer mice only 
became popular 20 years later. 
“Computer technology is going 
to blossom so spectacularly, and 
hit our society so hard, that I am 
both thrilled and frightened... 
Imagine what it might be like  
to have information-handling 
‘horsepower’ available for  
your personal use.”
Douglas Engelbart, 1961
Inspirational teacher 
Engelbart’s work has won more than 30 awards, including 
the $500,000 Lemelson–MIT Prize (1997) and the National 
Medal of Technology (2000), which was presented by 
President Bill Clinton. Over his career, Engelbart inﬂuenced 
many other computing pioneers, including those he 
collaborated with on early Internet projects. Some of 
Engelbart’s employees went on to the Xerox PARC 
research facility, where they developed the ﬁrst graphical 
user interfaces, allowing users to interact with systems by 
clicking on icons instead of typing in commands.

Early home 
computing
In the mid-1970s, only a handful of electronics 
enthusiasts owned computers, which they had 
built from kits. Then, starting in the late 1970s, 
affordable microcomputers gave millions of people 
their ﬁrst direct taste of computing. The boom 
spawned numerous cottage industries in computer 
books, magazines, software, and games. 
ZX81 D
In 1981, British inventor Clive Sinclair 
released the ZX81. It had a mere 1 KB 
of memory, featured a barely usable 
keyboard, and had to be hooked up to 
a television to display its black-and-
white text and rudimentary graphics, 
but it was a revelation. The ZX81’s 
launch price was just £69.99 in the 
UK and $99.99 in the United States. 
Computers had never been  
so affordable before.
J Spectrum
Sinclair’s successor to the ZX81, the 
Spectrum, released in 1982, had a 
rubber-key keyboard, 16 or 48 KB of 
memory, and color graphics. It was  
still primitive, but a growing band  
of computer enthusiasts wrote  
all kinds of software for it, including 
games, such as Horace Goes Skiing 
and Chuckie Egg, and astronomy 
and accounting packages.
Commodore 64 D
By 1982, the home-computer market 
was starting to mature. One of the 
most popular computers of the time 
was the Commodore 64. The C64 
had a full keyboard, a then-enormous 
64 KB of internal memory, a built-in 
sound synthesizer, and more 
advanced graphics than any  
of its rivals.
J BASIC
Computer owners of the 1970s  
and early ’80s often wrote their  
own programs using an instruction 
language known as BASIC. It had 
easy-to-learn commands, such as 
IF-THEN decision statements and 
GOTO to navigate to a numbered line  
of program code. Many of today’s  
tech experts learned their trade on this 
surprisingly ﬂexible computer language. 
TRS-80 D
Priced at $600 and including a 
black-and-white monitor, the TRS-80 
went on sale in 3,000 Radio Shack and 
Tandy stores in December 1977. More 
than 400,000 machines were sold, 
along with business software such as 
Payroll and Statistical Analysis, and, 
of course, games. A color version of 
the computer, the TRS-80 CoCo, 
followed three years later.

Dot-matrix printer D
! IBM PC
The ﬁrst IBM (International Business 
Machines) personal computer, the 
model 5150, arrived in 1981. Launch 
prices in the United States ranged from 
$1,565 to $3,000. The 5150 stored data 
on cassettes or ﬂoppy disks, boasting an 
Intel processor and the Microsoft Disk 
Operating System (MS-DOS), designed 
by Bill Gates. The computer was 
powerful enough for small businesses as 
well as personal use.
J Acoustic coupler
Few home computers went online in 
the early 1980s. The acoustic coupler 
was one of the ﬁrst devices that made 
it possible. It converted computer 
data into audio signals that could  
be sent and received on a phone  
line. Most couplers ran at a speed  
of about 300 bits per second—at that 
rate, downloading a 9 MB music ﬁle 
would have taken almost 3 days!
J Floppy drives
Many early home computers relied 
on audio cassette tapes to store  
and load programs. However,  
a cassette recorder could take  
5 to 10 minutes to load a single 
program into memory. Floppy disks, 
developed by IBM in 1971, offered 
far more convenient storage. They 
were ﬂat magnetic disks, protected 
by a ﬂexible plastic cover.
Despite the noisy clatter it made 
during operation, the dot-matrix 
printer was the must-have 
computing accessory of the early 
1980s. Characters were formed 
from a series of tightly packed dots 
printed by pins striking an ink 
ribbon. Compared to today’s 
printers, however, output was slow 
(50 to 300 characters per second).

Connectivity
The laptop can be connected to 
external devices such as speakers, 
printers, and cameras via a range  
of ports (sockets). A built-in card 
reader allows users to transfer data 
and images using memory cards.
1 Shell
The outer casing of this computer is 
molded from plastic, though others 
are formed from light metals such as 
aluminum. Reducing weight and bulk 
are priorities in the design of laptops, 
so many, like this one, come without  
a built-in DVD drive.
2 LCD Screen
Computer screens are measured 
diagonally and in inches. This laptop 
has an 11.6 in (29.4 cm) screen and is 
a liquid crystal display (LCD), backlit 
by a lamp shining through the liquid 
cells out towards the user.
3 Keyboard
All computers need input devices for 
users to enter data or commands. 
Keys on a keyboard are switches, 
completing an electrical circuit when 
they are pressed, sending that key’s 
signal to the processor.
4 Motherboard
The main circuit board houses the 
body of the computer—its central 
processor, internal system memory, 
system clock, and, if the machine has 
integrated graphics, the graphics 
processors that handle the display.
5 Hard Drive
These magnetic storage devices are 
made up of a series of thin metal 
plates attached to a spindle and 
electric motor that spins them around 
at high speed, ranging from 5,400 to 
10,000 revolutions per minute.
6 Heat Sink
The processor in a computer 
generates a lot of heat, that can 
threaten performance and reliability. 
A heat sink transfers much of the  
heat away from the processor into the 
surrounding air, sometimes assisted 
by a cooling fan.
7 Battery
The single heaviest part of most 
portable computers, a notebook’s 
battery is rechargeable. This six-cell 
lithium-ion battery powers the 
machine for up to seven hours.

Laptop
Laptops and their smaller, lighter, and usually less 
powerful cousins, netbooks, allow people to keep in 
touch, work, learn, or play when on the move. They take 
up little space, yet the most powerful can compete in 
performance with many far-bulkier desktop machines. 
Early portable computers with only a fraction of the 
capability of a modern machine often weighed more 
than 22 lb (10 kg). The Acer Aspire One 751 featured 
here weighs a mere 2.7 lb (1.25 kg).

RAM
Random access memory (RAM) is  
a circuit that holds data and gives  
the computer’s processor, and any 
running programs, their own area in 
which to perform and store processes 
and data.
Components
Processor
A CPU (central processing unit) is  
the computer’s brain. It is capable of 
performing the machine’s calculations 
at rates measured in millions per 
second. The Atom Z520 processor 
used in the Aspire One is common  
in many small, lightweight netbooks.

A computer network involves two or more 
computers, known as nodes, linked so that they 
can communicate electronically with each other. 
Networks can be wired, with cables physically 
connecting the computers, or wireless, 
with radio waves or satellite signals 
linking them. Once connected, 
computers can exchange data,  
including sound and image ﬁles. 
Networks
Home networks
A typical home computer network might 
consist of two or three PCs that share a 
printer, scanner, or a large hard drive for 
backup storage. Each device has its own 
network address so that other devices 
can identify and communicate with it 
using rules called protocols. 
ISPs
In return for a monthly or annual fee, an 
Internet Service Provider (ISP) provides 
millions of businesses and homes with 
Internet access via telephone, cable, or 
satellite links. The ﬁrst public ISP was 
TheWorld, which was started in 1989 in 
Brookline, Massachusetts.
LANs and WANs
A typical ofﬁce has a number of machines 
networked over a small area. The above 
ofﬁce LAN (Local Area Network) may use 
a router to connect to other nearby LANs. 
A number of LANs may connect to form  
a WAN (Wide Area Network), which 
operates over great distances.

Satellites
Satellites orbiting the Earth can relay data to 
and from computers to enable access to the 
Internet. This is particularly valuable in rural 
communities with no access to cable 
networks. All users need is a dish placed in 
unobstructed view of the skyline in order to 
access the Internet directly.
Around the world
The Internet is the biggest WAN of all.  
It consists of vast numbers of networks—
from small LANs to huge academic  
or governmental networks—all linked 
together using common protocols. Many 
ISPs’ networks interconnect at locations 
called access points or Internet exchanges.
Cybercafes
The ﬁrst Internet café opened in San 
Francisco in 1991. For a purchase of food 
or drink or a small fee, cybercafes offer use 
of a computer connected to the Internet,  
or a Wi-Fi hotspot for your own PC. In 
countries with low computer ownership, 
most people access the Net in cafés.
Server network
The computers in this school network are 
linked to a central computer, called a 
server, which controls some tasks, such as 
printing, on behalf of the other computers, 
called clients. This is a client-server 
network. An alternative is a peer-to-peer 
network where all the computers perform 
the same range of tasks.
 
Did you  
know? 
The ﬁrst “Internet café in a 
box” was installed in Zambia 
by the Computer Aid charity 
in 2010. A shipping container 
was ﬁtted with 11 computers 
powered by solar panels  
on the container’s roof.

PCs to malware.

World Wide Web
Inventing the
On December 25, 1990, Tim Berners-Lee set a new 
task for a computer at the European Organization 
for Nuclear Research (CERN) laboratory in 
Switzerland. The computer was a prototype 
web server. It hosted the world’s first web
page, which described the World Wide Web 
and showed others how to start their own 
websites. Before this event, the Internet 
was the mostly text-based domain of 
scientists and other academics. 
Did you  
know? 
In a 2009 interview in the 
London Times, Berners-Lee 
admitted that the “//” (two 
forward slashes) in web 
addresses had not really 
been necessary. “There you 
go—it seemed like a good 
idea at the time,” he joked.
Early education
Tim Berners-Lee was born in England in 1955. His 
parents, Conway and Mary Berners-Lee, had met three 
years earlier at Ferranti, where they both worked as 
mathematicians on the Mark 1 computer. Tim studied 
physics at Oxford, where he built his own ﬁrst computer 
from some logic gates, an M6800 processor, and old 
television parts. Berners-Lee followed his parents’ 
footsteps and began working as a software consultant 
at CERN in 1980. 
ENQUIRE
In 1980, Berners-Lee wrote a program called ENQUIRE 
for use inside CERN to track the connections between 
different people and projects using hyperlinks (see pages 
16–17). Ten years later, he would use similar principles  
to create a web of hyperlinked documents on the  
Internet—the World Wide Web. This was ﬁrst hosted on  
a single computer on which Berners-Lee scrawled on the 
back: “This machine is a server. Do not power it down.”

The invention of the Web
Browsers
One boost to the early World Wide Web was the 
development of new, more user- and graphics-friendly 
browser programs (see panel, right). Marc Andreessen 
and colleagues at the University of Illinois developed the 
Mosaic browser, which became available in 1993. Mosaic 
helped popularize browsing, and the number of websites 
started to mushroom. 
Web explosion
The World Wide Web became available 
over the Internet in August 1991, with 
just one server hosting a single website. 
Ten years later, there were 36 million 
websites and, by 2011, more than 250 
million. This boom was helped early on 
by CERN’s decision to make the World 
Wide Web free for use by everyone. 
W3C
In 1994, Berners-Lee moved to head  
the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C),  
a group devoted to improving the Web. 
He campaigned hard to keep the Web 
open and free. Nearly 20 years later, he 
is still a director of the W3C, as well as a 
respected advisor and researcher for 
governments and academic bodies.

In the late 1980s, Berners-Lee proposed building a 
hyperlink-based information system for use over the 
Internet. Working with a Belgian computer engineer, 
Robert Cailliau (above left, displaying the ﬁrst server 
computer in the museum at CERN) and others, 
Berners-Lee had to assemble a number of different 
elements to get the World Wide Web up and running:
1 HTML  Berners-Lee needed a standard language 
to create hypertext documents that could be retrieved 
and viewed on different computers all over the world. 
The answer was hypertext markup language (HTML), 
which uses tags as instructions, allowing pages to 
display different text sizes and colors, along with 
pictures and other ﬁles. 
1 HTTP  The team developed the hypertext transfer 
protocol (HTTP), a system that allowed computers to 
send hypertext documents over the Internet.
1 Browser  Berners-Lee and his colleagues created 
the ﬁrst web browser—a program that could ﬁnd, 
retrieve, and view hypertext documents. Initially 
called “WorldWideWeb,” it was renamed “Nexus” to 
avoid confusion with the Web itself. 
1 Web server  The software that stores web pages on 
a computer and makes them available to others—a 
server—had to be created. In 1990, Berners-Lee set up 
the ﬁrst web server at CERN with the address “http://
info.cern.ch.”
“The Web as I envisaged it, we have not 
seen it yet. The future is still so much 
bigger than the past.”  
Tim Berners-Lee, 2009

Did you know? 
When the ﬁrst transatlantic  
ﬁber-optic cables were laid in  
the 1980s, they attracted sharks,  
resulting in severed cables and 
electrocuted sharks. The cables  
were quickly enclosed in  
a protective casing. 
In a secret location, buried  
6 ft (2 m) beneath the sands of  
a beach—possibly this beach—
in Cornwall, on the western  
tip of England, lies a $400 million 
cable not much thicker than a 
garden hose. This high-capacity 
Internet cable links New York 
and London, the busiest hubs in 
the world. In fact, around 90 
percent of global Internet trafﬁc 
is carried by a vast cable 
network that snakes over land 
and sea, with more than 500,000 
miles (800,000 km) of cable 
found underwater. 
Undersea cables
High speed  
It takes a fraction of a second for 
data to travel the 7,600-mile (12,200 
km) round trip from England to the 
United States. About every 30 miles 
(49 km) or so, the signals get a 
boost from ampliﬁer devices called 
repeaters. Each repeater costs 
around $1.5 million. 
Top secret
The location of the British beach the 
cable passes under is a secret. The 
cabling station, just set back from the 
beach, does not appear on any map.

Making repairs
The robot below is being 
lowered into the sea where it 
will crawl the seabed repairing 
damaged cables. In 2009, 
millions of Internet users in 
India saw their connections 
wiped out after a ship’s anchor 
cut a cable. If a cable breaks, 
data is usually rerouted until 
repairs are completed. 
Fiber optics
Bundled inside the main transatlantic 
cable, the OALC-4 SPDA, are eight 
ﬁber-optic cables, each the width of  
a single human hair and with enough 
bandwidth for 20 million people. In the 
United States, the cables emerge from 
beneath the Atlantic Ocean at a vast 
server center that channels the data 
to around 150 countries.

tiny part of the vast ﬂow of data over worldwide Internet 
networks. The measure of how much data can be sent over 
a network at once is called the bandwidth of the connection. 
As more and more people get connected, Internet trafﬁc 
continues to rise. In 2009 alone, it increased by 74 percent, 
and then by an additional 62 percent in 2010. The Internet’s 
infrastructure must continue to grow to cope with this 
ever-increasing demand.

The United States alone has 4.5 percent of the 
world’s population but around 22 percent of the 
world’s broadband users. The region has more 
than half the world’s international bandwidth 
and acts as a global Internet hub from which 
data spins off around the world.
Asia-Paciﬁc
With more than 200 million of the world’s 500 million 
broadband (high-speed Internet) subscribers, Asia’s Internet 
use is growing fast, putting more pressure on the region’s 
Internet infrastructure. A new 12,500-mile (20,000 km) long 
cable opened in 2009, generating more than one terabit- 
per-second of extra capacity from Hawaii to Hong Kong and 
Southeast Asia.

Latin America and Caribbean
Between 2006 and 2010, this region’s international 
Internet trafﬁc grew by approximately 71 percent 
each year. At the current time, most of its data  
travels between the countries in the region, or to 
North America before being routed to other regions 
around the world.
Africa
Africa is the continent with the smallest fraction 
of its people online (less than 9.5 percent). Few 
African cities boast the capacity of cities in 
other regions. New cables are being laid to 
increase Africa’s capacity but with people 
spread over great distance, wireless 
technologies may be more effective.
Europe
With great demand in many of its countries, 
three-quarters of Europe’s Internet capacity is 
used internally. Although trafﬁc between Asia 
and North America is increasing fast, the biggest 
transregional trafﬁc ﬂow in the world is between 
Europe and North America.
Around 90 percent of all Internet trafﬁc 
between North America and Latin America 
goes through one building in downtown 
Miami. The Terremark data center is an 
Internet exchange ﬁlled with thousands of 
server computers. They are protected by 
round-the-clock security and 7 in (18 cm) thick

Silicon 
Valley
It all started here. A stretch of land south of San 
Francisco, California, became home to the greatest 
concentration of computing and high-tech 
pioneers ever known. Named Silicon Valley, after 
the material that is used in computer electronics, 
the headquarters of many huge Internet and 
computing companies are found in the area. 
J Intel
Intel was founded by  
three former Fairchild 
engineers in 1968 to build 
memory chips. By 1992,  
Intel was the world’s largest 
semiconductor company, 
famous for supplying  
the processor chips  
inside IBM PCs.
Apples to Apple 
Once full of apple orchards and known as 
“The Valley of Heart’s Delight,” the Silicon 
Valley region includes the Santa Clara 
Valley and the city of San Jose. In the 
1950s, several high-tech companies 
moved their research bases to the area, 
and a group of engineers formed Fairchild 
Semiconductor, which pioneered 
computer-circuit technology. By 1972, 
more than 60 electronics companies were 
based in the valley, most formed by 
ex-Fairchild employees. Four years later, 
Apple made its home here, too.
J Hewlett Packard (HP)
In 1938, two Stanford 
engineering graduates, Bill 
Hewlett and Dave Packard, 
began work in this garage 
in Palo Alto. HP is now one 
of the largest information 
technology companies. 
Seat of learning
Famous for its technical and 
scientiﬁc innovation, Stanford 
University in Palo Alto, California, 
was formed in 1891 and 
established the Stanford Research 
Institute (SRI) in 1946 to build 
technology ties with local 
business. Many Silicon Valley 
legends would pass through either 
the university or SRI before 
forming their own start-ups.

J SanDisk
In 1988, the memory-card 
and USB-ﬂash-drive giant 
SanDisk was founded by 
an Israeli scientist and  
a former Intel employee

PARC D
In 1970, Xerox opened the 
Palo Alto Research Center 
(PARC), a high-tech research 
and development base. 
Optical discs, laser printing, 
and user interfaces such  
as Windows all ﬁrst 
came from this Silicon  
Valley–based think tank. 
Heavy hitters 
Dozens of high-tech 
companies have bases in 
Silicon Valley, from Adobe 
to Yahoo! This is partly due 
to ex-employees of one 
company forming their own 
nearby, such as former 
Apple employee Trip 
Hawkins, who went on to 
found Electronic Arts, one 
of the ﬁrst home-computer-
game companies, in 1982.
Adobe D
Adobe was formed in 1982 
by two PARC researchers 
who developed the key 
language for printers. Seven 
years later, Adobe released 
the image-editing software 
Photoshop. In 1993, Adobe 
introduced the famous  
PDF ﬁle format.
 J Facebook
Facebook began as a 
social networking site 
used by students of 
Harvard University. In 
2004, it moved west and 
made its headquarters  
in Palo Alto.
eBay D
Pierre Omidyar was 
working as a software 
engineer in Silicon Valley 
when he began this 
Internet-auction website 
at his home in San Jose. 
eBay’s headquarters 
remain in the city.
J Yahoo!
In 1994, two Stanford 
University students 
created a website called 
“David and Jerry’s Guide 
to the World Wide Web.” 
This became Yahoo!, 
which made a proﬁt of 
$598 million in 2009.
SUN Microsystems D
In 1982, SUN (named after 
the Stanford University 
Network) began by 
making computers. In 
1995, SUN produced the 
Java computer language, 
now one of the most 
widely used computer 
programming languages.
Symantec D
Gary Hendrix worked at SRI 
before founding a company 
that became Symantec, the 
makers of Norton AntiVirus

How 
Apple 
grew
Founded by Steve Jobs, Steve 
Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne on  
April 1 1976, Apple has grown from a 
tiny start-up in a California bedroom 
to a global brand that employs more 
than 46,000 people. In 2010, the 
company boasted profits of $14 
billion. Famous  
for their design and 
innovation, Apple 
products have helped 
revolutionize the 
computing, music,  
and phone industries.

What’s 
behind a 
website?
A website is a collection of documents called web pages, 
which contain text, images, and links to other web pages. 
Most websites are created using a code called Hypertext 
Markup Language (HTML). There is software that sets up  
a website structure to which the user adds text and images. 
HTML was developed by British Web pioneer Tim 
Berners-Lee and, with revisions, is still the most common 
way to format text and images to form a web page. HTML 
provides a wide range of coded commands, known as 
tags, that allow users to format text, insert photos, 
graphics, or multimedia ﬁles, and build tables of 
information. Links must also be established between  
the website’s own pages.
Language of the Web
Once you have a website you need a web hosting company 
to host it on a server, making it available 24/7. You also need 
an Internet connection to upload your pages to the server 
and a name. This consists of a top-level domain name after 
the dot (such as .com) and your website title.
What else do you need?
Selecting “view source” 
in a browser reveals 
the HTML code
The web page’s 
main content 
begins here
Instructs the 
browser to open 
 a new window
Images are 
hyperlinked to 
another web page
 This code tells the 
website which 
image to display
Browsers
A web browser is an application that gives 
you access to the Web. It translates HTML 
tags to display web pages on your computer. 
This laptop screen (right) displays a website’s 
home page and the HTML code used to create 
it. For a website to reach as many people as 
possible, its pages must be compatible with all 
the most popular browers.
The term “blog” comes from “web log”—a space online 
used like a diary or journal to post messages. It’s easy to 
start a blog. They are often part of a regular website, and 
there are also dedicated blog hosts. All you have to do is 
sign up. Blogs are regularly updated and most are 
interactive, allowing visitors to leave comments.

Search engine

The Internet is beyond enormous. Billions of web pages,  
many of which are unhelpfully entitled “page 1” or “home,”  
sit on web servers that also have technical or cryptic names  
and are impossible to ﬁnd by yourself. Search engines cut 
through all of this complexity to provide you with a series  
of results to your requests for information. Their value and 
importance to Internet users has skyrocketed, turning the most 
successful into enormous businesses, handling vast amounts  
of data. In 1998, Google handled around 10,000 search queries  
per day. In 2010, that ﬁgure had risen to more than a billion.
What do search 
engines do?
Search Engine Share
Worldwide, Google dominates the search engine market to 
a spectacular extent. In January 2011, NetMarketShare 
reported that while Yahoo! had 6.14, Bing 3.68, and 
Baidu 2.92 percent of global market share, Google’s 
search engines accounted for 85.37 percent. In a 
handful of countries, however, locally produced search 
engines still outrank Google. These include Naver in 
South Korea and Yandex in Russia, while in the Czech 
Republic, Google is locked in an ongoing battle with 
Seznam.cz to be number one.

Engine explosion 
Before the World Wide Web, there were still search 
engines that looked for the names of ﬁles available 
over the Internet. One of the ﬁrst, and best-known, 
is Archie, created by Canadian student Alan 
Emtage in 1990. The mid-to-late 1990s saw a 
battle between search’s big beasts, including 
AltaVista, Lycos, Infoseek, Magellan, and Yahoo!, 
before Google rose to prominence.

Founded in 2000 by Robin Li and Eric Xu, 
Baidu is a Chinese-language search engine 
that continues to grow. Google spotted its 
potential in 2005 when it offered to buy it for 
$1.6 billion and was turned down. Baidu 
now indexes more than 740 million web 
pages and is responsible for 73 percent of 
the search requests made in China.
1 Baidu makes its money from advertising, 
including a system where advertisers bid  
to get their ads and links placed alongside 
certain search results. It 
has proven successful—
Baidu made a $599 million 
proﬁt in 2010.

competitive game. For a 
user to leave us and go to 
somebody else, it’s just 
one click.” —Kaiser Kuo,

Search algorithms 
The data in an index server is stored as a  
form of database. Each search engine uses  
a different method to search for a user’s 
keyword using a set of search rules called  
an algorithm. These are highly complex and 
involve dozens or sometimes hundreds of 
different elements. Search algorithms tend  
to be closely guarded trade secrets.

Off the page  
Many search engines perform 
off-page analysis of a web page, 
mainly looking at its links to 
other websites, their number, 
quality, and popularity, helping 
the search engine determine 
the importance of the page.
Search Engine 
Optimization (SEO)
There is ﬁerce competition to make it to the front page of 
search results, especially in common subjects such as 
music or shopping that may already be populated by 
thousands of rival websites. SEO experts use a variety of 
techniques, including adjusting a web page’s keywords 
and title, and fostering links to strong websites. Some 
also use “black hat techniques”—these frowned-upon 
methods include keyword stufﬁng (adding lots of popular 
keywords to a web page that aren’t relevant) and link 
farms (where hundreds of websites all link to every other 
web page), trying to give them a boost in the rankings.

Launched in 1998,  
UFOSeek.com is a search

Seek and ﬁnd 
When you type keywords into a search engine, your 
request is sent to the engine’s index, which seeks 
out matches among its masses of data, orders them 
according to their rank (see below), and then returns 
a series of results pages. All of this happens in a 
fraction of a second.

Web crawling
A search request accesses an enormous body of 
data stored on a search engine’s index servers. 
These indexes are compiled using automated 
computer scripts called crawlers. These crawl 
through the entire World Wide Web, scouring web 
pages and sending back their results to the index.

Ranking pages
No matter what algorithm is used, all search engines seek to 
rank web pages in order of their relevance to the search the 
user has requested. They do this by looking for the search 
keywords featured throughout each web page, but give 
greater weight to them when they occur in the title of the 
web page or in its headings. They also count the frequency 
with which the keyword appears on the page to assess how 
relevant the page is to the search.

Google Search
I’m feeling lucky
Who invented Google?
In 1995, 22-year-old Larry Page was shown around  
Stanford University by another student, Sergey Brin. The 
two disagreed on pretty much everything. However, the 
next year, when they ended up working together on a new 
search engine called BackRub, the two of them got along 
better. They also hit upon a winning formula that would 
soon become Google, the world’s most popular search 
engine. In 2009, Forbes magazine described Page and 
Brin as the ﬁfth-most-powerful people in the world. 
Web   Images   Videos   Maps   News   Shopping   Gmail   more 5

PageRank
Early search engines ranked web  
pages by how often the search term 
appeared on the page. Page and Brin’s 
PageRank system used in Google went 
much further. It analyzed the number, 
quality, and importance of other pages 
that linked to the web page to produce 
more accurate and useful search results.  
Today, PageRank is just one of more  
than 200 different factors that enable  
most Google searches to be fast,  
accurate, and relevant.
Growing fast 
Brin and Page renamed BackRub  
“Google” in 1997 and the following year 
formed a company. At ﬁrst, they operated 
out of a friend’s garage in Menlo Park, 
California, but Google grew quickly.  
In 2000, Brin and Page released 10 foreign-
language versions. In 2002, this grew to 72, 
one of which was in Klingon, the ﬁctional 
language from Star Trek. By this time, 
Google’s search index of more than  
a billion web pages made it the  
largest in the world. 
Branching out
In order to stay ahead of rivals  
and attract valuable advertising,  
Google continued to add new features, 
including news, book, and image searches.  
Google Maps arrived in 2005, while  
Google Chrome is one of the top two web 
browsers in many countries. Not all 
Google’s projects have been resounding 
successes. Google Answers, Google  
Lively (a 3-D virtual world), and Google 
Wave (a social networking site) didn’t 
attract enough of a following  
and were shut down. 
Sergey Brin D
Sergey’s father was a  
math professor and his 
mother was a space 
scientist. He was born in 
Moscow but left Russia for 
the United States at the age 
of six. Brin has donated more 
than $4 million to a 
space-tourism company. 
Larry Page D
Larry’s parents were both 
computer-science professors. 
While studying computer 
science himself at the 
University of Michigan, Page 
built an ink-jet plotter-printer 
out of Lego bricks. He and 
Brin co-own a Boeing 767 
aircraft as well as two 
business jets.

20-percent time
Google allows its employees to spend  
up to a ﬁfth of their work week on special pet 
projects. Brin and Page believe that if an 
engineer is passionate about a project, it has 
the best chance of being a success. Google 
News, the Orkut social networking site, and 
Gmail, which has more than 146 million  
users, are three successful applications 
created by Google staff using  
20-percent time. 
The Googleplex 
Google has ofﬁces in more than  
50 locations, but its headquarters is in 
Mountain View, California. Long hours and 
hard work are part of Googleplex life, but 
there’s plenty of fun to be had as well. 
There are weekly roller hockey matches  
in the parking lot, and the buildings  
also boast a gym, two swimming  
pools, pool tables, beach volleyball  
courts, a giant dinosaur skeleton, more 
than a dozen cafés, and even an adult-
sized rubber-ball pit.
“Don’t be evil!” 
 
The informal motto of Google, which aims  
to be successful while always doing the right thing.
1 An estimated 80 to 85 percent of all 
queries on the Internet are typed into 
Google’s search engines, and google.com is 
the most visited website in the world. 
1 According to ComScore in 2010, 34,000 
searches are made on Google every second. 
That’s about 88 billion searches a month.  
1 The ﬁrst doodle (above) livened up 
Google’s sparse home page in 1998. Now,  
an entire team is responsible for the 
Google doodles. 
1 Google makes its money from advertising, 
helping direct web users (trafﬁc) to 
advertisers’ websites. In 2009, advertisers 
paid Google $22.9 billion.
1 Since 2001, Google has bought more than 
80 companies, including YouTube, Blogger, 
photo-sharing site Picasa, and slide.com. 
1 In 1999, Brin and Page offered Google to 
a rival company, Excite, for just $1 million. 
Excite turned down the offer.
Google facts
1 Google strives to be eco-friendly. Solar 
panels generate up to 30 percent of the 
Googleplex’s electricity and, each year,  
goats are brought in to “mow” the grass.
1 Brin and Page pay themselves just a dollar 
a year—but their Google shares make them 
billionaires.   
1 “Google” is a play on googol, which 
means 1 followed by 100 zeroes.

Did you know? 
Most companies keep their 
server details secret, though 
the web hosting company 
1&1 Internet admits it runs 
more than 70,000 servers.  
No one knows for sure, but  
it is estimated that Google 
runs a million servers 
worldwide.
A server is a computer that handles ﬁles, 
tasks, and data from other computers, 
known as clients. A server farm is a 
collection of computer servers in one 
location. Server farms can perform a wide 
range of tasks, from storing companies’ 
computer data securely to hosting websites 
and transmitting data over the Internet. 
Large quantities of data can ﬂow to and 
from the server farm and the businesses 
and organizations that are its customers.
Server farm
The Pionen facility
In 2007 and 2008, more  
than 140,000 cu ft (4,000 cu m) 
of solid rock were blasted 
away to turn this former 
nuclear bunker into a server 
farm. It covers an area of  
12,000 sq ft (1,110 sq m).
Super server
About 100 ft (30 m) below the city of 
Stockholm is a bunker hewn out of granite 
rock. The Pionen data center belongs to 
Bahnhof, one of Sweden’s biggest Internet 
service providers. Secured behind its 16 in 
(40 cm) thick steel doors, more than 6,000 
computer servers shift millions of bytes of 
data over computer networks.

World apart
The Pionen data center 
features lamps that simulate 
daylight, large numbers of 
plants, artiﬁcial waterfalls, and 
a giant 570-gallon (2,600-liter) 
saltwater ﬁsh tank. The ﬂoor 
of its conference room is a 
replica of the Moon’s surface. 
Cooling issues
Electricity is one of a server farm’s 
biggest expenses. It is needed 
both to power the machines and 
to keep them cool. At the Pionen 
data center, two giant diesel 
engines from a German submarine 
power the generators (pictured) 
that provide backup electricity. 
The server farm has a warning 
system in case there is a security 
breach or a major technical fault 
with a group of servers. This 
consists of loud horns from the 
same submarine.

People spend their time online in a vast number 
of different ways. Some use their time to learn 
about a subject in depth while others prefer 
skimming through many different topics, picking 
up snippets and facts along the way. Many 
people get involved in online communities 
dedicated to particular hobbies or interests, from 
supporting the same sports team to sharing their 
passion for vintage cars or photography, or their 
experiences of owning a pet. Whatever their 
interests, most people tend to use the Internet for 
many different purposes throughout a single day.
Our time online
Morning news
Grabbing the morning news used to  
be a simple matter of waiting for the 
newspaper to be delivered or switching 
on the radio. Now, many cannot resist 
starting the day by powering up their 
laptop or PC to read the latest headlines 
online. Some head directly to a particular 
news agency or media site while others 
use RSS feeds (see above right). 
Off to work
Millions of people take long journeys on 
public transportation to and from work. 
These commuters are well-served by 
technologies designed for use on  
the move, from media players with 
headphones that cancel out much of  
the background noise, to smartphones 
capable of picking up e-mails or 
displaying web pages. 
Checking the inbox
Many people start their work day by 
checking their e-mail inbox, whether they 
are traveling, in the ofﬁce, or working from 
home. An estimated 2.8 million e-mails 
are sent every second by the world’s  
1.9 billion e-mail users, many of whom 
have more than one account. E-mail 
numbers are increased further by junk 
messages known as spam.
Social networking
Keeping in touch with friends through 
jokes, banter, and games, ﬁnding old 
friends, and making new ones are part  
of the appeal of social networking sites 
such as Facebook, MySpace, and Bebo. 
Still growing in popularity, new apps, 
games, and quizzes, especially on 
Facebook, are causing people to spend 
more and more time on these sites.

In 2007, the small European 
nation of Estonia became the 
ﬁrst country to offer online

parliamentary elections. 
Really Simple Syndication (RSS)
It wasn’t that long ago that the only way  
to keep track of updates on your favorite 
website was to ﬁnd it in your web browser, 
again and again. RSS or Really Simple 
Syndication automates the process for you 
by sending headlines and summaries of 
updates and new content from websites 
you subscribe to. New material is sent out 
to you automatically as it is posted online.

Working from home
Many people now work for companies 
from home, accessing company 
information and contacting coworkers 
via an Internet connection. The Internet 
has helped thousands of people start 
their own businesses, getting advice, 
contacts, and even funding from online 
sources, and getting orders and work  
via their websites.

Blogging
Blog
Lots of people like to share their  
opinions with others online. Newspaper 
and other media websites encourage 
readers’ comments since they help keep 
people on their sites for longer and 
generate additional content for free. 
Blogs contain a person’s thoughts, 
views, and stories as well as links  
to other blogs or websites. 
Money matters
More and more people handle their 
personal ﬁnances online, enjoying the 
convenience of online banking and 
trusting in the security layers and 
encryption software employed by banks 
to protect their accounts. Others invest 
via online stock trading, while ﬁnancial 
news updates allow people to keep track 
of ﬁnancial markets all over the world.
Shop ’til you drop
E-commerce has proved very popular 
with customers, who are able to ﬁnd 
and buy goods from all over the world 
via international shopping sites. 
Shoppers take advantage of price-
comparison websites to ﬁnd the best 
price, scour the net for discount 
coupons, and may not buy until they’ve 
read online reviews of products.
Face to face
A webcam, either built into or attached to 
a monitor or laptop screen, allows images 
to be sent and received, keeping people 
in touch, face-to-face. Video conferencing 
means a meeting can be held in different 
locations at the same time, while  
video relay services enable people to 
communicate with sign language over 
the Internet through an interpreter.

Up-to-the-minute access to facts, scores, 
and updates has become essential for 
many, now equipped with easy-to-use 
web searches by voice on some 
smartphones or by keyword on 
e-readers, tablets, and PCs. Celebrity 
gossip websites and sports update 
services that offer results and news  
are particularly popular.
Evening entertainment
An evening in with the laptop might 
involve a mixture of e-mails, social 
networking, and catching up on TV 
shows using video sites like Hulu, on 
which Americans watch 924 million 
videos per month, or YouTube, which  
has 12.2 billion video clips viewed every 
month. You can also access movie-
streaming websites and download music.
Late-night gaming
Gaming is popular at all hours with 
many Internet users, who enjoy the 
range of highly addictive games 
available online. The evening is often a 
good time for more involved gaming, 
for competing with players around the 
world, or for using forums to share  
and swap tips and tricks, including 
cheats to games. 

Keeping in touch with friends, known as social networking, 
now occupies more of people’s time online than any other 
activity. Statistics for June 2010 saw social networking sites 
such as Bebo, MySpace, and Facebook account for 22.7 percent 
of all time spent on the Web in the United States. In contrast, 
Americans spend 10.2 percent of their time on online games, 
8.3 percent on e-mails, and 3.9 percent watching videos.

Named after its creator, Google 
employee Orkut Büyükkökten,  
social networking site Orkut has  
100 million regular users. In April 
2010, 48% of Orkut’s users were 
from Brazil, 39.2% from India, and 
2.2% from the United States.
English is the most popular language on Facebook,  
with 213.2 million users—52.2% of total users. Next is 
Spanish (61.2 million), French (23.5 million), Turkish 
(21.9 million), and Indonesian (20.5 million).
Facebook continues to grow rapidly. In October 2010 alone,  
an additional 2,974,000 Indonesians joined up, along with 
1.66 million Mexicans, and 1.56 million new users from India.
Every month, around 290 million Facebook users log 
on just to play games.
The majority of Facebook gamers—a surprising  
69%—are women.
With more than 75 million registered players, FarmVille  
is the biggest Facebook game of all. Players plant, tend,  
and harvest virtual crops.
Until the boom of Facebook, 
MySpace was the biggest 
social networking site in the 
world. The 100-millionth 
MySpace account was 
created on August 2006 in 
the Netherlands. 
Out of space?
PHOTO FUN 
In September 2010, 
Flickr, the social

NO GO
In 2006, global shopping chain 
Wal-Mart set up its own online 
social networking site for teens 
called The Hub. It required parental consent  
to use and was considered too full of ads.  
It survived just 10 weeks.
Down and out?
Not all social networking sites  
are booming. Bebo, short for  
Blog Early, Blog Often, was sold by 
AOL in 2010 after its number of 
users fell by as much as 50% in a 
year. AOL paid $850 million for 
Bebo, but according to reports, sold 
it for just $10 million.
The social networking site Twitter  
allows you to follow microblogs from 
friends and celebrities. 

“Once every 100 years, 
media changes.The last 
100 years have been 
deﬁned by the mass 
media. In the next 100 
years, information won’t 
be just pushed out to 
people: It will be shared 
among the millions of 
connections people have.”
Did you know? 
The styling of Facebook’s 
website is predominantly 
blue. This is because 
Zuckerberg has red-green 
color blindness and sees the 
color blue best. 
Mark Zuckerberg 
 Mark Zuckerberg (born 1984) is the originator of 
social networking monster Facebook. The site grew 
out of Facemash, which allowed students at Harvard 
University to rate pictures of each other. Zuckerberg 
and three friends launched Facebook from their dorm 
rooms in 2004, and had a million users within 10 
months. The story of Facebook’s creation was the 
subject of a movie, The Social Network (2010). 
Zuckerberg still runs Facebook and is said to have 
turned down takeover offers from Yahoo!, Viacom, and 
Microsoft among others. In January 2011, Facebook 
was valued at more than $50 billion.

The growth  
of the Web
The World Wide Web is exploding in size. From  
a barely noticeable handful of websites 20 years 
ago, it has mushroomed into a gigantic resource. 
In 2010 alone, around 21.4 million new websites 
were added to the Web. And as huge countries 
like China, India, Indonesia, and Brazil get more 
and more of their population online, it’s only  
set to get bigger and bigger.

Did you know? 
According to Internet World Stats  
in 2010, more than three-quarters  
of the U.S. population were Internet 
users. By contrast, just 0.3 percent 
of the population of the African 
nation of Sierra Leone used  
the Internet. 
Imagine facing a 2-day trek 
every time you wanted to check 
your e-mail. That’s the prospect 
facing many who live in rural 
parts of mountainous Nepal. 
Here, on the “Roof of the World,” 
fewer than three percent of the 
country’s 29 million people have 
direct Internet access. Nepal  
is far from alone. There is a  
huge digital divide between the 
Internet haves and have-nots 
around the world. All kinds of 
initiatives, both big and small, 
are working to shrink the gap. 
Access all areas
Mahabir Pun
Returning home to Nepal after 
studying in the United States, 
Mahabir Pun created a wireless 
connection between his village and 
its neighbors in 2001, using an old 
TV satellite dish. Since then, Pun has 
helped bring Internet access to more 
than 100 Nepalese villages, using 
donated PCs and parts. 

Online impact
The Internet has brought 
together isolated Nepalese 
communities. School children 
work online, farmers can buy 
and sell on a local trading 
website, and health workers use 
webcams so patients can be 
examined by hospital doctors in 
the capital, Kathmandu.
Everest 3G
In 2010, the Nepalese telecom 
company Ncell brought 
wireless 3G Internet and phone 
coverage to Mount Everest—
its climbers, guides, and nearby 
villages. Since there is no 
electricity supply, the system’s  
10 base stations are powered 
by solar panels, with batteries 
for backup. The highest of the 
stations is 17,060 ft (5,200 m) 
above sea level. 
Network Nepal
Many communities in rural Nepal are remote, at high 
altitude, cut off by steep valleys, and poorly served by 
roads or electricity. Building long-distance Wi-Fi 
networks in this terrain has been a huge challenge. 
Materials have been carried up by hand to construct 
the relay towers that beam the signals through the 
narrow valleys. The highest tower stands 11,800 ft 
(3,600 m) above sea level and is manned by a yak 
farmer, who must check the connections every day.

Government  
interference 
Search engines receive requests from 
national governments asking for the 
removal of material from their search 
results or, in Google’s case, from either 
their search results or other Google 
products such as YouTube or Google 
Groups. In the ﬁrst six months of 2010, 
Google received more than 5,000 
requests from the U.S. government  
for material to be removed or for 
information on users  
of Google products.
Many helpers
There may be no one in charge  
of the Web, but don’t panic. Many 
organizations are involved in 
maintaining, managing, and 
planning different facets of  
the Internet. These include 
international working parties that 
ensure that web technology works 
 in all languages, scripts, and  
cultures—an enormous task.
    How big 
is the Web?
For a system that is all  
about information on any topic 
imaginable, from aardvarks to zip 
codes, it’s surprising how little 
deﬁnitive data there is on the Web 
and its size. This is in part due to its 
constant growth and changing 
nature. A survey in January 2011 
counted 273,301,445 websites. 
These generate more than  
14 billion web pages. 
Task force
The Internet Engineering  
Task Force (IETF) is an 
international, open community 
of network engineers, 
companies, and researchers 
who try to keep networks 
running smoothly while 
improving Internet  
standards.
W3C 
Formed and led by Tim 
Berners-Lee, the World 
Wide Web Consortium  
(W3C) looks after the 
standards that underpin 
websites and web pages.
How 
the Web 
is run
The World Wide Web is huge and complex,  
so who runs it all? Surely, someone must be in 
charge? It’s not the Internet service providers 
(ISPs) who connect you to the Internet, or the 
telecom companies who supply phone lines and 
infrastructure. Nor is it national governments or 
the UN. The answer is that no single organization 
administers all websites and the content that 
flows between them.
North Africa
During unrest in  
north Africa in 2011, the 
Twitter website was 
blocked in both Tunisia 
and Egypt to prevent it 
from being used to 
organize protests.
Italy
Since 2006, gambling on 
foreign websites has been 
illegal in Italy. Gambling, 
betting, and bookmaking 
websites from abroad  
are blocked.
National 
restrictions 
The World Wide Web’s pioneers 
envisioned an open, free ﬂow of 
information throughout the world, 
but national governments sometimes 
don’t let that happen. Some websites 
that are accepted in one country 
may break the laws of another and 
are blocked or banned.
Internet Society
Formed in 1992, the 
Internet Society is a 
nonproﬁt organization  
that has more than 44,000 
members and tries to plan 
and campaign to avoid 
future problems with 
Internet growth.
Did you  
know? 
Lurking beyond the Web  
that is accessible to search 
engines lies the “deep web,”  
millions of private pages  
and information held in 
databases that search 
engines cannot reach.

Net  
neutrality 
There are other threats besides 
government interference that 
challenge the ability of the Internet to 
deliver all data equally to everyone, a 
principle known as network neutrality.  
Some ISPs and companies want to 
create a “fast lane” on the Internet that 
can be used by customers who pay 
more for websites and data.  
Those who support neutrality fear  
that this would lead to unequal  
and unfair service.
Walled  
gardens? 
In the early days of the Web, major 
ISPs such as Compuserve and 
America OnLine (AOL) walled off their 
content, only allowing access to 
paying, registered users. After years of 
offering free content and services on 
the Web, many companies, including 
the New York Times, are returning to 
this model and charging for access 
in an attempt to recoup the vast  
costs of their websites. 
Leaky  
bucket 
Attempts to censor or remove 
material from the Internet are not 
always successful—it’s sometimes 
described as a leaky bucket, 
because it’s so easy to copy and 
redistribute information. Attempts 
at censorship can generate great 
international interest, and mirror 
sites that are copies of the  
original site often spring up,  
hosted in other countries.
“The Internet is  
not a thing, a place,  
a single technology,  
or a mode of 
governance. It is 
an agreement.”
John Gage, Director of Science, 
Sun Microsystems, Inc.

Political 
censorship  
Some countries block websites that 
criticize the government or country, 
or provide details on sensitive 
subjects such as anti-government 
protests and marches. In nations 
such as Cuba and Myanmar, with 
very low private Internet access, 
government-run cybercafes and 
access points may be heavily 
censored, with thousands of 
websites banned. 
Georgia
In 2008, during the  
war with Russia over the 
region of South Ossetia, the 
government of Georgia 
banned all websites that 
ended in .ru, originating 
from Russia.
South Korea
South Koreans visiting 
websites with more than 
100,000 members have to 
register with their real 
name and national identity 
card number.
Turkey
After its founder,  
Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, 
was mocked in YouTube 
videos, Turkey banned  
the website in the 
country for  
two years.
The Internet has relied on 
agreement between many parties  
to survive and prosper worldwide. 
Could a lack of future agreement, 
censorship, and other restrictions 
placed on websites by national 
governments lead to a “splinternet,” 
with different standards in different 
nations? No one is certain, but 
changes are likely as more and 
more of the four billion people 
currently without access get online.
Internet to splinternet?

The good side  
of the Web
The founders of the World Wide Web made it freely 
available because they thought it could be a 
powerful force for good. In many ways, they were 
right. In its relatively short life so far, the World 
Wide Web has been an astonishing success, 
helping to inform and transform millions of lives. It 
provides a platform for new businesses, puts 
people with shared interests in touch, and 
provides a convenient, regularly updated source  
of news and entertainment for millions every day.
Did you  
know? 
MIT’s OpenCourseWare  
offers free lecture notes, exam 
papers, and video tutorials for 
2,000 different academic 
courses. More than a million 
students and educators visit 
the site each month.
Interested in time travel? The Wayback  
Machine is a gigantic archive of web pages 
dating back to 1996. Users can see what a 
website’s content was like at different points in 
the past—for free. In 2007, the California-based 
organization performed a massive web crawl 
in order to take a global snapshot of the 
World Wide Web. It cataloged and 
archived two billion web pages. 
Archives like this will be invaluable 
to future Internet historians. 
Wayback Machine
Free software 
The Web holds a growing collection of 
computer programs that are free for anyone 
with Internet access to download. People 
often take these resources for granted, but it is 
quite remarkable that the results of thousands 
of hours of hard work are given away. The two 
main kinds of free software are freeware and 
open-source programs. Freeware is software 
that is free for personal or non-commercial 
use. Open-source programs go even further, 
offering the entire program code and 
background details so that fellow software 
designers can alter or improve the program.

Helping others 
Charities and campaign groups use the Web  
to raise awareness of issues. Their websites 
feature facts and ﬁgures, video case studies, and 
interviews. Many provide helpful free resources, 
such as advice on how to deal with bullying, 
eating disorders, alcohol, drugs, or gang violence. 
Charities can raise funds by running online 
campaigns or organizing virtual volunteering, in 
which people donate their time or skills over the 
Internet to help a cause some distance away.  
Sharing expertise
The Web is bursting with knowledge on a vast  
range of subjects. Experts and enthusiasts give  
up their time to offer insights and information  
on personal websites or take part in collaborative 
projects such as iFixit, which offers repair manuals 
for hundreds of electrical devices. Surfers can 
download sports rules and coaching tips from 
governing bodies, identify wildlife they have spotted, 
learn a language, or get advice on how to improve 
their paintings, photography, or music, all for free. 
Did you

On December 10, 2010, 
Freerice.com users donated  
more than 60 million grains 
of rice to starving people 
worldwide. All they had to do 
was click on advertisers’ 
links on websites. 
Did you  
know? 
Michelle Miles, a 19-year-old 
from Arkansas, began a 
charitable cause on Facebook. 
Her “Race to End Cancer”  
has more than six million 
members and has raised  
more than $80,000. 
Freecycle 
In 2003, recycling activist Deron Beal 
sent out an email to about 40 friends 
and local charities around Tucson, 
Arizona. He wanted to set up a 
system in which people offered 
unwanted goods to others rather than 
throw them away. The Freecycle 
Network now operates in more than 
85 countries and has more than seven 
million members. Its online notice 
boards advertise all kinds of gifted 
items, from baby carriages to printers. 

The bad side  
of the Web
Most people build web pages in order to  
educate, inform, or entertain. Some, however,  
misuse the fabulous resource at their ﬁngertips,  
and play pranks, start rumors, or build websites  
full of lies. Some use the Web, email, and instant 
messages to upset and intimidate people. Others 
spread malicious computer code that can damage  
computers or steal passwords, allowing criminals  
to divert money from victims’ bank accounts. 
Offensive sites 
Many websites display images or discuss 
subjects, such as violence or sexual 
content, that are unsuitable for children 
and distasteful to many adults. Internet 
ﬁlters, such as Net Nanny, Safe Eyes, and 
Google’s SafeSearch, can prevent  
these sites from being viewed by  
people who do not want to  
or should not see them.
Did you  
know? 
In 2009, 11 people in China 
were found guilty of using 
Trojans and other malware. 
They had stolen more than 
ﬁve million user names  
and passwords.
Viruses and worms 
Computer viruses are types of malware that make 
copies of themselves and run automatically on a 
computer, often destroying ﬁles or even erasing hard 
disks. When a ﬁle containing a virus is sent to another 
computer, it can become infected, too. Worms  
are viruses that use network connections to spread 
automatically. Identiﬁed in 2008, the Conﬁcker worm 
has infected millions of machines, including computers 
in the French navy and British police. It may have 
caused more than $9.5 billion of damage. 
Malware 
Computer software that is sent  
to your computer with mischievous 
or criminal intent is called malware. 
It includes viruses, worms, Trojans, 
and spyware. Malware can be just  
a harmless, if irritating, prank or 
designed for more serious purposes, 
such as stealing credit card and 
bank account details or crippling  
a victim’s computer. Malware is  
a massive problem, with around 
60,000 new malware threats 
identiﬁed every day.

In 2010, the FBI ﬁnally 
captured Oleg Nikolaenko, 
the “King of Spam.” His 
infected computers were 
responsible for up to a third 
of the world’s junk emails.
Cyber-bullying
Bullying is very upsetting both face-to-face  
and online. Cyber-bullying can involve a victim 
being ridiculed, harassed, unfairly excluded from 
a forum or online game, or repeatedly locked out 
of their social network accounts. Cyber-bullies 
may bombard their victim’s phone or computer 
with threatening texts, emails, and instant 
messages, or send them spam and malware. 
Some cyber-bullies pretend to be the victim 
online, wreaking havoc with the victim’s life.
Spam 
In 2004, Bill Gates predicted that unsolicited 
bulk email (spam) would be stopped within 
2 years. He was wrong. Despite the use of 
spam ﬁlters, junk emails still cram many 
people’s inboxes. Most spam is sent out by 
zombies, PCs unknowingly infected with  
a virus or similar piece of malware that 
allows spammers to control them.
Fiction, not fact 
Errors, pranks, and lies can spread,  
given credibility by appearing on a website. The 
dhmo.org website warns people of a dangerous 
liquid, dihydrogen monoxide. Seven million 
people have visited the site and calls for DHMO 
to be banned have been made by politicians in 
New Zealand and the United States—but 
DHMO is just another name for water!
Trojans and 
backdoors
Trojan horse programs masquerade as 
legitimate software, such as a free game or virus 
scanner, to trick users into running them. Once 
installed, they can introduce additional malware. 
Some Trojans install a backdoor—software that 
bypasses the computer’s normal security to 
allow access to the entire machine. American  
hacker Albert Gonzalez used backdoor 
programs to steal details for as many as  
170 million ATM and credit cards. In 2010,  
he was sentenced to 20 years in prison.
Phishing
Fake emails that seem to be from 
trusted sources, such as banks and 
Internet service providers, and ask  
you to update or verify your personal 
details, are examples of phishing. What 
are they hoping to catch? People’s 
banking information and other 
personal details, which they can  
sell to other criminals or use  
directly to make purchases.

Keeping 
us safe
Be aware 
The ﬁrst and best line of defense against computer 
threats is to be a careful user. Keep antivirus software 
and other security patches up-to-date. You should also 
never open suspicious e-mail attachments or reveal 
personal details online, and avoid counterfeit software 
and other illegal downloads. 
Password 
protection? 
Hard-to-guess passwords offer 
some protection. Unfortunately, 
many people use the same weak 
password for all their accounts. 
Cyber-criminals can discover 
passwords with software that runs 
through every possible character 
combination. Longer passwords 
containing symbols and numbers 
take longer to crack. 
Attempts at computer fraud and other crimes 
are an unpleasant fact of digital life. In their 
efforts to ward off attacks, police, software 
makers, and others involved with computer 
security give warnings of possible threats 
and come up with ways to keep computers 
and their users safe.  
Scams
Many scam websites or 
e-mails offer famous brands 
at low prices. People pay 
but never receive their 
goods. In 2009, London’s 
e-crime unit closed down 
more than 1,200 fraudulent 
shopping sites. Fake charity 
sites, made to resemble real 
appeals, are another scam.

In 2010, PandaLabs, the virus

attempt to steal money.

Firewalls 
A ﬁrewall is hardware or, more 
commonly, software that sits 
between your computer and the 
Internet or another network. Its 
preferences can be set to only let 
through certain actions, Internet 
addresses, or data. A ﬁrewall can 
prevent some viruses and hackers 
from gaining control of your 
computer, but it is safest to install 
antivirus software as well. 
The virus writer 
Masato Nakasuji was arrested in 
2008 for writing the Harada virus, 
which replaced ﬁles with an image 
from a famous Japanese comic 
book series. Two years later, his 
Ika-tako virus infected at least 
20,000 computers, replacing ﬁles 
with manga-style pictures of squid 
and octopuses he had drawn. 
Cyber-cops
All around the world, 
governments, police, and 
intelligence forces are working 
hard to counter cyber-crime. 
As these crimes often cross 
borders, ﬁghting them involves 
international collaboration. 
Investigators are becoming 
highly skilled at tracing 
suspicious activity, tracking 
Internet addresses, and 
uncovering the identities of 
anonymous cyber-criminals.
The undercover agent 
DarkMarket was an Internet forum 
where cyber-criminals could sell 
credit-card-copying machines  
and stolen data. What users didn’t 
know was that Master Splyntr, the 
forum’s administrator from 2006 to 
2008, was actually an FBI agent, 
Keith Mularski. His undercover 
operation resulted in 56 arrests.
The spam sender 
McColo was a U.S.-based ISP that 
turned out to host a number of 
infamous botnets—computer 
programs that send out junk mail 
and malware—including Rustock, 
Storm, and Mega-D. After McColo 
was shut down in 2008, global 
spam quantities plummeted by 
between 40 and 75 percent. 
The teenage hacker
In 2000, working under the alias 
MaﬁaBoy, 15-year-old Michael Calce 
from Canada hacked into the world’s 
leading search engine, Yahoo!, and 
shut it down for an hour. He followed 
with attacks on the American news 
company CNN, eBay, and computer 
manufacturer Dell. He was caught 
after boasting about his exploits in 
Internet chat rooms. 
Antivirus  
software 
Antivirus programs are designed to scan your computer  
for signs of suspicious activity, seek out infected ﬁles, and 
check for ﬁles that match the proﬁle of known malware. If  
the software discovers a suspicious ﬁle, it will offer a range  
of actions—deleting the ﬁle, trying to clean it, or disabling  
the ﬁle and housing it in a quarantine area or virus vault. 
Antivirus makers work overtime to develop successful ﬁxes 
to existing malware, and to identify and repel new threats, 
which appear regularly.
TOP 
SECRET
Did you know? 
Malware attacks can be 
literally out of this world. In 
2008, a laptop taken to the 
International Space Station 
was found to be infected by 
the Gammima.AG worm, 
which steals passwords. 

Making 
money 
online
Running a personal website that has a few, simple 
pages can be free or cost a few pennies a week, 
depending on the Internet Service Provider.  
Larger websites are far more expensive. 
The costs for web design of the 
pages, professional hosting, search 
engine optimization, and regular 
content updates soon run into the 
thousands. So how do websites 
make back this money and then 
go on to earn a healthy profit?
Did you

Web advertising is big 
business. From January to 
June 2010, American 
advertisers spent around 
$12.6 billion on  
online marketing.

In-betweeners
Interstitials are pages that appear 
during a delay that occurs between 
clicking on a Web link and the 
expected web page’s appearance. 
They are often used by a website’s 
sponsor or sold to other companies 
to advertise on. 
Tailored text ads 
Text ads are becoming more 
sophisticated. Within a website, 
text ads can relate to the content of 
individual pages. If a user is 
viewing a page about skiing, for 
example, it might carry ads for ski 
gear or hotels at leading ski resorts.
Online advertising 
Many websites sell no goods or services at 
all but instead offer useful or interesting 
content free to their visitors. These sites 
are ﬁnanced by advertising. The fees 
agreed for every 1,000 clicks on an ad or 
every 10,000 times it is viewed are tiny, but 
multiplied by millions of potential visitors 
they can result in big monthly fees. 
Sponsorships
Some websites are funded by a 
sponsor—in return, websites display 
the sponsor’s logo or message 
prominently. The sponsor’s logo is 
usually clickable, which means that 
clicking on it takes users to the 
sponsor’s own website. 
Pesky pop-ups
Pop-up ads do just that—pop up on 
the page that a person is using. 
Starting out as a novelty, pop-ups have 
become an annoyance. Often, 
browsers and security software offer 
the option of blocking them.
Banner ads
A banner ad is a graphical bar or 
button usually located at the top 
or side of a website containing 
text and/or images. Clicking  
on it will often take you to  
the advertiser’s web pages.

Rich-media ads
Some ads try to grab your 
attention with fun multimedia 
elements such as sound, a video 
clip, or animation, including  
mini games to play.

Million dollar homepage
Sites without ads 
Some companies’ websites are not 
designed to turn a proﬁt—they are 
part of a company’s marketing budget 
and their job is simply to project a 
positive image of the company.  
Other websites raise money by selling 
products directly, such as merchandise 
or digital downloads. Some websites, 
from small charities to Wikipedia, rely 
on donations from individuals and 
companies to cover their costs.
Freemium 
An increasingly popular online business 
technique, a freemium offers basic access 
or a scaled-down version of a service for 
free. The hope is that enough users will 
choose to upgrade to a premium, paid-for 
service that offers more content or features. 
It is used by the Spotify music-streaming 
service, Skype, and YouSendIt, for example. 
On a similar model, some online games are 
free to play but charge for in-game items 
and upgrades, such as weapons or skills. 
Buyouts
Some companies offer such a strong 
product or have so many visitors to their 
website that bigger companies make a 
takeover offer or buyout. There are even 
websites that specialize in buying and 
selling websites, such as Flippa. The  
sums are usually small but occasionally  
a big buyout occurs. In 2007, for example, 
Yahoo! bought the Web e-mail company 
Zimbra for a cool $350 million.  
In 2005, British student Alex Tew came  
up with an ingenious way to pay for his 
college education. He built a website of 
one million pixels and sold off blocks at  
a dollar per pixel to advertising banners. 
The website was ﬁlled in just ﬁve months 
and included a banner advertising Jack 
Black’s rock group Tenacious D and 
another for the London Times newspaper. 
The last 1,000 pixels were auctioned on 
eBay for $38,100!

More than 100 years ago, radio 
waves were identiﬁed as a 
method of transmitting signals 
over long distances without wires. 
Wi-Fi, short for Wireless Fidelity,  
is the name for technology  
that allows digital data to be 
transmitted using radio signals. 
Since the 1990s, the world has 
gone increasingly wireless  
to deliver mobile Internet 
connectivity to a massive  
range of machines, from tablet 
PCs to washing machines.
A world 
without 
wires
WiMAX antennae
WiMAX is Wi-Fi that uses powerful radio 
transmissions to enable signals carrying 
data to travel distances up to 30 miles  
(50 km) for ﬁxed WiMAX stations, and 3–9 
miles (5–15 km) for mobile stations.  
It gives moving vehicles broadband levels 
of Internet access.
Appliance science
Household products, from digital photo 
frames to refrigerators, are provided with  
Wi-Fi access as new applications are 
developed. A Wi-Fi-enabled referigerator 
launched in 2011 can stream music into  
a kitchen, search for recipes online, and 
even order food from grocery stores.
Simple setup
A simple home Wi-Fi setup delivers a 
broadband Internet connection using a 
device called a wireless router. This 
receives data from the Internet and 
transmits it as a radio signal, usually up 
to a distance of 100–130 ft (30–40 m) 
indoors, and a little farther outside.
A hotspot is an area of Wi-Fi coverage 
found in a public area such as a 
library, city center, or even the 
International Space Station (below). 
Most are secured, requiring password 
access or payment to use the facility. 
Some are unsecured or deliberately 
free. You can also use small, portable 
routers called MiFi to generate 
personal wireless hotspots that send 
signals over your mobile phone 
carrier’s network.

On course
In 2008, the Yokohama Country Club golf 
course in Japan installed 50 Inforemer 
HDX displays in their golf carts. This 
device features GPS (Global Positioning 
System) to help golfers measure their 
shots and navigate the course, and also 
Wi-Fi, to create a course-wide hotspot. 
Wi-Fi wear
People who need to connect to the 
Internet when out and about often use a 
small device called a scanner that detects 
local Wi-Fi hotspots without the need to 
boot up a computer. The scanner can 
even be built into T-shirts—the logo 
lights up when a hotspot is found!
Your Wi-Fi world
It’s never been easier to get online. Laptops, 
netbooks, PDAs (palmtop computers), and 
tablet PCs ﬁtted with a Wi-Fi adaptor can  
all send and receive signals via wireless 
routers. Videos and sound can also be 
streamed to a TV or music system via  
a wireless home network.
Citywide coverage
Muni-Fi is a large, integrated system of 
public hotspots that covers much or all of 
city. In 2005, Sunnyvale, California, 
became the ﬁrst city in the United States 
to offer free citywide Wi-Fi. Other city 
hotspots include Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 
parts of Paris, France, and Oulu, Finland.
On the move
Wi-Fi allows people to work and play on 
the move using their phones and other 
personal devices. Some cameras or 
camera phones also use Wi-Fi to “geotag” 
photos (adding geographical information, 
such as the location), and upload them 
directly to a photo-sharing website.
Media poles 
More than 20 LED (light-emitting diode) 
displays, 40 ft (12 m) in height, line the 
streets of the Gangam district of Seoul, 
South Korea. These “media poles” 
generate a streetwide Wi-Fi hotspot and 
offer touch screens so that pedestrians 
can search maps and read news.
Did you  
know? 
In 2010, free Wi-Fi hotspots 
were installed in 820 taxis in 
Tokyo, Japan. One hundred 
of these vehicles also  
include free Sony PSPs for 
passengers to use  
during their ride.
Did you

Hermosa Beach, California,  
is home to a giant Wi-Fi 
hotspot that covers the  
entire length of the beach,  
as well as 10,000 nearby 
homes and the 19,000  
people who live there.  

iPhone
Apple’s fourth-generation 
smartphone was launched in 
2010. Containing 16 or 32 GB of 
storage, the phone’s steel-and-
glass casing measures 
4.5 x 2.30 in (11.52 x 5.86 cm) 
and is just 0.37 in (0.93 cm) 
thick. Central to smartphones’ 
success is the vast range of apps 
available. According to Apple, 
more than 300,000 different apps, 
from games to business software, 
now exist for iPhones.
Smartphone
Mobile phones have become so sophisticated 
some are essentially pocket-sized computers. 
These “smartphones” feature a full-ﬂedged 
operating system such as iOS, Android, or 
Symbian, can run thousands of different small 
programs known as apps, and boast more 
processing power than many 10-year-old PCs.

1 Microphone
The iPhone has twin microphones; 
the main one at the bottom of the 
phone is used for calls and voice-
controlled apps, and a second 
microphone at the top helps  
cancel out background noise and 
make music and calls clearer. 
2 Screen
The 3.5-in (8.9-cm) liquid crystal 
display (LCD) is one of the highest-
resolution screens around. This allows 
the device to display ultra-sharp text 
and graphics. The screen is protected 
by a layer of glass chemically treated 
to be 20 times stiffer and 30 times 
harder than plastic.
3 A4 chip
The iPhone’s main processor is a 
complete system on a chip. It has a

phone’s graphics and running multiple 
apps at the same time, to interpreting 
touch gestures on its screen and 
displaying video in real time.

iPhone is rechargeable and gives up 
to 6 hours of call time, 10 hours of 
WiFi use to send messages or surf the 
Internet, and up to 40 hours of audio 
playback to listen to music, podcasts,  
or audiobooks.

The latest smartphone screens 
are touch sensitive. The user 
swipes a ﬁnger across the 
screen to ﬁnd the app they want 
to use, which they open by 
touching the appropriate icon.
How a touch screen works
Touch registered
A grid of sensors below the 
screen registers the touch as 
electrical signals. They detect 
where the touch occurred, and 
the data is sent as electrical 
impulses to the processor.
Gesture recognized
The processor interprets the 
touch gesture made, matching 
it to those held in its memory 
and also checking what that 
gesture means in any speciﬁc 
app being run at the time.
Action completed
The gesture has been 
recognized and the action  
of launching the app is 
performed by the phone’s 
processor. This all happens 
smoothly and in an instant.

Text messaging and IM
The short-message service (SMS) featured on mobile phones allows text messages up to 
160 characters long to be sent to other mobile users. Texting is big business, with millions 
signing up for text-alert services to get the latest news or sports scores delivered by text.
The ﬁrst SMS text ever, sent by engineer Neil Papworth to Vodafone’s  
Richard Jarvis on December 3, 1992, read “Merry Christmas.”
There are an estimated 3.6 billion global 
users of text messages worldwide. 
A staggering 6.1 trillion text messages were sent in 
2010—that’s almost 200,000 every second.
According to a study in 2009, 95% of all text messages are read within 
4 to 15 minutes and replied to within the hour. 
An average of 11 million text messages were sent in the United Kingdom every 
hour during 2009. In the same year, just two countries, the United States and the 
Philippines, were responsible for 35% of all texts sent. 
An SMS text message uses 140 bytes of memory—a typical MP3 
song uses the same amount of memory as 4,000 text messages. 
In 2010, two 23-year-old British climbers trapped 11,500 ft (3,500 m) up western Europe’s

Fifteen years ago, people would have thought  
you were crazy if you suggested using a PC to ﬂy 
around a virtual Earth, zooming out to see whole 
continents, then zooming in to see your own home.  
Yet, through faster Internet access, better computers, 
and smart programming, a range of mapping services 
now allows you to do just that. The Italian city of Rome, 
for example, can be explored in many different ways.
Eye in the sky
Bird’s-eye view
From a distant aerial view of a city or 
region, many mapping programs allow 
you to zoom in closer and closer. This 
clear bird’s-eye view gives an  
interesting perspective on St. Peter’s 
Basilica, inside Vatican City. 
The night sky
Some mapping programs and web apps 
turn the focus away from Earth. They 
observe stars, planets, comets, and other 
phenomena in the night sky and plot 
how they shift during a year. Many of 
these astronomy apps are free. 
Road maps
There are a number of detailed street 
and road map services available for free 
on the Web. Users can plot routes 
between different points, zoom in close 
for individual street directions, and 
bookmark locations for later use.

Reconstructions in 3-D
Using freely available software, Web users 
can build and display 3-D models of 
buildings, such as this reconstruction  
of the Colosseum. Google has even 
modeled different tree species and 
“planted” them across Google Earth.
The view on the street
Rome’s Trevi Fountain can be seen from 
ground level using street layers in Bing 
Maps and Google Earth. These display 
panoramic photos along various streets 
in the world but are controversial 
because of privacy issues. 
Weather view
Satellite weather images were among 
the ﬁrst large-scale maps available on 
the Internet. Data from weather satellites 
is now incorporated into some mapping 
programs, so they display clouds over 
the world in real time. 
Sharing resources
In some apps, users upload and share 
their own photos, tagged to locations. 
This image of Rome’s Pantheon is from 
Panoramio. Within two years of its 
launch, Panoramio boasted more than 
ﬁve million user-submitted images. 
Gathering data
Collecting all the imagery for  
a complete, detailed visual map  
of all parts of the world is a daunting 
task. A range of different techniques 
is used to image the Earth in both 
close-up and long-distance views.
On the ground
Google’s ﬂeet of street cars, tricycles, and 
snowmobiles generate ground-level 
imagery for use with Google Street View. 
Fitted 8 ft (2.5 m) above the ground on  
each vehicle’s mast are nine cameras  
that together generate 360-degree views. 
In the air
Many mapping and virtual world projects 
use aerial photography taken from low-level 
aircraft. Photography for bird’s-eye-view 
maps is usually taken from a 45-degree 
angle to the ground. This helps give a 
simple, 3-D–like perspective.
Up in space
Landsat satellites have been orbiting our 
planet since 1972, beaming back thousands 
of visible-light and infrared images of Earth’s 
surface. These have been used by scientists, 
environmentalists, and governments, as well 
as by recent online mapping services.

Using software available on the Web, you can explore  
a virtual Earth that has been put together using 
images from satellites, aerial photography, and other 
sources. Travel the planet—below the oceans, over its

Quick, quick 
Cunningham named his 
ﬁrst open, editable website  
WikiWikiWeb after the free 
shuttle bus that runs from 
Honolulu airport, Hawaii. 
WikiWiki means “quick, 
quick” in Hawaiian.
Wikipedia
The biggest, most famous wiki of all is  
the online encyclopedia Wikipedia. It is a 
collection of wikis in different languages, 
more than 260 in total, with the biggest—in 
the English language—containing more than 
3.5 million articles, all available on the  
Web for free.
Not for proﬁt
Wikipedia is one of the world’s top ten most 
visited websites. If run for proﬁt, advertising on 
its pages would generate hundreds of millions 
of dollars. But its founders have resisted 
turning it into a business, instead relying on 
fund-raising and donations from individuals 
and organizations. Both Google and the charity 
set up by eBay founder, Pierre Omidyar, 
recently made million-dollar donations.
A wiki is a part of a website that is open 
so that many different people can 
contribute to and edit its content. Users 
can access and edit the page online 
using their regular web browser. Wikis 
can be useful in many ways, such as 
when a group of people from different 
countries want to work together to 
produce a single letter or article about a 
subject. Wiki pages can be easily and 
quickly updated and usually feature 
links to other web pages.
What’s a 
wiki?
The ﬁrst wiki
Ward Cunningham, an American software 
developer, began work on the ﬁrst wiki in 
1994. He created an open, editable set of 
web pages to help programmers and other 
computer technicians share ideas more 
efﬁciently. He added this to his own 
company’s website in 1995.
Other wikis
Wikis exist for all sorts of subjects including 
music lyrics (Lyricwiki), medicine (Ask 
DrWiki), Wikitravel, and World of Warcraft 
(Wowpedia). One of the largest wikis is 
Hudong, an enormous Chinese online 
encyclopedia using the wiki format that 
contains more than three million articles.
Wikileaks 
The most controversial of all wikis is 
the Wikileaks site launched in 2006. 
It contains private, secret, and 
classiﬁed documents on military, 
business, and governments leaked  
to the site, usually by anonymous 
sources. Wikileaks is now banned  
in a number of countries.
Wales and Sanger
As the new century began, Americans  
Larry Sanger and Jimmy Wales were 
involved in building an online encyclopedia 
called Nupedia. Sanger learned about wikis 
from a contributor to WikiWikiWeb and 
convinced Wales and others to try it out. 
Wikipedia launched in 2001, with  
20,000 articles created by the  
end of that ﬁrst year.

“Imagine a world in which every 
single person on the planet  
is given free access to the sum  
of all human knowledge.  
That’s what we’re doing.” 
 Jimmy Wales, 2004
Behind Wikipedia is a tiny number of paid 
employees and an enormous community of 
many thousands of people who give up their 
leisure time to write and debate new articles, 
and repair or update existing ones.
1 At the top of every page on Wikipedia is 
an edit button. Clicking on this calls up the 
page in editable form, complete with codes 
for formatting the text and adding tables, 
links, and images. 
1 Wikipedia has online help guides and a 
sandbox, where people can experiment.
Material in the sandbox is erased 
automatically every 12 hours. The history  
tab also shows earlier versions of an article. 
1 Any edited page can be previewed and 
saved. Other editors may debate the new 
article or propose changes on the article’s 
separate talk page.
How editing works
The millionth entry
In March 2006, an entry on Jordanhill 
railway station in Scotland became the 
English edition of Wikipedia’s one millionth 
article. Within three and a half years, an 
additional two million articles were added  
on every conceivable topic from aardvarks 
to zippers as well as the smell of new  
cars, wife-carrying competitions, and 
National Towel Day!
WikiCriticism
Critics point out that some Wikipedia 
articles are poorly written or involve 
nonexperts writing about complex topics, 
and thus may contain confusing language 
or mistakes. Sometimes people vandalize 
articles, present opinions as facts, or simply 
add lies, such as in 2006 when English 
soccer player David Beckham was deﬁned 
as an 18th-century Chinese goalkeeper. 
Checking sources
Wikipedia can be a tremendous 
resource but due to errors and pranks, it 
is recommended that other sources be 
used to double-check facts. When 
French composer Maurice Jarre died in 
2009, many newspaper articles 
included a quote from him. However, 
the quote had been made up and  
added to Wikipedia by Irish student 
Shane Fitzgerald.
Edit wars
Sometimes, topics elicit strong 
opinions. An edit war occurs when 
rival editors keep changing an article 
to ﬁt their views. Many edit wars are 
trivial, but some are serious. The 
Wikipedia entry on the Iraq War, for 
instance, went through more than 
12,000 different edited versions.
Error-Ridden 
In 2005, the scientiﬁc journal Nature 
conducted a study comparing 42 
science articles in Wikipedia with 
the online version of Encyclopaedia 
Britannica. The survey revealed that 
Britannica had 123 errors while 
Wikipedia had 162, an average of  
3.9 per article.

The age 
of the 
Internet
The Internet developed slowly 
and organically, as computer 
and telecom experts pieced 
together the necessary new 
technology and software to 
enable computers of different 
types to “talk” to each other and 
form networks. Today, the pace 
of change on the Internet is 
incredibly fast. A strong, well-
planned website or Internet 
application can become a  
global success in just a few 
months—or even weeks.

The shift to 
digital media
Magazines, photos, books, and CDs are all physical media—unlike 
digital ﬁles, they take up a lot of space, take time to be delivered 
after ordering, are difﬁcult to update, and can be bulky to carry. For 
these reasons, there has been a huge shift from physical to digital 
media that can be stored on electronic systems.
J E-readers
Weighing less than one 
printed book, an e-reader 
can hold up to 5,000 books in 
electronic form. It offers 
on-the-go portability as well 
as time-saving features, such 
as fast keyword searches 
through millions of words.
Digitizing hard copy
Not long ago, hard copy was king. 
Everything was written down, typed, 
printed, photocopied, or ﬁled on paper. 
Then came the rise of computing and 
the Internet. These days, most new 
documents and many books are 
created in electronic form. At the 
same time, older materials are being 
scanned to create digital versions that 
can be kept on computers. Digital ﬁles  
can be stored by the millions and sent 
over the Internet in seconds. 
D Robot helper
Preserving past media for  
the future in digital form is  
a massive job. The Qidenus 
robotic digitizer turns and 
scans book pages with perfect 
accuracy. It can scan an 
amazing 2,500 pages per hour 
with no human intervention. 
D In the library
Libraries of the past held 
vast quantities of books, 
newspapers, and journals. 
Today, many libraries are 
restricting their physical 
collections in order to give 
space to PCs or terminals 
that offer Internet access.

J Record store 
A large record store held 
thousands of LPs —dinner-
plate-sized vinyl disks that 
featured 20 to 40 minutes of 
music per side. Today, music 
stores mostly sell CDs, but 
tracks are increasingly 
bought online instead.
D MP3 player
Portable digital music 
players are memory chips  
or mini hard drives linked  
to a small sound card and 
 an ampliﬁer. This 16 GB  
iPod nano, launched in  
2010, holds 4,000 tracks and 
weighs a mere 0.75 oz (21 g).
Music media
After decades of vinyl records, 
compact discs (CDs) arrived in the 
1980s. The big shift to digital media, 
however, came with the ability to 
copy individual CD tracks into 
digital formats, such as MP3, WAV, 
or FLAC ﬁles. At last, music was 
easy to store, play, and share over 
the Internet. Today, billions of 
tracks are downloaded from pay 
sites, such as iTunes and Amazon.
What’s on the tube?
TV has come a long way since  
the ﬁrst fuzzy screens appeared in a 
few wealthy people’s homes in the 
1930s. TiVo, launched in 1999, was 
one of the ﬁrst digital video recorders 
(DVRs) with a hard drive. Linked to 
the Internet, the latest DVRs can call 
up television schedules and pause or 
rewind live shows. Increasingly, 
however, many people are not 
watching television sets at all, 
viewing programs and movies over 
the Internet instead. 
J YouTube
Many people catch up 
with TV highlights on 
video-sharing websites. 
YouTube is now so 
inﬂuential that  
President Barack Obama 
has made exclusive 
appearances on it. 
J Streamed content
iPads and similar digital 
devices can display streamed 
video content. They use 
Wi-Fi or a mobile Internet 
connection to access 
websites that offer video 
clips, full  TV shows, or 
feature-length movies.
D TV times
Up until the mid-1950s, 
television sets showed 
programs only in 
black-and-white. They 
offered just one or 
 two channels, which 
broadcast programs for 
just a few hours a day.

Amazon Kindle 
Amazon’s third-generation Kindle was launched  
in 2010. At 9 oz (247 g), it weighs less than most 
paperbacks, yet its 4 GB of memory can hold an 
astonishing 3,500 books. The device can synchronize 
with Amazon’s Kindle store, allowing users to 
browse the opening chapters of hundreds of 
thousands of books, buy books electronically,  
and download them straight onto the device.

E-reader
E-books are books in a digital format, such as a  
word-processing document or a PDF (portable 
document ﬁle), that can be read on a computer, 
tablet, or smartphone. E-readers are devices 
devoted to storing and displaying e-books 
and other text documents. They allow 
students, travelers, and commuters to 
carry large numbers of books, newspapers, 
PDFs, and other documents in one small package.

“The vision is that you 
should be able to get any 
book—not just any book 
in print, but any book 
that’s ever been in print—
on this device.” 
Jeff Bezos (2007)
Jeff Bezos founded Amazon in 1994 to 
sell books over the Internet. It has 
grown to become America’s largest 
online retailer and, in 2007, released  
its ﬁrst Kindle e-reader.

1 Keyboard
Users can type in a word to look up  
its meaning in the Kindle’s built-in 
dictionary. Annotations can also be 
typed into a book, which are stored  
in the memory. The Alt key allows 
certain shortcuts and also launches  
a surprise Minesweeper game to play.
2 Speakers 
The Kindle’s two small speakers  
can output MP3 sound ﬁles, such as 
music or audiobooks. In addition, an 
experimental feature on the device 
can convert the text of a book into 
speech to read a book aloud.
3 Battery
A 1750mAh lithium-polymer battery 
takes up much of the space inside  
the Kindle case. Due to the very low 
power demands of the e-ink screen, 
and with no hard disk to keep 
spinning, the battery can last  
up to four weeks between charges.
4 Micro-USB port
Books and documents can be moved 
to the Kindle from a computer via the 
micro-USB port, which doubles as the 
way in which the Kindle’s battery is 
charged in around 4.5 hours.
 
 
E-ink
Unlike laptop and smartphone screens, an  
e-ink display doesn’t fade or wash out in bright 
sunlight and is easy on the eyes when reading.  
The display is a plastic ﬁlm coated with millions  
of tiny microcapsules. Each capsule contains 
positively charged white particles and negatively 
charged black particles. When a grid of electrodes 
below the ﬁlm activates, signals in the grid attract 
one type of particle and repel the other. The 
repelled particles move to the top of the capsule, 
where they are visible to the human eye.

memory, an e-ink controller chip built 
by Epson, and a multimedia processor. 
There is also a chip devoted to 
managing the unit’s power and a 
Wolfson stereo codec chip to help 
power the Kindle’s twin speakers.
6 Wi-Fi card
An Atheros AR6102G 802.11bg  
chip allows books, newspapers, and 
other documents to be delivered 
wirelessly to the Kindle using 
Amazon’s Whispernet data service.  
A typical book takes under a minute 
to load onto the machine.

Augmented reality
Using a smartphone, digital tablet, or similar device, 
an interactive environment of sound, music, photos, 
video, and text can blend with your surroundings  
to create a real-time, information-rich connection 
between you and the world. This is augmented 
reality (AR), an exciting area of development  
that may revolutionize how we relate to both 
technology and the world around us. 
Food and drink 
Clicking on a food, drink, or 
accommodation icon calls up 
nearby restaurants, cafés, bars, 
hotels, and hostels. Automatic 
Internet links provide reviews, 
tips, and in some cases daily 
specials, discounts, and prices. 
There are different ways to create AR. 
Usually, an application scans an image or 
scene, then calls up additional information 
using a data connection. 
1 Many AR applications designed for use 
on the go exploit a mobile device’s GPS 
(Global Positioning System) technology, 
internal compass or tracking sensors, and 
camera. Together, these can ﬁgure out 
where the device is, the direction it is 
facing, and what it is looking at. 
1 Linking to the Internet through 
dedicated databases or web searches,  
the AR application pulls up relevant 
information and other media, such as 
videos, to display as layers on-screen.

1 Columbia University’s ARMAR system is 
testing AR in engineering. As a technician 
looks at a machine, labels of its parts and 
videos of repair and ﬁtting techniques 
appear on the head-mounted display.
1 In the future, social networking may get 
an AR makeover. Pointing your device at 
people could match them up with photos 
on the Internet to call up their Facebook 
page and Twitter account.
1 AR books are already with us. When 
pointed at a webcam, they can link to the 
Internet to generate 
3-D on-screen 
animations, such as  
a dinosaur roaming 
the page.

hand. It is still in development, but in the 
future, wearable projecting AR devices 
may be used in education, the military, 
business, or just for fun. 
Visitor attractions 
Themed tourist-walk layers can give 
you interactive directions as you

From arcades to  
consoles
Almost no one played video games in the 1960s. The ﬁrst computer  
action game, 1961’s Space War!, required access to a PDP-1 mainframe, 
which cost more than $120,000 and was found only in a handful of  
large organizations. Fortunately, one of those organizations was the 
University of Utah, where a young Nolan Bushnell was studying.  
He racked up plenty of playing hours and went on to pioneer the 
introduction of computer games into arcades and, later, people’s homes. 
Nolan Bushnell
After studying electrical 
engineering at the University  
of Utah, Nolan Bushnell (born 
1943) began working at Ampex, 
the electronics company that 
invented video tape. There, he 
met engineer Ted Dabney, with 
whom he formed Syzygy in 1971. 
The company changed its name 
to Atari the following year. 
Arcade action
In 1970, Bushnell and Dabney  
began to develop an arcade 
game version of Space War! 
The result, Computer Space, 
was brought out by Nutting 
Associates in 1971. It was the 
ﬁrst mass-produced arcade 
computer game, with around 
1,500 machines built. 
Did you  
know? 
As a science-mad teenager, 
Bushnell built a liquid-fuel 
rocket mounted on a roller 
skate. Unfortunately, it 
exploded and nearly burned 
down the family garage! 
Bushnell’s workshop 
After leaving Atari in 1978, 
Bushnell funded various 
companies, including 
Androbot, creators of robots. 
Bushnell rejoined Atari in 2010.

A console classic 
In 1977, the Atari 2600 video console was 
launched with just 128 bytes of built-in 
memory (a CD contains more than 700 
million). The machine came with two 
paddles (above), two joysticks, and a 
simple Combat shooting game. 
Additional games were sold on 
cartridges containing just 4 K (later 16 K) 
of memory. After a slow start, sales 
boomed. In 1980, Atari racked up  
$2 billion in sales, including millions of 
consoles and games such as Pac-Man, 
Space Invaders, and Pitfall!—one of the 
ﬁrst successful platform games. 
Pong
In September 1972, Atari produced its ﬁrst arcade 
game, Pong. Bushnell and Dabney built the game 
using a store-bought television, a coin mechanism  
from a laundromat, and a milk carton used to catch the 
coins. The debut machine was so popular that  
it overﬂowed with quarters and broke down. More  
than 30,000 Pong arcade machines would be sold.
“The simple, classic games, where we 
didn’t have those graphics to fall back  
on, had to be really well-tuned, and  
the response times had to be honed.  
We focused more on game play than  
I think people do today.”
Nolan Bushnell, 2009

Atari innovation 
Atari was more than a one-trick pony. 
Its 400, 800, and XT home computers 
sold well, and the 1989 Atari Lynx 
(right) was the ﬁrst handheld game 
console with a backlit color LCD 
screen. Able to link with and play 
against other machines, the Lynx 
was well ahead of its time but 
sold poorly compared to its 
main rival, the Game Boy.
Did you  
know? 
The three founders of 
Apple—Steve Jobs, Steve 
Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne—
all previously worked for Atari. 
Steve Wozniak developed the 
prototype of the smash-hit 
Atari game, Breakout.

Did you  
know? 
The 1976 game Colossal 
Cave Adventure had just 
700 lines of game code and 
an additional 700 lines of 
data. The latest Assassin’s 
Creed game, Brotherhood, 
had a 600-page script and 
around four million lines of 
program code. 
On its release in 1981, the shoot-’em-up game 
Galaga (below) with its blocky color graphics, 
swooping streams of aliens, and chorus of bleeps 
coming from its one speaker was considered state of 
the art. Gaming has changed enormously since early 
arcade and home games, yet those old games still 
retain their addictive appeal. On New Year’s Day 
2011, Andrew Laidlaw set a Galaga world-record 
tournament score of 4,525,150 points. 
Early games
Sounds good
Early games were silent or merely 
bleeped. Then, in 1980, an arcade 
game called Rally X became one of 
the ﬁrst to feature background music. 
Later the same year, the game 
Stratovox surprised players with 
voice-synthesized speech. Modern 
games have complex soundtracks and 
tens of thousands of lines of speech, 
far more than a typical movie.
Arcade play
In the beginning, the only place 
most people were able to play 
video games was in a noisy arcade 
among crowds of other players. 
You often had to line up for the 
most popular games, and needed a 
pocketful of quarters.
Game worlds
The game of Galaga was just a single screen 
across which different waves of aliens descended. 
Like many early games, it had just three controls: 
left, right, and ﬁre. Since then, both game play and 
game worlds have mushroomed in scale, size, and 
complexity. Anarchy Online, for example, has a 
112-page manual of instructions for its “getting 
started” section alone, while Tiger Woods PGA 
Tour 11 includes accurate 3-D models of 
27 complete real-life golf courses.

Great graphics 
Processing power has 
increased sharply, and most 
modern computers and 
consoles feature high-speed 
graphics cards. Incredibly 
realistic 3-D worlds, scenes, 
and characters are now 
standard in many games.

Did you know? 
Space Invaders was so big 
in Japan in 1980 that there 
was a shortage of the coins 
used in arcade consoles.  
The goverment had to mint 
200 million extra 100-yen 
coins to meet demand.

“When Taito saw the prototype 
[of Space Invaders], they said, 
‘You can’t shoot people! And you 
must not create the image of war.’ 
So I changed the characters into 
monsters. At the time, I was 
trying to decide what the focus 
would be, and had heard of 
a sci-ﬁ movie being produced 
in America called Star Wars. 
I thought a space fad might be 
on the way and decided to focus 
on aliens. And that’s how the 
monsters became the invaders 
that are known today.”
Tomohiro Nishikado
Joining Japanese pinball and vending-machine company Taito 
in 1969, Tomohiro Nishikado (born 1944) designed a number 
of Japan’s early arcade games before releasing Space Invaders 
in 1978. One of the ﬁrst addictive, action-shooter games, it 
caused a sensation and inspired other designers. Taito sold 
Space Invader consoles in Japan and the United States and 
then, in 1980, brought the game into millions of homes by 
transfering it to the Atari 2600 console. It is still played today.

The story of  
Nintendo
Once upon a time, Nintendo was just a humble maker of 
playing cards in Kyoto, Japan. One hundred and twenty  
years later, it’s one of its country’s biggest success stories. 
It’s a giant in the video game industry, with products 
found in homes the world over. It’s safe to say that 
Nintendo has played an important role in shaping  
the way that we interact with computer games today. 
Origins
People think of Nintendo as a cutting-edge 
company, but it was actually founded in 
1889 to manufacture cards for Hanafuda,  
a popular Japanese card game. In the 1960s, 
Nintendo branched out, running taxis and 
making instant rice meals. In the 1970s, it 
sold its ﬁrst toys and video games. Nintendo 
produced its ﬁrst handheld electronic game, 
the Game & Watch, in 1980.
Shigeru Miyamoto
As the creator of Donkey Kong, Mario, 
The Legend of Zelda, and the Wii, Shigeru 
Miyamoto (born 1952) may be responsible for 
more man-hours lost to gaming than anyone in 
history! Miyamoto, who joined Nintendo as its 
ﬁrst staff artist in 1977, is now responsible for 
every Nintendo game and has been dubbed the 
“Walt Disney” of the video game industry. 
J NES
In 1983, the company’s ﬁrst 
cartridge-game system, the 
Nintendo Entertainment 
System, sold all over the world. 
It overtook the Atari 2600 as 
the market leader. 
! Pokémon
 Since ﬁrst appearing in 1996, 
games featuring these “pocket 
monsters” have together sold 
around 200 million copies.

Studio supervisor
Miyamoto’s mentor was Gunpei 
Yokoi, originally hired by Nintendo 
in 1965 to repair conveyor belts and 
other assembly-line parts. Yokoi 
went on to invent the Game Boy 
and to supervise the making of both 
Donkey Kong and Mario. 
A SNES
In 1990, the Super Nintendo 
Entertainment System arrived with 
double the processing power of the 
NES, allowing a big leap forward  
in game quality. 
 D Game Boy
Released in 1989 with the classic 
game Tetris, the Game Boy blasted 
away its handheld opposition. 
With more than 118 million sold, 
it’s one of the best-selling gaming 
devices of all time.

In 2006, Nintendo introduced  
the Wii, which brought motion 
control to games and introduced 
a whole new generation of 
people to video games.

Game controllers allow players to interact with 
and inﬂuence events on screen. Early games were 
slow-paced—with few moves available to the 
player, designers gave little thought to the quality 
or versatility of the controllers. As games have 
grown more complex, so have the ways to control 
them. There is now a multi-million-dollar market 
for the game pads, force-feedback joysticks, and 
motion-sensing devices that give players the  
edge in split-second encounters. 
The evolution of 
game controllers
Type it in
Once upon a time, home computer 
games used a humble keyboard as  
their controller. Text adventures  
called for phrases or sentences to be 
typed in. Today, there are dedicated 
gaming keyboards, such as the Razer 
BlackWidow, which are often backlit for 
use at night. Their keys are responsive 
and tough enough to take a pounding. 
Some can be programmed so that 
pressing one key has the same effect  
as pressing several other keys at once. 
Paddles
Atari’s groundbreaking early games, 
such as Pong and Breakout, were 
played with paddles—controllers 
featuring a turning wheel and one  
or more ﬁre buttons. Each paddle 
allowed movement along one axis. 
The trackball was another controller 
used in early gaming, for example in 
the shoot-’em-up Centipede. Similar 
to an upside-down mouse, it had a 
large ball that was rolled by hand to 
create movement along two axes. 
Joysticks
Early joysticks were four-way 
movement controllers with a single 
ﬁre button. Over time, these evolved 
into more complex and versatile 
devices. Modern joysticks boast 
multiple “hot” buttons that can be 
programmed to perform different 
game functions. Most joysticks have  
a hat switch on top of the handle. 
When activated, this can change the 
view—allowing the player to look 
around the game world, for example.
Specialized controllers
Did you  
know? 
A special single-player 
controller was produced for 
the Japanese robot tanks 
game Steel Battalion. It had 
two joysticks, three foot 
pedals, and 40 buttons.

Game pads
Game pads feature a series of action 
and ﬁre buttons around their body, 
along with a direction controller—
usually a four-arrow D-pad (directional 
pad) or analog stick (a small, sensitive 
joystick). Game pads arrived once 
game play demanded many options. 
Some feature force feedback, in which 
motors make the game pad move or 
vibrate in the hand in response to 
certain actions, such as when the 
player ﬁres a machine gun.
Motion sensors
The motion-sensing Wii remote (or 
Wiimote) contains accelerometers  
that detect changes in movement  
along three different axes (up and 
down, side to side, and forward and 
back). Accelerometers work whether 
the controller is held horizontally like  
a gun or vertically like a golf club. The 
system determines the exact position 
of the controller using beams of 
infrared light projected from the 
sensor bar next to the screen. 
Your body!
Kinect for the Xbox 360 is the ﬁrst in a 
new breed of hands-free controllers. It 
projects a continuous, coded infrared 
light beam across the playing space in 
front of the screen. Then it measures 
how the light returns in order to build 
up a 3-D picture of the playing area 
and any player movements. With a 
controller like Kinect, players can take 
part in games just by moving and 
making gestures. The device also 
responds to spoken commands.
Some games require controllers that break 
the mold of game pads and joysticks. Here 
are some of the most popular ones.

Karaoke games such as SingStar rely on 
a microphone linked to the console to 
measure a player’s singing prowess. 
Microphones are also used in war games 
such as EndWar, so that players can issue 
voice commands to their troops.
Did you  
know? 
A limited edition of the 
third-person shooter 
Resident Evil 4 came with 
a gruesome game pad in the 
shape of a bloodstained 
chainsaw. 
1 Musical instruments 
Guitar Hero games have a guitar-shaped 
controller with ﬁve colored fret buttons 
and a strum bar. 
1 Dance mats 
Mats ﬁtted with pressure sensors  
allow people to play dance games, 
stepping in sync with the commands  
on the screen.
1 Balance boards 
The Wii Fit balance board uses load 
sensors to detect a player’s position and  
track movements as weight is shifted 
from one part of the board to another.
1 Steering wheels 
Many driving games are controlled  
with a steering wheel. Some feature  
foot pedals, gear sticks, and indicators  
as well. 

You are the controller
There’s no game pad, joystick, or motion-
sensing wand to grip as you play Kinect. 
Instead, the device detects and tracks 48 points 
on each player’s body. Gestures such as waving 
a hand to change screens, as well as movements 
such as kicking and throwing, are recognized 
and translated into actions.
Kinect 
Nintendo’s Wii laid down the motion sensing 
gauntlet to all comers, but Kinect for the Xbox 
360 is a whole different game. The device is  
a horizontal sensor bar that detects and 
measures a player’s position and movements 
within a 3-D space in front of the screen. As  
a result, players can run, jump, throw, and  
play a new range of controller-free yoga,  
dance, sports, and action-adventure games.

How it works
A technique called depth mapping is used to 
determine an object’s location and its distance 
from Kinect. Sensors and processors send out 
beams of infrared (IR) light with each small 
block of light given a code for its location. The 
light is collected and measured after it has 
bounced off objects in the scene. From this 
data, embedded software on processors inside  
the Kinect create a detailed 3-D depth map.

3 Microphones
Four downward-facing microphones 
gather voice commands from the user, 
recognizing speech in a range of 
languages and accents. Just saying, 
“Xbox” calls up a range of commonly 
used voice commands including 
“Xbox pause” to pause music or video.
4 PrimeSense PS1080-A2
This complete image-processing 
system on a chip reacts to the data it 
receives from the depth sensor. It 
creates a complete depth map of the 
scene in front of it and can track a 
number of joints in a player’s body at 
a rate of 30 times per second.
5 Motor
Since rooms vary in size and Kinect 
can be placed above or below a TV 
screen, the cameras in the sensor bar 
need to move up or down to adjust its 
ﬁeld of view. The motor in the unit’s 
base can tilt the sensors up or down 
by up to 30 degrees.
“Kinect just opens up so 
many opportunities to us 
because it removes a layer 
between you and the game.”
Nick Burton, 2010
Nick Burton is the Kinect 
development director at software 
developers Rare, involved in some 
of the 17 games released at the 
time of Kinect’s launch.

also use the camera to take and display 
onscreen images of you as you play.
2 IR Projector and depth sensor
The device’s IR laser projector shines 
beams of infrared light outward. These 
bounce off surfaces in the room and 
are collected by the depth sensor, an 
infrared light camera. Working with 
the processor, the sensor builds a  
3-D depth map, accurate to a depth  
of 0.4 in (1 cm).

Not so long ago, if you wanted to play a computer game 
with or against other people, they had to be in the same 
room. Today, you can play as a wizard or warlord in 
Washington, Wisconsin, or Warsaw and battle 
adversaries in Africa, Asia, or Australia. Millions of 
players around the world are ready to join you or play 
against you in thousands of online multiplayer games. 
All you need is a computer or gaming device that is 
connected to the game’s network. 
Playing together
1 Connecting
Players join a game by subscribing  
or paying a set fee. They download 
software onto their computer, 
known as “the client.” Before  
play can begin, the client must 
connect to a server. 
2 Sending
The client computer’s signal travels 
across the world via ﬁber-optic cable until 
it reaches the server. Then the  
server sends a signal back to the  
client computer, informing the player  
that a connection has been established.

Limiting lag
Lag is when messages take too long 
to reach all the clients. Lengthy lags 
can be lethal in quick-ﬁre combat 
games. Players limit lag by making 
sure their computers run fast and by 
only logging on to speedy servers 
that offer a good connection.
Did you

In the two years after the 
release of action game  
Halo 2, more than four billion 
games were played on its 
servers worldwide, almost  
5.5 million games a day.

Did you  
know? 
EVE Online is a space game 
in which players explore a 
universe of more than 7,500 
star systems. On  June 6, 
2010, more than 60,000 
players were all logged on to 
EVE at the same time.

3 Distributing
As the game is played, players’ locations  
and actions are tracked by the game 
server. When a player moves, ﬁres  
a weapon, or types a message to another 
player, an update or “state-of-the-world” 
message is sent to the server.
5 Sending back
The other players’ responses travel back 
to the server and the process begins 
all over again. All of this takes 
place in a split second,  
and it keeps on happening 
every second of the day.
4 Receiving
The state-of-the-world messages are 
sent to all players logged into the game. 
The client computers immediately 
process the messages and produce 
graphics, text, and sound to show the 
latest actions on-screen. Then the other 
players can respond to what they see.

multiple smaller servers rather than 
just one centralized server. When

server provides a list of available 
smaller servers for the client to 
connect to in order to play.

That disc you slide into your 
game console is the product  
of huge teams and big budgets. 
When Doom was released in 1993, 
industry insiders were stunned 
that a game could cost $200,000 
to make. A modern game budget 
can be 200 times that. To produce 
the smash shooter Call of Duty: 
Black Ops, game developer 
Teyarch had 250 employees 
working for two years.

At meetings, meetings, and 
more meetings, the developer 
(the company that will construct 
the game) pitches its idea to the 
publisher (the company that will

Engines and coding 
The game engine is the core 
software that handles how  
3-D graphics are rendered  
onscreen. Many games use 
off-the-shelf engines, but that 
still leaves thousands of lines 
of program code to be written.

ﬁrst-day game sales when  
it launched in 2010. A 
staggering 5.6 million copies 
were bought in the United 
States and Britain, worth 
around $360 million.
The United States is the biggest 
gaming market, so developers take 
its product ratings very seriously.

Character building 
Artists develop how the scenes, 
objects, and characters will look. 
Game characters begin as 
sketches, then 3-D wire-frame 
models of their bodies are made 
on-screen, with layers and colors 
added on top.

Game text and speech  
are translated and recorded to 
facilitate release in different 
countries. Some game graphics 
or particular scenes may be 
adjusted or deleted to ﬁt in with 
the laws or culture of a  
particular country.

Simulations
A sim is a game that allows you to 
simulate an activity. These range from 
virtual pet games to ﬂight simulators and 
sports management games. Others 
simulate life evolving over several 
generations, or let you build a virtual 
home, town, or world. With more than 90 
million units sold, The Sims is the 
biggest-selling simulation series ever. 
Racing games
Racing sped out of the arcades into 
homes on consoles and computers and 
is popular with all ages. Games such  
as Forza Motorsport, SBK-09, and the 
Gran Turismo series pride themselves 
on racing realism, using accurate models  
of vehicles and famous race circuits. 
Others, such as Mario Kart and Konami 
Krazy Racers, are more fantasy-based. 
Platform games
In the 1980s and early ’90s, about a ﬁfth 
of all games sold were platform games, 
featuring characters that leap between 
suspended platforms or over obstacles in 
different scenes. From Jet Set Willy and 
Donkey Kong to various Sonic and Mario 
games, including Super Mario 64 with its 
3-D game play, platforms are especially 
popular on handheld consoles. 
Role-playing games 
Known as RPGs, these complex games 
prove highly addictive to loyal gamers, 
who generally control a group, or party, 
of characters on various quests. Most 
RPGs are set in fantasy worlds or sci-ﬁ 
settings. Online RPGs with huge 
followings, such as World of Warcraft, 
are known as MMORPGs—massively 
multiplayer online role-playing games. 
Competitive sports
Many new consoles launch with free 
sports titles to attract buyers. From 
basketball to big bass ﬁshing, these 
games are hugely popular, particularly 
with casual gamers. Many top games 
feature real-life sporting champions. The 
top-selling sports game franchise to date 
is the EA Sports FIFA series, which has 
sold more than 65 million copies. 
Puzzles and quizzes
Games that challenge and train your 
brain come in a range of formats, from 
online and handheld trivia quizzes  
to graphic puzzles and cryptic word 
games. Not one is more famous than 
Alexey Pajitnov’s 1984 creation, Tetris. 
More than 100 million copies of the 
falling-blocks puzzle game have been 
sold for mobile phones alone since 2005.
Third-person shooters
From Space Invaders onward, gamers 
have loved third-person shooters, in 
which they control a character moving 
through a game world in the near 
distance. This ﬁgure interacts with objects 
or other characters and, of course, ﬁres all 
kinds of weapons. Enemies may range 
from plague-infested zombies (Resident 
Evil) to armed aliens (Gears of War). 
Games of strategy
Strategy games are usually turn-based, 
tactical games between two players  
or between one player and the computer. 
They include board games such as 
chess, war games such as Command & 
Conquer and Total War, and the 
legendary Civilization series, which 
includes Civilization V for PCs and the 
Internet MMORPG Civilization World.

Like a shape-shifting monster in a sci-ﬁ world, game types  
keep changing and evolving. In the distant past, they fell into  
just two types: slow-moving strategy or adventure games, and 
arcade games requiring quick reactions. Now games are incredibly 
involved and complex. Gran Turismo 4, for instance, has 721 cars 
available to customize and drive. Today there are many different 
game genres. Here are a dozen of the most popular types.
What do you want to play?
Adventure games
Beginning with text-only games in the 
1970s, adventures place the gamer in a 
world to explore. They involve meeting 
characters, collecting clues and objects, 
solving puzzles, and ﬁnding new places. 
Gently paced, early adventures such as 
Zork attracted new players to gaming. 
Compelling games such as Myst and 
Fahrenheit have kept the genre going.
These shooting games place you right  
in the action, looking at the game world 
through your character’s eyes. They got 
a massive boost with the arrival of 3-D 
graphics in games such as Wolfenstein 
3-D and Doom. Some games, such as 
Halo: Reach, have detailed stories and 
such high levels of graphic violence  
that they have an adult-only rating.
Fighting
In the 1980s, most ﬁghting games were 
beat-’em-ups, in which a character had 
to punch, kick, and knock out swarms of 
opponents. The release of Street Fighter II 
in 1991 saw a shift toward one-on-one 
ﬁghting, continued by Mortal Kombat, 
Virtua Fighter, and Tekken. Pressing 
multiple buttons at high speeds produces 
a range of martial-arts-inspired moves.
Got rhythm?
First seen in Japanese arcades, dancing 
games such as Dance Dance Revolution 
and Pump It Up test a player’s rhythm 
and timing as they try to copy on-screen 
dance moves. They were followed by 
games allowing players to show off their 
musical skills, including Guitar Hero and 
the unusual Donkey Konga, which has 
a pair of bongos as the game controller. 
Did you  
know? 
In September 2002, Faiz 
Chopdat became the ﬁrst 
British citizen to be jailed for 
playing Tetris on his mobile 
phone on an aircraft. This is 
against the law because it 
could interfere with 
communications. 
First-person shooters

Console wars
 
A battle is raging for world supremacy. To the victor goes untold 
millions, make that billions, of dollars and dominance. To the loser 
may go defeat, large losses, and a retreat from the game console 
arena. Welcome to the console wars—a ﬁerce competition for 
increased market share between game machines. At the start  
of 2011, it’s a seventh-generation, head-to-head battle between 
Microsoft’s Xbox 360, Sony’s PlayStation 3, and Nintendo’s Wii.   
Did you  
know? 
For much of the 1990s, Sega  
was a key player in the console 
wars. However, several poor-
selling machines in a row saw the 
home of Sonic the Hedgehog 
move out of consoles and into  
computer software by 2001. 
Spectrum vs. C64 
One of the ﬁrst game wars 
occured in the UK in the 1980s 
between the Sinclair Spectrum 
and Commodore C64 computers. 
Millions of games were sold for 
both machines.
Who’s winning where?
Consoles have varying popularity in different regions  
for several reasons. Sony, for example, publishes many 
games that have been historically tailored to the 
Japanese market, whereas the types of games typically 
played by Westerners are more popular on the Xbox. As 
for the Wii, it’s popular everywhere! 
 
Sony PlayStation 3 
46.99 million worldwide 
 
Nintendo Wii  
84.48 million worldwide
 
Microsoft Xbox 360  
51.15 million worldwide
Homegrown
Although the Wii is the best- 
selling machine in the Americas, 
with nearly half the market share, 
the homegrown Xbox 360 also 
does well, generating nearly 59 
percent of total Xbox sales. 
Most ever?
The PS2, ﬁrst released in 2000, is 
the most successful console of all 
time with more than 140 million 
sold. It is still going strong. In 
2010, Sony launched an HD 
television with a built-in PS2. 
Americas
While Brazil and Mexico are growing 
national markets, the United States is  
where the big money is to be had. In 2008, 
the U.S. game industry was worth more 
than $11.7 billion of revenue—equal to  
195 million copies of Call of Duty: Black Ops 
or 3.3 million PS3 consoles.

Wii world conquest
At the moment the Wii is winning. It’s the biggest-
selling console in each region and makes up nearly  
half of all consoles sold worldwide. That’s  
a big turnaround from 2002 when Nintendo’s 
GameCube slumped a distant third behind 
the original Xbox and PlayStation.  
The secret? The Wii’s mix of innovative, 
motion-sensing controllers and family 
titles that attract gamers of all ages.  
But it’s not over yet. In 2010, both  
Sony with Move and Microsoft with 
Kinect (see page 90) launched  
motion-sensing competitors. 
Online revenue
Console manufacturers are making more  
and more money from online services, such as 
downloadable content, upgrades, in-game items, 
and subscription services. Microsoft leads the 
way with its Xbox Live subscription, which as  
of 2011 had more than 30 million members.

Nintendo’s handheld console 
family, the DS, is the undisputed

135 million DSs have been sold, 
including 32 million in Japan and 
more than nine million in the UK. 
Japan
With two of the top three consoles designed 
in Japan, it’s no surprise that the third, the 
Xbox, struggles to compete in this market. 
Sony and Nintendo duel both in the main 
console market and in a separate handheld 
battle between the DS family and Sony’s

in the EMEAA, but plenty of games are 
developed by companies from these areas. 

Role-playing games (RPGs) have been popular ever since 
computers were ﬁrst networked together. Controlling their 
characters, players take part in a story, quest, or adventure  
set in a virtual world. Players must make hundreds of 
decisions as they interact with other players, as well as  
game characters not controlled by players. The largest RPG 
games, Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games 
(MMORPGs), are hugely popular, with millions of participants.
Virtual 
worlds
MUD
In 1978, MUD, short for “Multi-User 
Dungeon” went online. It is 
considered the ﬁrst multiplayer  
online game. MUD was a text 
adventure game in which users picked up points for 
collecting treasure and dropping it into a swamp, or for 
killing other players. Despite access to the game being 
rare in the early eighties, by 1984, more than 20,000 
playing hours had been notched up in MUD.
Runescape
With more than 10 million active 
users, Runescape is the world’s largest 
free MMORPG. It began in 2001, 
developed by two brothers, Andrew and 
Paul Gower, and was initially run from 
their parents’ house in Nottingham, 
England. Runescape players chat, trade, and go on quests 
or enter different types of combat with other players. Now 
run by Jagex, up to 340,000 people can enter the 
fantasy world of Gielinor and play simultaneously.
Kesmai
In 1985, a multiplayer 
online game called Island 
of Kesmai was launched, 
a forerunner of today’s 
MMORPGs. Players had to pay $12 per hour for 
connection to the game. Island of Kesmai supported up 
to 100 users playing at the same time. Today, World of 
Warcraft can have more than a million people 
playing at one time. 
NetEase
Many games charge a 
subscription to play, which 
means serious money. Chinese 
company NetEase, current 
operator of World of Warcraft 
in China, received  
$1.59 billion in online 
game revenues in three  
months in 2009. 
Hattrick
RPGs are not all about slaying  
warlocks or battling alien hordes. 
Hattrick is a soccer management 
MMORPG in which players buy  
and sell players, and employ a range of tactics as they  
try to outsmart other teams. Launched in Sweden  
in 1997, it had more than  
800,000 players by 2010.
Goods and services in Second Life are paid for in Linden 
dollars, which can be bought using real dollars. In 2010, 
L$255 equalled one dollar. 
Second Life
Launched by the company Linden Lab in 2003, 
Second Life is an MMORPG with its own economy 
and three land masses to travel between. 
Second Life players can own land, build their 
own objects from cubes, and even start their own 
businesses. In 2006, Ailen Greff (as her Second Life 
character Anshe Chung) became the ﬁrst virtual 
millionaire, mainly through buying and selling land 
inside Second Life.
The price a premium member of Second Life needs 
to buy their ﬁrst 705,000 sq ft (65,536 sq m) plot of 
virtual land is $295.

Gaming addiction
With their ever-changing worlds and evolving 
characters, MMORPG gamers can get over-absorbed 
in the experience. For some, the games can prove 
seriously addictive. Treatment centers for game addicts 
have opened in China, South Korea, the Netherlands,  
and the United States.
In 2006, a law was introduced in China limiting  
online gamers under the age of 18 to three hours of 
continuous play at a time. 
South Korean MMORPG addict Seungseob Lee, died

Computer technicians wrote 
primitive versions of chess and 
checkers in the 1950s, but it wasn’t 
until the 1970s that gaming took 
off. Video-game fans mainly hung 
out in arcades, but gaming was also 
possible at home on computers and 
game consoles. Since then, each 
new generation of console has 
brought better graphics and 
amazing new games.

“There are a lot of 
people [in the gaming 
industry] because 
they love games… 
Graphics and games 
are probably the most 
generally rewarding 
area of programming.”  
John D. Carmack, 2000, American game programmer 
Graphics in games remained 
blocky and ﬂat until the arrival  
of 3-D gaming. One of the key 
people responsible was  
John D. Carmack, cofounder of  
id Software. Lead programmer 
on such groundbreaking  
games as Wolfenstein 3D and 
the Doom and Quake series, 
Carmack pioneered techniques 
to render graphics more quickly 
and make scenes more realistic, 
popularizing ﬁrst-person 
shooters. His game engines have 
also been used on titles such as 
Call of Duty and Half-Life.

Digital 
camera
Digital cameras focus light through a lens onto  
an electronic image sensor made up of a grid of 
thousands of microscopic photosites. These convert 
the light energy into electrical energy, which is 
processed inside the camera’s electronics to 
produce an image that you can save to memory, and 
later print, e-mail, or upload to a photo-sharing site.

photographers, stores its photos on 
CompactFlash memory cards. Its image 
sensor can capture images with a 
resolution of up to 4,368 x 2,912 pixels.

1 Viewﬁnder
The viewﬁnder of an SLR camera 
obtains a through-the-lens view by 
using a mirror to direct the image from 
the lens up to the viewﬁnder. When  
an image is taken, the mirror ﬂips up, 
allowing light to hit the sensor instead.
2 LCD display
Measuring 2.5 in (6 cm) diagonally, 
the rear LCD (liquid crystal display) 
screen is made up of around 230,000 
pixels. It can display menu and 
setting options but also allows you  
to review pictures immediately after 
they are taken.
3 Mainboard
The camera’s main board contains  
its image processors and associated 
control microchips. The DIGIC II image 
processor receives electrical signals 
from the sensor and processes them 
into an image that is saved to memory.
4 Hot shoe
This bracket accepts the base of an 
external mountable ﬂash gun—used 
to produce a ﬂash of additional light 
in time with the camera shutter 
opening to obtain a bright image in 
dark or low-light conditions.
5 Shutter release button
The camera’s shutter opens and 
closes rapidly, allowing a precise 
amount of light in to hit the sensor. 
Slow shutter speeds create motion 
blur, while fast shutter speeds are 
used to capture and freeze motion.
“They said digital would  
kill photography because 
everyone can do it... It makes 
photography interesting 
because everyone thinks 
they can take a picture.”

6 Lens mount
The lens mount allows a lens to ﬁrmly 
click into place. It aligns electrical 
contracts from the camera and lens 
so that when camera is set to 
autofocus it can instruct the motors 
in the lens to turn to focus the image.
Lens
This 50 mm lens is described as prime 
or ﬁxed, meaning it cannot change 
how closely it views the scene. Zoom 
lenses, however, can zoom closer or 
farther away from the subject.
7 Focus mode switch
Powered by a motor, the lens can be 
focused automatically by the camera. 
For more creative control, the 
photographer can focus by hand  
after ﬂipping the switch to manual.
8 Focusing ring
This control allows the photographer 
to focus the lens manually by turning 
the ring until the image looks sharp, 
either through the viewﬁnder or on 
the rear LCD screen. 
9 Lens thread
A screw thread allows circular glass 
ﬁlters to be screwed onto the front of 
the lens. Filters protect the lens and 
can enhance images by letting more or 
less of particular frequencies of light in.

Digital 
photography
Before the arrival of digital cameras, most cameras used  
a strip of chemically coated ﬁlm that reacted with light  
to create a photograph. Digital cameras have since taken 
over, built into everything from children’s toys and mobile 
phones to the high-quality SLR (single-lens reﬂex) 
cameras used by professional photographers. For many, 
the best feature of digital photography is that images can 
be manipulated and transmitted via the Internet. 
The most popular ﬁlm format was 35 mm, 
which came in rolls of 12 to 39 exposures 
(images). Digital cameras store photos as 
image ﬁles, usually on memory cards. A 
4-GB Secure Digital (SD) card, a common 
size, can hold more than 1,000 images. The 
largest SD cards, at 2 terabytes, are  
512 times larger. 
Image storage
Film photographers developed their 
images in light-free darkrooms. Serious 
digital photographers use their computers 
as darkrooms. Photo-imaging software 
can alter lighting, remove blemishes, and 
apply effects. Then, the ﬁnal image is 
printed out on a photo-quality printer. 
The digital darkroom

Quality photographs
Digital cameras give more control. 
Users can determine the quality and ﬁle 
size of their images and delete pictures 
they don’t like. The quality of the ﬁnal 
image depends on various factors, 
including the camera’s image-sensor 
resolution, often measured in 
megapixels (millions of pixels), and the 
quality of the lens. However, as with 
ﬁlm photography, the most crucial 
ingredient is the skill of the person 
taking the picture. 
Digital images online
Stored as computer ﬁles, digital images are 
easy to e-mail to others or upload onto 
the Internet. Online apps allow users to 
play with their photos, turning them into 
game avatars or personalized greeting 
cards. Photographers can sell their 
images through online image libraries 
or share them on photo sites, such  
as Flickr, Snapﬁsh, Picasa, and 
Photobucket. 
In-camera editing
Many digital cameras allow users to 
edit and alter an image while it is 
still held in the camera’s memory. 
This can involve changing the color 
or exposure level, cropping in close, 
or applying special effects ﬁlters—
for example, to transform a color 
photo into a sepia one or apply a 
texture like that of a painting. 
A morphing ﬁlter pulls  
the image out of shape. 
A color ﬁlter gives  
the image a red tint.
A mosaic ﬁlter breaks the 
image up into small tiles.

An increasing number  
of digital cameras have 
built-in Wi-Fi. Users can 
upload their snapshots to  
a website straight from  
the camera.

If the idea is good enough, 
it’s going to appear pretty 
crazy to almost everybody. 
Either you do it yourself or

Clive Sinclair 
Fascinated with shrinking technology and 
making it more affordable, English inventor  
Sir Clive Sinclair (born 1940) developed 
matchbox-sized radios, pocket TVs,  
pioneering digital watches, and, in 1972,  
the world’s ﬁrst pocket calculator. In  
1980, he introduced the world’s smallest,  
cheapest computer, the ZX80, followed  
by the best-selling ZX81 and Spectrum home 
computers. Despite the failure of his C5 
electric vehicle, Sinclair continued to invent 
unusual vehicles, including tiny folding bikes 
and the SeaScooter underwater transporter.

Seoul plans to become even more 
wired. Its Ubiquitous Seoul or U-City 
project plans to link everyone and 
everything electronically. Computer 
networks will control the appliances 
in smart apartments, while smart 
cards will track individual travelers  
via radio waves. 
While some parts of the world 
struggle for Internet access  
and remain on the wrong side  
of the digital divide, others are 
thriving. Their governments and 
industries have invested heavily 
to provide fast, plentiful, and free 
(or relatively cheap) broadband, 
Wi-Fi hotspots, and strong 
mobile phone links. There are 
plans to help people get the  
very most out of the available 
technology. In the world’s most 
wired cities, information is never 
more than a mouse click or  
a touchscreen tap away.
Wired cities
Always in touch 
A girl uses the touchscreen of an Irobi 
personal robot in a Seoul department 
store. South Korea is home to many 
manufacturers of high-tech products. Its 
capital was the ﬁrst city in the world to 
run a Digital Mobile Broadcasting (DMB) 
plan, bringing TV stations and other 
services direct to mobile phones.
Seoul, South Korea 
Seoul is the world’s most wired city. More than  
93 percent of its households have broadband. In 
many countries, broadband runs at 10–50 megabits 
per second (Mbps). By 2012, Seoul’s broadband will 
run at 1,000 Mbps. The city is home to electronics 
giant Samsung. Other companies at the cutting edge 
of technology, including Microsoft, Nokia, and Cisco, 
use Seoul as a living laboratory, testing many new 
products there before releasing them worldwide. 

Tallinn, Estonia
The capital of Estonia is  
a beautiful medieval city, which 
just happens to be one of the 
most wired in Europe. Every seat 
in the parliament and town hall 
features a laptop, most bank 
transactions are performed 
online, and Estonians pay for 
travel tickets and parking ﬁnes 
using their mobile phones.
Seattle, 
Washington
The northern seaport of Seattle  
is home to Microsoft, Amazon,  
the enormous digital picture library 
Getty Images, and a host of other 
high-tech companies. The city 
boasts powerful broadband access, 
which is provided free to local 
community groups, as well as  
Wi-Fi on buses and in parks.

Interacting 
with new 
technology
Technology is changing all around us and  
the old ways of controlling it may have to move 
aside. If even more technologies are to become 
part of our lives, and work seamlessly with us, 
devices and systems will need to offer simpler, 
more convenient, intuitive, and rewarding ways  
of interacting with them.  
Remote control
A number of different types of 
signals can now be used to control 
appliances remotely, from infrared 
for your television remote, to 
Bluetooth on mobile phones and 
some laptops. Exciting applications 
are now applying remote control 
over long distances. They use the 
Internet to carry commands and 
deliver them to personal robots and 
other Wi-Fi–enabled devices.
D Remote robot
This WowWee Rovio mobile 
webcam relies on Wi-Fi. It 
can send images to and 
be controlled by users 
anywhere in the world, 
as long as they have an 
Internet-enabled device.
J Radio control
A child uses a radio 
transmitter to fly a glider. 
When the glider receives 
the signals sent out by the 
handheld transmitter, its 
electric motors move  
parts of the aircraft.
A Eurofighter Typhoon
Some planes allow a pilot 
to switch radar mode, 
control displays, and 
perform navigation tasks 
using voice commands. 
J Taking dictation
The latest speech-
recognition software can 
generate almost error-free 
dictation. It recognizes 
spoken words and turns 
them into a text document 
in real time.
RFIDs  
Radio Frequency Identification 
(RFID) tags send a radio signal 
either constantly or when scanned. 
Warehouses and delivery firms use 
the tags for tracking. They are also 
attached to vehicles for toll roads 
and found in public-transportation 
smartcards. In Denmark’s Legoland 
theme park, parents can rent RFID 
bracelets that track, alert, and 
locate children who get lost. 
D The Xtag
This electronic ankle tag 
uses RFID technology. It 
enables hospital employees 
to keep track of patients, 
particularly the young 
and elderly, who may not 
be able to say who they are. 
D Immersive VR
A research scientist at the 
Earth Simulator Center in 
Yokohama, Japan, explores 
a VR model of the Earth. VR 
is used in science to study 
complex structures from 
any viewpoint or angle.
Voice power
Speech is natural, easy for most 
people to produce, and leaves the 
hands free for other tasks. The main 
challenges for voice-controlled 
technology are canceling out 
background noise and recognizing  
a massive spoken vocabulary. These 
are being overcome, and voice control 
is already being used for noncritical 
functions in vehicles, smartphones, 
computers, and game play.

Touchscreens 
The first touch sensor was 
developed in 1971. During their  
short history, touchscreens became 
the most natural way of controlling 
digital organizers in the 1990s, and 
then smartphones and tablets. What 
next? Large smart surfaces can now 
respond to many people’s command 
gestures at the same time. They can 
also recognize an object placed on 
the surface, calling up information 
about the object. 
J The Ring Wall
Located in Nürburg, 
Germany, this giant 
touch screen is bigger 
than 5,500 computer 
screens. It supports 
multi-touch gestures by 
up to 80 people at once. 
Gesture- and 
motion-sensing
These systems use cameras to 
capture and isolate a person’s 
movements, then match them to 
similar moves in their memory to 
perform commands. For example, 
a swipe of the hand might turn a 
web page, and a flat palm facing 
forward might pause a program. 
Already popular in game  
consoles, such systems may  
soon work on mobile devices.
D Step on it

VR places a person inside a  
computer-simulated environment  
that appears real to the senses. The 
virtual world is projected inside a 
head-mounted display (HMD) and 
interaction is possible via a controller 
fitted with sensors. VR is used by the 
military and in industry for teaching, 
engineering tasks, and testing new 
product design. 
J Gesture sensing

Computing power increases rapidly 
each year. The 1970s supercomputer 
Cray 1, designed by Seymour Cray 
(see right), was rated at around  
100 megaﬂops—slower than  
an Xbox 360 or PS3 game console!  
You’ve been lucky enough to get 
a pass into China’s National 
Supercomputing Center, based 
in the northern city of Tianjin. 
Supercomputers are the beasts 
that governments, universities, 
and industry use to tackle 
massive computing tasks. 
What stands before you, housed 
in 103 chilled cabinets, is the 
world’s most powerful computer, 
the Tianhe-1A. It has more 
processing power than 175,000 
top-of-the-line laptop PCs. 
Supercomputers
Top of  
the ﬂops
“Flops” (ﬂoating-point operations  
per second) are one way to measure  
a computer’s performance. Home PCs 
can perform at thousands, even 
millions of ﬂops, but the top 
supercomputers work in petaﬂops—a 
quadrillion calculations per second! 
The Tianhe-1A’s peak speed is  
more than 2.5 petaﬂops.

In the past
One man, electrical engineer 
Seymour Cray, dominated 
supercomputer design for 
decades and continues in the 
ﬁeld today. He worked on the 
world’s ﬁrst commercial 
supercomputer, 1964’s CDC 
6600, before forming his own 
company. Many of Cray’s early 
designs, such as the 1984 
X-MP/48 (above), were circular 
to help reduce the distance that 
processing signals had to travel. 
What do they do?
Supercomputers are often put to work 
modeling how galaxies move and 
collide (left), how major weather 
systems form and move, what 
happens to all the particles in a major 
explosion, or how atoms behave in  
a chemical reaction. All these tasks 
involve mind-numbing amounts of 
calculation that would take too long 
on regular computers—or even be 
impossible to do.

Big beast
The Tianhe-1A contains 14,336 Xeon 
X5670 processors and 7,168 Nvidia   
Tesla M2050 graphics cards. It cost 
around $88 million to build and costs  
an additional $20 million a year to run. Its 
jobs include modeling weather patterns 
and number-crunching  
for oil exploration.
“The scientiﬁc research 
that is now possible with 
a system of this scale is 
almost without limits.” 
Guangming Liu, chief of the  
National Supercomputer Center, China

Artiﬁcial 
intelligence
American artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) pioneer Marvin 
Minsky described AI as “the science of making 
machines do things that require intelligence if 
done by men.” That is just one deﬁnition. AI draws 
on many subjects, from computing to psychology. 
At its cutting edge, it can involve creating 
machines that can compete with humans.
Machine perception 
The process of seeing an object, 
recognizing what it is, and recalling 
stored information about it—a 
process called perception—comes 
naturally to humans. Researchers  
in the ﬁeld of machine perception 
are trying create computers that  
can do this too. Machines have to 
use sensors, such as cameras, to 
“see” their surroundings, and then 
process and store the data to build 
up a model of the world.
 D Robot marathon
The ﬁrst ever robot marathon 
in Osaka, Japan, in 2011 was 
won by a robot that used 
aspects of AI to follow the 
42-km- (26-mile-) long 
course autonomously, 
without human intervention.
 A Nexi
Robot Nexi is able to 
view and map the 
features on a human  
face to ﬁgure out what 
emotion it is showing. 
Then, in response, it puts 
a suitable expression  
on its own face. 
The future
Despite AI’s frustratingly slow 
progress, many people remain 
optimistic about its future. These 
include the inventor, author, and 
lecturer Ray Kurzweil. In 2010, he 
predicted that “Machines will follow 
a path that mirrors the evolution of 
humans. Ultimately, however, 
self-aware, self-improving machines 
will evolve beyond humans’ ability 
to control or even understand them.”
J Talk of the future
Kurzweil is an inventor  
and pioneer of many 
technologies including music 
synthesizers and machines 
capable of speech. He 
believes that further boosts  
in computing power will  
lead to major advances in AI.
Intelligent cars
AI research is working toward 
driverless vehicles (with no 
human remote control) that can 
navigate a route, obey trafﬁc rules, 
and avoid obstacles. The cars 
must process information from 
cameras, laser range-ﬁnders, and 
other instruments. In 2007, the  
U.S. Department of Defense tested  
11 driverless cars over a 60-mile 
(96 km) course that mimicked city 
streets. Six reached the end. 
D Boss in action
The winner of the 
Department of Defense’s 
challenge was a vehicle 
called Boss. The prize 
was $2 million. 

What’s on TV?
In 2011, the trivia quiz show  
Jeopardy! featured its ﬁrst nonhuman 
contestant. The Watson program runs 
on a cluster of fast servers, contains a 
giant database of facts, and, most 
importantly, can understand slang and 
puns. Before buzzing to answer, 
Watson has to narrow down choices, 
make decisions, and build conﬁdence 
in its answers by running thousands 
of checks and comparisons. It may 
revolutionize machine learning.
Playing chess 
In 2006, Russian Vladimir Kramnik 
was the chess champion of the 
world. Then he took on a computer 
running the Deep Fritz chess 
program and lost 2–4. With its 
complex moves and strategy, chess 
has long been used as a test of 
machine intelligence. IBM’s Deep 
Blue chess program, which defeated 
Russian grand master Garry Kasparov 
2–1 in 1996, was able to analyze as 
many as 200 million different moves.

contest against Deep Fritz. 
The chess tournament took 
place in Bonn, Germany,  
in December 2006.
Social learning 
Researchers are developing 
machines that learn new tasks  
and skills by having them work 
alongside and interact with 
humans. Robots such as Leonardo 
bring us a step nearer to the goal of 
a truly intelligent machine. Instead 
of being programmed for every task, 
they build up understanding in the 
same way that humans do—by 
mimicking the actions and  
behavior of other humans. 
A Leonardo
Fitted with a camera, the 
robot Leonardo is capable of 
recognizing and remembering 
faces it has seen before. It can 
also track objects that it is 
familiar with, moving its head 
to follow the object’s path.

In February 2011 on  
its ﬁrst network TV 
appearance, Watson 
defeated two former 
Jeopardy! champions, 
Brad Rutter and  
Ken Jennings.

Controller
The controller is the processor  
or “brain” of the robot. It keeps  
all the parts of the robot working 
together and makes decisions 
based on feedback sent to it  
from the sensors.
What 
makes a 
robot?
What is a robot?
A robot is an automated machine 
that can be programmed to 
perform a range of tasks, such as 
this industrial robot arm playing a 
game. A robot is able to react to 
events in its surroundings and 
make decisions. Some of its parts 
are capable of movement. 
Robots inhabited science ﬁction movies 
and stories long before they became 
scientiﬁc fact. The ﬁrst robots emerged 
in the 1960s and have since exploded  
in range, size, and versatility. Robots  
tend to perform humanlike actions  
but with greater precision, repetition,  
or force than we can ever manage, or  
in locations we cannot or dare not visit. 
Core components
Robots vary greatly in shape, form, 
and function, but most have similar 
key parts enabling them to work 
effectively and efﬁciently. The  
vast majority of robots rely on 
microprocessors and electronics.
Did you know? 
The word “robot” comes from the 
Czech word robota meaning “forced 
labor.” It was ﬁrst used in 1920 in 
Karel Capek’s play, Rossum’s 
Universal Robots, in which 
humanlike machines  
enslaved people.
Sensors
Devices like touch detectors, 
GPS, cameras, and temperature 
sensors send data called 
feedback back to the controller. 
These sensors report the 
robot’s condition and position.
End effector
Many robots have parts called end 
effectors that interact with the 
environment or manipulate objects. 
An industrial robot arm, for example, 
can be ﬁtted with different tools to 
perform a range of tasks.

What is autonomy? 
Some robots can work for  
long periods without human 
intervention or guidance.  
There are autonomous robot 
submarines, for example, that 
can navigate away from rocks, 
icebergs, and other obstacles 
without any assistance.
Why are robots useful? 
Robots free us from having to 
perform many dull, unpleasant, or 
repetitive tasks in industry, such  
as welding, placing hot metal parts, 
and spray-painting. They can often 
work faster and for longer periods 
than people, performing tasks 
beyond our strength or accuracy. 
How many robots are there? 
In November 2010, IFR World 
Robotics estimated that there were 
8.6 million robots around the world. 
Many work in factories, while 
robotics researchers use challenges 
such as robotic soccer (below) to 
study how robots can share 
information and work together.
Moving parts
Some robots may be ﬁxed in place, 
but can move parts such as a jointed 
arm. Each direction that all or part  
of a robot can move in is called  
a degree of freedom.
Drive system 
Robots need power and systems to 
move their parts. Drive systems may 
use electric motors, or hydraulic 
systems using cylinders and pistons 
full of liquids.

Types of 
robots
Robots come in all shapes and sizes, from the 
tiniest micro aerial vehicles to huge, heavy-lifters 
used in industry, construction, and space. These 
hard-working machines perform all kinds of dirty, 
dangerous, or boring tasks for us. They crawl 
through sewers, check chemical plants for toxic 
leaks, defuse bombs—and even ﬂip burgers!
D Bomb disposal
A French military  
bomb-disposal robot 
approaches an 
unexploded car bomb.  
It will blast a jet of water  
into the bomb to  
disrupt its circuits.
Military robots
In many countries the military has 
helped fund robotics research, 
as well as deploying robots for a 
range of tasks. In the air, unmanned 
aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used for 
surveillance of enemy locations. On 
the ground, robots patrol military 
compounds as security guards 
or move ahead of human troops, 
ﬁnding and disarming unexploded 
bombs and mines. 
Entertainers and 
educators 
Robots displayed in museums or 
at events always fascinate and 
entertain. Building simple robots 
is a hands-on way to learn about 
mechanics, electronics, and 
computing, as well as robotics. With 
kits such as LEGO Mindstorms™, 
hobbyists can build, modify, and 
program their own machines. 
J Robo dog
In 1999, the Sony AIBO 
thrilled owners with its 
ability to respond to 
speech commands in 
Spanish or English, take 
pictures with its cameras, 
and learn from its 
environment. 
A Sony QRIO
The singing, dancing 
QRIO humanoid robot, 
created in 2003, stood  
24 in (60 cm) tall. It had  
38 joints and “ran” at  
9 in (23 cm) per second—
fairly fast for a biped robot. 
Industrial robots  
More than a million robots work 
in factories around the world. 
Automated Guided Vehicles 
(AGVs) transport materials from 
place to place, while high-speed 
robot arms work on production 
lines, assembling, spray-painting, 
and welding. A small but growing 
number of robots work in mining, 
demolition, and other industries.
J Demolition droids

Research robots 
Right now, robotics researchers are 
designing, testing, and perfecting 
new robots. Some of these robots 
are prototypes of machines that will 
eventually go out into the world—or 
even into space. Others will remain in  
the lab, helping researchers to perfect 
sensing or movement technologies, or  
to investigate how a robot can learn  
from experience or interact.
J Learning with Cog
MIT’s Cog robot was built  
to learn more about how a 
robot can sense touch, adjust 
its grip, and coordinate its 
parts like a human.
A Robot rovers So far, 
robots have only been 
able to travel very 
slowly on Mars.  
However, these robot 
explorer balls developed 
for NASA are light 
enough for Martian 
winds to blow them 
across the surface.
J Production line pals
 At this Kia factory in 
Slovakia, industrial 
robots are spot-welding 
car chassis. The factory 
uses 410 robots to 
produce more than 
200,000 vehicles a year. 
Service and security
Large numbers of robots work 
in service industries performing 
simple, repetitive tasks—cleaning 
skyscraper windows or airport 
concourse ﬂoors, mowing lawns, 
or ferrying supplies from place to 
place. Some even work directly with 
people as guides, waiters, security 
guards, and house sitters.
D Fire bot
The Japanese Guardrobo 
D1 can operate as a 
warehouse or ofﬁce 
security guard. It patrols 
buildings, investigates 
disturbances, and  
can detect and 
extinguish ﬁres.
J Restaurant robot
This is one of four 
Motoman robot waiters 
working in the Hajime 
Restaurant in Bangkok, 
Thailand. Diners can 
order their meal by

“Robots have been into the 
deepest oceans. They’ve 
been to Mars. They’re just 
starting to come into your 
home. You could think of 
your living room as their 
Final Frontier.”

Did you know? 
Breazeal built Leonardo with 
help from Stan Winston, the 
Oscar-winning special effects 
creator behind the monsters 
in Aliens, Terminator, 
Predator, Jurassic Park, and 
many other movies. 
Cynthia Breazeal 
Ever since seeing the ﬁrst Star Wars ﬁlm, Cynthia Breazeal 
(born 1967) has been fascinated by robotics. The author of  
the book Designing Sociable Robots, Breazeal is now director of 
the Personal Robots Group at the MIT Media Lab. She 
specializes in building robots such as Leonardo and Nexi that 
can interact with people and produce “emotional responses.” 
Kismet (pictured), her most famous robot, reacts to human 
voices, movements, and expressions with speech,  
smiles, winks, and frowns of its own. 

Mars 
Rover
Landing on a cushion of giant air  
bags in January 2004 after a  
seven-month, 280-million-mile 
(450-million-km) journey, the 
Mars Exploration Rovers A 
and B (named Spirit and 
Opportunity) were 
designed to perform a 
90-day mission. They far 
exceeded expectations and 
Opportunity is still roving 
around Mars in 2011.
1 Twin pancams
A pair of panoramic cameras on the 
rover’s mast tilt and swivel around  
as they take high-resolution images  
of the robot’s environment. These  
are processed together to form 
stunning 360-degree views of the 
Martian surface.
2 Solar arrays
The robot needs lots of electricity, 
which is provided by solar panels.  
They generate about 140 watts of 
power when fully lit up by the Sun. 
Rechargeable batteries store energy  
to keep the rover running overnight.
3 Warm box
The body holds its key electronics  
in a warmed box, because nighttime 
temperatures on Mars can drop to 
below -139°F (-95°C). The box holds  
the robot’s computer, which runs at 
less than one hundredth the speed  
of a home PC.
4 High-gain antenna
For around three hours a day, the Earth 
and Mars are aligned in such a way 
that the robot can transmit and receive 
signals directly, swiveling the 12-in-  
(30-cm-) wide dish so it faces Earth.

Opportunity has traveled more 
than 87,600 ft (26,700 m) up and 
down craters and is still going. On 
its way, the robot and its twin, 
Spirit, have sent back thousands of 
images and measurements of 
Mars. The robots have also made 
crucial discoveries, including 
strong evidence that water once 
ﬂowed on the surface of the planet.
“I’ve often said that 
I have the best job 
on two planets, and 
you can believe it.”

5 Mobility system
All six wheels are driven by electric 
motors with independent steering of 
both the front and rear pair. The wheels 
are mounted on a suspension system, 
allowing the robot to tilt severely 
without toppling, and to roll over rocks 
more than 8 in (20 cm) in diameter.
6 Microscopic imager
Mounted on the robot’s jointed arm, 
this camera can take detailed images 
of soil and rock particles as small as 
0.04 in (0.1 mm) across.
7 Rock abrasion tool
The rock abrasion tool is a tiny 
grinderlike device that rubs away 
small slivers of weathered Martian 
rock so that other instruments can 
work on the clean, pure rock below.
How it moves
With radio signals taking  
20 minutes to reach Mars, 
controlling a robot in real time is 
impossible. NASA’s robot drivers 
plan the next day’s movement as 
instructions, which are uploaded 
to the robot for the next day.
Step 1
The rover takes images of the 
terrain ahead using navigation 
cameras ﬁtted to the mast. These 
images are analyzed to build up a 
3-D picture of the ground ahead.
Step 2
From its photos and data, the 
robot rover builds a map that 
identiﬁes obstacles to avoid and 
the areas that are safe to drive 
through. It can then plot the  
ideal path forward.

Behind the scenes
Support robots in hospitals do 
jobs such as cleaning ﬂoors  
and dispensing drugs. The 
Robot-Rx can handle a dozen 
prescriptions a minute as it scans 
bar codes and selects the right 
drug and dosage from the 
pharmacy. This robot dispenses 
around 500 million medications 
each year in U.S. hospitals. 
In the ward
Reducing the workload on 
orderlies and nursing staff, 
automated guided vehicles 
(AGVs) can fetch and carry 
blankets, food, and supplies, 
saving hundreds of working 
hours. Robots may soon assist 
with the direct care of patients, 
lifting people out of bed or 
alerting human medical staff  
if a patient falls. 
Robotic replacements
Advances in technology are 
improving the latest generations 
of replacement body parts, 
including artiﬁcial arms and legs. 
Packed with microprocessors 
and sensors, smart prosthetic 
limbs can adjust the amount  
of ﬂex or stiffness in the joints, 
making it easier for the wearer  
to lift, bend, or walk.  
Operating room
Robots such as the Da Vinci  
(see right) are becoming a more 
common sight in the operating 
room. Surgical assistants such 
as ROBODOC have carried out 
more than 24,000 knee or hip 
replacement operations, and can 
drill, cut, and grip with more 
accuracy than a human hand. 
Another robot, Neuromate, can 
even perform brain surgery. 
Robots are at work in hospitals, 
performing a surprisingly varied 
range of tasks. If you ﬁnd yourself 
in the hospital at some point in 
the future, chances are that some 
part of your stay will be assisted 
by robots. They might deliver your 
meals, prescribe your drugs, or 
return you to the ward from the 
operating room. Robots might 
even perform surgery on you—
they are already involved in 
thousands of operations a year. 
Robot  
hospital 
In the future, medical staff may send 
microscopic robots into patients’ 
bodies, through cavities or tiny 
incisions. These tiny machines  
would be able to diagnose problems  
and ﬁx them from the inside. 
1 Scientists hope that the microTec 
submarine (below, imagined inside a 
human artery), built up from layers of 
acrylic just 0.0004 in (0.001 mm) thick, 
might one day travel along blood 
vessels, repairing damage from within. 
1 In the distant future, even tinier 
nanorobots, built to the scale of atoms, 
might be injected into your body to  
ﬁght diseased cells directly.
Working from the inside

First responders
Rescue robots can help at  
the scene of a disaster or 
accident. They can clamber 
over or through rubble to ﬁnd 
victims using thermal-imaging 
cameras, and make contact 
with rescuers. They can also 
deliver life-saving oxygen, 
water, or medicine. 
The DEKA Arm
Advanced prosthetic limbs can  
give an amputee almost the same 
range of movement as a human 
arm. The DEKA weighs around  
8 lb (3.6 kg)—about the same as a 
woman’s arm. It contains numerous 
microprocessors and compact 
electric motors to control movement.
MySpoon
Designed by SECOM in Japan, the 
award-winning MySpoon arm helps 
the ill, disabled, or elderly at meal 
times by scooping up manageable 
portions of food and raising them  
to the person’s mouth. Operated by 
a single push button, it can handle 
any food—from soup to spaghetti.
CareBot and NurseBot
Researchers are working on 
prototype personal robotic 
companions to help care for the 
elderly. CareBot (left) and NurseBot 
could help patients with exercises, 
remind them to take medicine, raise 
the alarm in an emergency, and act  
as a link to the outside world. 
Tmsuk Enryu
This powerful Japanese “rescue  
dragon” robot stands 11.5 ft (3.5 m) 
tall and can tear off car doors so  
that medical staff can reach victims 
trapped inside. Each of its twin robot  
arms is able to lift up to 1,100 lb  
(500 kg), making them strong enough 
to carry people to safety.
Da Vinci
Providing 3-D images from inside 
the body, this multi-armed robot 
works with pinpoint precision 
under the control of a human 
surgeon. More than 1,500 
hospitals worldwide have one  
or more da Vincis, and these 
robots perform hundreds of 
thousands of operations a year. 
The HelpMate
Created by Joseph Engelberger  
(see page 135), HelpMates roll 
quietly around hospitals, ferrying 
drugs, blankets, meals, and other 
essentials. They use light direction 
and range (LIDAR) scanners to track 
light, determine direction, and ﬁgure 
out their distance from obstacles.

Space
Airless, waterless, freezing-cold space  
is the ultimate challenge for exploration. 
Robots are usually sent on one-way 
missions never to return, but the  
results of their work—thousands of 
photographs and scientiﬁc readings— 
can be beamed back to Earth. 
Sky
Flying robots have many uses. They  
are used to explore and map isolated 
areas, from remote forests to icy wastes, 
and to spy on enemy territory. The 
Robofalcon has a less impressive but 
no less important job—scaring bird 
ﬂocks away from airport runways. 
Robots make excellent explorers.  
They do not need the oxygen, water, 
and food that human explorers 
demand. Instead, they use batteries  
or fuel cells, or even generate their own 
energy from solar panels. Robots can 
also be sent on high-risk journeys with 
little or no hope of return. The toughest 
ones are built to withstand extremes, 
from the pressures of the ocean depths 
to the temperatures in space, which 
average a bitter -427 °F (-255 °C)  
but can reach hundreds of degrees. 
Robot 
explorers
Voyager 1
Launched in 1977, this long-distance 
space probe is still sending back data. 
Voyager 1 is now in the outer reaches 
of the Solar System after a 13-billion-
mile (22-billion km) journey past Jupiter, 
Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
Viking landers
In July 1976, after a 10-month journey 
through space, Viking 1 landed on Mars. 
It was followed, about 6 weeks later, by 
Viking 2. The robots took the ﬁrst color 
images of the planet’s surface. Their arms 
picked up and analyzed soil samples, and 
then radioed the results back to Earth. 
Global Hawk
This military Unmanned Aerial Vehicle 
(UAV) has a 116 ft (35.4 m) wingspan 
and is used to explore large areas of 
terrain in a single ﬂight. Its onboard 
surveillance equipment includes 
high-resolution cameras and radar.
QinetiQ Zephyr
This solar-powered robot with a 74 ft 
(22.5 m) wingspan is designed to ﬂy 
slowly, but for long periods, carrying out 
aerial photography or surveillance at low 
cost. In July 2010, it ﬂew nonstop for  
a staggering 14 days and 21 minutes.
Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs)
Still under development, MAVs are robot 
ﬂiers, often no bigger than your hand, 
intended for local exploration, aerial 
photography, and police surveillance. 
One day, squadrons of MAVs may ﬂy 
search-and-rescue missions. 
Canadarm2
Astronauts can ride on this giant robot 
arm attached to the International Space 
Station, in orbit 220 miles (350 km) 
above the Earth. Canadarm2 is 57.7 ft 
(17.6 m) long and can handle payloads 
weighing up to 226,000 lb (116,000 kg). 

Nereus
Powered by 2,000 lithium-ion batteries, 
Nereus is a 14 ft (4.25 m) long robot 
sub. In 2009, it explored the Paciﬁc’s 
Challenger Deep trench at a depth of 
35,768 ft (10,902 m). Only one robot, 
Kaiko (see page 135), has dived deeper.
Land
Land robots have crossed deserts, found 
meteorites in Antarctica, and inched into 
the mouths of active volcanoes. Other 
land explorers may not make the news 
but still perform vital work such as 
seeking out cracks or leaks in pipelines. 
Pyramid explorers
Small robots may unlock the mysteries 
that lie inside the 4,600-year-old Great 
Pyramid at Giza, Egypt. Just 4.7 in  
(12 cm) tall and 1.9 in (5 cm) wide, 
iRobot’s rover has tracks on its top  
and bottom for gripping the ﬂoor or roof.
Autosubs under Antartica
The hostile waters around Antarctica 
claimed the Autosub 2 robot in 2005. 
Four years later, Autosub 3, powered 
by 5,000 D-cell batteries, dived  
beneath 1,640 ft (500 m) of solid ice  
to explore the ﬂoating polar ice shelves.

shaft to ﬁnd its way blocked by a stone.
1 The robot drilled a hole through the stone 
and then fed in a small ﬁber-optic camera to 
view inside the chamber.
Mobile robot swarm
In the future, swarms of small, simple 
land robots may be used to search an 
area quickly but effectively for a missing 
person or object. Robots like this could 
be equipped with tracks or with jointed 
legs for climbing over rough terrain.

Advance 
of the 
robot
It all started with a squat box with an 
extended, jointed arm that handled red-hot 
metal castings in a car factory. Deployed  
in 1961, the Unimate was the world’s first 
industrial robot, capable of learning 200 
commands. Before then, gifted mechanical 
engineers had assembled machines that 
performed automated tasks… but nothing  
that matched the versatility of a true robot. 
Robotics is still in its infancy,  
but here are some of the 
milestones that have 
made it such an exciting 
field of research. 
Did you  
know? 
In 2003, an Odyssey Marine

“Robot builders 
today have more 
technology available 
to them than has 
ever been used.”
Joe Engelberger, 2003, in an interview 
with Bloomberg Businessweek
Inspired by the sci-ﬁ I, Robot stories 
of Isaac Asimov, Engelberger 
teamed up with engineer George 
Devol to form the world’s ﬁrst 
robotics company, Unimation, in 
1956. Their robots inspired 
companies in Japan, Korea, and 
northern Europe. In the mid-1980s, 
Engelberger moved into service 
robots, producing a series  
of HelpMate robots for hospitals. 
Now in his eighties, Engelberger 
still lectures and writes on robotics.

What next?
The worlds of computing, gadgets, gaming, 
and the Internet are constantly evolving. 
Some developments, such as personal 
robots or video phones, have been a long 
time coming. Others, such as the booming 
World Wide Web, were more sudden and 
took people by surprise. Predictions are 
always risky, but some key players have 
been conﬁdent enough to suggest what 
might be in store in both the near and  
more distant future.
Future promise
Scientists, businesspeople, and writers of the 
past promised us a future world of personal jet 
packs, frequent space travel, and cities in the sky. 
Technology has not delivered on these things 
yet. What people underestimated, however, was 
the rise of computing and the Internet.
“There is no reason 
anyone would 
want a computer 
in their home.”
Ken Olsen, cofounder and CEO of 
Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC), 1977
“In 30 years, chores 
around the house will  
be a thing of the past.  
The robots will have 
evolved from automatic 
appliances to home 
automations systems.”
Helen Greiner, cofounder of iRobot and 
The Droid Works robotics companies, 2009
Nanotechnology
Robots and machines built at “nano” 
scale are measured in nanometers, 
or millionths of millimeters. If 
nanotechnology becomes cheap  
and abundant enough, its impact 
could be enormous. Thousands of 
microscopic nanorobots could be 
sent to work inside machines and 
human bodies to repair any damage, 
while entire computer systems could 
be built on a pinhead.
The pace  
of evolution
The speed of change is accelerating. 
It took thousands of years of human 
development before the invention  
of printing made it possible to  
spread knowledge widely, but less 
than 50 years to go from the ﬁrst 
computers to the World Wide Web. 
Today, with a worldwide Internet-
linked audience eager to adopt and 
adapt to new technologies, it is likely 
that change will happen even faster. 
Thought control
One day you may be able to control 
gadgets and programs using only 
your brain and thought patterns. The 
ﬁeld is in its infancy, but research is 
ongoing at many universities and at 
military and medical organizations. 
Several have already built headsets 
that measure brain activity and 
convert it into commands for 
appliances and games.
“They say a year in the 
Internet business is like a 
dog year… equivalent to 
seven years in a regular 
person’s life. In other 
words, it’s evolving faster 
and faster.”
Vinton Cerf, Internet pioneer and, 
since 2005, a vice president of Google

“The future is really 
terriﬁc and software is  
a big part of it... I am  
very optimistic we are 
really at a tipping point  
of some great stuff.”
Nolan Bushnell, Atari cofounder, 2010
Smartware
Software is only going to get smarter 
and more personal, able to tailor itself 
to people’s individual requirements 
and freeing them from a range of 
mundane tasks. Homes and domestic 
appliances are likely to be controllable 
over the Internet. Power supply, too, is 
going wireless. This demonstrator is 
showing off a “smart” kitchen counter. 
Just place special pans or toasters over 
a tiny “hotspot” and it is activated.
Face-to-face phone calls
Video calls were often predicted or 
promised in the past but always led  
to disappointment. They are ﬁnally  
a reality. Apple’s FaceTime is just the 
start. New-generation smartphones 
and tablets use cameras to stream live 
images over an Internet connection to 
enable face-to-face conversations. As 
the price of making such calls drops, 
new social networking sites based  
on real-time video links may boom.
3-D printers
Printers that can output 3-D 
objects are already here. They take 
thin, cross-section “slices” of a 3-D 
computer ﬁle and then print the 
slices. An additive material, such 
as melted nylon powder, builds up 
the 3-D object, layer upon layer. In 
the future, this amazing technology 
might make it possible to generate 
processors, entire circuit boards, 
and spare parts at home. 
The future of gaming
Gaming is likely to become even  
more diverse, with motion-sensing 
activities for casual gamers and 
increasingly immersive game worlds 
for dedicated gamers. Nonplayer 
characters equipped with AI will help 
populate virtual worlds and offer 
richer gaming experiences. Back in 
the real world, gaming competitions 
on TV may make celebrities of the 
world’s leading players. 
Always-on 
networking
The future of Internet connectivity 
is all about more—more speed, 
power, and bandwidth, more 
availability, and more apps taking 
advantage of always-on Internet 
access. Increasing numbers of 
people will get Internet access. 
And as more become reliant on  
the Internet for work, education, 
information, and play, the pressures 
on its routers, servers, cables, and 
management will grow.
