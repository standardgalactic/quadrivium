Effective Editing: 
How to Take Your Writing 
to the Next Level
Successful writers understand that writing isn’t actually the difficult part of 
what they do; editing their own work is. Best-selling science fiction novelist 
Michael Crichton, author of the Jurassic Park series, summed it up when he 
said, “Books aren’t written—they’re rewritten.” Creating masterful narrative 
writing, complete with strong characters and great pacing, is the result of 
effective editing—and learning how to edit your own work is the best way to 
achieve this.
Self-editing is not easy, but with this course, you’ll develop a system of tools 
and techniques that will help you craft stories readers can’t put down while 
also elevating and polishing your prose. Across 13 lessons, you and your 
red pen will master the stages of the developmental editing and line editing 
processes. You’ll learn how to move from the big picture to the little picture 
with your edits. And you’ll build a custom toolbox for evaluating your own 
work with an editor’s eye. 
This course is targeted to fiction writers, but if you’re telling a true story about 
real people and events using the stylistic elements of fiction, such as scenes 
and dialogue, you’re also in the right place. With this course, you’ll discover 
how effective editing will take your stories from good to unforgettable.

Understanding 
the Four Levels 
of Editing
Imagine you’ve just completed a novel. It feels great to be done with your 
rough draft, and you’re so excited about it that you want to dive right in and 
start editing and rewriting. You start editing one chapter at a time, focusing 
on fixing typos and making sure your sentences flow nicely. After a week of 
this finely tuned editing, you decide to reread the entire book to see how it all 
fits together. And that’s when the trouble starts.
You realize that the chapters you spent so many hours painstakingly editing 
need to be completely reworked or even cut entirely. Maybe they’re slowing 
down the pacing, or the character or plot development isn’t where it needs to 
be. In short, the problems are much larger than fixing typos. All the hours 
you spent making detailed edits and rereading the same sentence over and 
over again were for nothing. It’s one of the worst realizations for writers, 
and some end up feeling so defeated by it that they give up and put their 
manuscript in a drawer, where it sits for years.

Lesson 1 | Understanding the Four Levels of Editing
Without having a clear understanding of what the entire editorial process 
should look like, editing your own writing can quickly become a drain on 
your time and energy. The good news is that you can avoid these kinds 
of headaches—and heartaches—and turn your self-editing process into a 
well-oiled machine by understanding one of the key secrets of the publishing 
industry: the four levels of editing. 
The order of operations in editing is 
critical. Always move from the big picture 
to the little picture with your edits. 

Lesson 1 | Understanding the Four Levels of Editing

Developmental Editing
You can picture the levels of editing as a large triangle divided into four levels. 
The foundation of the triangle is developmental editing. This level examines 
the biggest picture possible and analyzes how well your work is functioning as 
a whole. For narrative writing, there are three pillars of developmental editing: 
structure and plot, character development, and pacing.
Characters are the number-one priority in narrative writing—and not just 
for fiction. If you’re writing a memoir or autobiography, you and the other 
people in the manuscript are handled like characters as well. No matter the 
genre, you can have an excellent, well-crafted, and tight plotline, but if your 
characters aren’t compelling and believable, no one will read the book. You’ll 
approach character development by learning how to spot common errors and 
tweak your characters to help them be even stronger.
After character, developmental editing looks at the structure and plot of your 
narrative. Structure is the backbone of your entire work, and it’s based on 
turning points that need to happen at specific moments in the story. Editing 
your own work for structure means checking that all your scenes are in the 
most effective order and every story event happens when it should. You’ll want 
to be sure your work uses its structure to its maximum potential, heightening 
tension and compelling your readers to keep turning the page.
The word plot can be anxiety-inducing for many writers, but at its core, plot is 
simply what happens to your characters and how they react. It relies on your 
characters having strong motivations, making decisions, and taking action. 
Editing for plot revolves around ensuring that the plot points, or beats, push 
the protagonist to transform. As you revise your plot, you’ll also want to make 
sure it includes enough twists and turns to make things interesting for readers.

Lesson 1 | Understanding the Four Levels of Editing
The third pillar of developmental editing is pacing. This is where you cut 
sections, and even entire chapters, that are slowing things down. Alternatively, 
you might find that sections of your work move too quickly and tell too 
much. Like the other aspects of developmental editing, editing for pacing 
relies on you being able to put yourself in your ideal reader’s shoes to see 
where they might start to get bored, anxious to skip ahead, or confused. 
Line Editing
The next level on the triangle is line editing, which focuses on the paragraph 
and sentence level of your work. Line editing looks for clarity and flow 
in your writing, and its main goal is to make sure your prose is clear and 
engaging. It focuses on transitions, run-on sentences and paragraphs, syntax 
(or how sentences are structured), rhythm, tense, and removing clichés. 
A line edit also addresses any confusing action or logical flaws, such as 
a character who enters the room—and then enters the room again two 
sentences later. It works on punching up the writing by using varied sentence 
and paragraph lengths, replacing passive voice with active voice, and omitting 
unnecessary or bland words, sentences, or paragraphs. It often involves 
making a lot of cuts and deleting large sections of prose.
Note that this level does not fix things like grammar, punctuation, or 
spelling—these corrections need to wait until the copyediting stage. The 
trickiest part of line editing is resisting the temptation to correct every typo or 
mechanical error you come across. Practice ignoring tiny mistakes in favor of 
the bigger picture. If you skip ahead and focus on the tiny details before doing 
a thorough line edit, you risk wasting time and effort on passages that may 
need to be cut entirely. 

Lesson 1 | Understanding the Four Levels of Editing

Copyediting
Copyediting is probably the type of editing you’re most familiar with. This 
level focuses on correcting grammar, usage, and spelling, but it also looks at 
things like hyphenation, capitalization, numbers, quotations, abbreviations, 
and acronyms. The majority of the red-pen notes your teacher put on your 
graded papers were copyedits. 
Consistency is the name of the game with copyediting. You should be 
consistent with how words are spelled, how words are hyphenated and 
capitalized, and how you use numbers. For example, do you write out 
all numbers up to 100 or just numbers up to 10? There’s also internal 
consistency, which makes sure that character and plot details remain the same 
throughout the text. If a character has red hair on page 10 and blonde hair on 
page 90, that’s a problem with internal consistency. 
There’s nothing wrong with leaving the style guides 
to the professionals. In fact, doing a true copyedit 
of your own work is difficult. Our brains simply 
aren’t wired to catch our own mistakes. Instead of 
reading and processing each word in a sentence, our 
brains combine the details to form what we would 
expect to see. This helps us comprehend material 
faster when we’re reading a textbook or studying 
for an exam, but it also means that when we try 
to copyedit our own work, our brains skip over the 
errors because we don’t expect them to be there.

Lesson 1 | Understanding the Four Levels of Editing
The biggest difference between line editing and copyediting is that copyediting 
involves an in-depth understanding of the mechanics of the English language 
and should always follow a style guide. Style guides are critical in copyediting 
because, unlike some other languages, English doesn’t have a standardized set 
of rules to follow. Since this course focuses on narrative writing, you’ll want 
to follow The Chicago Manual of Style, which is mainly used for fiction and 
nonfiction books, essays, and short stories. 
Fact-checking is the final part of copyediting, even for narrative writing. For 
a novel that’s set in a specific period of time, for instance, it’s crucial that 
everything in the story—slang words, fabrics or clothing, foods, products, 
and types of media—fits within that time period. For example, perhaps a 
musician character in 1910 says he’s going to a jam session. The problem is 
that term wasn’t coined until the 1920s. 
Proofreading
The final level of editing, proofreading, focuses on the finest details possible. 
This is a level you shouldn’t do yourself, as you absolutely need another set of 
eyes on your work at this stage to make sure you catch all the typos and other 
mistakes you don’t want in the final print version—as well as problems with 
layout or design. The proof is the polished work in its absolute, final form. 
Proofreading shouldn’t add anything new or change much; instead, it only 
looks for the tiny, leftover problems. 
Questions
1	 Before starting this course, what was your experience with self-editing? 
What do you find exciting about self-editing? What do you find 
intimidating?

2	 How many of the different types of edits were you familiar with before 
this lesson? (There are no wrong answers here.) After learning about the 
different types of edits, what did you find surprising?
3	 The golden rule of editing is to always move from big-picture editing to 
little-picture editing. Have you gotten mired down in trying to fix little 
details before looking at your manuscript as a whole? Take a minute and 
brainstorm some strategies for how to look at the big picture before diving 
into details.

Planning Your Edit
The self-editing process is different for everyone, but one of the problems 
many writers face is the trap of focusing on editing too soon. If you find 
yourself obsessing over pages and making them “perfect” before you’ve even 
written five chapters, you’ll run your creativity into the ground. Don’t stop 
yourself in that drafting process and go back to edit—let it truly be rough 
for now. 
This course assumes you already finished your rough draft, which means 
you’ve naturally made the switch from writing to editing. Now, you know 
when you should start editing, but what about where? Should you start editing 
at the beginning of your manuscript or wherever it needs the most work? 
This question has a bit of a trick answer. It helps to think of what to edit next 
rather than where to edit next, focusing on one task at a time to strengthen 
the book piece by piece. The crucial aspect of preparing to edit your own 
work is developing your editor’s eye. Some of the techniques in this lesson 
can be done at any stage in your writing journey, while others need to happen 
before or during your revisions.

Lesson 2 | Planning Your Edit

Let Your Work Rest
The first—and most important—technique for developing your editor’s eye 
is to let your work rest before starting revisions. If you’re still “in” the work 
and having trouble seeing it, you won’t be able to make the changes it needs. 
Set it aside for a while and don’t look at it or work on it. Put it into a digital or 
physical drawer and forget about it, ideally for at least a month or two.
During this time, don’t give in to any temptations to open the file or pull out 
the physical manuscript. If an idea for a way to fix a scene comes to you, write 
it in a separate notebook or file. The manuscript itself has to stay on lockdown 
during this time to give you a chance to gain some distance, which will be 
paramount to a successful self-editing process. 
Read Widely for Inspiration
The second technique is to read widely 
for inspiration. Reading outside your 
usual genre is a fun way to expand your 
thinking about what good writing is, 
and you’ll be surprised by what inspires 
you. When you read outside your normal 
genre, you may find it easier to distance 
yourself from the story and think like an 
editor. What’s working and what isn’t? 
What does the author do that you like, 
and what don’t you like? If you can spot 
these issues in an unfamiliar story, you’ll 
be more likely to notice them when you 
turn back to your own, familiar story. 
“Read, read, read. 
Read everything—
trash, classics, good 
and bad, and see 
how they do it. Just 
like a carpenter 
who works as an 
apprentice and 
studies the master.”
—William Faulkner

Lesson 2 | Planning Your Edit
Join a Critique Group
Another way to develop your editor’s eye is to join a critique group. Critique 
groups usually work best when they’re small—say, three to five writers. Some 
critique groups focus on one genre, and others feature a blend of genres and 
writing styles. Both have their pros and cons, but especially for first-time 
fiction writers, it’s beneficial to be in a critique group that mixes genres. 
This creates an unreserved environment from the beginning, since the 
authors won’t be as concerned about someone else taking their ideas, whether 
purposefully or accidentally. 
Putting all this aside, the two most important components of a solid critique 
group are personality and skill level. You have to genuinely like and respect 
your group members and make sure that one or two people aren’t dominating 
the conversation. It also helps to be at similar levels in your writing careers. 
You want to be able to help each other grow and improve without one or two 
people feeling pushed into teacher or mentor roles. 
Learn How to Give Feedback
Even if you don’t join a critique group, learning how to give other writers 
honest, constructive, and tactful feedback is a great way to begin to trust your 
inner editor. As you learn to look for specific things in someone else’s novel 
or essay, you’re training your editor’s eye at the same time. Similarly, learning 
how to express your thoughts and ideas about a piece of writing without 
sounding didactic or harsh is a skill that takes practice. 
Receiving and giving feedback can be challenging at first, and it helps to set 
some ground rules. First, only give the type of feedback the writer is asking 
for. This means that the opposite also applies: The writer being critiqued 

Lesson 2 | Planning Your Edit

needs to be specific about what they want. Instead of saying, “Let me know 
what you think of the chapter,” ask, “Is the protagonist’s reaction believable 
in this scene?” or “Does this section grab you and hold your attention?” If a 
writer gives you vague directions, ask them to share their top three concerns 
with the piece. 
The second rule is to always deliver feedback in a compliment sandwich. Start 
with something you like about the piece, move into a constructive comment, 
and end with another compliment. As you gain more experience giving others 
feedback, you’ll learn how to express things in a tactful, constructive way 
while still being honest and recognizing that all writers do things differently. 
Similarly, the more you ask for and receive feedback, the easier it will become 
to decide what to take on board and what to politely ignore. 
Gain Perspective
Even after you’ve let your work rest for a few weeks, you’ll likely start 
skimming over paragraphs, having trouble remembering where a scene or bit 
of dialogue is, and missing important details. This leads to the fifth technique 
for developing your editor’s eye, which is to find ways to gain perspective on 
your writing.
The most popular way to get a fresh perspective on a shorter piece of 
writing—or a chapter or single page—is to print it out. Making the switch 
from staring at a computer screen to looking at a physical piece of paper can 
make all kinds of things jump off the page. While this especially happens 
with smaller errors, like typos or spelling mistakes, it’s also true for larger 
editing tasks, such as figuring out why a scene isn’t working or why a section 
of dialogue is falling flat. 

13
Lesson 2 | Planning Your Edit
Another technique to gain perspective 
on your work is to read it aloud to 
someone. When we read aloud, we 
hear certain aspects of the story and 
the prose more clearly. And if you 
stumble over a word or sentence, 
it might be a sign that it needs a 
revision. You can also have someone 
read the manuscript aloud to you, or 
even have your computer read aloud 
to you. This doesn’t have the same 
nuance as a real person, of course, but 
it works well for a chapter or section 
that you need to finesse and aren’t 
sure how. 
Next, try changing the appearance of the words on the page. You can make 
the font bigger, choose a typeface that’s sans serif instead of serif, or even vary 
the page color. The idea here is to do everything you can to trick your brain 
into seeing the same words it’s read over and over again as new information on 
the screen. 
You can also try editing your work in a different physical location. If you 
start to differentiate your physical writing and editing spaces, you can train 
your brain to flip from writing to editing mode depending on where you are. 
And even if you don’t want to do this regularly, changing physical location 
even once can be a successful way to gain perspective on your writing and see 
things you’ve skimmed over many times. 
A fifth technique to gain perspective is to set time limits on editing. Instead 
of sitting down and getting lost in the editing process, set a timer for an hour 
and stop when that hour is up. This forces you to take breaks and edit faster 
and more intuitively. Breaks are when you’ll get your best thinking done, and 
training yourself to move quickly can help you become more efficient with 
your rounds of revision.
Try laying your printed 
pages down on the floor, 
tacking them up on the 
wall, or hanging them 
up on a clothesline. Be 
creative! Do whatever 
it takes to help your 
brain reset so you can 
bring your editor’s 
eye to your work.

Lesson 2 | Planning Your Edit
14
One final way to get instant perspective on your book is to email it someone 
you want to impress. It could be an agent, editor, or writer you admire. Draft 
the email, prep the work, and get ready to push “send.” What last-minute 
things suddenly come to mind to change? Even attaching the file to an email 
and thinking about this other person reading it can remind you of passages or 
sentences to fix. You’ll be shocked by what instantly pops into your mind to 
revise as you draft the email—and you don’t even have to send it.

Editing for Plot 
and Structure
Premise. Plot. Structure. You hear these terms all the time—often used 
interchangeably—but what exactly are they, and how are they different? 
If your story is about a girl who steals lockets, that’s the premise of the book. 
Maybe it’s the initial image or idea that sent you down the path to writing the 
story, but it isn’t the story itself. The plot is what happens in the story—the 
cause-and-effect events that allow your protagonist to struggle, grow, and 
change. And structure is how you organize your plot—the order in which you 
give information to the reader. 
You’re not alone if you feel a jolt of dread when you hear the word plot. But 
there’s an easier way to think about it: Everything revolves around what your 
protagonist wants. Most protagonists want something achievable. Captain 
Ahab wants revenge on Moby Dick. Katniss Everdeen wants to survive the 
Hunger Games. 
Many authors write their entire rough draft without knowing what their 
protagonist wants, but it’s the most critical element of the story. It not only 
drives the protagonist’s actions, but it’s also central to the entire emotional

journey of the book. It doesn’t matter how detailed and fancy the events in 
your book are—if you wrote it without knowing what your protagonist wants, 
you’re guaranteed to have plot and structure problems. Luckily, there are ways 
you can analyze your current plot and structure and fix what’s needed.
Story Beats
One way to analyze your plot is to look at it through the lens of your 
protagonist. This involves using the basic units of a plot, which are often 
called plot points or story beats. 
Beats are the events that move the character through the story. They must 
be driven by what the character wants, and they always need to show that 
one action leads to a consequence, which leads to another action. The 
character tries something, gets thwarted, tries the next logical thing, and gets 
thwarted again. 
Storytellers have come up with several sets of story beats that are flexible 
enough to accommodate different stories but specific enough to effectively 
push the protagonist to transform. The one you’re likely using is the 
conventional three-act structure, which has been around since humans 
used oral history to pass down stories, myths, and life lessons through the 
generations. In Act I of the three-act structure, the protagonist is pulled into 
conflict. In Act II, they’re further from their goal. Act III is the resolution.
This course uses the story beats from Save the Cat! Writes a Novel by Jessica 
Brody, which is based on the screenwriting series by Blake Snyder. Snyder 
analyzed hundreds of the best Hollywood movies and found that they were 
all structured around the same 15 story beats. Brody, a film-executive-turned-
struggling-novelist, realized Snyder’s beats could be found in all the best 
stories, across genres and across history—from Jane Eyre to The Shining.

17
Lesson 3 | Editing for Plot and Structure
Rather than thinking of this as a formula, consider this 15-beat structure as 
a type of universal code. Once you know and understand the code, you’ll 
be able to apply it to any type of story. And during the editing process, it’s a 
wonderful tool for auditing your draft to see what might be missing. 
Save the Cat! Beats
Save the Cat! follows a classic three-act 
structure that breaks Act I into five beats. 
First is the Opening Image, where you 
show the protagonist in their ordinary 
world. Think of it as a “before” picture. 
Near the beginning is also a quick, subtle 
moment called Theme Stated, which 
hints at the truth the character needs to 
discover.
Next is the Setup. This beat is made up 
of multiple scenes showing more of the 
protagonist’s ordinary world and their 
main problem at the moment. What does 
the character want, and what’s stopping 
them? Near the end of the setup is the 
Catalyst, an event that permanently 
alters the protagonist’s ordinary world.
The final part of Act I is the Debate. 
This is another multi-scene beat that 
shows the character in a tailspin as they 
resist change and decide what to do next. 
You can use the beat 
sheet at the end 
of this guidebook 
to map out your 
story, or you can 
use software like 
Plottr, which lets you 
plug in scenes and 
drag and drop them 
around as needed. 
Scrivener is another 
software tool you 
might find useful 
for this. Even if you 
don’t use Scrivener 
to write the book, 
you can use its 
digital index cards 
to reorder scenes 
and add new ones. 

Lesson 3 | Editing for Plot and Structure
18
Break into Act II launches the second act. Here, the character resolves the 
Debate with an action that they think will solve the problem posed by the 
Catalyst. 
Next, the B Story is another single-scene beat that introduces a character 
who the protagonist could never have met or noticed in the ordinary world of 
Act I. This character may be a friend, an enemy, a love interest, or something 
else. Whoever they are, their presence or actions push the protagonist toward 
the change they truly need to make. 
Next is the Fun and Games, a multi-scene beat that should comprise about 
30% of your book. In it, the protagonist goes on a roller-coaster ride of wins 
and losses. Because this section is so long, it must build toward an overall 
arc—either an upward arc toward what would seem to be a success or a 
downward arc toward what would seem to be a failure.
The Midpoint of the book is a single scene that resolves the Fun and Games 
arc with either a false victory or a false defeat. This scene raises the stakes as 
you head toward the climax. 
After the Midpoint, you reach Bad Guys Close In. This is the second-longest 
beat of the novel, and it should make up roughly 25% of your book. Multiple 
scenes show how rising stakes and more attacks from the antagonist lead to 
everything falling apart for the hero. 
This beat concludes with All Is Lost, a single-scene beat that should be the 
opposite of the Midpoint. It’s a second false victory or defeat where, even in 
victory, the protagonist is brought to their lowest point. It typically forces 
the character to realize the conflict between what they want and what they 
actually need. 
This leads to the Dark Night of the Soul, where the protagonist struggles 
toward an epiphany that reveals what they must do to meet their need. This is 
a multi-scene beat, and it’s the last part of Act II. 

19
Lesson 3 | Editing for Plot and Structure
Just like Break into Act II, Break into Act III propels readers forward into 
the next, and final, act. This is a single-scene beat showing the protagonist 
deciding on the right course of action to reach their new goal. 
The Finale comes next, and as the third-longest beat, it should take up 
roughly 20% of your book. This is a multi-scene beat where the protagonist 
takes that course of action and ultimately succeeds or fails in their quest. 
Last is the Final Image. This is a single scene showing the plot’s outcome. 
It should be the opposite of the Opening Image, showing how much the 
protagonist has transformed. 
Editing with a Beat Sheet
As you map out your current manuscript using the Save the Cat! beats, the 
first thing to look for is what’s missing. But rather than having a beat sheet 
with a bunch of holes in it signifying the missing beats, you’ll actually end up 
with a beat sheet that stops at the first missed beat. This is because beats have 
a cause-and-effect relationship.
When you fix a missing beat, you can move forward, mapping out your book 
until you come across another missing or incomplete beat. One by one, you 
can repair any plot holes and ensure that your plot is character-driven. Maybe 
you’ll find that you weren’t clear on what your protagonist wants from the 
first page of the book, in which case you’ll need to do a lot more work in 
developing the character to fix your plot. 
The Save the Cat! beats are especially great because they show the inherent 
link between character and plot. Not only does your character have to want 
something, but in their struggle to get it, they learn that what they want isn’t 
actually what they need. By using this framework, you’ll make it easier to see 
what’s missing and what you can change to drive the plot forward. 

Lesson 3 | Editing for Plot and Structure
20
And remember, you’re still very 
much in the stage of your self-
editing process where messy is not 
only expected—it’s a good thing. 
Don’t be afraid to dive in and tear 
things up. You’re working on the 
big picture, which often means 
stripping the work down to its 
bare bones and putting it back 
together. You’ll need to delete 
sections entirely, move things 
around, and rewrite. In fact, 
chapters become somewhat moot at this stage. Instead, think of everything as 
story beats. If it suits your working style, you can wait to put the book back 
into chapters until after the lesson on scenes.

Questions
1	 You discovered that the premise is the initial image or idea that sent you 
down the path to writing the story, but it isn’t the story itself. The plot is 
what happens in the story—the cause-and-effect events that allow your 
protagonist to struggle, grow, and change. With that in mind, what is your 
story’s premise? And what is your story’s plot?
2	 Your plot should revolve around what your character wants. What does 
your protagonist want? Is this reflected in your answers to the previous 
questions?
While you’re editing, save 
different versions of your 
manuscript in case you 
need something in them. 
That should free you 
up to experiment with 
your plot and have fun. 

21
Lesson 3 | Editing for Plot and Structure
3	 Describe your plot one more time. What happens in your story and in 
what order? When answering this question again, don’t use the word 
then. Instead, replace it with so, but, and therefore. Does your answer still 
make sense? Are there clear cause-and-effect results between the events of 
your story?
4	 Does your story fit a chronological structure or a nonchronological 
structure?
5	 Can you identify all 15 beats in other books or movies? Are you missing 
any beats within your own story?

Editing for 
Dynamic 
Characters
As you saw from the previous lesson on plot and structure, everything about 
narrative writing is centered on character. The good news is that as you 
analyzed your story’s beats, you already started doing the heavy lifting on 
character development.
Now, what work do you still need to do to ensure that your characters 
are dynamic and believable? Where are your weaknesses in character 
development, and how can you fix them? How positive are you that your draft 
shows a true transformation in your character? 
To answer those questions, it’s time to make sure your character passes the 
protagonist test. The test has four parts. If your protagonist passes all four, 
they’re in decent shape. If they don’t pass one or more, you’ll know what work 
you still need to do.

Lesson 4 | Editing for Dynamic Characters
The Protagonist Test 
Want, Need, Flaw: Does your character have a clearly defined want, need, 
and flaw? Are they interconnected? Do they push your character to internal 
transformation? Review your beat sheet and decide which scenes need revising 
to better include the want, need, and/or flaw of your character.
Active versus Reactive: After the Catalyst, the protagonist must be willing 
to fight, move, or lead to progress toward meaningful change. Does your 
character act or react after the Catalyst? Do other characters have to intervene 
to move the plot forward or resolve problems? Mark scenes on your beat sheet 
with an “A” where your character acts and with an “R” where your character 
reacts.
Independent Agent: The protagonist must overcome all the major plot 
obstacles themselves. Who is really making the decisions and acting within 
the story? Is it your protagonist or another character? Side characters are great 
for support but not when they take over the plot decisions. Review your beat 
sheet’s main scenes and put an “X” by any major scene where your protagonist 
takes the backseat. 
The Final Battle: For the protagonist to transform, they must at some point 
face the villain on their own, whether the villain is an actual person, a system, 
or a society. Review your final battle scene and make sure your protagonist is 
the star of the show.
The character transformation exercise at the 
end of this guidebook can help you fully map 
out your character’s want, need, and flaw.

Lesson 4 | Editing for Dynamic Characters
24
Adding Conflict
If your protagonist doesn’t pass the test, don’t be too hard on yourself. 
Learning how to reshape your protagonist during revisions is a crucial part of 
editing your own work. On the other hand, if you’re certain your protagonist 
passes the test but they still feel flat, shaky, or underdeveloped, the likely 
culprit is a lack of conflict.
There are two types of conflict. External conflict is everything that makes 
it more difficult for the character to reach their goal. Internal conflict, on 
the other hand, is the struggle between what the character wants, what they 
need, and the flaw they’ll have to examine in order to transform. The external 
conflict pushes the character until they’re finally forced to look inside and 
deal with their internal conflict.
Let’s say your protagonist’s internal conflict is that they’re scared of heights. 
Their external conflict is that they live in a city in the sky where people use jet 
packs to get around. You can add on more and more external conflict to force 
them to face their fear and change—maybe their young child needs to learn 
how to use a jet pack, for instance. Maybe a war threatens the city and they’ll 
soon have to evacuate. In both cases, the external conflict would force them 
to find alternatives to flying until they overcome that internal conflict and 
take to the sky. 
Both external and internal conflict are crucial to revealing the true nature 
of your protagonist and forcing them to grow and change. If your character 
passed the protagonist test but still feels underdeveloped, go back to the 
lesson on plot and make sure your story beats are introducing enough external 
conflict to push the protagonist to change. If you’d like to up the stakes 
even more, consider introducing additional internal conflict on top of the 
character’s want, need, and flaw to push your protagonist to transform.

25
Lesson 4 | Editing for Dynamic Characters
Characterization
If you want to challenge yourself to make your protagonist even more 
realistic, try using an unexpected action that reveals their innate humanness. 
This could be something they do distractedly in a moment of distress or a tic 
that they don’t even notice. 
You can also bring out the humanness of your character by making them 
have strong emotions. The easiest way to write a flat character is to not let 
that character feel strongly about anything. Envy, fear, lust, love, malice, even 
blind optimism—no matter what the emotion of choice is, your protagonist 
should be passionate and conflicted. And this doesn’t mean they have to show 
these emotions outwardly; they may seem calm on the surface, but readers see 
the internal tension build until the character explodes and acts out at a key 
moment.
Another small-picture revision for character development is to ensure your 
protagonist has a unique voice that’s consistent throughout the book. How 
does this person greet people when they first meet them? How do they 
respond to questions? Are they quick to offer an opinion, or are they reluctant 
to share their thoughts with others? Do they have a rich inner life but struggle 
to communicate with other people? This will inform their voice. 
Work through the character voice journal at the 
end of this guidebook. After you get to know your 
protagonist’s unique voice, do a focused revision 
just to fine-tune their interior monologue, dialogue, 
and any of their narration throughout the book.

Lesson 4 | Editing for Dynamic Characters
26
As you were writing your novel, or before you started writing, you may have 
thought or even written about your protagonist’s past and how it shaped them. 
This type of work goes a long way toward developing dynamic characters with 
unique voices. If your protagonist needs more development, backstory work is a 
great place to dive in at this point in the self-editing process. 
The key thing to keep in mind is this backstory work is largely done off-
screen. You want to avoid adding content to your story where you explicitly 
tell readers this information or explain why a character is who they are. The 
protagonist should show themselves gradually through what they say and do.
One final way to add depth to your protagonist at this stage is to use physical 
settings to give insights. Where your character spends their time says a lot about 
who they are. Try a round of revision that focuses on your story’s settings. Look 
for what each setting tells about your character, and see if there are changes you 
can make to show more about their want, flaw, and need.
Secondary Characters
Finally, consider your secondary characters. One of the most common 
mistakes writers make is having too many named characters. This happens 
the most in the fantasy, science fiction, and thriller genres, but any 
manuscript is susceptible to it. Readers assume that if a character has a name, 
they’ll show up again somewhere in the story. This means it’s your job to 
ensure that each named character serves a purpose.
The backstory questions at the end of this 
guidebook can help you transform a flat 
character into a three-dimensional person.

27
Lesson 4 | Editing for Dynamic Characters
It’s easy to lose track of how many characters you’ve introduced. One way to 
combat this is to keep a running list of all your named characters and where 
they first appear in your book. During your edit, you can analyze that list to 
see if a minor character needs a name or if you can refer to them generically, 
as the bartender or the girl.
The second mistake many writers make with secondary characters is not 
making sure they either help or hinder the protagonist. To be worth naming, 
they must do one of the two. Either way, if they don’t reveal something about 
your protagonist and advance the plot, you need to rethink their role in 
the story. 
Questions
1	 Your character needs to undergo internal transformation within the 
story. You learned in this lesson that there are three keys to unlocking 
transformation—want, need, and flaw. Does your character have a clear 
want, need, and flaw? Are they interconnected in believable ways?
2	 Does your character act or react? Are any of your side characters getting 
in the way of your protagonist acting? Or is your protagonist able to act 
independently?
3	 Even with the groundwork of want, need, and flaw established, your 
character may still feel underdeveloped. Both external and internal conflict 
are crucial to revealing the true nature of your protagonist and forcing 
them to grow and change. Does your character face both external and 
internal conflict?

Tackling Point 
of View
When a reader picks up your book, they look through your characters’ eyes. 
The point-of-view character shows the reader the world of the book, the 
people in it, and what’s happening. This is what makes point of view one of 
the most powerful tools in your writing toolbox.
The sheer creative power of this tool means it needs to be wielded 
thoughtfully. But things can—and do—go wrong. This lesson discusses the 
three most common mistakes: slipping from limited to omniscient, head-
hopping, and filtering.
If you wrote your book without knowing what 
point of view you were using, identify what sounds 
closest to what you did. This will help you figure 
out which mistakes to target as you edit. 
TABLE OF 
CONTENTS

29
Lesson 5 | Tackling Point of View
Types of Point of View
The three main types of point of view are first person (I or we), third person 
(he, she, they, or it), and second person (you). 
First person is the only point of view where readers are limited to seeing 
out of the narrator’s eyes. Readers can’t know, see, hear, or feel anything 
they don’t experience. This immediacy allows a high level of insight into 
the character’s thoughts and feelings. A first-person narrator can be the 
protagonist of the story or a secondary character who’s observing the events. 
Either way, readers have to rely on the first-person narrator’s worldview—
they don’t know what they don’t know, and their view may be intentionally 
or unintentionally skewed.
Third-person limited is the most common point of view used today. It follows 
the character’s perspective and is limited to what they know, understand, 
sense, and feel. You can have one or multiple characters written in the third-
person limited point of view, but either way, readers don’t know what other 
characters are actually thinking or feeling; they can only guess these things 
from their body language, how they act, what they say and how they say it, 
and sometimes what they don’t say. 
Third-person omniscient, on the other hand, uses a godlike narrator who 
knows everything happening within the world of the story, including 
what every character is feeling and thinking, and provides commentary 
on it. This point of view isn’t used as much in modern writing, as today’s 
readers generally prefer to draw their own conclusions about characters. The 
omniscient narrator also adds distance to the story, making it more difficult 
for readers to feel close to and invested in the characters.

Lesson 5 | Tackling Point of View
30
Finally, second-person point of view uses the pronoun you to directly 
address the reader. This is common in prescriptive nonfiction, which teaches 
something. In narrative writing, second-person point of view transforms 
the reader into a character. It’s rarely used in narrative writing because it 
triggers instant resistance in the reader. If the book says, “You’re riding a roller 
coaster,” you might think, “No, I’m not; I’m sitting on the couch.” 
Slipping
The most common mistake writers make with point of view is accidentally 
slipping from limited to omniscient. This applies only if you’re using third-
person limited in your manuscript, but as it’s the most common point of view, 
there’s a good chance you’ve made this mistake at least once. 
Imagine you’re watching a crime documentary that switches back and forth 
between the narrator and reenactments. At first, you’re in the moment. The 
murder victim hears a noise coming from the garage, and you see through 
her point of view as she dials 911 with shaking fingers. And then the 
documentary cuts to the narrator sitting in his chair and sipping scotch. He 
sums up the next few minutes and explains why the victim’s husband was out 
of town in the first place. 
This is scene versus narration—sometimes called scene versus summary. If 
you stay within scenes, you stick to a limited point of view. But when you cut 
to that narrator sitting in his chair, you slip into omniscient. The narrator 
knows all: everything that happened to this character in the past, everything 
they’re feeling right now, and even what’s going to happen next. If you’re 
writing third-person limited, you don’t want the narrator making appearances 
like this. Instead, you need to stick to writing scenes and stay with what your 
characters are experiencing. 

31
Lesson 5 | Tackling Point of View
If you’re wondering how you’ll possibly be able to include all the information 
readers need if you only write scenes, ask yourself if the information you want 
to include in the narration is 100% relevant to the story. Some people spend 
a lot of time researching the details of their story’s setting, their character’s 
job, or how certain objects in the story function. And this is important work. 
But you should only use 5% to 10% of your research in the actual book—just 
enough to show readers what they need to know. 
Next, ask yourself if this is the right time in the story to include this 
information. If your character’s thoughts go off on a tangent about their 
childhood while they’re parachuting out of a helicopter, it’s not the right place 
for that backstory. 
And finally, ask yourself how you can show this information rather than tell 
it. The technique of showing versus telling will be covered in a later lesson, 
but for now, think about this in terms of the character, setting, or situation 
showing this information rather than the narrator stepping in to tell it. 
Even if you’re writing in third-person omniscient, 
that doesn’t mean you can get away with dumping a 
bunch of information on readers. Yes, your narrator will 
come in from time to time and address your readers 
directly, but the best way to do this is to make sure 
you’ve developed your narrator in a way that makes 
them feel like a character. They should have a distinct 
voice so their intrusions are welcomed by the reader.

Lesson 5 | Tackling Point of View
32
Head-Hopping
The next mistake writers make with point of view is the dreaded head-
hopping. To understand head-hopping, think in terms of limited point of 
view, meaning you’re in the mind of the character. Then, mid-scene, mid-
paragraph, or even mid-sentence, you’re suddenly picked up and dropped into 
another character’s head. This isn’t fun for readers. It’s discombobulating, and 
it’s a good way to frustrate them. 
The main way to tell if you’re committing this faux pas is if your characters 
seem to read each other’s minds, like in this sentence: “When he’d completed 
the task, Frank knew that Nanette wanted to take action.” But how does 
Frank know this? Does Nanette say something or use body language to 
demonstrate it? 
Here’s a revision to avoid head-hopping: “When Frank had completed the 
task, Nanette gave him a hug. ‘Let’s get to it,’ she said.” Instead of Frank 
reading her mind, Nanette shows through actions and words that she’s ready 
for the next task.
If you notice you’re using a lot of point-of-view 
characters per chapter, now is the time to give each 
one a hard look. Do you really need all those points of 
view? Why is that character’s particular perspective 
critical to how you’re telling the story? Each point-
of-view character needs to be fully developed, 
just like the protagonist—complete with their own 
want, need, flaw, and transformation. Prioritize 
the ones you want to keep and drop the rest.

33
Lesson 5 | Tackling Point of View
If your book has multiple point-of-view characters, it’s critical to have only 
one viewpoint per scene. The clearer your point-of-view shifts are structured, 
the easier it will be for readers. You can use scene breaks to clue the reader 
in that a shift is coming. It’s also important to make the new point of view 
clear within the first or second sentence of a scene or chapter; you don’t want 
readers wondering whose point of view this is. 
Filtering
The third most common mistake writers make is filtering. This is when you 
use words that put a barrier between the point-of-view character and the 
reader, adding another layer of sensory distance. Instead of filter words, you 
should use concrete action to bring the reader closer. Think of filter words as 
red flags that alert you to areas of weak point of view. 
Here are the most common filter words and phrases. Remove as many of these 
as possible to strengthen your writing. 
	
 Saw
	
 Felt
	
 Knew
	
 Watched
	
 Noticed
	
 Looked
	
 Heard
	
 Could see
	
 Could hear
	
 Could feel
	
 Could smell
	
 The sound of
	
 The feel of
	
 The smell of
	
 Seemed
	
 Appeared
Focus on another revision pass that serves to remove as many filter words as 
possible. You can use your word processor’s search function to do this or refer 
to this list as you reread your work. 

Lesson 5 | Tackling Point of View
34
Questions
1	 After learning about the different points of view, can you identify which 
point of view your story is written in? Is this consistent throughout the 
story? (Don’t worry if the answer is “no”—the goal is to identify what 
needs targeting when you begin editing.)
2	 If you’re writing from the third-person limited point of view, can you 
identify instances of head-hopping within your writing? (Remember that 
if you have multiple point-of-view characters, it’s important to stick to just 
one perspective within a scene.)
3	 Readers want to know whose head they are in within the first few 
sentences of a chapter. Review your chapter beginnings, especially the first 
two sentences. Is the point of view clear and obvious?
4	 Since filter words distance the reader, the goal is to revise your sentence (or 
even scene) to be grounded within the action on the page. Find an example 
of filtering within your story and rewrite it at least three different ways 
without using filter words. Which one fits best?

Page-Turner 
Pacing: Scene 
versus Narration
Pacing straddles the line between the big picture and the little picture in self-
editing. If you’ve ever read a book and wished that something—anything—
would happen, you’ve encountered a big-picture issue with pacing. On the 
other hand, if you’ve ever flipped ahead a few pages in a book or skimmed 
a few paragraphs to get to the good parts, you’ve experienced little-picture 
pacing issues. This lesson examines the most common pacing problems and 
shows you how to step on the gas or put on the brakes by effectively applying 
narrative techniques.

CONTENTS

Lesson 6 | Page-Turner Pacing: Scene versus Narration
36
The Sagging Middle
As with everything in editing, let’s start with the big picture. The most 
common issue with big-picture pacing is something writers and editors dread: 
the sagging middle, or a book that slows down in the second act. Think 
back to when you were writing your rough draft. If you got about 20,000 
to 30,000 words in and didn’t know what to do next, you likely had, or still 
have, problems with your second act. 
Sagging middles are caused by weak structure. If your characters aren’t 
progressing on their story arcs by Act II, or if the stakes have deflated or the 
tension is lagging, it’s going to have a negative impact on your pacing.
To fix pacing issues at a large scale, your first priority will be to push your 
characters to transform. If you never mapped out your book using a beat 
sheet, go back to the lesson on plot and structure and do that now. Keep 
a close eye out for individual beats that are taking too long or single-scene 
beats that are actually multiple scenes in your current draft. If one of your 
beats is longer than recommended, it’s guaranteed to be negatively affecting 
your pacing.
Infodumping
After you’ve done the structural work needed to improve pacing at the big-
picture level, it’s time to move to the smaller picture and talk about the ratio 
of scene versus narration. Too much narration, or summary, is the most 
common pace killer.

37
Lesson 6 | Page-Turner Pacing: Scene versus Narration
Infodumping is when the narrator interrupts the story’s momentum to explain 
something. These paragraphs, pages, or even full chapters of summary jar 
readers out of the story to explain something that isn’t being shown. This 
usually happens when an author doesn’t believe the audience will understand 
what’s going on without an explanation. But readers want to fill in the gaps 
themselves and be immersed in the story rather than sit next to the narrator as 
they explain things. 
There are three main types of infodumping: backstory, worldbuilding, and 
research. Backstory infodumps are when the narrator butts in to tell readers 
why a character is who they are by giving their background or history. This 
type of writing isn’t engaging for a reader and slows the pacing by interrupting 
the moment. Weaving in the backstory instead of including it in chunks will 
help the pacing flow more naturally.
Worldbuilding infodumps can happen in any genre, but the more complex 
your world becomes, the higher the risk of infodumps. Let’s say your book 
takes place in a different universe. You’ve done a ton of work to develop the 
world, which has completely different physical and magical rules than Earth. 
It can be tempting to have the narrator explain these rules and how they 
apply, but this pushes a “pause” button on the forward action of your story.
Research infodumps are similar to worldbuilding infodumps. If you did a 
ton of research on something for your novel, whether it was on flying hot-
air balloons or the underground music scene in East Germany after World 
War II, you were likely tempted to include a lot of that information in your 
book. But you don’t want to get too granular with this information—it 
weighs down the pacing and frustrates readers.

Lesson 6 | Page-Turner Pacing: Scene versus Narration
38
Editing Infodumps
One stage of self-editing involves going through your draft to see where you’ve 
fallen into one or all of the infodump traps. If you find a section where you 
cut away to the narrator explaining why a character is who they are or what 
happened to them in the past, highlight these sections in yellow. Next, find 
any instances of the narrator popping in to explain something about the 
world. Highlight these in green. Finally, locate anywhere the narrator explains 
a technical detail or your research, and highlight these in blue. 
Next, go through the highlighted sections and cut away as much as you 
possibly can. But don’t just delete the text; instead, put the cut sections into a 
separate document. Go through these cut pieces one by one and ask yourself 
if they move the story forward, teach something critical about the character, 
or show something readers need to know to piece together the rules of this 
world. Any parts that don’t do at least one of these things will need to be cut 
permanently. 
With the remaining pieces, you can now weave in pertinent tidbits of 
backstory, worldbuilding, and research as you go along—but wait until 
they’re needed to advance the story or better understand the character. Only 
give this information on a need-to-know basis, and keep it as brief as possible. 
It’s OK if readers have questions about your character’s backstory or the 
world. In fact, this is one way to keep readers interested. 
As you’re editing, you can always 
store cut pieces in a new document 
for safekeeping—you may be able to 
reuse a sentence or two later on.

39
Lesson 6 | Page-Turner Pacing: Scene versus Narration
Narrative Bridges
Now, you won’t be able to use scenes all the time; books would be far too 
tedious if you gave a blow-by-blow account of everything that happens to your 
characters throughout the day. Narrative bridges connect scenes and move the 
story forward in time.
There are three types of narrative bridges: timeline, travel, and voiceover. A 
timeline bridge shows a jump ahead in time and often includes the word later. 
For example, you could say, “A few days later, Martha picked up the phone.” 
Timeline bridges are naturally brief, usually taking just a few words to show 
the passage of time. 
A travel bridge shows a character going to a new physical location. These 
almost always show a jump ahead in the timeline as well. Here’s an example: 
“He boarded the bus and sat down, his suitcase wedged between his knees. 
He’d be in Denver by nightfall.” It’s important to keep travel bridges as short 
as possible. Unless something pivotal happens to the character on that bus, 
get them from point A to point B as fast as possible so the story can move 
forward. 
Finally, a voiceover bridge is only used in true third-person omniscient, where 
you’ve developed a strong narrator who addresses the reader directly: “You’ll 
have to forgive me for butting in right in the middle of their conversation, 
but it just would be too depressing to relay their exact words. Instead, let me 
tell you what happened next.” A brief, funny aside from the narrator is more 
effective than long-winded narration. 
You don’t have to stop and focus on your narrative bridges now, but as you 
continue to revise your manuscript, keep an eye out for bridges that take too 
long. Make them as brief as possible. 

Lesson 6 | Page-Turner Pacing: Scene versus Narration
40
Slowing Down Your Pacing
Pacing at the little-picture level focuses on how you’re using narrative 
techniques to control the speed of your storytelling. One of the main 
narrative tools for slowing down pacing is description. If you need to include 
a momentary pause between action or dialogue scenes, you can insert 
description whenever the character is at rest or taking a break. Be careful not 
to plop down description in the middle of the action, however—this affects 
the pacing the same way as an infodump, and it will frustrate readers. 
Another way to slow down the pacing is to use character introspection. 
This can reveal motivations, show internal conflict, and develop reader 
empathy for your characters. Pay attention to where you have more than a 
few sentences of introspection, however; like description, longer sections of 
introspection should be reserved for scenes where your character is taking a 
break from the action. 
The final way to slow down pacing is to use long sentences and paragraphs. In 
action and dialogue scenes, rewrite sections to use short, snappy sentences and 
paragraphs to quicken the pacing. In moments of introspection or moments 
where you want to heighten the tension, use longer sentences and paragraphs 
to slow things down.
As you gain more experience with pacing, 
you’ll intuitively understand where to hit 
the gas and where to apply the brakes.

41
Lesson 6 | Page-Turner Pacing: Scene versus Narration
Speeding Up Your Pacing
It’s widely held that adding more action is a way to quicken the pace, and 
that’s usually true—but only when action is used in combination with 
downtime. Filling your book with action scene after action scene to move 
forward faster is a common mistake. Instead, good pacing is all about variety. 
If you do have a slow section of your novel with too much introspection 
or downtime, experiment with changing the scene to be action-focused to 
quicken the pace.
Another way to speed up your pacing is by adding well-crafted dialogue. 
If you don’t have much dialogue in your book, you may be running into 
problems with slow pacing. Do a separate pass of your manuscript to go 
through the sections of the book that don’t include any dialogue, and play 
around with adding fast-paced dialogue that uses short sentences and doesn’t 
have any description or introspection. This will speed up the pacing of those 
sections. 
You can also insert cliffhangers, or scenes that take a surprise turn, to pick 
up the pace. Cliffhangers can quicken the pacing by pulling readers forward. 
It’s best to use these subtly as a way to introduce a story question that keeps 
readers intrigued. 
Questions
1	 Have you ever read a book or watched a movie and experienced a moment 
when you wanted to fast-forward to the good parts? Thinking back to the 
common reasons for poor pacing, why do you think that part of the book 
or movie failed to capture your attention?
2	 Review your beat sheet. Can you identify any scenes that are primarily 
narration? How could you rewrite them to be action instead?

Lesson 6 | Page-Turner Pacing: Scene versus Narration
42
3	 The three types of infodumping—backstory, worldbuilding, and 
research—can happen in any writer’s work, regardless of genre. Which 
type of infodumping do you tend to use in your writing?
4	 Review your beat sheet and mark which scenes are action and which are 
breaks in between. Is there a balance between the two, or do you need to 
add more of one or the other?
5	 Pacing is a balancing act. You want to have the reader linger over 
important, climactic moments and speed through less important 
information to keep the story moving. Are there any scenes in your book 
that need more attention to create tension and energy? How about slower 
scenes that need to be condensed?

Building Stronger 
Scenes
Most people have an intuitive understanding of what a scene is, but if you 
had to define it in one sentence, what would you say? Writers and editors 
have debated what makes a scene for centuries. But most agree that scenes are 
self-contained moments happening in real time that move the story forward 
through action. 
The ability to write great scenes is arguably your most valuable skill as a 
writer. And since you’re now in the revision stage, this means that the ability 
to spot weak scenes and either remove or rewrite them is crucial to your 
book’s success. This step of the self-editing process has perhaps the most bang 
for your buck—it’s hard work, but if you invest in it, you’ll be rewarded with 
the ability to craft spectacular scenes throughout the rest of your writing 
career.

44
Marking Scenes
The next step in the editing process is to sit down with your manuscript and 
review it closely, marking where your scenes begin and end. Even if you’ve 
already included scene breaks as you were writing, look again. You’ll likely 
find subtle narrative bridges showing a break in time or physical location. 
After you do this, put the manuscript aside for at least a week. Resist every 
urge to look at the book or open any of the files associated with it. If you’re 
too close to the manuscript, it’s impossible to see it clearly and make the 
changes it needs. Write any ideas that come to you during this time in a 
separate notebook or file. 
At the end of your week away from the manuscript, sit down with a piece 
of paper and a pen. Don’t go back to the manuscript file or printout yet—
instead, make a list of your scenes from memory. It can be helpful to assign 
each scene a name, or you can just write down a snippet or a few words that 
will help you recognize it. Really push yourself to do this from memory, 
writing down the scenes that come to mind first rather than trying to go in 
the order they appear in the book. 
Pay attention to your emotional state throughout 
the entire self-editing process. If you’re energized 
by the work and able to make decisions quickly, that 
shows you’re ready to continue. If you’re feeling 
burnt-out, tired, and are moving slowly—or worse, 
you’re starting to hate your book—you need a break. 
Step away from the manuscript when you need to. 
You’ll find that when you come back refreshed, you’ll 
be able to make the tough choices more easily.

45
Lesson 7 | Building Stronger Scenes
Once you have your list, pull out three highlighters. Use one color to mark 
which scenes on the list you feel the most satisfied with. These are your “good 
for now” scenes. They don’t have to be perfect yet—and it’s important to steer 
clear of that word in general throughout this entire process. 
Next, go through the list again and use a second color to mark which scenes 
you feel anxious about. Maybe you got stuck writing them, or they’re missing 
one or more of the essential elements. These are the questionable scenes. 
They’re not necessarily bad, but they’ll need more work. 
Finally, go through your manuscript and look for the forgotten scenes—the 
ones you didn’t remember as you were making your list. Write these down on 
the same sheet of paper and use the third color highlighter to mark them. 
Cutting Scenes
Take out a pack of index cards and write one scene per card, using the scene’s 
name or tag words at the top so you can recognize it easily. Be sure you have 
plenty of space at the bottom of each card to take notes. Use your highlighters 
to retain the color coding so you can easily see which of the three categories 
the scene belongs to.
Once you have all your scenes on index cards, use the wall, the floor, or the 
surface of a large table to arrange them in their correct order. It’s also helpful 
to mark where the scenes are falling on your beat sheet at this stage. If you’re 
able to get your hands on some butcher paper, put that behind or underneath 
the cards and draw the beat sheet on it. You can also use a whiteboard or 
chalkboard, or even washable markers if you’re brave enough to draw on 
the wall.

Lesson 7 | Building Stronger Scenes
46
It’s now time to start making the tough choices, starting with your forgotten 
scenes. The scenes you forget are usually the bland, repetitive ones where not 
enough happens to make them memorable. You have two choices with these: 
kill them or rework them. Not all forgotten scenes automatically need to go, 
but any you choose to keep will have one strike against them. You may find 
that you can salvage parts of these scenes but need to cut the rest.
Next, do the same with your questionable scenes. Which ones aren’t worth 
dragging forward? Which ones have parts worth saving but need to be trimmed 
back substantially? If you decide to cut a forgotten or questionable scene in a 
single-scene beat, that scene needs to go on a rewrite list—you’ll have to replace 
it to maintain the right beat structure. After you add it to your rewrite list, pull 
that scene’s index card off the wall so you can see where the gap is. 
If you cut a forgotten scene from a multi-scene beat, you may not need 
to replace it unless a key part of your story was removed with it. In fact, 
pay special attention to forgotten scenes that appear in multi-scene beats: 
Removing these is one of the best ways to trim excess bulk and fix remaining 
pacing problems. 
Putting Your Scenes to the Test
After you’ve made these initial cuts and changes, it’s time to put your 
remaining scenes to the test by addressing three additional elements that every 
scene must have: conflict, change, and agency. 
Every scene needs internal or external conflict to move it forward. Go 
through each scene one by one, and at the bottom of each card, write down 
“conflict” and the main conflict that scene shows. Make sure you save some 
room at the bottom of each card for other notes. If a scene doesn’t have 
internal or external conflict, keep its card on the board for now, but know 
that you’ll need to rework it later. 

47
Lesson 7 | Building Stronger Scenes
Scenes must also show character transformation happening in real time, and 
each scene must include an emotional shift, however subtle. It could be the 
character moving from trust to distrust, anticipation to dread, or hate to 
admiration. This changing of the emotional landscape within each scene is 
what drives both the story and the character’s overarching transformation. 
On your index cards, write down the main emotional change that occurs in 
each scene. 
Lastly, look at each scene on your index-card board and ask yourself if the 
protagonist is being proactive. As discussed in the lesson on characters, your 
protagonist must have agency and be actively pursuing what they want. Write 
“proactive” on the scenes that show the protagonist making active choices. 
If you come across a scene where the protagonist is being passive, leave this 
section of the card blank.
After you’ve done this for all of your scenes, take a step back and look at 
your index cards as a whole. The weakest scenes will be missing at least one 
of these three elements. These are the scenes you’ll need to either kill or 
rewrite. Take the time needed to go through each scene and make these tough 
decisions now.

or naming emotions, check out The 
Emotion Thesaurus: A Writer’s Guide

Ackerman and Becca Puglisi.

48
Putting Your Book 
Back Together
Now, it’s time to start working through your rewrite list. Your index-card 
board likely has some gaps to fill, and you’ll need to focus on connecting 
those dots again. For most writers, this is a multiweek process, so don’t rush 
through it. Make sure each revised or new scene includes all of the essential 
elements of a scene. And feel free to refer back to the document where you put 
all your cut scenes. This is the time to use it as a story nursery, picking out the 
most robust flowers and planting them back into the manuscript where they’ll 
bloom the brightest.
When you’ve completed your rewrites and your beat sheet is once again 
complete, it’s time to reorganize your scenes into chapters. You may find that 
your chapters now start or end in different places—this is normal, and it’s a 
sign that you’re doing the work needed to tighten and strengthen your scenes. 
Try to aim for three to seven scenes per chapter. This is by no means a magic 
number, but it’s based on what works best for today’s readers, and it will help 
you vary your pacing in a natural way. You don’t want every chapter to only 
focus on one scene, as this drives the pacing into the ground and is predictable 
and flat for readers. 
Finally, take a close look at the first and final scenes of the book: your 
opening and closing images. If these two images aren’t polar opposites—that 
is, if they don’t show a stark difference in what your character is like, how 
they act, what they say, what role they’re in, or where they are—you may need 
to rethink these scenes to push them to where they need to be. 

49
Lesson 7 | Building Stronger Scenes
Questions
1	 Watch an episode of your favorite TV show or read a chapter of your 
favorite book. Can you identify when a new scene begins and when it ends?
2	 Think about your favorite stories. How is the beginning scene different 
from the ending scene? 
3	 Review the instructions given in the lesson and dive into your manuscript. 
After cuts and tweaks, do all your scenes have conflict? Do all your scenes 
have real-time transformation? Is your protagonist proactive? Are there any 
remaining long narrative bridges or infodumps?

Showing versus 
Telling: Beyond 
the Basics
Most writers have had the saying “show, don’t tell” drilled into their heads, 
and it’s one of the most common recommendations given to authors. But what 
does it really mean? What is showing, and what is telling? And why does it 
matter? 
This topic has been hinted at in previous lessons, but only at the big-picture 
level: examining why narrative writing favors scenes, which show, over large 
chunks of narration or infodumps, which tell. But as you move into line 
editing, the question becomes: Do you need to show 100% of the time, or is 
telling sometimes useful, too? This lesson examines how to use both showing 
and telling purposefully in your writing. 
TABLE OF 
CONTENTS

51
Lesson 8 | Showing versus Telling: Beyond the Basics
Showing and Telling
Seeing showing versus telling in actual writing is the best way to learn how 
to spot each. Consider these two passages, and try to identify which is telling 
and which is showing:
	
 “Walter was disappointed because he burned the turkey dinner.”
	
 “Suddenly, a wisp of smoke curled through the door to the kitchen, 
setting off the smoke alarm. Walter jumped up and raced to the 
oven, but it was too late. His perfectly stuffed turkey was ruined.”
In the first passage, readers feel distant to the action because it’s summed up 
and it doesn’t take them into the moment. This is telling. Compare this to 
the second passage, which takes readers into the moment as it unfolds, using 
action and reaction to bring the scene to life. This is showing. 
But you can’t show everything in narrative writing. If you painstakingly wrote 
out every tiny action and conversation in a character’s day, it would be mind-
numbingly boring, and no one would want to read it. Some purposeful telling 
is needed. Narrative bridges, for example, are a form of telling, but they’re a 
fundamental piece of this style of writing. 
The key thing to remember is that for narrative bridges to be successful, 
they need to be concise. Telling allows you to say in one sentence something 
that would take many paragraphs or pages of unimportant action to show. 
Remember the percentages you want to shoot for here: Your book should be 
roughly 90% scenes and 10% narrative bridges. 

Lesson 8 | Showing versus Telling: Beyond the Basics
52
Telling Words
You’ve already done a lot of work removing infodumps, cutting down 
narrative bridges to be concise, and strengthening your scenes. Next, let’s talk 
about ways to spot more subtle telling throughout your book. Experienced 
editors can see this within a few seconds by keeping an eye out for two things: 
filter words and telling words. 
Filter words were introduced in the lesson on point of view. They keep the 
reader at a distance by filtering the character’s experiences rather than putting 
the reader in their head. These are the most common filter words:
	
 Saw
	
 Felt
	
 Knew
	
 Watched
	
 Noticed
	
 Looked
	
 Heard
The second tool you can use to spot telling in your writing is searching for 
telling words. Here are some of the most common ones:
	
 Wondered
	
 Realized
	
 Decided
	
 Hoped
	
 Considered
	
 Because
	
 In order to
	
 Knew
	
 Believed
	
 Thought
	
 Prayed
	
 Assumed
Because is a classic telling word because it leads into more telling via 
explanation. For example, “Lily’s stomach growled because she was hungry.” 
If you remove “because” and the telling attached to it, you’re left with “Lily’s 
stomach growled.” That’s all readers need to know—the action of her stomach 
growling shows that Lily is hungry. 

53
Lesson 8 | Showing versus Telling: Beyond the Basics
The phrase “in order to” functions in the same way as because in that it 
precedes an explanation. Instead of writing “In order to climb the ladder, 
Trevor stepped onto the first rung,” you can show this by simply writing 
“Trevor stepped onto the first rung.” 
Naming an emotion can also be a clear sign of telling. These are the most 
common emotion-listing constructs:
	
 In [emotion] (e.g., in joy, in despair)
	
 With [feeling] (e.g., with anger, with sadness)
You don’t want to simply state the emotion the character is feeling. Instead of 
writing “In sadness, she walked down the road,” you can show the emotion 
through action or dialogue: “She wiped away a tear as she walked down the 
road.” Or, if the emotion is difficult to show in one sentence, work on weaving 
it into your character’s actions and dialogue over the course of an entire scene.
Unlike filter words, which almost always need to be removed, telling words 
can be used successfully—as long as they’re on purpose. You will have telling 
words in your narrative bridges, since those are tiny snippets of telling needed 
to propel the story forward. But if you have a lot of telling words throughout 
scenes that you thought were showing, it may be a sign that you need to revise 
those moments. You don’t need to get rid of every single telling word, but 
examining them and making sure they’re being used purposefully will push 
your writing to even higher levels.

Dialogue That 
Sparkles
Playwright John Howard Lawson wrote in Theory and Technique of 
Playwriting that dialogue should be “a compression and extension of action.” 
Dialogue is action, not conversation: It should drive the story forward or 
reveal character—or both.
This is one of the most powerful tools you have in your fight to show, not tell. 
A character’s dialogue can reveal their emotional or mental state through how 
fast they speak, the rhythm they use, and how coherent they are. It can give 
clues to their background through their dialect, slang, or use of idioms. It can 
show their educational level through their sentence structure and word choice. 
It can uncover their inner world through mistakes, accidental admissions, or 
Freudian slips. And it can establish their character flaw—their jealousy, spite, 
or lack of humility, for instance.

Lesson 9 | Dialogue That Sparkles
56
Some authors only include sketches of their dialogue and interior monologue 
in their rough draft and then flesh these out as they revise. Others agonize 
over these items in their draft only to discover that they still need work. Either 
way, your dialogue and interior monologue will likely need to be tweaked 
during your self-edit. This lesson explores the most common mistakes with 
these two elements of narrative writing. 
Overexplaining and Infodumps
Dialogue often falls into the same telling and narration traps discussed in the 
previous lessons. The two worst offenders when it comes to telling in dialogue 
are overexplaining and using dialogue as a way to sneak in infodumps.
Overexplaining dialogue is common in rough drafts, and if you still have 
some sections of telling left in your manuscript, this is likely where it’s 
hiding. Summarizing things for the reader assumes they won’t understand 
the subtext—or worse, that there isn’t any subtext. If your dialogue needs an 
explanation, it means it’s failing. 
Just like with overexplaining, dialogue is often the last holdout for any 
remaining infodumps in your manuscript. These are places where you’ve 
had the characters sneak backstory, worldbuilding, or research into what 
they say out loud. But readers can spot this immediately. For example, 
imagine that a character says, “As you know, Karen, my wife Rose and I 
have been married since we were 19. We were divorced once in our mid-20s, 
but then we fell in love again and got married for the second time.” This 
is obvious telling. This backstory needs to be woven into the fabric of the 
narrative instead. 

57
Lesson 9 | Dialogue That Sparkles
Similarly, another type of dialogue infodump is when the characters explain 
something they both already know or recap an event that happened offstage. 
If both characters already know something, it’s unrealistic for them to explain 
it to each other. And dialogue is not an excuse to have characters talk about 
offstage events. If the event is important to the characters’ development, show 
the actual scene. And if the book can do without it, skip the recap.
Conflict and Action
Another common error is creating dialogue that’s an exact copy of real speech. 
In real life, we talk in circles, and we spend 30 minutes catching up with 
someone and making small talk. This doesn’t work in dialogue because it isn’t 
action—small talk and friendly chats don’t propel the story forward, develop 
the characters, or push the protagonist toward change. This is because these 
types of real-life conversations are missing a crucial element that successful 
dialogue relies on: conflict. 
If there isn’t any conflict in the dialogue, it’s often a sign that there isn’t 
enough conflict in the scene. What’s the emotional shift in the scene? What’s 
the current obstacle the characters are facing—in other words, what’s stopping 
them from getting what they want right now? After you’ve made sure the 
scene itself has enough conflict, dialogue becomes a tool to show this at a 
deeper level, giving readers insight into how characters interact to get what 
they want, hide what they want, and overcome the obstacles facing them.
One of the most challenging aspects of revising your 
dialogue is making sure it fits the character’s voice. If 
you didn’t create character voice journals when you were 
working on your draft or back in the lesson on character 
development, now is the perfect time to do that. 

Lesson 9 | Dialogue That Sparkles
58
The main way to introduce conflict into dialogue is to identify either an 
opposing viewpoint or an opposing goal and either raise or lower the intensity 
of the conflict based on what’s at stake for the characters in this scene. An 
opposing viewpoint simply means the characters don’t see eye to eye on 
something. An opposing goal means they want different things right now. 
After you’ve established one or the other, you can show this intensity in the 
dialogue by making the characters refuse to have the conversation the other 
person wants to have, for example, or sprinkling in some action to show 
subtext without using words.
While dialogue shouldn’t mimic real-life speech, the actions that surround 
the dialogue—gestures, movements, and body language—need to be realistic. 
These tiny actions are sometimes the only clues to what people are thinking 
or feeling. We don’t go around shouting about our worries and insecurities. 
We also don’t stand completely still and lifeless when we’re talking to someone 
in real life. Where we focus our eyes, where we place our hands, whether we 
fidget—all these actions can be brushed into your dialogue to show what’s 
happening beneath the words. The trick is to not overdo it: Don’t allow these 
descriptions to interrupt the flow of the dialogue.
Dialogue Tags
Dialogue tags are words or phrases that let you know which character is 
speaking. It used to be perfectly acceptable to use fancier tags, like explained, 
inquired, demanded, countered, and offered. But by today’s standards, this 
variation in dialogue tags is distracting, which is why it’s best to keep it 
simple, using said and asked the vast majority of the time. If you’re worried 
about a long list of “he said, she said,” on the page, don’t be. These tags are 
invisible to modern readers.

59
Lesson 9 | Dialogue That Sparkles
Some editors may disagree, but tags that show the volume of someone’s 
voice—such as shouted, yelled, and whispered—are also OK, as long as 
they’re used sparingly. But don’t use laughed as a dialogue tag, as in “‘You’re 
hilarious,’ she laughed.” We don’t laugh words—we say something, laugh, 
and say something else. The same goes for sighing, chuckling, smiling, 
grinning, and breathing. Similarly, avoid the tag hissed unless the character is 
pronouncing something with S sounds, like scenario or strikes. 
A second common problem with dialogue tags is the use of adverbs. Some 
writers lean on these in tags to tell readers what the character is feeling, which 
is almost always a sign that the dialogue needs to be reworked. This is because 
adverbs tell; they don’t show. It’s the actions between their spoken words 
where characters really reveal their emotions.
Lastly, don’t try to get around dialogue tags by having characters address each 
other by name all the time. We don’t refer to other people by name unless 
we’re greeting them, trying to get their attention, scolding them, or professing 
our love for them. And even then, we don’t say their names that often. Keep 
the name-dropping to a minimum.
Using action also helps show who’s 
speaking, so you’re able to drop some dialogue 
tags entirely without confusing the reader.

Lesson 9 | Dialogue That Sparkles
60
Contractions
Another common problem with dialogue is not using contractions. For 
example: “I do not really want to go to the park right now, but thank you 
for asking. You are sweet. I am just not feeling well.” This is so stilted that it 
sounds robotic. 
Consider the same dialogue with contractions: “I don’t really want to go to 
the park right now, but thank you for asking. You’re sweet. I’m just not feeling 
well.” Contractions make the dialogue flow better, and more importantly, 
readers believe that a character might actually say this. It’s not overly formal 
and choppy, and the rhythm is more natural. 
Even if you’re writing a historical novel set in Britain in the 1800s, your 
characters don’t need to sound stiff. In fact, people in the past often didn’t 
speak more formally than we do; they just spoke differently. Good historical 
dialogue is all about using words and mannerisms that are appropriate for 
that time period and the character’s life circumstances. Researching primary 
documents like diaries and letters can go a long way here, but once you have 
some idea of what would be technically correct, you can take some artistic 
license to modernize it for today’s readers. 
Try reading your dialogue aloud to spot any 
leftover problems. You can even record 
yourself reading it and then play it back—
you’ll be surprised by what you notice.

61
Lesson 9 | Dialogue That Sparkles
Interior Monologue
When used well, interior monologue is a powerful tool that brings readers 
closer to your character and provides insight into their internal conflict and 
emotions. Like dialogue, interior monologue should show action, conflict, 
and an emotional shift. 
It’s tempting to use interior monologue often, since it’s a direct line to your 
character’s innermost feelings and thoughts. But this is a tool that needs to be 
wielded carefully and lightly. Having too much interior monologue can tell 
too much, meaning it can slow down the pacing and be boring or tedious. 
It’s especially important to avoid letting monologue overwhelm dialogue 
and action.
It is possible to not have enough interior monologue if you’re writing in first 
person or third-person limited. A main character without any thoughts on 
the page can end up flat and underdeveloped, since knowing what they’re 
thinking in moments of external conflict gives more insight into their internal 
conflict. But the opposite is almost always the case: Most rough drafts have 
too much monologue. 
If you think your draft is suffering from this, go through and highlight each 
instance of interior monologue. If you find yourself highlighting at least a few 
lines on every page—and especially if these interrupt action and dialogue—
you need to pull it back a bit.
Many writers also wonder how they should format interior monologue. 
Should it be in italics? Should it be its own paragraph? Should you use the tag 
thought, or should you try to blend it in more seamlessly? The only real rule 
here is to not use quotation marks with interior monologue. This content isn’t 
being said aloud, so it should never be in quotes. Otherwise, it’s up to you to 
decide what’s right for your book.

hearing? What makes them stand out to you?
2	 Find a scene of dialogue in your manuscript that you feel is struggling. 
What do the characters want in this scene? Is there conflict between them? 
Are they communicating that conflict up front or through subtext?
3	 Find two different scenes of dialogue in your manuscript. Are they 
low-stakes or high-stakes situations? Does the intensity of the dialogue 
reflect that?
4	 Pull several snippets of dialogue from different characters and read them 
aloud without dialogue tags. Can you differentiate who is speaking based 
on character voice?
5	 Do your characters come to a resolution to act or have an emotional 
change in interior monologue? Remember, all dialogue or monologue 
needs to move the action forward and/or reveal something about the 
character.

Sentences 
That Sizzle
Ernest Hemingway rewrote the final page of A Farewell to Arms 39 times 
before he was happy with it. When an interviewer asked what stumped him, 
Hemingway answered, “Getting the words right.”
You’ve officially arrived at the part of self-editing that everyone recognizes: 
line editing. This is where you’ll finesse your writing at the paragraph and 
sentence level, elevating your language by scrutinizing adverbs, adjectives, and 
verbs. It’s always easier to focus on one or two things at a time, so don’t try 
to pack everything into one round of revision. And remember that it’s always 
crucial to take breaks to achieve distance from your manuscript. 
Writing for Your Ideal Reader
As you begin to focus on the words you’re using, it’s vital to keep your ideal 
reader in mind. Who is the one person, imaginary or real, who’s the perfect 
audience for your book? What word choice will most benefit them? What do 
they expect when it comes to language? How can you push the boundaries 
and surprise them while still staying within the limits of what they’ll tolerate?

CONTENTS

Lesson 10 | Sentences That Sizzle
64
You are not your ideal reader, and neither is “everyone.” Everyone is most 
certainly not going to read your book. You need to get as specific as possible 
with your ideal reader now, since audience will inform every choice you make 
in line editing.
Age is a big factor with audience—the word choice for a middle-grade 
book will be much different than an adult book. Your ideal reader will also 
expect certain word choices depending on the setting and the characters’ 
backgrounds.
As you prepare to go through your manuscript in detail, imagine your ideal 
reader looking over your shoulder. Get comfortable with who they are as a 
person. You should be able to look through their eyes and spot jargon or slang 
that may go over their head or confuse them, for instance, or big words that 
you threw into the writing to boost your ego. 
Adverbs
The first way to elevate your writing is to remove adverbs ending in -ly, 
like suddenly, quickly, deliberately, and happily. It’s normal to rely on these 
modifiers too much in a rough draft. As you write, you often choose the 
easiest verb. Then, because the verb isn’t showing what it needs to yet, you 
tack an -ly adverb onto the sentence. 
Now that it’s time for line edits, you want to take out the adverb and choose 
an active verb that better shows the action and emotion you want to convey. 
Instead of “he ran quickly,” say “he sprinted” or “he dashed.” Instead of “he 
listened covertly,” say “he eavesdropped.” And instead of “he spoke softly,” say 
“he whispered.” 

65
Lesson 10 | Sentences That Sizzle
Adverbs are at their worst when they’re added to verbs that are already strong, 
like in this sentence: “She stormed loudly into the publisher’s office and 
glared furiously at him.” The verbs stormed and glared are doing the work 
needed to show these actions, so the adverbs loudly and furiously just add 
pointless weight. 
As with almost everything in the English language, however, there is an 
exception to the -ly adverb rule. These adverbs do have a place in one scenario: 
when they’re used to change the meaning of the word they modify. The 
adverb in the phrase “she laughed happily” doesn’t offer anything new because 
readers assume that when someone laughs, it means they’re happy. But what 
about “she laughed sadly”? This adverb could be OK because it changes the 
meaning of laughed and provides fresh insight.
Put each adverb to the test by asking two questions. Does it convey a vital 
piece of information better than a stronger verb could by itself? And does it 
change the meaning of the word it modifies? If you answer yes to at least one 
of these questions, the adverb may be able to stay. The vast majority of your 
adverbs should be removed at this stage if you want to elevate your language. 
On the other hand, bending over backward to avoid a word just because 
you were told to avoid it isn’t a good idea. If your rewritten version is more 
cumbersome than the first, stick with the original.
Adjectives
As you might have already guessed, most adjectives are also unnecessary, and 
the same rules apply. Common adjectives—like happy, sad, good, bad, big, and 
little—add little to your writing, especially if you’re using them often. 

Lesson 10 | Sentences That Sizzle
66
Adjectives are common in rough drafts because writers often start with simple 
nouns and tack on an adjective to fill them out. For example, you might 
start out with “hunting dog” instead of “hound,” or “fruit farm” instead of 
“orchard.” And like adverbs, the worst adjectives are redundant, like “ancient 
artifact,” “closed fist,” “unexpected surprise,” or “hopeful optimism.” Artifacts 
are ancient by nature, fists are always closed, surprises are never expected, and 
optimism is hopeful by definition. 
You’ll typically want to swap adjectives for specific nouns. But you may 
be able to retain adjectives that convey crucial information that a specific 
noun couldn’t by itself and change the meaning of the noun. Adverbs can 
get away with doing just one of these things, but that isn’t the case with 
adjectives. Every adjective must add crucial information, and it also needs to 
automatically change the meaning of the noun—otherwise, it’s redundant.
Character Descriptions
Adjectives are most commonly overused in character descriptions. Just like 
with all other rough writing, writers tend to rely on simple nouns and then 
add on adjectives to qualify them in.
Pay close attention to sentences 
overburdened with adjectives. Lists of 
modifiers slow down the pacing and make 
the prose clunky and hard to understand.

67
Lesson 10 | Sentences That Sizzle
Listing a character’s height, weight, and eye color enters into cliché territory. 
This type of description is so vague that it could be almost anyone in a crowd, 
and it doesn’t show what’s unique about this person. Also, how often do you 
notice someone’s eye color when you first meet them? We don’t experience 
people this way in real life, so it shouldn’t be a feature in your narrative 
writing either.
If you do want to include hints of a character’s physical appearance, use 
specific verbs instead of adjectives. Rather than writing that a character has 
gray hair and glasses, use stronger verbs to help the description come alive: 
“Wisps of gray hair floated atop his head, bobbing slightly as he removed his 
glasses.” Specific verbs automatically translate description into action and 
movement.
You can even take this one step further by introducing characters without 
including any of their physical attributes. If you do the work to show how 
the character moves through the world and interacts with others, you may 
not need a classic character description at all. Instead of introducing readers 
to “Christine, who had long brown hair and green eyes,” they want to meet 
“Christine, the only woman in the country to wrestle a grizzly bear and 
survive.” We’re drawn to what a person does, and how they interact with 
others, more than their physical attributes. 
You may think you’re doing your readers a favor by 
describing everything at a high level, but the signal 
you’re actually sending is that you don’t trust your reader 
to bring their own imagination to the table. Instead, 
use a light touch with both adjectives and adverbs, 
and let your readers fill out the world for themselves.

Lesson 10 | Sentences That Sizzle
68
Helping Verbs and 
Participial Phrases
During line editing, watch out for -ing words. The main troublemakers are 
past and present participles, or the verb forms that use -ing. These verb forms 
cause three potential problems in your manuscript: wordiness, tired phrasing 
that makes the action less direct and annoys readers, and problems with two 
actions happening at the same time.
Participle forms rely on helping verbs, such as am, are, is, was, were, be, being, 
been, has, have, or had. These constructions can always be strengthened. For 
example, compare “I was dancing onstage” to “I danced onstage.” Or “Gregor 
was walking to the park” versus “Gregor walked to the park.” The versions 
that use simple past forms are more direct and concise.
These verbs can make an action less direct by putting it into what’s called a 
participial phrase, like the first part of this sentence: “Taking off his coat, he 
turned to face her.” There’s nothing wrong with starting a sentence with a 
participial phrase, but it makes the action less direct than it would be if you 
wrote this instead: “He took off his coat and turned to face her.” Participial 
phrases are overused, and the more you use them, the more readers will 
notice. Try to vary your sentences instead.
Participle forms can also create concurrent actions that aren’t physically 
possible. For example, if you wrote “screaming, she took a deep breath,” there 
would be a problem—a person can’t scream and inhale at the same time. 
Time warps like this often find their way into rough drafts, and it’s those 
good old participles that create them. 
Remember to watch your -ing words when they’re paired with a helping verb, 
when they start a sentence with a participial phrase, and when they present 
two actions as happening at the same time. Fixing and strengthening these 
will elevate your writing in a big way.

Questions
1	 It’s tough to see a manuscript with fresh eyes. Evaluate your mindset 
while editing: Are you excited and brimming with ideas while revising? 
Or are you tired and discouraged? Don’t force yourself into burnout. It’s 
important to take frequent breaks to stay fresh.
2	 Know your audience: How would you define your ideal reader? What 
would they look for in a book?
3	 Instead of thinking about what your characters look like, ask yourself: 
What do they do? 
4	 Which set of words or phrases (adverbs, adjectives, participial phrases, 
tired phrasing, etc.) do you struggle with the most?
5	 What is your plan of attack for line edits? Sketch out a plan, remembering 
to keep passes focused on just one or two elements at a time.

Pruning Your Prose
The number-one rule of the final stage of line editing, pruning your prose, is 
to keep your writing simple. Some writers push back against this. For them, 
simple means boring. They want to add spice and pizzazz, and they think that 
using abstract words and complex sentences does this. 
But simplifying your writing is an art, and it’s essential if you want to 
communicate. It doesn’t mean toning down your style or message; it means 
improving your writing by cutting out everything unnecessary, confusing, 
or purely ego-driven. The more you can do this while retaining your unique 
voice, the less chance you’ll have of a reader losing interest.
Unnecessary Words
One way to address wordiness is by removing all unnecessary words from 
your manuscript. This may seem simplistic, but it’s important to start here as 
you begin this work.

Qualifiers
Next, you can reduce wordiness by keeping qualifiers to a minimum. 
Qualifiers are words that precede adjectives and adverbs, and they can lead to 
sloppy, wordy writing. 

Lesson 11 | Pruning Your Prose
72
Take the sentence “This sandwich is very good.” Very is the qualifier here; it 
modifies the adjective good. But “very good” isn’t specific. Instead, why not 
find the perfect word and be as concise as possible? A potential revision would 
be “This sandwich is excellent” or “This sandwich is superb.” 
Here are some common qualifiers to watch for in your draft:
	
 Very
	
 Somewhat
	
 More
	
 Less
	
 Most
	
 Least
	
 Too
	
 Almost
	
 Fairly
	
 Really 
Redundancy
The third way to overcome wordiness is eliminating redundant words, 
phrases, and passages. Redundancy frustrates readers because you’re saying 
the same thing over and over again.
As you prune your manuscript at this stage, you may start to notice redundant 
sentence structures you rely on too much. For example, you may notice that 
you tend to start new paragraphs with a proper noun and a verb: The first 
paragraph on a page starts with “Emily walked down the street,” the third 
starts with “Henry stared at the sizzling pot pie on his plate,” and the fourth 
starts with “Emily sat on the sofa.” This is a redundancy of sentence structure, 
and you’ll want to work on varying your paragraph openings.
Redundancy can also come in the form of using two or more words when only 
one is necessary, such as “collaborated together” instead of “collaborated,” 
“past history” instead of “history,” and “the reason why” instead of “the 
reason.” As you revise to keep it simple, train your eye to spot all the places 
where you used a redundant phrase where one word will do. 

73
Lesson 11 | Pruning Your Prose
Keeping Your Writing Real 
Writers sometimes rely on complex words to the point of abstraction. But 
the strongest writers use simple words and sentence structures to convey 
powerful messages and imagery. It takes courage to prune your writing to its 
bare branches, but this is where you’ll discover that your words have the most 
potency.
Using simple language forces you to focus on the writing’s emotional, 
psychological, symbolic, or universal truth. You can think of this as keeping 
your writing real—watching for anything that feels pretentious, artificial, 
or uninspired. The more you prune away, the more you can strengthen what 
remains. 
You should strive for truth in at least one of the four senses in every sentence 
on the page. But keep in mind that truth in writing isn’t easy to define; it’s 
an abstract concept that’s more intuitive than scientific. The best way to spot 
places where truth is obscured is 
to note any lines or passages that 
feel off to you: Something doesn’t 
resonate, an image doesn’t come 
through like you intended, or a 
character’s dialogue doesn’t quite 
sound like them. 
Clichés
A cliché is an overused phrase that shows a lack of original thought. Instead 
of bringing a unique worldview or image to the page, you borrow a phrase 
people hear all the time.
“Use the smallest 
word that does 
the job.”
—E. B. White

Lesson 11 | Pruning Your Prose
74
Common clichés include: 
	
 Head over heels
	
 The calm before the storm
	
 Play your cards right
	
 Read between the lines
	
 My blood ran cold
	
 All in due time 
	
 On thin ice 
	
 He stopped dead
	
 Gut-wrenching
	
 Avoid like the plague 
	
 A breath of fresh air
Clichés are lazy, and they rob you of your originality. Unless one of your 
characters has the annoying trait of constantly speaking in clichés—which is 
the one time you might be able to get away with it—these tired expressions 
need to be removed. 
Eliminating a cliché doesn’t mean you have to try to make every image 
or phrase unique. In fact, the opposite is almost always true. Favor simple 
language over the complex. When you do want to highlight an important 
truth or image, work on using simple words and sentence structure to show it 
in a new way.
If you’re having trouble finding clichés in your writing, 
ask yourself this question: Can your readers guess 
how the phrase ends? For example, “As white as 
[blank],” “Think outside the [blank],” and “When it’s 
all said and [blank].” If it’s a common expression and 
readers know how it will end, it’s likely a cliché.

75
Lesson 11 | Pruning Your Prose
Exclamation Points and Italics
Two smaller items to pay attention to as you pare down your prose are 
exclamation points and italics used for emphasis. These are the two elements 
that scream “amateur” to anyone in the publishing industry, so they need to 
be used carefully. 
Exclamation points are, in a way, a form of telling. If you rely on them to tell 
the reader that a character is angry, upset, or excited, you’re not showing this 
through their actions and dialogue. The goal is to show these emotions so well 
that you barely need to use any exclamation points. At some point in your 
final line edits, use your word processor’s search function to find exclamation 
points and remove them. 
Similarly, proceed with extreme caution when it comes to using italics for 
emphasis. In the book Self-Editing for Fiction Writers, Renni Browne and Dave 
King write that “frequent italics are the equivalent of an elbow in the ribs and 
a frantic, ‘Did you get it?’ ‘Did you get it?’” These italics also fall into telling 
instead of showing.
Other than stylistic items that need 
to be in italics, such as the title of a 
book or movie, you should aim to only 
use italics for interior monologue—if 
you’ve made the conscious decision 
to format it that way. Even if your 
character speaks a different language, 
you can skip the italics on those 
words. Italics increase distance and 
label the language as “other.” Instead, 
weave it in naturally and explain it 
using context. 
When in doubt, skip the 
italics. Your copyeditor 
will know where to add 
them back in if they’re 
required by your style 
guide. Otherwise, 
push yourself to 
show rather than tell 
readers where the 
emphasis should be.

Lesson 11 | Pruning Your Prose
76
Rhythm
After you prune your prose as much as possible, you may find that your 
sentence lengths and structures are too similar, leading to problems with 
rhythm. Here’s an example: “She went to the store. She bought eggs and milk. 
She walked to the car. She drove home.”
Rhythm is created by punctuation, sentence structure, and sentence length. 
Good rhythm is varied rhythm, but at this point in the self-editing process, 
even the best writers can have sentence structures and lengths that start 
to feel too formulaic. The best way to spot these problems is to read your 
work aloud. 
There are many ways to improve rhythm. You can add punctuation to 
connect sentences or break them up differently; you can lengthen or shorten 
your sentences using word choice; or you can remove sentences entirely. 
Repetition
Repetition is different from redundancy in that it’s used purposefully to lend 
power and weight to sentences or words you want to emphasize. It can be 
used to show strong emotion; drive a point home; imitate a sound or rhythm, 
like the ocean or the pattering of rain; make a phrase more memorable; give 
structure to a list; or clearly link two ideas. Repetition is also a great way to 
inject humor, especially when it’s pushed to maximum effect. 
You can also repeat your sentence structure across phrases or sentences to 
use a parallel structure that brings a satisfying rhythm and balance to your 
writing. Dickens did this in the opening paragraph of A Tale of Two Cities: “It 
was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it 
was the age of foolishness,” and so on.

77
Lesson 11 | Pruning Your Prose
In your last revisions, watch for places where you can add repetition and 
parallel structure into your manuscript in key moments you want to highlight. 
Reading
Orwell, “Politics and the English Language.”
Questions
1	 Clichés can result in wordiness. Are there any favorite clichés that you 
lean on in your writing? How could you express the same idea with a fresh 
perspective?
2	 There are three main culprits when it comes to wordiness: unnecessary 
words, qualifiers, and redundancy. Do you notice your writing relying on 
one of these more than the others?
3	 What is the strangest piece of description you’ve come across? Why is it 
effective?
4	 Read your work out loud. Do you notice a lack of rhythm or unhelpful 
repetition? (Remember, repetition can be good if it lends weight or power 
to what you want to emphasize.)

When to Ignore the 
Grammar Rules
You’re now officially in the copyediting phase of self-editing, which means 
you’re focusing on grammar and usage. Whether you understand how it 
works or learned it via osmosis, grammar is the foundation of both spoken 
and written language. Without it, we wouldn’t be able to communicate. 
It’s important to understand, however, that grammar and usage aren’t the 
same thing. Grammar is the set of rules a language must obey to construct 
words and sentences. All languages have grammar, and native speakers 
internalize these rules so they can communicate. Usage, on the other hand, 
is broader. It has to do with everything from word choice and punctuation 
to capitalization and spelling. This is where your style guide and dictionary 
come into play. 
Everyone needs outside eyes on their work, so trying to do everything yourself 
at this stage will result in a poor finished product. Instead, this lesson explains 
five grammar and usage myths you can safely ignore as you prepare to send 
your manuscript off to a professional. 
TABLE OF 
CONTENTS

79
Lesson 12 | When to Ignore the Grammar Rules
Passive Voice
One of the most misunderstood grammar and usage rules is to never use 
passive voice. First, it’s important to understand that passive voice is not a 
grammatical error; it’s a style of writing, just like active voice. 
The active voice takes the form of X does Y: “The man dropped the paper.” 
Passive voice, on the other hand, takes the form of Y is done by X—“The 
paper was dropped by the man”—or, simply, Y is done: “The paper was 
dropped.” 
Passive voice does make your writing weaker when used improperly, but it 
can serve a purpose. You may need the passive voice when you want to focus 
on the object being acted on, when the character either doesn’t want to say or 
doesn’t know who did it, or when it doesn’t matter who did it and you want to 
get to the next scene quickly.
The first two scenarios happen a lot in mysteries and thrillers. Let’s say the 
maid has been killed and the butler finds her body in the drawing room. 
If the detective wants to keep the focus on the maid and off the butler for 
some reason—maybe he suspects the butler but wants to gain his trust, for 
example—he may simply tell the lord and lady of the house that “the maid’s 
body was found in the drawing room.” Whatever his motive, he wants to keep 
the focus on the body, not the butler. 
Scenario three comes up when you need to provide a fast narrative bridge 
between scenes. Say you have a group of characters traveling together and 
you have to get them out of camp and into the next scene quickly. You might 
write, “An hour later, the horses were fed and watered, and the bags were 
packed.” This is passive voice, but since it doesn’t matter who does the action 
and you need to get to the next scene as fast as possible, it’s an acceptable 
usage. Just be careful to use the passive voice in this way only when you 
need to. 

Lesson 12 | When to Ignore the Grammar Rules
80
Sentence Fragments 
The next so-called rule is the idea that you should always write in complete 
sentences. By definition, a complete sentence must have, at minimum, a 
subject and a verb. In the sentence “She ran,” she is the subject and ran is 
the verb. 
An incomplete sentence, or sentence fragment, is missing one of these items. 
Here’s an example: “Because of the gecko.” This fragment has a noun but no 
verb. It leaves readers wondering, “What happened because of the gecko?” If 
this appeared in prose, it wouldn’t make sense. Instead, write something like: 
“Because of the gecko, the store had to close.” 
But the best narrative writing uses incomplete sentences all the time because 
it’s how people talk in real life. You want to infuse your writing with a 
realistic, unique voice. Let’s say someone in your story asked, “Why did the 
store close, Brian?” and Brian said, “Because of the gecko.” It’s incomplete, but 
it’s authentic. 
You can also use sentence fragments for emphasis. Take this example: “Jessie 
wanted that trophy, and she was going to get it. No matter what.” “No matter 
what” is a fragment, but it serves as a quick punch to up the drama here. 
Fragments can also be used to slow down a moment and build tension: “Lettie 
walked home. Alone. In the dark.” Fragments are a powerful tool to use in 
your narrative writing, so don’t shy away from them.

81
Lesson 12 | When to Ignore the Grammar Rules
Ending a Sentence 
with a Preposition 
English teachers still seem to tell their students to never end a sentence with 
a preposition. But following this “rule” at all costs can greatly affect the two 
most important elements of writing: clarity and effectiveness.
Grammarians and writers have debated the correctness of the terminal 
preposition since the 1700s. In the 1800s, some prescriptivists starting telling 
writers to avoid ending a sentence with a preposition. But by the 1900s, most 
language experts and usage guides had concluded there was nothing wrong 
with it, and for the past hundred years, they haven’t changed their views 
on this. 
Some people are determined to hang on to this rule no matter how many 
times they’re told that it isn’t one. If you have a sentence that ends in a 
preposition and there’s no easy way to shuffle words around, just leave it be. 
Split Infinitives
Next is another favorite rule of grammarians, although it’s finally starting to 
fall out of favor: Never split an infinitive.
A popular example of a split infinitive is the Star Trek catchphrase “to boldly 
go where no man has gone before.” The infinitive verb “to go” has been split 
by the adverb “boldly.” Writing this without splitting the infinitive would 
result in the sentence “To go boldly where no man has gone before.” It gets 
the same point across, but it doesn’t have the same pizzazz. 

Lesson 12 | When to Ignore the Grammar Rules
82
This so-called rule is similar to the one about prepositions in that there is no 
rule—and there never has been. Someone likely made up this piece of advice 
because in Latin, infinitives are single words that can’t be split. But the same 
idea doesn’t apply to English. Your primary goal is to convey a narrative to 
your audience, so use your best judgment and write your infinitives the way 
they sound best.
Starting a Sentence 
with a Conjunction
There’s a widespread belief that it’s an error to begin a sentence with 
a conjunction, such as and or but. Again, this rule has no historical or 
grammatical foundation. In fact, starting sentences with conjunctions has 
been common for centuries. Writing samples dating back to 9th-century 
Bible translations show this. The key here is to not overdo it. Make sure you’re 
varying your sentence structures to keep things interesting.

Questions
1	 Is grammar your friend or your foe? How did this lesson change (or 
reinforce) your opinion on these grammar “rules”?
2	 Find examples of passive voice in your manuscript—one that should be 
written in active voice, and one where passive voice is used correctly.
3	 Do you shy away from sentence fragments? Experiment with adding some 
to dialogue or interior monologue and read the result aloud. Do you notice 
that the fragments add authenticity or emphasis?

Beyond the 
Red Pen: What 
Comes Next
You’ve now reached the tinkering phase, where you reread pages and change 
a word or punctuation mark here and there. This is an important part of 
finessing your manuscript, but it’s also a dangerous place to be. Writers can 
get stuck in the tinkering phase for months, or even years. 
It might reassure you to know that good writers never feel 100% happy with 
their manuscripts: There will always be something to improve, fix, or tweak. 
The key with the tinkering phase is to set a time limit and stick to it—two 
weeks to a month at most. Once that time is up, save the manuscript file and 
tuck it away. Ending the self-editing process is an exercise in letting go and 
abandoning perfectionism.

Lesson 13 | Beyond the Red Pen: What Comes Next
Now that you’ve done everything you can to strengthen the book, what 
happens next depends on how you plan to publish it—or if you plan to 
publish at all. If you want to reach a larger audience and are planning to 
traditionally publish or self-publish your book, you’ll need to hire professional 
editors. This lesson walks you through that process.
Traditional Publishing
Many writers think they don’t need professional editing before they start 
submitting their manuscript to agents or publishers. They assume that once 
they land a publishing deal, the company will do any editing the book needs, 
so they should be able to submit their draft without a professional edit. 
There’s an obvious flaw with this logic, however, because unless you’re already 
represented by a publisher, what matters is getting your foot in the door. And 
that means first securing a contract with a literary agent. 
You’ll have only one shot to impress agents who are flooded with inquiries 
every day of the week. And literary agents are not editors or writing coaches, 
so if your book suffers from lingering developmental problems, has typos 
or spelling errors, or far exceeds the recommended word count for its 
genre, you’ve made it easy for agents to say no. It’s well worth the time 
and investment to get your manuscript in excellent shape before you start 
submitting.
If you have a healthy budget, put your manuscript through two rounds of 
developmental editing and two rounds of line editing. Ideally, both types of 
editing should be done by the same editor or by editors who work together 
regularly. This ensures that the process is as fluid as possible.

Lesson 13 | Beyond the Red Pen: What Comes Next
86
If you have a limited budget for editing, invest in at least one round of 
developmental editing and one round of line editing. This provides the most 
value for your money, since you’re still addressing any remaining problems at 
the big-picture level and you’re also making sure the manuscript is in great 
shape at the little-picture level before sending it out. 
Self-Publishing
If you’re self-publishing, you’ll be seeing your book through the publishing 
process from start to finish. That means you’ll have special considerations 
when it comes to making sure it’s as clean and polished as possible before it 
goes to print. 
Word count is an important consideration for self-publishing. Even though 
you don’t need to conform to the word-count norms for your genre, you’re 
also bankrolling the publishing process. As word count goes up, so do your 
costs for editing and formatting. This should be a huge motivator for you to 
transform your book into a lean, mean machine if you haven’t already.
For self-publishing authors with healthy budgets, it’s ideal to do two rounds 
of developmental editing, one combined line edit and copyedit, two rounds 
of formatting—for print and eBook editions—and at least two rounds of 
proofreading. You’ll also need cover design, a back cover blurb, and sales copy. 
If you’re working with a tight budget, you can do away with the second round 
of developmental editing, use a template to format the book yourself, and 
write the back cover blurb and any sales pages yourself. But your book cover 
is your most important sales tool, so it’s worth investing in one that will spark 
interest when potential readers are scrolling through hundreds of books and 
deciding which one to buy.

87
Lesson 13 | Beyond the Red Pen: What Comes Next
If you have no choice but to keep your editing costs as low as possible, you 
absolutely need to put the book through a combination line edit and copyedit 
as well as two rounds of proofreading. Be sure your proofreader is a different 
person than whoever did the combo line edit and copyedit. Even the best 
editors have blind spots and may miss things that the proofreader will see 
with fresh eyes. 
Beta Readers
One way to keep your editing costs down no matter how you plan to publish 
is to do a few rounds of beta reading before you hire an editor. You’ve likely 
already done what’s known as alpha reading: Alpha readers are family 
members and friends who give you feedback on your draft. 
Beta readers, on the other hand, are people who either don’t know you at all 
or don’t know you that well. They take a look at the polished manuscript and 
offer whatever feedback you ask for. Beta readers are avid fans of your genre 
who generally offer their critiques for free or in exchange for a beta read of 
their manuscript, if they’re writers themselves. 
Beta readers don’t replace a professional editor, but 
most editors are thrilled to hear that a manuscript 
has already been through beta reading. If you’ve 
already solved the basic, widespread problems, the 
editor can then focus on high-level issues and make 
the book as successful a product as possible.

Lesson 13 | Beyond the Red Pen: What Comes Next
88
There are many ways to find beta readers. If you already have an author 
website and an active email list, consider sending out an email to your 
followers to see if anyone would be interested in getting a sneak peek at your 
book in exchange for giving their feedback. Or you can join beta reader 
groups on social media or other online forums.
It’s important to think about what feedback you want before going into a round 
of beta reading, as many people who aren’t trained in editing will automatically 
zoom in on things that might not be helpful for you at this stage, such as 
pointing out typos when you really want big-picture feedback. Developing a 
brief list of questions for your beta readers can help avoid this problem. 
The best-case scenario with beta readers is that they all point out the same 
issues. If multiple readers say the same thing, it’s usually a clear sign that it 
needs to change. But keep in mind that beta readers will often contradict each 
other. One person will love a secondary character and want you to develop their 
story further, for instance, and another person will say you need to cut that 
character entirely. Try finding an odd number of beta readers—ideally between 
five and nine—so you can tally up the feedback and avoid having a stalemate. 
How to Find an Editor
Just like with most services you hire someone for, the best way to find a good 
editor is to ask around. Reach out to your fellow writers and see which editors 
they recommend. Most writers are happy to sing the praises of an editor who 
did great work for them. 
If you come up empty on personal referrals, you can search the member 
directory of the Editorial Freelancers Association, or EFA. The directory 
lets you filter results based on content type, skills, genre, and even location. 
You can also post a job to the EFA Job List, which goes out to the entire 
membership and allows interested editors to contact you.

89
Lesson 13 | Beyond the Red Pen: What Comes Next
The Professional Editors Network and ACES: The Society for Editing also 
provide member directories, although they aren’t as searchable. And if you’re 
outside the US, check to see if your country has its own editorial organization, 
like Editors Canada, the Chartered Institute of Editing and Proofreading 
in the UK, or the Institute of Professional Editors Limited in Australia and 
New Zealand.
Whether someone recommends an editor or you find one via a directory, do 
your research. Go to their website and read their services pages. Look through 
their testimonials to make sure they’ve had lots of happy clients. This is where 
you’ll start narrowing down your list based on which editors seem like they’ll 
be the best fit for you. 
Next, reach out to the top three editors you’re interested in working with. 
Some will have you upload your manuscript into the contact form itself. Don’t 
let this scare you; they have to take a look before they can give you any details 
on pricing, timeline, or the services they recommend. 
The best editors will generally want to speak with you over the phone, in 
person, or via video call before they send you their recommendations. This is 
to make sure they understand what you’ve already worked on, where you’re 
at now with the book, and what your publishing goals are. These editors also 
want to make sure you’re a good fit for them personality-wise, and vice versa. 
Hiring an Editor
After your call, the editor will send you a proposal detailing what they 
recommend, including the price, any payment plans and options, and their 
timeframe for completing the project. The majority of professional freelance 
editors will have you sign a contract or some sort of agreement outlining the 
project details and what’s expected from both parties. 

Lesson 13 | Beyond the Red Pen: What Comes Next
90
As with hiring any professional, there are a few red flags to watch out for. 
If the editor you approach seems disorganized, isn’t able to talk about their 
experience with books or your genre, or doesn’t ask to see your manuscript 
before sending over prices, be wary. There are a lot of inexperienced freelance 
editors out there, and there are many types of editing. This is why your best 
bet is to work with a well-rounded editor who’s familiar with the type of 
publishing you’re interested in. 
As you prepare to read through your editor’s feedback, brace yourself for an 
initial wave of defensiveness, or even anger. Keep reminding yourself that your 
editor is there to help. And you should find their comments and feedback 
helpful, even if they’re surprising or difficult to take in at first. Highly trained 
editors have years of experience in providing constructive feedback and 
wording things in a way that promotes collaboration.
For big-picture editing, take at least a week to let the editor’s feedback 
percolate before contacting them for your follow-up call. Let them know that 
you received the files, but don’t give in to an impulse to defend yourself point 
by point or go through their editorial letter and respond to everything you 
disagree with. Most of these impulses will quiet down after a few days, and 
you’ll start feeling more receptive to their suggestions. 
If you do disagree with a point your editor makes, let them know. No good 
editor wants to force you to write something you’re not passionate about or 
that you don’t agree with at a fundamental level. Their goal is to collaborate 
with you to make your book the best it can be, and that requires good 
communication and mutual respect. 
Edits aren’t personal, even though they can feel 
that way. Remember that your editor’s job is to 
find and propose solutions to any problems in the 
manuscript, and they want you to succeed.

Save the Cat! Beat Sheet
Beats are the driving moments throughout the arc of a book. The percentages 
in this beat sheet show where in the book that beat takes place, with 0% 
representing the beginning of the book and 100% representing the end. Beats 
that include multiple scenes are highlighted.
ACT I
Opening Image (0%–1%):
The first thing seen; think of it like a snapshot of the protagonist in their 
ordinary world. This will set the tone of the story and should be the opposite of 
the Final Image.
Setup (1%–10%):
The introduction of the world and characters as well as what’s wrong in that 
world and/or character’s life. What does the character want, and what’s stopping 
them? The Theme Stated, a quick paragraph or sentence hinting at the truth the 
character needs to discover, should happen early in the Setup.

93
Save the Cat! Beat Sheet
Catalyst (10%):
The trigger that starts the plot. This is an event that permanently alters the 
protagonist’s ordinary world.
Debate (10%–20%):
The protagonist resists change and ultimately decides whether or not to do 
whatever it is they need to do.
ACT II
Break into Act II (20%):
The protagonist has to choose to take action and move the story forward.


94
Save the Cat! Beat Sheet
B Story (22%):
Readers are introduced to a secondary character who either helps or hinders the 
protagonist. They should play a pivotal role in moving the protagonist forward 
in some way.
Fun and Games (20%–50%):
The protagonist goes on a roller-coaster ride of wins and losses. They try to get 
what they want, they fail, and then they pivot and try again.

Midpoint (50%):
The middle of the book is a single scene that resolves the Fun and Games arc 
with either a false victory or a false defeat. This scene raises the stakes as you 
head toward the climax.

95
Save the Cat! Beat Sheet
Bad Guys Close In (50%–75%):
Things start to fall apart for the protagonist.


All Is Lost (75%):
The opposite of the Midpoint, this is a second false victory or defeat where, even 
in victory, the protagonist is brought to their lowest point.

Dark Night of the Soul (75%–80%):
This is the deep soul-searching of the protagonist to find the solution to the 
problems facing them. The protagonist starts to realize what they actually need 
versus what they want.

96
Save the Cat! Beat Sheet
ACT III
Break into Act III (80%):
The protagonist decides on the right course of action to reach their new goal.

Finale (80%–99%):
The climax, where the protagonist takes that course of action and ultimately 
succeeds or fails in their quest.
Final Image (99%–100%):
This is a single scene showing the plot’s outcome. It should be the opposite of 
the Opening Image, showing how much the protagonist has transformed.

97
Character Transformation
Your protagonist must have a want. And it’s not enough for your character 
to want to be happy—they must want something specific, and they have to 
think it will solve their problem.
What is your character’s want?
	
	
	
	
	
Blake Snyder, creator of the Save the Cat! methodology, said that the 
protagonist’s flaw is like a shard of glass. It’s buried deep under the skin, 
which has grown up around it over time. Even if none of the other characters 
can see it—even if the protagonist has forgotten it—the shard of glass is 
always there, holding the protagonist back.
What is your character’s flaw?
	
	
	
	
	

98
Character Transformation
Through the events of the story, your protagonist must find out that what 
they want isn’t what they need. They’re finally forced to deal with their 
fundamental character flaw, which allows them to transform.
What is your character’s need? How is the character pushed to realize what 
they need?
	
	
	
	
	
Remember, a character’s flaw, want, and need are not chosen at random. 
They’re interconnected. If your protagonist’s flaw is arrogance, but they’re 
never forced to become humble to achieve what they want, then the character 
doesn’t grow and change. The plot becomes pointless, and the outcome is 
unsatisfying.

99
Character Voice Journal 
Your protagonist should have a unique voice that’s consistent throughout the 
book. If you’ve struggled to write dialogue and interior monologue for your 
protagonist, it may be because you haven’t developed their voice enough. 
What makes your character’s voice distinct? If you’re finding it hard to narrow 
down, start by answering the following questions.
How does this person greet people when they first meet them? 
	
	
How do they respond to questions? 
	
	
Are they quick to offer an opinion, or are they reluctant to share their 
thoughts with others? 
	
	

100
Character Voice Journal 
Do they have a rich inner life but struggle to communicate with other 
people?
	
	
What would the character write about?
	
	
What word choice and phrasing would they use? 
	
	
What topics would they choose or avoid? 
	
	
How would they write about the people in their lives?
	
	

101
Character Voice Journal 
Another way to work on your character’s voice is to work through voice 
prompts written from their point of view. Here are a few prompts to get you 
started.
In the Spotlight: Your character is being interviewed on a popular 
TV show or radio program. Brainstorm a list of interesting interview 
questions, and then answer them from your character’s point of view, 
as if they’re speaking. Pay close attention to the attitude, phrasing, 
subtext, and wording of their responses. Do they reflect your character’s 
personality and background? If not, how could you make their answers 
reflect your character better?
	
 Bonus: Answer these same questions but imagine instead that your 
character is talking to a confidant instead of publicly. How would 
their answers change? 
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	

102
Character Voice Journal 
Dear Diary: Pretend your character keeps a diary. Write three entries: 
one about their normal day, one about a historical event in the 
character’s life, and one after a big life change for the character. How 
do they react and respond to each event? How does the character write 
when their thoughts are private?
	
 Bonus: Pretend your character is writing a memoir. How much of 
their private thoughts do they share? When writing about their life 
for a public audience, how does their writing change, and how does 
it stay the same?
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	

103
Character Voice Journal 
Retold: It’s your character’s mission to tell someone about their favorite 
book or movie. (For the sake of this exercise, make sure it’s a real book 
or movie that you’re familiar with.) Which details do they include? 
How much do they summarize? Now, have your character retell their 
favorite scene in detail. What sticks out most in their mind? Is it the 
dialogue, the characters, or something else? What do they focus on the 
most in their retelling?
	
 Bonus: If your character were to write a book or produce a movie of 
their own, what kind of story would they want to tell? How would 
they go about doing so?

Building a Backstory 
Your character’s want, flaw, and need didn’t just appear overnight—they were 
developed over time and were shaped by your character’s past experiences. 
What does your character’s past look like? How have their experiences shaped 
who they are now? 
Here are some questions to get the ball rolling with building your character’s 
backstory:
When did your character first realize what they want? What started 
this want? 
	
	
	
What is your character’s earliest memory? Is it positive or negative?
	
	
	
What is your character’s relationship with their close family? How 
about their extended family?
	
	
	

105
Building a Backstory 
How many (if any) close friends did your character have growing up? 
How did they meet those friends?
	
	
	
When did your character first start exhibiting their core flaw?
	
	
	
What is your character afraid of, and why?
	
	
	
What tics or idiosyncrasies does your character have? (Do they avoid 
stepping on sidewalk cracks? Always wink at themselves in the mirror? 
Hum the Mission: Impossible theme while grocery shopping?) How did 
these tics start?
	
	
	

106
Building a Backstory 
When did your character start needing their core need?
	
	
	
What did your character want to be when they grew up? How did that 
change or remain the same as they got older?
	
	
	
What has been the hardest lesson for your character to learn about life 
so far?
	
	
	
What lies does your character believe about life, themselves, other 
people, etc.—and conversely, what truths do they reject?
	
	
	

107
Building a Backstory 
Who was your character’s childhood hero, and why?
	
	
	
If your character was in a room with all the people they’ve ever loved 
(romantic, familial, friend, etc.), who would they go to first?
	
	
	
What does your character believe about themselves and/or the world? 
What made them believe this?
	
	
	
If your character had to write a story about their life, where would they 
start? Would they include every detail, or would they fictionalize?
